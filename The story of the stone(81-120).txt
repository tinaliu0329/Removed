
CHAPTER 81

Four young ladies go fishing and divine the future Bao-yu receives a homily
and is re-enrolled in the Family School

TO CONTINUE OUR STORY
After Ying-chun’s departure, Lady Xing continued as though nothing had happened. It
was Lady Wang who had gone out of her way to be kind, and her sympathy was
genuine and deeply felt. In the morning, when Bao?yu came to her apartment to pay
his respects, he found her alone, sighing pensively to herself. He thought he could
see traces of tears on her cheeks, and not wanting to intrude, stood to one side.
When she told him to sit down, he sidled up onto the kang and settled down next to
her.
He lapsed at once into a silent stare, and she could tell that he had something on his
mind.
‘Well, and what are you looking so glum for?’
‘Nothing really... I just can’t stop thinking about Cousin Ying. It’s so awful. I haven’t
mentioned it to Grannie, hut I haven’t been able to sleep properly for two nights now.
How helpless and defenceless she must feel, especially after growing up in a family
like ours! She’s so weak too, and never could stand up for herself properly. Why
should she of all people have to fall into the hands of such a bully, someone who’ll
never be able to give her the sort of tenderness and understanding she needs?’
He was on the verge of tears.
‘It is hard, I know,’ said Lady Wang. ‘But as they say, marry a daughter, throw out
the water". At this stage, what is there I could possibly do?’
‘I’ve thought of something,’ replied Bao-yu somewhat unexpectedly. ‘It came to me
last night. If we report the whole thing to Grannie, we can get her permission to fetch
Ying and move her back to Amaryllis Eyot. Why not? She’ll be able to lead her old
carefree life, we’ll all be together again, and that Mr Sun can go to hell and take his
temper with him! If he dares to try and ask for her back, we’ll simply refuse to let her
go. He can come a hundred times, we’ll never give in. We’ll just say that it’s Grannie’s
orders, and he won’t be able to do a thing. Don’t you think it’s a brilliant plan?’
‘My dear child!’ exclaimed Lady Wang, her voice reg?istering both amusement and
motherly vexation at this effusion. ‘There you go again; carried away by yet another
of your silly ideas! How can you be so hopelessly naive? Can’t you see that sooner or
later every girl has to leave home, and that once she’s married her own family has no
business to interfere? She must look to her own future. If fate has been kind to her,
well and good. If not, she must learn to live with it all the same. You must know the
old rhyme:

When rooster crows at break of day,
All his hen-folk must obey.
No choice for a dog’s wife
But to make the best of a dog’s life.

Not all the girls can be called to court like your elder sis?ter, you know. Besides, Ying
is still an inexperienced wife, and her husband a young man. Their temperaments
differ, and if at this early stage they don’t get on very well together, that’s only to be
expected. Given time, when they’ve both learned to understand one another better
and have a family of their own, things will sort themselves out, I’m sure they will.
You’re certainly not to breathe a word of this to your grandmother! If I discover that
you have, I shall be extremely cross. Now, off you go, I’ve heard quite enough of your
nonsense.
Realizing that his mother was adamant, Bao-yu sat there a while longer in silence,
then walked listlessly out of the room. Choking with frustration, he made his way
back to the Garden and straight to the Naiad’s House. The instant he entered the
door, he let out a great wail and burst into tears.
Dai-yu, who had only just that minute finished washing and putting up her hair, was
shocked to see the state he was in and asked in some alarm:
‘Whatever’s the matter? Who’s upset you?’
Bao-yu, however, was already slumped over the table, sobbing his heart out and far
too distraught to reply to her questions. From her chair Dai-yu studied him anxiously
for a while, before asking again:
‘Well, at least let me know if I’m the culprit or not...’
‘That’s not it! It’s nothing like that!’ he replied at last, with a despairing motion of
his hand.
‘Then why the tears and everything?’
‘I just think the sooner we all die the better! There’s no joy left in life!’
‘What do you mean? Have you gone quite mad?’
‘I’m not in the slightest mad. Let me explain and I’m sure you’ll feel as I do. When
Ying was here, you saw how she looked, you heard everything she said, didn’t you?
Why is it that the minute they’re grown up, girls are married off and have to suffer so?
When I think of the happy times we all had together when we first started the
Crab-flower Club, always inviting each other round for parties and holding poetry
contests - there seemed no end of wonderful things to do. And now? Bao-chai has
already moved out, which means Caltrop can’t come over either, and with Ying gone
as well, our band of kindred spirits is being broken up, everything is being spoiled!
‘I had thought of a plan, to get Grannie on our side and rescue Ying. But when I told
Mother, she just called me naive and silly and wouldn’t take me seriously. So I had to
give up the idea.
‘You only have to look around you! Our Garden’s altered so much in such a short
time. What could become of it in the next few years just doesn’t bear thinking about.
Now do you see what I mean, and why I can’t help despairing?’
As she listened to all that he was saying, Dai-yu very slowly bowed her head and
moved back almost imper?ceptibly onto the kang. She did not say a word, but only
sighed and curled up facing the wall.
This was how Nightingale found them when she came in to serve tea. Her attempts
to puzzle out what could have happened were cut short by the arrival of Aroma.
‘So this is where you are!’ she said as she came into the room. ‘You’re wanted at
Her Old Ladyship’s, Master Bao. I thought I’d find you here...’
Recognizing Aroma’s voice, Dai-yu sat up a little and nodded to her to sit down.
Bao-yu noticed that her eyes were red from crying.
‘I got a bit carried away, coz,’ he said. ‘Please don’t take it to heart so. What you
must do is look after your?self properly and get fit and well. And when I say that, I
mean it. So have a rest now. I’m wanted at Grannie’s. I’ll be back.’
With these words he set off.
‘What’s up with you two then?’ whispered Aroma.
‘Oh, he’s upset about Miss Ying,’ Dai-yu replied. ‘I’m all right. My eyes have been
itching and I’ve been rubbing them, that’s all.’
Aroma said nothing and hurried out after Bao-yu. He reached Grandmother Jia’s only
to find that she had already retired for her midday nap, and was obliged to go back to
Green Delights.
In the afternoon he woke from his sleep feeling very bored, and picked up a book to
read. Aroma hurried off to make tea, eager to sustain him in his studies. He had
chanced upon an anthology of early verse, and as he turned its pages found himself
reading a stanza by Cao
Cao:

Come drink with me and sing,
For life’s a fleeting thing.
Full many a day has fled
Like the morning dew...

Far from distracting him, this only served to increase his ennui, and he put the book
down and picked up another. This time it was ‘The Gathering at Orchid Pavilion and
other Prose Selections from the Jin Dynasty’. After a page or two he suddenly closed
it, and when Aroma returned with his tea, she found him sitting there, head propped
on hand, looking his most dazed and distant.
‘Why have you given up so soon?’ she asked.
Bao-yu took his tea without a word of reply, drank a sip, then mechanically replaced
the cup. Aroma was out of her depth and could do nothing but stand there dumbly
looking on. Suddenly he stood up, and muttered sarcasti?cally:
‘Oh gemlike ecstasy...’
Aroma half-wanted to laugh, but on reflection thought it safer not to probe too far.
‘If you don’t feel like reading,’ she suggested tactfully, ‘why not go for a walk in the
Garden? There’s no sense in sitting here and working yourself up into one of your
states again.’
Bao-yu mumbled something in reply and walked abstractedly out of the room.
He soon came to Drenched Blossoms Pavilion, and gazed out over the lake. All
around him he saw nothing but dereliction and decay. Walking on, he reached All
Spice Court, which was locked and shuttered. Only its rockery was still tenanted by
the familiar herbs and creep?ers. He was just turning to go on past the Lotus Pavilion,
when something caught his eye. Looking across the water, he could just distinguish a
small group of people leaning over the stone balustrade on Smartweed Bank, and
some maids down below, squatting on their heels and apparent?ly searching for
something. He darted behind a large rock and crept up on them, listening all the
while.
‘Will it come up? Will it...’
He thought he recognized the voice of Li Wan’s cousin, Li Wen. Then came a laugh:
‘There! It’s gone! You see, I told you it wouldn’t bite!’ (There was no mistaking
Tan-chun’s voice.)
‘Of course it won’t if you keep moving about like that, Wen!’
‘Look! It’s going to!’
The last two voices were those of Li Wen’s younger sis?ter Qi, and Lady Xing’s niece
Xiu-yan.
Such an opportunity was altogether too tempting. Pick?ing a brickbat from the
ground, Bao-yu lobbed it into the water right in front of the four girls. There was a
resound?ing splash and they jumped for their lives, with cries of:
‘What the. .. Who’s that trying to give us a scare? Of all the mean.
A beaming Bao-yu sprang from his hiding-place.
‘Having a lovely time, are you? And why wasn’t I invited, pray?’
It was Tan-chun who replied:
‘Typical! I knew it! That had "Bao-yu" written all over it! Well I’m not going to waste
my breath scolding you, just hurry up and catch us another fish to make up for that
one. It was practically on the hook when you had to come along and scare it away.’
‘Not likely!’ said Bao-yu with a grin. ‘Here you are on a fishing excursion and leaving
me out - it’s you who owe me a penalty!’
Everyone laughed.
‘I know,’ he went on. ‘As we’re all fishing today, why don’t we try a round of
"Fateful Fish"? It’s very simple.If you catch a fish it means a year of good luck, and if
you don’t a year of bad luck. Come on, who’s going to have first go?’
Tan-chun offered the rod to Li Wen, but she declined.
‘Oh well,’ said Tan-chun, ‘it looks as if I’ll have to start.
She turned to Bao-yu. ‘If you scare mine away again, brother, you’ll be for it.’
‘I only wanted to make you all jump. You’ll be perfect?ly safe this time, I promise.’
Tan-chun cast her line, and in just a few seconds a little ‘leaf-wriggler’ swallowed the
hook and down went the float. She pulled in and landed her catch, alive and
jump?ing. Scribe, after a lot of scrambling about, managed to get a grip on the thing,
and carrying it over in both hands, placed it carefully in a little earthenware jar of
fresh water. Tan-chun passed the rod on to Wen. She too felt a tug on the line almost
immediately, and pulled in excitedly, only to find nothing on the hook. She cast out
again, and this time stood there angling for ages. At last the line tautened and she
pulled in again. Another false alarm. She picked up the hook to examine it, and
discovered that it was buckled.
‘No wonder I couldn’t catch anything!’
She laughed and without more ado told Candida to straighten it out for her, put on
some fresh bait and fasten on the reed-float securely. This time after only a few
min?utes, down went the float, in she pulled with great deter?mination, and there it
was - a little two-inch silver carp. Delighted, she turned to Bao-yu.
‘You next.’
‘Qi and Xiu-yan must go first,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘I insist.’
Xiu-yan was silent.
‘You go first, Cousin Bao,’ protested Qi. As she spoke a big bubble popped on the
water.
‘Come On!’ cried Tan-chun. ‘There’s no need to overdo it. Look, the fish are all over
there by you, Qi. You have a go quickly!’
Qi took the rod with a giggle of embarrassment. Sure enough, down went her float
and she had a catch first time. Xiu-yan was the last of the girls to have her turn. She
caught one and passed the rod back to Tan-chun, who handed it on to Bao-yu.
‘I shall follow in the footsteps of old Sire Jiang,’ he declared.

                      ‘Straight was his hook,
                      His bait a single grain:
    Yet of their own accord
         The fish unto him came...’

Walking solemnly down the jetty, he sat at the water’s edge in the pose of the
Fisherman Sage. Unfortunately, at the approach of this human shadow, the fish took
refuge in the far end of the pond, and for all his exertions in the higher art of angling,
a long time seemed to pass without the slightest sign of a bite. When once a fish did
venture near and deigned to blow a few bubbles near the bank, he jerked the rod
and scared it away.
‘Oh dear!’ he sighed. ‘It’s no good. The trouble is that I’m so confoundedly
impatient, and the fish are so slow on the uptake. We must be incompatible. I shall
never catch anything at this rate. Come on now, help me! Feel yourself being drawn,
there’s my brave little fish!’
There was a peal of laughter from the girls. Then, be?fore anyone could say a word,
the line was seen to move a fraction. A bite at last! The sage yanked in for all he was
worth. The rod crashed into a protruding rock and broke clean in two. The line
snapped, and the hook (with what?ever it may or may not have secured) sank
without trace. This final stroke of virtuosity had his audience in stitches. Tan-chun
called out:
‘I’ve never seen such a clumsy fool!’
As she was speaking, who should come rushing up but Musk, in a state of great
excitement.
‘Master Bao, Her Old Ladyship has woken up and wants to see you at once!’
The five of them exchanged startled glances.
‘But what about?’ asked Tan-chun.
‘I don’t know,’ replied Musk. ‘All I heard was some?thing about a "scandalous
revelation" they want to ques?tion Master Bao about. They’ve asked Mrs Lian to
come and answer questions as well.’
Bao-yu stood for a moment in stunned silence. Even?tually he said:
‘I wonder which poor maid is in for the high jump this time?’
‘We’ve no idea what it’s about,’ said Tan-chun, ‘so Bao, you’d better go straight
away and as soon as you’ve any news, send Musk over to let us know.’
The four girls went their way, and Bao-yu set off for Grandmother Jia’s apartment. He
arrived to find her in the middle of a game of cards with Lady Wang, and real?ized to
his relief that it could be nothing as serious as he had feared. Grandmother Jia saw
him come in and asked him:
‘Bao darling, do you remember last year, when you were so seriously ill , and those
two holy men - that mad-looking monk and that lame Taoist - came and cured you, in
the nick of time - what did the illness feel like?’
Bao-yu reflected for a moment.
‘I can remember how it started. I was standing in my room when suddenly
someone seemed to come from be?hind and ram something hard, like a wooden bar,
up against the back of my head. It hurt like anything, my eyes started throbbing and
everything went pitch-black. All I could see in the room was a mob of green-faced
devils with huge fangs, carrying swords and cudgels. I went to lie down on the kang,
but then it felt as if I had tight bands round my head and the pain became so
excruciating that I no longer knew what was happening.
‘I remember how I got better. There was a ray of golden light from the hall outside
my room, that shone right onto my bed. The devils just took to their heels and
vanished. They seemed scared of the light. My headache went away and I felt quite
myself again.’
‘You see!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia, turning to Lady Wang. ‘It ties in perfectly.’
As she was speaking, Xi-feng entered the room and greeted first Grandmother Jia,
then Lady Wang.
‘What did you want to ask me about, Grannie?’ she asked.
‘Tell me,’ replied Grandmother Jia, ‘can you recall that nasty attack you had last
year?’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Not very clearly. The main thing I remember about it is that I was possessed. There
was someone manipulating me, filling my head with the most bloodthirsty intentions.
I had a terrible urge to grab hold of everything in sight and kill it. I was exhausted, but
I couldn’t stop.’
‘And then?’ asked Grandmother Jia. ‘When you were cured?’
‘There was a voice,’ replied Xi-feng, ‘that seemed to speak to me from nowhere.
But what it said I honestly can’t remember.’
‘That settles it!’ exclaimed the old lady. ‘That’s exactly the sort of thing she got up
to! So it was her doing, it must have been! Oh! How could the old woman sink so low
- and Bao-yu’s own godmother too! Gracious Lord, to think that if those two holy
men had not arrived in time, he might easily have died! And we still have not re?paid
them...’
‘But Grannie,’ asked Xi-feng, ‘what made you think of all this in the first place?’
‘Ask your aunt,’ replied Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve done enough of the talking.’
Lady Wang took over the story.
‘Sir Zheng told us when he was here this morning. Apparently Bao-yu’s godmother,
Mother Ma, is an evil old woman and a practising witch. As the result of certain
scandalous revelations, she’s been arrested by the secret police and sent to the
Central Jail. I should imagine she’s been sentenced to death by now.
‘The whole thing started the other day, when a Mr Pan San-bao informed against
her. He had been trying to sell a property to a pawnbroker across the street. His price
had already risen by several hundred per cent, and when he asked for more the
pawnbroker backed out. So, in an attempt to salvage his sale, Mr Pan hired the
services of our Mother Ma, whom he knew to be a regular visitor at the pawnshop
and intimate with all the womenfolk there. She duly succeeded, by some evil means,
in throwing the pawnbroker’s wife into a convulsion, Then, waiting until the attack
reached alarming proportions, she had the effrontery to arrive in person, claiming to
possess a patent cure for the affliction. And sure enough, after a few burnt offerings
of her paper charms, paper money and so forth, the wife recovered and the witch
coolly demanded a dozen or so taels of silver for her services in exorcizing her own
spell!
‘But nothing escapes the watchful eye of the Good Lord Buddha,’ continued Lady
Wang. ‘Her detection and downfall were already close at hand. That same day, in her
haste to leave the pawnbroker’s premises, she inadver?tently dropped a silk bundle.
The pawnbroker picked it up, took a look inside, and noticed a number of paper
figures and four unusually potent cakes of incense. He be?came suspicious, and
when the old woman returned to re?cover her bundle he seized her and subjected
her to a quick search. He discovered hidden on her person a casket containing two
ivory statuettes, a male and a female, both completely naked you know those
pocket-sized figures of the devil they use - and seven red embroidery needles.
‘She was taken straight to the secret police, and when questioned revealed her
intimate connections with the mistresses and young ladies of several eminent and
wealthy families. The case was reported to the highest authorities, and her house
was searched. They found quite a few clay figures of those horrible Spectral Furies
and several boxes of narcotic incense; also, hanging in a hidden compartment behind
the kang, a Seven Star Lamp with all kinds of straw effigies spread below it, some
with bands round their heads, others with nails through their chests or padlocks
round their necks. She had a whole cupboard full of spare paper figures, and there
were account slips all over the floor, listing families dealt with and amounts
out?standing, together with records of goodness knows how much money received
for “oil and incense”.’
‘Our attacks were definitely her doing!’ exclaimed Xi-?feng. ‘I remember now. It
was after we recovered - when the old witch came to visit Aunt Zhao a couple of
times to collect her "contributions" - something horrible seemed to come over her
when she saw me; she went pale, and there was a nasty look in her eyes. I wondered
what it meant at the time, but I just couldn’t see any reason for her to cause trouble.
After what you’ve just said, though, it all makes sense. With my responsibilities I
can’t help making enemies, and some of them are bound to try and get their own
back somehow or other. But who could bear a grudge against Bao-yu? That must be
pure malice.’
‘Or jealousy,’ suggested Grandmother Jia, ‘because she knows I’m not as fond of
Huan as I am of Bao-yu. Perhaps that’s why she tried to harm you both.’
‘Anyway,’ said Lady Wang, ‘as the old woman is already in prison, we won’t be able
to call on her to tes?tify, and without her evidence we will never be able to make
Aunt Zhao confess. Besides we simply can’t have the family involved in a scandal of
this sort. We must bide our time. She is certain to give herself away sooner or later.’
‘You’re quite right,’ Grandmother Jia complimented Lady Wang. ‘In cases like this it
is so hard to prove any?thing without conclusive evidence. We must just be thank?ful
that the all-seeing Lord Buddha and his bodhisattvas have kept our two from harm.
There! It’s all over! And please, Feng, don’t ever bring the subject up again. You can
both stay and have dinner with me.’ She turned to Faithful and Amber. ‘Tell them we
are ready to be served.’
The old lady’s parting shot did not go unnoticed by Xi?-feng, who laughed and said:
‘So now I’m the one that set you worrying, am I?’
Lady Wang laughed at them both. Meanwhile the waiting-women were standing
expectantly outside the door, and Xi-feng told the junior maids that she and Lady
Wang were staying to dinner and that they could com?mence service. As she was
speaking, Silver came in with a message for Lady Wang from Sir Zheng. He had
mislaid something, and would she go over after dinner and help him find it?
‘You’d better go now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You never know - it might be
something important.’
‘Yes, Mother.’
Leaving Xi-feng to hold the fort, Lady Wang walked over to her own apartment. A
brief search soon revealed the missing item.
‘Has Ying-chun gone back yet?’ Jia Zheng asked her in the course of conversation.
‘How is she getting on with the Suns?’
‘The poor girl could do nothing but cry while she was here,’ replied Lady Wang.
‘She says her husband is an absolute monster.’
Jia Zheng sighed as she told him Ying-chun’s sad tale.
‘I knew they were unsuited,’ he commented. ‘But what could I do? Brother She
insisted on going ahead with it. The child will have her share of suffering, I’m afraid.’
‘They’ve not been married long, don’t forget,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘We must hope
that time will sort things out for them.’
She suddenly laughed.
‘What’s the joke?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘Oh, I just remembered some nonsense of Bao-yu’s. He came here first thing this
morning specially to talk to me about Ying-chun.’
‘Oh yes? What did he have to say?’
Lady Wang gave a humorous account of her early morning interview with Bao-yu and
of his ‘brilliant plan’, which despite himself Jia Zheng found rather amusing.
‘Speaking of Bao-yu,’ he said, in a more serious tone, ‘the boy spends all his time
loafing about in the garden - it simply won’t do. With one’s daughters - well, one has
one’s disappointments, I realize, but in the long run girls get married and leave the
family anyway. With a son, however, it is totally different. If he should fall by the
wayside, the whole future of the family could be threatened.
‘It so happens that only the other day a friend recom?mended a tutor, a
widely-read scholar, a man of the high?est principles, and what is more a southerner
like ourselves. But I have come to the conclusion that southerners are altogether too
easy-going for the boys up here in the capital, who misbehave themselves
abominably and are most of them smart enough to get by without having to do a
stroke of work. They’re a bumptious breed to be?gin with, and if their teacher
mollycoddles them and is not prepared to take them down a peg or two, it’s a waste
of everyone’s time.
‘That is why it has never been a family practice to en?gage outside tutors, and why
we have always had a mem?ber of the clan, an older man, with a decent smattering
of culture of course, to run the school. Dai-ru, the present preceptor, may be rather a
mediocre scholar, but he’s cer?tainly an effective disciplinarian, and sees to it that
the work gets done. Bao-yu’s present state of idleness is thor?oughly unsatisfactory,
and in my opinion the best solution would be for him to resume his studies at the
Family School.’
‘I agree with you entirely,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Since your last posting he has been
constantly ill, and what with one thing and another has fallen a long way behind with
his studies. I think the routine of going to school would do him good.’
Jia Zheng nodded, and they continued chatting for a while longer.

Little time was lost. The very next day, as soon as Bao-yu was up and had finished
washing and combing his hair, a deputation of pages arrived and sent in the message:
‘Sir Zheng wishes to see Master Bao.’ Hurriedly tidying his clothes, Bao-yu went
straight over to his father’s study. He paid his morning respects and stood to
attention.
‘Tell me,’ Jia Zheng began, ‘what you have been doing recently in the way of work?
A fair amount, were you going to say? A very magnum opus of your worthless
doodling, no doubt... I have observed you of late. Your idleness goes from strength to
strength. I am also con?stantly hearing of some new ailment of yours, or shall we
rather say ingenious pretext to play truant. I trust I find you fully recovered?
‘Another thing: I gather you spend the greater part of your time fooling around
with your cousins in the garden, and that even the maidservants are permitted to
participate in your infantile antics. Isn’t it time you grew up and ac?quired a little
self-esteem? You must understand that those verses you write are not going to
impress anyone. The only thing the examiners are interested in is a well-written
composition. And the effort you have expended in that direction has so far been
non-existent.
‘Now listen carefully to what I have to say. From to?day, I want you to forget all
about your verses and coup?lets. You are to concentrate exclusively on Octopartite
Compositions. I will give you twelve months’ grace. If by the end of that time you are
still in your present unre?generate state, you may as well give up altogether, and I for
my part shall have to think again about owning a creat?ure like you as my son.’
He summoned Li Gui.
‘Inform Tealeaf that he is to take Bao-yu first thing tomorrow morning to collect the
required textbooks, and then bring them here for my inspection. I shall be
accom?panying him to school myself.’
Turning to Bao-yu:
‘Off with you!’ he trumpeted. ‘I shall expect you early tomorrow morning.’
Bao-yu returned to Green Delights, where Aroma was anxiously awaiting him. The
pleasure with which she re?ceived the news of his renewed course of study
contrasted strangely with the incredulous horror that had rendered him speechless
while in Jia Zheng’s presence, and that now prompted him to send an urgent
message through to Grandmother Jia, begging her to intervene. She sent for him at
once and said:
‘You should give it a try, my darling. You don’t want to anger your father. Don’t
worry. Remember I shall always be here if you need me.’
There was nothing for it but to go back and give the maids their instructions. ‘Wake
me at the crack of dawn, as Father will be waiting to take me to school.’ Aroma and
Musk took it in turns to stay awake that night.
In the morning Aroma woke Bao-yu punctually, helped him wash, comb his hair and
dress, and sent a junior maid out with instructions for Tealeaf to wait with the books
at the inner gate. She had to spur him on a couple of times before finally he left and
made his way towards the study. On his way he stopped to inquire if Sir Zheng had
arrived yet, and was informed by a page from the study that one of the literary
gentlemen had just called, but had been kept waiting outside, as the Master was still
in his dress?ing-room. This calmed Bao-yu’s nerves a little, and he proceeded on to
the inner sanctum. As luck would have it, a servant was at that very moment coming
out on his way to fetch him, so he went straight in. After another brief homily, Jia
Zheng led the way and father and son took a carriage to the school, Tealeaf following
with the books.
A look-out had been posted, and Dai-ru had been alerted and was standing in
readiness for the party’s arrival. Before the old man could come forward to greet him,
however, Jia Zheng walked into the schoolroom and paid his respects. Dai-ru took
him by the hand and inquired politely after Lady Jia. Bao-yu then went up and paid
his respects. Jia Zheng remained standing throughout, and in?sisted on waiting until
Dai-ru was seated before sitting down himself.
‘I have come here today,’ he began, ‘because I felt the need to entrust my son to
you personally, and with a few words of instruction. He is no longer a child, and if he
is to shoulder his responsibilities and earn a place in the world, it is high time he
applied himself conscientiously to preparing for his exams. At home, unfortunately,
he spends all his time idling about in the company of child?ren. His verses, the only
field in which he has acquired any competence, are for the most part turgid juvenilia,
at their best romantic trifles devoid of substance.’
‘And he looks such a fine lad,’ interposed Dai-ru. ‘He seems so intelligent. Why this
refusal to study, this perverse streak of hedonism? Not that one should entirely
neglect poetic composition. But there is surely time enough for that later on in one’s
career.’
‘Precisely,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘For the present I would humbly suggest a course of
reading and exegesis of prim?ary scriptural texts, and plenty of compositions. If he
should show the least sign of being a recalcitrant pupil, I earnestly beseech you to
take him in hand, and in so doing to save him from a shallow and wasted life.’
On this note he rose, and with a bow and a few parting remarks took his leave. Dai-ru
accompanied him to the door.
‘Please convey my respects to Lady Jia.’
‘I will,’ said Jia Zheng, and climbed into his carriage.
When Dai-ru returned to the classroom, Bao-yu was already sitting at a small
rosewood desk in the south-west corner of the room, by the window. He had two
sets of texts and a meagre-looking volume of model compositions stacked in a pile on
his right. Tealeaf was instructed to put his paper, ink, brush and inkstone away in the
drawer of the desk.
‘I understand you have been ill, Bao-yu,’ said Dai-ru. ‘I hope you are quite
recovered?’
Bao-yu rose to his feet.
‘Quite recovered, thank you sir.’
‘We must see to it that you apply yourself with zeal from now on. Your father is
most insistent that you should do well. Start by revising the texts you have already
memorized.
‘Your timetable will be as follows:
Pre-prandium - General Revision
Post-prandium - Calligraphy
Meridianum - Exegesis
And conclude the day’s work by reciting quietly to your?self a few model
compositions. That should do for the time being.’
‘Yes sir.’
As Bao-yu sat down again, he glanced around him. Most of the old faces from the
Jokey Jin days were gone, and in their place were quite a few new boys. He reflected
on their exceptionally boorish appearance, and the face of Qin Zhong came suddenly
into his mind. Since the death of his friend there had been no one to keep him
company in his studies, no one to share his innermost thoughts. He was
overwhelmed with a sense of grief and loneliness, and sat silently staring at his
books.
Not long afterwards Dai-ru came over to say that as this was his first day he could
leave early.
‘Tomorrow,’ he said, ‘I shall go through a passage with you. On second thoughts, to
do justice to your natural in?telligence, I should like you to expound a passage or two
for me. That will give me a clearer idea of the sort of work you have been doing and
the standard you have reached.’
Bao-yu’s heart was already thumping. But to learn how he fared the following day,
you must read the next chapter.

CHAPTER 82

An o1d pedant tries to instil some Moral Philosophy
into his incorrigible pupil
And the ailing Naiad, in a nightmare, confronts the
spectres of her fevered mind


‘Bravo!’ cried Grandmother Jia as Bao-yu came in from school. ‘So they’ve finally
broken in my frisky colt! Come along now, your father will be expecting to see you
I’m sure. Then you must find something nice and relaxing to do.’
‘Yes, Grannie.’
Bao-yu reported to the study.
‘Back already?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Well, has the Preceptor given you a scheme of
work?’
Bao-yu rehearsed his timetable: ‘Pre-prandium - Gener?al Revision; Post-prandium -
Calligraphy; Meridianum -Exegesis and reading of model compositions.’
‘ H’m...’ Jia Zheng nodded. ‘Fair enough. Off you go now and keep your
grandmother company for a little while. Let’s see if you can turn over a new leaf and
behave seriously from now on. No more of the old childish non?sense, eh? Go to bed
on time, rise early, and attend your classes regularly. Understood?’
With a string of fluent ‘Yes Sirs’, Bao-yu backed smartly out of the study. He hurried
over to see his mother, put in another brief appearance at Grandmother Jia’s - so
brief that he hardly had time to turn around - then dashed off once more, impatient
to reach the Naiad’s House.
‘I’m back!’ he called from outside the doorway. The un?expectedness of his arrival,
and the explosion of laughing and clapping that announced it, gave Dai-yu quite a
turn. Nightingale drew aside the portiere and he walked in and sat himself down.
‘Does my memory fail me,’ said Dai-yu, ‘or didn’t I hear something to the effect that
you were going to school today? Haven’t you been let off rather early?’
‘Goodness!’ exclaimed Bao-yu. ‘I can hardly believe it! Yes, Father did banish me to
that place - what an ordeal! I don’t know how I stuck it out! I thought I’d never see
you all again! But now, one glimpse of you has raised my spirit from the dead! How
does the old Song go?


‘Twas scarce a day we were apart
It seemed three autumns long!

That’s just how I feel.’
‘Have you been to see Grandmother and your parents?’ asked Dai-yu.
‘Yes, yes...
‘And the others?’
‘Not yet.’
‘Shouldn’t you go and see them now?’
‘But I don’t feel like going anywhere. All I want to do is sit here and chat with you
for a bit. Anyway Father says from now on it’s "early to bed and early to rise" so the
others will have to wait until tomorrow.
‘Very well then,’ said Dai-yu. ‘A short stay. Then you must be sensible and go and lie
down.
‘But I’m not tired,’ protested Bao-yu. ‘Just fed up with all that. It’s doing me a world
of good in fact, being here with you, if you’d only stop thinking of all these things I
should be doing.’
A faint smile crossed Dai-yu’s face.
‘Nightingale, would you make Master Bao a cup of Dragon Well tea? We must see
that scholarship is suitably rewarded.’
Nightingale smiled and went to fetch the tea, which she entrusted. to one of the
junior maids. Bao-yu reacted smartly.
‘Scholarship! Why, you’re almost beginning to sound like one of them! I can’t abide
all that hypocritical moralizing. And those absurd Octopartite essays, which they have
the nerve to call "Propagation of Holy Writ", are nothing more than a shoddy way of
worming themselves into a job. The whole thing makes me sick! Not content with
botching together a few classical tags, they try to hide the fact that they haven’t got a
single original idea of their own by churning out a lot of far-fetched purple passages
-and then pride themselves on having been "subtle" and "profound". Urrghhh! Holy
Writ! Holy Pretentious Humbug I’d call it! I know Father is forcing that sort of thing
down my throat at present, and I just have to grin and bear it, but that’s no reason
for you to go on about it the moment I’m back.’
‘I know girls don’t have to read Octopartites,’ replied Dai-yu. ‘But when I was little
and was having lessons with your cousin Yu-cun, I looked at a few and remember
thinking that some were quite well thought out and sen?sibly written. One or two
were even quite subtle, and had a certain delicate charm. They were rather above my
head at the time, but I still enjoyed reading them. It’s silly to run them all down.
Anyway, I think if you want to get on in life, this is quite an admirable way of doing it.
Bao-yu could hardly believe his ears. What had come over Dai-yu? She had never
preached wordly wisdom at him like this before. Not wishing to provoke a full-scale
argument, however, he restricted himself to a little snort of amazement.
Meanwhile, voices could be heard outside.
‘Aroma sent me to Her Old Ladyship’s to fetch Master Bao home from school.’ It
was Ripple. ‘I’ve tracked him down at last!’
‘Go on,’ replied Nightingale. ‘Let him drink his tea first. It’s just this minute been
made.’
The two maids came in together, and Bao-yu laughed:
‘I was just on my way, Ripple; you shouldn’t have bothered to come.
‘You’d best drink your tea and be off!’ Nightingale chimed in, before Ripple could
get a word in. ‘Can’t you see how they’ve been pining for you all day...
‘Pscht! You mean little fibber!’ cried Ripple, rising per?fectly to the bait. Everyone
laughed. Bao-yu finally stood up to say goodbye, and Dai-yu saw him to the door.
Nightingale stood at the foot of the steps till he was on his way, and then she too
went back indoors.
When Bao-yu arrived at Green Delights, Aroma emerged from the inner room to
greet him.
‘Finished school then?’ she asked.
‘Oh, Master Bao’s been back for ages,’ Ripple answered for him. ‘He’s been at Miss
Lin’s.’
‘Did anything happen while I was away?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘Oh, nothing much,’ replied Aroma pointedly. ‘Just a lecture from Faithful. Her
Ladyship sent her to let us know that this time the Master is in deadly earnest about
your studies, and if any of us dares to play the fool with you again, we’ll be dealt with
like Skybright and Chess.’ She sighed. ‘We do our very best to serve you, and that’s all
the thanks we get. It’s all so pointless.’
Her evident distress brought a swift reply from Bao-yu.
‘My poor Aroma! You’ve no need to worry. So long as I work hard, none of you
need ever hear another word from Mother. I’m going to do some work this evening,
as the Preceptor wants me to do some exposition tomorrow. If there’s anything I
need, Musk and Ripple can get it for me, so you go and have a rest.’
‘If only you would work hard,’ said Aroma, ‘it would be a joy to serve you.
Inspired by her words, Bao-yu bolted his supper, had his reading-lamp lit and sat
down straight away to revise his basic texts, the Four Books of Confucian Scripture.
One glance at the first page, however, with its columns of heavily annotated text, and
he began to experience a familiar sinking feeling. He tried flicking through one
volume, and the general drift seemed clear enough; but the moment he went into it
in any detail, it seemed to slip from his grasp. He turned for help to the marginal
com?mentaries, he read the expository essays, keeping up the struggle till late in the
evening.
‘Poems are easy,’ he thought to himself. ‘But I can’t make head or tail of this stuff.’
He sat back, gazed at the ceiling and was soon lost in a daydream.
‘Bedtime,’ said Aroma firmly. ‘You’ve done quite enough work for this evening.’
Bao-yu gave an inaudible reply. Musk and Aroma helped him into bed, and then went
to sleep themselves.
During the night, they woke to hear him tossing and turning on the kang.
‘Are you still awake?’ said Aroma. ‘You must stop fret?ting and have a good night’s
sleep. You can work hard again tomorrow.
‘I know,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘But I just can’t get to sleep. Come and take off one of my
covers.
‘It’s a cold night. You’d better keep it on.
‘I feel so restless!’ He threw back the top cover himself. Aroma immediately
clambered over to tuck it in again, and put her hand to his brow. It felt slightly
feverish.
‘Lie still!’ she said. ‘You’ve a fever.’
‘I know.’
‘What’s the matter?’
‘It’s nothing. I’m just nervous, that’s all. Please don’t make a thing of it. If Father
finds out, he’s bound to say I’m cooking up an excuse to miss school. It would seem
too much of a coincidence. I’ll feel better in the morning, and once I’m at school it’ll
go away.
Aroma gave in.
‘I’ll sleep here by your side,’ she said. She massaged his back a little and in no time
they were both fast asleep. When they woke next morning the sun was already high
in the sky.
‘Help!’ cried Bao-yu. ‘I’m late!’ He quickly washed and combed his hair, completed
his round of morning duties and set off for school. The Preceptor’s severe expression
as he walked into the schoolroom did not bode well.
‘Tardy, boy, tardy! What is the meaning of this? Small wonder that you have
incurred your father’s displeasure and caused him to call you his prodigal son, if this
is the way you think you can behave on your second day.’
Bao-yu told him of his fever the night before, then crossed over to his desk and sat
down to his work.
It was late in the afternoon when he was called forward.
‘Bao-yu, step up here. Oral Exposition of this text.’
Bao-yu walked up. On inspection, he found to his relief that it was a rubric he knew.
Analects, chapter IX, verse XXII: Maxima Debetur Puero Reverentia - RESPECT DUE TO
YOUTH. ‘What a stroke of luck!’ he thought to himself. ‘Thank goodness it’s not from
the Mag* (Young scholars of that time were wont to use these affectionate
abbreviations to refer to those two other venerable texts of Scripture, the Magna
Scientia or (Great Learning and the Medium Immutabile or Doc?trine of the Mean.
) or the Med!’
‘How do you wish me to begin, sir?’
‘Amplificatio Totius, boy. Give the substance of the pas?sage carefully in your own
words.’
Bao-yu first recited the original chapter, in the pre?scribed sing-song intonation, and
then began:
‘In this verse we have the Sage’s Exhortation to Youth to Seize the Hour and Strive
with Zeal, lest they end up becoming...’
Bao-yu looked up at Dai-ru. The Preceptor sensed what was coming and tried to
conceal his embarrassment with a short laugh:
‘Come on boy, come on. What is holding you back? Are you afraid of using a
non-licet expression up to books? Remember: Scriptural Exegesis is exempt from the
normal rules of Verbal Prohibition. Liber Rituum, Book I: "In Canonicorum
Classicorumque Librorum Stu?dus Nomenclationum cessat Prohibitio." What may
they end up becoming?’
‘Complete Failures, sir,’ said Bao-yu, barely suppress?ing a mischievous smile. ‘In
the first Segment, Sunt Verendi, the Sage is Spurring Youth on to Moral En?deavour
in the Present, while the last Segment, Non Sunt Digni Quos Verearis, contains his
Caution for the Future.’
He looked up again at Dai-ru.
‘That will do. Interpretatio Partium.’
Bao-yu began again:
‘Confucius saith: "For the Duration of Youth, each Spiritual and Mental Talent must
be held in Due Esteem. For how can we ever Predict with Certainty another’s
Ultimate Station in Life? But if a man, by Drifting and Wasting his Days, should reach
the Age of Forty or Fifty and still be Unsuccessful and Obscure, then it can fairly be
said that his Youthful Promise was an Empty One. He will have Forfeited For Ever the
Esteem of his Fellow Men."‘
‘Your Arnplificatio Totius was passably clear,’ com?mented Dai-ru with a dry smile.
‘But I am afraid your In?terpretatio Partium showed a good deal of immaturity. In the
phrase sine Nomine, Nomen refers not to Success in the Worldly Sense but rather to
an Individual’s Achieve?ment in the Moral and Intellectual Spheres. In this sense it by
no means implies Official Rank. On the contrary, many of the Great Sages of Antiquity
were Obscure Failures who Withdrew from the World; and yet we hold them in the
Highest Esteem, do we not? Nonne sunt Dig?ni quos Vereamur?
‘You construe the last sentence incorrectly,’ he droned on. ‘Here it is not the
element of Esteem but the Irrecon?cilable Nature of the Judgement of his Fellow
Men that is being contrasted with their Tentative Appraisal of him as a Youth (see
second sentence of your text). This emphasis is central to a Correct Elucidation of the
passage. Do you follow me?’
‘Yes, sir.’
‘Good. Here is another.’
Dai-ru turned back a few pages and pointed out a pas?sage to Bao-yu. It was Analects
again, this time chapter IX, verse XVIII: Ego nondum vidi qui amet Virtutem sicut
amat Pulchram Spedem - THE RARITY OF A SIN?CERE LOVE OF VIRTUE. Bao-yu
scented danger ahead and said with his most ingenuous smile:
‘I’m afraid I can’t think of anything to say, sir.’
‘Nonsense, my boy! Is that what you would write if it turned up as a Thema in your
paper?’
Reluctantly Bao-yu set the wheels in motion.
‘Confucius saith: ‘Men will not love Virtue, and yet they Fall Down and Worship
Sensual Beauty at First Sight. The Reason for this Disaffection is that they are Blind to
the Intrinsicality of Virtue. Beauty is an Intrinsic Quality too, and as such Loved by All,
but it belongs to the Realm of Human Desire, whereas Virtue is a Natural Principle.
How can Principle hope to Compete with De?sire for the Affections of men?
Confucius is both Lament?ing the State of the World and Hoping for a Change of
Heart. The Love of Virtue he has observed has been for the most part a Shallow and
Short-lived Affair. How Fine it would be if only men would feel for Virtue the
Devo?tion they feel towards Beauty...
‘Thank you, that will do,’ said Dai-ru. ‘I have but one question to put to you. If you
understand the words of Confucius so well, why is it that you transgress these very
two Precepts? I am only an outsider, but without need of explanation from your
Father I can identify your Moral Shortcomings. One cannot hope to become a Man
except by dint of Constant Self-Improvement. You are at present a Youth of Promise,
or as our text has it Puer Verendus. Whether or not you Fulfil this Promise depends
entirely on your own efforts. Are you to be a Man of Merit, Vir Nominis, or are you to
be a Man No Longer Esteemed by his Fellow-Men, Vir Non lam Verendus?
‘I shall allow you an initial period of one month in which to revise your old texts
thoroughly, and a further month in which to study models of Octopartite
Composi?tion. At the end of the second month I intend to set you your Maiden
Theme. If I detect any sign of slackness on your part, you need not expect me to be
lenient. As the saying goes:

Perfection comes through ceaseless effort;
Effortless ease brings but perdition.

Be sure to bear in mind all that I have said.’
‘Yes sir.’

And so we must leave Bao-yu for the present, submitting reluctantly to his daily
lessons. During his absence at school, Green Delights became unrecognizably quiet
and the days passed slowly and uneventfully. Aroma even found time to do some
sewing. One day she sat down to finish a betel-nut ‘refresher’ bag she had been
embroider?ing, and fell to thinking of the great change wrought in all their lives by
Bao-yu’s new routine. How easy life was for the maids now that he was away all day!
If things had only been like this earlier, Skybright might never have come to such a
wretched end. Poor Skybright! Aroma sighed; for does not the hare in the trap set
the fox’s heart a-beating? It was the shortest step from grieving for Skybright to
brooding over her own future. What was to become of her? What sort of a life would
she lead, as Bao-yu’s concubine? Bao-yu himself was no problem. She knew how to
handle him. But what if he were to marry someone like Mrs Lian or Mr Pan’s new
wife? Was she fated to be a second You Er-jie or Caltrop? To judge from Lady Jia and
Lady Wang’s attitude in the past, and from the frequent hints dropped by Mrs Lian, it
seemed a foregone conclusion that he would marry Miss Lin. Now there was a
complicated young lady...
With this new turn of thought Aroma’s colour deepened, her heart beat faster and
her aim with the needle became more and more erratic. Finally she aban?doned her
embroidery altogether and set off for the Naiad’s House, determined to put Dai-yu’s
disposition towards her to the test.
Dai-yu was reading a book. When she saw Aroma come in, she moved over slightly
and nodded to her to sit down.
‘I hope you’re feeling quite better, Miss,’ began Aroma, anxious to create the right
impression.
‘Not really,’ replied Dai-yu. ‘I suppose I do feel a little less weak. What have you
been doing at home?’
‘Now that Master Bao’s at school,’ replied Aroma, ‘it’s very quiet at home, so I
thought I’d come round for a chat.’
Nightingale came in with tea and Aroma rose promptly to her feet.
‘Please sit down, Nightingale dear.’ She laughed as she continued. ‘You’ve been
making fun of us, so Ripple was telling me the other day...’
‘You don’t take any notice of what she says, do you?’ said Nightingale with a smile.
‘All I meant was that with Master Bao away at school all day, and Miss Chai and
Caltrop both living out, things must be dull for you.
Aroma seized her opportunity:
‘Caltrop, did I hear you say? Oh, that poor girl! I feel so sorry for her! This new wife
of Mr Pan’s is a Total Eclipse if ever there was one! She’s even worse than a cer?tain
person...’ Here Aroma held up two fingers, indicat?ing the Second Young Lady of the
household - Xi-feng. ‘This Mrs Pan doesn’t seem to care a bit what people think.’
‘That certain person was bad enough,’ said Dai-yu. ‘To think that You Er-jie is dead!’
‘I know,’ said Aroma. ‘They were both human beings; after all. It was only their
positions that were different. Why did she have to be so malicious? It hasn’t done
the family name any good.’
This was the first time Dai-yu had heard Aroma gossip like this, and she began to
suspect what was at the back of it.
‘It’s hard to tell,’ she said. ‘In every family affair, one side or the other has to win. If
it’s not the East Wind it’s the West.’
‘A concubine should know her place,’ said Aroma. ‘She should be too scared to take
advantage of the wife.’
At this point in the conversation an old woman’s voice was heard in the outer
courtyard.
‘Is this where Miss Lin lives? Which maid is in charge here?’ Snowgoose went out to
see who it was, and vaguely recognized her as one of Aunt Xue’s serving-women.
‘What do you want?’ she asked.
‘I’m here on an errand for Miss Bao-chai,’ replied the woman. ‘Something for Miss
Lin.’
‘Wait here a minute.’ Snowgoose went in to consult with Dai-yu, who told her to
show the old woman in. Once inside the room, she curtseyed to Dai-yu, then
screwed up her eyes and peered at her curiously. Not a word of her errand. Dai-yu
began to feel rather embarrass?ed, and asked what it was that Bao-chai had sent
over.
‘ A pot of honeyed lychees is what I’ve been instructed by Miss Bao-chai to bring
to you, Miss Lin,’ replied the old woman, her features relaxing into a smile. Then she
spotted Aroma in the room. ‘Why, if it isn’t Master Bao’s maid, Miss Hua!’
‘That’s right, nanny dear,’ replied Aroma. ‘And how did you come to know who I
was?’
‘Well, looking after Madam’s room as we do, we hardly ever go out visiting with
Madam and Miss Bao-chai, so you wouldn’t recognize us. But we remember just
about all the young ladies that come round our way.’
She handed the pot to Snowgoose, took another look at Dai-yu, then turned back to
Aroma and said with a con?fidential smile:
    ‘No wonder our Madam says that Miss Lin and your Master Bao were made for
one another! She really does look just like a fairy!’
Aroma made a valiant attempt to avert any further blunders.
‘Come along, nanny, you must be tired. Why don’t you sit down and have a cup of
tea?’
‘Oh no - we’re much too busy at home today,’ the old girl cackled on regardless.
‘We’ve everything to prepare for Miss Bao-qin’s Giving-away. And I’ve still two pots of
lychees to deliver to Master Bao-yu from Miss Bao-chai.’
She took her leave and went waddling busily out of the room. Dai-yu, who for
Bao-chai’s sake had tried to dis?guise her annoyance at the way the old woman had
come barging in, called out after her:
‘Please thank Miss Bao-chai for her kind present.’
‘La-di-da-di-da!’ the old. girl could still be heard burb?ling away to herself. ‘Only
Bao-yu would have the style to match such a fine lady...’
Dai-yu pretended not to hear.
‘Really,’ said Aroma, trying to laugh the whole thing off, ‘when people reach her age
they just talk utter non?sense. You don’t know whether to scold or laugh.’
Snowgoose passed the lychees to Dai-yu. ‘I couldn’t; put them away, would you?’
They chatted a little longer and. then Aroma left.



That evening, when Dai-yu went into her side-room to undress for the night, she
caught sight of the lychees again. They reminded her of the old woman’s visit, and
revived the pain she had felt at her tactless gossiping. Dusk was falling, and in the
stillness a thousand gloomy thoughts seemed to close in and oppress her mind.
‘My health is so poor... And time’s running out. I know Bao-yu loves me more than
anyone else. But Gran?nie and Aunt Wang still haven’t mentioned it! If only my
parents had settled it for us while they were still alive.. But suppose they had? What
if they had married me to someone else? Who could ever compare with Bao-yu?
Perhaps I’m better off like this after all! At least I’ve still some hope.’
Like the rope on a pulley her secret hopes and fears spun up and down, tangling
themselves tighter and tighter round her heart. Finally, with a sigh and a few tears,
she lay down in her clothes, weary and depressed.
She became vaguely aware of one of the junior maids coming in and saying:
‘Miss Lin, Mr Jia Yu-cun is outside and wants to see you.’
‘What could he want?’ thought Dai-vu to herself. ‘I’m not a regular student of his.
I’m not even a boy. He just happened to coach me when I was a little girl. Anyway, all
the times he’s come to see Uncle Zheng he’s never once asked after me, so why
should I have to see him now?’
She told the maid to convey her respects and thank Mr Yu-cun for calling, but to say
that poor health obliged her to stay in bed.
‘But Miss,’ said the maid, ‘I think he’s come to con?gratulate you, and some people
have come to take you to Nanking.’
As she was speaking, a group including Xi-feng, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Bao-chai
advanced into the room and announced cheerfully:
‘Congratulations my dear! And bon voyage!’
‘What do you mean?’ asked Dai-yu in great confusion.
‘Come on now.’ It was Xi-feng who replied. ‘You needn’t try and pretend you
haven’t heard the news. Your father’s been promoted to Grain Intendant for Hupeh
Province and has made a second and highly satisfactory marriage. He doesn’t think it
right that you should be left here on your own, and has asked Yu-cun to act as
go-between. You’re engaged to be married to a relation of your new stepmother’s, a
widower himself I believe. They’ve sent some servants to fetch you home. You’ll
probably be married straight away. It’s all your step?mother’s idea. In case you’re not
properly taken care of on the voyage, she has asked your cousin Lian to accom?pany
you.’
Xi-feng’s words made Dai-yu break out in a cold sweat. She now had a feeling that
her father was still alive. She began to panic, and said defiantly:
‘It’s not true! It’s all a trick of Xi-feng’s!’
She saw Lady Xing give Lady Wang a meaningful look:
‘She won’t believe us. Come, we are wasting our time.’
‘Aunt Wang! Aunt Xing! Don’t go!’ Dai-yu begged them, fighting back her tears. But
she received no reply. They all gave her a curious smile, and then left together.
As she stood there and watched them go, panic seized her. She tried to speak, but
the only sound that came was a strangled sobbing from the back of her throat. Then
she looked about her and saw that somehow she had been transported to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment. In that same instant she thought to herself: ‘Grannie’s
the only one that can save me now!’ and fell at the old lady’s feet, hugging her by the
knees.
‘ Save me Grannie, please! I’d rather die than go away with them! That
stepmother’s not my real mother any?way. I just want to stay here with you!’
Grandmother Jia’s face only registered a cold smile.
‘This has nothing to do with me.’
‘But what’s to become of me, Grannie?’ she sobbed.
‘Being a man’s second wife has its advantages,’ Grand?mother Jia replied. ‘Think of
the double dowry you’ll have.’
‘If I stay, I won’t cause you any extra expense, I prom?ise I won’t. Oh please save
me!’
‘It’s no use,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘All girls marry and leave home. You’re a child
and don’t understand these things. You can’t live here for ever, you know.’
‘I’ll do anything to stay - I’ll work for my keep, be a slave, anything! Only please
don’t let them take me away!’ This time Grandmother Jia made no reply. Dai-yu
hugged her again and sobbed:
‘Oh Grannie! You’ve always been so good to me, fussed over me so - how can you
treat me like this in my hour of need? Don’t you care about me any more? I may not
be one of your real grandchildren, a true Jia like the others, but my mother was your
own daughter, your own flesh and blood! For her sake have pity on me! Don’t let me
be taken away!’
With these last words she flung herself frantically upon Lady Jia, burying her head in
her lap and sobbing violent?ly.
‘Faithful,’ the old lady commanded, ‘take Miss Dai-yu to her room to rest. She is
wearing me out.’
There was no mistaking the finality in Grandmother Jia’s voice. To Dai-yu, suicide now
seemed the only course. She rose, and as she walked from the room her heart
yearned for a mother of her own to turn to. All the affection shown her by
grandmother, aunts and cousins alike, had now been exposed for what it was and
had been all along - a sham. Suddenly she thought: ‘Why haven’t I seen Bao-yu today?
He might still know of a way out.’ And as the thought entered her mind, she looked
up and sure enough, there, standing right in front of her, all laughter and smiles, was
Bao-yu himself.
‘My warmest congratulations, coz!’
This was too much for Dai-yu. Her last vestige of maidenly reserve vanished. She
clutched hold of him and cried out:
‘Now I know how heartless and cruel you really are, Bao-yu!’
‘No, you are wrong,’ he replied. ‘But if you have a hus?band to go to, then we must
go our separate ways.
Dai-yu listened in despair as this, her very last hope, was taken from her. Clinging to
him helplessly, she gave a feverish cry:
‘Oh Bao! I’ve no separate way to go! How could you say such a thing!’
‘If you don’t want to go, then stay here,’ he replied calmly. ‘You were originally
engaged to me. That’s why you came to live here. Has it never occurred to you how
specially I’ve always treated you? Haven’t you noticed?’
Suddenly it all seemed clear. She really was engaged to Bao-yu after all. Of course she
was! In an instant her des?pair changed to joy.
‘My mind is made up once and for ever! But you must give me the word. Am I to go?
Or am I to stay?’
‘I’ve told you, stay here with me. If you still don’t trust me, look at my heart.’
With these words he took out a small knife and brought it down across his chest.
Blood came spurting out. Ter?rified out of her wits, Dai-yu tried to staunch the flow
with her hand, crying out:
‘How could you? You should have killed me first!’
‘Don’t worry,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m going to show you my heart.’
He fumbled about inside the gaping flesh, while Dai-yu, shaking convulsively, afraid
someone might burst in on them at any moment, pressed him to her tightly and wept
bitterly.
‘Oh no!’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s not there any more! My time has come!’
His eyes flickered and he fell with a dull thud to the floor. Dai-yu let out a piercing
scream. She heard Night?ingale calling her:
‘Miss Lin! Miss Lin! You’re having a nightmare! Wake up! Come along now, you
must get undressed and go to sleep properly.’
Dai-yu turned over in her bed. So it had all been a nightmare. But she could still feel
her throat choking, her heart was still pounding, the top of her pillow was drenched
in sweat, and a tingly, icy sensation ran down her back and chilled her to the core.
     ‘Mother and father died long ago. Bao-yu and I have never been engaged,’ she
thought to herself. ‘What ever could have made me have such a dream?’
The scenes of her dream passed before her eyes again. She was on her own in the
world, she reflected. Supposing Bao-yu really died - what then? The thought was
enough to bring back all the pain and confusion. She began to weep, and tiny beads
of sweat broke out down the length of her body. Finally she struggled up, took off
her outer robe and told Nightingale to make the bed. She lay down again, and began
turning restlessly from side to side, un?able to get to sleep. She could hear the gentle
sighing of the wind outside her window - or was it the drizzle falling softly on the roof?
Once, the sound died away and she thought she could hear someone calling in the
distance. But it was only Nightingale, who had already fallen asleep and was snoring
in a corner of the room. With a great effort, Dai-yu struggled out of bed, wrapped the
quilt around her and sat up. An icy draught from a crack in the casement soon sent
her shivering back under the covers again. She was just beginning to doze off when
the Spar?rows struck up their dawn-chorus from their nests in the bamboos. First
light was gradually beginning to show through the shutters and paper window-panes.
Dai-yu was now wide awake again and started coughing. Nightingale awoke at once.
‘Still awake, Miss? Coughing too - it sounds as if you’ve caught a chill. Why, it’s
almost light, it’ll soon be morning! Please try and stop thinking so much, and rest.
You need to sleep.’
‘I want to sleep,’ replied Dai-yu. ‘But what’s the good? I just can’t. You go back to
sleep anyway.’ These last words were interrupted by another fit of coughing.
Nightingale was already distressed at her mistress’s con?dition and had no inclination
to go back to sleep. When she heard her coughing again, she hurried over to hold up
the spittoon. By now it was dawn outside.
‘Haven’t you gone to sleep?’ asked Dai-yu.
‘Sleep?’ replied Nightingale cheerfully. ‘It’s already day-light.’
‘In that case, could you change the spittoon?’
‘Certainly Miss.’
Leaving the full spittoon on a table in the outer room, Nightingale went promptly to
fetch a fresh one, which she placed at the foot of the kang. Then, closing the door of
the inner room carefully behind her and letting down the flower-patterned portiere,
she went out to wake Snowgoose, taking the full spittoon with her. When she came
to empty it in the courtyard, and looked closer, she noticed to her horror some
specks of blood in the phlegm.
‘Goodness!’ she blurted out. ‘How awful!’
‘What’s the matter?’ Dai-yu called out at once from inside.
‘Oh nothing, Miss!’
Nightingale tried her best to cover up her blunder. ‘The spittoon slipped in my hand
and I nearly dropped it.’
‘You didn’t find anything odd in the phlegm?’
‘Oh no, Miss.’ A lump came into Nightingale’s throat, and she could say no more.
Tears came streaming down her cheeks.
Dai-yu had already noticed a sickly taste in her mouth, and her earlier suspicions
were strengthened first by Nightingale’s cry of alarm, and now by the unmistakable
note of dismay in her voice.
‘Come in,’ she told Nightingale. ‘It must be cold out?side.’
‘I’m coming, Miss.’ She sounded more disconsolate than ever. Her tragic snuffly
tone set Dai-yu shivering. The door opened and she walked in, still dabbing her eyes
with a handkerchief.
‘Come along now,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Crying so early in the morning.
‘Who’s crying?’ said Nightingale, doing her best to smile. ‘It’s so early and my eyes
are a bit itchy, that’s all. You were awake longer than ever last night, weren’t you,
Miss? I could hear you coughing half the night.’
‘I know. The more I wanted to sleep, the wider awake I became.’
‘You’re not well, Miss. I think all this worrying is ruin?ing your health. And good
health is like the hill in the proverb:
Keep the hill green, keep the hill green,
And you’ll never lack fuel for winter again.

Besides, everyone here cares for you so. Her Old Ladyship does, Her Ladyship does,
everyone does!’
How could Nightingale know that the mere mention of these homely names,
intended to reassure and comfort, was enough to conjure up again the horror of the
night?mare? Dai-yu felt her heart thumping, everything went black before her eyes,
and she seemed on the point of fainting altogether. Nightingale quickly held out the
spit?toon while Snowgoose patted her lightly on the back. After a long while she
coughed up another mouthful of phlegm. In it was a thick wriggling strand of dark
red blood. The two maids were pale with fright. They stood supporting her, one on
each side, until finally she slumped back, scarcely conscious. Nightingale, aware of
the critical nature of her condition, looked at Snowgoose and made an urgent
movement with her lips that clearly meant: ‘Go and fetch someone - quickly!’
Snowgoose was no sooner out of the door than she saw Kingfisher and Ebony
coming towards the Naiad’s House, smiling as they walked along.
‘Isn’t Miss Lin up yet?’ inquired Kingfisher cheerfully. ‘My mistress and Miss
Tan-chun are both round at Miss Xi-chun’s discussing her painting of the garden.’
Snowgoose hushed them both with a quick gesture.
‘What’s the matter?’ they asked in alarm. Snowgoose told them all that had
happened, and they shot out their tongues in horror.
‘But that’s serious! Why haven’t you been to tell Her Old Ladyship? What a terrible
thing! How could you be so silly!’
‘I was on my way when you two arrived,’ replied Snowgoose.
‘Who’s that talking outside?’ called Nightingale from the bedroom. ‘Miss
Lin wants to know.’
 The three of them went in together, to find Dai-yu lying wrapped up in bed.
‘What’s all the excitement about?’ she asked them. ‘Who’s been telling you tales?’
It was Ebony who replied:
‘Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xiang-yun have just gone over to Miss Xi-chun’s to discuss
her landscape of the gar?den, and they sent us here to ask you to join them, Miss Lin.
We’re sorry to hear that you’re not well.’
‘It’s nothing serious,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m just feeling a bit weak, that’s all. I’ll be up
when I’ve had a little rest. Will you tell Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xiang-yun that I
should like them to come here after lunch, if they’re not too busy? I don’t suppose
Master Bao’s been over there, has he?’
‘No, Miss,’ came the reply. ‘Master Bao has been going to school the last few days,’
continued Ebony, ‘and the Master tests him every day, so he doesn’t get a chance to
romp around as he used to.’
Dai-yu was silent and thoughtful. The two maids stood around for a minute or two
longer and then discreetly withdrew.
At the Lotus Pavilion, Xi-chun’s painting of Prospect Garden was being subjected to
an aesthetic appraisal by Tan-chun and Xiang-yun. Too much here, not enough there,
a little too thin in one place, too crowded in another. They were thinking of adding a
poetry inscrip?tion, and had sent to ask for Dai-yu’s advice. They were busily talking
when Kingfisher and Ebony came back, looking very flustered. Xiang-yun was the first
to ques?tion them:
‘Why hasn’t Miss Lin come with you?’
‘She had a bad relapse last night, Miss,’ replied King-fisher, ‘and was up coughing
most of the night. According to Snowgoose the phlegm it’ her spittoon was flecked
with blood.’
‘Are you sure?’ asked Tan-chun, aghast.
‘Quite sure,’ replied Kingfisher.
‘We’ve just been in to see her, Miss,’ said Ebony. ‘She looks dreadful, and hardly has
the strength to speak.’
‘If she’s as sick as that, she’s hardly likely to be able to speak,’ said Xiang-yun
bluntly.
‘What nonsense, Yun! Why if she couldn’t speak that would mean she was .......’
Tan-chun broke off in mid-sentence.
‘Dai is a clever soul,’ said Xi-chun. ‘But she does have a tendency to take everything
too seriously. If only she could see beyond it all.’
‘We must go and see how she is, anyway,’ said Tan?chun. ‘If it is serious, we’d
better tell Cousin Wan and let Grannie know, so they can send for a doctor and find
out what to do.’
Xiang-yun agreed, and she and Tan-chun set off with a couple of junior maids for the
Naiad’s House. Xi-chun said she would follow later.
The sight of the girls coming into her room gave Dai-yu a queer feeling, and set her
brooding once more over her dream. If Grandmother Jia had proved so cold in the
dream, wouldn’t Tan and Yun have been even more so? Would they even have
bothered to come and see her now, she wondered, if she had not made a point of
asking them to? Not allowing these doubts to show, she made a big effort and told
Nightingale to prop her up, murmuring to the others to sit down. Tan-chun and
Xiang-yun sat one at each end of the bed, deeply moved by the sight of Dai-?yu in
this condition.
‘What do you think is the matter, Dai?’ asked Tan-chun.
‘Oh, it’s nothing serious. I just feel so drained.’
Nightingale, who was standing on the other side of Dai?yu, secretly pointed to the
spittoon, and Xiang-yun (the younger and by nature less circumspect of the two girls)
picked it up and had a look. It was too late:
‘Ith thith yourth, Dai?’ she asked in a voice of horror. ‘How awful!’
Earlier Dai-yu had been too faint and overwrought to examine the contents of her
spittoon. But now Xiang?yun’s question reawakened her suspicions. Her heart sank
as she turned to look. Tan-chun tried to cover up for Xiang-yun:
‘That only means you’ve got some inflammation on your lungs, and have brought a
little up. It’s quite com?mon. Yun’s so pathetic the way she goes on about the
slightest thing!’
Xiang-yun blushed and wished she had never opened her mouth. Tan-chun could see
how low Dai-yu’s spirits were, and how tired she was. She rose to leave:
‘You must rest and build up your strength. We’ll leave you now and call back again
later.’
‘Thank you both for thinking of me.
‘Mind you look after Miss Lin properly now, Nighting?ale.’
‘Yes, Miss Tan-chun.’
They were about to leave, when the hushed atmosphere was rudely disturbed by a
voice shouting outside. But if you wish to learn whose voice it was, you must turn to
the next chapter.

CHAPTER 83

An Indisposition in the Imperial Bedchamber
calls for a Family Visitation
While insubordination in the inner apartments
reveals Bao-chai’s long-suffering nature
It was told in our last chapter how Dai-yu’s visitors, who were on the point of leaving,
heard a voice outside the window crying:
‘What’s a little trouble-maker like you doing here in the garden anyway? You’re
nothing but a nuisance!’
Dai-yu immediately let out a great cry:
‘I can’t stay here any longer!’
She rolled her eyes and gestured with one hand in the direction of the window.
The truth is that after all this time, despite Grand-mother Jia’s constant love and
protection, Dai-yu still suf?fered from an acute sense of insecurity, of being an
‘out?sider in the Garden’. On this occasion, incredible though it may seem, she had
instinctively taken herself to be the target of the old woman’s abuse (for the voice
was that of an old serving-woman), and had immediately set about re?constructing
the ‘plot’ in her mind: someone, taking advantage of the fact that she was an orphan,
had sent this woman to insult her in public. She was being persecuted! The sense of
injury, the unfairness of it, were more than she could bear. Another fit of sobbing left
her uncon?scious.
‘What’s the matter, Miss?’ Nightingale was in tears her?self. ‘Please wake up!’
Tan-chun also called out in an effort to rouse her, and eventually Dai-yu came round.
She could not speak, and her only explanation was another gesture towards the
window. Tan-chun understood. She opened the door and went outside, to discover
the old woman, with a stick in her hand, chasing a scruffy little maid.
‘I’m trying to get on with my gardening,’ she was grumbling. ‘You’ve no business to
be here. Just wait till we get home and I get my hands on you! I’ll learn you!’
The little girl merely cocked her head, stuck a finger in her mouth and stared at the
old woman with a cheeky grin.
‘Have you both taken leave of your senses?’ exclaimed Tan-chun severely. ‘How
dare you use language like that here?’
When the old woman saw who it was, she pulled herself up smartly and answered
with her most ingratiating smile:
‘It’s my daughter’s girl here, Miss Tan-chun. She would follow me over you see, and
I knew she’d only be a nui?sance so I was shooing her along home. Dearie me, if I’d
stopped to think where I was I’d never have dared raise my voice I’m sure.’
‘That’s quite enough,’ said Tan-chun. ‘Off you go both of you. Miss Lin is not feeling
very well today - so hurry up and go!’
‘Yes Miss! Straightaway Miss!’ The old girl bustled off and her granddaughter went
running after her.
Returning indoors, Tan-chun found Xiang-yun holding Dai-yu’s hand and crying
helplessly, while Nightingale was supporting her mistress with one hand and using
her free hand to rub her chest. Slowly the life returned to Dai-?yu’s eyes and she
looked up. Tan-chun smiled kindly:
‘Did you take offence at what that old woman said?’
Dai-yu answered with a feeble shake of the head.
‘It was her own granddaughter she was shouting at,’ Tan-chun went on to explain.
‘She told me all about it. People like her are the end. They never know when to hold
their tongue.’
Dai-yu sighed and held Tan-chun’s hand.
‘Oh Tan...’ she cried feebly, but could say no more.
‘There, you mustn’t start worrying,’ said Tan-chun. ‘We’re cousins and cousins
should stick by one another. That’s why I came to see you. Besides, I know you’re a
bit short of help. Listen, all you have to do is take your medicine like a good girl and
look on the bright side a bit, and you’ll soon start to build up your strength. And then
we can start having meetings of our poetry club again, and everything will be fine.’
‘Tan’s right,’ echoed Xiang-yun. ‘Won’t that be fun!’
‘Oh, if only you knew!’ sobbed Dai-yu. ‘I feel so weak. I don’t think I’ll ever pull
through.’
‘That’s no way to talk,’ said Tan-chun. ‘We all fall ill, we all have our troubles.
There’s no cause for you to be so pessimistic. Be sensible and have a good rest now.
Yun and I had better go over to Grannie’s. We’ll come and see you again later. If
there’s anything you need, tell Night?ingale and I’ll send it over for you.’
‘Tan, when you see Grannie, you won’t say I’m very ill, will you? Please!’ Tears were
streaming down Dai-yu’s face as she spoke. ‘Just curtsey for me and say I’m not
feeling very well but it’s nothing serious and she’s not to worry.
‘Of course. Now don’t fuss. Just rest and get better.’ Tan-chun and Xiang-yun went
on their way.



When they had gone, Nightingale settled Dai-yu down once more. She left all the
fetching and carrying to Snowgoose, and herself stayed constantly at Dai-yu’s side,
trying her best not to betray her own distress by shedding any more tears. Dai-yu
closed her eyes and lay still for a while. But sleep would not come. The garden
outside, which had always been such a haven of quiet and solitude, now seemed
alive with sounds - the wind, insects buzz?ing, birds chattering, the fall of human
footsteps, child?ren crying faintly in the distance - all of which drifted in through the
window and set her nerves on edge. She told Nightingale to let down the curtains
around her bed.
Presently Snowgoose appeared, carrying before her in both hands a bowl of Bird’s
Nest Soup, which she gave to Nightingale, who whispered through the curtains:
‘Would you like some soup, Miss?’
A faint ‘yes’ was heard from inside, and handing the soup back to Snowgoose for the
moment, Nightingale climbed up and helped Dai-yu into a comfortable sitting
position. Turning to take the bowl again, she first tasted the contents herself, then
held it carefully to Dai-yu’s lips, while supporting her firmly round the shoulder with
one arm. Dai-yu opened her eyes feebly, took a couple of sips, then showed by a
shake of her head that she could not manage any more. Nightingale handed the bowl
back to Snowgoose and gently settled her down again.
For a few minutes all was quiet and Dai-yu seemed more peaceful. Then a whisper
was heard from outside the window:
‘Is Nightingale in?’
Snowgoose hurried out. It was Aroma.
‘Come in,’ she whispered.
‘How’s Miss Lin?’ asked Aroma.
They walked together towards the doorway and Aroma listened aghast as Snowgoose
described what had hap?pened that morning and the preceding night.
‘No wonder!’ she exclaimed. ‘Kingfisher said something of the sort just now and
had Master Bao so worried that he sent me straight round to find out how she is.’
As they were talking, Nightingale lifted the portiere and beckoned to Aroma, who
tiptoed into the room:
‘Is Miss Lin asleep?’
Nightingale nodded. ‘Has Snowgoose told you?’ she added.
Aroma nodded, then frowned and said:
‘This is dreadful! Master Bao had me worried to death last night too!’
‘What do you mean?’ asked Nightingale. Aroma explained:
‘When he went to sleep in the evening he seemed perfectly all right. But in the
middle of the night he started screaming his head off, first about a pain in his heart,
and then about being stabbed by a knife - he was quite deli?rious, and didn’t quieten
down till after the dawn watch. Wouldn’t you have been scared? He’s not allowed to
go to school today, and the doctor has been sent for to pre?scribe something for
him.’
While they were talking, Dai-yu could be heard coughing again from inside the
bed-curtains, and Nightin?gale hurried over to hold up the spittoon. Dai-yu opened
her eyes feebly:
‘Who’s that you’re talking to?’
‘It’s Aroma, Miss. She’s come to ask how you are.
Aroma was already standing close by the bed. Dai-yu told Nightingale to help her up
and gestured to Aroma to sit down on the bed. Aroma perched on the edge and said
in her best bedside manner:
‘Are you sure you ought to be sitting up like this, Miss?’
‘Why not?’ replied Dai-yu. ‘Stop behaving as if it’s the end of the world, will you?
Who was that you mentioned just now, with a pain in the heart during the night?’
‘Oh that wasn’t real!’ said Aroma. ‘That was just a nightmare Master Bao had.’
‘It’s very thoughtful of Aroma,’ thought Dai-yu to herself. ‘I know she’s only trying
to stop me from wor?rying. But I must know!’ She tried again, more insistently this
time:
‘What sort of a nightmare? What did he say?’
‘Oh, he didn’t say anything,’ lied Aroma.
Dai-yu nodded pensively and fell silent for a minute or two. Then she sighed again
and said:
‘You’re none of you to mention my illness to Master Bao. It might affect his work
and cause trouble with Sir Zheng.’
‘Of course we won’t, Miss,’ Aroma reassured her. ‘Now you lie down and rest.’
Dai-yu nodded and asked Nightingale to settle her down again. Aroma stayed a little
longer by her bedside, said a few more comforting words and then left. When she
arrived back at Green Delights she reported that Dai-yu was feeling a little
uncomfortable but that her condition was not a serious one, and thereby succeeded
in setting Bao-yu’s mind at rest.



Tan-chun and Xiang-yun, on leaving the Naiad’s House, made their way together to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment. As they went, Tan-chun warned Xiang-yun:
‘When we see Grandmother, please be more careful what you say, will you?’
Xiang-yun nodded:
‘I will. I’m afraid just now I was too shocked by Dai’s state to think what I was
doing.’
They arrived at Grandmother Jia’s and Tan-chun men?tioned Dai-yu’s illness. As she
had predicted, the old lady was somewhat ruffled:
‘Dear oh dear! How illness and misfortune seem to pick on those two! Ever since
Dai-yu was a little girl, it’s been one thing after another. Now that she’s grown up, it
is time she learned to take better care of her health. She’s too highly strung, that’s
her trouble.’
No one dared say anything. She turned to Faithful:
‘The doctor’s coming in the morning to see Bao-yu. Tell them he’s to look in at Miss
Lin’s afterwards.’
‘Yes, ma’am.’
Faithful went out to tell the serving-women, who passed on the instructions.
Tan-chun and Xiang-yun stayed on at Grandmother Jia’s for dinner, and then
re?turned to the Garden together.



Next day the doctor came to see Bao-yu. He pronounced that a dietary imbalance
had brought on a slight chill, which would soon be put right by a mild dispersant.
Lady Wang and Xi-feng sent the prescription over for Grand?mother Jia to inspect,
and at the same time sent someone ahead to the Naiad’s House to let them know
the doctor was on his way. Nightingale tucked Dai-yu up in her quilt and let down the
bed-curtains, while Snowgoose quickly tidied the room.
Presently Jia Lian arrived with the doctor, announcing that as it was their regular
practitioner there was no need for the maids to disappear. An old serving-woman
raised the portiere, Jia Lian ushered the doctor into Dai-yu’s room and the two men
sat down. Jia Lian began:
‘Nightingale dear, please tell Doctor Wang what you can about your mistress’s
illness.’
‘Excuse me,’ interposed the doctor. ‘Please allow me to take her pulses and reach
my own diagnosis first. Then the young ladies may judge for themselves and correct
me if anything I say conflicts with what they already know of her condition’
Nightingale arranged Dai-yu so that one of her hands was showing through the
bed-curtains and resting on the diagnostic arm-rest, and gently slid back her bracelet
and sleeve so as not to obstruct the pulse. The doctor sat for a long while feeling the
pulses first of one hand, then of the other. When he had finished, he withdrew with
Jia Lian to the outer room, where they both sat down.
‘The six pulses have an extremely taut quality,’ said the doctor, ‘and indicate an
advanced morbid obstruction.’
As he spoke, Nightingale appeared in the doorway. He turned towards her and said:
‘This condition should manifest itself in the following ways: dizzy spells, loss of
appetite, frequent dreams, and fitful sleeping in the early hours; during the daytime
a tendency to take offence for no reason and a generally nervous and apprehensive
attitude towards other people. Some might attribute all these to a peculiarity of
tempera?ment, but they would be mistaken. They are organically related to a
deficiency of Yin in the liver, with a concom?itant diminution of cardiac vitality. Does
my diagnosis accord with what you have observed?’
Nightingale nodded, and turning to Jia Lian said: ‘That is exactly how Miss Lin has
been, sir.
‘Good,’ said Doctor Wang, rising from his chair. ‘We may proceed.’
 Jia Lian escorted him out of the Garden and across to his study, where his pages had
already laid out the re?quisite pink prescription form in readiness. Tea was served,
then Doctor Wang took up the brush and wrote:

DIAGNOSIS
The six pulses are slow and taut. Prolonged morbid obstruction of the humoral flow.
Left distal pulse weak. Diminution of cardiac vitality.
Left median pulse strong and irregular. Hyperactivity of the liver (Wood).
The hepatic humour, unable to disperse naturally, has en?croached upwards on the
spleen (Earth), with consequent loss of appetite. The extreme distemper has also
caused a reversal of the elemental sequence, and the lungs (Metal) have certainly
been damaged.
Since humour cannot circulate, it has congealed into phlegm. Upsurge and
expectoration of blood.

TREATMENT
1. Sedation of liver.
2. Restoration of lungs.
3. Fortification of both heart and spleen.
The usual tonics are too violent in their action. For the present, I suggest my own
Black Ethereal Essence, to be taken with Elixir Pneumoferriferum. Prescriptions for
both humbly appended for esteemed approval.

The doctor wrote out a prescription of seven items and an adjuvant to go with it. Jia
Lian took the paper and glanced down the list.
‘I see you include Hare’s Ear in your prescription,’ he said. ‘Forgive me if I am wrong,
but I thought that was ruled out in haematic eruptions?’
‘You must be thinking,’ replied Doctor Wang with a knowledgeable smile, ‘of its
emetic properties, which, as is well known, contra-indicate this particular herb in
cases of haemoptysis or epistaxis. But allow me to inform you that in preparation
with Turtle’s Blood (as in my prescription), Hare’s Ear constitutes the only effective
remedy we have for draining the humour of the Lesser Yang periphery of the
gall-bladder. You see, the judicious admixture of Tur?tle’s Blood has the remarkable
effect of inhibiting the eme?tic properties of Hare’s Ear, while enabling it to restore
the hepatic Yin and check the phlogistic disturbance. In the words of the Ars
Medicandi; "Obstructa obstruit, aperitque aperta." And the - at first sight -
paradoxical in?clusion of Hare’s Ear is none other than the classic stra?tagem of the
loyal counsellor befriending the usurper...'
‘I see,’ said Jia Lian, nodding appreciatively. ‘Thank you for enlightening me, Doctor
Wang.’
The doctor continued:
‘I should like the young lady to take two doses of the decoction, and then we shall
see whether to alter the pre?scription, or perhaps try a new one altogether. I have
another appointment, so I hope you’ll excuse me. I shall call again another day.’
As Jia Lian saw him out, he asked:
‘And what have you prescribed for my cousin?’
‘Oh there’s very little the matter with him. Another dose of the dispersant I have
prescribed should put him right.’
With these words Doctor Wang stepped into his carriage.
Jia Lian dispatched a servant to purchase the various drugs needed and went in to
inform Xi-feng of Dai-yu’s diagnosis. They had not been talking long when Zhou Rui’s
wife arrived to consult Xi-feng about a few trivial details of domestic management.
After listening for a while, Jia Lian rose to leave.
‘Carry on, Mrs Zhou, I must be going.’
With Jia Lian out of the room, and all remaining household business soon disposed of,
Zhou Rui’s wife was able to come to the real purpose of her visit.
‘I’ve just come from Miss Lin’s, ma’am. I don’t like the look of it at all! There’s not a
spot of colour left in her cheeks, and to touch her she’s nothing but skin and bones. I
tried asking her what the matter was, but she wouldn’t speak, just sat there crying.
Before I left, Nightingale asked if you could advance them a couple of months’
allow?ance. She said that with Miss Lin so ill, and her so proud anyway about not
being beholden to a soul for anything, she’d made bold to ask about it herself. The
medicine Miss Lin is taking goes on the general account of course, but she said they
might be needing some extra money for in?cidental expenses. I said I’d mention it to
you, ma’am.’
Xi-feng lowered her head for a moment, then replied:
‘Oh very well, I’ll send her a few taels to be going on with. There’s no need to tell
Miss Lin though. I’m against advances on principle. If one person starts we’ll never
hear the end of it. Do you remember the scene Mrs Zhao and Miss Tan-chun had
about this very question? Besides, as you know, with so many expenses and so little
coming in to pay for them, things are extremely tight at present.’
After a pause, she continued:
‘Some people are under the illusion that it’s all caused by bad management on my
part. Some even have the nerve to suggest that I am lining the Wang nest at the Jia
family’s expense. But you know better, my dear Mrs Zhou. You’ve seen far too much
of what really goes on to pay any attention to such gossip.’
‘Why I never heard such downright wicked lies in all my days, ma’am,’ said Zhou
Rui’s wife. ‘Bless my soul! Where would this great rambling household be now, I
should like to know, without you to keep everything run?ning smoothly the way you
do? I’d like to see any other lady try to take it on. Why, a grown man with six arms
and three heads would crumple under the strain of what you have to bear, for certain
sure! There’s no justice left in this world!’
Suddenly she broke into a cackle of laughter.
‘Mind you, Mrs Lian, the things people will say! The other day when Mr Zhou came
home from town, he told me how people are all talking about us, trying to guess just
how rich the family is. Take this for example: "The Jias have got rooms piled high with
silver and gold! Every stick of furniture in the house is inlaid with gold and stud?ded
with precious stones!" Or sometimes they gossip about Her Grace: "That daughter of
theirs at Court," they’ll say, "you can bet your last buckle she’s managed to smug?gle
home half the Emperor’s things. That time she went on that grand visitation, we saw
it with our own eyes - cartloads of gold and silver she brought along with her, had the
old home twinkling away like a fairy palace…And when the family laid on that big do
at the Temple (which must have cost them a fortune), they didn’t bat an eyelid!
Those lions outside the main gate are solid jade, and they’ve a golden kylin in the
garden - used to be two, till one was stolen! You’d expect the ladies to be grand of
course: but in that set-up the maids are quite as genteel and ladylike as the ladies
themselves! They never do a hand’s turn, just lounge around drinking wine, playing
music or perhaps a little chess, or doing a spot of leisurely painting now and then...
There’s never any shortage of others to do their work. All they need fuss about is
which silk gown to slip into next. If you could see the delicacies they eat or the
clothes they wear, you wouldn’t believe your eyes. And the children! So pampered, if
they were to ask for a moonbeam someone would be off to fetch it down for the
pretty little darlings to play with!" There’s even a song about us:

Moneybags Ning
And Rolling Rong
Treat their cash
Like piles of dung.
It seems so fine, But please beware! If you look too…’

Mrs Zhou broke off in mid flow. The last two lines of her song were in fact:
If you look too close, The cupboard’s bare!

She had been so carried away with her rendition that she only stopped in the nick of
time. Xi-feng could tell that the song carried a sting in its tail.
‘I know the sort of thing,’ she remarked casually. ‘But what could have given rise to
that story about the golden kylin?’
‘They must mean the little one old Abbot Zhang gave Master Bao at the Temple,’
replied Mrs Zhou. ‘He lost it and then several days later young Miss Shi found it for
him. A little thing like that is quite enough for those townfolk to spin one of their
yarns around! They’re so ridiculous, aren’t they, Mrs Lian? The only thing one can do
is laugh.’
‘ I can’t say I find it particularly funny,’ replied Xi-feng. ‘It’s actually rather
frightening. The trouble is that behind our magnificent facade things are going from
bad to worse. There’s a popular saying:

Fattest pigs make choicest bacon;
Famous men are for the taking.

And our fame has been won under false pretences any?way. Sometimes I worry a
great deal where all this will lead to.’
‘I understand your concern, ma’am,’ said Mrs Zhou. ‘But talk like that has been
going round town for over a year, in the teahouses and wineshops, in every alley-way.
It’s too late to stop it now, isn’t it?’
Xi-feng nodded. She told Patience to weigh out a few taels of silver and gave them to
Mrs Zhou.
‘Take these to Nightingale. Say it’s just a little extra from me to help out. If she
needs to make any purchases out of common funds, she mustn’t be afraid to say so.
No more talk of advances, though. I know Nightingale is a bright girl and will
understand what I mean. Tell her that when I’ve a free moment I’ll be over to see
Miss Lin.’
Zhou Rui’s wife took the money and departed to carry out these instructions.
*
No sooner had Jia Lian left Xi-feng closeted with Zhou Rui’s wife than he was
accosted by a page-boy with an ur?gent summons from his father, and was obliged to
go straight over to Jia She’s apartment.
‘I’ve just got wind of the fact that someone at Court is ill,’ Jia She explained. ‘A
senior consultant and two orderlies from the College of Physicians have been
summoned to the palace, which indicates an illness in His Majesty’s im?mediate
entourage. Tell me, have we had any news of Her Grace the past few days?’
‘None,’ replied Lian.
‘Go and ask your uncle, and check with Cousin Zhen,’ said Jia She. ‘See if they know
any more about it. If not, then send someone to inquire at the College. We must find
out what is going on.’
‘Yes, father.’
Jia Lian pursued both lines of inquiry simultaneously, dispatching one of his men to
the College, while he him-self set off in haste to find Jia Zheng.
‘Where did you hear of this?’ asked Jia Zheng, after listening to Lian’s account of
the story.
‘From father, just a minute ago.’
‘Well, you and Cousin Zhen had better go straight to the Palace and see what
information you can glean there.’
‘I have already sent someone to the College,’ replied Lian, ‘to see if there is any
news. I’ll go to the Ning side and fetch Cousin Zhen.’
He had no need to go as far as Ning-guo House, however, since Cousin Zhen was
already on his way over.
‘Yes, I’d heard the same rumour myself,’ remarked Zhen, as Lian told him the story
and the two of them walked together towards Jia Zheng’s study. ‘I was just on my
way to consult your father and Uncle Zheng about it.’
By the time they arrived, Jia Zheng’s attitude had be?come somewhat more
philosophical.
‘If it is Her Grace,’ he advised them, ‘we are sure to be informed sooner or later.’
Meanwhile Jia She had joined the gathering.
At noon, the four of them were still waiting for Jia Lian’s messenger to return with
news from the College, when one of the janitors came in to report the arrival of two
Palace Eunuchs, with an Imperial Communication for Sir She and Sir Zheng.
‘Show them in,’ ordered Jia She, and he and his brother went out to greet them at
the inner gate. They knelt Manchu-style and did homage as ‘Her Grace’s most
Hum?ble Servants’, before ushering the Imperial delegation through the gateway and
across the courtyard to the main reception-hall, where they begged them both to be
seated. One of the eunuchs rose to his feet and said:
‘ Your daughter, Her Grace the Imperial Concubine, having been somewhat
indisposed of late, it is His Maj?esty’s Pleasure that four ladies of her family should
visit the Imperial Bedchamber tomorrow. Each lady is to be per?mitted a single
maidservant in attendance. Male relatives are to proceed as far as the Inner Gate and
present their cards. They may not proceed any further but are to do homage and
await any further instructions outside the gate. Appointed time of arrival is nine a. m.,
departure to be completed by five p.m.’
Jia Zheng and Jia She and all the others present received this edict standing. When it
was concluded, they sat down once more and offered the eunuchs tea, after which
the Imperial party took its leave. The two senior brothers saw them out as far as the
main gate, and then went in to re?port to Grandmother Jia.
‘Four?’ queried the old lady. ‘Your two ladies and my?self makes three. Who can
the fourth place be for?’
There was a momentary pause. No one dared make a suggestion, and after a
moment’s reflection Grandmother Jia continued: ‘It must be meant for Feng. She
knows how to cope with any situation. Well, you menfolk go off and make your
arrangements.’
Leaving promptly, Jia She and Jia Zheng gave instruct?ions that apart from Lian and
Rong whose job it would be to stay and look after the two mansions, a full turn-out
of junior and senior clan-members was expected. Next the servants were told to fit
out four of the family’s best green court-sedans, and a dozen carriages with blue
canopies, and have them lined up before first light in the morning. The servants
hurried about their business, while the two Masters returned for a final consultation
with Lady Jia.
‘We have to be there at nine o’clock, and leave at five, Mother. It seems advisable
to retire rather earlier than usual tonight if we are to make a prompt start in the
morning. We need to allow ourselves ample time to pre?pare for court.’
‘Very well,’ replied Grandmother Jia. ‘You can go now.
The brothers withdrew, leaving Grandmother Jia with her two daughters-in-law and
Xi-feng. They talked for a while about Yuan-chun’s illness, and then after a little more
desultory chat, retired for the night.
Next morning, before dawn, maids lit the lamps in every apartment, and the ladies
sat down to their toilet. At five o’clock, when the ladies were ready and the
gentle?men had put the finishing touches to their ceremonial outfits, Steward Lin
and Lai Da came to the Inner Gate to report that the chairs and carriages were all
ready as ordered and had been drawn up outside. Jia She and Lady Xing arrived, and
the party was complete. After breakfast, which they all took together, Lady Jia led
them out, lean?ing on Xi-feng’s arm, and the household gathered round as the four
ladies, each accompanied by a single maid, walked slowly out. An advance party,
consisting of Li Gui and one other senior boy, went on horseback to make preliminary
arrangements at the Outer Gate of the Palace. Three generations of Jias stepped into
their carriages or mounted their horses. The procession fell into line and, with
retainers swelling the train, set off through the streets. Jia Lian and Jia Rong
remained behind to look after the two mansions.
The procession came to a halt under Westwall Gate, one of the outer gates of the
Forbidden City, and shortly afterwards two eunuchs emerged to announce:
‘By Imperial Dispensation! The ladies of the Jia family will now enter the Palace for
their Personal Visitation. The gentlemen may also proceed but may not enter the
Palace precincts. They will halt at the Inner Gate and do their homage from there.’
There was a cry of ‘Forward!’ from the men on the gate, and a junior eunuch guided
the four ladies’ chairs onward, while the gentlemen followed on foot at a stately pace,
leaving their servants at the Outer Gate. As they approached the Inner Gate, they
could see several elderly eunuchs sitting there, who rose to their feet as the
proces?sion arrived and announced:
‘Gentlemen of the Jia family! Halt here!’
Jia She and Jia Zheng lined their men up outside the Gate in order of senioritv, while
the ladies passed through in their chairs, halted under the Gate and dismounted. A
new escort of junior eunuchs now presented itself, and the Jia ladies, each leaning on
a maid’s arm, continued on foot through the inner precincts of the Palace, until they
saw before them the lavishly ornamented facade and brilliantly glazed roof-tiles of
the Imperial Concubine’s Bedchamber.
Two young ladies-in-waiting stepped forward to inform them that the only formality
required would be a curtsey. Expressing their humble appreciation for this favour, the
visitors approached the bed and curtseyed in turn. Yuan?chun bade them be seated,
which they did after a polite show of reluctance. She spoke first to Grandmother Jia:
‘Have you been keeping well?’
Leaning on her maid, the old lady rose shakily to her feet and replied:
‘Thanks to Your Grace’s beneficent aura I am still in good health.’
Yuan-chun went on to speak to Lady Wang and Lady Xing, who both rose to answer
in similar fashion. Then she turned to Xi-feng:
‘How are things at home?’
Xi-feng rose to her feet.
‘We manage to get by, Your Grace,’ she replied, and sat down.
‘I appreciate,’ said Yuan-chun, ‘that it has not been easy for you these past few
years.’
Xi-feng was about to rise again and reply when a lady-in-waiting entered with a lot of
official cards for Her Grace’s inspection. As she recognized the familiar names,
Yuan-chun felt a bitter pang of grief and tears began to flow down her cheeks. The
lady-in-waiting proferred a silk handkerchief, which she used to wipe away her tears,
saying:
‘I am a little better today, please tell them. And bid them wait outside.’
The Jia ladies were once more on their feet and express?ing their gratitude.
Yuan-chun’s eyes were still wet with tears.
‘Humble families are so much luckier than we are! At least they can be together!’
Lady Jia and the others were also on the brink of tears.
‘We beseech Your Grace not to be sad. Your exalted blessings have already made
themselves felt a thousandfold at home.’
‘How is Bao-yu coming along?’ asked Yuan-chun.
‘He is taking his studies more seriously now,’ replied Lady Jia. ‘His father has been
extremely strict with him, and he is turning into quite a little scholar.’
‘I am so glad to hear that.’
Yuan-chun gave orders for their luncheon to be served in the outer reception-hall,
and two ladies-in-waiting, assisted by four junior eunuchs, escorted them out. The
seating had been arranged in accordance with Jia family precedence, and the ladies
sat down to an immaculately presented meal, details of which our narrative omits.
When luncheon was over, the four ladies returned to give thanks. After further
desultory chat, they saw that it was nearly five o’clock, and anxious not to overstep
their limit, took their leave. Yuan-chun sent one of her ladies?in-waiting to
accompany them as far as the Inner Gate, where the same four eunuchs were
waiting to guide them out. Lady Jia and company stepped into their chairs and were
carried to the Outer Gate, where they were joined by Jia She and the menfolk. The
whole family returned in procession together.
The Visitation was repeated the following day and the day after, and as the
arrangements made were identical to the last detail, we need not elaborate any
further here.

Meanwhile, in the Xue household, things were going from bad to worse. Ever since
Xue Pan’s disappearance, Jin-gui had felt the lack of a sparring partner. Caltrop (Lily)
had moved out to live with Bao-chai, and the only person left within range was
Moonbeam. But since her promotion to the Master’s bed, Moonbeam had acquired a
new self?assurance, and Jin-gui soon observed that her stratagem in giving
Moonbeam to Pan had misfired. Her maid had in?deed become her strongest rival.
‘Very well,’ she thought to herself one day, when she had been drinking heavily and
was lying on her kang in a maudlin frame of mind, let’s see what she’s worth...’ A
round or two with Moonbeam might be just the seltzer she needed.
‘Come on!’ she taunted her. ‘Where’s our precious Lord and Master disappeared to,
eh? Where’s he hiding? You do know, of course, don’t you?’
‘I’ve not the least idea,’ replied Moonbeam coolly. ‘If he wouldn’t tell you, Mrs Pan,
no one else is likely to know.’
‘Spare me the "Mrs", will you!’ said Jin-gui with a malicious smile. ‘You and that Lily
think you run the place, don’t you? I can’t get near that little Miss Un?molestable,
with all her friends in high places to take care of her - all right! I won’t stick my neck
out in that direc?tion! But you’re still my maid, I don’t have to take cheek from you!
If you’re so sure of yourself, why not get on with it and strangle me? Then you and
Lily can have the field to yourselves. I’m just in your way - go on, say it!’
Moonbeam wasn’t taking this lying down. She looked Jin-gui straight in the eye:
‘Mrs Pan, you have no right to accuse me like that! When have I ever said a word
against you? Just because you can’t do anything to her, there’s no need to take it Out
on me! You’re just being a bully! You know what the real trouble is, so why pretend
you don’t?’
She burst into floods of tears and Jin-gui, who was now back in her element,
clambered fuming down from the kang and went after her. Moonbeam had learned a
thing or two in the Xia household and fought back every inch of the way. Jin-gui,
ignoring her cries and protestations of innocence, attacked her with whatever she
could lay hands on, and chairs, tables, cups and bowls were soon flying in every
direction.
Aunt Xue happened to be in Bao-chai’s room and heard the terrible racket they were
making.
‘Caltrop,’ she ordered without thinking, ‘go over and see what’s going on, will you?
Try and get them to quieten down.’
‘You can’t possibly send Caltrop,’ Bao-chai reminded her. ‘That would only make
things worse.
‘Very well then, I shall go myself,’ declared Aunt Xue.
‘I don’t think you should, Mama,’ advised Bao-chai. ‘We shall have to let them fight
it out. There’s nothing we can do, I’m afraid.’
‘What an intolerable state of affairs!’ cried Aunt Xue, and leaning on one of her
maids she set off in the direction of Jin-gui’s apartment. Bao-chai followed reluctantly
giving Caltrop strict intructions to stay behind. As they approached Jin-gui’s
apartment, they could hear the storm continuing unabated inside.
‘What’s the meaning of this?’ cried Aunt Xue. ‘Look at the state things are in! What
a disgraceful way to behave! Other people can hear what goes on, you know. Aren’t
you ashamed of what our relatives will think? Aren’t you afraid of being made a
laughing-stock?’
‘Me a laughing-stock - that’s rich!’ Jin-gui yelled from inside. ‘It’s this topsy-turvy
family of yours that’s a laughing-stock.There’s no respect, no proper order, not a
single thing right in this godforsaken dump! I was brought up differently, I can tell you!
In my home people knew their place. I’ve had as much from you family as I can take!”
‘Sister-in-law;’ pleaded Bao-chai, ‘Mother only came because she heard the two of
you fighting. If she seemed to be blaming you, and didn’t distinguish between you
and Moonbeam, it’s only because she was upset. I’m sure she didn’t mean anything
by it. Wouldn’t it be better to explain whatever it is that’s troubling you, and all of us
try to get along peaceably together? Poor Mother, we’re worrying her to death.’
‘Yes,’ added Aunt Xue, ‘before you start accusing me, kindly explain what the
trouble is.’
‘You’re such a saint, aren’t you!’ said Jin-gui, address?ing herself to Bao-chai. ‘I’m
sure a fine lady like you will marry a gentleman and live in a nice home - not like me,
stranded here, trampled under foot, taken advantage of by all and sundry! I might as
well be a widow! What a fool I am! Don’t judge me too harshly. I’m only. a poor
father-less creature that’s never been taught any better. And I’m sure you’d rather I
spared you the sordid details of what goes on in here between my husband and his
various womenfolk!’
Only the thought of what her mother must be suffering enabled Bao-chai to contain
her intense anger and shame at these words.
‘Sister-in-law,’ she pleaded, ‘please don’t say any more. No one is judging you, no
one is taking advantage of you - we never did with Lily and of course we don’t with
you.’
At this Jin-gui started whacking the side of the kang and shrieked at the top of her
voice:
‘Lily! How could I ever compare with her? I’m not worth the ground she treads on,
am I? She’s been here longer than I have, she understands you and knows how to
butter you up, and I don’t, I’m just a newcomer! I know! There’s no need to remind
me of it! But remember we can’t all be Imperial Concubines; you’d better watch’ your
step and make sure you don’t end up like me, mar?ried to a great half-baked booby,
left in the lurch for all the world to mock at!’
Aunt Xue could contain herself no longer and rose to her feet:
‘I am not just defending her because she is my daughter; she has tried her best to
make peace with you but you seem quite determined to provoke her. Whatever your
trouble is, leave the poor girl alone! If you have to punish someone, why not strangle
me instead?’
‘Please don’t you get angry too, Mama,’ begged Bao?chai. ‘We only came to try and
help. If all we’re going to do is make things worse, I honestly think we should go. Let’s
give her time to think it all over. And don’t you go causing any more trouble either!’
This last remark was addressed to Moonbeam.
And so the two of them left and returned to their own apartment. As they crossed
the courtyard, they saw one of Lady Jia’s personal maids coming out to greet them
with Caltrop.
‘Which way did you come?’ asked Aunt Xue, adding: ‘I hope Lady Jia is well.’
‘Very well, thank you ma’am,’ replied the maid. ‘Her Old Ladyship asked me to send
you her best regards, to thank you for the lychees you sent the other day, and to
congratulate Miss Qin on her engagement.’
‘How long have you been here?’ asked Bao-chai. ‘Quite a time,’ was her reply. The
colour rose in Aunt Xue’s cheeks when she realized how much the maid must have
overheard.
‘I’m afraid we’ve been having some dreadful scenes here recently,’ she said. ‘We
must be a laughing-stock over on your side.’
‘Oh ma’am, it’s nothing serious,’ said the maid. ‘Every family has its little troubles.
That’s as natural as plates clinking in a picnic-hamper. You’re worrying too much.’
She went inside with them and sat for a while before re?turning to Grandmother
Jia’s.
A moment or two later, Bao-chai was busy giving Cal?trop some instructions when
suddenly Aunt Xue cried out:
‘Ai! My chest!’
She lay down on the kang, sending Bao-chai and Cal?trop into a great state of panic.
But if you wish to know the outcome, you must turn to the next chapter.




CHAPTER 84



Bao-yu is given an impromptu examination,
and his betrothal is discussed for the first time
Jia Huan visits a convulsive child,
and old hostilities are resumed



Bao-chai diagnosed her mother’s sudden pain as an up?ward movement of humour
from the liver into the chest, brought on by the recent scene with Jin-gui. Without
waiting for a doctor, she sent a servant out instantly to buy a few drams of Woody
Vine Hooks, and made a strong brew for Aunt Xue to drink. Then Caltrop helped
administer a leg-pummelling and chest-massage. The pain eased a little; but Aunt
Xue’s anger at Jin-gui’s outrageous behaviour, and her distress that Bao-chai should
have had to submit to such humiliation, continued unabated.
Eventually, after another dose of daughterly reasoning, she fell asleep, and the
humour was given a chance to sub?side.
‘Now please don’t worry any more, Mama,’ pleaded Bao-chai, when she awoke. ‘In
a day or two, when you feel up to it, why not go over and see Lady Jia and Aunt Wang?
It would do you a world of good. Caltrop and I can take care of things here while
you’re away. And I’m sure there will be no more trouble from her.’
Aunt Xue nodded.
‘Perhaps I will in a couple of days.’
*

The news finally arrived that Yuan-chun had recovered, and everyone in the Jia family
was greatly relieved. A day or two later a party of eunuchs arrived from the palace
with a consignment of presents and parcels of money. They announced that it was
Her Grace’s wish to reward the family for the diligence they had shown in visiting her
during her Indisposition. The eunuchs handed over the carefully labelled gifts one by
one. Jia She, Jia Zheng and the other menfolk went in to report to Grandmother Jia,
and then all returned to express their thanks for the lar?gesse. When the eunuchs
had drunk their tea and gone, there was a family gathering in Grandmother Jia’s
apartment. After a few minutes, while they were still chatting, an old serving-woman
came in with a message:
‘The pages have reported that there’s a visitor at the other side on important
business for Sir She, milady.’
With Grandmother Jia’s permission, Jia She left to see to his own affairs. When he
had gone, she suddenly thought of something and her face lit up with a smile.
‘It’s so touching,’ she said, turning to Jia Zheng, ‘the way Her Grace remembers
Bao-yu! The other day she made a point of asking about him.’
‘Her solicitude,’ replied Jia Zheng with a sarcastic smile, ‘is as generous as it is
undeserved. Increasing idle?ness is the only fruit that young tree will ever bear.’
‘But I gave him a glowing report!’ protested Grand?mother Jia. ‘I said how well he
was doing at his composi?tions.’
‘I only wish it were the truth,’ said Jia Zheng with a crushing smile.
‘But you and your friends are always asking him to write verses and things for you -
I’m sure he’s making progress, whatever you say. He’s still young, be patient with him.
"A single spoonful never made a bouncing babe," as the saying goes.’
Jia Zheng affected a dutiful smile.
‘Yes, Mother.’
‘Which brings me,’ the old lady continued, ‘to the other thing I want to talk about.
Now that Bao-yu is growing up, it’s time you and his mother started thinking
seriously of choosing a nice wife for him. Marriage is going to be a most important
step in his life. We needn’t worry too much how, closely related to us she is, or how
much money they’ve got; but we must be sure that she’s sweet-natured, and a pretty
sort of girl.’
‘Thank you for reminding me, Mother,’ replied Jia Zheng rather stiffly. ‘But although
of course I appreciate the importance of choosing a suitable bride, the first step, as I
see it, must lie with Bao-yu himself. Without a marked improvement on his part, any
alliance we might hope to arrange would be doomed, and would certainly be a
regrettable error for the young lady concerned. His pre?sent shiftless attitude can
only spell matrimonial disaster.’
His response did not please Grandmother Jia.
‘I know that it’s your decision!’ she replied testily, ‘and that I’m an interfering old
busybody! But let me say just this: even if I did rather spoil him when he was little,
and even if he isn’t quite as grown-up and responsible as you think he ought to be, I
still think he has always been a nice, well-mannered, honest boy. I think you’re quite
wrong to treat him as a ne’er-do-well, or as some sort of threat to a young girl’s
happiness. He’s not like that at all. Oh perhaps I am prejudiced! He’s preferable to
young Huan, anyway. Or would you like to correct me there as well?’
Jia Zheng was by now feeling extremely uncomfortable. ‘You are of course by far the
more experienced judge of character, Mother,’ he replied swiftly. ‘You may be right in
thinking that fate has favoured him. Perhaps it is my own - how shall I put it. -
impatience to detect a sense of purpose in the lad that has made of me a crabbed old
father, and of Bao-yu the - eh - "crab-apple of my eye"?’
The labour required on his part in the manufacture of this sparkling piece of verbal
merriment did not quite nul?lify its object, viz. the humouring of the old lady, and
she smiled, whereupon the other ladies contributed a polite round of laughter.
‘Yes,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘and don’t forget how much older you are. It’s that and
your experience as a civil servant that have made you so mellow and wise.
She turned to Lady Xing and Lady Wang with a for?midable glance and went on
mischievously:
‘If you could have seen him when he was a boy! He was quite impossible! Far
worse than Bao-yu! It was only mar?riage that taught him a thing or two about life.
And now he won’t stop complaining about poor Bao. If anything, the boy is more
mature for his age than his father was.’
The ladies thought this assault on the bastion of Jia Zheng’s’ dignity a great joke, and
started laughing and calling Grandmother Jia a tease. Then the junior maids came in
and informed Faithful that lunch was ready to be served.
‘Speak up!’ called out Grandmother Jia, her good humour quite restored. ‘Let me in
on the secret!’
Faithful smiled and passed on the message.
‘Well in that case,’ ‘said Grandmother Jia, ‘everyone can go home for lunch, except
Feng and Cousin Zhen’s wife. I’d like them to stay and keep me company.’
Jia Zheng, Lady Wang and Lady Xing waited until lunch was served and then, after a
few more prods from the old lady, they left and went their separate ways.



On their return, Jia Zheng, in the course of conversation with Lady Wang, brought up
the subject of his recent contretemps with Grandmother Jia:
‘How Mother idolizes that boy! If only he can do well enough to scrape through his
exam, then she will’ have something to feel proud of, a return for all her love, and he
will have something to offer in the event of his mar?riage.’
‘How true!’ concurred Lady Wang.
Jia Zheng sent a maid out at once with the following orders for Li Gui:
‘Tell Bao-yu I wish to see him this evening. Instead of coming to see me after school,
he is to have his dinner first and come straight to my study afterwards. There are
some questions I wish to put to him.’
Li Gui intercepted Bao-yu on his way home from school that afternoon, just as he was
about to go in and pay his respects to his father. Bao-yu seemed thunder?struck by
the ominous summons; he went to see Grand-mother Jia, hurried back to Green
Delights, ate a scanty meal, quickly rinsed his mouth and set off again for his father’s
apartment.
Jia Zheng was waiting for him in the inner study. Bao?yu entered, made his bow and
stood attentively to one side.
‘As you know,’ Jia Zheng began, ‘I have been rather preoccupied recently and have
not had an opportunity to question you on the progress of your studies. Let me see, I
recall that the Preceptor had set you a month for revi?sion, after which time he was
to give you your Maiden Theme. That must have been at least two months ago. You
should have made a start by now, I think.’
‘I have, sir,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘I have written three com?positions. I have been waiting
for my work to improve before venturing to trouble you with any specimens of it.
Those were the Preceptor’s instructions, sir.’
‘What were your first three Themes?’
‘The first was from Analects, sir, Book Two,’ replied Bao-yu. "‘Annos Quindecim
natus: The Sage Bent upon Learning in his Fifteenth Year." The second was also from
Analects, Book One: "Obscuritatem Ae quo Animo Toler?atam: Lack of Acclaim Borne
with Equanimity." And the third was from Mencius, Book Three, Part Two: "Tunc
Accedunt Micium: They Succumb to the Mician Heresy."‘
‘And have you kept your draft versions?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘I have fair copies of all three, sir, with the Preceptor’s emendations.’
‘Are they at home, or in the schoolroom?’
‘In the schoolroom, sir.’
‘Then have someone go and fetch them at once. I should like to see them.’
Bao-yu sent an ‘express’ message through to Tealeaf:
‘Go to the schoolroom; in the drawer of my desk is a thin bamboo-paper copybook
with Tasks written on the cover. Bring it here, quickly!’
In a short while Tealeaf returned with the book, which he handed to Bao-yu who
presented it to his father. Jia Zheng opened it at the first page and began reading the
first of the eight ‘legs’ of Bao-yu’s Maiden Task.

AMPLICATIO PRIMA

THEMA: ANNOS QUINDECIM NATUS CRUS PRIMUM: APERTURA

Sapiens perfectusque Vir
a puero quidem
se ad Philosophiam applicavit.

Jia Zheng glanced at the emendation and asked Bao-yu to construe his Apertura
orally. Bao-yu began:
‘The Sage, while still a boy... forsooth... was wholly Bent upon Learning.’
Jia Zheng looked up.
‘Your use of puer betrays an inadequate comprehension of the Theme. I see the
Preceptor has substituted the annos quindecim natus of the original. Good. Pueritia,
you see, covers the whole span of boyhood up to and includ?ing the age of sixteen,
whereas here the Sage is alluding to specific milestones in his own life. We must echo
the numbers he uses, if we are to preserve the correct sequence of his moral and
intellectual development.’
Jia Zheng continued with the second ‘leg’.

CRUS SECUNDUM: CONTINUATIO

Tantam autem Applicationem
Rarissimam esse confiteor.
‘And what,’ he asked with a shake of the head, ‘do you mean by this?’
‘That the Sage’s application,’ replied Bao-yu, ‘is a thing ordinary mortals scarcely
ever achieve.’
‘Childish nonsense, my boy! It only shows what a crea?ture of indolence you are. I
am glad to see that the Precep?tor has rewritten the entire Continuatio for you.
Kindly construe, from "omnibus enim".’
Bao-yu obliged:
‘For many are those who aspire to Learning. But how few alas possess the
application necessary for the fulfil?ment of this Aspiration. Does not the Sage’s
achievement testify to the strength of his Moral Convictions in his Fif?teenth Year?’
‘I thank you. I trust you understand the emendation?’
‘Yes sir.
Jia Zheng passed on to the second Theme (It may be helpful at this point to provide
some idea of the pedagogic principles that guided Dai-ru in his selection of Themes
for his young pupil. His plan was roughly speaking as follows: First Theme - reiterate
need for Youthful Zeal. Second Theme - clarify point raised during second day’s oral
exegesis, viz. Worldly Success versus Moral Achievement. Third Theme - Orthodoxy
versus Heresy.): ‘Lack of Acclaim Borne with Equanimity.’ Jia Zheng read the
Pre?ceptor’s emended version, translating to himself as he went along:
‘If a man is able to view Worldly Acclaim with Equanimity, nothing can affect his
Pleasure and Delight’.
He screwed up his eyes to decipher Bao-yu’s original:
‘What’s all this? "Equanimity is the Essence of Scho?larship." You have completely
failed to treat the first ele?ment in your Theme, Obscuritas, and have embarked
pre?maturely on a discussion of Nobilitas which should be kept for a later section.
Your Preceptor’s emendation shows a correct Dispositio. I hope you notice the way in
which he uses Amoenitatem Dclectationemque Animi to allude to the passage in
Analects immediately preceding the rubric? Do you recall? Nonne quidem amoenum?
Nonne quidem delectabile? You must study this sort of thing carefully.’
‘Yes sir.
Jia Zheng went on to read Bao-yu’s Continuatio. There was another reference here to
the Essence of Scholarship, which had once again been emended by the Preceptor to
Pleasure and Delight.
‘The same fault as in your Apertura,’ commented Jia Zheng. ‘The emendation is
tolerable. Not particularly stylish, but clear.’
He moved on to the third and last Theme: ‘The Mician Heresy’. As he recollected the
provenance of the quota?tion, he looked up in surprise and after a moment’s
thought asked Bao-yu:
‘Have you reached this far in Mencius?’
‘Yes sir,’ Bao-yu hastened to assure him. ‘The Preceptor decided to go through
Mencius with me first, as it is the easiest of the Four Books. We finished the whole of
Men?cius three days ago, and now we are doing Analects Part One.’
Jia Zheng continued reading. By the time Bao-yu had come to write this third
composition, he had more or less mastered the ‘ignoble art of the Octopartite’, and
had learned to handle the necessary rhetorical constructions with a certain glib
dexterity. Jia Zheng studied the first two ‘legs’, and observed that in this case the
Preceptor had paid the young essayist the compliment of a total suspen?sion of the
corrective brush. The Apertura lamented the fact that those who rejected the
Hedonist Doctrine of Yanxius (Yanxianam il/am Voluptatis Doctrinam) were still
unable to find the True Path of Confucian Orthodoxy (Orthodoxiae Confucianae
Veram Viam), but were instead blindly drawn into the fold of that prevalent (and
deplor?able) Mician Heresy of Universal Love (Micianam illam Caritatis Universae
Heterodoxiam).
‘Nicely put,’ Jia Zheng commented, and continued reading. A little further on he
paused. ‘Tell me,’ he asked, evidently impressed by what he read, ‘did you write this
unaided?’
‘Yes sir.
He nodded pensively.
‘Nothing brilliant about it of course, but for a first attempt not at all bad, I must say.
Ah, Mencius! I recall how during my tour of duty as an examiner I had occasion to set
as one of my Themes "Soli Nobilitatis Sapientiaeque Alumni suntpotis". All the
first-degree candidates, I regret to say, had their heads crammed full of the standard
com?positions on the Theme, and not a single one of them could come up with
anything original. All plagiarisms. Are you familiar with the quotation?’
‘Yes sir. Mencius, Book One, Part Two: "Only Good Breeding and a Heritage of
Culture have the power to sus?tain a man in the face of Adversity"
‘Good,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘I should like you to show me what you can do.
Something of your own, please, not another feat of memorization. An Apertura will
do.’
Bao-yu lowered his head in concentration and began racking his brains for a pithy
opening phrase, while Jia Zheng stood thoughtfully in the doorway, hands clasped
behind his back. Just at that moment, a diminutive page?boy went flashing past. As
he caught sight of the Master in the doorway, he froze, his body slightly inclined, his
arms hanging limp at his side.
‘What is your errand, boy?’ asked Jia Zheng brusquely.
‘Please, sir, Mrs Xue has just arrived at Her Old Ladyship’s and Mrs Lian has sent me
with special instruc?tions to the kitchen, sir,’ jabbered the unfortunate boy. Jia Zheng
made no reply, and he fled.
Now Bao-yu assumed that if Aunt Xue had come over for a visit, then Bao-chai
(whom he had greatly missed since her departure from the Garden) was sure to have
come with her. His excitement at the thought of seeing her again spurred him on.
‘Sir,’ he ventured, ‘I have a draft Apertura for your approval.’
‘Go ahead.’
Bao-yu intoned his opening sentence:
‘Non omnes Sapientiae Alumni sunt, neque possunt ca?rere Stabili Patrimonjo.’
Jia Zheng nodded.
‘Thank you. That will do for today. In future, please bear in mind these two Golden
Rules for Composition. Before raising your brush, always be certain of the sequence
of your Dispositio and the clarity of your Inventio. Tell me, was your grandmother
aware that I sent for you?’
‘Yes sir.’
‘Off you go then. You had better go over and see her now.
‘Sir!’
Bao-yu manoeuvred his way backwards out of the study and set off along the
covered way, imitating to perfection the scholar’s leisurely gait. As soon as he
reached the moon-gate, however, and had placed its large protective screen between
himself and the study, he broke into a run and raced ahead towards Grandmother
Jia’s apartment.
‘Careful you don’t trip!’ Tealeaf shouted after him. ‘The Master’s coming.’
Bao-yu was much too excited to pay any attention. As he neared the entrance to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment, he could hear the sounds of conversation and laughter
coming from within. He could make out, among others, the voices of Lady Wang,
Xi-feng and Tan-chun.
When the maids saw him coming, they quickly drew aside the portiere and
whispered in his ear as he passed through:
‘Mrs Xue is here, you know.’
Bao-yu hurried in to greet his aunt, and then paid his respects to Grandmother Jia.
He gave her a full account of his interview with Jia Zheng, and her face radiated pride
and delight.
‘Where’s Cousin Chai?’ he asked, turning to the assem?bled company.
‘She couldn’t come with me today,’ said Aunt Xue, with a rather unconvincing smile.
‘She and Caltrop have a lot of sewing to catch up on at home.’
Bao-yu was very disappointed, and only a sense of duty kept him from leaving at
once. Dinner was served and Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue sat up at the table of
hon?our, while Tan-chun and the others took their places down below.
‘Where will Bao-yu be sitting?’ asked Aunt Xue.
‘Up here with me,’ said Grandmother Jia with a smile.
‘Li Gui told me to have my dinner before seeing Father,’ Bao-yu hastily informed her.
‘So I asked for a quick meal when I got in from school. I had a dish of something and a
bowl of rice steeped in tea. You all go ahead, please.’
‘In that case,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘Feng can come and sit with us. Your mother
says it’s one of her vegeta?rian days today, so she can eat alone.’
‘That’s right,’ said Lady Wang to Xi-feng. ‘You eat with them. Don’t wait for me. I
shall be having my vegetables at home.’
Xi-feng politely took her seat and the maids put out the wine cups and chopsticks.
Then Xi-feng went round with the wine kettle, and, when everyone’s cup was filled,
re?turned to her seat.
After they had all had a drink of wine, Grandmother Jia asked Aunt Xue:
‘Didn’t I hear you say Caltrop just then? That’s funny. One of my maids was talking
only the other day about someone called Lily, and I couldn’t for the life of me think
who she meant. When I asked her, she told me it was Caltrop’s new name. Do tell me
what she wants to go and change her name for?’
The colour rose in Aunt Xue’s cheeks and she sighed:
‘Please don’t ever mention it again. Since the day Pan married that wretched wife
we haven’t had a moment’s peace. The bickering, the nastiness, it’s been too awful.
I’ve tried talking to her several times, but she is quite im?pervious to reason. And I
can’t bear quarrelling with them all the time, so I just end up trying to turn a blind
eye. Yes, she decided to change Caltrop’s name because she said she didn’t like it.’
‘Oh well,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘what’s in a name when all’s said and done?"
‘I shall die for shame!’ cried Aunt Xue. ‘I’m sure all of you know the real reason. It
wasn’t the name. It was the fact that Bao-chai had thought of it in the first place.
That’s what she really objected to.’
‘What do you mean?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
Aunt Xue had been dabbing at her eyes all the while with her handkerchief. She
heaved another deep sigh be?fore she was able to continue.
‘Surely you must know? Every single thing my daugh?ter-in-law does is aimed at
provoking Bao-chai. She won’t leave her alone. The other day, when you sent
someone round to see me, we were in the middle of one of our scenes!’
‘That must have been the day I heard you had a little bit of a liver upset,’ said
Grandmother Jia tactfully. ‘I was going to send someone over to see how you were,
but then I heard that you were feeling better so I thought no more about it. You
should take my advice, dear, and stop worrying. They’re a newly married couple and
you must give them time to settle down. And you’re so lucky to have Chai. She is
such a gentle, unflappable girl. She may be young, but my word, she has the aplomb
of someone twice her age! When my maid came back and told us what had
happened that day; and the way she coped with it, we were all singing her praises.
Such a wonderful disposition! She’s a girl in a million. When she gets married, if you
don’t mind my saying so, her mother-in-law will take her to her bosom and the whole
household will be devoted to her, I am certain of it.’
Earlier, Bao-yu had found the general tenor of the conversation rather distasteful,
and was just saying some?thing about having to leave when his grandmother
embarked upon this eulogy of Bao-chai, and he found himself listening with rapt
attention.
‘What’s the use?’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Whatever her qual?ities, she is still only a
daughter. With a son as hopeless as Pan, I can have no peace; I never stop worrying
in case he has gone off to one of his haunts, had too much to drink again and landed
himself in another brawl. In fact the only time I ever feel at all reassured is when he’s
over here with his cousins Zhen and Lian.’
At this, Bao-yu chirped up:
‘There’s really nothing to fear, Auntie. I can vouch for Cousin Pan’s friends. They are
all serious businessmen and far too respectable to get into trouble.’
‘In that case,’ said Aunt Xue with a smile, ‘perhaps I shouldn’t worry.’
Supper was over by now, and Bao-yu excused himself, saying he still had some
preparation to do that evening. The maids were serving tea, when Amber came into
the room and whispered something in Grandmother Jia’s ear. She turned to Xi-feng:
‘You’d better go quickly, my dear. It’s Qiao-jie.’
Xi-feng had no idea what the matter could be and the others were as puzzled as she
was.
‘Patience sent one of the younger maids round with a message for you, Mrs Lian,’
explained Amber, crossing over to where Xi-feng sat. ‘Miss Qiao-jie does not seem at
all well and would you please go over as soon as possible.’
‘You’d better go straight away,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You don’t have to stand on
ceremony for your Aunt Xue.’
‘Yes Grannie,’ said Xi-feng, and she took her leave of Aunt Xue. As she was on her
way out she heard Lady Wang say:
‘You go ahead. I’ll be along shortly. Tell the maids to be quiet and not to make a lot
of fuss. Little ones get so
easily unsettled. And make sure that kitten and puppy are kept well out of the way.
Poor child! I suppose little up?sets are to be expected in a family as greatly blessed as
ours.
Xi-feng promised Lady Wang to carry out her instruc?tions and left with her maid.
After her departure, Aunt Xue went on to inquire after Dai-yu’s health.
‘Miss Lin is all right,’ replied Grandmother Jia. ‘She just takes everything too
seriously. That’s what is under?mining her health, if you ask me. She may be as clever
as Bao-chai, but she lacks your daughter’s easy way with people. Chai is so
responsible and considerate.’
The conversation continued a little longer, and then Aunt Xue said she must be going.
‘I’ll leave you in peace now. I’d better see how Chai and Caltrop are getting on at
home. I’ll go along with Aunt Wang and have a look at Qiao-jie on my way.
‘What a good idea,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘With your experience you will be able to
give them some helpful advice, I’m sure.’
Aunt Xue took her leave and went with Aunt Wang to Xi-feng’s apartment.
To return to Jia Zheng: he had been pleasantly sur?prised by Bao-yu’s performance
that evening, and men?tioned it later in the course of conversation with his liter?ary
friends in the outer study. A newcomer among them, an excellent Go-player by the
name of Wang Er-tiao (also called Go-between Wang), remarked:
‘I think we have all noticed a marked progress in Master Bao, sir. He is becoming
quite a cultured young fellow.’
‘I hardly think so,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘His powers of comprehension have improved,
I grant you. But culture? No, he has a long way to go yet.’
‘Come come, Sir Zheng!’ said Zhan Guang. ‘You are being too modest. Friend
Wang’s opinion is one we all share. Master Bao will surely go far.’
‘I’m afraid you are allowing your partiality for the boy to sway your judgement,’ was
their patron’s reply, but he was visibly pleased.
‘With your leave, sir,’ continued Wang, ‘there is another matter in this connection
that I should like to broach if I
may.’
‘By all means.’
Wang gave a smarmy smile.
‘An acquaintance of mine, Excellency Zhang, who used to be Taotai of the Nanshao
Circuit, has a daughter, sir, a
most attractive, industrious and generally commendable child, so I am told, and as
yet unbetrothed.. Excellency Zhang has no sons of his own and is, I should add, a man
of enormous wealth. He is most particular in this matter, and stipulates that his
son-in-law must come from an emi?nent and prosperous family, and must be a
young man of distinguished character himself. In the two months I have been here,
sir, I have become aware of the moral and in?tellectual calibre of young Master Bao,
the promise of great things to come. If the proposal were known to come from a
family as illustrious as your own, sir, it would I am sure need but a single visit from
me for the betrothal to be as good as settled.’
‘It is true that Bao-yu has reached a marriageable age,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘Lady Jia
has reminded me of it more than once. But who is this Excellency Zhang? I’m afraid I
don’t know him.’
‘Allow me to clarify, if I may,’ ventured Zhan. ‘I am acquainted with the Zhang
family friend Wang refers to. They are related to Sir She’s family, in point of fact, and
it should be easy enough to elicit more information trom them.’
‘Really?’ said Jia Zheng thoughtfully.. ‘I can’t say I have ever heard the name of any
such relation mentioned at my brother’s.’
‘Well, strictly speaking, sir,’ explained Zhan, ‘they are related by marriage to Lady
Xing’s elder brother.’
‘So, that’s where the relationship lies,’ thought Jia Zheng.
A little later he went in, with the intention of talking this new proposal over with
Lady Wang and asking her to sound out Lady Xing about the Zhang family. He found,
however, that his wife was out, visiting Qiao-jie with Aunt Xue. At lighting-up time,
when Aunt Xue went home and Lady Wang returned, Jia Zheng discussed the
proposal with her. He also asked after Qiao-jie.
‘We~ think it’s convulsions,’ she said.
‘Nothing serious, I hope?’
‘It’s too early to tell. The fits have still not passed.’
Jia Zheng sighed but said no more, and they retired for the night.
*
Next day, when Lady Xing came to pay her morning respects to Grandmother Jia,
Lady Wang mentioned the marriage proposal and took the opportunity of asking
Lady Xing about the Zhang family.
‘Yes, they are relations of ours,’ divulged Lady Xing. ‘But we’ve had no contact with
them for years now, so I’ve no notion what this Miss Zhang is like. Now that you
mention it, Ying’s mother-in-law, Mrs Sun, sent one of her women to call on me a day
or two ago, and she mentioned the Zhangs. She told me they had a daughter and had
asked the Suns to look out for a suitable husband for her. Apparently she is an only
child and rather delicate. She has had a little education and sounds a quiet, shy sort
of girl, used to staying at home. As she is an only child, her father won’t contemplate
her leaving home. He is afraid the severity of a mother-in-law might be too much of a
strain for her and insists on her husband coming to live with them and taking on his
share of their family respon?sibilities.’
‘Out of the question!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘Bao-yu is difficult enough for us
to look after as it is. Can you imagine sending him out to be the head of some strange
family?’
‘You are absolutely right of course,’ said Lady Xing.
Grandmother Jia turned to Lady Wang.
‘Be sure to tell Zheng when you go home that I say this match is definitely off.’
‘Yes Mother.’
‘Tell me,’ the old lady continued, ‘how was Qiao-jie when you went to see her
yesterday? Patience gave me the impression earlier on that it was something serious.
I should like to go and see her myself.’
The two ladies thanked Grandmother Jia for the kind thought, but begged her not to
trouble herself for Qiao-jie’s sake.
‘It’s not only for her sake. It’s the exercise. I’d like to stretch my legs a bit,’ said the
old lady. ‘You two have your lunch and then we can all go over together.’
Lady Wang and Lady Xing went home for lunch. Afterwards they collected
Grandmother Jia and escorted her to Xi-feng’s apartment. Xi-feng greeted them at
the door and conducted them inside.
‘How is she?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
‘It seems to be an attack of convulsions,’ Xi-feng in?formed her.
‘Hadn’t you better call the doctor straight away?’
‘We already have, Grannie dear.’
Grandmother Jia went in with Lady Wang and Lady Xing and found Qiao-jie in the
arms of her nurse, wrap?ped in a little padded quilt of pink damask-silk, her face
deathly white, her eyebrows and nostrils quivering slight?ly.After a brief inspection,
they withdrew to the outer room, and sat down to talk. Presently a junior maid from
Lady Wang’s apartment came in with a message for Xi-feng:
‘The Master has sent to inquire how Qiao-jie is, Mrs Lian.’
‘Tell him we have sent for the doctor,’ replied Xi-feng, ‘and that I will report as soon
as he has made out his pre?scription.’
The maid’s arrival reminded Grandmother Jia of the re?cently aired marriage
proposal. She turned to Lady Wang:
‘You ought to go and tell Zheng straight away about that business, dear. If we put a
stop to it now, before someone talks to the Zhang family, we will save ourselves the
trouble of having to say no to them later.’
She turned to Lady Xing.
‘Why is it you haven’t seen much of the Zhangs lately, anyway?’
‘As a matter of fact,’ replied Lady Xing, ‘they’re very mean and not the right sort of
family for us at all. It would have been a needless humiliation for Bao-yu.’
‘That must be Bao-yu’s betrothal you are talking about, Mother?’ said Xi-feng, who
had already formed a shrewd idea of what was going on.
‘Why yes, we are actually,’ said Lady Xing.
Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng about the Zhang pro?posal. Xi-feng laughed:
‘I hope you’ll excuse me, Grannie, Mother, Auntie Wang, for speaking out of turn,
but what need is there to go looking for a wife for Bao-yu, when we have a
"pre?destined affinity" here before our very eyes?’
‘What do you ‘mean?’ asked Grandmother Jia, intrigued.
‘Surely, Grannie, you can’t have forgotten Bao’s Magic Jade and Chai’s Golden
Locket?’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘Of course! But why on earth didn’t you mention it while Aunt Xue was here
yesterday?’
‘It would hardly have been right for me to speak up in the presence of my elders
and betters,’ replied Xi-feng. ‘Besides, Aunt Xue had come on a social call and it
would have been out of place. If we are to do the thing
properly, Mother and Aunt Wang must go over and ask Aunt Xue formally for
Bao-chai’s hand.’
They all laughed at her.
‘Bless you, Fengie,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I really must be going gaga.’
         113
Meanwhile the doctor was announced and Grand?mother Jia took a seat in the outer
room, while the two ladies discreetly withdrew. The doctor entered with Jia Lian and
paid his respects to Grandmother Jia before pro?ceeding into Qiao-jie’s room. When
he returned, he bowed to Grandmother Jia and pronounced his diagnosis.
‘The little girl is suffering from a convulsive attack com?plicated by an internal fever.
She must first take a single dose of a combined anti-spasmodic and expectorant, and
then I want you to give her a course of Four Prodigies Powders. It is quite a serious
attack.
‘You will notice Cow’s Bezoar-stone in my prescrip?tion. I should mention that a lot
of the Bezoars sold by the apothecaries nowadays are not genuine. It is important
that you procure the real thing.’
Grandmother Jia thanked him for coming, and the doc?tor went out with Jia Lian,
wrote out his prescription and left.
‘There’s always Ginseng in the house,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but I don’t think we’ve any
Bezoar. We’ll have to buy some and make sure it’s genuine.’
‘Wait until I’ve sent someone round to my sister’s,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I know Pan has
often done business with merchants from overseas. They might easily have some real
Bezoar.’
As she was speaking, several of the girls arrived to see Qiao-jie. They stayed for a
short while, and then left with Grandmother Jia and the others.
Qiao-jie’s expectorant was now prepared and poured down her throat. There was a
retching sound and up it came, medicine, phlegm and all, much to Xi-feng’s relief.
One of Lady Wang’s junior maids arrived with a little red paper packet.
‘We found some Bezoar, ma’am. Her Ladyship says you’re to weigh Out the correct
amount and take as much as you need.’
Xi-feng asked the maid to convey her thanks to Lady
Wang, took the package and told Patience to mix Pulve?rized Pearl, Baros Camphor
and Cinnabar in the pre?scribed proportions and bring them to the boil. She herself
weighed out the correct amount of powdered Bezoar on the scales and added it to
the mixture. She waited for Qiao-jie to wake again before administering the potion.
Who should lift the door-blind and walk in at this very moment but Jia Huan.
‘How’s Qiao-jie, Cousin Feng? Mother sent me to inquire.’
The sight of either Aunt Zhao or her son invariably made. Xi-feng’s hackles rise.
‘She’s a little better,’ she replied in rather a caustic tone. ‘When you go back, please
tell your mother I’m sorry to have caused her so much trouble.’
Jia Huan mumbled something about going, but started nosing round the room.
‘I say,’ he said after a while. ‘I heard you had some of that Bezoar stuff in here. I’ve
never seen any before. Let’s have a look.’
‘Qiao-jie is only just on the mend,’ said Xi-feng, ‘so do you mind not crashing
around in here? The Bezoar has all been used for her potion anyway.
Hearing this, Jia Huan reached out clumsily for the chafing-skillet to have a look. He
lost his grip, and there was a great hiss as the skillet tipped over and the precious
medicine spilled into the brazier, half extinguishing the fire. Jia Huan could see he
was in for trouble and beat a hasty retreat. Xi-feng was so furious she seemed to emit
sparks of rage.
‘You vile harpy’s brat!’ she screamed after him. ‘Bane of my life! What can I have
done in a past life to deserve such spite? Your mother tried to do me in, now it’s
Qiao-jie’s turn! How many generations must this feud go on for?’
Patience had her share of the blame too, for not being more careful. While Xi-feng
was in full spate, a maid came in to fetch Jia Huan home.
‘Go and tell Mrs Zhao,’ ordered Xi-feng, ‘that she is putting herself to too much
trouble. Qiao-jie is as good as dead already, so she needn’t go to such lengths!’
The maid, nonplussed by Xi-feng’s remarks, went over to Patience, who was busy
mixing up another dose of medicine, and asked her in a whisper:
‘What’s made Mrs Lian so angry?’
Patience told her about Jia Huan’s disastrous episode.
‘No wonder he ran away and didn’t dare come home!’ exclaimed the maid.
‘Goodness knows how that Huan will turn out! Can I help you tidy up, Patience?’
‘Don’t worry. Luckily we had a little Bezoar left and it’s all mixed now, so you might
as well go.
‘I’ll certainly tell Mrs Zhao the minute I get back. Perhaps that will stop her
bragging about him all the time.
The maid returned and, true to her word, gave Aunt Zhao a detailed account of Jia
Huan’s debacle.
‘Bring him to me!’ cried Aunt Zhao in an agitated tone.
After a brief search, the maid discovered him skulking in the adjoining room, and
Aunt Zhao immediately began discharging a volley of abuse in his direction:
‘You miserable little runt! What did you have to go and get yourself into trouble for,
spilling their medicine all over the place? I said go and ask how she was, not go
barging in! But you had to, didn’t you? And when you were in, you had to stay and
goad the dragon on. You must have known you were playing with fire! You wait till I
tell your father about this! He’ll give you the thrashing you deserve!’
Even stronger words had already been let loose in reply from the other room. But to
hear for yourself, please turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 85



It is announced that Jia Zheng has been promoted
to the rank of Permanent Secretary
And it is discovered that Xue Pan has once more
brought upon himself the threat of exile



‘All I did was knock a skillet over and spill a bit of medi?cine!’ yelled Jia Huan before
his mother could finish. ‘That measly little brat of hers is still alive, isn’t she? Any?one
would think I’d done her in, the way you two are going on at me about it, slandering
me and dragging my name in the mud! One day I really will finish her off! That would
teach you all a lesson! You’d better tell them to look out!’
Aunt Zhao came hurtling in and clapped a hand over his mouth.
‘You’re asking for it, saying such dreadful things! They’ll have your neck first, my
boy, see if they don’t!’
They kept it up like this for some time. Jia Huan slip?ped in Xi-feng’s barbed little
message, which made his mother more implacable than ever. There was now no
question of her sending anyone over to Xi-feng’s with an apology, and although
Qiao-jie made a complete recovery a few days later, the episode had deepened the
feud be?tween the two sections of the family.
*

One day Steward Lin came in to report to Jia Zheng that it was the Prince of Bei-jing’s
birthday.
‘Are there any special instructions, sir?’
‘Send whatever we usually send,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘Report to Sir She first, before
delivering the presents.’
‘Very good sir,’ said Lin, and went to make the neces?sary arrangements. A little
later, Jia She arrived himself, to discuss with his brother the details of the visit. They
decided to take Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Bao-yu along with them. If for the four
older men it was merely another social engagement, for Bao-yu it was an
opportunity long awaited. He had been a fervent admirer of the Prince’s handsome.
looks and graceful bearing ever since their memorable first encounter at the roadside
halt. He changed eagerly into his smartest clothes and went to join the others.
On arrival at the Palace, Jia She and Jia Zheng pre?sented their cards and before long
a Eunuch Chamberlain of the Household emerged, fingering his beads, and greeted
them with a little peal of falsetto laughter:
‘I hope you are both keeping well?’
They reciprocated the inquiry and the three younger Jias came forward to make their
greeting.
‘His Imperial Highness will be pleased to receive you now.’ The eunuch led the five
of them in, through two further gateways and past a large state-room, to the Inner
Gate of the Prince’s personal residence; Here they halted once more, while the
eunuch went in to announce their arrival, leaving them to be entertained by the
various junior eunuchs in attendance at the gate.
After a brief interval their original escort returned.
‘This way, please.’
They all stepped solemnly forward again. The Prince, dressed in full robe of state, had
paid them the compli?ment of coming out to receive them in one of the covered
walks by the entrance to the main hall. The two brothers advanced first and did
homage, followed in order of seniority by Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Bao-yu. The
Prince took Bao-yu by the hand.
‘It has been a long while since we last met. You have been much in my thoughts.’
He smiled:
‘Tell me, how fares it with that stone of yours?’
Bao-yu dropped to a half-kneeling position and with head bowed replied:
‘Your Highness’s beneficent aura has preserved us from misfortune.’
‘There is nothing very special to eat today,’ continued the Prince pleasantly. ‘But at
least we shall be able to spend a little time talking together.’
Eunuchs lifted the portiere, and the Prince made a charming gesture of yielding the
pas to his guests before leading the way in. The Jias followed, walking with a
de?ferential stoop, and once inside Jia She was the first to offer his birthday
felicitations. These the Prince accepted modestly, while Jia She sank to his knees. The
others fol?lowed suit.
Once these formalities (a detailed description of which our narrative omits) were
over, the Jias began discreetly to take their leave. The Prince turned to his eunuchs
and gave instructions that they were to be escorted to the re?ception which was
being given for his own family and a few other distinguished guests and that they
were to be attended to with the utmost care. He asked Bao-yu to stay behind for a
chat.
‘Do sit down,’ he began, when the others had left. Bao?yu made his kotow of
thanks for this honour, and perch?ing delicately on a covered porcelain tabouret near
the door, talked for a while of his studies and compositions and other things. The
Prince seemed fonder than ever of his young protégé’, and offered him some tea - a
still greater honour. He went on to say:
‘Excellency Governor Wu was in town yesterday for an audience with His Majesty.
He told me that your father, in his last posting as Commissioner of Education, showed
the most scrupulous impartiality and gained the respect of all the candidates he
examined. At the audience, when H.M. inquired, Wu gave your father the highest
recom?mendation. Clearly a favourable omen...’
    ‘You have shown us a great favour, Your Highness, and Governor Wu has done us
a great kindess.’
 ‘You have shown us a great favour, Your Highness, and Governor Wu has done us a
great kindness.’
As he was speaking, a junior eunuch returned from the reception in the front
state-room to convey a message of thanks from the various Lords and Gentlemen for
their banquet, and to present their cards of appreciation and midday greeting to the
Prince, who glanced through them and handed them back with a gracious smile and
a brief word of acknowledgement.
‘And, if it please Your Highness,’ the eunuch con?tinued, ‘the repast you ordered
specially for Master Jia Bao-yu is now ready.’
The Prince gave him a few further words of instruction, and the eunuch led Bao-yu
out to an exquisitely appointed suite of rooms facing a small courtyard, where he
ordered another attendant to wait upon him during the meal. Afterwards, Bao-yu
returned to give thanks and the Prince continued chatting in the same
complimentary vein. Suddenly he laughed:
‘When I first saw that ~tone of yours, I was so taken with it, you know, that on my
return I gave my jade-workers a description of it and asked them to make me one like
it. I am so glad you have come today. I can give it to you to take home. It might
amuse you to keep it.’
One of the junior eunuchs was ordered to bring the jade in, and the Prince. himself
handed it to Bao-yu, who re?ceived it humbly in both hands, gave thanks and then
took his leave. The Prince told two more junior eunuchs to accompany him out, he
rejoined the other members of the family, and they all returned home.
On arrival, Jia She paid his respects to Grandmother Jia and left for his own
apartment. Jia Zheng and the others also paid their respects and gave her a full
account of the reception. Bao-yu communicated to his father the news he had
received about Governor Wu’s sponsorial activities.
‘Governor Wu,’ commented Jia Zheng drily; ‘is an old friend, and a man after my
own heart. He is also, I might add, a statesman of the highest integrity.’
After a little more chat, Grandmother Jia gave permis?sion for them all to disperse.
Jia Zheng took his leave, and was followed by Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Bao-yu as far
as the door.
With a parting injunction to the three of them to stay and keep Grandmother Jia
company a little longer, Jia Zheng returned to his apartment. He had not been there
long when a maid came in to announce that Steward Lin was waiting outside with
something to report. She also handed him a red visiting card with Governor Wu’s
name on it. Jia Zheng told her to admit Lin, and went out to speak to him on the
verandah.
‘Excellency Governor Wu called to see you today, sir,’ reported Lin. ‘I informed him
that you were out. And another thing, sir; I have heard that a Permanent Secre?tary’s
position has become vacant in the Ministry of Works. According to various people,
including officials in the Ministry, you are to be given the post as confirmation of your
preseht rank.’
‘H’m. . .’ said Jia Zheng. ‘We shall see.’
Lin conferred with his master on one or two other mat?ters and then left.
*

After Jia Zheng’s departure, Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian re?turned to their separate
apartments, while Bao-yu went back to Grandmother Jia’s. He was now able to tell
her all about his day at the Palace. He described how kindly the Prince had treated
him, and took out the jade he had been given, which was passed round and
commented on with some amusement. Grandmother Jia told a maid to put it safely
away.
‘And don’t whatever you do take your own off,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘You don’t want
to go getting them. mixed up.
Bao-yu promptly untied his original from around his neck.
‘But look,’ he said, ‘they’re so different, how could I ever get them mixed up? That
reminds me, Grannie, of something that happened the other night, as I was going to
bed. I had just taken my jade off and hung it inside the bed-curtains, when I noticed a
halo around it, and the whole inside of my bed was lit up with a rosy glow.’
‘You silly boy!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘There’s red thread in your pelmet. That
must have been the lamp-light showing through.’
‘But it couldn’t have been. The lamps were all out and it was pitch-black in my
room, and I still saw it glowing.’
Lady Xing and Lady Wang exchanged a meaningful smile. A certain rosy’ event had
been much in the fore?front of their minds recently. Xi-feng too could not re?strain
herself from remarking cryptically:
‘No doubt this heralds the Big Event...’
‘What big event?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘Nothing you would understand,’ put in Grandmother Jia promptly. ‘Now come
along. It’s been a hectic day for you, and you ought to go and rest, and not waste any
more time here telling tall stories.
Bao-yu stayed a minute or two longer and then re?turned to the Garden. When he
was out of the room, Grandmother Jia turned to Lady Wang:
‘Well, have you been to see Mrs Xue, and put it to her yet?’
‘Yes Mother, we have,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘Feng has been so busy with little
Qiao-jie the last few days, and we just haven’t had a chance to go until today. Anyway,
my sister seems very happy with the idea, but she says she ‘will have to wait until
Pan comes home before saying any?thing final. She must consult him first, as the
eldest man in the family.’
‘Quite right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We shall have to bide our time until they have
had a chance to talk it over. In the meantime, not a word of this to anyone.’
*
We must leave these matrimonial confabulations and accompany the unwitting
subject of them, who on his arrival at Green Delights confided to Aroma:
‘Grannie and Feng were being most mysterious about something just now. I don’t
know what’s going on.’
Aroma looked thoughtful for a moment.
‘I’ve no idea either,’ she finally returned, with a peculiar smile, adding (as if it were
an afterthought): ‘I wonder, was Miss Lin there when they were talking?’
‘Of course not! You know she’s been ill and has to stay in.
Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of Musk and Ripple having a tiff in
the next room.
‘What is the matter with you two?’ Aroma called out.
‘It’s all Ripple’s fault!’ replied Musk. ‘She’s been cheat?ing at cards! She took my
money fast enough when she won, but now that I’ve won she won’t let go of a penny.
And now I’m cleaned right out!’
‘Oh come on!’ Bao-yu chided them with a laugh. ‘Stop being so stupid! Who, wants
to quarrel over a few coins?’ They both pouted and went off in high dudgeon, leaving
Aroma. to settle Bao-yu down for the night.
Now Aroma was sure that the mysterious conversation Bao-yu had referred to in
some way concerned his be?trothal. She had only feigned ignorance for fear that in
his present mood, mention of such a touchy subject might provoke another of his fits.
She herself was most anxious to know the latest news, and while she lay, awake that
night she decided to go and see Nightingale first thing in the morning. Nightingale
would be sure to know, and would be able to tell her what was going on.
And so the next day she rose early, and after seeing Bao?-yu off to school, completed
her own toilet and strolled through the Garden to the Naiad’s House. Night?ingale
was out in the front courtyard picking flowers, and greeted her with a smile:
‘Hello, Aroma. Do come in and sit down.’
‘Thank you. Busy with your flowers, I see... How is Miss Lin?’
‘She has lust finished her toilet. She’s waiting for her medicine to be warmed up.’
Nightingale took Aroma inside. Dai-yu was reading a book, which provided Aroma
with a ready-made topic of conversation. She gave an ingratiating smile:
‘It’d be a wonder if you didn’t feel tired sometimes, Miss, reading at such an early
hour. If Master Bao would only follow your good example!’
Dai-yu smiled wanly and put her book down. Mean?while Snowgoose had come in
with a small tray containing two cups, one of medicine and one of water. She was
fol?lowed by a junior maid bearing spittoon and bowl.
Aroma’s intention in coming had been to sound them out; but somehow amid all
these medical ministrations an easy opening failed to present itself, and she reckoned
that it was not worth running the risk of offending the prickly Miss Lin on the
offchance of obtaining the information she wanted. So, after sitting there a little
longer and mak?ing a little desultory chat, she said goodbye and set off back home.
She was approaching Green Delights, when she saw to her considerable surprise two
male figures standing a little way off, and thought it more discreet not to proceed any
further. ‘One of them had already spotted her, however, and came running up. It
turned out to be Ploughboy, one of Bao-yu’s pages.
‘What do you think you’re doing here?’ she asked him.
‘Master Yun’s lust come with a letter for Master Bao, and he’s waiting for a reply.’
‘But you know perfectly well that Master Bao goes to school every day, so what’s
the point of waiting?’
‘That’s what I told’ him,’ said Ploughboy, grinning sheepishly. ‘But he just said that I
was to tell you and he’d wait for your reply instead.’
A suitable retort was already on Aroma’s lips when she noticed that the other man
had started slinking towards them. A closer inspection confirmed that the stealthy
in?truder was indeed Jia Yun. She turned to Ploughboy and said briskly:
‘Tell him his letter will be delivered to Master Bao in due course.’
 Jia Yun’s slow and sinuous progress had been designed to camouflage his true aim,
which was to achieve a tête-a’?tête with the delectable Miss Aroma. His dismissal
(which he heard only too clearly), when almost within reach of his goal, obliged him
to abandon these plans and come to a premature standstill. Aroma turned smartly
on her heel and walked on into Green Delights, leaving Ploughboy to escort the
crestfallen Jia Yun from the Garden.
Aroma related the incident that evening to Bao-yu, on his return from school:
‘That Master Yun from West Lane was here today,’ she said briefly.
‘What did he want?’
‘He left a note for you.’
‘Where is it? I’d better see what it says.’
Musk went to fetch Yun’s note from the bookshelf in the inner ro6m, and handed it
to Bao-yu. The envelope bore the inscription: ‘To My Honoured Uncle’.
‘Funny,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I thought I was supposed to be his father!’
‘What?’ retorted Aroma.
‘Don’t you remember, the year before last when he sent me that white Autumn
Crab-blossom, he signed himself my "Dutiful and Affectionate Son"? It seems I’ve
been demoted to plain Uncle...’
‘Honestly!’ exclaimed Aroma. ‘The pair of you should be thoroughly ashamed of
yourselves! Fancy a grown man like him passing himself off as your son! He ought to
know better! And as for you... Father Bao indeed! Why you’re not even...’
Aroma stopped short. She blushed and gave a little smile. Bao-yu knew what she
meant.
‘Who knows?’ he quipped. ‘Perhaps he thought of me as his Spiritual Father, like
that

celebrated celibate of yore
whose children could be numbered by the score...

I only agreed to it because I thought he was quite clever and a likeable sort of fellow;
if he’s changed his mind, I really couldn’t care less.’
‘If you want to know, he gives me the creeps,’ Aroma continued, as Bao-yu opened
the letter. ‘He’s for ever trying to worm his way in, and looks so shifty about it. I
wouldn’t trust him an inch.’
Bao-yu was too absorbed in examining the contents of the letter to take any notice of
what she was saying. She studied his face as he read. A frown, then a smile, which
soon gave way to a shake of the head, and finally an ex?pression of impatience.
When he seemed to have finished, she asked:
‘What’s it all about then?’
By way of response Bao-yu tore the letter into shreds. Aroma thought it wiser to
change the subject.
‘Are you planning to do some work after dinner or not?’
‘What a cad!’
She smiled at this capricious reply:
‘Well, what was it about?’
‘Oh who cares! Let’s have dinner. Then I’m going straight to bed. I feel quite sick!’
He told one of the junior maids to light a fire and threw the remains of Yun’s letter
into it.
Supper was soon served, but Bao-yu was in no mood for it and only sat there staring
glumly in front of him.
After trying every form of pressure and persuasion Aroma finally succeeded in
making him swallow a mouthful, only to see him put his bowl down once more and
flop listless?ly onto his bed. Suddenly he began to cry.
Neither she nor Musk had the slightest idea what was the matter.
"Come on, you’ve got to tell us,’ protested Musk. ‘It’s all this Yun’s fault, or whatever
his wretched name is. I can’t imagine what his stupid letter was all about, to have
such a queer effect on you, laughing one minute, crying your heart out the next. If
you carry on in this strange way much longer, you’ll worry us to death, indeed you
will!’
She was on the verge of tears herself. Aroma could not help smiling:
‘Musky dear, don’t you go making things worse, please. He’s got quite enough on
his mind as it is. Unless ‘of course you want people to think the letter had something
to do with you...’
‘Well, that’s a stupid remark I must say!’ replied Musk. ‘You don’t know what it said,
anyway. It might have been anything. Why drag me into it? Unless of course it’s got
something to do’ with you...
Before Aroma could reply there was a splutter of laugh?ter from the bed and Bao-yu
sat up, gave his clothes a shake and said to them both:
‘Come on, that’s’ enough. Let’s ‘go to sleep. I’ve got to work early in the morning.’
With these words he settled himself down and went to sleep.
The night passed uneventfully, and next morning, after completing his toilet, he set
off for school. He had just walked 6ut of the doorway when he remembered
some?thing and, calling to Tealeaf to wait, turned back.
‘Musk!’
She came hurrying out.
‘What’s the matter?’
‘If Yun comes today, tell him not to make a nuisance of himself here again or I’ll
report him to Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng.’
‘I will.’
Bao-yu set off once more, and was on his way out when who should come bustling in
but Jia Yun himself. When he saw Bao-yu he promptly saluted and said:
‘My heartiest congratulations, Uncle!’
Bao-yu took this as a reference to th,e business con?tained in the previous day’s
letter and replied curtly:
‘You tactless meddling fool! It makes no difference to you if there are things people
care about.
‘But Uncle!’ protested Yun with a smug smile. ‘If you don’t believe me, take a look
for yourself. The crowds are outside the gate.’
‘What are you talking about?’ snapped Bao-yu, the anger rising in his voice.
At that moment a wave of shouting and cheering came wafting in from the street
outside.
‘Hear that!’ exclaimed Jia Yun. ‘Now will you believe me?’
Bao-yu was more perplexed than ever. He could dis?tinguish a few words above the
general din:
‘Have you people no manners? What do you mean by coming here and making this
racket?’
Another voice replied:
‘The hand that raised Sir Jia has given us the privilege of bearing tidings other
houses would be only too glad of re?ceiving!’
Bao-yu understood at last that his father’s promotion had been officially announced,
and that the din outside the gates was coming from a crowd of professional
well-wishers (their joy made the more vocal by the expectation of a tip). He was
delighted and hurried on out of the Gar?den, only to be cornered again by Jia Yun.
‘Happy Uncle? Needless to say the joy would be dou?bled if we could only
announce your betrothal as well...’
Bao-yu blushed fiercely and spat in Jia Yun’s face:
  ‘Ugh! Why don’t you clear off? You make me sick!’
Jia Yun blushed too.
‘What’s this? I can see you’re a little. .
‘A little what?’ asked Bao-yu angrily.
But Jia Yun’s nerve failed him and he left his remark unfinished.
Bao-yu hurried off to school, where Dai-ru greeted him with a smile:
‘I have just heard the good news, my boy. I must say, I am somewhat surprised to
see you here at all today.’
‘I thought I should report to you first, sir, before going to offer my congratulations,’
replied Bao-yu with a polite smile.
‘I see. Well, no need to attend class today. Take a day’s grace. But please try not to
fritter it away in that garden of yours. At your age, though you may not be able to
take an active part in family affairs, I am sure you would benefit greatly from the
company of your older cousins.’
‘Yes, sir.’
Bao-yu returned home. As he was approaching the inner gate of Grandmother Jia’s
apartment, he encountered Li Gui coming in the opposite direction.
‘I’m glad you’re back,’ said Li Gui, halting by his side’ with a smile. ‘I was on my way
to school to fetch you.’
‘Who told you to?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘Her Old Ladyship sent someone round to your place,’ replied Li Gui, ‘but the maids
said you had already gone to school, so she sent someone with instructions for me to
arrange a few days off school for you. I hear they are hav?ing players over for the
festivities. Anyway, thanks, you’ve saved me a journey.’
Bao-yu went in, to find Grandmother Jia’s front court?yard overflbwing with maids
and serving-women, their loyal faces beaming with pleasure and excitement:
‘You’re late, Master Bao! You’d better hurry on in and congratulate Her Old
Ladyship!’
Bao-yu’s face lit up. When he entered the room, he found Grandmother Jia with
Dai-yu and Xiang-yun sitting to her left and right up on the kang, while assembled
down below were Ladies Xing and Wang, Tan-chun, Xi?chun, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Li Wan’s
two cousins Wen and Qi, and Lady Xing’s niece Xing Xiu-yan. He noticed that Bao-chai,
Bao-qin and Ying-chun were not there.
Overjoyed to see such a gathering, Bao-yu offered his congratulations first to
Grandmother Jia, then to his mother and Lady Xing, and then greeted the rest of the
family. He turned to Dai-yu with- a smile and said:
‘Are you quite recovered now, coz?’
‘Yes, thank you,’ replied Dai-yu, with a hint of a smile. ‘And you? I heard that you
were not very well yourself.’
‘Yes, I had a sudden pain in my heart that night. It’s been better for quite a while,
but I’ve been having to go to school every day, so I haven’t been able to come over
and see you.
Before he had even finished speaking, Dai-yu turned away to talk to Tan-chun. Xi-feng
was standing near them and observed sarcastically:
‘I thought you two were meant to be inseparable? The way you talk anyone would
think you were strangers. Still, I suppose

His to honour,
Hers to obey...’

Everyone laughed. The colour flew into Dai-yu’s face and at first she was quite
speechless with embarrassment. But thinking that some sort of reply was expected
of her, she finally came out with:
‘Who’d expect you to understand...’
which seemed to amuse everyone even more.
After a moment’s reflection Xi-feng realized that her joke had been in rather poor
taste, and she was about to introduce a fresh topic of conversation, in an attempt to
clear the air a little, when Bao-yu suddenly turned to Dai?yu and said:
‘Coz, do you know what that tactless, blundering fool Yun tried to...’ But whatever it
was he had been going to say, he thought better of it. There was a puzzled laugh
from the others. Someone said:
‘What are you talking about?’
Dai-yu was as much in the dark as they were and smiled awkwardly. Bao-yu
extricated himself by launching off at another tangent:
‘I heard just now that someone is planning to send over some players. When are
they coming, does anyone know?’
They all stared at him in amazement and laughed. It was Xi-feng who replied:
‘You’re the one who’s heard. Why ask us?’
‘I’d better go and check,’ he said promptly.
‘Now don’t go getting into mischief out there,’ warned his grandmother. ‘You don’t
want the crowd to make fun of you, do you? And remember, this is a very special day
for your father, and if he comes home and finds you gad?ding about, there’s sure to
be trouble.’
‘Yes, Grannie,’ replied Bao-yu, and effected his escape.
When he had gone, Grandmother Jia asked Xi-feng:
‘What’s all this about sending players?’
‘ Uncle Wang Zi-sheng’s family,’ replied Xi-feng, ‘want to do something to
congratulate you and Uncle Zheng and Auntie. They’ve hired a new troupe of young
actors spe?cially, and they say that the day after tomorrow is a lucky one.
Xi-feng laughed:
‘And it is too, in more ways than one.
She looked at Dai-yu and smiled. Dai-yu smiled shyly back.
‘Of course!’ exclaimed Lady Wang. ‘It’s our niece’s birthday!’
When Grandmother Jia had taken in what they were saying she laughed out loud:
‘It just goes to show how absent-minded I’m getting in my old age! It’s a good thing
I’ve Secretary Feng here to keep me organized. Well, what could be better.: they can
celebrate your Uncle Zheng’s promotion, and we can cele?brate your birthday at the
same time!’
This had everyone laughing, and it was proposed and carried unanimously that with
such an apt way of putting things, the old lady positively had a right to enjoy such
prodigious good fortune.
Bao-yu had returned in time to hear about the party and was beside himself with joy.
They all sat down to lunch in an atmosphere of great excitement. After lunch, Jia
Zheng returned from giving thanks at court, and having per?formed his ceremonial
prostrations in the family shrine, came in to kotow before Grandmother Jia. He rose
to his feet and said a few words before leaving to pay various official calls.
Over the next day or two there was constant bustle and confusion, as a stream of
relatives besieged Rong-guo House. Horses and carriages thronged the main entrance,
and in every corner important-looking gentlemen in starched official hats trimmed
with sable sat waiting their turn. Truly:

                                   Where flowers bloom,
    Bees and butterflies abound;
Skies and oceans swell
When the moon is round.

*
Two days later, the players, on the instructions of Wang Zi-sheng and other relations,
arrived early in the morning to set up their mobile stage in Grandmother Jia’s
court?yard, facing the main hall. The Jia menfolk, in full dress, entertained their
relatives in the open courtyard, where more than ten tables had been laid. A special
glass play-viewing screen had been put up between the courtyard and the gallery
overlooking it from the north side, and four tables had been laid in the enclosed
space, to give the ladies a chance of seeing the plays, and particularly for
Grandmother Jia’s benefit (as she was more enthusiastic about the whole venture
than anyone else). Aunt Xue was installed at the head of the table of honour, with
her sister Lady Wang and her niece Bao-qin, while Grandmother Jia sat at the head of
the table opposite with Lady Xing and her niece Xiu-yan. The two remaining tables
were still empty, and Grandmother Jia sent word for the girls to hurry up.
Presently Dai-yu arrived, ushered in by Xi-feng and a convoy of maids. She had
chosen one or two of her newer things to wear, and as she came into the enclosure
she looked exactly like the Goddess of the Moon descending to Earth. She greeted
Grandmother Jia and her aunts with a shy smile, and Xiang-yun and the two Li sisters
asked her to Sit at the head of their table. Her polite refusals were soon over-ruled by
Grandmother Jia:
‘Go on, you must, dear. After all, this is your day too!’
‘Really?’ exclaimed Aunt Xue, rising to her feet. ‘Is Miss Lin celebrating something
today as well?’
Grandmother Jia laughed:
‘It’s her birthday!’
‘Oh goodness, I quite forgot! How awful of me!’ Aunt Xue went up to Dai-yu: ‘I’m so
sorry. I hope you’ll for?give me for being so forgetful. I must ask Bao-qin to call on
you later and wish you happy returns properly.’
‘Please don’t go to such trouble on my account,’ mur?mured Dai-yu with a smile.
She looked around her as they all sat down, and noticed that Bao-chai had not come.
‘I hope Cousin Chai isn’t ill or anything. Why couldn’t she come today?’
‘She was going to,’ replied Aunt Xue. ‘But we needed someone to look after things
at home, so in the end she had to stay behind.’
Dai-yu flushed and said with a slightly puzzled smile:
‘Surely now that Cousin Pan’s married there’s no need for her to stay at home? She
probably didn’t feel in the mood for all the noise and excitement. I’m sorry she didn’t
come. I miss her such a lot.’
Aunt Xue smiled:
‘How very sweet of you, dear. She thinks of you all a great deal too. In a day or two
I must tell her to come over and have a chat.’
The maids were already pouring wine and setting out dishes on the tables, while
outside in the courtyard the show had begun. It opened, predictably enough, with a
couple of festive pieces. The third selection, however, turned out to be something of
a novelty. A chorus of Gol?den Pages and Jade Maidens came onto the stage, fairy
streamers fluttering and flags aloft, to reveal in their midst a gorgeously attired lady,
her head draped in black, her costume shimmering with the celestial hues of the
Rain?bow Skirt and Feathered Jacket. She (or rather he, for the part was played by a
female impersonator) sang a short aria and then left the stage.
None of the family could identify the piece at. all, but they overheard one of the
guests saying:
‘That was "The Transfiguration", from one of their latest productions, "The Palace
of Pearls". It tells the story of Chang E, who comes down to earth from her palace in
the moon and is about to give her hand to her mortal lover when the Goddess of
Mercy opens her eyes to the truth, and she dies before the marriage can take place.
In that scene, she is being wafted up to the moon. Didn’t you catch the words of her
aria?


‘Tis Love that rules the minds of men,
And of this Truth Eternal
Obscures all trace:
That even harvest moons must wane
And purest beauty vernal
Fade from grace.
Alas, ‘twas Mortal Love
That veiled my sight,
And all but stole me
From my Orb of Light.’

Next on the programme was ‘A Wife Eats Husks’, from ‘The Story of the Lute’,
followed by ‘Bodhidharma and his Disciple Crossing the River’, from ‘The Pilgrim’s
Path’. This last scene was full of the most spectacular feats of acrobatic mime and
other phantasmagorical effects. The excitement had just reached its height when one
of the Xue family’s servants, his face dripping with sweat, burst into the courtyard
auditorium and hurried over to Xue Ke’s table:
‘Master Ke! Come home quickly! And send word in to Madam that she must come
too. It’s very urgent!’
‘What’s happened?’ asked Xue Ke.
‘I’ll tell you when we get home, sir!’ panted the boy.
Without even stopping to thank his hosts, Xue Ke fol?lowed the boy out of the
courtyard, sending one of the Jia maids in with a message to the ladies’ enclosure.
When Aunt Xue heard the news, she went white in the face. Taking Bao-qin with her,
she made a distracted farewell and went straight out to her carriage, leaving the
whole assembly in a state of high alarm.
‘We had better send someone over with them,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I am sure
everyone is most anxious to learn what this is all about.’
They all agreed.

*
The players continued with their programme. But we must leave them and follow
Aunt Xue, who on her arrival at home saw two yamen runners waiting in the inner
gate?way. With them were some employees from the family pawnshop.
‘When Mrs Xue arrives,’ they were saying, ‘she’ll be able to explain everything.’
When the yamen runners saw this elderly lady sweeping up to the gate with her large
retinue of male and female attendants, and realized the distinguished position of the.
person they were dealing with, they stood to attention and let her pass. Aunt Xue
went on through the reception hall and could already hear the sound of heavy
wailing coming from her daughter-in-law’s apartment. She quickened her step.
Bao-chai came out to meet her, her face wet with tears.
‘Have you heard, Mama? Please don’t panic! We must try to do something!’
They went inside together. Aunt Xue had already been told the main facts by one of
the servants on her way in, and was still sobbing and trembling from the shock.
‘But who? Who was it?’ she asked agitatedly.
‘Madam,’ said one of the servants, ‘details like that are not going to make much
difference at present. The law says "a life for a life". So we must think what to do.’
‘Think!’ cried Aunt Xue hysterically. ‘What’s the earth?ly good of thinking at a time
like this?’
‘The best thing as we see it,’ continued the servant, is this. First, send young Master
Ke with some money tonight to visit Mr Pan in prison. Then, first thing tomor?row,
Master Ke must get himself a good scrivener, some?one well-versed in legal
terminology. He must offer him a good fee to make sure this death-sentence is
quashed. Then, when that’s been done, we must ask one of the Jia gentlemen here
to pull a few strings. But first of all, we must tip the yamen runners outside a few
taels. Then we can get on with the rest of the plan.’
Aunt Xue was not convinced.
‘Just find the man’s family,’ she said. ‘Give them what?ever they want for funeral
expenses and compensation. If they don’t press the charge, surely he’ll be let off
lightly?’
Bao-chai’s voice could be heard through the door-curtain:
‘No, Mama, that will never do. The m6re money we hand out the more trouble
we’ll cause in the long run. We should do as the boy says.’
‘What have I left to live for?’ sobbed Aunt Xue. ‘Let me go there and see him once!
Then the two of us can die together!’
Bao-chai begged her to take heart, and at the same time called out for the boy to set
off with Xue Ke at once. The maids helped Aunt Xue indoors again. Xue Ke came by
on his way out.
‘Send someone home with a letter as soon as you have any news,’ Bao-chai
instructed him. ‘You must stay there. We’re counting on you.’
Xue Ke promised to do his utmost and left.
While Bao-chai applied herself once more to the task of soothing her agitated mother,
Xia Jin-gui took the oppor?tunity of launching an undisturbed attack on Caltrop:
‘So a murder was nothing to this family, was it?’ she screamed at her. ‘You all came
straight up to town after?wards as if nothing had happened, did you? Well it looks as
if you spoke once too often, Miss Swanky Panky! Be?cause this time it’s the real thing,
and look at you! Where’s all your money and all your fine friends and posh relatives
now? You’re all so scared you don’t know if you’re coming or going! And in a few days,
when they put Pan away, then I suppose you’ll bugger off and leave me here to carry
the can single-handed!’
She broke into one of her dramatic wails. Aunt Xue heard every word and was so
furious that she fainted. Bao-chai was at her wits’ end. And in the midst of this
pandemonium one of Lady Wang’s senior maids arrived, to ask ‘if there was any
news’. This presented Bao-chai with an additional problem. She was fully aware of
her delicate position since the official betrothal visit a few days previously, and knew
that strictly speaking she should shun all contact with her future bridegroom’s family
(including the domestic staff). However, the fact that the betrothal was still not
finally settled, and the nature of the present emergency, seemed to justify a
temporary waiving of the rules.
  ‘We don’t know the full story yet,’ she said to the maid. ‘All we’ve heard is that my
brother has killed someone and that he has been arrested by the local magistrate.
We don’t know exactly what kind of homicide he has been found guilty of, but
Master Ke has gone to find Out. We should have more definite news in a day or two
and will let Her Ladyship know straight away. Please thank her for her kind inquiry
and say that at a later stage we’ll be sure to need all the support Sir She and Sir
Zheng can give us.’
The maid returned with this message.
The next two days were spent by Aunt Xue and Bao?chai waiting in unbearable
suspense. At last on the third day a boy came back with a letter from Xue Ke, which
he gave to a maid to hand to the ladies. Bao-chai opened it, and this is what she read:
‘Pan’s case is "fatal bodily harm by mischance", not intentional homicide". I lodged
an appeal in my own name first thing this morning and am still waiting for the
magistrate’s rescript. Pan bungled his original statement, and once the appeal has
been approved, we must change his plea at the rehearing. We should be able to get
him off.
‘I urgently need TLs. 500. Have the pawnshop forward it without delay. Tell Aunt
not to worry. The boy can tell you the rest.’
When Bao-chai had finished reading the letter aloud to her, Aunt Xue wiped her eyes
and said:
‘His life hangs in the balance, doesn’t it?’
‘Before you go upsetting yourself all over again, Mama,’ said Bao-chai, ‘let’s send
for the boy and ask him what he knows.’
A maid was sent to fetch the boy. When he came in, Aunt Xue told him to give them a
full account of every?thing he had heard.
‘The evening we arrived,’ he began, ‘when I heard what Mr Pan told Master Ke, I
nearly died of fright...
But for the rest of the account, please turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 86



Bribery induces an old mandarin to tamper
with the course of justice
And a discourse on the Qin provides a young lady
with a vehicle for romantic feelings



It was told in the last chapter how Bao-chai read Xue Ke’s letter aloud to her mother,
who then summoned the boy and told him to ~peat whatever Xue Pan had said
about his misadventure.
‘I couldn’t make out every word, ma’am,’ he began, ‘but I did hear Mr Pan tell
Master Ke that...’
He glanced quickly round the room, and having satisfied himself that there was no
one else present, continued:
that he couldn’t stand any more of the terrible scenes at home, and had decided to
go on a business trip in the South. He knew someone in this town about seven?ty
miles south of the capital, and was thinking of asking him along on his travels. On his
way to this man’s house, who should he meet but that fellow Jiang Yu-han he used to
be friendly with, on his way to the capital with some young actors. The two of them
went into a bar for a jug of wine and a bite to eat, and that’s when things started to
go wrong. The waiter kept making eyes at Jiang, which made Mr Pan angry. Well,
Jiang left that same day. But the next day, Mr Pan took this other man - the one he
was plan?ning to travel with - to the same bar for a drink. After a few rounds he
remembered the waiter’s cheeky behav?iour and made a point of complaining about
the wine. The waiter took a long time coming with a fresh jug; Mr Pan picked up his
cup and aimed it at the waiter’s face. Well, the waiter turned out to be a daring sort
of rogue himself he stuck his head out and challenged Mr Pan to hit him. Next thing,
wham! Mr Pan smashed the cup right down on top of his head. Blood came spurting
out, and the wai?ter went down, cursing and swearing. Then he came over all
quiet...’
‘But why on earth did nobody try to stop them?’ asked Aunt Xue.
‘I didn’t hear Mr Pan say anything about that, ma’am. That’s all I know.’
‘All right. You may go and rest now.
‘Thank you ma’am.’
So saying, the boy went out.
Aunt Xue went first to her sister and entrusted her with the task of enlisting Jia
Zheng’s support. When Lady Wang brought the matter up and gave Jia Zheng a
detailed account of what had happened, he hummed and hawed and said that he
could do nothing until Xue Ke’s appeal had gone through the normal channels and
the judge had issued his rescript.
Aunt Xue had the five hundred taels weighed out in the family pawnshop and gave it
to the boy to deliver post?haste to Xue Ke.
Three days later, the letter they were waiting for arrived. It was handed to Aunt Xue,
who setit a lunior maid at once to fetch Bao-chai. She hurried over, and this is what
she read:
‘Dear Aunt. Tls. 500 received and distributed as tips among the yamen staff. Pan is
being reasonably treated in jail, so please don’t worry.
‘Our problem is that the people here are being very awkward. Neither the dead
man’s family nor the eye?witnesses will cooperate. Even Pan’s so-called friend - the
one he invited to travel with him - is on their side. It’s especially hard for Li Xiang and
myself, as strangers, but luckily we have managed to find a good scrivener who has
agreed to help us - for a pretty stiff fee. His advice was that we should get to work on
Wu Liang (that’s the "friend"). First, since he was being held in custody as a primary
witness, we should get someone to stand bail for him; then offer him money to
corroborate our plea of death by mischance. If Wu refused to cooperate we were to
try accusing him of being the murderer himself and of using an outsider as a
scapegoat. He’d be too scared then not to play along.
‘So far so good. We got Wu out on bail, bribed the family and various other
witnesses, and lodged our appeal the day before yesterday. The rescript was issued
today. It speaks for itself.’
Bao-chai went on to read out the copy of the appeal and appended rescript.

APPEAL

brought by Xue Ke, younger cousin of and proxy for the defen?dant, Xue Pan,
wrongfully convicted of the Intentional Homi?cide by Blows of Zhang San, late of this
county.

STATEMENT OF FACTS: The defendant, registered domicile Nanking, at present
resident in the capital, on the ___of the ___month, left home intending to do
business in the Southern
Provinces. Not many days later, his servant returned home with the news that the
defendant had been involved in an incident in which another party had lost his life.
The appellant came hither in all haste, to discover that the above-mentioned Mr
Zhang had indeed met his death at the hand of the defendant, but that it was a case
of Fatal Bodily Harm by Mischance and not of Intentional Homicide by Blows, as
previously alleged.
PLEA: On arrival at the County Jail, the appellant was a witness to the most earnest
protestations of innocence on the part of the defendant, and hearty denial of any
previous animosity to-wards ‘Zhang, with whom indeed he had not been in the
slightest degree acquainted before the incident in question, which had occurred
solely as the result of a trivial disagreement over a jug of wine. The defendant, by
way of complaint, emptied the con?tents of his cup onto the floor. At precisely the
same instant, the deceased bent down to retrieve some object from an adjacent spot,
slipping as he did so, with the unfortunate, but entirely accidental consequence that
a fatal collision occurred between the defendant’s cup and the deceased’s os
bregmatis.
When Your Honour saw fit to apprehend the defendant and subject him to judicial
interrogation, his terror of the rack was so extreme that he rashly admitted the
charge of Homicide by Blows, thus bringing upon himself the sentence of
Strangula?tion, with possibility of Commutation to Exile. Your Honour, in your great
Wisdom and Clemency, aware no doubt of some latent injustice, has delayed passing
sentence until the present time. The defendant, being in custody, is prevented by law
from appealing pro sua parte. The appellant has therefore been embold?ened by
considerations of family loyalty to act on his behalf, most humbly and earnestly
beseeching Your Honour to reopen the case and subject all parties concerned to a
second examina?tion. This would be a magnanimous course of action, and one that
would earn the never-ending gratitude and lifelong devotion of the appellant and his
entire family.

Bao-chai now came to the judge’s rescript, which read as follows:

RESCRIPT

An inquest was held at the scene of the crime, and the evidence heard was
conclusive. No torture of any kind was applied to the defendant, who freely admitted
the charge, viz. Homicide by Blows. His admission of guilt has now been officially
entered in the records.
You, the appellant, an outsider with no first-hand knowledge of the case, in
presuming to fabricate this unfounded appeal are guilty of contempt of court. In view
of the mitigating circum?stances of family loyalty, your offence will be overlooked in
this instance.

APPEAL REJECTED


‘There’s no hope left then!’ cried Aunt Xue. ‘What can we do now?’
‘That isn’t all,’ said Bao-chai. ‘There’s a P.S.’
She read on:
‘For confidential instructions, ask the boy - urgent.’
Aunt Xue immediately questioned the boy, who sup?plied the following information:
‘The people at the yamen know how rich we are, ma’am, and Master Ke says we’ll
have to use family con?nections here in the capital, and send another large bribe, if
we’re to get a rehearing and a lighter sentence. He says you must act quickly, ma’am,
as delay now could mean hardship for Mr Pan.’
Aunt Xue dismissed the boy and went at once to see her sister again. Lady Wang
pleaded strenuously with Jia Zheng, but the most he was prepared to do was send
someone to ‘have a word’ with the judge. He refused to contemplate the use of
‘pecuniary considerations’. Aunt Xue, fearing that this gesture would prove
ineffective, begged Xi-feng to speak to Jia Lian. The judge’s price was high - the figure
ran into several thousands of taels; but in the end an agreement was reached, and
the way was clear for Xue Ke to proceed with his plan.
The case was officially re-opened, and all the parties concerned were summoned
once more to the district ya?men - the beadle, eye-witnesses, relatives of the
deceased, etc. Xue Pan was brought out from the cells. The clerk of the court called
the roll, and the judge ordered the chief beadle to verify the original depositions.
Then Mrs Zhang (nee Wang) and Zhang Er, the deceased’s mother and uncle, were
called to give evidence.
‘May’t please Yeronner,’ began Mrs Zhang, punctuating her delivery with sobs, ‘we
Zhangs are country folk and live to the south of town. Papa Zhang’s been gone these
eighteen years. We had the three boys, but our eldest and second have both passed
away. The only one as I had left was our third, and now he’s gone too!’ (More sobs.)
‘Twenty-three this year he’d’ve been, anitplease Yeron?ner, and still a single lad.
He’d took this job at Li’s Bar by way o’ helpin’ me out, seem’ as we’d so little comin’
in. It’d’ve been ‘bout midday when this man come to the door-I can see ‘im now
-"There’s been a fight at Li’s Bar!" says he, "And your boy’s been killed!" My poor
heart, Yeronner! I was took that bad! I runned to Li’s and there was my boy lyin’ on
the ground, the blood runnin’ out ‘is poor ‘ead! I tried askin’ ‘im what ‘ad ‘appened,
but ‘e couldn’t say nothing, ‘e was ‘ardly breathin’, and then ... well, then ‘e was gone!
If I could only get my hands on that wickedevilmurderin’
A growl of disapproval rippled through the ranks of the court underlings. Mrs Zhang
rapidly kotowed to the bench:
‘All I’m askin’ for is reglar justice Yeronner! He was all I ‘ad left in the world!’
‘Next witness - Gaffer Li!’ called the judge peremp?torily.
Gaffer Li, proprietor of Li’s Bar, came forward and knelt before the bench.
‘Was this fellow Zhang employed for casual work on your premises?’ asked the
judge.
‘He was a regular waiter,’ replied Li.
‘I see here that in your original deposition, as recorded at the Inquest, you state
that Xue Pan dealt Zhang San a fatal blow on the head. Tell me, did you personally
observe this blow?’
‘No, Your Honour. I was behind the counter at the time, in the tap-room. I heard
that one of the customers in a private room had ordered some wine. Then a little
later I heard that someone had been hurt. I ran in and saw Zhang San lying on the
floor. He couldn’t speak. I informed the beadle, and sent someone to tell Mrs Zhang. I
have no idea how the fight started. There was a gentleman sitting at Mr Xue’s table,
Your Honour. Perhaps he could supply the necessary information...’
‘What!’ thundered the judge impressively. ‘In your orig?inal deposition it says quite
plainly that you saw the inci?dent with your own eyes. Are you now trying to tell me
that you saw nothing?’
‘When I made that first statement, Your Honour, I was in such a fluster that I must
have got my facts a bit mud?dled...’
Another growl through the ranks.
‘Next witness!’ ordered the judge.
The next witness was Wu Liang, Xue Pan’s ‘friend’.
‘Tell me,’ said the judge, ‘were you sitting drinking with the defendant at the time
of the crime? Exactly how did the fatal blow occur? Be sure to speak the truth.’
‘On the day in question, Your Honour,’ replied Wu, ‘Mr Xue called at my house and
kindly invited me out for a drink. As he was dissatisfied with the quality of the wine,
he ordered a fresh jug to be brought. But the waiter, Zhang San, refused to oblige.
This annoyed Mr Xue, and by way of protest he threw the contents of his cup in the
waiter’s face. It all happened very fast, and somehow the cup must have slipped from
Xue’s hand and collided with Zhang’s head. This is a true account of the incident as I
saw it with my own eyes.’
‘Nonsense!’ cried the judge. ‘Why, at the Inquest the defendant himself admitted
to "assaulting Zhang and deal?ing the fatal blow with the cup", and you verified the
admission yourself. This is perjury! Slap his face!’
An answering cry came from the appropriate section of the court, and the
punishment was about to be adminis?tered, when Wu protested:
‘Mr Xue never started a fight, sir! The cup slipped from his hand and collided with
Zhang’s head! It was all an accident! Question the defendant himself! Have mercy!’
The judge summoned Xue Pan.
‘Now, Xue, for the last time, tell me: what was your grudge against Zhang San? And
how did he meet with his death? I want the whole truth!’
‘Your Honour, be merciful I beseech you!’ pleaded Xue Pan. ‘I never raised a hand
to strike the man. All I did was empty my cup on the floor because he refused to
bring the wine I had ordered. Before I knew it, the cup slipped from my hand and
struck him on the head. I did all I could to staunch the wound, but it was hopeless.
The loss of blood was so great that he died in a matter of minutes. At the Inquest I
was in such fear of torture that I made a false confession of assault. I beg Your
Honour to show mercy accordingly!’
‘Miserable wretch!’ bellowed the judge. ‘You have already pleaded guilty to
intentional assault. Are you now trying to say that it was no more than an accidental
colli?sion?’
He went on in this fashion, making a series of suitably august noises, threatening Pan
with the rod one minute and the rack the next, if he would not confess. This time,
however, Pan persisted in his denial.
The coroner was now called upon to make public the results of his post-mortem.
‘May it please Your Honour, I have duly examined the corpse of Zhang San, and find
no trace of injury but a single scalp-wound, caused by a porcelain artifact. The wound
is approximately one and three-quarter inches in length, penetrating to a depth ~f
half an inch. The bregmatic bone has sustained a fracture approximately one third of
an inch in length. The type of wound points unmistakably to a collision of an
accidental nature.’
The judge checked the coroner’s certificate, which (as he knew quite well) had been
altered by his clerk, and without raising any objections casually asked all con?cerned
to sign their statements.
‘But Yeronner!’ wailed Mrs Zhang. ‘What about all them other wounds? Ever so
many there was! Coronary said so himself last time, I remember! Where’ve they all
got to now?’
‘Foolish woman!’ exclaimed the judge. ‘Here is the certificate, duly signed - see for
yourself.’
He called the dead man’s uncle forward (a more coop?erative witness):
‘Zhang Er, will you tell the court how many wounds there were on your nephew’s
corpse?’
‘Just the one on his skull, sir,’ replied Zhang.
The judge turned to Mrs Zhang:
‘What further need have you of proof!’
He told the clerk of the court to hand Mrs Zhang the certificate, and instructed the
chief beadle and Zhang Er to explain it to her. The other documents in the case were
now collated - the proceedings of the inquest, duly auth?enticated with the
signatures of those present at the time, and the depositions of the witnesses, which
were now unanimous in stating that there had been no quarrel, ergo no assault, ergo
Xue Pan was only guilty of ‘causing fatal bodily harm by mischance’, a lesser degree
of manslaugh?ter redeemable by payment of a fine. The parties were now required
to affix their signature or mark to the docu?ment, Xue Pan was detained until
confirmation of his sentence was received, and Wu Liang and his guarantor were
released. The court was adjourned.
As the judge was leaving, Mrs Zhang broke into another untimely bout of wailing and
sobbing, and he ordered the court lictors to send her packing. Uncle Zhang also did
what he could to bring her to her senses:
‘It really was an accident,’ he said, ‘so why hold an innocent man guilty? His Honour
has passed sentence now, so for goodness’ sake pipe down.’
Xue Ke had been waiting outside, and was greatly re?lieved to hear that all had gone
according to plan. He sent a letter home, saying that he planned to stay on until the
confirmation came through, when he would pay Xue Pan’s fine.
Walking through the town later that day, he became aware of a buzz of excited
conversation in the street:
‘Have you heard? One of the Imperial Concubines has passed away, and there’s to
be a three-day Recess at Court…’
Since the Imperial Mausoleum was not far from the town, Xue Ke thought to himself,
the judge would now be busy preparing for the funeral and repairing the road with
yellow earth for the procession. He would hardly have time to think about routine
legal matters, and conse?quently he himself would achieve little by hanging around.
So he went to the jail and explained to Pan that he was going home for a few days.
Pan was glad for his mother’s sake, and sent a brief note to reassure her. ‘I’m fine,’ he
wrote. ‘A few more taels in the right pockets and I’ll be home! But be sure to keep
the cash flowing!’ Xue Ke left the boy Li Xiang behind just in case, and set off home
straight away.
On arrival, he gave Aunt Xue a full account of how the judge had managed the
transition from ‘assault’ to ‘mis?chance’.
‘All that’s left now,’ he finished by saying, ‘is to give the Zhangs a bit more money.
Then, when the commuta?tion is confirmed, it will all be over Aunt Xue breathed a
sigh of relief.
‘I was hoping you would be able to come home,’ she said. ‘I have been wanting to
go over and thank the Jias for all that they’ve done, and I thought it would be nice if I
could go and keep an eye on things for Aunt Wang and spend some time with the
girls. With the death of the Zhou’ Concubine the family is away every day and they
must be rather lonely at home. But I couldn’t go until now because there was no one
here to take charge.’
‘The funny thing is that on my way here I heard it was the Jia Concubine that had
died,’ said Xue Ke. ‘That’s why I came back in such a hurry - though I must say I found
it hard to credit.’
‘She was ill a while ago,’ replied Aunt Xue. ‘But she re?covered, and I have heard
nothing about her being ill since. It’s odd, though: Lady Jia was not feeling well a few
days ago, and whenever she closed her eyes she had a vision of Her Grace. Everyone
was most concerned at first, and they even sent someone to Court to inquire, but
were told that Her Grace was in good health Then, three days ago, in the evening,
Lady Jia suddenly said out loud:
"Why have you come all this way on your own to see me, Your Grace?" This time they
put it down to her illness and didn’t take it seriously. "If you don’t believe me," said
Lady Jia, "let me tell you what Her Grace said: Prosperity may all too soon be spent;
draw back, draw back before it is too late." They thought she was imagin?ing it all - it
was just the sort of thing a lady of her years would be preoccupied with, after all -
and paid no atten?tion. So can you imagine the panic the next morning, when
somehow they heard from Court that one of the Concubines was critically ill, and
that all members of the family with titles were to proceed to the Palace! They were
in the most dreadful state when they set off! But be?fore they had even left the
palace, we heard that it was the Zhou Concubine. It is odd, don’t you agree, that the
rumour you heard should have tallied so exactly with Lady Jia’s premonitions?’
‘The public always gets its facts mixed up,’ commented Bao-chai, ‘and the Jias are
so sensitive about the whole thing that they’ve only to hear the words "Her Grace"
mentioned to start jumping to the most dire conclusions. It nearly always turns out
to be a false alarm. During this latest excitement, I was chatting to one or two of their
maids and older serving-women, and they told me they’d known all along that it
couldn’t possibly have been Her Grace. I asked one of them how they could be so
sure, and she told me of something that happened several years ago.
‘It was the first month of the year, and there was a for?tune-teller from one of the
provinces here in the capital, who had been recommended to the family for his great
accuracy. Lady Jia gave instructions to slip Her Grace’s Eight Stems and Branches in
with some of the maids’, and to ask this man to tell their fortunes. He singled hers
Out at once.’ "There must be some mistake here", he said. "I see that this young lady
was born on the first of the first month. If the Stem and Branch of her natal hour
were cor?rect, she would have to be a person of high estate, and not a servant in this
household." Sir Zheng and the others urged him to cast the horoscope anyway, so he
went on: "The Cyclical Year Jia Shen (Wood + Metal), the Prime Month Bing Yin (Fire
+ Wood). Both Failure and Decline are present. Although the Year Branch Shen shows
Rank and Wealth, as it is not her fate to be raised within the household, the aspect of
this Branch is not particularly favourable. The Day Yi Mao (Wood + Wood),
com?mencement of Spring, Wood at its zenith. We have here a conflict, a
Configuration of Peers. In this case it enhances the subject, just as fine timber is only
fashioned into an in?strument of true greatness when it encounters the axe. The
Hour Stem Xin (Metal) indicates Nobility, while the Hour Branch Si (Fire) indicates
Rank and Fortune again, this time the High Degree known as Lucky Horse Rides the
Sky. The Day Conjunction shows Supreme Rank and the Forces of Heaven and the
Moon presiding over her fate. She will be favoured with residence in the Imperial
Bedchamber. If the Hour Stem and Branch are correct, this subject must be an
Imperial Concubine."
‘As the maid said,’ Bao-chai continued, ‘the horoscope fitted Her Grace perfectly.
They remembered the end part, too. "Alas!" he said, "such Glory cannot endure.
When Hare meets Tiger, and Wood meets Wood, in a Mao Month of a Yin Year, her
Peers will outshine her, the Decline will reach its nadir, and the fine wood, through
being too prettily carved, will lose its heart and strength” Although the family in their
panic forgot all about this final prediction, the maid remembered. As she said to
Cousin Wan, "this is a Yin Year, and we’ve already passed the Mao Month, so it
couldn’t be Her Grace!"
Bao-chai had hardly finished when Xue Ke exclaimed:
‘Forget about the Jias for a minute; if there is such a good fortune-teller around,
why not ask him about Pan? Perhaps he could tell us what evil force has crossed his
path and brought him such bad luck this year? Give me Pan’s Stems and Branches,
and I’ll go and find out if the future holds any mote upsets in store for him.’
‘The fortune-teller was from one of the provinces. Who knows where he is now?’
replied Bao-chai.
During this conversation, they had already started to pack Aunt Xue’s things. She
went over to the main man?sion, to find that, as she had supposed, Li Wan, Tan-chun
and the girls had been left on their own. They welcomed her and asked. after Xue
Pan. They were greatly relieved when she told them that he was out of danger and
only waiting for confirmation of his sentence.
‘Mother was saying only yesterday,’ said Tan-chun, ‘that she’d always relied on you
in the past, Auntie, whenever there was any sort of crisis, to come over and keep an
eye on things. But this time she felt she could hardly ask you, as you had enough to
cope with. She was rather uneasy about leaving us here on our own, all the same.
‘I’ve been worrying about you myself,’ replied Aunt Xue. ‘But you know how it’s
been this last week or two. Your Cousin Ke has been away trying to sort out Pan’s
affairs, and really 1 couldn’t leave Bao-chai on her own, she’d never be able to
manage. Especially as Pan’s young wife is so incompetent. What with one thing and
another, I simply haven’t been able to get away. The only reason Ke has been able to
come home and relieve me now is that the judge in charge of the case is going to be
tied up with the Zhou Concubine’s funeral arrangements for a few days’.
‘We’d be so pleased if you could stay for a day or two,’ said Li Wan.
Aunt Xue nodded.
‘I should very much like to be here and keep you girls company. The only thing is, I
am a little worried that Bao-chai may feel lonely without me.
‘Well why not ask her to come over as well?’ suggested Xi-chun.
Aunt Xue gave a little laugh.
 ‘Oh, I couldn’t do that.’
‘But why not? She used to live here, didn’t she?’
Li Wan replied for Aunt Xue.
‘You don’t understand. It’s not the same now. They’re very busy at present, so she
can’t possibly come.
Xi-chun supposed that this was the real reason for Bao?chai’s absence, and dropped
the matter.
As they were talking, Grandmother Jia and the rest of the family arrived back from
their visit of condolence. When they saw that Aunt Xue was there, preliminary
courtesies were dropped for once and everyone wanted to know the latest in the Pan
affair. Aunt Xue told them the whole story. Bao-yu was present, and pricked up his
ears when he heard Jiang Yu-han’s name mentioned. Although he thought it
inadvisable to show much interest in front of the others, secretly he asked himself
why his old actor-friend had not been to look him up, if he was back in town. Then,
noticing that Bao-chai had not accompanied her mother, and trying to imagine what
could be keeping her at home, he began to drift into one of his brown stud?ies, and
was only aroused and restored to a more cheer?ful frame of mind by the unexpected
arrival of Dai-yu. He stayed for dinner with the others at Grandmother Jia’s. After
dinner everyone retired to their respective apart?ments, except for Aunt Xue, who
stayed the night in Grandmother Jia’s guest-room.
Bao-yu returned to Green Delights, and was divesting himself of his going-out clothes,
when suddenly he re?membered the cummerbund Jiang Yu-han had once given him
as a first-meeting present.
‘Do you remember that crimson cummerbund I gave you?’ he asked Aroma. ‘The
one you wouldn’t wear? Have you still got it?’
‘I’ve put it away somewhere. Why do you ask?’
‘Oh, I just wondered.’
‘Didn’t you hear what terrible trouble Mr Pan got into, all because he made friends
with such riffraff! Will you never learn? Haven’t you more sense than to go bringing
up a thing like that? Instead of filling your head with such stuff, what you should be
doing is quietly concentrating on your studies.’
‘Oh for goodness’ sake! I’m not the one that’s got into trouble! I just happened to
think of it, that’s all. I couldn’t care less whether you’ve still got it or not. If I’d known
you were going to start giving me a lecture...’
Aroma smiled.
‘I’m not giving you a lecture. It’s just that you know what people say about actors.
Now that you’re studying the classics and learning all the proper rules of behaviour,
you should try to conform and get on in the world. When your sweetheart comes
along, surely you’ll want to make a good impression then?’
‘Goodness!’ exclaimed Bao-yu, aroused by the mention of the word sweetheart,
‘that reminds me! There was such a crowd at Grannie’s, I didn’t have a chance to
speak to Cousin Lin, and she didn’t speak to me either. She left before I did, so she’s
probably home by now. I’ll be back in a minute.’
He was gone.
‘Don’t stay too long!’ Aroma called after him. ‘Now I’ve done it! I should never have
opened my mouth!’
Bao-yu did not reply, but made his way directly to the Naiad’s House, head bowed in
thought. On arrival there, he found Dai-yu at her table, poring over a book.
‘Have you been back long, coz?’ he asked, walking over and standing by her side.
‘As you were ignoring me,’ she said, returning his smile, ‘there was little point in my
staying...
He laughed.
‘Everyone was talking at once, and I couldn’t get a word in.’
Looking down at the page open in front of her, Bao-yu found that he couldn’t
understand a single character on it. Some of them seemed familiar, like the
characters for Peony and Vast; but on closer inspection he saw that even they had
been in some way changed. There was the char?acter for Hook, with a Five inside it,
and a Nine and Big on top; and there was a Five next to a Six, with Wood be?low and
another Five at the very bottom. It was all very puzzling.
‘You must be very advanced, to be able to decipher this esoteric script!’ he said.
Dai-yu gave a little ‘chee!’
‘Not much of a scholar really are you! Fancy never hav?ing seen a Qin tablature
before!’
‘It’s music! Of course! But why don’t I know any of the characters? Do you know
what they mean?’
‘No, of course not; that’s why I’m reading it...’
‘Do you really? I never knew you could play. Did you know about the Qins hanging
on the wall in the main lib?rary? There are quite a few. I remember the year before
last Father had a friend who was a Qin player - Antiquar?ian Ji I think be was called.
Father asked him to play a piece, but when he tried the instruments he said they
were none of them fit to play. He said that if Father really wanted to hear him play,
he would come back another day with his own instrument. But he never did. I think
he must have decided Father was tone-deaf. Well! So all this time you’ve been hiding
your light under a bushel!’
‘Oh no,’ replied Dai-yu. ‘I’m no good. It just happened that a day or two ago, when I
was feeling a little better, I was looking through my bookcase and came across an old
Qin Handbook. It seemed such a fine thing, and made such fascinating reading. It
began with a preface on the general philosophy of the Qin, which I found most
pro?found, and then it explained the technical side in great de?tail. I realized that
playing the Qin is a form of meditation and spiritual discipline handed down to us
from the ancients.
‘I had a few lessons when we lived in Yangchow, and made some progress. But
since then I’ve become so out of practice, and now my fingers are all "overgrown
with brambles", as they say! The first Qin Handbook I found only had the names of
the Airs, it didn’t have the words and music. But now I’ve found another with the
Airs written out in full. It’s so interesting! Of course, I realize that I shall never be able
to do justice to the score. To think what the great Master Musicians of the past could
do - like Master Kuang, whose playing could summon wind and thunder, dragon and
phoenix! And to think that Confucius could tell from his Music Master Xiang’s first
notes that he was listening to a musical portrait of King Wen! To play a Rhapsody of
Hills and Streams and share its inner meaning with a fellow music-lover...
Dai-yu fluttered her eyelids and slowly bowed her head.
Bao-yu was completely carried away:
‘Oh coz! How wonderful it all sounds! But I’m afraid I still don’t understand these
peculiar characters. Please teach me how to read some of them.’
‘I don’t need to teach you. It’s easy.’
‘But I’m such a fool! Please help me! Take that one there - all I can make out is
Hook, with Big on top and Five in the middle.’
Dai-yu laughed at him.
‘The Big and Nine on top mean you stop the string with the thumb of your left hand
at the ninth fret. The Hook and Five mean you hook the middle finger of your right
hand slightly and pull the fifth string towards you. So you see, it’s not what we would
call a character, it’s more a cluster of signs telling you what the next note is and how
to play it. It’s very easy. Then there are signs for all the graces - the narrow and the
wide vibrato, the rising and the falling glissando, the mordent,, the tremulo, the
falling glissando with open-string drone...’
Bao-yu was beside himself with joy.
‘As you understand it so perfectly, coz’, why don’t we start studying the Qin
together?’
 ‘The essence of the Qin,’ replied Dai-yu, (is restraint. It was created in ancient times
to help man purify himself and lead a gentle and sober life, to quell all wayward
pas?sions and to curb every riotous impulse. If you wish to play, then you must first

seek out a quiet chamber,
a studio with distant view,
or upper room;
or some secluded nook
‘mong rocks and trees,
on craggy mountain-top,
by water’s edge...
Let the weather be clear and calm, a gentle breeze, a moon?lit night. Light some
incense, and sit in silent meditation. Empty the mind of outward thoughts. Poise
Breath and Blood in Perfect Harmony. Your Soul may now com?mune with the Divine,
and enter into that mysterious Union with the Way.
‘As the ancients said, true music-lovers have always been few. If there is no one
able to share your music’s true delight, then sit alone, and

serenade the breeze and moonlight,
hymn the ancient pines
and weather-worn rocks;
let wild monkeys and venerable cranes
hear your song,

rather than the vulgar mob, whose dull ears would only sully the precious virtue of
the Qin.
‘So much for the setting. The next two essentials are finger-technique and touch.
And before you think of playing, be sure to dress in a suitable style - preferably in a
swansdown cape or other antique robe. Assume the dig?nified manner of the
ancients, a manner in keeping with the chosen instrument of the sages. Wash your
hands. Light the incense. Sit on the edge of your couch. Place the Qin on the table
before you, and sit with your chest opposite the fifth fret. Raise both hands slowly
and gracefully. You are now ready, in body and mind, to begin.
‘You must while playing observe carefully the dynamic markings - piano, forte,
allegro, adagio - and maintain a relaxed but serious manner at all times.’
‘Goodness me!’ cried Bao-yu. ‘I was thinking we could do it for fun! If it’s as
complicated as that, I’m not sure I’d be up to it!’
While they were talking Nightingale came in, and on seeing Bao-yu in the room,
inquired with a smile:
‘To what are we to attribute this joyful event, Master Bao?’
‘Cousin Dai has just been teaching me about the Qin. It’s as though scales had
fallen from my eyes! I could go on listening for ever!’
‘I didn’t mean that,’ said Nightingale. ‘What I meant was, it’s so rarely that we see
you at all nowadays, I won?dered if something out of the ordinary had happened to
bring you here today?’
‘I suppose it must seem like that,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘But the only reason I’ve not been
round more often is that I know Cousin Dai has not been well, and thought it best not
to trouble her. And then I’ve been having to go to school...’
‘Well,’ interrupted Nightingale, ‘Miss Lin has only just started to feel better, so don’t
you think you should let her rest now, and not wear her out giving you lessons?’
‘Why yes! How thoughtless of me!’ he exclaimed with a laugh. ‘I was so absorbed in
what she was saying, that it never entered my head she might be tiring herself.’
‘I wasn’t,’ said Dai-yu, smiling. ‘Talking about music doesn’t tire one, on the
contrary, it raises one’s spirits. I only wonder if what I was saying wasn’t beyond
you...’
‘It doesn’t matter,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m sure if we take it slowly I’ll be able to
understand.’
He stood up.
‘But seriously, I think I should leave you in peace now. Tomorrow I’ll ask Tan and Xi
if they’ll come over with me. You three can learn together. I think I’ll just sit in. ..’
‘Why, you lazy thing!’ laughed Dai-yu. ‘Imagine if we three did learn to play, and
you were as ignorant as ever; wouldn’t we then be casting our…’
She felt she was allowing herself to become too inti?mate, and suddenly stopped
short. Bao-yu only laughed:
‘I’d be happy just to hear you play. I’d do anything for that - even be your swine!’
Dai-yu blushed, but laughed nonetheless. Nightingale and Snowgoose laughed too.
Bao-yu took his leave, and had reached the door, when Ripple appeared, followed by
a junior maid bearing a small pot of orchid-plants.
‘Her Ladyship has been given four pots of these orchids,’ said Ripple, ‘and she
thought that, as she was so busy at the palace and wouldn’t have time to appreciate
them, she would give one to you, Master Bao, and one to you, Miss Lin.’
Dai-yu looked at the orchids. Among them were some of the double-headed kind,
and looking at these, she had a strange sensation that they meant something.
Whether it was joy or sorrow that they portended, she could not tell. But it was
something of importance. She stood staring at them, lost in thought.
Bao-yu’s mind, by contrast, was still full of vibratos and glissandos, and as he left he
said gaily:
‘Now that you have these orchids, coz, you’ll be able to compose your own Lonely
Qrchid Pavan. And I’m sure it will be just as good as the one Confucius wrote!’
Dai-yu’s heart was too troubled to respond to this part?ing jest. She walked indoors,
and staring once more at her orchids, thought to herself:
‘Flowers have their spring-time, a time for fresh blos?soms and young leaves. I am
young, but frail as the wil?low that dreads the first breath of autumn... If all turns out
for the best, I may grow stronger yet. But if not, my fate will be like that of the fallen
petals at spring’s end, driven by the rain and tossed in the wind
These sombre reflections brought tears to her eyes. Nightingale was puzzled to see
her cry. ‘Just now,’ she thought to herself, ‘when Master Bao was here, they were
both in such high spirits; and now look at her! And all she’s done is look at those
flowers!’
She was still trying in vain to think of some consolation to offer, when one of
Bao-chai’s serving-women came into the room. But if you wish to know the purpose
of her visit, you must read the next chapter.



‘59
CHAPTER 87



Autumnal sounds combine with sad remembrances
to inspire a composition on the Qin
And a flood of passion allows evil spirits
to disturb the serenity of Zen

The serving-woman was shown into the Naiad’s House. After paying her respects, she
delivered a letter for Dai-yu and was taken off to drink tea with the maids. Dai-yu
opened her letter. It was from Bao-chai, and began:
‘Dear Cousin,
Some malign star must surely have ruled the day of my birth! Misfortune pursues the
family at every
turn! Cousin Q in and I both fatherless; Mother advanced in years; to which add the
sounds of bestial ululation that now ema?nate from our inner apartments at every
hour of the day and night; and, to complete this recital of family woes, Brother Pan’s
recent and most cruel blow! Alas! We are indeed beset with howling winds and
torrential rains! As I lie awake at night, tossing on my bed, unable to master this grief,
my only consolation is the thought of a kindred spirit such as yours. Ah, dear Cousin!
You, I know, have the heart to share my present trials, as once you shared the joys of
that golden autumn, when harmony and convivial?ity prevailed. Then, united
beneath the aegis of the Crab-flower Club, we tasted crustacean delicacies and
contem?plated chrysanthemums. Once, I recall, you questioned the flowers thus:

"Who world disdainer, shares your hiding-place?
Of all the flowers, why do yours bloom so late?"

The lines never fail to rive my heart. For are not you and I late blooms, that tremble
at the approaching chill?
‘I have endeavoured to compose a lament in four stanzas, to express these feelings
of mine. I beg you, read it not as a piece of literary art, but as a simple vessel for my
tears.
Your Affectionate Cousin,
Bao-chai.’
The poem was attached.
Alas! the seasons turn, and turning bring once more
The chill of autumn to our joy-forsaken door.
We have a flower,
flos matris is its name,
Heartsease…
        Poor Mother! What art
can heal thy grief,
or ease thy heart?
My soul aches for thee.

    The scudding clouds
by biting autumn winds are blown;
The courtyard-walk
with withered leaves is thickly strewn.
Whither shall I go?
To whom shall I turn?
My love is gone,
And only an anguish
too deep for words
remains.
My heart is desolate.

The mighty sturgeon
has his pool;
The stork upon the dam
makes his habitation.
Fish in scaly armour,
Birds in serried plumes,
find protection.
In my distress
I question
that inscrutable expanse:
O bowels of earth!
O boundless sky!
Will ye not hearken to my cry?

Above, the twinkling Milky Way;
The air cold,
Slanting moonlight,
The water-clock
sunk past midnight.
My restless heart
grieves still;
I read once more this sad lament,
Before entrusting it to you,
My kindred soul and friend!

Dai-yu was deeply moved. ‘She knew I’d be able to understand!’ she thought to
herself. ‘That’s why she wrote to me rather than anyone else.’ She was lost in
thought, when a voice called from outside:
‘Is Cousin Lin at home?’
Refolding the letter, she replied in a somewhat distant tone:
‘Who’s that?’
Her visitors were already on their way into the room -- Tan-chun, Shi Xiang-yun and
the two Li sisters. The girls exchanged greetings, and Snowgoose served them with
tea. During the conversation that followed, Dai-yu found her thoughts turning back
to the gathering, two years ear?lier, at which they had written the chrysanthemum
poems:
‘Don’t you think it’s strange?’ she remarked to the others. ‘Since Cousin Chai
moved out of the Garden, she’s only been to see us a couple of times all together.
And now it seems as though nothing will induce her to come. I’m beginning to
wonder if she’ll ever visit us again.
Tan-chun smiled.
‘Of course she will! It’s just that at the moment things are a bit difficult: Cousin
Pan’s wife is rather a tricky sort of person, Aunt Xue is getting on in years, and with
this
latest trouble of Pan’s on top of everything else, Chai really is needed to look after
things at home. It’s not like the old days, when she was free to do as she pleased.’
As she spoke, they heard a sudden gust of wind outside, and a patter of falling leaves
against the paper-covered window. A faint scent drifted into the room. They all tried
to guess what flower it could be coming from.
‘It’s very like cassia-blossom,’ suggested Dai-yu.
Tan-chun laughed.
‘Still a southerner at heart! It’s the ninth month, long past cassia-time.’
Dai-yu smiled.
‘You’re right. But then I didn’t say it was, only very like...’
‘Anyway, Tan,’ Xiang-yun butted in, ‘you can’t talk. Don’t you know the lines:

The lotus fragrance drifts for miles,
The cassia blooms till autumn’s end?

In the South, the late-flowering cassia is at its best now. It’s just that you’ve never
seen it. If you ever have a chance to go to the South, you’ll be able to see it for
yourself.’
‘And what should I be doing in the South?’ retorted Tan-chun with a crushing smile.
‘Anyway, I knew all that ages ago, thanks very much...
The Li sisters grinned at each other.
‘You never know, Tan,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We are "fairy earthlings, fleet of foot", that’s
what the old proverb says. Here today, who knows where tomorrow. Take me, for
example. I was born a southerner, but here I am living in the North.’
Xiang-yun clapped her hands.
‘Well said! Dai’s got you there, Tan! And she’s not the only one to have had such an
experience. Look at the rest of us. Some of us are northerners, born and bred. Some
were born in the South but grew up in the North. And some grew up in the South
and then moved here later. And yet here we all are together. It’s our fate, you see.
People and places have an affinity. Their karma brings them together.’
They all nodded at Xiang-yun’s little discourse, except for Tan-chun who just smiled.
After chatting for a while longer, they got up to go. Dai-yu walked with them as far as
the door, and would have gone out, but they dis?suaded her:
‘You’ve only just started to feel better. If you come out now, you might catch a chill.’
So she stood in the doorway, said a few parting words, and watched the four of them
walk out of the courtyard gate.
When they had gone, she went indoors again and sat down. The birds were returning
to their nests; the sun was setting. With Xiang-yun’s words about the South still
ringing in her ears, Dai-yu drifted into a daydream. If her parents were still alive.. . If
she still lived in the South, that gentle land of spring flowers and autumn moonlight,
of limpid waters and luminous hills... How she would love to be there again, to visit
the Twenty Four Bridges in Yangchow and all the famous historical sites of Nanking!
In the South she would have plenty of servants of her own to wait on her. She could
do and speak as she pleased, sail in painted pleasure-boats and ride in perfumed
carriages, watch the fields of red apricot-blossom go by, spot the inn-signs through
the trees… She would be a young lady in her own right, not an outsider, dependent
on others for everything. However much the Jias did for her, she always felt the need
to be on her best behaviour. What wrong had she done in a previous incarnation to
deserve this lonely existence? Those words written in captivity by the last emperor of
Southern Tang –
              Here, all day long, I bathe my face in tears –
how well they expressed her own feelings! Her soul seemed transported to some
distant region.
When Nightingale came in, a single glance sufficed to tell her the cause of Dai-yu’s
‘absence’. She had been in the room when Xiang-yun was talking, and knew how
easily Dai-yu was upset by the slightest reference to the South.
‘I thought you might feel tired again, Miss,’ she said, ‘after all your visitors and such
a lot of talking, so I’ve just sent Snowgoose to the kitchen for a bowl of ham and
cab?bage broth, cooked with dried shrimps, dried seaweed and bamboo-shoots.
Doesn’t that sound good?’
‘I suppose so.’
‘And some congee?’
Dai-yu nodded.
‘I’d rather you and Snowgoose made the congee yourselves. Don’t have it done in
the kitchen.’
‘No Miss. You can never be sure how clean things are in the kitchen. We’ll cook the
congee ourselves. I asked Snowgoose to tell Cook Liu in the kitchen to take special
care with the soup. Cook Liu said we were not to worry, she’d see to it personally and
prepare it in her own room. Her daughter Fivey is going to keep an eye on it while it
simmers.
‘That’s not what I meant,’ replied Dai-yu. ‘I wasn’t complaining that the kitchen was
dirty. It’s just that I’ve been imposing on people for so long, and this illness of mine
has caused quite enough extra trouble as it is. With all these special orders for soup
and congee, I’m afraid I shall make myself unpopular.’
Her eyes were a tell-tale red.
‘ Oh Miss! You’re imagining things!’ protested Night?ingale. ‘You’re Her Old
Ladyship’s own granddaughter, the apple of her eye. A chance to serve you is
something people compete for, not grumble about.’
Dai-yu nodded thoughtfully.
‘By the way,’ she asked, ‘is that Fivey you mentioned the one who used to be
friendly with Parfumée when she was at Master Bao’s place?’
‘That’s right.’
‘Didn’t I hear that she might be going into service at Master Bao’s herself?’
‘Yes, she was. Then she fell ill, and by the time she was better again and ready to
start, there was all that trouble over Skybright, and it had to be put off.’
‘I’ve always liked the look of her,’ said Dai-yu.
Meanwhile a serving-woman had arrived with the soup, and Snowgoose went out to
fetch it.
‘Cook Liu says to tell Miss Lin this one’s been specially cooked in her room by her
Fivey,’ said the old woman, ‘so she won’t need to fuss about its riot being clean.’
Snowgoose said she would relay this message and car?ried the soup into the room.
Dai-yu, however, had already heard their conversation, and told Snowgoose to go
back at once and ask the woman to thank Mrs Liu on her return. Snowgoose did this,
and the old woman went on her way.
Snowgoose now laid out Dai-yu’s bowl and chopsticks on the table.
‘Would you like some of that dried turnip slaw we brought with us from the South,
Miss, if I mix a little sesame-oil and vinegar dressing with it?’
‘If you like. But don’t go to too much trouble.’
Snowgoose filled her bowl with congee. Dai-yu ate half and drank a couple of
spoonfuls of the soup. She put down her spoon, and the two maids cleared away the
things and cleaned the little table, which they then re?moved and replaced with the
one that usually stood there. Dai-yu rinsed her mouth and washed her hands.
‘Nightingale, have you put some incense on the brazier?’
‘I was just going to, Miss.’
‘You and Snowgoose have some of the soup and con-gee. They’re good and
wholesome. I’ll see to the incense.’
The maids went into the outer room to eat. Dai-yu put some more incense on the
brazier and sat down again. She was about to pick up a book to read when her
attention
was caught by the melancholy soughing of the wind through the trees outside. A long
sigh swept from one end of the Garden to the other. The metal wind-chimes started
jangling under the eaves.
Snowgoose was the first to finish her soup, and came in to see if there was anything
Dai-yu needed
‘It’s turning colder,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Have those fur clothes had a proper airing yet - the
ones I asked you to take out the other day?’
‘Yes, Miss.’
‘Bring them here, will you? I’d like something warm to put over my shoulders.’
Snowgoose went out and returned with a bundle of fur-lined clothes, wrapped in a
piece of felt. She undid the wrapper and held the clothes out for Dai-yu to choose
from. Da.i-yu noticed among the clothes another smaller bundle wrapped in silk. She
reached out a hand to pick it up, and untied the wrapper. Inside she found a pair of
silk handkerchiefs. She recognized them at once as the ones Bao-yu had secretly sent
her during his convalescence! There were the verses she had written on them! Even
the tear-stains could still be seen! And next to them in the little bundle were the
perfumed sachet she had embroidered for him (and half-demolished in a fit of pique),
the torn fan-case, and the snipped remains of the silken cord she had made for his
Magic Jade. Nightingale, in sorting out the clothes for airing, must have come across
these mementos in one of the chests, and slipped them into this bundle for safety.
Dai-yu seemed to have forgotten Snowgoose and the clothes entirely. She stood with
the handkerchiefs in her hands and stared at them as though entranced. As she read
the verses tears began to stream down her cheeks.
Nightingale came in, to find Snowgoose standing there dumbly, with the felt-wrapped
bundle of clothes still held out in front of her, while spread on the little table at
Dai?yu’s side were the sachet, fan-case and cord . Dai-yu was holding two faded
handkerchiefs with some writing on them, and was gazing at them in tears. As the
poet says:

Tokens of past estrangement
Catch the lover’s eye;
Fresh tears fall
On tears of days gone by.

Nightingale knew only too well the tender memories attached to each one of those
objects. She thought that sympathy would have little chance of success as a remedy,
and decided instead to administer a cheerful rebuke.
‘Come along now, Miss, what’s the sense in looking at things like that? They belong
to the past. You and Master Bao were children then. Goodness knows how many silly
tiffs you had! All smiles one minute, crying your hearts out the next. Thank goodness
you’re both older and have learned to take life a bit more seriously. You wouldn’t
dream of spoiling pretty things like these now would you?’
She had meant well. But her words only reminded Dai?yu of the old days with Bao-yu,
and released a fresh flood of tears. Nightingale tried again to cheer her up:
‘Come on now, Miss. Snowgoose is waiting. Please choose something to wear.’
Dai-yu let the handkerchiefs drop. Nightingale swiftly retrieved them, wrapped them
up again with the sachet and the other things, and put them away.
Finally Dai-yu draped one of the fur-lined jackets over her shoulders and walked
listlessly to the outer-room. She sat down, and looking round saw Bao-chai’s poem
and letter still lying on the table. She picked them up and reread them a couple of
times.
‘The feeling’s the same,’ she said to herself with a sigh, ‘even if our circumstances
are different. I should write something in reply. I’ll write four stanzas and set them to
an air for the Qin. Then tomorrow I can make a copy and send it to Chai.’
She told Snowgoose to bring in her brush and inkstone, which were on the table
outside, and moistening the ink, began to write. When she had completed four
stanzas, she took a Qin Handbook from her shelf and looked through it. She decided
to make a suite out of the two old melo?dies, Lonely Orchid Pavan and faintly Virtue.
Having done the pointing, she wrote out a copy of the words there and then to send
to Bao-chai, and asked Snowgoose to fetch the three-quarter size Qin she had
brought from home, which was stored in a trunk. She tuned the strings and did a few
preliminary finger-exercises. Her natural aptitude compensated for her lack of
practice, and it was not long before all that she had learnt as a child came back to her.
After playing for a while, seeing that it was already late in the night, she told
Snowgoose to put away the Qin, and went to bed. And so we must leave her.

*
One day Bao-yu, after completing his toilet, set off as usual with Tealeaf to go to
school. On their way they en?countered Inky, another of his page-boys, who came
bounding up to them with a broad grin on his face and announced:
‘Good news, Master Bao! The Preceptor’s not at school today, and you’ve all been
given the day off!’
‘Are you being serious?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘If you don’t believe me, take a look: isn’t that Master Huan and Young Master Lan
on their way back now?’
Bao-yu looked and sure enough there were his half-brother and young nephew
coming towards him with their contingent of pages, chatting away and giggling,
though he could not catch what it was they were saying. When they saw him, they
halted and stood with their arms respectfully at their sides.
‘Why have you come back from school so soon?’ Bao?-yu asked them.
‘The Preceptor is busy today,’ replied Huan, ‘and says we can all have the day off.
We’re to attend as usual tomorrow.’
Hearing this, Bao-yu turned about and, having reported the news to Grandmother Jia
and his father, returned to Green Delights.
Why are you back?’ asked Aroma.
He told her what had happened, and after sitting with her for a minute or two made
a move to go out again.
‘Where are you off to in such a hurry?’ she asked. ‘If you’ve been given the day off
school, that doesn’t mean you have to go charging about. You ought to make it a day
of rest.’
Bao-yu stopped in his tracks and hung his head.
‘I know you’re right. But when will I next have a chance to get out and have some
fun? Be a sport...
He said this in such an appealing tone of voice that Aroma relented.
‘All right,’ she said with a smile.
Meanwhile lunch had been brought in, and he had to stay and eat it. He bolted it
down, rinsed his mouth and was off. Fast as a puff of smoke he sped to the Naiad’s
House. He found Nightingale in the courtyard hanging handkerchiefs out to dry.
‘Has Miss Lin had her lunch yet?’ he asked.
‘She had half a bowl of congee earlier on,’ replied Nightingale, ‘but wasn’t feeling
very hungry. She’s sleep?ing at the moment. You’d better go somewhere else just
now, Master Bao, and come back a bit later.’
He left reluctantly, not knowing quite where to go. Suddenly it occurred to him that
he had not seen Xi-chun for several days, and he began strolling in the direction of
Smartweed Loggia. When he reached the courtyard and stood by one of the windows,
it all seemed very quiet and deserted. She too, he concluded, was having her nap and
not to be disturbed. He was about to leave when he heard a faint sound coming from
inside, too faint to identify. He stood still and listened again, in the hope of hearing it
more clearly. There it was! A distinct little tap! He was still trying to think what it
could be, when a voice said:
‘Why have you made that move, and not countered there?’
It was a game of Go! But Bao-yu did not have time to recognize the voice of the
speaker. He heard Xi-chun reply:
‘Why should I bother? If you take me there, I shall simply counter here, and if you
take me again I shall take you again. I shall still be one move ahead, and in the end I
shall be able to connect.’
‘And what if I take you here?’
‘Aiyo!’ exclaimed Xi-chun. ‘You had an inside counter?attack up your sleeve. I’m
defenceless.’
That other girl’s voice was so familiar! But he still couldn’t quite place it. It wasn’t one
of his cousins, he was sure of that. And yet Xi-chun was unlikely to be enter?taining
an outsider. Lifting the door-curtain very gently aside, he peeped in. The Go-partner
was none other than the nun from Green Bower Hermitage, the Dweller Beyond The
Threshold, Adamantina. He dared not in?trude any further. The girls were totally
absorbed in their game, and had neither of them noticed that they were being spied
upon. Bao-yu continued to stand there and watch. Adamantina leant low over the
board and said to Xi-chun:
‘Do you want to lose that whole corner?’
‘Of course not! It’s perfectly safe. All those pieces of yours are "dead"., aren’t
they?’
‘Are you sure? Go ahead and try.’
‘All right. There’s my move. Now let’s see what you can do.’
A smile crossed Adamantina’s face. She placed her next piece to link up with one she
already had on the edge of the board, and then pounced on one of Xi-chun’s pieces
and annihilated her entire corner. She laughed:
‘That’s called "Pulling Your Boots Off Upside Down"!’
Before Xi-chun had time to reply, their unobserved observer, unable to contain
himself any longer, burst out laughing. The two girls were startled out of their wits.
‘What do you mean by sneaking in here without saying a word?’ exclaimed Xi-chun.
‘What an ill-mannered way to behave, honestly! How long have you been there?’
‘I came in just as you started to play for that corner. I had to watch it out.’
He bowed to Adamantina.
‘Greetings, Reverend Sister!’ he said with a smile. ‘Wherefore this rare excursion
from the mystic portals of Zen? What karma brings thee to Maya’s dusty realm?’
She blushed from ear to ear, said nothing, lowered her head and stared at the
Go-board. Bao-yu could see that he had embarrassed her, and tried to make up for it.
‘Seriously,’ he said, with a charming smile, ‘how can common mortals compare
with those who, like you, have renounced the world? In the first place, you have
achieved inner peace. And with that peace comes a deep spiritual?ity. And with that
spirituality a clear insight
As he was speaking, Adamantina lifted her eyes a frac?tion and glanced at him. She
looked down again at once, and a deep flush spread slowly across her face. Bao-yu
realized that she was deliberately trying to ignore him, and sat down awkwardly
beside the table. Xi-chun wanted to continue the game, but after a silence
Adamantina said:
‘Let’s play another day.’
Having said this, she stood up, straightened out her dress and sat down again. Then,
turning to Bao-yu, she asked, in a zany tone of voice:
‘Where have you come from?’
It came as a great relief to Bao-yu that she should speak to him at all, and he was
grateful of the chance to remedy his earlier blunder. But then it suddenly struck him
that her question might not be as straightforward as it sounded. Was this one of her
Zen subtleties? He sat there tongue-tied and red in the face. Adamantina smiled and
turned to talk to Xi-chun. Xi-chun smiled too.
‘Cousin Bao,’ she said, ‘what’s so hard about that? Haven’t you heard the saying "I
come from whence I come"? To judge by the colour of your face anyone would think
you were among strangers. Don’t be shy!’
Adamantina seemed to take this banter personally. She experienced a strange stirring
of emotion, and her face grew hot. She knew she must be blushing again, and
be?came extremely flustered. Rising to her feet, she said:
‘I’ve been here a long time. I think I should be making my way back to the
Hermitage.’
Xi-chun knew the peculiarity of Adamantina’s tempera?ment and did not press her to
stay. She was showing her out, when Adamantina gave a little laugh and said:
‘It’s so long since I’ve been to see you, and the way home is so full of twists and
turns. I’m afraid of losing my way.
‘Pray allow me to be your guide!’ volunteered Bao-yu promptly.
‘I would be greatly honoured,’ she replied. ‘Please go ahead, Master Bao.’
The two of them said goodbye to Xi-chun and walked out of Smartweed Loggia. Their
winding path led them near the Naiad’s House, and as they approached they heard
strains of music in the air.
‘That’s a Qin,’ said Adamantina. ‘Where could it be coming from, I wonder?’
‘It must be Cousin Lin playing in her room,’ replied Bao-yu.
‘Really? Is that another of her accomplishments? I’ve never heard her mention it.
Bao-yu repeated what Dai-yu had told him. ‘Shall we go and watch?’ he suggested.
‘You mean listen, I suppose?’ said Adamantina. ‘One listens to the Qin. One never
watches.’
‘There you are!’ said Bao-yu with a grin. ‘I said I was a common sort of mortal.’
They had now reached a rockery close to the Naiad’s House. They sat down and
listened in silence, touched by the poignancy of the melody. Then a murmuring voice
began to chant:


‘Autumn deepens, and with it
      the wind’s bitter moan.
My love is far away; I mourn alone.
Gazing in vain
For a glimpse of home,
I stand at my balcony.
Tears bedew my gown.
After a brief pause, the chant began again:
‘Hills and lakes melt
into distant night.
Through my casement shines
the clear light
Of the moon
And the sleepless Milky Way.
My thin robe trembles
As wind and dew alight.’

There was another brief pause. Adamantina said to Bao?yu:
‘The first stanza rhymed on "moan", the second on "night". I wonder how the next
will rhyme?’
The chant began again from within:

                                ‘Fate denies you freedom,
                                      holds you bound;
                                Inflicting on me too
                                      a heavy wound.
In closest harmony
Our hearts resound;
In contemplation of the Ancients
Is solace to be found.’


‘That must be the end of the third stanza,’ said Ada?mantina. ‘How tragic it is!’
‘I don’t know anything about music,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But just from the way she sang, I
found it terribly sad.’
There was another pause, and they heard Dai-yu tuning her Qin.
‘That tonic B-flat of hers is too sharp for the scale,’ commented Adamantina.
The chanting began again:


‘Alas! this particle of dust,
the human soul,
Is only playing out
     a predetermined role.
Why grieve to watch
The Wheel of Karma turn?
A moonlike purity remains
My constant goal.’

As she listened, Adamantina turned pale with horror.
‘Just listen to the way she suddenly uses a sharpened fourth there! Her intonation
is enough to shatter bronze and stone! It’s much too sharp!’
‘What do you mean, too sharp?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘It will never take the strain.’
As they were talking, they heard a sudden twang and the tonic string snapped.
Adamantina stood up at once and began to walk away.
‘What’s the matter?’ asked Bao-vu.
‘You will find out in time. Please don’t say anything about this.’
She walked off, leaving Bao-yu in a state of great confu?sion. Eventually he too made
his way dejectedly home. And there our narrative leaves him.

*
Adamantina arrived back at Green Bower Hermitage to find the old lay-sisters waiting
for her return. They closed the gate after her and she sat with them for a while,
inton?ing her Zen breviary. They had dinner, and after dinner the incense braziers
were replenished. They all bowed be?fore the shrine of the Bodhisattva and the
women went off duty, leaving Adamantina alone. Her couch and back-rest were set
out for her. Sitting cross-legged, she first reg?ulated her breathing and closed her
eyes. Then, cleansed of all wayward thoughts, her mind began to soar towards the
realm of higher truth. She sat in meditation until well after midnight, when she was
disturbed by a sudden clat?tering sound on the roof. Afraid there might be burglars
about, she rose from her couch and went into the front hall. Looking out, all she
could see were long clouds that stretched across the sky, and the moon shining
through a watery haze. It was a mild night, and she stayed there for a while, leaning
over the balustrade.
Suddenly two cats started wailing to each other on the roof above her head. The
words Bao-yu had spoken to her that afternoon came flashing into her mind. She felt
an in?voluntary racing of the heart, her ears burned. Making a determined effort to
compose herself, she went back into her meditation room and sat down again on her
couch. Her efforts were in vain. Something was overpowering her. She felt ten
thousand horses stampeding through her head. The couch itself seemed to start
swaying, and her body seemed to leave the Hermitage. She was surrounded by
handsome young noblemen, all asking for her hand in marriage. There were
matchmakers hustling her towards a bridal carriage against her will. Then the scene
changed again. Now she was being kidnapped. A gang of ruffians with swords and
clubs was threatening her, mauling her. She started screaming for help.
By now the old nuns and lay-sisters were wide awake, and had come hurrying into
the hall with candles to dis?cover the cause of the disturbance. They found her lying
on the ground, with her arms outstretched, frothing at the mouth. She was woken
from this apparent coma, only to fix her eyes into a rigid stare and cry out, her
cheeks burn?ing a fierce crimson:
‘Buddha is my Protector! Don’t touch me, you ruffians!’
The women were too scared to do anything but call out:
‘Wake up! Wake up! We’re here now!’
‘I want to go home!’ replied Adamantina. ‘Who’ll be my friend and take me home?’
‘But this is your home!’
While the others stayed talking to her, one of the nuns was sent to pray at the shrine
of the Goddess of Mercy. She shook the bamboo-box of tallies kept by the altar, and
on consulting the relevant passage in the divination-book read that the Yin spirit of
the south-west corner had been offended.
‘ Of course!’ exclaimed one of the others, when she re?ported back. ‘The
south-west corner of the Garden was originally uninhabited, so it would be sure to
contain a high concentration of Yin essence.’
Some busied themselves making soup, others brought water. One of the nuns, who
had come with Adaniantina from the South and was for that reason closer and more
devoted to her than the others, sat next to her on the couch and put her arms
protectively round her. Adaman?tina turned her head:
‘Who’s that?’
‘It’s only me.’
Adamantina looked at her curiously for a minute.
‘Oh it really is!’ she cried, and flung her arms round the nun, sobbing hysterically.
‘Oh Mother, save me, or I’m going to die!’
The nun called out to her in an attempt to bring her to her senses, and began to
massage her gently. The old women brought in tea, and they sat up together till
dawn when finally Adamantina dozed off. The nun sent for the doctor, and several
doctors came and took her pulses. There were as many differing diagnoses as there
were doc?tors. Excessive worry damaging the spleen; phlogistic in?trusion into the
haematic system; offence caused to an evil spirit; a combination of internal and
external chill. None of these seemed conclusive. Finally a doctor came whose first
question after reading her pulses was:
‘Did the young lady practise meditation?’
The women informed him that it was a regular thing
with her.
‘And did this illness develop quite suddenly last night?’
‘Yes, it did.’
‘Indubitably a case of heat in the cardiac orb affording entrance to a vagrant evil
spirit.’
‘Will she be all right?’
Luckily the meditation does not seem to have been too far advanced and the spirit
was therefore not able to pene?trate too deeply. She will most probably recover.’
He wrote out a prescription for the Dephlogistication of the Cardiac Orb, after one
dose of which Adamantina began to show signs of improvement.
News of her attack soon spread, and it became a sublect of gossip for the lads in
town. ‘All that chastity and religion was bound to be too much for a girl of her age.
Especially such an attractive, lively thing... Sooner or later she’ll get soft on some
lucky fellow and run away.’
A few days later Adamantina was slightly better. But her concentration seemed to
have gone and she often found herself drifting off into a dreamlike state.
The news did not reach Xi-chun for a few days. She was sitting in her room when
Landscape came hurrying in.
‘Miss, have you heard what’s happened to Sister Adamantina?’
‘No - what is it?’
‘I heard Miss Xing and Mrs Zhu talking about it yester?day. Remember that day she
was here playing Go? Apparently that very night she had a fit. She was talking about
bandits trying to carry her away and all sorts of other strange things. She still hasn’t
quite recovered. Don’t you think it’s peculiar?’
Xi-chun thought silently to herself:
 ‘So for all her fastidious purity, Addie’s worldly karma is still not complete. If only I
had been born into a differ?ent family! If only I were free to become a nun! I would
never be tempted by evil spirits. I know I would be able to subdue every unholy
thought and achieve total detach?ment from the world and all its entanglements.’
With this thought she experienced a sudden sense of illumination, which she tried to
express in the following g?tha:

Since at first there was no space,
Things can have no proper place.
From Void all comes;
To Void must all return.

She told a maid to light some incense, and meditated for a while. Then she took
down her Go Handbook and began looking through it, studying the tactics 6f such
famous Go Masters of old as Kong Rong and Wang Ji-xin. There was ‘Crab Wrapped in
Lotus Leaves’, and ‘Golden Oriole Strikes Hare’; but she found neither of these very
impres?sive, and ‘Corner Kill in Thirty Six Moves’ she found too hard to understand
and harder still to remember. It was Dragon-chain of Ten Galloping Horses’ that really
caught her fancy. She was still working it out, when she heard someone come into
the courtyard and call out:
‘Landscape!’
But to know who this visitor was, you must turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 88



Bao-yu gratifies his grandmother
by praising a fatherless child
Cousin Zhen rectifies family discipline
by chastising two unruly servants



Xi-chun was puzzling over her Go Handbook when she heard someone calling
outside:
‘Landscape!’
She recognized the voice as Faithful’s. Landscape went out into the courtyard, and
reappeared with Faithful, fol?lowed by a younger maid carrying a small parcel
wrapped in yellow silk.
‘What’s that?’ asked Xi-chun, her curiosity aroused. Faithful explained.
‘Next year is Her Old Ladyship’s eighty-first birthday, and since eighty-one is nine
times nine, she has pledged herself to hold a nine-day mass, and to have three
thousand six hundred and fifty-one copies made of the Sutra of the Immaculate
Diamond. That has all been handed out to copyists. But there is a popular saying: "If
the Diamond Sutra is the outer shell of the magic, its core is the Sutra of the Heart of
Wisdom." In other words, to enhance one’s merit, one should slip in a Heart Sutra
too. So now Her Old Ladyship wants copies of that as well, and because of its greater
importance as scripture and its connection with Our Lady of Mercy, she wants three
hundred and sixty-five copies to be done by the young ladies and young mistresses of
the family. Apart from Mrs Lian, who’s too busy running the household, and can’t
write anyway, all the ladies that can write at all are being given a share in this act of
piety and devotion, even Mrs Zhen and Mr Zhen’s other ladies in the Eastern
Mansion. Of course, everyone in the inner family will be expected to take part.’
Xi-chun nodded.
‘Sutra-copying is one thing I can do with conviction. Leave it there, will you? Would
you like some tea?’ Faith?ful deposited the little package on the table, and sat down
with Xi-chun, while Landscape poured her a cup of tea.
‘Will you be doing some copying too?’ asked Xi-chun with a smile.
‘Don’t tease, Miss!’ answered Faithful. ‘Three or four years ago I might have,
perhaps. But I’m so out of prac?tice now. When did you last see me with a brush in
my hand?’
‘But think of the merit you’d acquire.’
‘I’ve already seen to that,’ replied Faithful. ‘Every day, after settling Her Old
Ladyship down to sleep, I’ve been saying Lord Buddha’s name and counting my
"Buddha Rice". I’ve been collecting the rice-grains for more than three years and
putting them by for just such an occasion as this, to dedicate them to Buddha and
add my contribu?tion, my little act of charity and devotion, to Her Old Ladyship’s.’
‘It sounds as if when Lady Jia becomes Our Lady of Mercy,’ said Xi-chun, ‘you’ll have
to be her inseparable companion, the Dragon King’s daughter!’
‘Oh no, Miss!’ protested Faithful. ‘That’s too grand for me. It is true though, I could
never serve anyone but Her Old Ladyship. I must be bound to her by some karma
from a past life.’
With these words Faithful rose to leave, bidding the younger maid untie the little
parcel, and exhibiting its contents to Xi-chun.
‘This roll of plain paper is to be used for the sutra. And while you write,’ she went
on, handing her a bundle of Tibetan incense-sticks, ‘you are to light one of these.’
Xi-chun nodded, and Faithful returned with the other maid to Grandmother Jia’s
apartment, where she reported on her errand and stood watching the game of
backgam?mon that was in progress between the old lady and Li Wan. Li Wan with
her next throw removed several of Grandmother Jia’s pins to the bar, and Faithful
had difficulty in keeping. a straight face.
They were presently distracted from their game by the arrival of Bao-yu, carrying in
each hand a little bamboo-splint cage containing crickets.
‘I heard you weren’t sleeping very well, Grannie,’ he said, ‘so I brought you these to
help you relax.’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘You naughty boy! Just because your father’s not at home...’
When he protested his innocence, Grandmother J ia asked:
‘Why aren’t you at school then? What are you up to with those things anyway?’
‘They weren’t my idea, Grannie,’ explained Bao-yu. ‘What happened was that a day
or two ago Huan and Lan each had a couplet to complete in class, and as Huan got
stuck, I whispered something to help him out. When he recited it, the Preceptor was
impressed and praised him highly for it. Huan bought me the crickets as a thank-you
present. I should like to give them to you.’
‘Hasn’t that boy been doing any work, for heaven’s sake!’ exclaimed Grandmother
Jia. ‘Surely he can manage a couplet on his own? If not, then he deserves a good
spanking from the Preceptor. It might teach him a thing or two. As for you, have you
forgotten the state you got into when your father was at home and asked you for a
few lines of verse? Don’t you go getting too full of yourself now. What a little rascal
that Huan is! To go begging for help, and then look around for a nice present to
butter you up with! He certainly seems precocious enough when it comes to cheating
- he should be ashamed of himself! Heaven alone knows how he’ll turn out when he
grows up...’
A ripple of laughter spread through the room.
‘But tell me about young Lan,’ went on Grandmother Jia. ‘How did he manage? As
the youngest, strictly speak?ing he should have been helped by Huan...’
Bao-yu detected the note of sarcasm in her voice and laughed.
‘Oh no! He didn’t need any help. He could manage on his own.’
‘I don’t believe you!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It was you at your tricks again, I’ll be
bound. Hark at you! A camel among sheep! Just because you re so grown-up now,
and so good at your compositions...’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘No, seriously, Lan managed perfectly well on his own. The Preceptor was very
pleased and said he had a brilliant future ahead of him. If you don’t believe me,
Grannie, send for him and test him yourself.’
‘If that is the truth,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘then I am overjoyed to hear it.. But I
have a feeling that you are making it all up. If he really can do such things at his age,
he may well distinguish himself when he grows up.
She looked at Li Wan, and thought of Lan’s father Jia Zhu.
‘What a consolation that would be for your elder brother’s death,’ she went on,
addressing Bao-yu again. ‘And what a well-earned reward for all his mother’s efforts
in bringing him up! In time he will be a pillar of support to the family, as his father
would have been!’
The thought brought tears to her eyes. Li Wan was also moved, but seeing the old
lady becoming somewhat emo?tional, she checked her own tears and said with a
brave smile:
‘Whatever good fortune we may enjoy, Grannie, we owe it all to you. I only pray
that Lan will live up to your expectations and bring fortune to the whole family. His
progress should be a source of joy. Please don’t go upset?ting yourself.’
She turned to Bao-yu.
‘And please don’t you go giving him exaggerated ideas of his achievements, Bao. He
is only a child, remember. He may take you seriously and not realize that you are only
trying to encourage him; and then he will become proud and conceited and never do
well.’
‘Well said, my dear,’ commented Grandmother Jia. ‘But remember too that he is
still very young and should not be driven too hard. Children only have a certain
amount of strength. Push them too soon and you can ruin them. Then they may
never be able to study properly, and all your efforts will have been in vain.
Li Wan could contain herself no longer and burst into floods of tears. As she was
hurriedly drying her eyes, Jia Huan and Jia Lan came into the room to pay their
evening respects to Grandmother Jia. Lan then greeted his mother and returned to
stand respectfully at his great-grandmother’s side.
‘I have just been hearing from your uncle Bao,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘how well you
did with your couplet, and what praises you won from the Preceptor.’
Lan smiled modestly. Faithful now came over to say that dinner was ready.
‘I want to invite Mrs Xue,’ said Grandmother Jia, and Amber promptly sent a maid
over to Lady Wang’s apart?ment. Bao-yu and Jia Huan withdrew from the room,
while Li Wan’s maid Candida and the younger maids came forward to clear away the
backgammon pieces. Li Wan stayed to wait on Grandmother Jia, and Jia Lan stood at
his mother’s side.
‘The two of you can stay to dinner with me,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Yes Grandmother,’ replied Li Wan. A minute or two later dinner was brought in,
and the maid returned from Lady Wang’s apartment with the following message:
‘Her Ladyship says that Mrs Xue will not be able to come. She was only over on a
short visit and went home after lunch.’
Grandmother Jia told Jia Lan to occupy the seat next to her. Our narrative omits any
further details of that eve?ning’s meal. After dinner, when she had washed her hands
and rinsed her mouth, Grandmother Jia reclined on her couch and chatted idly with
her granddaughter-in-law and great-grandson. A junior maid came in and asked
Amber to say that Mr Zhen (who, in the temporary absence of Jia Zheng and Jia Lian,
had that day been supervising busi?ness at Rong-guo House) was waiting outside to
pay his evening respects.
‘Tell him that I have been informed,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘but that he need not
bother to come in. He can go home and rest. He must be tired after the day’s work.’
The maid relayed this to the old women outside, Cousin Zhen was informed, and
returned to Ning-guo House.
*
The following day he came over again to Rong-guo House, to see to the day’s
business. After the pages on the gate had produced a series of miscellaneous matters
for his attention, it was reported by another page that the farm-bailiff had arrived
with the seasonal produce. Cousin Zhen asked to see the inventory, which was
presented to him by the page, and he proceeded to read through the various items,
mostly fresh fruit, with some game and vegetables.
‘Who usually looks after this department?’ asked Cousin Zhen.
‘Zhou Rui, sir.’
Zhou Rui was summoned and Cousin Zhen instructed him:
‘Check through all the items on this list and have them delivered. Have a copy
made for my reference. And tell the kitchen to cook some extra dishes when they are
pre?paring lunch for the servants. The bailiff is to have some?thing to eat before he
goes, and the usual tip.’
‘Yes sir.’
Zhou Rui told the servants to carry the goods into Xi-feng’s courtyard, and gave
instructions for them to be checked against the inventory. Then he went off, only to
reappear shortly afterwards before Cousin Zhen:
‘Excuse me sir, have you checked the entries yet?’
‘Do you think I have time to do that?’ replied Cousin Zhen impatiently. ‘I have given
you the list and leave the matter entirely in your hands.’
‘I have checked all the items through to the best of my ability sir, and everything
seems in order. But perhaps you would like to send for the bailiff, as you have a copy
yourself, to make sure the list is genuine.
‘What a lot of fuss over a bit of fruit!’ exclaimed Cousin Zhen. ‘It’s really not that
important. I take your word for it.
At this moment Bao Er came into the room and kotowed to Cousin Zhen. (This Bao Er,
it may be remem?bered, was the servant who had in the past been useful to both
Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian. On this occasion he had come over for the day to assist
Cousin Zhen.)
‘I beg to be released, sir,’ he said, ‘and put back on external duties.’
‘What is the meaning of this?’ asked Cousin Zhen, addressing Bao Er and Zhou Rui
simultaneously.
‘What’s the point of my being here if no one listens to my opinion?’ replied Bao Er.
‘Who asked for your opinion?’ said Cousin Zhen brusquely.
‘I’m tired of spying for other people!’ muttered Bao Er to himself.
‘Sir,’ put in Zhou Rui promptly, ‘I have been in charge of farm rents and income here
for years, and on average I should say around four hundred thousand taels’ worth
passes through my hands each year, and I have never had a word of complaint from
the Master or their Ladyships or the young mistresses about anything, let alone such
a small matter as this. According to him, we are supposed to have made off with the
family’s entire property and estates!’
‘It looks as if Bao Er has started some sort of quarrel,’ thought Cousin Zhen to
himself. ‘Better get rid of him.’
‘Out of my sight!’ he barked. Then turning from Bao Er to Zhou Rui:
‘That is all. Carry on with your work.’
The two servants left.
Not long afterwards Cousin Zhen was resting in the study when he heard the most
terrific din break out in the direction of the main gate. He sent a servant to inquire,
who came back to report that a fight had started between Bao Er and an adopted son
of Zhou Rui’s.
‘Who is this adopted son?’ asked Cousin Zhen.
‘He San is his name, sir,’ replied the servant. ‘A worth?less fellow who spends most
of his time drinking and causing trouble. He sometimes comes round here and hangs
about in the porter’s lodge. Apparently he got involved in the argument between Bao
Er and Zhou Rui.’
‘This is the limit!’ exclaimed Cousin Zhen. ‘Have Bao Er and this He San character
bound immediately! What about Zhou Rui?’
‘He disappeared when the fighting started, sir.
‘Find him at once! This is preposterous!’
‘Yes, sir!’
In the midst of this commotion, Jia Lian returned and Cousin Zhen told him what had
happened in his absence.
‘What next!’ cried Lian. He sent an extra servant to help apprehend Zhou Rui, who
soon realized that escape was impossible, gave himself up and was led before the
masters.
‘Tie him up as well!’ ordered Cousin Zhen, and Jia Lian added, addressing himself
principally to Zhou Rui:
‘Mr Zhen settled your petty differences once and for all. Why go out and start
fighting all over again? And as if that wasn’t bad enough, you have to drag in this brat
of yours, He San! And when you should have been bringing them to heel, you
disappear and leave them to it!’
He dealt Zhou Rui a few hefty kicks.
‘It’s no good punishing only him,’ said Cousin Zhen grimly, and ordered his men to
give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each and send them packing. This done, he and Jia
Lian sat down to discuss family business.
In the servants’ quarters this incident became the subject of many a private exchange
of opinions. Some saw it as an attempt on Cousin Zhen’s part to cover up for
incompe?tence; others said he was just inept at handling people; while others saw it
as yet another instance of his un?pleasant character. ‘Wasn’t it he who
recommended Bao Er to Mr Lian in that sordid business with the You sisters? What’s
probably happened is that Bao Er’s wife won’t oblige Mr Zhen as she did Mr Lian, so
now he’s taken it out on the husband...’ There were many differing interpretations.

Meanwhile the Jia clan lost no time in turning Jia Zheng’s promotion at the Ministry
of Works to their financial advantage. Jia Yun was certainly not going to be left out,
but went around promising work to contractors (and negotiating percentages for
himself), and having bought a quantity of fashionable embroideries, made his way to
the apartment of his erstwhile patroness.
Xi-feng, who had just learnt from one of her maids that ‘Mr Zhen and Mr Lian were in
a temper and beating the servants’, was on the point of sending someone to discover
the details when she saw Jia Lian himself walk in, and was able to hear the full story
from him.
‘It may all have been over a trifle,’ she commented, ‘but we must put a stop to such
behaviour at all costs’. If they think they can get away with it now, when the family
for?tunes are supposed to be flourishing, what is going to hap?pen when the
younger generation takes over? They’ll have a mutiny on their hands. I remember a
year or so ago wit?nessing the most appalling scene at Ning-guo House - Big Jiao
sprawled all over the steps, blind drunk and swearing sixteen to the dozen. None of
us was spared. I don’t care if he has rendered distinguished services in the past.
Ser?vants should know their place, and show a proper sense of respect. The trouble
with Cousin Zhen’s wife - please don’t misunderstand me - is that she is much too
unsus?pecting and lets her staff get away with anything. This Bao Er of theirs - or
whatever his name is - is typical. Come to think of it, hasn’t he been rather useful to
you and Zhen in the past? Aren’t you being a bit ungrateful to start flogging him
now?:
Stung to the quick, Jia Lian sheepishly tried to change the subject. Presently he
remembered a pressing engage?ment and left.
Crimson now came in to report the arrival of Jia Yun.
‘I wonder what he’s after this time?’ mused Xi-feng to herself. Then aloud to
Crimson:
‘You’d better show him in.’
Crimson went out. She looked Jia Yun in the face and gave him a cheeky smile. He
(swift on the uptake as ever) advanced towards her and said:
‘Did you tell Mrs Lian that I was here, Miss Crimson?’
She blushed.
‘I suppose you have a lot of important business, Mr Yun...’
‘On the contrary, I only wish I had had cause to come here and trouble you more
often, Miss Crimson... I remember last year when you were employed at Uncle
Bao’s…’
He was about to say more but Crimson, who was afraid someone might interrupt
them, asked in haste:
‘Did you ever get my handkerchief?’
Her words provoked Jia Yun to such a pitch of excite?ment that he was ready to burst.
But before he could say a word a maid came out from Xi-feng’s room, and he and
Crimson were obliged to go in together at once. They walked side by side, close
enough for him to whisper:
‘When I leave, be sure to see me out. I’ve something to tell you that might amuse
you...
She blushed fiercely and flashed her eyes at him without a word. Going ahead to
inform Xi-feng of his approach, she returned to usher him in, lifting the door-curtain
and beckoning to him, while announcing in her most formal tone of voice:
‘Madam will be pleased to see you now, sir.’
With a smile Jia Yun advanced with her into the room and greeted Xi-feng. He
conveyed his mother’s regards, which Xi-feng returned politely before asking:
‘And what brings you here today?’
Jia Yun embarked upon his speech:
Auntie’s great kindness to me in the past has been ever present in my mind and a
source of endless gratification. I have been awaiting an opportunity to present a
token of my esteem and have only held back for fear that you might consider such a
gesture inappropriate. The forth?coming Double Ninth Festival finally seemed
sufficient justification for my purchasing a little something which, though I know you
have more than enough of everything here already, I humbly pray you to do me the
honour of accepting as an earnest of my humble devotion.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Come on. Cut the cackle. What’s it all about? Sit down and tell me.’
Jia Yun took a perch and deposited his offering gingerly with both hands on the
surface of an adjacent table.
‘I know you’re pretty hard up,’ Xi-feng went on, ‘so why go spending money like this?
I have no need of such things and don’t expect them. Come on now, tell me what you
have really come for.’
‘Truly for no other reason than my deep and hitherto unexpressed sense of
gratitude...’
There was however by now a trace of a smile.
‘Come off it,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I am perfectly familiar with the state of your finances.
Don’t expect me to go taking things from you for nothing. If you want me to accept
your present then tell me the truth. If you carry on beat?ing about the bush like this,
I shall certainly not accept anything from you.’
Jia Yun was forced to come to the point. He rose to his feet and donned his most
obsequious smile.
‘I did entertain one modest and I trust not altogether unreasonable hope. It
reached my ears a few days ago that Sir Zheng had been given the overall supervision
of mausoleum construction at the Ministry, and as I have one or two friends with
considerable experience in that line -extremely competent people, I might add - I
would just like to ask if it would be at all possible for you to put in a word for them
with Sir Zheng. If a job or two were to come their way I should be indebted to you for
eternity. And need I add that my own services are always at your disposal should
anything materialize in the way of work here at the mansion.
‘In most matters I know I have a certain amount of in?fluence,’ replied Xi-feng. ‘But
when it comes to this sort of thing, the major contracts are completely in the pockets
of the President and other senior officials, while the small?er jobs are handed out by
the clerks and runners. No one else gets so much as a look in, I’m afraid. Our own
people can only work for Sir Zheng as his personal staff. Even your uncle Lian only
goes in when there’s something directly connected with the family. He has nothing to
do with official business. At home, as soon as things are patched up in one place they
break out in another - even Mr Zhen can’t keep order properly. A junior like you
would never be able to cope. No, I’m afraid whatever jobs there might have been at
the Ministry have nearly all gone. People are desperate for work. Surely there’s
something you can turn your hand to at home, to keep body and soul together? I’m
being serious. Go home and think it over. As for your gratitude, consider it expressed.
And take these things back to wherever they came from.’
While she was speaking, a group of nannies had come into the room with little
Qiao-jie, dressed in a colourfully embroidered smock and clutching an armful of toys.
She went running over to her mother, laughing and prattling away, and J ia Yun stood
up once more and swiftly transferred his attentions and unctuous smiles from Xi-feng
to her daughter.
‘So this is my respected cousin? Now is there any little present you would like me
to get you, dearie?’
A loud Waaah! burst from Qiao-jie’s lips and Jia Yun retreated hastily.
‘There, there, my darling! Come here!’ Xi-feng held the child closely to her. ‘This is
your cousin Yun. Don’t be shy.’
Jia Yun tried again.
‘What a sweet little girl! Such a pretty face promises a lifetime of happiness.’
Qiao-jie turned her little head to take another peep at him and immediately burst out
crying again. Jia Yun sensed that he was no longer welcome and rose to leave.
‘Don’t forget your things,’ insisted Xi-feng.
‘Oh please, Aunt Feng! Do me this one favour...’
‘If you don’t take them yourself, I shall send someone after you with them.
Honestly Yun, this is not the way to go about things. You are not a stranger here. If
something crops up I will certainly let you know. Until then there is nothing I can do,
and there is nothing to be gained by wasting your time and money like this.’
Jia Yun could see that she was not going to relent. His face flushed as he took his
leave.
‘I shall nevertheless continue to search for an acceptable present.’
‘Crimson, carry these things to the hall for Mr Yun,’ said Xi-feng curtly, ‘and see him
out.’
‘People are right,’ thought Yun to himself on his way out. ‘She’s a real tyrant! Won’t
budge an inch! Hard as nails! Serves her right if she can’t produce an heir. That little
girl of hers gave me a queer feeling too... She seemed to take against me, almost as if
we had some feud from a past life. What damnable luck! All that work for nothing!’
His rebuff came as a disappointment to Crimson too,
who picked up the parcel and followed him out. He took it from her and, when no
one was looking, undid the wrapping, took out a couple of pieces of embroidery and
gave them to her. At first she would not accept them and protested under her breath:
‘You shouldn’t, Mr Yun. Think how dreadful it would look for both of us if Mrs Lian
found out.’
‘Don’t be silly. Keep them. She’ll never know. If you don’t, I’ll take it as a personal
insult.’
Crimson smiled vainly and took them from him.
‘If you insist. But I don’t want them. I really don’t know what to think...’
Her face was burning again. Jia Yun laughed, and said:
‘It’s the thought that counts...’
By now they had reached the inner gate and Jia Yun concealed the remaining gifts
inside his gown while Crimson urged him on his way.
‘You must go now,’ she said. ‘If ever you want any?thing here, contact me. Now
that I’m in service with Mrs Lian, you can approach me directly.’
Yun shook his head bitterly.
‘She’s too much of a tyrant. I shan’t be coming back in a hurry. Don’t forget what I
said just now though. If I do have a chance to see you again, I’ve more to tell you.’
Crimson blushed from ear to ear.
‘You’d really better go now. Come again as often as you like. If you’ve become
distant from Mrs Lian, you’ve only yourself to blame.
‘All right, I understand.’
Jia Yun went on his way and Crimson stood in the gateway, - following him into the
distance with a thought?ful gaze. Then she turned and werit inside again.
Xi-feng meanwhile was giving instructions for her din?ner, and asked the maids if
they had cooked her congee. They hurried off to inquire, and returned after a short
while to report that the congee was ready.
‘I should like a couple of dishes of those pickled vege?tables that have just come up
from the South, to go with it,, Xi-feng said. Autumn took charge of this and detailed
the other maids to proceed with service. Patience came in and said with a smile:
‘There’s something I forgot to mention earlier, ma’am. At midday, while you were
over at Her Old Ladyship’s, one of the prioress’s women from Water-moon Priory
came to see you, to ask for a couple of jars of southern pickle and for an advance of a
few months’ allowance. The prioress has been in poor health, she told me. I asked
what the matter was, and she said it had all started four or five days ago. She had
been having trouble with some of the Buddhist and Taoist novices at the Priory, who
despite several warnings kept leaving their lights on at night. Then one night she
noticed the lamps still burning at midnight, and called to them several times. Hearing
n6 reply and thinking that they must have fallen asleep with their lights on, she went
herself to put them out. When she came back to her room, the strangest thing
happened: she saw a man and a woman sitting together on the kang, and when she
asked them who they were, had a noose slipped round her neck by way of reply. Her
cries for help aroused the other sisters, who lit their lamps and came hurrying to the
scene to find her prostrate on the floor and foaming at the mouth. Thank heavens
they managed to bring her round. She still cannot eat proper meals, which is why she
thought of asking for some pickles. Since you were not in) I felt I could hardly give her
any on my own authority, so I explained where you were, said that I would mention it
to you later, and sent her back to the Priory. I should have forgotten all about it if I
hadn’t heard you asking for pickles just now yourself.’
Xi-feng stared thoughtfully for a moment.
‘There’s no shortage of pickles,’ she said at last. ‘Send her some by all means. You
can see Mr Qin in a day or two about the money.’
As she was speaking, Crimson came in to report the
arrival of a messenger from Jia Lian. Business had de?tained him out of town, and he
would not be back that night. This had received a perfunctory acknowledgement
from Xi-feng, when suddenly there was a burst of crying from the back of the house
and one of the junior maids came running breathlessly into the courtyard. Patience
was already there and now several of the other maids gathered round and began
whispering among themselves.
‘What’s going on out there.?’ asked Xi-feng.
‘One of the maids has had a bit of a fright,’ replied Patience. ‘She says she’s seen a
ghost or something...’
‘Which maid?’ asked Xi-feng sharply. The maid in question entered the room.
‘What’s all this nonsense about ghosts?’ asked Xi-feng.
‘I was out at the back just now, ma’am,’ replied the maid, ‘asking one of the women
for more charcoal to put on the braziers, when I heard this eerie noise coming from
that small empty building. At first I thought it was just a cat chasing a mouse, but
then I .heard it go whee like somebody sighing. I was very frightened and came
run?ning back.’
‘Stupid creature!’ snapped Xi-feng. ‘I won’t have people talking such superstitious
nonsense in my presence! I’ve never believed in such things. Go on - get out of my
sight!’
The maid fled. Xi-feng sent for Sunshine and checked through the day’s remaining
accounts. It was nearly nine o clock by the time they finished. She and the others sat
for a while chatting, and then she sent the servants off duty for the night and went to
bed herself. Just before eleven o’clock she was lying in bed still half-asleep, when
suddenly her flesh begin to creep and she awoke with. a start. She lay there
trembling in ever-increasing terror until she could bear it no longer, and called
Patience and Autumn to come over and keep her com p any. Neither of them could
understand the strange state slie was in.
Autumn had originally been rather hostile to Xi-feng, but she had fallen from favour
with Jia Lian because of the part she played in the persecution of You Er-jie and had
subsequently been drawn into Xi-feng’s camp, though her loyalty remained a matter
of convenience and did not compare with the devotion of Patience. On this occasion,
seeing her mistress in such a troubled state, she stood dutifully by the bedside and
served her with tea. Xi-feng took a sip and said:
‘Thank you. You can go back to sleep now. I shall be quite all right with Patience
here.’
But Autumn was eager to please, and protested:
‘Surely ma’am, if you can’t get to sleep, it would be best if we took it in turns to sit
up with you?’
Xi-feng had already dozed off. The maids heard a dis?tant cockcrow and, seeing that
Xi-feng was now fast asleep, both lay down fully dressed until daybreak, when they
rose and busily began making preparations for her morning toilet. When she awoke,
Xi-feng’s mind was still haunted by the terrors of the night. Despite her shaky state,
her habitual determination to keep going at all costs prevailed, and with a great
effort she struggled up. She was sitting rapt in thought when she heard a maid in the
courtyard calling:
‘Is Patience in?’
Patience called out in reply, and the maid lifted the door-curtain and came in. It
turned out that she had been sent by Lady Wang to summon Jia Lian.
‘There’s a messenger from the yamen on urgent busi?ness,’ she said, ~and as the
Master has just gone out, Her Ladyship sent me to ask for Mr Lian to come over.’
Xi-feng caught her breath in alarm. To ascertain the nature of this urgent business,
please turn to the next chapter.



CHAPTER 89



Our hero sees the handiwork of a departed love,
and is moved to write an ode
Frowner falls prey to hysterical fear
and resolves to starve to death



We have seen in the last chapter how Xi-feng forced her?self to get up, and was
sitting brooding in her apartment, when suddenly a maid arrived with news of some
fresh crisis.
‘What has happened?’ she asked in alarm.
‘I don’t know, ma’am,’ replied the maid. ‘A messenger has come from the Ministry
for the Master. One of the pages on the inner gate reported to Her Ladyship, and Her
Ladyship sent me here to ask for Mr Lian.’
Xi-feng became slightly calmer when she realized that it was only a Ministry affair.
‘Will you tell Her Ladyship,’ she said, ‘that Mr Lian was away last night on business
and has not yet returned. She had better send round for Mr Zhen at the other
man?sion.
‘Yes ma’ am.’ The maid departed.
Presently Cousin Zhen came over to Rong-guo House to receive the messenger from
the Ministry. Having ascer?tained the facts, he went in to report to Lady Wang.
‘The messenger says that yesterday the President of the Yellow River Conservancy
Board presented a memorial, describing the bursting of dykes throughout Honan
Pro?vince and the flooding of several prefectures, departments and districts. They
are allocating funds for reconstruction of city walls. This is going to mean a lot of
extra admin?istrative work for the senior officials at the Ministry, and they wished to
inform Sir Zheng at once.’
Having said this, Cousin Zhen withdrew. Jia Zheng was informed directly upon his
return, and for most of the winter he was kept very busy and spent nearly all of his
time at the Ministry. Although for Bao-yu this meant a period of less intensive
studying, fear of being detected by his father still caused him to keep up his
attendance at school, and inhibited him from spending much time with Dai-yu.
One morning in the middle of the tenth month, Bao-yu rose and. prepared to set off
as usual for school. The weather had suddenly turned chilly, and he saw Aroma come
in with a bundle of winter clothes.
‘It’s very cold today,’ she said. ‘You’ll need to wrap up well.’
She chose a garment for him to wear and wrapped up another, which she entrusted
to one of the younger maids. The maid went out and gave it to Tealeaf, saying:
‘As it’s so cold today, you are to have this ready in case Master Bao wants to
change.’
Tealeaf acknowledged these instructions, and followed Bao-yu to school with the
felt-wrapped bundle in his arms.
On arrival, Bao-yu sat down to work. He was soon dis?tracted from his books by the
sound of the paper case?ments vibrating in the wind.
‘The weather seems to have taken a turn for the worse, observed the Preceptor,
opening a touch-hole in one of the windows and looking out. A great bank of dark
clouds in the north-west was surging steadily across the sky. Tealeaf came into the
classroom.
‘It’s getting colder, Master Bao. You had better put something warmer on.’
Bao-yu nodded, and Tealeaf walked across the room. The sight of the garment he was
carrying had a most curious effect on Bao-yu, who gazed at it as if in a trance. The
other boys watched with fascination.
‘Why did you have to bring this?’ asked Bao-yu. ‘Who gave it to you?’
He had recognized it at once as the Peacock Gold snow-cape, the one that Skybright
had so bravely mended for him during her last illness.
‘The maids wrapped it up and told me to bring it,’ replied Tealeaf.
‘Well, I’m not feeling particularly cold,’said Bao-yu. ‘I don’t think I’ll wear it just now.
You may as well wrap it up again.’
The Preceptor supposed that Bao-yu was reluctant to spoil so fine a garment, and
noted with gratification this evidence of thrift.
‘Please put it on, Master Bao!’ pleaded Tealeaf. ‘For my sake! You know I’ll get the
blame if you catch a cold.’
With extreme reluctance Bao-yu put it on, sat down again and stared glumly at his
books. The Preceptor pre?sumed that he was concentrating once more on his studies
and gave the incident no further thought.
That afternoon, when the day’s lessons were over, Bao?yu said that he felt unwell
and asked to be excused from school the next day. Dai-ru had, of late, come to view
his students in a more lenient light, more as compani9ns with whom to while away
his old age. His own health was poor, and he was glad to lessen his burden of work by
the judicious dispensation of sick-leave. Besides, he knew that Sir Zheng had more
important matters on his mind, and that Grandmother Jia always indulged her
favourite grandson. With a nod he indicated to Bao-yu that his request was granted.
Bao-yu went straight home. After calling briefly on his mother and grandmother,
neither of whom questioned his plea of illness, he returned to the Garden. He was
not at all his usual smiling talkative self, in fact he hardly said a word to Aroma and
the others, but lay down dressed as he was on the kang.
‘Dinner’s ready,’ said Aroma. ‘Do you want it now, or will you wait till later?’
Bao-yu: ‘I won’t have anything to eat. I’m not feeling well. You just have yours.
Aroma: ‘Well, you might at least take off that lovely cape. You’ll crumple it and ruin
it.’
Bao-yu: ‘I want to keep it on.’
Aroma: ‘It’s not just the cape that I’m worried about. Look how carefully it’s been
darned. You’ll spoil the stitching.’
This touched Bao-yu to the quick. He heaved a deep sigh.
‘Oh all right! Put it away then. Wrap it up carefully. I shall never wear it again.
He stood up to take it off. Aroma came over to take it from him, but he had already
begun to fold it himself
‘Why are you being so industrious today?’ she asked in surprise.
He made no reply but went on folding.
‘Where’s the wrapper?’ he asked when he had finished.
Musk handed it to him, and as he carefully wrapped the cape, she turned to give
Aroma a wink. Bao-yu took no notice of them but sat down, looking thoroughly
dejected. The clock on the shelf chimed, and he glanced down at his watch. It was
already half-past five. Shortly afterwards a junior maid came in to light the lamps.
‘If you won’t have a proper meal, at least have a little hot congee,’ pleaded Aroma.
‘If you go to bed on an emp?ty stomach you could easily catch a fever. And then think
of all the trouble we’ll have.’
He shook his head.
‘I’m not hungry. I’d only feel worse if I tried to force something down.’
‘Well in that case,’ said Aroma, ‘you should at least have an early night.’
She and Musk made his bed and Bao-yu lay down. He tossed and turned, but found it
quite impossible to get to sleep. Finally, just before dawn, he dozed off, only to awake
again half an hour later. Aroma and Musk were already up and about.
‘I heard you tossing and turning till the early hours,’ said Aroma. ‘I didn’t dare
disturb you. Then I fell asleep my?self. Did you manage to sleep in the end?’
‘A bit. But I woke up again almost at once.
‘Have you got a pain anywhere?’ ‘No. I just feel depressed.’
‘Will you be going to school today?’
‘No. I asked for the day off yesterday. I thought I might go for a walk in the Garden
to try and throw off this depression. But I think it will be too cold. Will you tell them
to clear a room for me and put an incense burner and my writing things in it? I won’t
need you today. I just want to sit quietly on my own for a while. Tell the others I don’t
want to be disturbed.’
‘Of course no one will disturb you if you want to study quietly,’ said Musk as soon
as she heard this.
‘I think it’s an excellent idea,’ said Aroma. ‘You will be able to keep warm, and a day
of studying on your own will help you to feel more settled.’ She added: ‘But please, if
you don’t feel like eating a proper meal, have something. What would you like? Tell
me now, and I can get them to prepare it in the kitchen.’
‘Whatever’s easiest,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘Don’t go to a lot of fuss. It would be nice to
have some fruit in the room, for the scent.’
‘Which room would you prefer?’ asked Aroma. ‘They are all rather cluttered, except
Skybright’s old room, which has been empty for quite a while. That might be a bit
cold and lonely though.’
‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Have the charcoal brazier moved in there.’
Aroma ~gave instructions for this to be done, and as she was speaking a maid came
in carrying a tray with a bowl and a pair of ivory chopsticks, which she handed to
Musk, saying:
‘Here’s the soup Miss Hua ordered from the kitchen.’
Musk took the tray and saw that the bowl contained Bird’s Nest Soup.
 ‘Is this what you ordered?’ she asked Aroma.
‘Yes,’ replied Aroma with a smile. ‘I thought that as Master Bao had nothing to eat
last night- and as he spent most of the night tossing in bed, he’d feel rather empty
this morning, so I sent the younger maids to order this specially from the kitchen.’
She told the maid to bring up a table, and Musk served Bao-yu with the soup. When
he had drunk it and rinsed his mouth, Ripple came in:
‘The room’s ready,’ she said. ‘We’re waiting for the fire to get going properly and
the air to clear, and then you can go in, Master Bao.’
He nodded, but was too lost in thought to reply. Short?ly afterwards a maid came in
to report that his writing things had been laid out. She received a perfunctory
acknowledgement from Bao-yu and was immediately fol?lowed by another maid,
who announced that breakfast was ready and asked where he wanted it served.
‘Oh, just bring it in here,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There’s no need to make all this fuss.’
The maid went out and returned with his breakfast. Bao-yu laughed and turning to
Musk and Aroma said:
‘I feel so depressed. I honestly don’t think I could manage this on my own. Why
don’t you two join me? That might make the food taste sweeter, and then perhaps I
might be able to eat more of it...’
Musk smiled.
‘That’s just a whim of yours, Master Bao. You know it wouldn’t be right for us to eat
with you.’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Aroma. ‘We’ve often drunk wine together in the past. I think it
can be allowed as an excep?tion, to cheer him up. Though of course as a regular
prac?tice it would be quite out of the question.’
So the three of them sat down, Bao-yu at the head and the two maids at either side
of the table. After breakfast, one of the junior maids brought in the ‘rinsing’ tea, and
Musk and Aroma supervised the clearing of the table. The tea was served and Bao-yu
sat in gloomy silence again.
‘Is the room ready yet?’ he asked eventually.
‘Ripple came in earlier on to tell you,’ said Musk. ‘What a silly question!’
After sitting there a moment longer, he made his way over to Skybright’s old room.
Having lit a stick of incense and arranged - the fruit on the table, he dismissed all the
maids and closed the door. Aroma and the others stood outside with bated breath.
He selected a length of pink paper with a gold-splash on it and flower patterns in the
corners, said a short prayer, raised his brush and began to write:

FROM
GREEN BOY
TO
SISTER SKYBRIGHT
MAY THIS ODE
OFFERED
WITH
LIBATION OF TEA
AND
BURNING OF PRECIOUS INCENSE FIND
ACCEPTANCE
IN YOUR SIGHT



O Sweetest and most
Inseparable friend!
Alas! that in so cruel a storm
Your life should end!
Your voice is gone, its tender
Music none can learn.
Forever eastward flows the stream,
Never to return.
Though dreams may never show
Your face to me again,
I see the Peacock Cape and feel
A haunting pain.
When he had finished writing, Bao-yu took a burning joss-stick, held the paper to it
and set the ode alight. He sat in silence until the bundle of incense-sticks had burned
to the end, then opened the door and walked out.
‘Why are you coming Out again so soon?’ inquired Aroma. ‘Are you feeling low
again?’
He feigned a laugh.
‘I was rather depressed earlier on. I needed to be on my own for a bit in a quiet
place. I feel better now. I think I shall take a stroll.’
He walked straight out into the Garden. When he reached the Naiad’s House, he
called from the courtyard:
‘Is Cousin Lin at home?’
‘Who’s that?’ replied Nightingale.
She raised the door-curtain and saw him standing there.
‘Oh it’s you, Master Bao,’ she said with a smile. ‘Miss Lin is inside. Please come in
and sit down.’
As Bao-yu went in with her, Dai-yu’s voice could be heard from the inner room:
‘Nightingale, please ask Master Bao to come in and wait a moment.’
Bao-yu, walking towards the inner room, stopped to admire the pair of calligraphic
scrolls that hung one on either side of the doorway. The calligraphy looked recent
and had been done on strips of dark purple paper, splashed with gold and decorated
with a pattern of clouds and dragons. The two lines ran:

Through casement green the moon shines brightly still; In bamboo chronicles the
ancients are but empty words.

Bao-yu read them with an appreciative smile and passed through into the inner
room.
‘What are you doing, coz?’ he inquired with a smile.
Dai-yu stood up, took a couple of steps towards him, smiled and said:
‘Please sit down. I’m copying out part of this sutra. I only have two lines left to do.
I’ll lust finish and then we can sit and chat.’
She told Snowgoose to pour him some tea.
‘Please carry on writing,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t take any notice of me.’
His attention had been caught by a painting hanging on the centre wall of the room.
It was a vertical scroll show?ing Chang E, the Moon Goddess, with one of her
atten?dants, and another fairy, also with an attendant who was carrying what
seemed to be a long bag containing clothes. Apart from the clouds that surrounded
the figures, there were no background details of any kind. The linear style of the
picture was reminiscent of the Song master Li Long-mian. It bore the title ‘The
Contest in the Cold’, written in the antique ba-fen style.
‘Have you hung this picture of the Contest in the Cold here recently, coz?’ asked
Bao-yu.
‘Yes. I remembered it yesterday while they were tidying the room, and so I brought
it out and told.them to hang it up.’
‘What’s the allusion in the title?’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘Surely you know! It’s such a well-known poem... ‘I can’t quite recall it at present,’
confessed Bao-yu, smiling rather sheepishly. ‘Please tell me.’
‘Don’t you remember Li Shang-yin’s lines:

Braving the cold,
Fairy Frost and Lady Moon
Parade their rival charms...’?


‘Of course!’ exclaimed Bao-yu. ‘How exquisite! And what an unusual subject! This is
the perfect time of year to have it up too.’
He continued to amble round the room, inspecting it in a leisurely fashion, and
Snowgoose brought him a cup of tea. He drank his tea, and in a few minutes Dai-yu
finished the section of the sutra she was copying, and stood up.
‘Forgive me,’ she said.
‘You know you don’t have to stand on ceremony with me,’ he replied with a smile.
He observed that she was wearing a little pale blue fur-lined dress embroidered with
flowers, and an ermine-lined sleeveless jacket, while her hair was coiled up in her
every?day style and had no flowers in it but only a flat hairpin of purest gold. Her
padded underskirt was pink, and embroi?dered with flowers. How graceful she
seemed, as a jade tree leaning in the wind; how gentle, as a fragrant lotus whose
petals are moist with dew!
‘Have you been playing your Qin at all these last few days?’ he inquired.
‘Not for a day or two. This sutra-copying makes my hands too cold.’
‘Maybe. it’s just as well,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know the Qin is a fine thing in its way, but I
can’t see that it does any real good. I have never heard of it bringing prosperity or
long life; it only seems to cause sorrow and distress. And it must be such a labour to
memorize those tablatures. I think, coz, that with your delicate constitution you
should avoid anything so strenuous.’
Dai-yu smiled somewhat scornfully.
‘Is that the Qin you play?’ Bao-yu went on, pointing to one hanging on the wall.
‘Isn’t it rather short?’
‘Not really,’ explained Dai-yu. ‘When I was a little girl and first started learning, I
couldn’t reach on an ordinary Qin, so we had this one specially made. It’s not a
collec?tor’s piece of course, made with wood ‘saved from the flames’ - but it has a
Crane Fairy and a Phoenix Tail, and the Dragon’s Pool sound-hole and Goose Foot
tuning-pegs are all in the correct proportions. And look at the crackling on the
varnish. Doesn’t that look just like Cow Hair crackle to you? The fine workmanship
gives it a beautiful tone.’
‘Have you been writing any poetry recently, coz?’ Bao?yu went on to inquire.
‘Not much, not since the last meeting of the club.’
He laughed. ‘You can’t fool me. I heard you chanting. How did it go now?

Why grieve to watch
The wheel of Karma turn?
A moonlike purity remains
My constant goal...

I found your setting very striking. You did write it didn’t you?’
Dai-yu: ‘How did you come to hear it?’
Bao-yu: ‘I heard you playing when I was walking back from Smartweed Loggia a few
days ago. The music was so lovely and I didn’t want to interrupt you, so I just listened
quietly for a while and then went on my way. There is one thing I’ve been meaning to
ask you. I noticed that in the first part you use a level-tone rhyme, but suddenly
change to an oblique tone at the end. Why is that?’
Dai-yu: ‘That is free composition. One doesn’t have to abide by any rules. One just
goes wherever the inspiration takes one.’
Bao-yu: ‘I see! I’m afraid such subtleties were lost on my untrained ears.’
Dai-yu: ‘True lovers of music have always been few.’
Bao-yu realized that without meaning to he had said the wrong thing, and was afraid
that he had alienated Dai-yu. He sat there for a while. There was so much he wanted
to say, but he was now too nervous to open his mouth again. Dai-yu had also spoken
without thinking, and on reflection she wished that she had not been so scathing,
and withdrew silently into her shell. Her silence only increased Bao-yu’s own
misgivings, and finally in some embarrassment he stood up and said:
‘I must be on my way to see Tan. Please don’t get up.’
‘Give her my regards when you see her, will you?’ said Dai-yu.
‘I will,’ he replied, and departed. Dai-yu saw him to the door, then returned to her
chair and sat brooding to herself.
‘Bao-yu’s been so odd recently. He doesn’t seem to say what he’s thinking. He’s
friendly one minute and distant the next. I wonder what it means?’
Nightingale came in. ‘Have you finished copying for today, Miss? Shall I put your
writing things away now?’
‘I shan’t be doing any more,’ replied Dai-yu. ‘You can clear them away.’
Dai-yu went into the inner room and lay down on her bed, slowly turning all these
things over in her mind. Nightingale came in to ask if she would like some tea.
‘No, thank you. I just want to be alone and lie down for a bit.’
‘Very well, Miss.’ Nightingale went out, to find Snowgoose standing in the doorway,
staring oddly in front of her. She went up to her and said:
‘What’s the matter with you?’ Snowgoose was lost in thought, and the question
gave her quite a turn.
‘Sh! Don’t say a word! I’ve heard something very strange. If I tell you, you must
promise not to breathe a word to anyone.’
As she said this Snowgoose shot her lips out in the direction of Dai-yu’s bedroom,
then began walking away, nodding to Nightingale to follow her. They reached the foot
of the terrace and she began again in a whisper:
‘Have you heard that Bao-yu’s engaged to be married?’ Nightingale gave a start. ‘I
don’t believe you! It can’t be true!’ ‘It is! Nearly everyone knows except us. ‘Who
told you?’
   ‘Scribe. His fiancée is a prefect’s daughter. She’s very good-looking and comes from
a wealthy family.’
As Snowgoose was speaking, Nightingale heard Dai-yu cough and thought she could
hear her getting up again. Worried that she might come out and overhear them, she
took Snowgoose by the hand and motioned to her to be silent. She looked inside, but
all seemed quiet. She asked Snowgoose in a low whisper:
‘What exactly did Scribe say?’
‘Do you remember,’ replied Snowgoose, ‘a day or two ago you sent me to Miss
Tan’s to thank her for some?thing? Well, she wasn’t home, but Scribe was. We
started chatting, and one of us happened to mention Master Bao and his naughty
ways. Scribe said: "When will Master Bao ever grow up? He doesn’t take anything
seriously. And to think that he’s engaged to be married now - and still as silly as
ever!" I asked her if the engagement had been set?tled, and she said that it had and
that the go-between was a Mr Wang, a close relation on the Ning-guo side, so the
whole thing was a foregone conclusion.’
Nightingale put her head thoughtfully to one side. ‘How very strange!’ she thought to
herself.
‘Why has no one in the family mentioned it?’ she asked Snowgoose.
‘That’s Her Old Ladyship’s idea - so Scribe said. It’s in case Bao-yu finds out and is
distracted from his studies. She made me promise not to tell a soul, and said she
would blame me if word got around.’
Snowgoose pointed towards the house.
‘That’s why I haven’t mentioned it in front of her. But today when you asked, I
thought I could tell you the truth.’
As she was speaking there was a loud squawk from the parrot:
‘Miss Lin’s back! Put the kettle on!’
The two maids had the fright of their lives and turned round expecting to see Dai-yu.
But seeing no one, and realizing their mistake, they scolded the bird and went in?side.
They found Dai-yu at her chair. She was out of breath and had clearly only just sat
down. Nightingale asked rather awkwardly if she wanted any tea or water.
‘Where have you two been all this time?’ asked Dai-yu. ‘No one came when I
called.’
She walked back to the kang and lay down once more facing the wall, telling them to
let down the bed-curtains. They did so and left the room, each secretly thinking to
herself that she had overheard them, but neither daring to say so.
Dai-yu, brooding on her bed, had heard them whisper?ing outside and had crept to
the door to eavesdrop. De?tails of their conversation eluded her but the main
sub?stance was clear. She felt as though plunged into a great ocean. The prophecy
contained in her nightmare was to be fulfilled after all. Bitterness and grief
overwhelmed her. There was Only one way of escape left. She must die. She must not
live to see this dreaded thing take place. Without Bao-yu what would life be worth
anyway? She had no par?ents of her own to turn to. Surely if she neglected herself
daily from now on, in a few months she would be able to undermine her health and
leave this world and all its trou?bles behind her?
Having formed this resolution, without bothering to pull up her quilt or put on any
extra clothes she closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep. Nightingale and
Snow-goose came in several times to wait on her, but seeing no sign of movement
did not dare disturb her, even for din?ner. Later, when the lamps were lit, Nightingale
peeped through the curtains and saw that she had fallen asleep with her covers in a
crumpled heap at her feet. Afraid she might catch cold, Nightingale gently pulled
them over her. Dai-yu lay still until she had gone, then pushed them back again.
Meanwhile Nightingale questioned Snowgoose again:
‘Are you sure you weren’t making it up?’
‘Of course I wasn’t!’ replied Snowgoose rather indig?nantly.
Nightingale: ‘But how did Scribe come to know?’
Snowgoose: ‘It was Crimson that heard it first at Mrs Lian’s.’
Nightingale: ‘I think Miss Lin must have overheard us. I can tell that something has
upset her greatly. We must be careful never to mention it again.’
The two maids tidied up and made themselves ready for bed. Nightingale went in to
see how Dai-yu was and found the quilt in the same crumpled heap as before. She
pulled it lightly back. That night passed without further event.
The next morning Dai-yu rose early without waking either of the maids, and sat up
on her own; lost in thought. Nightingale awoke to find her already up and said in
surprise:
‘You’re up very early this morning, Miss!’
‘I know I am,’ replied Dai-yu rather curtly. ‘It’s be-cause I went to sleep so early last
night.’
Nightingale quickly dressed and woke Snowgoose, and the two of them waited on
Dai-yu at her toilet. She sat staring into the mirror. Tears began to stream down her
face, and her silk scarf was soon wet through. In the poet’s words:

A wasted face
reflected in the spring stream;
And pity flows
from face to mirror’d face
and back again.

Nightingale stood by, not daring to utter a single comfort?ing word, for fear that she
would say the wrong thing and cause further anguish. Dai-yu sat motionless for a
con?siderable while, then finally began her morning toilet, negligently, her eyes still
brimming with tears. When it was done, she remained sitting where she was for a
few minutes, then asked Nightingale to light some of the Tibe?tan incense.
‘But Miss,’ protested Nightingale, ‘you’ve hardly had any sleep. What do you want
to go lighting incense for? You’re surely not going to start copying the sutra again are
you?’
Dai-yu nodded.
‘But you woke so early, Miss. If you start writing now you’ll exhaust yourself.’
‘What does that matter? The sooner it’s finished the bet?ter. I only want to do it to
keep myself occupied anyway. And in days to come you will have my writing to
remem?ber me by.’
As she said this tears began to pour down her cheeks, and Nightingale was no longer
able to offer consolation but burst into tears herself.
Dai-yu was resolved that from this day forward she would deliberately destroy her
health. She soon lost her appetite, and gradually began to waste away. Bao-yu visited
her whenever he could after school, but although there were a million things she
wanted to tell him, her consciousness that they were no longer children inhibited her
from showing her affection by teasing him in the old way, and rendered her
powerless to express what was preying on her mind. Bao-yu for his part would have
liked to talk with her sincerely and offer her some genuine comfort; but he was afraid
of aggravating her illness by offending her in some way, and so when he did see her,
he merely inquired politely how she was feeling and added a few words of
encouragement. Theirs was a true case of estrangement in the very extremity of love.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang showed a motherly concern for Dai-yu, which
however went no further than calling in the doctor. Not knowing the inner source of
her illness, they put it down to her sickly constitution, and Nightingale and
Snowgoose were much too afraid to tell them the truth. Dai-yu weakened day by day.
After a fortnight her stomach had shrunk to the point where she could no longer
bring herself to eat even gruel. Every con?versation she overheard during the day
seemed to her to be connected in some way with Bao-yu’s marriage. Every servant
she saw from Green Delights seemed to be in?volved in the preparations. When Aunt
Xue came to visit her, Bao-chai’s absence confirmed her suspicions. She began to
hope that no one would come to see her. She refused to take her medicine. Her only
remaining wish was to be left alone, and to die as quickly as possible. In her dreams
she constantly heard people addressing the new ‘Mrs Bao’, and her mind grew totally
obsessed with the idea, like the proverbial drinker who, seeing a curved bow
reflected in his cup, is convinced that he has swallowed a snake.
A few weeks of this self-imposed starvation and it seemed as if she must soon die.
Even the thinnest of gruels was now an impossibility. Her breathing was scarcely
per?ceptible. She was hanging on by the slenderest thread. To learn whether she was
to survive this crisis or not, please turn to the next chapter.




CHAPTER 90

A poor girl loses a padded jacket and puts up
with some obstreperous behaviour
A young man accepts a tray of sweetmeats and
is put out by some devious goings-on



During the first week or so of Dai-yu’s decline, when Grandmother Jia and her aunts
had taken it in turns to visit her, she had still possessed strength enough to make an
occasional response to their inquiries. But now she would eat nothing whatsoever,
and for several days had hardly said a word. The strange thing was that although at
times she seemed unconscious, there were periods when she was perfectly lucid.
They began to suspect something, and interrogated Nightingale and Snowgoose
more than once. But the maids were too scared to say what they knew. Nightingale
for her part, while she would have liked to discover the latest news from Scribe,
feared that the truth would only provide a further shock and hasten the hour of
Dai-yu’s death, and so when she saw Scribe, she avoided the subject completely.
Snowgoose, as the transmitter of the news, felt responsible for Dai-yu’s con?dition
and longed for a hundred tongues to cry out ‘I never said a word!’ She too, when
questioned, maintained a close silence.
Nightingale, seeing that Dai-yu would eat nothing, and judging that all hope was now
gone, stood by her bedside crying for a while, then went outside and whispered to
Snowgoose:
‘Go in and watch her carefully. I’m going straight over to tell Her Old Ladyship, Her
Ladyship and Mrs Lian. She has definitely taken a turn for the worse today.’
She departed, and Snowgoose went in to take her place.
She found Dai-yu lying very still, as if in a deep sleep. Being only a child with no
experience of such things, she took this state for death itself, and began to feel both
tear?ful and frightened. If only Nightingale would hurry up and come back! At that
very moment she heard footsteps outside the window. That must be Nightingale now!
Breath?ing a sigh of relief, she stood up at once and went to the doorway of the inner
chamber, lifting the door-curtain in expectation. She heard the swish of the outer
door-curtain, and in came not Nightingale but Scribe, sent by Tan-chun to inquire
how Dai-yu was. Seeing Snowgoose standing in the inner doorway, she asked:
‘How is Miss Lin?’
Snowgoose nodded to her to come in and Scribe entered the inner room with her.
She noticed that Nightingale was not there, and when she looked at Dai-yu and saw
how feebly she was breathing, a look of horror came over her face.
‘Where’s Nightingale gone?’ she asked.
‘To tell their Ladyships,’ replied Snowgoose.
Certain that Dai-yu, if not actually dead, was by this time at any rate ‘dead to the
world’, Snowgoose decided to take advantage of Nightingale’s absence to question
Scribe. Taking her by the hand, she asked in a whisper:
‘Did you really mean what you said the other day about Mr Wang, and Master
Bao’s betrothal?’
‘Of course I did!’ replied Scribe.
‘When was it settled?’
‘I never said it was! What I told you was just what I’d heard from Crimson. Later I
was at Mrs Lian’s myself, and heard her say to Patience that the whole thing was
something the Master’s literary gentlemen had thought up, to please him and
provide themselves with a connection. As it happened Lady Xing didn’t even think it a
good match. But even if she had approved, everyone knows how unreliable her
judgement is. Besides, Her Old Ladyship already has someone else in mind for Master
Bao, someone here in the Garden. Lady Xing had no idea of that, of course, and Her
Old Ladyship only allowed them to go ahead with the normal inquiries for the
Mas?ter’s sake. Mrs Lian said Her Old Ladyship wants Bao-yu to marry one of his
cousins, and her mind is quite made up, so any other proposals are a waste of time.’
Snowgoose was beside herself.
‘Then our mistress is dying for nothing!’ she exclaimed.
‘What do you mean?’ asked Scribe.
‘Don’t you know? The other day Miss Lin overheard me telling Nightingale about
the betrothal - that’s why she has brought herself to this terrible state now.’
‘Sh!’ whispered Scribe. ‘She might hear you!’
‘She’s completely dead to the world,’ replied Snowgoose. ‘Look - she can’t last
more than a day or two now.’
As she was speaking, the door-curtain was drawn aside and in came Nightingale.
‘For goodness’ sake!’ she exclaimed. ‘Can’t you two do your gossiping somewhere
else? You might as well drive her to her death!’
‘I simply cannot believe such strange goings-on,’ mut?tered Scribe.
‘My dear Scribe,’ retorted Nightingale, ‘don’t mis?understand me please. I didn’t
mean to offend you, But you must be so stupid to gossip like that.’
The three of them were interrupted by a sudden cough from Dai-yu’s bed on the
kang. Nightingale hurried to the bedside, while Snowgoose and Scribe stood in
silence. Nightingale bent down and whispered to Dai-yu, who was lying with her face
to the wall:
‘Would you like some water, Miss?’
There was a barely audible ‘yes’ and Snowgoose promptly filled a cup half-full with
hot water and handed it to Nightingale, who held it in the palm of her hand. Scribe
meanwhile had moved towards the kang and was about to speak to Dai-yu when
Nightingale motioned to her not to say anything and she checked herself. They stood
waiting. After a short interval Dai-yu coughed again and Nightingale inquired at once:
‘Would you like the water now, Miss?’
There was another faint ‘yes’ and Dai-yu seemed to want to lift her head, but was too
feeble to do so. Night?ingale climbed up onto the kang by her side and, holding the
cup in her hand, first tested the water to make sure it was not too hot, then raised it
to Dai-yu’s mouth, sup?porting her head until the rim of the cup reached her lips.
Dai-yu took a sip, and Nightingale was about to remove the cup when she saw that
Dai-yu wanted some more. She held the cup where it was. Dai-yu drank again, shook
her head to show that it was enough, took a deep breath and lay down once more.
After a pause she opened her eyes a fraction and asked:
‘Was that Scribe I heard talking just now?’
‘Yes, Miss,’ replied Nightingale.
Scribe was still in the room and came up to the kang at once to convey Tan-chun’s
message. Dai-yu stared at her for a minute and nodded. After a pause she said:
‘When you go home, give Miss Tan my regards will you?’
Scribe took this to mean that Dai-yu wanted her to leave and made her way quietly
out of the room.
Now although Dai-yu’s condition was extremely grave, her power of reason was
unimpaired. She was aware of Scribe’s arrival and vaguely heard the first words she
exchanged with Snowgoose. She felt too exhausted to cope with a visitor, and so
pretended to be asleep. But as the conversation progressed, it became clear to her
that what she had taken to be a fact had never been more than a proposal. And then
she heard Scribe repeat Xi-feng’s words, that Grandmother Jia intended to marry
Bao-yu to one of his cousins, to one that lived in the Garden; and who could that be
but herself? Just as at the winter sol?stice Yin gives birth to Yang, so now in her mind
darkness gave way to light. She suddenly felt much clearer within herself, decided to
drink some water and even spoke to Scribe.
It was at this moment that Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Li Wan and Xi-feng arrived
on the scene, in re?sponse to Nightingale’s urgent summons. Now that Dai?-yu’s
inner doubts had been so dramatically dissipated, she no longer presented the
spectacle of the dying maiden that Nightingale had led them to expect. She was still
weak and low in spirits, but was able with an effort to say a few words in reply to
their inquiries. Xi-feng called Nighting?ale over and questioned her:
‘Miss Lin is not nearly as ill as you made out. Why did you exaggerate so? We were
most alarmed.’
‘Honestly, ma’am,’ replied Nightingale, ‘only a while ago she was in a bad way.
That’s why I came over. I would never have dared to bother you otherwise. She does
seem a lot better now. It’s most strange.
Grandmother Jia said to Xi-feng with a smile:
‘You shouldn’t take what she says so seriously, my dear. She doesn’t understand
such things. Mind you she was quite right to speak up if she noticed anything the
matter. I’ve no time for young people who never say a word or do anything for fear of
appearing foolish.’
The ladies stayed for a few minutes chatting, then, de?ciding that all was well,
returned to their apartments.
Truly:

No remedy but love
Can make the lovesick well;
Only the hand that tied the knot
Can loose the tiger’s bell.

After this Dai-yu’s condition continued to improve steadi?ly, and Snowgoose and
Nightingale offered many a secret prayer of thanks to the Lord Buddha.
‘Thank goodness she’s better!’ said Snowgoose to Nightingale. ‘But what an odd
illness! And what an odd way to get better!’
‘We know what caused it,’ said Nightingale. ‘It’s this sudden recovery that’s
puzzling. I think Bao-yu and Miss Lin must be destined to be married after all. ‘The
course of true love never did run smooth’, but ‘Marriages made in heaven can never
be broken’ either! You can tell they are destined to be together. That’s what they
both want in their hearts, and that must be what Heaven has decreed for them.
Remember what happened to Bao-yu last year, when I told him Miss Lin was going
home to the South? He nearly died of shock, and made the most terri?ble scene. And
now that one remark of ours has nearly been the death of her. Theirs must be a bond
from some previous life, made a century ago at the Rock of Rebirth!’
They exchanged a secret smile at this romantic theory, and Snowgoose exclaimed:
‘Thank goodness she’s better anyway! We must never mention it again! Even if
Bao-yu were to marry another lady and I witnessed the wedding with my own eyes, I
swear I wouldn’t breathe a word of it to anyone.’
Nightingale laughed.
‘Well said!’
Theirs were not the only secret discussions on this sub?ject. Dai-yu’s strange illness
and stranger recovery gave rise to a great deal of whispering and speculation in the
household, which soon reached the ears of Xi-feng. Lady Wang and Lady Xing vaguely
suspected something, and Grandmother Jia herself had a shrewd idea what was at
the bottom of it all. The four ladies were gathered one day in Grandmother Jia’s
apartment, and in the course of their conversation the subject of Dai-yu’s illness
came up.
‘There is something I want to say to you all,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Bao-yu and
Miss Lin have been together ever since they were little, and this has never troubled
me, as I have always thought of them as children. But of late I have noticed how
frequent these illnesses of hers are becoming - how suddenly they come, and how
suddenly they go - a sure sign that she is growing up. It really won’t do to allow them
to stay together indefinite?ly. What do you all think?’
After a thoughtful silence Lady Wang replied, choosing her words with care:
‘Miss Lin reads such a lot into things. And Bao-yu’s childish manner is deceptive: he
can be extremely stupid and tactless. If we remove either one of them from the
Garden, won’t it be too obvious? It has always been said that every boy becomes a
groom and every girl becomes a bride. Don’t you think, Mother, that a better
solution would be to go ahead as quickly as possible and get them both married?’
Grandmother Jia frowned.
‘I know that Miss Lin’s peculiar temperament is in some ways attractive. But I don’t
think we could possibly have her as a wife for Bao-yu. Besides, I’m afraid that with
such a delicate constitution she is unlikely to live to any age. I’m sure Bao-chai is in
every respect the more suitable choice.’
‘Of course we all agree with you there, Mother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘But we must find
a husband for Miss Lin too. If we do not, and if she has taken a fancy to Bao-yu -after
all, it is only natural for a girl to have such feelings as she grows up - it might make
things very -difficult if she were then to discover that he was already betrothed to
Bao-chai.’
‘There can be no question,’ replied Grandmother Jia, ‘of marrying an outsider
before one of the family. The order must be: first to marry Bao-yu, then to have Miss
Lin betrothed. Besides Miss Lin is two years younger than Bao-yu anyway. If I
understand you correctly, we shall have to conceal Bao-yu’s betrothal from her...’
Xi-feng turned at once to the various maids present:
‘Is that clear? Not a word of Master Bao’s betrothal to anyone! If I catch one of you
talking about it I shall show no mercy.
‘Feng dear,’ continued Grandmother Jia, ‘I have noticed that since your illness you
have taken less interest in what happens in the Garden. You really must give it more
of your attention. It’s not just the sort of thing we have been talking about. Any
repetition of that disgraceful drinking and gambling that was discovered among the
servants last year must be prevented at all costs. Be rather more par?ticular, will you,
and keep a watchful eye on what goes on. They need to be- disciplined, and you
seem to be the one they respect most.’
‘Yes, Grannie,’ said Xi-feng.
The ladies sat talking for a while longer, then left to go their separate ways.
*

From now on Xi-feng began to inspect the Garden on a more regular basis. One day,
in the course of one of her tours of inspection, she was walking along the bank by
Amaryllis Eyot when she heard an old woman shouting outside the courtyard and
went to investigate. As she drew near the old serving-woman caught sight of her,
dropped her hands to her side and stood to attention, mumbling a confused ‘Good
morning, ma’am.’
‘Why are you making such a racket out here?’ asked Xi-feng.
‘You and Mrs Zhu have given me a job to do here, ma’am,’ replied the woman,
‘looking after the flowerbeds and fruit-trees. I’d done nothing wrong, and Miss Xing’s
maid accused us of stealing…’
‘And why should she do that?’ asked Xi-feng.
‘Yesterday our Blackie came with me here to play,’ re?plied the woman. ‘She didn’t
know any better and went inside Miss Xing’s apartment to have a look around. I sent
her home straight away. Then early this morning I heard one of the maids say they’d
lost something. When I asked what it was, she started questioning me all about it
‘That’s no cause for you to lose your temper,’ retorted Xi-feng.
‘This Garden belongs to Mrs Zhu’s family not hers!’ protested the old woman. ‘We
work for Mrs Zhu and I won’t be called a thief!’
Xi-feng spat straight in the old woman’s face and said harshly:
‘Hold your tongue! That’s quite enough! You’re re?sponsible for things here and if
something is lost the maids are quite right to hold you accountable for it. How dare
you talk such nonsense! Call Steward Lin and have her dismissed!’
The maids were carrying out her orders when Xing Xiu-yan came hurrying out. She
greeted Xi-feng and said with an anxious smile:
‘You mustn’t do that! It was nothing really. And it’s all over now.’
‘My dear girl,’ said Xi-feng, ‘that is not the right atti?tude to take. It’s the principle
I’m concerned with. The servants must learn to know their place.’
Xiu-yan saw that the woman was on her knees begging for mercy, and asked Xi-feng
at once to go inside with her and sit down.
‘I know her sort,’ said Xi-feng. ‘They think they can get away with anything - except
when I’m around.’
When Xiu-yan continued to plead for the woman, however, and insisted on putting
the blame on her own maid, she relented.
‘Out of consideration for Miss Xing,’ she announced, ‘I shall let you off this once.’
The old woman came forward to kotow first to Xi-feng then to Xiu-yan, and left.
Once she had gone, Xiu-yan asked Xi-feng to be seated. ‘What was it that you lost?’
inquired Xi-feng pleasantly. ‘Nothing of any importance,’ replied Xiu-yan with a smile.
‘Just an old red padded jacket of mine. I told them to look for it and when it didn’t
turn up thought no more about it. My maid was silly to question that woman. She
was bound to take offence. My maid was very thoughtless and I’ve already given her
a good talking to. The whole affair is over and best forgotten.’
While she was speaking, Xi-feng had been inspecting Xiu-yan’s clothes and the
general appearance of her apart?ment. Her few padded or fur-lined clothes looked
rather worn and ineffective as protection against the cold. Most of her quilted
bedding looked on the thin side too. She glanced at the furniture and the ornaments
on her table, all of them provided by Grandmother Jia, and noticed how
immaculately clean and tidy they had been kept. Xi-feng felt a warm respect towards
her.
‘I know a jacket is nothing to fuss over,’ she said. ‘But the weather is growing cold,
and you need it to keep you warm. Of course you were right to question her.
Honest?ly! The insolent way these servants carry on!’
She sat talking with Xiu-yan for a while and then left to continue her tour of
inspection, stopping off in all the var?ious residences before returning to her own
apartment. There she instructed Patience to make up a parcel of her clothes to be
sent over to Xiu-yan: it was to contain two padded jackets, one of dark-red imported
silk, the other of viridian damask-silk lined with pearly lambswool, a long turquoise
worsted skirt with brocade appliqué panels and an embroidered border, and a
deep-blue ermine-lined jacket.
Despite Xi-feng’s intervention on her behalf, Xiu-yan was still most mortified by the
woman’s rudeness. ‘Of all the girls who live here,’ she thought to herself, ‘I’m the
only one the servants would dare to offend in that way. They say things about me all
the time. And now Feng has seen it for herself!’
The more she thought about it the more depressing her position seemed. And yet it
was impossible for her to con?fide in anyone. Bowing to her fate, she was just
beginning to weep when she saw Xi-feng’s maid Felicity come in carrying a bundle of
clothes. Soon realizing whose they were, she absolutely refused to accept them.
‘But Miss,’ protested Felicity, ‘Mrs Lian says that if you think they are too old she
will change them for newer ones.’
Xiu-yan smiled politely.
‘It’s very thoughtful of her. But I can’t possibly let her give me some of her clothes
just because I’ve lost one of mine. Please take them back and thank her most kindly
for me. I do appreciate the thought.’
She gave her a little purse, and Felicity departed with some reluctance, carrying the
bundle. Minutes later she was back, this time accompanied by Patience. Xiu-yan
hurried out to greet them and asked them both to be seated. Patience smiled and
said:
‘Mrs Lian says you should accept them as one of the family and not be so polite.’
‘But I’m not being polite,’ replied Xiu-yan. ‘Honestly. I’d be embarrassed to take
them.’
‘Mrs Lian says,’ persisted Patience, ‘that if you won’t take them it must either be
because they’re too old or be?cause you don’t like the idea of wearing her things.
She says that if I take them back she’ll be cross with me.’
Xiu-yan blushed and smiled gratefully:
‘Well, in that case, how can I possibly refuse? Please convey my thanks to Mrs Lian.’
She served them both tea, after which Felicity and Pati?ence left. They were almost
home again when they met one of Aunt Xue’s women. She greeted them, and
Pati?ence asked her where she was going.
‘Mrs Xue and our young lady sent me over to convey their regards to all their
Ladyships and young madams and young ladies. I was at Mrs Lian’s just now asking
for you, and she told me you’d gone into the Garden. Have you just been to Miss
Xing’s by any chance?’
‘Why, how did you know that?’ asked Patience.
‘Oh, a little birdie told me... It’s most generous I think, what you and your mistress
are doing...’
Patience gave a little laugh.
‘Won’t you come in and have a chat later on?’
‘I still have things to do. Another day,’ replied the old woman and went on her way,
while Patience went in to report to Xi-feng.
*

When the serving-woman returned to the Xue household, which was in its usual
state of upheaval, thanks to the dis?ruptive behaviour of Xia Jin-gui, she recounted
the story of Xing Xiu-yan’s humiliation, and both Aunt Xue and Bao-chai began to
weep.
‘It’s only because Pan’s away,’ said Bao-chai, ‘that she has to go on suffering like
this. We are lucky that Feng has been looking after her. In future we must keep more
of an eye on her ourselves. She is after all practically one of the family now.’
As she was speaking Xue Ke came in.
‘In all the years he’s spent here Pan hasn’t made a single decent friend!’ he said.
‘They’re a pack of rogues the lot of them! I’m sure they don’t care in the slightest
what hap?pens to him. They’re only curious to know the latest news. This last couple
of days I’ve told them all to go away, and I’ve given the janitors instructions not to
-let any of them in.’
‘Is it that actor Jiang and his friends again?’ asked Aunt Xue.
‘No, as a matter of fact he hasn’t been here at all. It’s a different crowd.’
Xue Ke’s words intensified Aunt Xue’s anxiety.
‘Though I have a son,’ she said, ‘it is as though I had none. Even if Pan wins this
reprieve, his life is ruined. You are only my nephew, Ke, but you show much more
sense than Pan. I can see that from now on I shall have to depend on you. Be sure to
work hard and make the most of your life. And think of your bride-to-be, who comes
from a family that has fallen on hard times. It is always hard when a daughter goes
out into the world and gets married. One can only pray that her husband will turn
out well and be capable of providing for her. Imagine if Xiu-?yan were to turn out like
this creature here...’
Gesturing in the direction of Xia Jin-gui’s room Aunt Xue continued:
‘But I don’t want to talk about her. I know Xiu-yan to be an honest and thoughtful
girl, thrifty and unspoilt. The sooner Pan’s business is settled; the sooner we can get
the two of you married and set my poor heart at rest.’
‘Don’t forget that Bao-qin is still waiting to be married,’ Xue Ke reminded his aunt.
‘I know how concerned you are about that. Don’t-worry on our account.’
They stayed chatting together for a few minutes longer and then Xue Ke returned to
his room. He ate his dinner and began to think about Xiu-yan in the Garden, forced
by poverty to be so utterly dependent on the Jias. The two of them had travelled by
the same boat on their ori?ginal journey to the capital, and he had been able to see
for himself that she was a pretty, good-natured girl. How unjust of destiny to give a
creature like Xia Jin-gui a life of wealth and luxury and turn her into a spoilt shrew,
while for a girl like Xiu-yan there was nothing but hardship! What was in the mind of
the Great Arbiter Yama when he made such a dispensation?
These gloomy thoughts stirred Xue Ke to. express his sense of injustice in poetic form.
His was a untutored pen, but he did as best he could.

As the flood-dragon flounders on the shore,
So our two hearts languish under like privations.
When will we drink this bitter cup no more
And soar unfettered through the constellations?

He read the lines through and thought of sticking them up on his wall. He felt a little
self-conscious however, and thought to himself:
‘What if someone sees the and makes fun of me…’
 He read them through again.
‘Oh who cares! I will put them up. I can read them any?way, to cheer myself up.’
A final reading made him change his mind yet again, however, and he slipped them
between the pages of a book.
‘I’m old enough for us to be married now,’ he mused to himself. ‘But who could
have foreseen this family crisis, and who knows when it will ever end? What an
ordeal for a gentle girl like Xiu-yan! How lonely and wretched she must feel!’
At that moment the door was pushed open and Moon?beam came in carrying a
round covered-tray and a jug of wine, which she deposited with a simpering smile on
the table. He rose and asked her to be seated. Still smiling she said:
‘Four plates of sweetmeats and a small jug of wine, with Mrs Pan’s compliments,
Master Ke.’
‘It’s most kind of her,’ replied Ke, ‘but surely she could have sent one of the
younger maids? She didn’t need to bother you, Miss Moonbeam.’
‘Oh Master Ke, there’s no need to be so polite. It’s all in the family after all... Mrs
Pan knows what trouble you’ve been put to on account of Mr Pan, and she’s been
meaning for a long time to thank you herself but was afraid the others might take it
the wrong way. In this household, as I think you know, sir, there’s a lot goes on
beneath the surface. People are only waiting to pounce on a little thing like a present,
and then they start inventing all kinds of stories. That’s why she’s been ever so
slightly discreet and asked me to come over personally with these few things today
when no one was looking...’
She gave Xue Ke a saucy smile and continued:
‘ And please, no more of that ‘Miss’ Moonbeam - it makes me feel most
uncomfortable. We are only here to serve, and if we can serve Mr Pan, then why not
you as well?’
Xue Ke was young and had a trusting nature. It was odd that Pan’s womenfolk should
suddenly start treating him like this; but Moonbeam’s explanation was a plausi?ble
one, he reflected.
‘You can leave the sweetmeats,’ he said. "But take the wine back with you. I’ve
never been much of a drinker. Occasionally if pushed to it I can manage a cup, but
usu?ally I don’t drink at all. Surely you and Mrs Pan knew that?’
‘Ask anything else of me!’ pleaded Moonbeam. ‘But I wouldn’t dare take it back -
you know Mrs Pan’s temper. If I tell her you don’t drink, she’ll never believe me;
she’ll say - I’ve failed in my duty.’
Reluctantly Xue Ke allowed her to leave the wine too. Moonbeam began to leave, but
on reaching the doorway she took a quick look outside and glanced back at Xue Ke
with a smile. Pointing in the direction of Xia Jin-gui’s apartment she said:
‘I think she might even come over herself to thank you for all you’ve done...’
Xue Ke was not sure how to take this, and began to feel rather nervous.
‘Please convey my thanks to Mrs Pan will you? The weather is cold, and she must
be careful not to catch a chill. Besides she is my cousin s wife and there’s no need for
her to go to such lengths.’
Moonbeam said nothing but tittered and went on her way.
At first Xue Ke had been prepared to accept the offering as a genuine expression of
gratitude on Jin-gul’s part. But now Moonbeam’s suggestive behaviour had aroused
his suspicions, and he began to think there was something fishy going on.
‘But surely Jin-gui would never think of such a thing?’ he argued with himself. ‘She
is my sister-in-law.
Perhaps it’s Moonbeam up to no good. She can’t very well act on her own initiative.
Maybe she is using Jin-gui as a cover. . . But then she’s Pan’s chamber-wife so that’s
hardly very...’
Suddenly it occurred to him:
‘Of course! Jin-gui’s no lady! Sometimes when she’s in the mood, she gets herself
up like a regular harlot - she obviously fancies herself as some sort of man-killer!
Another possibility is that she’s fallen out with Bao-qin and this is a plot to disgrace
me and drag the family name in the mud...’
Xue Ke could not help finding all this rather daunting, and was racking his brains for
some means of dealing with the situation, when to his great alarm he heard a
splutter of laughter outside the window. But to discover who was laughing, you must
turn to the next chapter.




CHAPTER 91



In the pursuance of lust,
Moonbeam evolves an artful strata gem
In a flight of Zen,
Bao-yu makes an enigmatic confession



We saw in our last chapter how Xue Ke was startled from his troubled reflections by a
sudden splutter of laughter from outside his window.
‘Moonbeam again! Or Jin-gui!’ he thought to himself. ‘I shall ignore them and see
what happens.’
He listened for a while but there was no further sound. Not daring to touch the wine
and sweetmeats, he closed the door and was about to undress when he heard a faint
tap at the paper casement. He was already rattled by Moonbeam’s behaviour and
beginning to feel out of his depth. Hearing the tapping and yet unable to detect a
pre?sence outside the window, he didn’t know what to think. He did up his gown
again and sat down abstractedly by the lamp. He took a sweetmeat from the table
and turned it over restlessly in his hand, studying it from every angle. Suddenly
something made him look round. A small peep?hole (of the lick-and-spittle variety)
had appeared in the window. Going across and putting his eye to the hole, he
squinted through and received a blast of air in the face that quite startled the wits
out of him. It was followed by another splutter of laughter. Rushing back, he blew out
the. lamp and lay down in the darkness, holding his breath.
A voice came from outside:
‘Are you going to sleep without trying the wine and sweetmeats?’
Xue Ke recognized it as Moonbeam’s voice but said nothing and lay there pretending
to be asleep.
A few seconds later, in a disgruntled tone:
‘Miserable spoilsport! You don’t know what you’re missing!’
This time he could not identify the voice with any cer?tainty. It sounded like
Moonbeam, but there was some?thing of Xia Jin-gui’s expression in it too. Whoever
it was, there was no longer any doubt in his mind as to their in?tentions. He tossed
and turned for most of that night, and it was not until after five o’clock that he finally
fell asleep.
Shortly after dawn someone knocked at the door.
‘Who’s there?’ Xue Ke called out.
No answer. He got out of bed to open the door and saw Moonbeam, her hair combed
simply back, wearing a tight little sleeveless jacket, its gold-striped neck-line cut in
the shape of a guitar, its buttons seductively undone. She had a new-looking viridian
scarf around her neck and instead of a skirt was sporting pomegranate-red
lined?pantaloons of a flowery design, and a pair of smart red embroided slippers. She
had come before doing her morn?ing toilet, to remove the sweetmeats before the
rest of the household arose. Though rather taken aback to see her advancing into his
room en négligé’, he asked politely:
‘Why are you up so early this morning?’
Moonbeam blushed in reply, piled the sweetmeats onto one plate and went out
holding it in both hands. Xue Ke interpreted this as pique at her failure ~o seduce him
the previous evening.
‘Oh well,’ he thought to himself, ‘it’s too bad if I’ve annoyed them. At least they’ll
lose interest and leave me alone.’
He decided that he could forget about the whole busi?ness, and called for water to
wash his face. It would be wise, he decided, to stay at home and take a couple pf
days rest, for his own health and peace of mind, and also to avoid tile unwelcome
attentions of Xue Pan’s so-called friends, who seeing the Xue family deprived of its
head and observing his own youth and inexperience, had caught the scent of money
in the air. Some of them would have been content to act as messengers; some
professed a know?ledge of legal phraseology or claimed contacts behind the scenes
and offered to deliver bribes to the officials and minions involved in the case; others
advised him to make some money out of it for himself, while a few even tried scaring
him with false rumours. Since he first encountered them, Xue Ke had done his utmost
to avoid these un?savoury elements, but was aware that by openly rebuffing them
he might create further trouble for himself. The only safe course, he concluded, was
to lie low at home and await the confirmation of Pan’s sentence.
*

To return to Xia Jin-gui. She had sent Moonbeam over on the previous night with the
wine and sweetmeats in order to explore Xue Ke’s susceptibility to her charms. When
Moonbeam returned and described in detail what had hap?pened, Jin-gui realized
that she had miscalculated and that by pursuing such a strategy she would cause
herself much pointless trouble and forfeit Moonbeam’s respect. If she were to
disguise her disappointment with a few words of feigned indifference, that would do
nothing to relieve her own hankering after Xue Ke. Unable for the present to think of
any other means of achieving her ends, she sat in moody silence.
She was unaware that Moonbeam had been thinking along exactly the same lines as
herself. Moonbeam too reckoned that Xue Pan might not be back for some time and
felt in dire need of a substitute. She had only been held back from procuring one by
the fear of being caught at it by Jin-gui. Now that Jin-gui had made the first move,
however, Moonbeam was only too glad to cruise along in her wake. She would step
in first and become Xue Ke’s mistress, and Jin-gui would have no choice but to accept
the fait accompli. Such was the reasoning behind her provocative behaviour.
Her first impression had been that the young master showed promise. True, he was
not exactly leaping into her arms. She would have to play him slowly, which is
pre?cisely what she was doing when, to her intense dis?appointment, he blew out
the lamp and went to bed. She reported back to Jin-gui, anxious to see what new
course of action she might suggest. As nothing was forthcoming from her mistress
however but this moody silence, she helped her prepare for the night and herself
went to bed.
She had a sleepless night. As she lay tossing and turn?ing, a new plan began to take
shape in her mind. She would rise early and go to Xue Ke’s apartment at once to
collect the tray; she would slip on a couple of the more alluring items in her
wardrobe, but otherwise not bother with her morning toilet, in order to look as
sleepy and seductive as possible, straight from the boudoir... She would observe
what effect this had on Xue Ke, while maintaining a show of annoyance and
indifference towards him. This surely would be his chance to repent of his folly. She
could help him aboard and pip Jin-gui at the post.
In the event Xue Ke the morning after proved as totally incorruptible as he had been
the evening before, and Moonbeam found herself obliged to go through in earnest
with her charade of walking out in a huff. She did how?ever still keep her wits
sufficiently about her to leave behind the wine-jug, as a pretext for one final
manoeuvre.
‘Did anyone see you when you fetched the things?’Jin?g-gui asked her on her
return.
‘Not a soul.’
‘What about Master Ke? Did he have anything to say?’
‘No.’
Jin-gui too had spent a sleepless night, without having thought of any alternative
plan of campaign.
‘If I am to go ahead with things,’ she thought to herself, ‘I can hardly hope to keep
Moonbeam in the dark much longer. I shall have to bring her in on it. I’m sure she
won t say anything then. Besides I need her to act as a go-between. I can’t go myself.
I’d better talk to her and see if we can’t think of a good plan between us.’
She smiled at Moonbeam and asked:
‘What do you make of Master Ke anyway?’ ‘He seems rather a fool.’
Jin-gui laughed.
‘How dare you insult one of the masters like that...’
Moonbeam laughed.
‘He’s asking for it, giving you the bird like that...’
‘And just what do you mean by that?’
‘Oh, only the way he wouldn’t touch any of the sweet?meats you sent of course...
What else?’
She said this with a smirk and a meaningful look at Jin-?gui, who replied:
‘That’s quite enough of your insinuations! I sent those things to thank him for all
that he’s done for Mr Pan, and I only asked you what had happened in case people
had been gossiping. I have no idea what you are trying to suggest.’
‘There’s no need to worry, ma’am,’ said Moonbeam coolly. ‘I’m on your side, you
can count on me. But we must be very discreet. It would be serious if word got
around.’
Jin-gui felt her face burning.
‘You little whore! So you’ve fallen for him have you, and think you can use me as a
cover for your goings-on, is that it?’
‘Think so if you like, ma’am. I was only trying to help. If you really fancy him, I think
I have a plan.. "Every mouse will steal oil if he can." He’s just scared of being found
out, and wants to keep out of trouble. You must be patient, ma’am. Find as many
little ways as you can of making yourself helpful. He is Mr Pan’s younger cousin, after
all, and doesn’t have a wife. If you set your mind to it, I am sure you can get yourself
into his good books, and no one will be able to say a word against you for it. In a few
days he’ll be ready to show his gratitude by paying you a return visit. You lay on a
little party here -I’ll help you get him drunk - and he’s yours! If he won’t play, we’ll
create a scene and accuse him of making a pass that should clinch it. He’ll be too
scared to say no then! If he still holds out, why then we’ll know that he’s just a sissy
and not worth wasting time over anyway. What do you think?’
Jin-gui was puce in the face.
‘Why you little strumpet! I can see you’ve had a few in your time! No wonder Pan
couldn’t let you out of his sight!’
Moonbeam pulled a face and laughed.
‘Is that all the thanks I get for helping to bring the two of you together?’
From now on Jin-gui’s only thought was the conquest of Xue Ke. And as she wished to
accomplish this without attracting attention, the Xue compound enjoyed a brief
respite from its usual alarms and excursions.
Later that same day Moonbeam went to collect the wine-jug. She was as
scrupulously well-behaved as she had been in the morning, and caused Xue Ke, who
watched her out of the corner of his eye, a certain amount of remorse and
self-doubt.
‘Perhaps I was wrong,’ he thought to himself. ‘Perhaps I’ve been imagining the
whole thing, and they really meant well. In which case my ingratitude may have
offended her and who knows what trouble this may lead to. And it will all have been
my own fault...’
A couple of days went by and all was quiet. Whenever he saw Moonbeam, she
lowered her head and walked away without so much as a glance in his direction.
Jin-gui, on the other hand, pursued him with an eagerness that made him feel most
uncomfortable. But of all this more later.
*

Aunt Xue and Bao-chai noticed how quiet Jin-gui had be?come all of a sudden, and
how charming she was being to everyone. The change came as a great surprise, but
noth?ing could have pleased Aunt Xue more, and she reasoned to herself about it
thus:
‘At the time of his marriage Pan must have crossed some unlucky star, which is
what has caused all his subse?quent misfortune. Thanks to our financial resources
and the efforts of the Jias we have managed to avert disaster in this court-case, and
perhaps this sudden change on Jin?-gui’s part is a sign that his luck has turned for the
good...’
 It was in fact not far short of a miracle. One day after lunch Aunt Xue thought she
would pay Jin-gui a visit, and set off supported by Prosper. She reached the
court?yard in front of Jin-gui’s apartment, when she heard a man S voice engaged in
conversation with Jin-gui outside. Prosper called ahead diplomatically:
‘Mrs Pan, Mrs Xue is here to see you!’
They were already in the doorway. As they advanced the figure of a man could be
dimly seen escaping behind the door. Aunt Xue recoiled in alarm.
‘Do please come in and sit down, Mother,’ said Jin-gui. ‘That’s only my adopted
brother Xia San. He’s from the country and not used to company. This is the first time
he has been here and he has never been introduced. He was intending to call on you
to pay his respects.’
‘If he is your brother, then I should be glad to meet him,’ said Aunt Xue.
Jin-gui called her brother out from his hiding-place, and he made a bow and paid his
respects. Aunt Xue replied politely and sat down.
‘How long have you been in the capital?’ she asked by way of conversation.
‘I was only adopted into the family two months ago. Mother needed someone to
look after household business. I arrived the day before yesterday, and came here
today to see my new sister.’
Aunt Xue could see that he was rather an uncouth sort of fellow, and did not like to
stay long.
‘I must be going,’ she said. ‘Don’t get up.’
Then turning to Jin-gui:
‘As this is your brother’s first visit, please invite him to stay for dinner.’
‘Yes, Mother.’
Aunt Xue took her leave.
When she was out of the room, Jin-gui turned to Xia San.
‘Sit down. I’ve kept our connection open and above board on purpose, so as to
avoid suspicion from young Master Ke. I’ve some things I want you to buy for me in
town, and I don’t want anyone to know about them.’
‘Of course, sis. Leave it to me. Give me the cash and I’ll guarantee to deliver the
goods.’
‘Not so fast: you’d better be careful not to be swindled, or I might not accept
delivery...’
After a little more banter of this kind, Jin-gui had din?ner with Xia San, after which
she specified her commis?sions, gave him certain other instructions and he went on
his way. From that day on he became a frequent visitor at Jin-gui’s apartment. The
old janitor usually let him through without going through the proper procedure of
making an announcement, knowing him to be Mrs Pan’s brother. His visits provided
the wherewithal for many a plot. But we anticipate.
*

One day a letter arrived from Xue Pan. Aunt Xue opened it and sent for Bao-chai to
read it to her. This is what it said:
‘Dear Mother,
I am being reasonably treated here in prison, so please set your mind at rest. I had
some bad news yester?day however, from the clerk of the court. My sentence was
approved at the prefectural level - I presume the fami?ly had been in touch with the
prefect. But when the case came up before the circuit court, the Taotai rejected the
judgement. The secretary here at the yamen has been very helpful and has sent an
immediate petition in defence of the original judgement. But the Taotai has issued an
of?ficial statement reprimanding the local mandarin for mal?practice. He wants .me
to appear before the circuit court. If I do, I could be in trouble again. We can’t have
approached the Taotai yet. Please send someone to do this as soon as my letter
reaches you. And send Cousin Ke here at once. Any delay may result in my being sent
under escort to the circuit court. On no account stint the money! Extremely urgent!’
This sent Aunt Xue into floods of tears. Bao-chai and Xue Ke did their best to calm her
down, while at the same time impressing upon her the need to act swiftly. Once
again she was obliged to part with her nephew - bags were packed, money weighed
out, and Xue Ke prepared to set off that same night with one of the family
shop-assistants. It was a night of feverish activity, and Bao-chai herself stayed up till
the early hours, helping and making sure that nothing was overlooked by the
servants. The com?bination of nervous strain and physical exhaustion proved too
much for a girl of her gentle nature and refined up?bringing, and the next morning
she went down with a fever and was unable to swallow water or medicine.
Oriole reported this at once to Aunt Xue, who came hurrying over. Finding Bao-chai
unable to speak, her face bright red, her body burning hot to the touch, she
im?mediately panicked and burst into tears. Bao-qin tried to comfort and support her
aunt, while Caltrop was so affected by Bao-chai’s appearance that she could only
stand by the bedside calling her name and weeping. Bao?chai was too weak to speak
or move her hands. Her eyes were dry, her nose blocked. They sent for the doctor,
whose prescription gradually brought her round and to the family’s intense relief the
immediate crisis seemed to have been averted. The news had already reached the
various inner apartments of the Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions, and a maid soon
arrived from Xi-feng’s with one of her Ten Fragrances Revivifying Pills, followed by a
maid with one of Lady Wang’s Most Precious Pills. Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing, Lady
Wang and all the ladies from both mansions including You-shi all sent maids to
inquire how she was getting on, but all agreed that her illness should be kept a secret
from Bao-yu. She went on taking various remedies for seven or eight days with no
real improvement; it was only when she remem?bered her own Cold Fragrance Pills
and took three of these that she began to recover. By the time Bao-yu learnt of her
illness, she was already better and he did not go to visit her.
A letter arrived from Xue Ke, which Aunt Xue did not show to Bao-chai, for fear of
upsetting her. She read it herself and went straight to Lady Wang to beg for her help,
at the same time giving her an account of Bao-chai’s condition. After Aunt Xue had
gone to bed, Lady Wang went in to plead with Jia Zheng.
‘With the higher-ranking officials a word is usually suf?ficient; but these provincials
clearly need a more tangible incentive,’ he said somewhat grimly. ‘We shall have to
dip into our pockets.’
Lady Wang went on to talk of Bao-chai:
‘The poor girl! I feel responsible for her: she is almost one of the family. The sooner
she and Bao-yu are married the better. It is ruining her health the way things are.’
‘1 agree,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘But her family are very dis?organized at present. And
besides, it is midwinter. New Year will soon be upon us, and we shall all be busy
put?ting our affairs in order. 1 propose the following time?table: the betrothal can
take place sometime during the winter; early next year they can exchange presents;
and the ceremony itself should be fixed for sometime after Mother’s birthday. I
should like you to put this to your sister.
‘I will,’ replied Lady Wang.
The next day she told Aunt Xue, who thought the proposal a good one. After lunch
the two of them went to see Grandmother Jia.
‘Have you just come over, my dear?’ inquired Grand?mother Jia of Aunt Xue, after
the usual courtesies had been exchanged.
‘No, I was here yesterday,’ replied Aunt Xue. ‘But as it was rather late, I was not able
to come and pay my respects.’
Lady Wang repeated Jia Zheng’s proposal to Grand?mother Jia, who seemed very
happy with it. While they were talking, Bao-yu came into the room.
‘Have you had your lunch yet?’ asked his grandmother.
‘I’ve been home for lunch,’ he replied, ‘and now I’m on my way back to school. I
called in. to see you, Grannie, and also I heard that Aunt Xue was here and wanted to
pay my respects.’
Turning to Aunt Xue he continued:
‘Is Cousin Chai quite better now?’
Aunt Xue smiled.
‘Yes she is.’
Bao-yu noticed that his arrival had caused a sudden lull in the conversation. After
sitting with them for a few min?utes, he also noticed that Aunt Xue was not being as
affectionate towards him as usual, and mused to himself:
‘Even if she’s not in a good mood, I don’t see why they have to stop talking to me
altogether...’
He set off for school greatly perplexed by what had happened.
That evening on his return he paid his usual evening calls and made his way to the
Naiad’s House. Lifting the door-curtain, he went in and was received by Nightingale.
Seeing that there was no one in the inner room, he asked Nightingale where Dai-yu
had gone, and was informed that she had gone to call on Grandmother Jia.
‘Miss Lin heard that Mrs Xue was there,’ said Nightin?gale, ‘and wanted to pay her
respects. Haven’t you been there this evening, Master Bao?’
‘Yes, I’ve just come from there, but I didn’t see Miss Lin.’
‘Wasn’t she there?’
‘No. Where could she have gone?’
‘I’m not sure.’
Bao-yu was about to set off again when he caught sight of the graceful figure of
Dai-yu walking slowly towards the door with Snowgoose.
‘You’re back, coz!’ he exclaimed, stepping aside to let her pass, and then following
her inside. She walked into the inner room.
‘Do come in and sit down,’ she said to Bao-yu. Night?ingale fetched another jacket
and helped her into it. She sat down and asked him:
‘Did you see Mrs Xue at Grandmother’s?’
‘Yes, I did,’ replied Bao-yu.
‘Did she mention me at all?’
‘No. And she didn’t seem as friendly as usual towards me either. When I asked after
Cousin Chai she just smiled and hardly said anything. I hope I haven’t offended her by
not going over to visit Chai this last couple of days.’
Dai-yu gave a short laugh.
‘Have you been to see her?’
‘I didn’t know she was ill at first,’ protested Bao-yu, ‘I only heard a day or two ago,
and I still haven’t been...’
‘Well that’s certain to be the reason...’
‘The truth is that neither Grandmother, Mother nor Father would let me go, and
how could I without their permission? I used to be able to drop round and see her
ten times a day if I felt like it; but now they’ve closed the little side-gate and I have to
go round by the front, which is such a performance.’
‘But how’s she supposed to know all that?’
‘You know Chai: she’s sure to make allowances for me.’
‘You shouldn’t take it for granted,’ retorted Dai-yu.’Perhaps she won’t. It’s not as if
it’s her mother who’s been ill: it’s Chai herself. Think of all the poetry contests, all the
pleasures you’ve shared with her in the past - the flowers, the wine, the parties. Now
she’s separated from us, and you know the troubles her family are having, yet when
she falls seriously ill you behave with complete indifference. She’s bound to be
offended.’
Bao-yu: ‘Surely you don’t mean she doesn’t like me any more?’
Dai-yu: ‘I have no idea. I can only surmise how she might reasonably be expected to
feel.’
Bao-yu stared in silence. Dai-yu ignored him, told one of her maids to put some more
incense on the brazier, took out a book and began reading it. After a minute or two
Bao-yu frowned and stamped his foot fretfully.
‘What’s the point in my being alive? The world would be an altogether better place
without this thing called “me”.’
‘Can’t you see?’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s the illusion of "me" that creates the illusion of
"others", and a life lived under these twin illusions is bound to be beset with
frustrations, fears, confusion, foolish dreams and a host of other obsta?cles and
entanglements. I wasn’t speaking in earnest earlier on. Mrs Xue was just in low spirits
when you saw her. There was no need for you to bring Cousin Chai into it. Mrs Xue
came over because of Cousin Pan’s court-case. She was worried, and it’s hardly
surprising she wasn’t in the mood to entertain you. You just allowed your
imagination to run away with you and lead you astray.’
Her words brought Bao-yu a sudden sense of enlighten?ment.
‘Of course!’ he exclaimed with a laugh. ‘That’s exactly it! You’re so much more
perceptive than I am! No wonder you defeated me with that koan last year, when I
was so wrought up. For all my pretensions, I need you to guide me to the truth. This
bumptious Buddha bows to your Single Flower!’
‘In that case,’ said Dai-yu, seeing her opportunity, ‘pre?pare yourself for another
inquisition.’
Bao-yu crossed his legs, brought the palms of his hands together, closed his eyes,
pursed his lips and said:
‘Pray begin.’
Dai-yu: ‘Now, let the First of my Propositions be that Cousin Chai likes you.
Proposition the Second: she likes you not. The Third: she liked you a few days ago,
but does no more. The Fourth: she does today, but will not do tomorrow. The Fifth:
you like her, but she likes you not. The Sixth and last: she likes you, btit you like her
not. Consider these Six Propositions well.’
For several minutes Bao-yu was completely silent. Then suddenly he burst out
laughing and cried:
‘If all the Seas of Paradise were mine, with my simple gourd I’d be content.’
Dai-yu: ‘What if your gourd is carried away by the stream?’
Bao-yu: ‘Never! Wherever the stream flows, the gourd will always hold its own
course.’
Dai-yu: ‘What if the flow comes to an end and your Pearl sinks?’
Bao-yu: ‘“Like a catkin held fast in a puddle,
    This Zen Mind:
    Not a partridge, gaily cavorting
    In the spring wind.”’
Dai-yu: ‘The first rule of Zen is not to tell lies.’
Bao-yu: ‘But it’s the truth, so help me Buddha, the Dharma and the Holy
Brotherhood.’
Dai-yu lowered her head in silence. She heard a ‘caw?caw’ outside the window, and a
crow flew up into the sky, wheeling towards the south-east.
Bao-yu: ‘What sort of an omen is that?’
Dai-yu: ‘Our fates cannot be learned from the cries of birds.’
Before Bao-yu could think of a reply, Ripple came into the room and said: ‘Master
Bao, please hurry! The Master sent someone to the Garden to ask if you were home
from school yet, Aroma said you were, so you’d better be quick!’
Bao-yu jumped to his feet and hurried out in alarm. Dai-yu did not try to detain him.
For the outcome, please read the next chapter.

CHAPTER 92



Qiao-jie studies the Lives of Noble Women
and shows a precocious enthusiasm for Virtue
    Jia Zheng admires a Mother Pearl
and reflects on the vicissitudes of Life



‘What does Father want me for?’ asked Bao-yu in some alarm, as they left the
Naiad’s House. Ripple smiled.
‘He doesn’t. Aroma told me to fetch you, and I was afraid you wouldn’t come, so I
made it up...’
Bao-yu was greatly relieved.
‘I would have come. There’s really no need to scare me like that.’
He arrived hack at Green Delights, to be interrogated by Aroma:
‘Where have you been all this time?’
‘At Miss Lin’s. I got delayed. We were chatting about Aunt Xue and Cousin Chai’s
illness.’
‘What were you saying?’ asked Aroma inquisitively.
Bao-yu described his Zen dialogue with Dai-yu.
‘You two are so silly,’ was Aroma’s comment. ‘Why can’t you have a normal
conversation about ordinary things, or discuss something nice like poetry? What do
you have to go talking about Zen for? You’re not a monk!’
‘You don’t understand,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘We have our Zen secrets. No one else
could join in our conversations.’
‘I dare say,’ returned Aroma, with a scornful sniff. ‘I’m sure that if you two went on
Zennifying at each other till you were both blue in the face, we should still be
standing here quite as much in the dark as ever.’
‘When I was younger,’ said Bao-yu, ignoring her jibes, ‘and Dai-yu was rather more
childish in her ways, some?how I always managed to upset her by saying the wrong
thing. Nowadays I think more about what I say, and she takes offence less easily. But
all the same I have noticed that when we meet, which is not very often, as she
seldom visits me and I have to spend so much time studying, we almost seem to have
grown apart in some way.
‘I should hope so too,’ said Aroma. ‘Now that the two of you are older, of course
you must learn to be more dis?creet.’
Bao-yu nodded his head irritably.
‘I know - let’s not talk any more about that now. What I want to know is, has
anyone come over from Grand?mother’s with a message?’
‘No.’
‘Then she must have forgotten!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tomor?row’s the First of the Eleventh,
isn’t it? Every year Gran?nie has a party and invites the whole family over to
cele?brate the beginning of the Lessening Cold season, when the days start to get
longer. I’ve already asked for the day off school, in fact. What am I to do? Should I go
to school or not? If I do, that will be my day-off wasted. If I don’t, and Father finds
out, he’ll scold me for playing truant.’
‘I think you should go,’ replied Aroma. ‘You’ve lust started to make progress with
your studies, and this is no time to be thinking of letting up. You should be working as
hard as you can. Only yesterday I heard Her Ladyship say how well young Lan is doing
at his studies. When he gets back from school lie settles straight down to his texts
and compositions all on his own, and never goes to bed till the small hours. You’re his
uncle, and several years older than him. If you let him overtake you Her Old Ladyship
will be very displeased. So I say, off to school early in the morning.’
Musk did not agree, however.
‘In this cold weather?’ she objected. ‘lf you go now, they’ll wonder why you asked
for the day off in the first place. It will look as though you were inventing an excuse
to get off school. I think you should make the most of it and have a day’s rest. If Her
Old Ladyship has forgotten to have a party, we can always have one here instead...’
‘Now he’ll never go, and it will all be your fault,’ complained Aroma.
‘I believe in taking each day as it comes and having fun whenever you can,’ said
Musk defiantly. ‘I don’t believe in sucking up to people and working myself to death
for a two-tael bonus every month like you do, Aroma dear...’
Aroma spat at her:
‘You little hussy! Interfering in a serious discussion in such a silly manner...’
‘On the contrary, I was saying it for your sake, dear...’
‘For my sake?’
‘Yes. As soon as Master Bao’s gone to school, you’ll sit around mooning and
moaning again, longing for him to come home and bring the sunshine back into your
life. Don’t think you can fool me with that holier-than-thou attitude of yours...’
Aroma was on the point of giving Musk a large piece of her mind when one of
Grandmother Jia’s maids arrived and said:
‘Her Old Ladyship says Master Bao’s not to go to school tomorrow. Mrs Xue’s been
invited round to spend the day, and all the young ladies will probably be coming too.
Miss Shi, Miss Xing and Mrs Zhu’s cousins have all been invited. It’s to celebrate the
"lessening cold" or some such thing...’
‘I told you so!’ cried Bao-yu with glee before she could finish. ‘It’s always been one
of Grannie’s favourite occa?sions. Now I can have the day off and a clear conscience!’
Aroma said nothing, and Grandmother Jia’s maid returned.
Bao-yu’s recent stint of self-application had in fact left him more or less gasping for a
respite of this sort. He was also delighted to hear that Aunt Xue was coming, as that
would surely mean a chance to see Bao-chai.
‘Let’s have an early night,’ he said. ‘I want to be up first thing tomorrow.’
The night passed uneventfully, and early next morning, true to his resolution, Bao-yu
went to pay his respects to Grandmother Jia and then to his father and mother, to
whom he reported that ‘Grannie had given him the day off school’. Jia Zheng raised
no objection and Bao-yu with?drew from his presence at a snail’s pace, waiting till he
was a few yards from the study before breaking into a run and racing to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The other guests had not yet arrived, but he saw a
nurse and a few younger maids enter the room with Xi-feng’s little girl Qiao-jie, who
walked up to her great-grandmother, paid her re?spects and said:
‘Mama told me to come and say my good-morning and sit with you first,
Great-grannie. She says she’ll be here by and by.’
The old lady laughed.
‘Bless you child! Here I’ve been sitting since cockcrow, and none of my guests has
turned up, except your Uncle Bao.’
Qiao-jie’s nurse did some discreet prompting:
‘Say good morning to your uncle, Miss.’
Qiao-jie did so, and Bao-yu returned the greeting.
‘My Mama wants to see you, Uncle Bao,’ said Qiao-jie. ‘She said so yesterday.’
‘What about?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘She says she wants to find out if I’ve learnt my charac?ters properly after all my
lessons with Nannie Li. I prom?ised her I had and offered to read them out for her.
But she thought I was guessing and didn’t believe me. She said I couldn’t have learnt
them because all I do all day long is play. But I don’t think learning characters is hard.
I can even read my Girl’s Classic of Filial Piety - it’s ever so easy. Mama thinks I’m
making it up, so she wants you to go over it with me when you’ve got the time.’

Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘Bless you darling! Your mother can’t read a word, that’s why she couldn’t tell if you
were cheating her or not. Tomorrow your uncle Bao will go over it with you, and she
can listen in. Then she’ll have to believe you.’
‘How many characters do you know by now?’ asked Bao-yu.
‘Over three thousand,’ replied Qiao-jie. ‘I’ve finished the Girl’s Classic, and a
fortnight ago I started on Lives of Noble Women Present and Past.’
‘Do you understand it all?’ asked Bao-yu. ‘If there’s anything you’re not clear about,
you must tell me and I’ll try and explain it for you.’
‘What a nice idea,’ commented Grandmother Jia. ‘As her uncle, you should help her
with her studies.’
Bao-yu cleared his throat.
‘Let us leave aside,’ he began, ‘such household names as the worthy queen and
consorts of Good King Wen, and pass on to those two other Models of Queenly
Capability:
Queen Jiang, who in order to rebuke her sovereign for his excessive attentions
removed all her ornaments and stood like a prisoner awaiting sentence; and the Lady
Hunch?back of Wu-yan, whose earnest remonstrations restored order in the kingdom
of Qi.’
‘Yes,’ said Qiao-jie, and Bao-yu went on:
‘For Talent, we have the lady-historian Ban Zhao, Ban Jie-yu literary concubine of
Emperor Cheng-di of Han, and the two poetesses Cai Wen-ji and Xie Dao-yun.’
‘What about Paragons of Virtue?’ asked Qiao-jie.
‘Now let me see,’ replied Bao-yu, ‘for Virtue we have Meng Guang, the wife who
wore a wooden hairpin and cotton skirts; we have Bao Xuan’s wife, who drew her
own water from the well, and Tao Kan’s mother, who cut off her hair to buy wine for
her son’s guests. Their Virtue lay in their Acceptance of Poverty.’
Qiao-jie nodded her head enthusiastically.
‘Then we have the famous cases of Hardship Endured,’ continued Bao-yu. ‘Princess
Le-chang, who after a cruel separation was reunited with her husband by the
strat?agem of the broken mirror; and Su Hui, who embroi?dered a lengthy
palindrome to send to her husband exiled in the wastes of Tartary. Then come the
Paragons of Filial Piety: Mu Lan marching to war in her ailing father’s place, Cao E
throwing herself into the river after a fruitless search for her father’s corpse - and
many others be?sides...’
Qiao-jie had become very quiet and thoughtful, and when Bao-yu went on to recount
the tale of Lady Cao who after her husband’s death cut off her nose to deter any
further suitors, and other tales of Widowed Virtue, her little face became more
serious than ever. Thinking this might all be making her feel uncomfortable, Bao-yu
introduced an apocryphal category of his own invention:
‘Then of course we have the Famous Beauties, romantic ladies such as Wang
Zhao-jun, Xi-shi, Cherry Lips, Wil?low Waist, Crimson Fairy, Zhuo Wen-jun, Red
Duster - all of these were...’
‘Enough!’ interrupted Grandmother Jia, seeing the blank look on Qiao-jie’s face.
‘No more! You’ve filled the poor child’s head to overflowing. How can she possibly
remember all those names?’
‘I recognize some of the names Uncle Bao mentioned,’ said Qiao-jie. ‘And his talk
has certainly helped me to understand the ones I know.’
‘I don’t think we need bother going over the written characters for all those
names,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m sure you know them.’
‘Mama said that our Crimson used to be one of your maids,’ said Qiao-jie out of the
blue. ‘And she says she still hasn’t found you anyone to replace her. She’s think?ing of
giving you Mrs Liu’s daughter, Fivey I think her name is, if you’re happy about it...’
Bao-yu was delighted to hear this and said with a grin:
‘Your mother doesn’t have to ask me about things like that. She makes all the
decisions.’
He turned with a smile to Grandmother Jia.
‘My young niece shows every sign of growing up to be a second Cousin Feng. Only I
think she may be even cleverer, and will have the added advantage of being able to
read.’
‘I’ve no objection to girls learning their letters,’ com?mented Grandmother Jia. ‘But
needlework must always come first.’
‘ Nannie Liu teaches me embroidery,’ said Qiao-jie. ‘I can do flowers and
chain-patterns. I’m not very good yet, but I’m learning.’
‘In a family like ours,’ said Grandmother J ia, ‘we never need to do our own sewing,
I know. But it’s as well to know how. Then you will never be at the mercy of others.’
‘Yes, Great-grannie,’ Qiao-jie smilingly replied. She would have welcomed some
more Paragons of Virtue, but thought Bao-yu looked a little preoccupied and did not
venture to ask.
What was preoccupying Bao-yu? The answer lies in Qiao-jie’s mention of Fivey. This
attractive girl had been originally designated for Green Delights, but one obstacle
after another had so far prevented her from entering ser?vice there. First it had been
illness; then they had been wary of choosing a good-looking maid for Bao-yu in the
puritanical phase that followed on Lady Wang’s expulsion of Skybright. A further
opportunity of seeing her had pre?sented itself when she and her mother had
arrived with gifts during his secret visit to Skybright at her cousin’s house - and his
earlier favourable impression of her had been confirmed. She really was extremely
pretty. What marvellous luck that Xi-feng should have remem?bered her now, and
was arranging for her to take Crim?son’s place!
While Bao-yu was day-dreaming, Grandmother Jia was becoming more and more
impatient at the lateness of her guests and sent word to hurry them along. A few
minutes later the first contingent arrived: Li Wan and her two cousins Wen and Qi,
Tan-chun, Xi-chun, Shi Xiang-yun and Lin Dai-yu. They all paid their respects to
Grand?mother Jia and greeted one another. Aunt Xue had still not come, and
Grandmother Jia sent for her. Finally she arrived, accompanied by Bao~q in. Bao-yu
paid his re?spects, and said hello to Bao-qm, wondering why it was that neither
Bao-chai nor Xing Xiu-yan had come. When Dai-yu asked outright, ‘Why couldn’t
Cousin Chai come today?’, Aunt Xue pretended that she was not feeling well. Xiu-yan
had stayed away because she knew that Aunt Xue (her future mother-in-law) would
be there. Bao-chai’s absence caused a momentary depression in Bao-yu’s spirits,
which was however soon dispelled by the presence of Dai-yu.
Lady Xing and Lady Wang arrived shortly afterwards. Xi-feng, who heard that they
were there before her and was embarrassed at the thought of being late, sent
Patience ahead to apologize for her.
‘Mrs Lian was meaning to come, but she has had a bit of a fever and won’t be
coming till later,’ said Patience.
‘If she’s not feeling well, she needn’t bother to come at all,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘We ought to start our lunch now.’
The maids moved the charcoal brazier to the back of the room and placed two tables
in front of Grandmother Jia’s couch, at which the party now arranged itself for lunch.
After lunch they sat once more round the brazier chatting pleasantly, and there for
the present we must leave them.
*

What was really detaining Xi-feng? It had at first been no more than her
embarrassment at being later than Ladies Xing and Wang. But this had been further
complicated by the arrival of Brightie’s wife, who informed her that one of
Ying-chun’s women-servants had come to pay her re?spects. The woman had come
straight to Xi-feng’s apartment and had not notified the main mansion of her
pres?ence. Xi-feng was puzzled, and summoned her into the room.
‘Is your mistress well?’ she asked.
‘Anything but well,’ replied the woman. ‘But that’s not what I’ve come about,
ma’am. Really it was Chess’s mother who begged me to come and ask you for a
favour.’
‘But Chess has been dismissed,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What have her affairs to do with me
now?’
‘It’s a long story, ma’am. From the day she was dismiss?ed Chess did nothing but
cry her heart out. Then one day that cousin of hers, her boy-friend Pan You-an,
turned up again. Her mother was terribly rude to him when she saw him, swearing
that he’d been her daughter’s ruin. She took hold of him and tried to hit him, while
he stood there meek and mild not saying a word. Chess heard what was going on and
came rushing out and cried defiantly: "It was because of him I was dismissed - I don’t
need remind?ing! I know he acted wrong! But now that he’s come back, why start
hitting him? You may as well strangle me instead..." "You shameless slut!" cries the
m6ther, "what do you want then?" "A girl can only marry once," replies Chess
defiantly. "It was my mistake, I let him take me, and right or wrong I’m his now and
no one else shall have me. If he could only have shown a little more cour?age then
and stood by me instead of running away! But I’d wait for him now even if I had to
die waiting. I’d rather die than let you marry me to someone else. Now that he’s here,
ask him if he’ll take me for his wife. If he still wants me, I’ll make you my farewell
kotow and you can forget that I ever existed. I’ll follow him to the ends of the earth.
I’ll beg in the streets if need be!" This put her mother in a terrible rage. Weeping and
cursing she cried: "You’re my daughter and if I say you can’t marry him then you can’t,
and that’s that!" But Chess was an obstinate creature. No sooner had her mother
said this than she took a run at the wall and dashed her head against it. She split her
skull open, the blood came pouring out and in a moment she was dead! Her mother
began howling, but it was too late. Next she started screaming at him that he’d have
to pay with his life. He replied - and this is the strangest part of the story -"Don’t
worry. I’m a wealthy man now. I never forgot your daughter, and came back today to
find her. I have always been true to her. To prove that I’m telling no lie. . ." As he said
this he brought out a casket from in?side his gown, full of gold and precious stones.
One look at them and Chess’s mother changed her tune. "Why oh why didn’t you say
all this earlier?" she asked. "I know the ways of women," he replied, "how easily
swayed they are by the idea of wealth. Now at least I know for sure that she was a
girl in a million. These are ours," he added, handing her the casket. "I will go and buy
the coffin now, and see to it that she is buried properly." The mother took the casket
and left all the arrangements to her nephew. She seemed to have quite forgotten
about Chess. When he returned, she saw to her astonishment that the bearers he
had employed were bringing not one but two coffins. She asked him what he needed
two coffins for, and he replied with a strange laugh that one would not be enough.
He showed not the least sign of crying, and the mother decided his mind must have
been deranged by the shock of his grief. For a while he was busy preparing Chess’s
corpse, dry-eyed and silent, when all of a sudden before anyone had time to take in
what was happening he pulled out a knife and slit his throat and that was the end of
him. The mother realized too late what a terrible thing she had done, and broke
down in floods of tears. The whole neighbourhood knows, and they want to report
the case to the magistrate. In her distress she begged me to ask you to use your
influence to help her, ma’am, and said she would come herself and kotow to you in
gratitude.’
‘What a story!’ exclaimed Xi-feng, aghast at this recital. ‘That fate should have
brought two such examples of folly together! Now I understand that look of calm
indifference on her face when she was caught during the search of the Garden. What
a determined young thing she must have been at heart. I don’t really have time to
meddle in such things, but your story has touched my heart! Tell her mother that I
will speak to Mr Lian and send Brightie to sort the thing out for her.’
Xi-feng sent the woman on her way and herself departed to join the gathering at
Grandmother Jia’s.
*

One day, Jia Zheng was engrossed in a game of Go with one of his literary gentlemen,
Zhan Guang. It had been quite a level game, and the outcome now hung on a ko that
was in progress on one corner of the board. As they were playing, a page from the
gate came in to report that Mr Feng had arrived and was waiting outside to see Sir
Zheng.
‘See him in,’ instructed Jia Zheng.
The page did as bidden and Feng Zi-ying was shortly to be observed walking in
through the inner gateway. Jia Zheng hurried out to receive him and conducted him
through to the study. As he sat down, Feng noticed that they were playing Go.
‘Please carry on with your game,’ he said. ‘I shall be very happy to watch.’
‘My poor play is hardly a worthy spectacle for so dis?tinguished an observer,’
protested Zhan Guang with an obsequious smile.
‘You are too modest,’ said Feng. ‘Carry on please.’
‘What brings you here today?’ inquired Jia Zheng.
‘Oh, nothing of any importance,’ replied Feng. ‘Carry on, sir. I shall benefit greatly
from watching your play.’
Jia Zheng turned to his partner.
‘As Feng is an old friend and has not come on any pressing business, we may as
well finish our game first. He can sit and watch.’
‘Are you playing for stakes?’ asked Feng.
‘We are,’ replied Zhan Guang.
‘Then silence! On with the game!’
‘I don’t think we need be too strict about that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘I may be a dozen
taels up by the end, but I doubt very much if I shall see the colour of my money. I
think friend Zhan will have to stand us a few drinks instead.’
‘An excellent idea,’ said Zhan with a laugh.
‘Are you and friend Zhan on a par, sir?’ inquired Feng.
Jia Zheng laughed.
‘We used to play level, but he always lost, so I gave him a handicap of two. He still
loses. And the trouble is, he thinks he can take his moves back all the time, and gets
quite upset when I wave the rules at him.’
Zhan laughed.
‘You exaggerate, Sir Zheng...’
‘Well, we shall see...’
On this note of light-hearted banter, they continued their game. When it was finished
and they counted up the pieces, Zhan was seven down.
‘It all depended on that last ko,’ commented Feng. ‘You gained the advantage, sir,
because you were less vulnerable to a ko threat.’
Jia Zheng turned to Feng.
‘Please forgive us. How are you keeping?’
‘It has been a long while since we last met,’ said Feng. ‘My visit today is partly of a
social nature, and partly occasioned by the presence in the capital of a
deputy-prefect from Kwangsi province, who is here for an audi?ence with His Majesty
and has brought with him four curios, some of them imported, that would make
excellent palace-offerings. The first is a folding screen of twenty-four panels, carved
of pure blackwood. Though the stone used for the carved inlay - landscapes, figures,
buildings, birds and flowers - is not jade, it is a high quality serpen?tine. Each panel
has a palace scene, with fifty or sixty palace-ladies. It is called "Spring Morning in the
Han Palace". The features, gestures and costumes are rendered with great clarity. The
finish is quite exquisite, the detail and composition of the highest order. It would be
perfect for the main hall of Prospect Garden, sir. The second item is a large wall-clock
over three feet high. This is a most unusual item. It has a little figure of a boy on the
face that indicates the hour with a pointer, and inside it has a little mechanical
orchestra. Those two heavier articles I was not able to bring with me. I have however
brought the other two, which I think you will find quite fascinating.’
Feng produced an embroidered casket wrapped in several layers of white damask-silk.
Unwrapping it, he raised the lid, removed the protective pad of silk-wool be?neath it
and displayed its contents. In the top compart?ment of the casket lay a little glass
container with a fitted lid. In this container, on a piece of crimson silk that lined its
inner casing of gold, lay a magnificent lustrous pearl, as large as a longan.
‘This,’ announced Feng, ‘is known as a Mother Pearl.’
He asked for a tray and Zhang Guang handed him a tea?tray of black lacquer, asking:
‘Will this do?’
‘Perfectly,’ replied Feng, taking from the inner pocket of his gown a white silk
bundle. This too contained pearls, of an ordinary size, which he tipped out onto the
tray. He then placed the ‘Mother Pearl’ in their midst and put the tray down on the
table. Like so many perfect drops of water the smaller pearls rolled across the tray
towards the large central pearl. And when Feng lifted the ‘Mother’, all the little ones
clung to her. Not a single one was left on the tray.
‘Amazing!’ exclaimed Zhan Guang.
‘An interesting phenomenon,’ observed Jia Zheng. ‘And most appropriately named.’
‘Where is the other casket?’ asked Feng turning to his page, who promptly came
forward with a rosewood cas?ket held aloft in both hands. The three men gathered
round as it was opened. On its lining of tiger-brocade lay a length of blue gauze-like
material, many times folded.
‘And what is this?’ asked Zhan Guang.
‘This,’ replied Feng, ‘is called Byssus Net.’
He took it from the casket and laid it on the table. Folded as it was, it occupied a
space no more than five inches long and less than half an inch thick. Feng began to
unfold it. When he had done so a dozen times, it extended over the edge of the
table.
‘There are still two folds to come,’ he explained. ‘To unfold it to its full extent we
would need to hang it in a room with a high ceiling. This fabric is woven from the
Byssus, the so-called Mermaid’s Tears. In extreme heat it would make a perfect fly
and mosquito-net for use in a large reception hall. As you can see, it is extremely
light and transparent.’
‘Please do not unfold it fully,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It might prove hard to fold again.’
Feng and Zhan Guang carefully folded the net and replaced it in its casket.
‘The price being asked for these four curios is really very reasonable,’ said Feng. ‘I
think he would be willing to part with the four for twenty thousand taels. Ten
thousand for the Mother Pearl, five thousand for the Bys?sus Net and two thousand
five hundred each for the screen and striking clock.’
‘We could not possibly buy them, I’m afraid,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘But with your connections in the palace,’ said Feng, ‘surely they would make an
ideal presentation.’
‘I dare say they would,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘I dare say all sorts of things would. But
we simply haven’t the money. I would like Lady Jia to see them, all the same.’
‘By all means.’
Jia Zheng sent a page to fetch Jia Lian, who was instructed to take the pearl and the
precious net through to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. He also sent a servant to invite
Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng to come and view them.
‘There are two other items,’ Jia Lian explained to the ladies. ‘A folding screen and a
musical clock. The whole lot is going for twenty thousand taels.’
‘What!’ said Xi-feng sharply. ‘I grant you they’re fine pieces. Hut we definitely
haven’t the cash to spare. Besides we’re not like provincial viceroys and governors,
who are expected to make such offerings. No; over the years I’ve come to the
conclusion that the most sensible way to secure our financial future is to invest in
land and property-trust-land for provision of sacrificial funds, and free burial-grounds
for the clan with permanent caretakers’ quarters. Such things would be there for the
family to fall back on in hard times, an insurance against ruin. I don’t know if Grannie,
Father and Mother agree with me or not? Of course, if Sir Zheng and Father want to
buy these things, it’s entirely their decision.’
Grandmother Jia led the chorus in Xi-feng’s support.
‘You’re absolutely right, my dear.’
‘Give them back to me then,’ said Jia Lian grumpily. ‘Sir Zheng only sent me to show
them to Grandmother as a possible palace-offering. No one said anything about
buying them for ourselves. Trust you to pour cold water on the whole idea before
Grandmother has even had a chance to speak!’
Jia Lian returned to the study with the curios, and reported that Grandmother Jia did
not wish to buy them.
‘No one denies their quality,’ he said to Feng Zi-ying. ‘But we just can’t afford them.
I’ll keep my eyes open though, and if I come across a likely buyer I’ll definitely let you
know.’
Feng packed them away again, evidently disappointed. He sat and chatted for a while
without much enthusiasm, and soon made motions of leaving.
‘Won’t you stay to dinner?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘I have already taken up too much of your time...’
‘Not at all. We should be delighted.’
As they were speaking Jia She was announced. He was already in the room, and after
greeting Feng engaged him in conversation for a few minutes. Presently wine was
served and various delicacies were set on the table. After the fourth or fifth round of
wine, the subject of the curios came up again.
‘Actually it’s rather hard to sell stuff like this,’ confess?ed Feng. ‘The market is
restricted to the few illustrious families such as yours.’
‘Oh come, I am sure you will find someone,’ Jia Zheng consoled him.
‘Besides,’ observed Jia She in a rather maudlin tone, ‘we are not exactly the great
and glorious house we once were, you know. Nothing but a hollow facade...’
‘How is Mr Zhen over at Ning-guo House by the way?’ asked Feng. ‘I saw him the
other day and in the course of conversation he mentioned this new wife of his son’s.
Not a patch on his first, so he was saying. Who is she anyway? I never did ask her
name.’
‘She’s a Hu-they’re an old local family. Her father was once Taotai of the
Metropolitan Circuit,’ Jia Zheng informed him.
‘Oh, I know Intendant Hu....’ said Feng. ‘Heard that he lets some pretty rum things
go on in his house too. Still, the main thing is that the gal should have turned out all
right.’
‘I heard from someone at the Grand Secretariat that Yu-cun is to be promoted
again,’ put in Jia Lian.
‘Really?. I’m glad to hear that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Has it been made official yet?’
‘Most probably,’ said Jia Lian.
‘Yes, I heard the same myself when I was at the Board of Civil Office earlier today,’
said Feng. ‘Am I right in thinking that he is a relation of yours, sir?’
‘He is,’ answered Jia Zheng.
‘A close one?’
‘It is a long story,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘He comes originally from Hu-zhou in Chekiang. He
left home and was lodg?ing in Soochow, eking out a rather unsatisfactory existence,
when he was befriended by a gentleman named Zhen Shi-yin, who provided the
means or him to better him?self. Yu-cun later went on to become a palace graduate,
and passed out with flying colours and an immediate post?ing as a magistrate in one
of the provinces. He took one of this benefactor’s maidservants as his concubine; she
is now, I believe, his principal wife. Old Zhen himself was reduced to destitution by a
strange series of calamities, and finally disappeared without trace.’
‘We only came to know Yu-cun,’ continued Jia Zheng, ‘when my brother-in-law, Lin
Ru-hai, who at that time was the Yangchow Salt Commissioner, engaged him as
private tutor for his daughter - this was after his dismissal. Then Yu-cun learned of
the general reinstatement for dis?missed officials and planned to come up to the
capital to take advantage of it. My niece - Ru-hai’s daughter - was, as it so happened,
just about to come and visit us here, so her father persuaded her tutor to travel with
her and act as her escort. He also sent me a letter of recommendation, asking me to
put in a good word for him where I could. I formed a favourable impression of him,
and from then on we saw a good deal of one another. One thing I remember finding
most extraordinary about Yu-cun: he seemed to have familiarized himself with every
detail of our family history. There was nothing he did not know. Who our ancestors
were, how they won their titles, every ramifica?tion of the Rong-guo and Ning-guo
family trees, exactly how many of us there are, who we all are, where we all live,
what we all do - why, he was a mine of information! I liked him for it, I must say.
Jia Zheng smiled, and went on:
‘He’s done extremely well for himself in the last few years too. Promoted from
Prefect to Censor, then in a few years to Vice-president of the Board of Civil Office,
then President of the Board of War. He was demoted three grades for some incident,
but now it seems he is to be promoted again.’
‘How hard it is to predict the vicissitudes of human life,’ commented Feng Zi-ying.
‘And yet there is a pattern in all things,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Take your p earl for instance.
The big one is like a man blessed with fortune; the little ones are his dependants,
sheltering in the shade of his influence. If the big one goes, then the little ones are
helpless. If the head of a family is in trouble, his wife and children are taken from him,
his relations are left destitute, even his friends he may see no more. Prosperity may
crumble in the twink?ling of an eye, like the passing of a spring cloud or the falling of
an autumn leaf. What joy is there in public life? My kinsman Yu-cun has had a
comparatively easy time of it. But take a case nearer home, the Zhen family, like our
own in so many respects. They too were ennobled for their services to the Throne.
Their style of life has always been very like ours. We used to see a great deal of them.
I remember not many years ago when they were here in the capital, they sent one of
their men round to convey their respects, and all seemed well. Yet not long
afterwards their family estate was confiscated, and goodness alone knows what has
become of them now. We have had no news of them for so long. My heart goes out
to them.’
‘What’s this about a pearl?’ asked Jia She. Jia Zheng and Feng Zi-ying gave him a
description of the ‘Mother Pearl’.
‘We need have no fears,’ said Jia She, resuming the pre?vious topic of conversation.
‘Nothing can happen to us.’
‘Of course not, sir,’ said Feng, ‘with Her Grace to pro?tect your interests at Court,
with such enviable connec?tions and such a host of relations, and with a family that
from Lady Jia down to the younger generation has such an impeccable record...’
‘Granted,’ said Jia Zheng somewhat grimly. ‘But our respectability is more than
balanced by our lack of ability and positive achievement. We are living on borrowed
time, and one day it will run out.’
‘Do let’s put an end to this depressing conversation,’ said Jia She, ‘and have another
drink.’
They did so, and after a few more rounds dinner was served. After dinner, tea was
brought in and Feng’s page came in and murmured something in his master’s ear.
Feng took his leave.
‘What was that you said?’ asked Jia She of the page. ‘It’s snowing, sir, and they’ve
sounded the first evening watch.’
Jia Zheng sent a servant out who came back to report that the snow was indeed
already more than an inch thick on the ground.
‘I hope your two curios are well wrapped?’ said Jia Zheng.
‘They are,’ replied Feng. ‘Don’t forget, if you change your minds, I’m sure we can
come to some agreement about the price.’
‘I’ll bear it in mind,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘I shall wait to hear from you then. It’s cold - please don’t bother to see me out.
Goodbye.’
Jia She and Jia Zheng instructed Jia Lian to accompany Feng Zi-ying to the gate.
For the sequel, please read the following chapter.



CHAPTER 93



A Zhen retainer seeks shelter
in the Jia household
And shady activities are revealed
behind the Iron Threshold



When Feng Zi-ying had gone, Jia Zheng sent for one of the men on the gate.
‘I see there’s an invitation here from the Earl of Lin-an,’ he said. ‘Do you know what
sort of an occasion it is?’
‘I did inquire, sir,’ replied the servant. ‘It’s only the arrival of a new company of
actors at the Prince of Nan-an’s. They are said to be first-class, and his lordship wants
to celebrate by putting on a dramatic entertainment for a couple of days. Just an
informal party for friends, noth?ing requiring a presentation I should say, sir.’
As the servant was speaking Jia She came over.
‘Will you be going tomorrow?’ he asked his brother.
‘I really ought to,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘The Earl has always been most affable.’
Another servant came in from the gate and reported to Jia Zheng:
‘There’s a clerk from the Ministry, sir; will you please go in to the office tomorrow.
The President has some important business for you, so could you be there a little
earlier than usual.’
This received a brief acknowledgement. from Jia Zheng. Two family servants came in
next, whose job it was to collect the land rents from the Rong-guo country estates.
They paid their respects, made their kotow and stood humbly to one side.
‘Are you from Hao-family village?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘Yes, sir.’
Jia Zheng did not inquire any further into their busi?ness. He and Jia She talked a
little longer and then both left for their apartments, Jia She accompanied by servants
bearing lanterns.
When they had gone, Jia Lian asked the rent-collectors for their report.
‘We’ve been as fast as we could with the tenth-month rents, sir,’ replied one of
them. ‘They were due to arrive tomorrow, but we ran into trouble a few miles from
town. Our wagons were seized by a patrol and everything was tipped out onto the
ground. They didn’t let us get a word in. I tried to explain that it was rent-produce for
Rong-guo House, not ordinary goods in transit, but they couldn’t have cared less. And
when I told our wagoner to keep on going, some of the highway-patrol beat him up
and impounded two wagons. I’ve come on ahead to report, sir. The only thing now is
for you to send someone to the local yamen and demand our goods back. And you’d
be doing everyone a good turn, if you had those hooligans in the highway-patrol
brought to order. You may not know it, but the regular goods-wagons have an even
worse time with them. They tip out the contents and make off with them, and if the
poor old wagoner dares to open his mouth in protest, he has his brains beaten out.’
‘What a preposterous state of affairs!’ exclaimed Jia Lian. He wrote a note at once
and handed it to one of his men.
‘Take this to the yamen responsible for impounding the wagons. We want our
wagons and all our goods back at once. If we discover the smallest thing missing
there’ll be trouble.’
He sent for Zhou Rui. Zhou was out, so he sent for Brightie instead, only to be
informed that Brightie had gone out at midday and had still not returned.
‘The lazy bastards! They’re never here when they’re wanted! All they do from one
year to the next is slack around at our expense!’
Shouting to his pages to find them both at once, Jia Lian retired to his apartment for
the night.
*

Next morning brought a reminder from the Earl of Lin?an.
‘I shall be busy at the Ministry,’ said Jia Zheng to his brother. ‘And Lian will have to
stay here to sort out this trouble with the rent-wagons. You had better take Bao?yu
with you for the day.’
Jia She nodded.
‘Very well.’
Jia Zheng sent word to Bao-yu that he was to accom?pany his uncle to the Earl of
Lin-an’s theatre party. Bao?-yu was thrilled. He changed, and choosing three of his
pages, Tealeaf, Sweeper and Ploughboy, to go with him, came out to pay his morning
respects to Jia She. They climbed into their carriages and were soon at the Earl’s
palace. A gateman went in to announce their arrival and returned after a brief
interval to escort them in.
Jia She led Bao-yu into the main courtyard, which was packed with a noisy throng.
They paid their respects to the Earl and exchanged civilities with the other guests
be?fore sitting down and joining in the flow of light-hearted conversation. Before
long the manager of the troupe came forward with two playbills, an ordinary one
and a fancy one in the form of an ivory tablet, and saluting his patrons by dropping
one knee to the ground Manchu-style, announced:
‘Will the gentlemen please select their favourite plays?’
Passing along the distinguished company, he came to Jia She, who made his choice.
Then catching sight of Bao-yu, he hurried. straight towards him, saluted him most
elegant?ly and said:
‘Will Master Bao be so good as to choose two from our list?’
Bao-yu studied his face. Those powder-white. cheeks, those lips as red as rouge, that
fresh lustre, like a lotus on the water, that lilting gait, like a jade tree swaying in the
wind - why, it was his old friend Jiang Yu-han! Bao-yu remembered having heard of
his arrival in town with his own troupe. He also remembered wondering why he had
still not seen anything of him. Meeting him now in such formal company,. he felt
unable to rise spontaneously to his feet, and had to content himself with asking:
‘When did you arrive?’
Jiang glanced quickly from left to right, then with a confidential smile whispered:
‘Surely you knew I was here?’
Bao-yu felt too inhibited to continue the conversation, and made his choice of plays
in some confusion.
When Jiang returned backstage, the guests started talk?ing about him.
‘He used to play soubrette parts,’ volunteered one of them. ‘Now that he’s older,
he’s given that up and turned manager. He manages the Prince’s resident troupe.
Before that he’d already started playing young male leads. He made quite a lot of
money, and bought two or three shops. But nothing could keep him from the stage,
so he has turned actor-manager.’
Someone asked:
‘He must surely be married by now?’
‘Not yet,’ came the reply. ‘He has strong views on the subject. "Marriage," says he,
"is a once-and-for-all thing, a lifetime affair, and not to be trifled with." His bride may
be rich or poor, of high or low birth, but the one thing she must possess is talent to
match his. So, he’s remained single to this day.’
‘I wonder who the lucky girl will be,’ thought Bao-yu secretly to himself, ‘to marry
such a fine fellow...’
By now the plays had started. They performed in a vari?ety of styles; the lyrical
kun-qu, the noisier gao-qiang and yi-qiang, and the ‘clapper’ style fr6m Shensi to the
west. It was a splendid show. At midday the tables were set out, and wine and food
were served. After an act or two of the afternoon programme, Jia She showed signs
of wanting to leave. But the Earl came over and pressed him to stay:
‘The day is still young,’ he said, ‘and I understand that Bijou intends to perform a
scene from ‘The Queen of the Flowers’, their piece de resistance.’
When Bao-yu heard this, he secretly prayed for his uncle to stay. Jia She sat down
again.
It was soon time for ‘The Queen of the Flowers’, with Jiang Yu-han playing Master
Qin, the humble oil-vendor. The scene in which he sits up with the drunken
flower-girl Jasper Lute had just the right degree of erotic tenderness, while the
drinking duet was exactly as it should be, amo?roso delidoso. Bao-yu hardly noticed
Jasper Lute. He only had eyes for Master Qin. That ringing vocal timber, that crystal
diction, that subtle tempo were too much for his sensitive soul. He was enraptured.
By the end of the per?formance he knew beyond any shadow of doubt that Jiang
Yu-han was an artist of True Feeling, and not to be com?pared with the common run
of actors. It reminded him of a passage from the chapter ‘On Music’, in the Liber
Ritualis:


‘Feeling stirs within and is ernbodied in sound. When that sound is fashioned by art,
music is born.’


‘No wonder true lovers of music make so much of "Knowing the Sound", entering
into the essence of the music,’ thought Bao-Yu to himself. ‘I must get to the heart of
it. Poetry conveys feeling, but music strikes to the very core. From now on I must
study it in earnest.’
He was awoken from this rapture by Jia She, who had had enough and this time left
before his host had another chance to detain him. Bao-yu had no choice but to follow
in his uncle’s steps.
On their arrival home, Jia She went straight to his own apartment, while Bao-yu went
to report to his father, who had lust returned from the Board and was discussing with
Jia Lian the affair of the impounded rent-wagons.
‘I sent a man with a note today,’ Jia Lian was saying. ‘But the local mandarin was
out. The gateman said that his master knew nothing of the affair and had certainly
never issued a warrant in connection with it. He said it was a piece of flagrant
corruption and extortion on the part of the "scum in the highway-patrol". As this was
Jia family property, he said he would have the culprits found and dealt with, and gave
his personal guarantee that we would have the vehicles and goods back by tomorrow.
If we dis?cover a single thing missing, we are to report to his master and stern
measures will be taken. But at present, as his master was away, he asked us as a
special favour to be dis?creet and not bother him with it.’
‘How can such a thing be done without any kind of warrant?’ said Jia Zheng.
‘You don’t seem to realize, Uncle,’ said Jia Lian, ‘that this sort of thing goes on all
the time. I think we shall probably have our goods back tomorrow all right.’
Business concluded, Jia Lian left the room. Bao-yu now came forward and reported
on his day at the Earl’s. His father asked him a few questions, then sent him on to
Grandmother Jia’s.
Jia Lian had not forgotten yesterday’s unaccounted ab?sence on the part of the two
menservants, and on leaving Jia Zheng he gave orders for a general assembly of the
staff. This time there was a prompt response. After a few preliminary words of
reprimand Jia Lian called forward Lai Da, the chief steward.
‘Fetch the general register for all household departments and call the roll. Then I
want you to write out an announcement. I want everyone to know that if I detect a
single case of absence without leave, or failure to come when sent for, or negligence
in any other respect what?soever, I shall have the culprit immediately flogged and
dismissed.’
  ‘Yes sir!’ replied Lai Da several times. He went out and relayed this to the assembled
servants, who all took due note.
*

Not long afterwards there was an unexpected arrival at the main gate. A man in a felt
hat, blue cotton gown and stur?dy, leather-patched slippers approached and bowed
to the janitors on duty. They eyed him up and down and asked him where he hailed
from.
‘From the Zhen family in the South,’ was his reply. ‘I have with me a letter from my
Master, which I beg you to take in to Sir Zheng.’
When they learned that he was from the Zhen family, the men stood up and made
room for the newcomer to sit down.
‘You must be tired. Here, sit down. We’ll take your letter in for you.’
One of them went in to report his arrival and deliver the letter to Jia Zheng. He
opened it, and this is what he read:
‘My dear Zheng,
Over many generations our two families have estab?lished closeness of friendship
and mutual understanding. We have always looked up to your illustrious house with
the profoundest respect. Although for my heinous crime a thousand deaths would
have been insufficient punishment, thanks td an exceptional act of clemency, I have
been favoured with a mild sentence of banishment to the fron?tier. In the general
dispersion of our family establishment, I have a manservant called Bao Yong, who has
served me well and though lacking any particular skill, is a thorough?ly trustworthy
and dependable fellow. If you could see your way to employing him in some humble
capacity in your household, my gratitude would be unbounded.
I shall write again when I can. With sincere regards,
Your fellow-graduate and friend,
Zhen Ying-jia.’
Jia Zheng smiled wrily as he reached the end of the letter.
‘Here we are overstaffed ourselves,’ he mused aloud to himself, ‘and the Zhens
must send us one of theirs. We shall have to try and find room for him somehow, I
suppose.’
He turned to the gateman.
‘Send this fellow in to see me, and find somewhere for him to stay. There must be
some way in which he can make himself useful.’
The gateman went out, and came back with Bao Yong, who prostrated himself before
Jia Zheng and performed a threefold kotow. Rising to his feet, he declared solemnly:
‘My Master presents his greetings, sir.’
Then falling on one knee, he continued:
‘Bao Yong offers his humble respects, sir.’
Jia Zheng inquired after Zhen Ying-jia, and surveyed Bao Yong. He was something
over five feet tall, broad-shouldered and strongly built, with heavy brows and
prominent eyes, a protruding forehead, a long beard and a rough, dark complexion.
He stood with his arms hanging respectfully at his side.
‘Have you been with the Zhens since birth?’ asked Jia Zheng. ‘Or have you only
served them for a number of years?’
Bao Yong: ‘Since birth, sir.’
Jia Zheng: ‘Why do you wish to leave them now?’
Bao Yong: ‘1t was not my wish at all, sir. But the Mas?ter insisted that I should, and
said that I’d find things here very much the same as with them. That is why I have
come here.’
Jia Zheng: ‘Your master has not deserved the hardship to which he and his family
have been reduced.’
Bao Yong: ‘It is not my place to say such things but I think the Master is far too good a
man, far too honest in his dealings with people. That is what has brought this trouble
on him.’
Jia Zheng: ‘But honesty is a great virtue.’
Bao Yong: ‘Too much of it doesn’t always go down well. Some people are irked by it.’
Jia Zheng (with a smile): ‘If that is the case, I feel con?fident that the Supreme
Providence will see justice done.’
Bao Yong was about to say something when Jia Zheng went on:
‘Am I right in thinking that your master has a son called Bao-yu?’
Bao Yong: ‘That is correct, sir.’
Jia Zheng: ‘Tell me, does he work hard at his studies?’
Bao Yong: ‘That’s a very interesting question sir. There’s quite a story behind it. In a
way our Master Bao-?yu is just like his father, very single-minded, very - how shall I
say - dedicated. His life has until recently been de?dicated to playing with his sisters
and lady cousins. The Master and Her Ladyship have given him quite a few thrashings,
all to no effect. A year or so ago, however, when Her Ladyship was away on a trip to
the capital, our Master Bao fell seriously ill. He had been given up for dead for a long
while in fact, and the Master himself was nearly dead with worry. His funeral clothes
were even laid out in readiness. In the end he recovered, thank goodness. When he
came round, he said that he had been through a great archway, where he met a lady,
who showed him a temple full of cabinets. And in these cabinets were a num?ber of
registers, which he saw. Then he went into a room full of girls, who turned into
ghosts and skeletons. He was scared and cried out, and that was when he woke up.
‘After this experience of his, his father had him treated by a doctor and slowly but
surely he became well. This time he was indulged and allowed to play with his sisters
and cousins to his heart’s content. But who would have thought it - he had
completely changed his ways! None of his old games appealed to him any more. Now
it was all books and studying. And nobody could distract him. He’s even learning to
help the Master with family business.’
Jia Zheng was silent, lost in thought. Then he said:
‘You may go now. When we have need of you we will find you a proper post.’
‘Thank you sir,’ said Bao Yong, and withdrew from the room. He was shown to his
temporary quarters by some of the servants, and there we must leave him.
*

A few days later, Jia Zhehg rose early and was passing through the main gate on his
way to the Board, when he noticed the porters and servants huddled together in
some sort of confabulation. They seemed to be trying to attract his attention, but at
the same time were evidently too afraid to speak out, and could only whisper among
them?selves. He called one of them over and asked:
‘What’s going on? What’s all this muttering in corners about?’
‘We daren’t tell, sir. . .’ replied the servant.
Jia Zheng: ‘Daren’t tell what?’
Servant: ‘Well sir, this morning when I got up to open the gate, I found a sheet of
white paper stuck to it with a lot of rude words written on it...’
Jia Zheng: ‘What’s this? What sort of thing do you mean?’
Servant: ‘Something about sordid goings-on at the Tem?ple of the Iron Threshold, sir.’
Jia Zheng: ‘Show it to me!’
Servant: ‘I tried to peel it off in one piece, sir, but it was stuck on so firmly that I
couldn’t. So I copied the wording down instead and then scrubbed it clean. Li De has
just found another one. He showed it to me, and it says much the same. That’s the
truth, sir.’
He handed Jia Zheng the most recent specimen. Jia Zheng took it and read:

Jia Qin’s a lucky young sod -
He’s in charge of the family nunnery.
All those girls for just one bod -
whoring, gamblng, loads of funnery!
Now that rakes are running the place,
Rong-guo House is a public disgrace!

Jia Zheng was boiling. His head began to swim, his eyes to swirl. Telling the servants
at the gate not to breathe a word of this, he gave secret orders to search every
alley?way in the neighbourhood for any further posters, and sent at once for Jia Lian,
who came hurrying over.
‘Tell me,’ asked Jia Zheng, ‘have you ever personally checked the arrangements
made for the nuns and Taoist novices lodged at the Iron Threshold Temple?’
‘ Not personally, no,’ replied Jia Lian. ‘That has always been young Qin’s
responsibility.’
‘And do you know if he is competent or not?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘It sounds from what you say as though he must have slipped up over some detail,’
said Jia Lian.
‘Take a look at this!’
Jia Lian read the poster and exclaimed:
‘Why, this is an outrage!’
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than Jia Rong came in with a letter
bearing the inscription: ‘For the attention of Sir Jia Zheng - Private and Confidential.’
Jia Zheng opened it and found it to be an anonymous let?ter couched in the same
terms as the posters.
‘Tell Lai Da,’ he instructed them, ‘to take three or four carts at once to the Temple
of the Iron Threshold and bring all the novices back here. This must be kept
abso?lutely secret. He is to say that they are wanted at the Palace.’
Lai Da was given his orders and set off.
*

Now when the twenty-four Buddhist and Tabist novices first arrived at the Temple,
they had been put under the surveillance of the older Sisters, who gave them their
daily lessons and rehearsed them in their liturgies. As the months went by and their
services were not once called upon by the Imperial Concubine, the girls became
slacker and slacker in their studies. They also began to grow up and show a greater
awareness of life. Jia Qin himself was a bit of a young fop, and reckoned that for a
pretty young actress such as Parfumee the decision to enter a nunnery must have
been a childish whim. She became the first object of his advances, over at
Water-moon Priory. To his great surprise he discovered that she was in earnest and
not at all willing to comply with his wishes. So he turned his attentions back to the
Temple, to two of the young novices, a Buddhist nun called Thurible and a little Taoist
nun called Crucible, both extremely attractive and much more cooperative. Many a
pleasant hour they spent with him, playing music and singing songs.
In the middle of the tenth month, Jia Qin arrived as usual with the monthly
allowance. He had no intention of leaving straight away and announced to them all:
‘I have brought you your month’s allowance. I’m afraid I shall be too late to catch
the city-gates tonight and shall have to find somewhere to stay here. On such a chilly
night as this, what could be better than for us to share the wine and the few nuts and
things that I happen to have with me and make a little party of it?’
The girls were thrilled and immediately started putting out the tables. They even
invited the nuns from Water-moon Priory to join them. Parfumee was the only one to
abstain. After a few bowls of wine, Jia Qin suggested a drinking game. Thurible and
her friends replied:
‘None of us can play those games. Why don’t we play guess-fingers instead? Loser
to drink a bowl - that would be great fun!’
‘It’s only just past midday!’ objected one of the Sisters. ‘It will never do to start
rioting about at this hour. I sug?gest we take a little drink or two now and then those
who wish to may leave. Those of you who want to keep Mr Qin company can drink to
your hearts’ content this eve?ning. I shall turn a blind eye.’
Just at that moment, however, one of the lay-sisters came bursting into the room.
‘Quickly everyone! Break it up! Steward Lai’s here, from Rong-guo House!’
The girls rushed around tidying up, and told Jia Qin to hide. He was by now well in his
cups, and bragged:
‘Why should I hide? I’m here to deliver the month’s allowance...’
Lai Da was in at the door before he had finished speak?ing. Signs of the incipient orgy
were all too visible, and Lai Da’s loyal breast filled with rage. He was under the
Master’s instructions to keep the whole operation quiet, however, and inquired with
a nonchalant smile:
‘Would Mr Qin be here by any chance?’
Qin lurched to his feet.
‘Why Mr Lai! What brings you here?’
‘Pleased to find you here, sir,’ said Lai Da. ‘We must get the young ladies ready as
quickly as possible, and take them back to town. They’re wanted at the Palace.’
Jia Qin and the girls wanted to know more, but Lai Da merely said:
‘Come along now. It’s getting late. We must hurry or we shall miss the gates.’
So they all bundled into the carts that were waiting for them, and Lai Da mounted his
sturdy mule and led the convoy into town.
*

We must return to Jia Zheng. Usually so punctilious in his attendance at the Board,
the Master was sitting alone in his study, breathing heavily and brooding over the
anony?mous posters. Jia Lian hovered within earshot, not daring to leave the house.
At last there came the sound of some?one at the gate and a messenger came in to
report:
‘Excellency Zhang is indisposed, and will Sir Zheng please replace him this evening
at the Board?’
Jia Zheng had been expecting Lai Da at any nioment. It was most annoying to be
called away like this. Jia Lian came in.
‘Lai Da didn’t leave until after lunch, Uncle, and the Temple is over eight miles from
town. He won’t be back till eleven o’clock at the earliest. As you are ‘on call’ for this
evening I think you should go. When Lai Da gets back, I shall tell him to keep the nuns
locked up and not to say anything until you have had an opportunity of set?tling the
affair yourself tomorrow. If Qin comes, I shall say nothing. We shall see how he reacts
when you speak to him tomorrow.’
It seemed reasonable enough, and Jia Zheng left with some reluctance for the Board.
As soon as he had gone Jia Lian set off back to his own apartment, brooding as he
went on what he was going to say to Xi-feng. He held her to blame for having given
Qin this job in the first place. But then he remembered that she was ill and relented.
He had better not be too hard on her. He slackened his pace.
*

Meanwhile the news had spread among the servants. It soon reached the ears of
Patience, who immediately went to tell her mistress. Xi-feng had had a bad night
anyway and was feeling very low. Her feeble state intensified her ever-present
anxiety about the various misdeeds that lay on her conscience, in particular her
unscrupulous dealings at Water-moon Priory. When she learnt of the anonymous
poster, she sat up with a jolt and asked Patience:
‘What did it say?’
Patience thoughtlessly replied:
‘Oh, nothing much. Something to do with the nuns at Water-moon Priory...’
This nearly put paid to Xi-feng. Her guilty conscience spelled out for her the rest of
the story. She was undone! A spasm of terror quite deprived her of the power of
speech. She felt the heat surging within her, her eyes began to swim. She started
coughing and collapsed on her bed, her eyes staring rigidly in front of her.
Patience called out in great agitation:
‘I meant the nuns at the Temple of the Iron Threshold! Something to do with the
novices. There’s no cause for you to take on so, ma am.’
The words ‘Iron Threshold’ brought Xi-feng back to her senses.
‘Stupid creature! Which is it, for heaven’s sake? The nuns at the Temple or the
Priory?’
‘At first I thought it was the Priory,’ replied Patience. ‘Then I found out it was the
Temple. That’s why I got it wrong just now.’
‘I thought it must have been the Temple,’ said Xi-feng. ‘The Priory has nothing to do
with me. But I was the one who gave Qin the job of looking after the nuns at the
Temple. He’s probably been making off with some of the money.’
‘No, ma’am,’ said Patience, ‘I don’t think it’s anything to do with money. I heard the
word ‘filth’ mentioned several times.’
‘Well that’s nothing whatever to do with me. Where’s Mr Lian got to?’
‘He’s been in ever since he heard that the Master was in a rage,’ replied Patience.
‘When I heard what sort of an unpleasant affair it was, I told all the servants to keep
quiet about it. I hope their Ladyships haven’t heard. The Master has sent Lai Da to
bring all the girls back from the Temple. I’ll send someone out to see what’s
happened. Now you settle down, ma’am. You’re not well and shouldn’t worry your
head over such things.’
Just at that moment Jia Lian came in. Xi-feng would have liked to ask him for more
details, but thought better of it when she saw the look on his face. He was obviously
in a bad mood and she would be best advised to feign ignorance.
Jia Lian had not finished eating his dinner when Brightie came in.
‘Lai Da’s back, sir.’
‘Is Mr Qin with him?’
‘Yes, sir.’
‘Tell Lai Da the Master has had to go to the Board tonight. He’s to put the girls in
the Garden for the time being, and tomorrow when the Master gets back we’ll see
about sending them to the Palace. Tell Mr Qin to wait for me in the inner library.’
Brightie disappeared.
Jia Qin went as instructed to the library. On his way he noticed a lot of pointing and
muttering among the ser?vants. He could not make out what it was all about, but it
was clearly something to do with him. This was beginning to seem less and less like a
summons from the Palace. He would have dearly liked to ask one of them what was
going on, but felt too uneasy to do so and could only wait there in ever increasing
suspense. When Jia Lian arrived, Jia Qin greeted him and stood nervously with his
hands at his side.
‘I wonder what Her Grace requires the nuns for at such short notice?’ he ventured.
‘I had to race all the way here. Luckily I was out there anyway today with the monthly
allowance and was able to come back with Lai Da. But I’m sure you know all about
that.’
‘All about what! You’re the one that should know!’
Jia Qin could make neither head nor tail of this, and stood there tongue-tied.
‘A fine mess you’ve made of things!’ continued Jia Lian. ‘Sir Zheng’s in a fuming
rage!’
‘But I’ve done nothing!’ protested Jia Qin. ‘I’ve deliv?ered the allowance on time
every month, the girls know their services by heart...’
Jia Lian could see that he knew nothing of what had happened. He and Qin had
played together as children, and he sighed.
‘You ass! Take a look at this!’
He pulled one of the posters from his boot-flap and threw it in Jia Qin’s direction. Jia
Qin picked it up and read it. His face grew ashen pale.
‘Who. could have done this? I’ve never done anyone any harm. Why should anyone
want to blacken my name like this? I only go there once a month with the money -
this is all lies! Sir Zheng will be very hard on me, I know he will! I shall die of shame!
If my mother finds out, she’ll flog me to death!’
He checked that there was no one else in the room and knelt before Jia Lian.
‘Uncle! Please help me! Please!’
He went on knocking his head on the ground, tears streaming down his face. Several
thoughts were going through Jia Lian’s mind.
‘Debauchery is Uncle Zheng’s pet abomination. If he finds out that there really has
been any such thing we’ll be in for a major scene. It will only help smear the family
name, besides. And give the anonymous author the greatest satisfaction, and then
we can expect more of such p6sters in the future. No, why not take advantage of
Uncle Zheng’s absence, talk to Lai Da and hush the whole thing up. So far there’s no
proof that anything ever hap?pened. And no one need be any the wiser.’
Having reached this decision, Jia Lian spoke to Jia Qin again:
‘There’s no point in trying to fool me. Don’t think I don’t know about every one of
your mucky little pranks. Now listen: if you want to get out of this, you must deny
everything, absolutely everything, no matter how hard Sir Zheng presses you. Do you
understand? Now get up off the ground, you pathetic creature!’
Jia Lian sent for Lai Da and asked him for his opinion.
‘As a matter of fact, sir,’ said Lai Da, ‘Mr Qin was be?having in a very unbecoming
manner. When I arrived at the Temple they were all drinking. I’d say the man who
wrote the posters was telling the truth.. .’
‘Do you hear that, Qin?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Is Lai Da maligning you too?’
Jia Qin was by now puce in the face and speechless with embarrassment. Jia Lian
took Lai Da by the hand and pleaded with him:
‘Spare the lad, Lai. Say you found him at home. When you take him in to see the
Master, there’s no need to say that I’ve already seen him. And tomorrow you can ask
the Master not to bother with questioning the nuns. Send for a broker and have
them all sold off. If Her Grace should really need them again, we can always buy
some more.’
Lai Da reflected that there was nothing to be gained by letting the incident blow into
a storm. The family’s name would only suffer. So he agreed to Jia Lian’s proposal.
‘You go with Mr Lai now, Qin,’ ordered Jia Lian. ‘And do whatever he tells you.’
Jia Qin kotowed once more to Jia Lian and followed Lai Da out. When they reached a
secluded spot, he also kotowed to Lai Da.
‘Excuse me for saying so, Master Qin,’ said Lai, ‘but it was your fault for behaving in
such a manner. I don’t know who it is that you offended. Can you think who it could
be?’
Jia Qin thought for a while, but could think of no par?ticular enemies. He followed Lai
Da listlessly out.
To learn how he extricated himself, you must read the next chapter.



CHAPTER 94



Grandmother Jia gives a crab-blossom party:
a celebration of the ominous
Bao-yu loses his Magic Jade: a strange disappearance
of the numinous

Lai Da led Jia Qin off, to await the Master’s return in the morning.
The little novices were thrilled to be back in the Garden and were eager to. revisit
their favourite haunts, imagining that the next day would be taken up with
preparations for their visit to the Palace. Imagine their dismay when they found
themselves prisoners: Lai Da’s instructions to the old women and pages on duty were
to feed them in their rooms and keep them in close confinement. The girls. had no
idea why they were being treated in this way and spent the night sitting up in
suspense. Although the maids in the Garden’s various residences knew by now of
their arrival, they had only been given the official story and knew nothing of the real
facts of the case.
Early next day Jia Zheng, having completed his night duty, was about to leave the
Board when another urgent file was passed down to him: the City Wall Repairs
Esti?mates and Accounts for two of the Provincial Capitals, for Immediate Audit. He
foresaw a considerable delay, and sent a message home to Jia Lian, authorizing him
to go ahead and question Lai Da when he returned from the Temple, and to deal with
the case as he saw fit.
Jia Lian received these instructions with relief, mainly on young Qin’s behalf, as he
would now be spared the Master’s wrath. On further reflection, however, it
occur?red to him that he might attract Jia Zheng’s suspicion if he were to brush the
entire affair under the carpet. It would be wiser to consult Lady Wang. Then if he
incurred the Master’s displeasure, at least he would not be solely responsible.
Having decided on this course of action, Jia Lian :went to see Lady Wang and told her
what had happened, con?cluding:
‘Uncle Zheng was extremely angry about the anony?mous poster and gave orders
for Lai Da to bring young Qin and all the girls here for questioning. Today Uncle is too
busy to deal with this sordid matter himself, and has asked me to consult you about it.
What do you think we should do, Aunt?’
‘I never heard of such a disgraceful business!’ exclaimed Lady Wang in horror. ‘If
young Qin really has behaved in this degrading fashion, the family should have
nothing more to do with him. Mind you, it’s a despicable way to carry on, to go
putting posters up about people... Do you suppose there is any truth in it? Have you
asked Qin about it yet? What has he to say for himself?’
‘I’ve questioned him,’ replied Lian. ‘Only a few mo?ments ago, as a matter of fact.
Of course he denied the whole thing. But consider, Aunt; supposing he really had
done it, do you think he would admit to it? Personally I don’t think he did. He knows
that the girls are liable to be called to Court at short notice, and would be too scared
of a scandal. We could find out the truth easily enough. But what then? What do you
suggest?’
‘Where are the girls now?’ asked Lady Wang.
‘They are locked up in the Garden,’ replied Jia Lian.
‘Do the others know that they are there?’
‘They probably all know by now. But so far as they are concerned the girls are on
their way to the Palace. That is what everyone has been told.’
‘Good,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We must get rid of these crea?tures immediately, once
and for all. I never wanted to keep them on in the first place it was all your idea and
Xi-feng’s. Didn’t I say it would end in trouble? You’d better tell Lai Da to go through
them one by one and find out if they’ve any relatives left at home. Find their
con?tracts and authorize whatever money is necessary to hire a boat for them -
twenty or thirty taels should be enough. Put someone dependable in charge and
have them all taken home to wherever they came from in the first place. They can
take their contracts with them, and that will be the end of that. Even if one or two of
them have been up to some mischief, I don’t think it would be fair to punish them
in?discriminately, by making them all return to lay-life. And if we hand them over to
the official broker who usually finds husbands for orphan girls, even though we don’t
want the body price, someone is sure to try and make money out of them, and no
one will think of their wel?fare. Who knows what might happen to them? As for Qin,
I want you to tell him in no uncertain manner exact?ly what we think of him. He is
never to come here again except for a clan sacrifice or some other big celebration. He
had better keep well out of Sir Zheng’s way too, unless he wants a taste of real
trouble. And don’t forget to tell the accounts people to cancel the relevant entry.
‘Send someone to the Temple,’ concluded Lady Wang, ‘with strict instructions from
Sir Zheng that none of the male members of the clan is to be allowed in there, except
for the specific purpose of burning paper-money at the grave-site. And if there is any
more nonsense, we will have all the Sisters removed too.’
Jia Lian took this all in and went to give Lai Da his orders.
‘That is what Her Ladyship says you are to do,’ he said. ‘Report to me when you’ve
finished, and I shall report back to Her Ladyship. Look smart. When Sir Zheng comes
in, all you need do is repeat Her Ladyship’s instructions.’
‘It’s very charitable of Her Ladyship to deal so gener?ously with these worthless
people,’ commented Lai Da. ‘I’ll make sure I pick a good ‘un to take them all home,
carrying on Her Ladyship’s good work, so to speak. And I’ll bring young Master Qin in
here, sir, for you to deal with. As for that anonymous bill-sticker, I’ll track him down,
and when I lay my hands on him I’ll teach him a lesson he won’t forget in a hurry.’
Jia Lian nodded.
‘Good.’
Jia Qin was summoned and disposed of, and Lai Da dealt with the girls in accordance
with Lady Wang’s in?structions.
When Jia Zheng came home that evening, Jia Lian and Lai Da both went in to report.
Jia Zheng was not a man to look for unnecessary trouble, and was content to
consider the matter closed. The news that the Jia household had dismissed
twenty-four girl novices soon spread, and every young rake in town fancied the idea
of getting hold of one of them for himself. What did happen to the girls in the end,
and whether or not they ever reached home, our story does not relate, and it would
be idle to speculate.
*

Let us return instead to the Naiad’s House. With the slight improvement in Dai-yu’s
health, Nightingale was less busy than usual. Hearing of the arrival of the novices,
and curious about the event that called for their presence at Court, she decided to
pay a visit to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, in the hope of finding out more from one
of the maids there. She arrived just as Faithful was coming off duty and the two of
them were able to sit down for a chat. Nightingale mentioned the novices. Their
presence in the Garden came as a complete surprise to Faithful who exclaimed:
‘That’s the first I’ve heard of it! I’ll ask Mrs Lian about it later on, she’ll be sure to
know.’
At that moment two old women from Mr Fu Shi’s establishment came to call on
Grandmother Jia, and Faith?ful went to take them through. Grandmother Jia had just
retired for her midday nap, however, so the women ex?changed a few words with
Faithful and went on their way again.
‘Where are those two from?’ asked Nightingale.
‘They’re a tiresome pair,’ replied Faithful. ‘They’re always calling on Her Old
Ladyship and telling her how wonderful their Miss Fu is - so sweet-natured, beautiful,
well-mannered, softly spoken, a perfect needlewoman, deft with her writing-brush,
nimble with her abacus, a para?gon of daughterly obedience, kind and ladylike
towards the servants, and so on and so forth... Every time they come they treat Her
Old Ladyship to the same recital. I can’t bear that sort of thing, but Her Old Ladyship
seems to love it. And the strange thing is that Bao-yu, who normal?ly finds old
women like that most irritating, makes an ex?ception of these two. A few days ago,
when they were here last, they said that Mr Fu wouldn’t look at any of his sis?ter’s
suitors (and there are plenty of them), but had set his heart on her marrying into a
family like ours. They sung her praises all over again. Somehow they always seem to
say just the thing to please the old lady.’
Nightingale looked thoughtful for a moment. Then she asked with affected
nonchalance:
‘If Her Old Ladyship is so pleased with what they say, why doesn’t she marry Bao-yu
to the young lady?’
Faithful was on the very point of explaining to Night?ingale the real reason, when she
heard a call from inside:
‘Her Old Ladyship is awake!’
She hurried in, leaving Nightingale to make her own way home.
As Nightingale reached the Garden and began to walk towards the Naiad’s House,
she thought to herself:
‘Anyone would suppose Bao-yu to be the only boy in the world, from the amount
of time we all spend thinking about him! My poor mistress lust seems to get more
and more besotted with him. Whenever I see her sinking into one of her depressions,
I can tell it’s because of him. That’s what has been making her fall ill all the time too.
What with all the uncertainty about the bond of gold and jade, and now this Miss Fu
- I don’t know! I always thought Bao-yu loved Miss Lin, but from what Faithful said it
seems he just flits from one girl to the next. My poor mistress! All your heartache is
wasted on him!’
Nightingale had begun by feeling sad on Dai-yu’s account, but the more she thought
about it the more wretched and confused she began to feel herself. She would have
liked to advise Dai-yu not to wear her heart out in such a futile affair, but was too
afraid of incurring her displeasure. And yet how could she just stand by and watch
her suffer?
Presently, as she turned the problem over and over in her mind, her compassion gave
way to a sudden feeling of annoyance and she chided herself:
‘Why should I worry about them anyway? Supposing Miss Lin does marry Bao-yu -
she’ll still be as difficult to please as ever. And Bao-yu may be friendly enough, but I
know how fickle he is too. I tell others not to wear their hearts out in vain, and then
do so myself! N9, from now on I shall concentrate on doing my duty and not allow
myself to get involved.’
In this new spirit of detachment she continued on her way to the Naiad’s House, and
arrived to find Dai-yu sit?ting alone on the kang, going over some of her old poems
and other writings. As she entered the room Dai-yu looked up and asked:
‘Where have you been?’
‘Oh, I just went out for a chat with one of the other maids,’ replied Nightingale.
‘Was it Aroma?’
‘What should I want to see her for?’
The off-hand manner of her reply came as a shock to Dai-yu, who felt most put out
and said curtly:
‘Do as you please, it’s all the same to me. Bring me a cup of tea.’
Nightingale smiled inwardly at the outcome of her ex?periment and went to pour the
tea. As she did so she heard a confused hubbub in the Garden, but could not tell
what was going on. She began pouring the tea and sent a junior maid out to
investigate the disturbance. The maid returned in a short while to report:
‘It’s the crab-trees at Green Delights. Earlier this year some of them were struck
with the blight, and no one bothered to water them. Yesterday Bao-yu went to have
a look at them and thought he could see buds on some of the branches. No one
believed him or paid any attention to his story at the time. But today there’s ho
doubt about it, they’ve come out in the most beautiful blossom! It has caused quite a
stir and everyone is hurrying over there to have a look. Even Her Old Ladyship and
Her Ladyship have been caught up in the excitement and are going along to see the
blossom. So Mrs Zhu has given orders for all the paths to be cleared of leaves - that’s
what all the shout?ing was about.’
Dai-yu heard that Grandmother Jia was coming, she got up to change and sent
Snowgoose on ahead, telling her to report back the moment Her Old Ladyship
arrived. She soon came running back.
‘Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship and a lot of the other ladies have all arrived!
Hurry, Miss!’
Dai-yu took a brief look in the mirror, passed a comb quickly through her hair and set
off with Nightingale in the direction of Green Delights. She arrived to find
Grandmother Jia installed on Bao-yu’s day-couch, and after greeting her and Lady
Xing and Lady Wang went on to say hello to Li Wan, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Xing
Xiu?yan. She noticed that several people were absent: Xi-feng was ill in bed, Shi
Xiang-yun had gone home to see her uncle who was in the capital on transfer, while
Bao-qin had stayed at home with Bao-chai, and the two Li sisters, Wen and Qi, had
been taken to live elsewhere by their mother, whom recent events had convinced
that Prospect Garden was a rather unsuitable environment for her daughters.
They were all chatting away, each propounding a differ?ent interpretation of the
strange phenomenon of the winter-flowering crab-trees.
‘They usually flower in the third month, I know,’ Grandmother Jia was saying. ‘And
we are in the eleventh month now. But then the movable terms in the calendar are
rather late this year, so we could say this is more like the tenth month, which is after
all sometimes called "Lit?tle Spring". With the exceptionally warm weather we have
been having, a little blossom is only to be expected.’
‘You are quite right, Mother,’ agreed Lady Wang. ‘We need someone of your
experience to show us that this is really nothing out of the ordinary.’
Lady Xing however was not so easily convinced.
‘I heard that these trees had already been struck by the blight for almost a year...
How do you explain the fact that half-dead trees should start flowering now, at such
an odd time of the year?’
Li Wan spoke next.
‘I think you are both right,’ she said with a smile. ‘My own humble suggestion is
that they have flowered special?ly to tell us of some happy event that is about to
take place in Bao-yu’s life.’
Tan-chun, although she remained silent, was secretly thinking to herself:
‘This must be an ill-omen. Everything that is in har?mony with nature prospers, and
things out of season, out of time, fade and die. Plants and trees obey a natural cycle.
If a tree flowers out of season, it must be an ill ?omen.’
She kept all this to herself, however. It was Dai-yu who spoke next. She had been
struck by Li Wan’s mention of a happy event, and said with some excitement:
‘There was once a family of farmers who had a thorn-bush. There were three sons
in the family, and one day these three sons decided to leave home and go their
sepa?rate ways. No sooner had they gone than the thornbush began to fade away
and die. But some time later the brothers began to yearn for each other’s company,
re?turned home and were reunited. And at once the thorn?bush began to flourish
again. So you see plants follow closely the fortunes of the people to whom they are
attached. Now Cousin Bao is devoting himself seriously to his studies, which pleases
Uncle Zheng, which pleases the crab-trees, which is why they are flowering!’
This went down very well with Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang.
‘What a well-chosen story! Such an interesting idea!’
Jia She and Jia Zheng now arrived to view the flowers, accompanied by Jia Huan and
Jia Lan. Jia She spoke first.
‘Cut them down. That’s what I say. There’s evil work afoot here.’
‘On the contrary,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Leave them alone. Evil manifestations thrive on
such superstition. Ignore them and they disappear.’
‘What’s all this?’ interrupted Grandmother Jia testily. ‘We’re all gathered here to
witness a happy event. Why do you have to start talking about manifestations and
what-have-you? When there’s good luck then enjoy it while you can. I’ll take care of
any bad luck. I forbid you to utter another word of such gloomy nonsense.’
This silenced Jia Zheng, and he and Jia She effected an awkward departure.
Grandmother Jia was unperturbed and determined to enjoy herself.
‘Send someone to the kitchen,’ she said. ‘We want wine and some nice things to
eat. We’ll have a little party. I should like you, Bao-yu, Huan and Lan, each to write a
poem to celebrate the occasion. Miss Lin has been unwell so she can be excused. If
she feels up to it she can help you boys polish yours.’
Turning to Li Wan she continued:
‘You and the others come up and have some wine with me.’
‘Yes Grannie,’ said Li Wan, then turning to Tan-chun she laughed and said:
‘This is all your fault, Tan!’
‘What do you mean?’ protested Tan-chun. ‘We’ve been let off the poetry-writing -
my fault for what?’
‘Aren’t you the founder of the Crab-flower Club?’ rep?lied Li Wan. ‘I know that crab
was an Autumn Crab -ut can’t you see? Now the real crab-blossom wants to join in
too...’
Everyone laughed at the idea.
Food and wine were now served, and they all drank and did their best to humour the
old lady with light-hearted conversation. Bao-yu came up to pour himself some wine,
and standing there thought up a quatrain which he then wrote out and recited for his
grandmother.

I asked the crab-tree why at blossom-time it failed,
Yet now profusely bloomed so long before the spring?
The tree replied: ‘Midwinter marks the birth of light.
Glad tidings to the Mistress of this House I bring.’

It was Huan’s turn next. He wrote his out and began to recite:

Plants should put out buds in spring:
Our crab tree’s timing’s topsy-turvy.
Of all the wonders of the world
Ours is the only winter-flowering tree.

Then Jia Lan made a careful copy of his poem, in im?maculate kai-shu calligraphy,
and presented it to his great-grandmother, who asked Li Wan to read it out for her.

Your mist-congealed beauty blighted in the spring,
Your frosted petals blush now in the snow.
Hail Tree of Wisdom! Whose Rebirth
Adds lustre to our Family Hearth.

When she reached the end, Grandmother Jia com?mented:
‘I don’t know much about poetry, but I should judge Lan’s good, while I should say
that Huan’s was poor. Come on now, everybody come and have something to eat.’
Bao-yu was affected by her jolly mood. But then he thought to himself:
‘Last year when the crab-trees died was the year Sky-bright died. Now the
crab-trees have come back to life. That’s all very well for us; but Skybright can never
live again...’
This thought threw him into a sudden depression; then he remembered what
Qiao-jie had recently said, that Xi?feng might be sending him pretty Fivey. Perhaps it
was her imminent arrival that the strange blossoming por?tended? This prospect
dispelled his gloom and he became his smiling self once more.
Grandmother Jia stayed a while longer, then returned to her apartment, leaning on
Pearland escorted by Lady Wang and the others. As she was leaving, Patience came
hurrying up, her face wreathed in smiles:
‘Mrs Lian heard that you were here viewing the flow?ers,’ she said, ‘and though she
couldn’t come herself, she asked me to come and attend to Your Ladyships and to
bring this parcel. It contains two rolls of red silk for Mas?ter Bao to decorate the trees
with, and comes with Mrs Lian’s congratulations on the happy event.’
Aroma came forward to receive the parcel and presented it to Grandmother Jia, who
beamed with delight.
‘Trust Fengie to think of the right thing! What a nice idea! So distinguished!’
Aroma gave Patience a smile.
‘Please thank Mrs Lian for Master Bao when you go back, will you?’ she said. ‘The
happy event she is referring to is one that will make all of us happy, I’m sure…’
When Aroma said this, it dawned on Grandmother Jia that Xi-feng was thinking of
Bao-yu’s marriage, and her face lit up.
‘Aiyo!’ she exclaimed. ‘Of course! It never occurred to me! Fengie may be laid up in
bed, but she’s still the cleverest of us all. What a perfect thing to send!’
As she said this, she was already walking away from Green Delights, followed by her
entourage. Patience whispered to Aroma:
‘Actually Mrs Lian says this flowering is an ill-omen, and you’re to cut strips of this
red silk and hang them on the trees; that will help turn the bad luck into good. And in
future you’re to avoid any superstitious chat about it.’
Aroma nodded and saw Patience out.
*

Earlier that day, Bao-yu had been lounging around in?doors, casually dressed in a
fur-lined gown with slits at the sides. When he caught sight of the flowering
crab-trees through the window, he went out to look at them. The more he gazed at
the blossom the more lovely and poig?nant it seemed, the more strangely it seemed
to reflect the mysterious vagaries of destiny, the joy and pathos of life. It was the
embodiment of his own thoughts and feelings. Then, when he heard that
Grandmother Jia was coming over, he hurried in to change into more formal attire,
choosing a pale fox-lined robe with cut-away archer’s sleeves and a darker jacket,
also fox-lined, to go with it. He emerged again properly dressed to receive his
grand?mother, and in his hurry quite forgot to put on his Magic Jade.
When Grandmother Jia left he went on again to change back into his comfortable
clothes, and it was then that Aroma detected the absence of the jade and asked him
where it was.
‘I was in such a rush when I came in to change,’ he re?plied. ‘I took it off and left it
on the kang-table. Then I forgot to put it on again.’
Aroma looked but it was not on the table. She searched everywhere but could see no
sign of it. She began to feel frightened, and broke into a cold sweat.
  ‘Please don’t worry,’ Bao-yu begged her. ‘It must be somewhere in the room. It’s
bound to turn up. Ask the others - they might know.’
It occurred to Aroma that Musk or one of the other maids might have hidden it
somewhere as a practical joke and she bore down on them with an expression of
playful accusation:
‘You mean lot! Can’t you think of a better way of amusing yourselves? Come on,
where have you hidden it? Don’t take this too far! If it really did get lost we’d be in
real trouble, all of us!’
But Musk replied with a straight face:
‘What on earth do you mean? We’d know better than to play a trick like that. We’re
not that silly. You’re the one who should stop and think a minute. Try to remember
where you put it, instead of laying the blame on us!’
Aroma could tell that Musk was in earnest and cried out in alarm:
‘Heaven save us then! Oh little ancestor, where can you have put it? You must try to
remember!’
‘I do,’ replied Bao-yu, ‘I remember quite clearly putting it on the kang-table. Have
another look for it.’
The maids were too scared to tell anyone else, and joined together in a furtive search.
This went on for most of the day but there was still no sign of the jade. They emptied
every box, and rummaged in every trunk, until there simply was nowhere left to look
and they began to wonder if perhaps one of the visitors might have picked it up
earlier in the day.
‘How would anyone dare do such a thing?’ said Aroma. ‘Everyone knows how
important it is, and that Master Bao’s very life hinges on it. Ask about it, but be very
dis?creet. If you find out that one of the maids has taken it and is playing a trick on us,
kotow to her and beg for it back. If it’s a junior maid who’s stolen it, don’t tell a soul,
just do whatever is necessary to get it back. Give her whatever you like in exchange.
This is very serious. It would be terrible if we lost the jade, worse even than losing
Master Bao himself!’
Musk and Ripple set off on this mission. Aroma hurried out after them with a few
final words of instruction:
‘On second thoughts, leave the people who were here at lunch-time till last. If it
turns out to be someone else, we don’t want to offend them and cause a lot of
ill-feeling to no purpose.’
The two maids split up to make their inquiries, but everywhere they went it was the
same story. Nobody knew anything about it. Everybody was equally taken aback by
the news. They hurried back to report their lack of success, and stared at one
another in despondent sil?ence. Bao-yu himself was now beginning to look rather
stunned, and Aroma was so desperate that she could only weep helplessly. What
could they do? There was nowhere left to look. They were too scared to tell any of
the elder members of the family. The entire establishment at Green Delights was
immobilized with fear and resembled a group of wooden statues or clay dolls.
One by one the others who had heard the news began to arrive, among them
Tan-chun, who immediately gave orders for the Garden gate to be shut and sent an
old serv?ing-woman and two maids on another comprehensive search, announcing
to everyone present. that there would be a substantial reward for the recovery of the
jade. They were all keen to establish their own innocence, and this, with the added
incentive of winning the reward, now led to a flurry of indiscriminate searching. Every
nook and cranny of the Garden was explored, not excluding the lavatories, but to no
avail. It was as hopeless as hunting for an embroidery needle, and as evening drew
on there was still no trace of the missing jade. Li Wan now sensed the urgency of the
situation and said:
‘I have a suggestion to make. It’s not the sort of thing I would usually like to suggest
but in the present circum?stances I feel I must...’
They all gave her their attention.
‘Things are so desperate that I think we have to try any?thing. Now apart from
Bao-yu, all the residents of the Garden are girls. I should like you all to ask your maids
to remove their dresses, so that we can search everyone properly. If that produces no
results, then we should send them to search the older serving-women and cleaners.
Do you all agree?’
The consensus of opinion was that she was right. With so many people involved, and
such confusion, this seemed the only way of establishing anyone’s innocence.
Tan-chun was the only one to abstain from making any comment.
The maids were eager. to clear themselves, and Patience was the first to volunteer.
One by one they all undid their dresses and filed past, while Li Wan supervised the
exam?ination. Tan-chun could contain herself no longer.
‘My dear Wan, can’t you see what a futile waste of time this all is? Supposing
someone has stolen it; do you really think he or she would be foolish enough to carry
it around? Anyway, why should anyone want to steal it? It means a lot to us, but
outside this household it’s quite valueless. If you ask me, someone’s doing this out of
spite.’
They all knew immediately whom she was referring to. Jia Huan had been in and out
of Green Delights many times that day. No one was prepared to mention his name,
however, and she was obliged to be more specific herself:
‘It must be Huan. Who else would play such a nasty trick? Send someone secretly
oVer to his room and bring him here. Get him on his own and talk him into
produc?ing the jade, then threaten to expose him unless he keeps his mouth shut,
and there’s our mystery solved.’
Amid much nodding of heads, Li Wan turned to Patience and said:
‘ You’d better go. This will require all your tact.’
‘ Yes ma’am,’ replied Patience, and hurried off.
A few minutes later, when she returned with Jia Huan, the others pretended hardly
to notice his arrival. One of them made him a pot of tea and placed it on a table in
the inner rom. Then they all shuffled out and left the scene clear for Patience.
She gave him an ingenuous smile.
‘Master Bao’s jade has gone missing.. .1 don’t suppose you’ve seen it anywhere
have you?’
Jia Huan’s face instantly flushed to an ugly shade of purple. He glowered at her.
‘Just because somebody’s lost something, does that mean that I automatically
become the suspect and get call?ed in for interrogation? Have I got a criminal record
or something?’
Patience decided to change tack, and said with a smile:
‘Of course no one would dream of suggesting you stole it! They just thought that
perhaps you might have hidden it somewhere as a practical joke, and that by asking
you if you’d seen it I might be able to get a few clues as to where they should look for
it.’
‘It’s his jade, isn’t it?’ replied Jia Huan indignantly. ‘He’s the one that wears the
thing - ask him, not me! You’re all so keen to please him, that’s your trouble! If
something’s found I never get to hear of it! But the moment anything’s lost, it’s me
that gets the blame!’
He got up and stomped out of the room. The maids stepped back to let him through.
All this only served to exasperate Bao-yu.
‘The amount of trouble that wretched thing has caused!’ he said. ‘I’ve no desire for
it and I wish you would all forget about it. Now look what we’ve done. Huan will go
and tell everybody and we’ll never hear the end of it.’
‘Little ancestor, please. ..’ came tearfully from where Aroma stood in the throng of
distraught maids. ‘It’s all very well for you to say "forget about it"! But what you
seem to have forgotten is that if their Ladyships get to hear, the likes of us will be
torn to shreds and ground to powder!’
This was followed by prolonged wailing. It soon became clear to them all that things
could not be hushed up for much longer. They would have to agree on a story to tell
Grandmother Jia and the other ladies.
‘That’s easy,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just tell them I smashed it myself.’
‘No no! That’s no good!’ said Patience. ‘Can’t you see? They’ll want to know why
you smashed it, and then things will look just as black for Aroma and the others. And
besides, what if they want to see the pieces?’
‘Well then, say I lost it on a trip to town.’
There was a moment’s silence as they all pondered this suggestion.
‘We might possibly have got away with that,’ said someone at last. ‘But during the
past few days you haven’t been to school, and you haven’t been out anywhere
either.’
‘Yes I have,’ Bao-yu corrected them. ‘A few days ago I went to the Earl of Lin-an’s to
watch the plays. You can say I lost it then.’
‘No, that won’t do,’ said Tan-chun. ‘If you lost it as long ago as that, they’ll want to
know why it hasn’t been reported till now.’
They were still busy discussing the relative merits of these various fictions when
suddenly they heard the voice of Aunt Zhao, cursing and wailing her way towards
them.
‘If you lose something, why can’t you look for it yourselves, instead of sneaking up
and blaming my boy? Well, here he is! Take him! Sacrifice him if you think it will do
you any good! Kill him! Hack him to pieces! Do what you like with him!’
She propelled Jia Huan into the room, crying:
‘Thief! Hurry up and confess your crime!’
This brought loud and angry protestations from Huan. Li Wan was just bracing herself
to intervene and make the peace when a maid came rushing in and announced:
‘Her Ladyship is here!’
Aroma and the maids could see that a confrontation was now inevitable. Bao-yu and
the girls went out at once to receive Lady Wang. Aunt Zhao’s wrath subsided for a
moment and she followed them out. From the startled look on their faces Lady Wang
could see that what she had heard must be true.
‘Is it really lost?’ she cried.
No one dared reply. Lady Wang walked in, sat down and called Aroma forward.
Aroma fell trembling to her knees. In a choked voice she murmured ‘Yes.’
‘Well, get up!’ said Lady Wang. ‘We must have a thorough search made. Come on,
this helpless attitude will never do.’
Aroma was sobbing and could not say a word. Bao-yu finally spoke up, fearful that
she might blurt out the truth.
‘Mother, this has nothing to do with Aroma. I lost it the other day on my way back
from seeing the plays at the Earl of Lin-an’s.’
‘Then why didn’t you look for it at the time?’
‘I didn’t want anyone to know. I just told Tealeaf to look for it everywhere along the
street.’
‘Nonsense! You know perfectly well that Aroma or one of your other maids would
have noticed. That’s their job. They are always with you when you change. Whenever
you come in from a party or any kind of excursion, if one of your handkerchiefs is
missing, or a little purse, they’re bound to ask you where it’s gone do you really
think that they would allow something as irreplaceable as your jade to disappear, and
not say a word?’
Bao-yu was stumped for an answer. Aunt Zhao, who was gloating over his
discomfiture, hastened to put in:
‘If you’re so sure you lost it outside, why try to pin the blame on Huan?’
‘That’s enough from you!’ said Lady Wang sharply. ‘You keep out of this!’
Aunt Zhao was reduced to silence. It was left to Li Wan and Tan-chun to give the true
story, which brought tears to Lady Wang’s eyes. In her agitation she was for telling
Grandmother Jia and going over to Lady Xing’s apart?ment to question the members
of her household who had been to Green Delights earlier in the day.
The news had meanwhile reached Xi-feng on her sick?bed. When she heard that Lady
Wang had arrived at Green Delights she felt obliged to put in an appearance and,
leaning on Felicity’s arm, made her way towards the Garden. She arrived just as Lady
Wang was about to leave.
‘Good evening, Aunt.’
Xi-feng’s voice trembled slightly as she spoke. Bao-yu and the others came up to
greet her.
‘So you’ve heard the news too!’ said Lady Wang to Xi?feng. ‘Most extraordinary! It
vanished just like that, and can’t be found anywhere. Think for a moment: of all the
maids, including all of Lady Jia’s and even your own Patience, which would you say
showed thieving tenden?cies, or had a malicious disposition? I intend to tell Lady Jia,
and to order a thorough search. Until we find it, Bao?yu’s life hangs in the balance!’
‘Ours is such a large household,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and, as the saying goes, you can
know a man’s face, but never his heart. With all the commotion of a search,
everyone is bound to hear, and the thief will be so scared of the con?sequences that
rather than be caught, he could well panic and destroy the evidence - the jade itself -
and then where would we be? No, my advice, for what it is worth, is that we should
let it be known that Bao-yu threw it away in disgust and that it really doesn’t matter.
Everyone must be very discreet so as to keep Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng from
knowing. Meanwhile we can search every?where in secret, and if we’re clever we
should end up with both the jade and the thief. Does that make sense to you, Aunt?’
After a long pause Lady Wang replied:
‘It’s all very well, but will we ever succeed in keeping this from Sir Zheng?’
She called Jia Huan to her.
‘It was very silly of you to go shouting your head off about Bao-yu’s jade, just
because they asked you about it. If the thief has heard and destroys the jade, you will
pay for it with your life!’
‘I promise never to mention it again!’ wailed Jia Huan in terror. This time Aunt Zhao
held her tongue.
‘There must be some places left where you haven’t looked,’ Lady Wang continued,
addressing the assem?bled maids. ‘It must be somewhere here. It’s hardly going to
fly away, is it? But when you look, be as quiet as possi?ble. Aroma, I give you three
days to find it. If we still haven’t found it by then, we shan’t be able to keep it from
Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng any longer. And everyone knows what that will
mean!’
Bidding Xi-feng accompany her, Lady Wang set off for Lady Xing’s apartment, for
further consultations on how to apprehend the thief.
Li Wan and the others continued to debate what to do. They sent for the various
domestics in charge of the Gar?den and gave orders for the gates to be securely
locked. Steward Lin’s wife was also summoned and given confiden?tial instructions.
‘Tell the servants on both gates that absolutely no one is to be allowed out of the
Garden for the next three days. We can allow freedom of movement within the
Garden, but no one must leave. Say that something has been lost and that no one
can go out until it’s found.’
‘Yes, Mrs Zhu,’ said Lin’s wife. ‘Excuse me, ma’am,’ she went on, ‘but we lost
something at home the other day - nothing of any value of course, but my husband
was determined to find it, and he went and consulted one of those word-diviners
that set themselves up at street cor?ners. Iron Mouth Liu I think this one’s name was.
His reading was very clear. My husband followed his instruc?tions, and found the
missing item straight away.’
When Aroma heard this she begged her to help them.
 ‘Oh, Mrs Lin! Please go and ask your husband to con?sult this man for us!’
‘Indeed I will. Straight away.
Lin’s wife bustled off. Xing Xiu-yan now had a sugges?tion to make.
‘If you ask me, those word-diviners and fortune-tellers you find on street corners
are all charlatans. But when I knew Adamantina, in the South, before she came to
live here, I heard of her gift for the planchette. Why don’t we ask her to hold a
séance for us? Didn’t .Bao-yu’s jade have a mysterious origin anyway? It would surely
lend itself to that sort of approach.’
The others seemed greatly surprised to hear this, and re?flected that in all the time
they had known her, Adamant?ma had never once mentioned such a gift. Musk
earnestly beseeched Xiu-yan:
‘Oh, Miss! I don’t think she would agree to do it for anyone but you! Please, please,
will you ask her for us? I’ll kotow to you - if she finds the answer, I’ll be indebted to
you for a lifetime!’
She was about to perform a kotow, but Xiu-yan raised her from the ground. Dai-yu
and the others added their entreaties to Musk’s, and Xiu-yan left with all speed for
Green Bower Hermitage.
No sooner had she gone, than Steward Lin’s wife returned from her mission.
‘Ladies!’ she announced with great jubilation. ‘I bring good news! My husband has
been to see the man~ and he says the jade is sure to turn up. Someone will definitely
bring it back.’
She had yet to convince her audience however - except for Aroma and Musk, who
were ready to grasp at the slightest hope. Tan-chun asked:
‘What word came up, and what was the reading?’
‘He said a lot,’ replied Lin’s wife, ‘and some of it I couldn’t understand. But I know
the word was shang (1) meaning ‘(to reward". Iron Mouth Liu took one look at it and
said, "You’ve lost something, haven’t you?"!’
‘Goodness! He sounds pretty good!’ exclaimed Li Wan.
Lin’s wife continued:
‘Then he went on to say that as shang was made up of xiao (2) meaning "small" on
top, with kou (3) meaning "mouth" in the middle, the lost object was small enough
to fit inside the mouth. It must be some jewel or precious stone.’
Amid cries of ‘Miraculous!’ and ‘Go on!’, Lin’s wife continued:
‘Then he said that we should be careful to notice that the radical element was bei
(4) meaning "a cowry shell" and not the similar radical jian (5) meaning "to appear",
hence the object’s disappearance. . . And the top element of the word taken as a
whole was very like dang (6) meaning "to pawn", so we should go straight to the
pawnshop. Then he pointed out that by adding a ren (7) "man" to the left-hand side,
the compound chang (8) meaning "to re?deem" was formed. Find the man in the
pawnshop, pay the price, and the lost object will be redeemed...’
‘What are we waiting for?’ cried the girls. ‘Search the neighbourhood! If we work
our way through the pawn-shops, we’re sure to find the right one sooner or later.
And once we’ve found the jade, it will be easy enough to find the thief.’
‘Find the jade and we needn’t even bother who the thief is,’ said Li Wan. Turning to
Steward Lin’s wife she con?tinued: ‘Go and tell Mrs Lian what you have just told us.
Then she can tell Her Ladyship and set her mind at rest. And ask Mrs Lian to send
someone out to search the pawnshops.’
Lin’s wife set off at once.
Things seemed more hopeful now, and relative calm was restored. They were waiting
in a somewhat bemused state for Xiu-yan to return when they saw Tealeaf
beckon?ing from the gateway to one of the junior maids. She ran out and he said:
‘Quick! Go in and tell Master Bao and their Ladyships and the ladies and young
misses that I’ve got the most wonderful piece of news!’
‘Well come on!’ burst out the maid. ‘What is it? Out with it!’
Tealeaf started laughing and clapping his hands.
‘All right, I’ll tell you. And then you can go in and tell them, and we can split the
reward between us. Guess what? The most reliable information has reached me as to
the whereabouts of the Missing Jade!’
The outcome of all this excitement will be related in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 95



A rumour comes true and the Imperial Consort
passes away
A counterfeit is deceptively like the real thing,
and Bao-yu loses his wits

There was Tealeaf at the entrance to Green Delights, pro?claiming his discovery of
the missing jade. A junior maid hurried in to tell Bao-yu. The others, when they heard,
propelled Bao-yu towards the entrance to question Tealeaf, while they stood listening
in the covered gallery. Bao-yu, greatly relieved at the news, walked out and asked
Tealeaf:
‘Where did you find it? Come on, give it to me.’
Tealeaf replied:
‘I’m afraid I couldn’t bring it with me. I need a guaran?tor.’
‘But how did you find it? Tell me, and I’ll send some?one to fetch it.’
‘I heard that Steward Lin was going to consult the word-diviner,’ said Tealeaf, ‘so I
went along with him. When I heard the word ‘pawnshop’, I didn’t wait to hear the
rest, but went racing round the pawnshops. I de?scribed the jade to them, and
eventually one of them said, “We’ve got it.” I asked him to hand it over, but he
in?sisted on having the pawn-ticket. When I asked him how much it had been
pawned for, he said he had one for three hundred taels and another for five hundred.
The one for three hundred was brought in the day before yesterday, the one for five
hundred came in today.’
‘Quick,’ interrupted Bao-yu. ‘Take three hundred taels and five hundred. Get them
both, and we can see which is the right one.’
       But Aroma called out jeeringly from within:
‘You’re not going to take any notice of him, are you? I remember my elder brother
telling me when I was a little girl, that the people who deal in that kind of jade pawn
one or two from their stock when they are short of cash. Every pawnshop must have
at least one of them.’
At first everyone had been carried away by Tealeaf’s story. But now, after reflecting
on what Aroma had just said, they all began to laugh.
‘Come inside, Master Bao. Don’t listen to that fool. Whatever it is he’s talking about,
it obviously isn’t the real thing.’
Bao-yu laughed too. At that moment, Xiu-yan returned from her mission.
On her arrival at Green Bower Hermitage, she had come straight to the point. Would
Adamantina consult the planchette for them? Her request met with a scornful laugh.
‘I thought you were above such worldly things, Xiu?-yan. I am sure we should never
have been such friends if I had known you would ever let idle talk induce you to
come bothering me. Anyway, I’m afraid this planchette you mention is something I
am not familiar with.’
With this, she clearly intended to dismiss the subject, and Xiu-yan regretted ever
having come. She knew what a difficult disposition Adamantina had. But now that
she had broached the subject, it seemed such a pity to return empty-handed. She
made no attempt to insist on her friend’s psychic powers, but instead tried to win
Adaman?tina around by speaking of the urgent light in which Aro?ma and the others
viewed the loss. At this, Adamantina showed signs of relenting, and Xiu-yan rose to
her feet and bowed humbly before her several times. Adamantina sighed.
‘Are we to be at everyone’s beck and call? Since I have been here, I have kept this a
secret. Now, if I make an exception for you, I shall never be left in peace.’
‘I felt I had to come, their need seemed so great,’ replied Xiu-yan. ‘I knew that you
would feel sorry for them. If anyone else should ask, you will be quite free to say no.
No one would ever press you into it.’
Adamantina laughed. She told one of the lay-sisters to light some incense, and went
herself to fetch the tray of sand and the planchette-wand from a chest. After writing
out the requisite incantation, she told Xiu-yan to kneel and pray. When this was done,
they both stood and held the wand by its double handle. Before long it began to
move across the tray. The characters it traced with a rapid motion in the sand read as
follows:
ALAS!
IT LEFT NOR TRACE
NOR SIGN.
GONE TO GREENSICKNESS PEAK, TO LIE
AT THE FOOT OF AN AGE-OLD PINE
WHY TRAVERSE COUNTLESS MOUNTAINS,
         SEARCHING FOR YOUR FRIEND?
FOLLOW ME AND LAUGH TO SEE
YOUR JOURNEY AT AN END!

The writing ceased, and the wand came to rest.
‘Which spirit did you invoke?’ asked Xiu-yan.
‘Iron Crutch Li,’ replied Adamantina.
Xiu-yan copied down the writing, and asked Adamant?ma to give an explanation of
the line.
‘How could I?’ she replied. ‘I don’t understand them myself. Take it back to the
others. Many of them are far cleverer than I am, I’m sure.’
Xiu-yan did not press her, but returned to Green Delights. On her arrival, she was
besieged with questions.
‘Tell us what happened!’ they all cried.
Instead of giving them a lengthy description of the seance, Xiu-yan handed her
transcript straight to Li Wan. The girls and Bao-yu crowded round to read it. Between
them they came to the following interpretation of the lines: the jade would not be
found by looking for it, and yet it was not irretrievably lost. At some unforeseeable
time, when no one was looking for it, it would just turn up. But as for Green-sickness
Peak, no one had any idea where that could be.
‘It may be some sort of hidden clue,’ suggested Li Wan. ‘We’ve certainly never had
such a mountain in our garden, and one is not going to spring suddenly from
nowhere. The only explanation I can think of is that whoever stole the jade lost his
nerve and threw it away, and now it 5 lying beneath some miniature mountain in a
rockery somewhere near a pine-tree. But what’s all this about ‘fol?low me’ at the
end?’
‘Who was the spirit invoked?’ asked Dai-yu.
‘Iron Crutch Li,’ Xiu-yan informed her.
‘He’d be a hard one to follow!’ protested Tan-chun.
Aroma, meanwhile, in her desperation, took the words quite literally and set to in
earnest, searching blindly everywhere. She left no stone in the garden unturned, but
all to no avail. When she returned, Bao-yu did not even ask her if she had had any
success, but just gave her a silly grin.
‘Little ancestor!’ cried Musk. ‘For pity’s sake tell us where you lost it! At least then if
we have to suffer for it, we will know why!’
‘You wouldn’t listen to me when I said I’d lost it out?side,’ protested Bao-yu. ‘How
am I supposed to know any better now?’
Li Wan and Tan-chun suggested that they had all had a long and tiring day. It was now
eleven o’clock. Dai-yu, they observed, had been too weary to stay up any longer, and
had gone home on her own.
‘We should all go to bed now,’ they proposed. ‘Tomorrow we can start afresh.’
The gathering dispersed. Bao-yu went straight to sleep. Aroma and the other maids,
however, were quite unable to get to sleep, and sat up all night long, weeping and
brood?ing by turns.
But we must leave them for a while, and turn our atten?tion to Dai-yu. When she
reached home, her thoughts turned once more to the subject that had always
pre?occupied her, the bond of gold and jade between Bao-yu and Bao-chai. On this
occasion, her conclusions were more gratifying than usual.
‘How can there have been any truth in the prophecy made by the Monk and the
Taoist?’ she argued with herself. ‘If there really were a bond of gold and jade, how
could Bao-yu lose his jade like this? Perhaps I am an unforeseen circumstance that
has broken the bond...’
More reflections of this kind brought her an unwonted peace of mind. Her weariness
after the day’s exertions seemed to fall from her, and she began reading again.
Nightingale, however, was worn out, and urged her mis?tress repeatedly to go to
sleep. Dai-yu lay down, but con?tinued to think. This time it was the crab-trees that
occu?pied her thoughts.
‘Bao-yu’s jade is no ordinary stone. He was born with it, and whatever happens to it
is highly significant. If the crab-blossom were a good omen, then why should he lose
his jade at the same time? It must be inauspicious. I’m afraid something unlucky will
happen to him.’
Down went her spirits again. And then she saw it in yet another light, and became
optimistic once more. Perhaps both the blossoming and the loss of the jade were
meant to happen, were both in some way timely and auspicious. She lay awake in the
throes of these conflicting emotions, and Only fell asleep in the early hours.
Early the next morning, Lady Wang sent servants to make inquiries in the pawnshops,
while Xi-feng set in mo?tion her own secret investigations. Several days went by, but
despite their combined efforts, there was still no sign of the missing jade. Luckily
word of the disaster had as yet reached neither Grandmother Jia nor Jia Zheng. But
Aroma and the other maids lived from day to day in unbearable suspense, while
Bao-yu, who had now been absent from school for several days, was becoming
pro?gressively more morose, listless and silent. Lady Wang was not too worried by
this, judging it to be a temporary affliction brought on by the loss of his jade.
She was sitting one day lost in thought, when Jia Lian came into her room, and having
paid his respects, announced with a complacent smile:
‘Uncle Zheng has today had word from Yu-cun that Uncle Wang Zi-teng has been
promoted to a position in the Grand Secretariat. He has received an Imperial Decree
to proceed to the capital. His official instatement is to be on the twentieth of the
First month of next year, and an urgent dispatch has been sent to summon him from
the frontier. He will be travelling day and night, and should be here in half a month or
so. I have come especially to bring you this news, Aunt.’
Lady Wang was absolutely delighted. She had only just been thinking how few of her
own family she had around her, a deficiency that had been highlighted during her
sis?ter’s latest troubles. Her brother Zi-teng had been too far away to be able to
wield any influence on their behalf. But now, with his new appointment and return to
the capital, she could expect a revival of Wang family prestige from which Bao-yu too
would be able to benefit. For the time being she felt able to dismiss her anxiety over
the missing jade, and looked forward more and more to her brother’s return.
A day or two later, Jia Zheng came in unexpectedly, and with tear-stained face and
voice choking with emo?tion, told her:
‘You must inform Mother immediately that her pres?ence is required at once at the
Palace. There is no need for a large party to go. It will be sufficient if you escort
Mother. Her Grace has suddenly been taken ill, and has fallen into a coma. There is a
court eunuch waiting out?side. He says the official diagnosis by the College of
Physicians is an incurable stroke.’
Lady Wang burst into tears.
‘This is no time for crying,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You must go and tell Mother at once.
Break it to her gently. We must not cause the old lady too much of a shock.’
So saying, Jia Zheng went out to give the staff their instructions. Lady Wang dried her
eyes and went in to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. She said simply that Yuan?chun
was ill, and that they must go to the Palace to pre?sent their respects.’
‘Merciful Buddha!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘How can she have fallen ill again?
Last time if you remem?ber I had such a fright, and then we found out that I had
been imagining it all. If Only I were imagining it now!’
Lady Wang talked to the old lady, and at the same time urged Faithful and the other
maids to look out her court robes and begin attiring her. She then went in haste to
her own apartment, dressed and returned to wait on Grand?mother J ia. In a short
while they were ready, and walked out from the main hall to the sedan-chairs that
were wait?ing to carry them to the palace.
Yuan-chun, since her elevation to the Imperial Bed-chamber, had been the cherished
object of the emperor’s favours, and had become as a result somewhat plump. From
the constant pressure and daily exhaustion of life at court, she had also developed a
chronic bronchial condi?tion. A few days previously, when returning late from
attendance at a banquet, she had caught a chill,. which soon brought on her old
complaint. This time, however, it was a severe attack. Phlegm completely obstructed
her passages, causing a coldness and faintness in her limbs. The emperor was
informed, and a court physician sum?moned at once. But she could swallow none of
the medi?cines that he prescribed, and even the decongestant salts they tried to
administer had no beneficial effect. Con?cerned at her critical condition, her
attendant eunuchs reported again to His Majesty, requesting that the neces?sary
precautions be taken. And so her immediate family were summoned to the Palace.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang presented themselves at the palace, and entered
the Imperial Concubine’s Bed-chamber, to find her choked with phlegm, with saliva
dribbling from her mouth, no longer capable of speech. When she saw her
grandmother coming towards her, her face took on the most pitiful expression, as if
she wanted to weep but no longer had the strength to do so. Grand?mother Jia came
forward to do homage, and offered a few words of comfort. A little later, the official
cards of Jia Zheng and company were brought in, and a lady-in-waiting presented
them for Her Grace’s inspection. She no longer had the strength to look at them,
however, and her face was growing paler minute by minute.
The eunuchs were about to report to the emperor again, and foreseeing that the
other concubines would soon arrive to pay their last respects, asked the Jia rela?tives
if they would kindly step outside and wait in one of the ante-chambers of the Palace.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang had no choice but to conform to court regulations,
and wrench themselves away. Holding back their tears, they left the chamber with
sorrowful hearts.
They could see messages being passed within the Palace, and shortly afterwards a
eunuch came out and sent for an official from the Imperial Board of Astronomy.
Grand?mother Jia knew Only too well what this meant. He was requesting an
auspicious date for the funeral. It was all over. But still she dared not make a move. It
was not long before a junior eunuch came out to make the official announcement:
‘Her Grace the Jia Concubine has passed away.’
It was the nineteenth of the twelfth month. Spring Commencement fell on the
eighteenth of the twelfth month of that year, being the year Jia Yin; the nineteenth of
the month was therefore also, astrologically speaking, within the month Yin of the
following Mao year. Her Grace was forty-three years old.
Grandmother Jia rose, and doing her best to remain composed, left the Palace,
climbed into her sedan and was carried home. Jia Zheng and company had also been
in?formed, and they too made the sad journey home. Lady Xing, Li Wan, Xi-feng,
Bao-yu and other members of the family were lined up on both sides of the
courtyard before the main hall of Rong-guo House to greet first Grand?mother Jia,
then Jia Zheng and Lady Wang as they returned. Our narrative passes over the tearful
family scene.
Early next day, all members of the family with official rank went to the Palace to pay
their last respects, and to mourn as the rites prescribed. The details of Yuan-chun’s
tomb were the responsibility of the Minister of Works, and Jia Zheng found himself
being frequently entertained by his President, and consulted by his colleagues. It was
a very busy time - not at all like the period of the previous court funerals for the
Dowager Empress and the Zhou Concubine. Because Yuan-chun had died without
issue, she was given the posthumous title: ‘Illustrious and Chaste Imperial Concubine’.
This was in conformity with state precedent. But of this no more.
Everyone in the Jia family was kept extremely busy, travelling to and from the Palace
daily for the duration of the funeral; Luckily Xi-feng’s health had improved a little of
late, and she was able to get up and manage the house?hold. She was also preparing
to celebrate the return of Wang Zi-teng. Her own elder brother, Wang Ren, now that
his uncle was to be a Privy Councillor and in a posi?tion of such influence, was also
on his way to the capital with his family. Xi-feng was glad of this. The knowledge that
she would have these extra Wangs around her also gave her renewed confidence,
and had a beneficial effect on her health. Lady Wang, no w that Xi-feng was up and
about again, unloaded half of her responsibilities onto her, and with the reassuring
prospect of having her elder brother back in the capital soon, felt more at peace.
Bao-yu was not entitled to attend any of his eldest sis?ter’s funeral ceremonies, as he
held no official rank. He did no work either, and was left undisturbed in his idleness;
the Preceptor attributed his state to the recent family events, while Jia Zheng was far
too busy to keep a check on his son’s studies. Our hero might have been expected to
seize this as an ideal opportunity to amuse himself in the delightful company of his
sister and cousins. But from the day he lost his jade, he just sat around all the time
d9ing nothing, and if he spoke, did so in an incoherent mumble. When Grandmother
Jia and the others returned from the Palace, he went over to pay his respects if told
to do so; if not, he stayed where he was. All this time Aroma and his other maids
grew more and more guilty and apprehensive. They dared not take him to task, for
fear that he might have a tantrum. Each day he drank, his tea and ate his meals,
when they were placed before him. But he would as soon have gone without.
It eventually dawned on Aroma that this was not just a mood of his, but a genuine
illness. When she had a free moment, she slipped over to the Naiad’s House, and had
a word with Nightingale.
‘If only your Mistress would talk to him, and try to cheer him up,’ she said.
Nightingale passed this message on to Dai-yu straight away. But Dai-yu now saw
herself as Bao-yu’s future bride, and felt a need to behave towards. him with
scrupu?lous modesty.
‘If he should come to see me,’ she argued with herself, ‘I should have to receive
him politely, for the sake of our childhood friendship. But as for going over to see him
myself, that is quite out of the question.’
So she turned a deaf ear to Aroma’s entreaties. Aroma next went secretly to tell
Tan-chun. But Tan-chun was herself plunged in gloom. To her mind, the strange
flowering of the crab-trees had been the first of a series of’ ill omens, followed by the
still stranger loss of the Pre?cious Jade, and now by her sister’s death. With the
family fortunes so evidently on the decline, how could she find it in herself to rally
Bao-yu’s spirits? Besides, as brother and sister, they were obliged to maintain a
certain distance. She did visit him once or twice, but he seemed indifferent to her
presence and she made no further efforts.’
Bao-chai also knew of the missing jade. Her mother’ had already told her of her
proposed betrothal to Bao-yu, the day she discussed it with Lady Wang and all but
consented.
‘Although it is your Aunt Wang’s proposal,’ she had said to Bao-chai, ‘I have still not
given my final consent. I said we should have to wait until Pan comes home. What do
you say to the idea? Are you willing?’
‘Mother,’ replied Bao-chai, in a most serious tone, ‘you don’t need to ask me. A
daughter’s future lies in her parents’ hands. Since Father is dead, the decision is
entirely yours. Consult Pan, if you wish, but why me?’
Aunt Xue was most touched by this display of modesty in her daughter, proof that
her basically sound character had not been in any way spoiled by her luxurious
up?bringing. She would not mention Bao-yu’s name to her again. Bao-chai for her
part maintained a strict taboo from that day forth on those two syllables. So when
she came to hear of the missing jade, despite the concern she felt, she refrained from
inquiring any further and contented herself with what she gleaned from those
around her, while maintaining a show of complete indifference.
Aunt Xue, on the other hand, sent a maid over several times to inquire after Bao-yu.
She was also greatly con?cerned about her own son, and awaited her elder brother’s
arrival with impatience. His influence would surely secure Pan’s release. With’ the
death of the Imperial Concubine, she could see how busy the Jias were. But as
Xi-feng was well enough to take charge of the household management, she did not
feel it necessary to visit them often.
The one to suffer most during all this was Aroma, although she tried to remain quiet
and calm, and to com?fort Bao-yu and minister to his needs. He seemed to
understand nothing, and she could only watch over him in secret anguish.
After a few days, Yuan-chun’s coffin was laid out in the Imperial Chapel ‘of Rest, and
Grandmother Jia and the other senior members of the family attended funeral
ser?vices there for several days. Bao-yu was becoming daily more and more of an
imbecile. He had no fever and was not in any physical pain, but he was eating little
and sleep?ing less and becoming quite incoherent in his speech. Aroma, Musk and
the other maids were at their wits’ end, and several times went to report to Xi-feng,
who came over constantly to see how he was. At first she had thought that he was
simply upset that his jade had not been found. But now, seeing the deranged state
into which he was sinking, she sent for the doctor. The doctor paid daily visits, and
more than one kind of medicine was prescribed, but all seemed to do more harm
than good. To all inquiries as to where he felt pain, he was quite unable to reply.
When Yuan-chun’s funeral ceremonies were over, Grandmother Jia’s thoughts turned
again to Bao-yu, and she came to the Garden to visit him, accompanied by Lady
Wang. Aroma told Bao-yu to go out and greet her properly. Bao-yu was still able to
get about, and managed to greet his grandmother presentably, with Aroma at his
side prompting him at every turn.
‘My dear boy!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘I am so relieved! I was led to believe
that you were seriously ill. But now I see that you are quite your normal self.’
Lady Wang too ‘seemed pleasantly surprised. Bao-yu said nothing and gave an inane
grin. They went in and sat down. When Grandmother Jia asked him a question, he
could only repeat whatever Aroma said. It soon became clear to them all that so far
from being his normal self, he was now little more than a halfwit. The more
Grand?mother Jia saw, the more it puzzled and distressed her.
‘When I came in,’ she said, ‘he seemed quite well. But I can see now that he really
is seriously ill. He seems to have quite lost his wits. Will someone please tell me what
has happened?’
Lady Wang realized that they could not keep it from her any longer. For Aroma’s sake,
who stood there in mortal terror, she stuck to Bao-yu’s story and told Grandmother
Jia that he had lost his jade at the Earl of Lin-an’s party, whispering it all in the old
lady’s ear, afraid it might come as too great a shock to her.
‘The servants have been told to look everywhere,’ she added. ‘We have asked
several fortune-tellers, and they all say that it’s in a pawnshop, so it can only be a
matter of time before we find it.’
Grandmother Jia rose to her feet in great agitation, tears streaming down her cheeks.
‘How could he lose such a precious thing? You are not fit to look after him! What
about his father? Surely he has not washed his hands of it too?’
Lady Wang could see that Grandmother Jia was in a rage. She told Aroma and the
others to kneel, and herself replied, with contrite face and lowered head:
‘I was afraid you would be upset,’ Mother, and that his father would be angry, so I
still have not told him.’
‘But can’t you see?’ cried Grandmother Jia. ‘The jade is Bao-yu’s very life. Losing it
is what has made him lose his wits. What are we going to do? People all over town
have heard of the jade. If someone picks it up, he’s hardly going to hand it in. Send
someone at once to his father and ask him to come here. I must speak to him about
this.’
Lady Wang, Aroma and all the others present were terrified of the possible
consequences and entreated Grandmother Jia to relent.
‘Imagine how angry Sir Zheng will be, Mother! Think of poor Bao-yu! For his sake,
give us one last chance. We will search for all we are worth.’
‘Why should you fear his father’s wrath? I shall be here,’ said the old lady firmly.
She told Musk to send someone for Jia Zheng. Minutes later, the message returned
that he was out visiting a friend.
‘Well, we’ll go ahead without him,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘For the present, none of
the servants is to be punished. “Those are my instructions, and I shall take full
responsibility. Send for Lian and tell him to write out a Notice of Reward, and post
copies of it wherever Bao-yu went on the day he lost his jade. It is to say: “Reward for
return of jade, ten thousand taels of silver. Reward for information leading to its
recovery, five thousand taels.” And there is to be no question of not paying up in full
if someone does come forward. This is the only way we shall ever find it. If we rely on
our own people, we could go on searching for the rest of our lives.’
Lady Wang did not dare voice her reservations about this plan of action. Jia Lian was
sent fo’r, and told to have the posters made up with all speed.
‘Move Bao-yu’s things to my apartment,’ Grandmother Jia ordered one of the
servants. ‘I shall Only need Aroma and Ripple to wait on him. The rest can stay here
and look after his apartment.’
Bao-yu remained silent throughout all of this, grinning inanely. Grandmother Jia took
him by the hand and led him out, Aroma and the others clustering round to sup?port
him as far as the garden gate. When they reached her apartment, Grandmother Jia
told Lady Wang to sit down, and herself supervised the putting in order of the inner
room. When this was done, she spoke to Lady Wang:
‘You know why I have brought him over here, don’t you? In the first place, there are
so few people living in the garden now, and I can’t help feeling there’s something odd
about the way those crab-trees in his courtyard died so suddenly, and then so
suddenly flowered. Before now he could always rely on his jade to keep any evil
influences at bay. But now that it is lost, I am afraid the evil can get in more easily. So
I thought it best for him to stay here with me. He had better not go out for a few days.
When the doctor comes, he can see him here.’
‘Of course you are right,’ said Lady Wang promptly. ‘Your good luck will shelter him
from any such influ?ences, now that he is here.’
‘My luck! Nothing of the sort! It is quieter here, that is all, and there are plently of
sutras for him to, read, to help settle his mind. Ask him if he agrees.
When his mother put the question to him, Bao-yu merely smiled. Finally,
prompted by Aroma, he answered, ‘Yes Mother.’ Lady Wang’ was moved to tears by
the pitiful spectacle her son presented, but contained herself in Grandmother Jia’s
presence. Grandmother Jia could see that she was somewhat overwrought, and told
her to go back to her own apartment.
‘Leave him to me. I shall look after him. When his father gets home this evening,
tell him there is no need for him to come and see me today. I do not want him to
know yet.’
When Lady Wang had left, Grandmother Jia told Faith?ful to bring her one of her
sedative remedies. Bao-yu took it; and there we must leave’ them, for the’ present.

Jia Zheng, on his way home that evening, heard from within his carriage the following
conversation in the street:
‘If you want to get rich, I know of an easy way...’
‘Oh? What’s that?’
‘I heard today that at Rong-guo House one of the young nobs has lost a jade, and
they’ve posted a notice of reward, with all the details - shape, size, colour, etc. Ten
thousand they’re offering to anyone who hands it in, and five thousand for
information!’
Jia Zheng did not catch every word. But he heard enough to be considerably alarmed.
He hurried home, and on arrival summoned one of the janitors and ques?tioned him
about the whole affair.
‘I knew nothing of all this until today, sir,’ replied the janitor. ‘The first I heard of it
was this afternoon, when Mr Lian gave us Her Old Ladyship’s orders to put the
posters up.’
‘We are doomed!’ said Jia Zheng to himself with a bitter sigh. ‘This son of mine is
the bane of our lives! When he was a child he was the talk of the, neighbourhood. It
has taken us these last ten years or more to stop their tongues, and now we have to
go putting up a poster like this, announcing our troubles to the world!’
He went in without further delay and questioned Lady Wang, who told him the
whole story. When he learnt that the reward was the old lady’s idea, Jia Zheng knew
that he could not very well openly oppose it. He criticized Lady Wang instead for her
part in it, and going out once more, gave orders for the posters to be taken down
without Grandmother Jia’s knowledge. As it turned out, some local loafers had
already pulled them down.
Despite this, a day or two later, a man did arrive at the main gate of Rong-guo House,
claiming to have brought the jade. The servants were ecstatic. ‘Give it here!’ they
cried. ‘We’ll take it in for you.’
‘Not so fast!’ The man fumbled inside his gown, and brought out the reward poster.
‘Look here,’ he said, pointing to the wording on the poster. ‘This is what your masters
put up, isn’t it? “Ten thousand taels for return of jade” - plain as daylight. I may be a
pauper today, my man, but wait till I come into my ten thousand. You’ll sing a
different tune then.’
The gateman could see he was a difficult customer.
‘Well at least give us a look, so we can go in and report.’
At first the man refused. But eventually he allowed himself to be persuaded, and
producing it from within his gown, he exhibited the jade to them fleetingly on the
palm of his hand, saying:
‘Isn’t this what you are looking for?’
Now these servants were all employed on external duties, and though they had
heard tell of Bao-yu’s jade, had hardly ever set eyes on it. This was in fact their first
opportunity of inspecting the thing at close quarters.’ This did not deter them from
running into the house in a great state of excitement, racing to be the first with the
news.
They found that both Jia Zheng and Jia She were out. It was Jia Lian who received
their report.,
‘Is it genuine or a fake?’ he asked them sceptically.
‘I saw it with my own eyes!’ replied one of them. ‘He wouldn’t hand it over to us
though, but insisted on seeing one of the masters, so that he could exchange it
directly for the money.
Jia Lian could not help being infected by their enthu?siasm, and went in straight away
to tell Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Aroma, when she heard, was over?joyed,
and brought ‘her hands piously together in a prayer of thanks to Lord Buddha.
Grandmother Jia stood firmly by her word.
‘Tell Lian to invite him into the study at once,’ she said to Lady Wang in a’ flurry of
excitement. ‘Once we have had a look at it, he will get his money straight away.’
Jia Lian did as instructed and invited the stranger in, treating him most politely and
expressing profuse thanks’.
‘I should just like to let the owner have a look at it, if I may,’ he said. ‘Then you shall
have your money, every pe’nny of it, I assure you.’
Reluctantly, the man handed him a little parcel wrapped in red silk. Jia Lian opened it.
There lay a lustrous jade. Surely this was it! Jia Lian, to tell the truth, had never taken
much, notice of it while it hung round Bao-yu’s neck. Now he looked closely at it for
some time. The in?scription was certainly familiar. He remembered some of the
words, such as “dispels the harms of witchcraft”. With a jubilant air, he strode in to
show it to the ladies, leaving a servant to wait on the stranger.
By now the whole family had heard the news, and were gathered in Grandmother
Jia’s apartment, waiting eagerly, each one anxious to be the first to see. Xi-feng saw
Jia Lian come in, and thrusting forward her hand, snatched the parcel from him and
without looking at it herself, placed it in Grandmother Jia’s hand.
‘Can’t you even let me take the credit for a small thing like this?’ said Jia Lian with a
sneer.
Grandmother Jia opened the silk bundle and examined the stone. It seemed a great
deal ‘duller than she remem?bered. She rubbed it between her fingers. Faithful
brought her spectacles, and put them on for her. She examined it again.
‘How peculiar! This must surely be it; and yet it seems to have lost its original lustre
entirely.’
Lady Wang now inspected it. She too felt unable to identify it with any certainty, and
told Xi-feng to come over and take a look.
‘There is a certain similarity,’ said Xi-feng after her in?spection. ‘But the colour is
not quite right. We should show it to Bao-yu himself. He will be able to tell.’
Aroma was standing at her side, and had managed to have a look at the stone. Her
eyes told her that it was not the one, but her heart was too full of hope to allow her
to voice her misgivings. Xi-feng took the stone from Grand?mother Jia’s hands and
went with Aroma to show it to Bao-yu, who had just awoken.
‘Your stone has been found!’ announced Aroma.
Bao-yu’s eyes were still heavy with sleep. He took the stone in his hand, and ‘without
so much as a glance, let it drop to the ground.
‘Why try to fool me!’ he said, smiling strangely.
Xi-feng picked it up promptly.
‘That’s odd,’ she said. ‘How can you tell without even looking at it?’
Bao-yu only smiled again. Lady Wang had come in meanwhile, and observed what
happened.
‘It is perfectly natural,’ she commented. ‘That strange jade came into the world
with him, it is his very own. He would be bound to know whether this was genuine or
not. Someone must have read the reward-notice and faked it.
The truth dawned on them all. Jia Lian, who heard it all from the outer room, said at
once:
‘If it is a fake, give it to me! I’ll have it out with this impostor! How dare he play a
trick on us, in such a serious matter!’
‘No, Lian!’ ordered Grandmother Jia. ‘Give it back to him, and tell him to leave. No
doubt he was desperately poor, and when he read the notice, saw a way of making a
few pennies. It’s understandable. Now he has been found out, and whatever it cost
him to make the thing has been wasted too. Don’t be too hard on him. Give him back
the jade, and just say that it S not ours, and there’s been a mis?take. Give him a few
taels of silver. If people hear that he’s been well treated, it will encourage someone’
with genuine information to come forward. If we treat this one harshly, no one will
bring it in even if they do find it.’
Jia Lian went as bidden. The impostor had been waiting in the study, and as time
went by and no one returned, had already begun to lose his nerve. Now he saw the
irate figure of Jia Lian advancing into the room. For the out?come of their
subsequent interview, please read the next chapter.




CHAPTER 96



Xifeng conceives an ingenious plan of deception
And Frowner is deranged by an inadvertent
disclosure



When he saw the scowl on Jia Lian’s face, the impostor’s heart sank. He rose
nervously to greet him, but before he could say a word, Jia Lian gave a chilling laugh
and silenced him with:
‘Impudent fool! I should like to wring your miserable little... Do you realize who you
are dealing with? How dare you play such tricks on us?’
Turning, he called for his pages. The order was echoed outside like a clap of thunder,
and several pages responded in unison and presented themselves.
‘Fetch a rope and bind this fellow!’ order Jia Lian. ‘When the Master returns, I shall
report the matter and pack him off to the yamen.’
‘Ready, sir!’ cried the chorus of pages. But not one of them moved a muscle.
The impostor was at first immobilized with terror. But Jia Lian’s hectoring, and the
prospect of being taken to court, finally stirred him to action. He fell on his knees and
kotowed franticaily in Jia Lian’s direction, jabbering:
‘Your Honour! Spare me! It was poverty f9rced me to it! I know it was ashameful
thing to do. I had to borrow money to have it made, but please keep it and give it to
the young master of the house with my humble compli?ments, to play with!’
Repeated head-knocking followed. Jia Lian spat con?temptuously.
‘Idiot! We certainly don’t want any of your trash here!’
At this point, Lai Da came into the room.
‘Do not waste your anger on this creature, sir,’ he interceded, with a placatory smile.
‘Spare him this once, and throw him out.’
‘Why should I? The worm…’
While Jia Lian and Lai Da continued to haggle over the poor man’s fate, the servants
standing in the doorway offered him their advice:
‘Come on, you great ninny! Kotow to Mr Lian and Mr Lai, and clear off! What are
you waiting for? A kick in the stomach?’
The man was down in a flash, kotowed to Jia Lian and Lai Da, wrapped his hands
round the back of his head and fled like a rat.
This episode became known in the locality as ‘the case of Master Jia Bao-yu and the
Counterfeit (Jia) Precious Jade (Bao-yu).
*

When Jia Zheng returned home that same day from a visit, no one told him what had
happened in his absence. They thought that with the Lantern Festival coming up, it
would be a mistake to make him angry about something that was, after all, over and
done with. What with Yuan?-chun’s death, and their concern at Bao-yu’s illness, the
family was far too gloomy and preoccupied to celebrate New Year in anything but a
perfunctory fashion, and it passed by without any event worthy of notice in this
chronicle.
By the seventeenth of the first month, when Lady Wang was expecting her brother to
arrive in the capital any day, she had an unannounced visit from Xi-feng:
‘Lian has just come home with a piece of bad news, Aunt. It is about Uncle Zi-teng.
He was travelling post-haste on his way to the capital, and was only seventy miles
from here, when he died. Had you heard?’
‘No!’ exclaimed Lady Wang, aghast. ‘Sir Zheng didn’t mention anything of the sort
yesterday evening. Where did Lian hear this?’
 ‘At the home of Excellency Zhang from the Privy Council.’
Lady Wang stared in silence. Tears started from her eyes. Wiping them away, she
finally said:
‘Go and tell Lian to get confirmation of the news, and to see me as soon as he has.’
Xi-feng departed as bidden. Left on her own, Lady Wang gave way to her tears. A
brother and daughter dead, a son deranged - she could contain her burden of grief
and anxiety no longer. She began to feel a pain in her chest. And here was Jia Lian to
confirm the story:
‘Uncle was exhausted by the strain of the journey, and caught a chill. They were at
Ten Mile Village when this happened. A doctor was called, but the only one available
in such a remote spot turned out to be incompetent. He pre?scribed the wrong drugs,
and the first dose proved fatal. Uncle’s own family have set out for the place already,
but I do not know if they have arrived yet.’
These details touched Lady Wang to the quick, and the pain in her chest became so
severe that she could no longer sit upright. She told Suncloud to help her onto the
kang, and struggling to keep a grip on herself, told Jia Lian to report at once to Jia
Zheng.
‘Pack your things as quickly as you can, and go straight there to join the family and
help them with the funeral arrangements. Come back as soon as possible and let us
know how things stand. I know Xi-feng will not set her mind at rest until you are
back.’
Jia Lian could see that it would be inappropriate to raise any objections. He took his
leave of Jia Zheng, and set out for Ten Mile Village.
Jia Zheng had learned the news of Wang Zi-teng’s death independently. Depressed
already by the moronic decline into which his son had fallen since the loss of his jade,
a condition no doctor seemed able to cure, he responded with extreme gloom to this
latest blow and to Lady Wang’s attack following upon it. The time had come round
for the triennial review of civil servants stationed in the capital. Jia Zheng’s Board
gave him a high commenda?tion, and in the second month the Board of Civil Office
presented him for an audience with the Emperor. His Majesty, in view of Jia Zheng’s
record as a ‘diligent, fru?gal, conscientious and prudent servant of the Throne’,
appointed him immediately to the post of Grain Intendant for the province of Kiangsi.
The same day, Jia Zheng offered his humble acceptance and gratitude for the
hon?our, and suggested a day for his departure. Friends and rel?atives were all eager
to celebrate, but he was not in festive mood. He was loth to leave the capital at a
time when things were so unsettled at home, although at the same time he knew
that he could not delay his departure.
He was pondering this dilemma, when a message came to summon him to
Grandmother Jia’s presence. He made his way promptly to her apartment, where he
found Lady Wang also present, despite her illness. He paid his respects to
Grandmother Jia, who told him to be seated and then began:
‘In a few days, you will be leaving us to take up your post. There is something I
should like to discuss with you, if you are willing.’
The old lady’s eyes were wet with tears. Jia Zheng rose swiftly to his feet, and said:
‘Whatever you have to say, Mother, please speak: your word is my command.’
‘I shall be eighty-one this year;’ said Grandmother Jia, sobbing as she spoke. ‘You
are going away to a post in the provinces, and with your elder brother still at home,
you will not be able to apply for early retirement to come and look after me. When
you are gone, of the ones closest to my heart I shall only have Bao-yu left to me. And
he, poor darling, is in such a wretched state, I don’t know what we can do for him!
The other day I sent out Lai Sheng’s wife to have the boy’s fortune told. The man’s
reading was uncanny. What he said was: "This person must marry a lady with a
destiny of gold, to help him and support him. He must be given a marriage as soon as
possible to turn his luck. If not, he may not live.” Now I know you don’t believe in
such things, which is why I sent for you, to talk it over with you. You and his mother
must discuss it among yourselves. Are we to save him, or are we to do nothing and
watch him fade away?’
Jia Zheng smiled anxiously.
‘Could I, who as a child received such tender love and care from you, Mother, not
have fatherly feelings myself? It is just that I have been exasperated by his repeated
fail?ure to make progress in his studies, and have perhaps been too ambitious for
him. You are perfectly right in wanting to see him married. How could I possibly wish
to oppose you? I am concerned for the boy, and his recent illness has caused me
great anxiety. But as you have kept him from me, I have not ventured to say anything.
I should like to see him now for myself, and form my own impression of his
condition.’
Lady Wang saw that his eyes were moist, and knew that he was genuinely concerned.
She told Aroma to fetch Bao-yu and help him into the room. He walked in, and when
Aroma told him to pay his respects to his father, did exactly as she said. Jia Zheng saw
how emaciated his face had grown, how lifeless his eyes were. His son was like some
pathetic simpleton. He told them to take him back to his room.
‘I shall soon be sixty myself,’ he mused. ‘With this pro?vincial posting, it is difficult
to tell how many years it will be before I return. If anything were to happen to Bao-yu,
I should be left without an heir in my old age. I have a grandson, but that is not the
same. And then Bao-yu is the old lady’s favourite. If anything untoward occurred, I
should be still more deeply at fault.’
He glanced at Lady Wang. Her face was wet with tears. He thought of the sorrow it
would cause her too, and stood up again to speak.
‘If, from your wealth of experience, you have thought of a way to help him, Mother,
then how could I possibly raise any objection? We should do whatever you think is
best. But has Mrs Xue been informed?’
‘My sister has already expressed her agreement,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘We have only
been biding our time because Pan’s court-case has still not been settled.’
‘Yes, that is certainly the first obstacle,’ commented Jia Zheng. ‘How can a girl be
given in marriage while her elder brother is in jail? And besides there is Her Grace’s
death. Although that does not strictly entail any such pro?hibition, Bao-yu should at
least abide by the set term of mourning for a deceased elder sister, which would
mean a period 6f nine months during which marriage would be highly irregular. And
then, my own date of departure has already been reported to the throne, and I
cannot post?pone it now. That only leaves us a few days. There is not enough time.’
Grandmother Jia pondered her son’s words. ‘What he says is true,’ she thought to
herself. ‘If we wait for all of these conditions to be fulfilled, his father will have left,
and who knows to what state the boy’s health may de?teriorate. And then it may be
too late. We shall have to put aside the rules for once. There is no other way.’
Having reached this conclusion in her own mind, she spoke to Jia Zheng again.
‘If you will agree to this for him, I shall take care of any problems that may arise.
There is nothing that cannot be ironed out, of that I am confident. His mother and I
shall go over and put the matter personally to Mrs Xue. As for Pan, I shall ask young
Ke to go to him and explain that we are doing this to save Bao-yu’s life. When he
knows the reason, I am sure he will agree. As for marrying dur?ing a period of
mourning, strictly speaking one shouldn’t, I know. And besides, it is not right for him
to marry while lie is so ill. But it’s a question of turning his luck. Both families are
willing, and as the children have the bond of gold and jade to justify their union, we
can dis?pense with the usual reading of horoscopes. We just need to choose an
auspicious day to exchange presents in pro?per style, and then set a date for the
wedding itself, possible afterwards. No music during the wedding itself, but
otherwise we can follow court practice: twelve pairs of long-handled lanterns and an
eight-man palanquin for the bride. We shall have the ceremony in our southern form,
and keep our old customs of throwing dried fruit onto the bridal bed and so forth.
That will be enough to make it quite a proper wedding. Bao-chai is a sensible girl. We
need not worry on her account. And Aroma is a very reli?able person. We can count
on her to have a calming influ?ence on Bao-yu. She gets on well with Bao-chai too.
‘One other thing:. Mrs Xue once told us that a monk said Bao-chai should only
marry someone with a jade to match her golden locket. Perhaps when she comes to
live as Bao-yu’s wife, her locket will draw the jade back. Once they are married,
things will look up and the whole family will benefit. So, we must prepare a courtyard
and decorate it nicely - I should like you to choose it. We shan’t be in?viting any
friends or relations to the wedding, and we can have the party later, when Bao-yu is
better and the mourning period is over. This way, everything will be done in time,
and you will be able to see the young people married and set off with an easy mind.’
Jia Zheng had grave doubts about the proposal. But as it was Grandmother Jia’s, he
knew he could not go against it. He smiled dutifully, and hastened to reply:
‘You have thought it all out very well, Mother, and have taken everything into
account. We must tell the ser?vants not to go talking about this to everyone they
meet. It would hardly redound to our credit if people knew. And personally I doubt if
Mrs Xue will agree to the idea. But if she does, then I suppose we should do as you
suggest.’
‘You need not worry about Mrs Xue,’ said the old lady. ‘I can explain things to her.
Off you go then.’
Jia Zheng took his leave. He felt extremely uneasy about the whole idea. Official
business soon engulfed him, however - acceptance of his new papers of
appointment.. recommendations of staff from friends and relatives, an endless round
of social gatherings of one sort or another -- and he delegated all responsibility for
the marriage plans to Grandmother J ia, who in turn left the arrangements to Lady
Wang and Xi-feng. Jia Zheng’s only contributioh was to designate a twenty-frame
building in a courtyard behind the Hall of Exalted Felicity, to ‘he side of Lady Wang’s
private apartment, as Bao-yu’s new home. Grand?mother Jia’s mind was now quite
made up, and when she sent someone to communicate this to Jia Zheng he just
re?plied: ‘Very well.’ But of this, more later.
*

Bao-yu, after his brief interview with his father, was escorted back by Aroma to his
kang in the inner room. In?timidated by the Master’s presence in the next room,
none of the maids dared speak to him and he soon fell into a deep sleep. As a
consequence he did not hear a word of the conversation between his father and
Grandmother J ia. Aroma and the others did, however, and stood in com?plete
silence taking it all in. Aroma had heard rumours of this marriage-plan, rumours
whose. likelihood, it is true, had been strengthened by Bao-chai’s repeated absence
from family gatherings. Now that she knew it for a fact, all became crystal clear. She
was glad.
‘They’ve shown some sense at last!’ she thought to her?self, ‘Those two will make
by far the better match. And I shall be better off too. With Miss Chai here I’ll be able
to unload a lot of my responsibilities. The only trouble is, Master Bao still thinks of no
one but Miss Li.... It’s a good thing he didn’t hear just now. If he knew what they are
planning, I dread to think what trouble we’d have.’
This cast a shadow over her previous optimism. ‘What’s to be done?’ she continued
to brood to herself. ‘Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship obviously don’t know about
the secret feelings Master Bao and Miss Lin have for each other, and in their
enthusiasm they could tell him their plan, to try and cure him. But if he still feels as
he did -when he first saw Miss Lin, for instance, and hurled his jade to the ground
and wanted to smash it to pieces; or last summer in the Garden, when he mistook
me for her and poured his heart out to me; or when Nightingale teased him by saying
that Miss Lin was going away, and had him in such floods of tears - and if they go and
tell him now that he’s betrothed to Miss Chai and will have to give Miss Lin up for
ever, so far from turning his luck they’ll probably kill him! (Unless of course he’s going
through one of his deaf-and-dumb spells, in which case he probably won’t even
nonce.) I’d better tell them what I know, or three people may suffer!’
Aroma’s mind was made up. As soon as Jia Zheng had taken his leave of the ladies,
she left Ripple to look after Bao-yu, and went into the outer room. She walked over
to Lady Wang and whispered that she would like a word with her privately in the
room to the rear of Grandmother J ia’s apartment. Grandmother Jia imagined it to be
some message from Bao-yu and did not pay much attention, but continued to
engross herself in the wedding arrangements. Lady Wang rose to leave, and Aroma
followed her into the rear chamber, where she at once fell on her knees and began
crying. Lady Wang had no idea what it was all about, and taking her by the hand,
said:
‘Come now! What is all this? Has someone done you wrong? If so, stand up, and
tell me.’
‘It is something I shouldn’t really say, but in the cir?cumstances I feel I must.’
‘Well, tell me then. And take your time.’
‘You and Her Old Ladyship have made an excellent de?cision, in choosing Miss
Bao-chai as Bao-yu’s future bride ...’ began Aroma. ‘But, I wonder, ma’am, if you have
noticed which of the two young ladies Bao-yu is more closely attached to, Miss Chai,
or Miss Lin?’
‘As they have lived together since they were children,’ replied Lady Wang, ‘I
suppose he would be a little closer to Miss Lin.’
‘More than a little!’ protested Aroma, and went on to give Lady Wang a detailed
history of how things had always stood between Bao-yu and Dai-yu, and of the
various incidents that had occurred between them.
‘These are all things that you would have seen for your?self, ma’am,’ she added,
‘with the exception of his out?burst during the summer, which I have not mentioned
to a soul until now.’
Lady Wang drew Aroma towards her.
‘Yes, most of what you have told me I have been able to deduce for myself. What
you have said simply bears out my own observations. But you must all have heard
the Master’s words. Tell me, how did Bao-yu react?’
‘As things are at present, ma’am, Bao-yu smiles if some?one talks to him, but
otherwise he just sleeps. He heard nothing.’
‘In that case, what are we to do?’
‘It is not my place to say,’ replied Aroma. ‘Your Ladyship should inform Her Old
Ladyship of what I have said, and think of a suitable way of solving the problem.’
‘Then you had better go,’ said Lady Wang, ‘and leave it to me. Now would not be a
good moment to bring it up; there are too many people in the room. I shall wait for
an opportunity to tell Her Old Ladyship, and we will dis?cuss what to do.’
Lady Wang returned to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The old lady was talking to
Xi-feng, and when she saw Lady Wang come in, asked:
‘What did Aroma want? What was all that mysterious whispering about?’
Lady Wang answered her directly, and told the whole story of Bao-yu’s love for Dai-yu,
as Aroma had told it her. When she had finished, Grandmother Jia was silent for a
long while. Neither Lady Wang nor Xi-feng dared say a word. At last, Grandmother Jia
sighed and said:
‘Everything else seemed somehow soluble. It does not matter so much about
Dai-yu. But if Bao-yu really feels this way about her, it seems we have run into an
insoluble problem.’
Xi-feng looked very thoughtful for a minute, then said:
‘Not insoluble. I think I can see a solution. But I am not sure if you would agree to it
or not, Aunt.’
‘Whatever your idea is,’ said Lady Wang, ‘speak up and let Mother know. Then we
can all discuss it together.’
‘There is only one solution that I can think of,’ said Xi?feng. ‘It involves two things: a
white lie, and a piece of discreet substitution.’
‘Substitution? What do you mean?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
‘First of all,’ replied Xi-feng, ‘whether Bao-yu knows anything yet or not, we let it be
known that Sir Zheng proposes to betroth him to Miss Lin. We must watch for his
reaction. If he is quite unaffected, then there is no need to bother with my plan. But
if he does seem at all pleased at the news, it will make things rather more
com?plicated.’
‘Supposing he is pleased?’ asked Lady Wang. ‘What then?’
Xi-feng went over and whispered at some length in Lady Wang’s ear. Lady Wang
nodded, smiled and said:
‘Well, well... An ingenious idea, I must say!’
‘Come on, you two!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘Let me in on the secret: what are
you whispering about?’
Xi-feng was afraid that Grandmother J ia might not grasp her idea at once, and might
inadvertently give the game away. She leant across and whispered in the old lady’s
ear. Grandmother Jia did seem rather puzzled at
first. Xi-feng smiled, and added a few more words of explanation. Grandmother Jia
finally said with a smile:
‘Why not? But isn’t it rather hard on Bao-chai? And what about Miss Lin? What if
she gets to hear of it?’
‘We shall only tell Bao-yu’ replied Xi-feng. ‘No one else will be allowed to mention
it. That way no one need know.’
A maid came in and informed them that Mr Lian had returned. Lady Wang was
worried that Grandmother Jia might inquire into the distressing news that had
occa?sioned his journey, and cast a meaningful glance in Xi?feng’s direction. Xi-feng
went out to intercept him, and signalled to him with her lips to accompany her to
Lady Wang’s apartment and wait there. It was not long before Lady Wang came in, to
find Xi-feng red-eyed from weep?ing. Jia Lian paid his respects to Lady Wang, and
gave her an account of the funeral arrangements for Wang Zi-teng at Ten Mile
Village.
‘He has been posthumously awarded the rank of Grand Secretary, by Imperial
Decree,’ Jia Lian went on, ‘and the title Lord Wen-qin. The Court has given
instructions for the family to accompany the coffin en cortege to Nanking, and all
local mandarins have been instructed to look after them en route. The whole family
left yesterday for the South. Uncle’s widow asked me to convey her respects. She said
that there was so much she wanted to talk to you about, but that she would not be
able to come to the capital at present. My brother-in-law Wang Ren is coming here,
so I heard, and if they meet him on the way, they will tell him to come and give us
the latest news.’
Lady Wang responded to all of this with a grief that the reader can surely imagine.
‘Why don’t you lie down for a while, Aunt?’ said Xi-?feng. ‘In the evening, we can
talk further about Bao-yu’s affairs.’
Having uttered these comforting words, Xi-feng re?turned with Jia Lian to her own
apartment, where she informed him of all that had been decided and told him to give
instructions for the cleaning and refurbishing of the courtyard that was to be the
couple’s new home. But of this no more for the present.
*

A day or two after these events, Dai-yu, having eaten her breakfast, decided to take
Nightingale with her to visit Grandmother Jia. She wanted to pay her respects, and
also thought the visit might provide some sort of distrac?tion for herself. She had
hardly left the Naiad’s House, when she remembered that she had left her
handkerchief at home, and sent Nightingale back to fetch it, saying that she would
walk ahead slowly and wait for her to catch up. She had just reached the corner
behind the rockery at Drenched Blossoms Bridge - the very spot where she had once
buried the flowers with Bao-yu - when all of a sud?den she heard the sound of
sobbing. She stopped at once and listened. She could not tell whose voice it was, nor
could she distinguish what it was that the voice was com?plaining of, so tearfully and
at such length. It really was most puzzling. She moved forward again cautiously and
as she turned the corner, saw before her the source of the sobbing, a maid with large
eyes and thick-set eyebrows.
Before setting eyes on this girl, Dai-yu had guessed that one of the many maids in the
Jia household must have had an unhappy. love-affair, and had come here to cry her
heart out in secret. But now she laughed at the very idea. ‘How could such an
ungainly creature as this know the meaning of love?’ she thought to herself. ‘This
must be one of the odd-job girls, who has probably been scolded by one of the
senior maids.’ She looked more closely, but still could not place the girl. Seeing Dai-yu,
the maid ceased her weeping, wiped her cheeks, and rose to her feet.
‘Come now, what are you so upset about?’ inquired Dai-yu.
‘Oh Miss Lin!’ replied the maid, amid fresh tears. ‘Tell me if you think it fair. They
were talking about it, and how was I to know better? Just because I say one thing
wrong, is that a reason for sister to start hitting me?’
Dai-yu did not know what she was talking about. She smiled, and asked again:
‘Who is your sister?’
‘Pearl,’ answered the maid.
From this, Dai-yu concluded that she must work in Grandmother Jia’s apartment.
‘And what is your name?’
‘Simple.’
Dai-yu laughed. Then:
‘Why did she hit you? What did you say that was so wrong?’
‘That’s what I’d like to know! It was only to do with Master Bao marrying Miss
Chai!’
The words struck Dai-yu’s ears like a clap of thunder. Her heart started thumping
fiercely. She tried to calm her?self for a moment, and told the maid to come with her.
The maid followed her to the secluded corner of the gar?den, where the Flower
Burial Mound was situated. Here Dai-yu asked her:
‘Why should she hit you for mentioning Master Bao’s marriage to Miss Chai?’
‘Her Old Ladyship, Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian,’ re?plied Simple, ‘have decided that
as the Master is leaving soon, they are going to arrange with Mrs Xue to marry
Master Bao and Miss Chai as uickly as possible. They want the wedding to turn his
luck, and then...’
Her voice tailed off. She stared at Dai-yu, laughed and continued:
‘Then, as soon as those two are married, they are going to find a husband for you,
Miss Lin.’
Dai-yu was speechless with horror. The maid went on regardless:
‘But how was I to know that they’d decided to keep it quiet, for fear of
embarrassing Miss Chai? All I did was say to Aroma, that serves in Master Bao’s room:
"Won’t it be a fine to-do here soon, when Miss Chai comes over, or Mrs Bao... what
will we have to call her?” That’s all I said. What was there in that to hurt sister Pearl?
Can you see, Miss Lin? She came across and hit me straight in the face and said I was
talking rubbish and disobeying orders, and would be dismissed from service! How
was I to know their Ladyships didn’t want us to mention it? Nobody told me, and she
just hit me!’
She started sobbing again. Dai-yu’s heart felt as though oil, soy-sauce, sugar and
vinegar had all been poured into it at once. She could not tell which flavour
predominated, the sweet, the sour, the bitter or the salty. After a few moments’
silence, she said in a trembling voice:
‘Don’t talk such rubbish. Any more of that, and you’ll be beaten again. Off you go!’
She herself turned back in the direction of the Naiad’s House. Her body felt as though
it weighed a hundred tons, her feet were as wobbly as if she were walking on
cotton-floss. She could only manage one step at a time. After an age, she still had not
reached the bank by Drench?ed Blossoms Bridge. She was going so slowly, with her
feet about to collapse beneath her, and in her giddiness and confusion had wandered
off course and increased the distance by about a hundred yards. She reached
Drenched Blossoms Bridge only to start drifting back again along the bank in the
direction she had just come from, quite unaware of what she was doing.
Nightingale had by now returned with the handker?chief, but could not find Dai-yu
anywhere. She finally saw her, pale as snow, tottering along, her eyes staring straight
in front of her, meandering in circles. Nightingale also caught sight of a maid
disappearing in the distance beyond Dai-yu, but could not make out who it was. She
was most bewildered, and quickened her step.
‘Why are you turning back again, Miss?’ she asked soft?ly. ‘Where are you heading
for?’
Dai-yu only heard the blurred outline of this question. She replied:
‘I want to ask Bao-yu something.’
Nightingale could not fathom what was going on, and could only try to guide her on
her way to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. When they came to the entrance, Dai-yu
seemed to feel clearer in mind. She turned, saw Nighting?ale supporting her, stopped
for a moment, and asked:
‘What are you doing here?’
‘I went to fetch your handkerchief,’ replied Nightingale, smiling anxiously. ‘I saw you
over by the bridge and hurried across. I asked you where you were going, but you
took no notice.’
‘Oh!’ said Dai-yu with a smile. ‘I thought you had come to see Bao-yu. What else
did we come here for?’
Nightingale could see that her mind was utterly con?fused. She guessed that it was
something that the maid had said in the garden, and only nodded with a faint smile
in reply to Dai-yu’s question. But to herself she was trying to imagine what sort of an
encounter this was going to be, between the young master who had already lost his
wits, and her young mistress who was now herself a little touched. Despite her
apprehensions, she dared not pre?vent the meeting, and helped Dai-yu into the
room. The funny thing was that Dai-yu now seemed to have recov?ered her strength.
She did not wait for Nightingale but raised the portiere herself, and walked into the
room. It was very quiet inside. Grandmother Jia had retired for her afternoon nap.
Some of the maids had sneaked off to play, some were having forty winks themselves
and others had gone to wait on Grandmother Jia in her bedroom. It was Aroma who
came out to see who was there, when she heard the swish of the portiere. Seeing
that it was Dai-yu, she greeted her politely:
‘Please come in and sit down, Miss.’
‘Is Master Bao at home?’ asked Dai-yu with a smile.
Aroma did not know that anything was amiss, and was about to answer, when she
saw Nightingale make an ur?gent movement with her lip from behind Dai-yu’s back,
pointing to her mistress and making a warning gesture with her hand. Aroma had no
idea what she meant and dared not ask. Undeterred, Dai-yu walked on into Bao?yu’s
room. He was sitting up in bed, and when she came in made no move to get up or
welcome her, but remained where he was, staring at her and giving a series of silly
laughs. Dai-yu sat down uninvited, and she too began to smile and stare back at
Bao-yu. There were no greetings exchanged, no courtesies, in fact no words of any
kind. They just sat there staring into each other’s faces and smil?ing like a pair of
half-wits. Aroma stood watching, com?pletely at a loss.
Suddenly Dai-yu said:
‘Bao-yu, why are you sick?’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘I’m sick because of Miss Lin.’
Aroma and Nightingale grew pale with fright. They tried to change the subject, but
their efforts only met with silence and more senseless smiles. By now it was clear to
Aroma that Dai-yu’s mind was as disturbed as Bao-?yu’s.
‘Miss Lin has only just recovered from her illness,’ she whispered to Nightingale. ‘I’ll
ask Ripple to help you take her back. She should go home and lie down.’ Turning to
Ripple, she said: ‘Go with Nightingale and accompany Miss Lin home. And no stupid
chattering on the way, mind.’
Ripple smiled, and without a word came over to help Nightingale. The two of them
began to help Dai-yu to her feet. Dai-yu stood up at once, unassisted, still staring
fixedly at Bao-yu, smiling and nodding her head.
‘Come on, Miss!’ urged Nightingale. ‘It’s time to go home and rest.’
‘Of course!’ exclaimed Dai-yu. ‘It’s time!’
She turned to go. Still smiling and refusing any assis?tance. from the maids, she
strode out at twice her normal speed. Ripple and Nightingale hurried after her. On
leav?ing Grandmother Jia’s apartment, Dai-yu kept on walk?ing, in quite the wrong
direction. Nightingale hurried up to her and took her by the hand.
‘This is the way, Miss.’
Still smiling, Dai-yu allowed herself to be led, and fol?lowed Nightingale towards the
Naiad’s House. When they were nearly there, Nightingale exclaimed:
‘Lord Buddha be praised! Home at last!’
She had no sooner uttered these words when she saw Dai-yu stumble forwards onto
the ground, and give a loud cry. A stream of blood came gushing from her mouth.
To learn if she survived this crisis, please read the next chapter.

CHAPTER 97

Lin Dai-yu burns her poems
to signal the end of her heart’s folly
And Xue Bao-chai leaves home
to take part in a solemn rite




We have seen how Dai-yu, on reaching the entrance of the Naiad’s House, and on
hearing Nightingale’s cry of relief, slumped forward, vomited blood and almost
fainted. Luckily Nightingale and Ripple were both at hand to assist her into the house.
When Ripple left, Nightingale and Snowgoose stood by Dai-yu’s bedside and watched
her gradually come round.
‘Why are you two standing round me crying?’ asked Dai-yu, and Nightingale,
greatly reassured to hear her talk?ing sense again, replied:
‘On your way back from Her Old Ladyship’s,’ Miss, you had quite a nasty turn. We
were scared and did not know what to do. That’s why we were crying.’
‘I am not going to die yet!’ said Dai-yu, with a bitter smile. But before she could
even finish this sentence, she was doubled up and gasping for breath once more.
When she had learned earlier that day that Bao-yu and Bao-chai were to be married,
the shock of knowing that what she had feared for so long was now about to come
true, had thrown her into such a turmoil that at first she had quite taken leave of her
senses. Now that she had brought up the blood, her mind gradually became clearer.
Though at first she could remember nothing, when she saw Nightingale crying,
Simple’s words slowly came back to her. This time she did not succumb to her
emotions, but set her heart instead on a speedy death and final settle?ment of her
debt with fate.
Nightingale and Snowgoose could only stand by helplessly. They would have gone to
inform the ladies, but were afraid of a repetition of the last occasion, when Xi?feng
had rebuked them for creating a false alarm. Ripple had already given all away,
however, by the look of hor?ror on her face when she returned to Grandmother Jia’s
apartment. The old lady, who had just risen from her midday nap, asked her what the
matter was, and in her shocked state Ripple told her all that she had just witnessed.
‘What a terrible thing!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia, aghast. She sent for Lady Wang
and Xi-feng at once, and told them both the news.
‘But I gave instructions to everyone to observe strict secrecy,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Who
can have betrayed us? Now we have another problem on our hands.’
‘Never mind that for the moment,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We must first find out
how she is.’
She took Lady Wang and Xi-feng with her to visit Dai?yu, and they arrived to find her
barely conscious, breath?ing in faint little gasps, her face bloodless and white as
snow. After a while she coughed again. A maid brought the spittoon and they
watched with horror as she spat out a mouthful of blood and phlegm. Dai-yu faintly
opened her eyes, and seeing Grandmother Jia standing at her bedside, struggled to
find breath to speak.
‘Grandmother! Your love for me has been in vain.’
Grandmother Jia was most distraught.
‘There now, my dear, you must rest. There is nothing to fear.’
Dai-yu smiled faintly and closed her eyes again. A maid came in to tell Xi-feng that
the doctor had arrived. The ladies withdrew, and doctor Wang came in with Jia Lian.
He took Dai-yu’s pulses, and said:
‘As yet, there is no cause for alarm. An obstruction of morbid humours has affected
the. liver, which is unable to store the blood, and as a consequence her spirit has
been disturbed. I shall prescribe a medicine to check the Yin, and to halt the flow of
blood. I think all will be well.’
Doctor Wang left the room, accompanied by Jia Lian, to write out his prescription.
Grandmother Jia could tell that this time Dai-yu was seriously ill, and as they left the
room, she said to Lady Wang and Xi-feng:
‘I do not wish to sound gloomy or bring her bad luck, but I fear she has small hope
of recovery, poor child. You must make ready her grave-clothes and coffin. Who
knows, such preparations may even turn her luck. She may recover, which will be a
mercy for us all. But it would be sensible anyway to be prepared for the worst, and
not be taken unawares. We shall be so busy over the next few days.’
Xi-feng said she would make the necessary arrange?ments. Grandmother Jia then
questioned Nightingale, but she had no idea who it was that had upset Dai-yu. The
more she thought about it, the more it puzzled Grand?mother Jia, and she said to
Xi-feng and Lady Wang:
‘I can understand that the two of them should have grown rather fond of one
another, after growing up together and playing together as children. But now that
they are older and more mature, the time has come for them to observe a certain
distance. She must behave prop?erly, if she is to earn my love. It’s quite wrong of her
to think she can disregard such things. Then all my love will have been in vain! What
you have told me troubles me.’
She returned to her apartment and sent for Aroma again. Aroma repeated to her all
that she had told Lady Wang on the previous occasion, and in addition described the
scene earlier that day between Dai-yu and Bao-yu.
‘And yet, when I saw her just now,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘she still seemed able to
talk sense. I simply cannot understand it. Ours is a decent family. We do not tolerate
unseemly goings-on. And that applies to foolish romantic attachments. If her illness is
of a respectable nature, I do not mind how much we have to spend to get her better.
But if she is suffering from some form of lovesickness, no amount of medicine will
cure it and she can expect no further sympathy from me either.’
‘You really shouldn’t worry about Cousin Lin, Grand?mother,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Lian will
be visiting her regularly with the doctor. We must concentrate on the wedding
arrangements. Early this morning I heard that the finishing touches were being put to
the bridal courtyard. You and Aunt Wang and I should go over to Aunt Xue’s for a
final consultation. There is one thing that occurs to me, however: with Bao-chai there,
it will be rather awk?ward for us to discuss the wedding. Maybe we should ask Aunt
Xue to come over here tomorrow evening, and then we can settle everything at
once.
Grandmother J ia and Lady Wang agreed that her pro?posal was a good one, and
said:
‘It is too late today. Tomorrow after lunch, let us all go over together.’
Grandmother Jia’s dinner was now served, and Xi-feng and Lady Wang returned to
their apartments.

Next day, Xi-feng came over after breakfast. Wishing to sound out Bao-yu according
to her plan, she advanced into his room and said:
‘Congratulations, Cousin Bao! Uncle Zheng has already chosen a lucky day for your
wedding! Isn’t that good news?’
Bao-yu stared at her with a blank smile, and nodded his head faintly.
‘He is marrying you,’ went on Xi-feng, with a studied smile, ‘to your cousin Lin. Are
you happy?’
Bao-yu burst out laughing. Xi-feng watched him carely, but could not make out
whether he had understood her, or was simply raving. She went on:
‘Uncle Zheng says, you are to marry Miss Lin, if you get better. But not if you carry
on behaving like a half-wit.’
Bao-yu’s expression suddenly changed to one of utter seriousness, as he said:
‘I’m not a half-wit. You’re the half-wit.’
He stood up.
‘I am going to see Cousin Lin, to set her mind at rest.’
Xi-feng quickly put out a hand to stop him.
‘She knows already. And, as your bride-to-be, she would be much too embarrassed
to receive you now.’
‘What about when we’re married? Will she see me then?’
Xi-feng found this both comic and somewhat disturbing.
‘Aroma was right,’ she thought to herself. ‘Mention Dai-yu, and while he still talks
like an idiot, he at least seems to understand what’s going on. I can see we shall be in
real trouble, if he sees through our scheme and finds out that his bride is not to be
Dai-yu after all.’
In reply to his question, she said, suppressing a smile:
‘If you behave, she will see you. But not if you con?tinue to act like an imbecile.’
To which Bao-yu replied:
‘I have given my heart to Cousin Lin. If she marries me, she will bring it with her
and put it back in its proper place.’
Now this was madman’s talk if ever, thought Xi-feng. She left him, and walked back
into the outer room, glanc?ing with a smile in Grandmother Jia’s direction. The old
lady too found Bao-yu’s words both funny and distress?ing.
‘I heard you both myself,’ she said to Xi-feng. ‘For the present, we must ignore it.
Tell Aroma to do her best to calm him down. Come, let us go.
Lady Wang joined them, and the three ladies went across to Aunt Xue’s. On arrival
there, they pretended to be concerned about the course of Xue Pan’s affair. Aunt Xue
expressed her profound gratitude for this concern, and gave them the latest news.
After they had all taken tea, Aunt Xue was about to send for Bao-chai, when Xi?feng
stopped her, saying:
‘There is no need to tell Cousin Chai that we are here, Auntie.’
With a diplomatic smile, she continued:
‘Grandmother’s visit today is not purely a social one. She has something of
importance to say, and would like you t6 come over later so that we can all discuss it
together.’
Aunt Xue nodded.
‘Of course.’
After a little more chat, the three ladies returned.
That evening Aunt Xue came over as arranged, and after paying her respects to
Grandmother Jia, went to her sis?ter’s apartment. First there was the inevitable
scene of sisterly commiseration over Wang Zi-teng’s death. Then Aunt Xue said:
‘Just now when I was at Lady Jia’s, young Bao came out to greet’ me and seemed
quite well. A little thin perhaps, but certainly not as ill as I had been led to expect
from your description and Xi-feng’s.’
‘No, it is really not that serious,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It’s only Grandmother who will worry
so. Her idea is that it would be reassuring for Sir Zheng to see Bao-yu married before
he leaves, as who knows when he will be able to come home from his new posting.
And then from Bao-yu’s own point of view, it might be just the thing to turn his luck.
With Cousin Chai’s golden locket to counteract the evil influence, he should make a
good recovery.’
Aunt Xue was willing enough to go along with the idea, but was concerned that
Bao-chai might feel rather hard done by.
‘I see nothing against it,’ she said. ‘But I think we should all take time to think it
over properly.’
In accordance with Xi-feng’s plan, Lady Wang went on:
‘As you have no head of family present, we should like you to dispense with the
usual trousseau. Tomorrow you should send Ke to let Pan know that while we
proceed with the wedding, we shall continue to do our utmost to settle his
court-case.’
She made no mention of Bao-yu’s feelings for Dai-yu, but continued:
‘Since you have given your consent, the sooner they are married, the sooner things
will look up for everyone.’
At this point, Faithful came in to take back a report to Grandmother Jia. Though Aunt
Xue was still concerned about Bao-chai’s feelings, she saw that in the circum?stances
she had no choice, and agreed to everything they had suggested. Faithful reported
this to Grandmother Jia, who was delighted and sent her back again to ask Mrs Xue
to explain to Bao-chai why it was that things were being done in this way, so that she
would not feel unfairly treated. Aunt Xue agreed to do this, and it was settled that
Xi-feng and Jia Lian would act as official go-betweens. Xi-feng retired to her
apartment, while Aunt Xue and Lady Wang stayed up talking together well into the
night.
Next day, Aunt Xue returned to her apartment and told Bao-chai the details of the
proposal, adding:
‘I have already given my consent.’
At first Bao-chai hung her head in silence. Then she be?gan to cry. Aunt Xue said all
that she could jo comfort her, and went to great lengths to explain the reasoning
be?hind the decision. Bao-chai retired to her room, and Bao?qin went in to keep her
company and cheer her up. Aunt Xue also spoke to Ke, instructing him as follows:
‘You must leave tomorrow. Find out the latest news of Pan’s judgement, and then
convey this message to him. Return as soon as you possibly can.’
Xue Ke was away for four days, at the end of which time he returned to report to
Aunt Xue.
‘The Circuit Judge has ratified the verdict of man?slaughter, and after the next
hearing his final memorial will be presented to the Provincial Supreme Court for
confirmation. We should have the commutation money ready. As for Cousin Chai’s
affair, Cousin Pan approves entirely of your decision, Aunt. And he says that
curtail?ing the formalities will save us a lot of money too. You are not to wait for him,
but should do whatever you think best.’
Aunt Xue’s mind was greatly eased by the knowledge that Xue Pan would soon be
free to come home, and that there were now no further obstacles to the marriage.
She could see that Bao-chai was unwilling to be married in this way, but reasoned
with herself: ‘Even if this is not what she ideally wants, she is my daughter and has
always been obedient and well-bred. She knows I have agreed to it, and will not go
against my wishes.’
She instructed Xue Ke:
‘We must prepare the betrothal-card. Take some fine gold-splash paper and write
on it the Stems and Branches of Bao-chai’s birth. Then take it to Cousin Lian. Find out
which day has been fixed for the exchange of presents, and make all the necessary
preparations for sending ours. We shall not be inviting any friends or relatives to the
wed?ding. Pan’s friends are a worthless lot, as you yourself said, while our relations
consist mainly of the Jias and the Wangs. The Jias are groom’s family, and there are
no Wangs in the capital at present. When Xiang-yun was en?gaged, the Shis did not
invite us, so we need not get in touch with them. The only person I think we should
invite is our business manager, Zhang De-hui. He is an older man and experienced in
such things, and will be a; help to us.’
Xue Ke carried out these instructions, and sent a servant over with the betrothal-card.
Next day, Jia Lian came to visit Aunt Xue. After paying his respects, he said:
‘I have consulted the almanac, and tomorrow is a most propitious day. I have come
here today to propose that our two families exchange presents tomorrow. And please,
Aunt Xue, do not be too critical about the arrange?ments.’
He presented the groom’s notice, which bore the date of the wedding. Aunt Xue said
a few polite words of acceptance and nodded her assent. Jia Lian returned at once
and reported to Jia Zheng.
‘Report to your Grandmother,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘and say that as we are not inviting
anybody, the wedding should be kept very simple. She can exercise her discretion
over the presents. There is no need to consult me any fur?ther.’
Jia Lian bowed, and went in to convey this message to Grandmother Jia. Meanwhile
Lady Wang had told Xi-?feng to bring in the presents that were being given on
Bao?-yu’s behalf, for Grandmother Jia’s inspection. She also told Aroma to bring
Bao-yu in to see them. He seemed highly amused by the whole business, and said:
‘It seems such a waste of everyone’s time, to send all these things from here to the
Garden, and then have them brought all the way back, when it’s all in the family
any?way!’
This seemed to Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia suf?ficient proof that, whatever
anyone might have said to the contrary, Bao-yu still had his wits about him, and they
said as much to each other in tones of some satisfaction. Faithful and the other
maids could not help but smile too. They brought the presents in and displayed them
one by one, describing them as they went along:
‘A gold necklace and other jewellery in gold and pre?cious stones - altogether
eighty pieces; forty bolts of dra?gon-brocade for formal wear and one hundred and
twenty bolts of silks and satins in various colours; one hundred and twenty costumes
for the four seasons of the year. They have not had time in the kitchen to prepare the
sheep and wine, so this is money in lieu.’
Grandmother Jia expressed her approval, and said softly to Xi-feng:
‘You must tell Mrs Xue not to think of this as an empty formality. In due course,
when Pan is back and she has that weight off her mind, she can have these made up
into dresses for Chai. In the meantime, we shall take care of all the bedcovers for the
wedding-day.’
‘Yes Grandmother,’ replied Xi-feng, and returned to her apartment. She sent Jia Lian
over first to Aunt Xue’s, then summoned Zhou Rui and Brightie to receive their
instructions.
‘When delivering the presents,’ she said, ‘you are not to use the main gate. Use the
little side-gate in the garden, that used to be kept open. I shall be going over myself
shortly. The side-gate has the advantage of being a long way from the Naiad’s House.
If anyone from any other apartment notices you, you are to tell them on no account
to mention it at the Naiad’s House.’
‘Yes ma’am.’
The two men departed for Aunt Xue’s apartment at the head of a contingent of
servants bearing the presents.
Bao-yu was quite taken in by all this. His new feeling of happy anticipation had
caused a general improvement in his health, though his manner of speech remained
rather eccentric at times. When the present-bearers returned, the whole thing was
accomplished without a single name being mentioned. The family and all the staff
knew, but were under orders from Xi-feng to maintain abs6lute secrecy, and no one
dared disobey.
*

Dai-yu meanwhile, for all the medicine she took, con?tinued to grow iller with every
day that passed. Nightin?gale did her utmost to raise her spirits. Our story finds her
standing once more by Dai-yu’s bedside, earnestly beseeching her:
‘Miss, now that things have come to this pass, I simply must speak my mind. We
know what it is that’s eating your heart out. But can’t you see that your fears are
groundless? Why, look at the state Bao-yu is in! How can he possibly get married,
when he’s so ill? You must ignore these silly rumours, stop fretting and let yourself
get better.’
Dai-yu gave a wraithlike smile, but said nothing. She started coughing again and
brought up a lot more blood. Nightingale and Snowgoose came closer and watched
her feebly struggling for breath. They knew that any further attempt to rally her
would be to no avail, and could do nothing but stand there watching and weeping.
Each day Nightingale went over three or four times to tell Grand?mother Jia, but
Faithful, judging the old lady’s attitude towards Dai-yu to have hardened of late,
intercepted her reports and hardly mentioned Dai-yu to her mistress. Grandmother
Jia was preoccupied with the wedding arrangements, and in the absence of any
particular news of Dai-yu, did not show a great deal of interest in the girl’s fate,
considering it sufficient that she should be receiving medical attention.
Previously, when she had been ill, Dai-yu had always received frequent visits from
everyone in the household, from Grandmother Jia down to the humblest
maidservant. But now not a single person came to see her. The only face she saw
looking down at her was that of Nightingale. She began to feel her end drawing near,
and struggled to say a few words to her:
‘Dear Nightingale! Dear sister! Closest friend! Though you were Grandmother’s
maid before you came to serve me, over the years you have become as a sister to
me...’
She had to stop for breath. Nightingale felt a pang of pity, was reduced to tears and
could say nothing. After a long silence, Dai-yu began to speak again, searching for
breath between words:
‘Dear sister! I am so uncomfortable lying down like this. Please help me up and sit
next to me.’
‘I don’t think you should sit up, Miss, in your condi?tion. You might get cold in the
draught.’
Dai-yu closed her eyes in silence. A little later she asked to sit up again. Nightingale
and Snowgoose felt they could no longer deny her request. They propped her up on
both sides with soft pillows, while Nightingale sat by her on the bed to give further
support. Dai-yu was not equal to the effort. The bed where she sat on it seemed to
dig into her, and she struggled with all her remaining strength to lift herself up and
ease the pain. She told Snowgoose to come closer.
‘My poems...’
Her voice failed, and she fought for breath again. Snow-goose guessed that she
meant the manuscripts she had been revising a few days previously, went to fetch
them and laid them on Dai-yu’s lap. Dai-yu nodded, then raised her eyes and gazed in
the direction of a chest that stood on a stand close by. Snowgoose did not know how
to inter?pret this and stood there at a loss. Dai-yu stared at her now with feverish
impatience. She began to cough again and brought up another mouthful of blood.
Snowgoose went to fetch some water, and Dai-yu rinsed her mouth and spat into the
spittoon. Nightingale wiped her lips with a handkerchief. Dai-yu took the
handkerchief from her and pointed to the chest. She tried to speak, but was again
seized with an attack of breathlessness and closed her eyes.
‘Lie down, Miss,’ said Nightingale. Dai-yu shook her head. Nightingale thought she
must want one of her hand?kerchiefs, and told Snowgoose to open the chest and
bring her a plain white silk one. Dai-yu looked at it, and drop?ped it on the bed.
Making a supreme effort, she gasped out:
‘The ones with the writing on...’
Nightingale finally realized that she meant the handker?chiefs Bao-yu had sent her,
the ones she had inscribed with her own poems. She told Snowgoose to fetch them,
and herself handed them to Dai-yu, with these words of ad vice:
‘You must lie down and rest, Miss. Don’t start wearing yourself out. You can look at
these another time, when you are feeling better.’
Dai-yu took the handkerchiefs in one hand and without even looking at them,
brought round her other hand (which cost her a great effort) and tried with all her
might to tear them in two. But she was so weak that all she could achieve was a
pathetic trembling motion. Nightin?gale knew that Bao-yu was the object of all- this
bitterness but dared not mention his name, saying instead:
‘Miss, there is no sense in working yourself up again.’
Dai-yu nodded faintly, and slipped the handkerchiefs into her sleeve.
‘Light the lamp,’ she ordered.
Snowgoose promptly obeyed. Dai-yu looked into the lamp, then closed her eyes and
sat in silence. Another fit of breathlessness. Then:
‘Make up the fire in the brazier.’
Thinking she wanted it for the extra warmth, Nightin?gale protested:
‘You should lie down, Miss, and have another cover on. And the fumes from the
brazier might be bad for you.’
Dai-yu shook her head, and Snowgoose reluctantly made up the brazier, placing it on
its stand on the floor. Dai-yu made a motion with her hand, indicating that she
wanted it moved up onto the kang. Snowgoose lifted it and placed it there,
temporarily using the floor-stand, while she went out to fetch the special stand they
used on the kang. Dai-yu, far from resting back in the warmth, now inclined her body
slightly forward - Nightingale had to support her with both hands as she did so.
Dai-yu took the handkerchiefs in one hand. Staring into the flames and nodding
thoughtfully to herself, she dropped them into the brazier. Nightingale was horrified,
but much as she would have liked to snatch them from the flames, she did not dare
move her hands and leave Dai-yu unsupported. Snowgoose was out of the room,
fetching the brazier-stand, and by now the handkerchiefs were all ablaze.
‘Miss!’ cried Nightingale. ‘What are you doing?’
As if she had not heard, Dai-yu reached over for her manuscripts, glanced at them
and let them fall again onto the kang. Nightingale, anxious lest she burn these too,
leaned up against Dai-yu and freeing one hand, reached out with it to take hold of
them. But before she could do so, Dai-yu had picked them up again and dropped
them in the flames. The brazier was out of Nightingale’s reach, and there was nothing
she could do but look on helplessly.
Just at that moment Snowgoose came in with the stand. She saw Dai-yu drop
something into the fire, and without knowing what it was, rushed forward to try and
save it. The manuscripts had caught at once and were already ablaze. Heedless of -
the danger to her hands, Snowgoose reached into the flames and pulled out what
she could, throwing the paper on the floor and stamping frantically on it. But the fire
had done its work, and only a few charred fragments remained.
Dai-yu closed her eyes and slumped back, almost caus?ing Nightingale to topple over
with her. Nightingale, her heart thumping in great agitation, called Snowgoose over
to help her settle Dai-yu down again. It was too late now to send for anyone. And yet,
what if Dai-yu should die during the night, and the only people there were
Snow?goose, herself and the one or two other junior maids in the Naiad’s House?
They passed a restless night. Morning came at last, and Dai-yu seemed a little more
comfortable. But after breakfast she suddenly began coughing and vomiting, and
became tense and feverish again. Nightin?gale could see that she had reached a crisis.
She called Snowgoose and the other juniors in and told them to mount watch, while
she went to report to Grandmother Jia. But when she reached Grandmother Jia’s
apartment, she found it almost deserted. Only a few old nannies and charladies were
there, keeping an eye.
‘Where is Her Old Ladyship?’ asked Nightingale.
‘We don’t know,’ came the reply in chorus.
That was very odd, thought Nightingale. She went into Bao-yu’s room and found that
too quite empty, save for a single maid who answered with the same ‘Don’t know. By
now Nightingale had more or less guessed the truth. How could they be so heartless
and so cruel? And to think that not a soul had come to visit Dai-yu during the past
few days! As the bitterness of it struck her with full force, she felt a great wave of
resentment break out within her, and turned abruptly to go.
‘I shall go and find Bao-yu, and see how he is faring! I wonder how he will manage
to brazen it out in front of me! I remember last year, when I made up that story
about Miss Lin going back to the South, he fell sick with despair. To think that now he
should be openly doing a thing like this! Men must have hearts as cold as ice or snow.
What hateful creatures they are!’
She was already at Green Delights, and found the court-yard gate ajar. All was quiet
within. Suddenly she real?ized:
‘Of course! If he is getting married, he will have a new apartment. But where?’
She was looking around her in uncertainty, when she saw Bao-yu’s page boy Inky
rush past, and called to him to stop. He came over, and with a broad smile asked:
‘What are you doing here, Miss Nightingale?’
‘I heard that Master Bao was getting married,’ replied Nightingale, ‘and I wanted to
watch some of the fun. But I can see I’ve come to the wrong place. And I don’t know
when the wedding is taking place, either.’
‘If I tell you,’ said Inky in a confidential tone, ‘you must promise not to tell
Snowgoose. We’ve been given orders not to let any of you know. The wedding’s to be
tonight. Of course it’s not being held here. The Master told Mr Lian to set aside
another apartment.’
‘What’s the matter?’ continued Inky, after a pause.
‘Nothing,’ replied Nightingale. ‘You can go now.’
Inky rushed off again. Nightingale stood there for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly
she remembered Dai-yu. She might already be dead! Her eyes filled with tears, and
clenching her teeth, she said fiercely:
‘Bao-yu! If she dies, you may think you can wash your hands of her in this callous
way: but when you are happily married, and have your heart’s desire, you needn’t
think you can look me in the face again!’
As she walked, she began to weep. She made her way, sobbing pitifully, across the
Garden. She was not far from the Naiad’s House, when she saw two junior maids
stand?ing at the gate, peeping out nervously. They saw her com?ing, and one of
them cried out:
‘There’s Miss Nightingale! At last!’
Nightingale could see that all was not well. Gesturing to them anxiously to be silent,
she hurried in, to find Dai-yu red in the face, the fire from her liver having risen
up?wards and inflamed her cheeks. This was a dangerous sign, and Nightingale called
Dai-yu’s old wet-nurse, Nan?nie Wang, to come and take a look. One glance was
enough to reduce this old woman to tears. Nightingale had turned to Nannie Wang
as an older person, who could be expected to lend them some courage in this
ex?tremity. But she turned out to be quite helpless, and only made Nightingale more
distraught than before. Sud?denly she thought of someone else she could turn to,
and sent one of the younger maids to fetch her with all speed. Her choice might
seem a strange one; but Nightingale reasoned that as a widow, Li Wan would
certainly be ex?cluded from Bao-yu’s wedding festivities. Besides she was in general
charge of affairs in the Garden, and it would be in order to ask her to come.
Li Wan was at home correcting some of Jia Lan’s poems, when the maid came
rushing frantically in and cried:
‘Mrs Zhu! Miss Lin’s dying! Everyone over there is in tears!’
Li Wan rose startled to her feet and without a word set off at once for the Naiad’s
House, followed by her maids Candida and Casta. As she walked, she wept and
lamented to herself:
‘When I think of all the times we have spent together - oh my poor cousin! So
lovely, so gifted! There is hardly another like her. Only Frost Maiden and the Goddess
of the Moon could rival her. How can she be leaving us at such a tender age, for that
distant land from whence no travellers return… And to think that because of Xi-feng’s
deceitful scheme, I have not been able to show myself at the Naiad’s House and have
done nothing to show my sisterly affection! Oh the poor, dear girl!’
She was already at the gate of the Naiad’s House. There was no sound from within.
She began to fret.
‘I must be too late! She must have died already and they are resting between their
lamentations. I wonder if her grave-clothes and coverlet are ready?’
She quickened her step and hurried on into the room. A young maid standing at the
inner doorway had already seen her, and called out:
‘Mrs Zhu is here!’
Nightingale hurried out to meet her.
‘How is she?’ asked Li Wan.
Nightingale tried to answer but all she could muster was a choked sob. Tears poured
down her cheeks like pearls from a broken, necklace, as she pointed silently to where
Dai-yu lay. Realizing With a pang what Nightingale’s piti?able condition must portend,
Li Wan asked no more, but went over at once to see for herself. Dai-yu no longer had
the strength to speak. When Li Wan said her name a few times, her eyes opened a
slit as if in recognition of the voice. But her eyelids and lips could only make a
trem?bling suggestion of a movement. Although she still breathed, it was now more
than she could manage to utter a single word, or shed a single tear.
Li Wan turned around and saw that Nightingale was no longer in the room. She asked
Snowgoose where she was, and Snowgoose replied:
‘In the outer room.
Li Wan hurried out, to find Nightingale lying on the empty bed, her face a ghastly
green, her eyes closed, tears streaming down her cheeks. Where her head lay on the
embroidered pillow, with its border of fine brocade, was a patch the size of a small
plate, wet with her tears and the copious effusions of her nose. When Li Wan called
to her, she opened her eyes slowly, and raised herself slightly on the bed.
‘Silly girl!’ Li Wan upbraided her. ‘Is this a time for tears? Fetch Miss Lin’s
grave-clothes and dress her in them. Are you going to leave it till it is too late? Would
you have her go naked from the world? Would you ruin her honour?’
This released a fresh flood of tears on Nightingale’s part. Li Wan wept herself, fretfully
wiping her eyes and patting Nightingale on the shoulder.
‘Dear girl! Look how you are upsetting me now, and making me cry. Hurry and get
her things ready. If we delay much longer, it will all be over.’
They were in this state of trepidation, when they heard footsteps outside, and
someone came running into the room in a great flurry, causing Li Wan to start back in
alarm. It was Patience. When she saw their tear-stained faces, she stopped abruptly
and stared at them aghast for a while.
‘Why aren’t you over there?’ asked Li Wan. ‘What do you want here?’
As she spoke, Steward Lin’s wife also came into the room. Patience answered:
‘Mrs Lian was worried, and sent me to see how things were. As you are here, Mrs
Zhu, I can tell her to set her mind at rest.’
Li Wan nodded. Patience went on:
‘ I should like to see Miss Lin myself.’ So saying, she walked into Dai-yu’s
bed-chamber, with tears on her cheeks. Li Wan turned to Steward Lin’s wife and said:
‘You have come just in time. Go and find your hus?band, and tell him to prepare
Miss Lin’s coffin and what?ever else is necessary. When everything has been
satisfac?torily arranged, he is to let me know. There is no need to go over to the
house.’
‘Yes, ma’am,’ replied Lin’s wife, but made no move to go.
‘Well? Is there something else?’ asked Li Wan.
‘Mrs Lian and Her Old Ladyship,’ replied the steward’s wife, ‘have decided that they
‘need Miss Nightingale in attendance over there.’
Before Li Wan could say anything, Nightingale spoke up for herself:
‘Mrs Lin, will you be so kind as to leave now? Can’t you even wait until she is dead?
We will leave her then, you need not fear. How can you be so...’
She stopped short, thinking it inadvisable to be so rude, and changing her tone
somewhat, said:
‘Besides, after waiting on a sick person, I fear we would not be fit for such an
occasion. And while Miss Lin is still alive, she may ask for me at any time.
Li Wan tried to make the peace between them.
‘The truth is,’ she said, ‘that this maid and Miss Lin have an affinity from a past life.
Snowgoose, I know, was Miss Lin’s original maid from home, but even she is not so
indispensable as Nightingale. We really cannot separate them just now.
Lin’s wife, who had been considerably put out by Nightingale’s outspoken response,
was obliged to contain herself when Li Wan came to the maid’s defence. Seeing
Nightingale reduced to floods of tears, she eyed her with a hostile smile and said:
‘I shall ignore Miss Nightingale’s rudeness. But am I to report what you have just
said to Her Old Ladyship? And am I to tell Mrs Lian?’
As she was speaking, Patience came out of Dai-yu’s bedchamber, wiping her eyes.
‘Tell Mrs Lian what.?’ she asked.
Lin’s wife told her the substance of their conversation. Patience lowered her head in
thought. After a moment, she said:
‘Why can’t you take Snowgoose?’
‘Would she do?’ asked Li Wan. Patience went up to her and whispered a few words
in her ear. Li Wan nodded, and said:
‘Well in that case, it will be just as good if we send Snowgoose.’
‘Will Miss Snowgoose do?’ Lin’s wife asked Patience. ‘Yes,’ replied Patience. ‘She
will do just as well.’ ‘Then will you please tell her to come with me straight away,’ said
Lin’s wife. ‘I shall report to Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. I shall say that you are
both responsible for the arrangement, mind. And later you can tell Mrs Lian yourself,
Miss Patience.’
‘Of course,’ replied Li Wan curtly. ‘Do you mean to say that someone as old and
experienced as you cannot even take the responsibility for a small thing like this?’
Lin’s wife smiled.
‘It is not that I can’t take the responsibility. It is just that Her Old Ladyship and Mrs
Lian have arranged every?thing and the likes of us don’t really know what’s going on.
In the circumstances, it seems only right to mention you and Miss Patience.’
Patience had already told Snowgoose to come out. Over the past few days
Snowgoose had fallen rather into dis?favour with Dai-yu, who had called her a ‘silly,
ignorant child’, and her feelings of loyalty towards her mistress had as a consequence
been rather blunted. Besides there was no question of her disobeying an order from
Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. She therefore tidied her hair quickly and made ready
to go. Patience told her to change into her smartest clothes and to go with Mrs Lin.
Patience herself stayed on and spoke for a short while with Li Wan. Before she left, Li
Wan instructed her to call in on Lin’s wife on her way and tell her that her husband
should make the necessary preparations for Dai-yu with all possible speed. This
Patience agreed to do and went on her way. As she turned a corner in the Garden,
she caught sight of Lin’s wife walking ahead of her with Snowgoose and called to her
to wait.
‘I will take Snowgoose with me. You go and tell your husband to prepare Miss Lin’s
things. I will report to Mrs Lian for you.’
‘Yes, Miss Patience,’ said Lin’s wife, and went on her errand.
Patience then took Snowgoose to the bridal apartment, and reported there herself
before going to see to her own affairs.
*

When Snowgoose saw the wedding preparations in full swing and thought of Dai-yu
lying at death’s door, she felt a pang of grief. But she dared not show her feelings in
the presence of Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng. ‘What can they want me for?’ she
wondered. ‘I must see what is go?ing on. I know Bao-yu used to be head over heels
in love with Miss Lin. And yet now he seems to have deserted her. I begin to wonder
if this illness of his is genuine or just a pretence. He may have made the whole thing
up so as to avoid upsetting Miss Lin. By pretending to lose his jade and acting like an
idiot, perhaps he thinks he can put her off, and marry Miss Chai with a clear
conscience? I must watch him closely, and see if he acts the fool when he sees me.
Surely he won’t keep up the pretence on his wedding-day?’ She slipped in and stood
spying at the inner doorway.
Now, though Bao-yu’s mind was still clouded from the loss of his jade, his sense of joy
at the prospect of mar?rying Dai-yu - in his eyes the most blessed, the most
wonderful thing that had happened in heaven or earth since time began - had caused
a temporary resurgence of physical well-being, if not a full restoration of his mental
faculties. Xi-feng’s ingenious plan had had exactly the in?tended effect, and he was
now counting the minutes till he should see Dai-yu. Today was the day when all his
dreams were to come true, and he was filled with a feeling of ecstasy. He still
occasionally let slip some tell-tale imbecile remark, but in other respects gave the
appearance of hav?ing completely recovered. All this Snowgoose observed, and was
filled with hatred for him and grief for her mis?tress. She knew nothing of the true
cause of his joy:

While Snowgoose slipped away unobserved, Bao-yu told Aroma to hurry and dress
him in his bridegroom’s finery. He sat in Lady Wang’s chamber, watching Xi-feng and
You-shi bustling about their preparations, himself bursting with impatience for the
great moment.
‘If Cousin Lin is coming from the Garden,’ he asked Aroma, ‘why all this fuss? Why
isn’t she here yet?’
Suppressing a smile, Aroma replied:
‘She has to wait for the propitious moment.’ Xi-feng turned to Lady Wang and said:
‘Because we are in mourning, we cannot have music in the street. But the
traditional ceremony would seem so drab without any music at all, so I have told
some of the women-servants with a bit of musical knowledge, the ones who used to
look after the actresses, to come and play a little, to add a bit of a festive touch.’
Lady Wang nodded, and said she thought this a good idea. Presently the great bridal
palanquin was born in through the main gate. The little ensemble of women-servants
played, as it entered down an avenue of twelve pairs of palace-lanterns, creating a
passably stylish im?pression. The Master of Ceremonies requested the bride to step
out of her palanquin, and Bao-yu saw the Matron of Honour, all in red, lead out his
bride, her face con?cealed by the bridal veil. There was a maid in attendance, and
Bao-yu saw to his surprise that it was Snowgoose. This puzzled him for a moment.
‘Why Snowgoose, and not Nightingale?’ he asked him?self. Then: ‘Of course.
Snowgoose is Dai-yu’s original maid from the South, whereas Nightingale was one of
our maids, which would never do.’
And so, when he saw Snowgoose, it was as if he had seen the face of Dai-yu herself
beneath the veil.
The Master of Ceremonies chanted the liturgy, and the bride and groom knelt before
Heaven and Earth. Grand?mother Jia was called forth to receive their obeisances, as
were Sir Zheng, Lady Wang and other elders of the fam?ily, after which they escorted
the’ couple into the hall and thence to the bridal chamber. Here they were made to
sit on the bridal bed, were showered with dried fruit and subjected to the various
other practices customary in old Nanking families such as the Jias, which we need not
de?scribe in detail here.
Jia Zheng, it will be remembered, had gone along with the plan grudgingly, in
deference to Grandmother’ Jia’s wishes, retaining grave though unspoken doubts
himself as to her theory of Bao-yu’s luck’. But today, seeing Bao-yu bear himself with
a semblance of dignity, he could not help but be pleased.
The bride was now sitting alone on the bridal bed, and the moment had come for the
groom to remove her veil. Xi-feng had made her preparations for this event, and now
asked Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and others of the ladies present to step forward
into the bridal chamber to assist her. The sense of climax seemed to cause Bao-yu to
revert somewhat to his imbecile ways, for as he approached his bride he said:
‘Are you better now, coz? It’s such a long time since we last saw each other. What
do you want to go wrapping yourself up in that silly thing for?’
He was about to raise the veil. Grandmother Jia broke into a cold sweat. But he
hesitated, thinking to himself:
‘I know how sensitive Cousin Lin is. I must be very careful not to offend her.’
He waited a little longer. But soon the suspense became unbearable, and he walked
up to her and lifted the veil. The Matron of Honour took it from him, while
Snow-goose melted into the background and Oriole came for?ward to take her place.
Bao-yu stared at his bride. Surely this was Bao-chai? Incredulous, with one hand
holding the lantern, he rubbed his eyes with the other and looked again. It was
Bao-chai. How pretty she looked, in her wedding-gown! He gazed at her soft skin, the
full curve of her shoulders, and her hair done up in tresses that hung from her
temples! Her eyes were moist, her lips quivered slightly. Her whole appearance had
the simple elegance of a white lily, wet with pendant dew; the maidenly blush on her
cheeks resembled apricot-blossom wreathed in mist. For a moment he stared at her
in utter astonishment. Then he noticed that Oriole was standing at her side, while
Snowgoose had quite vanished. A feeling of helpless be?wilderment seized him, and
thinking he must be dream?ing, he stood there in a motionless daze. The maids took
the lamp from him and helped him to a chair, where he sat with his eyes fixed in
front of him, still without uttering a single word. Grandmother Jia was anxious lest
this might signal the approach of another of his fits, and herself came over to rally
him, while Xi-feng and You-shi escorted Bao-chai to a chair in the inner part of the
room. Bao-chai held her head bowed and said nothing.
After a while, Bao-yu had composed himself suf?ficiently to think. He saw
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang sitting opposite him, and asked Aroma in a
whis?per:
‘Where am I? This must all be a dream.’
‘A dream? Why, it’s the happiest day of your life!’ said Aroma. ‘How can you be so
silly? Take care: Sir Zeng is outside.’
Pointing now to where Bao-chai sat, and still whisper?ing, Bao-yu asked again:
‘Who is that beautiful lady sitting over there?’
Aroma found this so comical that for a while she could say nothing, but held her
hand to her face to conceal her mirth. Finally she replied:
‘That is your bride, the new Mrs Bao-yu.’
The other maids also turned away, unable to contain their laughter.
Bao-yu: ‘Don’t be so silly! What do you mean, "Mrs Bao-yu"? Who is Mrs Bao-yu?’
Aroma: ‘Miss Chai.’
Bao-yu: ‘But what about Miss Lin?’
Aroma: ‘The Master decided you should marry Miss Chai. What’s Miss Lin got to do
with it?’
Bao-yu: ‘But I saw her just a moment ago, and Snowgoose. too. They couldn’t have
just vanished! What sort of trick is this that you’re all playing on me?’
Xi-feng came up and whispered in his ear:
‘Miss Chai is sitting over there, so please stop talking like this. If you offend her,
Grannie will be very cross with you.’
Bao-yu was now more hopelessly confused than ever.
The mysterious goings-on of that night, c6ming on top of his already precarious
mental state, had wrought him up to such a pitch of despair that all he could do was
cry - ‘I must find Cousin Lin!’ - again and again. Grandmother Jia and the other ladies
tried to comfort him but he was impervious to their efforts. Furthermore, with
Bao-chai in the room, they had to be careful what they said. Bao?yu was clearly
suffering from a severe relapse, and they now abandoned their attempts to rally him
and instead helped him to bed, while ordering several sticks of gum benzoin incense
to be lit, the heavy, sedative fumes of which soon filled the room. They all stood in
awesome hush. After a short while, the incense began to take effect and Bao-yu sank
into a heavy slumber, much to the relief of the ladies, who sat down again to await
the dawn. Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng to ask Bao-chai to lie down and rest, which
she did, fully dressed as she was, behaving as though she had heard nothing.
Jia Zheng had remained in an outer room during all of this, and so had seen nothing
to disillusion him of the reassuring impression he had received earlier on. The
fol?lowing day, as it happened, was the day selected according to the almanac for his
departure to his new post. After a short rest, he took formal leave of the festivities
and re?turned to his apartment. Grandmother Jia, too, left Bao?yu sound asleep and
returned to her apartment for a brief rest.
The next morning, Jia Zheng took leave of the ancestors in the family shrine and
came to bid his mother farewell. He bowed before her and said:
‘I, your unworthy son, am about to depart for afar. My only wish is that you should
keep warm in the cold weather and take good care of yourself. As soon as I arrive at
my post, I shall write to ask how you are. You are not to worry on my account.
Bao-yu’s marriage has now been celebrated in accordance with your wishes, and it
only remains for me to beg you to instruct him, and impart to him the wisdom of
your years.’
Grandmother Jia, for fear that Jia Zheng would worry on his journey, made no
mention of Bao-yu’s relapse but merely said:
‘There is one thing I should tell you. Although the rites were performed last night,
Bao-yu’s marriage was not properly consummated. His health would not allow it.
Custom, I know, decrees that he should see you off to?day. But in view of all the
circumstances, his earlier illness, the luck turning, his still fragile state of
convales?cence and yesterday’s exertions, I am worried that by going out he might
catch a chill. So I put it to you: if you wish him to fulfil his filial obligations by seeing
you off, then send for him at once and instruct him accordingly; but if you love him,
then spare him and let him say goodbye and make his kotow to you here.’
‘Why should I want him to see me off?’ returned Jia Zheng. ‘All I want is that from
now on he should study in earnest. That would bring me greater pleasure by far.’
Grandmother Jia was most relieved to hear this. She told Jia Zheng to be seated and
sent Faithful, after impart?ing to her various secret instructions, to fetch Bao-yu and
to bring Aroma with him. Faithful had not been away many minutes, when Bao-yu
came in and with the usual promptings, performed his duty to his father. Luckily the
sight of his father brought him, for a few moments, suf?ficient clarity to get through
the formalities without any gross lapses. Jia Zheng delivered himself of a few
exhorta?tory words, to all of which his son gave the correct replies. Then Jia Zheng
told Aroma to escort him back to his room, while he himself went to Lady Wang’s
apartment. There he earnestly enjoined Lady Wang to take charge of Bao-yu’s moral
welfare during his absence.
‘There must be none of his previous unruliness,’ he added. ‘He must now prepare
himself to enter for next year’s provincial examination.’
Lady Wang assured him that she would do her utmost, and without mentioning
anything else, at once sent a maid to escort Bao-chai into the room. Bao-chai
performed the rite proper to a newly-married bride seeing off her father-in-law, and
then remained in the room when Jia Zheng left. The other women-folk accompanied
him as far as the inner gate before turning back. Cousin Zhen and the other young
male Jias received a few words of exhorta?tion, drank a farewell toast, and, together
with a crowd of other friends and relatives, accompanied him as far as the Hostelry
of the Tearful Parting, some three or four miles beyond the city walls, where they bid
their final farewell.
But of Jia Zheng’s departure no more. Let us return to Bao-yu, who on leaving his
father, had suffered an im?mediate relapse. His mind became more and more
clouded, and he could swallow neither food nor drink. Whether or not he was to
emerge from this crisis alive will be revealed in the next chapter.

On his return from seeing his father, Bao-yu, as we have seen, regressed into a worse
state of stupor and depression than ever. He was too lacking in energy to move, and
could eat nothing, but fell straight into a heavy slumber. Once more the doctor was
called, once more he took Bao?yu’s pulses and made out a prescription, which was
admin?istered to no effect. He could not even recognize the people around him. And
yet, if helped into a sitting posi?tion, he could still pass for someone in normal health.
Pro?vided he was not called upon to do anything, there were no external symptoms
to indicate how seriously ill he was. He continued like this for several days, to the
increasing anxiety of the family, until the Ninth Day after the wed?ding, when
according to tradition the newly-married cou?ple should visit the bride’s family. If
they did not go, Aunt Xue would be most offended. But if they went with Bao-yu in
his present state, whatever were they to say? Knowing that his illness was caused by
his attachment to Dai-yu, Grandmother Jia would have liked to make a clean breast
of it and tell Aunt Xue. But she feared that this too might cause offence and ill-feeling.
It was also dif?ficult for her to be of any comfort to Bao-chai, who was in a delicate
position as a new member of the Jia family. Such comfort could only be rendered by
a visit from the girl’s mother, which would be difficult if they had already offended
her by not celebrating the Ninth Day. It must be gone through with. Grandmother Jia
imparted her views on the matter to Lady Wang and Xi-feng:
‘It is only Bao-yu’s mind that has been temporarily affected. I don’t think a little
excursion would do him any harm. We must prepare two small sedan-chairs, and
send a maid to support him. They can go through the Garden. Once the Ninth Day
has been properly celebrated, we can ask Mrs Xue to come over and comfort
Bao-chai, while we do our utmost to restore Bao-yu to health. They will both benefit.’
Lady Wang agreed and immediately began making the necessary preparations.
Bao-chai acquiesced in the charade out of a sense of conjugal duty, while Bao-yu in
his moro?nic state was easily manipulated. Bao-chai now knew the full truth, and in
her own mind blamed her mother for making a foolish decision. But now that things
had gone this far she said nothing. Aunt Xue herself, when she wit?nessed Bao-yu’s
pitiful condition, began to regret having ever given her consent, and could only bring
herself to play a perfunctory part in the proceedings.
When they returned home, Bao-yu’s condition seemed to grow worse. By the next
day he could not even sit up in bed. This deterioration continued daily, until he could
no longer swallow medicine or water. Aunt Xue was there, and she and the other
ladies in their frantic despair scoured the city for eminent physicians, without finding
one that could diagnose the illness. Finally they discov?ered, lodging in a
broken-down temple outside the city, a down-and-out practitioner by the name of Bi
Zhi-an, who diagnosed it as a case of severe emotional shock, aggravated by a failure
to dress in accordance with the sea?sons and by irregular eating habits, with
consequent accu?mulation of choler and obstruction of the humours. In short, an
internal disorder made worse by external fac?tors. He made out a prescription in
accordance with this diagnosis, which was administered that evening. At about ten
o’clock it began to take effect. Bao-yu began to show signs of consciousness and
asked for water to drink. Grand?mother Jia, Lady Wang and all the other ladies
congre?gated round the sick-bed felt that they could at last have a brief respite from
their vigil, and Aunt Xue was invited to bring Bao-chai with her to Grandmother Jia’s
apartment to rest for a while.
His brief access of clarity enabled Bao-yu to understand the gravity of his illness.
When the others had gone and he was left alone with Aroma, he called her over to
his side and taking her by the hand said tearfully:
‘Please tell me how Cousin Chai came to be here? I re?member Father marrying me
to Cousin. Lin. Why has she been made to go? Why has Cousin Chai taken her place?
She has no right to be here! I’d like to tell her so, but I don’t want to offend her. How
has Cousin Lin taken it? Is she very upset?’
Aroma did not dare tell him the truth, but merely said:
‘Miss Lin is ill.’
‘I must go and see her,’ insisted Bao-yu. He wanted to get up, but days of going
without food and drink had so sapped his strength- that he could no longer move,
but could only weep bitterly and say:
‘I know I am going to die! There’s something on my mind, something very
important, that I want. you to tell Grannie for me. Cousin Lin and I are both ill. We
are both dying. It will be too late to help us when we are dead; but if they prepare a
room for us now and if we are taken there before it is too late, we can at least be
cared for together while we are still alive, and be laid out together when we die. Do
this for me, for friendship’s sake!’
Aroma found this plea at once disturbing, comical and moving. Bao-chai, who
happened to be passing with Oriole, heard every word and took him to task straight
away.
‘Instead of resting and trying to get well, you make yourself iller with all this gloomy
talk! Grandmother has scarcely stopped worrying about you for a moment, and here
you are causing more trouble for her. She is over eighty now and may not live to
acquire a title because of your achievements; but at least, by leading a good life, you
can repay her a little for all that she has suffered for your sake. And I hardly need
mention the agonies Mother has endured in bringing you up. You are the only son
she has left. If you were to die, think how she would suffer! As for me, I am wretched
enough as it is; you don’t need to make a widow of me. Three good reasons why
even if you want to die, the powers above will not let you and you will not be able to.
After four or five days of proper rest and care, your illness will pass, your strength will
be restored and you will be yourself again.’
For a while Bao-yu could think of no reply to this homily. Finally he gave a silly laugh
and said:
‘After not speaking to me for so long, here you are lecturing me. You are wasting
your breath.’
Encouraged by this response to go a step further, Bao?-chai said:
‘Let me tell you the plain truth, then. Some days ago, while you were unconscious,
Cousin Lin passed away.’
With a sudden movement, Bao-yu sat up and cried out in horror:
‘It can’t be true!’
‘It is. Would I lie about such a thing? Grandmother and Mother knew how fond you
were of each other, and wouldn’t tell you because they were afraid that if they did,
you would die too.’
Bao-yu began howling unrestrainedly and slumped back in his bed. Suddenly all was
pitch black before his eyes. He could not tell where he was and was beginning to feel
very lost, when he thought he saw a man walking towards him and asked in a
bewildered tone of voice:
‘Would you be so kind as to tell me where I am?’
‘This,’ replied the stranger, ‘is the road to the Springs of the Nether World. Your
time is not yet come. What brings you here?’
‘I have just learned of the death of a friend and have come to find her. But I seem
to have lost my way.’
‘Who is this friend of yours?’
‘Lin Dai-yu of Soochow.’
The man gave a chilling smile:
‘In life Lin Dai-yu was no ordinary mortal, and in death she has become no ordinary
shade. An ordinary mortal has two souls which coalesce at birth to vitalize the
physi?cal frame, and disperse at death to rejoin the cosmic flux. If you consider the
impossibility of tracing even such ordin?ary human entities in the Nether World, you
will realize what a futile task it is to look for Lin Dai-yu. You had better return at once.
After standing for a moment lost in thought, Bao-yu asked again:
‘But if as you say, death is a dispersion, how can there be such a place as the
Nether World?’
‘There is,’ replied the man with a superior smile, ‘and yet there is not, such a place.
It is a teaching, devised to warn mankind in its blind attachment to the idea of life
and death. The Supreme Wrath is aroused by human folly in all forms - whether it be
excessive ambition, premature death self-sought, or futile self-destruction through
de?bauchery and a life of overweening violence. Hell is the place where souls such as
these are imprisoned and made to suffer countless torments in expiation of their-
sins. This search of yours for Lin Dai-yu is a case of futile self-delusion. Dai-yu has
already returned to the Land of Illu?sion and if you really want to find her you must
cultivate your mind and strengthen your spiritual nature. Then one day you will see
her again. But if you throw your life away, you will be guilty of premature death
self-sought and will be confined to Hell. And then, although you may be allowed to
see your parents, you will certainly never see Dai-yu again.’
When he had finished speaking, the man took a stone from within his sleeve and
threw it at Bao-yu’s chest. The words he had~ spoken and the impact of the stone as
it-landed on his chest combined to give Bao-yu such a fright that he would have
returned home at once, if he had only know which way to turn. In his confusion he
suddenly heard a voice, and turning, saw the figures of Grand?mother Jia, Lady Wang,
Bao-chai, Aroma and his other maids standing in a circle around him, weeping and
calling his name. He was lying on his own bed. The red lamp was on the table. The
moon was shining brilliantly through the window. He was back among the elegant
comforts of his own home. A moment’s reflection told him that what he had just
experienced had been a dream. He was in a cold sweat. Though his mind felt
strangely lucid, thinking only intensified his feeling of helpless desolation, and he
uttered several profound sighs.
Bao-chai had known of Dai-yu’s death for several days. While Grandmother Jia had
forbidden the maids to tell him for fear of further complicating his illness, she felt she
knew better. Aware that it was Dai-yu who lay at the root of his illness and that the
loss of his jade was only a secon?dary factor, she took the opportunity of breaking
the news of her death to him in this abrupt manner, hoping that by severing his
attachment once and for all she would enable- his sanity and health to be restored.
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and company were not aware of her in?tentions and at
first reproached her for her lack of caution. But when they saw Bao-yu regain
consciousness; they were all greatly relieved and went at once to the library to ask
doctor Bi to come in and examine his patient again. The doctor carefully took his
pulses.
‘How odd!’ he exclaimed. ‘His pulses are deep and still, his spirit calm, the
oppression quite dispersed. Tomor?row he must take a regulative draught, which I
shall prescribe, and he should make a prompt and complete recovery.’
The doctor left and the ladies all returned to their apart?ments in much improved
spirits.
Although at first Aroma greatly resented the way in which Bao-chai had broken the
news, she did not dare say so. Oriole, on the other hand, reproved her mistress in
private for having been, as she put it, too hasty.
‘What do you know about such things?’ retorted Bao-?chai. ‘Leave this to me. I
take full responsibility.’
Bao-chai ignored the opinions and criticisms of those around her and continued to
keep a close watch on Bao?yu’s progress, probing him judiciously, like an
acupun?turist with a needle.
A day or two later, he began to feel a slight improve?ment in himself, though his
mental equilibrium was still easily disturbed by the least thought of Dai-yu. Aroma
was constantly at his side, with such words of consolation as:
‘The Master chose Miss Chai as your bride for her more dependable nature. He
thought Miss Lin too difficult and temperamental for you, and besides there was
always the fear that she would not live long. Then later Her Old Ladyship thought you
were not in a fit state to know what was best for you and would only be upset and
make your?self iller if you knew the truth, so she made Snowgoose come over, to try
and make things easier for you.’
This did nothing to lessen his grief, and he often wept inconsolably. But each time he
thought of putting an end to his life, he remembered the words of the stranger in his
dream; and then he thought of the distress his death would cause his mother and
grandmother and knew that he could not tear himself away from them. He also
re?flected that Dai-yu was dead, and that Bao-chai was a fine lady in her-- own right;
there must after all have been some truth in the bond of gold and jade. This thought
eased his mind a little. Bao-chai could see that things were improv?ing, and herself
felt calnaer as a result. Every day she scru?pulously performed her duties towards
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, and when these were completed, did all she could
to cure Bao-yu of his grief. He was still not able to sit up for long periods, but often
when he saw her sit?ting by his bedside he would succumb to his old weakness for
the fairer sex. She tried to rally him in an earnest man?ner, saying:
‘The important thing is to take care of your health. Now that we are married, we
have a whole lifetime ahead of us.
He was reluctant to listen to her advice. But since his grandmother, his mother, Aunt
Xue and all the others took it in turns to watch over him during the day, and since
Bao-chai slept on her own in an adjoining room, and he was waited on at night by
one or two maids of Grand?mother Jia’s, he found himself left with little choice but
to rest and get well again. And as time went by and Bao-chai proved herself a gentle
and devoted companion, he found that a small part of his love for Dai-yu began to
trans?fer itself to her. But this belongs to a later part of our story.
*

Let us return to the wedding-day. Dai-yu, it will be re?membered, had lost
consciousness while it was still light, and was holding onto life by the slenderest
thread. Her weak breathing and precarious heart-beat caused Li Wan and Nightingale
to weep in despair. By evening however, she seemed easier again. She feebly opened
her~ eyes, and seemed to be asking for water or -medicine.’ Snowgoose had already
left,- and only Li Wan and Nightingale were at her bedside. Nightingale brought her a
little cup of pear-juice blended with a decoction of longans, and with a small silver
spoon fed her two or three spoonfuls of it. Dai-yu closed her eyes and rested for a
while. Conscious?ness would flicker momentarily within her, then fade away again. Li
Wan recognized this peaceful state as the last transient revival of the dying, but
thinking that the end would not come for a few hours, she returned briefly to
Sweet-rice Village to see to her own affairs.
Dai-yu opened her eyes again. Seeing no one in the room but Nightingale and her old
wet-nurse and a few other junior maids, she clutched Nightingale’s hand and said
with a great effort:
‘I am finished! After the years you have spent seeing to my every need, I had hoped
the two of us could always be together. But now...’
She broke off, panting for breath, closed her eyes and lay still, gripping Nightingale’s
hand tightly. Nightingale did not dare to move. She had thought that Dai-yu seemed
so much better, had even hoped she might pull through after all; but these words
sent a chill down her spine. After a long pause, Dai-yu spoke again:
‘Sister Nightingale! I have no family of my own here. My body is pure: promise me
you’ll ask them to bury me at home!’
She closed her eyes again and was silent. Her grip tight?ened still further around
Nightingale’s hand, and she was seized with another paroxysm of breathlessness.
When she could breathe again, her outward breaths became longer, her inward
breaths shorter and more feeble. They quickened at a rate that caused Nightingale
great alarm, and she sent at once for Li Wan. Tan-chun happened to arrive at that
very moment. Nightingale said to her in an urgent whisper:
‘Miss! Come and look at Miss Lin!’ As she spoke, her tears fell like drops of rain.
Tan-chun came over and felt Dai-yu’s hand. It was already cold, and her eyes were
glazed and lifeless. Tan-chun and Nightingale wept as they - gave orders for water to
be brought and for Dai-yu to be washed. Now Li Wan came hurrying in. She,
Tan?chun and Nightingale looked at each other, but were too shocked to say a word.
They began wiping Dai-yu’s face with a flannel, when suddenly she cried out in a loud
voice:
‘Bao-yu! Bao-yu! How could you...’
Her whole body broke into a cold sweat and she could say no more. They tried to
calm her down and support her. She sweated more and more profusely and became
colder by degrees. Tan-chun and Li Wan told the maids to put up her hair and dress
her in her ~ and to be quick about it. Her eyes rolled upwards. Alas!

Her fragrant soul disperses, wafted on the breeze;
Her sorrows now a dream, drifting into the night.

The moment Dai-yu breathed her last was the moment that Bao-yu took Bao-chai to
be his wife. Nightingale and Dai-yu’s other maids began to wail and lament Li Wan
and Tan-chun recalled all their past affection for her, a memory made the more
poignant by the lonely circumstances of her death, and they too shed many bitter
and heartfelt tears. The wedding chamber was a off, and the guests heard nothing of
the weeping, but from the Naiad’s House, in a brief interval of silence between their
lamentations, they heard a faint snatch of music in the distance. They strained their
ears to catch it, but it was gone. Tan-chun and Li Wan went out into the garden to
listen again, but all they could hear was the rustling of the bamboos in the wind. The
moonlight cast a wavering shadow on the wall. It was an eerie, desolate night.
Presently they sent for Steward Lin’s wife and had Dai-yu properly laid out. Maids
were set to watch the body. Early next morning they reported her death to who was
now placed in an acute dilemma: Grannie Jia and Lady Wang were both extremely
busy and distraught, Jia Zheng was about to leave, Bao-yu in a worse stupor than
ever; if she broke the bad news to them now, she was afraid for Grandmother Jia’s
and Lady Wang’s health. They were already burdened with so many worries, and
might not be equal to the shock. She decided to go to the Garden herself. When
she arrived at the Naiad’s House and went inside, she could not help but weep. She
spoke to Li Wan and Tan-chun, and learned that all the correct preparations had been
made for the laying out.
‘Good,’ she said, resuming her brisk tone of voice. ‘But I wish you had told me
earlier. I have been so worried.’
‘How could we?’ they replied. ‘Sir Zheng was just leaving.’
‘Perhaps it was considerate of you,’ said Xi-feng, on re?flection. ‘Well, I must go
back and see to the other half of this lovesick pair. I really do not know what to do for
the best. I ought to tell them today. But if I do, I am afraid it may be too much for
Grandmother.’
‘You do what you think best,’ said Li Wan.
Xi-feng nodded and hurried back. She arrived to find the doctor with Bao-yu. Hearing
him say that Bao-yu’s condition was nothing to worry about, and seeing that
Grandmothe’r Jia and Lady Wang were calmer as a con?sequence, she decided to tell
them without further delay. She broke it to them as gently as possible, in a place
where there was no chance of Bao-yu overhearing. The news had a shattering effect,
and Grandmother Jia broke down in tears.
‘I am to blame! I have brought this on her! But why did she have to be so obstinate
and foolish?’
She wanted to go to the Garden to mourn, but was torn between that and her
concern for Bao-yu. Lady Wang and the others all tried to dissuade her, containing
their own grief as best they could, and saying:
‘You shouldn’t go, Mother. You must take care of yourself.’
        Grandmother Jia submitted to their counsel, and had to content herself with
sending Lady Wang in her place.
‘Give her spirit this message from me. Tell her: “It is not because I am hard-hearted
that I have not come to bid you farewell, but because my grandson needs me. here.
You are my daughter’s child, I know. But Bao-yu is a Jia, and I cannot leave him now.
If I did and he were to die, how would I ever be able to look his father in the face
again?”’
The old lady broke down again. Lady Wang tried to console her
‘We all know how much you loved Miss Lin, Mother. But the fates have decreed her
an early death. She is dead now and there is nothing more we can do for her, except
give her the best possible funeral. That at least will be some expression of our love
for her, and will bring some peace to her departed spirit, and that of her dear
mother.’
These words brought a fresh and still more heartbroken outburst of tears from
Grandmother Jia. Xi-feng was worried that she might damage her health through
excess of grief and decided to take advantage of Bao-yu’s clouded state of mind to
create a distraction. She gave secret in?structions to one of the maids, who left the
room. Shortly afterwards another maid came in with the timely news that Bao-yu
was demanding to see his grandmother. Grand-mother Jia stopped crying at once,
and asked.
‘Gracious! Is anything the matter?’
Xi-feng smiled coaxingly.
‘Of course not, Grannie. He is probably just missing you.
Grandmother Jia immediately put a hand on Pearl’s shoulder and set off,
accompanied by Xi-feng. They were half-way to Bao-yu’s apartment, when they met
Lady Wang returning from the Naiad’s House. She gave a mm?ute account of her
mission, which Grandmother Jia found most moving. But she was intent upon visiting
Bao?yu, and had to check her tears and contain her grief.
‘Since you have been there and all is in order, I shall not go myself but leave it all to
you. It would grieve me too much to see her. I shall rely on you to do things
proper?ly.’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng replied that she was quite right to do so, and left her to
continue on her way to Bao-yu. When she saw him, she asked:
‘What did you want me for?’
He smiled wanly, and said:
‘Yesterday evening I saw Cousin Lin, and she told me she was going back to the
South. I have been thinking that there is no one here to persuade her to stay, except
you, Grannie. Will you, for my sake?’
‘Of course I will,’ replied Grandmother Jia, ‘Don’t worry.’
Aroma helped Bao-yu to lie down again, and Grand?mother Jia went into Bao-chai’s
room. This was before Bao-chai had celebrated her Ninth Day, and she still felt rather
shy in her new surroundings. When Grandmother Jia came in, she saw that the old
lady’s face was wet with tears. She served her with a cup of tea, after which
Grand?mother Jia asked her to be seated, which she did with great diffidence, sitting
by her side on the edge of the couch and saying:
‘I hear that Cousin Lin has been ill. I hope she is getting better now.’
Tears began to stream from Grandmother Jia’s eyes.
‘My child! If I tell you, you must promise not to tell Bao-yu. It is all because of your
Cousin Lin that you have been made to suffer so. But now that you are Bao-yu’s wife,
I must tell you the truth. Your Cousin Lin has been dead now for some time. She died
just at the time you were married. This present illness of Bao-yu’s is all because of her.
The three of you were neighbours at one time in the Garden, so I am sure you know
what I mean.’
The colour rose in Bao-chai’s cheeks. She began to weep too, as she thought of her
departed friend. Grand?mother Jia talked with her a little longer, and then left.
It was from this moment that Bao-chai began to rack her brains for a cure for Bao-yu.
She still felt the need to be cautious, and it was only after the Ninth Day that she
acquired the confidence to begin the course of treatment which was to prove so
efficacious. With Bao-yu’s recov?ery, it became possible for everyone to talk to him
more openly again. But although his health showed a marked daily improvement,
nothing could abate his obsessive love for Dai-yu, and he began to insist on going
over himself to weep by her corpse. Grandmother Jia forbade it, on the grounds that
he was not yet fully cured and any such ex?cursion might upset him. But cooped up
as he was in his room, his depression grew almost intolerable and he began to suffer
from his old fits again. It was finally the doctor who, in view of the psychological
nature of the illness, positively recommended the excursion, to enhance the efficacy
of his medicines and speed up the cure. Bao-yu, when he heard this, wanted to go to
the Naiad’s House at once. This time Grandmother Jia reluctantly gave her
per?mission, and told them to bring a bamboo carrying-chair and help him into it.
She and Lady Wang led the way. When they arrived and saw Dai-yu’s coffin,
Grandmother Jia nearly wept herself into a fit, and was only kept from doing so by
the repeated intervention of Xi-feng and the others present. Lady Wang wept too. Li
Wan then asked Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to retire to the inner room, which
they did, still weeping. As Bao-yu arrived, his thoughts went back to the days before
Dai-yu had fallen ill, before things had taken this turn. The sight of the familiar room
was too much for him, and he started howl?ing wildly. How close they had once been!
What a gulf death had put between them! His passionate display of grief began to
concern them all. They were afraid it might be dangerous, coming so soon after his
illness, and all tried to console him. He was already beside himself with weeping,
however, and the most they could do was: help him to lie down and rest. The others
who had accompa?nied him, including Bao-chai, all wept most bitterly.
Bao-yu, once he had sufficiently recovered mststed on seeing Nightingale and asking
her what Dai-yu’s last words had been. Nightingale had formed a most damning
opinion of him; but seeing him now so overwhelmed with grief, she softened a little
towards him. Besides Grand mother Jia and Lady Wang were there and she did not
dare to be disrespectful towards him in their presence. So she gave him a full account
of how her mistress had been taken ill again so suddenly, of how she had destroyed
the handkerchiefs and poems, and of the few words she had uttered before her
death. Bao-yu cried himself hoarse. Tan-chun now took the opportunity to mention
that just before she died Dai-yu had asked for her coffin to be taken to the South.
This set Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang weeping again. Luckily Xi-feng was at hand
with more words of consolation, and she prevailed upon them to contain their grief.
She then politely suggested that they should return to their apartments. Bao-yu
could not bring himself to leave. It was only when Grandmother Jia insisted, that he
tore himself away and returned to his apartment.
Grandmother Jia, because of her age, and the state of permanent unrest that had
prevailed in the household ever since the onset of Bao-yu’s illness, was beginning to
show signs of strain. This latest scene of grief and lamentation affected her so deeply
that she felt a feverishness and faint?ness coming on, and for all her concern for
Bao-yu she no longer felt equal to the situation, but was forced to retire to her room
and sleep. Lady Wang was if anything even more inconsolably affected, and retired
likewise, giving Suncloud instructions to help Aroma in looking after Bao?-yu, and
adding:
‘If he seems to be taking it badly again, come and tell me at once.
Bao-chai knew how strong the attachment was that bound Bao-yu to Dai-yu, but
rather than try to console him, she continued to take him to task in the same pointed
manner as before. He, anxious not to cause her any of?fence, soon put an end to his
weeping and tried to moder?ate his grief. He went to sleep, and the night passed
un?eventfully. Early next morning when they came to see how he was, he was still
weak and lacking in energy, but seemed to be over the worst. They tended him with
re?newed care, and gradually he began to recover his strength. Fortunately,
Grandmother Jia did not fall sick. It was Lady Wang on whom the shock seemed to
leave the most permanent mark.
When Aunt Xue came over to visit the convalescence, she was pleasantly surprised to
find him in much better spirits. She stayed for a few days. On one of these days,
Grandmother Jia made a point of inviting her for a talk.
‘We owe Bao-yu’s life to you,’ she began. ‘He is out of danger now, I think. I only
feel sorry for Bao-chai, after the way things have happened. Bao-yu has been
con?valescing for a hundred days, and is really quite fit again; and now that the
mourning period for Her Grace over, we can think of celebrating the Consummation. I
should like you to choose a lucky day in the calendar for the occasion.’
‘Your idea is an excellent one,’ returned Aunt Xue ‘But why should you ask me?
Bao-chai may not be a very clever girl, but she has a sensible nature, and
understands these things. I think you must be familiar with her dis?position. If the
two of them can live in harmony together, it will be such a relief for you, such a
comfort to my sis?ter, and it will set my mind at ease too. You must choose the day.
Will we be inviting relatives and friends to the celebrations?’
‘I think we should,’ replied Grandmother Jia. ‘After all, it is the most important
event in their lives. There have been so many problems and complications, but now
at last they all seem to have been resolved. I think we should send out invitations and
make a proper party of it. We will invite all our friends and relations. It will be a way
of giving thanks, and besides, I feel that I deserve a bit of fun too, as a little reward
for all the heartache this has caused me.’
Aunt Xue was very pleased. She went on to talk of her plans for preparing Bao-chai’s
trousseau. Grandmother Jia protested:
‘As this is all within the family, there is no need for you to go to such trouble. They
already have all the furniture they need. By all means bring some of Bao-chai’s
favourite things. But please don’t bother with anything else. Yes, Bao-chai is such a
calm, understanding girl, not at all like my poor granddaughter, whose over-sensitive
nature was the cause of her death at such a tender age.’
Aunt Xue now began to cry too. Luckily Xi-feng came in at this moment, and inquired
with a smile:
‘Grandmother, Auntie, what is troubling you?’
‘We were talking about Miss Lin,’ answered Aunt Xue. ‘It is so sad.’
Xi-feng smiled again.
‘You must not allow it to upset you. Listen to this - it’s a joke I have just heard.’
Grandmother Jia wiped away her tears, and managed a feeble smile.
‘Who are you going to make fun of now? Come on, we are listening. If you don’t
make us laugh, we will not let you off lightly.’
Xi-feng began gesturing with her hands, but was dou?bled up with laughter before
she could get a word out. To learn what it was she had in mind to tell them, you must
turn to the next volume.

Unscrupulous minions make use of their master’s virtue
to conceal a multitude of sins
And Jia Zheng is alarmed to read his nephew’s name
in the ‘Peking Gazette’




TO CONTINUE OUR STORY
We told in our previous volume how Xi-feng, finding Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue
somewhat cast down by the mention of Dai-yu’s death, had endeavoured to raise
their spirits with a humorous anec?dote.
‘Who else could it be,’ she finally managed to say, after much incapacitating mirth,
‘but our newly married couple!’
‘Well what about them?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
Xi-feng began mimicking again.
‘Here sits one, here stands t’other .. . One bends this-a-way, one turns that-a-way ...
One ...’
Grandmother Jia interrupted her with a loud laugh.
‘For heaven’s sake get on with the story! If we have to watch you any more, it’ll be
the death of us!’
‘Yes, do stop all this monkeying around,’ said Aunt Xue, laughing in spite of herself,
‘and get on with your story.’
Xi-feng began again:
‘Just now, I was passing through Cousin Bao-yu’s apartment when I heard the
sound of laughter coming from inside; and wondering who it could be, I took a peep
through a little hole in the paper casement. There was Cousin Chai sitting on the
edge of the kang, with Bao-yu standing in front of her, holding her sleeve and
im?ploring her: “Oh, Coz! Why won’t you speak to me? A word from you and I know I
should be completely cured!” But she turned away and seemed bent on taking no
notice of him whatsoever. He bowed to her, and then came still closer and took hold
of her dress, which she tugged away from him at once. You know how unsteady on
his feet Bao-yu has been since his last illness well, with this tug he just tumbled right
on top of her! She flushed and cried out: “You’re worse than ever! You haven’t a
scrap of dignity!”‘
At this both Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue burst out laughing again. Xi-feng went on:
‘Then Bao stood up and grinned. “At least I tripped you into speaking to me!” he
said.’
‘My daughter certainly has her foibles,’ said Aunt Xue, with a good-humoured smile.
‘Now that they’re married there’s really nothing against a bit of harmless fun. If she
could but see her cousin Lian and you, my dear, when the two of you get started...’
Xi-feng blushed.
‘Honestly!’ she protested laughingly. ‘I tell a story to raise your spirits and you turn
it against me.’
‘Chai is quite right to behave as she does,’ put in Grandmother Jia with a chuckle. ‘I
don’t deny that marriage should be based on affection; but there should always be a
sense of proportion. I’m glad Chai sets such store by dignity, and it saddens me that
Bao-yu should still be such a silly boy - though from some of the things you tell me it
seems that he may be improving. Well - any more stories?’
‘Soon there will be no lack of them,’ replied Xi-feng. ‘When their marriage is
consummated, and Bao-yu presents his mother-in-law with a grandchild...’
‘You monkey!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘Thinking of your Cousin Lin’s death
made us both feel sad, and it was thoughtful of you to want to cheer us up. But now
you’re going too far. Would you have us forget her altogether? You’d better watch
your step. She was never very fond of you while she was alive, and you’d be well
advised not to go walking in the Garden alone after this, or her ghost may pounce on
you and try to take its revenge!’
‘But she never bore a grudge against me,’ countered Xi-feng with a smile. ‘It was
Bao-yu she cursed with her dying breath.’
Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue took this to be another of her witticisms, and ignored
it:
‘Don’t talk such nonsense. Now off you go and find someone to choose a lucky day
for your cousin Bao’s party.’
‘Yes, Grannie.’ After a little more chat Xi-feng went on her way. She despatched one
of the servants to consult the almanac; and on the chosen day, the family duly
celebrated the (formal if not actual) ‘consummation’ of Bao-yu and Bao-chai’s
marriage, and entertained their guests with a banquet and plays. But of this our
narrative omits further details.


﹡
It turns instead to the convalescent Bao-yu.
From time to time Bao-chai would pick up one of his books and engage him in
conversation about it, and on these occasions Bao-yu was sufficiently compos mentis
to sustain a desultory dialogue of sorts. But his mind was unquestionably duller than
it had been, a de?terioration he himself was unable to account for. Bao-chai argued
with herself that the cause lay in the loss of his Magic Jade, but Aroma was less
philosophical, and frequently took him to task:
‘Where have your wits fled to? If only it was that old weakness of yours that had
left you! But you seem to have kept that and lost your wits instead!’
Bao-yu did not let remarks such as this rile him, and responded with an inane grin. If
he ever showed signs of letting his wild streak get the better of him, he allowed
himself to be restrained by Bao-chai’s good sense, while as time went by Aroma
rebuked him less and less, and confined herself instead to ministering to his practical
needs. His other maids had always respected Bao-chai’s quiet, demure manner, and
now that she was their mistress her gentle and friendly nature won their willing
obedience.
Beneath this apparent calm, Bao-yu continued to feel a deep sense of restlessness,
and in particular a recurring desire to visit the Garden. Grandmother Jia and the
other ladies were afraid that such an ex?pedition might expose him to a chill or fever
of some kind, and that the Garden’s surroundings would have too gloomy and
depressing an effect on his spirits. Dai-yu’s coffin was already lodged in a temple
outside the city walls, but the Naiad’s House and the memories associated with it
would be sure to cause him renewed distress and bring on a relapse. So they forbade
him to go. Most of the Garden was now deserted. Of Bao-yu’s cousins, Bao-qin had
already moved out to live with Aunt Xue, while Shi Xiang-yun had gone home on her
uncle’s return to the capital, and seldom visited the Jias now that the date of her own
wedding had been settled. She had been present on Bao-yu’s wedding-day and more
recently on the day of the party, but on both occasions she had stayed with
Grandmother Jia; and her awareness that Bao-yu was now a married man, and she
herself betrothed, had inhibited her from indulging in any of her old high-spirited
banter. When she saw the newly wed couple, she talked to Bao-chai but scarcely said
more than a polite ‘hello’ to Bao-yu. Xing Xiu-yan had moved in with her aunt Lady
Xing after Ying-chun’s marriage, while the two Li sisters only ever visited the Garden
with their mother, and then would stay for a couple of days with Li Wan before
returning home. The Only Garden residents proper were now Li Wan, Tan-chun and
Xi-chun. Grandmother Jia had wanted the three of them to move in with her, but
with Yuan-chun’s death and all the subsequent family excitements of one kind or
another, she had not been able to find time to make the necessary arrangements;
and now the weather was growing warmer daily and the Garden was beginning to
seem less dreary, so she decided to leave things as they were until the autumn. But
we anticipate.

*

Jia Zheng had set off for his new provincial posting, travelling by day and resting by
night, accompanied by the various aides and secretaries he had engaged before his
departure. On his arrival at the provincial capital, he reported to his superiors and
immediately pro?ceeded to his new yamen to take ceremonial possession of the
official seal and to assume office. His first administrative action was to take stock of
the grain lying in all the granaries of the sub-prefectures and shires under his
jurisdiction.
Jia Zheng’s previous experience as an official had been mainly in the capital, and had
been restricted moreover to the theoretical aspects of the metropolitan bureaucracy.
His one provincial appointment had been as an Examiner, and his responsibilities
then were of a purely academic nature. He therefore had no first-hand knowledge of
the practicalities of provincial administration, let alone of the forms of corruption
widely tolerated - the cuts taken by middlemen, or the extortion practised on the
ignorant peasantry, to mention but two. He knew of such things in theory only, as
evils to be avoided, and was adamant that his would be an incorruptible
administration. On arrival he consulted with his private secretaries and issued a
public notice strictly forbidding malpractice of any kind, and announcing that any
instance of it would be investigated and reported to the authorities.
At first the locally employed clerks were overawed and tried their utmost to
ingratiate themselves with the new incumbent, only to discover that the man they
were dealing with was totally inflexible. As for Jia Zheng’s family servants, they, after
years of unprofitable service in the capital, had rubbed their hands with glee at the
news of their master’s provincial posting and, on the strength of their anti?cipated
profits, had borrowed money to buy clothes and equip them?selves in a manner
befitting their new station. Money would fall into the laps of a Grain Intendant’s staff.
Or so they had assumed. But now all their plans were being foiled by their master’s
blind insistence on enforcing the regulations to the last letter and by his obstinate
refusal to accept a single one of the bribes offered by the sub-prefects and
magistrates.
The porter, head clerk and other local staff in the yamen made a few mental
calculations:
‘If this lasts another fortnight, we’ll have pawned all our clothes, and our creditors
will start to press for payment; what will we do then? There’s good money staring us
in the face out there, if we could only lay our hands on it!’
When these locals voiced their concern to the newly arrived staff whom Jia Zheng
had personally recruited in the capital, they met with an indignant response:
‘You haven’t staked your last penny on this venture - we’re the ones that should be
complaining, not you! We paid money to get our jobs, and here we are after more
than a month with nothing to show for it. At this rate we won’t break even. We might
as well hand in our notices tomorrow.’
Which is exactly what they did. The following day they went in a body and tendered
their resignations to a bewildered Jia Zheng, who commented somewhat naively:
‘Very well. You were free to come. You are free to return. If you find it uncongenial
here, please feel under no obligation to stay.’
This group went grumbling on their way. The family servants next held a council of
war among themselves:
‘It’s all very well for them. They’re free to go. But what about us? We can’t leave
even if we want to.’
Among these servants was a porter by the name of Li Shi (Ten), who soon took a
prominent part in the debate.
‘You chickens!’ he scoffed. ‘Don’t be so helpless! While that “contract” mob was
here I wasn’t going to say anything; but now that they’ve pushed off I don’t mind
showing you a trick or two! I’ll soon have that Master of ours eating out of the palm
of my hand! But you’ve got to back me up. Stick together, and we can all go home
with our pockets full. Of course, if you’d rather keep out of this, that’s all right by me.
I can manage. I can get the better of you lot any day!’
‘Come on, Ten old mate! We’re depending on you!’ groaned the others. ‘You know
you’re the one the Master trusts. If you won’t help us, we’re done for!’
‘All right. But you’ve got to trust me too. Don’t leave me to do all the dirty work
and bring in the money, and then turn on me and say I’ve taken more than my fair
share.’
‘No chance of that. You know we’re broke. Anything’s better than nothing.’
As they were speaking, the granary clerk came in, and asked for Mr Zhou. Ten, who
was lounging complacently in a chair with one foot propped on his other knee and
his chest puffed out, asked him what his business was with Mr Zhou. The clerk stood
to attention with his hands at his sides and smiled uneasily.
‘The new Intendant has been in office more than a month now,’ he replied, ‘but not
a single granary’s been opened to take in the tax-grain. The local magistrates have
been made to feel uncomfortable by all his stern pronouncements. They’ve been
quite put off from entering into the usual - how shall I put it? - negotiations. Now, if
the grain is not going to be taken in and delivered on time, what’s the point of your
being here at all?’
‘What a ridiculous question!’ said Ten. ‘Our Master the Intendant is a man of his
word. Of course he’ll meet his commitments. As a matter of fact he was about to
issue the Reminders a couple of days ago, but on my advice they were postponed.
Now, tell me what you really wanted to see Zhou about?’
Clerk: ‘Oh, that was it ... the Reminders. Nothing else ..’
Ten: ‘Nonsense! Don’t try to fool me with that, my lad! And don’t come sneaking in
here with any nifty little plans, or I’ll tell the Intendant to beat you and take your job
away.’
Clerk: ‘My family has served in this yamen for three generations; I’ve got a decent
position here, I manage to make an honest living. I don’t mind going by the book
until this Intendant gets promoted and moved somewhere else. I’m not like that
beggarly lot who’ve just left.’
He took formal leave of Li Ten:
‘I’d best be going now, sir.’
Ten stood up, all smiles:
‘Come on now, can’t you take a joke? No need to get rattled by a few words ..’
‘I’m not rattled. I just don’t want to say anything that might compromise you, sir.’
Ten walked over to the clerk and took him confidentially by the hand:
‘Tell me, what’s your name?’
‘Zhan Hui,(* Homophone for ‘bribery’) sir,’ replied the clerk nervously. ‘I spent
quite a few years up in the capital myself when I was a boy.’
‘Mr Zhan! Why, of course! I’ve heard of you. Come now, we’re all in this together. If
there’s something you want to talk to me about, why not drop by this evening and
we can have a nice little chat.’
‘We all know how capable you are, Mr Li,’ replied the clerk aloud, with a sigh of
relief. ‘Why, you really had me worried there for a minute!’
He left amidst general laughter.
That evening Zhan returned and he and Li were closeted together deep into the night.
The next day, when Li found some pretext to call on Jia Zheng, and hinted at some of
the ‘measures’ he had in mind, predictably he received a stern reprimand.
The following day, Jia Zheng was due to pay a formal visit in the town, and he issued
orders for his retinue to make themselves ready. A considerable interval of time
elapsed, and the gong in the inner yamen was struck three times, but still there was
no sign of anyone to beat the drum in the main hall. Someone was finally found to
perform this duty, and Jia Zheng came walking out of his private chambers with
measured stride, to find that there was only one attendant waiting for him, instead of
the usual team of runners and criers. Resolving not to pursue this dereliction for the
time being, Jia Zheng stepped into the sedan at the foot of the terrace and waited for
his chair-bearers. Another long interval elapsed before these had all assembled and
were ready to carry him out of the yamen, and the Intendant’s solemn departure was
then announced by a single feeble report from the cannon, while a grand total of two
members of the ceremonial band, a drummer and a bugler, put in a forlorn
appearance on the bandstand. Jia Zheng was now extremely annoyed.
‘Things have been in perfect order until today. What’s the meaning of this
shambles?’
His insignia-bearers, such as they were, straggled across the road in an unseemly
fashion. Jia Zheng concluded his visit as best he could, and immediately upon his
return summoned the defaulters and threatened them with a flogging. Some pleaded
that they had been unable to attend because they lacked the requisite headgear,
others that they had been forced to pawn their uniforms, while some claimed that
they had not eaten for three days and were therefore too weak for heavy carrying
duties. Jia Zheng vented his anger on them verbally, ordered a couple of them to be
flogged and left it at that.
The next day the chief cook came asking for more money, and Jia Zheng had to
provide him with some of the personal reserve he had brought with him from home.
From then on, one such incident followed another and it soon became apparent that
most departments of his provincial yamen were in total disarray. In the end he was
driven to send for Porter Li, and asked him outright:
‘What’s come over my staff? You must try to instil some sense of discipline in them.
And another thing: my reserve of cash has run out, and it will be some time before
my salary arrives from the Pro?vincial Treasurer’s office, so we shall have to send
home for extra funds.’
‘I’ve had words with the staff almost every day, sir,’ replied Li. ‘But I can’t do a thing
with them. They seem to have lost all interest in their work. Gone to pieces, sir. As for
the money, may I ask how much you will be requiring? I understand the Viceroy has a
birthday coming up in a few days’ time, and the Prefects and Circuit Intendants are
mostly giving four-figure donations. How much will you be sending, sir?’
Jia Zheng: ‘You should have told me of this earlier.’
Li: ‘With respect, sir, it’s the fault of the local mandarins. They’ve not kept you
informed. It’s because we’re new here and haven’t made any effort to get to know
them. It wouldn’t surprise me if they had an eye on your job and were even hoping
you would fail to attend the Viceroy’s birthday altogether, sir ...’
Jia Zheng: ‘That’s preposterous! I was appointed by His Majesty. I am hardly to be
relieved of my post for not attending the Viceroy’s birthday!’
Li (with a smile): ‘That’s all very well, sir. The trouble is that with the capital such a
long way off, His Majesty relies on the Viceroy for all his information. If the Viceroy
speaks ill of a person, there’s not much hope of that person being able to defend
himself, whatever the truth might he. Now I’m sure Her Old Ladyship and Their
Ladyships want to see you do well for yourself here ..
Jia Zheng began to see what he was driving at:
‘Why couldn’t you have said all this before?’
Li: ‘At first I didn’t dare, sir. Seeing that you asked me, it would have been wrong of
me not to speak up. But I’m sure what I’ve got to say is only going to make you
angry.’
Jia Zheng: ‘Not if it is reasonable. Go on.’
Li: ‘Well, sir: the truth of the matter is that the staff in a Grain Intendant’s yamen
expect to make a bit on the side. Your clerks and runners have all paid money for
their jobs. They’ve got families to look after and livings to earn. And so far as they’re
concerned, sir, since you’ve been here, all you’ve done is set the local people
grum?bling.’
Jia Zheng: ‘What do you mean? Grumbling about what?’
Li: ‘The way the locals see it is quite simple. Officials all behave like that when they
first arrive. The stricter they sound, the more certain it is that they’re on the squeeze,
trying to browbeat the mandarins working in the district. When the time comes for
the tax-grain to be collected, the yamen staff will repeat your instructions, they’ll
swear that they’re not allowed to take a penny; and it will only mean a lot of
unnecessary trouble and delay for the country people, who’d much rather have
things the old way - pay up a bit and get the whole thing over and done with as
quickly as possible. So, in short, instead of speaking well of you, they just complain
that you haven’t understood their situation.
‘Look at that smart relation of yours, sir - that Mr Jia Yu-cun you’ve always been so
friendly with. In a few years he’s done very well for himself, and all because he’s
shrewd. He’s got a good sense of what’s what in the world, he knows how to handle
his superiors and staff and how to keep everything running smoothly ...’
Jia Zheng: ‘This is ridiculous! Are you suggesting that I possess no such sense?
Harmony is one thing: but I draw the line at col?lusion!’
Li: ‘It’s only my concern for you that causes me to speak my mind, sir. If I stand by
and let you carry on like this, if I don’t even warn you and if your career is ruined as a
result, you’ll think very poorly of me.’
Jia Zheng: ‘Well: what precisely are you suggesting?’
Li: ‘My advice is to take immediate action; do the sensible thing, secure your own
interests now, while you’re in your prime and still in favour at court, and while Her
Old Ladyship still enjoys good health. Otherwise, before the year’s out, you may find
you’ve used all your own funds to cover official expenses. No one in the government
service will have the slightest sympathy for you then. No one will believe that you’re
poor. They’ll all think that you’re sitting on a secret pile of money; and if anything
goes wrong, none of them will come forward to help you. You’ll find it impossible to
clear yourself, and by then it’ll be too late to wish you’d followed my advice.’
Jia Zheng: ‘In short, what you are saying is that I must allow myself to be corrupted!
The consequences for myself of such a de?reliction of duty, even death itself, I
consider as nothing compared with the disgrace that would tarnish my family’s
honour.’
Li: ‘You’re a wise man, sir. If it’s family honour you’re bothered about, then think back
for a moment to that group of officials who got themselves into such disgrace a few
years ago; good friends of yours they were, good men, men you used to call “above
corruption”. Where’s their family honour now? But certain other relatives of yours,
men you used to call “downright rogues”, have done very well for themselves, gone
from strength to strength. What’s been their secret? They just knew how to adapt.
You’ve got to look after the common people, but you’ve got to look after the local
mandarins as well. If your ideas came into general fashion and the shire or district
man?darins were strictly forbidden to take even the tiniest squeeze, why, nothing
would ever get done in the provinces!
‘You keep things respectable on the outside, and leave all the inside work to me. I’ll
manage things so you don’t have to be personally involved. I am only trying to be
helpful, sir. It’s the least I owe you after being with you all these years.
Jia Zheng hesitated. ‘I suppose I too must look to my own sur?vival,’ he said in the
end. ‘Do whatever you must. But I will play no part in it.
He walked stiffly back into his private chambers.
Li Ten now came into his own and began to implement his plans with a vengeance.
He had soon organized, behind Jia Zheng’s back, an elaborate squeeze Operation
involving yamen staff and local mandarins. On the surface, day-to-day business in
the yamen began running smoothly again, so smoothly that Jia Zheng allowed
himself to set his mind at rest and, far from suspecting that anything was amiss, put
absolute faith in Li. Any irregularities reported to his superiors were discounted by
them in view of Jia Zheng’s record for scrupulous honesty. His private secretaries
had a shrewder idea of what was going on and tried to caution him. When he
refused to listen, some of them resigned, others decided to stay on for friendship’s sa
ke. Thus it was that the tax-grain for that year was eventually collected and shipped
to the capital without any apparent mishap.

*

One day, in one of his free moments, Jia Zheng was sitting in his study reading, when
the chief clerk sent in a letter. It bore an official seal and the superscription:

From the Commandant of Haimen and surrounding Coastal Region
To the Yamen of the Kiangsi Grain Intendant
By Express Delivery

Jia Zheng opened the envelope and examined its contents:

Honoured Sir,
Last year when duty called me to the capital, I was privileged, on the strength of our
common Nanking origin, to enjoy your hospitality on a number of occasions. At that
time you graciously favoured my suggestion that the connection between our two
families be further strengthened by a matrimonial alliance. I have since then had this
constantly in the forefront of my mind, but was reluctant to press the matter after
my transfer to maritime defence in this remote region. That circumstances should
have put such an obstacle in the way of our plans has been a source of great regret to
me. Now that the light of your noble presence illumines these southern skies,
however, that obstacle has been removed. I had been thinking to write and send you
my felicitations, when I received your letter.
From his bivouac an old soldier raises his hand in humble salute! Even on these
distant shores, I feel myself basking in the genial warmth of your benevolence.
Dare I hope for your consent if I now propose this alliance once more? My son was
favoured, I recall, with your gracious approval, and we have long anticipated the
great joy that your daughter’s charming presence would bring to our household.
If you are kind enough to confirm your acceptance, I shall despatch a go-between
without delay. Though the journey is a long one for your daughter, it can he
accomplished by boat. And though I cannot offer much in the way of pomp and
ceremony, I can at least send a suitably furnished barge to receive her.
This brief missive carries my most sincere congratulations on your new appointment.
In eager anticipation of your favourable response, believe me to be, honoured sir,
your most humble and respectful servant,
Zhou Qiong.


‘Fate seems indeed to play a decisive role in affairs of matrimony,’ reflected Jia
Zheng to himself after perusing the letter. ‘I do remember suggesting this betrothal
last year. There seemed to be several factors in its favour: Zhou was taking up an
appointment in the capital, he and I were old friends and both from Nanking families,
and his son was a good-looking enough young man. It was only a casual suggestion,
and I never mentioned it at home. Afterwards he was transferred to Maritime
Defence and the matter was dropped. And yet now an unforeseeable stroke of fate
has sent me here to the provinces, and Zhou has broached the subject once more.
Theirs seems a suitable family, and I think it would be a good match for Tan-chun. But
I am here on my own, and I shall have to write home to consult them first.’
He was still deliberating, when one of the gate-attendants came in with an official
despatch summoning him to a conference with the Viceroy, and he had to set out at
once for the Viceroy’s seat. After his arrival there, he was awaiting further
instructions and sitting in his temporary lodgings, idly leafing through a pile of Peking
Gazettes that lay on the table, when his eye was caught by a report from the Board of
Punishments:
‘In the case of Xue Pan, travelling on business, registered domicile Nanking...’
‘Good heavens!’ exclaimed Jia Zheng in some alarm. ‘Have they memorialized
already?’
He read on more carefully. The gist of the report was that Xue Pan, having killed
Zhang San ‘in an affray’, had connived with the relatives of the deceased and other
eyewitnesses to get himself off on a charge of ‘accidental homicide’. Jia Zheng
brought his hand down with a thump on the table.
‘He’s done for!’
He read the report through to the end:

The Metropolitan Govemor has forwarded the following abstract of the case:
Xue Pan of Nanking, while travelling through the town of Tal-ping, stayed at Li’s Inn.
One of the waiters employed by Gaffer Li the proprietor was a certain Zhang San,
with whom Xue was not previously acquainted. On the __ day of the __month of the
year __ , Xue Pan placed an order with the proprietor for some wine, as he had
invited Wu Liang (a native of Tai-ping) to drink with him. When his guest came, he
sent the waiter Zhang San to bring them the wine. The wine was sour, and Xue Pan
told him to replace it with something better. Zhang San argued that since that
particular wine had been ordered, it was impossible to change it. Xue Pan considered
Zhang’s behaviour insolent and raised his cup to throw the wine in his face.
Unfortunately he exerted too much force and the cup slipped from his hand just as
Zhang lowered his head to retrieve a chopstick from the ground. The cup struck
Zhang on the top of the head, there was a substantial loss of blood, and he died
shortly afterwards. Gaffer Li hurried to the scene but was too late to be of any help.
He informed Mrs Zhang, nee Wang, the deceased’s mother, who came to the inn only
to find her son already dead. She called out the beadle and brought a plaint at the
local yamen. The then acting magistrate held an inquest and the coroner completed
the usual certificate. Two crucial facts were, however, omitted: first, that the
bregmatic fracture was one and one-third inches long; and second, that Zhang had
also sustained injuries in the small of the back. The case was then sent up to the
prefectural yamen, where it was confirmed that Xue Pan had only intended to throw
the wine, that the cup had slipped from his hand, and that he had therefore
accidentally caused the death of Zhang San. He was dealt with according to the law
relating to Accidental Homicide, and permitted to pay a fine in commutation.
The Board has investigated the evidence given by the accused, by the various
eyewitnesses and by the relatives of the deceased, and has found it to be
inconsistent. It has also consulted the detailed provisions of the code relating to
homicide, wherein a fight is defined as a ‘struggle between two persons’, and an
affray as a ‘struggle in which the parties strike one another’. There must be no
evidence of such a fight or struggle if the offence is to be classified as accidental
homicide. The case was therefore handed back to the office of the Metropolitan
Governor to establish the exact facts, on the basis of which a final recommendation
for sentence could be reached.
This is the substance of the Governor’s final findings: Xue Pan was already intoxicated
when Zhang San refused to replace the wine. Seizing Zhang by the tight hand, he
struck him in the small of the back. Whereupon Zhang began to abuse Xue Pan, who
then hurled his wine cup at him, inflicting a severe wound on his skull. The bone was
fractured, causing damage to the brain and immediate death. In other words, Zhang’s
death was directly caused by the force with which Xue Pan threw the cup. Xue Pan
should therefore pay for this crime with his life. In accordance with the code relating
to Homicide by Blows, he should be kept in custody until the Assizes, and then
executed by strangulation. Wu Liang should be flogged and sentenced to penal
servitude.
The Prefectural, Shire and District Magistrates implicated in this miscar?riage of
Justice should be dealt with as follows ...

The report broke off at this point with the note ‘To be continued’.
Jia Zheng reflected that it was he who, at Aunt Xue’s request, had brought pressure
to bear on the local magistrate to reverse the verdict in Xue Pan’s case. If that
magistrate had now been cashiered, and an enquiry had been held, he could be
implicated himself. It was very worrying. He read through the next issue of the
Gazette, but there was no further mention of the case. He searched through all the
remaining issues without being able to find the conclusion of the report. He began to
feel more and more uneasy, and was deep in thought when Li Ten came in and said:
‘Will you please proceed to the yamen to attend on the Viceroy, sir? His attendants
have already beaten the drum twice.’
Jia Zheng was miles away and heard none of this. Li had to repeat himself.
‘What can I do?’ muttered Jia Zheng to himself.
‘Is something the matter, sir?’ asked Li.
Jia Zheng confided to Li his anxiety about the report in the Gazette.
‘Don’t you worry too much about that, sir,’ said Li. ‘In fact, if you ask me, Mr Xue
was quite lucky. Back in the capital I heard that he invited a lot of women along to
that very inn and that they were all there together getting drunk and causing quite a
rumpus on the very evening when he beat this waiter to death. And I heard that the
local mandarin was not the only one to do the family a favour. Apparently Mr Lian
spent a small fortune on the case, and sent bribes to every yamen concerned, to try
to get Mr Pan off. It’s funny the Board hasn’t mentioned that in its report. I suppose
in one way it’s only to be expected. Now this affair has come to light, the people
involved must all be busy covering up for each other. They’re trying to sweep the
whole thing under the carpet. They want to make it seem like a minor case of
negligence. Then the worst that can happen to them is that they’ll lose their jobs.
They’d never want to admit to bribes being taken. Much too serious. Don’t you worry
about this one, sir, I’ll get hold of the inside story. We’d best not keep the Viceroy
waiting any longer ..’.
‘You don’t understand,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It’s the local magistrate I feel sorry for. For
doing us this favour, he has forfeited his job. And that may not even be the end of it
for him.’
‘It won’t do any good worrying about him, sir,’ said Li. ‘Your attendants have been
waiting for a long time. You’d best be going in to see the Viceroy now, sir.’
To learn what it was the Viceroy wanted of Jia Zheng, please read the next chapter.
CHAPTER 100

Caltrop disturbs an elaborate seduction
and inspires bitter resentment
Bao-yu learns of a distressing betrothal
and laments an imminent departure



Jia Zheng was with the Viceroy for a long time, and outside the yamen speculation
mounted as to the reason for the summons. Li Ten, in the absence of any information,
assumed that his master was wanted in connection with this latest trouble in the
Gazette, and feared the worst. At last the interview was over, and Li hurried forward
to meet Jia Zheng and accompany him home. He was too impatient to wait until their
return, and as soon as they were alone he asked Jia Zheng:
‘What kept you so long, sir? Something of great importance, I suppose?’
Jia Zheng smiled.
‘Not really. It turns out that the Commandant of the Haimen region, who has
offered his son’s hand in marriage to my daughter, is himself related to the Viceroy,
and has written asking him to take a special interest in my well-being. The Viceroy
was most affable, and even went so far as to say to me: “Now we are related too!”
Li rejoiced inwardly, seeing in this new turn of events cause to be bolder still in his
own schemes. He encouraged Jia Zheng enthusiastic?ally to proceed with the
marriage.
Communications between Kiangsi and the capital were slow, and it was hard for Jia
Zheng to know whether or not he was personally implicated in Xue Pan’s troubles. At
such a great distance it would be difficult for him to influence the course of events in
Xue Pan’s favour. When he returned to his own yamen, he despatched a family
servant to the capital to ascertain exactly what had happened, and at the same time
to carry a message to Grandmother Jia, informing her of the marriage proposal. If she
agreed, he suggested that Tan-chun should be sent straight away to join him, in
preparation for the wedding. The servant set off with all speed for the capital. He
reported first to Lady Wang, and then went to the Board of Civil Office, where his
enquiries revealed that the only person to have suffered in the Xue Pan affair was the
acting magistrate of Tai-ping, who had lost his job, and that Jia Zheng was not in any
way im?plicated. The servant sent back a reassuring report to Jia Zheng, himself
remaining behind to await further developments.

*
It will be remembered to what lengths Aunt Xue had gone, and with what large sums
of money she had bribed the various courts involved, to bring in a verdict of
‘accidental homicide’ in the earlier stages of Xue Pan’s case. She had been proposing
to raise the money for his fine by selling the family pawnshop business. Now when
she heard of the new verdict brought by the Board of Punishments, she sent still
more bribes, but to no avail. The sentence was confirmed--death by strangulation
after the Autumn Assizes. Day and night she wept tears of grief and rage.
Bao-chai visited her several times and tried to offer consolation:
‘Brother Pan must have been born under an unlucky star, Mama! With the fortune
that Grandpa left, he should have been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. But
instead it’s been one disaster after another. First came Nanking and that disgraceful
business over Caltrop. He was entirely to blame for that poor young man’s death, and
it was just lucky for him that we still had plenty of pull and money in those days, and
were able to get him off.
‘You’d have thought a scrape like that would have been enough to make him mend
his ways. You’d have thought he might have taken life a bit more seriously after that
and devoted more time to looking after his own mother. But no, as soon as we
arrived here, it was the same story all over again. I hate to think how much you’ve
suffered on his account, Mama, how many tears you’ve shed. Then he got married,
and at last we thought life might quieten down a bit for all of us. But fate evidently
had something else in mind. Eventually that dreadful woman drove him away with
her insufferable carryings? on.
‘And even that was not the end of it. As the saying goes: “Fate moves in a narrow
lane, and collisions are hard to avoid!” It was only a few days before he was mixed up
in this new murder case! You and Cousin Ke have done everything you possibly could.
Apart from all the money you’ve spent, you’ve never stopped asking for help and
thinking of ways to get him out. You can’t go on struggling with fate. He’ll have to pay
the price for his own misdeeds.
‘Most parents look to their children for support in their old age, and even in poor
families a man will do his best to earn his mother a bowl of rice. But what has Pan
done? Squandered a ready-made fortune, and made your life a misery. I know I
shouldn’t say this, but the truth is, he’s the bane of your life, an affliction sent to test
you, not a real son to you. You refuse to accept the truth, and wear yourself out like
this, weeping at all hours of the day and night. You’ve got quite enough to cope with
already, what with Jin-gui and her tantrums. It worries me so, seeing you in this state.
I only wish I could be here with you all the time, and help keep the peace. But I can’t.
Bao-yu would never let me come back, however half?witted he may be.
‘The other day Sir Zheng sent a message home to say how shocked he was to read
the report in the Gazette. He has already sent one of his men to try to intervene on
Pan’s behalf. So you see - there are so many people trying to help Pan out of this
mess he’s made. And thank goodness I’m at least close by. I think if I were living a
long way off and heard that this had happened, I’d simply die worrying about you.
Please, Mama, give yourself a moment’s respite. Be thankful that Pan is still alive.
Use this opportunity to take stock. Ask one of the older men in the firm to find out
what we owe and what we are owed, and see exactly how much we have left.’
‘Dear girl,’ said Aunt Xue tearfully, ‘the past few days I have been so preoccupied
with your brother I simply haven’t had time to tell you of our own troubles.
Whenever you’ve come to see me it’s either been you trying to cheer me up or me
giving you the latest news from the yamen. I haven’t told you the worst. We have
been struck off the register of court purveyors. Two of our pawnshops have been
sold and we have already spent the money from the sale, while the manager of the
other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and we’re involved in another
court case over that. Your cousin Ke has been out every day trying to collect some of
the money owing to us. Our liabilities here will probably amount to several tens of
thousands of taels, and we shall have to sell our share of the Nanking joint-stock
business and some property as well, in order to meet our obligations. Two days ago I
even heard a rumour that the pawnbroking side of the Nanking business has gone
bankrupt and been closed down! If that turns out to be true, I really have come to
the end of the road!’
Aunt Xue began weeping hysterically. Ba-chai was also in tears by now, but tried to
comfort her:
‘There’s no sense in your distressing yourself about the finances, Mama. Let Cousin
Ke take care of that. Though I must say it is distressing to see our employees abandon
us and turn against us the moment we’re down on our luck. I can understand them
wanting to save their own skins; but I know that some of them are actually
encouraging outsiders to cheat us out of our money. As for Pan’s friends, it’s a waste
of time expecting any help from them. The only thing they’re any good for is parties.
The first sign of trouble and they’re of￡.
‘If you love me, Mama, please listen to my words of advice. At your age it’s time
you took more care of yourself and worried about others less. Remember, even if the
worst comes to the worst, you’ll manage somehow or other. Forget about the clothes
and furniture. Let Jin-gui have them. Not many of the servants or serving-women will
want to stay on, so you may as well let most of them go too. I feel sorry for Caltrop.
After everything she’s been through, I think you should keep her on with you. If you
ever run short of anything, I can always help out, provided we’ve got it at home. I’m
sure he wouldn’t mind. And Aroma is a decent sort of girl. She knows about our
troubles; in fact the slightest mention of your name brings tears to her eyes. He
doesn’t know that anything’s the matter, so he hasn’t been particularly worried. If he
were to learn the truth, I think the shock might be too much for him.’
‘Dear girl,’ said Aunt Xue, not waiting for her to finish, ‘whatever you do, don’t tell
him. He nearly died on account of Miss Lin. He’s a little better now. If he were to have
a sudden relapse, it would be such a trial for you! And then if you had to spend all
your time nursing him, I should be robbed of my last source of comfort.’
‘I’ve thought of that,’ replied Bao-chai. ‘That’s why I haven’t told him.’
At that very moment Xue Pan’s wife Jin-gui came running into the outer room,
screaming:
‘What’s the good of being alive? My man’s done for now anyway. It’s no use
pretending! The least we can do is march along to the execution ground and put up a
fight! We’ve got nothing to lose!’
With this she began banging her head against the wooden partition, till her hair
came undone and fell in disorder about her shoulders. Aunt Xue could only stare at
her in speechless rage, while Bao-chai tried to reason with her ‘dear sister-in-law’,
her ‘good sister-in-law’, all to no avail.
‘Dear Mrs Bao!’ retorted Jin-gui. ‘We all know how well you’ve done for yourself.
You and your dear Mr Bao will live happily ever after, I dare say! But I’m all on my
own. I’m long past caring about appearances!’
She announced her intention of returning to her mother’s, and made a dash for the
street. Luckily there were enough people present to stop her, and eventually they
managed to calm her down. Bao-qin, who was at this time still staying with Aunt Xue,
in preparation for her own wedding, was so horrified by Jin-gui’s behaviour that she
resolved to keep well out of her way from then on.
Whenever Xue Ke was at home, Jin-gui would select one of her more provocative
gowns and issue forth, her cheeks heavily powdered and rouged, her eyebrows
pencilled, her hair dressed in its most alluring style. She would contrive to walk past
his apartment, where she would give an artificial-sounding cough, or ask innocently
who was inside. If she encountered him in person, she would at once waylay him and
attempt to beguile him with seductive small-talk, simpering, pouting and purring by
turns, displaying for his benefit the full range of her feminine charms. When the
maids saw what she was up to, they beat a hasty retreat. Jin-gui carried on regardless,
intent on executing Moonbeam’s plan for the conquest of Xue Ke. He for his part
avoided her if he could, and if he could not, endea?voured to be civil, out of a fear
that she might otherwise cause worse trouble for him.
But Jin-gui’s infatuation blinded her to the truth, so that Xue Ke’s courteous manner
only fanned the flames of her desire. The one thing she could not help noticing,
however, the one detail that marred the illusion, was the way in which the object of
her passion entrusted every smallest thing of his to Caltrop. The sorting, mending
and washing of his clothes, all were given to her. And if she, Jin-gui, entered the room
while the two of them were talking, she noticed how they hurriedly went their
separate ways, as if she had intruded on some intimate tete-a’-te’te. All of this
inflamed her jealousy. She could not, however, bring herself to confront Xue Ke
directly about it, for fear that any move against Caltrop might set Xue Ke against
herself. Instead she decided to bide her time, and continued to accumu?late a deep
and bitter store of resentment towards her rival.
One day Moonbeam came into her room and tittered:
‘Mrs Pan, have you seen Master Ke?’
Jin-gui: ‘I have not.’
Moonbeam: ‘I told you he was fooling us with all that strait-laced talk of his. When
we sent him some wine, he said he didn’t drink; but just now I saw him at Mrs Xue’s,
quite tipsy and red in the face. If you don’t believe me, why, go and wait for him in
the doorway. He’ll be coming this way. Stop him and ask him. See what he says.’
Jin-gui (annoyed): ‘I’m sure he won’t be coming out just yet. Anyway, he’s such a cold
fish. Words are wasted on him.’
Moonbeam: ‘You’re just being silly again, ma’am. Why not give it a try? If he plays,
we can play too. If not, we’ll just have to think of another way.’
Perhaps she’s right after all, Jin-gui thought to herself. She posted Moonbeam
outside to keep watch for Xue Ke, and went in once more to her dressing-table. She
opened her mirror and looked herself up and down. A little more lipstick, a flowery
handkerchief, and she was ready for the fray. Or almost ready: she still felt there was
something missing, but before she could think what it was that she needed to add
that final touch, she heard Moonbeam’s voice outside:
‘You seem in high spirits today, Master Ke! Been drinking some?where, have you?’
This was her cue. Jin-gui raised the portiere and stepped out just in time to hear Xue
Ke’s reply:
‘Our manager Mr Zhang is celebrating his birthday today, and I was pressed into
drinking half a cup. My face is still burning from it.’
Before he had finished, Jin-gui moved into the attack:
‘Other people’s wine has more flavour than ours, I dare say ...’ Xue Ke felt the sting
of her remark and blushed a deeper shade of red. He took a step towards her and
said with a polite smile:
‘Of course not, sister-in-law.’
Now that the conversation was launched, Moonbeam disappeared inside and left
them to it. Jin-gui had intended to feign anger with her darling, but there was
something so appealingly boyish about the flush on his cheeks and the slightly
befuddled innocence in his eyes, that her heart melted and her feigned hostility fled
to the distant land of Java. She smiled.
‘You mean, you have to be led to water ..’
‘Precisely. I’m really no drinker.’
‘I’m glad to hear it. Better than your cousin, anyway, forever boozing his way into
trouble. At least your wife won’t be left to sleep in an empty bed ...’
She narrowed her eyes at him suggestively, and her cheeks began to glow. Xue Ke
saw serious danger ahead, and decided to make a dash for it while he still could. But
he was too slow. Jin-gui was not going to let him slip through her fingers now! In a
second she was on him and had him in her clutches.
‘Sister-in-law!’ cried Xue Ke in consternation. ‘This is most undignified!’
He was trembling all over. Jin-gui threw caution to the winds.
‘Come in here with me. There’s something important I have to tell you.

Things had reached this critical juncture when a voice behind her called:
‘Mrs Pan! It’s Caltrop. She’s coming this way!’
Jin-gui glanced wildly behind her. Moonbeam had lifted the portiere to observe the
course the interview was taking; and then when she caught sight of Caltrop coming
from the other direction, had hastened to warn Jin-gui. Jin-gui in her panic relaxed
her grip, and Xue Ke seized his chance of escape. Caltrop herself had noticed nothing
and had been walking innocently on her way until Moonbeam called out, when she
looked round and to her horror saw Jin-gui dragging Xue Ke into her boudoir. Caltrop
immediately turned about and, heart thumping, began walking back in the direc?tion
she had come from. Jin-gui stood there a while, and stared in angry dismay after the
vanishing form of Xue Ke. Then she gave a snort of exasperation and withdrew to her
apartment, smarting with thwarted desire. Caltrop, who had come through the side
gate and was making her way to Bao-qin’s when she stumbled upon them, hurried
back to her room.
Resentment towards Caltrop now festered within Jin-gui’s bosom, and the poison
worked its way into the very marrow of her being.

*
Later that same day, Bao-chai was in Grandmother Jia’s apartment, and heard Lady
Wang speaking of the betrothal Jia Zheng had proposed for Tan-chun.
‘I’m glad the boy’s from a Nanking family,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘But if he came
here once before, I can’t understand why Zheng has never mentioned it.’
‘We knew nothing about it either,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I can see advantages in the match,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The only objection is
the dreadful distance involved. I know that Zheng is posted there at present. But
supposing he is transferred later on, poor Tan will be so isolated.’
‘With official families, there’s no telling where they may be posted,’ replied Lady
Wang. ‘The boy’s father may also be recalled to the capital. Even if he isn’t, one way
or another “the falling leaf returns to the root”, as they say: they’re bound to come
home sooner or later. Besides, Zheng’s superior is in favour of the match, and it
would be very difficult for him to refuse. I think he has more or less made up his
mind already, and has only written to you for your formal approval, Mother.’
‘If you are both in favour of it,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘then well and good. It grieves
me, though, to think how long it may be before Tan is able to come back and visit us.
If it is more than a year or two, I fear I may no longer be alive to see her.’
She wept as she spoke.
‘Marriage is something that happens to every girl once she grows up,’ said Lady
Wang, ‘and even if the husband’s family is a local one, you can never be sure that the
two of them will stay in the district. He may always be posted away from home.
That’s one of the hazards of official life. The most important thing is that they should
be happy together. Take Ying-chun’s case. Her husband lives nearby. But that has not
meant happiness for her. They never seem to stop fighting, and now he won’t even
feed her properly, and forbids her to touch any of the things we send. And from what
I hear, things are getting worse. He won’t allow her to come and visit us, and when
the two of them quarrel, he pointedly reminds her that we owe his family money.
Poor child! The future looks very bleak for her. The other day I was worried on her
account and sent some of my women to call at the Sun home. Ying-chun was hiding
in a side-room and wouldn’t come out to see them. They insisted on going in, and
found her freezing to death, poor thing, with nothing on but some threadbare old
clothes. And it was a bitterly cold day! She broke down in front of them and begged
them not to reveal her miserable plight to us at home. “It’s my fate to suffer like
this,” she said. And we’re not to send her any more clothes or food or anything. They
never reach her, and her husband will only accuse her of complaining again and give
her another beating. So you see, Mother, Ying may be close at hand, but the very
closeness only makes her suffering harder for us to bear. Her mother turns a blind
eye, and her father has refused to intervene at all. She is worse off than one of our
lowest-grade maids!
‘Although Tan is not my own daughter, I’m sure Zheng wants to do the best for her.
He has obviously seen the boy and must approve of him or he wouldn’t be in favour
of the match. So I hope you’ll agree, and then we can choose a lucky day for her to
make the journey and send a proper escort to accompany her to Zheng’s official
residence. I am sure Zheng will see to it at his end that everything is done in a fitting
manner.’
‘Very well then,’ Grandmother Jia concurred. ‘I’ll go along with Zheng’s idea, and I
leave it to you to make the necessary arrange?ments. Choose a suitable day in the
almanac for travelling. There, the matter is settled now.’
‘Yes, Mother.’
Bao-chai heard all this clearly, and although she did not breathe a word of protest,
she thought to herself sadly:
‘Tan is one of the very best of us. And now she is being married as well and sent
away. One by one our numbers are dwindling.’
Seeing that Lady Wang had risen and was taking her leave, Bao?chai accompanied
her out of the room and then returned immediately to her own apartment. She said
nothing to Bao-yu of Tan-chun’s engagement, but told Aroma later, when she found
her sewing on her own. Aroma too was very unhappy at the news.
Aunt Zhao, on the other hand, was positively delighted.
‘The girl’s shown me nothing but disrespect,’ she thought to herself. ‘No one would
ever have guessed that I was her mother! I receive worse treatment at her hands
than one of her maids! She’s always trying to better herself, and sides with anyone
rather than her own mother or brother. With her in the way, Huan would never have
been able to get anywhere. If her father has sent for her, then good riddance! I’ve
given up hoping for any respect from her. I hope she’s as miserable as Ying is. I’d be
glad to see it happen.’
She hurried over to Tan-chun’s apartment to offer her ‘con?gratulations’.
‘You certainly are on your way up in the world, my dear!’ she crowed. ‘I’m sure life
at your new home will be even more to your liking than it is here. You must be
pleased. Now remember, I am your mother, for all the good it’s ever done me. So
don’t think of me as all bad. And don’t forget about me altogether when you’re
gone.’
Tan-chun refused to respond to this display of spite and kept her head bent silently
over her needlework. Aunt Zhao was effectively snubbed and left the room in a state
of high dudgeon.
Tan-chun could see the ridiculous side of her mother’s behaviour, but none the less it
left her feeling both angry and wounded, and she sat for some time weeping quietly
to herself. Eventually she walked out in a weary and dejected frame of mind, thinking
she would like to drop in on Bao-yu.
‘Tell me, Tan,’ he said, the moment she entered his apartment, ‘I know that you
were with Cousin Lin when she died, and that you heard music in the distance. Do
you think there was some unexplained mystery behind it? Do you think Cousin Lin
was really a fairy, and that at her death she was merely returning to her heavenly
abode?’
Tan-chun smiled.
‘That sounds like another of your fancies. It was a strange night, though, that’s
certainly true; and the music was unlike any that I’ve ever heard before. Who knows,
you may even be right.’
Bao-yu took this as confirmation of his hypothesis. He also recalled the words of the
man he had encountered in his strange dream of a few months before, who had said
that Dai-yu was ‘no ordinary mortal and no ordinary shade, but a visitor from some
immortal realm’. This mingled in his mind with another vivid memory, that of the
Moon Goddess in the play he had seen the previous year. The Goddess and Dai-yu
possessed the same ethereal beauty, the same otherworldly charm ... After a while,
when Tan?chun had gone, he felt a sudden and overwhelming urge to have
Nightingale close at hand, and asked Grandmother Jia to send her over to his
apartment.
Nightingale was unwilling, on this as on previous occasions, to comply with Bao-yu’s
request; but she could hardly disobey an order emanating from Grandmother Jia and
Lady Wang. Whenever she was in Bao-yu’s presence, she did nothing but sigh, in a
way that seemed to express both grief (for her mistress) and disapproval (of Bao-yu).
When they were alone together, and Bao-yu took her by the hand and asked her very
tenderly to speak to him about Dai-yu, she always refused to confide in him. Bao-chai
observed this attitude of hers, and far from being cross, commended her to others
for her loyalty to her mistress. As for Snowgoose, although it was she who had come
forward to assist at the wedding, Bao-chai thought her rather a silly sort of girl and
asked Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to marry her off to one of the pages and set
them up on their own somewhere. Nannie Wang had been retained to escort
Dai-yu’s coffin to the South at a later date, while Dai-yu’s junior maids were
trans?ferred to Grandmother Jia’s apartment.
Bao-yu’s grief for Dai-yu and his general state of gloom were further compounded
when he considered this dispersal of the re?maining occupants of the Naiad’s House.
Then suddenly her death struck him in a new light: Dai-yu had been (or so Tan-chun
had told him) perfectly lucid at her moment of death; this lucidity, when combined
with the strange music, constituted conclusive proof that she had left this world to
return to a higher one; and that surely was cause for joy! His new-found joy was
short-lived, however, for pres?ently he overheard Bao-chai and Aroma in the next
room discussing the impending marriage of Tan-chun. With a cry of dismay, he fell
back weeping on the kang. Bao-chai and Aroma came hurrying in to support him,
with cries of ‘What’s the matter?’, but he was too distraught to reply. After a while he
composed himself sufficiently to speak:
‘This is the final blow! One by one all my sisters and cousins have been taken away
from me! Cousin Lin has joined the ranks of the fairies; my eldest sister has died -
though it’s true that even in her lifetime we had little enough chance to be together;
Ying is coupled with that brute; now Tan is being sent to the ends of the earth to be
married, and I shall never set eyes on her again! As for Xiang-yun, who knows where
she will end up? Bao-qin is engaged to be married and won’t be with us much longer.
Will no one be spared? Am I to be left here all on my own?’
Aroma was ready with words of comfort, but Bao-chai silenced her with a wave of
her hand:
‘Don’t humour him. Let me ask him a question instead.’
She turned to Bao-yu.
‘What is it that you want exactly? Do you expect all your cousins to stay here and
grow up into old maids, just in order to keep you company in your dotage? Don’t
they have your gracious permission to marry and lead their own lives? Tan is the first
of your sisters to be sent such a long way from home, and since it’s Father’s decision
there’s no going against it. As for the others, has it never occurred to you that they
might have plans of their own? You’re not the only person in the world with feelings
of brotherly love, you know. But if everyone with those feelings adopted your
attitude, for a start, I wouldn’t be living with you now, I’d still be. at home.
‘Honestly! Reading books is supposed to improve the mind and foster a more
sensible approach to life. But your wits seem more addled than ever! If that’s what
you really think, Aroma and I may as well go and live somewhere else. Then you can
go ahead and invite all the others to move in and look after you.’
Bao-yu took both of them by the hand:
‘I know you’re right. But why must it happen so soon? Couldn’t they wait till I am
dust and ashes!’
Aroma put her hand over his mouth:
‘There you go! More nonsense! You’ve only just begun to recover, and Mrs Bao’s
getting her appetite back again at last. If you make another scene I shall wash my
hands of you altogether!’
Bao-yu knew that they were talking sense. But in his heart he couldn’t find a way to
their sensible point of view. ‘What you are saying is obviously right,’ he moaned. ‘But
what can I do? I feel so utterly wretched.’
Bao-chai said nothing more but secretly despatched Aroma to fetch him a sedative.
They did their best to calm him down, and Aroma suggested to Bao-chai that they
should ask Tan-chun to refrain from calling on Bao-yu before her departure.
‘There’s no need to worry,’ said Bao-chai. ‘In a day or two, when he’s in a more
reasonable frame of mind, it would actually be a good thing for them to have a long
talk. Tan is an extremely intelligent person, and not the type to pander to the
sensibilities of others. I’m sure she’ll give him some sound advice, and help to cure
him from thinking in this way.’
Meanwhile Faithful arrived with a message from Grandmother Jia who had just
learned of Bao-yu’s relapse. Aroma was to comfort him and on no account to allow
him to fret. Aroma assured Faithful that she would follow Grandmother Jia’s
instructions, and after sitting with them for a short while Faithful returned.
Grandmother Jia was also concerned about the preparations for Tan-chun’s
departure. Although Tan-chun would not be travelling with a complete trousseau,
they should nevertheless provide her with all the personal effects she might need.
Grandmother Jia sent for Xi-?feng, told her of Jia Zheng’s decision and placed these
arrangements in her hands. Xi-feng undertook this responsibility, but to learn how
she managed you must turn to the next chapter.




CHAPTER 101



In Prospect Garden a moonlit apparition
repeats an ancient warning
And at Scattered Flowers Convent
the fortune-sticks provide a strange omen




Xi-feng returned to her apartment and, seeing that Jia Lian had not yet come home,
began supervising the preparation of Tan-chun’s baggage and trousseau.
   Later that evening, as dusk was giving way to night, she suddenly conceived the
idea of going to visit Tan-chun. She told Felicity and a couple of other maids to
accompany her, and sent one of them on ahead with a lantern. As they walked out, a
brilliant moon had already risen, and Xi-feng told the maid carrying the lantern that
she would not be needed and could go home. Then, as they passed the window of
the tea-room frequented by the domestics, she heard the sound of chattering
coming from within. An animated discussion of some sort seemed to be in progress,
punctuated by an occasional sob or burst of laughter. It must be some of the older
serving-women gathered for a gossip, thought Xi-feng; curious, and not a little
apprehensive, she told Crimson to go in and mingle with them.
   ‘Listen carefully,’ she said. ‘Lead them on, and find out what it is they’re talking
about.’
   ‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Crimson, and went on her errand.
   Xi-feng continued towards the Garden, accompanied now only by Felicity. The gate
had been left ajar and mistress and maid were able to push it lightly open and walk in.
Within the Garden the moonlight seemed even brighter, and the trees cast deep
pools of shadow. The intense silence created an atmosphere of extreme solitude and
de?solation. They were about to take the path to Autumn Studio when a gust of wind
blew through the trees, releasing a shower of falling leaves and soughing through the
branches with a doleful sound that startled the crows and other nesting birds into
flight. Xi-feng had drunk a little wine earlier in the evening, and the wind, when it
blew upon her, set her trembling.
   ‘How cold it is!’ said Felicity from behind, huddling up to try to keep warm. The
cold was even too much for Xi-feng.
   ‘You’d better go home straight away and fetch me my ermine?lined sleeveless
jacket. I shall wait for you at Miss Tan’s.’
   Felicity was glad of a chance to put on some warmer clothes herself, and needed
no second bidding.
   ‘Yes, ma’am,’ she replied, turning about at once and heading for home at a run.
   Xi-feng had not walked much further when she thought she heard something
behind her, a strange sound, like that of an animal snuf?fling. Her hair stood on end,
and looking back she caught sight of something black and shiny, a nose, pointed,
sniffing in her direction, and two eyes that glowed like lanterns. She was beside
herself with terror and gave a cry of alarm, only to see the creature - for it was now
recognizable as some sort of large dog - pad away from her, trailing a bushy tail. It
went bounding up to the top of a mound of earth, stood stock-still, and then turned
back towards her, raising its front paws in the air in a grotesque salutation.
   Xi-feng - now in a state of abject panic and shaking hysterically -hurried on as fast
as she could towards Autumn Studio. She had almost reached her destination and
was turning past a large rock when she caught a fleeting glimpse of a figure in the
shadows ahead of her. After a moment’s hesitation she guessed it to be a maid from
one of the apartments in the Garden, and called out:
   ‘Who’s there?’
   Xi-feng repeated the question, but no one came forward. She was already
beginning to feel quite faint, and in her confusion she thought she heard a voice
behind her murmuring:
   ‘Auntie, don’t you even recognize me?’
   She spun round and saw the figure of a lady standing there before her. There was
something strangely familiar about her, the beauty of her features, the elegance of
her attire; and yet some?how Xi-feng could not think for the moment whose young
wife it could be.
   ‘Auntie,’ the lady continued, ‘I see that the enjoyment of splendour and wealth is
still your only concern, and that my warning to you years ago, to “plan for the hard
times to come”, has gone completely unheeded.’
   Xi-feng lowered her head to try to think for a moment, but still could recall neither
the person’s identity, nor the occasion to which she was referring. The lady gave a
rueful laugh.
   ‘How you loved me once! Has all memory of me been utterly erased from your
mind?’
   Suddenly Xi-feng knew. It was Jia Rong’s first wife, Qin Ke-qing,
   ‘Aiyo!’ she cried. ‘But you died long ago! What are you doing here?’
   She spat at the ghost and fled. But as she did so she tripped on a stone, and the
shock of the fall gave her senses a jolt, as if waking them from a dream. Although her
whole body had broken out in a sweat and she was still shivering with fright, she now
felt alert and clear-headed and could distinguish the forms of Crimson and Felicity
walking in her direction. Anxious lest her disarray provoke un?favourable comment,
she hurriedly raised herself from the ground.
   ‘What have you two been doing?’ she scolded them. ‘You’ve been an age. Hurry
up and bring me my jacket.’
   Felicity came forward and helped her into the jacket, while Crimson supported her,
ready to walk on to Autumn Studio.
   ‘I’ve already been there,’ said Xi-feng untruthfully. ‘They are all asleep. Let’s go
home now.’
   She set off in great haste with the two maids. She arrived to find Jia Lian already at
home, and could tell from the expression on his face that he was in a worse humour
than usual. Although she wanted to ask what the matter was, she reflected that she
would only be scolded for her pains, and so went straight to bed.
   Next morning Jia Lian rose at dawn, intending to pay an early call on Qiu Shi-an,
Eunuch Superintendent of the Inner Palace, to seek his help in connection with some
personal matter. He had a little time to spare before setting off, and began glancing
through the copies of the Gazette that had been delivered the day before and were
lying on his table. The first item he happened to read was a routine report from the
Board of Civil Office, in which the Board requested an expedited appointment to the
vacant position of Senior Secretary, and received imperial authorization to proceed
according to prece?dent. The next report was from the Board of Punishments, and
communicated a memorial from the Governor of Yunnan Province, Wang Zhong,
concerning the arrest of a gang engaged in smugg?ling firearms and gunpowder.
There were eighteen members of the gang in all, the ringleader being one Bao Yin, a
domestic in the employment of Grand Preceptor Jia Hua, Duke of Zhen-guo. Jia Lian
paused and appeared to be turning this last item of news over in his mind for a
moment. Then he read on to the next item, an impeachment brought by Li Xiao, the
magistrate of Soochow. The charge in this case was that a certain mandarin had
indulged his household servants and allowed them to abuse their position in the
maltreatment of soldiers and civilians. It referred in particular to the attempted rape
and subsequent murder of an innocent married woman, and two other members of
her family, committed by one Shi Fu, who claimed to be a servant in the household of
Jia Fan, hereditary noble of the third degree.
   Jia Lian seemed especially troubled by this last report. He would have liked to read
the sequel, but was anxious not to miss his appoint?ment with the eunuch. Changing
into formal attire and dispensing with breakfast (though he did find time to take a
couple of sips of the tea that Patience had just brought him), he left the house,
mounted his horse and set off.
   Patience put away his clothes and went in to wait on Xi-feng, who was still in bed.
   ‘I heard you tossing and turning last night, ma’am. You can hardly have slept a wink.
Why don’t I give you a rub, and then maybe you’ll be able to have a little nap?’
   Xi-feng made no reply, and Patience, interpreting this as consent, climbed up onto
the kang, sat down next to her and started to administer a gentle massage. Xi-feng
was on the point of falling asleep when she heard Qiao-jie crying in the next room
and opened her eyes again. Patience called out:
   ‘Nannie Li, what are you doing? Qiao-jie’s crying. Go and pat her on the back, you
lazy old so-and-so!’
   Nannie Li was rudely awakened from her slumbers, and vented her ill humour on
Qiao-jie by giving her a few hefty spanks, mut?tering to herself:
   ‘Confound you, you wretched little brat! You’ve not long to live anyway- so just
shut up and go to sleep, instead of carrying on as if your mother was dead, bawling at
this ungodly hour!’
   She gnashed her teeth and gave the child a pinch for good measure. Qiao-jie began
bawling again at once.
   ‘For heaven’s sake! Just listen to that!’ exclaimed Xi-feng. ‘She’s torturing my little
girl! You go and give her the thrashing of her life, the evil old strumpet! And bring
Qiao-jie in here to me.’
   ‘Don’t be too cross, ma’am,’ said Patience with a placatory smile. ‘Nannie Li would
never dream of doing Qiao-jie any harm. It must have been an accident. If we beat
her, there will be no end to the gossip. I can just hear it: “Beating the servants before
the day’s even dawned!”‘
   After a long silence, Xi-feng heaved a deep sigh:
   ‘See what they get up to while I’m still alive and kicking! When I die - which won’t
be long now - I dread to think what will become of my poor Qiao-jie!’
   ‘How can you speak like that, ma’am?’ said Patience, trying to smile again. ‘Don’t
start the day off on such a gloomy note!’
   Xi-feng smiled bitterly:
   ‘What makes you so optimistic? I won’t last much longer. I’ve known it for some
time. When I look back over my twenty-five years, I really can’t complain. I’ve seen
things and tasted things most people have never so much as set eyes on. I’ve had
more than my share of comfort and luxury. I’ve been able to indulge my every whim,
no one’s ever managed to get the better of me in anything. If I am fated to die young,
why, that’s something I shall simply have to accept.’
   Tears were welling in Patience’s eyes. Xi-feng laughed:
   ‘Don’t pretend to feel sorry for me! You’ll be only too pleased to have me dead and
out of the way. Then you’ll all be able to lead happy and peaceful lives, rid of this
“thorn in your flesh”. There is only one thing I beg of you: whatever else happens,
don’t forget my little girl!’
   Patience was by now in floods of tears. Xi-feng laughed again:
   ‘Pull yourself together, for heaven’s sake! I’m not going to die for a little while yet.
It’s too soon to start crying. Unless you want to send me to my grave before time?’
   Patience dried her tears:
  ‘I just found what you were saying so upsetting, ma’am.’
  She carried on rubbing her back, and eventually Xi-feng dozed off.
  Patience had no sooner climbed down from the kang than she heard footsteps
outside. It was Jia Lian. He had ended up late for his appointment, and by the time he
arrived Eunuch Qiu had already left for court. So he had been obliged to return home
without having achieved anything, and was clearly in the blackest of moods. His first
words when he saw Patience were:
‘Aren’t the others up yet?’
‘No, sir.’
   He flung aside the portiere and walked into the inner room, ex?claiming
sarcastically:
   ‘Marvellous! Still in bed at this hour! Feet up and twiddling their thumbs at a time
of family crisis!’
   He called impatiently for tea and Patience hastened to pour him a cup. Earlier that
morning, after Jia Lian’s departure, the maids and serving-women had all gone back
to sleep, and as none of them had expected him back so early the household was still
in a state of complete disorder. There was no fresh tea, and the best Patience could
produce was a cup of cold tea warmed up. When Jia Lian discovered this, he was
furious and hurled his cup to the ground. The sound of smashing china woke Xi-feng
again, and she sat up in a cold sweat, crying out in alarm and staring wide-eyed
around her. She saw her husband sitting beside the kang in a fuming rage, and
Patience stooping to retrieve the fragments of broken cup.
   ‘Why are you back so soon?’ she asked. After a long interval in which no answer
was forthcoming, she repeated the question, and finally he shouted at her:
   ‘Would you rather I hadn’t come back at all? Do you wish I’d dropped down dead
somewhere?’
   ‘That’s a little unnecessary, isn’t it?’ said Xi-feng, smiling uneasily. ‘I just wondered
why you were back so early today, that’s all. It’s nothing to lose your temper about.’
   ‘I failed to see the man again, so there was nothing to be gained by not coming
home.’ His voice was still raised.
   ‘In that case,’ said Xi-feng, still attempting a wan smile, ‘you’ll just have to be
patient and wait till tomorrow. Go a bit earlier next time, and you’ll be sure to see
him.’
   ‘Here I am,’ shouted Jia Lian, ‘up to my eyes in work of my own, with no one to
lend me a hand, and I have to waste my time like this chasing another man’s game!
I’ve been tearing around days on end, and heaven alone knows why, when the
person really involved is sitting at home and having a good time! He doesn’t seem
the least bit bothered. On the contrary, he’s even had the nerve to throw a birthday
party, with plays and all sorts of fun and games - while I’m still running around in
circles trying to sort out his mess!’
   He spat on the ground, and then proceeded to give Patience a thorough ticking-off
for good measure. Xi-feng was choking with indignation. Her first impulse was to
argue it out with him.       But after a moment’s reflection she thought it advisable to
contain herself and still struggled to keep a smile on her face:
   ‘But why work yourself up into such a rage about it? And why come ranting at me
at this hour of the day? Did I ever say you had to do anyone this favour? If you’ve
promised to, then be patient and go through with it for their sake. Anyway, it’s
inconceivable that someone in serious trouble could feel in the mood for parties and
plays.’
   Jia Lian: ‘Precisely! Perhaps you’d like to go and ask him about it yourself
tomorrow!’
   Xi-feng (surprised): ‘Ask whom?’
   Jia Lian: ‘Your brother.’
   Xi-feng: ‘Him?’
   Jia Lian: ‘Of course! Who else?’
   Xi-feng (concerned): ‘But why does he need your help?’
   Jia Lian: ‘You’re so well informed, you might as well be stuck at the bottom of a
pickle-jar!’
   Xi-feng: ‘But I had no idea he was in any kind of trouble! How extraordinary!’
   Jia Lian: ‘Of course you didn’t. Even Aunt Wang and Aunt Xue don’t know about it.
I didn’t want to worry them. And you’re always telling me how ill you are, so I
decided to try to keep the whole thing from you as well. The very mention of it is
enough to put me in a rage. Even today I wouldn’t have told you, if you hadn’t
pressed me. No doubt you think that brother of yours is a marvellous fellow! But do
you know what people call him?’
   Xi-feng: ‘What?’
Jia Lian: ‘Wang Ren.’
   Xi-feng let out a puzzled little laugh.
   ‘Well, that’s his name, isn’t it?’
   Jia Lian: ‘That’s what you think. It’s not that “Wang Ren”; it’s the one meaning
“Blind to all forms of human decency”!’
   Xi-feng: ‘Why, that’s an insult! Who’d ever say such a thing?’
   Jia Lian: ‘It’s no less than he deserves! I may as well tell you the truth, so that you
can see for yourself what sort of a brother you really have. What about this birthday
party he’s giving for Uncle Zi?sheng?’
   Xi-feng thought for a moment, then exclaimed:
   ‘Aiyo! Why yes, now that you mention it, that’s something I meant to ask you
about: surely Uncle Zi-sheng’s birthday falls during the winter? Bao-yu used to go
every year. How strange! I remember quite clearly. When Uncle Zheng was promoted
and Uncle Zi-sheng sent those players over, I made a mental note to myself. It
seemed so out of character for him to do a thing like that. Uncle Zi-sheng has always
been the mean one, not at all like Uncle Zi-teng. In fact the two brothers were always
at daggers drawn. You only have to look at the casual way Uncle Zi-sheng behaved
when Uncle Zi-teng died. You’d never have thought they were even related.
   ‘I remember saying that when his next birthday came round we should be sure to
send him some players as a return gesture, so as not to be beholden to him. But
surely it’s much too early in the year for him to be celebrating his birthday now?
What’s going on?’
   Jia Lian: ‘You still haven’t got the faintest idea, have you? The very first thing your
precious brother Ren did when he got back to the capital was to profit from Uncle
Zi-teng’s death by holding a memorial service. He was afraid we’d try to put a stop to
it so he never told us. The funeral donations brought him in several thousand taels, I
can tell you. Uncle Zi-sheng was furious with him afterwards for cornering the
market. This put your brother in a bit of a spot. So for his next little project he picked
Uncle Zi-sheng’s birthday, the perfect opportunity to make some more money for
himself, and placate old Zi-sheng into the bargain. He wasn’t going to be held back by
what the family or friends might say, or by the paltry fact that Uncle Zi-sheng doesn’t
really have a birthday until next winter. Let people think what they like, he doesn’t
care! He doesn’t know the meaning of the word “pride”!
   ‘Now, on top of all this, let me tell you why I got up so early this morning. Recently
there’s been a memorial from the Censorate. It’s in some way connected with the
recent disturbances on the coast. The wording refers to “the deficit left by Wang
Zi-teng after his term of office” and asks that this deficit be “made good by his
younger brother Wang Zi-sheng and by his nephew Wang Ren”. The two of them got
the wind up and asked me to try to pull a few strings for them. I agreed to do it for
them. They seemed so pathetic and scared, and anyway I was afraid it might
eventually affect you and Aunt Wang. I hoped old Qiu in the Inner Palace might see
to it for me, perhaps get Uncle Zi-teng’s successor to cook the books somehow. But I
was late, damn it, he’d already left for court. So there I was, up at dawn, tearing
around for nothing, while they put on plays and hold a party! If that isn’t enough to
make a man’s blood boil, tell me what is!’
   Xi-feng still felt she must put some sort of a case for her brother, partly out of her
constitutional need never to admit defeat, and partly out of loyalty to her own
family:
   ‘However badly he may have behaved, he’s still your brother-in-law. If you help
him, you’ll be doing a good turn for both of my uncles, for the living and the dead.
Our family honour is at stake; so I implore you to help. Otherwise you know what will
happen: I shall be held responsible for your wrath, and they’ll blacken my name for
ever.’
   Xi-feng burst into tears. Sitting up in bed, she began to comb her hair, and to throw
on some clothes.
   ‘There’s no need for you to react like that,’ said Jia Lian. ‘It’s your brother who’s
behaved so abominably; I’ve said nothing against you. And the servants-- when I had
to go out this morning, I knew you were not well, so I didn’t disturb you. But they just
went on sleeping. Our parents never tolerated such behaviour. You’ve grown too
slack. You want to please everybody, that’s your trouble. And the moment I say
anything critical, you start hauling yourself out of bed in protest. If I give the servants
a piece of my mind, I suppose you’ll stick up for them next. It’s too absurd!’
   Xi-feng dried her eyes.
   ‘It’s late,’ she said. ‘I ought to be getting up anyway.’ After a pause, she continued:
‘Even if that’s how you feel, please try to do what you can for my family, for my sake.
And you know how grateful Aunt Wang will be.’
   ‘All right, all right,’ grumbled Jia Lian. ‘Stop teaching your grand?mother to suck
eggs.’
   ‘Why are you getting up, ma’am?’ put in Patience. ‘It’s too early yet. And I don’t
see what you have to work yourself into such a terrible temper for, sir! Why take it all
out on us? Hasn’t Mrs Lian gone to enough trouble for you in the past? The number
of times she’s borne the brunt on your behalf! Perhaps I shouldn’t say this, but in
view of all that she’s done for you, it doesn’t seem very fair to make such a big fuss
about this one favour, especially when you think how many other people are
involved. Do you have no con?sideration for her feelings? Why should she take all the
blame anyway? We were late getting up, and you’re entitled to be angry with us-
we’re only servants after all. But when you think how she has worked herself into the
ground and ruined her health, it seems so unkind of you to pick a quarrel with her
now!’
   Patience’s eyes filled with tears. Jia Lian’s original ill humour, strong though it had
undoubtedly been, could not withstand the combined opposition of both his
womenfolk- at once so appealing and so sharp-tongued.
   ‘All right, forget it,’ he said, with a bitter smile. ‘She’s hard enough to cope with on
her own, without you leaping to her defence. I know I’m just an outsider here anyway,
and you’re both itching to have me dead and out of the way.’
   ‘Don’t speak like that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Who knows what will happen to any of us?
Very probably I shall die before you. The sooner I do, the sooner my heart will be at
rest.’
   She began to weep again, and Patience tried to comfort her. It was now broad
daylight, and the sun was shining in at the window. Jia Lian, who saw little prospect
of steering the conversation out of this impasse, took his leave.
   Xi-feng was about to finish her toilet when one of Lady Wang’s junior maids came
in:
   ‘Her Ladyship says, will you be visiting your uncle today, ma’am, and if so would
you take Mrs Bao with you?’
   Xi-feng had found the recent scene thoroughly depressing. It was deeply
mortifying that her own family should let her down so badly, on top of which she was
still suffering from the shock of her en?counter in the Garden the previous evening,
and felt in no mood for an excursion.
   ‘Tell Her Ladyship that I still have one or two things to see to, and won’t be able to
go today. Anyway the party they’re holding is not what I would call a genuine
occasion. If Mrs Bao wants to go, she can go on her own.’
   ‘Yes, ma’am.’
   The maid returned with this message to Lady Wang’s apartment.
   When she had completed her toilet and dressed herself, Xi-feng reflected that
even if she didn’t attend the party, she ought at least to send a note. Besides,
Bao-chai had not been married long, and would probably feel rather nervous about
going by herself. She decided she should visit her, if only to offer moral support, and
after a brief call on Lady Wang she excused herself on some pretext and made her
way to Bao-yu’s apartment. He was reclining fully dressed on the kang, staring in a
trance-like manner at Bao-chai, who was busy combing her hair. Xi-feng stood in the
doorway for a while watching them. Bao-chai presently turned round and seeing her
standing there promptly rose to her feet and asked her to be seated. Bao-yu also
climbed down from the kang, as Xi-feng seated herself, with a playful smile on her
face. Bao-chai scolded Musk:
‘Why didn’t you say that Mrs Lian was here?’
Musk laughed: ‘When Mrs Lian came in, she gave us a sign to be silent.’
Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu:
   ‘Well, what are you waiting for? Off you go! Honestly, I’ve never set eyes on such a
great big baby. A lady wants to do her toilet in private, and you have to climb up
beside her and sit there staring! Heavens above, you’re man and wife now, you’ve all
day to gawp at her. And what about the maids? Don’t you care if they make fun of
you?’
   Xi-feng giggled and eyed Bao-yu, clicking her tongue in mock-disapproval. Her
words seemed to have little effect on him other than making him feel rather
uncomfortable. Bao-chai, however, blushed a fierce crimson, ashamed at having to
listen but too embar?rassed to reply. Aroma came in with some tea and Bao-chai
endea?voured to conceal her embarrassment by offering Xi-feng a pipe of tobacco.
Xi-feng rose to her feet and smilingly accepted.
   ‘Cousin Chai, take no notice of us. Hadn’t you better hurry and get dressed?’
   Bao-yu meanwhile had begun shambling around, searching for something one
moment, fiddling with something else the next.
   ‘Off with you then!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Who ever heard of a husband waiting for his wife
to go out?’
   ‘These clothes aren’t right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That peacock cape Grannie gave me to
wear last time I went to Uncle Zi-sheng’s was so much nicer.’
   ‘Well, go ahead and wear it this time then,’ said Xi-feng teasingly.
   ‘How can I? It’s too early in the year.
   Xi-feng realized that she had inadvertently drawn attention to the incorrect
‘timing’ (and therefore fraudulent nature) of her uncle’s party. It didn’t matter so
much about Bao-chai, who was herself related to the Wangs. But she felt
embarrassed to have thus risked discrediting her own family in front of the maids.
Aroma, whose mind was running along very different lines, hastened to add her
explanation of Bao-yu’s words:
   ‘I don’t think you understand, ma’am. He wouldn’t wear that cape even if it were
the right season.’
   ‘Why ever not?’ asked Xi-feng.
   ‘I should explain, ma’am,’ replied Aroma. ‘Mr Bao’s ways are sometimes so very
strange. Her Old Ladyship gave him the cape to wear to his uncle Wang’s party two
years ago. He had an accident and burnt a hole in it. My mother was seriously ill at
the time and I was at home looking after her. Skybright was still with us then, though
she was already ill, and I was told when I got back that she had stayed up all night
darning the cape for him. The mend was so neat that Her Old Ladyship didn’t even
notice it the next day. One day last year, when it was particularly cold, I told Tealeaf
to take the cape to school in case Bao-yu needed something warmer to put on. But
the sight of it reminded Bao-yu of Skybright and he said he never wanted to wear it
again. He told me to put it away for good.’
   ‘Poor Skybright!’ put in Xi-feng before Aroma had finished speaking. ‘Such a pretty
girl! And so clever with her hands! If only she hadn’t been quite so quick-tongued.
Someone must have gone gossiping to Lady Wang, or she would never have dealt
with the poor girl so harshly and driven her to such an early death.
   ‘Which reminds me. Not so very long ago I saw Cook Liu’s daughter - Fivey I think
her name is - and couldn’t help noticing that she’s the spitting image of Skybright. I
thought of bringing her in to work for me, and her mother seemed agreeable to the
idea. Then I thought what a good replacement she’d make for Crimson in Bao-yu’s
apartment. But Patience told me it was Lady Wang’s policy not to take on any more
pretty maids like Skybright for Bao-yu. So I dropped the idea. Now that he’s married
I’m sure there can be no objection. I’ll tell Fivey to start work here straight away. How
would that be, Bao? Then if you ever find yourself missing Skybright, all you need to
do is look at Fivey instead.’
   Bao-yu had been about to leave the room, but at Xi-feng’s mention of Fivey had
stood there bemused. Aroma spoke for him:
   ‘Of course he’d be pleased. He’s wanted her as a maid for a long while, but knew
that Her Ladyship was against the idea.’
   ‘Very well then, I’ll tell her to come tomorrow,’ said Xi-feng. ‘And I’ll square your
mother myself.’
   Bao-yu’s delight knew no bounds and he set off in high spirits for Grandmother
Jia’s apartment, leaving Bao-chai to finish her toilet.
   Xi-feng had found the contrast between the way in which Bao-yu and Bao-chai
clung to each other, and her own recent conflict with Jia Lian, somewhat depressing,
and she was now anxious to leave. She rose and said to Bao-chai with a smile:
   ‘Shall we go and see Aunt Wang now?’
   Still smiling she walked out of the room, and Bao-chai accom?panied her. They
went first to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where they found Bao-yu informing the
old lady of the proposed expedition to Uncle Wang Zi-sheng’s. Grandmother Jia
nodded:
   ‘Off you go then. But don’t drink too much, and be sure to come home early. Don’t
forget you’re only just beginning to get well again.’
   ‘Yes, Grannie,’ said Bao-yu.
   He had no sooner reached the courtyard than he turned round and re-entered the
room, walking over to Bao-chai and whispering some?thing in her ear. She smiled:
   ‘Yes of course. Now be off with you!’
   She hurried him on his way once more.
   Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and Bao-chai settled down to a con?versation, but had
barely exchanged three sentences when Ripple appeared:
   ‘The Young Master has sent Tealeaf back with a message for Mrs Bao.’
   Bao-chai: ‘What’s he forgotten now?’
   Ripple: ‘I told one of the junior maids to ask Tealeaf. The message is this: “The
Young Master forgot to tell Mrs Bao something. She should not be too long if she is
coming; and if she isn’t, then she should take care not to stand in a draught”.’
  Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and the entire assembly of old serving-women and
maidservants burst out laughing. Bao-chai blushed fiercely and said to Ripple with a
scornful ‘pfui’:
‘Silly creature! Is that worth running back in such a fluster for?’
Ripple giggled and sent a junior maid to scold Tealeaf, who raced back to Bao-yu,
calling to the maid over his shoulder:
   ‘The Young Master insisted on my dismounting to go on this fool’s errand. If I
hadn’t delivered his message I’d have been in trouble with him, and now that I have I
get it in the neck from them!’
   The maid laughed and went running back to repeat this to the ladies.
Grandmother Jia turned to Bao-chai:
   ‘You’d better go, my dear, or he’ll never stop fretting.’
   What with this and Xi-feng’s merciless teasing, Bao-chai felt too embarrassed to
stay any longer.

*

When Bao-chai had taken her leave, Perfecta, one of the nuns from the Convent of
the Scattered Flowers, came to call on Grandmother Jia. She greeted Xi-feng also, and
sat down to take tea.
  ‘Why haven’t you been to see us for such a long while?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
  ‘These past few days we have had so many services at the Convent,’ replied
Perfecta, ‘and so many grand ladies coming to make their devotions; I just haven’t
had a moment to call my own. Today I have a special reason for visiting Your Old
Ladyship. We have a private service tomorrow which I thought you might possibly be
interested in attending.’
   ‘What kind of service is it?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
   ‘Last month,’ replied Perfecta, ‘the household of the late Excellency Wang was
afflicted with a possession of spirits. Her Ladyship even saw her husband’s departed
spirit during the night. She came to tell me about it yesterday at the Convent, and
pledged herself to an act of devotion at the shrine of our Bodhisattva of the
Scattered Flowers. It’s to be a forty-nine-day Solemn Mass for Purification of All Souls
on Land and Sea, for the Preservation and Peace of All Members of the Family, for
the Ascension into the Celestial Regions of All Departed Souls, and for the Well-Being
in This Life of All the Living. I’ve been extremely busy with the preparations, and this
is the first opportunity I’ve had to come and pay my respects.’
   Xi-feng had always scorned all forms of superstition. But her encounter with Qin
Ke-qing’s spirit the night before had begun to undermine her scepticism, and
Perfecta’s words now struck a new chord in her. She could almost feel herself being
converted to a belief in the efficacy of such rituals.
    ‘Who is this Bodnisattva of the Scattered Flowers?’ she asked the nun. ‘How is it
that he has the power to avert misfortune and keep evil spirits at bay?’
    Perfecta could sense that a seed had been sown.
    ‘Since you have asked, dear lady,’ she replied, ‘allow me to tell you a little about
this Saint of ours. His story is an ancient and well-attested one, full of miraculous
events. Born in the Land of Giant Trees in the Western Paradise, of humble parents
who hewed wood for a living, the Bodhisattva came into the world with three horns
on his head and four eyes in his forehead. He was three feet tall at birth, with arms so
long that his hands reached the ground. His parents thought him to be the
incarnation of some monstrous spirit, and abandoned him on an icy mountainside.
But, unbeknown to them, this mountain was the haunt of a magic monkey, who used
to come there hunting for food. On one of his excursions he discovered the child and
noticed that from the tip of his head there emanated a white aura that streamed up
towards Heaven, causing tigers and wolves to keep their distance.
    ‘The monkey realized that this was someone very special indeed, and he carried
the Bodhisattva-child home to his cave and reared him. The boy, so the monkey soon
discovered, was endowed with prodigious innate powers of Perception, and with an
intuitive ability to expound the Mysteries of Zen. He would engage the monkey in
daily philosophical discussions and the two of them would practise meditation
together. So wonderful were his words that at the sound of them the sky would be
filled with an abundance of scattered flowers. After a thousand years had passed, he
ascended into Heaven. The spot where he expounded the sutras, the Precinct of the
Scattered Flowers, as it is called, can be seen on the hillside to this very day. Every
prayer uttered there has proved efficacious. Many a miracle has been performed,
many a soul delivered from its afflictions. In due time men built a temple there, and
fashioned a statue of the Saint, before which they make offerings.’
   ‘But what proof is there that any of this is true?’ asked Xi-feng.
   ‘Still sceptical, ma’am? What proof of that sort can there be, of a Living Buddha?
But consider: if it were all a mere fabrication, it might have fooled one or two, but it
could hardly have fooled the multitudes of intelligent men and women who have put
their faith in him over the ages. The unbroken incense-offerings of believers, and the
miracles wrought, testify to the enduring power of our religion and serve continually
to inspire our faith.’
   Xi-feng was almost convinced.
   ‘In that case I shall visit you tomorrow and test it for myself. Do you have
fortune-sticks at the temple? I should like to consult them. If they give me a plausible
answer to my question, I shall embrace your faith.’
   ‘Our fortune-sticks are particularly efficacious, ma’am,’ said Per?fecta. ‘Try them
tomorrow and see for yourself.’
   ‘Why not wait until the day after?’ put in Grandmother Jia. ‘That will be the first of
the month. Better to try then.’
   Perfecta drank her tea and went on to visit Lady Wang, before returning to her
Convent.
   Xi-feng managed to struggle through the rest of that day and the next, and early in
the morning of the first of the month she had her carriage made ready, and set out
for the Convent of the Scattered Flowers, accompanied by Patience and a bevy of
serving-women. Perfecta and the other nuns welcomed her, ushered her in and
offered her tea, and then after she had washed her hands they all proceeded to the
main hall of worship to burn incense. Xi-feng would not look up at the statues, but
otherwise conducted herself like a devout believer, kowtowing and taking the tube of
fortune-sticks from the altar. She prayed in silence, describing her encounter with the
spirit and her chronic state of ill health, then shook the tube three times. There was a
‘whoosh!’ and one of the bamboo sticks shot out of the tube. Xi-feng kowtowed
again and picked it up. It bore the inscrip?tion: ‘No.33. Supreme Good Fortune.’
Perfecta promptly consulted the Divination Book and found under entry No.33 the
following line of verse, which she read aloud:

            ‘Wang Xi-feng comes home to rest, in finery arrayed.’

  Xi-feng was astounded to hear her own name, and asked the nun:
  ‘Is there some historical person by the name of Wang Xi-feng?’
  ‘Surely, ma’am,’ replied Perfecta, ‘a lady of your wide knowledge has encountered
the story of Wang Xi-feng of the Later Han dynasty and what befell him on his way to
the examination?’
  Zhou Rui’s wife was standing at Xi-feng’s side and added with a smile:
  ‘Why, that was the story the lady storyteller told at the Lantern Festival a couple of
years ago. We asked her not to use your name as it was impolite.’
  Of course,’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. ‘I forgot.’
She went on to read the rest of the text:


‘When twenty years away from home have passed,
In silks the wanderer returns at last.
           The bee culls nectar from a hundred flowers;
Honey for some, but for himself a thankless task.
A traveller arrives.
News is delayed.
In litigation, success.
            In matrimony, reconsideration.’

   Xi-feng could not make much sense of it, and Perfecta hastened to expound:
   ‘My congratulations, ma’am! What an uncannily apt response on the part of the
oracle! Since you have grown up here in the capital, you have never had a chance to
visit your old home in Nanking. But now that Sir Zheng has received this provincial
posting, he may well send for his family to join him and then, surely, you will “come
home to rest, in finery arrayed”!’
   As she spoke Perfecta copied down the text and gave it to one of the maids.
Xi-feng was still only half-convinced by her interpretation. Perfecta set a vegetarian
meal before her guest, but Xi-feng seemed loath to eat, and after a mouthful put
down her chopsticks and rose to leave. She gave Perfecta a contribution ‘for incense’,
and the nun, realizing that she could not persuade her to stay any longer, saw her out
of the Convent.
   When Xi-feng returned home, Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the others insisted
on having a full report. She told one of the maids to recite the words of the
divination, complete with the interpreta?tion. The ladies were delighted:
   ‘Perhaps Sir Zheng is planning to send for us all! What a nice trip that would be!’
   Any doubts Xi-feng still harboured about the favourable reading of the omen were
dispelled by their unanimous acceptance of it.

*
   Our story now turns to Bao-yu. On the day in question, after waking from his
midday nap, he noticed that Bao-chai was out and was beginning to wonder where
she might be, when he saw her come back into the room.
   ‘Where have you been?’ he asked. ‘You’ve been out a long time.’
   ‘I’ve been looking at Cousin Feng’s divination.’
   Bao-yu was keen to hear the whole story. Bao-chai obliged; and when she had
finished reciting the divination verse for him, she commented:
   ‘Everyone else says it’s a lucky omen, but personally I think there’s more to the
words than meets the eye. “Comes home to rest, in finery arrayed.” Hm ... We shall
have to wait and see.’
   ‘There you go, sceptical as ever,’ quipped Bao-yu. ‘Forever seeking strange
meanings. It must be a lucky saying; anyone can tell that. You would have some pet
theory of your own. So what do you think it means?’
Bao-chai was about to elaborate, when a maid arrived to inform her that her
presence was required at Lady Wang’s. To learn the reason for this summons, please
read the next chapter.

Illness descends upon the Jia family
in Ning-guo House
And charms and holy water are used

Bao-chai went immediately to Lady Wang’s apartment.
   ‘As you know, Tan-chun is getting married,’ began Lady Wang, when Bao-chai had
paid her respects. ‘You and Li Wan must have a word with her before she leaves, and
try to cheer her up. She is your own cousin after all. She’s such a sensible girl, and I
know how well the two of you get along together. I understand that Bao-yu was most
upset and started crying when he heard the news. You must talk him round too.
   ‘I’ve been too poorly recently to be able to do much myself, and Feng spends half
her days laid up in bed. You’re a clever girl. From now on you’re going to have to
accept a greater share of the family responsibilities. Don’t feel you must hold back all
the time for fear of causing offence. In time the weight of this entire household will
rest on your shoulders.’
   ‘Yes, Mother.’
   Lady Wang continued:
   ‘There’s another thing. Feng came here with Cook Liu’s daughter yesterday and
said she wanted her to fill the vacancy in your apartment.’
   ‘Yes, Mother. Patience brought her over to start today,’ said Bao-?chai. ‘She said
that you and Cousin Feng were in agreement about it.’
   ‘Yes. As a matter of fact it was Feng’s idea. I decided it was not worth making an
issue of it and going against her wishes. But I feel I should warn you all the same, the
girl doesn’t look altogether reliable to me. She could make trouble. A while ago I had
one or two of Bao?yu’s more flirtatious maids dismissed- I’m sure you knew about
the affair; it led to your going home to live with your mother. Now that you and
Bao-yu are married, things are different of course. But I still feel I ought to mention it,
so that you can keep an eye on her. Remember, Aroma is the only dependable maid
in your apartment.’
    ‘Yes, Mother.’
    Bao-chai stayed a little longer and then left. After dinner she visited Tan-chun and
talked with her at some length, offering what comfort and advice she could. We need
not describe their conversa?tion in any detail.
    The next day was Tan-chun’s day of departure and she came once more to bid a
final farewell to Bao-yu. He found the parting a painful one, as was only to be
expected. But when she spoke to him calmly and philosophically of her ‘obligations in
life’, although at first he hung his head in silence, in the end he began to look a little
more cheerful. Tan-chun was relieved that he seemed able to view her future in a
less tragic and more enlightened manner; and after saying goodbye to the rest of the
family, she climbed into her sedan and set off on the long journey that would take
her by land and water to the South.

*

Prospect Garden, once home to such a distinguished little society of young ladies,
had since the death of the Imperial Concubine been left to fall into gradual ruin. With
Bao-yu’s marriage, Dai-yu’s death and the departure of Xiang-yun and Bao-qin, the
number of residents was already sadly depleted. Then, when the cold weather set in,
Li Wan, her cousins Li Qi and Li Wen, Xi-chun and Tan-chun had all moved out to their
previous abodes and had only ever gathered together in the Garden to enjoy
themselves on particularly fine days or moonlit nights. With Tan-chun no longer at
home and Bao-yu still convalescing and confined indoors, there was scarcely anyone
left to enjoy the Garden’s delights. It became a desolate place, its paths frequented
only by the handful of caretakers whom duty still obliged to live there.
   On the day of Tan-chun’s departure, You-shi had come across to Rong-guo House
to see her off. It was getting late by the time she left for home, and she decided to
save herself the trouble of taking a carriage by returning through the Garden, using
the side gate that communicated with Ning-guo House. As she walked through the
grounds she was forcibly struck by the aura of desolation that pervaded the place.
The buildings were unchanged, but she noticed that a strip of land along the inside of
the Garden wall had already been converted into some sort of vegetable plot. A deep
sense of melancholy oppressed her spirit. When she reached home she immed?iately
developed a fever, and though she fought it off for a couple of days eventually she
had to retire to bed. During the daytime the fever was not unduly severe, but at night
it became almost insup?portable and she grew delirious and started babbling to
herself. Cousin Zhen sent for a doctor at once, who pronounced that she had caught
a chill, which had developed complications and had entered into the yang-ming
stomach meridian. This accounted for her delirious babbling and hallucinations. She
would recover once she had opened her bowels.
   You-shi took two doses of the medicine the doctor prescribed, but showed no sign
of improvement. If anything she became more deranged than before. Cousin Zhen
was now seriously concerned and sent for Jia Rong:
   ‘Get hold of the names of some good doctors in town and send for one
immediately. We must have a second opinion.’
   ‘But the doctor who came the other day is extremely well thought of,’ objected Jia
Rong. ‘It seems to me that in Mother’s case medicine is of little use.’
   ‘How can you talk like that!’ exclaimed Cousin Zhen. ‘If we don’t give her medicine,
what are we supposed to do? Just let her fade away?’
   ‘I didn’t say she couldn’t be cured,’ said Jia Rong. ‘What was going through my
mind was this: when Mother went over to Rong-?guo House the other day, she came
back through the Garden. And the fever began as soon as she reached home. It could
be that she encountered some evil spirit on the way and is now possessed. I happen
to know of an excellent fortune-teller in town, by the name of Half-Immortal Mao.
He hails from the South, and is something of a specialist in The Book of Changes. I
think we should ask him for a consultation first. See if he can shed any light on the
matter. If that gets us nowhere, then let’s by all means look for another doctor.’
   Cousin Zhen agreed, and they sent for the fortune-teller at once. When he arrived,
he and Jia Rong sat down together in the study and after drinking his tea
Half-Immortal Mao began the consultation proper:
   ‘On what matter does my esteemed client wish me to consult the Changes?’
   ‘It concerns my mother,’ said Jia Rong. ‘She has fallen ill. Could you please seek
some illumination from the Changes on her behalf?’
   ‘Very well,’ replied Mao. ‘First I shall require some clean water with which to wash
my hands. Then, will you be so good as to light some incense, and to set up a small
altar? And I shall proceed with the divination.’
   The servants carried out these instructions, and Mao extracted the divining
cylinder from within his gown, approached the altar, and after making a profound
reverence began shaking the cylinder, intoning the following prayer:
   ‘In the name of the Supreme Ultimate, of the Yin and of the Yang, and of the
Generative Powers of the Cosmos; in the name of the Holy Signs made manifest in
the Great River, which embody the Myriad Transformations of the Universe, and of
the Saints who in their wisdom leave no sincere request unheeded: here, in good
faith, Mr Jia, on the occasion of his mother’s illness, devoutly beseeches the Four
Sages, Fu Xi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, to look down from above
and vouchsafe an efficacious response to this his earnest supplication. If evil lies
hidden, then bring the evil to light; if good, then show the good. First we ask to be
told the Three Lines of the Lower Trigram.’
   He turned the cylinder upside down and the coins fell onto the tray.
   ‘Ah! Most efficacious: for the Prime we have a Moving Yin.’
The second throw gave a Yang At Rest, the third another Moving Yin. Picking up the
coins, Half-Immortal Mao said:
   ‘The Lower Trigram has been communicated. Now let us ask to receive the Three
Lines of the Upper Trigram, and thus complete the Hexagram.’
These fell as follows: Yang At Rest, Yin At Rest, Yang At Rest. Half-Immortal Mao
replaced the cylinder and coins inside his gown, and sat down.
‘Pray be seated,’ he said. ‘Let us consider this in greater detail. We have here the
sixty-fourth Hexagram, “Before Completion”: x-.

The Line of most significance to you and to your generation is the Tertian, with Fire at
the Seventh Branch Wu, and the Signature“Ruin”. This certainly indicates that Dire
Misfortune lies in store. You have asked me to consult the Changes concerning your
mother’s illness, and great attention should therefore be paid to the parental Prime,
which contains the Signature “Spectre”, as does the Quintal. It would seem that your
mother is indeed seriously afflicted. But all will still be for the best. The present
misfortune is concatenated with Water at the First Branch Zi and at the Twelfth
Branch Hai; but when this element wanes, with the Third Branch Yin comes Wood
and thence Fire. The Signature “Offspring” at the Tertian also counteracts the
Spectral influence, and with the regenerative effect of the continuing revolution of
both the solar and lunar bodies, in two days the “Spectre” originally concatenated
with Water at the First Branch Zi should be rendered void, and by the day Xu all will
be well. But I see that the parental Prime contains further Spectral permu?tations. I
fear your father may himself be afflicted. And your own per?sonal Line has a severe
concentration of “Ruin”. When Water reaches its zenith and Earth its nadir, be
prepared for misfortune to strike.’
   Mao sat back, thrusting his beard forward, as if to emphasize the authenticity of
his prognosis.
   At the beginning of this rigmarole it was all Jia Rong could do to keep a straight
face. But gradually Mao impressed him as a man who knew what he was talking
about, and when he went on to predict misfortune for Cousin Zhen, Jia Rong began
to take him rather more seriously.
   ‘Your exposition is certainly very learned,’ he commented. ‘But could you, I wonder,
be more precise as to the nature of the illness that is affilicting my mother?’
   ‘In the Hexagram,’ replied Mao, ‘Fire at the Seventh Branch Wu in the Prime
changes to Water and is thus controlled. This would indicate some inner congestion
in which both cold and heat are combined. But I am afraid a precise diagnosis lies
beyond the lim?itations of even a more elaborate milfoil reading of the Changes. For
that, you would have to cast a Six Cardinal horoscope.’
   ‘Is that branch of divination one with which you are also con?versant?’ asked Jia
Rong.
   ‘To a certain extent,’ replied Mao.
   Jia Rong asked him to cast the horoscope, and wrote down the relevant Stems and
Branches. Mao proceeded to adjust his Diviner’s Compass, setting the co-ordinates
for the Heavenly Generals. The reading obtained was: ‘White Tiger’ at the Eleventh
Branch Xu.
   ‘This Configuration,’ said Mao, ‘is known as “Dissolution of the Soul.” The “White
Tiger” is inauspicious, but is contained and prevented from doing injury when it
occurs at a zenith of fortune. In this case, however, it is enveloped in a Mephitic Aura,
and occurs at a seasonal passage where Confinement and Death predominate; it is
therefore a hungry tiger and sure to do harm. The effect is similiar to the spiritual
dispersion consequent upon extreme shock. Hence the name of the configuration,
which represents a state of acute physical and mental alarm, of profound melancholy;
in illness it foresees death, in litigation misfortune. The Tiger is seen approaching at
sunset, which means the illness must have been contracted in the evening. The
wording reads: “In this configuration, a Tiger lies hidden in some old building,
making mischief, or manifests itself in some more palpable way.”
  ‘You are enquiring specifically about your parents. In a Yang or daylight
environment, the Tiger afflicts the male, while a Yin or night-time environment it
afflicts the female. This configuration therefore bodes ill for both of your parents.
   Jia Rong was stunned by this, and turned ashen pale.
   ‘It all sounds very convincing,’ he said, before Mao could continue. ‘But it doesn’t
exactly tally with the Hexagram in The Book of Changes. How dangerous is the
situation, do you think?’
‘Do not panic,’ said Mao. ‘Let me look into this little more carefully.’
He lowered his head in thought and mumbled to himself for a few moments. Then:
  ‘All is well! We are saved! My Compass reveals a “Delivering Spirit” at the Sixth
Branch Si. In other words, what we have here is a “Dissolution of the Soul” leading to
a “Restoration of the Spirit”, or Sorrow turning to Joy. There is therefore no real
cause for concern. You should just exercise a little caution.’
  Jia Rong handed him his fee and saw him off the premises, before returning to
report to his father:
  ‘The fortune-teller says that Mother’s illness was contracted towards evening in an
old building, and was caused by an encounter with a White Tiger spirit emanating
from a corpse.’
   ‘Didn’t you say that she came back through the Garden the other evening?’ said
Cousin Zhen. ‘It must have been there that she ran into this thing. And didn’t your
aunt Feng go walking in the Garden too, and fall ill afterwards? She denied having
encountered anything out of the ordinary, but the maids and serving-women all told
a different story. They said she’d seen a hairy monster up on a hill, with eyes as big as
lanterns, and that she’d even heard it talk. It gave your aunt Feng such a fright that
she went running home, and immediately fell ill and took to her bed.’
   ‘Of course!’ exclaimed Jia Rong. ‘I remember! And I heard Bao-yu’s boy Tealeaf say
that Skybright had turned into a Hibiscus Fairy. So she must be haunting the Garden,
for a start. And when Cousin Lin died, music was heard in the air, so she’s probably
there somewhere too, looking after some other flower. Ugh! It makes your flesh
creep, to think of all the sprites and fairies there must be cooped up in there! It used
to be perfectly safe when there were plenty of people living there and the place had
a feeling of life about it. But now it’s so dashed lonely! When Mother went through,
she probably trod on one of the flowers, or bumped into one of the fairies. It sounds
as if Mao’s Hexagram was on the mark all right.’
   ‘Did he talk of any real danger?’ asked Cousin Zhen.
   ‘According to him, by the day Xu all will be well. I must say, though, I hope his
calculations don’t turn out to be too accurate...’
   ‘What do you mean?’ asked Cousin Zhen.
   ‘Well, if he’s right, then there could be some trouble in store for you too, Father.’
   As they were talking, there came a cry from one of the serving-women in the inner
apartments:
   ‘Mrs Zhen insists on getting up and going to the Garden! The maids can’t hold her
down.
   Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong went in to pacify You-shi.
   ‘The one in red is coming to get me!’ she screamed deliriously. ‘The one in green is
after me!’
   The servants found her behaviour at once funny and frightening. Cousin Zhen
depatched one of them to buy paper money, and burn it in the Garden. That night
You-shi came out in a sweat and calmed down considerably, and by the day Xu she
gradually started to recover.
   Word soon spread that Prospect Garden was haunted, and the caretakers became
too frightened to carry out their duties. Plants were left untended, trees unpruned,
and all the flower-beds unwatered. No one dared walk around after dark, and as a
result the resident wildlife began to make it their own domain. Thing eventually got
so bad that even in broad daylight the servants would enter the Garden only
accompanied and armed with cudgels.
   After a few days, Cousin Zhen fell ill as predicted. He did not send for a doctor.
Whenever the illness permitted, he went to the Garden to pray and burn paper
money; whenever it became severe, he uttered feverish prayers in his chamber. He
recovered, and then it was Jia Rong’s turn to go down; and after Jia Rong, the others,
one by one. This continued for several months, and both households lived in
constant fear. Even the slightest rustle or cry of a bird was suspect, and every plant or
tree was feared to harbour a malicious spirit. Now that the Garden was abandoned
and no longer productive, extra funds were needed again for the various apartments
of the household, and this added to the already crushing deficit of Rong-guo House.
The Garden’s caretakers saw nothing to be gained by staying. They all wanted to
leave the place, and invented a whole series of incidents to substantiate the presence
of diabolical tree-imps and flower sprites. Eventually they achieved their goal: they
were all evacuated, the garden gate was securely locked, and no one dared go in at
all. Fine halls, lofty pavilions, elegant rooms and terraces became nothing more than
nesting-places for birds and lairs for wild beasts.

*

Skybright’s cousin, Wu Gui, lived, it will be remembered, opposite the rear
gate-house of the Garden. It had reached the ears of Wu Gui’s wife that Skybright,
after her death, had become a flower fairy, and from then on she took the precaution
of staying indoors every evening. One day Wu Gui went shopping and stayed out
later than usual. His wife had caught a slight cold and during the day took the wrong
medicine, with the result that when Wu Gui returned that evening he found her lying
dead on the kang. Because of her reputation for promiscuity, other members of the
household staff concluded that a sprite must have climbed over the Garden wall,
enjoyed her at inordinate length, and finally ‘sucked the sap’ out of her.
   This incident put Grandmother Jia in a great tizzy. She increased the guard around
Bao-yu’s apartment and had it constantly watched and patrolled. Some of the
younger maids subsequently claimed to have seen weird red-faced creatures lurking
in the vicinity, while others testified to the presence of a strange female apparition of
great beauty. Such rumours soon multiplied, and Bao-yu lived in mortal terror.
Bao~chai was less easily taken in, and warned the maids that any more
fear-mongering would bring them a good hiding. Although this quietened things
down a bit, there was still an atmosphere of great apprehension throughout both
mansions, and more watchmen were taken on, which was an additional expense.
   Jia She was the only one not to believe a word of it.
   ‘There’s nothing the matter with the Garden, for heaven’s sake! Haunted! What an
absurd notion!’
   He waited for a warm day when there was a mild breeze, and went to inspect the
Garden himself, accompanied by a large number of armed servants. They all advised
him against going, but he would not listen. When they entered the Garden, the
atmosphere was so dark and sinister, so oppressively Yin, that they could almost
touch it. Jia She refused to turn back, and his servants reluctantly followed him in,
with many a furtive and shrinking sideways glance. One young lad among them,
already scared to death, heard a sudden ‘whoosh!’, and turning to look saw
something brightly coloured go flashing past. He uttered a terrified ‘Aiyo!’, went
instantly weak at the knees and collapsed on the ground. When Jia She looked back
and stopped to question him, he replied breathlessly:
   ‘I saw it with my own eyes! I did! A monster with a yellow face and a red beard, all
dressed in green! It went up there, into that grotto behind those trees!’
   Jia She was somewhat shaken himself.
   ‘Did anyone else see this thing?’
   Some of the servants decided to take advantage of the situation and replied:
   ‘Clear as daylight, sir. You were up in front and we didn’t want to alarm you, sir. So
we tried to keep a grip on ourselves, and act as if nothing had happened.’
   Jia She now lacked the courage to go any further. He turned back and went home
as quickly as possible, telling the boys who had accompanied him not to say anything
about what had happened, but merely to let it be known that they had had an
uneventful tour of the Garden. He himself needed no further convincing that the
Garden was haunted, and began to think it might be advisable to apply to the Taoist
Pontificate for priests to perform an exorcism. His servants, meanwhile, who were by
nature fond of making trouble, saw how frightened their master was, and far from
concealing the episode, retailed it with a great deal of gusto and embellishment,
creating quite a sensation and eliciting a good deal of open-mouthed astonish?ment.
  In the end Jia She decided that there was no other recourse than to go ahead and
hold a formal ceremony of exorcism. A suitable day in the almanac was chosen, and
an altar was constructed in the Garden, on a dais in the main hall of the Reunion
Palace. Images of the Three Pure Ones were set up, flanked by figures of the spirits
presiding over each of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and of the Four Great
Commanders- Ma, Zhao, Wen and Zhou. Further down the hall, the sacred precinct
was made complete with a diagrammatic repre?sentation of the Thirty-Six Heavenly
Generals. The air was heavy with flowers and incense, the hall blazed with lanterns
and candles. Bells, drums, liturgical instruments and other paraphernalia were
arrayed along both sides of the hall, and emblematic banners were hoisted at each of
the Five Cardinal Points (the Four Corners and the Centre). The Taoist Pontiff had
delegated Forty-Nine Deacons for the ceremony, and they began by spending a
whole day purifying the altar. Then three priests went the rounds of the hall, waving
smoking bundles of joss-sticks and sprinkling holy water, and when this was done the
great Drum of the Dharma thundered forth. The priests now donned their Seven Star
Mitres and robed themselves in their chasubles emblazoned with the Nine Heavenly
Mansions and the Eight Trigrams. Wearing Cloud-Mounting Pattens on their feet and
holding ivory tablets in their hands, they addressed themselves in reverent
supplication to the sages. For a full day they chanted the Arcanum Primordii, a text
renowned for its efficacy in the dispelling of misfortune, the exorcizing of evil spirits
and the general en?hancement of propitious vibrations. Then they produced the
Spirit Roll, which called on the Heavenly Generals to be present. It was inscribed with
the following large characters:

A SUMMONS

IN THE NAME

OF THE

THREE REALMS,

THE ULTIMATE, THE PRIMORDIAL, AND THE PURE;

IN THE NAME

OF THE

SUPREME PONTIFF

AND THE

TALISMANIC POWER VESTED IN HIM;

ALL BENEVOLENT SPIRITS OF THE REGION

ARE HEREBY CALLED TO THIS ALTAR
TO DO SERVICE

The menfolk of both Rong-guo and Ning-guo House had taken courage from the
presence of the priests, and were gathered in the Garden to watch the demon-hunt.
   ‘Most impressive!’ they all agreed. ‘All those benevolent spirits and powers are
bound to strike fear into the heart of even the most obdurate demon!’
   They crowded in front of the altar to watch the rest of the pro?ceedings. The
young banner-bearing Deacons took up their positions in the hall, one group at each
of the Five Cardinal Points, North, East, South, West and Centre, and awaited their
orders. The three priests stood on the lower steps of the altar: one held the Magic
Sword and the Holy Water, one the black Seven Star Banner, and one the
peach-wood Demon Whip. The music ceased. The gong sounded thrice, the monks
intoned a prayer, and the cohorts of banner-bearers began performing circular
gyrations. The priests then descended from the altar and instructed the Jia menfolk
to conduct them to every storeyed building, studio, hall, pavilion, chamber, cottage
or covered walk, every hillside and water’s edge in the Garden. In each place they
sprinkled the Holy Water and brandished the Magic Sword. On their return, the gong
rang out again, the Seven Star Banner was raised aloft and consecrated, and as it
de?scended the Deacons formed a phalanx around it with their lesser banners, and
the Demon Whip was cracked three times in the air.
   This, thought the Jias, must be the climactic moment; now at last the entire
company of evil spirits would be routed and captured. They thronged forward to be
in at the finish. But nothing seemed to happen. No apparition, no sound; only the
voice of one of the priests, ordering the Deacons to ‘bring on the jars’. These
receptacles were duly ‘brought on’, and in them the priests proceeded to ‘confine’
the invisible spirits, sealing them afterwards with official seals. The Abbot inscribed
some magical characters in vermilion, and put the jars to one side, giving orders that
they should be taken back to the temple. There they were to be placed beneath a
pagoda, whose geomantic location would ensure that they and their contents were
safely ‘contained’. The temporary altar was dismantled and thanks given to the
Heavenly Powers. Jia She made a solemn kowtow of gratitude to the Abbot.
   Afterwards Jia Rong and the younger men of the family had a good laugh about it
all in private:
   ‘All that pantomime to catch the evil spirits! They might at least have let us have a
look! What a farce! They probably didn’t manage to catch a single one!’
   ‘Fools!’ snapped Cousin Zhen, when he heard this. ‘Evil spirits don’t behave like
that at all. At certain times they condense into crude matter, at others they dissolve
into the ether. With so many benevolent spirits present of course they wouldn’t dare
take on material form. It’s their etheric form that’s in question here. That is what
Their Holinesses have taken hold of; by so doing they have rendered the spirits
harmless. That is how the magic works.’
   The younger generation were only half-convinced, and reserved their judgement
until such time as they could observe a more visible diminution in demonic activity;
the servants, who were told quite firmly that the spirits had now been caught,
became less apprehensive as a result, and no further incidents or sightings were
reported; while Cousin Zhen and the other invalids made a complete recovery (which
they had no hesitation in attributing to the efficacy of the monks’ spells).
   There was, however, one page-boy who continued to find the whole episode
highly amusing, and who shared his amusement with the others:
   ‘I don’t know what the earlier business was about, but that day we were in the
Garden with Sir She, it was nothing more than a big pheasant that took off out of the
undergrowth and went flying past us. Old Ropey got the fright of his life and thought
he’d seen a ghost or something. He made a great song and dance about it afterwards.
Most of the others believed him and backed him up, and Sir She swallowed the
whole thing. Oh well, at least they put on a nice bit of mumbo-jumbo for us!’
   But no one was convinced by his version of the story. And certainly no one was
willing to live in the Garden again.

*

Some days later, when things had quietened down somewhat, Jia She thought he
might discreetly move a few servants back into the Garden as caretakers, to make
sure that no undesirable characters tried to sneak their way in there at night. He was
about to issue instructions to this effect when Jia Lian came in.
   ‘I have just been to visit Uncle Wang Zi-teng’s family,’ he said, after paying his
respects, ‘and while I was there I heard the most devastating piece of news. Uncle
Zheng has apparently been im?peached by the Viceroy! The charge against him is
that he failed to control his subordinates and was responsible for the requisitioning
of extortionate quantities of tax-grain. The Viceroy has asked for his dismissal.’
   Jia She was stunned:
   ‘This must surely be some idle rumour. Why, there was a letter from your uncle
Zheng only the other day. Full of good news. He wrote that Tan-chun had arrived
safely, and that he had chosen a suitable day to escort her to her future husband’s
family on the coast. The journey had passed off without mishap. Absolutely no cause
for concern. What’s more, the Viceroy is supposed to be related to Tan?chun’s
husband, and even gave a party to celebrate the wedding. How could the man
impeach his own relative? Well, it’s no use speculating like this: you’d better go and
see the Civil Office people. Find out what you can, and report straight back to me.’
  Jia Lian departed at once, and returned a few hours later.
  ‘It’s as I feared, Father. Uncle Zheng has been impeached. How?ever, as an act of
Imperial clemency his case did not go through the normal channels, but was dealt
with directly by His Majesty. I have the exact wording of the Imperial Rescript:

  On account of Jia Zheng’s failure to control subordinate officials, and on account of
the extortionate levying of tax-grain and cruel exploitation of the common people
perpetrated under his administration, he deserves to he dismissed altogether. But
because this is his first provincial posting, and because he is inexperienced as an
administrator and has in this matter been deceived by his own subordinates, he is
only to be demoted three grades, and by a special dispensation will be reinstated as
Under-Secretary in the Board of Works. He is to return at once to the capital.

   ‘This news is official. While I was at the Board of Civil Office a county magistrate
from Kiangsi came for an audience. He said he was indebted to Uncle Zheng in many
ways and had a high opinion of him, but considered him an inept manager of people.
His servants got up to all sorts of skulduggery behind his back, and were squeezing
the local officials for all they were worth. Uncle’s reputation was already ruined. The
Viceroy had known about it for some time, and he too was of the opinion that Uncle
Zheng was basically a good man. I don’t know quite why he brought the
impeachment in the end. Perhaps he was afraid that things had got out of hand and
that more serious trouble might lie ahead. In using this relatively minor charge as
grounds for impeachment, maybe he was really trying to save Uncle Zheng from an
even worse fate.’
  Jia She interrupted Jia Lian:
  ‘Go and tell your aunt Wang about this straight away. But don’t trouble your
grandmother at present.’
  So Jia Lian went to report to Lady Wang. For the sequel, please turn to the next
chapter.

CHAPTER 103

Jin-gui dies by her own hand, caught
in a web of her own weaving
Yu-cun encounters an old friend in vain, blind
to the higher truths of Zen




Jia Lian gave Lady Wang a full account of Jia Zheng’s misfortune. The next day he paid
another call at the Board of Civil Office, and on his return reported once more to
Lady Wang, assuring her that he had done his utmost to put in a word for Jia Zheng in
the right quarters.
   ‘So you’re sure the news is genuine?’ she asked. ‘Well, I dare say your Uncle Zheng
will be none too displeased. In fact it will come as something of a relief to us all. He
was never really suited to a provincial posting, and if he had not come home now I’m
afraid those rascals would one day have ruined him altogether!’
   ‘How is it that you are so well informed in this matter?’ asked Jia Lian.
   ‘Ever since your uncle Zheng has been at this post,’ replied Lady Wang, ‘not a
penny has been remitted. On the contrary, he has been secretly sending here for
considerable sums. You have only to look at the way the servants’ wives are already
decking themselves out in all sorts of fancy gold and silver ornaments to know what’s
been going on. It’s obvious that their husbands have been making money behind
your uncle Zheng’s back. He just lets them get away with it. If it had gone any further,
not only would he have lost his job but the inherited family rank might have been
forfeited as well!’
   ‘You’re quite right, Aunt,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I confess that I was very shocked when I
first heard the news. But now that I know the full facts of the case I feel considerably
easier about it. It will be much better for Uncle Zheng this way. He will be able to
work here in the capital in peace and quiet for a few years, without endangering his
reputation any further. I think even Grandmother will be quite relieved when she
hears the whole story. But I feel you should break it gently to her all the same.’
   ‘I will,’ said Lady Wang. ‘You had better go now and see what else you can find
out.’
   Jia Lian was on his way out when one of Aunt Xue’s old serving-women came
running past in a great lather. She went directly into Lady Wang’s apartment and
without any preliminary courtesies burst straight out with: ‘Our Madam says I’m to
tell Your Ladyship there’s terrible trouble at home again! Things have come to a
pretty pass this time and no mistake!’
   ‘What sort of trouble?’ asked Lady Wang.
   ‘Oh, something terrible! Just terrible!’
   ‘You stupid old creature!’ exclaimed Lady Wang with a snort of exasperation. ‘If
something serious has happened, for goodness’ sake try to tell me what it is!’
  ‘Master Ke’s away and we haven’t got a man in the house! It’s a crisis and we just
don’t know what to do! Please will Your Ladyship send one or two of the Masters
over to sort it out for us!’
  Lady Wang still had not the slightest idea what she was talking about.
  ‘Sort out what in heaven’s name?’ she asked impatiently.
  ‘It’s Mrs Pan! She’s dead!’ blurted out the old woman at last.
‘Pfui!’ exclaimed Lady Wang when she heard this. ‘So that baggage is dead! Is that
what all the fuss is about?’
   ‘But it wasn’t reg’lar, Your Ladyship. I mean, the way she died. Such a to-do! Please,
Your Ladyship, send someone over right away!’
   She set off back to the Xue compound. Lady Wang was both annoyed and amused:
   ‘Honestly, what a hopeless old woman! Lian, go and have a look will you? It’s a
complete waste of time trying to make head or tail of anything that old creature
says.’
   The first part, about ‘going and having a look’, failed to reach the old woman’s ears.
She only caught the words ‘a complete waste of time’ and went running home in a
great huff to Aunt Xue, who was anxiously awaiting her return:
   ‘Well, who is Lady Wang going to send?’
   The old woman sighed demonstratively:
   ‘Fat lot of use family are at a time of crisis, I must say! Her Ladyship wouldn’t lift a
finger for us! All she did was call me a stupid creature!’
   This seemed to make Aunt Xue angry, and she became rather flustered:
   ‘If Her Ladyship wouldn’t help, what about our own Mrs Bao?’
   ‘I didn’t even bother to tell her,’ replied the old woman. ‘How could she be
expected to stand up for us if Her Ladyship wouldn’t?’
  Aunt Xue spat at her, and cried indignantly:
  ‘Are you out of your mind? Her Ladyship is one of the Jias; but Bao-chai is my own
child. She wouldn’t let me down!’
  The distinction suddenly seemed to dawn on the old woman.
  ‘Lawks! I’d better go back and find her right away!’
  As they were speaking, Jia Lian came in. He paid his respects to Aunt Xue, and after
expressing his condolences went on to explain to her:
  ‘When Aunt Wang heard that Mrs Pan was dead, she questioned your
serving-woman but was unable to extract any sense from her at all. Aunt was very
worried and sent me to find out what was going on and to give you a hand. If
anything needs doing, Aunt Xue, just let me know and I’ll do what I can.’
  Aunt Xue had been working herself into a state of great indig?nation with the old
woman, and had become so distraught she could do nothing but weep. On hearing
Jia Lian’s words she became articulate once more:
   ‘I’m most obliged to you, Lian. I was sure my sister would stand by me. I’m afraid
this old woman completely misunderstood you, and gave me a totally misleading
impression. Now, please sit down and let me tell you the whole story.’
   After a slight pause she continued: ‘How shall I put it...? Well, in a nutshell, my
daughter-in-law did not die a natural death.’
   ‘I suppose it was suicide?’ ventured Jia Lian. ‘Was it despondency at Cousin Pan’s
imprisonment that drove her to take her own life?’
   ‘If only it had been! Alas, no. Let me explain. For several months she’d been
rampaging about the whole time, barefoot and with her hair in a terrible state. When
she heard that Pan was facing a death sentence, after an initial fit of weeping she
began painting herself up dreadfully with rouge and powder. Any remonstrations on
my part would only have led to more atrocious scenes, so I tried to turn a blind eye.
Then suddenly one day, for some reason unknown to me, she came and asked me if
she could have Caltrop to keep her com?pany. I said to her: “You’ve already got
Moonbeam. Do you really need Caltrop as well? You’ve never liked her, so why go
asking for trouble?’ But she insisted, and I had no choice but to send Caltrop over to
her room. The poor girl didn’t dare disobey my orders and she went, ill though she
was.
   ‘Funnily enough, my daughter-in-law treated her very well. I was delighted; and
although Chai suspected some ulterior motive, I was prepared to give her the benefit
of the doubt. Anyway, a few days ago, Caltrop fell ill again, and Jin-gui cooked her
some soup. She even made a point of serving it to her with her own hands. Poor
Caltrop! There was the most unfortunate accident. Jin-gui dropped the soup just as
she was coming up to the bedside, scalded herself and broke the bowl as well. I
would have expected her to have blamed Caltrop; but no, she wasn’t in the least
angry, just went off at once to fetch a broom, swept up the pieces and gave the floor
a good clean. Afterwards the two of them still seemed on friendly terms.
   ‘Then yesterday evening she told Moonbeam to go and make two bowls of soup,
which she said she would drink with Caltrop. It was a little later that we heard this
terrific hullabaloo coming from her apartment. First Moonbeam started screaming
her head off, then Caltrop screamed too and staggered out, leaning on the wall for
support and calling for help. I went in at once and found Jin-gui writhing on the floor,
with blood streaming from her nose and eyes; she was clutching feverishly at her
stomach with both hands, and kicking both feet in the air. I was scared out of my wits.
I asked her to tell me what had happened, but she was too far gone to answer, and
after a few more minutes of agony she died. It looked very much like a case of
poisoning to me.
   ‘Then Moonbeam started wailing again and laid hold of Caltrop, claiming that it
was her doing. But I hardly think Caltrop is that sort of person. Besides, she was
almost too ill to get out of bed; how could she have had the strength to do such a
thing? Moonbeam insisted, however, and still insists, that Caltrop is the culprit. My
dear Lian! What was I to do? In the circumstances I had no choice but to tell the old
women to bind Caltrop, to hand her over to Moonbeam and to lock them both in the
room. Bao-qin and I have been up all night keeping watch, and we sent word to you
the moment the gates were opened this morning. Lian, you know about such things.
What’s the proper course of action for me to take?’
   ‘Do Jin-gui’s family know yet?’ asked Jia Lian.
   ‘I thought it better to try to disentangle the whole affair ourselves before letting
anyone know.’
   ‘I would advise you to report what’s happened to the authorities first and let them
reach their own conclusions. It’s only natural that we should suspect Moonbeam, but
they might ask what Moonbeam would have stood to gain by poisoning her own
mistress. And in a way it might almost seem more plausible to them that Caltrop
should have done it.’
   As they were speaking, some serving-women from Rong-guo House came in to
announce the arrival of Bao-chai. Jia Lian decided that, although strictly speaking she
was his younger cousin’s wife, he need not withdraw; after all, she was also his
cousin and he had known her from childhood. She greeted her mother and Jia Lian,
and went in to sit with Bao-qin in the inner room. Aunt Xue joined her there and told
her the story.
   ‘Surely, by binding Caltrop we are virtually admitting her guilt?’ was Bao-chai’s
immediate response. ‘If Moonbeam made the soup, then she should be bound. And
we must let the Xia family know, and report the death to the authorities.’
   This seemed logical enough to Aunt Xue. She asked Jia Lian for his opinion:
   ‘Chai is absolutely right. I’d better go and have a word with someone at the Board
of Punishment, to make sure there’s no trouble at the inquest. But I think it will be a
bit hard to justify releasing Caltrop if we then bind Moonbeam instead.’
   ‘I never wanted to bind Caltrop in the first place,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but I was afraid
that this unjust accusation, coming on top of her illness, might drive her to desperate
measures. She might try to commit suicide, and then we’d have another death on our
hands. It was for her own safety that I tied her up and handed her over to
Moonbeam.’
   ‘Quite,’ said Jia Lian. ‘But still, we have rather played into Moonbeam’s hands. I
think our principle now must be that, if one of them is bound, both must be bound; if
one is set free, both must be set free. They were both present at the time of Jin-gui’
s death. Meanwhile we must send someone to comfort Caltrop.’
   Aunt Xue told her serving-woman to open the door of Jin-gui’s apartment and go
in, while Bao-chai ordered some of her own women to accompany them and help
them tie up Moonbeam. When they arrived they found Caltrop sobbing her heart out
and Moonbeam gloating over her. Moonbeam fought back tooth and nail when they
laid hands on her, but the women were too strong. After much shouting from
Moonbeam they tied her up, and left the door open so that the two suspects could
be more conveniently watched over.
   Word had already been sent to Jin-gui’s family. The Xias had originally lived outside
the capital, but recently their circumstances had become much reduced, and partly
for this reason, partly to be near Jin-gui, they had moved into town. Jin-gui’s father
was already dead, and the only surviving members of her family were her mother
and her newly adopted brother, Xia San, a ne’er-do-well who had succeeded in
squandering what remained of the family’s resources. Now that they were living in
town, he became a frequent visitor at the Xue household. Jin-gui was a fickle
creature, little suited to the role of the faithful, pining wife. Her failure to entrap Xue
Ke had left her ravenous for the slightest morsel, and now even this adopted brother
of hers seemed an acceptable means of assuaging her desire. Xia San, however, was a
trifle on the slow side, and although he sensed her intentions soon enough, held
back from steering his craft directly into her capacious harbour. Jin-gui paid more and
more frequent visits to her family, taking with her presents of money to pave the way
for Xia San’s eventual capitulation.
   On the day in question, the day after Jin-gui’s sudden death, he was eagerly
awaiting one of these visits, and when the Xue servants arrived, he assumed that
they had been sent by his sister to deliver one of her little parcels. When they told
him instead that she was dead, and that it was, by all accounts, a case of poisoning,
he flew into a storm and began ranting and raving at them. Mrs Xia, when she heard
the news, wept volubly:
   ‘She was doing quite nicely for herself there! What could she possibly want to go
and take poison for? It must have been one of them that did it!’
   Still weeping and protesting loudly, she called Xia San to accompany her, and set
off at once on foot, without waiting to send for a carriage. The Xias were originally
business-people with little breeding, and now that they were poor had no residual
concern for appearances. Xia San went ahead, and his adoptive mother followed him
out of the gate, weeping and wailing all the while, accompanied by a lame old
serving-woman. She eventually hailed a rickety old cart that was passing in the street,
and it carried them at full speed to the Xue compound, where she went in without a
word of greeting, sobbing, ‘My child! My darling!’
   Jia Lian had gone to enlist support at the Board of Punishment, and Aunt Xue,
Bao-chai and Bao-qin were holding the fort on their own. Mrs Xia’s dramatic entry
quite nonplussed them, and at first they were too frightened to say anything.
Bao-chai and Bao-qin withdrew to the inner room. When Aunt Xue tried to reason
with the intruders, Mrs Xia completely ignored her.
   ‘What good has my daughter ever had from this family of yours?’ she cried. ‘Day
and night she’s had to put up with beatings and abuse. In the end you decided to
separate her from her husband come what may, and even managed to get my
son-in-law locked up in prison. You and your daughter were comfortable enough,
thanks to all those important relatives of yours, but my daughter’s very existence was
still a thorn in your flesh, so you wanted to get rid of her for good and finally found
someone to poison her. Poisoned herself indeed!’
   She lunged at Aunt Xue, who backed out of her way, exclaiming:
   ‘Mrs Xia! Kindly go and examine your daughter for yourself and speak to
Moonbeam first, before making such wild accusations!’
   As Xia San was still there in the room, lurking in the back?ground, Bao-chai and
Bao-qin were unable to come to Aunt Xue’s defence and could only remain anxiously
closeted in the inner room. By a fortunate coincidence, however, Lady Wang had just
sent Zhou Rui’s wife over to see how things were. When she came in and saw this
elderly woman abusing and threatening Aunt Xue, she deduced that it must be
Jin-gui’s mother and approached her at once:
   ‘Would you be Mrs Xia, ma’am? I suppose you know that Mrs Pan took poison?
That’s how she died, and it has nothing whatever to do with Mrs Xue. There is really
no call for you to slander her in this way!’
   ‘And who might you be?’ asked Jin-gui’s mother.
   Aunt Xue, her confidence a little restored by the arrival of rein?forcements,
answered for Mrs Zhou:
   ‘This good woman works for our relations the Jias.’
   ‘Oh! Does she now?’ sneered Mrs Xia. ‘We all know about your wonderful
relations! No doubt it’s thanks to them that you managed to get your own son locked
up in gaol. And now I suppose you are hoping to get away scot-free with the murder
of my daughter too!’
   She seized Aunt Xue.
   ‘Out with it!’ she cried. ‘How did you do it? Let me see the body.’
   Zhou Rui’s wife attempted to pacify her:
   ‘By all means. Go and have a look. But kindly take your hands off Mrs Xue!’
   She finally succeeded in puffing Mrs Xia away from Aunt Xue. Xia San now
emerged from the shadows to leap to his mother’s rescue:
  ‘Think you can attack my mother like this and get away with it just because you’re
one of their servants?’
  He threw a chair at Mrs Zhou, which luckily missed. The servants who were with
Bao-chai in the inner room heard this rumpus break out and came hurrying in to see
what was happening. Fearing that Mrs Zhou might come off worst in the fray, they all
surged forward and tried to calm the combatants down. Their threats and
cajolements were in vain: mother and son merely grew more strident in their
protestations and more desperate in their actions.
  ‘We don’t need reminding how powerful your Rong-guo relations are! What do we
care! Now that Jin-gui’s gone, we might as well fight it out to the death!’
  Mrs Xia charged at Aunt Xue again with all her might. Despite their numbers, the
servants could not withstand her. As the saying goes:

If a man stakes all on his attack,
Ten thousand men won’t hold him back.

   It was at this moment of crisis that Jia Lian returned, accompanied by seven or
eight servants. Seeing how things stood, he ordered his men to drag Xia San outside,
and told the ladies to stop fighting at once:
   ‘Surely you can settle your differences in a more civilized fashion? Now, tidy the
place up. The officers from the Board of Punishments will be here any minute to
conduct the inquest.’
   Mrs Xia had been in full spate when Jia Lian made his entrance. She was somewhat
overawed by this strange gentleman with his retinue of servants, some of whom
were already barking orders while others stood respectfully to attention, and she
wondered which member of the Jia family it could be. Then she saw her adopted son
taken away, and heard that the Board of Punishments had been informed and would
shortly be holding an inquest, which ruined all her plans. She had originally intended
to inspect her daughter’s corpse, create a terrific fuss and go crying for justice; but
now they had beaten her to it, and the wind was quite taken out of her sails. Aunt
Xue for her part was too frightened to do anything. It was Mrs Zhou who said to Jia
Lian:
   ‘These people barged in, and without so much as a look at Mrs Pan this lady began
to slander Mrs Xue. We tried to talk some sense into her, but then this ruffian butted
in, and started using the most dreadful language in front of the young ladies. What a
shocking way to carry on!’
   ‘There’s no point arguing with him now,’ replied Jia Lian. ‘It would only be a waste
of time. When they question him under torture, he’ll remember soon enough that
the inner apartments are strictly reserved for women and that he has no right to be
in here. His mother could surely have come to inspect her daughter’s corpse by
herself. It will look extremely suspicious to the authorities, very much as if he had
come to rob the place.’
   Jia Lian’s men managed by one means or another to keep Xia San under control
outside, while Mrs Zhou, emboldened by the presence of so many Jia supporters,
began denouncing Mrs Xia in earnest:
   ‘Really, madam, you should know better. You should have found out the facts when
you arrived. Your daughter must have poisoned herself. The only other person it
could have been is Moonbeam. Why go slandering without bothering to find out the
truth and without so much as seeing the corpse for yourself? Do you think ours is the
kind of family to stand by and let a daughter-in-law die without discovering the cause
of her death?
   ‘Moonbeam and Caltrop have both been bound. Your daughter had asked for
Caltrop to move into her room earlier, because she said she wanted to keep an eye
on her illness. That’s why Caltrop was also there at the time of Mrs Pan’s death. We
were hoping that you could be present at the inquest and hear the officer establish
the truth of the matter.’
   Jin-gui’s mother knew that she was beaten, and she followed Zhou Rui’s wife into
Jin-gui’s apartment. She saw her daughter’s corpse lying stiff on the kang, the face
caked in dry blood, and at once broke down and began sobbing. Moonbeam, seeing
someone from ‘her side’, cried out:
   ‘Madam was so kind to Caltrop! She even shared her own room with her! But
Caltrop grabbed the first chance that came along of poisoning her!’
  The Xue family and servants raised a cry of protest:
  ‘Nonsense! Who was it cooked the soup that Mrs Pan drank before she died? You!’
  ‘I cooked it and served it,’ said Moonbeam, ‘but then I had to go out on an errand.
Caltrop must have got up and put poison in the soup while I was out.’
  Before Moonbeam could finish speaking Jin-gui’s mother lunged at Caltrop and
could only be restrained by the concerted efforts of the servants. Aunt Xue spoke
next:
  ‘This looks very much like a case of arsenic poisoning to me. We certainly don’t
keep any arsenic in the house. Whoever it was that did this must have commissioned
someone else to buy the poison in town. The truth will come out at the inquest. Well,
we’d best tidy her up and lay her out properly now in readiness for the officer from
the Board of Punishments.’
  The old serving-women came forward, lifted Jin-gui up and laid her out.
  ‘With so many men about,’ said Bao-chai, ‘you had better clear away all those
women’s knick-knacks.’
   As they were tidying up, a little crumpled paper package came to light beneath the
mattress on the kang. Jin-gui’s mother spotted it and picked it up to inspect it more
closely. It was empty and she threw it down again. Moonbeam saw it, however, and
cried out:
   ‘Look! There’s evidence! I recognize that package. A few days ago we were having
a lot of trouble with mice, and when Mrs Pan went on one of her trips home, she
asked her brother to buy some poison. It was in that package. I remember her
putting it away in one of her jewellery boxes when she got back. Caltrop must have
seen it there and used it to poison Mrs Pan. If you don’t believe me, have a look in
the jewellery box and see if there’s any left.’
   Jin-gui’s mother did this. She opened the jewellery box, which was empty save for
a few silver hairpins.
   ‘What has become of all her jewellery?’ said Aunt Xue in surprise.
   Bao-chai told the servants to open the trunks and cupboards. All were empty.
   ‘Who could have taken all these things?’ she asked. ‘We had better question
Moonbeam.’
   Jin-gui’s mother seemed to become very apprehensive all of a sudden.
   ‘Why should Moonbeam know about my daughter’s things?’ she protested.
   ‘Come, ma’am,’ put in Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘that’s hardly a very sen?sible question.
Miss Moonbeam was with Mrs Pan all the time. Of course she’d know.’
   Moonbeam could see she was cornered, and would have to tell the truth:
   ‘Madam used to take things with her whenever she went home. There was
nothing I could do about it.’
   A roar of indignation burst from the Xue camp:
   ‘So that’s it! Really, Mrs Xia! A fine mother you are! You talk your daughter into
stealing our things; and then when the supply runs out, you force her to commit
suicide so that you can blackmail us! They’ll be very interested to hear that at the
inquest!’
   ‘Go outside,’ said Bao-chai, ‘and tell Mr Lian that the Xias must on no account be
allowed to leave.’
   Jin-gui’s mother was now in a state of extreme trepidation, and cursed Moonbeam
roundly:
   ‘You little hussy! You scandal-monger! When did my daughter ever steal any of
their things?’
   ‘Stealing’s nothing,’ retorted Moonbeam coolly, ‘compared to murder; and I don’t
mean to let myself be called a murderer in order to cover up for a thief.’
   ‘If we can find the missing things, we’ll know who the murderer is,’ said Bao-qin.
‘Someone quickly go and find Lian. He can ask that Xia fellow about the buying of the
arsenic. They’ll want to know about that at the inquest.’
   Jin-gui’s mother began to panic:
   ‘Moonbeam must be possessed to speak such nonsense! When did my daughter
ever buy arsenic? If you ask me, it was Moonbeam herself!’
   ‘That’s going too far!’ cried Moonbeam wildly. ‘I’m not taking that - not from you!
Why, it was the two of you who were always telling Mrs Pan to stand up for her rights!
It was you who advised her to make life unbearable for Mr Pan’s family, and then,
when they were ruined, to walk off with every last button in the house and find
herself a decent husband! Do you deny that?’
   Before Jin-gui’s mother could reply, Zhou Rui’s wife cried with glee:
‘Denounced by one of your own servants! Well, what have you got to say for
yourself now?’
   Jin-gui’s mother cursed Moonbeam again, and gnashing her teeth said bitterly:
   ‘Haven’t I treated you well? Are you trying to drive me to the grave? At the inquest,
I shall testify that it was you who did it!’
   Moonbeam glared at her angrily and then turned to Mrs Xue:
   ‘Please release Caltrop, ma’am. There’s no sense in harming an innocent person
like this. I shall tell the whole truth at the inquest.’
   Bao-chai immediately instructed the servants to release Moonbeam instead, and
said:
   ‘Come on, Moonbeam, you’ve always been a straightforward girl. Don’t let
yourself get involved in underhand dealings. You’ll only suffer for it. If you’ve
something to say, then go ahead and say it. Tell us the truth, and the whole affair can
be cleared up once and for all.’
   Moonbeam was terrified of being tortured at the inquest, and finally gave in:
   ‘Every day Mrs Pan used to complain about the way life had treated her. “Why was
I born to such a stupid mother?” she’d say. “Instead of showing me some sense and
marrying me to Master Ke, she went and chose his half-baked booby of a cousin! I’d
gladly die if I could only spend one day with Master Ke!” And then she’d always say
how she hated Caltrop. I didn’t pay much attention at first, and later when I began to
notice how friendly she was being to Caltrop I supposed that Caltrop must have
somehow earned her way back into her good books. I thought Mrs Pan made the
soup for her as a kind gesture. Then I discovered that she had something quite
different in mind! Something horrible!’
   ‘That makes no sense at all!’ interrupted Jin-gui’s mother. ‘If you are implying that
she intended to do away with Caltrop, then how do you account for the fact that she
ended up swallowing the poison herself?’
    Bao-chai turned to Caltrop:
    ‘You tell us what happened yesterday, Caltrop. Did you drink any of the soup?’
  ‘A few days ago,’ began Caltrop, ‘when I was so ill that I could hardly lift my head,
Mrs Pan offered to bring me some soup. I didn’t dare refuse, and I was struggling to
sit up when she had an accident on the way and spilt the soup all over the floor. It
was a lot of trouble for her, cleaning it all up, and I felt very bad to have been the
cause of it. Then yesterday she offered me some soup again, and though I didn’t
think I’d ever be able to swallow any of it, I decided I ought to try. I was just getting
ready to drink some when I started feeling dizzy. I vaguely remember seeing
Moonbeam clear the soup away, and thinking to myself what a relief it was not to
have to drink any. But then, just as I was dozing off again, Mrs Pan came over and
asked me to try some after all. She was drinking a bowl herself. I tried my hardest and
managed to swallow a few mouthfuls.’
    ‘There you are!’ cried Moonbeam, hardly giving Caltrop time to finish. ‘Now let me
complete the picture for you. Yesterday Mrs Pan told me to make two bowls of soup,
one for her and one for Caltrop. I was pretty fed up, that Caltrop should be thought
important enough for me to have to wait on her. So I deliberately put an extra dollop
of salt in one of the bowls, and made a secret mark on the side, intending to give that
bowl to Caltrop. As soon as I had brought the soup in, Mrs Pan told me to go and
send the boys for a carriage, as she was planning to go home on a visit. I went out,
and when I’d done my errand I came back to find Mrs Pan sitting with the salty bowl
in front of her. I was afraid that if she tasted how salty it was she would be very cross
with me. I was wondering what to do, when luckily Mrs Pan left the room for a
moment to relieve herself, and I was able to change the bowls round. It must have
been fated that I should do so. When Mrs Pan came back, she took the salty soup to
Caltrop’s bedside and begged her to try some, drinking some from her own bowl (the
one originally intended by her for Caltrop) at the same time. Caltrop didn’t seem to
notice the salt, and they both finished their bowls. I was laughing to myself, thinking
what a rough palate Caltrop must have. I didn’t realize then that Mrs Pan had plotted
to poison Caltrop and had sprinkled arsenic in her soup while I was out of the room.
And then later while she was outside, I changed the bowls round. And she never
noticed. As the saying goes:

            It all fell out as Providence planned;
            The sinner died by her own hand!’

   They pondered the details of Moonbeam’s story, and it impressed them as both
plausible and consistent. Caltrop was duly released, and they helped her back into
bed.
   Jin-gui’s mother, meanwhile, growing more and more fearful with every minute,
was racking her brains for some way of rebutting Moonbeam’s accusations. After a
good deal of discussion Aunt Xue and the other members of the family concluded
that under the circum?stances Xia San was the one who should be held responsible,
as Jin?-gui’s accomplice. They were still debating heatedly how to deal with the
matter when they heard Jia Lian call from outside:
   ‘No more chatter! Get the place looking decent. The officer from the Board is on
his way.’
   Mrs Xia and her son were frantic. It seemed inevitable that they would come out
badly at the inquest. At last Mrs Xia begged Aunt Xue:
   ‘Please accept my humble apologies. It seems my daughter was misguided in her
ways, and that she has met the end she deserved. If there is an inquest, it will look
bad for your family too. I beg you to let the matter drop!’
   ‘That is out of the question!’ objected Bao-chai. ‘It has already been reported. We
can’t let it drop now.’
   Mrs Zhou offered her services as a mediator: -
   ‘The only way the matter could be dropped would be if Mrs Xia herself were to go
forward and ask them to dispense with the inquest. In that case we wouldn’t raise
any objections.’
   Xia San, who was being held outside, agreed after a certain amount of intimidation
from Jia Lian to intercept the officer and make a written request for suspension of
the inquest. The others all approved this course of action. Aunt Xue gave orders for a
coffin to be pur?chased and for all the other funeral arrangements to be seen to. But
at this point our narrative turns elsewhere.

*

Jia Yu-cun had recently been promoted to the post of Mayor of the Metropolitan
Prefecture, with additional duties as Collector of Taxes. He went out one day on a
tour of inspection of the agricultural area newly brought under cultivation, and his
route took him through the shire of Innsite. When he came to the riverside hamlet of
Rushford Hythe, he halted his sedan at the water’s edge and waited for his servants
to catch up with him, when they would all take the ferry to the other side. He noticed
a small broken-down temple on the out?skirts of the village, with a few gnarled old
pine-trees poking their branches up through the ruins. Stepping down from his sedan,
he wandered over at a leisurely pace and strolled into the temple. The gilt was
peeling from the statues, and the courtyard was in a state of extreme dilapidation. At
one side stood a broken stone tablet with a worn and barely legible inscription.
Yu-cun was crossing the rear courtyard towards the back hall of the temple when he
saw, in the shade of a cypress tree, a lean-to shed with a thatched roof, and inside
the shed a Taoist monk, seated with his eyes closed, deep in meditation. Going closer
and gazing into the man’s face, Yu-cun was struck by a strange familiarity, a feeling of
having seen him some?where before - though where he could not for the moment
recall. His attendants were about to wake the Taoist rudely from his meditations, but
Yu-cun stopped them and, advancing respectfully, addressed him with the words:
  ‘Venerable Master!’
  The Taoist opened both eyes a slit and gave a faint smile.
  ‘What brings you here, sir?’
  ‘A tour of inspection has led me to these parts,’ replied Yu-cun. ‘Seeing your
reverence so rapt in meditation, and deducing from this the profundity of your
spiritual attainments, I most humbly crave from you some words of truth.’
  ‘There is ever a whence, and always a whither.’
  Yu-cun sensed something very mysterious about the old man. Making a deep bow,
he enquired:
  ‘From which monastery does your reverence hail? What is the name of this temple
where you have made your hermitage? How many live here? If it is a life of pure
contemplation that you seek, surely one of the sacred mountains would be a more
conducive dwelling place? And if it is good works that you wish to perform, would
not the busy thoroughfare be more appropriate?’
  ‘A bottle-gourd is ample for my needs,’ replied the Taoist. ‘Why build my hut on
some famous mountain? As for this temple, only a crumbling tablet of stone remains
to point to its long-forgotten origins. And why should I strive to do good works, when
body and shadow suffice? I am no “jewel in the casket” biding “till one should come
to buy”, no “jade-pin in the drawer hid, waiting its time to fly”.’
   Yu-cun had always been a smart fellow. The reference to ‘the bottle-gourd’ and to
his own couplet (written when he had been a poor lodger at the Bottle-gourd Temple
in Soochow) at once brought to mind his neighbour from days gone by, old Zhen
Shi-yin. Scru?tinizing the Taoist again, he recognized him and saw that his old
benefactor’s face had not changed. He dismissed his attendants.
   ‘Tell me the truth, sir,’ he enquired confidentially, when they were alone. ‘Are you
not old Mr Zhen?’
   A faint smile crossed the old man’s face.
   ‘What is truth, and what fiction? You must understand that truth is fiction, and
fiction truth.’
   Yu-cun’s certainty was increased by the fact that the old man’s words contained a
pun on their names, Zhen being homophonous with ‘truth’, and Jia with ‘fiction’. He
bowed afresh and said:
   ‘When your great generosity enabled me to travel to the capital, I enjoyed good
fortune, and thanks to your blessing obtained the highest distinction in my
examinations and was appointed to the very district to which you yourself had
moved. That was where I first learned that you had achieved enlightenment and had
renounced the world, to soar in the realm of the immortals. Although I sought
anxiously to trace your whereabouts, in the end I came to the con?clusion that a
common layman such as myself, soiled with the dust of this mortal world, would
never be granted another chance to behold your holy face. How blessed I am indeed
to have encountered you again! I beg you, holy sir, to relieve my benighted ignorance.
If you deign to accede to my request, allow me to provide for you and accommodate
you in my humble abode close by in the capital, that I may derive daily benefit from
your wisdom.’
   The Taoist rose to his feet and returned the bow.
   ‘Beyond my prayer-mat,’ he replied, ‘I know nothing. Of what Your Honour has just
spoken I have understood not a single word.’
   He resumed his sitting position. Yu-cun began to have misgivings.
   ‘But surely,’ he thought to himself, ‘it must be him? The face, the voice are so
familiar! After these nineteen years his complexion is quite unchanged. It must be
that he has achieved a high degree of spiritual cultivation, and is therefore reluctant
to reveal his former identity. He considers himself a new man. But he is my
benefactor. Now that I have found him again, I must think of some way to show my
gratitude. If material things cannot move him, still less I suppose will any mention of
his wife and child.’
   After reflecting thus, Yu-cun spoke:
   ‘Venerable Sir, I understand that you are reluctant to reveal your former condition.
But can you not vouchsafe your disciple some sign of recognition?’
   He was about to prostrate himself when his attendants came to announce that it
was getting late and he should cross the river at once. Yu-cun was hesitating, when
the Taoist spoke to him again:
   ‘Cross with all speed to the other side, Your Honour. We will meet again. Delay now,
and a storm may arise. If you really deign to come again, I look forward to seeing you
here by the ford another day.’
   He closed his eyes and was lost once more in his meditations. Yu?-cun, with some
reluctance, bade him farewell and made his way out of the temple. He had reached
the bank of the river and was preparing to board the ferry and make the crossing,
when he saw a man running towards him at full pelt.
  To learn who it was, please turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 104

                  Drunken Dime at large again –
               a small fish whips up a mighty storm
              Our Besotted Hero in agony once more –
               a chance thrust quickens a numbed heart




‘The temple you visited has just caught fire, sir!’
Jia Yu-cun turned round, to see flames leaping from the ground and a cloud of
whirling ashes darkening the sky.
‘How extraordinary!’ he thought to himself. ‘I left the place only minutes ago, and
have walked but this little distance. How could such a fire have started? What if old
Mr Zhen has perished in it?’
To return and investigate would almost certainly make him late for the ferry. On the
other hand he felt a little uneasy about not going back at all. After a moment’s
thought, he asked the man:
‘Did you notice whether the old Taoist managed to escape or not?’
  ‘I was not far behind you, sir. I had a stomach-ache, and went for a bit of a stroll.
That was when I looked back. When I saw the blaze and realized it was the temple
that was on fire, I came here as fast as I could to let you know. I certainly didn’t see
anyone coming out of the flames.’
    His twinge of conscience notwithstanding, Yu-cun was at heart a man who put his
career first, and he felt insufficient concern to involve (and inconvenience) himself
any further.
    ‘Wait here until the fire has died down,’ he told the servant. ‘Then go back and see
if you can find any trace of the old man. Report to me directly.’
    ‘Yes, sir.’ Reluctantly the man stayed behind to carry out these instructions.
    Jia Yu-cun crossed the river and continued his tour of inspection, putting up for the
night, a few stops later, at the official lodgings provided. Next morning, his duties
were completed and he was greeted at one of the city gates by the usual throng of
runners, who then escorted him through the streets with a great deal of noise and
pomp. On the way, he heard from within his sedan one of the criers having some kind
of altercation in the street, and asked what the trouble was. A man was dragged
forward and deposited kneeling at the foot of the sedan. The crier himself then fell to
his knees and gave the following account of the incident:
   ‘This drunkard, instead of keeping out of Your Honour’s way, came lurching right in
front of your chair, sir. I told him to get off the road, but he answered back in a
drunken and insolent manner, threw himself down on the ground in the middle of
the street, and accused me of hitting him.’
   Jia Yu-cun addressed the offender directly:
   ‘This entire district, as you know, is in my charge, and every one of its residents
falls under my jurisdiction. You, sir, must have known this only too well, and must
also have been aware of my presence in these parts. In your drunken state the very
least you could have done was to keep out of my way. But instead you have polluted
the highway with your obnoxious person, and have then had the effrontery to
slander one of my men! Explain yourself!’
   ‘Paid fir the wine meself, din I?’ grumbled the man. ‘An’ the ground’s ‘is Majesty’s,
innit? ‘is Majesty never said I couldn’t sleep on it if I’d adda few! Can’t see what it’s
gorra do with you, yerroner!’
   ‘Why, this fellow seems to consider himself completely above the law!’ snapped Jia
Yu-cun angrily. ‘What’s his name?’
   ‘Ni Er,’ replied the man. ‘But they calls me the Drunken Dia?mond.’
   Jia Yu-cun was not amused.
   ‘Give this precious rogue a good thrashing,’ he ordered grimly, adding by way of a
vicious pun: ‘That should soon cut him down to size!’
   His attendants pinned Ni Er to the ground and administered a few hefty cracks of
the whip. The pain soon cleared Dime’s head, and he began begging abjectly for
mercy. Yu-cun laughed loudly at him from his chair:
   ‘Diamond, indeed! All right, leave him alone for the present. Take him back to the
yamen. We can question him at leisure there.’
   There was a cry from the runners, who immediately bound Dime and dragged him
along behind the chair, ignoring his continued pleas for mercy.
   Yu-cun went first to the Palace to report on his tour, and then returned to his
yamen, where daily business soon engulfed him. He was too busy to give Dime
another thought. But the bystanders who had witnessed the flogging in the street
lost no time in telling the story to their friends, and the news soon spread that Ni Er
the swank, Ni Er the drunken bully, had fallen foul of Mayor Jia and landed himself in
deep water. Rumour of it eventually reached the ears of his wife and daughter, and
that night when he failed to come home his daughter, fearing the worst, went to all
the gambling-dens in search of him. His cronies only confirmed the story, and Dime’s
daughter was reduced to tears at the thought of what might have happened to her
father.
  ‘Don’t take it to heart so, miss!’ they said. ‘That Mayor Jia’s related to the
Rong-guo Jias. And isn’t young Jia Yun a buddy of your dad’s? Why don’t you and
your mum go and ask him to put in a word for Dime? That should fix it.’
  Dime’s daughter thought this over to herself:
  ‘They’re right. Father has often said how friendly he is with young Mr Jia Yun next
door. Perhaps I should go and see him.’
  She hurried home and told her mother, and the following morning the two of
them went to call on Jia Yun. He happened to be at home that day, and invited them
both in, while his mother told the little maid to serve them tea. They related the
story of Dime’s arrest, and begged Jia Yun to help them secure his release.
    ‘Of course!’ agreed Jia Yun without the slightest hesitation. ‘No trouble at all. I’ll
drop in at Rong-guo House, mention it to them, and the matter will soon be settled.
This Mayor Jia owes everything to his connection with the Rong-guo Jias. One word
from them and Dime will be a free man again!’
    Dime’s wife and daughter returned home in high spirits and with great
expectations. They went to visit Dime in the yamen where he was being held prisoner,
and told him the good news, that thanks to the intervention of Jia Yun and the Jia
family he would shortly be set free. Dime was greatly relieved.
    Unfortunately Jia Yun, having had his previous overtures rebuffed by Xi-feng, had
been too cowed to visit her again, and since that day had hardly set foot inside
Rong-guo House. The men on the Rong?guo gate treated callers strictly according to
their standing with the family. If the family were known to have received a person
with cordiality and respect, that person was welcomed and announced immediately;
if, on the other hand, a person had once been cold- shouldered, the servants were
quick to take their cue. If such a person called again, even if he were a relative, they
would refuse to report his arrival and would send him away without more ado. So,
when Jia Yun turned up and asked to pay his respects to Jia Lian, he got a very cool
reception at the gate:
   ‘Mr Lian is not in. When he comes home, we will inform him that you called.’
   Jia Yun would have persisted and asked to see Mrs Lian, but he was afraid to
provoke the gatemen any further, and with some reluct?ance turned about and went
home. He had to face renewed im?portuning from Dime’s wife and daughter the next
day:
   ‘But Mr Yun! We thought you said the Jias could get anything they wanted out of
anyone! You’re one of the family, and this isn’t a big thing to ask. You can’t have
failed! You can’t let us down like this!’
   Jia Yun felt thoroughly humiliated, and tried to bluff his way out:
   ‘Yesterday my relatives were too busy to send anyone. But I’m sure they will do
something about it today, and then Dime will be set free. There’s really no need to
worry.’
    Dime’s wife and daughter waited to see how things would turn out. Jia Yun, having
failed to gain access by the front entrance of Rong-guo House, now tried the back,
thinking he might be able to get in touch with Bao-yu in the Garden. To his surprise
he found the garden gate locked, and was obliged to return home once more,
dejected and crestfallen.
    ‘It was only a few years ago that Dime lent me that money,’ he thought to himself.
‘I used it to buy Mrs Lian a present of camphor and musk, and as a result she gave me
the tree-planting job. But this time, just because I can’t afford presents, I get the
brush-off. She’s got nothing to be proud of, lending out money- money that’s been
handed down in the family- while poor householders like us can’t even borrow a tael
when we need it. I suppose she thinks she’s being clever, that this is a nice little
nest-egg, a clever way to protect her own future. She doesn’t know what a stinking
reputation she’s earned for herself. If I keep my mouth shut, well and good; but if I
tell people what I know, she’ll have more than one life to answer for in court!’
    He found Dime’s wife and daughter waiting for him when he got back, and this
time he had to admit, albeit in a modified form, that his mission had not borne fruit:
    ‘The Jias did send someone to put in a word for Dime, but I’m afraid Mayor Jia
won’t set him free. You might have more luck if you try Mr Leng Zi-xing. He’s related
to Mrs Zhou, and she works for the Jias.’
    ‘What earthly good will a servant be,’ complained Dime’s family, ‘when a
respectable member of the family such as yourself can do nothing for us!’
    Jia Yun found this highly mortifying. ‘What you don’t seem to realize,’ he protested
indignantly, ‘is that nowadays servants can have more pull than their masters!’
  Dime’s wife and daughter could see that they were wasting their time with him.
  ‘We’re much obliged to you for all the trouble you’ve gone to, Mr Yun,’ they
muttered sarcastically. ‘When Father gets out he’s sure to want to thank you
himself...’
  They went their way. Eventually they found somebody else to assist in the
extrication of Dime, who was duly acquitted and released, having suffered no more
by way of punishment than a few strokes of the rod.
  Upon his return to the family hearth, his womenfolk related to Dime how the Jias
had failed to intervene on his behalf. Dime had already broached his first bottle, and
angrily announced his intention of seeking out Jia Yun and teaching him a lesson:
  ‘Lousy bastard! Ungrateful, sneaky little sod! When he had an empty belly and
needed a job, who did it, who gave him a helping hand? Right first time: yours truly.
‘Course, now I’m in a bit of a spot meseff, he doesn’t want to know, does he! Bloody
marvellous I call it! I’m tellin’ you, if I want to, I can take those Jias and rub their
snotty little noses in the mud where they belong!’
   The women tried anxiously to forestall any more of his grandiose threats:
   ‘Drunk again, Dad! You’re out of your mind! The bottle was your undoing a couple
of days ago, and you got a good hiding for it. And now hark at you! At it again, before
your bruises have even had a chance to heal!’
   ‘Think a licking’s going to scare me, do you?’ bragged Dime. ‘All I needed was a
lead. It was all I needed. And now I’ve got one. Now I can nail’em! Oh yes, I got pally
with some fellers while I was inside, and I learnt a thing or two. Accordin’ to them,
this country’s crawling with Jias of one breed or another, and a few days back there
was a fair number of Jia servants taken in. I was pretty surprised to hear that. I mean,
I knew the younger Jias and their servants were a bad lot, but I’d always thought the
older ones were all right. How come they’d got into trouble?
   ‘In the end, turns out that these Jias they were talking about were all from out of
town - course, they’re still related to the ones in town. Anyway, there’s been some
sort of hoo-ha, so these servants have been sent here for trying. So now I’ve got my
lead! I’m laughing! That little Yun’s an ungrateful beggar, that’s what he is! My mates
and I can spread the word on his family’s carry-on, the cheating and bullying, the
lending money at wicked rates, the wife-snatching ... Oh, if that gets to the top, some
heads’ll roll all right then! That’ll learn ‘em who Dime is!’
   ‘Go to sleep, you drunken old pisspot!’ cried Dime’s missus. ‘Snatch?ing whose
wife, in the name of heaven? I never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life!’
   ‘Fat lot you’d know, stuck at home all day!’ retorted Dime. ‘Coupla years back, I
was having a throw in one of the dens, met this young feller, name of Zhang, and he
told me how his woman was taken off of him by the Jias. Asked me for some advice. I
just told him to forget it. Dunno where he is now, haven’t seen him these two or
three years. Next time I bump into that Zhang feller, I’ll know what to tell him. Roast
that little Yun alive! Make him crawl on his knees! Got my lead now...’
   Dime promptly collapsed onto his bed in a stupor, mumbling incoherently to
himself, and was soon soundly asleep. His wife and daughter dismissed his threats as
the ravings of a drunkard, and early the next morning Dime set off once more for his
gambling haunts, where we must leave him.

*

We return to Jia Yu-cun: the morning after his return home, refreshed by a good
night’s sleep, he told his wife (who, it will be remembered, had once been in service
with the Zhen family in Soochow) of his encounter with Zhen Shi-yin. She reproached
him for his heart?lessness:
   ‘Why did you not go back to look for him? If he has been burnt to death, we will be
guilty forever of having done him a great wrong!’
   She began to weep, and Jia Yu-cun tried to justify himself:
   ‘How could I have intervened? A being like that lives on a different plane from
people like us. He would only have resented the inter?ference.’
   At that moment a message was brought in for Yu-cun:
   ‘The runner sent by Your Honour yesterday to investigate the fire at the temple has
come to deliver his report.’
   Yu-cun strolled out to receive the runner, who dropped one knee to the ground
and said:
   ‘I went back as you told me to, sir. I braved the flames and went into the temple to
see if I could find the Taoist. His hut was com?pletely razed to the ground, even the
wall behind it had collapsed, and there was no trace of the old man. He must have
been roasted alive...... All that was left was his prayer-mat, and drinking-gourd;
somehow they both seemed to have survived intact. I looked all over the place for
any human remains, but there was not so much as a bone to be seen. I was going to
bring you the prayer-mat and gourd, to show you, in case you didn’t believe me, sir;
but when I picked them up they just turned to ashes in my hands.’
   Yu-cun deduced from this account that Zhen Shi-yin’s departure from the scene of
the fire had been no ordinary death, but rather some miraculous process of
etherealization. He dismissed the runner, and went in again to his private apartment,
where he made no mention to his wife of Shi-yin’s metamorphosis by fire, thinking
she would fail to understand and would only be distressed; instead he simply told her
that no trace of the old man had been found, and that he had most probably escaped
alive.
   Leaving his private apartment, Yu-cun went to his study, and was sitting there
pondering the few words Zhen Shi-yin had spoken during their brief encounter, when
one of his attendants came in to convey an Imperial summons to the Palace, to
peruse certain state papers. Yu-cun hurriedly took a sedan-chair to the Palace. As he
arrived he overheard someone say:
   ‘The Kiangsi Grain Intendant, Jia Zheng, has been impeached, and is at court to
plead for clemency!’
   Yu-cun pressed on into the Cabinet Office and greeted the various Ministers of
State gathered there. He first performed his duty and glanced through the state
papers (which spelled out His Majesty’s displeasure with the state of the coastal
defences), and then left the Cabinet Office at once to find Jia Zheng and to
commiserate with him on his impeachment, expressing his relief that it was not too
serious a charge, and asking if his journey to the capital had been a comfortable one.
Jia Zheng replied with a detailed account of his misfortunes.
   ‘Has your plea for clemency been presented to the throne yet?’ asked Yu-cun.
   ‘It has,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘I am expecting to receive the Rescript when His Majesty
returns from lunch.’
   Even as they were speaking, Jia Zheng was summoned to the Imperial presence,
and hurried in. Those senior ministers who were connected with him waited
anxiously in one of the antechambers; and when, after a lengthy audience, he finally
emerged again, his face beaded with sweat, they all pressed forward to greet him.
   ‘Well?’ they asked. ‘How did it go?’
   ‘Frightened the life out of me!’ gasped Jia Zheng, his tongue popping out of his
mouth. ‘I must thank you all, gentlemen, for your concern. I am relieved to inform
you that I have come out of this business relatively unscathed.’
   ‘On what subjects did His Majesty question you?’
   ‘His first question concerned the smuggling of firearms in Yunnan Province. The
original memorial on the case identified the ringleader as a member of the
household of Jia Hua, the former Grand Pre?ceptor. His Majesty thought he
remembered the name as that of my father’s cousin, and asked me if it was indeed
the same man. I kowtowed at once and reminded him that my father’s cousin was Jia
Dai-hua. His Majesty laughed. Then he went on to ask me if there was not another
relative of mine named Jia Hua, who had once been President of the Board of War,
but had subsequently been demoted and then appointed Mayor.’
   Jia Yu-cun was among those present. His more formal personal name was indeed
Hua, Yu-cun being merely a commonly used sobriquet, and he nearly jumped out of
his skin when he heard this.
   ‘And how did you reply to this, sir?’ he asked Jia Zheng.
   ‘I replied most deliberately that the former Grand Preceptor Jia Hua hailed from
Yunnan, whereas the Jia who was at present Mayor of the Metropolitan Prefecture
was a Chekiang man.
   ‘His Majesty’s second question concerned the Jia Fan recently impeached by the
Soochow censor. He asked me if this man also belonged to my family. I kowtowed
and replied that he did. A cloud seemed to pass over His Majesty’s countenance, and
he said: “A disgraceful affair, for a man to let his own household servants run riot and
lay their hands on the wives of innocent citizens!” I did not dare utter a word. “What
relation of yours is this Jia Fan?” “A distant one, Your Majesty,” I hastily replied. His
Majesty gave a sound of disapproval and told me to withdraw. Altogether, I think you
will agree, a most alarming experience!’
   ‘Certainly an astonishing coincidence that these two other cases should have come
up at the same time as yours,’ concurred the others.
    ‘The cases in themselves are not so very remarkable,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘But the
fact that both the gentlemen concerned belong to the Jia clan certainly bodes ill for
us. I suppose in a way it’s only to be expected: our clan is, after all, a large one, and
over the centuries has spread itself throughout the entire Empire.
    ‘There may be no scandal at present involving our branch of the family directly, but
I fear that after this the name Jia will be very much in the forefront of His Majesty’s
mind. Not a prospect I view with relish, I must say.
    ‘Come, you have nothing to fear,’ the others reassured him. ‘Remember, the truth
will always prevail.’
    ‘I should dearly like to retire from public life altogether,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘But alas, I
can hardly plead old age, and the hereditary family titles are an obligation that
neither branch of the family can relinquish.’
    ‘Now that you are reinstated at the Board of Works, sir,’ put in Jia Yu-cun, ‘I think
you will find life a great deal less fraught with difficulty.’
    ‘Metropolitan posts may be less troublesome in principle,’ replied Jia Zheng, ‘but
since I have now served twice in the provinces, there’s no saying what
unpleasantness may still lie in store for me.’
    ‘We all hold your integrity in the highest esteem,’ the others reassured him again.
‘And your brother’s character is beyond re?proach. However, you could perhaps be a
little stricter with your nephew and the younger generation.’
    ‘It is true, I have spent far too little time at home,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘And I have not
kept a sufficiently careful watch on my nephew’s behaviour. It is something I have
been uneasy about myself. Since you have raised this issue, and since I know you to
be well disposed towards my family, I would be obliged if you could be a little more
specific. Tell me, for example, have you heard of any irregularities in my nephew
Zhen’s family at Ning-guo House?’
    ‘We have only heard,’ they replied, ‘that he has somehow managed to fall foul of
several Vice-Presidents, not to mention a few eunuch chamberlains at the Palace. It
is nothing to worry about unduly as yet, but you should perhaps warn him to he a
little more circumspect in future.’
    When the conversation was over, the ministers saluted Jia Zheng and took their
leave. Jia Zheng returned home, and was welcomed at the main gate by a full
turn-out of the younger male Jias. He enquired first after Grandmother Jia, and then
they each greeted him in turn, dropping one knee to the ground, and followed him
into the mansion. Lady Wang and the other ladies had assembled for a formal
welcome in the Hall of Exalted Felicity, after which Jia Zheng went to pay his respects
to Grandmother Jia in her private apartment. He told her all his news, and when she
asked about Tan-chun, gave her a detailed account of the wedding.
   ‘I had to leave at short notice, and was unable to celebrate the Double Ninth
festival with her. But although I did not see her then myself, some of her husband’s
family came to visit me and told me that she was getting on very well there. Her
father-in-law and mother-?in-law both send you their regards. They said that they
might be moving to the capital this winter or next spring, which would cer?tainly be
most welcome. But since these recent coastal disturbances, I very much doubt if they
will be able to move so soon.’
   Grandmother Jia had at first been most upset by the news of Jia Zheng’s demotion
and return to the capital: apart from anything else it would mean that Tan-chun, who
was living so far away from home, would be even more isolated from the family. But
when Jia Zheng explained the favourable outcome of his audience with the Emperor,
and set her mind at rest about Tan-chun, she cheered up considerably, and a smile
could be seen on her face when she told him he could leave. Jia Zheng went next to
see his brother, and then the younger men, and it was agreed that they would
worship at the family ancestral shrine first thing the following day.
   These duties performed, Jia Zheng retreated to his private apart?ment, where he
spoke with Lady Wang and his other womenfolk, and then with Bao-yu, Jia Lan and
Jia Huan. To his relief he observed a considerable improvement in Bao-yu, who
seemed plumper and healthier than at the time of his departure for Kiangsi. He still
knew nothing of the boy’s mental derangement, and this discernible outward
improvement was a source of some satisfaction to him and a welcome antidote to his
own anxieties. He dismissed any reservations he still had about the way in which
Grandmother Jia had handled the wedding. Bao-chai too, he noticed, seemed more
mature and poised than ever, while young Lan was growing into a fine, cultured
young man. Jia Zheng was visibly pleased by what he saw. The only blot on the
landscape was Jia Huan. He did not seem to have changed in the slightest, and still
failed to arouse in his father any flicker of paternal affection or pride.
   After a silence lasting several minutes Jia Zheng suddenly seemed to think of
something.
   ‘There seems to be one person missing.’
   Lady Wang knew he must be thinking of Dai-yu, whose death she had refrained
from mentionmg in any of her letters; and as she did not wish to spoil the pleasure of
his homecoming by breaking the news to him now, she replied that illness had
prevented Dai-yu from being present. This act of deception cut Bao-yu to the quick,
but he did his utmost to appear composed, out of respect for his father.
   Lady Wang invited all the children and grandchildren to the welcoming feast, and
they drank to the Master’s return. Xi-feng, although she was strictly the
daughter-in-law of Jia She and Lady Xing, was also present by virtue of her role as
manageress of the household, helping Bao-chai to pour the wine. Jia Zheng cut the
party short, saying that after one more round they should all retire. The servants
were also dismissed, with instructions to call on him the next day, after the ancestral
sacrifice.
   Jia Zheng and Lady Wang were at last alone and able to talk together. Lady Wang
was still reluctant to broach any serious topic; when Jia Zheng referred to her brother
Wang Zi-teng’s death, she did her best not to appear too distressed; and when he
mentioned Xue Pan’s fresh calamities, her only comment was that he had brought
them upon himself. At an opportune moment however she broke the news of
Dai-yu’s death, which seemed to come as a great shock to Jia Zheng, and to affect
him deeply. Tears stole down his cheeks, and he sighed several times. Lady Wang
herself could no longer contain her tears. Suncloud and her other maids who were
standing close by gave her dress a discreet tug, and she quickly composed herself and
steered the conversation towards a more cheerful subject. Soon afterwards they
went to bed.
   Early next morning, a ceremony was performed in the ancestral shrine, in the
presence of all the young male members of the family, and afterwards Jia Zheng
received Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian in the gallery at the side of the shrine, where he
asked them for a report of the household accounts, which Cousin Zhen supplied,
albeit in a highly selective form.
   ‘As I have only just returned home,’ commented Jia Zheng, ‘I do not intend to
subject you to an inquisition now, Zhen. But let me say this: while I have been away, I
have heard it said that you have been allowing standards to slip. You must exercise
the utmost diligence and caution. You are older than the other members of your
genera?tion, and should set an example to the younger ones. There must be no
offence caused to people outside. And that applies to you too, Lian. This is no routine
homecoming homily. I have my reasons for warning you. There are things I have
heard. I repeat: you must both be more careful in future.’
   Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian were by now bright red in the face, and all they could
muster was a feeble, ‘Yes, sir.’ Jia Zheng did not pursue the matter any further, but
went in to his own reception hall, where all the menservants were waiting for him;
thence he proceeded to the inner apartments, to be welcomed by all the maids and
serving-women. But we will not describe these events in any great detail.

*

Our story returns to Bao-yu, and to the occasion on the previous day when he had
been secretly so upset to hear Lady Wang speak of Dai-?yu’s ‘illness’. Jia Zheng had
finally granted him permission to leave the family gathering, and he returned to his
apartment. He arrived, having cried most of the way there, to find Bao-chai and
Aroma chatting together, and went off at once into an outer room to be on his own
and nurse his grief in private. Bao-chai told Aroma to take him some tea, and then
decided to go out herself and join him, surmising that he was nervous of an
impending confrontation with his father, when his failure to make any progress in his
studies would be discovered (and no doubt punished). It was therefore her duty to
offer him some comfort. Bao-yu turned the misunderstanding to his advantage:
   ‘It’s all right. You can go to bed. I just need some time to concen?trate and collect
my thoughts. Lately my memory has been so poor, and there will be trouble if I make
a fool of myself in front of Father. You go to sleep. Aroma can sit up and keep me
company for a bit.’
   Bao-chai thought it advisable to humour him, and nodded her assent. As soon as
she was out of the way, Bao-yu went to find Aroma, and whispered in her ear:
   ‘Please will you ask Nightingale to come and see me? There’s something I need to
speak to her about. You must explain to her how things really are. Maybe then she’ll
stop being so angry with me.’
   Aroma: ‘I thought I heard you say you wanted time to concentrate and collect your
thoughts. But now look at you! What kind of concentration is this? Whatever you
want to ask her can wait till tomorrow, surely?’
   Bao-yu: ‘But I have this evening free. Tomorrow who knows what may happen? I
may be sent for by Father, and then I won’t have a moment to myself. Dear Aroma!
Go and do as I say, please!’
   Aroma: ‘You know perfectly well she won’t come unless Mrs Bao sends for her.’
   Bao-yu: ‘She might do, if you were to explain things to her first.’
   Aroma: ‘But what do you want me to say?’
   Bao-yu: ‘Surely by now you know what my feelings are, and why Nightingale has
turned against me. It’s all because of Dai-yu. It’s all a big misunderstanding. You must
convince Nightingale that I’m not the faithless monster she takes me for, that it’s you
and the others who have made me seem like one to her!’
   As he said this, he glanced towards the inner room, and pointing in that direction,
continued:
   ‘I never wanted to marry her. It was forced on me by Grandmother and the rest. It
was all a trick. It was they who drove Dai-yu to her death. They were to blame. If only
I could have seen her once before she died and been able to tell her the truth!
Instead, she died thinking that I had betrayed her! You heard yourself what Cousin
Tan said; with her dying breath Dai-yu spoke of me with bitterness and re?sentment.
That’s why Nightingale has set herself so violently against me - out of loyalty to her
mistress.
    ‘Do you think I’m heartless? Think back to Skybright’s death. Skybright was only my
maid, and not as dear to me as Dai-yu; but even so, when she died I wrote a funeral
ode for her and made an offering to her spirit - there’s no need to keep it a secret
from you any longer. Dai-yu witnessed it with her own eyes. Now she herself is dead;
and is she to be ranked lower than Skybright? But I haven’t been able to make her an
offering of any kind. Won’t her spirit see this as further proof of my heartlessness?
Won’t she feel greater bitterness towards me than ever?’
    Aroma: ‘I don’t understand. If you want to write an ode and make an offering, then
go ahead. Who’s stopping you?’
    Bao-yu: ‘I’ve wanted to ever since I’ve been better. But somehow I seem to have
lost all inspiration. For another person I might have been content with something
uninspired. But for Dai-yu nothing but the very purest and the very best will do.
That’s why I must see Nightingale. I want to ask her what she can tell me of her
mistress’s feelings; I want to find out exactly how she came by that knowledge. I can
remember what it was like before I fell ill. I can remember Dai?yu’s feelings towards
me then. But from that time onwards, every?thing becomes a blur in my mind. Didn’t
you tell me that her health had improved? Then why did death come so quickly?
What did she say when I didn’t visit her, while she was still well? And then when I fell
ill, did she ever say why she never came to see me? I managed to get her belongings
brought over here, but Mrs Bao won’t let me touch them. I don’t understand why.’
    Aroma: ‘Because she’s afraid it will only upset you. Why else?’
    Bao-yu: ‘I don’t believe that. There must be more to it. Then again, if Dai-yu cared
about me, or missed me, why did she burn her poems before she died? Surely she
would have left them for me as a memento? It’s all so confusing. And what about the
music that was heard in the air when she died? She must have become a fairy, or
risen to heaven in the form of an immortal. If it comes to that, I don’t even know if
she’s really dead. I’ve only seen the coffin; how can I be sure that she is still inside it?’
   Aroma: ‘Honestly! You get more ridiculous with every word! Are you trying to
suggest that she could have been put in the coffin while she was still alive, and then
somehow climbed out of it?’
   Bao-yu: ‘No. I meant something quite different. You see, if humans achieve
immortality, there are two ways in which they can depart from this world: either they
go in the flesh, in their earthly form, or they may discard their bodies, and their
etheric body is then magically transported to another realm. Oh, Aroma, please help
me! Tell Nightingale to come!’
   Aroma: ‘You’ll have to wait till I’ve had a chance to explain all this to her properly.
Then, if she agrees to come, well and good. If not, I can see I shall have to try again
and have another long talk with her, and even after that, supposing she does come,
she probably won’t be prepared to say much to you. If you want my advice, you
should at least wait till tomorrow. In the morning when Mrs Bao goes in to see Her
Old Ladyship I’ll have a word with Nightingale. We might get somewhere that way. I’ll
come back as soon as I’ve spoken to her and tell you how it went.’
   Bao-yu: ‘I suppose you’re right. But you don’t know how im?patient I feel.’
   At this point, Musk appeared:
   ‘Mrs Bao says, it’s already well past midnight, and will you go in to bed now, Mr
Bao. Aroma must have got carried away chatting to you, and forgotten the time...
   ‘Goodness, it is late!’ exclaimed Aroma. ‘Time to go to sleep. If there’s anything
else, it can wait till the morning.’
   Bao-yu rose reluctantly to go in to the bedroom, whispering in Aroma’s ear as he
passed by:
   ‘Be sure not to forget tomorrow, whatever you do!’
   ‘Of course I won’t!’ said Aroma with a smile.
   ‘You two at it again!’ said Musk, touching her cheek at Aroma in a saucy fashion.
Then, to Bao-yu: ‘Why don’t you just go straight to Mrs Bao and tell her that you’d
like to sleep with Aroma? Then the two of you can carry on “talking” till dawn. None
of us will interfere, you needn’t worry.’
   Bao-yu raised his hand:
   ‘That is quite uncalled for, Musk!’
   ‘Little hussy!’ said Aroma heatedly. ‘Always having your little dig! You’d better look
out! One of these days I’ll rip that nasty little tongue of yours out of your mouth for
good!’ Turning to Bao-yu, she continued:
    ‘Now see what you’ve done! This is all your fault. Keeping me up talking like this
till one o’clock in the morning...’
    She escorted him into his room and then went her separate way to bed.
    Bao-yu was unable to sleep that night, and in the morning was still preoccupied
with the same gloomy thoughts.
    The new day began with an announcement from outside:
    ‘The Master’s family and friends have expressed a wish to hold a theatre-party to
welcome him home. The Master however is insistent that plays would be
inappropriate on this occasion; instead he will give a simple party at home, to which
all family and friends are invited. The date has been set for the day after tomorrow.
This is the preliminary announcement.’
    To learn who was invited, please read the next chapter.
CHAPTER 105

The Embroidered Jackets raid
Ning-guo House
And Censor Li impeaches
the Prefect of Ping-an




The day of the reception arrived. Jia Zheng was busily entertaining his guests in the
Hall of Exalted Felicity, when Lai Da the steward hurried in to report that a
Commissioner Zhao was outside, with a detachment of the Embroidered Jackets, the
Imperial secret police:
    ‘He says he is making a social call, and when I asked for his visiting card he told me
there was no need for any such formality, as he was on the best of terms with you, sir.
Then he got down from his carriage and started walking straight in. I beg you, sir, to
go out with the young masters and receive him at once.’
    ‘I’ve never had anything to do with this Zhao,’ mused Jia Zheng. ‘I wonder what
can have brought him here? And at such an in?convenient hour. I can hardly abandon
my guests to entertain him; and yet if I do not invite him in it will seem uncivil...’
    He stood there thinking the matter over to himself, and Jia Lian urged him to hurry:
‘If you wait much longer, Uncle, they will be upon us.’
    Even as he said these words, a servant entered to announce that Commissioner
Zhao had indeed already passed through the inner gate, and Jia Zheng hurried out
into the courtyard to receive him. Zhao soon came into sight, smiling but silent, and
walked straight on and up into the hall. He was followed by five or six of his aides,
some of whom were known to Jia Zheng, but although Jia Zheng greeted them, none
of them said a word in reply. Jia Zheng could only follow them helplessly back into
the hall and ask them to be seated. Some of the guests were acquainted with Zhao,
but he passed them by with his head in the air and ignored everyone except Jia
Zheng, whom he eventually took by the hand and engaged in vague small-talk,
smiling inscrutably all the while. The guests scented trouble in the air, and either
sneaked out into the private apartments at the back of the mansion, or stood
stock-still where they were, in an attitude of apprehensive respect.
   Jia Zheng managed to maintain an anxious smile, and was about to attempt a
response to one of Zhao’s pleasantries when a flustered servant entered the hall and
announced:
   ‘His Highness the Prince of Xi-ping!’
    Jia Zheng hurried out once again, to find the prince already entering the courtyard.
Commissioner Zhao moved smartly forward ahead of Jia Zheng to salute the prince,
and then gave his own aides their orders:
    ‘His Royal Highness has now arrived; take your men and post yourselves at the
front and rear gates of the mansion.
    Zhao’s aides went off to do his bidding, while Jia Zheng and the other menfolk,
filled with foreboding by this sinister turn of events, fell to their knees and kowtowed
before the Prince of Xi-ping. The prince raised Jia Zheng with both hands and said
with a reassuring smile: ‘I would not intrude on you at such a time did I not have
special reasons: I am entrusted with an Imperial Edict for your brother, Sir She. But I
see that we have come upon you in the midst of a private gathering, and as it would
hardly be fitting to proceed while your friends and relatives are still present, I would
ask them to leave. Only the members of your own household need remain behind.’
    ‘A most gracious gesture, I am sure,’ interposed Commissioner Zhao sharply. ‘But
His Highness supervising operations at Ning-guo House is, I believe, taking this
matter a little more seriously, and has already ordered every gate to be sealed.’
    The guests learned from this that both mansions were in some sort of trouble, and
began to fear that they themselves were trapped as well. The prince, however,
seemed unperturbed, and announced smilingly:
    ‘Gentlemen, please consider yourselves free to leave. Send for some of my men to
escort them out,’ he continued, addressing Zhao, ‘and tell your own officers that
these are all guests and are not to be hindered or subjected to any kind of search, but
are to be let through without delay.’
    As soon as they heard this, the guests vanished like a puff of smoke, leaving only
Jia She, Jia Zheng and the immediate family, who stood there trembling and pale with
fear. Shortly afterwards, constables swarmed in and stationed themselves at every
doorway, thereby denying freedom of movement to masters and servants alike. Zhao
turned to the prince, his face positively venomous:
   ‘Will Your Highness be so good as to read the Edict, so that we can proceed with
our task?’
   The constables hitched up their robes, rolled up their sleeves, and stood smartly to
attention to hear the Edict. The prince began his preamble with great deliberation:
   ‘I am hereby instructed by His Majesty to proceed with Com?missioner Zhao Quan
of the Embroidered Jackets and to search, and take a complete inventory of, the
property of Jia She.’
   Jia She cowered prostrate on the ground as the prince mounted the terrace and,
facing south, began the proclamation of the Edict proper:
   “‘Hearken! Inasmuch as Our subject Jia She has connived with a provincial official
and has used his influence to persecute a defenceless citizen, he has shown himself
unworthy of Our favour, has disgraced his ancestors, and is to be deprived of his
hereditary rank. By Imperial Decree.”
   ‘Arrest him!’ barked Zhao. ‘Take the others away and put them under close guard!’
   This referred to the other Jia menfolk present - Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Cousin Zhen, Jia
Rong, Jia Qiang, Jia Zhi and Jia Lan. Bao-yu had somehow managed to slip out to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment earlier, on the pretext of some indisposition or other,
while Jia Huan hardly ever put in an appearance at such social gatherings.
   Zhao also told his aides to issue the junior officers and constables with their orders
at once: they were to divide up and search the mansion room by room, taking a
detailed inventory as they went along. These orders, and the brisk matter-of-fact
efficiency with which they were delivered, had a devastating impact on the morale of
the Jia family, young and old alike. They looked at one another in terror as they were
led away, while Zhao’s constables and personal lackeys began rubbing their hands in
gleeful anticipation.
   ‘I understand,’ said the Prince of Xi-ping, ‘that Sir Zheng and Sir She maintain
separate establishments. Since the Edict only empowers us to search Sir She’s
property, the other apartments should be locked and sealed, until such time as I have
received further in?structions from His Majesty.’
   Zhao rose to his feet.
   ‘Your Highness, I should inform you that in point of fact Jia She and Jia Zheng do
not maintain separate establishments. On the con?trary, I am given to understand
that the affairs of both branches of Rong-guo Rouse are managed by one person, Jia
Lian, who is the son of Sir She and the nephew of Sir Zheng. It is therefore imperative
that we search the entire mansion.’
   The prince was silent, and Zhao continued:
   ‘In view of this, I shall personally direct the search of the residences of both Jia She
and Jia Lian.’
   ‘There is no hurry,’ said the prince. ‘Send word to the inner apartments first, and
give the ladies time to withdraw. A few minutes’ delay is neither here nor there.’
   But even as he was speaking, Zhao’s men, who had already led away the Jia
menfolk, were dividing up into search parties and had begun their work, each taking
one of the Jia servants to act as guide.
   ‘Let there be no rowdy behaviour now!’ cried the prince. ‘I shall be along presently
to supervise the proceedings myself.’
   He rose to his feet in a dignified manner, and addressed his own attendants:
   ‘Not one of you is to move. Wait here, and later we shall inspect the inventory
together.’
   Almost immediately one of Zhao’s men returned from the search and knelt before
him:
   ‘Your Highness, restricted garments and skirts for palace use, and many other
prohibited items, have been found in the inner apart?ments. I have given orders that
these are not to be moved, pending Your Highness’s instructions.’
   Presently another search party returned and pressed before the prince:
   ‘Two chests of property deeds found in the eastern side-compound, and one chest
of promissory notes - all bearing illegal rates of inter?est?.’
   ‘Usurers!’ hissed Zhao. ‘They deserve to lose everything. Take a seat, Your
Highness, and allow me to order the immediate confi?scation of the entire contents
of the mansion. We can report to the throne for the necessary authorization
afterwards.’
   At that moment an aide-de-camp came in to speak to the prince:
   ‘The soldiers at the gate have sent word that the Prince of Bei-jing is here, as the
special emissary of His Majesty, and will deliver a second Edict. You are requested to
go out and receive him.’
   Zhao welcomed this news.
   ‘It was just my luck,’ he thought to himself; ‘to have been lumbered with this first
prince! Now he’s being replaced, and I should be able to get down to business!’
   He went out to the front courtyard, to find the Prince of Bei-jing already facing
south, and delivering the new Edict.
   ‘“For the Edification of Zhao Quan, Commissioner of the Em?broidered Jackets.
Hearken! The men under Zhao’s command are to arrest no one, with the exception of
Jia She, who is to be held for questioning. The Prince of Xi-ping will supervise all
other aspects of the investigation according to Our Instructions.”’
   The Prince of Xi-ping was delighted. He sat down with the Prince of Bei-jing, and
told Zhao to take Jia She with him and return to his yamen. The search parties, having
learned of the arrival of the new prince, had all congregated once more in the
courtyard. They were most disappointed to hear that Zhao was being removed from
the scene, and stood around, disconsolately waiting for their new orders. The Prince
of Bei-jing selected two of the more honest-looking officers and a dozen or so of the
older constables to stay behind, and dismissed all the others.
   ‘I was just beginning to get extremely annoyed with old Zhao,’ said the Prince of
Xi-ping. ‘You arrived with that second Edict in the nick of time. If you’d been much
later, I’m afraid it would have gone badly for the Jias.’
   ‘I heard at court,’ replied the Prince of Bei-jing, ‘that you had been entrusted with
the original Edict, and that the investigation was in your hands, and I must say I was
greatly relieved. I knew I could depend on you to see that things did not get out of
hand. But I hadn’t bargained on that old rogue Zhao. Tell me, where are Sir Zheng
and young Bao-yu? I do hope these men have not been creating too much havoc.’
   ‘Jia Zheng and the other gentlemen are being held under guard in the servants’
quarters,’ he was informed by the officers. ‘The men have turned the entire house
upside-down in the course of their search.’
   The Prince of Bei-jing turned to one of them:
   ‘Bring Sir Zheng here at once. I wish to speak to him.’
   Jia Zheng was brought in, and fell to his knees, tearfully pleading for mercy. The
Prince of Bei-jing stood up, took him by both hands and said:
   ‘My friend, set your mind at rest.’
   When the prince went on to inform him of the new Edict, Jia Zheng wept with
emotion, and faced in a northerly direction to kowtow his thanks to the throne. Then
he came forward again to receive any further instructions. It was the Prince of Xi-ping
who continued:
   ‘My friend, when Commissioner Zhao was here just now, his constables reported
having found prohibited items of clothing, and promissory notes bearing excessive
rates of interest. It will be hard to gloss all this over. The clothes were no doubt
intended for Her Grace’s use - that I can state quite plausibly in my report. But these
promissory notes - what are we to say about them? I think you, Zheng, had better go
now with one of the officers and give him a complete account of all Sir She’s property.
It is essential that you conceal nothing, or you will only make things worse for
yourself.’
   ‘How could I dare to conceal anything!’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘But I beg to inform Your
Highness that our family estate has never been formally divided between my brother
and myself; individually we own only whatever we happen to have in our
apartments.’
  ‘Very well,’ said the princes. ‘Proceed on that basis, and declare whatever is in Sir
She’s compound.’
  The officers were instructed to execute this task in an orderly and civilized fashion,
and departed with Jia Zheng.

*

Let us return to Grandmother Jia’s apartments, where the ladies had been holding a
party of their own that day. Bao-yu had come to join them, and Lady Wang asked him
if he ought not to be with the men, for fear of angering his father. Xi-feng was also
present, despite her illness, and she replied somewhat croakily on Bao-yu’s behalf:
   ‘I’m sure Bao-yu wasn’t afraid of the company, Aunt Wang, and I’m sure he wasn’t
shirking his responsibilities. He just thought there were plenty of men to wait on the
guests outside, and that he would be better employed helping us here - which is
reasonable enough. If Uncle Zheng needs an extra hand, you can always send Bao-yu
over later.’
   Grandmother Jia laughed:
   ‘Fengie may be ill, but she still has a tongue in her head!’
   The party was warming up and the conversation becoming quite merry, when
suddenly one of Lady Xing’s maidservants came running in, screeching:
   ‘Your Old Ladyship! Your Ladyships! The most terr.... terrible thing has happened!
Hundreds of bandits in big boots and hats have broken into the house, turned all the
trunks and boxes upside down and started stealing our things!’
   The ladies stared at her dumbfounded. Next, Patience hurried into the room, her
hair dishevelled, dragging Qiao-jie by the hand and sobbing hysterically:
   ‘Lord have mercy on us! I was having my meal with Qiao-jie when Brightie was
brought in, his hands tied behind his back. “Hurry, miss,” he told me, “go inside and
tell Their Ladyships to hide. The prince is on his way in to search the house!” I nearly
died of fright. I went into our apartment to rescue a few of the more important
things, and ran into a gang of ruffians who pushed me Out of their way. You’d better
hurry and collect together all the clothes and things you’ll need before it’s too late.’
   Lady Xing and Lady Wang were utterly flabbergasted; Xi-feng listened wide-eyed as
Patience told her tale, and then slumped onto the floor with her head thrown back;
Grandmother Jia burst into floods of tears before Patience had even finished, and
was too dis?traught to utter a word. The whole room was in this state of total
disarray, and the servants were falling over each other in their panic, when suddenly
more cries were heard from outside:
   ‘Ladies to withdraw! His Highness the Prince is approaching!’
   Bao-chai and Bao-yu stood watching helplessly, as the maids and old nannies
scrambled in every direction. The next they knew, Jia Lian came running in, panting:
   ‘All is well! The prince has saved the day!’
   They wanted to ask him what had happened, but Jia Lian was himself too infected
by the general hysteria to be of any service as an informant. First he caught sight of
Xi-feng lying unconscious on the floor, and cried out in alarm; then he saw that
Grandmother Jia had also fainted from shock, and feared the worst for her. Patience
suc?ceeded in bringing Xi-feng round, and with the help of one of the maids helped
her up onto her feet; while Grandmother Jia, when she finally regained
consciousness, lay down sobbing on the kang, strug?gling for breath, as though she
might faint again at any moment. Li Wan did her best to comfort her, and Jia Lian
himself was at last sufficiently composed to tell them of the events that had taken
place, and of the kindness shown them by the two princes - though he withheld the
news of Jia She’s arrest, which he was afraid might prove too great a shock for
Grandmother Jia and Lady Xing. He then went to examine the condition of his own
apartment, and found chests and cupboards broken open and ransacked. There was
almost nothing left. He stared around him aghast, and tears sprang to his eyes. He
heard his name called outside, and went out to find Jia Zheng with the two princes
and the officer taking the inventory. The items were being called Out one by one:
        One Longevity Buddha in aloeswood

 Two girdles in ‘mutton-fat’ white jade

 Substandard silver, seven thousand taels
 Pure gold, one hundred and fifty-two taels
 Copper cash, seven thousand five hundred strings

  All the furniture and properties bestowed by Imperial favour on the Rong-guo
branch of the family had been itemized in a similar fashion, while property deeds and
bonds for household servants had been put into separate covers and sealed.
  Jia Lian followed this recital in detail, and was greatly puzzled to hear no mention
of any of his own belongings. Presently one of the princes put an end to his
bewilderment by asking Jia Zheng:
  ‘Among the items confiscated earlier, there were promissory notes bearing
exorbitant rates of interest - who is responsible for these? You must tell the truth,
Zheng.’
  Jia Zheng knelt, kowtowed and said:
  ‘I have, alas, been insufficiently diligent in supervising my house?hold. I was
completely unaware of these activities. My nephew Jia Lian can doubtless answer
your questions.’
  Jia Lian hurried forward and fell to his knees.
  ‘Since the chest containing these documents was found in my apartment, how
dare I disclaim knowledge of them? I can only beg Your Highnesses’ mercy. My uncle
was quite unaware of their exist?ence.’
  ‘Your father has already been arrested,’ said the princes to Jia Lian. ‘This offence
can be dealt with at the same time as his. We commend you for having made a clean
breast of it.’ They turned to their men: ‘Jia Lian must be detained. The others may be
released, but are to be kept within the confines of the mansion.’ Finally they
addressed Jia Zheng: ‘You, Zheng, must be more circumspect in future. Stay here and
await His Majesty’s final Edict. We will now return to make our report to the throne,
and in the meantime will leave guards here to keep watch over the house.’
   They climbed into their princely sedans and were carried out of the mansion. Jia
Zheng escorted them as far as the inner gate, where he knelt to see them off, and the
Prince of Bei-jing stretched out a hand towards him as he passed, urging him to set
his mind at ease. There was genuine concern written on the prince’s face.
   After their departure Jia Zheng managed to compose himself somewhat, though
he was still suffering from a deep sense of shock. When Jia Lian came and asked him
to call on Grandmother Jia, informing him that she was indisposed, he roused himself
at once and went in. At every doorway he encountered frantic maids and
serving-women, all wondering what turn events would take next. Too preoccupied to
stop and question them, he hurried on to Grand?mother Jia’s apartment, and arrived
to find Lady Wang, Bao-yu and the others gathered around Grandmother Jia, their
faces wet with tears; there was silence in the room, broken only by the occasional fit
of convulsive wailing from Lady Xing. The appearance of Jia Zheng brought cries of
‘Heaven be praised!’ and they hastened to reassure the old lady:
   ‘The Master is safe and sound! He’s here with us! Please don’t fret any more,
Grannie!’
   Grandmother Jia gave a faint little gasp and opened her eyes a slit:
   ‘Oh my son! I thought I’d never see you again!’
   As she spoke, she burst out sobbing, and everyone in the room immediately
followed suit. Jia Zheng was afraid that all this emotion might injure the old lady’s
health and checked his own tears:
   ‘Please calm yourself, Mother. I cannot deny the gravity of what has happened. But
thanks to the Emperor’s generosity and the gra?cious favour of the two princes, we
have been treated with great compassion. Brother She has only been taken for
questioning, and when his case has been investigated I am sure His Majesty will deal
with him leniently also. And so far, not a thing has been removed from the house.’
   When Grandmother Jia learned that her elder son had been taken away, she broke
down again, and it was a while before Jia Zheng could finally calm her spirits.
   The first person to venture out of the room was Lady Xing. She went to inspect her
own apartment, and found all the doors sealed with strips of paper and padlocked,
and her maids and serving-?women held prisoner inside. There was nowhere for her
to take refuge, and she let out a great howl of despair. Finally she made her way to
Xi-feng’s apartment. Xi-feng’s side-rooms were sealed in a similar fashion, but the
door leading into the main hall was still open, and from inside she could hear the
sound of sobbing. She went in, and saw Xi-feng lying on her couch with eyes closed,
her face ashen-pale; Patience stood by her side, quietly weeping. Lady Xing thought
Xi-feng must be already dead and broke down again. Patience came up to her:
   ‘Please, Your Ladyship, don’t cry! We carried Mrs Lian back and she looked as good
as dead. She had a sleep and then she woke up again and started crying. Now she’s
more settled. Please try to be calm, Your Ladyship. How is Her Old Ladyship taking
it?’
   Lady Xing did not answer her question, but returned to Grand?mother Jia’s
apartment. There she was surrounded by Jia Zheng’s family. She reflected on her
wretched fate: her husband and son were under arrest, her daughter-in-law was at
death’s door, her newly married daughter was suffering maltreatment, and now she
herself had nowhere to turn. Her whole world seemed to be collapsing around her.
The others took pity on her distress and did what they could to comfort her; Li Wan
sent a servant to prepare temporary accommodation while Lady Wang deputed
some of her own maids and serving-women to wait on her.
   Jia Zheng meanwhile had returned to his outer study and was sitting there,
stroking his beard and nervously rubbing his hands together, waiting in a state of
great trepidation for the outcome of the princes’ report to the throne. He heard one
of the guards shouting outside:
   ‘Which part of the house do you belong to, for goodness’ sake? Since you’ve
turned up here, we’ll have to enter you in our book. Bind him and hand him over to
the Jackets.’
   Jia Zheng went out to the gate and found that the man in question was Big Jiao,
the ‘trusty old retainer’ from Ning-guo House.
   ‘What the devil brings you here?’ he asked.
   Stomping furiously on the ground and calling heaven to be his witness, Big Jiao
cried:
   ‘Hadn’t I warned these good-for-naught masters time after time- and they always
said I was agin them! But you, sir, you know the wounds I had at my master’s side!
And now look what we’ve come to! Mr Zhen and Master Rong both put in chains by
some prince or other; the ladies manhandled and locked up in an empty room by
some men from the whatsit guards; the slaves all penned up together, sir, like the
worthless pigs that they are! Everything taken out for inventory and pushed to one
side, lovely old furniture broken up, china smashed to smithereens ... And now they
want to get their hands on me! In my more than four score years I’ve tied men
aplenty for my master: but let ‘em do it to me - never! I gave ‘em the slip at first and
said I was from Rong-guo House; but they wouldn’t believe it and dragged me in. And
now I find things are just as bad here. Nothing left worth living for. Whole place gone
to the dogs. Well, I’m damned if I’ll knuckle under now. I might as well go down
fighting!’
   He charged head-first at the guards, who, out of respect for his age, and not
wishing to contravene the princes’ orders, handled him with restraint.
   ‘Calm down, old man. We’re here to carry out an Imperial Edict. Now just take it
easy and wait to see what His Majesty commands.’
   Throughout this Jia Zheng said nothing, though he was cut to the quick by the old
man’s words.
   ‘So it has come to this!’ he finally exclaimed to himself. ‘We are finished! I never
thought we should be brought so low!’
   He returned to his study and a little later was still sitting there, anxiously awaiting
news from the Palace, when he heard Xue Ke come running into the courtyard and
call out breathlessly:
  ‘I got through by the skin of my teeth! Where’s Uncle Zheng?’
  Jia Zheng stepped out to greet him:
  ‘I am so glad you were able to reach us. How did you persuade them to let you in?’
  ‘I just begged and begged for all I was worth, and promised them money, and in
the end they let me pass.’
  Jia Zheng told him of the raid and asked him to try to find out on their behalf what
was going on:
  ‘We can’t communicate with our friends and relatives. It would be too dangerous.
You are the very person to carry word through for us.’
  ‘I had heard of the charges brought against Ning-guo House,’ said Xue Ke, ‘but I
had no idea things were so bad on this side too.’
‘But what are the charges?’ asked Jia Zheng.
   ‘Earlier today,’ replied Xue Ke, ‘I was at the Board of Punishments on business of
my own. I was enquiring about Cousin Pan’s sentence, but while I was there I
happened to hear of the indictments brought by two censors against Cousin Zhen.
One was for corrupting the sons of noble families, encouraging them to gamble and
that sort of thing. That was the lesser of the charges: the other was for forcefully
taking as a concubine the fiancée of an innocent man; when she resisted, or so the
indictment reads, he subjected her to physical violence and drove her to her death.
To corroborate the charges, the censor concerned has arrested a servant of ours
named Bao Er and has also brought as witness a certain Mr Zhang. Even the Chief
Censorate may be in trouble, as this fellow Zhang originally appealed to them some
time ago and had his appeal quashed.’
   Jia Zheng stamped his foot before Xue Ke had finished speaking.
   ‘What have things come to! This is truly the end!’
   He sighed, and his cheeks were wet with tears. Xue Ke tried to console him, and
then went out again to gather more news.
   ‘Things look bad,’ he reported later that day. ‘At the Board of Punishments, I could
discover nothing about the two princes and their report to the throne. But I did learn
something else. Early this morning a censor named Li presented an impeachment
against the magistrate of Ping-an, accusing him of toadying to a metropolitan official,
of pandering to his superiors and of oppressing the common people - together with a
whole string of serious related offences.’
   ‘What has that to do with us?’ replied Jia Zheng somewhat im?patiently. ‘What
about our own people?’
   ‘The two cases are connected,’ said Xue Ke. ‘The metropolitan official referred to in
Censor Li’s impeachment is in fact Uncle She: which means that he is implicated in a
miscarriage of justice - which is a serious offence. His friends at court want to keep
their hands clean if they possibly can, and there is no one even willing to keep us
informed. It’s the same with the guests who fled from the party just now - they have
either gone home, or found some other hiding place in which to lie low until the
storm blows over. A few members of the clan are even publicly asking who will be the
lucky one to get the title now that the family has been disgraced. They all have an
eye on it ...’
   Jia Zheng stamped his foot and interrupted him again:
   ‘This is all the consequence of my elder brother’s folly! And of the disgraceful ways
into which Ning-guo House had fallen! But enough of this. Who knows if Lady Jia and
Lian’s wife are even still alive! You had best return and continue your enquiries, while
I go and see how Lady Jia is. If you have any news, bring it as quickly as you can.’
   As they were speaking, a confused cry was heard from within:
   ‘Her Old Ladyship is sinking!’
   Jia Zheng hurried away in great alarm. To learn if she lived, you must turn to the
next chapter.



CHAPTER 106

Wang Xi-feng feels remorse for the consequences
of her past misdeeds
And Grandmother Jia prays for the family’s deliverance
from further calamity’




Jia Zheng hurried straight in to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The shock of the day’s
events had finally taken its toll, and she was unconscious again and breathing fitfully.
Lady Wang, with the help of Faithful and the other maids, eventually brought her
round. They persuaded her to swallow one of her combined dispersant and sedative
boluses, which brought some slight relief. But she remained tearful and distraught.
Jia Zheng stood by her side and tried to comfort her and rally her spirits:
   ‘It is Brother She and I who have brought this misfortune on the family and caused
you all this distress, Mother. Please try to take heart a little. We will do our utmost to
set things to rights. If you should suffer in any way, our burden of guilt will be
unbearable!’
   ‘I am over eighty now,’ replied the old lady, ‘and ever since the day I came here as
a girl and was married to your father, I have led a sheltered life. I have been blessed
and protected by the family an?cestors. I’ve never even heard of such terrible
goings-on as these. I am too old for it all. I couldn’t bear to see you punished. I’d
rather die, and be spared the ordeal.’
   She burst into tears once again, and Jia Zheng grew more and more agitated about
her condition. Suddenly a voice was heard outside calling:
   ‘News from court for the Master!’
   Jia Zheng hurried out. The Prince of Bei-jing’s aide-de-camp was waiting for him in
the main reception hall, and greeted him with the words:
   ‘Excellent news, sir!’
   Jia Zheng thanked the aide for coming and begged him to be seated.
   ‘What are my instructions from His Highness?’ he asked.
   ‘My master and His Highness the Prince of Xi-ping presented a joint report to His
Majesty, and spoke at some length on your behalf, sir, stressing your penitence and
your great appreciation of the clemency shown to you by the throne. His Majesty
was most sympa?thetic, and mindful of the recent demise of Her Grace, he has
resolved not to punish you, but instead to restore you to your former post as
Under-Secretary at the Board of Works. Of the family property held under restraint,
only that portion belonging to Sir She is to be confiscated. The rest will all be
returned to you. His Majesty urges you to resume your official duties with diligence.
   ‘The matter of the promissory notes will be investigated personally by my master.
Any such notes referring to loans made at usurious rates of interest will be
confiscated outright according to the relevant statute; notes negotiated at
permissible rates, together with title-deeds of houses and land, will all be returned.
Jia Lian is to be deprived of his position and rank, but otherwise will be exempted
from further punishment and released.’
   Jia Zheng rose from his seat and kowtowed in the appropriate direction for this act
of Imperial clemency. He also bowed to the aide to express his profound gratitude for
the prince’s intervention on his behalf.
   ‘Be so good as to convey my thanks to His Highness. Tomorrow I shall attend court
in order to express my gratitude to His Majesty in person, and shall also present
myself at His Highness’s palace to make my kowtow.’
   The prince’s aide took his leave. Shortly afterwards a court official arrived to
proclaim the Edict, followed by the officers entrusted with its execution, who
supervised the proceedings scrupulously, confis?cating only what had been specified,
and restoring everything else to its owner. Jia Lian was released, while Jia She’s
domestic staff, men and women alike, were all taken away into public service.
   Jia Lian’s position was not to be envied. Some of the promissory notes and
documents were returned, and none of his other property had been officially
confiscated, but his apartment had been ransacked and nothing but the bare
furniture had been left in place. His initial relief at being set free and escaping the
punishment he feared soon gave way to a profound sense of loss, when he beheld his
own and Xi-feng’s possessions of a lifetime - altogether about sixty thousand taels’
worth - gone in a morning’s work. His father’s imprisonment, Xi-feng’s critical state of
health: the strain was almost more than he could bear. And now he had to face Jia
Zheng, who summoned him and berated him, barely suppressing a sob:
   ‘I have, alas, been too busy of late with my official duties, and have paid
insufficient attention to family matters. I thought I could rely on you and your wife. I
can hardly remonstrate with your father for his misconduct; but this usury that has
come to light - who in heaven’s name is responsible for that? Families like ours simply
do not dabble in such things. The documents have been confiscated, and both
principal and interest are forfeit: but it’s not the money, it’s the appalling blow this
will deal to our reputation!’
   Jia Lian fell to his knees:
   ‘In managing our family’s affairs, Uncle, I have never acted with a view to private
gain. All the accounts have been kept by the stewards- Lai Da, Wu Xin-deng, Dai Liang
and the others. Please summon them and hear the truth from their lips. These past
few years, our expenditure has far exceeded our income, and there have been
deficits in the accounts that I have simply been unable to make good, despite the
numerous unsecured debts I have had to negotiate. Aunt Wang will be able to tell
you all about it. As for the money loaned out, even I have no idea where that has
come from. You’d better ask Zhou Rui and Brightie.’
   ‘So, you are telling me you don’t even know what goes on in your own apartment,
let alone the rest of the household! I shall not pursue this matter any further with
you at present. Consider yourself ex?tremely lucky to have been let off so lightly.
Now you’d better stir yourself and find out what’s happening to your father and
Cousin Zhen.’
   Jia Lian felt very hard done by, but swallowed his tears and departed in obedience
to his uncle’s instructions.
   Left alone, Jia Zheng ruminated on the family’s misfortunes, heaving many a
heartfelt sigh:
   ‘It was in vain that my grandfather and my great-uncle served the throne so loyally,
winning the family great honour and two hereditary titles. Now both our houses have
been disgraced, both titles have been stripped from us. And if I look further ahead, I
can see no respite, no rising star in the younger generation capable of stemming this
tide of degeneration! Great Heaven! That our noble line should have come to this!
Thanks to an act of exceptional clemency on His Majesty’s part, I have been spared,
and my property has been restored. But both households must now look to me for
their daily sustenance, and how can I hope to support them all? This latest revelation
of Lian’s is another grievous blow; not only have we no reserves, we are seriously in
debt. We have evidently been living under false pretences for years! And I have only
my own stupidity to blame! How can I have been so blind? If only my eldest son were
still alive! In Zhu I might at least have had some support. But Bao-yu, for all that he is
my son, and now a grown man, can offer me no help whatsoever.’
   Throughout this silent soliloquy Jia Zheng had been weeping despite himself, and
the collar of his gown was damp with tears.
   ‘As for Mother - so far from supporting her in her old age, we have nearly driven
her to her death. Whom can I blame for this calamitous state of affairs but myself?’
   He was brooding like this, sunk in the deepest gloom and self-reproach, when a
servant entered to announce the arrival of various friends and relations. Jia Zheng
received them, thanking them each individually for their concern.
   ‘These misfortunes of ours,’ he said to them, by way of apology, ‘are the direct
consequence of my own failure to inculcate proper standards in the younger
generation.’
   ‘We beg to differ,’ replied one of them. ‘We have long considered Sir She’s conduct
questionable. And Mr Zhen has been even more arrogant and dissolute in his ways.
Now their misdemeanours have come to light and have brought them public censure.
The fault lies entirely with them. It is most regrettable that their misdeeds should
have rebounded on you, sir.’
   ‘I have known many cases of similar conduct,’ commented another, ‘but none of
them involved an indictment like this. Mr Zhen must have somehow caused
offence . .’
   ‘The intervention of the censor in this case can be easily explained,’ countered
another. ‘It appears that one of your own household ser?vants and some of his less
respectable friends have been spreading unpleasant rumours, and that these reached
the censor’s ears. He wished to substantiate them before proceeding any further, and
persuaded this same servant of yours to go along and give informa?tion. Knowing
how generously you treat your staff, I find it hard to believe that such a thing could
have happened.’
   ‘That’s the way with servants,’ remarked another. ‘They take advan?tage of their
masters’ generosity. Since we are among friends here, I think I may be permitted to
speak my mind. I know what an incor?ruptible man you are, sir; but while you were
in Kiangsi, your reputation was somehow tarnished. That was your servants’ doing.
You will have to be more cautious in future. Although you have escaped with your
own property intact this time, if His Majesty should ever have occasion to question
your integrity again, it might be considerably less pleasant for you.’
   Jia Zheng seemed greatly perturbed by this.
   ‘What do you mean? In what way was my reputation tarnished?’
   ‘There is of course no shred of material evidence,’ came the reply, ‘but we have
heard others say that during your time as Grain Intendant you instructed your
servants to practise extortion.’
   ‘As Heaven is my witness,’ exclaimed Jia Zheng, ‘no such thought even entered my
head! My men were cheating and bullying behind my back. Any more of this sort of
gossip and I shall be finished!’
   ‘It’s no use fretting about the past,’ commented one of the com?pany. ‘But you
should examine your present staff carefully. Weed out any refractory elements
among them and deal with them severely.’
   At that moment one of the janitors entered the room:
   ‘Sir She’s son-in-law, Mr Sun, has sent a servant with a message, sir. His master is
too busy to come in person. This man is instructed to inform you that the Suns are
expecting you to discharge Sir She’s debts.’
   Jia Zheng looked gloomy and harassed, and gave a perfunctory acknowledgement.
His friends laughed contemptuously:
   ‘This Mr Sun has a bad reputation; and it certainly seems well founded. When his
father-in-law has his home raided and his property confiscated, so far from offering
assistance, he comes hounding him for money. It’s preposterous!’
   ‘Let’s not talk of him,’ replied Jia Zheng. ‘That whole match was a blunder on my
elder brother’s part. I should have thought my poor niece had suffered enough at this
young man’s hands, without his having to torment me as well.’
   As he was speaking, Xue Ke appeared.
   ‘I have learned,’ he reported to Jia Zheng, ‘that Commissioner Zhao is insisting on
pursuing every detail of the indictment. I am afraid that Uncle She and Cousin Zhen
will have a hard time of it.’
   ‘You must seek the prince’s help in this matter,’ Jia Zheng’s friends advised him.
‘Without his intervention, you may all be ruined.’
   Jia Zheng thanked his visitors for their advice, which he said he would be sure to
follow, and they all took their leave.
   It was already lighting-up time, and Jia Zheng went to pay his evening respects to
Grandmother Jia, who seemed slightly recovered. He returned to his apartment, and
sat once more silently brooding over Jia Lian and Xi-feng’s reckless behaviour. Their
usury, now that it had come to light, would damage the whole family and he blamed
them bitterly for it. But he reflected also that Xi-feng was gravely ill, and had lost
everything in the raid, which was sure to have been a great additional blow to her,
and decided not to criticize her for the time being, but to contain his anger and say
nothing. The rest of that night passed without further event.
   Early next morning Jia Zheng went to the Palace to give thanks for the Emperor’s
clemency, and afterwards to the palaces of the Prince of Bei-jing and the Prince of
Xi-ping, where he kowtowed to them and begged them to intervene on behalf of Jia
She and Cousin Zhen. The princes spoke reassuringly in reply. Jia Zheng went on to
visit other friends and colleagues to enlist their support.

*

Our narrative turns to Jia Lian. He ascertained, from his enquiries in official quarters,
that his father and Cousin Zhen were indeed facing a serious charge; and seeing that
there was nothing he could do to help, returned despondently home. In his
apartment, Patience sat weeping and watching by Xi-feng’s bedside, while Autumn
could be heard in the side-room grumbling to herself. When Jia Lian came close to
Xi-feng and saw how feeble she was, he could not bring himself to vent his
resentment on her. Patience said to him with tears in her eyes:
   ‘Everything’s gone! We’ll never get any of it back. And look at Mrs Lian, sir. You
must send for a doctor.’
   ‘Psh!’ spat Lian bitterly. ‘I’m only alive by the skin of my teeth; do you expect me to
bother on her behalf?’
   These words did not escape Xi-feng, and she opened her eyes and looked at Jia
Lian in silence. Tears began to trickle down her cheeks. Jia Lian walked out of the
room, and Xi-feng said to Patience:
   ‘You must be more realistic! Now things have come to this, you must put me out of
your mind. I only wish I could die today and have done with it! If I still mean anything
to you, then the one thing I beg of you is to look after little Qiao-jie when I’m gone.
Do that for me, and my soul will thank yours in the next world.’
   Patience burst into tears.
   ‘Come on,’ said Xi-feng, ‘you’re no fool! They may not have come here and said so
to my face, but I know they blame me for what’s happened. It’s not true. It was
others outside who started it. But I admit I was foolish to lend money and create
trouble for myself. All my plans and schemes have come to nothing. My lifetime of
striving has been in vain. I’m broken, I’m the lowest of the low. Cousin Zhen took Mr
Zhang’s fiancée as a concubine and drove her to her death- that’s one of the charges,
isn’t it? Well you know who he is, this Mr Zhang, don’t you? If You Er-jie’s story ever
comes to light, Mr Lian will be disgraced. And then how will I ever face the world? I
wish I could put an end to everything! But how? I can’t bring myself to swallow gold
or take poison. And you talk of sending for a doctor! That’s not showing your love for
me; that’s just prolonging my agony!’
   Patience grew more and more distraught with every word of Xi-?feng’s. She felt
deeply for her, and resolved to keep a closer watch on her, for fear she might give in
to despair.
   Luckily Grandmother Jia knew nothing of such harrowing scenes as these. Her own
recovery and peace of mind were much aided by the knowledge of Jia Zheng’s
reinstatement, and by the constant presence of Bao-yu and Bao-chai at her side. She
had always had a soft spot for Xi-feng, and now she called Faithful to her and said:
   ‘Take these things of mine over to Mrs Lian. And give Patience some money, so
that she can look after her properly. When she is well again, I shall go through the
rest of my belongings carefully and see what else I can find for her.’
   She also told Lady Wang to see to Lady Xing’s needs. The entire Ning-guo estate,
including all their property and servants, had been inventoried and impounded.
Grandmother Jia gave orders for a carriage to be sent to fetch You-shi and Jia Rong’s
wife. These two forlorn ladies and Cousin Zhen’s two concubines, Lovey and Dove,
were the only people left in the once luxurious apartments of Ning?guo House. Not a
single servant had been spared. Grandmother Jia set aside an apartment for them
next to Xi-chun’s, designated four old serving-ladies and two maids to wait on them,
and ordered that their food and other daily requirements should be provided from
the main kitchens. She also sent them clothes and other necessities, and instructed
the accounts office to issue them the same monthly allow?ance as members of the
Rong-guo branch.
   But it was out of the question to squeeze money from accounts to cover the
expenses (mainly bribes) now incurred in gaol by Jia She, Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong.
Xi-feng was penniless and Jia Lian deeply in debt; while Jia Zheng, in his
characteristically ineffectual fashion, could only say:
   ‘I have had a word with various friends, and am confident they will do whatever
they can.’
   Jia Lian could think of no way of raising the money. It was no use turning to
Xi-feng’s side of the family; the Xues were bankrupt, her elder uncle Wang Zi-teng
was dead, and the other Wangs were in no position to help. In the end, in
desperation, he secretly sent a man to the Rong-guo country estates with orders to
effect an urgent sale of one thousand silver taels’ worth of land. This money he used
to provide for the family members in prison. When the servants saw their masters
reduced to such measures, some decided to take advan?tage of the situation and
themselves invented excuses for borrowing against the rent due from the family’s
eastern estates. But we antici?pate a later part of the story.

*

Grandmother Jia saw the family stripped of its hereditary titles; she saw one of her
sons and the two other men in gaol awaiting trial; she heard the incessant
lamentations of Lady Xing and You-shi, and knew that Xi-feng was gravely ill. Bao-yu
and Bao-chai were some comfort to her, but they could not relieve her of the sorrow
and grief that constantly gnawed at her heart. One day towards evening, she sent
Bao-yu back to his apartment, and struggling up unaided from her couch instructed
Faithful and the other maids to go round the mansion and light incense before every
statue of the Buddha. Finally she gave orders for a large bushel-shaped bundle of
joss-sticks to he lit in the open, and leaning on her stick walked out into her
courtyard. Amber knew that she must be intending to pray, and placed a crimson felt
hassock for her to kneel upon. The old lady made her offering of incense, knelt and
kowtowed several times. She chanted the name of Buddha, and with tears in her
eyes began to pray:
   ‘Almighty Lord Buddha! I your humble servant, born into the family of Shi, and
married into the house of Jia, earnestly beseech you to show your compassion. For
many generations we have done no wrong, we have not trodden in the ways of
violence or arrogance. I have done my humble and inadequate best to stay in the
paths of righteousness, to support my husband and to assist my sons. But the
younger generation have acted with wanton recklessness, they have incurred the
wrath of providence, and now our home has been raided and our property taken
from us. My son and two of the younger men are held in prison and must expect the
worst. The blame for all of these misfortunes must rest on my shoulders, for having
failed to teach the younger generation the true principles of conduct. Now I kowtow
and beg Almighty Heaven to protect us. May those in prison see their sorrow turned
to joy, may the ailing swiftly recover their health. May I alone be permitted to carry
the whole family’s burden of guilt! And may the sons and grandsons be forgiven!
Have pity on me, Almighty Heaven, and heed my devout supplication; send me an
early death that I may atone for the sins of my children and grandchildren!’
   As this mumbled prayer came to an end, Grandmother Jia broke down and began
sobbing so pitifully that she all but choked. Faithful and Amber consoled her, helped
her to her feet and escorted her back into the house.
   Lady Wang came in shortly afterwards with Bao-yu and Bao-chai to pay their
evening respects. Grandmother Jia’s tearful state moved them greatly, and they all
three began crying aloud. Bao-chai had her own cause for grief. Her brother’s future
was very precarious; no one knew whether his sentence would be reduced or
whether he would be released from gaol. As for herself, although Jia Zheng and Lady
Wang were not directly affected by recent events, Bao-chai could see that the Jia
family was nevertheless crumbling around her, while her own husband continued to
behave in as moronic and helpless a fashion as ever. As she contemplated her own
plight, her sobs became more heart-rending even than those of Grandmother Jia and
Lady Wang.
   Bao-yu himself succumbed to despair.
   ‘Grandmother is crippled with care in her old age, Mother and Father are weighed
down with sorrow. My sisters and cousins are gone, scattered like clouds on the four
winds, and every day leaves me more alone, with nothing to sustain me but
memories of past happiness, of the golden days of the poetry club in the Garden.
Ever since Cousin Lin’s death, there’s been nothing I can do to shake off this lethargy
and depression, and I only keep myself from perpetual weeping so as not to upset
Chai, who worries herself about her brother and grieves for her mother, and rarely so
much as lets a smile cross her face.’
   Bao-chai’s inconsolable weeping affected him so deeply that finally he began
wailing desperately himself, which in its turn upset Faithful, Suncloud, Oriole and
Aroma, and soon all of them, each for their separate reasons, were sobbing profusely.
Eventually this in?capacitating wave of grief spread to the other maids and there was
no one left to play the part of comforter. A chorus of lamentation filled the room and
reached the ears of the serving-women on night-duty outside, who sent urgent word
to Jia Zheng.
   Jia Zheng was sitting brooding in his study (as had become his wont) when the
news reached him. He sprang up in alarm and hurried towards Grandmother Jia’s
apartment. On his way he heard the sound of many voices wailing in the distance and
feared the worst for the old lady. His heart sank as he hurried on into her apartment.
He found her, however, to his great relief sobbing but alive and well.
  He turned to the assembled family and reproached them:
  ‘At a time like this, you should be comforting Lady Jia, not making matters worse
with all this crying.’
  There was a sudden silence, during which they all looked round at each other in
amazement. Jia Zheng said a few soothing words to Grandmother Jia, then spoke to
the others again before leaving.
  ‘We came here to cheer Lady Jia up,’ they were thinking to them?selves. ‘We
meant to comfort her. How could we forget ourselves like this and make matters
worse!’
  They were still in this state of bewilderment, when an old serving-?woman arrived
with two women from the Shi household. Having curtseyed to Grandmother Jia and
greeted all the others present, they delivered their message:
   ‘Our Master the Marquis, Her Grace the Marchioness and Miss Shi have sent us
with this message: they have heard your news and want to assure you that this will
be nothing more than a temporary setback. They were concerned that Sir Zheng and
Their Ladyships might be unduly distressed, and asked us particularly to say that Sir
Zheng should set his mind at ease. He himself is in no danger. Miss Shi would have
come herself but she is being married in a few days’ time.’
   Grandmother Jia felt a little awkward about expressing her grati?tude to these
serving-women.
   ‘When you return,’ she said, ‘please convey my regards to your Master and
Mistress. What our family has suffered was decreed by fate. Another day I shall call in
person to thank the Marquis and Marchioness for their concern. As for Xiang-yun’s
marriage, I’m sure they must have found her a fine young man for a husband. I
should be so pleased to know a little about his family.’
   ‘His family is not a particularly wealthy one,’ replied the women. ‘But he is a very
nice young man, and has such a gentle nature. We have seen him quite a few times,
and he closely resembles your Master Bao. He also has considerable literary talent.’
   Grandmother Jia was very pleased with this description.
   ‘It sounds most suitable I must say. Xiang-yun is a lucky girl. Her family and ours
have always abided by the old Southern marriage customs, and that is why none of
us have set eyes on the groom to this day. Only recently I was thinking about my own
family, and particularly about Xiang-yun. She has always been my favourite. She used
to spend over half the year with me when she was a little girl. I had meant to find a
nice husband for her myself when she grew up, but with her uncle away from home I
could hardly be the one to take the initiative. Well, fortune has smiled on her, and
she has found a good match, so now I can set my mind at rest. I know that they’ll be
married within the month, and I would have so liked to drink a cup of wine at the
reception- but even that’s out of the question I’m afraid. This latest upheaval has
quite taken my strength away. Please give them my regards when you return, and say
that we all send our very best wishes. And tell Miss Shi she is not to worry on my
account. I’m over eighty now, and if I die I shall have no cause to complain. I have had
more than my share of blessings. My only prayer is that she and her husband may
live happily together to a ripe old age. Then I shall rest content.
   As she spoke, Grandmother Jia could not help weeping. One of the Shi
serving-women replied:
   ‘Please do not distress yourself Lady Jia. Once Miss Shi is married and has
celebrated her Ninth Day, I’m sure she and her husband will come here to pay you
their respects. Then you will be able to see them yourself, and that will make you
happy.’
   Grandmother Jia nodded.
   The women left. Bao-yu seemed to be the only person at all affected by the news
of Xiang-yun’s impending marriage. He looked somewhat bemused, and thought to
himself:
   ‘Why is it that girls have to get married as soon as they grow up? Once they’re
married, they’re bound to change. Even dear Yun has to obey her uncle’s will. Now if
we meet again, it will never be the same. She is bound to be distant towards me.
What is the point of living, if I am to be forever shunned like this?’
   He felt himself becoming tearful again. But for Grandmother Jia’s sake he
endeavoured not to weep and instead sat there brooding silently to himself.
   Jia Zheng was still concerned for Grandmother Jia’s health, and presently he came
in to see how she was. Finding her somewhat improved he went out again and
summoned the steward Lai Da, ordering him to bring the complete register of
household servants employed in responsible positions. He went over this register
with him entry by entry. Apart from Jia She’s servants, who had been taken away,
there were more than thirty families on the register, with a total of two hundred and
twelve male and female servants. Jia Zheng sent for the forty-one male servants at
present employed in the mansion and interrogated them all about the accounts for
the past years- checking with them the totals for income and expenditure in their
various departments. The chief steward presented the ledgers for inspection, and Jia
Zheng could see at a glance that none of the figures balanced. Expenditure
outweighed income by far, and addi?tional expenses had been incurred over several
years in connection with Her Grace the Imperial Concubine. There were several
entries revealing irregular loans raised outside. When he looked at the rents from the
family estates in the Eastern provinces, he could see that in recent years income had
shrunk to less than half what it had been in his grandfather’s time, while the family’s
expenses were ten times as great. This palpable evidence of mismanagement came
as a great shock to him, and he stamped his foot angrily:
    ‘This is monstrous! I thought Lian was competent to handle these things! And now
I find that we have been mortgaging ourselves up to the hilt in order to keep up an
empty show! We’ve been living far beyond our means. This recklessness was bound
to lead to ruin. And it is too late now for me to start introducing economies!’
    He paced up and down with his hands behind his back, unable to devise a remedy
for the family’s deep-seated economic infirmity. His servants knew that their master
had no head for business, and that he would only agitate himself to no avail on this
score.
   ‘It’s no use worrying, sir,’ they advised him. ‘Every household is the same. Even
princes of the realm! If you could but see their accounts, you’d find that they fail to
balance their books too. They just keep up appearances and muddle along from day
to day as best they can. You should think how lucky you’ve been. The Emperor’s been
kind and allowed you to keep your part of the family property. Mind you, even if
everything had been confiscated, you would still have been able to get by somehow
or other!’
   ‘What nonsense you talk!’ cried Jia Zheng angrily. ‘You servants are worthless
rogues, every last one of you! When your masters prosper, you spend their money as
you please; and when there’s nothing left to spend, you beat a retreat at the first
opportunity. What is it to you if we live or die? You say we are lucky not to have had
everything confiscated- but what do you know? Do you realize that with our
reputation as it stands at present, we’ll be hard put to it to avoid bankruptcy. And
with you putting on airs, acting as if you were rich, talking as if you were important,
swindling people left right and centre, we don’t stand a chance. When calamity
strikes, you are quite content to see us take all the consequences. I am informed that
it was one of your number, a servant by the name of Bao Er, who spread the very
rumours that have incriminated my brother and Mr Zhen. Why is his name nowhere
to be seen on this register?’
   ‘Bao Er isn’t officially on our books, sir,’ came the reply. ‘He was originally on the
Ning-guo register. Then he caught Mr Lian’s eye as a trustworthy sort of person, and
both he and his wife were taken on by Mr Lian. His wife died, and after that he went
back to Ning-guo House. Once when you were busy at the Board, sir, and Her Old
Ladyship and Their Ladyships and the other young masters were all away mourning
at the mausoleum, Mr Zhen came over to inspect things on this side, and brought
Bao Er with him. Bao Er went back with him to Ning-guo House again afterwards. It is
so many years since you were involved in matters of this nature, sir, and it is hardly
surprising if such details slip your mind. You probably think his is the only name not
entered on the register. The fact is that every man has several dependants- even
servants have servants of their own!’
   ‘Preposterous!’ exclaimed Jia Zheng.
   An immediate solution to these economic ills still failed to pre?sent itself to Jia
Zheng’s mind, and he sent the servants away. He had already resolved what general
course of action to follow, but decided to wait first to see the nature of the sentence
passed on Jia She and Cousin Zhen.
   A day or so later, he was in his study puzzling his head over some figures, when a
servant came hurrying in to inform him that his presence was immediately required
at court. Jia Zheng set off at once, in a state of extreme trepidation. To learn whether
the outcome was favourable or otherwise, please turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 107

Impelled by family devotion, Grandmother Jia
distributes her personal possessions
Favoured with an Imperial dispensation, Jia Zheng
receives his brother’s hereditary rank




Jia Zheng arrived at the Palace, and greeted the various princes and ministers of the
Privy Council assembled there to meet him.
   ‘His Majesty has instructed us to send for you,’ said the Prince of Bei-jing. ‘He
would like us to ask you one or two questions.’
   Jia Zheng fell hastily to his knees, and the inquisition proceeded:
   ‘Were you aware that your elder brother had connived with a provincial official for
personal gain? That he had abused his influence and bullied a defenceless citizen?
That he had permitted his son to indulge in gambling and loose living, and that this
same son forcefully took to his bed the fiancée of an innocent person and drove her
to her death when she would not gratify his desires? Were you aware of all this?’
   Jia Zhen replied as best he could:
   ‘Upon the expiry of my term of office as Education Commis?sioner, an
appointment I owed to the gracious favour of His Majesty, I was engaged at first in
supervising relief measures, and then on my return home at the end of last winter I
was deputed by my superiors to inspect reconstruction work and was sub?sequently
appointed Grain Intendant for Kiangsi Province. From this last post I returned to the
capital under impeachment, and have now resumed my former position at the Board
of Works. I have truly endeavoured to be diligent in the performance of all these
official duties, but I fear that I have completely neglected to keep my own household
in order. For this inexcusable shortcoming on my part, for my abject failure to instruct
my sons and nephews in the true principles of conduct, for my base ingratitude to
the throne, I can only beg that His Majesty will punish me with fitting severity.’
   The Prince of Bei-jing went in to communicate this to the Emperor, and after a
short while returned with the Imperial Edict, which he declaimed to the assembled
company:
   ‘We have received an indictment from the Censorate stating that Jia She connived
with a provincial official and abused his own per?sonal influence to bully a
defenceless citizen. The provincial official named by the censor was the prefect of
Ping-an. Jia She, so the impeachment reads, was in communication with this prefect
with a view to perverting the true course of justice. When closely inter?rogated,
however, Jia She testified that the prefect was in fact a relation of his by marriage
and that their connection was a purely personal one. The censor has therefore been
unable to substantiate this part of the charge. Another part, however, has been
verified, namely that Jia She abused his personal influence in coercing the man
named Stony to part with a set of antique fans. These fans were none the less trifles,
and the case must therefore be distinguished from serious cases of extortion. Stony’s
subsequent suicide can also be ascribed to his own eccentricity, and he cannot be
strictly con?sidered to have been “driven to his death”. We see fit to show leniency to
Jia She, and hereby sentence him to penal service at a military post on the
Mongolian border, where he shall redeem himself by diligent service.
   ‘With reference to the first charge brought against Jia Zhen, that he forcefully took
to his bed the betrothed of an innocent citizen and drove her to her death when she
would not gratify his desires: upon consulting the original records at the Censorate,
We find that the lady in question, a certain Miss You Er-jie, was betrothed to a certain
Zhang Hua when both were still in their mothers’ wombs. The marriage was never
solemnized, indeed Zhang himself wished to annul it on the grounds of his own
poverty. The lady’s mother was also quite willing for her daughter to be taken as a
concubine, not by Jia Zhen himself but by his younger cousin. So clearly this was not
a case of forceful appropriation. Then the case of Miss You San-jie: the charge here is
that following her suicide she was buried secretly and the facts of her death were
concealed from the authorities. On further investigation it has been found that this
Miss You San-jie was the younger sister of Jia Zhen’s wife, and that it was his original
intention to arrange a marriage for her. The widespread and malicious rumours
circulating about her character, her own subsequent feelings of shame and remorse
and the insistence of her fiancé that she should return his betrothal gifts were the
cause of her suicide, not any direct maltreatment or coercion on the part of Jia Zhen.
As the holder of a hereditary rank, however, Jia Zheng deserves to be severely
punished for his ignorance of the law and for his failure to report the burial of a
deceased person. In view of the fact that he is a descendant of a loyal and
distinguished subject, We cannot bring ourselves to impose the heavy penalty strictly
required by law, but choose to exercise Our discretion, hereby sentencing him to be
stripped of his hereditary rank and sent to a maritime frontier region, there to
redeem himself by diligent service. Jia Rong, who is too young to have been involved
in these affairs, is acquitted. Jia Zheng has for many years held provincial posts in
which he has served conscientiously and pru?dently, and he is absolved from the
consequences of his failure to govern his household correctly.’
   Jia Zheng responded to the Edict with tears of gratitude, and hastily kowtowed,
first in the direction of the Imperial throne, then towards the prince, whom he
begged to convey to the Emperor a humble plea of devotion.
   ‘A simple kowtow will suffice,’ said the prince. ‘There is no need of anything
further.’
   ‘My gratitude to His Majesty, for so graciously absolving me of blame, and for
restoring my portion of the family property, knows no bounds,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘I feel
a great sense of inner remorse. Please allow me to donate to the Imperial purse all
my hereditary emoluments and accumulated property.’
   ‘His Majesty is indeed humane and compassionate towards His subjects,’ replied
the prince. ‘He is wise and discriminating in his judgements, and never errs, whether
it be in recompensing virtue or in punishing vice. In having your property thus
restored, you have been blessed with his exceptional favour. There is really no call for
any further gesture on your part.’
   The other gentlemen present concurred.
   So Jia Zheng kowtowed again, first towards the Emperor and then to the prince,
and left the Palace, hurrying home to hear the news to Grandmother Jia, knowing
the anxious suspense in which she would be awaiting his return. The entire Jia
household, menfolk and womenfolk, were waiting anxiously at the entrance of
Rong-guo House to learn the outcome of his interview, and breathed a huge sigh of
relief when they saw him return safely home. None dared to question him as he
hurried past them and on into Grandmother Jia’s apartment. He recounted to her the
details of the latest Edict; and Grandmother Jia, though pleased that some of the
charges had been dropped, was understandably distressed to learn that the two titles
were lost to the family and that both Jia She and Cousin Zhen were sentenced to
penal servitude. Lady Xing and You-shi simply broke down when they heard the
news.
   ‘You must not distress yourself Mother,’ pleaded Jia Zheng. ‘Although Brother She
will have to work at the Mongolian frontier post, he will still be serving the nation,
and will not be maltreated. If he acquits himself creditably, he may be fully reinstated.
As for Zhen, he is still a young man and a bit of hard work certainly won’t do him any
harm. This is a lesson we would have had to learn sooner or later. We cannot rest for
ever on the laurels of our forefathers.’
   He added a few more words of this kind, which comforted Grand?mother Jia. After
all, she had never been particularly fond of Jia She, and Cousin Zhen was not her own
grandson. But Lady Xing and You-shi were inconsolable.
   ‘We are ruined!’ thought Lady Xing to herself. ‘With my husband sent into exile in
his old age, who can I turn to? Lian is supposed to be my son, but he has always
attached himself more to his uncle Zheng than to his own father. Now that we are all
dependent on Zheng, Lian and Xi-feng are bound to lean even more towards that
side of the family. I shall be completely abandoned; I have nothing to look forward to
but loneliness and misery for the rest of my days.’
   You-shi had always been in charge of Ning-guo House, and apart from Cousin Zhen
she was the only one of the family to have earned the respect of the domestic staff.
She and Cousin Zhen had a happy marriage moreover. Now he was to be sent away in
disgrace, everything they had was confiscated, and they would be obliged to look to
the Rong-guo branch for support. Grandmother Jia loved her well enough, but still,
she would be the recipient of charity, and she would have to bring Lovey and Dove
along with her, not to mention young Rong and his wife, who were still too young to
be independent.
   ‘It was really Lian’s fault that my sisters came to such a wretched end,’ she
reflected. ‘And yet he and Xi-feng have survived unscathed, while we are reduced to
this desperate state of affairs.’
   Grandmother Jia was greatly affected by You-shi’s disconsolate sobbing, and she
turned to Jia Zheng and asked him:
   ‘Now that their sentence has been pronounced, will your brother She and young
Zhen be allowed to come home to say goodbye? Rong has been acquitted, so I
assume that he will be set free.’
   ‘In the normal course of events such a visit would not be allowed,’ replied Jia
Zheng. ‘But I have already asked if as a personal favour Brother She and Cousin Zhen
could be allowed home to make preparations for their departure, and the Board of
Punishments has most graciously agreed to make this concession. I assume that Rong
will be set free and will accompany them. Now, please don’t you worry, Mother. I
shall do all I can for them.’
   ‘I’m growing old and senile,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s years since I last enquired
about the family’s finances. The Ning-guo side has had everything confiscated, I know,
and that of course includes the house itself. On our side, your brother She and Lian
have had their things taken too. Now, you’d better tell me: how much money do we
have left? And what are our estates in the Eastern provinces worth? When those two
have to go, we must give them a few thousand taels of silver to take with them.’
   Jia Zheng saw himself caught.
   ‘If I tell the truth,’ he thought to himself, ‘I fear it will come as a great blow. But if I
conceal it, heaven alone knows how we will be able to pay for our present needs, let
alone manage in the future.’
   ‘Had you not asked, Mother,’ he began, ‘I would never have bothered you with this.
But since you have asked, and since Lian is present, I am bound to say that yesterday
I examined the family accounts, and discovered the truth. Which is this: our
exchequer has for a long time been completely empty- in fact, more than empty.
There are substantial debts. I must somehow find money, and without delay, to
mollify the officials involved in Brother She’s case. Without such intervention I fear
they will both suffer, despite His Majesty’s generous concern. I am still not certain
how this money can be raised. The Eastern estates cannot be depended on for
anything. The rents for the forthcoming year have long been borrowed against. Our
only recourse will be to sell what clothes and jewellery they are lucky enough to have
left in their possession, and to let Brother She and Cousin Zhen take the proceeds of
that sale with them. How we ourselves will manage afterwards is another matter
altogether.’
   Grandmother Jia was once more reduced to floods of tears.
   ‘Is it really so desperate? Can we have fallen so low? I’ve never experienced
anything like this. I can remember my own family in the old days; they were ten
times as grand as us, yet they managed to live beyond their means for years. And
even in the end, no such calamity as this ever befell them. It was more gradual. It
must have been a year or two before they were finished. But you seem to be saying
that we may not even last another year!’
   ‘If only we still had the two hereditary state emoluments to fall back on,’ said Jia
Zheng. ‘Then we might be able to procure a loan. But as things stand, no one is going
to lend us a penny.’
   Even his cheeks were now streaming with tears.
   ‘It’s certainly no use turning to our own relatives for help,’ he continued. ‘The ones
that owe us a favour are penniless, and the ones that don’t are unlikely to come
forward and help us now. I did not examine the accounts in any detail yesterday, but I
did glance at the register of household staff. We can barely afford to keep ourselves
alive, let alone such a host of servants.’
   These final details in Jia Zheng’s tale of financial woe plunged Grandmother Jia in
still deeper gloom. Presently Jia She, Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong arrived and paid her
their respects. The sight of them somehow brought home to her the true horror of
their pre?dicament. She took Jia She by one hand, Cousin Zhen by the other and
burst out sobbing. The two men hung their heads in shame and, when she began
weeping, fell to their knees and cried:
   ‘We have dishonoured the family! We have forfeited the glory won by our
forefathers! We have brought you grief! We are not even worthy to be buried when
we die!’
   At this a chorus of wailing filled the room.
  ‘Come on now,’ urged Jia Zheng. ‘We must lose no time in thinking of a way to
provide them with funds. They can stay with us only a day or two at the most.’
  Grandmother Jia did her best to contain her grief.
  ‘Go now, both of you,’ she said, holding back her tears, ‘and speak with your
wives.’ She turned to Jia Zheng: ‘There must be no delay, and I can see it would be
futile trying to borrow. We have so little time. I shall have to do something myself. Oh
dear, this is all so dreadfully confusing! Things mustn’t be allowed to go on like this!’
  She called Faithful to her and sent her off with some secret in?structions.
  Jia She and Cousin Zhen meanwhile left the room and conversed tearfully with Jia
Zheng outside, expressing their remorse for their past waywardness and anticipating
with gloom the bitter exile that lay ahead. Then they went over and lamented with
their wives. Jia She was growing old, and the prospect of separation was less
har?rowing for him and Lady Xing than it was for Cousin Zhen and You-shi.
  Jia Lian and Jia Rong held their fathers’ hands and wept at their side. Frontier
service was a less severe punishment than military exile, but it would still be a long
and painful ordeal. They could only try to steel themselves to it as best they could.

   Grandmother Jia told Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Faithful and a bevy of maids to look
through every one of her trunks and boxes, and to take out all the personal
belongings she had stored away over the years of her marriage. Then she summoned
Jia She, Jia Zheng, Cousin Zhen and all the other menfolk to attend while she made a
distribution. She began by giving Jia She three thousand taels of silver.
   ‘You are to take two thousand with you,’ she said, ‘for the journey and for any
expenses afterwards, and leave one thousand here for your wife. This three thousand
is for you, Zhen. You must take one thousand with you, and leave two thousand for
your wife. In this way, although they will be living with us, they will still be
independ?ent and able to make separate catering arrangements. I shall provide for
Xi-chun’s marriage when the time comes. Now Xi-feng; I feel sorry for her, she tried
so hard for so long, and has ended up with nothing. She too shall have three
thousand taels, and she is to keep all of it for her own use and not give a penny to
Lian. I know she is much too ill now, and in no fit state to come and receive it herself,
so Patience can take it to her.
   ‘Here are some robes that once belonged to my husband, and some of the gowns
and jewellery that I used to wear when I was young - I don’t need them any more.
The men’s clothing can be divided between She, Zhen, Lian and Rong. Their wives can
share the ladies’ things. This five hundred taels of silver is for Lian to pay for
transporting Miss Lin’s coffin to the South next year.’
   When this distribution was complete, she turned to Jia Zheng:
   ‘The debts you mentioned must be honoured at once. Take this gold and use it for
that purpose. Their misdeeds have driven me to these drastic measures, but don’t
think I have forgotten that you too are my son. In due time you will receive your fair
share. Bao-yu is married and can have what is left here - gold and silver worth several
thousand taels. And Li Wan: she has always been such a dutiful granddaughter-in-law
to me, and little Lan is such a sweet child. Here’s some for them too. There, I’ve
finished.’
   Jia Zheng was moved to tears to see how clearly she had worked everything out.
   ‘We have failed you, Mother!’ he sobbed, falling to his knees. ‘We have not done
our filial duty towards you in your old age; and yet you shower us with such bounty!
How can we ever outlive our shame!’
   ‘Oh poppycock!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t you worry, if it weren’t for this
crisis I should certainly have kept it all for myself! But let’s be serious: our staff is
much too large. You are the only one left with an official post, Zheng, so we don’t
need more than a few servants. Tell the stewards to call the staff together and make
the necessary arrangements. Each establishment must make do with as few servants
as possible. We would have had to manage with none at all if our household had
been confiscated. The same goes for the ladies’ apartments. We must find husbands
for some of the maids, and give others back their freedom. And although our
property has not been taken, I still think it would be best if you handed over the
Garden. Lian should be given the job of sorting out the country estates. Some can be
sold, some kept on, as seems most appropriate. Above all there must be no more
pomp in future, no more empty show. We must be realistic. And another thing I
should mention. We still have some money belonging to the Zhen family of Nanking.
It’s in safe keeping with your wife, Zheng. Someone should be sent to take it back to
them straight away. If anything else should happen to us, we’d only involve them in a
lot more trouble, push them out of the frying-pan and into the fire.’
    Jia Zheng, who was painfully aware of his own incompetence in such matters,
mumbled a contrite ‘Yes, Mother’ to all of these eminently practical instructions,
thinking to himself:
    ‘What a flair she has for organization! And what worthless bunglers we all are by
comparison!’
    He could see that Grandmother Jia was tired, and begged her to lie down and rest.
    ‘The little you see here is all I have left,’ she said. ‘When I die, you can use some of
it to pay for my funeral, and give the remainder to my maids.’
    They found this mention of her death greatly upsetting, and all fell to their knees
once more.
    ‘Please set your mind at ease, Mother. In time to come, if we enioy your blessing
and can once more regain His Majesty’s favour, then we shall do our utmost to atone
for past errors, to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth
year.’
   ‘If you can only somehow make amends,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘then perhaps I
shall be able to face our ancestors with pride when I die. Don’t think that I know only
how to enjoy a comfortable life, and that I have no stomach for poverty! That’s not it
at all. It’s just that I am rather shocked by all this. During the past few years you have
seemed so prosperous, and I was only too glad not to interfere; to jolly along and
mind my own business. I never for one moment imagined that we were in such a
precarious state. I’ve always known that we were living beyond our means, of course,
but I thought somehow we’d manage to muddle through. I suppose we were “dulled
by habit”; we couldn’t adjust, we were too used to things as they were. Well now we
must use this opportunity to economize and set things to rights, or else our family
will be the laughing-stock of the world. You may think it’s the poverty that appals me.
But it’s not. What I have always cared about more than anything is our family
tradition, our family honour. Every day of my life has been lived in the hope that this
generation would outshine our ancestors. But I would have been content just to
maintain our position as it was. I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those
two were up to behind my back!’
   Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying
into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster:
   ‘Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and she’s
cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you
know.’
   ‘How is Mrs Lian?’ Grandmother Jia asked her before she’d finished speaking. ‘Not
at all well today,’ replied Lady Wang on Felicity’s behalf.
   ‘Aii’ exclaimed the old lady, rising wearily to her feet. ‘These young people are the
bane of my life! I can see they want to drive me into my grave!’
   She asked her maids to assist her and announced her intention of paying Xi-feng a
visit herself. Jia Zheng hastened to detain her, and endeavoured to calm her down:
   ‘This has all been so distressing for you, Mother. You have already exerted yourself
so much in finding a solution to our problems. You really must give yourself a bit of a
rest. I am sure my wife can go over and see to Xi-feng. There is no need for you to
expose yourself to any further upsets. If anything serious were to happen to you,
how should I ever forgive myself.’
   ‘You may all leave now,’ ordered Lady Jia. ‘Come back a little later. There are still a
few things I want to say.’
   Jia Zheng, his attempt at filial consolation having been thus peremptorily crushed,
did not venture to say any more. He went out to superintend the practical
arrangements for the convicts’ departure and instructed Jia Lian to choose some
servants to accompany them.
   Faithful assembled a group of serving-women to carry Xi-feng’s presents and to
escort Grandmother Jia over to Xi-feng’s apartment. Xi-feng was very weak and
almost unconscious, while Patience’s eyes were red and swollen from crying. When
she heard that Lady Jia and Lady Wang, accompanied by Bao-yu and Bao-chai, were
on their way, Patience hurried out anxiously to greet them.
   ‘How is she now?’ asked Grandmother Jia the moment she saw Patience.
   Patience was afraid of frightening the old lady.
   ‘A little better, ma’am.’
   She escorted the party inside and hurrying over to Xi-feng’s bed lightly drew aside
the bed curtains. Xi-feng opened her eyes and, when she saw Grandmother Jia enter
the room, was filled with shame. Earlier she had come to the conclusion that the
whole family had turned against her, that no one cared for her any more, that they
were all indifferent whether she lived or died. And yet now Grand?mother Jia had
come to visit her personally. Her spirits were immedi?ately restored, and she even
struggled to sit up; but Grandmother Jia ordered Patience to settle her down again.
   ‘Don’t you move, dear,’ she said to Xi-feng. ‘Are you feeling a little better now?’
‘Oh yes, Grannie, I am. A lot better,’ replied Xi-feng, holding back her tears. ‘But it
grieves me when I think how you and Mother and Aunt Wang have loved me, ever
since I came here as a young bride, and how little I have been able to return that love.
How cruelly fate has possessed me, driving me quite out of my mind, making me fail
in my duty to you and Aunt Wang, preventing me from ever winning your praise ...
Yet still you trusted me, still you allowed me to play my part. And all I’ve ever done is
ruin things for everyone! How can I look you and Auntie in the face again? This visit is
more than I deserve. I’m afraid Heaven will punish me for it, by taking away most of
the few days I may have left to live...
   She sobbed violently.
   ‘This whole nonsense was started by the men,’ Grandmother Jia consoled her. ‘It
was nothing to do with you. I know some of your belongings have been taken, but
don’t you worry: I’ve brought you all sorts of presents - take a look and see.’
   She instructed one of the serving-women to bring the presents forward and exhibit
them. Possessions had always meant a great deal to Xi-feng, and the sudden loss of
all of her worldly goods had dealt a severe blow to her morale. She had also been
tormenting herself with the thought that everyone in the family secretly blamed her
for what had happened, and as a consequence she had all but lost her will to live.
This new evidence of Grandmother Jia’s affection was a much-needed tonic; and it
seemed that Lady Wang was not really so cross with her either, to judge from the fact
that she had accompanied Grandmother Jia. And had Jia Lian not been acquitted,
after all? Xi-?feng kowtowed to Grandmother Jia from her pillow:
   ‘Please don’t worry on my behalf, Grannie. If I can continue to enjoy your blessing,
and if I recover my health, I’ll gladly be your lowliest maidservant and do any menial
task, devote myself heart and soul for the rest of my life to serving you and Aunt
Wang.’
   This abject gratitude was too pitiful a sight for Grandmother Jia, and she broke
down and wept. Bao-yu immediately followed suit. He had never witnessed anything
resembling a family crisis. His life till recently had consisted for the most part of
peaceful and pleasant pursuits, and he had been protected from too close an
acquaintance with real suffering. But now wherever he turned he saw anguish and
weeping. It had the effect of accentuating his imbecility; and if he saw anyone else
crying, he instantly responded by doing likewise.
   Seeing what low spirits her visitors were in, Xi-feng did her best to muster a few
cheerful words, and then begged Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to return to their
apartments, promising to come and kowtow to them as soon as she was well enough.
She raised her head feebly from the pillow as she spoke.
   ‘Look after her well now,’ Grandmother Jia enjoined Patience. ‘And if you’re short
of anything, be sure to come and let me know.’
   She took Lady Wang back with her to her own apartment. On the way, she could
hear the sound of weeping coming from every quarter. It was more than she could
bear. She sent Lady Wang away and told Bao-yu to bid his Uncle She and Cousin Zhen
farewell and to return immediately afterwards.
    Left on her own, she sank onto her couch in tears. Faithful tried every way she
knew of consoling her, and finally Grandmother Jia dozed off.
    Understandably Jia She and Cousin Zhen viewed the prospect of their exile with
little relish. The men chosen to accompany them were equally reluctant to go, and
complained bitterly of their lot. To be parted in life is in truth more painful than to be
parted by death, and the witnessing of such a parting often more distressing than the
parting itself. Rong-guo House, once a scene of such brilliance and distinction, now
echoed with the sounds of wailing and lamentation.
    Jia Zheng had always been a great stickler for formalities, and despite everything
he continued to observe towards Jia She the solemn respect prescribed towards an
elder brother. The two brothers shook hands at home, and Jia Zheng then rode out
ahead to beyond the city walls and there waited to drink the ritual farewell cup of
wine. He exhorted Jia She to remember the compassion the state had shown him on
his ancestors’ account, and to prove himself worthy of it. Jia She and Cousin Zhen
wiped the tears from their eyes, and set off for their different destinations.
   Jia Zheng returned home with Bao-yu. As they neared the gateway of Rong-guo
House they saw a crowd gathered outside and heard a confused hubbub of voices:
   ‘An Imperial Edict issued today! The Rong-guo hereditary rank and title to be
passed on to Sir Zheng!’
   The men in the crowd were demanding their statutory tip for bringing this good
news, but the janitors were resisting vigorously:
   ‘The title belonged to the family in the first place, and was inherited by our
masters. That’s not worth a tip!’
   ‘Come on!’ came the indignant reply. ‘Think of the glory! A title like that is the
most glorious thing there is - and your Sir She could never hope to get it back, not
after what he’s done. Now His Majesty, in his wisdom and mercy, greater than the
sky is broad, has passed it on to Sir Zheng; why, that’s nothing less than a miracle for
your family! Definitely worth a tip!’
   Jia Zheng entered the house and received a full report on the matter from the
janitors. His pleasure was inevitably mingled with shame that his own good fortune
had been made possible only by his elder brother’s disgrace. He was momentarily
overwhelmed and wept tears of emotion. Then he hurried in to convey the news to
Grand?mother Jia, who took him delightedly by the hand and urged him to show
himself worthy of this signal honour. Lady Wang was also present, anxious that
Grandmother Jia might be souffrante and in need of consolation, and she too was
delighted to hear Jia Zheng’s news. Only Lady Xing and You-shi felt their own
misfortune the more keenly, an emotion they took pains to conceal.

*

The family’s sponging friends and relatives, who had kept well clear while times were
hard, learned that Jia Zheng had now been given his brother’s title and - deducing
from this that the Emperor must still view the Jias with a favourable eye - flocked to
Rong-guo House to offer their felicitations. But Jia Zheng’s feelings were running
along very different lines. He was by nature a man of such soul-searching integrity
that, so far from congratulating himself on his good luck, he was greatly troubled at
heart, and wondered how he would ever be able to show his gratitude sufficiently.
The fol?lowing day he went to the Palace to make a formal expression of thanks, and
this time went so far as to submit a memorial begging that his restored residence,
together with Prospect Garden, be accepted as a gift by the Emperor. An Edict was
issued in reply to this request, dismissing it as quite superfluous; and Jia Zheng, his
conscience a little placated, returned home and applied himself with devotion and
zeal to his official duties.
   The family’s finances were still as precarious as ever. Income continued to fall far
short of expenditure. Entertaining, making connections with the right people and
winning favours were not Jia Zheng’s strong point. The servants knew how
incorrigibly upright he was, while Xi-feng was still sick and unable to apply her
experience to the solving of the present crisis. The debts Jia Lian was forced to incur
were mounting daily, and it seemed almost inevitable that he would have to
mortgage still more property and sell still more land. The servants could see it
coming. Some of them were quite wealthy themselves and were worried that Jia Lian
might come to them for money. Some tried to keep out of harm’s way by feigning
poverty, some asked for leave of absence and went looking for other em?ployment.
   One exception was Bao Yong. Though he was a newcomer and had arrived only a
short while before the crisis, he proved to be a most industrious and loyal servant,
and was appalled by the way the other servants were taking advantage of their
masters. He had insufficient status among the domestic staff to dare voice his
feelings to the offenders, and could only eat his evening meal and take his
indignation to bed. The others disliked him for not going along with them, and
complained about him to Jia Zheng, calling him an incompetent, a drunkard and a
troublemaker.
   ‘Let him be,’ was Jia Zheng’s response. ‘He was recommended to me by the Zhens,
and we cannot be too hard on him. After all, we may be poor, but we can surely
afford to feed one extra mouth.’
   When they failed in their attempts to have him sacked by the master, the servants
turned next to Jia Lian with their complaints; but Jia Lian felt in no position to exert
his authority, and in the end they had to let Bao Yong be.
   One day Bao Yong was feeling particularly angry and, having drunk a few cups of
wine to comfort himself, went for a stroll in the street outside the main entrance to
Rong-guo House, where he happened to overhear the following conversation:
   ‘See that great mansion in there?’ said one of the two men, pointing to Rong-guo
House. ‘Wonder how they’re managing after that raid the other day...’
   ‘Oh they’ll be all right!’ replied the other. ‘I’ve heard that one of their daughters
was a concubine of His Majesty’s. She’s dead now, but a connection like that doesn’t
die so quickly. And they’re on hob-nobbing terms with all sorts of princes, dukes,
marquises and earls. They’ll never be short of friends. Take the present Mayor, who
used to be Minister of War, he’s from the same family. With people like that to look
after them, they’ll always be all right.’
   ‘Hm!’ replied the first. ‘You may live locally, but I can see you’re rather out of touch.
I don’t know about their other friends, but that Mayor Jia you mentioned is a regular
bounder! I’ll tell you why I say that. I’ve seen him at Rong-guo House countless times,
so I know he’s had a lot to do with them in the past. When the censor brought that
indictment against members of the Jia family, the Emperor asked him to look into the
matter and establish the facts of the case. And what do you think he did? Because he
owed both branches of the family big favours himself, and because he was afraid he’d
be suspected of covering up for his own friends, he went to the other extreme. He
said the most terrible things about them. That’s what led to both houses being
raided. It’s shocking how people treat their friends nowadays, isn’t it!’
   This casual conversation happened to fall on the ears of one who understood only
too clearly what it meant.
   ‘That such a scoundrel should live and breathe on this earth!’ thought Bao Yong
secretly to himself. ‘I wonder what relation of the Master’s he is? If I so much as set
eyes on him, I’ll beat the innards out of him! To hell with the consequences!’
   Wild (and somewhat befuddled) thoughts of revenge filled Bao Yong’s loyal breast.
Suddenly the cry of official runners could be heard clearing the way, and from where
he was standing Bao Yong heard one of the bystanders whisper to the other:
   ‘Why, here he comes now, the very Mayor Jia we were talking about!’
   Bao Yong was seething with righteous indignation, and the wine lent him the final
touch of inspiration and courage.
   ‘Blackguard!’ he yelled recklessly. ‘Scurvy knave! Would you forget the kindness
shown you by our masters the Jias?’
   From within his sedan Jia Yu-cun heard the name ‘Jia’ and leaned forward to see
what was going on. Just another drunken lout in the street, not worth bothering with.
His sedan moved on, and Bao Yong swaggered home feeling very pleased with
himself and far too drunk to be discreet. He made a few enquiries, and his
fellow-?servants confirmed that the Mayor did indeed owe his entire career to the
patronage of the Jia family.
   ‘Well he’s an ungrateful scoundrel, and I’ve told him so!’ boasted Bao Yong. ‘After
all they’ve done for him, to kick them in the teeth like that! I gave him a piece of my
mind, and he didn’t dare answer me back either...
   Until now, the other servants, who were united in their dislike of Bao Yong, had
been unable to persuade Jia Zheng to get rid of him. This was the very pretext they
had been waiting for, and they seized their chance to report him to the Master for
being drunk and dis?orderly and creating a disturbance in the street. Jia Zheng was
ex?tremely nervous of provoking the authorities any further, and was very angry
when he heard of Bao Yong’s riotous behaviour. He summoned him and gave him a
thorough dressing-down. He still felt that in view of his connection with the Zhens it
would be wrong to punish him too severely, and instead transferred him to
caretaking duties in the Garden, with strict instructions not to go wandering outside
again.
   Bao Yong was a straightforward sort of fellow. Once he worked for a man, that man
was his master, to serve and protect with every ounce of loyalty he had. He was
greatly dismayed that Jia Zheng should have listened to tales and been misled into
scolding him in this fashion. But he did not say a word in protest. He merely packed
his bags and moved into the Garden to commence his new duties.

CHAPTER 108

A birthday party held for Sister Allspice necessitates
a false display of jollity
And ghostly weeping heard at the Naiad’s House provokes
a fresh outburst of grief




We have already told how the Emperor rejected Jia Zheng’s plea to donate both
Rong-guo House and Prospect Garden to the throne. None of the Jia family lived in
the Garden any longer, and its gates were permanently locked. You-shi and Xi-chun,
whose temporary lodgings in Rong-guo House adjoined the Garden wall, found it an
eerie and desolate place to be near, and it was partly for this reason that Bao Yong
had been appointed caretaker.
   Jia Zheng now applied himself in earnest to the practicalities of the household, and
in accordance with Grandmother Jia’s instruc?tions endeavoured to implement a
gradual reduction in the size of the staff, and a range of other economies. But he
soon found the task too much for him, and turned for help to Xi-feng. Although Lady
Wang had little affection left for her, Xi-feng was still a favourite of Grandmother Jia’s,
and Jia Zheng judged that one way or another, despite everything, she must have
retained some of her flair for business. She accepted the responsibility with a good
grace, only to discover that the depredations of the Embroidered Jackets and the
financial after-effects of the raid had made it impossible to get anything done in
Rong-guo House. The necessary funds were simply not forthcoming. The ladies and
their maids, from the highest to the lowest, used as they were to a life of ease, and
finding that in their new and greatly reduced circumstances many of their old
everyday luxuries could no longer be afforded, did nothing but complain. Xi-?feng did
her utmost to fulfil her duties, and despite her illness tried to please Grandmother Jia
as best she could.
   Jia She and Cousin Zhen eventually arrived at their designated places of exile.
Thanks to the sums of money they had taken with them, they were comfortable
enough, for the present at any rate, and both wrote home that they were well and
that the family was not to worry on their account. Grandmother Jia was much
relieved, and the news brought a little comfort to their wives.
   Some days later, Shi Xiang-yun, who was now married and had paid her Ninth Day
visit to her own home, came to call on Grand?mother Jia. The old lady said what a
favourable report she had heard of her husband, while Xiang-yun confirmed that
married life was turning out happily for her, and begged Grandmother Jia to set her
mind at rest. At the mention of Dai-yu’s death they both shed tears, and
Grandmother Jia’s distress was further increased by the thought of Ying-chun and her
trials. Xiang-yun remained with her for a time, doing her best to cheer her up, then
went to call on the others, and returned later in the day to Grandmother Jia’s
apartment to rest. The conversation that evening turned to the Xue family, and
Xiang-yun learned from Grandmother Jia how as the result of Pan’s escapade the
Xues were now facing total ruin. Pan’s death sentence had, it is true, been suspended,
and he was still alive in gaol; but there was no telling whether or not they would be
able to save his life by having the sentence commuted the following year.
   ‘And you still haven’t heard about Pan’s wife,’ Grandmother Jia went on. ‘She came
to a very nasty end, and there was nearly the most dreadful scandal. But Lord
Buddha in his all-seeing wisdom caused her own maid to come forward and tell us
the whole story. Mrs Xia for all her antics could do nothing in the face of the truth,
and ended up asking herself for the inquest to be waived. Your aunt Xue gave Pan’s
wife a makeshift burial. She has young Ke living with her now. What a wonderful lad
he is. Such a strong sense of duty! He feels he should postpone his own wedding
until his cousin Pan is released from gaol and his murder case has been resolved. Of
course that makes things rather hard meanwhile for poor Xiu-yan, who has to stay on
with her aunt Xing. And it’s not much better for Bao-qin, who can’t marry her young
Mr Mei until after his period of mourning for his father. Dear oh dear! What with one
thing and another, our relations seem to be in much the same case as we are
ourselves. Let me see now, what other news is there? In the Wang family, your aunt
Wang’s elder brother, your great-uncle Zi-teng, has passed away; Fengie’s elder
brother Ren has disgraced himself; and her second uncle Zi-sheng, your other
great-uncle Wang, has turned out badly too. He couldn’t settle his elder brother’s
debts, and had to come running to us to bale him out. We’ve had no news of the
Zhens, ever since they too were raided and had their property confiscated.’
   ‘Have you had any news from Tan since she left?’ asked Xiang?-yun.
    ‘Since her marriage, your uncle Zheng has returned from his post and he tells me
that Tan is very happy at her new home, even though of course it is so far away down
there on the coast. We still haven’t heard from her directly, and I do worry about her
a great deal. We’ve had so many other troubles to contend with here, I simply
haven’t had time to do anything for her. And then there’s Xi-chun. I still haven’t been
able to find a husband for her. The less said about young Huan the better. Oh, things
have changed greatly since you were here, my dear - greatly for the worse, I’m afraid.
Your poor cousin Chai has not had a day’s peace ever since she married into our
family. And Bao-yu is still as addle-pated as ever. Dear oh dearie me! We really are in
a sorry state!’
    ‘I grew up here,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘so of course I know everyone very well. I can see
for myself how they’ve changed. At first I wondered if perhaps they were just being a
little distant towards me, because I’ve been away so long. But then I thought it over
and could see it wasn’t that at all. They wanted to be their old cheerful selves with
me, but somehow as soon as we started talking they got upset. That’s why I didn’t
stay long and came back here to you, Grannie.’
    ‘I’m old enough to take what’s happened in my stride,’ said Grand-mother Jia. ‘But
the young people seem to go to pieces. I wanted to find some way of cheering them
all up for a day, but then I just couldn’t summon up the energy.’
    ‘I have an idea,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Isn’t it Bao-chai’s birthday the day after tomorrow?
Why don’t I stay on to wish her a happy birthday - then we can all enjoy ourselves for
a day. What do you say, Grannie?’
    ‘Goodness! I am getting gaga!’ exclaimed Grandmother Jia. ‘If you hadn’t
mentioned it I should have forgotten altogether. Of course you’re right! Tomorrow I’ll
give the cooks some money and we’ll have a party. Before Chai married Bao-yu, we
must have celebrated her birthday several times. But not since she’s been part of the
family. Bao-yu, poor child, who used to be such a bundle of mischief and fun, has
been so badly affected by our troubles that he can hardly put two words together. I
can still count on Wan. She never changes, whether times are good or bad. She and
little Lan still spend their days quietly together. She’s a marvel!’
    ‘Xi-feng is the most changed,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘She looks so differ?ent for a start,
and no longer speaks with her old zest. Tomorrow I must see if I can draw them out
and cheer them all up. But I’m afraid that, although they won’t say so, in their hearts
they may resent me for being so lucky and for having...
    She stopped short and blushed fiercely. Grandmother Jia under?stood what she
meant.
    ‘There’s no cause for you to worry on that score, my dear. You and your cousins
grew up together as children. You used to play with each other, you were always
chatting and laughing together. Don’t think of them in that way. We should all learn
to accept life’s ups and downs. We should know how to enjoy prosperity while it lasts,
and how to endure poverty with patience. Your cousin Chai has always taken a broad
view of life. In the old days, when her family were so well off, she never used to put
on airs; and since they’ve fallen on hard times she has been quite unshaken by it all.
Now that she’s part of our family, when Bao-yu is nice to her she is as quiet and
content as ever, and if he leads her a bit of a song and dance occasionally, I’ve never
seen her get ruffled. That girl seems blessed with the most wonderful disposition.
Your cousin Dai-yu was so different - quick to criticize others and take offence herself.
It was hardly surprising that she died so young, poor child. As for Feng, she’s seen
something of life, she should know better than to let little trials and tribulations get
her down. It’s a weakness in her character... Yes, I shall set aside a special sum of
money for Chai’s birthday, and we’ll make a jolly little party of it and let her enjoy
herself properly for once.’
   ‘That does sound a good idea, Grandmother,’ replied Xiang-yun. ‘I’ll go ahead then
and invite all the girls, and we can have a real reunion!’
   ‘Yes, you go ahead,’ said Grandmother Jia. In her enthusiasm she called Faithful
over and said:
   ‘Take a hundred taels of silver and tell accounts that we want food and drink for a
two-day party, starting tomorrow.’
   Faithful gave the money to an old serving-woman to take out to the accounts
office. The remainder of that evening and night passed without any further event.
   The next day a servant was sent to fetch Ying-chun for the party. Aunt Xue and
Bao-qin were invited, and were asked to bring Caltrop with them. Mrs Li was also
invited, and later that day she arrived together with Li Wen and Li Qi.
   These preparations were kept secret from Bao-chai. One of Grand?mother Jia’s
maids simply came to tell her that her mother had called, and to invite her over to
the old lady’s apartment. Bao-chai was pleased to hear of her mother’s arrival, and
went dressed as she was to greet her. She found her cousin Bao-qin and Caltrop there,
and Mrs Li with the Li sisters, and presumed that they had all come to call upon
hearing that the family troubles were over. She greeted Mrs Li, then Grandmother Jia,
then exchanged a few words with her mother and said hello to the Li sisters.
   ‘Now, will the ladies please be seated,’ said Xiang-yun from the side, ‘and we can
congratulate our cousin and wish her a long and happy life on this very special
occasion.’
   Bao-chai looked rather bewildered for a moment. Then she thought to herself, ‘Of
course! Tomorrow’s my birthday!’ ‘It’s quite right for you to come and visit
Grandmother,’ she protested. ‘But you certainly shouldn’t have gone to all this
trouble on my account.
   Bao-yu heard this as he came in to greet Aunt Xue and Mrs Li. He had originally
been thinking of organizing something for Bao-chai’s birthday himself, but had said
nothing to Grandmother Jia because of the general confusion of the past few weeks.
He was delighted that Xiang-yun had taken the initiative.
   ‘Yes, tomorrow’s her birthday,’ he said. ‘I was meaning to remind you, Grannie.’
   ‘Shame on you.’ cried Xiang-yun with a playful laugh. ‘As if Grannie needed you to
remind her! Who do you think invited every?one here but Grannie?’
   Bao-chai secretly doubted this. But then she heard Grandmother Jia say to her
mother:
   ‘Poor Chai - it’s been more than a year since she married Bao-yu, and somehow
with one thing after another, we’ve never celebrated her birthday. Today I wanted to
do it properly, so I invited you and Mrs Li over. I thought it would be a nice
opportunity for us all to have a chat.’
   ‘You’re only just starting to feel better, Lady Jia,’ protested Aunt Xue. ‘It is my
daughter who should be thinking how best to do her duty and show you her love and
respect. You really shouldn’t go to such lengths on young Chai’s account.’
   ‘Bao-yu is Grannie’s favourite grandson,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘so of course Grannie has
a soft spot for Chai as well! Anyway Chai deserves it!’
   Bao-chai hung her head in modest silence.
   Bao-yu meanwhile was marvelling to himself at Xiang-yun’s forthrightness:
   ‘I always imagined that Xiang-yun would change once she was married; that’s why
yesterday I was rather reserved with her. As a result I suppose she herself decided to
keep her distance. But to hear her talk now, she seems quite the same as ever. Why
has marriage made my wife more modest and bashful than before, more tongue-tied
than ever?’
   While these thoughts were passing through his mind, a junior maid came in to
announce the arrival of Ying-chun. Shortly after?wards Li Wan and Xi-feng arrived,
and they all exchanged greetings. Ying-chun referred to her father’s departure:
   ‘I wanted to come and see him before he left, but my husband wouldn’t allow me
to. He said he didn’t want his family to be infected by our bad luck. He wouldn’t
listen to anything I said, and there was nothing I could do. I cried for two or three
days.’

  ‘Why did he let you come today then?’ asked Xi-feng.
  ‘This time he said that since Uncle Zheng had been given the title, there was no
harm in renewing contact.’
  She burst into tears.
   ‘I’ve been feeling quite wretched myself,’ Grandmother Jia up?braided her, ‘and I
asked you all here to celebrate my granddaughter?-in-law’s birthday and to have a bit
of fun. I thought there’d be lots of laughter to cheer us up - and there you go
mentioning this unhappy business of yours and upsetting me all over again.’
   Ying-chun and the rest were silenced.
   Xi-feng tried her hardest to put on a brave front for the occasion and to jolly the
old lady along; but somehow she seemed to have lost the knack of making people
laugh, and her efforts all fell flat. Grand?mother Jia herself was anxious to make it a
happy occasion for Bao-?chai, and deliberately egged Xi-feng on.
   ‘You’re a lot more cheerful today, aren’t you, Grannie?’ said Xi-feng, trying her best
to oblige. ‘Here we all are gathered together again after such a long time. It’s quite a
reunion!’
   Even as she said the words, she looked around her, noticed the all too obvious
absence of Lady Xing and You-shi, and fell silent. The word ‘reunion’ had also jolted
Grandmother Jia’s memory, and she sent word at once to invite the missing ladies.
Lady Xing, You-shi and Xi-chun knew they must obey a summons from Grandmother
Jia, even though a party was the very last thing they felt like. The mere fact that
Grandmother Jia was celebrating Bao-chai’s birthday in the midst of their misfortune
was proof enough of where her affections lay. They came into the room looking a
picture of misery. Grandmother Jia enquired after Xiu-yan, and Lady Xing concocted
an illness that had prevented her niece from attending the party. Grandmother Jia
herself knew quite well that Xiu-yan’s absence was prompted by the presence at the
party of Aunt Xue, the aunt of her husband-to-be.
   Presently wine and sweetmeats were served.
   ‘There’s no need to send any out to the men,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Today can be
ladies’ day.’
   Though Bao-yu was a married man, as Grannie’s favourite he was allowed to join in
the fun. He was placed not at a table with Xiang-?yun and Bao-qin, but on a special
chair next to Grandmother Jia. He went round with Bao-chai, pouring a cup of wine
for each of the guests on her behalf.
   ‘Sit down now both of you,’ commanded Grandmother Jia, ‘and let’s all have a
drink. Later in the evening you can do your duty to everyone. But if you start getting
all formal now and make everyone stand on ceremony, you’ll spoil my mood and take
all the fun out of the party.’
   They obeyed and sat down. Grandmother Jia turned to the others:
   ‘For goodness’ sake let’s relax a bit. We only need one or two maids each to wait
on us. Faithful, take Suncloud, Parrot, Aroma and Patience off to the back and
have a cup of wine together.’
   ‘But we still haven’t kowtowed to Mrs Bao,’ protested Faithful. ‘How can we go and
drink without having done that?’
   ‘If I say so, then you can. Now, off with you!’ ordered Grand?mother Jia. ‘We’ll
send for you later if we need you.’
   Faithful and her fellow maids obeyed.
   Grandmother Jia now pressed her guests to drink up. But she soon discovered that
they were not at all their old party-going selves.
   ‘What’s the matter with you all?’ she asked fretfully. ‘Why can’t everyone cheer up
a bit?’
   ‘We’re eating and drinking,’ replied Xiang-yun. ‘What more do you expect of us?’
   ‘When they were still children,’ said Xi-feng, ‘it was easy for them to be carefree
and happy. Now that they’re grown up, they’re too self-conscious and well mannered
to let themselves go. That’s why they seem so dull.’
   Bao-yu said confidentially to Grandmother Jia:
   ‘It’s best if we don’t say anything, Grannie. If we so much as open our mouths
we’re bound to upset someone. Why don’t you suggest a drinking game instead?’
   Grandmother Jia had inclined her head to one side to listen to him.
   ‘If it’s to be a game,’ she replied with a laugh, ‘we’ll have to call Faithful back!’
   Bao-yu needed no second bidding, but went straight out to the rear of the
apartment to find Faithful.
   ‘Grandmother wants to play a game and needs your help.’
   ‘Mr Bao, can’t we relax and drink a cup of wine in peace? Do you have to invent
ways of disturbing us?’
   ‘It’s nothing to do with me. Honestly. It’s Grandmother. She sent me to fetch you.’
   ‘Oh very well then,’ said Faithful, resigning herself to her fate. ‘You all stay here
and drink your wine. I’ll be back shortly.’
   She set off to Grandmother Jia’s apartment.
   ‘There you are!’ cried Grandmother Jia when she appeared. ‘We’re going to play a
drinking game.’
   ‘Mr Bao said you wanted me, Your Old Ladyship,’ said Faithful, ‘so I came straight
away. What kind of game were you thinking of playing?’
   ‘Well not one of those clever bookish ones, for a start. They’re too boring. And not
one of those rowdy ones either. Think of something new and entertaining for us.’
   Faithful pondered for a moment:
   ‘As Mrs Xue is one of our visitors, and seeing that she is an elderly lady and won’t
want to rack her brains too much, why don’t we just get out the dice-bowl and throw
for song-titles? The loser has to drink a cup of wine.’
   ‘That sounds a good idea,’ said Grandmother Jia. She told one of the maids to put
the dice-bowl on the table.
   ‘We’ll throw four dice,’ said Faithful. ‘If the combination has no particular name,
the thrower’s forfeit is one cup of wine. If it does have a name, the number of cups
the others have to drink will depend on the combination.’
   ‘That sounds easy enough,’ they replied. ‘We’ll follow your lead.’
   Faithful threw two dice to determine who should start. They insisted that Faithful
should drink a cup first herself, then counting from her they came to Aunt Xue, who
threw, and came up with four ones.
   ‘That has a name,’ said Faithful. “‘The Four Old Hermits of Mount Shang”. All
senior guests must drink a cup.’
   Grandmother Jia, Mrs Li, Lady Xing and Lady Wang complied.
   Just as Grandmother Jia was raising her cup to her lips, Faithful said:
   ‘Since that was Mrs Xue’s throw, she must now think of a song-title to match it;
and the person next to her must cap it with a line from “The Standard Poets”. Forfeit
for failure in either case is one cup.’
   ‘This is a plot!’ cried Aunt Xue. ‘I don’t stand a chance!’
   ‘Go on,’ Grandmother Jia encouraged her. ‘Have a go. You’ll spoil the fun if you
back out. I’m next, and I’m sure to fail, so then we’ll be in the same boat.’
   Aunt Xue tried her hand:
   ‘How’s this: “Greybeard sporting in the Flowers”?’
   Grandmother Jia nodded, and recited the line:
   “‘They deem it idle mimicry of youth...
   The dice-bowl passed to Li Wen, who threw two ‘fours’ and two ‘twos’.
   ‘That has a name too,’ said Faithful. “‘Two Travellers Lost in the Tiantai Mountains
  Li Wen proposed the song-title ‘Two Scholars at Peach-blossom Spring’, and Li Wan,
who was sitting next to her, recited the line:
  “‘Searching for Peach-blossom Spring to flee the tyranny of Qin”.’
  Everyone had a drink, and the dice-bowl passed to Grandmother Jia, who threw
two ‘twos’ and two ‘threes’.
  ‘I suppose I shall have to drink a forfeit.’
  ‘No,’ said Faithful. ‘That has a name. “A Swallow over the River Guiding her Chicks”.
Everyone has to drink a cup.’
  ‘Most of your chicks have flown the nest, haven’t they, Grannie?’ quipped Xi-feng.
  They gave her a meaningful look, and she immediately fell silent.
  ‘Now what shall I say for my song?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘What about “The Sire
Leading his Grandson”?’
  Li Qi was next to her, and quoted the line:
  ‘“Lazily watching the children catch willowfloss”.’
   Everyone applauded her choice.
   Bao-yu was longing to have a go, but so far the dice-bowl had not reached him.
Now at last it was his turn. He threw a ‘two’, two ‘threes’ and a ‘one’.
   ‘What’s that?’ he asked.
   Faithful laughed.
   ‘A dud! Drink a forfeit and throw again.’
   Bao-yu did as he was told. This time he threw two ‘threes’ and two ‘fours’.
   ‘That’s better,’ said Faithful. ‘That’s “Zhang Chang Painting his Wife’s Eyebrows”.’
   Bao-yu knew she was making fun of him, and Bao-chai blushed fiercely too. Xi-feng
didn’t seem to have noticed anything out of the ordinary, and told him to hurry up
and think of a song.
   ‘Then we’ll see whose turn it is next.’
   Bao-yu was too embarrassed:
   ‘I’ll pay the forfeit. And there’s no one sitting next to me anyway.’
   The bowl came next to Li Wan. She threw, and Faithful announced the name of the
combination as ‘The Twelve Beauties’. Bao-yu hurried over to Li Wan’s side and
studied the dice: the red and green pips were symmetrically paired.
   ‘Doesn’t that look pretty!’ he exclaimed.
   Suddenly he recalled his dream, and the registers of the Twelve Beauties of Jinling.
He wandered back to his seat in a daze.
   ‘In my dream they were twelve,’ he mused. ‘But of my fair cousins, most have been
scattered to the four winds. Why have so few been spared?’
   He gazed around him. Xiang-yan and Bao-chai were present that day, it was true;
but the absence of Dai-yu struck him with a sudden and overwhelming force and he
knew that he was about to burst into tears. Not wanting the others to witness his
distress, he pretended to feel hot, and expressed a desire to go and change. He
begged leave to ‘hand in his tally’ and left the party.
   Xiang-yun noted his departure, and thought he was probably peeved by the fact
that he had not had a good throw and had been outshone by the others. She herself
began to feel rather bored and irritated by the game.
   ‘I can’t think of anything,’ said Li Wan, who had thrown the ‘Twelve Beauties’. ‘We
are missing one of the party now anyway. I’d better just drink my forfeit and be done
with it.’
   ‘This game is not turning out to be much fun,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Why don’t
we call it a day? Let Faithful have one last throw.’
   A junior maid placed the bowl in front of Faithful, who did as Grandmother Jia told
her and threw the dice. She had two ‘twos’ and a ‘five’. As the last dice continued to
rattle in the dice-bowl, Faithful cried out:
   ‘Pray I don’t get another “five”!’
   Finally it came to rest; there it was, five pips as plain as could be.
   ‘Oh dear!’ exclaimed Faithful. ‘I’ve lost.’
   ‘Doesn’t that have a name?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
   ‘It does,’ said Faithful. ‘But I’ll never be able to think of a song to match it.’
   ‘Well, you tell us the name, and I’ll try to think of something.’
   ‘This one’s called “Waves Sweep the Floating Duckweed”.’
   ‘There’s nothing particularly hard about that,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Here’s a song
for you:       “Autumn Fish in a Den of Caltrops”.’
   Xiang-yun, who was sitting next to Faithful, proposed the line:
   ‘“The white duckweed moans, as autumn descends on the south?ern river.”‘
   ‘Very apt!’ they all exclaimed.
   ‘The game’s finished,’ announced Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s all have two more cups
of wine and then eat our dirmer.’
   She looked round and noticed that Bao-yu was still absent.
   ‘Where’s Bao-yu gone? Why isn’t he back yet?’
   ‘He went to change,’ Faithful informed her.
   ‘Who went with him?’
   Oriole came forward:
   ‘When I saw that Mr Bao was going out, I told Aroma to go with him.’
   This set the ladies’ minds at rest. They waited a little longer for him to return, and
then, since there was still no sign of him, Lady Wang sent one of the junior maids out
to look for him. The maid went to his new apartment, but the only person there was
Fivey, setting out candles.
    ‘Where’s Mr Bao gone?’ the maid asked her.
    ‘He’s over at Her Old Ladyship’s for the party,’ replied Fivey.
    ‘No he’s not. I’ve just come from there. Her Ladyship sent me to fetch him. She’d
hardly do that if he was there in the first place.’
    ‘Well, in that case, I don’t know where he is. You’d better look somewhere else.’
    The maid was obliged to return and on her way met Ripple.
    ‘Did you see where Mr Bao went?’
    ‘I’m looking for him too,’ said Ripple. ‘Her Ladyship and the others are waiting for
him so that they can start dinner. Where can he have got to? You’d better hurry back
and report to Her Old Ladyship. Don’t say we can’t find him, just say the wine didn’t
agree with him and he won’t be having any dinner. Say he’ll be over when he’s had a
little lie-down. Ask Her Old Ladyship and Their Ladyships to start without him.’
    The junior maid carried Ripple’s message to Pearl, who passed it on to
Grandmother Jia.
  ‘He doesn’t usually eat much anyway,’ commented the old lady. ‘He may as well
miss out on dinner then, and have a rest. Tell him he needn’t come back at all today.
His wife is here, and that will do.’
  ‘Is that clear?’ said Pearl to the junior maid.
  ‘Yes, Miss Pearl,’ said the maid, not daring to explain what had really happened.
She went out and walked around for a bit, then returned, claiming to have conveyed
the message to Bao-yu. No one took a great deal of notice. They ate their dinner and
then sat chat?ting.

Our narrative leaves them and returns to Bao-yu. Overwhelmed by a sudden sense of
grief, he had quit the party and was wandering aimlessly outside. Aroma hurried
after him and asked what the matter was.
   ‘Nothing really,’ he replied. ‘I just feel very miserable all of a sudden. Why don’t we
go for a little stroll over to the apartment where Cousin Zhen’s wife is living, and
leave them to their drink?ing?’
   ‘But Mrs Zhen is at the party,’ said Aroma. ‘Who do you want to visit in her
apartment?’
   ‘No one,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘I just thought I might drop in on her for a second. I’d
forgotten she was at the party. I’d still like to go and see what sort of an apartment it
is that she is living in.’
   Aroma went along with him, and the two of them talked as they went. They soon
came to You-shi’s apartment, and noticed that the small side gate next to it leading
into the Garden was half-ajar. Bao?-yu did not go into You-shi’s apartment at all;
instead he went up to the two old serving-women in charge of the side gate, who
were sitting there on the threshold having a conversation, and asked them:
   ‘Is this side gate kept open?’
   ‘Not usually,’ replied one of them. ‘But today we were told that Her Old Ladyship
might be wanting some fruit from the Garden, so it’s to be kept open in case.’
   Bao-yu walked slowly up to the gate and, having confirmed for himself that it was
open, made as if to go in; but Aroma held him back anxiously.
   ‘You mustn’t go in there. The Garden is haunted. It’s been empty for ages. You
might bump into something nasty like the others did!’
   Bao-yu was tipsy enough to feel a little daring, and replied:
   ‘I’m not afraid of such things!’
   Aroma tugged at him with all her might and wouldn’t let go. The serving-woman
came up:
   ‘Nowadays the Garden is ever so quiet and peaceful. Since the priests came and
drove away the evil spirits, we often go in on our own to pick flowers and fruit. If Mr
Bao wants to have a look, we’ll go in with him. With so many of us, there’s surely
nothing to be afraid of.’
   Bao-yu was delighted; and Aroma was obliged to abandon her attempts to
dissuade him, and followed them in herself.
   As Bao-yu entered the Garden, a scene of utter desolation greeted his eyes
whichever way he turned. The flowers and trees seemed every one to be wilting, to
be more dead than alive, and the paint had long since started to peel from the walls
of many of the buildings. In the distance he espied a thicket of bamboo, an isolated
patch of brilliant green foliage.
   Bao-yu contemplated the view for a moment.
   ‘Ever since I fell ill and left the Garden,’ he said, ‘I’ve been living at Grannie’s. It
must be months since I’ve been here. What a wil?derness it has become in that time!
But look over there at that single clump of green bamboo that’s doing so well - surely
that’s the Naiad’s House?’
   ‘You’ve been away too long,’ said Aroma. ‘You’ve lost your sense of direction.
While we’ve been talking we’ve already walked past Green Delights. And look-’ (she
turned back and pointed) - there’s the Naiad’s House, over there!’
   Bao-yu’s eyes followed the direction of her pointing hand.
   ‘If we’ve already passed it, then let’s go back and have a look.’
   ‘It’s getting rather late now,’ said Aroma. ‘Her Old Ladyship will be waiting for you
to start dinner. We’d better go back to the party.’
   Bao-yu said nothing. He walked on, along the route he imagined he had trodden so
many times in the past, and began making his way towards his ‘Naiad’s House’.
Percipient Reader, it will no doubt have surprised you to hear that Bao-yu had lost his
way in the Garden after an absence of less than a year. The truth of the matter is that
Bao-yu was quite correct in his orientation; it was Aroma who, anticipating his
reaction to the sight of the Naiad’s House, had at first deliberately kept him occupied
with conversation, and then when she saw him walking instinctively in that direction
despite her efforts - heading, as she feared, straight into the arms of evil spirits- had
tried to convince him that they had already walked past the place. Bao-yu’s heart was
fixed, however; his compass was firmly set, and he was not to be so easily diverted.
   He pressed ahead, and reluctantly Aroma followed. Suddenly he stood still. He
seemed to be listening and watching.
   ‘What is it?’ asked Aroma.
   ‘Is there someone living there now?’ he asked.
   ‘I should hardly think so,’ she replied.
   ‘I could have sworn I heard someone weeping inside! There must be someone!’
   ‘You’re imagining things,’ said Aroma. ‘It’s because you always used to come here
and find Miss Lin crying.’
   Bao-yu was unconvinced and still wanted to approach and listen from a closer
distance. The old women hurried forward:
   ‘It’s getting rather late now, sir. Time to be getting back. We’re not afraid of going
anywhere else in the Garden, but just here the way is so dark and you never know...
We’ve heard tell that since Miss Lin died they’re always hearing sounds of weeping
here. No one will come near the place.’
   Bao-yu and Aroma both started when they heard this.
   ‘You see! I told you!’ cried Bao-yu, the tears springing to his eyes. ‘Oh, Cousin Lin!
Cousin Lin!’ he sobbed. ‘How could I have wounded you so! Please don’t reproach
me! Don’t feel bitter towards me! It was my father and mother who made the choice.
In my heart I was always true to you!’
   With each word he became more and mote distraught, and finally broke into a
great wail of grief. Aroma was wondering what on earth to do, when she saw Ripple
hurrying towards her with a cohort of serving-women.
   ‘Are you quite out of your mind!’ cried Ripple. ‘Bringing Mr Bao here of all places!
Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship are dreadfully worried and have sent everywhere
to look for him. Just now the women on the side gate said they’d seen the two of you
come in here. Their Ladyships had the fright of their lives when they heard! They
scolded me and told me to form a search party and come straight here. Hurry up now,
we’d better be quick!’
   Bao-yu was still sobbing pitifully, but Aroma and Ripple dragged him away, wiping
the tears from his eyes and chiding him with a description of the anxiety his
grandmother was suffering on his account. In the end he gave in and followed them
back.
   Aroma could imagine only too vividly how worried Grandmother Jia would be and
she took Bao-yu straight back to the old lady’s apartment. None of the party had
gone home; they were all there waiting for Bao-yu’s return.
   ‘Aroma!’ cried Grandmother Jia severely. ‘I thought you were a sensible girl. That’s
why I’ve always trusted you with Bao-yu. How could you take him into the Garden?
He’s only just beginning to get better, and a nasty experience might set him right
back. And then where would we be?’
   Aroma did not dare say a word in her own defence, but hung her head in shame.
Bao-chai for her part was deeply shocked to see how pale Bao-yu seemed on his
return. Bao-yu refused to watch Aroma take the blame, and spoke up on her behalf:
   ‘When we went in it was broad daylight, and there was nothing to be afraid of. I
haven’t been for a walk in the Garden for such a long time, and today I’d had a little
wine at the party and was feeling in the mood for a stroll. Why did you think I would
have a nasty experience?’
   At this last remark of his, Xi-feng, who had herself been so badly scared in the
Garden, shuddered and said:
   ‘Bao, you shouldn’t be so reckless!’
   ‘It’s not recklessness,’ countered Xiang-yun. ‘It’s devotion. He probably went there
to find the Hibiscus Fairy. Or maybe it was some other sprite…’
   Bao-yu made no reply. Lady Wang seemed too agitated to speak.
   ‘So there wasn’t anything frightening in the Garden then?’ asked Grandmother Jia.
‘Well, don’t let’s talk about it any more. But in future, if you want to go walking there,
you must at least take more people with you. If it hadn’t been for this little escapade
of yours, our guests would have left long ago. Off you go now, all of you, and have a
good night’s sleep. Come back early in the morning. Tomor?row I shall make up for
today and see that you enjoy yourselves properly. And this time we won’t let him
spoil things!’
   They all said goodbye to Grandmother Jia and the party broke up. Aunt Xue stayed
the night with Lady Wang, Xiang-yun with Grand?mother Jia, while Ying-chun went
to stay with Xi-chun. The others all returned to their respective apartments.
   When Bao-yu reached home, he was still a picture of misery. Bao-chai knew the
cause of his endless sighing, and deliberately turned a deaf ear to it. She was
concerned however that if he continued like this he might fall into a serious
depression and revert to his old idiocy. Going into the inner room she called Aroma
aside and ques?tioned her in detail about Bao-yu’s excursion in the Garden. To learn
of Aroma’s response, you must read the next chapter.

CHAPTER 109

Fivey shares a vigil, and receives
affection meant for another
Ying-chun pays her debt to fate, and returns
to the Realm of Primordial Truth




Bao-chai, having extracted from Aroma a detailed account of what had happened in
the Garden, feared that a fresh bout of grief might indeed cause Bao-yu to fall ill
again. In an attempt to avert this she deliberately alluded to Dai-yu’s dying moments,
in the course of an apparently casual conversation with Aroma.
   ‘Human beings have certain feelings towards each other while they are alive,’ she
went on to say. ‘But after death a person enters a separate realm and becomes a
different entity. Someone still alive may continue to be infatuated, but the dead
person, the object of that feeling, will be quite oblivious of it. Besides, if Miss Lin has
become a fairy, she must take a very dim view of lesser mortals and would hardly
deign to mingle with them on this earthly plane. To start imagining such things is to
invite trouble and to lay oneself open to possession by evil spirits.’
   She was talking to Aroma, but her words were clearly intended for Bao-yu’s ears.
Aroma realized this and replied in an appropriate vein:
   ‘Of course she’s not a fairy. It’s out of the question. If Miss Lin’s spirit were
haunting the Garden, why has she never once appeared to me in a dream? She and I
were good friends, after all. .
   Bao-yu was listening from outside, and considered this idea of Aroma’s carefully:
   ‘It is strange! Since I first learned of Cousin Lin’s death, I’ve thought of her
constantly, every day. But why have I never once seen her in my dreams? It must be
because she’s in Heaven, and thinks me a dull earthling incapable of communicating
on her exalted level. I know what I’ll do: tonight I’ll sleep here in the outer room.
Perhaps since I’ve just returned from the Garden she will be more aware of my
feelings, and will condescend to visit me this once in a dream. If she does, I must be
sure to ask her where she has gone, so that I can make offerings to her regularly. If on
the other hand it turns out that she is too pure for even a single dream-visit, then I
must try to put her out of my mind once and for all.’
   Having made this resolution, he said aloud:
  ‘I shall sleep out here tonight. You needn’t be bothered on my account.’
  Bao-chai did not try to oppose him directly, but cautioned him:
  ‘Don’t go having any foolish ideas. Didn’t you see how worried Mother was when
she heard that you’d been in the Garden? She could hardly speak for anxiety! You
must be sensible and look after yourself. If you go and do something silly again and
Grandmother finds out, it’s us she’ll blame for not taking proper care of you.’
  ‘I wasn’t being serious,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’d just like to sit here for a while and then
come in. You must be tired too. Go to sleep, don’t wait up for me.’
  Bao-chai thought he would probably come in later, and said with an air of affected
nonchalance: Very well then. I’m going to sleep. Aroma can look after you.’
  This was exactly what Bao-yu had been hoping for. He waited until Bao-chai had
gone to bed and then told Aroma and Musk to lay out his bedding. He sent one or
the other of them in at frequent intervals to see if ‘Mrs Bao was asleep yet or not’.
Bao-chai pretended to be asleep, although in fact she was wide awake and remained
so the entire night. Bao-yu was quite taken in, and said to Aroma:
   ‘You and Musk can both go and sleep now. I’m not upset any more. If you don’t
believe me, stay here with me until I fall asleep and then go in. But I don’t want to be
disturbed later on in the night.’
   Aroma stayed for a while, saw him into bed and made him some tea. Then she
closed the door and retired to the inner room, where after finishing a few odd jobs,
she lay down. She too only feigned sleep, and lay awake, ready to jump up if Bao-yu
needed her outside.
   Bao-yu dismissed the two serving-women on night-watch; and when he was alone
he sat up very quietly, said a silent prayer and then lay down again. At first sleep
eluded him, but gradually his mind grew more peaceful and eventually he nodded off
and slept soundly the whole night through. When he awoke it was already broad
daylight. He rubbed his eyes, sat up in bed and reflected. He had had a dreamless
sleep. Nothing whatsoever had occurred. He sighed.
   ‘As the poet once said,’ he mused out loud:


‘Since death’s parting, slow and sad the year has been;
Even in my dreams, her soul has not been seen.’

Bao-chai, who in contrast to Bao-yu had not slept a wink all night, heard him recite
these well-known lines from Bo Ju-yi’s ‘Song of Enduring Grief’, and remarked:
  ‘What a singularly inept quotation! If Gousin Lin were alive, she’d be cross with
you again, for comparing her to Yang Gui-fei!’
  Bao-yu was embarrassed that she had overheard him. He climbed out of bed and
walked sheepishly into the inner room.
   ‘I meant to come in last night,’ he said. ‘But somehow I lay down and fell fast
asleep.’
   ‘What difference does it make to me whether you came in or not?’ said Bao-chai.
   Aroma had not slept either, and hearing the two of them talking she hurried over
at once to pour tea. At that moment a junior maid from Grandmother Jia’s arrived.
   ‘Did Mr Bao have a good night’s sleep?’ she asked. ‘If so, then will he and Mrs Bao
please call on Her Old Ladyship as soon as they have completed their toilet?’
   ‘Please inform Her Old Ladyship,’ replied Bao-chai, ‘that Mr Bao slept extremely
well and that we will both call presently.’
   The maid departed with this message.
   Bao-chai completed her toilet at once, and accompanied by Oriole and Aroma she
went first to pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Then she called politely on Lady
Wang and Xi-feng, before returning once more to Grandmother Jia’s. Her mother had
by now arrived.
    ‘How was Bao-yu last night?’ was what everyone wanted to know
    ‘He went to sleep as soon as we got home,’ Bao-chai informed them. ‘He was fine.’
    They were relieved to hear this and the conversation passed to various other
topics. Presently a junior maid came in to say that Ying-chun was going home:
    ‘Mr Sun sent someone to Lady Xing’s to complain, and Her Ladyship sent word to
Miss Xi-chun to say that Miss Ying-chun must not be detained, but should return at
once. Miss Ying-chun is at Her Ladyship’s now. She’s very upset, and is crying. She will
be coming over presently to say goodbye, ma’am.’
    Grandmother Jia was greatly distressed.
    ‘Why did fate have to bring together a sweet child like Ying and this monster Sun!
She’ll have to bear with it for the rest of her life. There’s no way out for her, poor
girl!’
    As they were speaking, Ying-chun came in, her cheeks wet with tears. The family
were still supposed to be celebrating Bao-chai’s birthday, so she did her best not to
cry as she made her farewells. Grandmother Jia knew that Ying-chun must not delay
her departure and she did not try to detain her.
    ‘You’d best be on your way,’ she said. ‘But please, however bad things are, try to
look on the bright side! He’s what he is and there is little you can do to change him.
In a few days I’ll send someone to invite you home again for another visit.’
    ‘Oh Grannie!’ sobbed Ying-chun. ‘You’ve always loved me! But it’s no good! I know
I’ll never come home again!’
    She could contain herself no longer, and tears streamed down her cheeks.
    ‘Come along now!’
   They all did what they could to cheer her up: ‘Of course you’ll come again! You
should be thankful you’re not at the other end of the world, like poor Tan. She has
almost no chance whatsoever of coming home.’
   This mention of Tan-chun only brought more tears to the eyes of Grandmother Jia
and the ladies. Once again, the fact that it was Bao-?chai’s birthday induced one of
them to try and strike a more optimistic note:
   ‘Who knows: if peace is restored on the coast, Tan’s father-in-law may be
transferred back to the capital, and then we shall be able to see her!’
   ‘Of course!’ everyone concurred.
   Ying-chun had now to contain her grief as best she could and take her leave. They
saw her out, and then returned to Grandmother Jia’s, where the party continued for
the rest of that day and into the evening. When they saw that the old lady was tired,
they all went their separate ways home.
*

Aunt Xue, after bidding farewell to Grandmother Jia, went to have a talk with
Bao-chai:
   ‘Your brother has survived this year, and if he can only receive an Imperial pardon
and have his sentence reduced, he may still be able to pay his fine and be set free.
These past few years have been so unbearably lonely and wretched for me! I’ve been
thinking, perhaps I should go ahead with your cousin Ke’s wedding after all; what do
you think?’
   ‘You’re anxious about it, aren’t you, Mama?’ replied Bao-chai. ‘Pan’s marriage
turned out so badly, and you’re worried that Ke’s will be the same. Well, my advice is
to go ahead. You know Xiu?-yan’s character, and have nothing to fear on that account.
Life is very hard for her at present. Once she’s married into our family, however poor
we are, it’s bound to be better for her than being totally depen?dent on others as
she is now.’
   ‘In that case,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘will you tell Lady Jia when you have a chance? I’ve no
one at home, and I should like her to choose a lucky day for the wedding.’
   ‘Just talk it over with Ke and choose a good day between you,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Then
you can let Grandmother and Aunt Xing know, and go ahead with the wedding. I’m
sure Aunt Xing will be only too glad to be rid of Xiu-yan.’
   ‘I heard today that Xiang-yun is going home,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Lady Jia wants
Bao-qin to stay on here with you for a few days. She will be marrying too, quite soon,
so you should take the chance of having a good chat with her.’
   ‘I will, Mama.’
  Aunt Xue remained with her daughter a little longer, and then after saying
goodbye to the others, went home.

*

Let us return to Bao-yu. When he found himself in his apartment again that evening,
he pondered his experience of the night before. There was no denying the fact that
Dai-yu had failed to appear to him in a dream. That meant one of two things: either
she had indeed already become a fairy, and was holding herself aloof from
intercourse with as coarse a being as himself; or else he was just being too impatient.
He decided to give this second alternative the benefit of the doubt, and resolved to
prolong his experiment a little.
   ‘Somehow last night,’ he said to Bao-chai, ‘when I fell asleep outside, I had a
sounder night’s sleep than I usually do in the inner room. I woke up feeling very calm
and refreshed. I’ve been thinking, I should like to try it again for another couple of
nights. But I suppose you and Aroma will object again...’
   Early that morning when she had heard him reciting the poem, Bao-chai knew it
was the memory of Dai-yu that had inspired it. She knew that this obsession of his
was something mere words would never cure, and concluded that she might as well
let him go ahead and spend the two nights outside, and thus be the agent of his own
disenchantment. Anyway, the fact of the matter was that he had slept soundly the
previous night. She had been awake herself, and knew.
   ‘What nonsense!’ she replied. ‘Why should we object? If you want to sleep there,
go ahead. Just don’t have any foolish ideas. You’ll only be laying yourself open to
possession by evil spirits.’
   Bao-yu laughed: ‘Why ever should I do that?’
   Aroma was opposed to the plan:
   ‘I think you should sleep in the inner room. It’s harder to look after you properly in
the outer room. You might catch a chill or something.’
   Before Bao-yu had time to reply, Bao-chai gave Aroma a mean?ingful look.
   ‘Oh well,’ said Aroma, taking the point, ‘at least you should have someone with
you to bring you a drink if you need one.’
   Bao-yu laughed:
   ‘Why not you?’
   Aroma was embarrassed by this. She blushed fiercely and said nothing. Bao-chai
knew that Aroma was too sensible nowadays for that sort of banter, and spoke on
her behalf:
   ‘Aroma is used to being with me now. I think she should stay here. Musk and Fivey
can look after you. Besides, Aroma has spent all day traipsing about with me, and
she’s tired. She deserves a rest.’
  Bao-yu smiled and walked out of the room.
  Bao-chai told Musk and Fivey to make up his bed in the outer room.
  ‘Sleep lightly,’ she instructed them, ‘and be ready to bring him a drink if he wants
one.’
  ‘We will, ma’am,’ they replied, and went out, to find Bao-yu sitting bolt upright on
the couch, eyes closed and palms together, like a monk in meditation. They did not
dare say a word, but stood staring at him, with a smile on their faces. Bao-chai sent
Aroma in to see if she was needed, and Aroma too found his posture highly comical.
  ‘Time to sleep,’ she whispered. ‘What do you want to start medi?tating for at this
hour of the night?’
  Bao-yu opened his eyes and looked at her.
  ‘You can all go to bed now,’ he announced. ‘I shall sit up for a little longer and then
go to sleep.’
   ‘Last night,’ said Aroma, ‘you kept Mrs Bao awake till morning. Surely you’re not
intending a repeat performance, are you?’
   Bao-yu could see that if he did not go to sleep nobody else would either, and
climbed into bed. Aroma gave Musk and Fivey a few final instructions, and then went
back to the inner room to sleep, closing the door behind her.
   Musk and Fivey sorted out their own bedding, and waited for Bao-yu to fall asleep
before going to bed themselves. But he remained obstinately wide awake. Watching
them make the beds, he found himself suddenly thinking of the time when Aroma
had been away and Skybright and Musk had been left to look after him. It was on
that occasion that Musk had gone out during the night and Skybright had tried to
play a trick on her and give her a fright. She had been too lightly dressed, and had
caught cold as a result; and it was this cold that eventually led to the illness from
which she died. His mind was now completely taken up with memories of Skybright.
Then suddenly he remembered how Xi-feng had once likened Fivey to Skybright -
‘the spitting image’ had been her words. Imperceptibly his old feelings towards
Skybright began to transfer themselves to Fivey. He lay there pretending to be asleep,
and furtively watching her. The more he watched her, the more the resemblance
struck him, and the more he felt himself aroused. All was silent in the inner room;
they must be asleep, he thought to himself. But he needed to discover if Musk was
still awake. He called her name a couple of times, and there was no reply. Fivey heard,
however:
   ‘What do you want, Mr Bao?’
   ‘I’d like to rinse my mouth.’
   Fivey could see that Musk was asleep, so she hurriedly rose from her bed,
trimmed the wick in the lamp again and took Bao-yu a cup of tea, carrying the
spittoon in her other hand. She was in too much of a hurry to change, and had
nothing but a little pink silk jacket over her pajamas. Her hair was loosely coiled on
top of her head. Looking at her, Bao-yu could almost imagine Skybright come back
from the dead. Suddenly he remembered Skybright’s dying words: ‘If I’d known in
advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently...’ He
stared at Fivey in a besotted fashion, quite oblivious of the teacup in her
outstretched hand.
   Ever since the departure of Parfumée, Fivey had given up all idea of coming to
serve at Green Delights; but then, when Xi-feng gave orders for her to be taken into
Bao-yu’s service, she was more excited about it than Bao-yu himself. To her surprise,
after her arrival the generally distinguished and dignified manner in which Bao-chai
and Aroma conducted themselves made a deep impression on her, and she found
herself coming to respect and admire them greatly, whereas Bao-yu by contrast
seemed to her to have degenerated into a complete idiot, and to be not half so
handsome as he used to be. Besides she knew that Lady Wang had dismissed some
of the maids for flirting with Bao-yu, and she therefore decided to dismiss any foolish
and romantic notions she might previously have entertained concerning him. But
now here he was, the simpleton, evidently taking a fancy to her (she knew nothing of
the process by which his feelings for Skybright had been transferred to her).
   Both her cheeks were burning. She did not dare say anything out loud, but
whispered:
   ‘Mr Bao, please go ahead and rinse your mouth!’
   He smiled and took the cup in his hand. She could not tell whether he ever did
rinse his mouth or not, as the next she knew he was giggling and asking her:
   ‘Weren’t you friends with Skybright?’
   Fivey didn’t understand what he was getting at.
   ‘Of course. We were all of us on good terms.’
   Bao-yu lowered his voice to a whisper:
   ‘When Skybright was so very ill, I went to visit her. You were there, weren’t you?’
   Fivey smiled and nodded her head.
   ‘Did you hear her say anything?’ asked Bao-yu.
   ‘No,’ replied Fivey, shaking her head.
   Bao-yu held Fivey’s hand. He seemed to be completely carried away. She blushed
fiercely and her heart missed a beat.
   ‘Mr Bao!’ she whispered. ‘Whatever’s on your mind, just go ahead and say it. But
please stop behaving like this.’
   Bao-yu let go of her hand.
   ‘“If I’d known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather
differently…” That’s what Skybright said. Surely you must have heard?’
   It seemed quite plain to Fivey what manner of ‘different behaviour’ he had in mind.
She felt she must protest:
   ‘If that’s what she said, she should have been ashamed of herself! No decent girl
would suggest a thing like that!’
   ‘Don’t you start preaching at me too!’ snapped Bao-yu irritably. ‘I was thinking
how like Skybright you looked - that’s the only reason I told you what she said. How
dare you slander her!’
   Fivey could no longer discern Bao-yu’s true intentions.
   ‘It’s late,’ she said. ‘You really should go to sleep and not sit up like this. You might
catch cold. Didn’t you hear what Mrs Bao and Aroma said just now?’
   ‘I’m not cold,’ said Bao-yu. As he said this, it suddenly struck him that Fivey was
most inadequately clad, and that she might catch a chill just as Skybright had done.
   ‘Why aren’t you wearing a proper robe?’ he asked her.
   ‘You called, and it sounded important,’ she replied. ‘I was hardly going to take time
off to dress! I would have, mind you, if I’d known you were going to keep me talking
this long.’
   Bao-yu handed Fivey the pale blue silken padded jacket that was lying on the bed,
and told her to put it on. But she refused.
   ‘You keep it - I’m not cold. And anyway, I’ve a perfectly good robe of my own.’
   She went across to her bed and put on a long robe. She listened out for a moment.
Musk was sound asleep. She crossed slowly back to Bao-yu:
   ‘I thought you were supposed to be having a quiet night?’
   Bao-yu smiled.
   ‘To tell you the truth, that was never my intention. Actually, I was hoping to meet a
fairy...
   His words strengthened her suspicions.
   ‘Who do you mean?’
   ‘I’ll tell you if you like,’ he replied. ‘But it’s a long story. You’d better come up here
and sit next to me...
   ‘But you’re all tucked up in bed!’ she protested, blushing again and smiling coyly.
‘How can I possibly sit next to you?’
   ‘Why not? One night a year or two ago, when the weather was cold and Skybright
stayed up to play a trick on Musk, I was afraid she was going to catch a chill, so I
tucked her under my quilt to keep her warm. What’s wrong with it? People shouldn’t
be so prudish.’
   Fivey thought he was merely putting ideas into her head. She did not know that he
sincerely meant every word he said. She contem?plated her dilemma. She could
hardly escape; and yet if she remained, it would be equally awkward for her to
remain standing or to sit down beside him. She gave him a little glance and her face
puckered into a smile:
   ‘Don’t say such silly things! People might hear. No wonder you have such a
reputation. How can you still need to go flirting, with two such beautiful ladies as Mrs
Bao and Aroma by your side! Don’t you ever suggest such a thing again, or I’ll report
you to Mrs Bao. And then you’ll have cause to be ashamed!’
   As she was speaking there was a sudden noise outside, which startled them both,
and shortly afterwards Bao-chai could be heard coughing in the inner room. Bao-yu
made a quick motion with his lips, and Fivey hurriedly extinguished the lamp and
stole back to bed. In fact, earlier that evening, both Bao-chai and Aroma had gone
straight to sleep, exhausted after their previous sleepless night and the day’s
exertions, and both of them had slept soundly through this conversation between
Bao-yu and Fivey. It was the sudden noise in the courtyard that had woken them too.
They listened for any further sound, but all was quiet. Bao-yu meanwhile lay down in
bed again, and was thinking to himself:
   ‘That noise must surely have been Cousin Lin! She came, and then, when she
heard me talking with Fivey, she decided to give us both a fright.’
   He lay there tossing and turning, a thousand wild fancies running through his head,
and only nodded off some time after three in the morning.
   Bao-yu’s advances had left Fivey with a guilty conscience, and when Bao-chai
coughed she feared that they had both been overheard, and lay awake worrying
about it all night. Early the next morning she rose, and seeing Bao-yu still fast asleep,
began quietly tidying the room. Musk was already awake.
   ‘Why are you up so early?’ she asked Fivey. ‘Don’t tell me you’ve been awake all
night...’
This led Fivey to suspect that Musk had overheard them too. She smiled awkwardly
and said nothing. Presently Bao-chai and Aroma got up, opened the door and came
into the outer room, where they were greatly surprised to find Bao-yu still asleep. It
puzzled them that he should have slept there so soundly on two consecutive nights.
   When Bao-yu awoke and saw them all standing around him, he sat up at once and
rubbed his eyes. He thought back over the night. No, there had still been no dream.
He had met no one. He consoled himself with the words of the old saying:

Fairies and mortals tread different paths,
And ne’er the twain shall meet.

As he climbed slowly down from his bed, Fivey’s words about Bao-chai and Aroma
were still ringing in his ears: ‘two such beautiful ladies’. Yes, she was right, he thought
to himself, and proceeded to stare at Bao-chai. Bao-chai thought he was drifting into
one of his brown studies, and felt certain it must be to do with Dai-yu again, though
she still had not enquired whether his dream had been fruitful or not. She soon
began to feel uncomfortable under his penetrating gaze, and finally asked:
   ‘Well, did you meet a fairy last night or not?’
   Bao-yu concluded from this that she must have overheard his tête-à-tête with
Fivey. He gave a nervous little laugh and replied with feigned surprise:
   ‘What do you mean?’
   Fivey for her part was feeling more and more guilty and ap?prehensive, and
silently observed Bao-chai’s reaction. Bao-chai turned to her next and asked with a
smile:
   ‘Well, did Mr Bao talk in his sleep last night?’
   At this Bao-yu, muttering some incoherent excuse, walked rather sheepishly from
the room. Fivey blushed fiercely and replied as evasively as she could:
   ‘He said something or other early in the night, but I didn’t quite catch it.
Something about “knowing in advance that things would be like this”, and then
something about “behaving rather differently”. I couldn’t understand what he was
trying to say, so I just told him to go back to sleep. Then I fell asleep myself, and if he
said any more I certainly didn’t hear it.’
   Bao-chai lowered her head in thought:
   ‘Obviously something to do with Dai-yu. If I let him go on sleeping in the outer
room he’s bound to get more and more of these weird ideas into his head, and who
knows what strange apparitions and flower fairies we’ll have then. It is his weakness
for our sex that has always been his vulnerable spot. How can I win him over myself?
Until I can do that, this will never stop.’
   A fierce and somewhat unmaidenly blush came to her cheeks, and she walked
back into the inner room in something of a fluster to do her toilet.

During the two-day birthday festivities, Grandmother Jia had over-eaten, and on the
second evening she was a little off colour. The following day she had a painfully
bloated feeling in her stomach, which Faithful wanted to report to Jia Zheng. But
Grandmother Jia forbade her:
  ‘I’ve just been a bit greedy over the past couple of days. A fast will soon put me
right. Don’t you go making a fuss.’
   Consequently Faithful told no one.

*

That evening, when Bao-yu returned to his apartment and saw Bao?-chai come in
from paying her respects to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, he recalled the incident
in the morning and blushed with shame. His embarrassment was evident to Bao-chai.
For someone subject to such extremities of feeling (she thought to herself) the only
remedy lay in the manipulation of those very feelings themselves.
   ‘Will you be sleeping outside again tonight?’ she asked.
   Bao-yu did not seem keen to pursue the matter:
   ‘I really don’t mind one way or the other.’
   Bao-chai could think of no suitable retort.
   ‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ protested Aroma. ‘I don’t believe you really slept
so soundly out there...
   Fivey promptly leapt to Bao-yu’s defence:
   ‘Mr Bao had a very peaceful night, apart from talking in his sleep. I couldn’t make
head or tail of what he said, and it seemed best not to argue with him.’
   ‘I shall sleep out there tonight,’ announced Aroma, ‘and we’ll see if I talk in my
sleep. You can go ahead and move Mr Bao’s bedding back into the inner room.’
   Bao-chai made no comment. Bao-yu was too full of remorse to object, and went
along meekly with Aroma’s plan. He was eager to make it up with Bao-chai, while her
concern that too much introspection and grief would injure his health caused her to
be especially tender towards him; she was quite deliberately trying to ‘graft herself’
on to the ‘stem’ of his affections, drawing him closer to her and usurping Dai-yu’s
place in his heart. When Aroma went to sleep in the outer room that evening, Bao-yu
was in a frame of mind to exhibit his penitence, and Bao-chai naturally had no
intention of rejecting him. As a result, their marriage was that night physically
consummated for the first time, and they tasted to the full the joys of nuptial
intercourse. From this union Bao-chai conceived a child. But that belongs to a later
part of our story.

*

When Bao-chai and Bao-yu rose in the morning, Bao-yu performed his ablutions and
went ahead to call on Grandmother Jia. She had that very morning had a sudden
fancy to give something to her darling grandson and to her devoted
granddaughter-in-law, and had told Faithful to open one of her trunks and take out
an antique Han dynasty jade thumb-ring, a family heirloom of hers. She knew it could
not compare with Bao-yu’s original jade, but thought never?theless that it would
make rather an unusual pendant. Faithful found it and handed it to Grandmother Jia.
   ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen this before. How could you remember so clearly where
it was after all these years? You knew exactly which casket and which trunk. With
your instructions I was able to find it straight away. What do you want it for, ma’am?’
   ‘I wouldn’t expect you to know about this ring,’ replied Grand?mother Jia. ‘It was
originally given to my father by my great-grand?father, and then when I was married
my father sent for me and made me a present of it. He told me it was a very precious
thumb-ring made in the Han dynasty, of the variety known as “broken circle”. He
wanted me to keep it as a memento. I was very young at the time and didn’t think
much of it; I just put it away in a trunk. And when I came to live here, and saw so
many other treasures around me, it didn’t seem so very special. I’ve never even worn
it. It must have been lying in that trunk for over sixty years. I was thinking today what
a good grandson Bao-yu is to me; and since he has lost his own jade, I thought I
might give this to him, just as my father gave it to me.’
    Presently Bao-yu arrived to pay his respects.
    ‘Come here,’ said Grandmother Jia with a twinkle in her eye. ‘Come and have a
look at something.’
    Bao-yu walked over to the couch where she was lying, and Grand?mother Jia
handed him the jade thumb-ring. He took it in his hands and inspected it. It was
about three inches in circumference, slightly elliptical in shape like an elongated
melon, of a reddish hue. It was a very beautiful piece of workmanship. Bao-yu was
most taken with it and enthused at some length.
    ‘Do you like it?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘This was handed down to me from my
great-grandpa, and now I’m passing it on to you.’
    Bao-yu smiled, and dropping one knee to the ground to express his thanks, said he
would like to go and show the ring to his mother.
    ‘When she sees it she will tell your father,’ Grandmother Jia teased him, ‘and then
he will say that I love you more than I ever loved him. They have never even set eyes
on it before.’
    Bao-yu smiled and went out, leaving Bao-chai to stay for a while and chat with
Grandmother Jia before taking her leave.
    The old lady fasted for two days, but she still had a painfully bloated stomach, and
began to cough and have dizzy spells. The ladies found her in good spirits when they
paid their duty calls, but they sent a message to Jia Zheng that she was indisposed.
He came immediately, and on leaving her apartment sent at once for a doctor to take
her pulses and give a diagnosis. The doctor came presently and after a consultation
pronounced that the condition was nothing unusual for a person of Grandmother
Jia’s age. Faulty diet had caused a slight chill, which a little dispersant medication
would soon put right. He wrote out a prescription, and Jia Zheng, seeing that it
contained nothing out of the ordinary, told one of the maids to brew the ingredients
up and administer the decoction to Grandmother Jia.
   Jia Zheng visited Grandmother Jia morning and evening. After three days, when
there was still no sign of improvement, he said to Jia Lian:
   ‘You must get in touch with a better doctor and ask him to come and look at your
grandmother as soon as possible. I’m afraid none of our regular doctors is good
enough.’
   Jia Lian thought for a moment:
   ‘I remember a while ago when Bao-yu was ill, we ended up calling in a doctor who
was not strictly speaking a regular practitioner at all- and yet he was the one to put
Bao-yu right. Why don’t we send for him again?’
   ‘Medicine is certainly a subtle art” Jia Zheng mused aloud. ‘And sometimes the
ablest physicians are not recognized as such. By all means send someone to fetch this
man.’
   Jia Lian departed at once, only to return with the news that the doctor in question
had recently left town to instruct his disciples and would not be coming back for
another ten days. As the matter was urgent, Jia Lian had invited another, who was
already on his way. Jia Zheng waited anxiously for this doctor’s arrival.
   During this illness, all the ladies were in constant attendance on Grandmother Jia.
On one occasion, when there was quite a gathering of them in her apartment, one of
the old women whose duty it was to watch the side gate of the Garden came in with
a message.
   ‘Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage in the Garden has heard that Her
Old Ladyship is ill, and has come specially to call.’
   ‘She so rarely visits,’ they commented. ‘Go and invite her in at once.
   Xi-feng went over to the bedside to tell Grandmother Jia, and Xiu?-yan,
Adamantina’s old friend, went out to meet her. Adamantina was wearing the
head-covering of an unshorn nun, and a pale blue plain silk gown with a patchwork
full-length sleeveless jacket over it, bordered with black silk; she had gathered her
gown with a russet-green woven sash, beneath which she wore a long white
damask-silk skirt decorated with a pattern in grey. She drifted in with her usual
otherworldly air, holding a fly whisk and fingering a rosary, and followed by one of
her attendants. Xiu-yan greeted her:
   ‘When I lived in the Garden too, I could come and see you often; but recently the
Garden’s become so deserted, and it’s been difficult for me to go in there on my own.
And anyway the side gate is usually closed. That’s why I haven’t been able to visit you
for so long. How lovely it is to see you again!’
   ‘You and the others were always too caught up in the hustle and bustle of life,’
replied Adamatina. ‘That’s why even when you lived in the Garden I didn’t visit very
often. But I’ve heard of the recent troubles, and learned that Her Old Ladyship has
fallen ill; I’ve been thinking of you and I wanted to see Bao-chai. What difference
does it make to me if the gates are closed or not? I chose to come, and I came; if I
hadn’t chosen to come, it would have made no difference how much anybody
wanted me to.’
   Xiu-yan laughed.
   ‘You haven’t changed a bit, have you!’
   By now they had entered Grandmother Jia’s room. The ladies all welcomed
Adamantina, and she went up to the bedside, enquired after the old lady’s health
and chatted with her for a while.
   ‘You’re a religious person,’ said the old lady. ‘Tell me: am I going to get better or
not?’
   ‘A person as charitable and virtuous as yourself, Lady Jia, will surely live to a ripe
old age,’ replied Adamantina. ‘You’ve just caught a slight chill, and I’m sure a few
doses of medicine will put it right. At your age the important thing is to relax and not
worry so much.’
   ‘But you know I’m not the worrying type,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve always been
one for my bit of fun. There’s not much the matter with me, I just feel a little
uncomfortable and have this bloated feeling in my stomach. The last doctor I saw
said it was because I was letting myself get too overwrought. But you know perfectly
well that no one dares to rub me up the wrong way! I don’t think that doctor really
knew what he was talking about. I told Lian the first doctor was right - I’ve just got an
upset stomach and a cold. Lian should send for him again tomorrow.’
   She called Faithful over:
   ‘Tell the kitchen to prepare some vegetables so that Sister Ada?mantina can have
something to eat while she’s here.’
   ‘I’ve already eaten,’ said Adamantina. ‘I won’t have anything now.’
   ‘Even if you are not going to eat,’ said Lady Wang, ‘stay and chat with us a little.’
   ‘Very well. It’s so long since I’ve been here. I wanted to see how you all were
anyway.’
   She talked with them a little longer, and then said she must be going. As she
looked around she caught sight of Xi-chun.
   ‘Why are you looking so thin, Xi?’ she asked. ‘You mustn’t wear yourself out so
with your painting.’
   ‘I haven’t painted for ages,’ said Xi-chun. ‘The room I’m living in now is not so light.
And besides I don’t feel like painting nowadays.’
   ‘Where are you living now?’ asked Adamantina.
   ‘In a room to the east of the gate you’ve just come through,’ replied Xi-chun. ‘It’s
very close, if you ever feel like dropping in.’
   ‘One day I will,’ replied Adamantina. ‘When I’m feeling in the right frame of mind.’
   Xi-chun and the others saw her out, chatting as they went. By the time they
returned, the maids informed them that the doctor was closeted with Grandmother
Jia, and they all left and went their separate ways.
   Contrary to everyone’s cheerful prognostications, Grandmother Jia gradually
deteriorated. None of the treatment she received had any beneficial effect, and she
started suffering from diarrhoea. Jia Zheng realized that her condition was becoming
critical, and grew extremely concerned. He sent a messenger to the Board to say that
he would be taking leave and staying at home, and he and Lady Wang waited on the
old lady day and night, personally preparing and administering her medicines. One
day they had just watched her eat and drink a little and were feeling slightly more
optimistic, when they saw an old serving-woman poke her head round the door. Lady
Wang sent Suncloud Out to see who it was, and she discovered it to be one of the
women Ying-chun had taken with her on her marriage.
   ‘What have you come for?’ she asked.
   ‘I’ve been waiting an age!’ replied the old woman. ‘I couldn’t find a maid anywhere
and I didn’t want to come barging in. I’ve been worried silly!’
   ‘What’s the trouble?’ asked Suncloud. ‘Don’t tell me Mr Sun has been bullying our
Miss Ying again!’
   ‘She’s past hope!’ said the old woman. ‘He had one of his fits the day before
yesterday, and she was crying all that night, and then yesterday she had a bad attack
and could hardly breathe. They wouldn’t send for a doctor, and today she’s even
worse!’
   ‘Her Old Ladyship’s ill herself!’ said Suncloud. ‘For goodness’ sake don’t go making
a lot of noise!’
   Lady Wang had heard this conversation from inside, and afraid that Grandmother
Jia would react badly to this latest turn of events, she ordered Suncloud to take the
serving-woman away and talk to her somewhere else. But Grandmother Jia still had
her wits sufficiently about her to overhear and understand a great part of the
conversation.
   ‘Is Ying dying?’ she cried.
   ‘Certainly not,’ protested Lady Wang. ‘These women lose all sense of proportion.
She’s just been a little poorly these past few days and they were concerned for her
and came here to ask for a doctor.’
  ‘They’d better have mine,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell him to go and see her at
once.’
  Grandmother Jia began to grow very distressed.
  ‘Of my three granddaughters,’ she said, ‘the eldest spent her share of good fortune
and died; Tan, my third, is married and has gone to live at the other end of the world,
and I shall never see her again; and now Ying - I knew life was hard for her, but
somehow I thought she would live to see better days. Now she’s going to die, and
she’s so dreadfully young! And I shall be left here, a useless old woman with no
reason to be alive!’
  Lady Wang and Faithful did what they could to console her. Bao?chai and Li Wan
were not present that day, and Xi-feng had been too ill to attend for several days.
Lady Wang was afraid that Grandmother Jia’s illness would be aggravated by all this
mental distress, and she sent at once for the other ladies, while she returned to her
own apartment and called Suncloud to her.
   ‘That stupid old serving-woman!’ she grumbled. ‘In future when I’m with Her Old
Ladyship, you’re not to disturb me, no matter what the trouble is!’
   Suncloud promised to obey this injunction, and said no more. The old woman
meanwhile had just reached Lady Xing’s when the news arrived that Ying-chun had
died. Lady Xing burst into tears. In Jia She’s absence she had to send Jia Lian to the
Suns to represent the family. Grandmother Jia was so ill that no one dared break the
news to her.
   Alas! What a cruel end for such a gentle creature, her flowerlike beauty crushed
within a year of marriage!
   None of the Jias could leave home with Grandmother Jia as she was, and the Suns
gave Ying-chun a predictably makeshift funeral.
   Grandmother Jia continued to deteriorate steadily, but still her only thought was
for her granddaughters and great-nieces. On one occasion Xiang-yun was in the
forefront of her mind, and she sent a maid to see how she was. The maid returned
and tiptoed in to find Faithful. Faithful was at the bedside, as were Lady Wang and
the other ladies; and the maid, not wishing to disturb them, went round to the back
to find Amber.
   ‘Her Old Ladyship sent me to fetch news of Miss Xiang-yun,’ she told Amber, ‘and I
found her crying her heart out! Her husband has suddenly been taken ill, and the
doctors say there’s no hope for him. At the best it will turn into a consumption and
he may last another four or five years! You can imagine how badly Miss Xiang-yun
has taken it! She’s already heard about Her Old Ladyship’s illness, but now she simply
can’t leave home. She told me not to mention her husband’s illness to Her Old
Ladyship. If she does ask after Miss Xiang-yun, you must think of some way to explain
her absence.’
   Amber heaved a deep sigh, and after a long silence dismissed the maid. She too
thought it unwise to inform Grandmother Jia, and went to her bedside with the
intention of telling Faithful to invent some story. She found Grandmother Jia deathly
pale, and everyone in the room whispering among themselves:
   ‘You can see she’s going!’
   Amber did not dare utter a word. Jia Zheng discreetly called Jia Lian over to
whisper something in his ear, and Jia Lian tiptoed off to do his bidding. Outside he
assembled the remaining household staff.
   ‘Her Old Ladyship will soon be gone. You must make sure that everything is in
order. First fetch out the coffin-boards for inspection, and measure them up for a
lining. Go round all the apartments, take everyone’s measurements, and give the
tailor a complete list, with instructions to make everyone a set of mourning clothes.
Arrange for the funeral awning to be constructed in the courtyard and for
coffin-bearers to be hired. And have extra staff put on duty in the kitchen.’
   ‘Mr Lian,’ replied Lai Da, on behalf of the others. ‘You don’t need to worry about
these things. We have already thought of everything. But where is the money coming
from?’
   ‘We won’t need to borrow,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Her Old Ladyship has made provision
herself. The Master told me just now that he wants no expense spared. It must be
done in style; we must put on a good show.’
   ‘Yes, sir.’
   Lai Da and the others went about their business at once, and Jia Lian returned to
his own apartment.
   ‘How is Mrs Lian?’ he asked Patience.
   Patience shot her mouth out towards the inner room:
   ‘Go and see for yourself.’
   Jia Lian went in. Xi-feng was struggling to dress herself, but was too weak to do so.
She had collapsed on the kang, and was leaning on the little kang-table.
   ‘It’s no good hoping to snatch some rest now!’ exclaimed Jia Lian. ‘Grandmother is
sinking fast and you must be there. Hurry up and tell them to tidy things up in here.
And pull yourself together! If the worst happens, we won’t be able to get away for
quite a while.’
   ‘We’ve got nothing left to tidy up!’ said Xi-feng bitterly. ‘Only a few odds and ends,
nothing worth bothering about. You go on ahead, Sir Zheng may want you. I’ll come
as soon as I’m properly dressed.’
   Jia Lian returned to Grandmother Jia’s apartment and reported discreetly to Jia
Zheng that all had been seen to and the various duties assigned. Jia Zheng nodded.
The Imperial Physician was an?nounced, and Jia Lian went out to receive him.
Grandmother Jia’s pulses were taken and then the physician emerged to inform Jia
Lian in hushed tones:
   ‘Lady Jia’s pulse-rate is very poor. You must be prepared for the worst.’
   Jia Lian understood and passed the message on to Lady Wang and the others. Lady
Wang beckoned Faithful with a meaningful glance and told her to prepare
Grandmother Jia’s funeral clothes. Faithful went to fetch them.
   The old lady opened her eyes and asked for a drink of tea. Lady Xing brought her a
cup of ginseng tea, and she put her lips to it.
   ‘Not this!’ she protested. ‘Give me a proper cup of tea!’
   They dared not deny her this request, and promptly brought her a cup of real tea.
She took one gulp, and then another, and then announced that she wanted to sit up.
   ‘Mother,’ pleaded Jia Zheng on behalf of the others, ‘whatever you want, you have
only to tell us; but please don’t exhaust yourself by trying to sit up.’
   ‘I’ve had a drink and I feel a bit better now,’ she replied. ‘I’d like to sit up and chat
for a bit.’
   Pearl and the other maids gently supported her with their hands. She seemed
momentarily revived. Whether she was to live or die will be told in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 110

Lady Jia ends her days, and returns
to the land of shades
Wang Xi-feng exhausts her strength, and
forfeits the family’s esteem




Grandmother Jia sat up in bed and began to speak:
   ‘I have been part of the Jia family for over sixty years. I have had a long life and
enjoyed my full share of happiness. I think I can say that all my children and
grandchildren from Zheng downwards have turned out well. As for Bao-yu: I have
loved him so dearly and…’
   Her eyes searched the room for Bao-yu, and Lady Wang pushed him towards the
bed. Grandmother Jia extended one hand from beneath the bedcovers and took hold
of him:
  ‘My boy, you must promise to do your very best for the family!’
  ‘Yes, Grandma,’ choked Bao-yu, his eyes brimming with tears. He struggled to
contain his weeping and stood listening to her, as she continued:
  ‘I want to see one of my great-grandchildren, and then I think I can set my heart at
rest. Where’s my little Lan?’
  Li Wan pushed Lan forwards. Grandmother Jia let go of Bao-yu and took Lan by the
hand.
  ‘You must be a good boy and always do your duty to your mother. And when
you’re grown up, you must win her honour and glory! Now, where’s Fengie?’
  Xi-feng was standing by the side of the bed and hurried round to face
Grandmother Jia.
  ‘Here I am, Grandma.’
  ‘My child,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘your trouble is that you’re too clever! Try to be
more charitable in future and to make your peace with fate, I know I’m not much of a
one to talk; the most I’ve done in my life is try to be honest and to bear my
misfortunes with patience. I’ve never been the sort for fasting or prayer. The only
good work I ever did was to have those copies of the Diamond Sutra made a year or
so ago. I wonder if they’ve all been distributed yet?’
  Xi-feng informed her that the copies had not yet been distributed.
  ‘The sooner that act of devotion is completed the better,’ said the old lady. ‘I know
my elder son She and Cousin Zhen are detained in exile, and cannot be here: but how
could that little devil Xiang-yun be so heartless? Why has she not come to see me?’

   Faithful and her fellow maids knew the reason only too well, but said nothing.
   Grandmother Jia looked next at Bao-chai. As she did so, she sighed and a flush
began to spread across her face. Jia Zheng knew this to be a sign of imminent death.
He came forward with the ginseng broth, but Grandmother Jia’s teeth were already
tightly clenched. She closed her eyes, then opened them once more and gazed round
the entire room. Lady Wang and Bao-chai came forward and supported her gently,
while Lady Xing and Xi-feng dressed her. The old serving-woman prepared the bed
where she was to be laid out, and arranged the coverlet. There was a faint rattle in
her throat, a smile stole across her face, and she was gone. She was eighty-two years
old. The serving-women hurried forward to lay her on the bed.
   Jia Zheng and the other menfolk knelt in the outer room, Lady Xing and the
womenfolk knelt by the bed; from both rose the first chorus of lamentation. The
servants outside had all made their preparations, and as soon as word came from the
inner quarters, every gateway was thrown open, from the main entrance to the inner
gate leading to the ladies’ apartments, and white paper was pasted on every door.
The funeral awning was raised over the courtyard, and a memorial archway erected
outside the main entrance. Every member of the household immediately put on their
mourning clothes.
   Jia Zheng reported his bereavement and the commencement of his three-year
period of mourning to the Board of Rites, who submitted a memorial requesting the
Emperor’s instructions in the matter. His Majesty, being a person of the profoundest
compassion and kind?liness, in consideration of the services rendered and
distinctions obtained by previous generations of the family, and especially in view of
the relationship of the deceased to the Imperial Jia Concubine, authorized a bounty
of one thousand taels of silver and instructed officers from the Board of Rites to
make offerings and do reverence before her coffin. Jia household servants were
despatched to notify all relatives and family friends of Lady Jia’s death, and they all
came to condole; for while they knew that the Jias had come down in the world, they
also saw that the family continued to enjoy the Emperor’s favour. An auspicious day
was chosen for the encoffinment and subsequent lying-in-state.
   Since Jia She was away from home, Jia Zheng was acting head of the family. Two of
Grandmother Jia’s grandsons, Bao-yu and Jia Huan, and her great-grandson Jia Lan,
all of whom were too young to take part in the reception, mourned by the coffin. Her
other grandson, Jia Lian, was busy organizing the servants, with the help of Jia Rong
and various male and female relatives. Ladies Xing and Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng and
Bao-chai were supposed to be chief mourners and therefore in constant attendance
on the coffin. Strictly speaking, one of the other ladies had to be chosen to
orchestrate the reception. There were three immediate possibilities: there was
You-shi, who ever since Cousin Zhen’s departure and her installation in Rong-guo
House as a dependant had kept very much in the back?ground, and was anyway
unfamiliar with the workings of this side of the family; there was Jia Rong’s new wife,
who was even less con?fident of her abilities in this respect; and there was Xi-chun,
who was still too young, and though she had grown up with the Rong-guo branch
had remained totally ignorant of family practicalities. None of these was really a
plausible candidate.
   The Only person for the job was Xi-feng. With Jia Lian in charge of the ‘outside’, it
would make good sense for her to run the ‘inside’ and look after the lady guests. She
had always had great confidence in herself in the past and had assumed that
Grandmother Jia’s funeral would be the culmination of her career, an opportunity for
her to prove how indispensable she was. Ladies Xing and Wang re?membered how
well she had coped with Qin Ke-qing’s funeral, and thought they could rely on her to
repeat her success. When therefore they absolved her from her duties as a mourner
and asked her to take over full responsibility as manageress once more, she could
hardly refuse.
  ‘After all,’ she thought to herself, ‘I’ve always been in charge here. The servants are
used to taking orders from me. It was Lady Xing’s servants and You-shi’s who were
hard to handle before, and they’ve all gone. It will be less convenient settling bills
without tallies, but I shall have cash available from Grandmother’s fund, so there
should be no problem. It will help having Lian in charge of his side of the reception,
too. Even though I’m not well, I think I should be able to get by without discrediting
mysel￡ It’s bound to be easier than Qin Ke-qing’s funeral.’
   She waited until the morning after the Third Day, during which ceremonies were
held welcoming back the spirit of the deceased. Then she told Zhou Rui’s wife to
summon a general assembly of the staff and to bring the registers. When she
scrutinized them, she found that altogether there were only twenty-one men,
nineteen serving-women, and a dozen or so maids. It would not be enough.
   ‘Why, we have fewer servants for Lady Jia’s funeral than we had for Qin Ke-qing’s!’
she thought to herself with dismay. Even after calling in extra hands from the country
estates, there would still be a serious shortage.
   She was turning this problem over in her mind when one of the junior maids came
in:
   ‘Miss Faithful would like you to go over and see her, Mrs Lian.’
   Somewhat reluctantly Xi-feng went over to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where
she found Faithful in floods of tears. The moment she saw Xi-feng, she clutched hold
of her and cried:
   ‘Please be seated, Mrs Lian, and let me kowtow to you! I know one shouldn’t do
such things during a period of mourning, but I really must!’
   Faithful fell to her knees, and Xi-feng held out her hands to prevent her.
   ‘Come on! What’s the meaning of all this? If you’ve something on your mind, then
just go ahead and say it!’
   Faithful insisted on kneeling, and Xi-feng continued her attempts to pull her to her
feet.
   ‘Her Old Ladyship’s funeral has been placed entirely in your hands and Mr Lian’s,’
sobbed Faithful. ‘Her Old Ladyship left a special sum of money to pay for it. While she
was alive, Her Old Ladyship never wasted a penny on herself; now that the time has
come for her funeral, I beg you, ma’am, to do the right thing by her and give her a
proper send-off! Just now I heard the Master talking about it “The Book of Songs
this”, and “Confucius that” - I didn’t understand a word of what he said. I caught one
sentence, though: “In funerals, sincere grief is of more importance than outward
show.” I asked Mrs Bao to explain what he meant, and she said that the Master wants
to keep the funeral a simple affair. He believes that heart-felt grief is the truest form
of devotion, and that there is no need for extravagant display. But as I see it, for
someone like Her Old Ladyship, things ought to be a bit grand. I know I’m only a
servant, and have no right to speak in these matters, but I feel that Her Old Ladyship
loved us both during her lifetime, ma’am, both you and me, and now that she’s dead
we owe it to her to send her off with a bit of style! I know how good you are at that
sort of thing, ma’am, and I wanted to ask for your support, so that we could decide
together what’s best. I’ve been with Her Old Ladyship all my life, and death cannot
part us! If I don’t see this done properly, how am I ever to look her in the face again?’
   Xi-feng found Faithful’s way of talking rather odd.
   ‘Don’t you worry,’ she replied. ‘Of course everything will be done in proper style.
Sir Zheng may talk of economy, but we have certain standards to maintain. We’ll
spend every penny of the money on Lady Jia, if need be.’
   ‘Before she died,’ said Faithful, ‘Her Old Ladyship said that everything left over
after the family distribution had been made was to be given to us. If there’s not
enough money for the funeral expenses, ma’am, then take our share of Her Old
Ladyship’s be?longings and pawn them. Whatever the Master may say, he can hardly
go against Her Old Ladyship’s last wishes. He was here himself when she divided
everything up.’
   ‘You’ve always been such a sensible girl,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What’s got into you today?’
   ‘Nothing’s got into me,’ protested Faithful. ‘I just know that Lady Xing doesn’t care,
and that the Master is being too cautious. It may be that you are of the same mind as
the Master, ma’am. If you’re afraid too, and think that a proper funeral will get us
into trouble, then no one will dare to give Her Old Ladyship her due. That would be
the most terrible thing! I’m only a maid, so of course it’s no personal concern of mine.
But think what a disgrace it would be for the family!’
   ‘I hardly need reminding of that,’ replied Xi-feng. ‘Set your mind at rest. I shall take
care of everything.’
   Faithful once more entreated Xi-feng to do her utmost, and pledged her undying
gratitude.
   ‘What a strange creature!’ thought Xi-feng to herself, as she left Grandmother Jia’s
apartment. ‘I wonder what can be in her mind? Of course she’s right: Grannie’s
funeral should be stylish. Oh dear! I can’t pay too much attention to Faithful’s
complaints. I’d better just stick to the book and follow family precedent.’
   She summoned Brightie’s wife, and sent her with a message to Jia Lian, asking him
to come and see her.
   ‘What do you want me for?’ he asked, when he arrived shortly afterwards. ‘Just
keep your end up on the “inside”. There should be no problems. If you’re in any
doubt, stick to Uncle Zheng’s in?structions.
   ‘There you are,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What you say only bears out Faithful’s fears.’
   ‘What fears are they?’
   Xi-feng repeated the substance of her interview with Faithful.
   ‘Who cares what the maids say?’ retorted Jia Lian. ‘I’ve just been in to see Uncle
Zheng, and this is what he said: “We’d like to lay on something grand for Mother’s
funeral, but although some people will understand that it’s her money we’re using,
less well-informed observers may suspect us of secretly holding on to some of our
own resources. They may think we still possess hidden wealth. Of course,” Uncle
Zheng went on to say to me, “if we don’t spend all of Grand?mother’s money on the
funeral, no one will want to appropriate what’s left for their own personal use. In one
way or another it should still be spent on Grandmother. Now she was a Southerner,
and though we have ancestral burial-land in the South, there are no buildings on it.
When her coffin has been transported to the South, with any money that’s left over
we can put up some buildings on the ancestral burial-ground, and buy a few hectares
of land to provide for the sacrifices. If we ever return to the South ourselves, it will
come in handy, and even if we don’t, we can always let some of the poorer clan
members live on it. They can keep up the seasonal offerings and sweep the graves at
regular intervals.” That was Uncle Zheng’s proposal. Don’t you think it a sound one?
You’re surely not suggesting that we spend the entire amount on the funeral, are
you?’
   ‘Has any of the money been issued yet?’ asked Xi-feng.
   ‘Not a penny of it,’ replied Jia Lian. ‘I heard that when Mother learned of this
proposal of Uncle Zheng’s, she sang its praises and did her utmost to encourage both
him and Aunt Wang in their efforts to economize. So what can I do? I already have
several hundred taels owing for the awning and the pall-bearers’ fees, but the cash
still hasn’t been issued. If I go and ask for it, they’ll all tell me the money’s there but
that I must get the work finished first and reckon up afterwards. There’s no one we
can borrow from: the servants with any money of their own have all disappeared.
When I called a roll, some were “absent sick”, others were “in the country”, while the
ones still here have stayed on only out of sheer necessity and are no use to us.
They’re interested only in making a profit for themselves.’
   Xi-feng was lost in thought for a moment.
   ‘How are we going to manage, then?’ she said finally.
   As she was speaking a maid came into the room:
   ‘There’s a message for you from Lady Xing, ma’am. Today is the third day of the
ladies’ reception, and the arrangements are still topsy-turvy. The guests should not
have to be kept waiting for their food, after the funeral offering has been made! They
had to ask for their meal several times before they were served. And even when the
main dishes arrived, there was still no rice. Surely we can do better than that!’
   Xi-feng hurried in to give the servants orders to serve lunch, and they managed to
produce something passable. Unfortunately there was an unusually large crowd of
guests that day and the staff were at their most sullen and apathetic. Xi-feng had to
supervise them herself, then she hurried out and told Brightie’s wife to call a general
meeting of all the serving-women. She gave each one clear instructions, to which
they replied with a surly, ‘Yes, Mrs Lian,’ and proceeded to do nothing during the
afternoon.
   ‘Look how late it is! Why haven’t you served the evening offering and meal yet?’
demanded Xi-feng.
   ‘Serving the food would be no problem, ma’am,’ came the reply, ‘if we had the
necessary utensils ..’
   ‘Fools!’ exclaimed Xi-feng. ‘This is your job! Of course you’ll get whatever you
need!’
   The servants reluctantly applied themselves to their ‘impossible’ tasks, while
Xi-feng went straight to the main apartment to seek Ladies Xing and Wang’s
permission for the necessary utensils. But there was still such a throng of guests
around them that it was impossible for her to get a word in. Evening was drawing on,
and in despair she went to see Faithful and asked her for the use of Grand?mother
Jia’s spare dinner service.
   ‘Why come asking me for it?’ exclaimed Faithful. ‘Mr Lian pawned it a couple of
years ago! You’d better ask him if he ever redeemed it.’
   ‘I don’t want the silver or gold,’ said Xi-feng. ‘The regular service will do.’
   ‘What do you suppose Lady Xing and Mrs You have been using since they moved
in?’ asked Faithful pointedly.
   Xi-feng knew she must be telling the truth, and left at once for Lady Wang’s
apartment, where she managed to talk Silver and Suncloud into lending her a service,
had a quick inventory made by Sunshine, and told him to hand the things over to the
servants.
   Faithful saw Xi-feng in this state of disarray, and although she did not call her back
to complain, she thought to herself:
   ‘Why is Mrs Lian, who used to be so capable, bungling things so badly this time?
The past couple of days have been a disgrace. It’s poor gratitude for Her Old
Ladyship’s love!’
   She was not aware that Lady Xing was deliberately starving Xi-?feng of funds. Jia
Zheng’s views on economy coincided neatly with Lady Xing’s own anxieties about the
future, and she saw every tael saved on the funeral as a contribution not only to the
family’s reserves, but also to her own financial security. Her position in this was
strengthened by the fact that strictly speaking it was Grand?mother Jia’s eldest son
who should have been in charge of the funeral. Jia She was not at home, but Jia
Zheng was an incorrigible stickler for convention, and whenever consulted would
reply: ‘Ask Lady Xing what she thinks.’ Lady Xing considered Xi-feng extrava?gant and
Jia Lian untrustworthy, and consequently held tightly on to every penny of the
funeral funds. Faithful however took it for granted that the money for the funeral had
already been issued, and ascribing the present crisis to a lack of zeal and loyalty on
Xi-feng’s part, she redoubled her wailing before the coffin of her dead mistress.
   Lady Xing and Lady Wang knew only too well what Faithful was complaining about,
but so far from acknowledging that the cause lay in their own refusal to equip Xi-feng
properly for her task, they began criticizing Xi-feng out loud:
   ‘Faithful is right: Feng is letting us down badly...’
   In the evening, Lady Wang summoned Xi-feng and rebuked her:
   ‘We may be living in somewhat straitened circumstances, but we must maintain
our standards none the less. During the past two or three days I’ve noticed that the
maids have not been looking after our guests properly. Clearly you have failed to give
them adequate instructions. Please will you make more of an effort and show a little
more family spirit.’
   Xi-feng was speechless. She would have brought up the fact that she had not been
issued with any money, but money was supposed to be Jia Lian’s province, whereas
Lady Wang was complaining about the ‘inside’ service. She dared not answer back.
   ‘Strictly speaking,’ said Lady Xing, who was standing to one side, ‘your Aunt Wang
and I, as Lady Jia’s daughters-in-law, should be taking care of the reception, not a
member of the junior generation; but we’re very tied up with the mourning, and that
is why we delegated the responsibility to you. You mustn’t think you can be slack.’
   Xi-feng blushed fiercely. She was about to say something in her own defence when
she heard a drum begin outside: it was time for the dusk offering of paper money. A
wail rose from the assembled mourners and her chance to speak had gone. She
thought she would wait till later, but after the offering Lady Wang urged her to hurry
about her duties.
   ‘We can take care of things here. You go and see to it that everything is in order for
tomorrow.’
   Xi-feng did not dare utter a word, but went out, containing her chagrin and her
tears as best she could. She called another meeting of the staff and reminded them
once more of their duties:
   ‘Ladies, dears, take pity on me I beg you! I am being blamed for everything by
Their Ladyships, and it’s all because you are not doing your jobs properly. You are
making a laughing stock of us. I beseech you to make a special effort tomorrow.’
   ‘But madam,’ came the reply, ‘this isn’t the first time you’ve been in charge. You
know us, we’d never dare disobey your orders. But this time the ladies are asking too
much. Take this last meal: some wanted to eat here, others wanted to eat in their
own rooms. We ask Lady So-and-so to come and take her meal, and then Mrs
Somebody-else doesn’t turn up ... How can we possibly cope? We beg you, ma’am, to
have a word with the maids and ask them not to be so fussy!’
   ‘Her Old Ladyship’s maids are very hard to please,’ replied Xi?-feng. ‘And it’s hard
for me to give orders to Their Ladyships’ maids. Who is there I can speak to?
   ‘But Mrs Lian! When you managed the funeral for Ning-guo House, you had people
beaten, you scolded them, you took a very strong line - and everyone obeyed you.
Are you going to let your authority be challenged now by these maids?’
   ‘On that occasion,’ sighed Xi-feng. ‘Their Ladyships were in no position to find fault
with me. But this time it’s not Ning-guo House; I‘m on home territory, and open to
public scrutiny. So everyone’s finding fault with me. Besides, I’m not getting money
when I ask for it from accounts. If something is needed at the reception, and I send
out for it and nothing happens, what can I do?’
   ‘But Mr Lian’s in charge of that side of things. Surely he’ll give you whatever
money you need?’
   ‘That’s what you think!’ replied Xi-feng. ‘His hands are just as tied as mine. He has
no control over the money. He has to ask for every penny himself. He’s got no cash at
all.’
   ‘But isn’t Her Old Ladyship’s money his to use?’
   ‘Ask the stewards,’ said Xi-feng. ‘They’ll tell you.’
   ‘No wonder the menservants outside are complaining! They keep saying what a
big job it is, what hard work, and that there’s no chance of making anything on the
side. How can things possibly run smoothly when there’s no money?’
   ‘Enough talking,’ said Xi-feng. ‘All of you concentrate on your jobs and do them as
best you can. If I hear any more complaints from Their Ladyships, I’ll be after you.’
   ‘We’ll do whatever you tell us to do, ma’am, we’ll not say a word. But with all their
different ideas, it will be hard to satisfy every one of the ladies.’
   Xi-feng implored them:
   ‘My dears! Help me out tomorrow, please! Give me a chance to talk things over
properly with the maids, and we’ll discuss the matter again.’
   The servants went about their business.
   Xi-feng felt bitterly wronged, and the more she thought about the situation she
was placed in, the more pent-up she became.
   At first light, after a sleepless night, she had to report once more for duty to Ladies
Xing and Wang. She would have liked to discipline the maids, but was afraid of
arousing Lady Xing’s resentment; she would have liked to confide in Lady Wang, but
Lady Xing had already set Lady Wang against her. The maids, seeing that Their
Ladyships were not supporting Xi-feng, started to make life harder for her than ever.
The only exception was Patience, who stood loyally by Xi-feng.
   ‘Mrs Lian would like to do things properly,’ she explained to the others, in an
attempt to win them over. ‘But Sir Zheng and Their Ladyships have given orders for
strict economy to he observed, and there’s nothing she can do about it.’
   Buddhist sutras were read, Taoist masses were celebrated, there was an endless
stream of ritual lamentations and sacrifices to the spirit of the departed; but
somehow, in the prevailing climate of retrenchment, the mourners did not fully
throw themselves into things, and the ritual had a rather perfunctory air about it.
Each day saw the arrival of princely consorts and ladies of high rank, none of whom
Xi-feng could receive in person as she was too busy trying to keep things going
below-decks. She had no sooner mobilized one servant, when another was found to
be missing; she lost her temper, she begged; she muddled through one session, and
then had to cope with a fresh set of problems. By now Faithful was not the only one
to see that things were awry. Even Xi-feng herself knew, to her great mortification,
that the funeral reception was a shambles.
   Though Lady Xing was wife of the elder son of the deceased, she was able to justify
her own indifference towards the practical arrange?ments with the handy text: ‘Grief
is the Essence of Devotion.’ Lady Wang followed suit, as did all the other ladies of the
family - with the single exception of Li Wan. She saw the difficulties Xi-feng was
having, and though she did not dare speak up on her behalf, she sighed to herself
and thought:
   ‘There’s a popular saying: “The Peony owes much of its beauty to its leaves.”
Mother and Aunt Xing have always relied on Xi-feng; but how can she help them,
when the servants no longer obey her? If Tan were at home, she could help. But as
things are, even Xi-feng’s own servants are running round in circles and muttering
behind her back, complaining that there’s no profit in it for them and that they’re
just making fools of themselves. Father is a great believer in filial piety; but he
doesn’t understand the practicalities. In something big like a funeral, you have to
spend money if you want things done properly. Poor Feng! After all these years, who
would have thought she would come to grief over Grandmother’s funeral!’
   When an opportunity presented itself, Li Wan spoke to her own servants:
   ‘Now don’t you go treating Mrs Lian disrespectfully just because everyone else is.
Don’t imagine it’s enough for a funeral if people dress in mourning and keep the
wake. Don’t think a few days of muddling through like that will suffice. If you see the
others in difficulties, you must lend a hand. This is a family concern. Everyone should
do their best to help.’
   Li Wan’s trusted servants replied:
   ‘You are quite right, ma’am. We wouldn’t dream of going against Mrs Lian. But
Faithful and the others seemed to be blaming her...’
   ‘I’ve already spoken to Faithful,’ said Li Wan. ‘I’ve told her that it’s not Mrs Lian’s
fault, Mrs Lian is doing all she can to give Her Old Ladyship a proper funeral. But she
isn’t getting the money. How can the cleverest daughter-in-law in the world make
congee without rice? Faithful knows the truth now, and she doesn’t hold Mrs Lian to
blame any longer. Mind you, Faithful’s behaving quite strangely, I must say, she’s not
at all her usual self. While Her Old Ladyship was still alive to love and protect her, she
never put on airs, but now that Her Old Ladyship is dead and her support is gone, she
seems to be acting in a most peculiar fashion. I felt sorry for her before. She should
thank her lucky stars that Sir She is away from home, and that she’s escaped that fate.
If he were here, her future really would look grim.’
   As she was speaking, Jia Lian came in.
   ‘It’s time you went to bed, Mama,’ he said. ‘The guests have been coming and
going all day, and you must be worn out. It’s time you had a rest. I haven’t looked at
my books at all these past few days. Today Grandmother said I can sleep at home. I’m
so pleased, as it means I shall be able to do some work. Otherwise, by the time the
mourning period is over, I shall have forgotten everything.’
   ‘You’re such a good boy!’ said his mother. ‘Of course you’re right to study. But
today you should rest too. Wait until the procession’s over, then you can get down to
your books again.’
   ‘If you’re going to sleep,’ replied Jia Lian, ‘I’ll go to bed too, and do some revision in
bed.’
   The servants were loud in his praises:
   ‘What a wonderful boy! So young, but so keen to make the most of the slightest
opportunity to study! Not like his uncle. Mr Bao may be a married man, but he’s still
as childish as ever. To see him these last few days, kneeling down in there with Sir
Zheng- so awkward and wretched, itching for Sir Zheng to get up so that he could
dash off to find Mrs Bao and start whispering to her about goodness knows what.
Mrs Bao wouldn’t pay him any attention so he went and pestered Miss Bao-qin, and
she avoided him, and Miss Xiu-yan wouldn’t talk to him either, and in the end Miss
Xi-luan and Miss Si-?jie were the only ones who would. They hung on his every word.
It seems Mr Bao still has only one interest in life: fooling about with the young ladies.
There’s not a shred of gratitude in him for the way Her Old Ladyship loved him all
those years. He’s not a patch on Master Lian! You certainly have no cause to worry
for the future, Mrs Zhu!’
   ‘He may be a good boy,’ commented Li Wan, ‘but he’s still so young. By the time
he’s grown up, who knows what will have become of the family? Tell me, how has
young Master Huan been behaving?’
   ‘Oh, he’s a regular disgrace!’ replied one of the servants. ‘A right little rascal,
forever poking his nose into other people’s affairs and sneaking around the place.
Even when he is supposed to be mourn?ing, the moment one of the young ladies
arrives, he starts peeping out from behind the screens.’
   ‘Huan’s getting quite grown up now,’ said Li Wan. ‘The other day I heard something
about his being engaged. But it had to be put off because of the funeral. Now, no
more gossiping: in such a big family as ours, with so much going on, we’ll never be
able to set everything to rights. There was one other thing I wanted to ask you. Have
carriages been arranged for the funeral procession the day after tomorrow?’
   ‘Mrs Lian has been so busy these past few days,’ came the reply. ‘She’s been in a
terrible state. So far as we know, she hasn’t given any instructions about carriages yet.
Yesterday we heard one of the men saying that Mr Lian has put Mr Qiang in charge of
that. Apparently we haven’t enough carriages or drivers ourselves, and they’re
planning to borrow from relations.’
   Li Wan smiled sadly:
   ‘Are they sure our relations will agree to lend?’
   ‘You must be joking, ma’am! Of course they’d lend us their car?riages. The trouble
is, they may all be using their own for the funeral, so it looks as if we may have to
end up hiring all the same.’
   ‘We can hire carriages for the servants. But will we be able to find decent white
funeral carriages for Their Ladyships?’ said Li Wan.
   ‘Lady Xing and both Mrs You and Mrs Rong from Ning-guo House are all without
carriages of their own. How are they going to come if we don’t hire?’
   Li Wan sighed.
   ‘I remember the day when we thought it a joke to see one of our relatives riding in
a hired carriage! Now they’ll be laughing at us. Tomorrow you must tell your menfolk
to make sure our carriages and horses are prepared well in advance. We don’t want
any last-minute panics.’
   ‘Yes, ma’am.’
   Li Wan’s servants went about their business.

*

Our story now turns to Shi Xiang-yun. Earlier, because of her hus?band’s illness, she
had only been able to come once to mourn for Grandmother Jia. She calculated now
that there were two days left before the funeral procession was due to set off; and
since her hus?band’s condition had been positively diagnosed as a consumption, and
he was therefore in no immediate danger, she decided she must call once more. She
came on the day before the final wake. She recalled all Grandmother Jia’s love for her,
and then her thoughts turned to her own fate, to have married such a fine husband,
a man of such grace and talent, of such a gentle disposition, only to watch him being
taken from her slowly and inexorably by an illness whose roots must surely lie in
some previous lifetime. She wept with renewed grief for most of that night, despite
the persistent efforts of Faithful and the other maids to console her.
   Bao-yu was unbearably distressed by the sight of Xiang-yun’s weeping, but could
hardly go to comfort her in the midst of the ceremonial lamentations. The plain
mourning-clothes she was wear?ing and the absence of any make-up seemed to
make her even prettier than before her marriage. He looked round at Bao-qin and
the other girls; they too were plainly dressed, with a minimum of ornamenta?tion.
The very simplicity lent a charm and grace to their appearance. His eyes rested on
Bao-chai: how well mourning-clothes became her! She looked even more attractive
than in her everyday attire.
   ‘The men of old,’ mused Bao-yu to himself, ‘used to say that of all flowers none
could rival the splendour of plum-blossom, not for its early blooming but for the
incomparable purity of its whiteness, the unsurpassable freshness and delicacy of its
scent. If only Cousin Lin were here now, and dressed in a simple mourning gown, how
ex?quisitely beautiful she would look!’
   He felt a pang of grief, tears rolled down his cheeks, and he began sobbing loudly
and unrestrainedly. It was a funeral after all, and no one would think such behaviour
out of place. The ladies were already busy rallying Xiang-yun when suddenly they
heard another familiar voice break out wailing on the outside of the screen. They
surmised that both cousins were overwhelmed by memories of Grandmother Jia’s
past love and kindness, and little guessed that Xiang-yun and Bao-yu each had private
cause for grief. Their heart-felt lamentations soon brought tears to everyone’s eyes,
and it fell to Aunt Xue and old Mrs Li to offer comfort and counsel moderation.
   The following day was the wake proper, and therefore busier than ever. Xi-feng
was utterly exhausted, but there was nothing for it, she had to struggle on and
muddle her way through the morning, even though she had by now lost her voice. By
the afternoon, when the number of guests reached its peak and demands were being
made on her from all quarters, she had reached breaking point and was search?ing in
desperation for some second wind when a young maid came running in:
   ‘Here you are, ma’am! No wonder Lady Xing is so cross! “So many guests,” she said.
“I can’t possibly take care of them. Where is Mrs Lian? Hiding somewhere with her
feet up, I’ll be bound!”’
   This unmerited rebuke provoked a sudden surge of indignation within Xi-feng. She
struggled to control herself, but tears started to her eyes, and all went black before
her. A sickly taste rose into her mouth and she began to vomit up quantities of bright
red blood. The strength ebbed from her legs and she sank to the ground. Luckily
Patience was at hand and hurried over to support her mistress as she crouched there,
blood gushing from her mouth in an un?staunchable stream.
   To learn if she survived this crisis or not, you must turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 111

A devoted maid renders a final service, and accompanies
her mistress to the Great Void
A villainous slave takes his revenge, and betrays
his masters into the hands of thieves




Patience hurried forward, and with the help of another maid she raised Xi-feng from
the ground and gently escorted her to her room. There she laid her down with great
care on the kang and told Crimson to bring a cup of hot water and hold it to her lips.
Xi-feng drank a sip of the water and then sank into a heavy sleep. Autumn came
briefly into the room, glanced at her lying there, and walked out again. Patience did
not ask her to stay, but turned instead to Felicity who was standing at her side and
said: ‘Go and tell Their Ladyships at once.’
   Felicity informed Ladies Xing and Wang that Xi-feng had vomited blood and would
be unable to continue with her duties. Lady Xing suspected Xi-feng of malingering,
but refrained from expressing her suspicions in front of her female relatives.
   ‘Tell Mrs Lian to go and lie down then,’ she said.
   No one made any further comment. That evening an endless stream of family and
friends came to call, and only thanks to the help of a few close relations could a
semblance of normality be maintained. Xi-feng’s absence was the cue for many of
the staff to give up working altogether, and little now stood between Rong-guo
House and total chaos.
   At ten o’clock in the evening, when those guests who lived a long way off had
departed, the family began to prepare for the wake, and a chorus of lamentation rose
from the womenfolk gathered within the funeral screen. Faithful wept herself into a
faint, and had to be propped up and given a vigorous pummelling. When she came
round, all she could say was: ‘Her Old Ladyship was always so good to me! I want to
go with her!’
  Her words were not taken seriously, but were considered a natural, if rather
hyperbolic, expression of her grief. Later, when the time came for the wake proper,
and over a hundred family and servants were gathered together for the ritual,
Faithful was nowhere to be seen, and in the general flurry of activity no one
bothered to check where she was. The turn came for Amber and Grandmother Jia’s
other maids to lament and make their offering, and they would have looked for
Faithful then to join them, but thought she had probably worn herself out with
weeping and gone to lie down somewhere, and decided to let her be.
  When the ritual was over, Jia Zheng told Jia Lian to ensure that all was ready for
the funeral cortege, and discussed with him who was to look after the house in the
family’s absence.
  ‘I’ve told Yun to stay at home and take charge,’ said Jia Lian. ‘And Steward Lin and
his family will stay behind as well and supervise the dismantling of the awning. I still
don’t know which of the ladies should be left in charge of the inner apartments.’
   ‘I heard your mother say that Xi-feng was ill and wouldn’t be going,’ replied Jia
Zheng. ‘So she will be staying at home anyway. And Cousin Zhen’s wife suggested
that, as she is so seriously ill, Xi-?feng should have Xi-chun and a few maids and
serving-women to keep her company. Between them they can keep an eye on
Grand-mother’s apartments.’
   Jia Lian had his reservations about this proposal.
   ‘You-shi doesn’t like Xi-chun,’ he thought to himself, ‘and is deliberately preventing
her from going on the procession. But Xi?-chun can’t take charge on her own. And
Xi-feng is too sick to be of any help.’
   ‘You should go and rest now, Uncle,’ he said to Jia Zheng. ‘I’ll report back to you
when I’ve had a word with Mother.’
   Jia Zheng nodded, and Jia Lian went in to Lady Xing’s apart?ment.
   Earlier in the evening, Faithful had wandered off on her own, brooding tearfully to
herself:
   ‘All my life I’ve lived with Her Old Ladyship, and now that she’s dead I’ve nowhere
to turn. Sir She is not at home, that’s something to be thankful for, but I don’t like the
way Lady Xing is behaving. Sir Zheng will never intervene on my behalf, and one way
or another the future looks very bleak. The young masters will all be trying to get
their way. We shall each of us be dealt with as they think fit, some kept for their beds,
some married to their page-boys... Well, I for one won’t stand for it! I’d rather die!
But how? That’s the question …’
   She had made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s inner room. From the threshold
she detected a faint form in the dim lamplight within, a lady with a sash in her hand,
poised as if in the very act of hanging herself from a beam. Faithful was not in the
least frightened.
   ‘Who can this be?’ she asked herself. ‘Someone bent on the same course as myself,
but with greater resolve ...’
   ‘Who are you?’ she said aloud. ‘We seem to have the same thought! Let us die
together!’
   There was no reply. Faithful walked a little closer and could see now that it was not
one of the maids from Grandmother Jia’s apart?ment. She looked more carefully. A
chill breeze blew past her, and the lady’s form vanished into thin air. Faithful stood
there for a moment longer in a daze, then walked back into the outer room and sat
down on the edge of the kang, lost in thought. Suddenly she exclaimed:
   ‘Of course! That’s who it was! Mr Rong’s first wife, from Ning-?guo House. But she
died long ago. What was she doing here? I suppose she must have come to fetch me.
But why was she going through the motions of hanging herself?’
   After a few moments’ thought:
   ‘That’s it! She was showing me how!’
   With this realization, the evil had entered the very marrow of her being, and her
resolve was formed at last. She rose to her feet as if in a trance and went to her toilet
box, opening it and weeping all the while. She took out the lock of hair that she had
once cut from her head, and slipped it inside the bosom of her dress. She untied the
sash from around her waist and looped one end of it over the beam where Qin
Ke-qing had just stood. Then she gave herself up to one last fit of weeping. Hearing
the guests leave in the distance, and fearing that someone might come in and
surprise her before the deed was done, she quickly pulled the door to and fetched a
footstool. Standing on the stool, she tied a slip-knot in the sash, put her head
through the knot and kicked the stool away. Alas! The last breath was soon strangled
from her throat, and her gentle soul fled its mortal frame.
   The wandering soul was still uncertain whither to proceed when it saw once more
the faint form of Qin Ke-qing standing before it. ‘Mrs Rong!’ it cried, advancing
urgently towards the apparition. ‘Wait for me!’
   ‘I am not Mrs Rong,’ came the reply. ‘I am Disenchantment’s younger sister,
Ke-qing.’
   ‘But you’re most definitely Mrs Rong,’ protested Faithful. ‘How can you deny it?’
   ‘Listen,’ replied the other. ‘I will tell you the true story of all this, and then you will
surely understand. I once occupied the highest seat in Disenchantment’s Tribunal of
Love. My responsibility was the settlement of Debts of Passion. I went down into the
human world, where naturally I was destined to become the world’s foremost lover,
my mission being to draw lovesick lads and lovelorn maidens with all speed back to
the tribunal and the settlement of their debts. As part of this mission it was my
Karma to hang myself. I have now seen through the illusion of mortal attachment,
and have risen above the Sea of Passion to return to the Paradise of Love. This leaves
a vacancy in the Land of Illusion, in the Department of Fond In?fatuation. You have
been chosen by Disenchantment to take my place, and I have been sent to guide you
there.’
  ‘But I am a most unpassionate person!’ protested Faithful. ‘How can I be
considered a lover?’
  ‘You don’t understand,’ replied the other. ‘Earthlings treat lust and love as one and
the same thing. By this means they practise all manner of lechery and immorality,
and pass it off as “harmless romance”. They do not understand the true meaning of
the word “love”. Before the emotions of pleasure, anger, grief and joy stir within the
human breast, there exists the “natural state” of love; the stirring of these emotions
causes passion. Our kind of love, yours and mine, is the former, natural state. It is like
a bud. Once open, it ceases to be true love.’
   Faithful’s soul signalled understanding with a nod, and followed Qin Ke-qing.
   When the wake was over, Ladies Xing and Wang began giving instructions to those
of the servants who were staying behind to look after the house, and Amber went in
search of Faithful to ask her whether their carriages had been hired for the next day.
She looked in vain in the outer room of Grandmother Jia’s apartment, and then she
noticed that the door to the inner room was on the latch, and putting her eye to the
crack peered through into the half-lit interior. A flickering lamp filled the room with
eerie shadows. No sound could be heard from inside and she retraced her steps,
saying to herself:
   ‘Where can the wretched girl have disappeared to?’
   On her way out she bumped into Pearl.
   ‘Have you seen Faithful?’ she asked.
   ‘No,’ replied Pearl. ‘I’ve been looking myself. Their Ladyships want to speak to her.
Most probably she’s fallen asleep in the inner room.’
   ‘I’ve just had a look - she didn’t seem to be there,’ said Amber. ‘The lamp needs
trimming, and it’s awfully dark and spooky inside. I didn’t actually go inside. Shall we
go in together and look properly?’
   The two maids entered the room. First they trimmed the lamp.
   ‘Who put this footstool here?’ exclaimed Pearl. ‘I nearly tripped over it.’
   As she spoke she looked upwards and let out a horrified cry.
   ‘Aiyo!’ She fell back and collided with Amber, who looked up in turn, screamed and
stood rooted to the spot. Their cries were soon heard, and other maids came running
into the room. There were more shrieks of horror, and word was sent at once to
Ladies Xing and Wang.
   When Lady Wang and Bao-chai heard the news, they both burst into tears and set
off to Grandmother Jia’s apartment to see for themselves.
   ‘I never thought Faithful had it in her to do this!’ exclaimed Lady Xing. ‘Send
someone at once to inform Sir Zheng.’
   Bao-yu stood dumbfounded, an expression of glazed horror in his eyes. Aroma and
his other maids rallied him:
   ‘Cry if you must, but don’t bottle it up like this!’
   Finally he managed to emit a piercing wail.
   ‘What a rare girl Faithful was to choose such a death!’ he had been thinking to
himself. ‘The purest essence of the universe is truly concentrated in her sex! She has
found a fitting and noble death. We, Grandmother’s own grandchildren, are
despicable by comparison. We have shown ourselves less devoted than her maid.’
   He found something strangely comforting in this thought, and by the time
Bao-chai had come to his side to soothe his tears, he was smiling again.
   ‘Oh dear!’ cried Aroma. ‘Mr Bao’s going mad again!’
   ‘It’s nothing to worry about,’ Bao-chai reassured her. ‘No doubt he has his reasons.’
   Bao-yu was pleased to hear Bao-chai say this.
   ‘Perhaps she really does understand me,’ he thought to himself. ‘If so, she is the
only one.’
   He was drifting off into some other fantastic reverie when Jia Zheng arrived.
   ‘Faithful is a commendable child!’ exclaimed Jia Zheng with a sincere sigh of
admiration. ‘Lady Jia’s love for her was not in vain!’
   He turned to Jia Lian:
   ‘Send someone to buy her a coffin, and lay her in it this very night. Tomorrow her
remains can be conveyed together with Mother’s, and her coffin can lie in state
behind that of her mistress. In this way her noble act can be carried to a fitting
conclusion.’
   Jia Lian went out to execute these instructions, and gave orders for Faithful’s body
to be let down and laid out in Grandmother Jia’s inner room.
   When Patience heard the news of Faithful’s suicide, she came with Oriole and a
whole crowd of other maids and they all wept bitterly before Faithful’s body. The
occasion caused Nightingale to think of her own future and the precariousness of her
present situation, and she regretted that she herself had not chosen Faithful’s path
and followed Dai-yu to the grave. By so doing she would at least have fulfilled her
duty as a maid and died a noble death. In Bao-yu’s apartment she was doing little
more than marking time. Although he was very considerate and affectionate towards
her, she knew that nothing would ever come of it. All these thoughts added a note of
personal grief to her lamentations.
   Lady Wang sent at once for Faithful’s sister-in-law. She told her to supervise the
encoffinment, and after consulting with Lady Xing, issued her an allowance of one
hundred taels (from Grandmother Jia’s fund). She also promised to sort out all
Faithful’s private effects and give them to her as soon as she had time. The
sister-in-law kowtowed, and so far from exhibiting any signs of grief, seemed rather
pleased.
   ‘What wonderful courage Faithful showed!’ she exclaimed. ‘And what a lucky girl
she is, to have won such glory, and such a splendid funeral into the bargain!’
   One of the serving-women nearby rebuked her:
   ‘That’s quite enough from you! A hundred taels is a poor bargain for your own
sister-in-law’s life! Think how much more profit you’d have made out of her if you’d
only managed to flog her earlier on to Sir She! Then you’d have had something to
crow about!’
   The words struck home, and Faithful’s sister-in-law departed blushing. At the inner
gate she met Steward Lin with a team of men carrying in the coffin and returned with
them, helping them lay Faithful’s corpse in the coffin, and herself putting on a show
of mourning.
   Since Faithful had died in the best Confucian tradition, ‘Out of devotion to her
mistress’, Jia Zheng sent for incense and himself lit three joss-sticks before her coffin.
   ‘For her loyalty and devotion,’ he said, having made a solemn bow, ‘she deserves
to be elevated above the rank of a mere maid. The younger generation must pay
homage to her.’
   Bao-yu’s delight knew no bounds. He came forward and with almost exaggerated
reverence performed a series of full-blown kowtows. Jia Lian also recalled Faithful’s
past kindnesses to him, and would have followed suit, but Lady Xing restrained him:
   ‘One of the masters is quite enough. Too much of this might ruin her chances of
being born again...’
   Jia Lian desisted. But Bao-chai felt uneasy at Lady Xing’s words. ‘Strictly speaking, I
shouldn’t kowtow to her,’ she said. ‘But this is a special case. We are all of us too
bound by our commitments to the living to give in to any extreme display of grief. But
Faithful has acted for us. She has given the fullest expression to our devotion, and
now we should ask her to continue serving Grandmother in the next world on our
behalf. That would at least be a small token of our love!’
   She walked forward on Oriole’s arm and poured a libation of wine before Faithful’s
coffin, the tears streaming in profusion down her cheeks. When the libation was
completed, she kowtowed several times in succession and sobbed emotionally. Some
of the assembled company commented wryly that now Bao-yu and his wife were
both demented; others protested that their conduct evinced a sincere grief; while
some restricted themselves to observing that they had at least manifested a sense of
what was right and proper. Jia Zheng, for his part, was pleased with them.
   He had by now settled the caretaking arrangements, and it was agreed that Xi-feng
and Xi-chun would stay behind, while all the other ladies would take part in the
procession. No one slept a great deal that night.
   At four in the morning, the cortege could be heard gathering outside, and by seven
it was ready to move off, with Jia Zheng at the head, in full mourning attire and
weeping profusely, as the rites demanded of a filial son. The street was lined with the
funeral booths of countless families, which need not be described in detail here. At
last they reached the Temple of the Iron Threshold and the coffins were set out,
while the menfolk in mourning prepared to spend the night at the temple.
*

At home, Steward Lin supervised the dismantling of the funeral awning, carefully
bolted the doors and put up the shutters on the windows, swept the courtyard and
appointed wardens for the night?watch, to commence their duties that evening. It
was a well-established rule at Rong-guo House that the innermost gate was closed at
ten, and after that hour entrance to the inner apartments was strictly forbidden to
males. Female domestics kept the watch inside. Xi-feng, despite a night’s rest, had
still not recovered from her attack, and although she seemed a little more composed,
she was certainly not capable of getting about. Patience and Xi-chun therefore
undertook a tour of inspection, and gave the women on night-watch their
instructions before retiring to their separate apartments.

*

Our narrative turns at this point to Zhou Rui’s foster-son, He San --who, it may be
remembered, had been flogged and expelled from Rong-guo House by Cousin Zhen
the previous year for fighting with his fellow-servant, Bao Er, and had since then
spent most of his time in the gambling-dens. With Grandmother Jia’s death, He San
thought there might be a possibility of reinstatement, or at least a job of some kind
in the offing for him, and he made enquiries at Rong-guo House several days in
succession. Finally it became clear that he was engaged on a futile quest, and
heaving many a disgruntled sigh he made his way back to one of his usual haunts,
and slumped into a chair. His cronies noticed his depressed air and called out to him:
  ‘San, old mate, why not have another fling? Who knows, your luck might turn.’
  ‘I’d love to!’ exclaimed He San bitterly. ‘But I haven’t a penny left to play with.’
  ‘Come off it! After all the time you’ve been away at your old Pa Zhou’s place? You
must have fixed yourself up all right! Don’t come the beggar on us!’
  ‘That’s what you think! Oh, they’ve got plenty - millions in fact -but they’re
keeping it all tucked away. They won’t spend it. They’ll hang on to it and hang on to it
and in the end it will take a fire or a thief to make them let go!’
  ‘You can’t expect us to believe they’re that rich, after what they had confiscated in
that raid?’
  ‘You don’t realize,’ replied He San. ‘It was only what they couldn’t hide that got
taken. The old lady left behind a stash of her own when she died, and they won’t part
with a penny of it. It’s all put away in her room. They’re going to decide what to do
with it after the funeral.’
  These words seemed to make a particularly strong impression on one member of
the company, who exclaimed after a few more throws of the dice:
   ‘All I ever do is lose! I’ll never break even. I’m off to bed.’
   As he walked out, he took He San to one side and muttered:
   ‘A word, old San.’
   He San followed him out.
   ‘I can’t bear watching a clever fellow like you go skint, when there’s no need...’
   ‘It’s my luck,’ muttered He San. ‘What can I do about it?’
   ‘I thought just now you said Rong-guo House was stacked with money. Why not
get some of it for yourself?’
   ‘Wait a minute,’ rejoined He San. ‘It may be stacked with money, but that doesn’t
mean they’d give us a penny of it!’
   The man laughed.
   ‘Well, if they won’t give it away, why don’t we just help ourselves...’
   He San began to catch his drift.
   ‘And just how do you propose to do that?’ he asked.
   ‘Oh show some guts, man! Don’t be so feeble!’ was the reply. ‘I’d have got my
fingers on it long ago.’
   ‘What sort of “guts” have you got then?’
   The man’s voice dropped to a whisper:
   ‘If you want to make a lot of money out of this, all you have to do is show us the
way in - I’ve got some friends in this line of business, first-class operators. They’re just
the ones for this job. And it so happens the Jias are all away at this funeral, and
there’s only a few women left at home. Mind you, a whole garrison of men wouldn’t
scare my friends ... But maybe you’re scared?’
   ‘Me!’ objected He San hotly. ‘I’m not scared! Do you think I’m worried about old
Zhou? Why, I only let him be my foster-dad because his missus asked me to. He’s
nothing. But it all sounds a bit dodgy to me. Could land us in a lot of trouble. The Jias
have got connections with every yamen. Supposing we do manage to get the stuff
out, it’ll be hard to get rid of it.’
   ‘This time you’re in luck, old friend,’ said the other. ‘Some of my seafaring mates
happen to be in the area at this very moment, waiting for a job like this to crop up.
Once we’ve got our hands on the money, you and I would be wasting our time in
these parts. We’d be far better off going to sea with my mates and spending our
fortune there! Good idea, eh? Of course, if you can’t bear the thought of parting
from your old foster-mum, we’ll just have to lug her along too. One big happy family,
eh!’
   ‘You’re drunk!’ exclaimed He San. ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about. The
whole idea’s a crazy one.’
  None the less, he took the man aside into an out-of-the-way alley, and the two of
them stood there talking a while longer before going their separate ways. Our story
must leave them for the time being.

*

We must return to Rong-guo House and to Bao Yong, the former Zhen family retainer
now living with the Jias, who after a dressing-down from Jia Zheng had been
demoted to caretaking duties in the Garden. In the general bustle of Grandmother
Jia’s funeral, no one thought of assigning him a task. He was unconcerned by this and
continued to mind his own business, cooking for himself and leading a somewhat
carefree and independent life. If he felt bored, he would take a nap, and on waking
would practise with sword and stave in the Garden. On the day of Grandmother Jia’s
funeral procession, of which he was quite aware, although he had been given no part
to play in it, he was taking a stroll in the Garden when he saw the figure of a nun
accompanied by an old matron, making their way to the side gate, where they began
knocking. He went up to them:
   ‘Where would you be going, Reverend Mother?’
   The old matron replied:
   ‘We heard that Lady Jia’s wake is over, and as we couldn’t see Miss Xi-chun in the
procession we thought she must have stayed at home. Sister thought she might be
lonely and has come to call on her.’
   ‘None of the family are at home,’ said Bao Yong. ‘I’m in charge of the Garden and I
must ask you to return to your quarters. If you want to visit, please wait until they
have come back from the procession.’
  ‘And who do you think you are, you ruffian?’ the matron protested indignantly.
‘What business is it of yours where we go?’
  ‘I don’t like your type,’ replied Bao Yong. ‘I say you can’t go, and that’s final.’
  ‘Why, this is downright mutiny!’ the old matron retorted angrily and noisily. ‘When
Lady Jia was alive they never stopped us going anywhere. What kind of an upstart are
you, to start throwing your weight around in this insolent manner? I don’t care what
you say, I will go out this way!’
  She seized the door-knocker and struck it several times with all her might.
  Adamantina was speechless with rage as she listened to this ex?change. She was
on the point of going home when the old women on the other side of the gate heard
the sound of an argument and opened up to investigate. Deducing that Adamantina
must have been offended by Bao Yong, and knowing that she was on intimate terms
with the ladies of the house, especially Miss Xi-chun, the women feared that at some
later date she might report them for not letting her through, and thereby get them
into serious trouble. They hurried after her:
   ‘We had no idea you were here, Your Reverence. Our apologies for being so slow in
opening the gate. Miss Xi-chun is at home, and would be so pleased to see you.
Please come on in. That stupid caretaker is new here. He doesn’t know anything.
We’ll report him later to Her Ladyship and she’ll have him beaten and get rid of him.’
   At first Adamantina refused to change her mind. But the old women kept on
pestering her, begged her not to get them into trouble, were on the point of falling to
their knees, until in the end she really had no choice but to turn back and follow
them into the mansion. Bao Yong, seeing how things stood, understandably made no
further attempts at obstruction but went back to his room, scowling and fuming to
himself.
   Adamantina went straight to Xi-chun’s apartment. She offered her condolences
and they chatted for a while.
   ‘I still have a few more nights to last out before the others come home,’ said
Xi-chun. ‘Xi-feng is sick, and I’m all on my own. It’s so boring and lonely - and scaring!
If only I had someone to keep me company! Now that you’ve come all this way, won’t
you stay the night? Please! We could play Go together and chat.’
   At first Adamantina was reluctant. But she felt sorry for Xi-chun, and then at the
mention of the game Go her eyes lit up and she agreed to stay, instructing the
matron to return to the Hermitage and send one of the novices with her tea things,
her clothes and her bedding. Xi-chun was delighted and for her part instructed
Land?scape to go and fetch some of the supply of the previous year’s rainwater,
which had been stored and put aside for making tea. She made a point of saying that
Adamantina would not be needing a cup, as she had her own set. The novice
presently arrived with Ada?mantina’s things, Xi-chun made the tea, and the two of
them were soon carried away in a spirited conversation that lasted until eight o’clock
in the evening, when Landscape laid out the Go-board, and they settled down to play.
Xi-chun lost the first two games, but then Adamantina gave her a handicap of four
and she managed to win the next by half a point.
   Before they knew, it was two o’clock in the morning. Outside, the night was
breathlessly still.
   ‘I must meditate at four,’ said Adamantina. ‘You go in now and rest. My own girl
can wait on me.’
   Xi-chun was reluctant to go, but complied out of respect for Adamantina’s religious
practice. She was about to go into her bed?room when suddenly she heard a great
cry coming from the women on night-watch in Grandmother Jia’s apartment, which
was soon taken up by her own serving-women:
   ‘Help! Help! Someone has broken in!’
   Xi-chun, Landscape and the other maids were scared out of their wits. Next they
heard shouting coming from the men on night-duty in the outer apartments.
   ‘Dear oh dear!’ exclaimed Adamantina. ‘There must be burglars in the house!’
   She hurriedly closed the door of the room and covered her lamp. Peeping through
a hole in the window, she could see several men standing in the courtyard outside.
Speechless at first with terror, she turned and crept quietly back into the room,
gesturing with her hands and finally saying to the others:
   ‘Heaven save us! What great burly fellows there are out there!’
   As she spoke, there was a clatter on the roof-top above her head and she heard
the night-watchmen bursting into the courtyard with cries of ‘Stop thief!’
   ‘Everything has been taken from Lady Jia’s apartment! We must find the thief!’
called one of them. ‘The others have already gone to the east wing. We’ll search the
west’
   One of Xi-chun’s old women, hearing familiar voices, called out from inside:
   ‘Some of them have climbed up on our roof!’
   ‘Look!’ cried the night-watchmen. ‘There they are! Up there!’
   A confused hubbub ensued, several tiles came hurtling down from the roof, and
none of the watchmen had the courage to climb in pursuit. They were all standing
there rather helplessly when a fresh burst of noise came from the direction of the
side gate to the Garden, followed by the sound of the gate itself being broken down,
and in stormed a great hefty fellow with a wooden club in his hand. They all tried to
hide, without any success.
   ‘We must stop them all, every one of them!’ bellowed the new arrival. ‘Follow
me!’
  They stood there paralysed with fear, while the club-wielding man continued to
harangue them. One of the more perspicacious among them finally identified him as
Bao Yong, and gradually the others regained their nerve and began saying shakily:
   ‘One of the thieves managed to escape altogether! But some of them are still up
on the roo￡’
   The instant Bao Yong heard this, he vaulted up onto the roof and went in hot
pursuit.
   After the main part of their mission was accomplished, the thieves, knowing how
unprotected the Jia mansion was, had been casually snooping around in Xi-chun’s
courtyard, and had caught a glimpse there of a very attractive young nun, which had
put all sorts of mischievous ideas into their heads. They knew that the apartment was
unguarded save by a handful of scared old women, and were about to kick the door
in and put an abrupt end to Adamantina’s meditations when they heard the sound of
footsteps coming from outside and escaped onto the roof-top. They soon saw that
they outnumbered their pursuers and had decided to fight it out when a man leapt
up onto the roof and came after them.
   He was on his own and they therefore moved into the attack with short swords,
only to find themselves quickly outmatched. With a few powerful and deftly placed
strokes of his club, Bao Yong had soon despatched one of them off the roof, while the
rest fled over the wall into the Garden, where others of the gang had been stationed
to receive the stolen goods. These now drew their swords in defence of the returning
party, and seeing there was only one man following them, they closed in on him.
   ‘Petty thieves!’ stormed Bao Yong. ‘Do you dare to do battle with me?’
   ‘They knocked one of us down!’ exclaimed one of the gang. ‘He may not even be
alive, but we’d better try to get him out!’
   Bao Yong moved into the attack, and four or five of the thieves formed a ring
around him, brandishing their swords in a confused melee, which finally broke up
when some of the night-watchmen plucked up enough courage to come to Bao
Yong’s aid, and the outnumbered thieves made good their escape. Bao Yong, still in
hot pursuit, tripped over some unseen obstacle lying on the roof, and when he
clambered to his feet and saw that it was a chest, he deduced that the thieves had
failed to take their loot with them, and therefore abandoned his pursuit. They must
anyway be well ahead and beyond reach by now, he reflected. He told the servants to
fetch lights. On closer inspection he discovered that there were several chests and
that they were all empty. He gave orders for them to be removed and himself headed
back to the main apart?ment. His lack of familiarity with the lay-out of the mansion
caused him to wander into Xi-feng’s apartment, where all the lights were ablaze.
   ‘Have the thieves been here?’ he asked.
   ‘We haven’t opened the doors,’ came Patience’s trembling voice from within. ‘But
we heard cries from the main apartments - you’d better go there.’
   Bao Yong had no sense of direction, but he saw the other watchmen in the
distance and followed them to the main apartment, where he found doors and
windows thrown open and the women on night-duty sobbing.
   Presently Jia Yun and Steward Lin arrived, appalled by the news of the burglary.
They found Grandmother Jia’s door wide open and could see by the lamplight that
the lock had been wrenched open and the chests and cupboards inside had all been
broken apart. There were curses for the women on night-duty:
   ‘Are you all half-dead? Didn’t you even know there were thieves in the house?’
   ‘There’s a roster for night-duty,’ came the tearful reply, ‘and we’re on second and
third watches. We never stopped on our rounds, we checked front and back. The
thieves came during the fourth and fifth watches, just after we finished duty. We
heard the shouting, but couldn’t see anyone, and when we came to look, the things
had already gone. Please, sirs, question the fourth and fifth watch, not us!’
   ‘You deserve to die, the lot of you!’ exclaimed Steward Lin. ‘I’ll talk to you later.
First I must inspect the rest of the house.’
   The night-watchmen led him to You-shi’s apartment, which was securely closed.
They heard voices crying from within:
   ‘We nearly died of fright!’
   ‘Has anything been taken from here?’ asked Lin. The women finally opened the
door.
   ‘No, we’ve had nothing stolen.’
   Next Lin led his men to Xi-chun’s, where again they heard voices inside:
   ‘Lord save us! Miss Xi-chun’s died of fright! Please wake up, miss!’
   Lin told them to open up, and asked them what had happened. An old woman
appeared in the doorway:
   ‘The thieves were fighting in our courtyard, and Miss Xi-chun was terribly
frightened. Luckily Sister Adamantina and Miss Land?scape have brought her round.
We’ve had nothing stolen.’
   ‘What do you mean - fighting?’ asked Lin.
   One of the watchmen replied.
   ‘It was young Bao Yong who saved the day, sir. He climbed onto the roof and
chased them away. And I heard one got knocked down.’
   ‘Yes,’ put in Bao Yong. ‘The body’s over by the Garden gate. You’d better hurry over
there and have a look.’
   Jia Yun and company went to the Garden gate, and sure enough there lying on the
ground was the dead body of a man, which on closer inspection was found to
resemble very closely Zhou Rui’s adopted son He San. They were all greatly taken
aback by this discovery. One man was left to stand guard over the body and two
were sent to keep a watch on the front and rear Garden gates, which were both
found to have their locks intact. Lin now gave orders to open the main gate and to
report the burglary to the police.
   The police arrived straight away and began their investigation. The thieves, they
concluded, had climbed up onto the roof-top from a back alley and had made their
way across to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where broken tiles were found and more
tracks leading straight to the Garden at the rear.
   ‘They were armed!’ cried all the servants on night-duty.
   The police officer seemed somewhat put out by this:
   ‘There is no evidence of torches or anything that would point to armed robbery.
What grounds have you for this accusation?’
   ‘When we chased them, they started throwing tiles at us from the roof and we
couldn’t get near them. But our Bao Yong managed to climb onto the roof, and he
went after them and chased them as far as the Garden, where a whole lot more of
them were waiting and put up a fight. But when they found they couldn’t beat our
Bao Yong, they fled!’
   ‘You see,’ exclaimed the officer. ‘If they were really armed robbers, they would
surely have been able to overpower a single opponent. Anyway, enough of that. Find
out exactly what’s been taken and provide us with an inventory. Then we can make a
proper report on the matter.’
   Jia Yun and the other men now went to the main apartment, where they found
Xi-chun, and with her Xi-feng, who had dragged herself there despite her illness. Jia
Yun enquired after Xi-feng’s health, and greeted Xi-chun, and then they all set about
the un?enviable task of determining what was missing. With Faithful dead, and
Amber and the other maids away at the funeral, no one knew where to start. The
stolen things were all Lady Jia’s personal belongings and had always been kept stored
away under lock and key. They had never been properly inventoried.
   ‘The chests and cupboards were full of so many different things,’ they said. ‘And
now they’re all empty. The thieves must have had ample time to do their work. What
were the women on night-duty doing, for heaven’s sake? Since the dead body was He
San’s, and since he is the adopted son of the Zhous, they were probably all in on it
together.’
   Xi-feng was livid with rage when she heard this.
   ‘Tie up all the women concerned,’ she ordered, ‘and hand them over to the police
for questioning.’
  There was a general outcry, pleas for mercy, women down on their knees begging.
To learn what was done with them, and whether or not any of the stolen goods were
found, please turn to the next chapter.



CHAPTER 112

Adamantina discharges a karmic debt and receives a blow
from the Hand of Providence
Aunt Zhao concludes a deadly feud and sets out
on the road to the Nether World
The women on night-duty went down on their knees and begged Xi?-feng to spare
them, but Steward Lin and Jia Yun told them they were wasting their breath:
    ‘The Master left us to mind the house, and now that things have gone wrong, we
must all take our share of the blame. You needn’t think anyone’s going to bale you
out. If Zhou Rui’s adopted son is involved, then everyone - from Her Ladyship
downwards - men and women, masters and servants, is under suspicion.’
    ‘Fate has brought this on us,’ said Xi-feng, struggling for breath. ‘Why waste words?
Just take them away. As for the stolen things, you must be sure to tell the police that
they all belonged to Her Old Ladyship. Only the masters know the details. When
we’ve sent word to them and they come home, then of course we can make out a list
and hand it in to the police. The same statement must be made to the civil
authorities.’
    ‘Yes, ma’am.’ Jia Yun and Steward Lin went out to execute these instructions.
    Xi-chun had said nothing throughout this, but now she began to whimper: ‘I’ve
never heard of anything so terrible in all my life! Why did it have to be us? When
Uncle Zheng and Aunt Wang come home, how am I to face them? They’ll say they
left the house in our hands, they’ll blame us for this disaster. I shall die of shame!’
    Xi-feng: ‘It’s not our doing. The women on night-duty must take the blame.’
    Xi-chun: ‘It’s all very well for you to say that. You were ill anyway. But I’ve got no
excuse! It’s exactly what my sister-in-law planned! She wanted me to come to grief!
She deliberately talked Aunt Xing into giving me this responsibility. Now I’m quite
dis?graced!’ She broke down, sobbing violently.
    Xi-feng: ‘You mustn’t take it like that. We are all in disgrace. If you adopt such a
silly attitude, how am I to hold my head up?’
   As they were speaking they heard a man’s voice shouting in the courtyard:
   ‘I said we should have no truck with such women. They’re witches and whores the
lot of them! The Zhen family never allowed people like that in the house, and I didn’t
expect things to be so lax here! Her Old Ladyship’s funeral procession was hardly
through the front entrance yesterday when that nun from that Hermitage place came
pestering to be let in. I told her straight out that she couldn’t, but then the old
women on the side gate turned round and gave me some cheek, and begged her to
come in. So some of the time the side gate was closed, some of the time it was open
- who could tell what was going on! I lay awake worrying about it till two in the
morning, and then I heard shouts coming from the house here. So I called at the gate,
but they wouldn’t open up, and as the shouting was getting worse I broke the gate
down and came in. I saw some men in the west courtyard, chased them and killed
one of them. I only found out today that the place I was in was the courtyard of Miss
Xi-chun’s apartment. So the nun was there with her at the very time the burglary
took place. She slipped out this morning before dawn. She must have been the one
who let the burglars in. She’s the traitor in our midst!’
   ‘Who is that insolent fellow?’ asked Patience. ‘How dare he use such language
with Mrs Lian and Miss Xi-chun here inside?’
   ‘He mentioned the Zhen family,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It must be that vile servant they
palmed off on us.’
   Xi-chun had heard and understood Bao Yong only too clearly, and felt more
wretched than ever as a consequence.
   ‘Wasn’t there something about a nun in his babblings?’ Xi-feng continued, turning
to Xi-chun. ‘How did you come to have a nun staying with you? Where did she
spring from?’
   Xi-chun told her that Adamantina had visited her, and that she had stayed on to
play Go and keep her company during the night.
   ‘Oh, Adamantina!’ exclaimed Xi-feng. ‘How could she possibly have betrayed us!
What a ridiculous idea! But still, it would be most unfortunate if this loathsome
creature’s accusations ever reached Sir Zheng’s ears.’
   The more Xi-chun thought about the possible consequences for Adamantina the
more distressed she became. She rose to leave, but Xi-feng, though anxious herself
to return to her own apartment, feared that Xi-chun might do something rash in her
present state, and asked her to wait a little.
   ‘Before we go, we must make sure they have sorted what’s left of Grandmother’s
belongings; and we must set a watch.’
   Patience: ‘But nothing can be sorted before the authorities carry out their
inspection. Till then we should leave everything as it is. Has anyone been sent to
inform Sir Zheng?’
   Xi-feng: ‘You’d better send one of the serving-women to find out.’
   Presently the reply came back:
   ‘Steward Lin can’t go himself. Most of the servants are needed to be in attendance
for the inspection, and those that can be spared are incapable of explaining things
clearly to the Master. So Young Master Yun has already gone.’
   Xi-feng nodded, and sat down anxiously with Xi-chun to wait.

*

The gang, who had been brought together by He San and his friend for the express
purpose of burgling Rong-guo House, succeeded in laying their hands on a fair
amount of gold, silver and valuables and had already passed it out before they were
discovered. Even then they were able to see at a glance that their pursuers were
nothing to be afraid of; and therefore moved on to the west courtyard to in?vestigate
possibilities for burglary there. Through the window they spied two very attractive
young ladies sitting together in the lamp?light, one of whom was dressed in a nun’s
habit. Their baser instincts were immediately aroused, and they would have burst
recklessly in had they not a moment later seen the figure of Bao Yong coming in hot
pursuit. They then made a quick getaway, leaving the unfortunate He San behind to
the fate we have already described, and reassembled afterwards in secret with their
‘fence’. The next day they learned that He San had been stopped and killed, and that
the police and civil authorities had been alerted. It was no longer safe for them in
town, and after some discussion they decided to make their way back without delay
to their headquarters on the coast and rejoin their pirate friends. A general warrant
for their arrest would soon be issued, after which it would be impossible for them to
pass through the inspection posts.
   There was however one especially brazen character among them.
   ‘It’s all very well saying we ought to leave town,’ he said. ‘But I’ve still got my eye
on that little nun. Beautiful little piece of work! I wonder which convent she’s from,
the luscious thing!’
   ‘Aiyo!’ exclaimed one of the others. ‘I’ve just remembered. She must be that nun
who lives right on the premises, in Prospect Garden, in that place they call Green
Bower Hermitage. Wasn’t there a story going round a year or two ago about her and
their Master Bao? She fell head over heels in love with him and in the end they had
to call in the doctor. She must be the one!’
   ‘In that case,’ said the first, ‘let’s lie low tonight and give the skipper time to buy
the gear we need to pass as travelling merchants. Tomorrow at dawn bell you can
start leaving town at intervals and wait for me at Seven Mile Bank.’
   It was settled. They shared out the spoils and went their separate ways.

*

When Jia Zheng and the rest of the cortege had conveyed the cof?fins of Lady Jia and
Faithiul to the temple and had formally de?posited them there until such time as
they could be placed in a permanent grave, the various relatives and friends who had
accompanied them took their leave. Jia Zheng installed himself in one of the outer
wings of the temple as his ‘mourning quarters’, while the ladies stayed in the inner
room where the coffins had been placed. There was continuous lamentation
throughout the night.
   The next morning they began the funeral offerings once more, and were in the act
of setting out the sacrificial dishes when Jia Yun burst in. First he kowtowed before
Grandmother Jia’s coffin, then he hurried over to Jia Zheng, dropped one knee to the
ground and proceeded to give a breathless account of the previous night’s bur?glary
and the loss of Grandmother Jia’s belongings. He described how Bao Yong had given
chase and had killed one of the robbers, and concluded by saying that the facts had
already been laid before the police and civil authorities. Jia Zheng listened to all this
aghast, while the ladies, who overheard with horror from the inner room, were also
too shocked to speak and could only sob loudly. Eventually Jia Zheng composed
himself sufficiently to ask:
   ‘What sort of an inventory has been made of the stolen items?’
   Jia Yun: ‘None of the servants knew what was there, so the inventory has not been
made yet.’
   Jia Zheng: ‘A good thing too. After the confiscation, if we were to include things of
value in the inventory, we’d be guilty of a further infringement of the law. Tell Lian to
come here at once.’
   Jia Lian had gone with Bao-yu and some of the other young male Jias to make
offerings in a different part of the temple, and hurried back on receiving Jia Zheng’s
summons. The news put him in a state of extreme agitation, and in front of Jia Zheng
he began cursing and swearing at Jia Yun:
   ‘Miserable wretch! I entrust you with an important responsibility, and expect you
to organize the night-watch properly, and look what you have gone and done! Are
you half-dead or something? I’m amazed you have the nerve to come here at all!’
   He spat in his face. Jia Yun stood there with his hands hanging at his sides, not
daring to breathe a word.
   Jia Zheng (to Jia Lian): ‘Swearing at him won’t achieve anything.’
   Jia Lian (falling to his knees): ‘What are we to do?’
   Jia Zheng: ‘There’s nothing we can do, except wait and hope that the authorities
apprehend the thieves. The trouble is we never opened any of Grandmother’s boxes.
When you came to me for money, I thought it improper to start taking her silver
when she’d only been dead a few days. I decided to wait until after the funeral and to
settle all our accounts at once and invest any surplus in trust-estates here and in the
South. So we don’t even know exactly what she had left. Now the police want an
inventory, and we can hardly include any?thing of value on it; but at the same time
we’ll never get away with “sundry quantities of gold and silver and various items of
clothing and jewellery”. Come on, what are you still kneeling down there for, you
useless creature!’
   Jia Lian did not dare say a word, but rose to his feet and began walking out of the
room.
   Jia Zheng: ‘Where are you off to now?’
   Jia Lian retraced his steps.
   ‘I thought I should go home at once and try to sort this out properly.’
   There was a ‘hm’ from Jia Zheng (signifying, ‘I should think so too’), and Jia Lian
hung his head abjectly.
   Jia Zheng: ‘Report first to your mother. When you go home, take one or two of
Grandmother’s maids with you. Tell them to think carefully, and produce something
in the way of an inventory...’
   Jia Lian knew that Faithful had been in charge of all Grandmother Jia’s personal
effects, and that now she was dead it would be useless to ask Pearl or the other
maids to remember. But he hadn’t the nerve to contradict Jia Zheng, and responding
docilely to his instructions, he went to the inner room, where he had to endure the
reproaches of Ladies Xing and Wang, and was then ordered to hurry home and bid
the women on night-duty prepare themselves for their mistresses’ wrath. Assuring
his mother and aunt with a somewhat ill grace that he would do as they commanded,
Jia Lian went out and ordered one of his men to hire a carriage for Amber and
Grandmother Jia’s other maids, while he himself mounted a mule and hastened
home with a few of his pages. Jia Yun had no stomach for further confrontations with
Jia Zheng, and he sneaked out in a sort of sideways slither, mounted horse and
caught up with Jia Lian. Their ride into town passed uneventfully.
   Jia Lian was greeted at Rong-guo House by Steward Lin, who led him into
Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where they found Xi-feng and Xi-chun waiting.
Seething as he was with bitterness towards them both, Jia Lian restrained himself
and turned to ask Lin:
   ‘Have the authorities had a look yet?’
   Lin (kneeling guiltily): ‘Both the police and the civil authorities have made an
inspection, sir. They discovered the burglars’ tracks, and examined the corpse.’
   Jia Lian (with considerable surprise): ‘What corpse?’
   Steward Lin told him how Bao Yong had killed one of the burglars, and that the
dead man showed a strong resemblance to Zhou Rui’s adopted son.
   Jia Lian: ‘Send for Jia Yun!’
   When Jia Yun came in, he too fell to his knees before Jia Lian.
   Jia Lian: ‘Why didn’t you tell Uncle Zheng about this, that one of the burglars was
Zhou Rui’s adopted son, and that he had been killed by Bao Yong?’
   Jia Yun: ‘The men on night-duty only said that it looked like him. I was afraid they
might turn out to be wrong, so I didn’t mention it.’
   Jia Lian: ‘Idiot! If you’d told me, I could have brought Zhou Rui with me to identify
the corpse. That would have settled any doubt.’
   Lin: ‘The authorities have taken the corpse away and exhibited it in the
market-place for identification.’
   Jia Lian: ‘That’s pretty damned foolish of them! As if anyone would come forward
for a man that’s been killed escaping from a burglary!’
   Lin: ‘There’s no need for identification anyway, sir. I recognized the man myself.’
   Jia Lian pondered for a minute.
   ‘Of course! Wasn’t it Zhou Rui’s adopted son that Mr Zhen wanted to have flogged
a year or so ago?’
   Lin: ‘That’s right, sir. He was caught fighting with Bao Er. You must have seen him
at the time.’
   Jia Lian was made angrier still by this revelation, and wanted to beat the man on
night-duty, but Steward Lin pleaded with him to abate his wrath.
   ‘They had their orders, sir, and I’m sure they did their duty. But it is a strict family
regulation that men are not allowed beyond the inner gate. Even we are not allowed
in unless expressly sent for. Master Yun and I did our rounds regularly in the outer
apartments; the inner gate was firmly closed, and none of the outer gates was left
open. The burglars broke in from a back alley.’
   Jia Lian: ‘Where are the women who were supposed to be on night-duty in the
inner apartments?’
   Lin informed him that on Xi-feng’s instructions the women had all been detained
and bound, and were waiting to be interrogated.
   Jia Lian: ‘And Bao Yong?’
   Lin: ‘He has gone back to the Garden.’
   Jia Lian: ‘Send for him.’
   The pages went to fetch Bao Yong, and when he arrived Jia Lian praised him for his
conduct:
  ‘It’s a good job you were here! Otherwise I dare say everything in the house would
have been taken!’
  Bao Yong said nothing. Xi-chun was terrified that he was going to open his mouth
and start abusing Adamantina. Xi-feng maintained an apprehensive silence.
  It was reported meanwhile that Amber and the other maids had arrived from the
temple, and they entered and amid much weeping exchanged greetings with the rest
of the household. On Jia Lian’s orders the servants searched Grandmother Jia’s
apartment to see what if anything the burglars had left behind, and found nothing
but clothes, a few lengths of fabric and some caskets of copper cash. Jia Lian was now
more distraught than ever. The men working on the awning and the pall-bearers had
not been paid, nor had the extra kitchen expenses for the funeral reception been
met. Where was he to find the money now? He brooded morosely, while Amber and
the other maids went into Grandmother Jia’s inner rooms and broke into a renewed
fit of sobbing as they surveyed the havoc. The boxes and cupboards were all flung
Open, and how could they possibly remember what had been in them? However,
they eventually managed to concoct a list of sorts, which they handed to a servant to
deliver to the authorities. Jia Lian issued instructions for that night’s watch, and
Xi-feng and Xi-chun went back to their rooms. Jia Lian thought it best not to spend
the night at home, and did not even find time to reproach Xi-feng for her part in the
affair. As soon as he could get away he mounted horse and galloped back to the
temple. Xi-feng was still anxious that Xi-chun might be contemplating suicide, and
sent Felicity over to comfort her.

*

At ten o’clock that night the gates were firmly barred - a somewhat superfluous
precaution by now - and everyone lay in bed in a state of nervous wakefulness. But
our narrative leaves Rong-guo House and returns to the nun-besotted burglar. He
knew that the Hermitage occupied an isolated location in the Garden, and that the
nun’s only companions there were a few old matrons and novices, who would
present no obstacle. He made his plans accordingly. At midnight, when all was quiet,
equipped with a knife and a supply of potent narcotic incense, he scaled the Garden
wall, and from his vantage point there he could see in the distance lamps burning in
the Her?mitage. He crept stealthily across and hid himself in an out-of-the-?way
corner.
   By two o’clock, there was only a single night-light still burning. Adamantina was
sitting cross-legged on her mat. She took a short break from her meditations, and
after several gusty sighs reflected aloud to herself:
   ‘When I came to the capital from my old home on Mount Xuan?-mu, I had hoped
to make a name for myself. But then when the Jias invited me to stay here, I could
hardly decline their invitation. And now I can’t even do something as simple and
innocent as paying a visit to Xi-chun without being heaped with abuse by some
coarse creature. And later in the night I had such a fright! How nervous I’ve been all
day, ever since my return. I simply can’t settle down properly and meditate.’
   She usually meditated alone, and even today had not asked the others to stay up
with her. But suddenly at four o’clock she began to tremble with cold and was about
to call out to one of her women when she heard a sound through the window. She
thought im?mediately of what had happened the previous evening and gave a
terrified cry for help! But it brought no answer. From where she sat she could detect
a strange smell seeping right into her head, and she felt her limbs becoming gradually
numb and incapable of movement, her mouth incapable of speech. Panic began to
grip her. Helplessly she watched as a stranger entered her room, a man, with a knife
glistening in his hand. Though she was paralysed, her mind was still clear, and
thinking that she was about to be murdered she steeled herself mentally to her fate
and found herself surprisingly free of fear. Then to her amazement the man slipped
the knife back into the scabbard slung over his shoulder, came towards her and put
both his arms softly round her. He fondled her briefly, then hoisted her up onto his
back. By now Adamantina was too groggy to understand what was happening to her.
The drugs had sent her into a profound stupor, and she surrendered her virginal body
into the stranger’s hands, to do with as he pleased.
   With Adamantina on his back, the man made his way to the Garden wall, which he
scaled with a rope-ladder, climbing down to where some of his accomplices were
waiting with the getaway cart. They bundled her in and set off. The
impressive-looking official titles inscribed on the carriage lanterns enabled them to
pass through the district barricades, and by the time they reached the city gate it was
opening time and the gatekeeper did not even bother to ask any questions, thinking
they were on official business. Once out of the city, they pressed on to Seven Mile
Bank, where they joined the rest of the gang and agreed to make their ways
separately to the South coast.
   It is not known what eventually became of Adamantina: whether she submitted
willingly to her captor’s desires, or whether she resisted and died in so doing. In the
absence of conclusive evidence as to her ultimate fate, it would be futile for us to
speculate on that subject. Instead, our narrative returns to the Hermitage. One of the
old nuns who had her quarters to the rear of Adamantina’s meditation chamber slept
that night until four in the morning, when she was awakened by the sound of voices
from the front room. Adamantina must be having a restless spell in her meditations,
she concluded. But then afterwards she heard heavy (and unmistakably male)
footsteps and the sound of doors and windows opening and closing. She would have
risen to investigate, but her limbs had become quite weak and she could not so much
as open her mouth to speak. No further sound came from Adamantina’s room, and
the old nun lay there till dawn in a stupor, with her eyes wide open. It was only then
that her head began to clear; she threw on some clothes and told the old matrons to
heat the water for Adamantina’s morning tea. Then she went to the front room, but
to her alarm found no trace of Ada?mantina, and door and windows open wide. She
began to have suspicions about the sounds she had heard in the night.
   ‘Where could she have gone so early in the morning?’ she asked aloud.
   Walking out into the Garden, she saw a rope-ladder hanging from the wall, and
lying on the ground beneath it a scabbard and sash.
   ‘Oh my goodness! It must have been a burglar last night! He must have put us all
to sleep!’
   She called the others to rise and make a search of the Hermitage. The main gate
was still firmly closed.
   ‘Oh dear, the fumes from the stove were terrible last night!’ grumbled the old
matrons and young novices alike when they were summoned. ‘None of us felt like
getting up this morning. What do you want us for at this ungodly hour?’
   ‘Sister Adamantina has disappeared!’ exclaimed the nun.
   ‘She’s probably in Our Lady Guan-yin’s chapel meditating.’
   ‘You’re all still dreaming! Come and have a look.’
   The women finally roused themselves in a flurry of alarm, opened the main gate of
the Hermitage and searched throughout the Garden. Then it occurred to them that
Adamantina might have gone to visit Xi-chun, and they went in a body to knock at
the side gate, only to receive another round of abuse from Bao Yong.
   ‘We don’t know where Sister Adamantina went last night,’ they said. ‘We’re
looking for her. Open up, old fellow, and let us into the house. We just want to find
out if she’s been visiting there or not.’
   ‘She was the one who let the burglars in!’ cried Bao Yong. ‘Now they’ve got what
they came for, and she’s gone off with them to enjoy it!’
   ‘Holy Name!’ exclaimed one of the women. ‘You’ll have your tongue cut out in hell
for such wicked talk!’
   Bao Yong (vehemently): ‘Rubbish! Any more trouble from you and I’ll have to use
force.’
   Women (smiling obsequiously now and pleading): ‘Please sir, we beseech you,
open the gate. Just let us have a look. If she’s not there, we’ll never bother you
again.’
   Bao Yong: ‘Very well. If you don’t believe me, go in and look for yourselves. But if
you don’t find her, I shall want an explanation from you on your way back.’
   He opened the gate and the women went into Xi-chun’s apartment.
   Xi-chun was in very low spirits that morning, and was still brooding about what
had happened the previous day:
   ‘Adamantina went home so early yesterday. I wonder if she heard what that
servant Bao Yong said. If he has offended her again, she’ll never come and visit me;
and then I shall have lost my only real friend in the world. With Mother and Father
both dead and my own sister-in-law hating me the way she does, I find it so hard to
face other people. Before there was always Granny Jia, I knew I could count on her
for affection. Now that she’s gone too, I’m utterly alone. What will become of me?’
   She thought of the other girls and their various fates:
   ‘Ying-chun driven to her death; Xiang-yun married to a con?sumptive; Tan-chun
living at the other end of the world ... Each one of them had her destiny, and each
was powerless to change its course. Adamantina is the only free one among us, free
as a wandering cloud or a wild crane. If I could only be like her, how happy I would be!
But how can I hope to follow her example? I belong to a wealthy family! And now I’ve
let even my family down, and I’m in complete disgrace. Neither Aunt Wang nor Aunt
Xing understands how I feel. There’s no telling how life will turn out for me!’
   She was more resolved than ever to take the final, irrevocable step, to cut her hair
and by so doing signal once and for all her entry into the religious life. Landscape and
the other maids heard the snip of the scissors and hurried over, but they were too
late. She had already removed a good half of her hair.
   ‘Before one disaster is over, here’s another!’ cried Landscape in alarm. ‘What are
we to do now?’
   This was the state of disarray that prevailed in Xi-chun’s apartment when
Adamantina’s old women arrived on their search. Landscape enquired what their
mission was and was shocked to hear of Ada?mantina’s disappearance.
   ‘She left us early yesterday morning and hasn’t been back since,’ she informed
them. Xi-chun overheard from inside and asked in alarm:
   ‘Where has Adamantina gone?’
   One of the women told the tale, how they had heard sounds in the night, had
been put to sleep by the incense, had found Adamantina missing in the morning and
discovered the rope-ladder and scabbard by the Garden wall. Xi-chun was both
distressed and puzzled. She recalled Bao Yong’s accusations of the previous day, but
dismissed them at once from her mind, reflecting that most probably the bur?glars
had spotted Adamantina and come back during the night to carry her off. But she
knew Adamantina; surely a person of such chastity and pride would have died rather
than submit to such indignity?
   ‘Didn’t you hear anything?’ she asked of the women.
   ‘We heard,’ they replied. ‘But we couldn’t do anything. We could only lie there
with our eyes wide open, unable to say a word. The burglars must have put us to
sleep by burning some sort of incense. And Sister Adamantina must have been
overcome with the fumes too. That’s why she couldn’t speak either. Besides, there
were probably a lot of them, armed to the hilt, so she would have been too scared to
make a noise or cry out.’
   Bao Yong could be heard yelling from the gate:
   ‘Get those stupid old hags out of here and close the gate at once!’
   Landscape, who was afraid of causing fresh trouble, told the women to leave
immediately and gave orders for the gate to be closed.
   Xi-chun was now more miserable than ever. Landscape and her other maids
repeatedly urged her to take a more reasonable view, and persuaded her to put up
the remaining portion of her hair.
   ‘We mustn’t spread the word about Adamantina,’ they all agreed. ‘Even if it is true,
we must behave as if we know nothing until Sir Zheng and Lady Wang come home.’
   From this day, Xi-chun’s determination to renounce the world was immovable. But
of this no more at present.

*

When Jia Lian returned to the Temple of the Iron Threshold, he reported to Jia Zheng
that he had interrogated the men on night-duty and had seen to it that an inventory
was prepared and delivered to the authorities.
   ‘How did you manage with the inventory?’ asked Jia Zheng.
   Jia Lian showed him a copy of the list Amber had made up from memory, adding:
   ‘All Grandmother’s presents from Her Grace are clearly indicated. Any other
unusual or conspicuous items have been left off the list. When my period of
mourning is over, I shall instigate a search for those items and am confident we shall
find them.’
   Jia Zheng thought this course of action wise, and nodded his silent approval.
   Jia Lian went in to see Ladies Xing and Wang, and begged them to urge Jia Zheng
to return home as soon as possible. The longer they stayed away the greater the
chaos would be when they got back.
   ‘I quite agree,’ said Lady Xing. ‘So long as we stay here, we’ll only be in this
dreadful suspense anyway.’
   ‘I would not dare suggest an early departure myself;’ said Jia Lian. ‘But if it came
from you, Mother, I am sure Uncle Zheng would agree.’
   Lady Xing discussed the matter with Lady Wang, and they both agreed that Lian’s
suggestion was a good one.
   As it turned out, by the next morning Jia Zheng was himself anxious to return and
sent Bao-yu in to the ladies with this message:
   ‘I propose that we return today and resume our mourning here in two or three
days’ time. I have given the necessary instructions to those of my servants who are
staying behind; would the ladies be so good as to do likewise?’
   Lady Xing instructed Parrot and some of the other maids to stay as mourners, and
left Zhou Rui’s wife and a few of the older stewardesses in overall charge. Everyone
else was to return home. There was an immediate bustle of activity as carriages were
prepared and horses saddled, and Jia Zheng led the family in a final lamentation,
bidding ceremonial farewell to Grandmother Jia’s mortal remains.
   They had all risen from their prostrations and were about to leave, when they
noticed that Aunt Zhao was still down on her knees. Aunt Zhou thought she must still
be weeping and came over to help her up. But something more than grief had
incapacitated her; she was foaming at the mouth, her eyes were fixed in a glassy
stare, her tongue protruded from her face. The sight gave everyone a nasty turn, and
Jia Huan came up to his mother crying frantically, which seemed to bring her round
momentarily.
   ‘I won’t go home!’ she began babbling. ‘I’m going back to the South with Lady Jia!’
   ‘But why should Lady Jia need you to go with her?’ they asked.
   ‘I’ve been with her all my life. Sir She wanted to separate us and tried all manner
of tricks to lay his hands on me. I thought old Mother Ma could help me get my own
back but that was all money wasted: it didn’t work, nobody died. Now if I go home,
I’m afraid someone may try to take revenge!’
   At first they thought she was possessed by the spirit of Faithful, but her
subsequent reference to Mother Ma pointed to something quite different. The ladies
said nothing, but Suncloud and some of the other maids interceded with the spirit on
Aunt Zhao’s behalf:
   ‘Sister Faithful, your death was of your own choosing; what does it have to do with
Mrs Zhao? Please set her free!’
   With Lady Xing present they didn’t dare say any more.
   ‘I’m not Faithful!’ protested Aunt Zhao. ‘I’ve been sent for by King Yama of the
Nether World. He wants to question me about Mother Ma and the black magic...’
   She dropped her voice to a whisper, and continued:
   ‘Oh Mrs Lian, put in a good word for me with Lord Yama! For all the bad that I’ve
done, there must be some good! Dear Mrs Lian! Dearest Mrs Lian! I never meant to
harm you! I was such a fool! I should never have listened to that old slut!’
   While this extraordinary scene was taking place, Jia Zheng sent in a servant to
fetch Jia Huan. One of the serving-women went out to inform the Master that Aunt
Zhao was possessed by some evil spirit, and that Jia Huan was looking after her.
   ‘What nonsense!’ exclaimed Jia Zheng brusquely. ‘We’re leaving now anyway.’
   So the men set off, while Aunt Zhao continued to rave deliriously and no one could
bring her to her senses. Lady Xing was afraid she might say something even more
indiscreet.
   ‘Leave some women here to keep an eye on her,’ she ordered. ‘We really must be
going. When we reach the city we’ll send ~ doctor.’
   Lady Wang had always disliked Aunt Zhao and was only too glad to abandon her.
Bao-chai, on the other hand, was less ill-disposed towards her; she knew that Aunt
Zhao had tried to harm Bao-yu, but could not help feeling sorry for her all the same
and secretly asked Aunt Zhou to stay behind with her. Aunt Zhou was a good soul,
and agreed to do so. Li Wan volunteered to stay as well, but was informed curtly by
Lady Wang that her presence would be unnecessary.
   They were now ready to leave.
   ‘What about me?’ asked Jia Huan in some alarm. ‘Do I have to stay too?’
   ‘You great booby!’ retorted Lady Wang contemptuously (and not a little
hypocritically). ‘Would you forsake your own mother when she is at death’s door?’
   Jia Huan dared not utter another word.
   ‘Dear brother,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you really ought to stay. As soon as we get to town, I’ll
send someone out to you.’
   They climbed into their carriages and returned home, leaving Aunt Zhao with Aunt
Zhou, Jia Huan and a few serving-women at the temple.
   When they reached home, Jia Zheng, the ladies and the rest of the family went to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment and tearfully surveyed the scene. Steward Lin came in
at the head of the domestic staff to pay their respects.
   ‘Get out!’ shouted Jia Zheng as they fell to their knees. ‘I shall deal with you
tomorrow!’
   Xi-feng had already fainted several times that day, and was too weak to come out
and welcome them home. The only person to receive them was Xi-chun, looking
extremely ashamed of herself. Lady Xing ignored her entirely, Lady Wang was her
reasonable self, while Li Wan and Bao-chai took her by the hand and spoke a few
comforting words. You-shi predictably had a barbed comment to make:
   ‘What a deal of trouble we have put you to these last few days, my dear!’
   Xi-chun could say nothing in reply, but only blushed a deep crimson from ear to ear.
Bao-chai took You-shi aside and gave her a meaningful look. The ladies went to their
rooms.
   Jia Zheng examined the extent of the damage, heaving many a silent sigh. He went
into his study and, sitting on his mourning mat, sent for Jia Lian, Jia Rong and Jia Yun
and gave the three of them a short homily. Bao-yu wanted to wait on him in the
study, but Jia Zheng said it would not be necessary. Jia Lian went to his mother’s
room. That night passed uneventfully.
   First thing next morning Steward Lin came into the study and knelt before Jia
Zheng, who asked him for a full account of the calamity. Lin mentioned that Zhou Rui
was involved:
   ‘Mr Lian’s servant Bao Er has been arrested, and some of the items on the
inventory of stolen property have been found on his person. He is being interrogated,
and they hope to trace the burglars through him.’
   This piece of information threw Jia Zheng into a rage:
   ‘That our servants should have the base ingratitude to betray us to thieves, that
they steal from their own masters! It is sheer treason!’
   He sent a man at once to the temple to bind Zhou Rui and deliver him to the
authorities for questioning. Lin remained kneeling and did not dare rise to his feet.
   ‘What are you still down there for?’
   ‘I deserve to die, sir! I beg your forgiveness!’
   Lai Da and some of the other stewards now came in to pay their respects and to
present the various bills for funeral expenses.
   ‘Give these to Mr Lian to deal with. He can report back to me afterwards.’
   Jia Zheng bellowed at Lin to get up and leave the study. Jia Lian now knelt on one
knee and whispered a suggestion in Jia Zheng’s ear.
   ‘Out of the question!’ snapped Jia Zheng, glowering at Lian. ‘Just because the
money for Mother’s funeral has been taken by thieves, does that mean we must
stoop to fining our own servants?’
   Jia Lian blushed and said nothing further. He stood up but dared not move.
   ‘How is it with your wife?’ asked Jia Zheng.
   Jia Lian knelt again.
   ‘I’m afraid she is near the end.’
   Jia Zheng sighed.
   ‘I never dreamt that our family would crumble as quickly as this! And now, to add
to our misfortunes, Huan’s mother has been taken ill at the temple, and we still don’t
know what’s the matter with her. Do you know anything about this?’
   Jia Lian did not dare breathe a word.
   ‘Tell one of the servants,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘to take a doctor out there and have a
look at her, will you?’
  ‘Yes, Uncle.’
  Jia Lian went out at once, and executed these instructions. To learn if Aunt Zhao
survived or not, please turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 113

Xi-feng repents of her former misdeeds, and entrusts
her child to a village dame
Nightingale softens a long-standing animosity,
and warms to her besotted master
After the departure of most of the family from the temple, Aunt Zhao grew more
delirious than ever, and those who had remained with her listened aghast. Two
serving-women attempted to support her where she knelt on the ground, one
minute raving incoherently, the next sobbing her heart out in anguish. Then she
grovelled and began begging for mercy:
   ‘Oh Great Lord Red Beard! You’re killing me! I’ll never be so wicked again!’
   She wrung her hands and howled in agony. Her eyes bulged out of their sockets,
blood gushed from her mouth, her hair was wildly dishevelled. She was a terrifying
sight, and no one now dared go near her.
   By evening her voice began to grow hoarse and she sounded more and more like a
croaking harpy. None of the women could bear to be in her presence, and they
deputed some of the more courageous menfolk to come in and keep watch on her.
One minute she seemed to be gone, then she came round again, and so it went on all
night. By the next morning she was incapable of speech, her face was horribly
contorted and she began rending her clothes and baring her bosom, as if someone
else was stripping her naked. She was now totally inarticulate, and the torment she
was undergoing was terrible to behold.
   She seemed to have reached a final crisis, when the doctor arrived. He would not
take her pulse, but gave orders at once for her last things to be made ready and
himself prepared to leave without further ado. The servant who had brought him
entreated him to stay and take her pulse, so that he could at least return with a
satisfactory report to his master, and in the end the doctor relented. He felt her pulse
once, and pronounced that there was no sign of life. Hearing this, Jia Huan burst out
wailing, and immediately everyone’s atten?tion was turned to him and no one spared
another thought for Aunt Zhao, lying dead on the kang, her feet bare, her hair in
disarray. Only Aunt Zhou seemed affected.
   ‘Such is the end of a concubine!’ she thought morbidly to herself. ‘And she even
bore the Master a son. Who knows what sort of a death mine will be!’
   The servant meanwhile hurried back to inform Jia Zheng, who sent a man to
attend to Aunt Zhao’s funeral arrangements and to stay on with Jia Huan at the
temple for three days, after which they were both to return. The accepted version of
Aunt Zhao’s death was that she had been called before the Infernal Tribunal and
tortured to death for her wilful attempt to injure the lives of others. A speedy end
was also predicted for Xi-feng, since Aunt Zhao had named her as her own accuser in
the Nether World.
   When this last piece of gossip reached the ears of Patience, she was most
distressed. Her mistress did indeed seem beyond hope of re?covery, and to make
matters worse, Jia Lian had recently made it plain that he had no scrap of affection
left for his wife. He was now more preoccupied than ever, and appeared completely
unconcerned by Xi-feng’s illness. Patience did her best to be cheerful with Xi-?feng;
but Ladies Xing and Wang, although they had been back from the temple for several
days, had neither of them paid her a personal visit, and had only sent a maid to
enquire after her health. Their coldness intensified Xi-feng’s misery, as did the fact
that Jia Lian on his return had not so much as a kind word for her.
   All Xi-feng wanted now was to die a quick death, and this made her a prey to all
manner of evil spirits. On one occasion she saw the figure of You Er-jie slowly
approaching her bed from the back of the room.
   ‘It is so long since we last met, sister!’ said the apparition. ‘I’ve thought a great
deal about you, but it’s been impossible for me to come and see you. Now I’ve
managed to do so at last, and I find you reduced to this extremity. Lian is too much of
a fool to appreciate what you’ve done for him, and instead he complains how mean
you are, and says that you’re ruining his career and making him feel thoroughly
ashamed. I can’t bear to see you treated so!’
   ‘I myself have come to regret my own small-mindedness,’ mumbled Xi-feng in reply.
‘Dear sister! It is so kind of you to visit me like this, and to put past grievances behind
you!’
   Patience was standing at her side and heard her speaking.
   ‘What was that, ma’am?’ she asked.
   Xi-feng suddenly awoke and recalled at once that You Er-jie was dead. This must be
her spirit seeking the life of her tormentor in vengeance. Now that Patience had
woken her, she felt scared but at the same time reluctant to confess her fear. She
tried somewhat shakily to compose herself.
   ‘I’m just feeling a little unsettled,’ she said to Patience. ‘I think I must have been
talking in my sleep. Will you come and give me a rub?’
   Patience climbed up onto the kang and had just started pummelling her when a
junior maid came in and announced that Grannie Liu had come, and was being
brought in by the serving-women to pay her respects to Mrs Lian.
   ‘Where is she?’ asked Patience, getting down anxiously from the kang.
   ‘She didn’t presume to come straight in,’ replied the maid. ‘She is waiting for Mrs
Lian’s instructions.’
   Patience nodded. She thought that Xi-feng would feel too weak to receive visitors,
and said to the maid:
   ‘Mrs Lian needs to have a rest. Tell Grannie Liu to wait a while. Did you ask her
what she has come about?’
   ‘They have already asked her,’ replied the maid, ‘and she said she has come on no
particular business. She has only just learned of Her Old Ladyship’s death. She would
have come before if she had known sooner.’
   Xi-feng had overheard them, and called Patience over:
   ‘If someone has had the kindness to call, we must not appear rude or
unappreciative. Go and ask Grannie Liu to come in. I should like to talk to her.’
   Patience reluctantly complied, and went out herself to fetch Grannie Liu. As soon
as she left the room, Xi-feng began to drift off to sleep again, and as her eyes closed
she saw another apparition -this time a man and a woman walking towards the kang.
It seemed they were about to climb up onto it, and she called out in alarm for
Patience:
   ‘There’s a man coming towards me!’
   Her cries brought Felicity and Crimson rushing to her bedside.
   ‘What do you want, ma’am?’
Xi-feng opened her eyes. The figures had vanished. She knew they must be spectres
come to haunt her, but again could not bring herself to say so in front of the maids.
‘Where’s that wretched Patience got to?’ she asked.
   ‘Didn’t you send her to fetch Grannie Liu?’
   Xi-feng lay still for a while in silence to recover her spirits. Pres?ently Patience
returned with Grannie Liu, who had brought a little girl with her and was asking:
   ‘And where’s our Mrs Lian?’
   Patience led her up to the kang.
   ‘Good day, ma’am,’ said Grannie Liu.
   Xi-feng opened her eyes, and as she looked at the old dame, she felt strangely
moved.
   ‘How are you, Grannie?’ she asked. ‘Why has it been so long since you last came to
see us? How big your granddaughter has grown!’
   Grannie Liu was most distressed to see the state Xi-feng was in -as thin as a stick,
and evidently confused in her mind.
   ‘Why, Mrs Lian!’ she exclaimed. ‘To think that in the few months since last I was
here you could have fallen so ill! I’m a foolish old baggage and deserve to die for not
having visited you sooner!’
   She told little Qing-er to come up and pay her respects, but the girl only giggled.
Xi-feng thought what a sweet child she was, and told Crimson to take charge of her.
   ‘We country folk never fall ill,’ pronounced Grannie Liu. ‘If happen we should, then
we pray to the gods and make our vows. We never take medicines and the like. I’m
wondering now if you mightn’t have fallen foul of some evil spirit, to have taken ill
like this, ma’am?’
   Patience was aware that Grannie Liu’s rustic superstitions were ill-timed, and gave
her a meaningful tug from the rear. The old dame interpreted this correctly and fell
silent. But her words had in fact found an echo in Xi-feng’s own thoughts.
   ‘Grannie, dear,’ she said, speaking with a great effort, ‘you’re a lady with years of
experience, and what you say is true. Did you know that Aunt Zhao had died too? You
met her when you were here, didn’t you?’
   ‘Holy Name!’ exclaimed the old lady in the greatest surprise. ‘Fancy her dying, just
like that! She was such a sturdy body. And she’d a young son if I recall - what will
become of him?’
   ‘He’ll be all right,’ Patience consoled her. ‘He still has the Master and Lady Wang to
look after him.’
   ‘That’s as may be,’ replied Grannie Liu gravely. ‘But can you be so sure, miss? I
mean, it’s his own mother - however bad she may have been - as has died. Nobody
can ever take a mother’s place.’
   This coincided with another of Xi-feng’s keenest anxieties, and she broke down and
began sobbing. They all rallied round to comfort her.
   When Qiao-jie heard her mother in such distress, she came to the kang, held her
hand and burst into tears herself.
   ‘Have you said hello to Grannie Liu?’ asked Xi-feng tearfully.
   ‘No, Mama.’
   ‘She gave you your name, and is like a foster-mother to you. Give her a curtsey
now.’
   Qiao-jie went across to Grannie Liu and was about to curtsey when Grannie Liu
seized her and said:
   ‘Holy Precious Name! Don’t you go weighing me down with such honours - it’ll
carry me to my grave! Miss Qiao-jie, it’s over a year since I last was here; do you still
remember me?’
   ‘Of course I do! That time when I saw you in the Garden I was still a very little girl.
But I remember two years ago I asked you to bring me some big crickets. I can see
you haven’t brought me any. You must have forgotten.’
   ‘Oh missie!’ exclaimed Grannie Liu. ‘What a silly old soul I am! If you want crickets
we’ve enough and to spare at home. But you never come and visit us. If you came,
you could bring home a cartload of crickets if you so wanted.’
   ‘In that case,’ put in Xi-feng, ‘why not take her home with you for a visit?’
   ‘How could I possibly, ma’am?’ said Grannie Liu laughing. ‘Such a fine gentle young
lady that’s grown up wrapped in silks and satins and used to dainty things to eat -
why, what would I give her to play with at home? What would I feed her with? Would
you have me die of shame?’
   She cackled and went on:
   ‘Mind you, I could act as a matchmaker for the young lady. Ours may only be a
village, but we’ve wealthy folk there all the same, with land that spreads for
thousands of acres around and hundreds of cattle and a fair bit of money too.
Nothing to compare with the treasure you’ve got here, of course. In fact come to
think of it you’d probably not so much as glance at such folk really, ma’am. But to us
country people they’re dwellers in heaven!’
   ‘By all means go ahead and propose the match,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I should be only too
pleased to give Qiao-jie in marriage to such a family.’
   ‘Come, ma’am, you must be joking. Why, I dare say you’d be fussy about some
great official family that lived in a big mansion, let alone simple country people. And
even if you were willing, I hardly think Their Ladyships would be!’
   Qiao-jie found the conversation embarrassing and had gone off somewhere to talk
to Qing-er. The two girls were soon chatting away together, and gradually struck up a
friendship.
   Patience was worried that Grannie Liu’s endless ramblings would wear Xi-feng out,
and presently she took her aside and said:
   ‘Speaking of Her Ladyship, you still haven’t been to call on her. I’ll find someone to
take you over there. It would be a great pity not to see her now that you’re here.’
   Grannie Liu was about to set off, but Xi-feng called her back:
   ‘What’s the great hurry? Sit down, I want to talk to you. Tell me how things have
been at home.’
   Grannie Liu thanked Xi-feng profusely for her kind concern.
   ‘If it weren’t for your help, ma’am,’ she began, pointing at Qing-er, ‘her ma and pa
would have starved to death by now. Life is still hard (how could it be otherwise for
country folk?), but they’ve been able to scrape together an acre or two and put down
a well and grow some vegetables and fruits and gourds. With the money they get
every year for the produce, they manage to keep body and soul together. And what
with the clothes and material you’ve been sending us so regularly these past two
years, ma’am, we’re thought of as among the more comfortably off in our village.
Holy Name! I re?member the day when Qing-er’s father came into town and heard
the news that your family had been raided by the Embroidered Jackets, ma’am.
When he came home and told me, I nearly died of the shock! Then later someone
else told me it wasn’t our side of the family after all - I was so relieved! Afterwards I
heard about Sir Zheng being promoted and was so pleased I wanted to come straight
here to offer my congratulations. But we had so much to do on the land that I
couldn’t get away. And then yesterday I heard that Her Old Ladyship had passed away!
I was bringing in the beans, and I was that shocked I couldn’t go on, I just had to sit
down on the ground and cry my heart out. I said to my son-in-law: “I don’t care what
you say, it may be true or it may just be a rumour, but either way I’m going into town
to find out for myself!” They’re not a bad sort, my daughter and her man, and they
wet their eyes too when they heard the news. So this morning they saw me off and I
left before first light and came here as quick as I could. There was no one to ask on
the way and I couldn’t get any news, so I came straight here to the back gate and
when I saw the door-gods all pasted over with white I got the shock of my life. I tried
finding Mrs Zhou, but there was no sign of her. Then I ran into a young lady who told
me Mrs Zhou was in trouble and had been given the sack. I waited for ages before I
saw someone I knew and was able to come in. I’d no idea you were so sick too,
ma’am!’
   Grannie Liu was in tears. The distressing effect she was having on Xi-feng made
Patience anxious, and she drew her aside before she could say any more:
   ‘Now, Grannie, after all this talking your mouth must be awfully dry. How about a
nice cup of tea?’
   She took her off into one of the maids’ rooms, while Qing-er continued playing in
Qiao-jie’s room.
   ‘I really don’t want any tea,’ protested Grannie Liu. ‘Please, miss, can someone
take me over to Her Ladyship’s now? I’d like to pay my respects and mourn for Her
Old Ladyship.’
   ‘There’s no hurry,’ said Patience. ‘It will be too late for you to leave this evening
anyway. I was afraid you would upset Mrs Lian with all your talking. That’s why I
hurried you out. I hope you won’t take offence.’
   ‘Holy Name! How very thoughtful of you, miss! But how is Mrs Lian ever going to
get better?’
   ‘Does it look serious to you?’ asked Patience.
   ‘Maybe I shouldn’t say this,’ replied Grannie Liu, ‘but to me it looks very nasty.’
   They heard Xi-feng calling and Patience hurried to her bedside. Xi-feng said
nothing further, however, and Patience was just asking Felicity what the trouble was
when they were interrupted by the arrival of Jia Lian. He glanced at the kang where
Xi-feng lay, then without a word stomped into the inner room, uttered a series of
exasperated grunts and sat down. Autumn was the only one to follow him in. She
poured his tea and waited on him attentively, whispering something in his ear. Jia
Lian summoned Patience and asked her:
   ‘Isn’t Mrs Lian taking medicine?’
   ‘What if she isn’t?’
   ‘Oh, how should I know? Bring me the key to the chest.’
   The blackness of his mood was more evident than ever to Patience. She restrained
herself from saying anything in reply, but went out and whispered in Xi-feng’s ear.
Xi-feng was silent. Patience fetched a casket, placed it by Jia Lian’s side and walked
away.
   ‘Where are you off to in such a damned hurry?’ snapped Jia Lian. ‘Aren’t you going
to take the key out for me, now that you’ve dumped the thing there?’
   Patience tried not to react. She opened the casket, took out the key and opened
the chest with it. Then she asked:
   ‘What do you want from it?’
   ‘What have we got in there?’
   Patience finally broke down. Half angrily, half tearfully she begged Jia Lan:
   ‘Please, won’t you tell us what the matter is? It’s not fair to keep us in this dreadful
suspense...
   ‘What is there to say? You’re the ones who caused this trouble in the first place.
Now we owe four or five thousand taels for Grand?mother’s funeral, and Uncle
Zheng has told me to mortgage some family property to raise the money. Do you
imagine we’ve anything left to mortgage? It’s going to look pretty bad if we can’t
meet our debts. I never asked to do this. I shall just have to pawn the things
Grandmother gave me. Well, what’s the matter with you? Don’t you agree?’
   Patience did not say a word, but started taking everything out of the chest.
Crimson came up to her:
   ‘Come quickly! Mrs Lian has been taken bad!’
   Patience hurried in, forgetting Jia Lian entirely, and found Xi-?feng waving her arms
wildly in the air. She tried to hold her down, calling out to her tearfully. Even Jia Lian
now came in to have a look. He stamped his foot and cried:
   ‘This will be the death of me!’
   Tears started to his eyes. Felicity came m:
   ‘You’re wanted outside, sir.’
   Jia Lian checked himself and went out.
   Xi-feng was weakening with every minute, and Felicity and the other maids began
wailing and sobbing. Qiao-jie heard and came running in, followed by Grandmother
Liu, who hurried over to the kang and began muttering prayers to the Buddha and a
lot of other mumbo-jumbo, which appeared to rally Xi-feng’s spirits a little. Presently
Lady Wang arrived, having heard the news from a maid; by this time Xi-feng was
more peaceful; and Lady Wang saw no undue cause for concern. She greeted Grannie
Liu and asked her how long she had been at Rong-guo House. Grannie Liu returned
the greeting and immediately began talking at some length about Xi-?feng’s illness.
After a while Suncloud appeared with a message that her mistress was wanted by Sir
Zheng, whereupon Lady Wang gave Patience a few instructions and left.
   After her bad spell, Xi-feng’s mind seemed to grow clearer. She saw Grannie Liu in
the room once more, and began to feel a growing faith in the efficacy of the old
dame’s prayers. She told Felicity and the others to leave them alone and, calling
Grannie Liu over to the side of her bed, confided to her that she felt very troubled at
heart and was constantly seeing spirits. Grannie Liu replied that in her home village
there was a certain miraculous Bodhisattva, and a certain temple where prayers were
always answered.
    ‘I beseech you to pray for me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If you need money for offerings, I can
provide it for you.’
    She slipped a golden bracelet off her wrist and gave it to Grannie Liu.
    ‘There’s no need of that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘If we country-folk make a vow, we give
a few hundred cash when we get better - no need for anything as grand as this. If I go
and pray for you, that will be your vow, ma’am, and when you’re better you can go
yourself and give what you want.’
    Xi-feng knew that Grannie Liu was sincere, and did not try to press the bracelet on
her.
    ‘My life is in your hands, Grannie!’ she said. ‘My little girl also is pursued by
countless ailments and afflictions. I entrust her to you as well.’
    Grannie Liu readily agreed.
    ‘I really ought to be going if I’m to catch the gates,’ she said. ‘There’s still just time.
In a day or two, when you’re better, you can come and offer thanks.’
    Xi-feng’s soul was beleaguered by the spirits of those she had harmed during her
lifetime, and she was eager for the old lady to go and pray for her:
    ‘Do your best for me. If I can only get some peaceful sleep, I shall be so grateful to
you. You can leave your granddaughter here.’
    ‘But she’s only a country lass, and has no manners,’ protested Grannie Lu. ‘I’m
afraid she’ll only make trouble here. I’d better take her with me.
   ‘Don’t you worry. She is one of the family, it will be quite all right. We may be hard
up, but I think we can feed one extra mouth.’
   Grannie Liu could tell that Xi-feng meant what she said, and for her part she was
only too pleased to let Qing-er stay with the Jias a few days and save a little at home.
The only problem was that Qing-er herself might not be willing. She decided to call
her over and offer her the choice, and soon discovered that the two girls had become
firm friends, that Qiao-jie was most reluctant to let Qing-er go, and that Qing-er
herself was eager to stay. The old lady gave her grandchild a few parting words of
advice, said goodbye to Patience and hurried out, anxious to reach the city gates
before they closed. And there our narrative must leave her.

Green Bower Hermitage was built on Jia family land, and when Prospect Garden was
created for the Visitation, the site of the Hermitage was included within the Garden’s
precincts. But as a religious establishment it had always been self-supporting, and
had never been dependent on Jia family charity. The nuns in residence had reported
Adamantina’s calamity to the authorities and were waiting for them to apprehend
the criminals. Meanwhile, since their community belonged to Adamantina, they
resolved to stay where they were, and informed the Jias to this effect.
   Although the household staff all knew of Adamantina’s disappear?ance, they had
not wanted to trouble Jia Zheng with such a matter at a time when he was in
mourning and had a great deal else on his mind. In fact Xi-chun was the only one of
the family to know about it at first, and was in a state of constant anxiety and
suspense on Adamantina’s behalf. Then the story, or rather two versions of it,
reached Bao-yu’s ears; according to one she had been kidnapped, according to the
other she had succumbed to the temptations of the flesh and eloped of her own free
will with a lover. ‘She must have been kidnapped,’ Bao-yu thought to himself in great
perplexity. ‘A person like her would never have acquiesced in such a thing. She would
rather have died!’ As time went by there was still no news of her whereabouts,
however, and every day Bao-yu sighed sadly to himself, reluctant to believe that
Adamantina of all people, the self-styled ‘Dweller Beyond the Threshold’ of this
world, could have come to so worldly an end. His thoughts ran on to the happier
days they had shared in the Garden and the more troubled times that had followed:
‘Since Ying left home, some of my cousins have died, others have been married.
Somehow I always thought that if there was one absolutely pure and incorruptible
person among us, it was Adamantina. But now this sudden storm of calamity has
blown up out of nowhere, and a death stranger than Dai-yu’s has taken her away!’ As
he pursued this train of thought to its logical conclusion, a line from Zhuang-zi came
into his mind: ‘This life, this insubstantial tissue of vanity, floats like a cloud on the
wind!’ With this he burst into tears, and Aroma, who thought it was another of his
fits, en?deavoured to comfort him with tender words of affection.
   At first Bao-chai could not imagine what had upset him, and she admonished him
in her usual fashion. But when he continued depressed despite her efforts and
remained in an apparent state of trance for days on end, she became greatly
perplexed and eventually, after making persistent enquiries, discovered the truth.
She was herself greatly distressed to learn of Adamantina’s disappearance, but her
concern for Bao-yu tempered her grief, and she rallied him again briskly:
   ‘Look at young Lan now: I’ve heard that he’s been hard at work ever since he
returned from the funeral! He hasn’t been going to school, but day and night he
pores over his books at home on his own. And he’s only Lady Jia’s great-grandson!
You’re her grandson; she had such high hopes for you. And Father worries day and
night about you. And yet you indulge yourself and ruin your health over some trifle,
some silly piece of sentimentality. We depend on you. What will happen to all of us,
if you carry on like this?’
    There was little Bao-yu could say in answer to this. After a long silence he finally
came out with:
    ‘But it’s not a trifle! It’s a tragedy! It’s the decline of our entire family that I’m
lamenting!’
    ‘Listen to you!’ retorted Bao-chai. ‘The one thing Father and Mother want is that
you should do well and be a credit to the family. If you persist in this folly, how can
the family fortunes ever hope to improve?’
    Her words received a most unsympathetic reception from Bao-yu, who proceeded
to lean over the table and doze off. Bao-chai ignored him, and went to bed, telling
Musk and the others to wait on him.
    Bao-yu soon awoke, and noticed how few people were left in the room with him.
    ‘I’ve never had a proper talk with Nightingale since she was transferred to our
apartment,’ he thought to himself. ‘She probably thinks I’ve been very cold. I feel
very bad about it. I can’t treat her like Musk or Ripple - they’re easy to deal with.
Nightingale’s differ?ent. I remember how she kept me company all those times I was
ill -I still have the little mirror she left. She must have felt something for me then, but
somehow whenever we meet now, she’s very distant and cold. Surely it can’t be
because of Chai; she and Dai-yu were the closest of friends, and she always treats
Nightingale kindly too. When I’m not at home, in fact, she and Nightingale often talk
and laugh together. But the moment I walk in, Nightingale leaves the room. It must
be because my wedding took place at the very time when Dai-?yu was dying ... Oh
Nightingale! Nightingale! Surely a clever girl like you can see the anguish that I
suffer!’
   His thoughts ran on:
   ‘This is my chance, while they are all asleep or busy sewing, to find Nightingale and
have a talk with her. I’ll see what she has to say, and if there’s still some way in which
I have caused offence, I can try to make it up with her.’
   He stole quietly out of the room and went in search of Night?ingale.
   She was living in a maid’s room in the west wing. Bao-yu crept up to one of the
windows, and seeing that there was still a light burning inside, used the tip of his
tongue to moisten a spy-hole in the window-paper and peep through. He saw her
sitting idly on her own by the lamp.
   ‘Nightingale!’ he whispered. ‘Are you still awake?’
   Nightingale was startled and sat there stunned for a few moments before asking:
   ‘Who’s there?’
   ‘It’s me!’ replied Bao-yu.
   Nightingale thought she recognized Bao-yu’s voice.
   ‘Is it you, Mr Bao?’
   ‘Yes!’ whispered Bao-yu, to which Nightingale replied:
   ‘What are you doing here?’
   ‘I’ve something private to talk to you about. Let me in and we can sit and have a
chat.’
   After a pause, Nightingale replied:
   ‘What do you want to talk about? It’s getting late. Please go back to your room
now. You can tell me about it in the morning.’
   Bao-yu was very disheartened. If he persisted in his efforts, he was afraid
Nightingale would bar the door to him; on the other hand, if he went back, how
would the emotions that seethed within him find an outlet, emotions that his short
exchange with Nightingale had only served to intensify? He made one last attempt to
talk her round:
   ‘I haven’t a great deal to say. Just one question to ask.’
   ‘Well, if it’s only one question, go ahead.’
   Bao-yu, however, now suddenly found himself quite bereft of the power of speech,
and a long silence ensued. Nightingale, on her side of the window, began to find his
silence worrying. She knew his tendency to have fits, and feared that her brusque
manner might have caused one of his relapses. She stood up and after listening
carefully for a moment, asked:
   ‘Have you gone, or are you still standing there gawping? Why don’t you speak your
mind instead of spending your time driving people to distraction? You’ve already
driven one person to death; do you want to drive another? It’s all so senseless!’
   She peeped back at Bao-yu through the spy-hole. There he was, standing, listening
to her with a trance-like expression on his face. She felt it advisable to say no more,
and walked back and began trimming her lamp. Suddenly she heard Bao-yu sigh:
   ‘Oh Nightingale! You’ve never been as cold as this before! Why have you not had a
single good word for me recently? I know I’m a sorry specimen of humanity, too
impure to merit any real respect. But I still wish you’d tell me what it is that I’ve
done wrong. Then I could endure being shunned by you for the rest of my life. At
least I could die knowing my faults.’
   Nightingale sniffed scornfully.
   ‘Is that all you had to say? Isn’t there anything new? I know all that by heart. I
heard enough of that when Miss Lin was alive. But if I’ve done anything wrong, you
should take your complaints to Her Ladyship. She’s the one who told me to wait on
you. We’re only maids anyway, what do we count for?’
   She started sobbing and snivelling. Bao-yu knew that she was suffering too, and he
stamped his foot in frustration.
   ‘How can you talk like that? After being here all these months, surely you must
know what’s on my mind? And if none of the others will speak for me, won’t you let
me tell you myself? Do you want me to go on bottling it up inside for ever, and choke
to death?’
   He too began sobbing his heart out, when a voice was heard behind him, Saying:
   ‘Who, pray, should speak for you? Why drag others into it? You’ve offended her, so
you jolly well make it up. It’s up to her to decide whether she’ll forgive you. Why put
the blame on nobodies like us?’
   Both Bao-yu on the outside of the window and Nightingale on the inside were
greatly startled by this intruder - who turned out to be Musk. Bao-yu felt most
embarrassed, as Musk continued:
   ‘What is going on here? One grovelling for forgiveness, the other refusing to take
any notice. Come on now, you hurry up and apologize; and as for you, Nightingale,
you’re being altogether too cruel! It’s dreadfully cold out here, and he’s been
pleading with you for ages and not had so much as a breath of a response!’
   She turned to Bao-yu:
   ‘It’s late, and Mrs Bao’s been wondering where you are. To think that you’ve been
here all along, standing out on your own under the eaves! What are you up to?’
   ‘Honestly!’ protested Nightingale from inside. ‘This is ridiculous! I simply asked him
to go away. I told him that whatever he had to talk about could wait till the morning.
What’s the sense in all this?’
   Bao-yu still wanted to speak to Nightingale, but now that they were no longer
alone, he felt too embarrassed to continue. He resigned himself to returning with
Musk, saying as he walked away:
   ‘So be it! I shall never in this lifetime be able to prove my true feelings! Heaven
alone will know the truth!’
   Tears started suddenly to his eyes and rolled in torrents down his cheeks.
   ‘Mr Bao!’ said Musk. ‘Take my advice and put the whole thing out of your mind.
You’re wasting your tears.’
   Bao-yu followed her silently to his room. Bao-chai was lying asleep, or rather, as he
judged, feigning sleep, but Aroma greeted him with a rebuke:
   ‘Couldn’t it have waited till tomorrow? Did you have to go storming out there and
work yourself up into another...’
   Whatever she had been about to Say, she thought better of it, and after a short
pause went on to ask:
  ‘Are you sure you’re not feeling poorly?’
  Bao-yu said nothing, but shook his head. Aroma put him to bed and it goes
without saying that he spent a sleepless night.

*

Nightingale was most distressed by Bao-yu’s visit, and she too lay awake the whole of
that night, weeping and reflecting deeply to herself:
   ‘It seems plain that the family conspired together and tricked him into the wedding
at a time when he was too ill to understand. Then afterwards, when he knew what
he had done, he suffered one of his attacks and that’s why he hasn’t been able to
stop weeping and moping ever since. He’s obviously not the heartless, wicked person
I took him for. Why, today his devotion was so touching, I felt really sorry for him.
What a dreadful pity it is that our Miss Lin never had the fortune to be his bride!
Such unions are clearly determined by fate. Until fate reveals itself, men continue to
indulge in blind passion and fond imaginings; then, when the die is cast and the truth
is known, the fools may remain impervious, but the ones who care deeply, the men
of true sentiment, can only weep bitterly at the futility of their romantic attachments,
at the tragedy of their earthly plight. She is dead and knows nothing; but he still lives,
and there is no end to his suffering and torment. Better by far the destiny of plant or
stone, bereft of knowledge and consciousness, but blessed at least with purity and
peace of mind!’
   These philosophical reflections cooled the feverish turmoil in Nightingale’s mind,
and she was tidying up and preparing to go to bed, when she heard a great rumpus
break out in the direction of Xi-?feng’s apartment to the east. But to discover what
this portended, you must turn to the next chapter.



CHAPTER 114

Wang Xi-feng ends her life’s illusion
and returns to Jinling
Zhen Ying-jia receives the Emperor’s favour
and is summoned to the Palace




It was the middle of the night when Bao-yu and Bao-chai were awoken and informed
that Xi-feng was dying. They rose from bed at once, a maid brought a lighted candle,
and they were on their way out of the courtyard, when another message came from
Lady Wang:
   ‘Mrs Lian’s condition is critical, but she is still alive, and Mr and Mrs Bao should
wait a while. There is something odd about Mrs Lian’s state; from midnight until two
o’clock this morning she wouldn’t stop talking, and we couldn’t make head or tail of
what she was saying. One minute she was demanding a boat, the next a sedan-chair;
then she was “off to Jinling to be entered on the Register”... No one could understand
a word, and she just kept on crying and wailing. There was nothing for it but for Mr
Lian to go and get a paper boat and sedan made for her. He hasn’t come back with
them yet, and Mrs Lian is waiting for him, gasping for breath. Her Ladyship wants you
both to wait and to come after Mrs Lian has finally passed away.’
   ‘How extraordinary!’ exclaimed Bao-yu. ‘What does she want in Jinling?’
   ‘Didn’t you see some registers in a dream once?’ whispered Aroma. ‘Perhaps that’s
where Mrs Lian is going.’
   Bao-yu nodded:
   ‘Yes! If only I hadn’t forgotten what was written in them. Our lives are clearly
preordained by destiny. I wonder where destiny has taken Cousin Lin? What you said
just now, Aroma, about the regis?ters, has set me thinking. If I ever have a dream like
that again, I must be more observant. I may see things and be able to predict the
future.’
   ‘Hark at you!’ retorted Aroma. ‘It’s impossible to have a sensible conversation with
you. You insist on taking a chance remark of mine in deadly earnest. Even supposing
you could see into the future, what good would it do you anyway?’
   ‘It will probably never come to pass,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘But if I ever did know the
future, then at least it would mean an end to all the worries that plague me on your
account.’
   Bao-chai came up to them:
   ‘What are you two talking about?’
   Bao-yu was afraid of being subjected to one of her inquisitions, and merely
replied:
   ‘We were discussing Cousin Feng.’
   ‘There she is dying,’ exclaimed Bao-chai, ‘and you’re discussing her! You accused
me last year of being unduly gloomy and bringing her bad luck; but wasn’t my
interpretation of that oracle the right one after all?’
   Bao-yu thought for a moment, then clapped his hands:
   ‘Of course! Of course you were right! You’re obviously the prophet in the family!
Well, let me consult you myself. What’s in store for me?’
  ‘Off you go on one of your hobbyhorses again!’ Bao-chai chided him with a smile.
‘Mine was simply an off-the-cuff explanation for the wording of the oracle. There’s
really no need to take it seriously. You’re as bad as Xiu-yan. When you lost your jade,
she asked Adamantina to consult the planchette, and the answer was totally
unintelligible to everyone; but that didn’t stop Xiu-yan from talking to me in private
about Adamantina’s amazing powers of clairvoyance, saying how enlightened and
advanced she was in her Zen practice. And yet look at this calamity that’s befallen
Adamantina now - why couldn’t she have predicted that? What sort of clairvoyance is
that supposed to be? Just because I said something once about Cousin Feng, that
doesn’t mean I ever claimed to see into her future, or into my own for that matter.
Claims of that sort are fantastic and don’t deserve to be taken seriously.’
  ‘All right,’ said Bao-yu, ‘let’s drop the subject. Tell me about Xiu?-yan instead.
We’ve been so busy that her wedding seems to have passed us by altogether. That
was an important event for your family, and yet it was celebrated with so little
ceremony. Didn’t you even invite any relatives and friends?’
  ‘You’ve missed the point again,’ replied Bao-chai. ‘My own family’s closest relatives
are the Jias and the Wangs. There’s no one respectable left in the Wang family now,
and the Jias weren’t invited because my mother knew we’d be too busy with
Grandmother’s funeral. Lian lent a hand, and one or two other relations came - but
you wouldn’t know about that, as you weren’t there. If you think about it, things
were much the same for Xiu-yan as they were for me. She was formally engaged to
Cousin Ke, and Mama wanted a stylish wedding. But in the first place, Pan was still in
gaol, so Cousin Ke wanted to keep it simple; then there was Grandmother’s funeral;
and Xiu-yan was having such a hard time at Aunt Xing’s, especially after the
confiscation, when Aunt Xing became stingier than ever. Poor Xiu-yan, she could
hardly bear it. I talked to Mama, and in the end she decided to go ahead and make
do with a simple ceremony. Xiu-?yan seems a lot happier now and she is so good to
Mama, far better than her real daughter-in-law ever was. She’s a wonderful wife to
Ke, and gets on very well with Caltrop. If Ke has to be away for some reason, the two
of them still manage very happily together. They are a bit hard up, but Mama is a
great deal more relaxed than she used to be. She still gets upset about Pan, and he’s
always writing to her from gaol and asking for more money. But luckily Cousin Ke has
been able to collect some of the debts that were owing, and has sent Pan the money
from that. Some of our town properties have had to be mortgaged too. We still have
one house left, and that’s where Mama is planning to move now.’
   ‘What’s the need?’ protested Bao-yu. ‘It’s so much more convenient for you to
have them living close by. If they move so far away, it will be a whole day’s expedition
to visit them.’
   ‘Even when families are as closely related as ours,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it’s really much
better in the long run to be independent. Mama can’t go on for ever living on
charity.’
   Bao-yu was about to expand on the reasons for their not moving when a final
message came from Lady Wang, to say that Xi-feng had passed away, and all the
family had now arrived in her apartment. Would Bao-yu and Bao-chai please join
them there? Bao-yu stamped his foot and seemed about to burst into tears. Bao-chai
too was deeply moved, but controlled herself for fear of upsetting Bao-yu any
further.
   ‘We should keep our tears for later,’ she counselled.
   They both made their way directly to Xi-feng’s room, where they found a weeping
throng gathered. Bao-chai went forward to bedside, where Xi-feng’s body was
already laid out, and gave a great cry of grief. Bao-yu held Jia Lian’s hand and sobbed
loudly, which set Jia Lian off again. Patience, seeing that no one else was capable of
offering any comfort, stepped forward, and tried to mask her own grief and urge
moderation. Sounds of inconsolable weeping con?tinued to fill the room none the
less.
   Jia Lian was in a helpless dither. He sent for Lai Da, and told him to make whatever
preparations were necessary for the funeral. He himself reported Xi-feng’s death to
Jia Zheng and then went to see what other arrangements he could make. But there
were simply no funds; it was an impossible task. Fond memories of Xi-feng brought
tears constantly to his eyes and his distress was made still more acute by the pitiful
sight of Qiao-jie, crying her heart out for her mother. The weeping continued all that
night. At dawn Jia Lian sent a messenger for Xi-feng’s elder brother Wang Ren.
   The death of his older uncle Wang Zi-teng had left Wang Ren free to carry on very
much as he pleased. Zi-sheng, the surviving younger uncle, was too ineffective a
character to control him, and Wang Ren had already by his behaviour succeeded in
causing considerable discord in the family. Now, learning of the death of his younger
sister, he hurried over (with a slightly ill grace) to perform his duty as a bereaved
brother and mourn for her. On his arrival he observed immediately how makeshift
the funeral arrangements were and voiced his indignation in no uncertain terms:
   ‘Years my sister toiled for you, did a fine job of it too. The least you owe her is a
proper funeral. You should be ashamed of your?selves, making such a poor show of
it!’
   Jia Lian had never been on good terms with his brother-in-law, and, when he heard
him blustering on like this, turned a deaf ear. Wang Ren next called Qiao-jie aside.
   ‘My girl,’ he said to her, ‘while your mother was alive, she had one shortcoming:
she was too anxious to please Lady Jia, and as a result she neglected her own family.
But you’re old enough now to make decisions yourself, my dear! Look at me, have I
ever tried to profit from you? Now that your mother is dead, you must look to me
and do as I tell you. Your great-uncle and I are your mother’s family. I know your
father, he’ll go out of his way to bow and scrape to anyone, rather than take any
notice of us. When that fancy woman of his, that Auntie You, died, I wasn’t in town,
but I heard that a lot of money was spent on her. And now he’s scrimping on your
own mother’s funeral. Don’t you think you ought to have a word with him about it,
and make him see sense?’
   ‘Father would like nothing more than to have a nice funeral,’ said Qiao-jie. ‘But
things have changed. We haven’t enough money, so of course we have to be a bit
careful.’
   ‘What about your own things?’ pursued Wang Ren relentlessly. ‘Surely you’ve
something left yourself?’
   ‘It all went in the raid last year,’ said Qiao-jie. ‘I’ve got nothing left at all.’
   ‘Are you trying me on too?’ expostulated Wang Ren. ‘I know that Lady Jia gave
away all sorts of things. You ought to produce your share now.’
   Qiao-jie could not bring herself to admit that her father had already taken her
share and sold it, and so pretended not to understand what he was referring to.
   ‘I know!’ exclaimed Wang. ‘You’re keeping it for your trousseau!’
   Qiao-jie refused to say another word. Wang Ren had already offended her with his
remarks and she began to sob until she was almost choking with emotion.
   ‘If you have anything else to say, sir,’ protested Patience heatedly, ‘please wait until
Mr Lian comes back. Miss Qiao-jie is much too young to understand.’
   ‘As for you, you’ve just been itching for my sister to die, haven’t you!’ sneered
Wang Ren. ‘The lot of you! So you could step into her shoes ... I’m not asking for
much; just a decent funeral. Surely you don’t want to disgrace your own family?’
   He sat himself down in a surly fashion.
   Qiao-jie was feeling very miserable. ‘I know Father does care,’ she was thinking to
herself. ‘And besides, when Mother was alive, Uncle Ren sneaked off with all sorts of
stuff of hers himself, so he’s got no right to complain.’
   In her eyes Wang Ren was rather a despicable sort of person. He for his part
secretly reckoned to himself that Xi-feng must have kept her own private hoard, and
that despite the raid there was bound to be silver somewhere in her apartment - and
a fair amount of it too.
   ‘They probably think I’ve come to sponge, and the girl is trying to protect them.
She won’t be any use to me, the little wretch!’
   He began to conceive an intense dislike for his niece.
   Jia Lian was far too busy trying to rustle up money for the funeral to take in all
these complications. He had delegated the ‘outer’ formalities to Lai Da, but he still
needed a lot of money for the ‘inner’ reception and could not see how he was going
to find it. Patience was aware of his predicament.
   ‘You mustn’t overdo things, sir,’ she urged him. ‘You’ll only make yourself ill.’
   ‘Ill!’ exclaimed Jia Lian, somewhat histrionically. ‘That’s the least of my worries! We
can’t even find the money to get by from day to day, let alone pay for the funeral.
And to make matters worse, now I’ve got this idiot round my neck!’
   ‘There’s really no need to work yourself into such a state, sir,’ said Patience. ‘If
you’ve no money, I’ve a few things that were not taken in the raid. Use them if you
like.’
   ‘What a wonderful stroke of luck!’ thought Jia Lian to himself. He smiled at
Patience:
   ‘That would be a real help. It would save me from having to race around trying to
raise the money. I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.’
   ‘Whatever I have was given me by Mrs Lian in the first place,’ said Patience. ‘So
there’s really no need to pay me back. I just want the funeral to be done properly,
that’s all.’
   Jia Lian accepted Patience’s offer with sincere gratitude, and pawned her
belongings for the funeral expenses. From then on he made a point of discussing
everything with her. Autumn was most put out, and took every opportunity to
mutter complaints:
   ‘Now that Mrs Lian is gone, Patience thinks she can take over. The Master gave me
to Mr Lian; how can Patience think to climb above me?’
   Patience noticed Autumn’s disgruntled attitude, but paid no atten?tion. Jia Lian,
for his part, found Autumn’s resentment (which he observed soon enough) most
objectionable, and whenever anything happened to annoy him he vented his bad
humour on her. Lady Xing criticized him for this, and he felt obliged to restrain
himself. But of this no more.

*

In due course, after Xi-feng’s encoffined corpse had been laid out for ten days, it was
escorted to the temple. Jia Zheng was still in mourning for Grandmother Jia and was
confined to his study during the period of Xi-feng’s funeral. His entourage of literary
gentlemer had gradually deserted him. Only Cheng Ri-xing still called regularly; On
one occasion Jia Zheng was speaking to him on the genera subject of the family’s
decline:
   ‘See how one by one we are dying off! My elder brother and young Zhen are both
in exile. Our finances deteriorate daily. And who knows what has become of our
country estates in the Eastern provinces. Altogether, a disastrous state of affairs!’
   ‘I have been here many years, sir,’ said Cheng, ‘and I have seen for myself how
busy your staff are, enriching themselves at your expense. Every year sees money
draining from your pockets into theirs. It is ruining you. Then there is the money
needed for the families of Sir She and Mr Zhen, and the sizeable debts incurred
besides, and the loss sustained as a result of the recent burglary, which I hardly think
will be recovered. If you wish to put your house in order, sir, the only remedy I
envisage is for you to assemble your staff, and to charge your most trustworthy
steward with a comprehensive investigation of their accounts. In that way you can
judge in which department retrenchment is possible. Deficits should be made good
by the individual steward responsible. That way you will at leas know where you
stand.
   ‘Then there’s the Garden. It is too large for anyone to buy. But it is a shame that a
place with such potential for profit should have been so neglected. During the years
that you have been away, sir, the staff there have been manufacturing all manner of
frightening tales which have had the effect of deterring everyone from entering the
place. All your troubles are, in short, the doing of the servants. You should make a
thorough investigation, and dismiss any unsatisfactory elements among them. It is
the only remedy that makes sense.’
   ‘My dear Cheng,’ replied Jia Zheng, nodding his head gravely ‘you do not seem to
realize: I cannot even trust my own nephew, let alone the servants! And if I myself
were to try to carry out an investigation such as you suggest, I could never hope to
get to the root of the problem. Not that I could engage in such a thing anyway while
still in mourning. Even if I did, I have never paid much attention to household details
in the past, so I really have no idea what we are supposed to have and what we don’t
have. I would no know where to look.’
    ‘You are altogether too charitable and virtuous a man, sir,’ rejoined Cheng. ‘In any
other family of comparable position, even if things had reached this critical state, the
masters would count on being able to stave off disaster for another five or ten years
by asking their stewards for money. I understand that one of your men has even been
appointed to a district magistracy ...’
    ‘No!’ cut in Jia Zheng firmly. ‘When a man stoops to borrowing from his own
servants, it is the beginning of the end. We shall simply have to draw in our belts a
little. If we still own the property that is down on our books, well and good. But
personally I am inclined to believe that there may be very little reality behind some
of those entries.’
    ‘Precisely, sir,’ replied Cheng. ‘That was my very reason for suggesting an
inspection of the accounts.’
   ‘Why, have you heard something?’ asked Jia Zheng.
   ‘Word has reached me of some of the iniquities perpetrated by those servants of
yours,’ answered Cheng. ‘But I hardly dare mention them in your presence, sir.’
   Jia Zheng realized from Cheng’s tone of voice that he was speaking the truth.
   ‘Alas!’ he sighed. ‘Since my grandfather’s day, we have always had a tradition in my
family of being considerate and generous to our servants. We have never treated
them harshly or given them cause for complaint. What is the present generation
coming to! And if I were suddenly to start acting the strict master now, I hardly think I
would be treated seriously.’
   As they were talking, one of the janitors came in and announced that Excellency
Zhen of the Nanking family had come to call.
   ‘What brings him to the capital?’ asked Jia Zheng.
   ‘I understand, sir,’ replied the servant, ‘that he has been reinstated by Imperial
favour.’
   ‘Show him in at once,’ said Jia Zheng.
   The servant went out to usher in the visitor. This Excellency Zhen was the father of
Zhen Bao-yu; his full name was Zhen Ying-jia, his courtesy name You-zhong (Friend of
the Loyal). The Zhens were, it will be remembered, like the Jias, an illustrious old
family from Nanking, and the two families had a long-standing family connection and
had always seen a good deal of each other. Zhen Ying-jia had lost his post a year or
two previously for some misdemeanour, and the family property had subsequently
been confiscated. Now His Majesty the Emperor had shown him a special favour as
the de?scendant of a loyal and deserving subject, had restored him to his hereditary
position and had summoned him to the capital for an audience. Knowing that Lady
Jia had recently passed away, Zhen had prepared an offering and had chosen an
auspicious day in the almanac on which to convey the offering to the temple where
her remains were lying. Before so doing he called at Rong-guo House to pay his
respects.
   Mourning etiquette prevented Jia Zheng from going out to greet his guest, but he
welcomed him at the threshold of his outer study. When Zhen Ying-jia saw him,
sorrow and joy mingled in his breast. Both gentlemen refrained from any elaborate
display of ceremony, and instead clasped each other simply by the hand and
exchanged greetings. They sat down at either side of a table, Jia Zheng offered his
guest some tea and they continued to talk for some little while.
   ‘When were you received by His Majesty?’ asked Jia Zheng.
   ‘The day before yesterday,’ replied Zhen Ying-jia.
   ‘His Majesty in his great kindness must surely have favoured you with some words
of instruction.’
   ‘Yes indeed. His Majesty, whose kindness exceeds the heavens, has favoured me
with a decree.’
   ‘May I enquire as to its import?’
   ‘In view of the recent outbreak of piracy on the South coast, and the unsettled
conditions prevailing among the people there, His Majesty has despatched the Duke
of An-guo on a mission of pacifi?cation against the rebels. Because of my familiarity
with the region, he has ordered me to take part in the campaign. I shall have to leave
almost immediately. When I learned yesterday that Lady Jia had passed away, I
prepared a humble offering of petal-incense to burn before her coffin, as a small
expression of my devotion.’
   Jia Zheng kowtowed his thanks and replied:
   ‘I am sure this enterprise will be an opportunity for you to set His Majesty’s mind
at rest, and to bring peace to the nation. I have no doubt too that it will bring you
great personal glory! I only regret that I shall not be able to witness it with my own
eyes, but will have to content myself with hearing the news of your victories from
afar. The present commander of the Zhenhai littoral is a relation of mine, and I hope
that when you meet him you will receive him favourably.’
   ‘How are you related to the commander?’ asked Zhen Ying-jia.
   ‘During my period of office as Grain Intendant in Kiangsi,’ replied Jia Zheng, ‘I
betrothed my daughter to his son, and they have been married three years now. A
protracted coastal disturbance and the continued concentration of pirates in the
region have prevented news of them from reaching us for quite some time. I am
most concerned for my daughter’s well-being, and earnestly beseech you to visit her,
when your duties are completed and a convenient Opportunity pre?sents itself. In
the meanwhile I shall write her a short letter, and if you would be so kind as to have
it delivered for me by one of your men, I should be eternally grateful.’
   ‘Children are a source of concern to us all,’ rejoined Zhen. ‘I myself was on the
point of asking you a similar favour. When I received my instructions from His
Majesty to proceed to the capital, I decided to bring my family with me; my son is of
a tender age and we have so few servants at home now. I have had to hurry on ahead,
while my family are following at a more leisurely pace and should arrive here any day.
I have been given my marching orders already and cannot delay here any longer.
When my family arrive they are sure to call on you, and I have instructed my son to
kowtow to you in the hope of benefiting from your counsel. Should a suitable offer of
marriage make itself known to you, I should be most grateful if you would make
representations on our behalf.’
   ‘But of course,’ Jia Zheng assured him. After a little more chat, Zhen Ying-jia rose to
take his leave, saying:
   ‘I shall hope to see you tomorrow outside the city.’
   Jia Zheng knew that Zhen must have many other engagements and would not be
prevailed upon to stay. He saw him to the study door, where Jia Lian and Bao-yu were
waiting to escort him out (in the absence of a summons from Jia Zheng they had not
ventured into the study). The two younger men stepped forward to salute him. Zhen
Ying-jia seemed quite stunned by the sight of Bao-yu.
   ‘Take away the white mourning clothes,’ he thought to himself. ‘and this young
man is the very image of our own Bao-yu!’
   ‘It is such a long time since we last met,’ he said politely, ‘that I have quite
forgotten your names.’
   Jia Zheng indicated Jia Lian:
   ‘My elder brother She’s son, Lian.’
   Then pointing to Bao-yu:
   ‘My own second son, Bao-yu.’
   Zhen clapped his hands:
   ‘How extraordinary! I heard tell at home that you had a well-loved son born with a
jade, and that his name was Bao-yu. I was at first greatly surprised that our sons
should share the same name, but later I reflected that such coincidences must be
quite frequent. Now I have seen him in the flesh, I am amazed all over again! He is
the living likeness of my own son! Not only his features, his whole manner and
bearing are the same!’
   On being told Bao-yu’s age, he commented:
   ‘My son is a year younger.’
  Jia Zheng went on to say that he had already gathered a little information about
Zhen Bao-yu from Bao Yong, the former Zhen retainer whom Zhen Ying-jia had
himself recommended to them. Zhen Ying-jia seemed too engrossed in Bao-yu to
enquire after his old servant, but kept exclaiming:
‘Most extraordinary! Most extraordinary!’
   He took Bao-yu by the hand and was most affable towards him. Their conversation
would have been longer had it not been for the fact that the Duke of An-guo was in a
hurry to leave. Zhen did not wish to delay his superior, and himself needed to make
hasty preparations the long journey ahead. He therefore forced himself to say
farewell and made a dignified departure, escorted by Jia Lian and Bao-yu. All way he
was still plying Bao-yu with questions. At last he mounted his carriage and was gone,
and Jia Lian and Bao-yu returned to report Jia Zheng. When they were dismissed Jia
Lian went once more to endeavour to settle the accounts for Xi-feng’s funeral.
   Bao-yu returned to his own room and told Bao-chai of his encounter with Zhen
Ying-jia.
   ‘I never thought I’d have a chance to see that Zhen Bao-yu we are always hearing
about, but now I’ve seen his father, and apparently the son will be coming any day to
call on Father. Excellency Zhen called me the “living likeness of his son”, which I find
hard believe. If this other Bao-yu does come, you must all be sure take a peep at him,
and judge whether there really is a resemblance.’
   ‘Shame on you!’ exclaimed Bao-chai. ‘Honestly, you grow more and more
thoughtless with every day! First you treat us to a story about some young man
who’s supposed to look like you, then you want us to go and “take a peep” at him!
What next!’
   Bao-yu realized that he had said the wrong thing, and blushed. He tried to think of
some way of rectifying his gaffe, but to learn more you will have to turn to the next
chapter.

CHAPTER 115

A private obsession revived confirms
Xi-chun in an ancient vow
A physical likeness verified deprives
Bao-yu of an imagined friend




Before Bao-yu had time to appease Bao-chai, Ripple came in and announced:
‘The Master wishes to see Bao-yu.’
Bao-yu did not wait for any second bidding.
   ‘I want to have a word with you, said Jia Zheng, when he arrived, ‘concerning your
studies. You are still in mourning and it would therefore be improper for you to
attend school; but you can and must revise your compositions. Over the next few
days I shall have some leisure, and I want you to write me a few samples at home. I
shall then be able to judge for myself whether in all this time you have made any
discernible progress.’
   ‘Yes, Father,’ said Bao-yu rather miserably.
   ‘I have instructed your brother Huan and your nephew Lan to revise as well. I
sincerely hope that your work will be better than theirs.’
   ‘Yes, Father.’ Bao-yu dared say nothing more, but stood rooted to the spot.
   ‘Off with you, then.’
   As he withdrew from the study, Bao-yu passed Lai Da and the other stewards
coming in with their registers.
   He was back in his room like a flash, and communicated the substance of his
interview to Bao-chai, who seemed rather pleased to hear it. Bao-yu himself groaned
inwardly, but knew that it would be inadvisable to appear idle and was preparing to
settle down and concentrate, when two nuns from the Convent of the Saviour King
arrived to pay their respects to Bao-chai. She told a maid to bring them tea, but was
otherwise decidedly offhand towards them, while Bao-yu, who would have liked to
talk with the sisters, could tell that Bao-chai found their company distasteful and
therefore refrained. The nuns for their part knew only too well that Bao-chai was
un?sympathetic to their cause, and after sitting for a short time they excused
themselves.
   ‘Won’t you stay a little longer?’ asked Bao-chai somewhat dis?ingenuously.
   ‘We have so many calls to make,’ replied one of them. ‘What with the masses
we’ve been saying at the Temple of the Iron Threshold, we’ve been kept very busy
and haven’t called on Their Ladyships and the young ladies in a very long while. Apart
from your good self, we’ve already been to see Mrs Zhu and Their Ladyships, but we
still have Miss Xi-chun to call on.’
   Bao-chai nodded, and the nuns proceeded to Xi-chun’s apartment. They asked
Landscape, who received them, where her mistress could be found.
   ‘My mistress hasn’t eaten for days,’ exclaimed Landscape, ‘and now she won’t
even get up from her bed.’
   ‘Why? What’s the matter?’
   ‘Oh, it’s a long story. I’m sure she’ll tell you all about it when you see her.’
   Xi-chun had heard them talking as they came in, and sat up at once.
   ‘How are you both?’ she asked. ‘I suppose you’ve stopped visiting us because our
fortunes are so altered …’
   ‘Holy Name!’ came the pious ejaculation. ‘Benefactors are bene?factors, whether
they be rich or poor. Our convent was founded by your family, and we were always
most generously provided for by Her Old Ladyship. We saw Their Ladyships and the
young ladies at Her Old Ladyship’s funeral, but we didn’t see you there, miss, and we
were worried about you. That’s why we’ve come here specially to visit you today.’
   Xi-chun asked after the young nuns at the temple.
   ‘Ever since that scandal,’ was the reply, ‘the gatemen won’t let them so much as
set foot in Rong-guo House.’
   ‘Talking of scandals,’ continued the same nun, ‘is it true, what we heard the other
day, that Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage has run off with a man?’
   ‘What utter nonsense!’ replied Xi-chun. ‘People who tell such tales should beware
of having their tongues cut out in hell! The poor girl was kidnapped by a gang of
ruffians! How can anyone have the heart to spread such malicious gossip!’
  ‘Sister Adamantina was a strange one all the same,’ said the nun. ‘We always
thought she overdid it a bit. Of course, we don’t like to criticize her in front of you,
miss. Who are we when compared with her, after all? Just ordinary, unrefined people;
we chant our liturgy, say our prayers, make intercession for the sins of others, and
hope to earn ourselves a little merit, a little good karma.’
  ‘What does good karma really mean?’ asked Xi-chun earnestly.
  ‘Well, miss, putting aside the truly virtuous families like your own, which have
nothing to fear, of course - other noble ladies and young misses of good family can
never be certain how long their prosperity will last. If calamity once strikes, then
nothing can save them. Nothing, that is, except Our Lady of Mercy: if Our Lady sees a
mortal suffering, her infinite compassion moves her to try to guide that mortal
towards salvation. That is why we all pray to her and say: “Hail, Lady of Mercy,
Bodhisattva of Boundless Compassion and Grace, Deliverer, Saviour, Hail!”
  ‘A nun leads a hard life, it’s true, harder than a young lady in a rich family. But
we’re saved! Even if we can’t hope to become Buddhas or Saints, at least by keeping
up our devotions we may one day in another lifetime be reborn as men. And that
would be sufficient reward in itself. At least then we would escape the endless trials
and silent tribulations of womankind. You are still too young to under?stand, miss;
but let me tell you, when once a young lady leaves home and marries, it is all over
with her. She must spend the rest of her days a slave to her husband’s will.
  ‘In the true religious life; it is sincere devotion that counts. Sister Adamantina
always thought herself so gifted and sensitive, so supe?rior. To her we were always
vulgar mortals. And yet ordinary folk like us can at least earn good simple karma,
while look at this terrible thing that has befallen her.’
   Their words found an all too receptive ear. Uninhibited by the presence of her
maids, Xi-chun poured out the whole story of how badly You-shi had been treating
her, and how she had been made to stay and look after the house, and the disastrous
consequence. She showed them where she had already hacked off a part of her hair.
   ‘You think I’m just another worldling, trapped in the fiery pit of delusion! But
you’re wrong. I’ve been wanting to be a nun for a long time myself. I just haven’t
been able to think of a way of achieving my goal.’
   The nuns feigned alarm:
   ‘Now, miss, don’t you ever say such a thing again! If Mrs Zhen were to hear, she’d
give us the scolding of our lives and have us thrown out of the convent. Why, a young
lady like yourself, bred in such a good family, you’re sure to marry a fine young
gentleman and enjoy a lifetime of luxury and ease ...’
   The colour flew into Xi-chun’s cheeks:
    ‘What makes you think my sister-in-law can have you sent away, and I can’t?’
    The nuns realized from this that she was in earnest, and decided to goad her on a
little further:
    ‘Don’t take offence, miss. But do you honestly believe that Their Ladyships and the
young mistresses would let you have your way? You will only stir up a lot of
unnecessary trouble for yourself. It’s you we’re thinking of.’
    ‘We shall see,’ was Xi-chun’s brief comment.
Landscape thought this augured ill, and gave the nuns a meaningful glance. They
took the hint, and too scared to lead Xi-chun on any further, made their farewells.
Xi-chun did not detain them, but merely smiled scornfully after them and said:
    ‘Don’t imagine yours is the only convent!’
    The nuns thought it wiser not to reply.
    Landscape was worried by this latest turn of events, and fearing that she might be
blamed if anything untoward occurred she crept off to inform You-shi:
    ‘Miss Xi-chun is still set on shaving her head and becoming a nun, ma’am. These
past few days she’s not been ill, she’s been lying at home nursing her grievance.
Perhaps it would be safer to take some precautions. If anything were to happen, we
would be blamed ...’
    ‘She doesn’t really want to leave home and take holy vows,’ said You-shi. ‘She just
thinks she can take advantage of Mr Zhen’s absence to challenge my authority. Well,
so far as I’m concerned, she can go ahead and good luck to her!’
    Landscape continued none the less in her efforts to dissuade Xi-chun from her
drastic course of action. But Xi-chun persisted in her fast, and her only thought now
was to take the final step and cut off what remained of her hair. Landscape could
bear it no longer, and went to tell Ladies Xing and Wang. They tried talking Xi-chun
out of it several times, but their efforts were in vain. She seemed obsessed.
   The two ladies were on the point of going to inform Jia Zheng when one of the
servants outside announced the arrival of Lady Zhen and young Master Zhen Bao-yu.
They hurried out to welcome their guests and escorted Lady Zhen into Lady Wang’s
apartment, where they all sat down, formal greetings were exchanged and polite
conversation was made, details of which we need not record. Lady Wang made a
reference to the supposed resemblance between their two sons, the ‘two jades’, and
expressed a desire to see Zhen Bao-yu for herself. He was sent for at once, but the
answer returned that he was conversing with Sir Zheng in the outer study, and that
they seemed to have struck up an immediate rapport. Bao-yu, Huan and Lan had also
been summoned to take lunch in the study, and Master Zhen would call on Lady
Wang afterwards.
   Presently lunch was served for the ladies.
   Jia Zheng, having witnessed for himself the physical resemblance between this
Zhen Bao-yu and his own son, proceeded to test the young man’s literary and
scholastic abilities and was most impressed by the fluent answers that he gave. He
sent for his own Bao-yu and the other two boys, in order to exhibit to them this
paragon of virtue, as both stimulus and admonition, and in particular to afford
Bao-yu an opportunity for salutary self-comparison.
   Bao-yu answered the summons promptly, and appeared in full mourning-dress,
accompanied by Huan and Lan. When he saw Zhen Bao-yu for the first time, it
seemed to him almost as if he were being reunited with an old friend, and the feeling
of delight was apparently mutual. They bowed to each other, and Huan and Lan
followed suit. Jia Zheng had been sitting on a mat on the floor, and had asked Master
Zhen on arrival to sit at a chair, an invitation that Master Zhen had (very properly)
declined, since his senior was seated at a lower level. Instead he installed himself on
a cushion on the floor. Now that Bao-yu and the other two had joined the company,
it would hardly be right for them to sit on the floor with Jia Zheng; nor on the other
hand could they remain standing while Master Zhen, their contemporary, was seated
below. Jia Zheng resolved the dilemma by standing up himself, and after talking with
them for a few minutes, he instructed the servants to serve lunch.
   ‘I shall have to leave you now,’ he said to Master Zhen. ‘Please excuse me. I hand
you over to the younger generation, who will learn much from you.’
   ‘It is I, sir,’ replied Zhen, with polite modesty, ‘who am most anxious to learn from
these gentlemen.’
   Jia Zheng said a few more words in reply, and then took his leave, politely
preventing his young visitor from accompanying him, but allowing Bao-yu, Jia Huan
and Jia Lan, who had preceded him and were waiting outside the threshold, to escort
him into the inner study. They returned, prayed Master Zhen to be seated again, and
there was a certain amount of conventional chat, with references to this
‘long-awaited and much anticipated meeting’, details of which we need not record
here.
   Jia Bao-yu, on seeing Zhen Bao-yu, had instantly been reminded of their earlier
dream-encounter ‘in the mirror’. From what he knew by report of Zhen Bao-yu, he
felt sure that this jade counterpart of his would be a person after his own heart, and
that he was destined to find in him a true friend. However, since this was their first
‘real’ meeting, and since Huan and Lan were present, he felt the need to be
somewhat discreet, and therefore addressed him in the polite hyper?boles
customary on such occasions:
   ‘Long have I admired you from afar, but alas till now I have been denied the
honour of a personal acquaintance. Today this great bless?ing is mine, and lo, I see
before me a reincarnation of the Great Bard, a second Li Bo!’
   Zhen Bao-yu had also heard a great deal about his namesake, and found that the
reality conformed pretty much to his expectations.
   ‘He seems a passable companion in my studies,’ he thought to himself, ‘but hardly
someone to share my aspirations. And yet he has my name, and looks so like me; we
must be souls linked by some bond at the Rock of Rebirth. I have made some
progress of late in the understanding of Higher Principles, and should therefore seek
to impart to him something of what I have learned. Since this is only our first meeting,
however, and since I am still ignorant where his sympathies lie, I should tread
cautiously.’
   He replied to Jia Bao-yu’s remarks in what he deemed to be a fitting vein:
   ‘Long have I known of your great gifts. I fear that, before a person of such
egregious purity, refinement and grace, I am but an ordinary and foolish mortal, and
that by sharing your name I do but tarnish its lustre.’
   ‘He seems a sympathetic enough character,’ pondered Jia Bao-yu upon hearing this.
‘But why does he flatter me almost as if I were a girl? We are both of us men, and
therefore creatures of impurity.’
   ‘Your praise is alas undeserved,’ he said. ‘I am but a dull and foolish creature, a
mere lump of senseless stone! How can I compare with a person of such quality and
nobility as yourself? It is I who am unworthy of the name that we both bear.’
   ‘When I was young,’ mused Zhen Bao-yu aloud for his new friend’s benefit, ‘I was
blind to my own limitations and entertained ideas far above my station. But then my
family fell on hard times, and we have all spent the past few years in greatly reduced
circumstances. As a result, although I can hardly lay claim to a comprehensive
experience of life’s vicissitudes, I feel I may have acquired some slight knowledge of
the ways of the world, some meagre understanding of human nature. You, on the
other hand, have lived in the lap of luxury all your life, you have lacked for nothing,
and you have, I am sure, been able to achieve great distinction in your literary
compositions and in the study of public affairs, a distinction that has caused your
honourable father to hold you in high esteem, and to view you with great pride and
affection. I say again, you are worthy of the fine name that we both bear.’
   Jia Bao-yu recognized by now the telltale rhetoric of the ‘career worm’ and fell
silent, wondering how best to respond, while Jia Huan for his part began to feel
uncomfortable at having been so entirely excluded from the conversation. Jia Lan,
however, found Zhen Bao-yu’s little sermon most congenial:
   ‘You are altogether too modest, sir. Surely, in the fields of literary composition and
public affairs of which you speak, it is precisely from long experience that true ability
and knowledge are derived. I am of course too young to claim any knowledge of
literary com?position, but a careful perusal of the little that I have read has led me to
the conclusion that external grace and meretricious refinement are of little worth
when compared with the cultivation of a good charac?ter.’
   Jia Bao-yu found his nephew’s remarks nauseatingly priggish, and wondered
where on earth he had picked up this way of speaking. He attempted to forestall a
reply in like vein from Zhen Bao-yu:
   ‘I had always understood from what I had heard of you that you condemned vulgar
and commonplace notions, and had formed your own personal view of the world. I
was so happy to have had this opportunity of meeting you today, and of learning
from you some?thing that would help me transcend this mortal realm we live in and
enter a more spiritual plane. I felt sure that such an encounter would help to cleanse
my heart of worldly desires, and open my eyes to a more profound view of life. Alas,
it is clear from your words that you consider me a coarse creature, and have
therefore treated me out of politeness to this rigmarole of worldly wisdom.’
   Young Zhen reflected:
   ‘Clearly he has heard tales of me as a child, and therefore thinks that I was
speaking out of mere politeness, masking my true nature. I must be frank with him.
Who knows, he may even turn out to be a true friend.’
   ‘I fully appreciate the sincerity of your remarks,’ he began. ‘When I was young, I
too abhorred anything that smacked of the platitude and the cliche. But I grew older,
and when my father resigned from his post and had little further inclination for social
entertaining, the role of host devolved upon me. In the course of my duties I
observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom I met had in one way
or another brought honour and glory to his family name. All their written works or
spoken words were of loyalty and filial piety, their entire lives were devoted to virtue
and truth and were indeed a fitting tribute to the enlightened rule under which we
live and a due token of gratitude for the kind and illuminating instruction bestowed
upon them by their fathers and teachers alike. So gradually I cast off the intractable
theories and foolish passions of my youth. I am still searching for teachers and
friends of a like mind to instruct me and guide me out of my benighted ignorance,
and I consider it a great blessing to have met you. I feel sure that I have much to
learn from you. Believe me, what I said earlier was in earnest.’
   The more Jia Bao-yu heard the more exasperated he felt. For politeness’ sake he
mumbled something ambiguous in reply, and was saved from further embarrassment
by a summons from the inner apartments:
   ‘If the gentlemen have eaten, would Mr Zhen please join the ladies?’
   Bao-yu seized this opportunity, promptly inviting Zhen Bao-yu to lead the way, and
they proceeded to Lady Wang’s apartment, followed by the other boys. Seeing Lady
Zhen seated in the place of honour, Jia Bao-yu paid her his respects, Jia Huan and Jia
Lan followed suit, and Zhen Bao-yu likewise paid his respects to Lady Wang. At last
the two ladies and their two ‘jades’ were face to face. Although Jia Bao-yu was now
married, Lady Zhen was old enough not to have to stand on ceremony on that
account, especially as the connection between their two families was such a
long-standing one. She saw how alike the two of them were, and could not help
warming towards Jia Bao-yu; with Lady Wang it was the same, she took Zhen Bao-yu
by the hand and plied him with questions, finding him rather more mature than her
own son. She glanced at Jia Lan, and reflected to herself that he too cut a fine figure;
though not quite on a level with the two ‘jades’, he could certainly hold his own in
their company. Jia Huan’s uncouth appearance, on the other hand, aroused all her
old antipathy.
   When it became known that both ‘jades’ were present together, all the maids
came to have a look.
   ‘How extraordinary!’ they murmured to one another. ‘It’s one thing for them to
have the same name; but they even look alike - face, build, everything! Luckily our
Bao-yu is dressed in mourning white or we’d never be able to tell them apart!’
   Nightingale in particular seemed momentarily quite stunned. She was thinking of
Dai-yu:
   ‘If only she were still alive! They might have married her to this Bao-yu. I think
she’d have been willing enough...,’
   Even as these thoughts were running through her head, she heard Lady Zhen say:
‘A few days ago, I believe my husband, who now considers our Bao-yu of an age to be
married, asked Sir Zheng to look out for a suitable bride for him.’
   Lady Wang was already much taken with Zhen Bao-yu and without any hesitation
she replied:
   ‘I should be glad to act as a matchmaker for your son. Of our own girls, two have
passed away, and one is already married. Cousin Zhen of Ning-guo House has an
unmarried younger sister, but she is a few years too young for the match. I have
another idea, though. My elder daughter-in-law, a member of the Li family by birth,
has two cousins, both fine good-looking girls. The older of the two is already
betrothed, but the younger is not and would make an excellent bride for your son. I
will make the proposal on your behalf. I ought perhaps to mention that their family
circumstances are somewhat reduced.’
   ‘You are being unnecessarily polite,’ said Lady Zhen. ‘Nowadays, we are nothing to
boast about ourselves. In fact they may consider us beneath them.’
   ‘But your husband has been given this new commission,’ said Lady Wang, ‘and I
feel certain that in the future he will not only be restored to his former prosperity,
but will rise to new heights of glory.’
   Lady Zhen smiled:
   ‘I only hope your predictions come true. Well, in that case, I should be most
grateful if you would propose the match on our behalf.’
   Zhen Bao-yu, on hearing them broach the subject of his betrothal, excused himself
and was escorted by Jia Bao-yu and the other boys back to the study, where they
rejoined Jia Zheng and stood for a while talking. Presently one of the Zhen servants
came to summon Zhen Bao-yu:
   ‘Lady Zhen is leaving now, sir, and requests you to return.’
   Zhen Bao-yu made his farewell, and Jia Zheng instructed Bao-yu, Jia Huan and Jia
Lan to see him out. And there we must leave him.
   Ever since his earlier encounter with Zhen Bao-yu’s father, Jia Bao-yu had been
looking forward impatiently to the arrival of his supposed alter ego, hoping to find in
him a true friend. Now that they had met, he was sorely disillusioned, realizing from
their conversation that the two of them were poles apart, as far removed from each
other as the proverbial ice and coal. He made his way back to his apartment in a
mood of profound depression, said not a word, did not even smile, but stared
vacantly into space.
   ‘Well?’ asked Bao-chai. ‘Is he your “living likeness” then?’
   ‘He certainly looks like me,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘But I could tell from the way he talked
that he was a fool, just another career worm.
   ‘There you go, finding fault again!’ protested Bao-chai. ‘How can you suddenly
know that he’s a career worm?’
   ‘He talked a lot,’ replied Bao-yu, ‘and there was nothing the slight?est bit profound
or illuminating in what he said; he just spouted on at me about “literary composition
and public affairs”, and “loyalty and filial piety”. Isn’t that the way a worm talks? It’s a
shame that he looks like me; now that I know what he’s like, I wish I could look
different ...’
   Bao-chai could see he was on one of his hobbyhorses again:
   ‘The things you say are really laughable! How could you possibly look different?
What’s more, his ideas sound very right and proper to me. A man should want to set
himself up in life and amount to something. Just because you’re so sentimental and
wrapped up in your own feelings, does that mean that everyone else has to be too?
You attack him for being a worm, when it’s really you who have no strength of
character!’
   Bao-yu had found Zhen Bao-yu’s sermon exasperating enough. With Bao-chai’s
diatribe on top of it, he felt himself rapidly sinking into a slough of despond. A
familiar feeling of overwhelming muz?ziness seemed to descend on him, and he
could sense a relapse coming on. He said nothing, but smiled inanely, to the
bewilderment of Bao-chai. She surmised that he was smiling to mask his annoyance
with her harsh words, and therefore decided to ignore him. But for the rest of that
day he remained in the same stupor, refusing to speak even if Aroma or one of the
others deliberately provoked him, and when he rose the next morning he looked
exactly as he had done before his recent convalescence.
   Lady Wang meanwhile had finally concluded that she must inform Jia Zheng of
Xi-chun’s determination to shave her head and take holy vows. You-shi had proved
incapable of dissuading her and it seemed likely that any further opposition to her
will would only drive her to suicide. They were keeping a watch on her day and night,
but this was just a temporary measure. She and her aspirations could not be
contained in this way forever. Jia Zheng sighed and stamped his foot:
   ‘Goodness only knows what Ning-guo House has done to deserve an end like this!’
   He sent for Jia Rong:
   ‘Go and tell your mother that she must make one last determined effort to talk
Xi-chun round. Then if the girl persists in her folly, we will simply have to act as if she
is no longer one of our family.’
   You-shi did as she was instructed, but her efforts had the very opposite effect, and
only elicited more threats of suicide from Xi-chun.
   ‘I’m a girl and you know I can’t stay at home for the rest of life. What if I were to
end up with a marriage like Ying-chun’s? Look at all the heartache she caused her
parents, and Uncle Zheng and Auntie Wang, and then she died... If you love me, think
of me as dead, let me go, let me at least try to make something pure of my life. I
won’t be living away from home anyway, I’ll only be in Green Bower Hermitage,
which is part of the Garden. Adamantina’s women are still living there. That can be
my nunnery. You can look after my needs there. Please let me do this, and I shall
think myself blessed. By continuing to go against me, you will be forcing me to put an
end to my life. If I am allowed to follow my own chosen path, then when my brother
returns I shall tell him plainly that I did it of my own free will. But if I die, he’s sure to
say you drove me to my death.’
    There had always been discord between You-shi and Xi-chun, and besides, You-shi
could see the force of her argument. She went to report to Lady Wang. But Lady
Wang was in Bao-chai’s apartment, where she had just discovered for herself the
recent deterioration in Bao-yu’s condition, and was upbraiding Aroma:
    ‘You are altogether too careless! You should have told me at once when Bao-yu fell
ill!’
    ‘But your Ladyship,’ pleaded Aroma, ‘Bao-yu is often ill--some days he may be
better, then he’s worse again. He’s been visiting you and paying his morning duty
every day and really he’s been quite all right until today, when he seems to have had
a bit of a queer turn. Mrs Bao was going to come over and tell you, only she didn’t
want you to scold us for making a fuss about nothing.’
   This scolding of Aroma’s, and the fear that she and Bao-chai might suffer on his
behalf, seemed to restore Bao-yu temporarily to his senses:
   ‘Don’t worry, Mother. There’s nothing the matter with me. I just feel a bit low.’
   ‘My child, you mustn’t forget you have a tendency to take ill. If only I’d known
earlier, I could have sent for a doctor and had some proper medicine prescribed for
you in time. If you allow yourself to sink into the dreadful state you were in after you
lost your jade, you’ll cause us no end of trouble again!’
   ‘If you’re still worried, Mother,’ said Bao-yu, ‘then by all means send for a doctor
and I’ll take some medicine.’
   Lady Wang accordingly sent a maid to fetch a doctor, and was thus far too
preoccupied with Bao-yu to think of Xi-chun’s pre?dicament. The doctor arrived
presently, examined Bao-yu and made out a prescription, after the administration of
which Lady Wang returned to her own apartment.
   Over the next few days, however, Bao-yu seemed to become more of an imbecile
than ever. He stopped eating completly, and his condition began to cause general
concern. When the time came for the ceremony to mark the end of the formal
mourning period for Grand?mother Jia, and since the family were especially busy at
the temple, Jia Yun was called in to receive Bao-yu’s doctor; and because of the
shortage of men in Jia Lian’s compound, Wang Ren also had to be asked to attend
and help supervise there. Qiao-jie had made herself ill crying day and night for her
mother, and in every respect Rong-guo House presented a picture of sad disarray.
   When the family returned from the service at the temple, Lady Wang went at once
to visit Bao-yu. She found that his condition had greatly deteriorated. He was
unconscious, and the servants were in a helpless panic; some were standing there in
tears, some had already gone to Jia Zheng’s, where they announced:
   ‘The doctor says it’s a waste of time to prescribe any more medi?cine, and we
must be prepared for the worst ...’
   Jia Zheng heaved a bitter sigh and went to inspect for himself. Bao-yu indeed
showed every sign of being at death’s door, and Jia Zheng ordered Jia Lian to make
the necessary preparations. Jia Lian did not dare gainsay him, and reluctantly gave
instructions for Bao?-yu’s last things to be prepared. He was just wondering how they
could possibly raise the money for yet another funeral, when one of the servants
rushed into the room in a state of great agitation, crying:
   ‘Mr Lian! Something terrible! Another disaster!’
   Jia Lian had no notion what the man could be referring to and stared at him
transfixed with fear:
   ‘What is it?’
   ‘There’s a monk at the gate and he says he’s brought back Mr Bao’s lost jade. He
wants ten thousand taels for it…’
   Jia Lian spat in the servant’s face:
   ‘Hng! I thought from the fluster you were in that it was something serious. Didn’t
you hear about that last hoax? And even if this jade were genuine, what good could it
do now, when the boy’s already past hope?’
   ‘That’s what I said myself, sir. But the monk swore that Mr Bao would be cured as
soon as we paid him the money.’
   As he was speaking, another servant rushed in crying:
   ‘The monk’s gone berserk! He’s crashing his way in and none us can stop him!’
   ‘This is unbelievable!’ exclaimed Jia Lian. ‘Send him packing this instant!’
   When he learned what had happened, Jia Zheng was as flummoxed as Jia Lian.
Meanwhile more cries came from within:
   ‘Bao-yu is sinking!’
   Jia Zheng was growing desperate, when he heard the monk’s voice calling:
   ‘If you want the boy to live, just bring me the money!’
   Jia Zheng suddenly thought:
   ‘It was a monk who cured Bao-yu’s earlier illness; perhaps this monk can save him
after all. But if the jade is genuine, how will we ever raise the money for it?’
   After a moment’s reflection, he concluded to himself:
‘Oh well, we can think of that in due course. Let’s cure him first, and bargain later.’
By the time he had reached this decision and despatched a servant with an invitation,
the monk was already on his way, and without so much as a bow or a word of
acknowledgement went striding into Bao-yu’s room. Jia Lian tried to restrain him,
saying:
‘There are ladies in there! A tramp like you can’t go barging in!’
‘Any delay,’ cried the monk, ‘and it may be too late to save him!’
Jia Lian was too flustered to be able to do anything but follow him, calling out in
confusion:
‘Quiet now! Stop your weeping! The monk has arrived!’
He continued calling out like this, but Lady Wang and the others were far too
overwrought by Bao-yu’s condition to pay him any attention. When eventually they
did look round, they were shocked to see the great burly figure of the monk
descending on them, and at the last moment tried unsuccessfully to conceal
themselves, while the monk made straight for the kang on which Bao-yu lay. Bao-chai
withdrew to one side, but Aroma felt she should stay with Lady Wang, who had
remained standing where she was.
‘Ladies, I have brought the jade,’ proclaimed the monk.
He held it up, as he continued:
‘Give me the money, and I can save the lad.’
Shock had utterly incapacitated Lady Wang, and she and the other ladies were
certainly in no fit state to judge the authenticity of the stone exhibited to them.
 ‘Just save him,’ they cried, ‘and the money will be yours!’
The monk laughed.
‘I want it now!’
‘Don’t worry,’ said Lady Wang. ‘You shall have the money with?out fail, even if we
have to pawn everything we have.’
The monk seemed to find this suggestion hysterically funny, and after a good deal of
laughter he held the jade out in one hand, bent down and whispered in Bao-yu’s ear:
‘Bao-yu! Precious Jade! Your Stone has returned!’
No sooner had he spoken than Bao-yu opened his eyes a slit.
‘He lives!’ cried Aroma ecstatically.
  ‘Where is it?’ asked Bao-yu.
The monk placed the jade in Bao-yu’s hand.
At first Bao-yu clutched it tightly, then slowly he turned his hand palm upwards and
brought the Stone up to eye-level. He peered at it closely and exclaimed:
‘Ah! We are reunited at last!’
Everyone began uttering fervent prayers to the Lord Buddha, and even Bao-chai now
seemed oblivious of the monk’s male presence. Jia Lian came across to see what had
happened, and the sight of a revivified Bao-yu brought momentary cheer to his heart
too. Suddenly he slipped out, and without a word the monk raced after him and
overtook him. Jia Lian had no choice but to escort the monk to the reception hall and
then hurry over to inform Jia Zheng; who was enormously relieved by the news, and
sent for the monk straight away, bowing to him and expressing his profound thanks.
The monk returned the salutation and sat down. Jia Lian thought to himself
apprehensively:
  ‘Now he won’t budge till he’s been paid...’
  Jia Zheng scrutinized the monk. It was not, he concluded, one the two he had seen
on the previous occasion.
  ‘From which holy establishment do you hail?’ he enquired. ‘And what pray is your
reverend’s own name in religion? Where did you obtain my son’s stone talisman?
How is it that the sight of it cured him so quickly?’
  The monk greeted this stream of questions with an inscrutable smile:
  ‘Don’t ask me. I have not the slightest idea. Just give me my ten thousand taels,
and we’ll call it a day.’
   Jia Zheng could see he was dealing with rather a brusque sort of fellow, and was
nervous of offending him:
   ‘The money? Why yes, of course you shall have it ...’
   ‘I’d like it now. I’m in a hurry.’
   ‘Please be seated for a moment, while I go in and see whether it is ready.’
   ‘You’d better get a move on.’
   Jia Zheng went in to the others. He said nothing of his interview with the monk but
went straight to the kang where Bao-yu was lying. When Bao-yu saw his father
coming, he tried to raise himself up, but was too weak to do so. Lady Wang held him
down and told him on no account to move, while Bao-yu smiled from where he lay
and handed the jade to his father, with the words:
   ‘You see, Bao-yu has returned!’
   Jia Zheng was aware of the Stone’s reputedly supernatural prop?erties. He glanced
at it and said to Lady Wang:
   ‘Now that Bao-yu has recovered consciousness, how are we to pay the monk?’
   ‘Pawn everything I own!’ replied Lady Wang at once. ‘That should be enough.’
   ‘I hardly think he wants money,’ put in Bao-yu. ‘Do you?’
   Jia Zheng nodded thoughtfully:
   ‘I thought it rather strange, I must say. But he absolutely insists.’
   ‘You must go out and entertain him,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We’ll see what we can do.’
   As Jia Zheng went out, Bao-yu began clamouring for food. First he consumed a
bowl of congee and then he demanded some rice, which the old women even
brought him. But Lady Wang forbade him to eat it.
  ‘It’ll be perfectly all right,’ protested Bao-yu. ‘I’m better now.’
  He leant forwards and promptly tucked into a bowl of rice. His spirits seemed
greatly revived. He wanted to sit up properly, and Musk came forward and supported
him gently. Carried away by her excitement at his recovery she blurted out:
  ‘What a treasure that Stone of yours is! Just seeing it has made you better! Thank
goodness you never managed to smash it to pieces!’
  Her words caused a sudden change to come over Bao-yu’s face. He threw the
Stone aside and slumped back. But to learn if he survived, you must turn to the next
chapter.

CHAPTER 116

Human destinies are revealed in a fairy realm,
and the Stone is restored to its rightful owner
Mortal remains are transported to their terrestrial home,
and duty is discharged by a filial son




Musk’s untimely reference to a sensitive episode from the past sent Bao-yu into a
sudden swoon and he slumped back onto his bed once more. Lady Wang and the
assembled family broke into a fresh bout of wailing and weeping, while Musk herself,
realizing that her thoughtlessness was to blame for this terrible turn (though Lady
Wang had not yet had time to scold her), began to weep and at the same time made
a desperate resolution:
   ‘If Bao-yu dies, I shall take my own life and die with him!’
   Lady Wang could see that this time none of their efforts to rouse Bao-yu was
having any effect, and sent an urgent message to the monk, begging him to come to
the rescue again. But the monk was nowhere to be seen. Jia Zheng had returned
earlier to the hall, only to find that his eccentric guest had vanished into thin air. This
fresh outcry from the inner apartment now reached Jia Zheng’s ears and he hurried
back, to find Bao-yu unconscious again, teeth clenched and with no trace of a pulse.
He felt his chest, and finding it still quite warm, sent in desperation for a doctor, to
attempt resuscitation by forcing down a draught of some kind.
   But Bao-yu’s spirit had already quit its mortal frame. Then that means he was dead,
you say? The exact situation, dear Reader, was as follows: the spirit had flitted in its
incorporeal fashion out to the reception hall, where it saw the jade-bearing monk
and saluted him with a bow. The monk hurriedly rose to his feet, grasped the spirit by
the hand and set off. Bao-yu (spirit) followed, light as a leaf drifting in the breeze.
They made their way out not by the main entrance but by a route he failed to
recognize, and presently they reached an open space, a wilderness, whence in the far
distance he spied a strangely familiar monumental archway. He was on the point of
asking the monk what it was, when a misty female form came gliding towards him.
   ‘What is a beautiful creature like that doing in such a desolate place as this?’
Bao-yu asked himself. ‘She must be some goddess come to earth.’
   He approached her and looked more closely. Her face was as familiar as the
archway had been, but somehow he was unable to remember exactly who she was.
She greeted the monk, and then in an instant vanished from view. In that same
instant Bao-yu knew who it was that she resembled: You San-jie. More puzzled than
ever (for what could she be doing here?), he wanted to question the monk. But
before he could do so, the monk was leading him by the hand on through the
archway. On the lintel of the arch were inscribed in large characters the words:
THE PARADISE OF TRUTH

A couplet in smaller characters ran down on either side:

When Fiction departs and Truth appears,
                     Truth prevails;
Though Not-real was once Real, the Real
                     is never unreal.

  Having negotiated the archway, they presently came to the gate of a palace, above
which ran a horizontal inscription:

Blessing for the Virtuous; Misfortune for the Wicked

whilst the following words were inscribed vertically on the two sides:

Human Wit can ne’er unveil the Mysteries of Time,
Nor closest Kin defy the Stern Decrees of Fate.

  ‘So ...’ thought Bao-yu to himself. ‘It is time I began to learn more about the
operation of fate.’ Even as this thought was passing through his mind, he saw (of all
people) Faithful standing a little way off, beckoning and calling to him.
  ‘All this time and I’m still at home in the Garden!’ he reflected in astonishment.
‘But why is it so changed?’
   He hurried forward to speak to Faithiul, but a second later she too had vanished
and he was left standing there, more perplexed than ever. He continued to advance
towards the place where Faithful had been, and as he did so he observed a range of
buildings on either side of him, and above the entrance to each building a board
proclaiming its name. He felt no great inclination to inspect any of these buildings
closely, but hurried on in quest of Faithful. The entrance beyond the spot where she
had stood was ajar, but he did not dare to enter, thinking he should consult his guide
first. And yet when he turned to find him, the monk had vanished. The buildings all
around him suddenly seemed very grand, and it began to occur to Bao-yu that
perhaps this was not Prospect Garden after all. He stood still and raised his head to
read the words above the doorway immediately in front of him:

AWAKEN FROM LOVE’S FOLLY
The couplet on either side ran:

Smiles of gladness, tears of woe, all are false;
Every lust and every longing stems from folly.

   Bao-yu nodded his head and sighed. He still wanted to enter the doorway and go
in search of Faithful, to ask her what this place was that he had come to. He felt a
growing certainty that he had been here on some previous occasion. Finally he
plucked up the courage to push the door open, and went in. There was no sign
whatsoever of Faithful. It was pitch dark inside and he was about to give in to fear
and retrace his steps when his eyes discerned, looming in the darkness, the shapes of
a dozen large cupboards, their doors appar?ently pushed to but unlocked. A sudden
realization swept over him:
   ‘I know I’ve been somewhere like this before. I remember it now. It was in a dream.
What a blessing this is, to return to the scene of my childhood dream!’
   Somehow in his confusion his original intention of finding Faithful had gone, giving
way to a new and more generalized curiosity about what lay before him. He plucked
up his courage again and opened the door of the first cupboard. Within it he saw a
number of albums, and a thrill of excited delight ran through him.
   ‘People always say that dreams are false,’ he thought to himself. ‘But it seems that
this one was real! How often I’ve wished I could dream that dream of mine again!
And now here I am, and my wish is coming true. I wonder if these are the very
albums I saw?’
   Stretching out his hand he took the top one, and held it in his hand. It bore the
label ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of, Main Register.
   ‘I do remember seeing this,’ he thought to himself. ‘I think I do... If only I could
remember more clearly!’
   He opened it at the first page, and found himself looking at a picture, but one that
was so blurred he could hardly tell what it represented. There followed a few rows of
characters, written in an almost indecipherable hand, among which he could faintly
trace the forms of ‘jade belt’ (dai yu) and ‘greenwood’ (lin).
   ‘Surely that must be a riddle for Cousin Lin?’ he thought to himself, and read on in
earnest. The next line contained the words ‘the gold pin beneath the snow (xue)’.
   ‘Why that’s Bao-chai’s surname!’ he exclaimed aloud.
   He read to the end of the fourth and last line.
   ‘It doesn’t seem to say very much. It’s just a series of riddles on the names Lin
Dai-yu and Xue Bao-chai. There’s nothing very ex?ceptional about that. But some of
the phrases sound rather ominous. I wonder what it’s all supposed to mean?
  ‘Silly me! I’m not really supposed to be here at all,’ he rebuked himself. ‘If I spend
my time daydreaming like this and someone comes, I’ll have wasted my chance to
look through the rest.’
  He continued his inspection of the albums. He did not allow himself time to linger
over the next picture, but went straight to the poem, which ended with the words:

When hare meets tiger, your great dream shall end.

   They brought a sudden burst of illumination:
   ‘What a brilliant prediction! It must refer to the death of my eldest sister. If they
are all as clear as this, I should copy them down and study them carefully. That way I
can find out everything about my sisters and cousins, how long they’re going to live,
whether they will fail or succeed in life, be wealthy or poor. At home I shall have to
keep my knowledge a secret of course. But my inside information will at least save
me a lot of unnecessary worrying ..’
   He looked everywhere for writing implements, but could see neither brush nor
inkstone, and fearing that someone might surprise him, he hurriedly scanned
through the rest of the album. The next leaf bore an impressionistic representation of
a figure flying a kite. He did not feel in the mood to dwell on the pictures but quickly
read the remaining poems in the set of twelve. In some cases he was able to grasp
the hidden meaning at a first reading, others required a moment’s reflection, while
some remained obstinately unintelligible. He committed all of them carefully to
memory none the less. With a sigh he took out the next album, labelled
‘Supplementary Register No. 1’, and began to read. He stopped at the lines:

You chose the player fortune favoured,
Unmindful of your master’s doom.

At first they meant nothing to him. Then he studied the accompanying picture, a
bunch of flowers and a mat painted in the same im?pressionistic style as the
kite-flying girl. Suddenly he burst into tears.(* See Volume I, Appendix.)
   He was about to read further, when he heard a voice saying:
   ‘Daydreaming again! Come now, Cousin Lin wants to see you.’
   The voice was very like Faithful’s, but when he turned to look, to his great
bewilderment there was no one there. Then suddenly he saw Faithful again, standing
outside the doorway and beckoning to him. He ran out after her in delight, but her
shadowy form drifted constantly ahead of him and he was unable to overtake her.
   ‘Dear Faithful! Please wait for me!’ he cried.
   She took no notice but hurried on ahead, while he ran panting after her. Suddenly
another vista loomed in front of him, of high buildings and intricately carved roofs,
among which he could dimly perceive the figures of palace ladies. In his eagerness to
explore this new realm Bao-yu forgot Faithful completely. Wandering in through one
of the gateways, he found himself among all sorts of strange and exotic plants and
flowers, none of which he could identify. One in particular caught his eye, a
herbaceous plant surrounded by a marble balustrade, the tips of its leaves tinged a
faint red.
   ‘What rare plant can that be,’ he wondered, ‘to be accorded such a place of
honour?’
   A gentle breeze had arisen and the plant fluttered its leaves with a long drawn-out
trembling motion. It was small and flowerless, but its delicate charm held Bao-yu’s
heart spellbound and enraptured his soul. He was still staring at it dumbfounded
when a voice beside him spoke:
   ‘Where are you from, you great booby? And what do you think you’re doing
peeping at our Fairy Plant?’
   Startled from his reverie, Bao-yu turned to see a fairy maiden standing at his side.
He bowed and said in reply to her questions:
   ‘I came here to find Faithful. Excuse me if I have clumsily tres?passed on your fairy
domain. Please can you tell me, Sister Fairy, what this place is, and why Faithful said
that Cousin Lin wanted to see me? Please will you explain?’
   ‘Sister this, Cousin that! Such names mean nothing to me!’ replied the fairy. ‘All I
know is that this Fairy Plant is my responsibility, and that it is strictly forbidden for
mortals like you to loiter here. You must leave at once.’
   Bao-yu could not bring himself to obey the fairy’s command.
   ‘Sister Fairy!’ he pleaded once more. ‘If you are in charge of a Fairy Plant, then you
must be a Flower Fairy yourself. Can you tell me: what is so special about this
particular plant?’
   ‘That’s a very long story,’ replied the fairy. ‘Once it grew by the banks of the Magic
River and then it was called the Crimson Pearl Flower. It wilted and began to die, but
was revived and given im?mortal life through the intervention of the Divine
Luminescent Page-in-waiting, who generously watered it with sweet dew. Afterwards
it descended into the world of men to repay its debt with the tears of a lifetime, and
now that this has been done it has returned to its true abode. Fairy Disenchantment
has given me instructions to tend it and to stop the bees and butterflies from
molesting it ...
   Bao-yu still did not understand. He had a growing conviction that this really must
be a Flower Fairy that he had met, and was deter?mined not to let such a rare
opportunity slip through his hands. He asked her politely:
   ‘So you, Sister Fairy, are in charge of this plant. But each of the many other fine
flowers must have its own fairy-in-attendance. I hate to bother you, but I wonder if
you could tell me which fairy is in charge of the Hibiscus?’
   ‘I don’t know. You’ll have to ask my mistress about that.’
   ‘Who is your mistress, pray?’
   ‘My mistress is the River Queen.’
   ‘I knew it!’ exclaimed Bao-yu. ‘That’s my cousin Lin Dai-yu!’
   ‘Stuff and nonsense!’ retorted the by now highly exasperated fairy. ‘May I remind
you again that this is a heavenly realm and the abode of fairies. My mistress may be
called the River Queen, but she is nothing like your earthly queens and consorts.
How could she possibly be related to a mortal? Stop talking such utter nonsense or I
shall have you beaten and thrown out by one of our guards.’
   Bao-yu was struck dumb by the fairy’s words and became painfully conscious of his
own uncleanliness. He was taking his leave when he heard someone hurrying
towards them, calling:
   ‘They’re asking for the Divine Luminescent Page-in-waiting!’
   ‘I know,’ replied the fairy. ‘I was told to look out for him. That’s why I’ve been
waiting here all this time. But I haven’t seen any such Page go by. So what am I to
do?’
   ‘Surely that was him - the one who left just now!’ cried the messenger with a laugh,
and rushed out to waylay Bao-yu.
   ‘Will it please the Divine Luminescent Page-in-waiting to return?’
   Bao-yu thought she must be addressing someone else. He was afraid of being
overtaken and caught, and continued stumbling forwards, in an effort to make good
his escape. When he looked up, he saw before him a formidable figure barring his
way with a large sword:
   ‘Where are you going?’
   Bao-yu was frightened out of his wits, but managed to pluck up enough courage to
take another look. He was astonished, and then somewhat reassured, to find himself
face to face with You San-jie.
   ‘Oh Cousin!’ he begged her. ‘Why are you after me too?’
   ‘You men, you’re all the same!’ was her reply. ‘There’s not a good one in your
entire family. You ruin a girl’s reputation, then you destroy her marriage. Well I’ve got
you now, and you won’t escape me!’
   Bao-yu could tell that she was in deadly earnest and was beginning to panic when
he heard another voice behind him saying:
  ‘Sister! Stop that man at once! He must not be allowed to leave!’
  ‘I have my orders from the River Queen,’ replied San-jie, ‘and I’ve been waiting a
long while for something like this. Now you’re in my grasp, and with one blow of my
sword I shall sever the ties that bind you to the mortal world.’
  Bao-yu was terrified. He could not understand what she was saying, and turned
and fled, only to see that the face from which the voice behind him had issued was
that of Skybright. Joy and sorrow mingled in his heart.
  ‘I’m lost!’ he cried pathetically. ‘I’m all on my own and I seem to have run into the
arms of the enemy. I wanted to escape and go home, but I couldn’t find any of you to
take me back. Now I shall be safe! Dear Skybright, please will you take me home
now?’
  ‘You must not lose heart,’ replied the maiden. ‘I am not Skybright. I have been
specially commissioned by our Queen to escort you into her presence. I will not do
you any harm.’
  Bao-yu was now utterly bewildered:
  ‘You say your Queen sent you; but who is your Queen?’
  ‘Don’t ask now,’ replied Skybright. ‘Soon you will see for yourself.’
  Helplessly Bao-yu followed her, and as they walked he studied her more closely.
She resembled Skybright in every detail.
  ‘Her face, her eyes, her voice are all Skybright’s!’ he reflected to himself. ‘How can
she say she isn’t Skybright? Oh dear, I’m in such a muddle. I’d better take no notice of
what she says. Whatever it is that I’ve done wrong, when I am admitted into the
presence of her Queen, I can ask her to help. Women have kind hearts, after all. She
will surely forgive me.’
   They had now reached a magnificent palace, lavishly and brilliantly appointed in
every respect. In the courtyard before them grew a clump of bright green bamboo,
while by the main doorway stood a row of dark pine-trees. There were several
ladies-in-waiting standing under the eaves, dressed in fine palace robes, and when
they saw Bao-yu come in they began whispering among themselves:
   ‘Is that the Divine Luminescent Page?’
   Bao-yu’s attendant informed them:
   ‘It is, so you’d better hurry in and announce his arrival.’
   One of the ladies beckoned to Bao-yu with a smile, and he followed her in through
several apartments, till finally they arrived at what seemed to be the entrance to the
main hall of the palace. It was hung with a pearl blind. Stopping before this blind, the
lady-in-waiting turned to Bao-yu and said:
   ‘Wait here for your instructions from Her Majesty.’
   Bao-yu did not dare breathe a word, but waited obediently outside the doorway.
Presently the lady-in-waiting returned and announced:
   ‘Will the Page please enter now for his audience?’
   Another attendant began to roll up the pearl blind, and as she did so Bao-yu
caught sight of a regal figure seated within, dressed in richly embroidered robes and
wearing a crown of flowers on her head. Raising his head a fraction to look more
closely, he saw that the Queen did indeed resemble Dai-yu and cried out impulsively:
   ‘Here you are at last, Coz! Oh how I’ve missed you!’
   The lady-in-waiting outside the blind whispered in a shocked tone:
   ‘Ill-mannered Page! Out with you at once!’
   She had barely said this when the other attendant lowered blind again. Bao-yu was
too scared to go in, and yet the thought of leaving was inconceivable. He wanted to
ask one of the other ladies-in-waiting for an explanation, but when he looked round
he realized that they were all of them strangers. They were forcing him out now and
he had no choice but to leave. He thought as a last resort of trying to ask ‘Skybright’,
but when he looked for her she was nowhere to be seen. A deep feeling of confusion
and foreboding descended on him and he dragged himself dejectedly away, this time
without a guide. There was no trace of the way by which he had come and he was
beginning to wonder if he would ever be able to find his way hack, when to his
delight he saw the figure of Xi-feng beckoning to him from beneath the eaves of
another building.
   ‘Thank goodness! I’m home again! How could I have lost my bearings so quickly?’
   He rushed up to her:
   ‘Here you are! They’ve all been so cruel to me, and Cousin Lin wouldn’t see me. I
don’t know why!’
   He was standing right next to Xi-feng. But on closer inspection it turned out not to
be Xi-feng at all but Jia Rong’s first wife, Qin Ke-qing. He hesitated for a moment and
then asked her where Xi-feng had gone. But the lady made no reply and presently
turned and went inside.
   Bao-yu stood there in a daze, not daring to follow her in, but staring blankly before
him.
   ‘What have I done wrong today,’ he sighed, ‘that I should be spurned like this
wherever I turn?’
   Just as he was bursting into tears, a cohort of guards in yellow turbans with whips
in their hands descended upon him.
   ‘Where are you from, and who do you think you are to come sneaking into this
fairy realm? Off with you! Be gone!’
   Bao-yu did not dare say a word, but continued to search for a way out of the place.
In the far distance he spied a crowd of ladies laughing and walking in his direction,
and thought to his relief that he could recognize among them Ying-chun and some of
his other cousins.
   ‘Help!’ he cried. ‘I’m lost! Save me!’
   Even as he shouted, the guards continued relentlessly to push him on from behind,
and he stumbled helplessly forward. Then to his horror he saw that his ‘cousins’ had
been transformed into strange ghoulish monsters and were pursuing him too. His
nerves were at breaking point. Suddenly the monk appeared before him, and shone a
mirror in his face:
   ‘By the order of Her Grace the Imperial Jia Concubine I have come to save you!’
   In a trice the monsters vanished, and Bao-yu was spirited back to the bleak stretch
of wilderness from which he had first entered the fairy domain. He grasped the
monk’s hand:
   ‘You brought me here - that I can remember; and then the next thing I knew you
had vanished and I saw some of my family but they would have nothing to do with
me and in the end they turned into monsters! Was it all a dream, or was it real?
Please, Master, I beg you to tell me the truth.’
   ‘When you first entered this place,’ said the monk, ‘did you steal a look at anything
in particular?’
   Bao-yu thought for a moment:
   ‘If he can whisk me off to a fairy paradise, he must be an Adept himself, so it’s no
use trying to fool him. Besides, I want to know more.’
   He confessed to the monk that he had seen several registers.
   ‘Hark at you!’ exclaimed the monk. ‘You have seen the Registers themselves and
are still blind! Now listen to me carefully: predestined attachments of the human
heart are all of them mere illusion, they are obstacles blocking our spiritual path.
Ponder deeply on what you have experienced. I shall explain it to you further when
we meet again.’
  With that he gave Bao-yu a hefty shove.
  ‘Back you go!’ he cried.
  Bao-yu missed his footing and stumbled forward, calling out in alarm.
  The family were standing by his bedside when suddenly he began to show these
unmistakable signs of life. They called his name, and he opened his eyes, to find
himself lying on his old kang. Before him were Lady Wang, Bao-chai and other
members of his family, their eyes red and swollen with tears. He reflected for a
moment and tried to compose himself.
  ‘So!’ he said to himself. ‘I have visited the land of death, and now I have returned
once more to the living!’
  He lay pondering one by one the experiences of his wandering soul, and as he did
so a glazed look came over his eyes. To his great delight, he found that he could still
remember every detail of his dream, and he chuckled aloud with satisfaction:
   ‘So! So!’
   Lady Wang suspected a recurrence of his old fit and decided that the doctor had
better be summoned again at once. She sent a maid and one of the serving-women
to inform Sir Zheng that Bao-yu had recovered consciousness and that his previous
(and apparently fatal) crisis had only been a temporary mental affliction from which
he now seemed to have recovered. Since he was now obviously on mend, and was
even able to utter a few words, they could safely suspend the funeral arrangements.
Jia Zheng came hurrying in to verify this news for himself.
   ‘Luckless creature,’ he exclaimed. ‘Do you want to frighten us to death?’
   He was weeping despite himself. Heaving a few gusty sighs, went out again and
sent for a doctor to take Bao-yu’s pulses and prescribe a medicine for him.
   Musk, it will be remembered, had only recently been contemplating suicide; but
now that Bao-yu was recovered she set her mind at rest. Lady Wang ordered some
longan soup, and told Bao-yu to drink a few mouthfuls. She was greatly relieved to
see him gradually revive and regain his composure and she did not even scold Musk
for her original blunder, but merely told one of the maids to give the newly recovered
jade to Bao-chai, who was to hang it once more round Bao-yu’s neck.
   ‘I wonder where the monk found it?’ she asked out loud. ‘It seems so strange. One
minute he was demanding his money, the next minute he had disappeared. Do you
imagine he was some sort of Immortal?’
   ‘To judge by the “mysterious” way he came,’ said Bao-chai, ‘and the equally
“mysterious” way in which he left, I should say he never found it at all, but that it was
he who took it in the first place.’
   ‘How could he have taken it from under our very eyes?’ asked Lady Wang.
   ‘If he could bring it back, then he could take it,’ persisted Bao-chai.
   ‘When the jade was lost,’ put in Aroma and Musk, ‘Steward Lin consulted a
word-diviner - we told you about it ma’am, soon after the wedding. The character he
divined was shang meaning “reward”. Do you remember, ma’am?’
   ‘Yes, you’re right,’ said Bao-chai. ‘You said it had something to do with a pawnshop.
But now I can see it was really pointing to the word “monk”, which is contained in the
upper part of the character shang. We were being told by the word-diviner that a
monk had taken it!’
   ‘The monk was a strange enough creature,’ said Lady Wang. ‘When Bao-yu was ill
before, another monk came, I remember, and told us that Bao-yu had a precious
object of his own at home that could cure him. He was referring to the jade. He too
must have known all about its magical properties. It is extraordinary that Bao?-yu
came into the world with the Stone in his mouth! Have you ever heard of such a
thing happening, in the whole of history? Who knows what will become of the Stone
in the end? And who knows what will become of him! It seems to be an inseparable
part of his life, in sickness and health, at his birth and ...’
   She stopped short suddenly and tears started to her eyes. Bao-yu felt in his own
mind that he now knew the answer to her questions only too well. Thinking back, he
understood more clearly the signifi?cance of his visit to the ‘other world’. But he said
nothing, and stored these thoughts silently in his mind.
   It was Xi-chun who spoke next:
   ‘When the jade was lost, we asked Adamantina to consult the planchette on our
behalf. The reply she received from the spirit contained the lines:

             Gone to Greensickness Peak, to lie
             At the foot of an age-old pine.

It ended with:

             Follow me and laugh to see
             Your journey at an end!

   There’s much food for thought contained in those two words “follow me”. The gate
of the Dharma is certainly wide and all-embracing, but somehow I doubt if Cousin
Bao could squeeze through it, whoever he happened to be “following”...’
 Bao-yu sniffed scornfully. Bao-chai noted this reaction of his, and involuntarily she
frowned and stared abstractedly into space.
   ‘Trust you to drag the Buddha into it!’ snapped You-shi. ‘Are you still pining for
your nunnery?’
   Xi-chun smiled caustically.
   ‘Actually, sister-in-law, I have already taken the first step. Long ago I vowed that
meat should never touch my lips again.’
   ‘My child!’ said Lady Wang. ‘In the name of Lord Buddha himself! You must
abandon this foolish idea!’
   Xi-chun was silent.
   During this exchange Bao-yu recalled two lines from one of albums he had seen:

Alas, that daughter of so great a house
By Buddha’s altar lamp should sleep alone.
   He could not refrain from uttering a few sighs. Then he remembered the bunch of
flowers and the mat, and glanced at Aroma. Tears started to his eyes. When the
family saw him behaving in this strange fashion, laughing one minute and crying the
next, they could only think it a symptom of his old fit. None of them knew that their
conversation had sparked off a flash of illumination in Bao-yu’s mind, with the result
that he could now remember word for word every poem from the registers in his
dream. Although he said nothing, in his mind a new resolve was already formed. But
we anticipate.

*

After Bao-yu’s sudden recovery, his spirits improved daily, and with the regular
administration of medicine he continued to make steady progress. Now that his son
was out of danger, Jia Zheng was anxious to proceed with the interment of Lady Jia’s
coffin, which had been resting for a long while in the temple. He himself was still in
mourning and therefore free from official obligations. There was no telling when (or
if) Jia She would be pardoned, so Jia Zheng decided to act on his own initiative and
arrange for his mother’s mortal remains to be transported to the South and given
proper burial there. He sent for Jia Lian to discuss the matter.
   ‘Your proposal is an excellent one, Uncle,’ said Jia Lian. ‘It would be best to
proceed with this important task now. Once the mouning period is over, it may be
harder for you to find the necessary time. Father is not at home, and it would be
presumptuous of me to undertake a task of this nature. My one concern is the cost.
You will require several thousand taels. Our stolen property must I am afraid be
written off as an irretrievable loss.’
   ‘My mind is made up to do this,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘In your father’s absence I sent for
you merely to discuss the best ways and means. You cannot go, since that would
leave no one at home. I am proposing to go myself, and to take several coffins
simultaneously. I will need some assistance, and am thinking of taking young Rong
with me. There will be three coffins altogether, including your wife’s and your cousin
Lin’s. It was your grandmother’s wish that her granddaughter should be buried with
her in the South. As for the money, we shall simply have to borrow a few thousand
taels from some?where.’
   ‘There is little generosity left in the world these days,’ commented Jia Lian bitterly.
‘You are in mourning, Uncle, and Father is in exile. I fear that it may prove impossible
to borrow the money. We shall be obliged to mortgage some of our property.’
   ‘But our residence was granted us by Imperial decree,’ objected Jia Zheng. ‘We are
not free to dispose of it in this way.’
   ‘That is true,’ said Jia Lian. ‘But we have other properties available for mortgage.
They can be redeemed after your period of mourning, and after Father’s return - all
the more so if he is reinstated. Our chief concern is that you may overtax yourself,
embarking on such a strenuous journey at your age.’
   ‘It is a duty I owe your grandmother,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘While I am away, I am
counting on you to be diligent here at home, and keep things firmly under control.’
   ‘You can set your mind at ease on that score,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I shall do my utmost.
As you will be taking several servants with you, that will mean fewer mouths to feed
here, so we should be able to save a little. If you need any help along the way, you
will be travelling close by the official residence of Lai Shang-rong, Steward Lai’s son,
so you can always call on him for assistance.’
   ‘This affair is my responsibility,’ commented Jia Zheng drily. ‘Why should I need his
or anyone else’s assistance?’
   ‘Of course,’ Jia Lian hastily concurred, and withdrew to make his Own financial
calculations.
   Jia Zheng informed Lady Wang of his plans, exhorted her to keep a careful eye on
the household, and selected a day in the almanac auspicious for setting out on his
long journey. Then he made his preparations to leave.
   Bao-yu was now completely restored to health, and Jia Huan an Jia Lan were
earnestly engaged in their studies. Jia Zheng entrusted them all to Jia Lian, reminding
him:
   ‘The state examinations will be held this year. Huan will not be able to compete
because he will still be in mourning for his mother. There is nothing to prevent Lan
from doing so, however, since his mourning period is shorter and will be over by then.
He and Bao-yu should attend together. If they can pass the examination and become
Provincial Graduates, it will help to redeem the family from its present disgrace.’
   Jia Lian hastened to assure him that he would carry out these instructions. Jia
Zheng then addressed the domestics at some length, took ceremonial leave at the
ancestral shrine, and after a few days spent outside the city attending religious
services at the temple, was finally ready to board his barge and set off. Steward Lin
and handful of servants were travelling with him, and a few members of the family
came some of the way to bid him farewell and see him on his way. He did not trouble
any other relatives or friends.
   Now that Bao-yu had been given his orders to attend the next Civil Service
examinations, Lady Wang began to apply more pressure and came constantly to see
how his work was progressing, while Bao-chai and Aroma added their support in the
form of periodic lectures. They observed the daily improvement in his spirits, b
remained quite unaware that a great inner change had been wrought within him,
drawing him in an unprecedented (indeed for him almost perverse) direction. In
addition to his inveterate contempt for worldly success and advancement, he had of
late begun to adopt an attitude of indifference towards the whole gamut of romantic
attachment—in a word, towards love itself. But this radically new departure was
hardly noticed by those around him, and he himself said nothing enlighten them.
   Nightingale was one of the few to detect the early symptoms this inner change,
and she drew her own conclusions. She had just returned from accompanying
Dai-yu’s coffin to the landing-stage, and was sitting in her room brooding and
weeping to herself.
   ‘How cold-hearted Bao-yu is! It doesn’t seem to have upset him in the slightest to
see Miss Lin’s coffin taken away. He didn’t so much as shed a single tear. He could see
me crying my eyes out, and didn’t even try to comfort me, but just stared at me and
smiled. What a deceiver! All those fine things he used to say to us in the past were
just meant to fool us. Thank goodness I’d seen through him the other evening and
didn’t fall for it again! But there’s still one thing I don’t understand. He even seems to
have become cold towards Aroma. I know Mrs Bao has never been a very warm or
close person by nature - so she probably doesn’t mind his change of heart. But what
about Musk and the others, don’t they feel hard done by? They’ve let their feelings
make fools of them and have wasted half their lives over him, only to be forsaken like
this!’
   As she was brooding, she saw Fivey coming towards her.
   ‘You’re not still weeping for Miss Lin, are you?’ asked Fivey, seeing Nightingale’s
tear-stained face. ‘If you want my opinion of Mr Bao, I think it’s high time we forgot
about his reputation, and looked at what he really is. I was always being told how
kind he was, especially towards girls. That’s why my mother tried so hard to get me
into service with him. Since then I’ve waited on him from the beginning of this illness
of his. But now that he’s better, I haven’t had so much as a kind word from him! In
fact he won’t even acknowledge my existence!’
   Nightingale burst out laughing at this comical tale of woe.
   ‘Pshh! Why, hark at you, you little vixen!’ she exclaimed. ‘How do you want Mr Bao
to treat you? Really, you should be ashamed of yourself! When he’s not even
interested in the maids that are closest to him, do you expect him to find time for
you?’
   She laughed again and drew a reproving finger across Fivey’s face.
   ‘What kind of a niche are you carving out for yourself in Bao-yu’s affections?’
   Fivey blushed at her own foolishness. She was on the point of explaining that it
wasn’t so much her own treatment at Bao-yu’s hands that was worrying her as his
whole attitude towards the maids, when they heard someone calling from outside:
  ‘The monk is back! And he’s demanding his ten thousand taels! Her Ladyship
doesn’t know what to do and wanted Mr Lian to go and talk with him, but Mr Lian’s
not at home! The monk is outside, ranting and raving. Her Ladyship wants Mrs Bao to
go over and consult with her.’
  To learn how they placated the monk, please read the next chapter.

CHAPTER 117

Two fair damsels conspire to save the jade, and forestall
a flight from earthly bondage
An infamous rogue takes charge of the mansion, and assembles
a gang of cronies




Lady Wang sent for Bao-chai to consult with her, while Bao-yu, hearing that the monk
was outside, rushed to the front courtyard on his own.
   ‘Where is my Master?’ he shouted.
   Finally, as there was no sign of the monk there, he went outside, where he found
his groom Li Gui barring the monk’s way.
   ‘My mother bids me invite His Reverence in,’ said Bao-yu.
Li Gui relaxed his grip, and the monk went swaggering in. Bao-yu observed at once
the resemblance between this monk and the guide in his dream, and the truth began
to grow clearer in his mind. He bowed:
‘Master, please forgive your disciple for being so slow in welcom?ing you.’
‘I have no desire to be entertained,’ said the monk. ‘I just want my money, and then
I’ll be off.’
This was hardly the way one would have expected a man of great spiritual
attainments to talk, reflected Bao-yu. But then he looked at the monk’s head, which
was covered with scabs, and at his filthy, tattered robe, and thought to himself:
‘There’s an old saying: “The True Sage does not reveal himself, and he who reveals
himself is no True Sage.” I must be careful not to waste this opportunity. I had better
reassure him about the money, and sound him out a little.
‘Father,’ he said, ‘please be patient. My mother is preparing your money at this very
moment. Please be seated and wait a while. May I venture to enquire, Father,
whether you have recently returned from the Land of Illusion?’
‘Illusion, my foot!’ exclaimed the monk. ‘I come whence I come, and I go whither I
go. I came here to return your jade. But let me ask you a question: where did your
jade come from?’
For a minute or so Bao-yu could think of no reply. The monk laughed.
    ‘If you know nothing of your own provenance, why delve into mine?’
    Bao-yu had always been a sensitive and intelligent child, and his recent
illumination had enabled him to penetrate to a certain extent the veil of earthly
vanity and illusion. But he still knew nothing of his own personal ‘history’, and the
monk’s question hit him like a whack on the head.
    ‘I know!’ he exclaimed. ‘It’s not the money you’re after. It’s my jade. I’ll give you
that back instead.’
    ‘And so you should!’ chuckled the monk.
    Without a word, Bao-yu ran into the house. He reached his apart?ment and,
finding that Bao-chai, Aroma and the others had all gone out to wait on his mother,
he quickly picked up his jade from where it lay by his bed and ran back with it. As he
left the room, he collided with Aroma, giving her the fright of her life.
    ‘Her Ladyship was just saying what a good idea it was,’ she protested, ‘for you to sit
and keep the monk company, while she tried to work out a way of raising the money.
What on earth have you come rushing in here for again?’
    ‘I want you to go back at once,’ ordered Bao-yu, ‘and tell Mother she needn’t
bother about the money. I shall give him back the jade. That will settle the bill.’
    Aroma seized Bao-yu at once:
    ‘That’s completely crazy! The jade is your very life! If he takes that away, you’ll fall
ill again for sure.’
    ‘Not now,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘I shall never fall ill again. Now that I know my true
purpose, what do I need the jade for?’
   He shook Aroma off and made to leave. She hurried after him, crying:
   ‘Come back! There’s something else I want to tell you!’
   Bao-yu glanced back at her:
   ‘There’s nothing more to be said.’
   She pressed after him, casting aside her inhibitions and crying as she ran:
   ‘Don’t you remember the last time you lost it, how it was nearly the end of me?
You’ve only just got it back, and if he takes it away again now it will cost you your life
and me mine too! You’ll be sending me to my death.’
   She caught up with him as she was speaking, and held him tightly.
   ‘Whether it means your death or not,’ said Bao-yu with strange vehemence, ‘I shall
still give it back.’
   He pushed Aroma away with all his might and tried to extricate himself from her
grip. She, however, wound the ends of his sash around her hands and sank to the
ground, sobbing and calling for help.
   The maids in the inner apartments heard the noise and came running out, to find
the two of them locked in this desperate im?passe.
   ‘Quickly!’ cried Aroma. ‘Go and tell Her Ladyship! Master Bao wants to give his
jade back to the monk!’
   The maids flew to Lady Wang with this message, while Bao-yu grew angrier than
ever and tried to wrench his sash from Aroma’s hands. She held on for dear life, and
Nightingale came rushing out from the inner apartment as soon as she heard what
Bao-yu was contemplating. Her alarm and concern seemed if anything greater than
Aroma’s, and her previous resolution to be indifferent towards Bao-yu seemed to
have vanished without trace. She joined forces with Aroma, and Bao-yu, though a
man against women, and though he flailed and struggled for all he was worth, could
do nothing in the face of their desperate refusal to let go. Unable to set himself free,
he could only sigh and say:
   ‘Will you fight like this to preserve a piece of jade? What would you do if I left
you?’
   These words produced a noisy outburst of sobbing from Aroma and Nightingale.
   Things had reached this impasse when Lady Wang and Bao-chai hurried onto the
scene. Now Lady Wang could verify the truth of the report with her own eyes.
   ‘Bao-yu!’ she cried, her voice choking with sobs. ‘Have you taken leave of your
senses again?’
   Bao-yu knew that with the arrival of his mother he no longer stood any chance of
escape - and therefore changed his tactics.
   ‘There was really no need for you to alarm yourself so, Mother,’ he said, with a
placatory smile. ‘They always make such a fuss about nothing. I thought the monk
was being most unreasonable, insisting on being paid every penny of ten thousand
taels. It made me very cross and I came in here with the idea of handing him back the
jade and at the same time pretending that it was a fake and worthless to us anyway.
If I could convince him that it was of no real value to us, then he would probably
accept whatever reward we offered him.’
   ‘Goodness! I thought you were in earnest!’ exclaimed Lady Wang. ‘I must Say, you
might have told them the truth--look at the state they’re all in!’
   ‘It may seem a good idea to do as Bao-yu suggests,’ said Bao-chai. ‘But I still think
it would be risky even to go through the motions of giving it back. If you ask me,
there’s something most peculiar about that monk. He could very easily do something
terrible and throw the whole family into confusion all over again. We can always sell
my jewellery if we need to raise the money.’
   ‘Yes,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Let’s try that first.’
   Bao-yu made no comment. Bao-chai came up to him and took the jade from his
hand.
   ‘There is no need for you to go,’ she said. ‘Mother and I can give him the money.’
   ‘Very well then, I won’t give him the jade,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But I must at least see him
this once.’
   Aroma and Nightingale were still loath to allow him out of their sight. In the end it
was Bao-chai who ordered them to set him free:
   ‘He’d better go if he wants to.’
   Reluctantly Aroma complied.
   ‘You all of you seem to value the jade more highly than its owner!’ said Bao-yu
with a wry smile. ‘What if I go away with the monk and leave you with the jade?
You’ll look rather silly then, won’t you?’
   This revived Aroma’s anxiety, and she would have seized hold of him again had she
not felt constrained by the presence of Lady Wang and Bao-chai and by the need to
preserve some semblance of respect towards Bao-yu. It was too late anyway, for the
moment they loosened their grip Bao-yu was gone. Aroma contented herself with
despatching a junior maid to the inner gate with instructions for Tealeaf and Bao-yu’s
other page-boys to keep an eye on him, as he was ‘acting rather strangely’. The maid
went at once to do her bidding.
   Lady Wang and Bao-chai meanwhile walked in to Bao-yu’s apart?ment and sat
down. They asked Aroma exactly what had happened and she gave them a full
account of all that Bao-yu had said. They were both extremely perturbed and sent
another messenger with instructions that the servants were to watch Bao-yu and do
their utmost to hear what the monk said. A short while later, a junior maid returned
to report to Lady Wang:
   ‘Master Bao is acting very strangely, madam. The pages outside say that since you
would not give him the jade, he now feels obliged to offer himself in its place.’
   ‘Gracious!’ exclaimed Lady Wang. ‘And whatever did the monk say to that?’
   ‘He said he wanted the jade, not the man,’ replied the maid.
   ‘Not the money?’ asked Bao-chai.
   ‘They didn’t even mention that. Afterwards the monk and Master Bao started
talking and laughing together. There was a lot said that the pages couldn’t follow.’
   ‘The little idiots!’ complained Lady Wang. ‘Even if they couldn’t understand it
themselves, they could at least repeat it to us. Go and tell them to come here.’
   The maid sped to do Lady Wang’s bidding. Presently Tealeaf arrived, stood outside
in the covered walk and paid his respects through the intervening window.
   ‘Surely,’ said Lady Wang, ‘if you couldn’t understand the meaning of what Master
Bao and the monk were saying, you could at least manage to repeat the words to us.’
   ‘All we caught, ma’am,’ answered Tealeaf, ‘was something about a Great Fable
Mountain and a Greensickness Peak. And then some?thing about a Land of Illusion
and “severing earthly ties”.’
  To Lady Wang this made as little sense as it had to the pages; but it seemed to
have a startling effect on Bao-chai, who stared dumb?founded in front of her.
  They were about to send someone to bring Bao-yu back, when in he came himself,
wreathed in smiles, announcing:
  ‘All is well! All is well!’
  Bao-chai stared at him in dismay, while Lady Wang asked:
  ‘What have you been raving to that monk about now?’
  ‘It was anything but raving. It was a very serious conversation. It turns out that he
knows me, and that all he really wanted was to see me. He never wanted the money.
At the most he was hoping for a friendly contribution, which would create good
karma. As soon as we had reached an understanding, he got up and went. Just like
that. So I think you’ll agree, all is well!’
Lady Wang could not believe this, and asked Tealeaf, who was still standing on the
other side of the window, to verify Bao-yu’s story. He hurried out to question the
gateman, and returned presently to report:
  ‘It is true. The monk really has left. As he was going he said: “Their Ladyships are
not to worry themselves. I never wanted the money.” He says he only wants Master
Bao-yu to call on him when?ever he can. “Let all be fulfilled in accordance with
karma; a fixed purpose resides in all things.” Those were his parting words.’
  ‘So he was a holy man after all!’ exclaimed Lady Wang. ‘Did anyone ask him where
he lived?’
  ‘According to the gateman, the monk said that Master Bao would know where to
find him.’
   Lady Wang turned to Bao-yu:
   ‘Well - where does he live?’
   Bao-yu smiled enigmatically:
   ‘His abode is, well... far away and yet at the same time close at hand. It all depends
how you look at it.’
   ‘For goodness’ sake!’ interrupted Bao-chai impatiently, before he had finished
speaking. ‘Pull yourself together and stop all this non?sense! You know how Mother
and Father love you! And Father has told you how important it is for you to succeed
in life!’
   ‘Does what I am talking about not count as success?’ asked Bao-yu in a droll tone.
‘Haven’t you heard the saying: “When one son becomes a monk, the souls of seven
generations of ancestors go to Heaven”?’
   When she heard this Lady Wang was more distressed than ever:
   ‘Our family is doomed! Xi-chun talks of nothing but her nunnery, and now here’s
another! Why should I bother to drag my life out any longer!’
She began sobbing hysterically. Bao-chai tried to comfort her, but Bao-yu only
laughed and said:
   ‘I was joking! There was no need to take it so seriously, Mother.’
   Lady Wang ceased her tears:
   ‘How can you joke about such a thing?’
   At this juncture a maid came in to report the return of Jia Lian:
   ‘He looks very upset too, ma’am. He would like you to go over and have a word
with him.’
   This was another shock for Lady Wang.
   ‘Ask him just this once if he can come here. Mrs Bao is his cousin, so he needn’t
worry about her being here too.’
   Jia Lian duly came in and paid his respects to Lady Wang. Bao-chai also greeted
him.
   ‘I have just received a letter from Father,’ said Jia Lian, ‘saying that he has fallen
seriously ill. I must go to him at once, or it may be too late!’
   Tears were streaming down his cheeks.
   ‘Did the letter say what kind of illness?’ asked Lady Wang.
   ‘It began as a cold but has developed into pneumonia, which has now reached a
critical stage. A special messenger travelled by day and night to bring us the news,
and says that if I delay my departure for even a day or two it may be too late. I must
leave as soon as possible. I am concerned that with Uncle away in the South there
will be no one left to take charge of things here. You will have to make do with young
Qiang and Yun; whatever their shortcomings, at least they are men and can
communicate with you about anything that may crop up outside. There’s nothing
much to worry about in my apartment. Autumn spends her time crying and
complaining and says she wants to leave, so I have told her family to come and take
her away. That will make life a little more bearable for Patience at any rate. There is
no one to look after Qiao-jie, I know, but Patience is not too bad with her. Qiao-jie is
quite a sensible girl, but has an even more difficult temperament than her mother, so
I hope you will try to offer her guidance whenever you can, Aunt.’
   As he spoke, a telltale red came into his eyes and he extracted a little silk
handkerchief from the betel-nut bag at his waist and dabbed them with it.
   ‘With her own grandmother so close at hand, what need is there for you to entrust
her to me?’ asked Lady Wang.
   ‘If you adopt that attitude, I might as well beat myself to death!’ said Jia Lian to his
aunt in a somewhat histrionic sotto voce. ‘I won’t say any more, just beg you to be
kind to me and do what you can.’
   He knelt at her feet.
   ‘Get up at once!’ exclaimed Lady Wang. Her eyes too were moist with tears. ‘What
way is this for aunt and nephew to talk to one another? There is one thing we should
discuss. The child is of age now. If anything untoward should happen to your father
and you should be delayed, and if in the meantime a suitable family should make a
proposal of marriage, do you wish me to wait for your return, or shall I let her
grandmother decide in your absence?’
   ‘Of course you need not wait for me. As you and Mother will be here, the two of
you should do whatever you think best.’
   ‘You had better go now,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Write your Uncle Zheng a note. Tell him
that your father is in a precarious state of health, and that there are no menfolk left
at home. Ask him to complete your grandmother’s burial rites and come home as
quickly as possible.’
   ‘Very well, Aunt.’
   As he was on the point of leaving, Jia Lian turned back once more and said:
   ‘There should be enough servants in the house. But there is no one in the Garden.
The place is altogether too deserted, especially now that Bao Yong has gone back
with the Zhens and Cousin Ke and Aunt Xue have moved out of their old compound
next to the Garden to live in an apartment of their own. All the buildings in the
Garden are empty and have been neglected. You should send someone round
regularly to inspect the place. Green Bower Her?mitage is a family foundation, and
now that Adamantina has dis?appeared something must be done about her various
attendants. The Sister Superior does not feel she can make the decision herself, and
would like someone in the family to take charge.’
   ‘That will have to wait,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘With our own affairs in such disarray,
we are in no position to start taking on extra responsibilities. You must on no account
mention this to Xi-chun. It would only encourage her in her own ideas. Oh dear, what
are we coming to? A nun in the family would be the last straw!’
   ‘That is something I would not have brought up myself,’ said Jia Lian. ‘But since you
have done so, I should perhaps offer my advice, for what it’s worth. Xi-chun belongs
after all to the Ning-guo side of the family. Neither of her parents is alive, her elder
brother has been sent into exile, and she and her sister-in-law are on bad terms with
one another. I hear that she has threatened suicide quite a few times. If her heart is
really set on being a nun and we continue to be so inflexible, she may really take her
own life. And then we would lose her altogether!’
Lady Wang nodded:
   ‘It is too heavy a burden to lay on my shoulders! This really isn’t my responsibility. I
must leave it to her sister-in-law to decide.’
   Jia Lian said a few more words and took his leave. He summoned the servants and
gave them their instructions. Then he wrote a letter to Jia Zheng, and packed his bags.
Patience urged him at some length to take good care of himself, while Qiao-jie
seemed exceed?ingly upset by her father’s departure. Jia Lian expressed his wish to
entrust her to the care of her uncle Wang Ren, but she wouldn’t consider it; and
when she learned that Jia Yun and Jia Qiang were to be on outside duty she also felt
extremely uneasy, though she said nothing. She bade her father farewell, and
resolved to lead a quiet life at home with Patience.
   Felicity and Crimson had been frequently absent since Xi-feng’s death, on some
Occasions asking for leave, on others pleading sickness. Patience had contemplated
asking a young lady from some other branch of the Jia family to come and stay with
them, partly to keep Qiao-jie company, partly to help educate her, but the only
names that occurred to her were those of Xi-luan and Si-jie, Grand?mother Jia’s
favourites, and of these two Xi-luan had recently married while Si-jie was engaged
and due to leave home any day.
   Jia Yun and Jia Qiang saw Jia Lian off and then went in to report to Ladies Xing and
Wang. The two men took turns on night-duty in the outer study, and during the
daytime enjoyed themselves with the servants, throwing parties and inviting a
variety of friends, who took it in turns with them to act as host. There was even some
serious gambling. The ladies of course had no inkling of this.
   One day Lady Xing’s brother Xing De-quan and Wang Ren dropped by. Learning
that Yun and Qiang were now established at Rong-guo House, and observing the
good times that were being had, they began to call quite frequently, to ‘see how
things were getting on’, and had soon formed a regular drinking and gambling
foursome in the outer study. All the decent servants had accompanied either Jia
Zheng or Jia Lian, and the only menservants left behind were the various sons and
nephews of stewards Lai and Lin, who were used to the easy life their parents’ good
fortune had brought them, and were quite ignorant of the principles according to
which a proper household should be run. With their parents away, they were like
colts let loose in the meadow. And with the two degenerate young masters to spur
them on, their pleasures knew no bounds. Under this new regime, the family motto
might as well have been: Anything Goes.
   Jia Qiang thought of inviting Bao-yu to join them, but Jia Yun soon squashed that
idea:
   ‘That fellow is an absolute killjoy. It would only be asking for trouble. A year or two
ago I had a perfect marriage lined up for him. The girl’s father was a tax-collector in
one of the provinces, the family owned several pawnshops, and the girl herself was
an absolute peach. I went to a lot of trouble and wrote him a long letter about it, but
I might as well have saved myself the bother. He’s an utter spoil?sport.
   Yun glanced round to make sure there was no one else listening and continued:
   ‘The truth was, he already fancied this new missis of his! And then there was Miss
Lin, you must have heard about that. She died of a broken heart, it’s common
knowledge. And it was all his fault. But that’s another story. To each his fate in love, I
suppose. All the same, I don’t see why he had to get so angry with me, and start
cutting me dead. Perhaps he thought I was trying to get into his good books or
something.’
   Jia Qiang nodded and gave up the idea of inviting Bao-yu. What neither of them
knew was that, ever since his meeting with the monk, Bao-yu was finally resolved to
sever his ties with the world. In his mother’s presence he still tried to behave as
normally as possible, but there was already a marked cooling-off in his relations with
Bao-chai and Aroma. The maids were unaware of this change and continued to tease
him as before, only to find themselves totally ignored. He was completely oblivious of
practical household affairs; and as for his studies, whenever his mother and Bao-chai
chivvied him on, he would feign diligence, but in reality his mind was filled with
thoughts of the monk and his mysterious excursion to the fairy domain. Everyone
around him now seemed unbearably mundane, and he began to find his own family
environment less and less congenial. When he was free of other commitments, it was
Xi-chun that he chose as a companion. The two of them found they had more and
more in common, and their lively conversations further strength?ened his own
resolution. He had little time now for Jia Huan and Jia Lan.
   Jia Huan, now that his father was away from home and his mother Aunt Zhao dead,
and since Lady Wang paid little attention to what he did, began to gravitate towards
Jia Yun and his cronies. Suncloud, who constantly tried to dissuade him from this
course, received nothing but abuse for her pains. Silver observed to herself that
Bao-?yu was becoming more deranged than ever, and asked her mother if she could
be taken out of service. Bao-yu and Jia Huan in their different ways succeeded in
alienating the people around them. Jia Lan, by contrast, sat by his mother’s side
conscientiously studying, and when he had finished a composition would take it to
the family school for the Preceptor’s comments. Recently the Preceptor had been
bedridden a great deal of the time, and consequently Jia Lan had been obliged to
work on his own. His mother had always been fond of peace and quiet, and apart
from calling on Lady Wang and Bao-chai she did not get about much but sat at home
and watched Jia Lan at his work. So although life continued in Rong-guo House,
everyone was very much minding his own business, which left Jia Huan, Jia Qiang and
company free to indulge themselves unmolested. They were soon pawning or selling
all manner of family property in order to subsidize their disgraceful activities. Jia
Huan was the worst. His whoring and gambling knew no bounds.
   One day Xing De-quan and Wang Ren had called and were in the outer study
drinking. They were in high spirits and decided to send for some singsong girls to
entertain them with a song or two and join in their carousing.
   ‘This is turning into a downright orgy!’ protested Jia Qiang playfully. ‘I suggest we
have a drinking game to raise the tone a little.’
   Everyone agreed that this was a good idea.
   ‘Let’s play Pass the Goblet, on the word “moon”,’ proposed Jia Qiang. ‘I shall say a
line and count it out, and whoever gets the word moon” has to drink and then recite
two lines - a Head and a Tail -according to my instructions. The forfeit is three big
cups.’
   Everyone agreed to his rules. First Jia Qiang drank a cup as MC, and then he recited
Li Bo’s line:
   ‘“The Peacock Goblets fly, the drunken moon...”’ The ‘moon’ fell on Jia Huan.
   ‘For the Head, give me a line with Cassia,’ said Jia Qiang.
   Jia Huan came up with a line by the Tang poet Wang Jian: “‘A cold dew silently
soaks the Cassia flowers ...’
   ‘And Fragrance for the Tail,’ concluded Jia Qiang.
   Jia Huan obliged with a line by another Tang poet, Song Zhi?-wen:
   ‘“Beyond the clouds there wafts a heavenly Fragrance ...”’
   ‘Boring! Boring!’ complained Xing De-quan. ‘Stop posing, Huan, me old fellow! Fat
lot you know about poetry! This is no fun at all, it’s enough to make you sick! Let’s
drop it and play Guess-fingers instead. Loser to drink and sing a song, a double
sconce. Anyone who can’t sing can tell a joke instead. But it better be a good one.’
   They all agreed to this new proposal and there was a noisy scene as they began to
throw out fingers and make their calls. Wang Ren was the first loser. He drank and
sang a song.
   ‘Bravo!’ they cried and set to again. Next to lose was one of the girls. She sang a
song called ‘Little Miss Glamorous’. Then it was Xing De-quan. Everyone wanted a
song from him, but he protested that he was tone-deaf:
   ‘I’ll tell a joke instead.’
   ‘If nobody laughs,’ Jia Qiang warned him, ‘you’ll have to pay another forfeit.’
   Xing downed his cup and began his story:
   ‘Ladies and gentlemen: once upon a time, in a certain village, there were two
temples - a big one, dedicated to the Great Lord of the North, and by its side a
smaller one, dedicated to the Village God. The Great Lord was always inviting the
Village God over for a chat. One day something was stolen from his temple, and he
asked the Village God to look into the matter. “But there are no thieves in this
district,” protested the lesser deity. “It must be carelessness on the part of one of
your door-gods. Someone must have sneaked in past them and stolen these things.”
“Nonsense!” replied the Great Lord. “You’re in charge round these parts. If there’s
been a theft, then you’re responsible. What’s the meaning of this? You should be
trying to catch the thief, not accusing my door-gods of being careless!” “What I
meant by careless,” prevaricated the Village God, “was that your temple must have
been badly sited - you know, the Dragon Lines must be at fault…” “I had no idea you
could read fengshui,” commented the Great Lord in a tone of disbelief. “Allow me to
take a look for you,” offered the Village God, “and see what I can see.” He walked
around the temple, peering into every nook and cranny, and after a while reported:
“My Lord, behind your throne there is a double-leaved red door. An unfortunate
oversight. Personally I have a good solid brick wall behind my throne, so naturally I
never have things stolen. You can easily remedy the present situation by having a
wall built in place of the door.” This seemed plausible to the Great Lord, and he
instructed his door-gods to call in builders and put up a wall. “But we can’t even
afford a single candle or stick of incense in this temple!” moaned the door-gods.
“How can we possibly buy bricks and mortar and hire the labour to build a wall?” The
Great Lord could think of no solution. He ordered them to find one, but they were
stumped too. Just then the Tortoise General, whose re?cumbent stone form lay at
the Great Lord’s feet, stood up and said: “You’re a useless lot! I’ve got an idea: pull
down the red door, and use my belly to block up the doorway. I’m sure that will do
the job perfectly well.” “An excellent plan!” cried the door-gods in chorus.
“Convenient, dependable and free!” So the Tortoise General became Rear Wall, and
peace prevailed - for a while. Then things began to disappear from the temple again.
The door-gods summoned the Village God and complained: “You guaranteed our
security if we built a wall, but look what’s happened! We’ve got a wall and still we re
losing things!” “Your wall can’t be solid enough.” “Have a look at it for yourself,” they
insisted. The Village God went and did so. It certainly seemed a solid enough wall. All
most puzzling. Then he felt it with his hand. “Aaah!” he exclaimed. “No wonder! I
meant a properly built wall. Any old thief could push down this false wall (jia qiang).”‘
   They all laughed, even Jia Qiang, whose name had provided the raw material for
the joke.
   ‘Come on, Dumbo!’ he protested. ‘Be fair! I never called you names! Drink a forfeit,
there’s a boy!’
   Dumbo, who was already a sheet or so in the wind, willingly complied. They all had
a few more cups, and in the general state of intoxication Dumbo let fly a few barbed
remarks about his sister (Lady Xing), while Wang Ren had a go at desecrating the
memory of his (Xi-feng), both of them evincing great bitterness. Their example and
the wine lent Jia Huan a little courage, and he too had his fling, complaining how
heartless Xi-feng had been, and how she had tried to ruin so many of their lives.
   ‘Yes, people ought to show a bit of common decency,’ they all agreed. ‘The way
she used Lady Jia’s influence to bully everyone was dreadful. Well, she died without
giving birth to an heir; she only ever had a daughter. Retribution in her own lifetime!’
   Jia Yun, who remembered only too well how harsh Xi-feng had once been towards
him, and how Qiao-jie had started bawling the instant she set eyes on him, allowed
himself to wade into the general melee with some abuse of his own about the two of
them. Jia Qiang tried to steer the party in a less vindictive direction:
   ‘Come on! Drink up! This gossip will get us nowhere!’
   ‘How old is the young lady you mentioned?’ enquired the two Singsong girls. ‘Is
she pretty?’
   ‘Oh yes,’ replied Jia Qiang. ‘Extremely so. She’s about thirteen.’
   ‘What a pity, in that case, that she was born into a family like yours!’ the girls
exclaimed. ‘If only she came from a more humble home, she could soon find herself
in a position to bring all her family lots of jobs, and pots of money into the bargain!’

  ‘What do you mean?’
  ‘We know of a certain Mongol prince,’ replied the girls. ‘Quite a ladies’ man he is.
He is looking for a concubine, and the lady who fits the bill would be able to take her
whole family along with her to live in the palace. What a marvellous stroke of luck
that would be for somebody!’
  None of them seemed to take much notice of this, except for Wang Ren, who
looked very thoughtful. For the present he said nothing and continued drinking.
   A little later two young lads came in, younger sons of Stewards Lai and Lin.
   ‘You seem to be having a fine time of it, sirs, by the looks of things!’ they
exclaimed.
   Everyone rose to greet them.
   ‘Why have the two of you been such a long time? We’ve been expecting you for
ages.’
   They explained:
   ‘Early this morning we heard rather a disturbing rumour that out family was in
some sort of official trouble again, so we hurried out to see what news we could
glean at the Palace. It turned out to have nothing to do with our family after all.’
   ‘In that case, why didn’t you come straight here afterwards?’
   ‘It wasn’t exactly our family, but it was connected with us. It was that Mr Jia Yu-cun.
When we were at the Palace we saw him bound in chains. They told us he was being
taken to the High Court for questioning. We knew he was a frequent visitor here, and
were afraid that the case might somehow involve us, so we followed them to see
what happened.’
   ‘Good thinking, my man!’ exclaimed Jia Yun. ‘We are most obliged to you. Sit down
and have a drink, and then tell us all about it.’
   The two sat down after a polite show of reluctance, and as they drank continued:
   ‘This Mr Yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow, and knows how to pull strings.
He’d done extremely well until recently, in fact; but greed was his downfall. There
were several charges brought against him, “avarice” and “extortion” being two of
them. As we all know, our present August Sovereign is exceptionally wise,
com?passionate and benevolent. There is one thing that stirs his wrath, however, and
that is corruption, any form of tyrannical or bullying behaviour. So His Majesty
decreed that the offender in this case should be arrested and brought to trial. If he is
found guilty, things will look pretty grim for him; if he is acquitted, then the men who
brought the charges will be in for trouble. It is certainly comforting to think what just
times we live in! For those lucky enough to be officials in the first place!’
   ‘Like your elder brother,’ said one of the company, referring to Steward Lai’s eldest
son, Lai Shang-rong. ‘He’s a county magistrate. Done very nicely for himself.’
   ‘True enough,’ replied young Lai. ‘But his conduct still leaves a lot to be desired,
I’m afraid. He may not last long at this rate.’
   ‘Has he been taking squeeze himself?’
   Lai nodded and drained his cup.
   ‘What other news did you pick up at the Palace?’ they asked them.
   ‘Oh, nothing much. A number of criminals from the coast have apparently been
arrested, and sent to the High Court. During their trial they revealed the
whereabouts of several others of their kind, lying low here in the capital, watching
and waiting for fresh op?portunities for crime. Fortunately the present civil and
military authorities have such a sound grip on the situation, and are so dedicated to
the service of the throne, that these criminal elements will be effectively controlled.’
   ‘If you’ve heard of such cases, perhaps you have news of our burglary?’ asked one
of the party.
   ‘I’m afraid not,’ came the reply. ‘I heard something about a man from one of the
inland provinces who got into trouble here in town for abducting a girl and running
off with her to the coast. She put up a fight and he ended by killing her. They arrested
him crossing the border, and executed him on the spot.’
   ‘Wasn’t Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage abducted in similar
circumstances?’ put in one of the others. ‘Couldn’t it have been her?’
   ‘Bound to have been!’ muttered Jia Huan.
   ‘How could you know?’ they asked him.
   ‘She was a sickening creature!’ said Jia Huan. ‘Always giving herself airs and graces.
She had only to set eyes on Bao-yu to get a big smile all over her face. But she
wouldn’t so much as acknowledge my existence! I hope it is her!’
   ‘Plenty of people are kidnapped all the time,’ someone commented. ‘It could easily
have been someone else.’
   ‘I can well believe it was her,’ said Jia Yun. ‘The day before yesterday I heard that
one of the sisters at the Hermitage had a dream in which she saw Adamantina being
killed.’
   This was greeted with derision:
   ‘You can’t take dreams seriously!’
   ‘Dream or no dream, it’s all one to me,’ protested Dumbo. ‘Let’s get on with the
real business of the evening, shall we? Eat up, every?one, and we can start tonight’s
Big Game.’
   This met with general approval, and as soon as they had finished their meal they
began gambling in earnest. They were still at it well after midnight, when suddenly
they heard a great commotion coming from the inner apartments. They were
eventually informed that Xi-chun had been arguing with You-shi, and the upshot of it
was that she had cut all her hair off and gone running to Ladies Xing and Wang. There
she kowtowed and begged them to relent and let her have her wish. If they would
not, she threatened to put an end to her life there and then. The two ladies were at
their wits’ end, and sent for Jia Qiang and Jia Yun to intervene. Jia Yun however knew
that this was something Xi-chun had resolved to do long ago, at least since the fateful
night of the burglary when she had been left in charge of the house, and to him there
seemed little hope in trying to dissuade her now. He talked it over with Jia Qiang:
   ‘Lady Wang says she wants us to intervene, but I don’t see how we can achieve
anything. It’s a heavy responsibility, and they want to off-load it onto us. We’ll have
to put on a show of talking Xi-chun out of her decision, and then, when she refuses
to listen, we’ll have to pass the matter back to the ladies, and meanwhile write a
letter to Uncle Lian, absolving ourselves from any blame.’
   They both agreed on this strategy, called on Ladies Xing and Wang, and then went
through the motions of trying to dissuade Xi-?chun, who was every bit as adamant as
they had predicted. If she could not take refuge in a convent outside the family
mansion, then she said she would make do with a couple of quiet rooms within it, in
which to recite her sutras and say her prayers. Eventually You-shi could see that the
aunts were not prepared to take the responsibility; her own feat that Xi-chun might
commit suicide got the better of her and she forced herself to compromise.
   ‘I can see I shall have to take the blame. Very well then. Let them say that it was I
who could not tolerate my own husband’s sister and drove her to a nunnery! What
do I care! But I cannot allow her to leave home. That is out of the question. She will
have to stay here. Aunts Xing and Wang, I call you to witness my decision. Qiang, you
had better write a letter informing my husband and Cousin Lian of what has
happened.’
  Jia Qiang acquiesced in You-shi’s decision. But to know whether Lady Xing and
Lady Wang did likewise, you will have to turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 118

Provoked by a rankling antipathy, Uncle and Cousin
plot the ruin of an innocent maid
Alarmed by riddling utterances, Wife and Concubine
remonstrate with their idiot master




Lady Xing and Lady Wang judged from You-shi’s words that the situation was
irretrievable.
   ‘If our niece wishes to become a nun,’ said Lady Wang, in a tone of resignation,
‘then it must have been decreed in some earlier life. This is evidently her karma, and
there is nothing we can do to prevent it. But none the less, it would look very bad for
a girl from a family such as ours to enter a nunnery. That really is unthinkable.’
   She turned to Xi-chim:
   ‘Your sister-in-law has given you her permission, and we can only lend our
approval to hers. But I must ask you not to shave your head. What matters is your
state of mind, not your hair-style. After all, Adamantina never shaved hers. Talking of
which, I simply cannot understand that dreadful business! How could she have
succumbed to temptation so easily? Anyway, if your mind is really and truly made up,
then we shall simply have to consider your present apart?ment your hermitage. Your
maids and servants had better be sent for, and we can give them a choice. Those who
wish to stay on with you can do so, and we’ll find husbands for the others.’
   Xi-chun stopped crying at last, and bowed gratefully to Ladies Xing and Wang, Li
Wan, You-shi and the others present.
   Lady Wang now addressed Landscape and Xi-chun’s other maids:
   ‘Which of you wishes to enter the religious life with your mistress?’
   ‘We will do whatever you command, ma’am,’ was their response.
   Lady Wang could tell that they were none of them genuinely willing and tried to
think who else would be suitable to wait on Xi?-chun in her new life. Aroma was
standing behind Bao-yu, fully expecting this decision of Xi-chun’s to move him to
tears and provoke one of his fits, but to her surprise and considerable distress, he
merely sighed with admiration and exclaimed:
   ‘What a rare resolve!’
   Bao-chai made no comment. But she was constantly on the look?out for telltale
signs to help her gauge her husband’s innermost feelings and intentions, and could
not help but weep at this further evidence (so she thought) of his deluded mind.
   Lady Wang was about to summon all the other maids and question them, when
Nightingale suddenly came forward and fell to her knees:
   ‘Have you decided yet, ma’am, who would be most suitable to wait on Miss
Xi-chun?’
   ‘I have no intention of forcing anyone,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘Whoever is willing
must speak up.’
   ‘Miss Xi-chun has chosen a religious life,’ said Nightingale. ‘But none of her maids,
or so it seems, shares this aspiration of hers. I have something I should like to say,
ma’am. It’s not that I wish Miss Xi-?chun to be parted from her maids. But aspirations
differ. I served Miss Lin for a long time, and as you know, ma’am, she treated me with
a kindness that I shall never be able to repay. When she died, my one wish was to
follow her to the grave; but because she was not a member of this family, and
because I also owe so much to all of you, it was hard for me to take that step. Now
that Miss Xi-chun wishes to become a nun, I beg Your Ladyships to let me go with her
and devote the rest of my days to serving her. If Your Ladyships will only grant me this
wish, my life will not have been in vain!’
   When Nightingale had finished speaking, and before either Lady Xing or Lady
Wang could reply, Bao-yu, who at the initial mention of Dai-yu’s name had begun to
show ominous signs of being dis?tressed and tearful, suddenly gave a loud laugh and
came forward:
   ‘I have no business saying this, I know, but since you were so good as to send
Nightingale to work in my apartment, Mother, I hope you will forgive me for speaking
my mind. Please grant her this request, and allow her to carry out this fine resolution
of hers.’
   ‘If it were any of your other cousins leaving home to get married,’ replied Lady
Wang, ‘you would be crying your heart out. But now, when Xi-chun says she wants to
leave home and become a nun, so far from trying to dissuade her, you actually praise
her for it. I’m afraid I completely fail to understand what’s going on in your mind.’
   ‘First let me know whether this matter is settled,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Has Xi-chun
definitely made up her mind? And has she definitely received your permission? If so,
if it is real, then there is something further I should like to tell you, Mother. But if it is
still not settled, I shall keep what I know to myself.’
    ‘What a peculiar way to talk!’ exclaimed Xi-chun. ‘If I were not in earnest, do you
honestly think I would have been able to convince my aunts? I feel the same way as
Nightingale: if they will let me do as I wish, I shall count myself blessed; if they will
not, I should rather die than continue living my present life! So, there’s nothing to
fear. Whatever you have to say, just go ahead and say it.’
    ‘If I do tell you this, it’s hardly divulging a secret,’ said Bao-yu, ‘since it refers to
something already predestined. I want you all to listen while I recite a poem.’
    ‘Honestly!’ they chided him. ‘At a moment like this, with real people really
suffering, all you can think about is poetry! It’s sick?ening!’
    ‘It’s not something of my own. It’s a poem I once saw somewhere. I’d like you to
listen to it.’
    ‘Oh very well. Hurry up then. Enough of your prattling!’
    Bao-yu did not try to explain himself any further, hut began to recite:


‘When you see through the spring scene’s transient state,
A nun’s black habit shall replace your own.
Alas, that daughter of so great a house
By Buddha’s altar lamp should sleep alone!’

  Li Wan and Bao-chai both cried out in alarm:
  ‘Lord save us! He’s bewitched!’
  Lady Wang shook her head and sighed:
    ‘Bao-yu, where on earth did you see this poem?’
    Bao-yu was reluctant to say any more, and replied:
    ‘Please don’t ask, Mother. Just take my word for it.
    As the meaning of the poem gradually sank in, Lady Wang began sobbing again:
    ‘You said you were joking the other day, when you talked of becoming a monk
yourself. And now this poem all of a sudden! Enough! I understand. What am I to do?
There is nothing I can do, but let you go your own ways. If only you could have waited
till I was dead and gone! Then you could all have done as you pleased!’
    Bao-chai tried to console her, but was in no fit state to do so. The pain she herself
felt was like a knife-wound piercing her heart, and eventually she broke down and
burst into tears. Aroma was faint with weeping and had to be supported by Ripple.
Bao-yu did not shed a single tear, nor did he try to offer them any solace. He
maintained a total silence. Jia Lan and Jia Huan had already left, and it fell to Li Wan
to do what she could to save the situation:
  ‘I’m sure it’s simply that Bao-yu is too upset by this decision of Xi-chun’s to know
what he is saying. We should not take it seriously. Nightingale must receive an answer,
though; we must let her stand up. Is she to be granted her request or not?’
  ‘What difference does it make?’ replied Lady Wang. ‘Her mind is clearly made up in
any case, and when a person’s mind is made up there’s no stopping them. No doubt
Bao-yu will tell us that this decision of Nightingale’s is predestined too.’
  Nightingale kowtowed, and Xi-chun thanked Lady Wang. Nightingale also
kowtowed to Bao-yu and Bao-chai.
  ‘Amida Buddha!’ exclaimed Bao-yu piously. ‘How noble! How rare! I never thought
that you would be the first of us to be saved!’
  Bao-chai’s self-control failed her again, and Aroma, heedless of Lady Wang’s
presence, burst out sobbing and cried:
  ‘I want to go with Miss Xi-chun too, and spend the rest of my life in prayer!’
  Bao-yu smiled:
  ‘Yours is also a fine aspiration. But alas, a life of seclusion has not been decreed
you by fate.’
  ‘Then I would rather die!’ sobbed Aroma.
  Despite his new-found detachment, Bao-yu could not help being moved by this
declaration. But he said nothing.
  It was already three o’clock in the morning, and he suggested to his mother that
she should retire for the night. Li Wan went back to her apartment, and Landscape
escorted Xi-chun to her room, where she continued to wait on her for the time being.
Husbands were eventually found for each of Xi-chun’s maids, and Nightingale spent
the rest of her days faithfully serving her. But we anticipate.

*

Jia Zheng, meanwhile, was on his way south with Grandmother Jia’s coffin, and had
run into an army convoy returning to the capital after the victorious completion of a
campaign. The canal was hope?lessly congested with military transport boats, and
the delay made Jia Zheng extremely fretful. His one consolation was an encounter
with an official from the Coastal Defence Yamen, who informed him that the
Commandant, Tan-chun’s father-in-law, had been recalled to the capital. Tan-chun
would now be able to visit home, although there was no indication when she would
be travelling.
   Another consequence of the delay was that Jia Zheng found himself running short
of cash. He was obliged to write a letter and have it delivered to the yamen of
Steward Lai’s son, Lai Shang-rong, who happened to be a mandarin in the vicinity,
asking him for a loan of five hundred silver taels. The servant entrusted with this
mission was told to bring the money and overtake Jia Zheng further along the canal.
   A few days and a dozen or so li later, the servant reappeared and came on board
the boat with Lai Shang-rong’s reply. The letter was full of tales of woe of one sort or
another, and enclosed fifty taels of silver. Jia Zhen was furious, and without a
moment’s hesitation ordered the servant to return:
   ‘Take him back his money this instant! And he can have his letter too! Tell him not
to bother!’
   The poor servant did as he was ordered and returned to Lai’s yamen. Lai,
perturbed at having both his letter and his paltry offering returned, and knowing that
he had behaved meanly, made up another package, this time enclosing an additional
hundred taels, and begged the servant to take it back with him to Jia Zheng. But
despite Lai’s pleas and blandishments, the man absolutely refused, and returned to
the boat empty-handed.
   Lai Shang-rong was most apprehensive about the consequences of this episode,
and immediately wrote to his father at Rong-guo House, advising him to take some
leave and if possible to buy his way out of service. When Steward Lai received his
son’s letter, he asked Jia Qiang and Jia Yun to plead with Lady Wang for his release. Jia
Qiang knew quite well that it would be futile even to try; he let a day go by and then
gave a false report that Lady Wang had refused his request. So Lai took a few days’
leave, and meanwhile sent a mes?senger to his son’s yamen, advising him also to
plead sick and re?linquish his official post. Lady Wang knew nothing whatsoever
about all these goings-on.

*

Jia Yun was most disappointed to hear Jia Qiang turn down Lai’s request. It (or, rather,
the commission it might have brought) had seemed his last chance of recouping the
enormous gambling losses he had incurred over the past several days. His only other
hope was to apply to Jia Huan for a loan. But Jia Huan was in no position to act as his
creditor, having himself never had a penny of his own, and having already
squandered his mother’s savings. If Yun failed to raise a loan, he did however
succeed in stirring Jia Huan to fresh thoughts of revenge. Memories of Xi-feng’s
cruelty still rankled in Jia Huan’s mind; and with Jia Lian away, he was more than
ready to vent some of his spleen on Qiao-jie. The loan-seeking Jia Yun seemed an
ideal accomplice.
   ‘You’re not a boy any longer, Yun!’ he grumbled provocatively. ‘Why come asking
for a loan from a pauper like me when there’s a chance of making a nice little profit?’
   ‘Tell us another!’ replied Yun. ‘We’ve just been having a bit of a lark. I never saw
any chances for profit passing us by.’
   ‘What was that a day or two ago about a Mongol prince wanting to buy himself a
concubine? Why not talk it over with Dumbo, and offer the prince Qiao-jie?’
   ‘This may make you cross when I say it, Uncle Huan,’ replied Jia Yun. ‘But I’d better
say it all the same. Supposing the prince did buy a concubine from our family, he’d
probably never want anything more to do with us afterwards.’
   In response to this, Jia Huan whispered something in Jia Yun’s ear and Yun nodded
casually, judging the proposal to be a passing whim of Huan’s and not worthy of
serious consideration. At that very moment Wang Ren happened along.
   ‘What are you two plotting?’ he asked. ‘Trying to keep me in the dark, are you?’
   Jia Yun communicated to him, sotto voce, the substance of Jia Huan’s scheme, and
Wang Ren clapped his hands enthusiasti?cally.
   ‘Bravo! A capital idea! Lucrative too! But can you really pull it off? If you’ve the
guts to go through with it, I’ll back you up. Don’t forget I’m her uncle. It’s my decision,
after all. You just put the plan to Lady Xing, Huan, old chap, while I have a word with
Dumbo. If the aunts start asking questions, we must be sure to back each other up
with the same story.’
   When this conference was over, Wang Ren went to find Dumbo, while Jia Yun went
to impart the good news to Ladies Xing and Wang, adding many an enticing
embellishment. Lady Wang made a note of the proposal, but was somewhat sceptical.
Lady Xing on the other hand, when she heard that her brother knew, seemed in
favour of the idea and sent for Dumbo to supply her with more details. Dumbo had
already been briefed by Wang Ren (and had needless to say been offered his cut in
the profits from the enterprise), and therefore when summoned to his sister’s
apartment he knew what to say:
   ‘This prince is a very important man. Of course, what you’re being asked to
consent to is not for her to become a proper wife exactly; but as soon as she goes to
him I can guarantee that brother-in-law will get his job back and the family as a
whole recover a bit of its old pull.’
   Lady Xing had no real mind of her own. She was taken in by Dumbo’s story and
invited Wang Ren to come and talk the matter over with her. Wang Ren’s enthusiastic
support for the project finally swayed the balance. She communicated her consent to
Jia Yun, while Wang Ren went ahead at once and sent word to the prince’s palace.
   The prince for his part was unaware of all this behind-the-scenes activity. He was
merely planning to despatch some of his ladies to examine the girl’s physiognomy
and suitability to enter his harem. Jia Yun managed to have a word with the ladies in
private before?hand:
    ‘None of the girl’s own family know the truth about this. So far as they are
concerned, the prince is thinking of taking the girl as one of his wives. Once she is
installed, everything will be all right, have no fear. Her grandmother has given her
consent, and her uncle Wang Ren is acting as go-between.’
    The ladies agreed to co-operate. Jia Yun went to give Lady Xing the latest news,
and informed Lady Wang of the ‘match’. Li Wan and Bao-chai had no inkling of the
truth and received the news of the princely ‘wedding’ with pleasure.
    On the day appointed, several splendidly attired palace ladies arrived, and were
received and entertained for a while by Lady Xing. They were soon aware that the
lady with whom they were dealing was of considerable rank, and were most
respectful towards her. As the terms of the transaction had not been finally agreed
upon, Lady Xing had said nothing to Qiao-jie but had merely informed her that some
relatives had come to call and asked her to go out and see them. Qiao-jie, who was
little more than a child, and too young to suspect anything, went with her old nanny
and Patience, who felt a little uneasy and insisted on accompanying her charge. The
minute Qiao-jie entered the room the two palace ladies began subjecting her to a
penetrating scrutiny, ogling her entire person, top to toe. They then rose to their feet,
took her by the hand and looked her over once more, after which they sat down
again for a few minutes and then left. Qiao-jie was most embarrassed by all this
staring, and when she returned to her room she sat puzzling it over to herself. She
could not recall ever having seen these ‘relatives’ before, and said as much to
Patience, who for her part, as soon as she had seen the way the two women were
carrying on, had guessed the truth.
    ‘They’re obviously examining her with a view to marriage,’ she thought to herself.
‘But with Mr Lian away from home, the res?ponsibility for this rests with Lady Xing,
and I’ve no idea which family is involved. A family of the same rank as ours would
never go in for all this staring. Anyway, those women didn’t look as if they came from
one of the royal princely establishments. There was something rather outlandish
about them. I’d better not say anything to Qiao-jie for the present, but wait until I
know more myself.’
   Patience set about discovering the truth of the matter, and since the maids and
serving-women concerned had all worked under her at one time or another in the
past, they were well disposed and immedia?tely gave her the information she
wanted. She was horrified, and racked her brains for some means of averting this
catastrophe. She still thought it wiser to say nothing to Qiao-jie, but hurried over to
inform Li Wan and Bao-chai, begging them to lay the matter before Lady Wang.
   Lady Wang herself had already sensed that there was something amiss, and had
said as much to Lady Xing. But Lady Xing was quite taken in by her brother and Wang
Ren, and instead of paying any heed to Lady Wang’s words, rather suspected some
ulterior motive in her opposition to the scheme.
   ‘The girl is of age,’ she replied. ‘With Lian away from home, the decision in this
matter is mine. And besides, my brother and the girl’s own uncle have both looked
into it thoroughly. Surely they know the truth. I am very much in favour of the idea.
And you needn’t worry; if anything should go wrong, Lian and I are not going to start
laying the blame at your door.’
   Lady Wang made some perfunctory reply, but was secretly furious with Lady Xing.
She took her leave and went back to tell Bao-chai what had been decided. She wept
as she spoke, and Bao-yu tried to console her.
   ‘Mother, don’t distress yourself. Nothing will come of this scheme. Whatever
happens is already written in Qiao-jie’s destiny anyway, so please don’t try to
interfere.’
   ‘Don’t be such an idiot!’ exclaimed Lady Wang. ‘Once they’ve agreed to this match,
they’ll be here any day to fetch her away! Patience is right, your cousin Lian will
blame me for this when he comes back! I would want the best for any member of the
family, and especially for Qiao-jie, for her parents’ sake. Think of the other girls. We
arranged Xiu-yan’s marriage to your cousin Ke, and now look how happy they are
together! And the Mei family into which Bao-qin has married are by all accounts very
comfortably off, so there’s no need to worry about her. Xiang-yun, I know, has not
been quite so fortunate. That match was her own uncle’s idea in the first place, and it
would have turned out well if her husband had not fallen ill of a consumption and
died. Now the poor girl has vowed to spend the rest of her days a widow. If Qiao-jie
falls into bad hands, I shall never forgive myself!’
    As she was speaking, Patience came in to consult with Bao-chai and also to learn
the results of Lady Wang’s meeting with Lady Xing. Lady Wang told her what Lady
Xing had said. After a thoughtful silence, Patience fell to her knees.
    ‘Qiao-jie’s whole future now depends on you, ma’am!’ she pleaded. ‘If we deliver
her into the hands of those people, it will mean a lifetime of suffering for her. And
what do you think Mr Lian will say when he comes home?’
    ‘You are an intelligent girl,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Stand up now and listen to what I
have to say. In the last resort, Qiao-jie is my sister-in-law’s granddaughter, not mine.
If Lady Xing wants to take a decision, how can I stand in her way?’
    ‘There is really no cause for concern,’ insisted Bao-yu. ‘The im?portant thing is to
have a clear perception of destiny.’
    Patience was afraid that Bao-yu would start raving again and commit some
indiscretion, and she remained silent. She had said all that she wanted to say to Lady
Wang, and now returned to her own apartment.
   Lady Wang’s mental distress had brought on a pain in her heart. She summoned a
maid to assist her and leaning heavily on her arm struggled back to her own room
and lay down. She did not ask Bao- yu and Bao-chai to accompany her, saying that
she would feel better after a sleep. But she found it impossible to shake off her
troubled mood, and later when she heard that old Mrs Li had called, could not bring
herself to rise from her bed and entertain her. Then Jia Lan came in to pay his
respects and to deliver a message:
   ‘A letter has come from Grandfather. The boys at the gate have brought it in.
Mother was going to give it to you, but as my Grandmother Li has just come, she
asked me to bring it instead. Mother will be coming over shortly to talk to you, and
bringing my Grand?mother Li.’
   He handed Lady Wang the letter. Lady Wang asked him, as she took it from him:
   ‘Why is your grandmother here?’
   ‘I don’t know myself,’ replied Lan. ‘I just heard say that there’s a letter from Cousin
Qi’s fiance’s family, the Zhens.’
   Lady Wang knew that Li Qi had been promised to Zhen Bao-yu, and that the
betrothal had already been sealed with the customary gift of tea. It must be that the
Zhens wanted to proceed with the wedding, and old Mrs Li had come to discuss
some last-minute details. She nodded, and opened the letter from Jia Zheng:

The canal is congested with boats bringing hack the army from its successful
campaign on the coast, and my progress has thereby been greatly delayed. I have
heard that Tan-chun’s husband is travelling to the capital with his father, and wonder
if you have heard anything from them? A day or two ago I had a letter from Lian,
telling me of brother She’s illness. Is there any more news?
   The time is drawing near for Bao-yu and Lan to sit their examinations. They must
study diligently and on no account must they be allowed to fritter their time away. It
will be a few days before I can reach Nanking with Mother’s coffin. I am in good
health, so don’t worry about me.
   Please pass on my instructions to Bao-yu and Lan.

Zheng.

Dated the _day of the _month
PS Rong will be writing separately.

After reading the letter, Lady Wang handed it hack to Jia Lan, saying:
  ‘Give this to Bao-yu and tell him to read it. And then give it back to your mother.’
   While she was speaking, Li Wan and old Mrs Li came in and paid their respects.
They seated themselves, and old Mrs Li spoke about the Zhens and Li Qi’s wedding.
They discussed this for a while, and then Li Wan asked Lady Wang:
   ‘Have you read Father’s letter?’
   ‘I have.’
   Jia Lan handed the letter to his mother, who read it herself and said:
   ‘Tan-chun has been away for over a year and not once come home. It will be such
a relief for you now that they are moving up to the capital.’
   ‘Yes,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘I was in some pain just now, but this piece of news has
made me feel much more comfortable. We still don’t know when they’ll be arriving,
mind you.’
   Old Mrs Li asked how Jia Zheng’s journey had been, while Li Wan turned to Jia Lan
and said:
   ‘I hope you have taken note of what your grandfather says in his letter? The
examination is drawing closer, and he is very concerned about you both. You’d better
hurry and take the letter for Bao-yu to read.’
   ‘Please tell me,’ enquired old Mrs Li, ‘how it is that the two of them can take the
second examination without having acquired their first degree?’
   Lady Wang explained:
   ‘Before he set out on his posting as Grain Intendant, my husband arranged for the
purchase of the Licentiate degree for the two of them.’
   Old Mrs Li nodded, and Jia Lan went off with the letter to find Bao-yu.
   Having taken his leave of Lady Wang earlier, Bao-yu had returned to his apartment,
where he picked up his copy of the ‘Autumn Floods’ chapter from Zhuang-zi and
began reading it with fascination. When Bao-chai came out from the inner room and
saw him so totally absorbed in his reading, she wandered across and glanced at the
book’s title. It disappointed her greatly that it should be a Taoist classic.
    ‘Still the only thing he takes seriously is nonsense like this about quitting the world
and rising above the mortal plane”,’ she reflected to herself. ‘He’s truly a hopeless
case!’
    It seemed futile to remonstrate with him, so she just sat by his side, gazing at him
reproachfully. Observing her expression, Bao-yu asked:
    ‘What’s all this about, then?’
    ‘Since we are husband and wife,’ she replied, ‘I should be able to look to you for
lifelong support. Our life together should be built on something more than the
passion of a moment. Glory and wealth are as insubstantial as a cloud - that I can
understand. But since ancient times, what the sages have prized most has always
been virtue, not...’
   Before he had heard her out, Bao-yu put his book down, smiled and said:
   ‘You talk of virtue and the sages of ancient times. But do you know that the sages
also held up as an ideal the “heart of a new-born child”? What virtues has the
new-born child? None, only a complete absence of knowledge, of consciousness, of
greed, of envy. All our lives we sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of greed,
hatred, folly and passion. The great question is, how to rise above all this, how to
escape the net of this mortal life? “This floating life, with its meetings and partings” -
I can see now why in all the ages since it was first uttered the true meaning of this
expression has never been fully grasped. As for your “virtue”, who has ever attained
the true pristine state of virtue?’
   ‘What the ancients meant by the “heart of a new-born child”,’ retorted Bao-chai,
‘was a heart full of loyalty and filial devotion, not this mystical, escapist notion of
yours. The Emperors Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius - they all spent
their lives improving the lot of mankind. Their “heart of a new-born child” was simply
their spirit of compassion and concern for others. Whereas yours, it would seem,
leaves you so blissfully unconcerned that you would be willing to forsake your own
family. It doesn’t make any sense to me.’
   Bao-yu nodded and smiled:
   ‘Yao and Shun were not able to prevail upon Chao-fu or Xu You to abandon their
mountain retreats; nor could King Wu or the Duke of Zhou induce Bo Yi and his
brother Shu Qi to involve themselves in the world...’
   ‘You are becoming more and more absurd!’ interrupted Bao-chai. ‘If all the men of
old had been hermits like those four you mention, then there would never have been
sages like Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou and Confucius. And besides, it’s ridiculous to
compare yourself with Bo Yi. Both he and Shu Qi lived in the declining years of the
Shang dynasty, and their lives were beset with difficulties of one kind or another. So
they had a good pretext for escaping their responsibilities. But your case is totally
different. Ours is a golden age, and we ourselves have received numerous favours
from the throne, while our ancestors enjoyed lives of luxury. And you yourself have
been treasured all your life, both by our late grandmother, and by Mother and Father.
Reflect a little on what you said just now. Don’t you think that I’m right?’
   Bao-yu listened in silence. His only response was to stare at the ceiling and smile.
   ‘Since you’re stuck for an answer,’ Bao-chai continued, ‘you should listen to my
advice. Pull yourself together from now on, and work as hard as you can. Do well in
the examination, and even if you never achieve anything else in your entire life, that
will at least be some return for Heaven’s favour and for your ancestors’ virtue.’
   Bao-yu nodded and heaved a sigh:
   ‘Doing well in the examination is not that difficult. And what you say about never
achieving anything else and making some return for Heaven’s favour and our
ancestors’ virtue is very much to the point ..
   Before Bao-chai could reply to this, Aroma put in her word:
   ‘I didn’t really understand what Mrs Bao was saying about the sages of old. All I
know is that we’ve all stuck with you through thick and thin since we were children,
tending you with more de?votion than I can say. Of course, I know that’s only as it
should be, but shouldn’t you show us a little consideration in return? And look at the
devotion Mrs Bao has shown to the Master and Her Ladyship, all for your sake! Even
if you don’t set great store by your marriage, surely you owe her a simple debt of
gratitude for what she has done? As for all that stuff about immortality, that’s just a
lot of hot air. Who ever actually saw an immortal set foot in this world of ours? Some
monk turns up from goodness knows where, talking a lot of rubbish, and you go and
take him seriously! You’re an educated man, surely you don’t give more weight to his
words than you do to the Master’s and Her Ladyship’s?’
   Bao-yu bowed his head in silence.
   Aroma had more ammunition ready, but just then footsteps were heard outside,
and a voice came through the window:
   ‘Is Uncle Bao at home?’
   Bao-yu recognized Jia Lan’s voice, stood up and said pleasantly:
   ‘Come in!’
   Jia Lan entered, his face wreathed in smiles. He paid his respects to Bao-yu and
Bao-chai, and exchanged greetings with Aroma, before presenting Bao-yu with Jia
Zheng’s letter, which Ban-yu took from him and read.
   ‘So my sister is coming back to town, then?’
  ‘Judging from the letter it seems more than likely,’ was Jia Lan’s reply.
  Bao-yu nodded his head in thoughtful silence, and Jia Lan con?tinued:
  ‘You see at the end of the letter, Uncle Bao, Grandfather urges us to get down to
some serious work. I don’t suppose you’ve been doing many compositions recently,
have you?’
  Bao-yu laughed:
  ‘I’d like to do a few, just to keep my hand in. Why not? May as well pull the wool
over their eyes!’
‘ In that case,’ suggested Jia Lan, ‘why don’t you propose a few themes, and we’ll
write them together. That will help us prepare for the exam. I certainly don’t want to
hand in a blank sheet and make a fool of us both.’
  ‘I know you will do nothing of the kind,’ said Bao-yu.
  Bao-chai asked Jia Lan to take a seat. Bao-yu sat down again himself in his original
chair, while Jia Lan perched politely nearby, and they chatted for a while about their
compositions, their conversa?tion becoming quite animated. Bao-chai, seeing the
two of them thus engrossed, discreetly withdrew, thinking to herself:
   ‘It almost seems as if Bao-yu may have seen the light. But I wonder what he meant
just now by picking on my words “never achieving anything else” and repeating them
so emphatically?’
   She was still greatly puzzled. Aroma on the other hand was delighted to hear him
talking about compositions and the examina?tion.
   ‘Praise be to Buddha!’ she exclaimed silently to herself ‘What a sermon it took
though, to bring him to his senses!’
   The boys continued their discussion, and Oriole made them some tea. Jia Lan rose
to his feet to receive his cup, and talked a little longer about the regulations
governing the examination, adding that he would also like to invite Zhen Bao-yu over
one day. Bao-yu seemed willing that he should do so.
   After a while, Jia Lan returned to his apartment, leaving Jia Zheng’s letter behind
with Bao-yu. Bao-yu read it through again, and with a smile on his lips went in and
handed it to Musk to put away. Then he returned and removed his copy of Zhuang-zi
from the table, collecting up at the same time some of his other favourite esoteric
books (a collection that included The Hermetic Clavicule, The Secret of the Primordial
Flower and The Compendium of the Five Lamps). He gave instructions to Musk,
Ripple and Oriole to store all of these away. Bao-chai was amazed to see him do this,
and wished to sound out his true motives.
   ‘It’s very commendable of you to forgo reading such books,’ she said with a
quizzical smile. ‘But why do you have to move them out of sight altogether?’
   ‘Because now I understand,’ replied Bao-yu. ‘None of those books is worth
anything. It would be best to burn the lot and be rid of them once and for all!’
  Bao-chai was delighted to hear him saying this. But the very next minute she heard
him recite, as if to himself:


‘True Buddha Mind Within
Is not in Sutras to be found;
Beyond the Crucible,
There leads a path to Higher Ground.’

  Bao-chai did not catch every word, but ‘Buddha Mind Within’ and ‘Higher Ground’
were enough to fill her once more with gloomy forebodings. She watched him
anxiously. He told the maids to prepare a quiet room for him, looked out all his old
copies of books like Zhucius’s Neo-Confucian Primer, and collections of examination
essays and verses, and assembled them all in his new room. Then he sat down in
earnest and began quietly working. Bao-chai felt she could finally set her mind at
rest.
   Aroma could hardly believe the evidence of her eyes and ears. She smiled
conspiratorially at Bao-chai:
   ‘You certainly know how to talk him round, ma’am! Just that one lecture from you
and he’s a new man! I only hope he hasn’t left it too late. The exams are looming
very close.’
   Bao-chai nodded and smiled:
   ‘These things are in the hands of fate. His success will not turn on how soon or late
he begins preparing. I just hope that from now on he will learn to be more adult, and
give up his old antics.
   Checking first that she and Aroma were alone in the room, she added in an
undertone:
   ‘I’m certainly very pleased at this change of heart. But there is still one thing that
worries me. His old weakness. We ought to try to isolate him from our own sex.’
   ‘You are quite right, ma’am,’ said Aroma. ‘So long as he was under the influence of
that monk, he seemed to be quite indifferent to the girls around him. But now that
he’s changed course again, we must once more be on our guard for a revival of his
old habits. I don’t think he’s likely to show much interest in either of us, ma’am. With
Nightingale gone, that only leaves the four other maids. Fivey is the little vixen
among them, but I hear that her mother has been asking for permission to take her
out of service to get married, so she’ll be leaving in a few days’ time. Musk and
Ripple have never been particularly close to Master Bao, but we shouldn’t forget that
they used to fool about with him when he was a child. That leaves Oriole. He doesn’t
seem at all interested in her, and she’s a very dependable girl. I suggest that for
day-to-day duties, like pouring tea and carrying water, Oriole should take charge,
with a few of the junior maids to help her. What do you think, ma’am?’
   ‘I have been worrying about the same thing myself’ replied Bao-chai. ‘Your
proposal is a very sensible one.’
   So from then on Oriole was put in charge. Bao-yu never left his room now. Every
day he sent someone else to pay respects to his mother on his behalf. Lady Wang’s
delight at this new regime of his needs no description.
   When the third of the eighth came round (Grandmother Jia’s birthday), Bao-yu
went early in the morning to kowtow at her shrine and then returned to his ‘quiet
room’. After breakfast, Bao-chai, Aroma and some of the maids had gone to sit in the
front room and were chatting with Ladies Xing and Wang, and he was sitting alone in
his room, deep in concentration, when Oriole carne in with a tray of sweetmeats.
   ‘Her Ladyship asked me to bring these for you,’ she said. ‘They are offerings left
over from Her Old Ladyship’s sacrifice.’
   Bao-yu rose to his feet to thank her and then sat down again.
   ‘Put them over there,’ he said.
   As she placed the tray to one side, Oriole said to him in an undertone:
   ‘Her Ladyship has been speaking very highly of you in the front room.’
   Bao-yu smiled. Oriole continued:
   ‘She said that now you are studying so hard, you are sure to pass your exam and
then if you go on and become a Palace Graduate and an official, your parents’ hopes
for you will not have been in vain.
   Oriole suddenly remembered what Bao-yu had once said to her, the day she had
knotted tassels for him.
   ‘I hope you do pass!’ she went on animatedly. ‘It will be such a blessing for our
mistress. Remember what you said that day in the Garden, when you asked me to
knot you a plum-blossom tassel? You wondered what lucky household the mistress
would take me to when she married? Well, you were the lucky one after all!’
   There was something about what she said and the way she said it that aroused in
Bao-yu once more an old and all too human emotion. But the nostalgia soon passed;
he composed himself again and said with a gentle smile:
   ‘So, according to you, I am lucky, and so is your mistress. But how do you feel
about it?’
   Oriole flushed at once, and forced a smile:
   ‘We’re just maids. Being lucky or not doesn’t really enter into it for us.’
   Bao-yu smiled again:
   ‘As a matter of fact, even if you did spend your whole life as a maid, you might turn
out to have been luckier than either of us.’
  This sounded to Oriole like more of his foolishness. She was afraid of being
responsible for another of his scenes, and deemed it prudent to leave, but before she
could do so, Bao-yu laughed:
  ‘Silly girl! Let me tell you something.’
  If you want to know what it was, you must turn to the next chapter.

CHAPTER 119

Bao-yu becomes a Provincial Graduate
and severs worldly ties
The House of Jia receives Imperial favour
and renews ancestral glory
As we told in the last chapter, Oriole, perplexed by Bao-yu’s words, had been about
to leave when she heard him speak again:
   ‘Silly girl! Let me tell you something. If your mistress is lucky, then so are you, since
you are her maid. Aroma cannot be depended upon. In future, mark my words, you
must look after your mistress with care and devotion, and in the end you may receive
a fitting reward for your years of service.’
   To Oriole Bao-yu’s speech, although it began with some semblance of sense, tailed
off into rambling nonsense.
   ‘Well,’ she replied, ‘I’d better be going now. Madam is waiting for me. If you want
any more sweets, Mr Bao, just send one of the junior maids to fetch me.’
   Bao-yu nodded and Oriole went on her way. Shortly afterwards, Bao-chai and
Aroma returned from the front room.

*

The time drew near for the examination. All the family were full of eager anticipation,
hoping that the two boys would write creditable compositions and bring the family
honour. All except for Bao-chai; while it was true that Bao-yu had prepared well, she
had also on occasions noticed a strange indifference in his behaviour. Her first
concern was that the two boys, for both of whom this was the first venture of its kind,
might get hurt or have some accident in the crush of men and vehicles around the
examination halls. She was more particularly worried for Bao-yu, who had not been
out at all since his encounter with the monk. His delight in studying seemed to her
the result of a somewhat too hasty and not altogether convincing conversion, and
she had a premonition that something untoward was going to happen. So, on the day
before the big event, she despatched Aroma and a few of the junior maids to go with
Candida and her helpers and make sure that the candidates were both properly
prepared. She herself inspected their things and put them out in readiness, and then
went over with Li Wan to Lady Wang’s apart?ment, where she selected a few of the
more trusty family retainers to accompany them the next day, for fear they might be
jolted or trampled on in the crowds.
   The big day finally arrived, and Bao-yu and Jia Lan changed into smart but
unostentatious clothes. They came over in high spirits to bid farewell to Lady Wang,
who gave them a few parting words of advice:
   ‘This is the first examination for both of you, and although you are such big boys
now, it will still be the first time either of you has been away from me for a whole day.
You may have gone out m the past, but you were always surrounded by your maids
and nurses. You have never spent the night away on your own like this. Today, when
you both go into the examination, you are bound to feel rather lonely with none of
the family by you. You must take special care. Finish your papers and come out as
early as possible, and then be sure to find one of the family servants and come home
as soon as you can. We shall be worrying about you.’
   As she spoke, Lady Wang herself was greatly moved by the occas?ion. Jia Lan made
all the appropriate responses, but Bao-yu remained silent until his mother had quite
finished speaking. Then he walked up to her, knelt at her feet and with tears
streaming down his cheeks kowtowed to her three times and said:
   ‘I could never repay you adequately for all you have done for me, Mother. But if I
can do this one thing successfully, if I can do my very best and pass this examination,
then perhaps I can bring you a little pleasure. Then my worldly duty will be
accomplished and I will at least have made some small return for all the trouble I
have caused you.’
   Lady Wang was still more deeply moved by this:
   ‘It is a very fine thing, what you are setting out to do. It is only a shame that your
grandmother couldn’t be here to witness it.’
   She wept as she spoke and put her arms around him to draw him to her. Bao-yu
remained kneeling however and would not rise.
   ‘Even though Grandmother is not here,’ he said, ‘I am sure she knows about it and
is happy. So really it is just as if she were present. What separates us is only matter.
We are together in spirit.’
   Li Wan feared that this scene might provoke Bao-yu to one of his fits. Besides, she
sensed something inauspicious. She hurried forward:
  ‘Mother, today we should be filled with joy. You mustn’t upset yourself like this.
Think how sensible and dutiful and hard-working Bao-yu has been of late. All he
needs to do now is to sit the ex?aminations with Lan, write his papers properly and
come home early. Then he can show copies of what he has written to some scholars
connected with the family, and we’ll just wait for the good news.’
  She told one of the maids to help Bao-yu to his feet. Bao-yu turned and bowed to
her:
  ‘Sister-in-law, you are not to worry. Lan and I are sure to pass. What is more, Lan
has a brilliant future ahead of him, while you yourself will one day become a lady of
noble rank and dress in the finest robes.’
  Li Wan smiled:
  ‘If all this were ever to come true, it would at least be some compensation…’
  She stopped short, fearing to cause Lady Wang further distress. Bao-yu felt no such
inhibition:
   ‘If Lan does well and upholds our family tradition, my late brother may not have
lived to witness it, but you will at least see his dearest wishes fulfilled.’
   It was getting late, and since Li Wan did not wish to prolong this exchange any
further, she contented herself with a brief nod. Bao?-chai had already perceived the
strangeness of the conversation. Not only were Bao-yu’s remarks ominous in
themselves, but every word uttered by Lady Wang and Li Wan seemed laden with
inauspicious meaning as well. Not daring to express this presentiment of hers openly,
Bao-chai held back her tears and remained silent. Bao-yu came up to her and made
her a deep bow. It seemed to them all such an eccentric way to behave, and no one
could imagine what it was supposed to mean; nor did anyone dare to laugh. The
general amaze?ment increased when Bao-chai burst into floods of tears, and Bao-yu
bade her farewell:
   ‘Coz! I’m going now. Stay here with Mother and wait for the good news!’
   ‘It is time for you to go,’ replied Bao-chai. ‘There is no need to embark on another
of your long speeches.’
   ‘Strange that you should be urging me on my way,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know it is time to
go.’
   He glanced around him and saw that Xi-chun and Nightingale were absent.
   ‘Say goodbye to Xi-chun and Nightingale for me,’ he said. ‘I shall certainly be
meeting them again.’
   Everyone was forcibly struck by the strange blend of sense and nonsense in
Bao-yu’s words.         They thought him momentarily confused, in part by the
unprecedented nature of the occasion, in part by Lady Wang’s injunctions. To all of
them the best course of action in the circumstances seemed to be to speed him on
his way and get the thing over with.
   ‘They’re waiting for you outside. No more dilly-dallying now, or you’ll be late.’
   Bao-yu raised his head and laughed.
   ‘Off I go! Enough of this foolery! It’s over!’
   ‘Well - off you go then!’ they all cried, laughing nervously. Only Lady Wang and
Bao-chai were sobbing inconsolably, as if they were parting from him for ever. Finally
Bao-yu walked out through the door and on his way, giggling like a half-wit.

Entering the lists of worldly renown,
            He breaks the first bar of his earthly cage.

*
We must leave Bao-yu and Jia Lan on their way to the examination, and return to Jia
Huan. The excitement surrounding the candidates’ departure had left him feeling
even more peeved and sour than usual, and with their absence he was now free to
carry out his plan:
   ‘My own mother will be avenged! Now there’s not a man left in the house, and
Aunt Xing will do as I say. I need fear no one.’
   With determined stride he hurried over to Lady Xing’s to pay her his respects, and
then conversed with her for a while in a most obsequious tone. She was naturally
flattered, and said to him:
   ‘Now you are speaking like an intelligent child! Or course I’m the one who ought to
take the decision in an affair such as this of Qiao-?jie’s. It was very stupid of your
cousin Lian to ignore his own mother and place this in someone else’s hands.’
   ‘So far as the prince is concerned, your side of the family is the one that he
recognizes,’ said Jia Huan. ‘The whole thing is settled, and now they are preparing to
send you a large consignment of presents. With this prince married to your
granddaughter, Uncle She is bound to be given an important position. It will benefit
us all. I don’t want to sound critical of Mother, but all the time sister Yuan-chun was
an Imperial Concubine, it didn’t prevent them from treating some of us very shoddily.
I hope Qiao-jie will be less ungrateful. I must have a word with her.’
   ‘Yes, you should speak to her,’ said Lady Xing. ‘It will give her a chance to see how
much you’ve done for her. I am sure if her father were at home he would never have
found her such a good match! That foolish creature Patience has been saying things
against it and protesting that your mother disapproves. It is probably nothing more
than sour grapes on their part. We must lose no time, or Lian will be back and then
they will set him against the idea too and we’ll never be able to go through with it.’
   ‘So far as the prince is concerned, the matter is already settled,’ said Jia Huan.
‘They are only waiting for you to send over the horoscope. Then, according to their
princely customs, she will be fetched three days later for the wedding. There is
however one condition that you may object to. They say that in view of the
circumstances, because it is not quite proper to marry the grand?daughter of a
disgraced official, they will have to take her away quietly without any ceremony. Later,
when Uncle She has been pardoned and reinstated in office, they can celebrate the
union with all the usual festivities.’
   ‘Of course I agree,’ said Lady Xing. ‘What they suggest is only correct.’
   ‘In that case all you have to do now is give them the Eight Characters for Qiao-jie’s
horoscope.’
   ‘Silly boy! What can we womenfolk do? You’d better ask Yun to write them out for
you.’
   Jia Huan was delighted by Lady Xing’s response and agreed at once to this proposal,
which suited him perfectly. He hurried over to have a word with Jia Yun, and asked
Wang Ren to go to the prince’s palace to sign the contract and receive the money.
   The conversation between Jia Huan and Lady Xing had been overheard by one of
Lady Xing’s maids who owed her appointment to Patience and who therefore, as
soon as an opportunity presented itself, went straight to see Patience and told her
the gist of what was happening. Patience had known all along that no good would
come of this marriage plan, and had already told Qiao-jie all that she knew about it.
When she first learnt that she was to be married, Qiao-jie had cried all night long; she
demanded that they wait for her father’s return before making a decision, and
insisted that there was no need to obey Lady Xing. Now, when this latest news
arrived, she began howling and wanted to go and complain to Lady Xing herself.
Patience hastened to prevent her:
   ‘You must calm down, miss. Lady Xing is your own grandmother, and with your
father away she has every right to make these decis?ions. Besides, your own uncle is
acting as go-between. They’re all in this together, and you’re on your own. You’ll
never make them change their minds. And I am only a maid, I can say nothing. We
must try to think of a plan ourselves, and not do anything rash!’
   ‘You’d better be quick,’ advised Lady Xing’s maid, ‘or it will be too late. The bridal
chair will be here any day now and then Miss Qiao-jie will be taken away.’
   With these gloomy words she returned to Lady Xing’s apartment.
   Patience turned round to see Qiao-jie huddled up and weeping disconsolately to
herself. She reached out a hand to comfort her:
   ‘It’s no use crying, miss. There’s nothing your father can do for you now. From
what they’ve been saying, it seems as if...’
   Before she could complete her sentence, a messenger arrived from Lady Xing’s and
announced:
   ‘This is indeed a happy day for Miss Qiao-jie! Will Patience please prepare
whatever Miss Qiao-jie will need to take with her. Her trousseau can wait until Mr
Lian’s return.’
   Patience was going through the motions of obeying these in?structions, when Lady
Wang arrived. Qiao-jie hugged her tightly and wept into her bosom. Lady Wang was
in tears herself:
   ‘Try not to worry, child. I’ve spoken to your grandmother and done everything I
can for you, and I’ve received nothing but insults for my pains. I can’t make her
change her mind. We can only go along with it, and try to delay things as much as
possible. Meanwhile we must send someone straight to your father to tell him what
is going on.’
   ‘But haven’t you heard, ma’am?’ said Patience. ‘Early this morning Master Huan
was over at Her Ladyship’s. According to this prince’s custom the bride will be fetched
in three days. Her Ladyship has already asked Mr Yun to prepare the horoscope. By
the time Mr Lian returns it will all be over!’
   When she heard that Huan was involved, Lady Wang was speechless with rage.
Eventually she stammered out, ‘Bring him to me! Bring him to me at once!’ A servant
went in obedience to her command, but returned to report that Master Huan had
gone out early that morning with Mr Jia Qiang and Mr Wang Ren.
   ‘Where’s young Yun?’ asked Lady Wang.
   ‘We don’t know,’ was the reply.
   The people gathered in Qiao-jie’s room stood staring impotently around them.
Lady Wang lacked the nerve to go and challenge Lady Xing directly. They all wept
bitterly on each other’s shoulders.
   Just as their spirits had sunk to these depths of gloom, a serving woman came in to
announce that Grannie Liu had arrived at the back gate of the mansion.
   ‘We’re all at sixes and sevens,’ was Lady Wang’s comment. ‘How can we start
receiving guests at a moment like this? Find some excuse and ask her to leave.’
‘Perhaps you should ask her in, ma’am,’ said Patience. ‘After all she is Qiao-jie’s
godmother. We should tell her what is happening.’
  Lady Wang said nothing. The serving-woman left the room and reappeared shortly
with Grannie Liu, who exchanged greetings with all the ladies present. Seeing their
eyes red from weeping, and having no idea what the matter was, Grannie Liu asked,
with some hesitation:
  ‘What is the trouble? It’s Mrs Lian you’re grieving for, I’ll be hound.’
   The mention of her mother set Qiao-jie weeping with renewed abandon.
   ‘There’s no point in avoiding the issue, Grannie,’ said Patience. As her godmother
you ought to know the truth.’
   She went on to tell Grannie Liu the whole story. At first the old dame was aghast.
Then, after a long silence, she suddenly laughed.
   ‘A smart young woman like you ought to be able to hit on some?thing without
much difficulty. Look at the drum ballads, they are full of clever plots and schemes
for getting people out of scrapes like this one.’
   ‘Oh, Grannie!’ begged Patience. ‘If you can think of a way, please tell us quickly!’
‘It’s easy,’ said the old dame. ‘We mustn’t tell a soul, though, and we must be sure
to make a quick getaway and hide - that’s all that’s needed.’
   ‘You can’t be serious!’ protested Patience. ‘Where could someone from a family
like ours possibly hide?’
   ‘Well,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘if you’re willing - and that’s the only if- then you can both
come to our village. I can keep Miss Qiao-jie hidden and at the same time I’ll tell my
son-in-law to send a man with a letter (which Miss Qiao-jie must write with her own
hand) straight to Mr Lian. Once he arrives on the scene, everything can be mended
well enough.’
    ‘And if Lady Xing finds out meanwhile?’ asked Patience.
    ‘Do they know that I’m here?’ asked Grannie Liu.
    ‘Lady Xing is living at the front, and as she treats people so harshly no one ever
tells her what’s going on. If you’d come in by the front gate she might have known. As
it is, we have nothing to fear.’
    ‘Well then,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘let us agree on a time, and then I’ll tell my son-in-law
to send a cart for you both.’
    ‘There’s not a moment to be lost,’ urged Patience. ‘I’ll be as quick as I can.’
    She went into the inner room with Lady Wang, and having dis?missed all the
servants explained Grannie Liu’s plan to her. Lady Wang considered it carefully, and
judged it altogether too risky.
    ‘But it’s our only hope!’ pleaded Patience. ‘I can speak my mind to you, ma’am.
This is what I think you should do. You must pretend to know nothing about it; later
you can even go to Lady Xing’s and ask her where Qia-jie has gone. We’ll send a
message to Mr Lian, and surely he won’t be long coming.’
    Lady Wang was silent, and heaved a deep sigh. Qiao-jie had heard them talking
and added her entreaties to those of Patience:
    ‘Oh Auntie, please! Save me! I know how grateful Father will be to you when he
returns.’
    ‘We must go ahead with our plan,’ said Patience decisively. ‘You can return to your
own apartment, ma’am. But please send someone to keep an eye on Qiao-jie’s
room.’
  ‘Very well then- but be secret about it!’ urged Lady Wang. ‘And both of you,
remember to take plenty of clothes and bedding with you.’
  ‘We must leave quickly if we are to succeed,’ said Patience. ‘If they come back with
the contract signed, we’ll be done for!’
  This seemed to bring Lady Wang to her senses:
  ‘Yes! Of course! You must hurry! You can depend on me!’ Lady Wang returned to
her own apartment, and then went to engage Lady Xing in conversation and thus
hold her at bay.
  Patience despatched a servant to prepare their things, with in?structions not to
seem too furtive about it. ‘If anyone comes in and sees what you are doing, just say
that you are acting on Lady Xing’s instructions, and that you’re ordering a carriage for
Grannie Liu to go home in.’ Meanwhile the men on the back gate were bribed and
told to hire a carriage. Patience dressed Qiao-jie to look like Grannie Liu’s
granddaughter Qing-er, and hurried out with her. She pre?tended to be seeing the
‘Liu family’ off, and then at the last minute jumped into the carriage herself. Although
the back gate had recently been kept open, there were only one or two men on
regular duty; as for the various other domestic servants, the mansion was so large
and understaffed - indeed almost deserted - that their departure was sure to go
virtually unnoticed. Besides, Lady Xing had a reputation for meanness with the
servants, and they disapproved of what they knew she was planning to do to Qiao-jie.
They were therefore very much on Patience’s side and only too willing to connive at
Qia-jie’s escape. Lady Xing was thus successfully engaged in con?versation with Lady
Wang, and remained completely unaware of the escape.
   Lady Wang was still most apprehensive. After talking to Lady Xing she made her
way to Bao-chai’s, trying to attract as little attention as possible, and sat there, her
mind filled with doubts as to the safety of the enterprise. Seeing how distracted she
was, Bao-chai asked her what was on her mind, and Lady Wang explained
every?thing to her in confidence.
   ‘How very dangerous!’ exclaimed Bao-chai. ‘We must find Yun quickly and order
him to halt matters at his end at once.’
   ‘But I can’t even find Huan!’ complained Lady Wang.
   ‘You must carry on as if you know nothing at all,’ advised Bao-chai. ‘I shall find
someone to inform Aunt Xing.’
   Lady Wang nodded and left Bao-chai to proceed with her plan.

*

Our story now turns to the Mongol prince himself. This gentleman was in fact doing
no more than looking for a couple of presentable young concubines to add to his
harem, and on the strength of a professional broker’s recommendation had sent two
of his women to examine Qiao-jie. When they returned, and when their master
ques?tioned them about the young lady’s provenance, they did not dare conceal the
truth. The prince was deeply shocked to learn that she was from such an old and
noble family:
   ‘But this is monstrous! Such a thing is strictly forbidden! I have come close to
committing a grave crime! Besides, I have already been received in audience by His
Majesty and will shortly be choosing a suitable day to start on my return journey. If
anyone should come to pursue this matter further, send him packing!’
   This was precisely the day on which Jia Yun and Wang Ren were delivering
Qiao-jie’s horoscope to the palace. When they arrived they met with a brusque
reception:
  ‘His Highness has instructed that any person daring to mis?represent a member of
the Jia family as a common citizen is to be arrested and dealt with according to due
process of law! What an outrageous way to behave in these peaceful times!’
  Wang Ren and Jia Yun skulked off at once with their tails between their legs,
grumbling to themselves that someone had betrayed them and going their separate
ways in extremely low spirits.
  Jia Huan was at home waiting for news, and had become very agitated when he
received Lady Wang’s summons. He saw Jia Yun returning home on his own, and
rushed up to him:
  ‘Well? Is everything arranged?’
  Jia Yun stamped his foot frantically:
  ‘It’s terrible! Something’s gone badly wrong! I can’t think who can have given us
away.’
  He told the whole story to Huan, who was at first speechless with rage, then burst
out:
  ‘Only this morning I was at Aunt Xing’s singing the praises of this match; now what
am I supposed to do? You’re all trying to ruin me!’
  Just as they were wondering how to save the situation, a confused hubbub
reached them from the inner apartments. They heard their own names called,
‘wanted by Their Ladyships’, and slunk shame?facedly into Lady Wang’s apartment.
  ‘A fine mess you’ve made of things!’ exclaimed Lady Wang, waiting for them with
fury written on her face. ‘Well, now you’ve driven Qia-jie and Patience to their
deaths! The least you can do is bring me back their corpses!’
   They both knelt at her feet. Jia Huan did not dare to open his mouth, but Jia Yun
bowed his head and said:
   ‘I would never have dared to do it myself. We only mentioned this match to you,
Great-aunts, because Great-uncle Xing and Uncle Wang suggested it. It was all their
idea. Then Great-aunt Xing agreed to it and asked me to write out the horoscope.
Now the other party wants to back out. How can you accuse us of driving Qiao-jie to
her death?’
   ‘Huan told your great-aunt Xing that they would be arriving in three days to take
the girl away,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Whoever heard of a proper wedding being conducted
in such a hurry? I shall ask no more questions. Just give me back Qiao-jie. We shall
see what Sir Zheng decides to do with you when he returns.’
   Lady Xing wept in silent shame. Lady Wang turned next on Jia Huan:
   ‘That harpy Aunt Zhao evidently left behind her a son every bit as vile as herself!’
   She called one of her maids to support her and retired to her bedroom.
   Left on their own Jia Huan, Jia Yun and Lady Xing began to indulge in mutual
recrimination, until finally one of them said:
   ‘What’s the use of blaming each other like this? The girl probably isn’t dead at all.
Patience has almost certainly taken her off to hide in the home of a relative.’
   Lady Xing summoned the janitors from the front and rear gates and after giving
them a good scolding asked them where Qiao-jie and Patience had gone.
   ‘It’s no good asking us, ma’am,’ they replied with one voice. ‘Ask one of the
stewards, they’re the ones who ought to know. We wouldn’t advise you to make a
scene, ma’am. If Lady Wang should choose to question us, there’s plenty we could
tell. And if one person is beaten or given the sack, it will have to be everyone. Since
Mr Lian left it’s been a sheer disgrace what has been going on in the front of the
mansion. We haven’t even received our wages or monthly grain allowance, but
they’ve been drinking and gambling away, fooling around with pretty little actors,
inviting girls into the house--is that how masters of the family are supposed to
behave?’
   Jia Yun and Jia Huan were silent. A servant arrived from Lady Wang’s with renewed
orders to ‘hurry up and find Patience and Qiao-jie’, which sent them into another
flurry of desperate activity. They did not even bother to question the servants in
Qiao-jie’s own apartment, knowing they would be too hostile to reveal the
where?abouts of the missing pair (though this was hardly something they could say
to Lady Wang). Instead they had to go asking at the home of every relative, and still
failed to unearth the slightest clue. Lady Xing in the inner apartments and Jia Huan in
the outer spent a hectic few days and nights.
   At last came the day when the examinations were due to be con?cluded and the
students released from their cells. Lady Wang was eagerly awaiting the return of
Bao-yu and Jia Lan, and when midday came and there was still no sign of either of
them, she, Li Wan and Bao-chai all began to worry and sent one servant after
another to find out what had become of them. The servants could obtain no news,
and not one of them dared to return empty-handed. Later another batch was
despatched on the same mission, with the same result. The three ladies were beside
themselves with anxiety.
   When evening came, someone returned at last: it was Jia Lan. They were delighted
to see him, and immediately asked:
   ‘Where is Bao-yu?’
   He did not even greet them but burst into tears.
   ‘Lost!’ he sobbed.
   For several minutes Lady Wang was struck dumb. Then she col?lapsed senseless
onto her couch. Luckily Suncloud and one or two other maids were at hand to
support her, and they brought her round, themselves sobbing hysterically the while.
Bao-chai stared in front of her with a glazed expression in her eyes, while Aroma
sobbed her heart out. The only thing they could find time to do between their fits of
sobbing was to scold Jia Lan:
   ‘Fool! You were with Bao-yu - how could he get lost?’
   ‘Before the examinations we stayed in the same room, we ate together and slept
together. Even when we went in we were never far apart, we were always within
sight of each other. This morning Uncle Bao finished his paper early and waited for
me. We handed in our papers at the same time and left together. When we reached
the Dragon Gate outside there was a big crowd and I lost sight of him. The servants
who had come to fetch us asked me where he was and Li Gui told them: “One minute
he was just over there clear as daylight, the next minute he was gone. How can he
have disappeared so suddenly in the crowd?” I told Li Gui and the others to split up
into search parties, while I took some men and looked in all the cubicles. But there
was no sign of him. That’s why I’m so late back.’
   Lady Wang had been sobbing throughout this, without saying a word. Bao-chai had
already more or less guessed the truth. Aroma continued to weep inconsolably. Jia
Qiang and the other men needed no further orders but set off immediately in several
directions to join in the search. It was a sad sight, with everyone in the lowest of
spirits and the welcome-home party prepared in vain. Jia Lan forgot his own
exhaustion and wanted to go out with the others. But Lady Wang kept him back:
   ‘My child! Your uncle is lost; if we lost you as well, it would be more than we could
bear! You have a rest now, there’s a good boy!’
   He was reluctant to stay behind, but acquiesced when You-shi added her
entreaties to Lady Wang’s.
   The only person present who seemed unsurprised was Xi-chun. She did not feel
free to express her thoughts, but instead enquired of Bao-chai:
   ‘Did Bao-yu have his jade with him when he left?’
   ‘Of course he did,’ she replied. ‘He never goes anywhere without it.’
   Xi-chun was silent. Aroma remembered how they had had to waylay Bao-yu and
snatch the jade from his hands, and she had an overwhelming suspicion that today’s
mishap was that monk’s doing too. Her heart ached with grief, tears poured down
her cheeks and she began wailing despondently. Memories flooded back of the
affection Bao-yu had shown her. ‘I annoyed him sometimes, I know, and then he’d be
cross. But he always had a way of making it up. He was so kind to me, and so
thoughtful. In heated moments he often would vow to become a monk. I never
believed him. And now he’s gone!’
   It was two o’clock in the morning by now, and still there was no sign of Bao-yu. Li
Wan, afraid that Lady Wang would injure herself through excess of grief, did her best
to console her and advised her to retire to bed. The rest of the family accompanied
her to her room, except for Lady Xing who returned to her own apartment, and Jia
Huan who was still lying low and had not dared to make an appear?ance at all. Lady
Wang told Jia Lan to go back to his room, and herself spent a sleepless night. Next
day at dawn some of the servants despatched the previous day returned, to report
that they had searched everywhere and failed to find the slightest trace of Bao-yu.
During the morning a stream of relations including Aunt Xue, Xue Ke, Shi Xiang-yun,
Bao-qin and old Mrs Li came to enquire after Lady Wang’s health and to ask for news
of Bao-yu.
   After several days of this, Lady Wang was so consumed with grief that she could
neither eat nor drink, and her very life seemed in danger. Then suddenly a servant
announced a messenger from the Commandant of the Haimen Coastal Region, who
brought news that Tan-chun was due to arrive in the capital the following day.
Although this could not totally dispel her grief at Bao-yu’s disappearance, Lady Wang
felt some slight comfort at the thought of seeing Tan-chun again. The next day,
Tan-chun arrived at Rong-guo House and they all went out to the front to greet her,
finding her lovelier than ever and most prettily dressed. When Tan-chun saw how
Lady Wang had aged, and how red-eyed everyone in the family was, tears sprang to
her eyes, and it was a while before she could stop weeping and greet them all
properly. She was also distressed to see Xi-chun in a nun’s habit, and wept again to
learn of Bao-yu’s strange disappearance and the many other family misfortunes. But
she had always been gifted with a knack of finding the right thing to say, and her
natural equanimity restored a degree of calm to the gathering and gave some real
comfort to Lady Wang and the rest of the family. The next day her husband came to
visit, and when he learned how things stood he begged her to stay at home and
console her family. The maids and old serving-women who had accompanied her to
her new home were thus granted a welcome reunion with their old friends.
   The entire household, masters and servants alike, still waited anxi?ously day and
night for news of Bao-yu. Very late one night, during the fifth watch, some servants
came as far as the inner gate, an?nouncing that they had indeed wonderful news to
report, and a couple of the junior maids hurried in to the inner apartments, without
stopping to inform the senior maids.
   ‘Ma’am, ladies!’ they announced. ‘Wonderful news!’
   Lady Wang thought that Bao-yu must at last have been found and rising from her
bed she exclaimed with delight:
   ‘Where did they find him? Send him in at once to see me!’
   ‘He has been placed seventh on the roll of successful candidates!’ the maid cried.
   ‘But has he been found?’
   The maid was silent. Lady Wang sat down again.
   ‘Who came seventh?’ asked Tan-chun.
   ‘Mr Bao.’
   As they were talking they heard a voice outside shouting:
   ‘Master Lan has passed too!’
   A servant went hurrying out to receive the official notice, on which it was written
that Jia Lan had been placed one hundred and thirtieth on the roll.
   Since there was still no news of Bao-yu’s whereabouts, Li Wan did not feel free to
express her feelings of pride and joy; and Lady Wang, delighted as she was that Jia
Lan had passed, could not help thinking to herself:
   ‘If only Bao-yu were here too, what a happy celebration it would be!’
   Bao-chai alone was still plunged in gloom, though she felt it inappropriate to weep.
The others were busy offering their con?gratulations and trying to look on the
cheerful side:
   ‘Since it was Bao-yu’s fate to pass, he cannot remain lost for long. In a day or two
he is sure to be found.
   This plausible suggestion brought a momentary smile to Lady Wang’s cheeks, and
the family seized on this opportunity to persuade her to eat and drink a little. A
moment later Tealeaf’s voice could be heard calling excitedly from the inner gate:
   ‘Now that Mr Bao has passed, he is sure to be found soon!’
   ‘What makes you so sure of that?’ they asked him.
   ‘There’s a saying: “If a man once passes the examination, the whole world learns
his name.” Now everyone will know Mr Bao’s name wherever he goes, and someone
will be sure to bring him home.’
   ‘That Tealeaf may be a cheeky little devil, but there’s something in what he says,’
agreed the maids.
   Xi-chun differed:
   ‘How could a grown man like Bao-yu be lost? If you ask me, he has deliberately
severed his ties with the world and chosen the life of a monk. And in that case he will
be hard to find.’
   This set the ladies weeping all over again.
   ‘It is certainly true,’ said Li Wan, ‘that since ancient times many men have
renounced worldly rank and riches to become Buddhas or Saints.’
   ‘But if he rejects his own mother and father,’ sobbed Lady Wang, ‘then he’s failing
in his duty as a son. And in that case how can he ever hope to become a Saint or a
Buddha?’
   ‘It is best to be ordinary,’ commented Tan-chun. ‘Bao-yu was always different. He
had that jade of his ever since he was born, and everyone always thought it lucky. But
looking back, I can see that it’s brought him nothing but bad luck. If a few more days
go by and we still cannot find him- I don’t want to upset you, Mother- but I think in
that case we must resign ourselves to the fact that this is something decreed by fate
and beyond our understanding. It would be better not to think of him as having ever
been born from your womb. His destiny is after all the fruit of karma, the result of
your accumulated merit in several lifetimes.’
   Bao-chai listened to this in silence. Aroma could bear it no longer; her heart ached,
she felt dizzy and sank to the ground in a faint. Lady Wang seemed most concerned
for her, and told one of the maids to help her up.
   Jia Huan was feeling extremely out of sorts. On top of his disgrace in the Qiao-jie
affair, there was now the added humiliation of having to watch both his brother and
nephew pass their examinations. He cursed Qiang and Yun for having dragged him
into this trouble. Tan-chun was sure to take him to task now that she was back. And
yet he dared not try to hide. He was altogether in a state of abject misery.
   The next day Jia Lan had to attend court to give thanks for his successful
graduation. There he met Zhen Bao-yu and discovered that he too had passed. So
now all three of them belonged to the same ‘class’. When Lan mentioned Bao-yu’s
strange disappearance, Zhen Bao-yu sighed and offered a few words of consolation.
   The Chief Examiner presented the successful candidates’ com?positions to the
throne, and His Majesty read them through one by one and found them all to be well
balanced and cogent, displaying both breadth of learning and soundness of
judgement. When he noticed two Nanking Jias in seventh and one hundred and
thirtieth place, he asked if they were any relation of the late Jia Concubine. One of his
ministers went to summon Jia Bao-yu and Jia Lan for questioning on this matter. Jia
Lan, on arrival, explained the circum?stances of his uncle’s disappearance and gave a
full account of the three preceding generations of the family, all of which was
trans?mitted to the throne by the minister. His Majesty, as a consequence of this
information, being a monarch of exceptional enlightenment and compassion,
instructed his minister, in consideration of the family’s distinguished record of service,
to submit a full report on their case. This the minister did and drafted a detailed
memorial on the subject. His Majesty’s concern was such that on reading this
memorial he ordered the minister to re-examine the facts that had led to Jia She’s
conviction. Subsequently the Imperial eye lighted upon yet another memorial
describing the success of the recent campaign to quell the coastal disturbances,
‘causing the seas to be at peace and the rivers to be cleansed, and leaving the honest
citizenry free to pursue their livelihood unmolested once more. His Majesty was
overjoyed at this good news and ordered his council of ministers to deliberate on
suitable rewards and also to pronounce a general amnesty throughout the Empire.
   When Jia Lan had left court and had gone to pay his respects to his examiner, he
learned of the amnesty and hurried home to tell Lady Wang and the rest of the family.
They all seemed delighted, though their pleasure was marred by Bao-yu’s continued
absence. Aunt Xue was particularly happy at the news, and set about making
preparations for the payment of Xue Pan’s fine, since his death sentence would now
be commuted as part of the amnesty.
   A few days later it was announced that Zhen Bao-yu and his father had called to
offer their congratulations, and Lady Wang sent Jia Lan out to receive them. Shortly
afterwards Jia Lan returned with a broad smile on his face:
   ‘Good news, Grandmother! Uncle Zhen Bao-yu’s father has heard at court of an
edict pardoning both Great-uncle She and Uncle Zhen from Ning-guo House, and
restoring the hereditary Ning-guo rank to Uncle Zhen. Grandfather is to keep the
hereditary Rong-guo rank and after his period of mourning will be reinstated as a
Permanent Secretary in the Board of Works. All the family’s confiscated property is to
be restored. His Majesty has read Uncle Bao’s composition and was extremely struck
by it. When he discovered that the candidate concerned was Her Late Grace’s
younger brother, and when the Prince of Bei-jing added a few words of
commendation, His Majesty expressed a desire to summon him to court for an
audience. The ministers then told him that Uncle Bao had disappeared after the
examination (it was I who informed them of this in the first place), and that he was at
present being looked for everywhere, without success, whereupon His Majesty
issued another edict, ordering all the garrisons in the capital to make a thorough
search for him. You can set your mind at rest now, Grandmother. With His Majesty
taking a personal interest in the matter, Uncle Bao is sure to be found!’
  Lady Wang and the rest of the family were delighted and con?gratulated each
other on this new turn of events.

*

Meanwhile Jia Huan and his accomplices were still on tenterhooks, searching
everywhere for Qiao-jie, who having left the city with Patience and Grannie Liu had
meanwhile arrived in the village and been installed in Grannie Liu’s best room,
specially cleaned out for the occasion. Although their daily diet was simple village
fare, it was wholesome and clean, and with little Qing-er to keep them company they
had relatively few cares. There were a few quite well-off families in the village, who
when they heard that there was a Miss Jia staying at Grannie Liu’s insisted on coming
to have a look for themselves. They all waxed eloquent on the subject of her fairylike
appearance and sent presents of fruit, fresh produce and game. In fact, Qiao-jie’s
presence caused a considerable stir. The richest family were the Zhous, whose wealth
was composed partly of money and partly of extensive holdings of land. They had
one son in the family, a culti?vated, fine-looking lad of fourteen, who had studied
with a family tutor and had recently passed the preliminary Licentiate exam. When
his mother set eyes on Qiao-jie she was lost in admiration.
   ‘What a pity!’ she thought to herself, with a deep inner sigh of regret. ‘A boy from
a country family like ours would never be thought fit for such a well-bred young lady.’
She stood there for some time deep in thought, and Grannie Liu soon guessed what
was on her mind.
   ‘I know what you’re thinking,’ she said. ‘Why don’t I propose the match for you?’
   Mrs Zhou laughed:
   ‘Don’t go making fun of me! A great family like theirs, stoop to the likes of us!’
   ‘Well, it’d do no harm to suggest it,’ replied Grannie Liu. ‘And we shall see.’
   The two of them left it at that and went their separate ways.
   Grannie Liu was concerned to know the latest developments at Rong-guo House
and sent Ban-er into town to find out. He reached Two Dukes Street to find a throng
of carriages outside the two mansions, and stationed himself close by to glean what
news he could. This is what he overheard:
   ‘Both families have had their ranks restored and all their confis?cated property
returned. Things are looking up for them again. But young Bao-yu has disappeared
without trace after passing his exams.’
   Ban-er was delighted to hear of the family’s restoration to favour and was just
setting off home to carry the good news back to his grandmother when he saw
several horses pull up outside the gates. The riders dismounted and the gatemen
saluted with one knee on the ground:
   ‘Welcome home, sir! And congratulations! How is Sir She’s health?’
   ‘Better,’ replied the young man who had first dismounted. ‘And he has received His
Majesty’s gracious permission to return home.’ After a short pause he asked: ‘What
are those men doing over there?’
   ‘His Majesty sent an official here with a decree. They require a member of the
family to receive back all the confiscated property.’
   The young master strode in cheerfully, and Ban-er, concluding that it must be Jia
Lian, did not wait for any further news but hastened home to inform Grannie Liu. A
smile spread across the old lady’s face when she heard, and she went at once to tell
Qiao-jie and congratulate her on the good news.
   ‘We owe everything to you, Grannie,’ said Patience with a grateful smile. ‘Without
your help Miss Qiao-jie would never have lived to see this happy day.’
   Qiao-jie herself was even more excited. Presently the messenger who had been
sent with a letter to Jia Lian returned.
   ‘Mr Lian says he is extremely grateful. He asks me to escort Miss Qia-jie home at
once, and to give you this handsome reward.’
   Grannie Liu was highly satisfied that all had turned out for the best, and she sent
someone to fetch two carts. When she asked Qiao-jie and Patience to make use of
them for their return journey, they seemed reluctant to leave. They had grown
accustomed to Grannie Liu’s home, and little Qing-er was in tears because her new
friends were being taken from her. Grannie Liu, seeing how attached they had
become to one another, told Qing-er that she could travel with them in the carts into
town. And so they hurried back to Rong-guo House.

*

It will be remembered how Jia Lian, on hearing of his father’s grave illness, had
hurried to his place of exile. When father and son met there was a tearful scene,
which we need not describe in detail. Jia She gradually recovered his health, and
when Jia Lian received a letter with the latest (and none too cheerful) news from
home, he asked his father for permission to return. On his way he heard of the
amnesty, and two days later arrived home on the very day that the Edict was
delivered to Rong-guo House - at the very moment in fact when Lady Xing was
wondering who could receive the Edict on behalf of the family. Jia Lan was now
theoretically entitled to perform this function, but he was rather too young. Then Jia
Lian’s arrival was announced. He exchanged greetings with them all, and the
re?union was an occasion for expressions of both sorrow and joy. There was no time
for much talk, however, and Jia Lian hurried to the main hall to make his kowtow to
the Imperial emissary, who enquired after Jia She’s health and said:
   ‘Tomorrow you must proceed to the Imperial Treasury to receive your
compensation. The Ning-guo residence will be restored to your family.’
   The men rose to their feet, and the emissary took his leave. Jia Lian saw him off to
the front gate, where he noticed a couple of country carts pulled up. The gatemen
were refusing to allow the carts to stop there and a noisy argument was taking place.
Jia Lian realized at once that these must be the carts bringing his daughter home and
began shouting angrily at the gatemen:
   ‘You pack of misbegotten curs! While I was away you turned on your own masters
and drove my daughter from home. Now you want to prevent her from returning!
Are you trying to take ven?geance on me?’
   The servants had been dreading Jia Lian’s return, since he would be sure to find
out sooner or later what had occurred in his absence and would certainly punish
them for their part in it. It still came as something of a shock to them to hear him
speaking like this so soon, as if he had already discovered everything (how this could
be they did not understand). They rose to their feet and protested:
   ‘While you were away, sir, some of us were sick, some were away on leave; it was
all the doing of Master Huan, Mr Qiang and Mr Yun, sir, it had nothing to do with us.’
   ‘Stupid incompetents!’ cried Jia Lian. ‘I’ll deal with you when I’m finished. Hurry up
and let those carts in!’
   When Jia Lian went in he said nothing to Lady Xing. He went to Lady Wang’s
apartment, knelt before her and kowtowed:
   ‘It is thanks to your foresight, Aunt Wang, that my daughter has returned safely. I
shall say nothing of Cousin Huan’s conduct in this matter. I hardly need to. But so far
as that creature Yun is concerned, the last time he was left in charge there was
trouble, and now, in the few months that I’ve been away, he has allowed the rot to
set in. In my opinion he should be sent packing and never given a job of any kind
here again.’
   ‘What about your own brother-in-law, Wang Ren?’ exclaimed Lady Wang. ‘What
induced him to behave in such a despicable manner?’
   ‘Don’t waste your breath on him,’ replied Jia Lian. ‘I shall deal with him later.’
   Suncloud came in to announce the arrival of Qiao-jie. When Lady Wang saw her,
although the separation had not been a long one, the agonizing suspense of the days
leading up to her escape flooded back into her mind, and she broke down and wept
profusely. Qiao-jie cried a great deal herself. Jia Lian came over to thank Grannie Liu.
Lady Wang bade her be seated, and together they discussed the whole adventure.
When Jia Lian saw Patience again, he was overcome with gratitude for what she had
done, and although he could hardly express his true feelings at such a family
gathering, he could not help shedding a few tears. From this day on he held Patience
in greater and greater esteem and resolved to promote her to the position of proper
wife as soon as his father returned. But we anticipate.
   Lady Xing had been sure there would be trouble as soon as Jia Lian learned of
Qiao-Jie’s disappearance. When she heard that he was at Lady Wang’s she became
most anxious and sent a maid to eavesdrop, who returned to inform her that Qiao-jie
and Grannie Liu were both there talking, having just arrived back together. It
suddenly dawned on Lady Xing what had happened. She knew that she had been
hoodwinked and felt very peeved with Lady Wang:
   ‘Stirring up trouble between me and my son! I wonder who it was that told
Patience our secret in the first place!’
   At that moment she saw Qiao-jie and Grannie Liu come in, accompanied by
Patience. Lady Wang followed them and spoke to her, laying the blame for everything
on Jia Yun and Wang Ren:
  ‘You were taken in by what they said, Sister-in-law. You only meant the best. How
could you have known the tricks and schemes they were up to!’
  Lady Xing felt truly ashamed of herself. She saw that Lady Wang had acted rightly,
and respected her for it. From now on relations between the two sisters-in-law
became less strained.
  Patience spoke to Lady Wang, and then took Qiao-jie to say hello to Bao-chai. The
two of them exchanged commiserations.
  ‘With the Emperor’s favour now restored,’ said Qiao-jie, ‘our family is sure to
prosper once more. And surely Uncle Bao will come back.’
  As they were talking, Ripple came running into the room in a great lather, crying:
  ‘Help! Aroma’s been taken poorly!’
  But for the outcome, you must read the next chapter.

CHAPTER 120

Zhen Shi-yin expounds the Nature
of Passion and Illusion
And Jia Yu-cun concludes the Dream
of Golden Days




As soon as she heard from Ripple that Aroma had been taken seriously ill, Bao-chai
hurried in with Qiao-jie and Patience to see her. They found her lying unconscious on
the kang, having had what seemed to be a heart seizure. They forced some cool
boiled water through her lips and eventually she came round, whereupon they
settled her down to sleep and sent for the doctor.
   ‘How could Aroma have been taken like this so suddenly?’ asked Qiao-jie.
   ‘The other evening;’ replied Bao-chai, ‘she wept herself into a terrible state and
had a sudden giddy spell. Mother told one of the maids to help her up from the
ground and in the end she went to sleep. There was so much else happening at the
time that we never sent for a doctor. That must be what has brought this on.’
   The doctor arrived presently, and the ladies withdrew. When he had taken Aroma’s
pulses, he diagnosed her condition as the conse?quence of undue excitement and
anger, wrote out a prescription accordingly and took his leave.
   Aroma had in fact overheard (or thought she had overheard) someone saying that
if Bao-yu failed to return all of his maids would be dismissed. It was the shock of
hearing this that had upset her and aggravated her illness. When the doctor had
departed, and when Ripple went out to prepare her medicine, Aroma was left lying
alone on her bed, and in her confusion she thought she could see Bao-yu standing
before her. Then the dim figure of a monk appeared before her eyes, holding the
pages of an album open in his hand and saying:
   ‘You are not destined to be mine. In days to come another will claim you for his
own.’
   Aroma was about to speak to him, when Ripple returned.
   ‘Your medicine’s ready,’ she said. ‘You’d better take it now.’
   Aroma opened her eyes and knew that it had all been a dream. She did not confide
in Ripple, but swallowed her medicine and lay there brooding to herself:
   ‘Bao-yu must have gone away with that monk. I remember that day when he tried
to take the jade out and give it to the monk, he seemed bent on escaping. When I
tried to stop him he wasn’t his normal self, pushing and shoving me off like that. He
didn’t seem to care about me any more. And ever since then, he has been so cool
with Mrs Bao, and quite indifferent towards the rest of us.
   ‘I suppose you think this is enlightenment. But what sort of en?lightenment is it,
for you to abandon your own wife? Her Ladyship asked me to serve you, but
although my monthly pay has been that of a chamber-wife, I have never been
officially recognized as one. Now if the Master and Her Ladyship dismiss me and I
insist on staying, out of respect to your memory, people will think me ridicu?lous. But
how can I bear to leave, remembering how things were between us?’
   She agonized over her dilemma, and recalling the ominous words Bao-yu had
spoken to her in her dream she vowed to herself that if her destiny could not be
shared with Bao-yu she would rather not live at all.
  With the medicine, however, the pain in her heart gradually subsided. She felt
guilty to be lying down all the time, but forced herself to rest and struggled through
the next few days until she was able to get up and about again and wait on her
mistress. Bao-chai herself although she was constantly thinking of Bao-yu and shed
many a tear in private over her own unhappy fate, was kept busy helping her own
mother to arrange for the payment of Xue Pan’s commutation fine, by no means an
easy task. But of this no more.

*

Jia Zheng had arrived in Nanking with Grandmother Jia’s coffin, accompanied by Jia
Rong and the coffins of Qin-shi, Xi-feng, Dai-yu and Faithful. They made
arrangements for the Jia family members to be interred, and then Jia Rong took
Dai-yu’s coffin to her owr family graveyard to be buried there, while Jia Zheng saw to
the construction of the tombs. Then one day a letter arrived from home, in which he
read of the success achieved by Bao-yu and Jia Lan in their examinations - which gave
him great pleasure - and of Bao-yu’s disappearance, which disturbed him greatly and
made him decide to cut short his stay and hurry home. On his return journey he
learned of the amnesty decreed by the Emperor, and received another letter from
home telling him that Jia She and Cousin Zhen had been pardoned, and their titles
restored. Much cheered by this news, he pressed on towards home, travelling by day
and night.
   On the day when his boat reached the post-station at Piling, there was a sudden
cold tarn in the weather and it began to snow. He moored in a quiet, lonely stretch of
the canal and sent his servants ashore to deliver a few visiting-cards and to apologize
to his friends in the locality, saying that since his boat was due to set off again at any
moment he would not be able to call on them in person or entertain them aboard.
Only one page-boy remained to wait on him while he sat in the cabin writing a letter
home (to be sent on ahead by land). When he came to write about Bao-yu, he
paused for a moment and looked up. There, up on deck, standing in the very
entrance to his cabin and silhouetted dimly against the snow, was the figure of a man
with shaven head and bare feet, wrapped in a large cape made of crimson felt. The
figure knelt down and bowed to Jia Zheng, who did not recognize the features and
hurried out on deck, intending to raise him up and ask him his name. The man bowed
four times, and now stood upright, pressing his palms together in monkish greeting.
Jia Zheng was about to reciprocate with a respectful bow of the head when he looked
into the man’s eyes and with a sudden shock recog?nized him as Bao-yu.
   ‘Are you not my son?’ he asked.
   The man was silent and an expression that seemed to contain both joy and sorrow
played on his face. Jia Zheng asked again:
   ‘If you are Bao-yu, why are you dressed like this? And what brings you to this
place?’
   Before Bao-yu could reply two other men appeared on the deck, a Buddhist monk
and a Taoist, and holding him between them they said:
   ‘Come, your earthly karma is complete. Tarry no longer.’
   The three of them mounted the bank and strode off into the snow. Jia Zheng went
chasing after them along the slippery track, but although he could spy them ahead of
him, somehow they always remained just out of reach. He could hear all three of
them singing some sort of a song:
                  ‘On Greensickness Peak
I dwell;
In the Cosmic Void
  I roam.
  Who will pass over,
Who will go with me,
Who will explore
The supremely ineffable
  Vastly mysterious
Wilderness
To which I return!’

   Jia Zheng listened to the song and continued to follow them until they rounded the
slope of a small hill and suddenly vanished from sight. He was weak and out of
breath by now with the exertion of the chase, and greatly mystified by what he had
seen. Looking back he saw his page-boy, hurrying up behind him.
   ‘Did you see those three men just now?’ he questioned him.
   ‘Yes, sir, I did,’ replied the page. ‘I saw you following them, so I came too. Then
they disappeared and I could see no one but you.’
   Jia Zheng wanted to continue, but all he could see before him was a vast expanse
of white, with not a soul anywhere. He knew there was more to this strange
occurrence than he could understand, and reluctantly he turned back and began to
retrace his steps.
   The other servants had returned to their master’s boat to find the cabin empty and
were told by the boatman that Jia Zheng had gone on shore in pursuit of two monks
and a Taoist. They followed his footsteps through the snow and when they saw him
coming towards them in the distance hurried forward to meet him, and then all
returned to the boat together. Jia Zheng sat down to regain his breath and told them
what had happened. They sought his authority to mount a search for Bao-yu in the
area, but Jia Zheng dismissed the idea.
    ‘You do not understand,’ he said with a sigh. ‘This was indeed no supernatural
apparition; I saw these men with my own eyes. I heard them singing, and the words
of their song held a most profound and mysterious meaning. Bao-yu came into the
world with his jade, and there was always something strange about it. I knew it for an
ill omen. But because his grandmother doted on him so, we nurtured him and
brought him up until now. That monk and that Taoist I have seen before, three times
altogether. The first time was when they came to extol the virtues of the jade; the
second was when Bao-yu was seriously ill and the monk came and said a prayer over
the jade, which seemed to cure Bao-yu at once; the third time was when he restored
the jade to us after it had been lost. He was sitting in the hall one minute, and the
next he had vanished completely. I thought it strange at the time and could only
conclude that perhaps Bao-yu was In some way blessed and that these two holy men
had come to protect him. But the truth of the matter must be that he himself is a
being from a higher realm who has descended into the world to experience the trials
of this human life. For these past nineteen years he has been doted on in vain by his
poor grandmother! Now at last I understand!’
   As he said these words, tears came to his eyes.
   ‘But surely,’ protested one of the servants, ‘if Mr Bao was really a Buddhist
Immortal, what need was there for him to bother with passing his exams before
disappearing?’
   ‘How can you ever hope to understand these things?’ replied Jia Zheng with a sigh.
‘The constellations in the heavens, the hermits in their hills, the spirits in their caves,
each has a particular configura?tion, a unique temperament. When did you ever see
Bao-yu willingly work at his books? And yet if once he applied himself, nothing was
beyond his reach. His temperament was certainly unique.’
   In an effort to restore his spirits, the servants turned the conversa?tion to Jia Lan’s
success in the exams and the revival of the family fortunes. Then Jia Zheng
completed and sealed his letter, in which he related his encounter with Bao-yu and
instructed the family not to brood over their loss too much, and despatched one of
the servants to deliver it to Rong-guo House while he himself continued his journey
by boat. But of this no more.

*

When Aunt Xue heard of the general amnesty pronounced by the Emperor she sent
Xue Ke to borrow money from wherever he could, to add to what she herself had
collected for Xue Pan’s commutation fine. The Board of Justice finally gave its
approval and agreed to receive the money in settlement, whereupon an official
document was issued authorizing Xue Pan’s release. When he was reunited with his
family, there was a great deal of news for him to catch up on, some of it sad, some
more cheerful. But this we can safely leave to the reader’s imagination. Xue Pan for
his part uttered a solemn vow:
   ‘If I ever behave like that again, may I be hacked to death piece by piece!’
   Aunt Xue held her hand over his mouth:
   ‘Just make your mind up to mend your ways! There’s no need for all these
blood-curdling oaths! But what are you going to do about Caltrop? Jin-gui died by her
own hand, and though we may be poor, you can still afford to fill her place. After all
Caltrop has been through on your account, I think you owe it to her to make her your
proper wife. What do you think?’
   Xue Pan nodded his head in consent, while Bao-chai gave Aunt Xue’s Suggestion
her full support. Caltrop herself seemed over?whelmed and flushed a deep crimson:
   ‘It’s the same to me if I continue to serve Mr Pan,’ she said. ‘There’s no need to
change things.’
   From then on all the servants began calling her Mrs Pan, and looked up to her with
great respect.
   Xue Pan next went to call on the Jias and offered them his thanks for all that they
had done. He was accompanied by his mother and Bao-chai, and there was quite a
family gathering at Rong-guo House. Greetings were exchanged, and they were still
chatting when a messenger arrived and presented the letter which Jia Zheng had
written on the boat.
   ‘The Master will be arriving in a matter of days,’ he reported.
Lady Wang told Jia Lan to read the letter out aloud. When he reached the passage
where Jia Zheng described his encounter with Bao-yu, they all wept bitterly, Lady
Wang, Bao-chai and Aroma most bitterly of all. Then they listened as Jia Lan read out
Jia Zheng’s words of advice, that they were not to grieve but to understand that this
was Bao-yu’s destiny, that he was the reincarnation of a Buddhist Immortal.
   ‘If he had ever risen to become an official and his career had then ended in disaster,
it would have been much worse,’ they consoled themselves. ‘That would have meant
public condemnation and ruin. Better that we should at least enjoy the honour of
having had a holy man in the family. After all, it was his own father’s and mother’s
karma, their virtue, that enabled him to be born into this family. Without wishing to
be disrespectful, even Sir Jing from Ning-guo House who practised yoga all those
years failed to become an Im?mortal. Bao-yu’s is no mean achievement. If you think
of it in this light, Auntie’ (referring to Lady Wang), ‘it should be possible to have an
easier mind.’
   ‘Do you think I hold it against Bao-yu that he has abandoned me?’ sobbed Lady
Wang to Aunt Xue. ‘No, what grieves me is the thought of his wife’s unhappy fate.
After little more than a year of marriage, how could he be so unfeeling as to desert
her like this?’
   Aunt Xue found this quite heart-rending, while Bao-chai had already wept herself
into a faint. Since all the menfolk had adjourned to the front hall, Lady Wang
continued to pour her heart out to her sister:
   ‘After all the alarms and excursions I had to endure on his behalf, I finally had the
comfort of seeing him marry and pass his exams, and could even look forward to the
birth of a grandchild. And now this! If I’d known it would end like this I would never
have let him marry in the first place! I would never have let him bring such
unhappiness on the poor girl!’
   ‘These things are all decreed by fate,’ Aunt Xue consoled her. ‘What else could we
possibly have said or done in the circumstances? We must count ourselves blessed
that my daughter is with child, and that you will have a grandchild. I am sure that he
at least will do well and bring some good out of all this. Look at Li Wan: her son has
passed his Provincial examination, and no doubt next year young Lan will go on to
become a Palace Graduate and an official. After all that his mother has suffered, now
at last she can reap her reward. As for my daughter, you know that she is not a fickle
or flighty girl. You have no cause to worry on her account.’
   Lady Wang found her sister’s words convincing and reassuring.
   ‘Bao-chai was always so demure and restrained as a child,’ she reflected to herself.
‘Always fond of plain, simple things. Perhaps that is why she has ended up in this
predicament. Perhaps everything in this world really is fated! Though Chai has wept a
great deal, she has never lost her sense of dignity. In fact she has even on occasion
tried to comfort me. What a rare girl she is! So unlike her poor husband, who clearly
was not meant for any joy in this world.’
   Comforted somewhat by these thoughts, Lady Wang turned her mind to Aroma:
   ‘None of the other maids presents much of a problem. The older ones can be
married off, the younger ones can continue to wait on Bao-chai. But what am I to do
with Aroma?’
   She did not feel she could raise such a sensitive matter at a large family gathering,
and decided to wait until the evening when she could discuss it privately with her
sister.
   Aunt Xue did not go home that night but stayed to comfort Bao-chai, afraid she
might weep to excess. But in the end, as it turned out, Bao-chai was extremely
reasonable. She reflected stoically on the whole course of events and concluded that
since Bao-yu had always been a very strange creature, and since no doubt all that
had happened had been preordained, there was little point in fighting against it. She
expressed this in a very level-headed way to her mother, who was most relieved to
hear her adopt this attitude and communicated it to Lady Wang when she next saw
her. Lady Wang nodded and sighed:
   ‘If I really were a wicked woman, fate would never have given me such a wonderful
daughter-in-law!’
   She started to become tearful again, and Aunt Xue tried to calm her down. She
brought up the subject of Aroma:
   ‘She has grown so terribly thin of late. All she ever does is brood about Bao-yu. It’s
right and proper for a wife to exhibit loyalty to her husband, even when he is a true
husband to her no longer. And a chamber-wife may do the same if she wishes. But
Aroma was never formally declared to be Ba-yu’s chamber-wife, even though in fact
we know that she was.’
   ‘Yes, I was thinking about this only a short while ago,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I was
waiting for a chance to talk it over with you in private. If we simply dismiss her from
service, I’m afraid she won’t want to go, and may even try to take her own life. We
could keep her on, but I am afraid Sir Zheng would not approve. It is a tricky
problem.’
   ‘I hardly think Sir Zheng would want her to remain single and make a show of
faithfulness to Bao-yu,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘He doesn’t even know that she was Bao-yu’s
chamber-wife. He has always thought of her as just an ordinary maid, so it would
seem rather absurd to him to want to keep her on. The only solution is for you to
send for a member of her own family and impress upon them the importance of
arranging a decent marriage for her. We can give her a generous send-off. She is a
good-natured girl and still quite young. You should do what you can for her after all
the years she has worked for you. Let me explain things carefully to her. There’s no
need to let her know straight away. First we should get in touch with her family and
let them arrange a match; next we should make some enquiries ourselves; and then
if it seems that the prospective husband’s family are in a position to support her
properly, and if the young man himself seems suitable, we can let her leave and get
married.’
   ‘That’s a very good idea. You’ve thought it all out very well,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘If
we do not take the initiative, Sir Zheng may go ahead himself and deal with her in a
very tactless way, and then I will be responsible for yet another misfortune.’
   ‘Exactly the same thought had occurred to me,’ said Aunt Xue nodding her head.
   After they had chatted a while longer, Aunt Xue took her leave and went to
Bao-chai’s apartment. She found Aroma in floods of tears and did her best to console
her, speaking so far as possible in vague generalities. Aroma was at heart a simple girl
and not much of a talker, and she merely gave the appropriate responses to whatever
Aunt Xue said.
   ‘I am only a servant,’ she said in the end, ‘and it is very kind of you to think to
speak to me like this, ma’am. I have never dared to go against any wish of Her
Ladyship’s.’
   ‘There’s a good girl!’ said Aunt Xue, more pleased than ever with her. Bao-chai
added a few high-sounding words of her own and when she and Aunt Xue parted
from Aroma their minds were considerably more at ease.
*

A few days later Jia Zheng came home and was greeted on his arrival by all the family.
Jia She and Cousin Zhen had also returned from their exile by now, and they spent
some time with Jia Zheng, catching up on each other’s news. Then Jia Zheng went in
to see the womenfolk. Bao-yu’s absence cast a shadow of gloom over the gathering,
which Jia Zheng tried to dispel as best he could.
   ‘There was a reason behind all this!’ he said. ‘It is up to us men now to maintain a
high standard of public life, and I hope that all of you meanwhile will lend us your
support here at home. There must be no hint of any slipping back into the lax old
ways. Each apartment can look after its own affairs, and we’ve no need of a general
manager. Everything in our own apartment I leave to you’ (this was addressed to Lady
Wang), ‘to deal with in a fitting manner.’
   Lady Wang informed him that Bao-chai was with child, and that all Bao-yu’s maids
would be dismissed. Jia Zheng nodded in silence.
   The following day he attended court to receive his instructions from the chief
ministers.
   ‘I am extremely grateful for His Majesty’s gracious favour,’ he said. ‘But since this is
still within my period of mourning, I beg you to instruct me how I should express my
gratitude.’
   The ministers offered to present a memorial on his behalf. The Emperor most
magnanimously granted Jia Zheng a special audience, and after listening to his formal
expression of thanks favoured him with several Imperial instructions and enquired
after his son, the successful Provincial Graduate. Jia Zheng told him the full story of
Bao-yu’s disppearance. The Emperor marvelled at it and declared that Bao-yu’s
compositions had indeed manifested a remarkable originality, the very quality one
would expect of a soul from another plane. Such a person could have excelled at
court if such had been his destiny; but since he had not deigned to earn honours of a
worldly nature, it was His Majesty’s pleasure to confer upon him the religious title
Magister Verbi Profundi - Master of the Profound Word.
   Jia Zheng kowtowed again to express his thanks for this great honour, and took his
leave. On his return home he was received by Jia Lian and Cousin Zhen, who were
delighted to hear the latest news from court.
   ‘Ning-guo House has been set in order,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘and with your consent
we intend to take up residence there again. Green Bower Hermitage in the Garden
has been set aside for my sister Xi?-chun’s devotions.’
   After a pause for reflection Jia Zheng gave them a long homily on their debt of
gratitude to the throne for all these favours. Jia Lian took the opportunity of raising
the issue of his daughter’s marriage:
   ‘Both Mother and Father are wiffing that Qiao-jie should be married to this Master
Zhou.’
   Jia Zheng had heard the full details of Qiao-jie’s story the previous evening, and
replied:
   ‘If that is their decision, then so be it. There is nothing against a country life. What
matters is that the family should be an honest one and the lad should be prepared to
study and make his way in the world. Not every official at court is from a city family,
after all.’
   Jia Lian replied appropriately and continued:
   ‘Father is advanced in years, and is moreover afflicted with a chronic phlegmatic
condition. He plans to retire for a few years and leave everything in your hands,
Uncle.’
‘A quiet retirement in the country would suit me well enough,’ commented Jia
Zheng. ‘But alas my obligations to the throne do not permit it.’
   Jia Zheng went into see Lady Wang, while Jia Lian sent someone to invite Grannie
Liu over. When she was informed that the match had been approved by the Master,
she proceeded to favour Lady Wang and the other ladies with a long speech on the
certain future success of the young man, how his family was sure to come up in the
world, and what a prosperous multitude of sons and grandsons the couple were sure
to breed.
   While she was talking one of the maids came in to announce that Hua Zi-fang,
Aroma’s brother, had sent his wife to convey his res?pects. Lady Wang spoke to the
woman and ascertained from her that a match had been proposed by the Hua family
to a certain Mr Jiang living south of the city, a young man with property and land and
a pawnshop business of his own. He was a few years older than Aroma but had never
married and was exceptionally good-looking. Lady Wang was satisfied with this
description of the match.
   ‘Tell them I agree,’ she said. ‘In a few days’ time your husband can come and fetch
his sister and take her away to be married.’
   She also sent some of her own people to make discreet enquiries, and received
confirmation of the man’s character, whereupon she informed Bao-chai, and asked
Aunt Xue to break the news gently to Aroma. Poor Aroma was inconsolable at the
prospect of leaving Rong-guo House, but she could not offer any resistance. She
remembered the visit Bao-yu had paid her at home many years pre?viously, and the
oath she had sworn afterwards, never to leave him even in death. ‘Now Her Ladyship
is making me do this against my will, and if I insist on remaining single and faithful to
his memory, people will call me shameless. But if I do go, it is not of my own wishing.’
   She wept until she was choking with tears. Aunt Xue and Bao-chai did their utmost
to talk her round, and eventually she thought to herself:
   ‘If I were to die here, it would be a poor return for all Her Ladyship’s kindness to
me in the past. I had best die at home.’
   So she bade farewell to them all, her heart heavy with sorrow. It was equally
painful for her to part from the other maids. Resolved to end her own life at the first
opportunity, she mounted a carriage and set off for home. When she saw her brother
and his wife, there were more tears, but she could not bring herself to say what was
on her mind. Her brother showed her one by one all the presents sent by the Jiang
family, and the trousseau that he himself had made ready for her, a part of which, he
explained, had been given by Lady Wang, while a part he had provided himself. This
kindness made it harder than ever for Aroma to express her sorrow, and after
spending two days at her brother’s home, she thought things over carefully again:
‘He has done everything so nicely for me. If I were to die here, wouldn’t I be hurting
him?’ She turned it over and over in her mind, and no course of action seemed easy
and right. Her heart was wound into a tight knot. She could only bear her fate
stoically and bide her time.

   The auspicious day in the almanac arrived for her to be taken to her husband’s
home, and not wishing to make a scene she concealed her grief and let herself be
helped into the bridal sedan. At her new home, she thought to herself, she would
make plans afresh. But once she arrived at the Jiang household, she found them so
sincere and respectful towards her, deferring to her in every way as a young married
lady, with the maids and serving-women all calling her Mrs Jiang the minute she set
foot in the house, that death seemed im?possible again: to die there would be to do
them a great injury, she thought to herself; it would be a poor return for all their
kindness. On her wedding night she wept without ceasing and would not at first yield
to her husband’s embrace, but gradually he won her over with gentle affection.
   The next day, when they were unpacking her cases together, Jiang noticed among
her things a crimson cummerbund. From this clue he deduced that his bride must
have been one of the maids in attendance on Bao-yu, to whom he had once
presented this cummerbund. Earlier he had thought that his bride was just one of
Grandmother Jia’s maids; he had certainly never dreamed that he was marrying
Aroma. Jiang Yu-han (for it was he, Bao-yu’s actor friend Bijou) was greatly moved
when he remembered all the warmth shown him by Bao-yu in the past, and as a
consequence he treated Aroma with stlil greater courtesy and consideration. He
showed her the viridian sash that Bao-yu had given him in exchange for the
cummerbund, and this visible proof of her hushand’s friendship with her erstwhile
master inspired Aroma to believe that her life too lay in the hands of fate, that this
marriage was indeed predestined. This in turn gave her the courage to open her
heart to her husband. Jiang proved himself worthy of her trust and showed her a
great depth of feeling and a sincere respect, never venturing to steer her forcibly into
any new direction, but showing her an ever more gentle affection and regard. Aroma
was finally deprived of her last opportunity to take her own life.
   Gentle Reader, it is indeed true (as Aroma concluded) that life is predestined and
that ‘there’s naught to be done’. But unfortunately this argument is too often
adduced by sons and statesmen who find themselves out of favour, or by faithful
widows and widowers, as an excuse for moral torpor. It was this very streak in her
personality that relegated Aroma to the ‘Second Supplementary Register’. As a poet
of former times once wrote, when passing by the temple built in memory of the Lady
of the Peach Blossom:

                    Throughout the ages death has been the hardest choice;
                    Lady Xi was not alone in lamenting her weakness.*

  (* in the Spring and Autumn period, King Wen of the state of Chu (ruled 689-676
BC) defeated and put to death the ruler of the state of Xi. He then took the Lord Xi’s
widow as his concubine and had two sons by her. She refused to communicate
verbally with her new master, however, and when King Wen asked her the reason for
her silence she eventually replied: ‘I, a widow, now serve a second husband. Having
thus failed to seek death, what is there that I can say?’)

Aroma’s married life is the first chapter of another history. Our narrative returns to
Jia Yu-cun, who, having been convicted of avarice and extortion, was also released
under the general amnesty and allowed to return to his native city as a common
citizen. He sent his family on ahead and himself travelled with a young page and a
cartload of baggage. His journey brought him once more to Wake Ness Ferry at
Rushford Hythe, and as he approached the river he saw a Taoist hermit emerging
from a thatched hut by the water’s edge, clasping his hands in greeting. This time
Yu-cun recognized him at once as Zhen Shi-yin and promptly bowed in response.
   ‘Esteemed Mr Jia,’ began the old hermit, ‘I trust you have been well since we last
parted?’
   ‘So you, sir, are indeed my erstwhile patron Mr Zhen, in Immortal form!’ exclaimed
Yu-cun. ‘Why did I not know you at our last encounter? Afterwards, when I heard
that your hermitage had been destroyed by fire, I was most concerned for your safety.
I am for?tunate indeed to have been granted this second opportunity to marvel at
the profundity of your spiritual attainments. Alas, I am as be?nighted as ever, as you
can see from my present condition.’
   ‘On the previous occasion,’ replied Zhen Shi-yin, ‘your position was so exalted that
I dared not presume an acquaintance. Because of our old friendship, I said a few
words, which you ignored altogether. Wealth and poverty, success and failure, none
of these are coinci?dental. Nor is our meeting again like this today a coincidence, but
rather a meaningful and marvellous event. We are not far from my lodge and I would
be delighted if you could stop by and pass the time of day with me.’
   Jia Yu-cun consented with pleasure and the two men walked hand in hand, the
page following them with the baggage-cart to the little thatched hermitage. Shi-yin
ushered Yu-cun in, and he sat down and was brought tea by the old man’s acolyte.
Yu-cun asked to hear the story of his mystical conversion, and Shi-yin smiled:
   ‘In an instant my world was transformed. You yourself, sir, hailing as you do from
the realm of luxury and opulence, must surely have heard there of a person by the
name of Bao-yu?’
   ‘Of course,’ replied Yu-cun. ‘Recently I heard a rumour to the effect that he too has
taken refuge in the dharma. I saw something of him in the past and it certainly never
occurred to me that he would take a step like this.’
   ‘There is nothing unexpected about it,’ said Shi-yin. ‘I have known of his strange
destiny for many years. Ever since that day long ago, in fact, when I met you outside
my abode in Carnal Lane and we had that little chat. I had already encountered him
then.’
   ‘But the capital is a long way from your old home,’ said Yu-cun in great surprise.
‘How could you possibly have set eyes on him at that time?’
   ‘We had long enjoyed a spiritual communion,’ replied Shi-yin darkly.
   ‘In that case, sir, you must know of his present whereabouts?’
   ‘Bao-yu,’ replied the old man, ‘is the Stone, the Precious Jade. Before the two
mansions of Rong and Ning were searched and their worldly goods impounded, on
the very day when Bao-chai and Dai-yu were separated, the Stone had already quit
the world. This was in part to avoid the impending calamity, in part to permit the
con?summation of the union. From that moment the Stone’s worldly karma was
complete, its substance had returned to the Great Unity. All that remained was for it
to demonstrate some small fraction of its spiritual powers by achieving academic
distinction and by leaving behind an heir to bring honour to the family name. Thus its
precious nature, its magical power, its capacity for spiritual transformation, these
were made manifest, and all could know that it was no ordinary stone of this world.
To this end the Buddhist mahāsattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso
first brought it into the world, and now that its destiny is fulfilled it is they who will
take it back once more to its place of origin. That is the sum of my knowledge
concerning Bao-yu and, as you put it, his “present whereabouts”.’
   Although Yu-cun could not take all of this in, he was able to follow about half. He
nodded his head and sighed:
   ‘So that is the truth of the matter. And I never knew. But if Bao-yu is a person of
such a remarkable spiritual pedigree, why did he first need to be blinded by human
passion before he could reach enlightenment?’
   Shi-yin smiled:
   ‘Even though I may seek to expound this, I fear you may never be able to
understand it fully. The Land of Illusion and the Paradise of Truth are one and the
same. Could two readings of the registers and a whole lifetime’s experience fail to
bring enlightenment? Could he fail to see the Alpha and the Omega? If the Fairy
Flower regained its true primordial state, then surely the Magic Stone should do
like?wise?’
   This time the hermit’s words were truly beyond Yu-cun’s powers of comprehension.
He knew only that they must contain some esoteric meaning, and did not venture to
probe any further.
   ‘It is so kind of you to tell me all this about Bao-yu,’ he said. ‘But may I ask you
another question: why is it that of all the ladies in these noble families, none,
including Her Grace the Imperial Jia Concubine, has come to more than an
undistinguished end?’
   On hearing this Shi-yin sighed:
   ‘Do not take my words amiss, sir! The fact of the matter is that all these noble
ladies to whom you refer hail from the Skies of Passion and the Seas of Retribution.
Since olden times their sex has been under a natural obligation to remain pure, pure
from lust, pure even from the slightest taint of passion. Thus amorous beauties such
as Cui Ying-ying and Su Xiao-xiao were fallen fairies, their celestial hearts polluted
with the base desires of this world, while romantic poets such as Song Yu and Si-ma
Xiang-ru sinned in like manner through the written word. Consider for a moment:
how can any being ensnared in human attachment hope to “come to more than an
undistinguished end”, as you put it?’
   As he listened to the hermit’s words, Jia Yu-cun found himself stroking his beard
meditatively and heaving a long sigh.
   ‘May I ask, sir,’ he ventured, ‘whether the Ning and Rong houses will ever rise
again to their former heights of prosperity?’
   ‘It is preordained that prosperity comes with virtue, and calamity with evil,’ replied
Shi-yin. ‘At present in these two houses the vir?tuous have turned to the true path,
while the wicked have at least repented of their ways. In time to come, orchid and
cassia will bloom, and the family fortunes will indeed prosper again. This is natural
and right.’
   Yu-cun lowered his head in thought for a while, then suddenly laughed:
   ‘Yes! Of course! There is one among them called Lan (Orchid), who has recently
passed his examinations. As for the cassia you mention, could this be in some way
connected with what you said earlier about Bao-yu achieving academic distinction
and leaving behind a creditable heir? Is his posthumous son a Jia Gui (Cassia)
destined for glory?’
   Shi-yin gave an inscrutable smile:
   ‘Time will show. It would be wrong to make predictions about this now.
   Yu-cun had still more questions to ask, but Shi-yin was clearly unwilling to provide
any further replies. He told his boy to lay the table and bring in the food, and invited
Yu-cun to eat with him. When they had finished their meal, Yu-cun was still curious,
this time wanting to know the secrets of his own future; but his luck had run out.
   ‘Rest awhile, sir,’ said Shi-yin, ‘in my humble hermitage. I still have a duty to
perform, and today is the day for its completion.’
   This took Yu-cun by surprise:
   ‘In view of the exalted spiritual state you have achieved, I cannot conceive what
karma can remain for you to fulfil?’
   ‘It concerns the love between a man and a woman.’
   This amazed Yu-cun even more.
   ‘Pray explain, sir.’
   ‘There is something of which you are ignorant, my respected friend,’ replied Shi-yin.
‘My daughter Ying-lian was, as you know, kidnapped when she was a little girl. You
yourself gave judgement in the case when you first held office. Now she is married to
a certain Mr Xue and is about to give birth to his child. In so doing she will die. She
will leave behind her a son to continue the Xue family’s ancestral rites. Now is the
moment for her earthly life to cease, and I must be at hand to receive her spirit.
   With a shake of his sleeve Shi-yin was gone. Yu-cun began to feel very dozy and
had soon fallen asleep in the little hermitage at Wake Ness Ferry by Rushford Hythe.
   Shi-yin went to receive Caltrop’s soul across the threshold of death and to escort
her to the Land of Illusion, there to be handed over to the Fairy Disenchantment and
to have her name entered on the register. As he passed through the great archway he
saw the monk and the Taoist drifting towards him, and approaching them he said:
   ‘Mahaisattva! Illuminate! My felicitations! Is the love karma ful?filled? Have all
those souls involved been duly returned and entered in the registers?’
   ‘The karma is not yet complete,’ they replied. ‘But that senseless Block has already
returned. Now all that remains is to restore it to its place of origin and to record the
last instalment of its story. Then its little trip into the world will not have been in
vain.’
   Shi-yin clasped both hands together in salutation and took his leave. The monk and
the Taoist continued on their way bearing the jade, until finally they came to the foot
of Greensickness Peak and there, in the very place where Nu-wa had once smelted
her fiery amalgam to repair the vault of Heaven, they carefully deposited their
burden and each drifted off on his way.

An otherworldy tome recounts an otherworldly tale,
As Man and Stone become once more a single whole.
5
One day Vanitas the Taoist passed again by Greensickness Peak and saw the Stone
‘that had been found unfit to repair the heavens’, lying there still, with characters
inscribed on it as before. He read the inscription through carefully again and noticed
that a whole new section had been appended to the gātha with which the earlier
version concluded. This new material provided several dénouements and tied up
various loose ends in the plot, completing the overall design of fate that underlay the
original story.
   ‘When I first saw this strange tale of Brother Stone’s I thought it worth publishing
as a novel and copied it down for that purpose. But at the time it was unfinished; the
cycle within it was incomplete. There was in the earlier version none of this material
relating the Stone’s return to the source. I wonder when this rather admirable last
instalment can have been added? From it the reader can indeed see that Brother
Stone’s experience of life sharpened the edge of his spiritual perception, and brought
him to a more complete awareness of the Tao. At the end he had no cause for
remorse or regret. But with the passing of the years the characters of this new
version of the inscription may wear away and be misread. I had better copy it down
again in this complete form and find someone in the world with leisure on his hands
to publish it and transmit its message: that things are not as they seem, that the
extraordinary and the ordinary, truth and fiction, are all relative to each other.
Perhaps my fellow humans whom the dream of life has ensnared may find in this tale
an echo, may be summoned back by it to their true home; while free spirits of the
high hills may find in the record of Brother Stone’s transformations, as in that older
tale of the Migration of the Magic Mountain, a reflected light to quicken their own
aspirations.’
   So Vanitas copied it all down and slipping this new version into his sleeve took it
off with him to the luxurious, opulent world of men, to seek out a suitable mortal for
the task of publication. But all the men he encountered were either too busy
establishing them?selves in their careers, or else too preoccupied with their
day-to-day survival, to have the leisure or inclination to prattle with a Stone. Then at
last Vanitas came to the little hermitage at Wake Ness Ferry by Rushford Hythe; there
he found a man asleep (from which he deduced him to be a man of leisure) and
thought he would give him this Story of the Stone to read. But however many times
he called out, he could not rouse him from his slumber. Eventually he heaved him up
and gave him a good shake, and the man slowly opened his eyes. He skimmed
through the book and let it fall from his hand; saying:
   ‘I have seen all this myself at first-hand. As far as I can see your record contains no
errors. Allow me to tell you of a man who can transmit this story to the world on
your behalf, and by so doing bring this strange affair to a proper conclusion.’
   ‘Whom do you mean?’ asked Vanitas eagerly.
   ‘You must wait until the year_, the_ day of the_month. At the_hour, you must go
to a certain Nostalgia Studio, where you will find a certain Mr Cao Xue-qin. Just tell
him: “Jia Yu-cun says...” and ask him to do such-and-such and so forth...’
   Yu-cun dozed off again, and Vanitas made a careful note of his instructions. Sure
enough, after an incalculable number of genera?tions, an infinity of aeons, there was
indeed a Nostalgia Studio and in it a Mr Cao Xue-qin, perusing the histories of bygone
days. Vanitas did as he had been instructed; he repeated Yu-cun’s words and handed
him the Story of the Stone to read. This Mr Cao smiled and said:
   ‘Rustic fiction indeed (Jia Yu Cun Yan)!’
   ‘How is it that you know the man, sir? May I deduce from this that you are willing
to transmit this tale for him?’
   ‘You are aptly named Vanitas,’ exclaimed Cao. ‘You have a Nothing in your Belly, a
very Vanity. These may be rustic words, but they contain no careless errors or
nonsensical passages. It would be a pleasure to share this with a few like-minded
friends, to help the wine down after a meal or to while away the solitude of a rainy
evening by a lamplit window. No need for some self-important being to commend it
or publish it. You in your insistence on ferreting out facts are like the man who
dropped his sword in the water and thought to find it again by making a mark on the
side of his boat; you are like a man playing a zither with the tuning-pegs glued fast.’
   Vanitas lifted his head and guffawed at this, dropped the manu?script to the
ground and went breezily on his way. As he went he said to himself:
   ‘So it was really all utter nonsense! Author, copyist and reader were alike in the
dark! Just so much ink splashed for fun, a game, a diversion!’
   A later reader of the manuscript added a four-line gātha, to expand a little on the
author’s original envoi:
When grief for fiction’s idle words
More real than human life appears,
Reflect that life itself’s a drearm
And do not mock the reader’s tears.
