CHAPTER 1



Zhen Shi-yin makes the Stone’s
acquaintance in a dream
And Jia Yu-cun finds that poverty is not incompatible
with romantic feelings

GENTLE READER,



What, you may ask, was the origin of this book?
Though the answer to this question may at first seem to border on the absurd,
reflection will show that there is a good deal more in it than meets the eye.
     Long ago, when the goddess Nǚ-wa was repairing the sky, she melted down a
great quantity of rock and, on the Incredible Crags of the Great Fable Mountains,
moulded the amalgam into thirty-six thousand, five hundred and one large building
blocks, each measuring seventy-two feet by a hundred and forty-four feet square.
She used thirty-six thousand five hundred of these blocks in the course of her
building operations, leaving a single odd block unused, which lay, all on its own, at
the foot of Greensickness Peak in the aforementioned mountains.
    Now this block of stone, having undergone the melting and molding of a goddess,
possessed magic powers. It could move about at will and could grow or shrink to any
size it wanted. Observing that all the other blocks had been used for celestial repairs
and that it was the only one to have been rejected as unworthy, it became filled with
shame and resentment and passed its days in sorrow and lamentation.
     One day, in the midst of its lamenting, it saw a monk and a Taoist approaching
from a great distance, each of them remarkable for certain eccentricities of manner
and appearance. When they arrived at the foot of Greensickness Peak, they sat down
on the ground and began to talk. The monk, catching sight of a lustrous, translucent
stone—it was in fact the rejected building block which had now shrunk itself to the
size of a fan-pendant and looked very attractive in its new shape—took it up on the
palm of his hand and addressed it with a smile:
‘Ha, I see you have magical properties! But nothing to recommend you. I shall have
to cut a few words on you so that anyone seeing you will know at once that you are
something special. After that I shall take you to a certain
brilliant
successful
poetical
cultivated
aristocratic
elegant
delectable
luxurious
opulent
locality on a little trip.’
The stone was delighted.
‘What words will you cut? Where is this place you will take me to? I beg to be
enlightened.’
‘Do not ask,’ replied the monk with a laugh. ‘You will know soon enough when the
time comes.’
And with that he slipped the stone into his sleeve and set off at a great pace with the
Taoist. But where they both went to I have no idea.

*

Countless aeons went by and a certain Taoist called Vanitas in quest of the secret of
immortality chanced to be passing below that same Greensickness Peak in the
Incredible Crags of the Great Fable Mountains when he caught sight of a large stone
standing there, on which the characters of a long in?scription were clearly
discernible.
Vanitas read the inscription through from beginning to end and learned that this was
a once lifeless stone block which had been found unworthy to repair the sky, but
which had magi?cally transformed its shape and been taken down by the Buddhist
mahāsattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso into the world of
mortals, where it had lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and
re?turning to the other shore. The inscription named the country where it had been
born, and went into considerable detail about its domestic life, youthful amours, and
even the verses, mottoes and riddles it had written. All it lacked was the
authentication of a dynasty and date. On the back of the stone was inscribed the
following quatrain:
Found unfit to repair the azure sky
Long years a foolish mortal man was I.
My life in both worlds on this stone is writ:
Pray who will copy out and publish it?

From his reading of the inscription Vanitas realized that this was a stone of some
consequence. Accordingly he addressed himself to it in the following manner:
‘Brother Stone, according to what you yourself seem to imply in these verses, this
story of yours contains matter of sufficient interest to merit publication and has been
carved here with that end in view. But as far as I can see (a) it has no discoverable
dynastic period, and (b) it contains no examples of moral grandeur among its
characters—no statesmanship, no social message of any kind. All I can find in it, in
fact, are a number of females, conspicuous, if at all, only for their passion or folly or
for some trifling talent or insignificant virtue. Even if I were to copy all this out, I
cannot see that it would make a very remarkable book.’
‘Come, your reverence,' said the stone (for Vanitas had been correct in assuming
that it could speak) ‘must you be so obtuse? All the romances ever written have an
artificial period setting—Han or Tang for the most part. In refusing to make use of
that stale old convention and telling my Story of the Stone exactly as it occurred, it
seems to me that, far from depriving it of anything, I have given it a freshness these
other books do not have.
‘ Your so-called “historical romances”, consisting, as they do, of scandalous
anecdotes about statesmen and emperors of bygone days and scabrous attacks on
the reputations of long-dead gentlewomen, contain more wickedness and immorality
than I care to mention. Still worse is the “erotic novel”, by whose filthy obscenities
our young folk are all too easily corrupted. And the “boudoir romances”, those dreary
stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their
different characters undistinguishable except by name (all those ideally beautiful
young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors)— even they seem unable to avoid
descending sooner or later into indecency.
“The trouble with this last kind of romance is that it only gets written in the first
place because the author requires a framework in which to show off his love-poems.
He goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically, beginning with the
names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character, a servant or
the like, to make mischief between them, like the chou in a comedy.
‘What makes these romances even more detestable is the stilted, bombastic
language— inanities dressed in pompous rhetoric, remote alike from nature and
common sense and teeming with the grossest absurdities.
    ‘Surely my “number of females”, whom I spent half a lifetime studying with my
own eyes and ears, are preferable to this kind of stuff? I do not claim that they are
better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time; I am only
saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more
effective antidote to boredom and melancholy. And even the inelegant verses with
which my story is interlarded could serve to entertain and amuse on those convivial
occasions when rhymes and riddles are in demand.
     ‘All that my story narrates, the meetings and partings, the joys and sorrows, the
ups and downs of fortune, are recorded exactly as they happened. I have not dared
to add the tiniest bit of touching-up, for fear of losing the true picture.
     ‘My only wish is that men in the world below may some?times pick up this tale
when they are recovering from sleep or drunkenness, or when they wish to escape
from business worries or a fit of the dumps, and in doing so find not only mental
refreshment but even perhaps, if they will heed its lesson and abandon their vain and
frivolous pursuits, some small arrest in the deterioration of their vital forces. What
does your reverence say to that?’
     For a long time Vanitas stood lost in thought, pondering this speech. He then
subjected the Story of the stone to a careful second reading. He could see that its
main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events;
and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore
copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a
publisher.
     As a consequence of all this, Vanitas, starting off in the Void (which is Truth)
came to the contemplation of Form (which is Illusion); and from Form engendered
Passion; and by communicating Passion, entered again into Form; and from Form
awoke to the Void (which is Truth). He therefore changed his name from Vanitas to
Brother Amor, or the Passionate Monk, (because he had approached Truth by way of
Passion), and changed the title of the book from The Story of the S tone to The Tale
of Brother Amor.
     Old Kong Mei-xi from the homeland of Confucius called the book A Mirror for
the Romantic. Wu Yu-feng called it A Dream of Golden Days. Cao Xueqin in his
Nostalgia Studio worked on it for ten years, in the course of which he rewrote it no
less than five times, dividing it into chapters, composing chapter headings, renaming
it The Twelve Beauties of Jinling, and adding an introductory quatrain. Red Inkstone
restored the original title when he recopied the book and added his second set of
annotations to it.
     This, then, is a true account of how The Story of the Stone came to be written.
     Pages full of idle words
     Penned with hot and bitter tears:
     All men call the author fool;
    None his secret message hears.

*

The origin of The Story of the Stone has now been made clear. The same cannot,
however, be said of the characters and events which it recorded. Gentle reader, have
patience! This is how the inscription began:
     Long, long ago the world was tilted downwards towards the south-east; and in
that lower-lying south-easterly part of the earth there is a city called Soochow; and in
Soochow the district around the Chang-men Gate is reckoned one of the two or
three wealthiest and most fashionable quarters in the world of men. Outside the
Chang-men Gate is a wide thorough-fare called Worldly Way; and somewhere off
Worldly Way is an area called Carnal Lane. There is an old temple in the Carnal Lane
area which, because of the way it is bottled up inside a narrow cul-de-sac, is referred
to locally as Bottle-gourd Temple. Next door to Bottle-gourd Temple lived a
gentleman of private means called Zhen Shi-yin and his wife Feng-shi, a kind, good
woman with a profound sense of decency and decorum. The household was not a
particularly wealthy one, but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry
as the leading family in the neighbourhood.
     Zhen Shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totality unambitious person. He
devoted his time to his garden and to the pleasures of wine and poetry. Except for a
single flaw, his existence could, indeed, have been described as an idyllic one. The
flaw was that, although already past fifty, he had no son, only a little girl, just two
years old, whose name was Ying-lian.
     Once, during the tedium of a burning summer's day, Shi-yin was sitting idly in his
study. The book had slipped from his nerveless grasp and his head had nodded down
onto the desk in a doze. While in this drowsy state he seemed to drift off to some
place he could not identify, where he became aware of a monk and a Taoist walking
along and talking as they went.
     ‘Where do you intend to take that thing you are carrying?’ the Taoist was asking.
     ‘Don't you worry about him!’ replied the monk with a laugh. ‘There is a batch of
lovesick souls awaiting incarnation in the world below whose fate is due to be
decided this very day. I intend to take advantage of this opportunity to slip our little
friend in amongst them and let him have a taste of human life along with the rest.’
     ‘Well, well, so another lot of these amorous wretches is about to enter the vale
of tears,’ said the Taoist. ‘How did all this begin? And where are the souls to be
reborn?’
‘You will laugh when I tell you,’ said the monk. 'When this stone was left unused by
the goddess, he found himself at a loose end and took to wandering about all over
the place for want of better to do, until one day his wanderings took him to the place
where the fairy Disenchantment lives.
      ‘Now Disenchantment could tell that there was something unusual about this
stone, so she kept him there in her Sunset Glow Palace and gave him the honorary
title of Divine Luminescent Stone-in-Waiting in the Court of Sunset Glow.
      ‘But most of his time he spent west of Sunset Glow ex?ploring the banks of the
Magic River. There, by the Rock of Rebirth, he found the beautiful Crimson Pearl
Flower, for which he conceived such a fancy that he took to watering her every day
with sweet dew, thereby conferring on her the gift of life.
      ‘Crimson Pearl’s substance was composed of the purest cosmic essences, so she
was already half-divine; and now, thanks to the vitalizing effect of the sweet dew, she
was able to shed her vegetable shape and assume the form of a girl.
      ‘This fairy girl wandered about outside the Realm of Separation, eating the
Secret Passion Fruit when she was hungry and drinking from the Pool of Sadness
when she was thirsty. The consciousness that she owed the stone something for his
kindness in watering her began to prey on her mind and ended by becoming an
obsession.
      ‘ “I have no sweet dew here that I can repay him with,” she would say to herself.
“The only way in which I could perhaps repay him would be with the tears shed
during the whole of a mortal lifetime if he and I were ever to be reborn as humans in
the world below.”
      ‘Because of this strange affair, Disenchantment has got together a group of
amorous young souls, of which Crimson Pearl is one, and intends to send them down
into the world to take part in the great illusion of human life. And as to?day happens
to be the day on which this stone is fated to go into the world too, I am taking him
with me to Disenchant?ment’s tribunal for the purpose of getting him registered and
sent down to earth with the rest of these romantic creatures.’
     ‘How very amusing!’ said the Taoist. ‘I have certainly never heard of a debt of
tears before. Why shouldn’t the two of us take advantage of this opportunity to go
down into the world ourselves and save a few souls? It would be a work of merit.’
     ‘That is exactly what I was thinking,’ said the monk. ‘Come with me to
Disenchantment's palace to get this absurd creature cleared. Then, when this last
batch of romantic idiots goes down, you and I can go down with them. At present
about half have already been born. They await this last batch to make up the
number.’
     ‘Very good, I will go with you then,’ said the Taoist. Shi-yin heard all this
conversation quite clearly, and curiosity impelled him to go forward and greet the
two reverend gentlemen. They returned his greeting and asked him what he wanted.
     ‘It is not often that one has the opportunity of listening to a discussion of the
operations of karma such as the one I have just been privileged to overhear,’said
Shi-yin. ‘Unfortunately I am a man of very limited understanding and have not been
able to derive the full benefit from your conversation. If you would have the very
great kindness to enlighten my be?nighted understanding with a somewhat fuller
account of what you were discussing, I can promise you the most devout attention. I
feel sure that your teaching would have a salutary effect on me and—who
knows—might save me from the pains of hell.’
The reverend gentlemen laughed. ‘These are heavenly mysteries and may not be
divulged. But if you wish to escape from the fiery pit, you have only to remember us
when the time comes, and all will be well.’
     Shi-yin saw that it would be useless to press them. ‘Heavenly mysteries must not,
of course, be revealed. But might one perhaps inquire what the “absurd creature” is
that you were talking about? Is it possible that I might be allowed to see it?’
     ‘Oh, as for that,’said the monk: ‘I think it is on the cards for you to have a look at
him,’and he took the object from his sleeve and handed it to Shi-yin.
     Shi-yin took the object from him and saw that it was a clear, beautiful jade on
one side of which were carved the words ‘Magic Jade’. There were several columns of
smaller charac?ters on the back, which Shi-yin was lust going to examine more
closely when the monk, with a cry of ‘Here we are, at the frontier of Illusion’,
snatched the stone from him and disappeared, with the Taoist, through a big stone
archway above which

THE LAND OF ILLUSION

was written in large characters. A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed
vertically on either side of the arch:

Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true;
Real becomes not-teal where the unreal’s real.

    Shi-yin was on the point of following them through the archway when suddenly
a great clap of thunder seemed to shake the earth to its very foundations, making
him cry out in alarm.
    And there he was sitting in his study, the contents of his dream already half
forgotten, with the sun still blazing on the ever-rustling plantains outside, and the
wet-nurse at the door with his little daughter Ying-lian in her arms. Her delicate little
pink-and-white face seemed dearer to him than ever at that moment, and he
stretched out his arms to take her and hugged her to him.
     After playing with her for a while at his desk, he carried her out to the front of
the house to watch the bustle in the street. He was about to go in again when he saw
a monk and a Taoist approaching, the monk scabby-headed and barefoot, the Taoist
tousle-haired and limping. They were behaving like madmen, shouting with laughter
and gesticulating wildly as they walked along.
     When this strange pair reached Shi-yin’s door and saw him standing there
holding Ying-lian, the monk burst into loud sobs. ‘Patron,’ he said, addressing Shi-yin,
'what are you doing, holding in your arms that ill-fated creature who is destined to
involve both her parents in her own misfortune?'
Shi-yin realized that he was listening to the words of a madman and took no notice.
But the monk persisted:
‘Give her to me! Give her to me!’
Shi-yin was beginning to lose patience and clasping his little girl tightly to him, turned
on his heel and was about to re-enter the house when the monk pointed his finger at
him, roared with laughter, and then proceeded to intone the following verses:


‘Fond man, your pampered child to cherish so—
That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow!
Beware the high feast of the fifteenth day,
When all in smoke and fire shall pass away!’

Shi-yin heard all this quite plainly and was a little worried by it. He was thinking or
asking the monk what lay behind these puzzling words when he heard the Taoist say,
‘We don’t need to stay tether. Why don’t we part company here and each go about
his own business? Three kalpas from now I shall wait far you on Bei-mang Hill. Having
joined forces again there, we can go together to the Land of Illusion to sign off.’
‘Excellent!’said the other. And the two if them went off and soon were both lost to
sight.
'There must have been something behind all this, ‘thought Shi-yin to himself.’1 really
ought to have asked him what he meant, but now it is too late.'
He was still standing outside his door brooding when Jia Yu-cun, the poor student
who lodged at the Bottle-gourd Temple next door, came up to him. Yu-cun was a
native of Hu-zhou and came from a family of scholars and bureaucrats which had,
however, fallen on bad times when Yu-cun was born. The family fortunes on both his
father’s and mother’s side had all been spent, and the members of the family had
themselves gradually died off until only Yu-cun was left There were no prospects for
him in his home town, so he had set off for the capital, in search of fame and fortune.
Unfor?tunately he had got no further than Soochow when his funds ran out, and he
had now been living there in poverty for a year, lodging in this temple and keeping
himself alive by working as a copyist. For this reason Shi-yin saw a great deal of his
company.
     As soon as he caught sight of Shi-yin, Yu-cun clasped his hands in greeting and
smiled ingratiatingly. ‘I could see you standing there gazing, sir. Has anything been
happening in the street?’
     ‘No, no,’ said Shi-yin. ‘It just happened that my little girl was crying, so I brought
her out here to amuse her. Your coming is most opportune, dear boy. I was beginning
to feel most dreadfully bored. Won’t you come into my little den, and we can help
each other to while away this tedious hot day?’
     So saying, he called for a servant to take the child indoors, while he himself took
Yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study, where his boy served them both with
tea. But they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words before one of the servants
rushed in to say that ‘Mr Yan had come to pay a call.’ Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and
excused himself: ‘I seem to have brought you here under false pretences. I do hope
you will forgive me. If you don’t mind sitting on your own here for a moment, I shall
be with you directly.’
     Yu-cun rose to his feet too. ‘Please do not distress yourself on my account, sir. I
am a regular visitor here and can easily wait a bit.’ But by the time he had finished
saying this, Shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guest-room.
     Left to himself, Yu-cun was flicking through some of Shi?-yin’s books of poetry in
order to pass the time, when he heard a woman's cough outside the window.
Immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was. The cough appeared to
have come from a maid who was picking flowers in the garden. She was an unusually
good-looking girl with a rather refined face: not a great beauty, by any means, but
with something striking about her. Yu-cun gazed at her spellbound.
    Having now finished picking her flowers, this anonymous member of the Zhen
household was about to go in again when, on some sudden impulse, she raised her
head and caught sight of a man standing in the window. His hat was frayed and his
clothing threadbare; yet, though obviously poor, he had a fine, manly physique and
handsome, well-proportioned features.
    The maid hastened to remove herself from this male presence; but as she went
she thought to herself, ‘What a fine-looking man! But so shabby! The family hasn’t
got any friends or relations as poor as that. It must be that Jia Yu-cun the master is
always on about. No wonder he says that he won’t stay poor long. I remember
hearing him say that he’s often wanted to help him but hasn’t yet found an
opportunity.’ And thinking these thoughts she could not forbear to turn back for
another peep or two.
     Yu-cun saw her turn back and, at once assuming that she had taken a fancy to
him, was beside himself with delight. What a perceptive young woman she must be,
he thought, to have seen the genius underneath the rags! A real friend in trouble!
     After a while the boy came in again and Yu-cun elicited from him that the visitor
in the front room was now staying to dinner. It was obviously out of the question to
wait much longer, so he slipped down the passage-way at the side of the house and
let himself out by the back gate. Nor did Shi-yin invite him round again when, having
at last seen off his visitor, he learned that Yu-cun had already left.
     But then the Mid Autumn festival arrived and, after the family convivialities were
over, Shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to
invite Yu-cun, walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight.
     Ever since the day the Zhens’ maid had, by looking back twice over her shoulder,
convinced him that she was a friend, Yu-cun had had the girl very much on his mind,
and now that it was festival time, the full moon of Mid Autumn lent an inspiration to
his romantic impulses which finally resulted in the following octet:


‘Ere on ambition's path my feet are set,
Sorrow comes often this poor heart to fret.
Yet, as my brow contracted with new care,
Was there not one who, parting, turned to stare?
Dare I, that grasp at windows in the wind,
Hope, underneath the moon, a friend to find?
Bright orb, if with my plight you sympathize,
Shine first upon the chamber where she lies.’

Having delivered himself of this masterpiece, Yu-cun’s thoughts began to run on his
unrealized ambitions and, after much head-scratching and many heavenward glances
ac?companied by heavy sighs, he produced the following couplet, reciting it in a loud,
ringing voice which caught the ear of Shi-yin, who chanced at that moment to be
arriving:


‘The jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy.
The jade pin in the drawer hides, waiting its time to fly.’

Shi-yin smiled. ‘You are a man of no mean ambition, Yu-cun.’
‘Oh no!’Yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly. ‘You are too flattering. I was merely
reciting at random from the lines of some old poet. But what brings you here, sir?’
‘Tonight is Mid Autumn night,’said Shi-yin. ‘People call it the Festival of Reunion. It
occurred to me that you might be feeling rather lonely here in your monkery, so I
have arranged for the two of us to take a little wine together in my study. I hope you
will not refuse to join me.’
Yu-cun made no polite pretence of declining. ‘Your kind?ness is more than I deserve,’
he said. ‘I accept gratefully.’ And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door.
Soon they had finished their tea. Wine and various choice dishes were brought in
and placed on the table, already laid out with cups, plates, and so forth, and the two
men took their places and began to drink. At first they were rather slow and
ceremonious; but gradually, as the conversation grew more animated, their potations
too became more reckless and un?inhibited. The sounds of music and singing which
could now be heard from every house in the neighbourhood and the full moon which
shone with cold brilliance overhead seemed to increase their elation, so that the
cups were emptied almost as soon as they touched their lips, and Yu-cun, who was
already a sheet or so in the wind, was seized with an irrepressible excitement to
which he presently gave expression in the form of a quatrain, ostensibly on the
subject of the moon, but really about the ambition he had hitherto been at some
pains to conceal:


‘In thrice five nights her perfect O is made,
Whose cold light bathes each marble balustrade.
As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways,
On earth ten thousand heads look up and gaze.’

     ‘Bravo!’said Shi-yin loudly. 'I have always insisted that you were a young fellow
who would go up in the world, and now, in these verses you have just recited, I see
an augury of your ascent. In no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds! This
calls for a drink!' And, saying this, he poured Yu-cun a large cup of wine.
     Yu-cun drained the cup, then, surprisingly, sighed:
     ‘Don't imagine the drink is making me boastful, but I really do believe that if it
were just a question of having the sort of qualifications now in demand, I should
stand as good a chance as any of getting myself on to the list of candidates. The
trouble is that I simply have no means of laying my hands on the money that would
be needed for lodgings and travel expenses. The journey to the capital is a long one,
and the sort of money I can earn from my copying is not enough—’
     ‘Why ever didn't you say this before?’ said Shi-yin inter?rupting him. ‘I have long
wanted to do something about this, but on all the occasions I have met you
previously, the con?versation has never got round to this subject, and I haven't liked
to broach it for fear of offending you. Well, now we know where we are. I am not a
very clever man, but at least I know the right thing to do when I see it. Luckily, the
next Triennial is only a few months ahead. You must go to the capital without delay. A
spring examination triumph will make you feel that all your studying has been worth
while. I shall take care of all your expenses. It is the least return I can make for your
friendship.’ And there and then he instructed his boy to go with all speed and make
up a parcel of fifty tales of the best refined silver and two suits of winter clothes.
     ‘The almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travel?ling,’ he went on,
addressing Yu-cun again. ‘You can set about hiring a boat for the journey straight
away. How de?lightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have
distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates!’
     Yu-cun accepted the silver and the clothes with only the most perfunctory word
of thanks and without, apparently, giving them a further moment’s thought, for he
continued to drink and laugh and talk as if nothing had happened. It was well after
midnight before they broke up.
After seeing Yu-cun off, Shi-yin went to bed and slept without a break until the sun
was high in the sky next morn?ing. When he awoke, his mind was still running on the
con?versation of the previous night. He thought he would write a couple of
introductory letters for Yu-cun to take with him to the capital, and arrange for him to
call on the family of an official he was acquainted with who might be able to put him
up; but when he sent a servant to invite him over, the servant brought back word
from the temple as follows:
'The monk says that Mr Jia set out for the capital at five o'clock this morning, sir. He
says he left a message to pass on to you. He said to tell you, “A scholar should not
concern himself with almanacs, but should act as the situation de?mands,”and he
said there wasn't time to say good-bye.'
So Shi-yin was obliged to let the matter drop.




*

It is a true saying that ‘time in idleness is quickly spent’. In no time at all it was
Fifteenth Night, and Shi-yin sent little Ying-lian out, in the charge of one of the
servants called Calamity, to see the mummers and the coloured lanterns. It was near
midnight when Calamity, feeling an urgent need to relieve his bladder, put Ying-lian
down on someone’s doorstep while he went about his business, only to find, on his
return, that the child was nowhere to be seen. Frantically he searched for her
throughout the rest of the night; but when day dawned and he had still not found her,
he took to his heels, not daring to face his master and mistress, and made off for
another part of the country.
Shi-yin and his wife knew that something must be wrong when their little girl failed
to return home all night. Then a search was made; but all those sent out were
obliged in the end to report that no trace of her could be found.
The shock of so sudden a loss to a middle-aged couple who had only ever had the
one daughter can be imagined. In tears every day and most of the night, they almost
lost the will to go on living, and after about a month like this first Shi-yin and then his
wife fell ill, so that doctors and diviners were in daily attendance on them.
     Then, on the fifteenth of the third month, while frying cakes for an offering, the
monk of Bottle-gourd Temple carelessly allowed the oil to catch alight, which set fire
to the paper window. And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and
bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction
anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away
like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time
they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away
all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families
homeless in the process.
Poor Zhens! Though they and their handful of domestics escaped unhurt, their house,
which was only next door to the temple, was soon reduced to a heap of rubble, while
Shi-yin stood by helpless, groaning and stamping in despair.
After some discussion with his wife, Shi-yin decided that they should move to their
farm in the country; but a series of crop failures due to flooding and drought had led
to wide?spread brigandage in those parts, and government troops were out
everywhere hunting down the mutinous peasants and making arrests. In such
conditions it was impossible to settle on the farm, so Shi-yin sold the land and, taking
only two of the maids with them, went with his wife to seek refuge with his
father-in-law, Feng Su.
     This Feng Su was a Ru-zhou man who, though only a farmer by calling, had a very
comfortable sufficiency. He was somewhat displeased to see his son-in-law arriving
like a refugee on his doorstep; but fortunately Shi- yin had on him the money he had
realized from the sale of the farm, and this he now entrusted to his father-in-law to
buy for him, as and when he could, a house and land on which he could depend for
his future livelihood. Feng Su embezzled about half of this sum and used the other
half to provide him with a ruinous cottage and some fields of poor, thin soil.
A scholar, with no experience of business or agricultural matters, Shi-yin now found
himself poorer after a year or two of struggle than when he had started. Feng Su
would treat him to a few pearls of rustic wisdom whenever they met, but behind his
back would grumble to all and sundry about 'incompetents' and 'people who liked
their food but were too lazy to work for it', which caused Shi-yin great bitterness
when it came to his ears. The anxieties and injustices which now beset him, coming
on top of the shocks he had suffered a year or two previously, left a man of his years
with little resistance to the joint onslaught of poverty and ill-health, and gradually he
began to betray the unmistakable symptoms of a decline.
One day, wishing to take his mind off his troubles for a bit, he had dragged himself,
stick in hand, to the main road, when it chanced that he suddenly caught sight of a
Taoist with a limp—a crazy, erratic figure in hempen sandals and tattered clothes,
who chanted the following words to himself as he advanced towards him:


‘Men all know that salvation should be won,
But with ambition won't have done, have done.
Where are the famous ones of days gone by?
In grassy graves they lie now, every one.

Men all know that salvation should be won,
But with their riches won't have done, have done.
Each day they grumble they've not made enough.
When they've enough, it's goodnight everyone!

Men all know that salvation should be won,
But with their loving wives they won't have done.
The darlings every day protest their love:
But once you're dead, they're off with another one.

                       Men all know that salvation should be won,
                       But with their children won't have done, have done.
                       Yet though of patents fond there is no lack,
Of grateful children saw I ne’er a one.’

Shi-yin approached the Taoist and questioned him. ‘What is all this you are saying?
All I can make out is a lot of “won” and “done”.’
‘If you can make out “won” and “done”,’ replied the Taoist with a smile, ‘you may
be said to have understood; for in all the affairs of this world what is won is done,
and what is done is won; for whoever has not yet done has not yet won, and in order
to have won, one must first have done. I shall call my song the “Won-Done Song”.’
Shi-yin had always been quick-witted, and on hearing these words a flash of
understanding had illuminated his mind. He therefore smiled back at the Taoist: ‘Wait
a minute! How would you like me to provide your “Won-Done Song” with a
commentary?’
        ‘Please do!’ said the Taoist; and Shi-yin proceeded as follows:
        ‘Mean hovels and abandoned halls
        Where courtiers once paid daily calls:
        Bleak haunts where weeds and willows scarcely thrive
        Were once with mirth and revelry alive.
        Whilst cobwebs shroud the mansion’s gilded beams,
        The cottage casement with choice muslin gleams.
        Would you of perfumed elegance recite?
        Even as you speak, the raven locks turn white.
        Who yesterday her lord’s bones laid in clay,
        On silken bridal-bed shall lie today.
        Coffers with gold and silver filled:
        Now, in a trice, a tramp by all reviled.
        One at some other’s short life gives a sigh,
        Not knowing that he, too, goes home—to die!
        The sheltered and well-educated lad,
        In spite of all your care, may turn out bad;

        And the delicate, fastidious maid
        End in a foul stews, plying a shameful trade.
        The judge whose hat is too small for his head
        Wears, in the end, a convict's cangue instead.
        Who shivering once in rags bemoaned his fate,
        Today finds fault with scarlet robes of state.
        In such commotion does the world’s theatre rage:
        As each one leaves, another takes the stage.
        In vain we roam:
        Each in the end must call a strange land home.
        Each of us with that poor girl may compare
        Who sews a wedding-gown for another bride to wear.'


‘A very accurate commentary!' cried the mad, lame Taoist, clapping his hands
delightedly.
But Shi-yin merely snatched the satchel that hung from the other’s shoulder and
slung it from his own, and with a shout of ‘Let's go!’ and without even waiting to call
back home, he strode off into the wide world in the company of the madman.
This event made a great uproar in the little town, and news of it was relayed from
gossip to gossip until it reached the ears of Mrs Zhen, who cried herself into fits when
she heard it. After consulting her father, she sent men out to inquire everywhere
after her husband; but no news of him was to be had.
It was now imperative that she should move in with her parents and look to them for
support. Fortunately she still had the two maids who had stayed on with her from
the Soochow days, and by sewing and embroidering morning, noon and night, she
and her women were able to make some contribution to her father's income. The
latter still found daily occasion to complain, but there was very little he could do
about it.
One day the elder of the two maids was purchasing some silks at the door when she
heard the criers clearing the street and all the people began to tell each other that
the new man?darin had arrived. She hid in the doorway and watched the guards and
runners marching past two by two. But when the mandarin in his black hat and
scarlet robe of office was borne past in his great chair, she stared for some time as
though puzzled. ‘Where have I seen that mandarin before?’she wondered. ‘His face
looks extraordinarily familiar.’ But presently she went into the house again and gave
the matter no further thought.
That night, just as they were getting ready for bed, there was suddenly a great
commotion at the door and a confused hubbub of voices shouting that someone was
wanted at the yamen for questioning, which so terrified Feng Su that he was
momentarily struck dumb and could only stare.
If you wish to know what further calamity this portended, you will have to read the
following chapter.
CHAPTER 2

A daughter of the Jias ends her days
in Yangchow city
And Leng Zi-xing discourses on the Jias of
Rong-guo House



Hearing the clamour of yamen runners outside, Feng Su hurried to the door, his face
wreathed in smiles, to ask what they wanted. ‘Tell Mr Zhen to step outside,’ they
were shouting. ‘Hurry!’
    Feng Su’s smile became even more ingratiating. ‘My name is Feng, not Zhen. My
son-in-law’s name is Zhen, but he left home to become a Taoist more than a year ago.
Could he be the one you want?’
‘“Feng” or “Zhen”, it’s all the same to us,’ said the runners; ‘but if you’re his
father-in-law you’d better come along with us to see the magistrate.’ And they
hustled him off, leaving the entire household in a state of panic, quite at a loss to
know what the trouble could be.
     It was ten o’clock before Feng Su returned, and everyone pressed him to give a
full account of what had transpired.
     ‘It seems that the new mandarin is a Hu-zhou man called Jia. He used to be an
acquaintance of Shi-yin’s in the old days. He guessed that Shi-yin must have moved to
these parts when he saw our Lucky in the doorway buying silks. That’s why he sent
the runners here. I explained what had happened to Shi-yin, and he seemed very
upset. Then he asked me about Ying-lian, and I said she was lost while out watching
the lanterns. “Never mind,” he said, “wait till I send some people out to look for her.
We shall have her back in no time.” Then we chatted a bit longer, and lust as I was
going, he gave me two taels of silver.’
     Mrs Zhen could not help being affected by this account. But the rest of that night
we pass over in silence.
     Early next day a messenger arrived from Yu-cun bearing two packets of silver and
four bolts of silk brocade for Mrs Zhen as a token of the sender’s gratitude. There was
also a confidential letter for Feng Su commissioning him to ask Mrs Zhen for Lucky’s
hand as Yu-cun’s second wife. En?raptured at the prospect of doing a good turn for a
mandarin, Feng Su hastened to urge upon his daughter the importance of complying
with this request, and that very night Lucky was bundled into a small covered chair
and carried off to the yamen. Yu-cun’s delight goes without saying. Another hundred
taels of silver were despatched to Feng Su, together with a number of good things for
Mrs Zhen, to cheer and sustain her until such time as her daughter’s whereabouts
could be discovered.
Lucky was, of course, the maid who had once turned back to look at Yu-cun when
they were living at the house in Soochow. She could scarcely have foreseen at the
time what singular good fortune that one glance would procure for her. But she was
destined to be doubly fortunate. She had not been with Yu-cun more than a year
when she gave birth to a son; and a mere six months later Yu-cun’s first wife died,
whereupon Lucky was promoted to fill her place and became Her Lady ship. As the
proverb says,

         Sometimes by chance
         A look or a glance
             May one’s fortune advance.

*

When Yu-cun received the gift of money from Zhen Shi-yin he had left for the capital
on the day after the festival. He had done well in the Triennial examination, passing
out as a Palace Graduate, and had been selected for external service. And now he
had been promoted to the magistracy of this district.
But although his intelligence and ability were outstanding, these qualities were
unfortunately offset by a certain cupidity and harshness and a tendency to use his
intelligence in order to outwit his superiors; all of which caused his fellow-officials to
cast envious glances in his direction, with the result that in less than a year an
unfavourable report was sent in by a senior official stating that his ‘seeming ability
was no more than a mask for cunning and duplicity’ and citing one or two instances
in which he had aided and abetted the peculations of his underlings or allied himself
with powerful local interests in order to frustrate the course of justice.
The imperial eye, lighting on this report, kindled with wrath. Yu-cun’s instant
dismissal was commanded. The officials at the Prefecture, when notice that he was
to be cashiered arrived from the Ministry, rejoiced to a man. But Yu-cun, in spite of
all the shame and chagrin that he felt, allowed no glimmer of resentment to appear
on his face. Indeed, he joked and smiled as before, and when the business of handing
over was completed, he took his wife and family and the loot he had accumulated
during his years of office and having settled them all safely in his native Hu-zhou, set
off, free as the air, on an extended tour of some of the more celebrated places of
scenic interest in our mighty empire.
One day Yu-cun chanced to be staying in the Yangchow area when he heard that the
Salt Commissioner for that year was a certain Lin Ru-hai. This Lin Ru-hai had passed
out Florilege, or third in the whole list of successful candidates, in a previous
Triennial, and had lately been promoted to the Censorate. He was a Soochow man
and had not long taken up his duties in Yangchow following his nomination by the
emperor as Visiting Inspector in that area.
Lin Ru-hai came of an aristocratic family and was himself fifth in line since his
ancestor’s ennoblement. The original patent had been inheritable only up to the
third generation, and it was only through the magnanimity of the reigning sovereign
that an exceptional act of grace had extended it for a further generation in the case
of Lin Ru-hai’s father. Lin Ru-hai himself had therefore been obliged to make his way
up through the examination system. It was fortunate for him that, though the family
had up to his time enjoyed hereditary emoluments, it had nevertheless enjoined a
high standard of education on all of its members.
Lin Ru-hai was less fortunate, however, in belonging to a family whose numbers were
dwindling. He could still point to several related households, but they were all on the
distaff side. There was not a single relation in the direct line who bore his name.
Already he was fifty, and his only son had died the year before at the age of three.
And although he kept several concubines, he seemed fated to have no son, and had
all but resigned himself to this melancholy fact.
His chief wife, who had been a Miss Jia, had given him a daughter called Dai-yu. Both
parents doted on her, and because she showed exceptional intelligence, conceived
the idea of giving her a rudimentary education as a substitute for bringing up a son,
hoping in this way somewhat to alleviate the sense of desolation left by the death of
their only heir.
Now Jia Yu-cun had had the misfortune to catch a severe chill while staying in his
lodgings at Yangchow, and after his recovery, found himself somewhat short of cash.
He was therefore already looking around for some more permanent haven where he
could rest and recuperate, when he chanced to run into two old friends who were
acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner and who, knowing that the latter was
looking for a suitable tutor for his daughter, took Yu-cun along to the yamen and
introduced him, with the result that he was given the job.
Since Yu-cun’s pupil was both very young and rather delicate, there were no regular
hours of instruction; and as she had only a couple of little maids studying with her for
company who stayed away when she did, Yu-cun’s employ?ment was far from
arduous and left ample time for convales?cence.
A year or more passed uneventfully and then, quite un?expectedly, Lin Ru-hai’s wife
took ill and died. Yu-cun’s little pupil helped with the nursing throughout her
mother’s last illness and mourned for her bitterly after her death. The extra strain
this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a
recurrent sickness, and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons.
Bored by his enforced idleness, Yu-cun took to going for walks as soon as lunch was
over whenever the weather was warm and sunny.
One day a desire to savour country sights and sounds led him outside the city walls,
and as he walked along with no fixed destination in mind, he presently found himself
in a place ringed with hills and full of murmuring brooks and tall stands of bamboo
where a temple stood half-hidden among the trees. The walled approach to the
gateway had fallen in and parts of the surrounding wall were in ruins. A board above
the gate announced the temple’s name:

THE TEMPLE OF PERFECT KNOWLEDGE

while two cracked and worn uprights at the sides of the gate were inscribed with the
following couplet:
(on the right-hand side)

As long as there is a sufficiency behind you, you press greedily forward.

(on the left-hand side)

It is only when there is no road in front of you that you think of turning back.


‘The wording is commonplace to a degree,’ Yu-cun reflected, ‘yet the sentiment is
quite profound. In all the famous temples and monasteries I have visited, I cannot
recollect having ever seen anything quite like it. I shouldn’t be surprised to find that
some story of spectacular downfall and dramatic conversion lay behind this
inscription. It might be worth going in and inquiring.’
But when he went inside and looked around, he saw only an ancient, wizened monk
cooking some gruel who paid no attention whatsoever to his greetings and who
proved, when Yu-cun went up to him and asked him a few questions, to be both deaf
and partially blind. His toothless replies were all but unintelligible, and in any case
bore no relation to the questions.
Yu-cun walked out again in disgust. He now thought that in order to give the full rural
flavour to his outing he would treat himself to a few cups of wine in a little country
inn and accordingly directed his steps towards the near-by village. He had scarcely
set foot inside the door of the village inn when one of the men drinking at separate
tables inside rose up and advanced to meet him with a broad smile.
‘Fancy meeting you!’
It was an antique dealer called Leng Zi-xing whom Yu-cun had got to know some
years previously when he was staying in the capital. Yu-cun had a great admiration
for Zi-xing as a practical man of business, whilst Zi-xing for his part was tickled to
claim acquaintanceship with a man of Yu-cun’s great learning and culture. On the
basis of this mutual admiration the two of them had got on wonderfully well, and
Yu-cun now returned the other’s greeting with a pleased smile.
‘My dear fellow! How long have you been here? I really had no idea you were in
these parts. It was quite an accident that I came here today at all. What an
extraordinary coincidence!’
‘I went home at the end of last year to spend New Year with the family,’ said Zi-xing.
‘On my way back to the capital I thought I would stop off and have a few words with
a friend of mine who lives hereabouts, and he very kindly invited me to spend a few
days with him. I hadn’t got any urgent business waiting for me, so I thought I might as
well stay on a bit and leave at the middle of the month. I came out here on my own
because my friend has an engagement today. I certainly didn’t expect to run into you
here.’
Zi-xing conducted Yu-cun to his table as he spoke and ordered more wine and some
fresh dishes to be brought. The two men then proceeded, between leisurely sips of
wine, to relate what each had been doing in the years that had elapsed since their
last meeting.
Presently Yu-cun asked Zi-xing if anything of interest had happened recently in the
capital.
‘I can’t think of anything particularly deserving of mention,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Except,
perhaps, for a very small but very unusual event that took place in your own clan
there.’
‘What makes you say that?’ said Yu-cun, ‘I have no family connections in the
capital.’
‘Well, it’s the same name,’ said Zi-xing. ‘They must be the same clan.’
Yu-cun asked him what family he could be referring to.
‘I fancy you wouldn’t disown the Jias of the Rong-guo mansion as unworthy of you.’
‘Oh, you mean them,’ said Yu-cun. ‘There are so many members of my clan, it’s
hard to keep up with them all. Since the time of Jia Fu of the Eastern Han dynasty
there have been branches of the Jia clan in every province of the empire. The
Rong-guo branch is, as a matter of fact, on the same clan register as my own; but
since they are exalted so far above us socially, we don’t normally claim the
connection, and nowa?days we are completely out of touch with them.’
Zi-xing sighed. ‘You shouldn’t speak about them in that way, you know. Nowadays
both the Rong and Ning mansions are in a greatly reduced state compared with what
they used to be.’
‘When I was last that way the Rong and Ning mansions both seemed to be fairly
humming with life. Surely nothing could have happened to reduce their prosperity in
so short a time?’
‘Ah, you may well ask. But it’s a long story.’
‘Last time I was in Jinling,’ went on Yu-cun, ‘I passed by their two houses one day on
my way to Shi-tou-cheng to visit the ruins. The Ning-guo mansion along the eastern
half of the road and the Rong-guo mansion along the western half must between
them have occupied the greater part of the north side frontage of that street. It’s
true that there wasn’t much activity outside the main entrances, but looking up over
the outer walls I had a glimpse of the most magnificent and imposing halls and
pavilions, and even the rocks and trees of the gardens beyond seemed to have a
sleekness and luxuriance that were certainly not suggestive of a family whose
fortunes were in a state of decline.’
‘Well! For a Palace Graduate Second Class, you ought to know better than that!
Haven’t you ever heard the old saying, “The beast with a hundred legs is a long time
dying”? Although I say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past, of
course I don’t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their
circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average
government official. At the moment the numbers of their establishment and the
activities they engage in are, if anything, on the increase. Both masters and servants
all lead lives of luxury and magnificence. And they still have plenty of plans and
projects under way. But they can’t bring themselves to economize or make any
adjustment in their ac?customed style of living. Consequently, though outwardly they
still manage to keep up appearances, inwardly they are beginning to feel the pinch.
But that’s a small matter. There’s something much more seriously wrong with them
than that. They are not able to turn out good sons, those stately houses, for all their
pomp and show. The males in the family get more degenerate from one generation
to the next.’
‘Surely,’ said Yu-cun with surprise, ‘it is inconceivable that such highly cultured
households should not give their children the best education possible? I say nothing
of other families, but the Jias of the Ning and Rong households used to be famous for
the way in which they brought up their sons. How could they come to be as you
describe?’
‘I assure you, it is precisely those families I am speaking of. Let me tell you
something of their history. The Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo were two
brothers by the same mother. Ning-guo was the elder of the two. When he died, his
eldest son, Jia Dai-hua, inherited his post. Dai?hua had two sons. The elder, Jia Fu,
died at the age of eight or nine, leaving only the second son, Jia Jing, to inherit.
Nowadays Jia Jing’s only interest in life is Taoism. He spends all his time over retorts
and crucibles concocting elixirs, and refuses to be bothered with anything else.
‘Fortunately he had already provided himself with a son, Jia Zhen, long before he
took up this hobby. So, having set his mind on turning himself into an immortal, he
has given up his post in favour of this son. And what’s more he refuses outright to
live at home and spends his time fooling around with a pack of Taoists somewhere
outside the city walls.
‘This Jia Zhen has got a son of his own, a lad called Jia Rong, just turned sixteen.
With old Jia Jing out of the way and refusing to exercise any authority, Jia Zhen has
thrown his res[omsiblities to thw winds and given himself up to a life of pleasure. He
has turned that Ning-guo mansion upside down, but there is no one around who
dares gainsay him.
‘Now I come to the Rong household—it was there that this strange event occurred
that I was telling you about. When the old Duke of Rong-guo died, his eldest son, Jia
Dai-shan, inherited his emoluments. He married a girl from a very old Nanking family,
the daughter of Marquis Shi, who bore him two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng.
‘Dai-shan has been dead this many a year, but the old lady is still alive. The elder
son, Jia She, inherited; but he’s only a very middling sort of person and doesn’t play
much part in running the family. The second son, though, Jia Zheng, has been mad
keen on study ever since he was a lad. He is a very upright sort of person, straight as
a die. He was his grand?father’s favourite. He would have sat for the examinations,
but when the emperor saw Dai-shan’s testamentary memorial that he wrote on his
death bed, he was so moved, thinking what a faithful servant the old man had been,
that he not only ordered the elder son to inherit his father’s position, but also gave
instructions that any other sons of his were to be pre?sented to him at once, and on
seeing Jia Zheng he gave him the post of Supernumerary Executive Officer, brevet
rank, with instructions to continue his studies while on the Minis?try’s payroll. From
there he Jias now risen to the post of Under Secretary.
‘Sir Zheng’s lady was formerly a Miss Wang. Her first child was a boy called Jia Zhu.
He was already a Licensed Scholar at the age of fourteen. Then he married and had a
son. But he died of an illness before he was twenty. The second child she bore him
was a little girl, rather remarkable because she was born on New Year’s day. Then
after an interval of twelve years or more she suddenly had another son. He was even
more remarkable, because at the moment of his birth he had a piece of beautiful,
clear, coloured jade in his mouth with a lot of writing on it. They gave him the name
“Bao-yu” as a consequence. Now tell me if you don’t think that is an extraordinary
thing.’
‘It certainly is,’ Yu-cun agreed. ‘I should not be at all surprised to find that there was
something very unusual in the heredity of that child.’
‘Humph,’ said Zi-xing. ‘A great many people have said that. That is the reason why
his old grandmother thinks him such a treasure. But when they celebrated the First
Twelve month and Sir Zheng tested his disposition by putting a lot of objects in front
of him and seeing which he would take hold of, he stretched out his little hand and
started playing with some women’s things –combs, bracelets, pots of rouge and
powder and the like—completely ignoring all the other ob?jects. Sir Zheng was very
displeased. He said he would grow up to be a rake, and ever since then he hasn’t felt
much affection for the child. But to the old lady he’s the very apple of her eye.
‘But there’s more that’s unusual about him than that. He’s now rising ten and
unusually mischievous, yet his mind is as sharp as a needle. You wouldn’t find one in
a hundred to match him. Some of the childish things he says are most extraordinary.
He’ll say, “Girls are made of water and boys are made of mud. When I am with girls I
feel fresh and clean’ but when I am with boys I feel stupid and nasty.” Now isn’t that
priceless! He’ll be a lady-killer when he grows up, no question of that.’
Yu-cun’s face assumed an expression of unwonted severity. ‘Not so. By no means. It is
a pity that none of you seem to understand this child’s heredity. Most likely even my
esteemed kinsman Sir Jia Zheng is mistaken in treating the boy as a future libertine.
This is something that no one but a widely read person, and one moreover
well-versed in moral philosophy and in the subtle arcana of metaphysical science
could possibly understand.’
Observing the weighty tone in which these words were uttered, Zi-xing hurriedly
asked to be instructed, and Yu-cun proceeded as follows:
‘The generative processes operating in the universe provide the great majority of
mankind with natures in which good and evil are commingled in more or less equal
proportions. In?stances of exceptional goodness and exceptional badness are
produced by the operation of beneficent or noxious ethereal influences, of which the
former are symptomatized by the equilibrium of society and the latter by its
disequilib?rium.

—all instances of exceptional badness—were born under the influence of harmful
forces, and all sought to disrupt the societies in which they lived.
‘Now, the good cosmic fluid with which the natures of the exceptionally good are
compounded is a pure, quintessential humour; whilst the evil fluid which infuses the
natures of the exceptionally bad is a cruel, perverse humour.
‘Therefore, our age being one in which beneficent ethereal influences are in the
ascendant, in which the reigning dynasty’ is well-established and society both
peaceful and prosperous, innumerable instances are to be found, from the palace
down to the humblest cottage, of individuals endowed with the pure, quintessential
humour.
‘Moreover, an unused surplus of this pure, quintessential humour, unable to find
corporeal lodgment, circulates freely abroad until it manifests itself in the form of
sweet dews and balmy winds, asperged and effused for the enrichment and
refreshment of all terrestial life.
‘Consequently, the cruel and perverse humours, unable to circulate freely in the air
and sunlight, subside, by a process of incrassation and coagulation, into the bottoms
of ditches and ravines.
Now, should these incrassate humours chance to be stirred or provoked by wind or
weather into a somewhat more volatile and active condition, it sometimes happens
that a stray wisp or errant flocculus may escape from the fissure or concavity in
which they are contained; and if some of the pure, quintessential humour should
chance to be passing overhead at that same moment, the two will become locked in
irreconcilable conflict, the good refusing to yield to the evil, the evil persisting in its
hatred of the good. And just as wind, water, thunder and lightning meeting together
over the earth can neither dissipate nor yield one to another but produce an
explosive shock resulting in the downward emission of rain, so does this clash of
humours result in the forcible downward expulsion of the evil humour, which, being
thus forced down-wards, will find its way into some human creature.
‘Such human recipients, whether they be male or female, since they are already
amply endowed with the benign humour before the evil humour is injected, are
incapable of becoming either greatly good or greatly bad; but place them in the
company of ten thousand others and you will find that they are superior to all the
rest in sharpness and intelligence and inferior to all the rest in perversity,
wrongheadedness and eccentricity. Born into a rich or noble household they are
likely to become great lovers or the occasion of great love in others; in a poor but
well-educated household they will become literary rebels or eccentric aesthetes;
even if they are born in the lowest stratum of society they are likely to become great
actors or famous hetaerae. Under no circumstances will you find them in servile or
menial positions, content to be at the beck and call of mediocrities.

All of these, though their circumstances differed, were essentially the same.’
‘You mean’ Zi-xing interposed,
‘Zhang victorious is a hero,
Zhang beaten is a lousy knave?’


‘Precisely so,’ said Yu-cun. ‘I should have told you that during the two years after I
was cashiered I travelled exten?sively in every province of the empire and saw quite
a few remarkable children in the course of my travels; so that just now when you
mentioned this Bao-yu I felt pretty certain what type of boy he must be. But one
doesn’t need to go very far afield for another example. There is one in the Zhen
family in Nanking—I am referring to the family of the Zhen who is Imperial Deputy
Director-General of the Nanking Secretariat. Perhaps you know who I mean?’
‘Who doesn’t?’ said Zi-xing. ‘There is an old family con?nection between the Zhen
family and the Jias of whom we have just been speaking, and they are still on very
close terms with each other. I’ve done business with them myself for longer than I’d
care to mention.’
‘Last year when I was in Nanking,’ said Yu-cun, smiling at the recollection, ‘I was
recommended for the post of tutor in their household. I could tell at a glance, as
soon as I got inside the place, that for all the ducal splendour this was a family
“though rich yet given to courtesy”, in the words of the Sage, and that it was a rare
piece of luck to have got a place in it. But when I came to teach my pupil, though he
was only at the first year primary stage, he gave me more trouble than an
examination candidate.
‘He was indeed a comedy. He once said, “I must have two girls to do my lessons
with me if I am to remember the words and understand the sense. Otherwise my
mind will simply not work.” And he would often tell the little pages who waited on
him, “The word ‘girl’ is very precious and very pure. It is much more rare and
precious than all the rarest beasts and birds and plants in the world. So it is most
extremely important that you should never, never violate it with your coarse mouths
and stinking breath. Whenever you need to say it, you should first rinse your mouths
out with clean water and scented tea. And if ever I catch you slipping up, I shall have
holes drilled through your teeth and lace them up together.”
‘There was simply no end to his violence and unruliness. Yet as soon as his lessons
were over and he went inside to visit the girls of the family, he became a completely
different person—all gentleness and calm, and as intelligent and well-bred as you
please.
‘His father gave him several severe beatings but it made no difference. Whenever
the pain became too much for him he would start yelling “Girls! girls!” Afterwards,
when the girls in the family got to hear about it, they made fun of him. “Why do you
always call to us when you are hurt? I suppose you think we shall come and plead for
you to be let off. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” But you should have heard
his answer. He said, “Once when the pain was very bad, I thought that perhaps if I
shouted the word ‘girls’ it might help to ease it. Well,” he said, “I just called out once,
and the pain really was quite a bit better. So now that I have found this secret remedy,
I just keep on shouting ‘Girls! girls! girls!’ whenever the pain is at its worst.” I could
not help laughing.
‘But because his grandmother doted on him so much, she was always taking the
child’s part against me and his father. In the end I had to hand in my notice. A boy like
that will never be able to keep up the family traditions or listen to the advice of his
teachers and friends. The pity of it is, though, that the girls in that family are all
exceptionally good.’
‘The three at present in the Jia household are also very fine girls,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Sir
Jia Zheng’s eldest girl, Yuan?chun, was chosen for her exceptional virtue and
cleverness to be a Lady Secretary in the Imperial Palace. The next in age after her and
eldest of the three still at home is called Ying?chun. She is the daughter of Sir Jia She
by one of his secondary wives. After her comes another daughter of Sir Zheng’s, also
a concubine’s child, called Tan-chun. The youngest, Xi-chun, is sister-german to Mr Jia
Zhen of the Ning-guo mansion. Old Lady Jia is very fond of her granddaughters and
keeps them all in her own apartments on the Rong-guo side. They all study together,
and I have been told that they are doing very well.’
‘One of the things I liked about the Zhen family,’ said Yu-cun, ‘was their custom of
giving the girls the same sort of names as the boys, unlike the majority of families
who invariably use fancy words like “chun”, “hong”, “xiang”, “yu”, and so forth. How
comes it that the Jias should have followed the vulgar practice in this respect?’
‘They didn’t,’ said Zi-xing. ‘The eldest girl was called “Yuan-chun” because she was
in fact born on the first day of spring. The others were given names with “chun” in
them to match hers. But if you go back a generation, you will find that among the Jias
too the girls had names exactly like the boys’.
‘I can give you proof. Your present employer’s good lady is sister-german to Sir She
and Sir Zheng of the Rong house?hold. Her name, before she married, was Jia Min. If
you don’t believe me, you make a few inquiries when you get home and you’ll find it
is so.’
Yu-cun clapped his hands with a laugh. ‘Of course! I have often wondered why it is
that my pupil Dai-yu always pronounces “min” as “mi” when she is reading and, if
she has to write it, always makes the character with one or two strokes missing. Now
I understand. No wonder her speech and behaviour are so unlike those of ordinary
children! I always supposed that there must have been something remarkable about
the mother for her to have produced so remarkable a daughter. Now I know that she
was related to the Jias of the Rong household, I am not surprised.
‘By the way, I am sorry to say that last month the mother passed away.’
Zi-xing sighed. ‘Fancy her dying so soon! She was the youngest of the three. And the
generation before them are all gone, every one. We shall have to see what sort of
husbands they manage to find for the younger generation!’
‘Yes, indeed,’ said Yu-cun. ‘Just now you mentioned that Sir Zheng had this boy with
the jade in his mouth and you also mentioned a little grandson left behind by his
elder son. What about old Sir She? Surely he must have a son?’
‘Since Sir Zheng had the boy with the jade, he has had another son by a concubine,’
said Zi-xing, ‘but I couldn’t tell you what he’s like. So at present he has two sons and
one grandson. Of course, we don’t know what the future may bring.
‘But you were asking about Sir She. Yes, he has a son too, called Jia Lian. He’s
already a young man in his early twenties. He married his own kin, the niece of his
Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. He’s been married now ￡or four or five years.
Holds the rank of a Sub-perfect by purchase. He’s another member of the family who
doesn’t find responsibilities congenial. He knows his way around, though, and has a
great gift of the gab, so at present he stays at home with his Uncle Zheng and helps
him manage the family’s affairs. However, ever since he married this young lady I
mentioned, every?one high and low has joined in praising her, and he has been put
into the shade rather. She is not only a very handsome young woman, she also has a
very ready tongue and a very good head – more than a match for most men, I can tell
you.’
‘You see, I was not mistaken,’ said Yu-cun. ‘All these people you and I have been
talking about are probably examples of that mixture of good and evil humours I was
describing to you.’
‘Well, I don’t know about that,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Instead of sitting here setting other
people’s accounts to rights, let’s have another drink!’
‘I am afraid I have drunk quite a lot while we were busy talking,’ said Yu-cun.
Zi-xing laughed. ‘There’s nothing like a good gossip about other people’s affairs for
making the wine go down! I’m sure an extra cup or two won’t do us any harm.’
Yu-cun glanced out of the window. ‘It’s getting late. We must be careful we don’t get
shut out of the city. Why not continue the conversation on our way back? Then we
can take our time.’
The two men accordingly rose from their seats, settled the bill for the wine, and were
just about to start on their way, when a voice from behind called out, ‘Yu-cun,
congratulations! I’ve got some good news for you.’
Yu-cun turned to look.
But if you wish to know who it was, you will have to read the next chapter.
CHAPTER 3

Lin Ru-hai recommends a private tutor
to his brother-in-law
And old Lady Jia extends a compassionate welcome
to the motherless child



When Yu-cun turned to look, he was surprised to see that it was Zhang Ru-gui, a
former colleague who had been cashiered at the same time and for the same reason
as himself. Zhang Ru-gui was a native of these parts, and had been living at home
since his dismissal. Having just wormed out the information that a motion put
forward in the capital for the reinstatement of ex-officials had been approved, he had
been dashing about ever since, pulling strings and soliciting help from potential
backers, and was engaged in this activity when he unexpectedly ran into Yu-cun.
Hence the tone of his greeting.
     As soon as they had finished bowing to each other, Zhang Ru-gui told Yu-cun the
good news, and after further hurried conversation they went their separate ways.
     Leng Zi-xing, who had overheard the news, proposed a plan. Why should not
Yu-cun ask his employer Lin Ru-hai to write to his brother-in-law Jia Zheng in the
capital and enlist his support on his, Yu-cun’s, behalf? Yu-cun agreed to follow this
suggestion, and presently the two friends separated.
     Back in his quarters, Yu-cun quickly hunted out a copy of the Gazette, and having
satisfied himself that the news was authentic, broached the matter next day with Lin
Ru-hai.
     ‘It so happens that an opportunity of helping you has just presented itself,’ said
Ru-hai. ‘Since my poor wife passed on, my mother-in-law in the capital has been
worried about the little girl having no one to look after her, and has already sent
some of her folk here by barge to fetch her away. The only reason she has so far not
gone is that she has not been quite recovered from her illness. I was, however, only
just now thinking that the moment to send her had arrived. And as I have still done
nothing to repay you for your kindness in tutoring her for me, you may be sure that
now this opportunity has presented itself I shall do my very best to help you.
     ‘As a matter of fact, I have already made a few arrangements. I have written this
letter here entrusting my brother-in-law with your affair, explaining my indebtedness
to you and urging him to see it properly settled. I have also made it quite clear in my
letter that any expenses which may be involved are to be taken care of; so you have
nothing to worry about on that account.’
     Yu-cun made an elaborate bow to his patron and thanked him profusely. He then
ventured a question.
     ‘I am afraid I do not know what your relation’s position is at the capital. Might it
not be a little embarrassing for a person in my situation to thrust himself upon him?’
     Ru-hai laughed. ‘You need have no anxiety on that score. My brothers-in-law in
the capital are your own kinsmen. They are grandsons of the former Duke of
Rong-guo. The elder one, Jia She, is an hereditary official of the First Rank and an
honorary colonel; the younger one, Jia Zheng, is an Under Secretary in the Ministry
of Works. He takes very much after his late grandfather: a modest, generous man,
quite without the arrogance of the pampered aristocrat. That is why I have addressed
this letter to him. If I did not have complete con?fidence in his willingness to help you,
I should not have put your honour at risk by soliciting him; nor, for that matter,
should I have taken the trouble to write the letter.’
Yu-cun now knew that what Zi-xing had told him was the truth and he thanked Lin
Ru-hai once again.
‘I have fixed the second day of next month for my little girl’s journey to the capital,’
said Ru-hai. ‘If you cared to travel with her, it would be convenient for both of us.’
     Yu-cun accepted the suggestion with eager deference. Everything, he thought to
himself, was turning out very satis?factorily. Ru-hai for his part set about preparing
presents for his wife’s family and parting gifts for Yu-cun, all of which Yu-cun in due
course took charge of.
     At first his little pupil could not be persuaded to part from her father; but her
grandmother was insistent that she should go, and Ru-hai added his own reasons.
     ‘I’m half a century old now, my dear, and I have no inten?tion of taking a second
wife; so there will be no one here to act as a mother to you. It isn’t, either, as if you
had sisters who could help to take care of you. You know how often you are poorly.
And you are still very young. It would be a great weight off my mind to know that you
had your Grandmother Jia and your uncles’ girls to fall back on. I really think you
ought to go.’
     After this Dai-yu could only take a tearful leave of her father and go down to the
boat with her nurse and the old women from the Rong mansion who had been sent
to fetch her. There was a separate boat for Yu-cun and a couple of servant-boys to
wait on him, and he too now embarked in the capacity of Dai-yu’s escort.
     In due course they arrived in the capital, and Yu-cun, dressed in his best and with
the two servant-boys at his heels, betook himself to the gate of the Rong mansion
and handed in his visiting-card, on which he had been careful to prefix the word
‘kinsman ’ to his own name. By this time Jia Zheng had already seen his
brother-in-law’s letter, and accorded him an interview without delay.
     Yu-cun’s imposing looks and cultivated speech made an excellent impression on
Jia Zheng, who was in any case always well-disposed towards scholars, and preserved
much of his grandfather’s affability with men of letters and readiness to help them in
any sort of trouble or distress. And since his own in?clinations were in this case
reinforced by his brother-in-law’s strong recommendation, the treatment he
extended to Yu-cun was exceptionally favourable. He exerted himself on his behalf to
such good effect that on the very day his petition was presented Yu-cun’s
reinstatement was approved, and before two months were out he was appointed to
the magistracy of Ying-tian-fu in Nanking. Thither, having chosen a suitable day on
which to commence his journey, and having first taken his leave of Jia Zheng, he now
repaired to take up his duties.
    But of him, for the time being, no more.



*



On the day of her arrival in the capital, Dai-yu stepped ashore to find covered chairs
from the Rong mansion for her and her women and a cart for the luggage ready
waiting on the quay.
     She had often heard her mother say that her Grandmother Jia’s home was not
like other people’s houses. The servants she had been in contact with during the past
few days were comparatively low-ranking ones in the domestic hierarchy, yet the
food they ate, the clothes they wore, and everything about them was quite out of
the ordinary. Dai-yu tried to imagine what the people who employed these superior
beings must be like. When she arrived at their house she would have to watch every
step she took and weigh every word she said, for if she put a foot wrong they would
surely laugh her to scorn.
     Dai-yu got into her chair and was soon carried through the city walls. Peeping
through the gauze panel which served as a window, she could see streets and
buildings more rich and elegant and throngs of people more lively and numerous
than she had ever seen in her life before. After being carried for what seemed a very
great length of time, she saw, on the north front of the east-west street through
which they were passing, two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple
gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads. In front of the gateway
ten or so splendidly dressed flunkeys sat in a row. The centre of the three gates was
closed, but people were going in and out of the two side ones. There was a board
above the centre gate on which were written in large characters the words:

NING-GUO HOUSE
Founded and Constructed by
Imperial Command

Dai-yu realized that this must be where the elder branch of her grandmother’s family
lived. The chair proceeded some dis?tance more down the street and presently there
was another triple gate, this time with the legend

RONG-GUO HOUSE
above it.
    Ignoring the central gate, her bearers went in by the western entrance and after
traversing the distance of a bow-shot inside, half turned a corner and set the chair
down. The chairs of her female attendants which were following behind were set
down simultaneously and the old women got out. The places of Dai-yu’s bearers
were taken by four handsome, fresh-faced pages of seventeen or eighteen. They
shouldered her chair and, with the old women now following on foot, carried it as far
as an ornamental inner gate. There they set it down again and then retired in
respectful silence. The old women came forward to the front of the chair, held up the
curtain, and helped Dai-yu to get out.
    Each hand resting on the outstretched hand of an elderly attendant, Dai-yu
passed through the ornamental gate into a courtyard which had balustraded loggias
running along its sides and a covered passage-way through the center. The
fore?ground of the courtyard beyond was partially hidden by a screen of polished
marble set in an elaborate red sandalwood frame. Passing round the screen and
through a small reception hall beyond it, they entered the large courtyard of the
man?sion’s principal apartments. These were housed in an imposing five-frame
building resplendent with carved and painted beams and rafters which faced them
across the courtyard. Running along either side of the courtyard were galleries hung
with cages containing a variety of different-coloured parrots, cockatoos, white-eyes,
and other birds. Some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main
building opposite. At the appearance of the visitors they rose to their feet and came
forward with smiling faces to welcome them.
    ‘You’ve come just at the right time! Lady Jia was only this moment asking about
you.’
    Three or four of them ran to lift up the door-curtain, while another of them
announced in loud tones,
    ‘Miss Lin is here!’
    As Dai-yu entered the room she saw a silver-haired old lady advancing to meet
her, supported on either side by a servant. She knew that this must be her
Grandmother Jia and would have fallen on her knees and made her kotow, but before
she could do so her grandmother had caught her in her arms and pressing her to her
bosom with cries of ‘My pet!’ and ‘My poor lamb!’ burst into loud sobs, while all
those present wept in sympathy, and Dai-yu felt herself crying as though she could
never stop. It was some time before those present succeeded in calming them both
down and Dai-yu was at last able to make her kotow.
Grandmother Jia now introduced those present.
‘This is your elder uncle’s wife, Aunt Xing. This is your Uncle Zheng’s wife, Aunt
Wang. This is Li Wan, the wife of your Cousin Zhu, who died.’
Dai-yu kowtowed to each of them in turn.
‘Call the girls!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them that we have a very special visitor
and that they need not do their lessons today.’
There was a cry of ‘Yes ma’am’ from the assembled maids, and two of them went off
to do her bidding.
Presently three girls arrived, attended by three nurses and five or six maids.
The first girl was of medium height and slightly plumpish, with cheeks as white and
firm as a fresh lychee and a nose as white and shiny as soap made from the white
goose-fat. She had a gentle, sweet, reserved manner. To look at her was to love her.
The second girl was rather tall, with sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She had
an oval face under whose well-formed brows large, expressive eyes shot out glances
that sparkled with animation. To look at her was to forget all that was mean or vulgar.

The third girl was undersized and her looks were still some?what babyish and
unformed.
All three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of
bracelets and hair ornaments.
Dai-yu rose to meet them and exchanged curtseys and intro?ductions. When she was
seated once more, a maid served tea, and a conversation began on the subject of her
mother: how her illness had started, what doctors had been called in, what
medicines prescribed, what arrangements had been made for the funeral, and how
the mourning had been observed. This conversation had the foreseeable effect of
upsetting the old lady all over again.
‘Of all my girls your mother was the one I loved the best,’ she said, ‘and now she’s
been the first to go, and without my even being able to see her again before the end.
I can’t help being upset!’ And holding fast to Dai-yu’s hand, she once more burst into
tears. The rest of the company did their best to comfort her, until at last she had
more or less re?covered
Everyone’s attention now centred on Dai-yu. They ob?served that although she was
still young, her speech and manner already showed unusual refinement. They also
noticed the frail body which seemed scarcely strong enough to bear the weight of its
clothes, but which yet had an inexpressible grace about it, and realizing that she
must be suffering from some deficiency, asked her what medicine she took for it and
why it was still not better.
‘I have always been like this,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have been taking medicine ever since I
could eat and been looked at by ever so many well-known doctors, but it has never
done me any good. Once, when I was only three, I can remember a scabby-headed
old monk came and said he wanted to take me away and have me brought up as a
nun; but of course, Mother and Father wouldn’t hear of it. So he said, “Since you are
not prepared to give her up, I am afraid her illness will never get better as long as she
lives. The only way it might get better would be if she were never to hear the sound
of weeping from this day onwards and never to see any relations other than her own
mother and father. Only in those conditions could she get through her life without
trouble.” Of course, he was quite crazy, and no one took any notice of the things he
said. I’m still taking Ginseng Tonic Pills.’
‘Well, that’s handy,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I take the Pills myself. We can easily tell
them to make up a few more each time.’
She had scarcely finished speaking when someone could be heard talking and
laughing in a very loud voice in the inner courtyard behind them.
‘Oh dear! I’m late,’ said the voice. ‘I’ve missed the arrival of our guest.’
‘Everyone else around here seems to go about with bated breath,’ thought Dai-yu.
‘Who can this new arrival be who is so brash and unmannerly?’
Even as she wondered, a beautiful young woman entered from the room behind the
one they were sitting in, surrounded by a bevy of serving women and maids. She was
dressed quite differently from the others present, gleaming like some fairy princess
with sparkling jewels and gay embroideries.
Her chignon was enclosed in a circlet of gold filigree and clustered pearls. It was
fastened with a pin embellished with flying phoenixes, from whose beaks pearls were
suspended on tiny chains.
Her necklet was of red gold in the form of a coiling dragon. Her dress had a fitted
bodice and was made of dark red silk damask with a pattern of flowers and
butterflies in raised gold thread.
Her jacket was lined with ermine. It was of a slate-blue stuff with woven insets in
coloured silks.
Her under-skirt was of a turquoise-coloured imported silk crêpe embroidered with
flowers.
She had, moreover,
eyes like a painted phoenix,
eyebrows like willow-eaves,
a slender form,
seductive grace;
the ever-smiling summer face
of hidden thunders showed no trace;
the ever-bubbling laughter started
almost before the lips were parted.
‘You don’t know her,’ said Grandmother Jia merrily. ‘She’s a holy terror this one.
What we used to call in Nanking a “peppercorn”. You just call her “Peppercorn Feng”.
She’ll know who you mean!’
Dai-yu was at a loss to know how she was to address this Peppercorn Feng until one
of the cousins whispered that it was ‘Cousin Lian’s wife’, and she remembered having
heard her mother say that her elder uncle, Uncle She, had a son called Jia Lian who
was married to the niece of her Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. She had been
brought up from earliest childhood just like a boy, and had acquired in the
schoolroom the somewhat boyish-sounding name of Wang Xi-feng. Dai-yu
accordingly smiled and curtseyed, greeting her by her correct name as she did so.
Xi-feng took Dai-yu by the hand and for a few moments scrutinized her carefully from
top to toe before conducting her back to her seat beside Grandmother Jia.
‘She’s a beauty, Grannie dear! If I hadn’t set eyes on her today, I shouldn’t have
believed that such a beautiful creature could exist! And everything about her so
distingué!She doesn’t take after your side of the family, Grannie. She’s more like a Jia.
I don’t blame you for having gone on so about her during the past few days—but
poor little thing! What a cruel fate to have lost Auntie like that!’ and she dabbed at
her eyes with a handkerchief.
‘I’ve only just recovered,’ laughed Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t you go trying to start me
off again! Besides, your little cousin is not very strong, and we’ve only just managed
to get her cheered up. So let’s have no more of this!’
In obedience to the command Xi-feng at once exchanged her grief for merriment.
‘Yes，of course. It was just that seeing my little cousin here put everything else out
of my mind. It made me want to laugh and cry all at the same time. I’m afraid I quite
forgot about you, Grannie dear. I deserve to be spanked, don’t I?’
She grabbed Dai-yu by the hand.
‘How old are you dear? Have you begun school yet? You mustn’t feel home sick
here. If there’s anything you want to eat or anything you want to play with, just come
and tell me. And you must tell me if any of the maids or the old nannies are nasty to
you.’

Dai-yu made appropriate responses to all of these questions and injunctions.
Xi-feng turned to the servants.
‘Have Miss Lin’s things been brought in yet? How many people did she bring with
her? You’d better hurry up and get a couple of rooms swept out for them to rest in.’
While Xi-feng was speaking, the servants brought in tea and various plates of food,
the distribution of which she pro?ceeded to supervise in person.
Dai-yu noticed her Aunt Wang questioning Xi-feng on the side:
‘Have this month’s allowances been paid out yet?’
‘Yes. By the way, just now I went with some of the women to the upstairs
storeroom at the back to look for that satin. We looked and looked, but we couldn’t
find any like the one you described yesterday. Perhaps you misremembered.’
‘Oh well, if you can’t find it, it doesn’t really matter,’ said Lady Wang. Then, after a
moment’s reflection, ‘You’d better pick out a couple of lengths presently to have
made up into clothes for your little cousin here. If you think of it, send someone
round in the evening to fetch them!’
‘It’s already been seen to. I knew she was going to arrive within a day or two, so I
had some brought out in readiness. They are waiting back at your place for your
approval. If you think they are all right, they can be sent over straight away.’
Lady Wang merely smiled and nodded her head without saying anything.
The tea things and dishes were now cleared away, and Grandmother Jia ordered two
old nurses to take Dai-yu round to see her uncles; but Uncle She’s wife, Lady Xing,
hurriedly rose to her feet and suggested that it would be more convenient if she
were to take her niece round herself.
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You go now, then. There is no need for you to
come back afterwards.’
So having, together with Lady Wang, who was also return?ing to her quarters, taken
leave of the old lady, Lady Xing went off with Dai-yu, attended across the courtyard
as far as the covered way by the rest of the company.
A carriage painted dark blue and hung with kingfisher-blue curtains had been drawn
up in front of the ornamental gateway by some pages. Into this Aunt Xing ascended
hand in hand with Dai-yu. The old women pulled down the carriage blind and
ordered the pages to take up the shafts, the pages drew the carriage into an open
space and harnessed mules to it, and Dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the
west gate, east?wards past the main gate of the Rong mansion, in again through a big
black-lacquered gate, and up to an inner gate, where they were set down again.
Holding Dai-yu by the hand, Aunt Xing led her into a courtyard in the middle of what
she imagined must once have been part of the mansion’s gardens. This impression
was strengthened when they passed through a third gateway into the quarters
occupied by her uncle and aunt; for here the smaller scale and quiet elegance of the
halls, galleries and loggias were quite unlike the heavy magnificence and impos?ing
grandeur they had just come from, and ornamental trees and artificial rock
formations, all in exquisite taste, were to be seen on every hand.
As they entered the main reception hall, a number of heavily made-up and
expensively dressed maids and concubines, who had been waiting in readiness, came
forward to greet them.
Aunt Xing asked Dai-yu to be seated while she sent a ser?vant to call Uncle She. After
a considerable wait the servant returned with the following message:
‘The Master says he hasn’t been well these last few days, and as it would only upset
them both if he were to see Miss Lin now, he doesn’t feel up to it for the time being.
He says, tell Miss Lin not to grieve and not to feel homesick. She must think of her
grandmother and her aunts as her own family now. He says that her cousins may not
be very clever girls, but at least they should be company for her and help to take her
mind off things. If she finds anything at all here to distress her, she is to speak up at
once. She mustn’t feel like an outsider. She is to make herself completely at home.’
Dai-yu stood up throughout this recital and murmured polite assent whenever assent
seemed indicated. She then sat for about another quarter of an hour before rising to
take her leave. Her Aunt Xing was very pressing that she should have a meal with her
before she went, but Dai-yu smilingly replied that though it was very kind of her aunt
to offer, and though she ought really not to refuse, nevertheless she still had to pay
her respects to her Uncle Zheng, and feared that it would be disrespectful if she were
to arrive late. She hoped that she might accept on another occasion and begged her
aunt to excuse her.
‘In that case, never mind,’ said Lady Xing, and instructed the old nurses to see her
to her Uncle Zheng’s in the same carriage she had come by. Dai-yu formally took her
leave, and Lady Xing saw her as far as the inner gate, where she issued a few more
instructions to the servants and watched her niece’s carriage out of sight before
returning to her rooms.
Presently they re-entered the Rong mansion proper and Dai-yu got down from the
carriage. There was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate,
along which the old nurses now conducted her. Turning right, they led her down a
roofed passage-way along the back of a south-facing hall, then through an inner gate
into a large courtyard.
The big building at the head of the courtyard was connected at each end to galleries
running through the length of the side buildings by means of ‘stag’s head’ roofing
over the corners. The whole formed an architectural unit of greater sumptuous?ness
and magnificence than anything Dai-yu had yet seen that day, from which she
concluded that this must be the main inner hall of the whole mansion.
High overhead on the wall facing her as she entered the hall was a great blue board
framed in gilded dragons, on which was written in large gold characters

THE HALL OF EXALTED FELICITY

with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words ‘....
written for Our beloved Subject, Jia Yuan,.Duke of Rong-guo’, followed by the
Emperor’s private seal, a device containing the words ‘kingly cares’ and ‘royal brush’
in archaic seal-script.
A long, high table of carved red sandalwood, ornamented with dragons, stood
against the wall underneath. In the centre of this was a huge antique bronze ding,
fully a yard high, covered with a green patina. On the wall above the ding hung a long
vertical scroll with an ink-painting of a dragon emerg?ing from clouds and waves, of
the kind often presented to high court officials in token of their office. The ding was
flanked on one side by a smaller antique bronze vessel with a pattern of gold inlay
and on the other by a crystal bowl. At each side of the table stood a row of eight
yellow cedar-wood armchairs with their backs to the wall; and above the chairs hung,
one on each side, a pair of vertical ebony boards inlaid with a couplet in characters of
gold:
  (on the right-hand one)
May the jewel of learning shine in this house more effulgently than the sun and
moon.
  (on the left-hand one)
May the insignia of honour glitter in these halls more brilliantly than the starry sky.

This was followed by a colophon in smaller characters:

With the Respectful Compliments of your Fellow-
Student, Mu Shi, Hereditary Prince of Dong-an.

Lady Wang did not, however, normally spend her leisure hours in this main reception
hall, but in a smaller room on the east side of the same building. Accordingly the
nurses con?ducted Dai-yu through the door into this side apartment.
Here there was a large kang underneath the window, covered with a scarlet Kashmir
rug. In the middle of the kang was a dark-red bolster with a pattern of medallions in
the form of tiny dragons, and a long russet-green seating strip in the same pattern. A
low rose-shaped table of coloured lacquer-work stood at each side. On the left-hand
one was a small, square, four-legged ding, together with a bronze ladle, metal
chop?sticks, and an incense container. On the right-hand one was a narrow-waisted
Ru-ware imitation gu with a spray of freshly cut flowers in it.
In the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the
east wall. All had footstools in front of them and chair-backs and seat-covers in old
rose brocade sprigged with flowers. There were also narrow side-tables on which tea
things and vases of flowers were arranged, besides other furnishings which it would
be superfluous to enumerate.
The old nurses invited Dai-yu to get up on the kang; but guessing that the brocade
cushions arranged one on each side near the edge of it must be her uncle’s and
aunt’s places, she deemed it more proper to sit on one of the chairs against the wall
below. The maids in charge of the apartment served tea, and as she sipped it Dai-yu
observed that their clothing, make?up, and deportment were quite different from
those of the maids she had seen so far in other parts of the mansion.
Before she had time to finish her tea, a smiling maid came in wearing a dress of red
damask and a black silk sleeveless jacket which had scalloped borders of some
coloured material.
‘The Mistress says will Miss Lin come over to the other side, please.’
The old nurses now led Dai-yu down the east gallery to a reception room at the side
of the courtyard. This too had a kang. It was bisected by a long, low table piled with
books and tea things. A much-used black satin back-rest was pushed up against the
east wall. Lady Wang was seated on a black satin cushion and leaning against another
comfortable-looking back-rest of black satin somewhat farther forward on the
opposite side.
Seeing her niece enter, she motioned her to sit opposite her on the kang, but Dai-yu
felt sure that this must be her Uncle Zheng’s place. So, having observed a row of
three chairs near the kang with covers of flower-sprigged brocade which looked as
though they were in fairly constant use, she sat upon one of those instead. Only after
much further pressing from her aunt would she get up on the kang, and even then
she would only sit beside her and not in the position of honour opposite.
‘Your uncle is in retreat today,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He will see you another time.
There is, however, something I have got to talk to you about. The three girls are very
well-behaved children, and in future, when you are studying or sewing together, even
if once in a while they may grow a bit high-spirited, I can depend on them not to go
too far. There is only one thing that worries me. I have a little monster of a son who
tyrannizes over all the rest of this household. He has gone off to the temple today in
fulfillment of a vow and is not yet back; but you will see what I mean this evening.
The thing to do is never to take any notice of him. None of your cousins dare provoke
him.’
Dai-yu had long ago been told by her mother that she had a boy cousin who was
born with a piece of jade in his mouth and who was exceptionally wild and naughty.
He hated study and liked to spend all his time in the women’s apartments with the
girls, but because Grandmother Jia doted on him so much, no one ever dared to
correct him. She realized that it must be this cousin her aunt was now referring to.
‘Do you mean the boy born with the jade, Aunt?’ she asked. ‘Mother often told me
about him at home. She told me that he was one year older than me and that his
name was Bao-yu. But she said that though he was very willful, he always behaved
very nicely to girls. Now that I am here, I suppose I shall be spending all my time with
my girl cousins and not in the same part of the house as the boys. Surely there will be
no danger of my provoking him?’
Lady Wang gave a rueful smile. ‘You little know how things are here! Bao-yu is a law
unto himself. Because your grandmother is so fond of him she has thoroughly spoiled
him. When he was little he lived with the girls, so with the girls he remains now. As
long as they take no notice of him, things run quietly enough. But if they give him the
least encouragement, he at once becomes excitable, and then there is no end to the
mischief he may get up to. That is why I counsel you to ignore him. He can be all
honey-sweet words one minute and ranting and raving like a lunatic the next. So
don’t believe anything he says.’
Dai-yu promised to follow her aunt’s advice.
Just then a maid came in with a message that ‘Lady Jia said it was time for dinner’,
whereupon Lady Wang took Dai-yu by the hand and hurried her out through a back
door. Passing along a verandah which ran beneath the rear eaves of the hall they
came to a corner gate through which they passed into an alley-way running north
and south. At the south end it was traversed by a narrow little building with a short
passage-way running through its middle. At the north end was a white ?painted
screen wall masking a medium-sized gateway leading to a small courtyard in which
stood a very little house.
‘That,’ said Lady Wang, pointing to the little house, ‘is where your Cousin Lian’s
wife, Wang Xi-feng, lives, in case you want to see her later on. She is the person to
talk to if there is anything you need.’
There were a few young pages at the gate of the courtyard who, when they saw Lady
Wang coming, all stood to attention with their hands at their sides.
Lady Wang now led Dai-yu along a gallery, running from east to west, which brought
them out into the courtyard be?hind Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Entering these
by a back entrance, they found a number of servants waiting there who, as soon as
they saw Lady Wang, began to arrange the table and chairs for dinner. The ladies of
the house themselves took part in the service. Li Wan brought in the cups, Xi-feng
laid out the chopsticks, and Lady Wang brought in the soup.
The table at which Grandmother Jia presided, seated alone on a couch, had two
empty chairs on either side. Xi-feng tried to seat Dai-yu in the one on the left nearer
to her grand?mother —an honour which she strenuously resisted until her
grandmother explained that her aunt and her elder cousins’ wives would not be
eating with them, so that, since she was a guest, the place was properly hers. Only
then did she ask per?mission to sit, as etiquette prescribed. Grandmother Jia then
ordered Lady Wang to be seated. This was the cue for the three girls to ask
permission to sit. Ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite Dai-yu,
Tan-chun sat second on the left, and Xi-chun sat second on the right.
While Li Wan and Xi-feng stood by the table helping to distribute food from the
dishes, maids holding fly-whisks, spittoons, and napkins ranged themselves on either
side. In addition to these, there were numerous other maids and serving-women in
attendance in the outer room, yet not so much as a cough was heard throughout the
whole of the meal.
When they had finished eating, a maid served each diner with tea on a little tray.
Dai-yu’s parents had brought their daughter up to believe that good health was
founded on care?ful habits, and in pursuance of this principle, had always in?sisted
that after a meal one should allow a certain interval to elapse before taking tea in
order to avoid indigestion. How?ever, she could see that many of the rules in this
household were different from the ones she had been used to at home; so, being
anxious to conform as much as possible, she accepted the tea. But as she did so,
another maid preferred a spittoon, from which she inferred that the tea was for
rinsing her mouth with. And it was not, in fact, until they had all rinsed out their
mouths and washed their hands that another lot of tea was served, this time for
drinking.
Grandmother Jia now dismissed her lady servers, observing that she wished to enjoy
a little chat with her young grand children without the restraint of their grown-up
presence.
Lady Wang obediently rose to her feet and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, went
out, taking Li Wan and Wang Xi-feng with her.
Grandmother Jia asked Dai-yu what books she was studying.
‘The Four Books,’ said Dai-yu, and inquired in turn what books her cousins were
currently engaged on.
‘Gracious, child, they don’t study books,’ said her grand?mother; ‘they can barely
read and write!’
While they were speaking, a flurry of footsteps could be heard outside and a maid
came in to say that Bao-yu was back.
‘I wonder,’ thought Dai-yu, ‘just what sort of graceless creature this Bao-yu is going
to be!’
The young gentleman who entered in answer to her un?spoken question had a small
jewel-encrusted gold coronet on the top of his head and a golden headband low
down over his brow in the form of two dragons playing with a large pearl.
He was wearing a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of dark red material with a
pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold. It was confined at the waist
with a court girdle of coloured silks braided at regular intervals into elaborate clusters
of knotwork and terminating in long tassels.
Over the upper part of his robe he wore a jacket of slate-blue Japanese silk damask
with a raised pattern of eight large medallions on the front and with tasselled
borders.
On his feet he had half-length dress boots of black satin with thick white soles.
As to his person, he had:
a face like the moon of Mid-Autumn,
a complexion like flowers at dawn,
a hairline straight as a knife-cut,
eyebrows that might have been painted by an artist’s brush,
a shapely nose, and
eyes clear as limpid pools,
that even in anger seemed to smile,
and, as they glared, beamed tenderness the while.
Around his neck he wore a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon and a woven
cord of coloured silks to which the famous jade was attached.
Dai-yu looked at him with astonishment. How strange! How very strange! It was as
though she had seen him somewhere before, he was so extraordinarily familiar.
Bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother, who told him to come
after he had seen his mother, whereupon he turned round and walked straight out
again.
Quite soon he was back once more, this time dressed in a completely different outfit.
The crown and circlet had gone. She could now see that his side hair was dressed in a
number of small braids plaited with red silk, which were drawn round to join the long
hair at the back in a single large queue of glistening jet black, fastened at intervals
from the nape downwards with four enormous pearls and ending in a jewelled gold
clasp. He had changed his robe and jacket for a rather more worn-looking
rose-coloured gown, sprigged with flowers. He wore the gold torque and his jade as
before, and she observed that the collection of objects round his neck had been
further augmented by a padlock-shaped amulet and a lucky charm. A pair of
ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown, thrust
into black and white socks trimmed with brocade. In place of the formal boots he
was wearing thick-soled crimson slippers.
She was even more struck than before by his fresh com?plexion. The cheeks might
have been brushed with powder and the lips touched with rouge, so bright was their
natural colour.
His glance was soulful,
yet from his lips the laughter often leaped;
a world of charm upon that brow was heaped;
a world of feeling from those dark eyes peeped.
In short, his outward appearance was very fine. But appear?ances can be misleading.
A perceptive poet has supplied two sets of verses, to be sung to the tune of Moon On
West River, which contain a more accurate appraisal of our hero than the foregoing
descriptions.

1

        Oft-times he sought out what would make him sad;
        Sometimes an idiot seemed and sometimes mad.
        Though outwardly a handsome sausage-skin,
        He proved to have but sorry meat within.
        A harum-scarum, to all duty blind,
        A doltish mule, to study disinclined;
        His acts outlandish and his nature queer;
        Yet not a whit cared he how folk might jeer!
2
        Prosperous, he could not play his part with grace,
        Nor, poor, bear hardship with a smiling face.
        So shamefully the precious hours he’d waste
        That both indoors and out he was disgraced.
        For uselessness the world’s prize he might bear;
        His gracelessness in history has no peer.
        Let gilded youths who every dainty sample
        Not imitate this rascal’s dire example!


‘Fancy changing your clothes before you have welcomed the visitor!’ Grandmother
Jia chided indulgently on seeing Bao-yu back again. ‘Aren’t you going to pay your
respects to your cousin?’
Bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender, delicate girl whom he surmised to be
his Aunt Lin’s daughter and quickly went over to greet her. Then, returning to his
place and taking a seat, he studied her attentively. How different she seemed from
the other girls he knew!
Her mist-wreathed brows at first seemed to frown, yet were not frowning;
Her passionate eyes at first seemed to smile, yet were not merry.
Habit had given a melancholy cast to her tender face;
Nature had bestowed a sickly constitution on her delicate frame.
Often the eyes swam with glistening tears;
Often the breath came in gentle gasps.
In stillness she made one think of a graceful flower reflected in the water;
In motion she called to mind tender willow shoots caressed by the wind.
She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan;
And suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi.
Having completed his survey, Bao-yu gaved a laugh.
‘I have seen this cousin before.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How could you possibly have done?’
‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but her face seems so familiar that I have the
impression of meeting her again after a long separation.’
‘All the better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That means that you should get on well
together.’
Bao-yu moved over again and, drawing a chair up beside Dai-yu, recommenced his
scrutiny.
Presently: ‘Do you study books yet, cousin?’
‘No,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have only been taking lessons for a year or so. I can barely read
and write.’
‘What’s your name?’
Dai-yu told him.
‘What’s your school-name?’
‘I haven’t got one.’
Bao-yu laughed. ‘I’ll give you one, cousin. I think “Frowner” would suit you perfectly.’
‘Where’s your reference?’ said Tan-chun.
‘In the Encyclopedia of Men and Objects Ancient and Modern it says that
somewhere in the West there is a mineral called “dai” which can be used instead of
eye-black for painting the eye?brows with. She has this “dai” in her name and she
knits her brows together in a little frown. I think it’s a splendid name for her!’
‘I expect you made it up,’ said Tan-chun scornfully.
‘What if I did?’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are lots of made-up things in books—apart from
the Four Books, of course.’
He returned to his interrogation of Dai-yu.
‘Have you got a jade?’
The test of the company were puzzled, hut Dai-yu at once divined that he was asking
her if she too had a jade like the one he was born with.
‘No,’ said Dal-yu. ‘That jade of yours is a very rare object. You can’t expect
everybody to have one.’
This sent Bao-yu off instantly into one of his mad fits. Snatching the jade from his
neck he hurled it violently on the floor as if to smash it and began abusing it
passionately.
‘Rare object! Rare object! What’s so lucky about a stone that can’t even tell which
people are better than others? Beastly thing! I don’t want it!’
The maids all seemed terrified and rushed forward to pick it up, while Grandmother
Jia clung to Bao-yu in alarm.
‘Naughty, naughty boy! Shout at someone or strike them if you like when you are in
a nasty temper, but why go smashing that precious thing that your very life depends
on?’
‘None of the girls has got one,’ said Bao-yu, his face stream?ing with tears and
sobbing hysterically. ‘Only I have got one. It always upsets me. And now this new
cousin comes here who is as beautiful as an angel and she hasn’t got one either; so I
know it can’t be any good.’
‘Your cousin did have a jade once,’ said Grandmother Jia, coaxing him like a little
child, ‘but because when Auntie died she couldn’t bear to leave her little girl behind,
they had to let her take the jade with her instead. In that way your cousin could show
her mamma how much she loved her by letting the jade be buried with her; and at
the same time, whenever Auntie’s spirit looked at the jade, it would be just like
looking at her own little girl again.
‘So when your cousin said she hadn’t got one, it was only because she didn’t want
to boast about the good, kind thing she did when she gave it to her mamma. Now
you put yours on again like a good boy, and mind your mother doesn’t find out how
naughty you have been.’
So saying, she took the jade from the hands of one of the maids and hung it round
his neck for him. And Bao-yu, after reflecting for a moment or two on what she had
said, offered no further resistance.
At this point some of the older women came to inquire what room Dai-yu was to
sleep in.
‘Move Bao-yu into the closet-bed with me,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘and put Miss
Lin for the time being in the green muslin summer-bed. We had better wait until
spring when the last of the cold weather is over before seeing about the rooms for
them and getting them settled permanently.’
‘Dearest Grannie,’ said Bao-yu pleadingly, ‘I should be perfectly all right next to the
summer-bed. There’s no need to move me into your room. I should only keep you
awake.’
Grandmother Jia, after a moment’s reflection, gave her consent. She further gave
instructions that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were each to have one nurse and one maid to
sleep with them. The rest of their servants were to do night duty by rota in the
adjoining room. Xi-feng had already sent across some lilac-coloured hangings,
brocade quilts, satin coverlets and the like for Dai-yu’s bedding.
Dai-yu had brought only two of her own people with her from home. One was her
old wet-nurse Nannie Wang, the other was a little ten-year-old maid called
Snowgoose. Con?sidering Snowgoose too young and irresponsible and Nannie Wang
too old and decrepit to be of much real service, Grand?mother Jia gave Dai-yu one of
her own maids, a body-servant of the second grade called Nightingale. She also gave
orders that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were to be attended in other respects exactly like the
three girls: that is to say, apart from the one wet-nurse, each was to have four other
nurses to act as chaper?ones, two maids as body-servants to attend to their washing,
dressing, and so forth, and four or five maids for dusting and cleaning, running
errands and general duties.
These arrangements completed, Nannie Wang and Night?ingale accompanied Dai-yu
to bed inside the tent-like summer?-bed, while Bao-yu’s wet-nurse Nannie Li and his
chief maid Aroma settled him down for the night in a big bed on the other side of the
canopy.

Like Nightingale, Aroma had previously been one of Grand?mother Jia’s own maids.
Her real name was Pearl. Bao-yu’s grandmother, fearful that the maids who already
waited on her darling boy could not be trusted to look after him properly, had picked
out Pearl as a girl of tried and conspicuous fidelity and put her in charge over them. It
was Bao-yu who was responsible for the curious name ‘Aroma’. Discovering that
Pearl’s surname was Hua, which means ‘Flowers’, and having recently come across
the line

The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days

in a book of poems, he told his grandmother that he wanted to call his new maid
‘Aroma’, so ‘Aroma’ her name thence?forth became.
Aroma had a certain dogged streak in her nature which had made her utterly devoted
to Grandmother Jia as long as she was Grandmother Jia’s servant, but which caused
her to become just as exclusively and single-mindedly devoted to Bao-yu when her
services were transferred to him. Since she found his character strange and
incomprehensible, her simple devotion frequently impelled her to remonstrate with
him, and when, as invariably happened, he took not the least notice of what she said,
she was worried and hurt.
That night, when Bao-yu and Nannie Li were already asleep, Aroma could hear that
Dai-yu and Nightingale on their side of the canopy had still not settled down, so,
when she had finished taking down her hair and making herself ready for bed, she
tiptoed through the muslin curtains and in a friendly way inquired what was the
matter. Dai-yu invited her to sit down, and when she had seated herself on the edge
of the bed, Nightingale proceeded to tell her what was troubling her new mistress.
‘Miss Lin is all upset. She has just been crying her eyes out because she says she
only just arrived here today, and yet already she has started young hopeful off on one
of his turns. She says if that jade had been really smashed, it would have been all her
fault. That’s what she’s so upset about. I’ve had no end of a job trying to comfort her.’
‘You mustn’t take on so, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘You’ll see him do much stranger things
than that before he’s finished. If you allow yourself to feel hurt every time he carries
on like that, he will always be hurting you. Try not to be so sensitive; Miss!’
Dai-yu thanked her and promised to bear in mind what she had said, and after talking
a little longer, they all settled down and went to sleep.

*

Rising early next day, they visited Grandmother Jia to wish her a good morning and
then went over to Lady Wang’s. They found her closeted with Wang Xi-feng, deep in
discus?sion of a letter which had just arrived from Nanking, and attended by two
women who had come with a message from Lady Wang’s elder brother and
sister-in-law. Tan-chun and the girls told Dai-yu, who knew nothing of the matter
under discussion, that they were talking about Xue Pan, the son of their Aunt Xue
who lived in Nanking.
It seemed that Xue Pan, relying on wealth and family pull to protect him from the
consequences, had taken another man’s life. The case was at present under
investigation by the Ying-?tian-fu yamen. Their uncle Wang Zi-teng had been
informed of it, and had sent these messengers to the members of the family in the
Rong mansion to suggest that they should invite Xue Pan to the capital.
But the outcome of this discussion will be dealt with in the following chapter.

When Dai-yu and the girls went to call on Lady Wang, they found her in the midst of
discussing family affairs with the messengers from her elder brother and his wife and
heard talk of their aunt’s family in Nanking being involved in a case of manslaughter.
Since Lady Wang was obviously preoccupied with this matter, the girls went off to call
on Li Wan.
Li Wan’s husband Jia Zhu had died young, but fortunately not without issue. He left
her a son called Jia Lan who was now’ just five years old and had already begun his
schooling. Like most of the Jia women, Li Wan was the daughter of a dis?tinguished
Nanking official. Her father, Li Shou-zhong, had been a Director of Education.
Up to Li Shou-zhong’s time, all members of the clan, in?cluding the women, had been
given a first-class education; but when Li Shou-zhong became head of the family, he
founded his educational policy for girls on the good old maxim ‘a stupid woman is a
virtuous one’ and, when he had a daughter of his own, refused to let her engage in
serious study. She was permitted to work her way through The Four Books for Girls
and Lives of Noble Women, so that she might be able to recog?nize a few characters
and be familiar with some of the models of female virtue of former ages; but
overriding importance was to be attached to spinning and sewing, and even her
name ‘Wan’, which means a kind of silk, was intended to symbolize her dedication to
the needle.
Thanks to her upbringing, this young widow living in the midst of luxury and
self-indulgence was able to keep herself like the ‘withered tree and dead ashes’ of
the philosopher, shutting out everything that did not concern her and attending only
to the duties of serving her husband’s parents and bringing up her child. Whatever
leisure this left her was devoted to her little sister-in-law and cousins, accompanying
them at their embroidery or hearing them recite their lessons.
With such gentle companions to console her, Dai-yu, though a stranger and far from
home, soon had nothing apart from her old father that she need worry about.
*

Let us now turn to the affairs of Jia Yu-cun, newly installed in the yamen at
Ying-tian-fu.
No sooner had he arrived at his new post than a case in?volving manslaughter was
referred to his tribunal. It con?cerned two parties in dispute over the purchase of a
slave-girl. Neither had been willing to give way to the other, and in the ensuing affray
one of the parties had been wounded and had subsequently died. After reading the
papers in the case, Yu-cun summoned the plaintiff for questioning and received from
him the following account of what had happened:
‘The murdered man was my master, Your Honour. Although he did not realize it at
the time, the girl he purchased had been kidnapped by the man who was selling her.
My master paid him in advance, and arranged to receive the girl into his house three
days from the date of purchase, the third day being a lucky day. The kidnapper,
having already pocketed my young master’s money, then quietly went off and sold
her again to Xue. When we found this out, we went along to seize him and to collect
the girl.
‘But unfortunately this Xue turned out to be a powerful Nanking boss, who
evidently thought that by money and influence he could get away with anything. He
set a crowd of his henchmen on to my young master and beat him up so badly that
he died.
‘Xue and his henchmen have now disappeared without trace, leaving only a few
retainers who were not involved in the crime. But though it is a year since I first
brought this charge, no one has yet done anything to help me. I beseech Your Honour
to arrest the criminals and to uphold the course of justice! Both the living and the
dead will be everlastingly grateful to you if you do!’
‘This is monstrous!’ said Yu-cun in a towering rage. ‘Am I to understand that a man
can be beaten to death and the murderer walk off scot-free with nobody lifting a
finger to arrest him?’ and he took up a warrant and was on the point of sending his
runners to seize the murderer’s dependants and bring them to court so that they
might be put to the torture, when he observed one of the ushers signalling to him
with his eyes not to issue the warrant. His resolution somewhat shaken, he put it
down again and adjourned to his private chambers, dismissing everyone except the
usher, whom he ordered to remain behind in attendance.
When they were alone together the usher, with a broad smile on his face, came
forward and touched his hand and knee to the ground in the Manchu salute.
‘Your Honour has gone a long way up in the world during these past eight or nine
years! I don’t expect you would remember me!’
‘Your face is certainly familiar,’ said Yu-cun, ‘but for the moment I simply can’t place
it.’
The usher smiled again. ‘Has Your Honour forgotten the place you started from? Do
you remember nothing of the old times in Bottle-gourd Temple?’
With a start of recognition, Yu-cun remembered. The usher had been a little novice
in the temple where he once lodged
Finding himself homeless after the fire, and bethinking him?self that a post in a
yamen was a fine, gentlemanly way of earn?ing a living, and being furthermore
heartily sick of the rigours of monastic life, the little novice had taken advantage of
his youth to grow his hair again and get himself a post as an usher. Small wonder that
Yu-cun had failed to recognize him!
‘Ah, so it was an old acquaintance!’ said Yu-cun, grasping him warmly by the hand
and urging him to sit down for a chat. But the usher would not be seated.
‘Come,’ said Yu-cun, ‘as a friend of my early, hard-up days you are entitled to. After
all, this is a private room. Why not?’
The usher permitted himself to perch one of his haunches sideways on the edge of a
chair.
‘Tell me,’ said Yu-cun, ‘why did you stop me issuing that warrant just now?’
‘Your Honour is new to this post. Surely you must have provided yourself before
you left with a copy of the Mandarin’s Life-Preserver for this province?’
‘What is the Mandarin’s Lift-Preserver?’ Yu-cun inquired curiously.
‘Nowadays every provincial official carries a private hand-list with the names of all
the richest, most influential people in his area. There is one for every province. They
list those families which are so powerful that if you were ever to run up against one
of them unknowingly, not only your job, but perhaps even your life might be in
danger. That’s why they are called “life-preservers”.
‘Now take this Xue you were dealing with just now. Your Honour couldn’t possibly
try conclusions with him! Why do you suppose this case has remained unsettled for
so long? It’s a straightforward enough case. The reason is simply that none of your
predecessors dared touch it because of the unpleasant?ness and loss of face it would
have caused them.’
While he was speaking he had been fishing for a copy of the Mandarin’s
Lift-Preserver in his pocket. This he now presented to Yu-cun for his inspection. It
contained a set of doggerel verses in which were listed the big families and most
powerful magnates of the area in which he was working. It went some-thing like this:
Shout hip hurrah
For the Nanking Jia!
They weigh their gold out
By the jar.
The Ah-bang Palace
Scrapes the sky,
But it could not house
The Nanking Shi.
The King of the Ocean
Goes along,
When he’s short of gold beds,
To the Nanking Wang.
The Nanking Xue
So rich are they,
To count their money
Would take all day...
Before Yu-cun had time to read further, a warning chime from the inner gate and a
shout outside the door announced the arrival of a Mr Wang on an official call. Yu-cun
hastily donned the hat and robe of office which he had temporarily laid aside and
went out to meet the visitor. About the length of time it would take to eat a meal
elapsed before he returned and re?sumed his conversation with the usher.
‘Those four families,’ said the usher in answer to a question from Yu-cun, ‘are all
closely connected with each other. A loss for one is a loss for all. A gain for one is a
gain for all. The Xue who has been charged with the manslaughter is one of the
“Nanking Xue so rich are they”. Not only can he count on the support of the other
three Nanking families, he also has any number of family friends and connections of
his own both at the capital and in the provinces. Now who are you going to arrest?’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Yu-cun with an uneasy laugh, ‘but how am I going to settle
this case? Incidentally, I assume you know perfectly well where the criminal is
hiding?’
‘I wouldn’t deceive Your Honour,’ replied the usher with a grin, ‘not only do I know
where the criminal has gone but I also know who the kidnapper is and all about the
poor devil who was killed. Let me tell you the whole story.
‘The man who was killed was a poor country squire’s son called Feng Yuan. His
father and mother were both dead and he had no brothers. He lived off the income
of a very small estate. He was eighteen or nineteen when he died. He was a
confirmed queer and not interested in girls. Which shows that the whole business
must have been fated, because no sooner did he set eyes on this girl than he at once
fell in love with her—swore he would never have anything more to do with boys and
never have any other woman but her. That was the idea of this waiting three days
before she came to him. To make it seem more like a wedding and less like a sale.
‘What he couldn’t foresee, of course, was that the kid?napper would use this
interval to resell her on the sly to Xue, hoping to pocket the money from both parties
and then do a flit. Only he didn’t get away with it. The two parties nabbed him before
he could disappear and beat the daylights out of him. Both refused to take back their
money, and both insisted that they wanted the girl. It was at this point that our
young friend Xue called for his roughs to get to work on Feng Yuan. They beat him till
he was hardly recognizable. Then they picked him up and carried him home. He died
three days later.
‘Now long before any of this happened, young Xue had made arrangements for a
journey to the capital. So after killing Feng and carrying off the girl, he set off with his
family, calm as you please, on the appointed day. There was no question of his
running away because of the killing. In his eyes a trifling matter like taking another
man’s life was something for his junior clansmen or the servants to clear up in his
absence.
‘But never mind him. Who do you think the slave-girl is?’
‘How in the world should I know?’ said Yu-cun.
The usher smiled maliciously. ‘You ought to, Your Honour! She is your great
benefactress —Ying-lian, the little daughter of Mr Zhen, who used to live next door
to Bottle-gourd Temple.’
‘Good gracious!’ said Yu-cun in astonishment. ‘I had heard that she was kidnapped
at the age of five. But how did she come to be sold so long after the kidnapping?’
‘This type of kidnapper specializes in kidnapping very young girls and rearing them
until they are twelve or thirteen for sale in other parts of the country. When she was
little we used to play with Ying-lian at the temple nearly every day, so I knew her very
well; and when I saw her again, even though it was after an interval of seven or eight
years, I could tell it was her. She’d grown into a little woman in the meantime, but her
features were still the same; and to confirm it there was a tiny red birthmark right in
the middle of her brow which I remembered.
‘By a strange coincidence the kidnapper had rented one of my rooms, and one day
when he was out I put it to her who she was. But she said she was scared of being
beaten and nothing would induce her to talk. She just kept insisting that the
kidnapper was her real father, selling her because he had no money to pay his debts
with. I kept on at her, cajoling and persuading, and in the end she broke down and
cried. Said she didn’t remember anything about her childhood. But there’s no doubt
in my mind. It’s her, all right.
‘The day young Feng met her and paid out the money for her, the kidnapper got
drunk, and she opened up to me a bit. She was feeling very relieved. She said, “Today
I think my tribulations are at last coming to an end.” But then later, when she heard
that she wasn’t to be installed until after another three days, she began to look
worried and despondent again. I felt truly sorry for her, and sent the wife round to
have a talk with her while the kidnapper was out and give her a bit of
encouragement.
‘The wife said to her, “Mr Feng’s insistence on waiting three days before taking you
in shows that he doesn’t intend to treat you like a servant. Besides,” she said, “he’s a
very nice, handsome gentleman, and quite comfortably off. Normally he doesn’t like
the fair sex, yet here he is spending everything he has on your purchase. You can tell
from that,” she said, “how much he must care for you. You only have to be patient for
another day or two,” she said. “You’ve no cause to be down?cast.”
‘Well, that seemed to cheer her up a bit, and she began to feel that life was going
to be worth living.
‘But only the day after that, by the most accursed stroke of bad luck which no one
could possibly have foreseen, she was sold to Xue. Now if it had been anyone else, it
wouldn’t have mattered so much, but this young Xue, whose nickname is the Oaf
King, is the world’s most bad-tempered bully; and having spent money like water on
buying the girl only to find that she wasn’t willing, he knocked her about until she
was half un?conscious and dragged her off with him more dead than alive. Whether
she’s alive or dead now, I have no idea.
‘And young Feng is really to be pitied! After a brief moment of happiness, before
anything had come his way, he spent all his money and laid down his life for nothing!’
Yu-cun sighed sympathetically. ‘Their meeting cannot have been coincidental. It must
have been the working out of some destiny. An atonement. Otherwise, how is one to
account for Feng Yuan’s sudden affection for that particular girl?
‘And Ying-lian, after all those years of ill-treatment at the hands of her kidnapper,
suddenly seeing a road to freedom opening in front of her—for she was a girl of
feeling, and there is no doubt that they would have made a fine couple if they had
succeeded in coming together—and then for this to have happened!
‘And even though Xue may be far wealthier and better-placed than Feng was, a
man like that is sure to have numbers of concubines and paramours and to be
licentious and de?bauched in his habits—quite incapable of concentrating all his
affections on one girl as Feng Yuan would have done.
‘A real case of an ideal romance on the one hand and a pair of unlucky young
things on the other adding up to make a tragedy!
‘But a truce to this discussion of other people’s affairs! Let us rather consider how
this case is to be settled!’
‘Your Honour used to be decisive enough in the old days,’ said the usher with a
smile. ‘What has become of your old resolution today? Now, I was told that your
promotion to this post was due to the combined influence of the Jias and the Wangs;
and this Xue Pan is related to the Jias by marriage. Why not trim your sails to the
wind in your handling of this case? Why not make a virtue of necessity by doing them
a favour which will stand you in good stead next time you see them?’
‘What you say is, of course, entirely correct,’ said Yu-cun. ‘But there is, after all, a
human life involved in this case; and you have to remember that I have only just been
restored to office by an act of Imperial clemency. I really cannot bring myself to
pervert justice for private ends at the very mo?ment when I ought to be doing my
utmost to show my gratitude.’
The usher smiled coldly. ‘What Your Honour says is no doubt very right and proper,
but it won’t wash. Not the way things are in the world today! Haven’t you heard the
old say?ing “The man of spirit shapes his actions to the passing moment”? And
there’s another old saying: “It is the mark of a gentleman to avoid what is
inauspicious”. If you were to act in accordance with what you have just said, not only
would you not be able to show your gratitude to the Emperor, but also you would
probably put your own life in danger. If I were you, I should think very carefully
before you do any?thing.’
Yu-cun lowered his head in thought. After a very long pause he asked, ‘What do you
think I ought to do?’
‘I’ve thought of a very good solution,’ said the usher. ‘When you open court
tomorrow, you should make a great display of authority. Send out writs, issue
warrants for arrest, and so forth. You won’t, of course, be able to arrest the cul?prits,
and the plaintiffs will certainly not allow the matter to rest there; so what you do
then is to arrest some of Xue’s clans?men and servants for questioning. But in the
meantime I shall have got to work on them on the side and arranged for them to
report that Xue has died of sudden illness. This can be supported by the affidavits of
the whole Xue clan and the people living in the neighbourhood.
‘Then Your Honour has it put about that you have a gift for the planchette. You
have an altar set up in the court and a planchette board installed on it and you issue
an open invita?tion to any members of the public who want to to attend a séance.
Then you say, “The spirit control gives judgment as follows:
‘“The dead man, Feng Yuan, owed a debt of karma to Xue Pan from a former life
and ‘meeting his enemy in a narrow way’, paid for it with his life. The sudden,
unexplained illness which struck down Xue Pan was caused by the vengeful ghost of
Feng Yuan come to claim its own. Since the tragedy was entirely due to the behaviour
of the kidnapper, the kidnapper should be dealt with according to the full rigour of
the law; but apart from him, all other parties are exonerated...” and so on and so
forth.
‘I shall secretly instruct the kidnapper to make a full con?fession, and when the
public see that the judgment given by the planchette tallies with the confession
made by the kidnapper, they will naturally have no suspicions.
‘Then you award the Fengs compensation to cover funeral expenses and so on. And
since the Xues are rolling in money, you can say anything you like. Five hundred, a
thousand—it doesn’t matter. There’s no one of any importance on the Feng side, and
in any case they’re mainly in this for the money. So once they have got their
compensation, they shouldn’t give you any further trouble.
‘What about that for a plan, Your Honour? You just think it over!’
Yu-cun laughed. ‘Too risky! Let me turn it over in my mind a little longer. The main
thing is to think of something that will stop people talking.’
And with this observation the two men concluded their discussion.
At next day’s session a group of well-known associates of the wanted man were
brought in and subjected by Yu-cun to careful questioning. It emerged, as the usher
had said, that the Fengs were few in number and had brought this action solely in the
hope of gaining some compensation, and that it was only because the Xues had, with
the arrogance of the very rich and very powerful, refused to pay a penny, that the
case had been brought to a standstill.
By a judicious bending of the law to suit the circumstances, Yu-cun managed to arrive
at some sort of judgment whereby the plaintiffs received substantial compensation
and went off tolerably well satisfied. He then hurriedly drafted and sent off two
letters, one to Jia Zheng and one to Wang Zi-teng, Commandant, Metropolitan
Barracks, in which he merely stated that their ‘nephew’s affair had been settled and
there was no further cause for concern’.
Fearful that the now usher and quondam novice of Bottle-gourd Temple might talk to
others about the days when he was an obscure and impoverished student, Yu-cun for
some time went about in great discomfort of mind. Finally, how?ever, he managed to
catch him out in some misdemeanour or other and have him drafted for military
service on a frontier outpost, after which he felt able to breathe freely again.



*

But now no more of Yu-cun. Let us turn instead to Young Xue, the man who
purchased Ying-lian and had Feng Yuan beaten to death. He was a native of Nanking
and came of a refined and highly cultivated family, but having lost his father in
infancy and been, as sole remaining scion of the stock, exces?sively indulged by a
doting widowed mother, he had grown up into a useless lout. The family was
immensely wealthy. As one of the official Court Purveyors they received money from
the Privy Purse with which to make purchases for the Imperial Household.
Xue Pan, to give him his full name, was a naturally ex?travagant young man with an
insolent turn of speech. He had been educated after a fashion, but could barely read
and write. He devoted the greater part of his time to cock-fighting, horse-racing, and
outings to places of scenic interest. Though an Imperial Purveyor, he was wholly
innocent of business skill and savoir-faire; and though, for his father’s and
grand?father’s sake, he was allowed to register at the Ministry and receive regular
payments of grain and money, everything else was looked after for him by the clerks
and factors of the family business.
Xue Pan’s widowed mother was a younger half-sister of Wang Zi-teng, at that time
Commandant of the Metropolitan Barracks, and younger sister of Lady Wang, the
wife of Jia Zheng of the Rong mansion. She was now around fifty and had only the
one son. Besides Xue Pan she had a daughter two years his junior called Bao-chai, a
girl of flawless looks and great natural refinement. While her father was still alive she
had been his favourite and had been taught to read and write and construe—all of
which she did ten times better than her oafish brother; but when he died and her
brother proved incapable of offering their mother any comfort, she laid aside her
books and devoted herself to needlework and housewifely duties in order to take
some of the burden off her mother’s shoulders.
The well-known interest always shown by our present sovereign in literature and the
arts, and the widespread re?cruitment of talent that this has stimulated, had recently,
at the time of which we speak, led to an unprecedented act of Imperial grace
whereby daughters of hereditary officials and distinguished families, apart from the
possibility of being recruited to the Imperial seraglio by the customary pro?cedures,
were permitted to have their names sent in to the Ministry for selection as
study-companions, with the rank and title of Maid of Honour or Lady-in-waiting, of
the Imperial princesses and the daughters of princes of the blood.
This circumstance, coupled with the fact that, since the death of his father, the
managers, clerks, and factors of the family business in its various agencies
throughout the pro?vinces had profited from Xue Pan’s youth and ignorance of affairs
to feather their own nests at the firm’s expense, and even the family’s enterprises in
the capital, of which there were several, had shown a gradual falling-off, provided
Xue Pan, who had long heard of the rich pleasures of the metropolis and was agog to
taste them, with excuses for realizing his cherished ambition, viz:
1.They must go to the capital because he had to present his sister to the Ministry for
selection.
2. They must go to the capital to look up their kinsfolk there.
3. They must go to the capital so that he might clear his accounts with the Ministry
and take receipt of a new install?ment of funds.
(Needless to say, the sole substantial reason for going to the capital, Xue Pan’s desire
to see the sights, was unexpressed.)
Accordingly, their baggage had long been packed and souvenirs of Nanking for their
friends and relations in the capital long been selected and a date for their departure
long been decided on, when Xue Pan encountered the kidnapper and Ying-lian and,
as Ying-lian was an uncommonly attractive slave-girl, resolved to purchase her and
make her his concu?bine.
Then Feng and his servants came to seize the girl and Xue Pan, confident in his
superior forces, shouted the command to his attendant roughs which was to have
such fatal con?sequences for poor Feng Yuan.
Entrusting everything to his clansmen and a few old and trusty retainers, he then
proceeded to depart according to schedule, in company with his mother and sister,
on the long journey to the capital, accounting the charge of manslaughter a mere
bagatelle which the expenditure of a certain amount of coin could confidently be
expected to resolve.
Of the journey our story gives no record, except to say that on the last day, when
they were about to enter the capital, they heard news that Xue Pan’s uncle Wang
Zi-teng had just been promoted C.-in-C. Northern Provinces with instructions to leave
the capital on a tour of frontier inspection. The news secretly delighted Xue Pan.
‘Just as I was worrying about Uncle cramping my style when we got to the capital
and preventing me from having a really good fling,’ he reflected, ‘the old boy
obligingly gets himself popped out of the way. Fortune is on my side!’
He then proceeded to reason as follows with his mother:
‘We’ve got several houses in the capital, but it’s all of ten years since anyone has
been to stay in them, so you can bet that the housekeepers will have let all the
rooms out on the sly. We shall have to send someone on ahead to get things
straightened out for us.’
‘Whyever should we go to any such trouble?’ said his mother. ‘I thought the main
purpose of our coming here in the first place was to see our relations. There must be
lots and lots of spare room at your Uncle Wang’s and at your Uncle Jia’s place. Surely
it would be much more sensible to stay with one of them first? There will be plenty
of time to send our people to get a place of our own ready after we are there.’
‘But Uncle’s just been promoted to the Northern Provinces,’ Xue Pan expostulated.
‘They will all be making frantic prepara?tions for him to go. What sort of stupid idiots
shall we look like if we come scooting along with all our bag and baggage just at the
very moment when he wants to leave?’
‘Suppose your Uncle Wang has been promoted to another place,’ said his mother.
‘There is still your Uncle Jia. Besides, Uncle Wang and Auntie Jia have for years been
sending us letters inviting us to come and stay with them. Now that we are here,
even though Uncle Wang is busy getting ready to go, Auntie Jia will probably be only
too glad to have us. I’m sure she would be most offended if we were to go rushing off
to get our own house ready.
‘But I know perfectly well what’s in your mind. You think that if we are staying with
your uncle or aunt you will be too restricted, and that if we were living in our own
place you would be freer to do just as you liked. Very well then. Why don’t you go off
and choose a house for yourself to live in and let me and your sister go to Auntie’s
without you? I haven’t seen her or the girls for years and years, and I intend to spend
a few days with them now we are here.’
Experience taught Xue Pan that his mother was in an obstinate mood and not to be
shaken from her purpose, so he resignedly gave orders to the porters to make
straight for the Rong mansion.

Lady Wang had just breathed a sigh of relief on learning that the affair of Xue Pan’s
manslaughter charge had been retrieved through the good offices of Jia Yu-cun,
when the news that her elder brother had been promoted to a frontier post plunged
her once more in gloom at the prospect of losing her main source of contact with the
members of her own family. Several days passed in despondency, and then suddenly
the servants announced that her sister, bringing her son and daughter and all her
household with her, had arrived in the capital and was at that very moment outside
the gate dismount?ing from her carriage.
Delightedly she hurried with her women to the entrance of the main reception hall
and conducted Aunt Xue and her party inside. The sudden reunion of the two sisters
was, it goes with?out saying, an affecting one in which joy and sorrow mingled. After
an exchange of information about the years of separa?tion, and after they had been
taken to see Grandmother Jia and made their reverence to her, and after the gifts of
Nanking produce had been presented and everyone had been introduced to
everyone else, there was a family party to welcome the new arrivals.
Xue Pan, meanwhile, had paid his respects to Jia Zheng and Jia Lian and been taken
to see Jia She and Cousin Zhen. Jia Zheng now sent a servant round to Lady Wang
with the follow?ing message:
‘Your sister is getting on in years and our nephew is very young and seems rather
inexperienced and, I fear, quite capable of getting into a scrape again if they are going
to live outside. Pear Tree Court in the north-east corner of our property is lying
completely unoccupied at the moment and has quite a sizeable amount of room in it.
Why not invite your sister and her children to move in there?’
Lady Wang had wanted all along to ask her sister to stay. Grandmother Jia had sent
someone round to tell her that she should ‘ask Mrs Xue to stay with us here, so that
we can all be close to one another.’ And Aunt Xue for her own part had been wanting
to stay so that some sort of check could be kept on her son. She was sure that if they
were to be on their own somewhere else in the city his unbridled nature would
precipitate some fresh calamity. She therefore accepted the in?vitation with alacrity,
privately adding the proviso that she could only contemplate a long stay if it was on
the understanding that they were themselves to be responsible for all their expenses.
Lady Wang knew that money was no problem to them, so she readily consented, and
Aunt Xue and her children proceeded there and then to move into Pear Tree Court.
This Pear Tree Court had been the Duke of Rong-guo’s retreat during the last years of
his life. Its buildings totalled not much more than ten frames; but though small and
charm?ing, it was complete in every respect, with a little reception room in the front
and all the usual rooms and offices behind. It had its own outer door on to the street,
through which Xue Pan and the menservants could come and go, and another gate in
the south-west corner giving on to a passage-way which led into the courtyard east
of Lady Wang’s compound.
Through this passage-way Aunt Xue would now daily repair, either after dinner or in
the evening, to gossip with Grandmother Jia or reminisce with her sister, Lady Wang.
Bao-chai for her part spent her time each day in great con?tentment, reading or
playing Go or sewing with Dai-yu and the three girls.
The only dissatisfied member of the party - to begin with, at any rate—was Xue Pan.
He had not wanted to stay in the Jia household, fearing that his uncle’s control would
prevent him from enjoying himself, but what with his mother’s obstinacy and the
insistence of the Jias themselves, he was obliged to acquiesce in settling there for the
time being, contenting himself with sending some of his people to clean up one of
their houses outside so that he would be able to move there later on.
But, to his pleasant surprise, he discovered that the young males of the Jia
establishment, half of whom he was already on familiar terms with before he had
been there a month, were of the same idle, extravagant persuasion as himself and
thought him a capital fellow and boon companion. And so he found himself meeting
them for a drinking-party one day, for theatre-going the next, on a third day perhaps
gambling with them or visiting brothels. For there were no limits to the depravity of
their pleasures, and Xue Pan, who was bad enough to start with, soon became ten
times worse under their expert guidance.
It was not that Jia Zheng was a slack disciplinarian, incapable of keeping his house in
order; but the clan was so numerous that he simply could not keep an eye on
everyone at once. And in any case the nominal head of the family was not Jia Zheng
but Cousin Zhen who, as eldest grandson of the senior, Ning-guo branch, had
inherited the founder’s office and emoluments and was therefore officially in charge
of all the clan’s affairs.
Besides, Jia Zheng was kept busy with public and private business of his own and,
being by nature a quiet, retiring man who attached little importance to mundane
affairs, tended to use whatever leisure time he had for reading and playing Go.
Then again, the Pear Tree Court was two courtyards away from Jia Zheng’s compound
and had its own private door onto the street by which Xue Pan could come and go as
he pleased, so that he and his young cronies could enjoy themselves to their heart’s
content with no one being any the wiser.
Under these agreeable Circumstances Xue Pan gradually abandoned all thought of
moving out.
But as to the outcome of these capers: that will be told in a later chapter.




CHAPTER 5

Jia Bao-yu visits the Land of Illusion
And the fairy Disenchantment performs the
‘Dream of Golden Days’
From the moment Lin Dai-yu entered the Rong mansion, Grandmother Jia’s solicitude
for her had manifested itself in a hundred different ways. The arrangements made for
her meals and accommodation were exactly the same as for Bao-yu. The other three
granddaughters, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi?-chun, were relegated to a secondary
place in the old lady’s affections, and the objects of her partiality themselves began
to feel an affection for each other which far exceeded what they felt for any of the
rest. Sharing each other’s company every minute of the day and sleeping in the same
room at night, they developed an understanding so intense that it was almost as if
they had grown into a single person.
And now suddenly this Xue Bao-chai had appeared on the scene—a young lady who,
though very little older than Dai-yu, possessed a grown-up beauty and aplomb in
which all agreed Dai-yu was her inferior. Moreover, in contrast to Dai-yu with her alt
of lofty self-sufficiency and total obliviousness to all who did not move on the same
exalted level as herself, Bao-chai had a generous, accommodating disposition which
greatly endeared her to subordinates, so that even the tiniest maid looked on Miss
Bao-chai as a familiar friend. Dai-yu could not but feel somewhat put out by this—a
fact of which Bao-chai herself, however, was totally unaware.
As for Bao-yu, he was still only a child—a child, moreover, whom nature had
endowed with the eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. Brothers, sisters, cousins,
were all one to him. In his relationships with people he made no distinction between
one person and another. If his relationship with Dai-yu was exceptional, it was
because greater proximity—since she was living with him in his grandmother’s
quarters—made her more familiar to him than the rest; and greater familiarity bred
greater intimacy.
And of course, with greater intimacy came the occasional tiffs and misunderstandings
that are usual with people who have a great deal to do with each other.
One day the two of them had fallen out over something or other and the argument
had ended with Dai-yu crying alone in her room and Bao-yu feeling remorsefully that
perhaps he had spoken too roughly. Presently he went in to make his peace with her
and gradually, very gradually, Dai-yu’s equani?mity was restored.
The Winter plum in the gardens of the Ning Mansion was now at its best, and this
particular day Cousin Zhen’s wife, You-shi, had some wine taken into the gardens and
came over in person, bringing her son Jia Rong and his young wife with her, to invite
Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing and Lady Wang to a flower-viewing party.
Grandmother Jia and the rest went round as soon as they had finished their breakfast.
The party was in the All-scents Garden. It began with tea and continued with Wine,
and as it was a family gathering confined to the ladies of the Ning and Rong
households, nothing particularly worth recording took place.
At one point in the party Bao-yu was overcome with tiredness and heaviness and
expressed a desire to take an afternoon nap. Grandmother Jia ordered some of the
servants to go back to the house with him and get him comfortably settled, adding
that they might return with him later when he was rested; but Qin-shi, the little wife
of Jia Rong, smilingly proposed an alternative.
‘We have got just the room here for Uncle Bao. Leave him to me, Grannie dear! He
will be quite safe in my hands.’
She turned to address the nurses and maidservants who were in attendance on
Bao-yu.
‘Come, my dears! Tell Uncle Bao to follow me.’
Grandmother Jia had always had a high opinion of Qin-shi’s trustworthiness—she
was such a charming, delightful little creature, the favourite among her
great-granddaughters-in-law—and was quite content to leave the arrangements to
her.
Qin-shi conducted Bao-yu and his little knot of attendants to an inner room in the
main building. As they entered, Bao-yu glanced up and saw a painting hanging above
them on the opposite wall. The figures in it were very finely executed. They
represented Scholarly Diligence in the person of the Han philosopher Liu Xiang at his
book, obligingly illuminated for him by a supernatural being holding a large flaming
torch. Bao-yu found the painting—or rather its subject—distasteful. But the pair of
mottoes which flanked it proved the last straw:
True learning implies a clear insight into human activities.
Genuine culture involves the skilful manipulation of human rela?tionships.
In vain the elegant beauty and splendid furnishings of the room! Qin-shi was given to
understand in no uncertain terms that her uncle Bao-yu wished to be out of it at
once.
‘If this is not good enough for you,’ said Qin-shi with a laugh, ‘where are we going
to put you? — unless you would like to have your rest in my bedroom.’
A little smile played over Bao-yu’s face and he nodded. The nurses were shocked.
‘An uncle sleep in the bedroom of his nephew’s wife! Who ever heard of such a
thing!’
Qin-shi laughed again.
‘He won’t misbehave. Good gracious, he’s only a little boy! We don’t have to worry
about that sort of thing yet! You know my little brother who came last month: he’s
the same age as Uncle Bao, but if you stood them side by side I shouldn’t be a bit
surprised if he wasn’t the taller of the two.’
‘Why haven’t I seen your brother yet?’ Bao-yu demanded. ‘Bring him in and let me
have a look at him!’
The servants all laughed.
‘Bring him in? Why, he’s ten or twenty miles away! But I expect you’ll meet him one
of these days.’
In the course of this exchange the party had made its way to Qin-shi’s bedroom. As
Bao-yu entered, a subtle whiff of the most delicious perfume assailed his nostrils,
making a sweet stickiness inside his drooping eyelids and causing all the joints in his
body to dissolve.
‘What a lovely smell!’
He repeated the words several times over.
Inside the room there was a painting by Tang Yin entitled ‘Spring Slumber’ depicting
a beautiful woman asleep under a crab-apple tree, whose buds had not yet opened.
The painting was flanked on either side by a pair of calligraphic scrolls inscribed with
a couplet from the brush of the Song poet Qin Guan:
(on one side)
The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream;
(on the other side)

The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents.

On a table stood an antique mirror that had once graced the tiring-room of the
lascivious empress Wu Ze-tian. Beside it stood the golden platter on which Flying
Swallow once danced for her emperor’s delight. And on the platter was that very
quince which the villainous An Lu-shan threw at beauti?ful Yang Gui-fei, bruising her
plump white breast. At the far end of the room stood the priceless bed on which
Princess Shou-yang was sleeping out of doors under the eaves of the Han-zhang
Palace when the plum-flower lighted on her fore?head and set a new fashion for
coloured patches. Over it hung a canopy commissioned by Princess Tong-chang
entirely fashioned out of ropes of pearls.
‘I like it here,’ said Bao-yu happily.
‘My room,’ said Qin-shi with a proud smile, ‘is lit for an immortal to sleep in.’ And
she unfolded a quilted coverlet, whose silk had been laundered by the fabulous Xi Shi,
and arranged the double head-rest that Hong-niang once carried for her amorous
mistress,
The nurses now helped Bao-yu into bed and then tiptoed out, leaving him attended
only by his four young maids: Aroma, Skybright, Musk, and Ripple. Qin-shi told them
to go outside and stop the cats from lighting on the eaves.
As soon as Bao-yu closed his eyes he sank into a confused sleep in which Qin-shi was
still there yet at the same time seemed to be drifting along weightlessly in front of
him. He followed her until they came to a place of marble terraces and vermilion
balustrades where there were green trees and crystal streams. Everything in this
place was so clean and so pure that it seemed as if no human foot could ever have
trodden there or floating speck of dust ever blown into it. Bao-yu’s dreaming self
rejoiced. ‘What a delightful place!’ he thought. ‘If only I could spend all my life here!
How much nicer it would be than living under the daily restraint of my parents and
teachers!’
These idle reflections were interrupted by someone singing a song on the other side
of a hill:
‘Spring’s dream-time will like drifting clouds disperse,
Its flowers snatched by a flood none can reverse.
Then tell each nymph and swain
‘Tis folly to invite love’s pain!’

It was the voice of a girl. Before its last echoes had died away, a beautiful woman
appeared in the quarter from which the voice had come, approaching him with a
floating, fluttering motion. She was quite unlike any earthly lady, as the following
poem will make clear:

She has left her willow-tree house, from her blossoming bower stepped out;
For the birds betray where she walks through the trees that cluster about,
And a shadow athwart the winding walk announces that she is near,
And a fragrance of musk and orchid from fluttering fairy sleeves,
And a tinkle of girdle-gems that falls on the ear
At each movement of her dress of lotus leaves.
A peach-tree blossoms in her dimpling cheek;
Her cloud-coiled tresses are halcyon-sleek;
And she reveals, through parted cherry lips,
Teeth like pomegranate pips.
Her slim waist’s sinuous swaying calls to mind
The dance of snowflakes with the waltzing wind;
Hair ornaments of pearl and halcyon blue
Outshine her painted forehead’s golden hue.
Her face, through blossoms fleetingly disclosed,
To mirth or ire seems equally disposed;
And as by the waterside she goes,
Hovering on light-stepping toes,
A half-incipient look of pique
Says she would speak, yet would not speak;
While her feet, with the same irresolution,
Would halt, yet would not interrupt their motion.
I contemplate her rate complexion,
Ice-pure and lade-like in perfection;
I marvel at her glittering dress,
Where art lends grace to sumptuousness;
I wonder at her fine-cut featured—
Marble, which fragrance marks as one with living creatures;
And I admire her queenly gait,
Like stately dance of simurgh with his mate.
Her purity I can best show
In plum-trees flowering in the snow;
Her chastity I shall recall
In orchids white at first frost-fall;
Her tranquil nature will prevail,
Constant as lone pine in an empty vale;
Her loveliness as dazzled make
As sunset gilding a pellucid lake;
Her glittering elegance I can compare
With dragons in an ornamental mere;
Her dreamy soulfulness most seems
Like wintry waters in the moon’s cold beams.
The beauties of days gone by by her beauty are all abashed.
Where was she born, and from whence descended?
Immortal I judge her, fresh come from fairy feastings by the Jasper Pool,
Or from fluting in starry balls, some heavenly concert ended.

Observing delightedly that the lady was a fairy, Bao-yu hurried forward and saluted
her with a smile.
‘Madam Fairy, I don’t know where you have come from or where you are going to,
but as I am quite lost in this place, will you please take me with you and be my
guide?’
‘I am the fairy Disenchantment,’ the fairy woman replied. ‘I live beyond the Realm
of Separation, in the Sea Of Sadness. There is a Mountain of Spring Awakening which
rises from the midst of that sea, and on that mountain is the Paradise of the
Full-blown Flower, and in that paradise is the Land of Illusion, which is my home. My
business is with the romantic passions, love-debts, girlish heartbreaks and male
philanderings of your dust-stained, human world. The reason I have come here today
is that recently there has been a heavy concen?tration of love-karma in this area, and
I hope to be able to find an opportunity of distributing a quantity of a amorous
thoughts by implanting them in the appropriate breasts. My meeting you here today
is no accident but a part of the same project.
‘This place where we are now is not so very far from my home. I have not much to
offer you, but would you like to come back with me and let me try to entertain you? I
have some fairy tea, which I picked myself. You could have a cup of that. And I have a
few jars of choice new wine of my own brewing. I have also been rehearsing a fairy
choir and a troupe of fairy dancers in a twelve-part suite which I recently com?posed
called “2222A Dream of Golden Days”. I could get them to perform it for you. What
do you think?’
Bao-yu was so excited by this invitation that he quite forgot to wonder what had
become of Qin-shi in his eagerness to accompany the fairy. As he followed her, a big
stone arch?way suddenly loomed up in front of them on which

THE LAND OF ILLUSION

was Written in large characters. A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed on
either side of the arch:

        Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true;
        Real becomes not-real when the unreal’s real.

Having negotiated the archway, they presently came to the gateway of a palace. The
following words were inscribed horizontally above the lintel:

SEAS OF PAIN AND SKIES OF PASSION

whilst the following words were inscribed vertically on the two sides:
         Ancient earth and sky
                Marvel that love’s passion should outlast all time.
                   Star-crossed men and maids
                Groan that love’s debts should be so hard to pay.


‘I see,’ said Bao-yu to himself. ‘I wonder what the meaning of “passion that outlasts
all time” can be. And what are “love’s debts”? From now on I must make an effort to
understand these things.’
He could not, of course, have known it, but merely by thinking this he had invited the
attentions of the demon Lust, and at that very moment a little of the demon’s evil
poison had entered Bao-yu’s body and lodged itself in the innermost recesses of his
heart.
Wholly unconscious of his mortal peril, Bao-yu continued to follow the fairy woman.
They passed through a second gateway, and Bao-yu saw a range of palace buildings
ahead of them on either hand. The entrance to each building had a board above it
proclaiming its name, and there were couplets on either side of the doorways.
Bao-yu did not have time to read all of the names, but he managed to make out a few,
viz:

DEPARTMENT OF FOND INFATUATION
DEPARTMENT OF CRUEL REJECTION
DEPARTMENT OF EARLY MORNING WEEPING
DEPARTMENT OP LATE NIGHT SOBBING
DEPARTMENT OF SPRING FEVER
DEPARTMENT OF AUTUMN GRIEF



‘Madam Fairy,’ said Bao-yu, whose interest had been whetted by what he had
managed to read, ‘couldn’t you take me inside these offices to have a look around?’
‘In these offices,’ said the fairy woman, ‘are kept registers in which are recorded the
past, present and future of girls from all over the world. It is not permitted that your
earthly eyes should look on things that are yet to come.’
Bao-yu was most unwilling to accept this answer, and begged and pleaded so
persistently that at last Disenchantment gave in.
‘Very well. You may make a very brief inspection of this office here.’
Delighted beyond measure, Bao-yu raised his head and read the notice above the
doorway:

DEPARTMENT OP THE ILL-FATED FAIR

The couplet inscribed vertically on either side of the doorway was as follows:

        Spring grieves and autumn sorrows were by yourselves provoked.
        Flower faces, moonlike beauty were to what end disclosed?

Bao-yu grasped enough of the meaning to be affected by its melancholy.
Passing inside, he saw a dozen or more large cupboards with paper strips pasted on
their doors on which were written the names of different provinces. He was careful
to look out for the one belonging to his own area and presently found one on which
the paper strip said ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Main Register’. Bao-yu asked
Disenchantment what this meant, and she explained that it was a register of the
twelve most out-standing girls of his home province.
‘People all say what a big place Jinling is,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Surely there should be more
than just twelve names? Why, even in my own home, if you count the servants, there
must be altogether several hundred girls.’
‘Certainly there area great many girls in the whole province,’ said Disenchantment
with a smile, ‘but only the most im?portant ones have been selected for recording in
this register. The registers in the cupboards on either side contain two other
selections from the same area. But of the host of ordinary girls outside those three
dozen we keep no records.’
Bao-yu glanced at the other two cupboards referred to by Disenchantment. One was
labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.1’; the other was
labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.2’. Stretching out his
hand he opened the door of the second one, took out Supplementary Register No.2,
which was like a large album, and opened it at the first page.
It was a picture, but not of a person or a view.⒈The whole page was covered with
dark ink washes representing storm-clouds or fog, followed on the next page by a
few lines of verse:

                 Seldom the moon shines in a cloudless sky,
                 And days of brightness all too soon pass by.
        A noble and aspiring mind
        In a base-born frame confined,
        Your charm and wit did only hatred gain,
        And in the end you were by slanders slain,
        Your gentle lord’s solicitude in vain.

Bao-yu could not make much sense of this, and turned to the next page. It was
another picture, this time of a bunch of fresh flowers and a worn-out mat, again
followed by a few limes of verse.

        What price your kindness and compliance,
                  1.See Appendix, p.527.
        Of sweetest flower the rich perfume?
        You chose the player fortune favoured,
        Unmindful of your master’s doom.

Bao-yu was even more mystified by this than by the first page, and laying the album
aside, opened the door of the cupboard marked ‘Supplementary Register No. I’ and
took out the album from that.
As in the previous album, the first page was a picture. It represented a branch of
cassia with a pool underneath. The water in the pool had dried up and the mud in
the bottom was dry and cracked. Growing from it was a withered and broken lotus
plant. The picture was followed by these lines:

        Your stem grew from a noble lotus root,
        Yet your life passed, poor flower, in low repute.
        The day two earths shall bear a single tree,
        Your soul must fly home to its own country.

Once more failing to make any sense of what he saw, Bao-yu picked up the Main
Register to look at. In this album the picture on the first page represented two dead
trees with a jade belt hanging in their branches and on the ground beneath them a
pile of snow in which a golden hairpin lay half-buried. This was followed by a
quatrain:

        One was a pattern of female virtue,
        One a wit who made other wits seem slow.
              The jade belt in the greenwood hangs,
              The gold pin is buried beneath the snow.
Still Bao-yu was unable to understand the meaning. He would have liked to ask, but
he knew that Disenchantment would be unwilling to divulge the secrets of her
immortal world. Yet though he could make no sense of the book, for some reason he
found himself unable this time to lay it down, and continued to look through it to the
end.
The picture that followed was of a bow with a citron hanging from it, followed by
what looked like the words of a song:

You shall, when twenty years in life’s hard school are done,
In pomegranate-time to palace halls ascend.
Though three springs never could with your first spring compare,
When hare meets tiger your great dream shall end.
Next was a picture of two people flying a kite. There was also a large expanse of sea
with a boat in it and a girl in the boat who had buried her face in her hands and
appeared to be crying. This was followed by a quatrain:

Blessed with a shrewd mind and a noble heart,
    Yet born in time of twilight and decay,
    In spring through tears at river’s bank you gaze,
    Borne by the wind a thousand miles away.
The next picture showed some scudding wisps of cloud and a stretch of running
water followed by these words:

        What shall avail you rank and riches,
        Orphaned while yet in swaddling bands you lay?
        Soon you must mourn your bright sun’s early setting.
        The Xiang flows and the Chu clouds sail away.

Next was a picture showing a beautiful jade which had fallen into the mud, followed
by words of judgement:

        For all your would-be spotlessness
        And vaunted otherworldliness,
        You that look down on common flesh and blood,
        Yourself impure, shall end up in the mud.

Next was a striking picture of a savage wolf pursuing a beautiful girl. He had just
seized her with his jaws and appeared to be about to eat her. Underneath it was
written:

         Paired with a brute like the wolf in the old fable,
         Who on his saviour turned when he was able,
         To cruelty not used, your gentle heart
         Shall, in a twelvemonth only, break apart.
After this was an old temple with a beautiful girl sitting all on her own inside it
reading a Buddhist sutra. The words said:

        When you see through the spring scene’s transient state,
        A nun’s black habit shall replace your own.
        Alas, that daughter of so great a house
        By Buddha’s altar lamp should sleep alone!

Next was an iceberg with a hen phoenix perched on the top of it, and these words:

    This phoenix in a bad time came;
    All praised her great ability.
    ‘Two’ makes my riddle with a man and tree:
    Returning south in tears she met calamity.

Next was a cottage in a deserted village inside which a beautiful girl sat spinning,
followed by these words:

    When power is lost, rank matters not a jot;
    When families fall, kinship must be forgot.
    Through a chance kindness to a country wife
    Deliverance came for your afflicted life.

This was followed by a picture of a vigorously growing orchid in a pot, beside which
stood a lady in full court dress. The words said:

    The plum-tree bore her fruit after the rest,
    Yet, when all’s done, her Orchid was the best.
    Against your ice-pure nature all in vain
    The tongues of envy wagged; you felt no pain.

The picture after that showed an upper room in a tail build?ing in which a beautiful
girl was hanging by her neck from a beam, having apparently taken her own life. The
words said:

    Love was her sea, her sky; in such excess
    Love, meeting with its like, breeds wantonness.
    Say not our troubles all from Rong’s side came;
    For their beginning Ning must take the blame.

Bao-yu would have liked to see some more, but the fairy woman, knowing how
intelligent and sharp-witted he was, began to fear that she was in danger of
becoming responsible for a leakage of celestial secrets, and so, snapping the album
shut, she said with a laugh, ‘Come with me and we will do some more sight-seeing.
Why stay here puzzling your head over these silly riddles?’
Next moment, without quite knowing how it happened, Bao-yu found that he had
left the place of registers behind him and was following Disenchantment through the
rear parts of the palace. Everywhere there were buildings with ornately carved and
painted eaves and rafters, their doorways curtained with strings of pearls and their
interiors draped with em?broidered hangings. The courtyards outside them were full
of deliciously fragrant fairy blooms and rare aromatic herbs.

        Gleam of gold pavement flashed on scarlet doors,
        And in jade walls jewelled casements snow white shone.


‘ Hurry, hurry! Come out and welcome the honoured guest!’ he heard
Disenchantment calling to someone inside, and almost at once a bevy of fairy
maidens came running from the palace, lotus-sleeves fluttering and feather-skirts
billowing, each as enchantingly beautiful as the flowers of spring or the autumn
moon. Seeing Bao-yu, they began to reproach Dis?enchantment angrily.
‘So this is your “honoured guest”! What do you mean by making us hurry out to
meet him? You told us that today at this very hour the dream-soul of our darling
Crimson Pearl was coming to play with us, and we have been waiting I don’t know
how long for her arrival. And now, instead, you have brought this disgusting creature
to pollute our pure, maidenly precincts. What’s the idea ?’
At these words Bao-yu was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of the uncleanness
and impurity of his own body and sought in vain for somewhere to escape to; but
Disenchant?ment held him by the hand and advanced towards the fairy maidens
with a conciliatory smile.
‘Let me tell you the reason for my change of plan. It is true that I set off for the
Rong mansion with the intention of fetch?ing Crimson Pearl, but as I was passing
through the Ning mansion on my way, I happened to run into the Duke of Ning?-guo
and his brother the Duke of Rong-guo and they laid a solemn charge on me which I
found it hard to refuse.
‘“In the hundred years since the foundation of the present dynasty,” they said,
“several generations of our house have distinguished themselves by their services to
the Throne and have covered themselves with riches and honours; but now its stock
of good fortune has run out, and nothing can be done to replenish it. And though our
descendants are many, not one of them is worthy to carry on the line. The only
possible exception, our great-grandson Bao-yu, has inherited a perverse, intractable
nature and is eccentric and emotionally unstable; and although his natural brightness
and intelligence augur well, we fear that owing to the fated eclipse of our family’s
fortunes there will be no one at hand to give the lad proper guidance and to start
him off along the right lines.
‘“May we profit from the fortunate accident of this en?counter, Madam, to entreat
you to take the boy in hand for us? Could you perhaps initiate him in the pleasures of
the flesh and all that sort of thing in such a way as to shock the silli?ness out of him?
In that way he might stand a chance of escaping some of the traps that people fall
into and be able to devote himself single-mindedly to the serious things of life. It
would be such a kindness if you would do this for us.”
‘Hearing the old gentlemen so earnest in their entreaty, I was moved to compassion
and agreed to bring the boy here. I began by letting him have a good look at the
records of the three grades of girls belonging to his own household; but the
experience did not bring any awareness; and so I have brought him to this place for
another attempt. It is my hope that a full exposure to the illusions of feasting,
drinking, music and dancing may succeed in bringing about an awakening in him
some time in the future.’
Having concluded her explanation, she led Bao-yu indoors. At once he became aware
of a faint, subtle scent, the source of which he was quite unable to identify and about
which he felt impelled to question Disenchantment.
‘ How could you possibly know what it was,’ said Dis?enchantment with a
somewhat scornful smile, ‘since this per?fume is not to be found anywhere in your
mortal world? It is made from the essences of rare plants found on famous
mountains and other places of great natural beauty, culled when they are new-grown
and blended with gums from the pearl-laden trees that grow in the jewelled groves
of paradise. It is called “Belles Se Fanent”.’
Bao-yu expressed his admiration.
The company now seated themselves, and some little maids served them with tea.
Bao-yu found its fragrance fresh and clean and its flavour delicious, totally unlike
those of any earthly blend he knew. He asked Disenchantment for the name.
‘The leaves are picked in the Paradise of the Full-blown Flower on the Mountain of
Spring Awakening,’ Disenchant?ment informed him. ‘It is infused in water collected
from the dew that lies on fairy flowers and leaves. The name is “Maiden’s Tears”.’
Bao-yu nodded attentively and commended the tea.
Looking around the room he noticed various musical instruments, antique bronzes,
paintings by old masters, poems by new poets, and other hallmarks of gracious living.
He was particularly delighted to observe some rouge-stained pieces of cotton-wool
lying on the indow-sill—evidently the after?math of some fairy-woman’s toilet. A pair
of calligraphic scrolls hung on the wall, making up the following couplet:
    Earth’s choicest spirits in the dark lie hid:
    Heaven ineluctably enforced their fate.

After reading the scrolls, Bao-yu asked to be introduced to the fairy maidens. They
had a strange assortment of names. One was called Dream-of-bliss, another was
called Loving-heart, a third Ask-for-trouble, a fourth Past-regrets, and the rest all had
names that were equally bizarre.
Presently the little maids came in again and proceeded to arrange some chairs
around a table and to lay it with food and wine for a feast. In the words of the poet,
Celestial nectar filled the crystal cup,
And liquid gold in amber goblets glowed.
The wine’s bouquet was delectable, and once again Bao-yu could not resist asking
about it.
‘This wine,’ said Disenchantment, ‘is made from the petals of hundreds of different
kinds of flowers and extracts from thousands of different sorts of trees. These are
blended and fermented with kylin’s marrow and phoenix milk. Hence its name,
“Lachrymae Rerum”’
Bao-yu praised it enthusiastically.
As they sat drinking wine, a troupe of twelve dancers entered and inquired what
pieces they should perform for the company’s entertainment.
‘You can do the twelve songs of my new song-and-dance suite “A Dream of Golden
Days”,’ said Disenchantment.
At once the sandalwood clappers began, very softly, to beat out a rhythm,
accompanied by the sedate twang of the Zheng’s silver strings and by the voice of a
singer.

    ‘When first the world from chaos rose…’

The singer had got no further than the first line of the first song when
Disenchantment interrupted.
‘This suite,’ she told Bao-yu, ‘is not like the music-dramas of your earthly
composers in which there are always the fixed parts of sheng, dan, jing, mo and so on,
and set tunes in the various Northern and Southern modes. In my suite each song is
an elegy on a single person or event and the tunes are original compositions which
we have orchestrated ourselves. You need to know what the songs are about in order
to appreciate them properly. I should not imagine you are very familiar with this sort
of entertainment; so unless you read the libretto of the songs first before listening to
them, I fear you may find them rather insipid.’
Turning to one of the maids, she ordered her to fetch the manuscript of her libretto
of ‘A Dream of Golden Days’ and gave it to Bao-yu to read, so that he could listen to
the songs with one eye on the text. These were the words in Dis?enchantment’s
manuscript:

    Prelude: A Dream of Go/den Days2

     When first the world from chaos rose,
     Tell me, how did love begin?
     The wind and moonlight first did love compose.
Now woebegone
And quite cast down
In low estate
I would my foolish heart expose,
And so perform
     This Dream of Golden Days,
And all my grief for my lost loves disclose.

First Song: The Mistaken Marriage

Let others all
Commend the marriage rites of gold and jade;
I still recall
The bond of old by stone and flower made;
And while my vacant eyes behold
Crystalline snows of beauty pure and cold,
From my mind can not be banished
That fairy wood forlorn that from the world has vanished.
How true I find
That every good some imperfection bolds!
Even a wife so courteous and so kind
No comfort’ brings to my afflicted mind.

2. See Appedix p.528.
Second Song: Hope Betrayed

One was a flower from paradise,
One a pure jade without spot or stain.
If each for the other one was not intended,
Then why in this life did they meet again?
And yet if fate bad meant them for each other,
Why was their earthly meeting all in vain?
In vain were all her sighs and tears,
In vain were all his anxious fears:
All, insubstantial, doomed to pass,
As moonlight mirrored in the water
Or flowers reflected in a glass.
Row many tears from those poor eyes could flow,
Which every season rained upon her woe?

                       Third Song: Mutability,
In the full flower of her prosperity
Once more came mortal mutability,
Bidding her, with both eyes wide,
All earthly things to cast aside,
And her sweet soul upon the airs to glide.
So far the road back home did seem
     That to her parents in a dream
     Thus she her final duty paid:
     ‘I that now am but a shade,
     Parents dear,
     For your happiness I fear:
    Do not tempt the hand of fate!
    Draw back, draw back, before it is too late!’

  Fourth Song: From Dear Ones Parted

     Sail, boat, a thousand miles through rain and wind,
     Leaving my home and dear ones far behind.
     I fear that my remaining years
     Will waste away in homesick tears.
     Father dear and mother mild,
     Be not troubled for your child!
     From of old our rising, falling
     Was ordained; so now this parting.
       Each in another land must be;
      Each for himself must fend as best he may;
      Now I am gone, oh. do not weep for me!

Fifth Song: Grief Amidst Gladness

While you still in cradle lay,
Both your parents passed away
Though born to silken luxury,
No warmth or kind indulgence came your way.
Yet yours was a generous, open-hearted nature,
And never could be snared or soured
By childish piques and envious passions—
You were a crystal house by wind and moonlight scoured.
Matched to a perfect, gentle husband,
Security of bliss at last it seemed,
And all your childish miseries redeemed.
But soon alas! the clouds of Gao-tang faded,
The waters of the Xiang ran dry.
In our grey world so are things always ordered:
What then avails it to lament and sigh?



Sixth Song: All at Odds

Heaven made you like a flower,
With grace and wit to match the gods,
Adding a strange, contrary nature
That set you with the test at odds.
Nauseous to you the world’s rank diet,
Vulgar its fashion’s gaudy dress:
But the world envies the superior
And hates a too precious daintiness.
Sad it seemed that your life should in dim-lit shrines be wasted,
All the sweets of spring untasted:
Yet, at the last,
Down into mud and shame your hopes were cast,
Like a white, flawless jade dropped in the muck,
Where only wealthy rakes might bless their luck.
Seventh Song: Husband and Enemy

    Zhong-shan wolf,
    Inhuman sot,
    Who for past kindnesses cared not a jot!
    Bully and spendthrift, reckless in debauch,
    For riot or for whoring always hot!
    A delicate young wife of gentle stock
    To you was no more than a lifeless block,
    And bore, when you would rant and rave,
    Treatment fat worse than any slave;
    So that her delicate, sweet soul
    In just a twelvemonth from its body stole.



Eighth Song: The Vanity of Spring

     When triple spring as vanity was seen,
     What use the blushing flowers, the willows green?
     From youth’s extravagance you sought release
     To win chaste quietness and heavenly peace.
     The hymeneal peach-blooms in the sky,
     The flowering almond’s blossoms seen on high
     Dismiss, since none, for sure,
     Can autumn’s blighting frost endure.
     Amidst sad aspens mourners sob and sigh,
     In maple woods the poor ghosts thinly cry,
          And under the dead grasslands lost graves lie.
         Now poor, now rich, men’s lives in toil are passed
         To be, like summer’s pride, cut down at last.
         The doors of life and death all must go through.
         Yet this I know is true:
         In Paradise there grows a precious tree
         Which bears the fruit of immortality.

Ninth Song: Caught By Her Own Cunning
           Too shrewd by half, with such finesse you wrought
           That your own life in your own toils was caught;
           But long before you died your heart was slain,
           And when you died your spirit walked in vain.
    Fall’n the great house once so secure in wealth,
           Each scattered member shifting for himself;
           And half a life-time’s anxious schemes
           Proved no more than the stuff of dreams.
           Like a great building’s tottering crash,
           Like flickering lampwick burned to ash,
           Your scene of happiness concludes in grief:
           For worldly bliss is always insecure and brief.

Tenth Song: The Survivor

            Some good remained,
            Some good remained:
The daughter found a friend in need
            Through her mother’s one good deed.
So let all men the poor and meek sustain,
            And from the example of her cruel kin refrain,
            Who kinship scorned and only thought of gain.
For far above the constellations
            One watches all and makes just calculations.

Eleventh Song: Splendour Come Late

            Favour, a shadow in the glass;
            Fame, a dream that soon would pass:
The blissful flowering-time of youth soon fled,
            Soon, too, the pleasures of the bridal bed.
A pearl-encrusted crown and robes of state
            Could not for death untimely compensate;
And though each man desires
Old age from want made free,
True blessedness requires
A clutch of young heirs at the knee.
Proudly upright
The head with cap and hands of office on,
And gleaming bright
Upon his breast the gold insignia shone.
An awesome sight
To see him so exalted stand! –
Yet the black night
Of death’s dark frontier lay close at hand.
All those whom history calls great
Left only empty names for us to venerate.

Twelfth Song: The Good Things Have An End

Perfumed was the dust that fell
From painted beams where springtime ended.
Her sportive heart
And amorous looks
The ruin of a mighty house portended.
The weakness in the line began with Jing;
The blame for the decline lay first in Ning;
But retribution all was of Love’s fashioning.

Epilogue: The Birds Into The Wood Have Flown

The office jack’s career is blighted,
    The rich man’s fortune now all vanished,
    The kind with life have been requited,
    The cruel exemplarily punished;
    The one who owed a life is dead,
    The tears one owed have all been shed.
    Wrongs suffered have the wrongs done expiated;
    The couplings and the sunderings were fated.
    Untimely death sin in some past life shows,
    But only luck a blest old age bestows.
    The disillusioned to their convents fly,
    The still deluded miserably die.
    Like birds who, having fed, to the woods repair,
    They leave the landscape desolate and bare.
Having reached the end of this suite, the singers showed signs of embarking on
another one. Disenchantment observed with a sigh that Bao-yu was dreadfully
bored.
‘Silly boy! You still don’t understand, do you?,
Bao-yu hurriedly stopped the girls and told them that they need not sing any more.
He felt dizzy and his head was spin?ning. He explained to Disenchantment that he
had drunk too much and would like to lie down.
At once she ordered the remains of the feast to be removed and conducted Bao-yu
to a dainty bedroom. The furnishings and hangings of the bed were more sumptuous
and beautiful than anything he had ever seen. To his intense surprise there was a
fairy girl sitting in the middle of it. Her rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of
Bao-chai, but there was also something about her of Dai-yu’s delicate charm. As he
was pondering the meaning of this apparition, he suddenly became aware that
Disenchantment was addressing him.
‘In the rich and noble households of your mortal world, too many of those bowers
and boudoirs where innocent tenderness and sweet girlish fantasy should reign are
injuriously defiled by coarse young voluptuaries and loose, wanton girls. And what is
even more detestable, there are always any number of worthless philanderers to
protest that it is woman’s beauty alone that inspires them, or loving feelings alone,
unsullied by any taint of lust. They lie in their teeth! To be moved by woman’s beauty
is itself a kind of lust. To experience loving feelings is, even more assuredly, a kind of
lust. Every act of love, every carnal congress of the sexes is brought about precisely
because sensual delight in beauty has kindled the feeling of love.
‘The reason I like you so much is because you are full of lust. You are the most
lustful person I have ever known in the whole world 1’
Bao-yu was scared by the vehemence of her words.
‘Madam Fairy, you are wrong! Because I am lazy over my lessons, Mother and
Father still have to scold me quite often; but surely that doesn’t make me lustful? I’m
still too young to know what they do, the people they use that word about.’
‘Ah, but you are lustful!’ said Disenchantment. ‘In principle, of course, all lust is the
same. But the word has many different meanings. For example, the typically lustful
man in the common sense of the word is a man who likes a pretty face, who is fond
of singing and dancing, who is inordinately given to flirtation; one who makes love in
season and out of season, and who, if he could, would like to have every pretty girl in
the world at his disposal, to gratify his desires whenever he felt like it. Such a person
is a mere brute. His is a shallow, promiscuous kind of lust.
‘But your kind of lust is different. That blind, defenceless love with which nature
has filled your being is what we call here “lust of the mind”. “Lust of the mind”
cannot be ex?plained in words, nor, if it could, would you be able to grasp their
meaning. Either you know what it means or you don’t.
‘Because of this “lust of the mind” women will find you a kind and understanding
friend; but in the eyes of the world I am afraid it is going to make you seem
unpractical and eccentric. It is going to earn you the jeers of many and the angry
looks of many more.
‘Today I received a most touching request on your behalf from your ancestors the
Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo. And as I cannot bear the idea of your
being rejected by the world for the greater glory of us women, I have brought you
here. I have made you drunk with fairy wine. I have drenched you with fairy tea. I
have admonished you with fairy songs. And now I am going to give you my little sister
Two-in-one—”Ke-qing” to her friends—to be your bride.
‘The time is propitious. You may consummate the marriage this very night. My
motive in arranging this is to help you grasp the fact that, ‘since even in these
immortal precincts love is an illusion, the love of your dust-stained, mortal world
must be doubly an illusion. It is my earnest hope that, knowing this, you will
henceforth be able to shake yourself free of its en?tanglements and change your
previous way of thinking, devoting your mind seriously to the teachings of Confucius
and Mencius and your person wholeheartedly to the better?ment of society.’
Disenchantment then proceeded to give him secret instruc?tions in the art of love;
then, pushing him gently inside the room, she closed the door after him and went
away.
Dazed and confused, Bao-yu nevertheless proceeded to follow out the instructions
that Disenchantment had given him, which led him by predictable stages to that act
which boys and girls perform together—and which it is not my inten?tion to give a
full account of here.
Next morning he lay for a long time locked in blissful tenderness with Ke-qing,
murmuring sweet endearments in her ear and unable to tear himself away from her.
Eventually they emerged from the bedroom hand in hand to walk together
out-of-doors.
Their walk seemed to take them quite suddenly to a place where only thorn-trees
grew and wolves and tigers prowled around in pairs. Ahead of them the road ended
at the edge of a dark ravine. No bridge connected it with the other side. As they
hesitated, wondering what to do, they suddenly became aware that Disenchantment
was running up behind them.
‘Stop! Stop!’ she was shouting. ‘Turn back at once! Turn back!’
Bao-yu stood still in alarm and asked her what place this was.
‘This is the Ford of Error,’ said Disenchantment. ‘It is ten thousand fathoms deep
and extends hundreds of miles in either direction. No boat can ever cross it; only a
raft manned by a lay-brother called Numb and an acolyte called Dumb. Numb holds
the steering-paddle and Dumb wields the pole. They won’t ferry anyone across for
money, but only take those who are fated to cross over.
‘If you had gone on walking just now and had fallen in, all the good advice I was at
such pains to give you would have been wasted!’
Even as she spoke there was a rumbling like thunder from inside the abyss and a
multitude of demons and water monsters reached up and clutched at Bao-yu to drag
him down into its depths. In his terror the sweat broke out over his body like rain and
a great cry burst from his lips, ‘Ke-qing! Save me!’
    Aroma and his other maids rushed upstairs in alarm and clung to him.
Don’t be frightened, Bao-yu! We are here!’
But Qin-shi, who was out in the courtyard telling the maids to be sure that the cats
and dogs didn’t fight, marvelled to hear him call her name out in his sleep.
‘“Ke-qing” was the name they called me back at home when I was a little girl.
Nobody here knows it. I wonder how he could have found it out?’
If you have not yet fathomed the answer to her question, you must read the next
chapter.




CHAPTER 6

Jia Bao-yu conducts his first experiment
in the Art of Love
And Grannie Liu makes her first entry into the
Rong-guo mansion
Qin-shi was surprised to hear Bao-yu call out her childhood name in his sleep, but did
not like to pursue the matter. As she stood wondering, Bao-yu, who was still
bemused after his dream and not yet in full possession of his faculties, got out of bed
and began to stretch himself and to adjust his clothes, assisted by Aroma. As she was
doing up his trousers, her hand, chancing to stray over his thigh, came into contact
with some-thing cold and sticky which caused her to draw it back in alarm and ask
him if he was all right. Instead of answering, he merely reddened and gave the hand
a squeeze.
      Aroma had always been an intelligent girl. She was, in any case, a year or two
older than Bao-yu and had recently begun to have some understanding of the facts
of life. Observing the condition that Bao-yu was in, she therefore had more than an
inkling of what had happened. Abandoning her question, she busied herself with his
clothes, her cheeks suffused by a crimson blush of embarrassment. When he was
properly dressed, they went to rejoin Grandmother Jia and the rest. There they
bolted a hurried supper and then slipped back to the other house, where Aroma
profited from the absence of the nurses and the other maids to take out a clean
under?garment for Bao-yu to change into.
      ‘Please, Aroma,’ Bao-yu shamefacedly entreated as she helped him change,
‘please don’t tell anyone !’
Equally ill at ease, Aroma giggled softly.
‘Why did you... ?’ she began to ask. Then, after glancing cautiously around, began
again.
‘Where did that stuff come from?’
     Bao-yu blushed furiously and said nothing. Aroma stared at him curiously and
continued to giggle. After much hesitation he proceeded to give her a detailed
account of his dream. But when he came to the part of it in which he made love to
Two-in-one, Aroma threw herself forward with a shriek of laughter and buried her
face in her hands.
     Bao-yu had long been attracted by Aroma’s somewhat coquettish charms and
tugged at her purposefully, anxious to share with her the lesson he had learned from
Disenchant?ment. Aroma knew that when Grandmother Jia gave her to Bao-yu she
had intended her to belong to him in the fullest possible sense, and so, having no
good reason for refusing him, she allowed him, after a certain amount of coy
resistance, to have his way with her.
    From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before,
whilst Aroma for her part re?doubled the devotion with which she served him. But of
this, for the time being, no more.
*

The inhabitants of the Rong mansion, if we include all of them from the highest to
the humblest in our total, numbered more than three hundred souls, who produced
between them a dozen or more incidents in a single day. Faced with so ex?uberant an
abundance of material, what principle should your chronicler adopt to guide him in
his selection of incidents to record? As we pondered the problem where to begin, it
was suddenly solved for us by the appearance as it were out of nowhere of someone
from a very humble, very insignificant household who, on the strength of a very
tenuous, very remote family connection with the Jias, turned up at the Rong mansion
on the very day of which we are about to write.
     Their name was Wang and they were natives of these parts. A grandfather had
held some very small official post in the capital and had there become acquainted
with Wang Xi-feng’s grandfather, the father of Lady Wang. Conceiving an ad?miration
for the power and prestige of this greater namesake, he had sought to link his family
with the latter’s clan by becoming his adoptive nephew. Only Lady Wang and her
elder brother—Wang Xi-feng’s father—who chanced at that time to be staying with
their parent on his tour of duty at the capital, knew anything about this. The other
members of the clan were unaware that any such relationship existed.
The grandfather had long since died, leaving an only son called Wang Cheng who,
having fallen on hard times, had moved back into the countryside somewhere
outside the capital. Wang Cheng in his turn had died leaving a son called Gou-er, who
had married a girl from a family called Liu and now had two children, a son called
Ban-er and a daughter called Qing-er. The four of them depended on agriculture for
their living, and since, with Gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and his
wife busy about the farm drawing water, pounding grain, and the like, there was no
one to look after Qing-er and her little brother, Gou-er invited his mother-?in-law, old
Grannie Liu, to come and live with them.
This Grannie Liu was an ancient widow-woman, rich in experience of the world, who,
having no son or daughter-in-law to cherish her, eked out her solitary existence by
scratching a livelihood from a miserable half-acre of land. She therefore embraced
her son-in-law’s invitation with alacrity and threw herself enthusiastically into the
business of helping the young couple to make a living.
The season was now at the turn between autumn and winter. The cold weather was
beginning, but none of the preparations for winter had yet been made. By drinking to
allay his anxiety, Gou-er merely put himself more out of temper. He returned home
to vent some of his spleen on his long-suffering wife. Grannie Liu could eventually
stomach no more of his wife-baiting and intervened on her daughter’s behalf.
‘Now look here, son-in-law: probably you will think me an interfering old woman;
but we country folk have to be grate?ful for what is in the pot and cut down our
appetites to the same measure. When you were little your Ma and Pa could afford to
indulge you; so now you’re grown-up you spend all your money as soon as you’ve got
any, without stopping to count the cost; then, when it’s all gone, you start making a
fuss. But what sort of way is that for a grown man to behave?
‘Now where we live may be out in the country, but it’s still “in the Emperor’s
shadow”, as they say. Over there in the city the streets are paved with money just
waiting for someone to go and pick it up. What’s the sense in rampaging around here
at home when you could go out and help your?self?’
‘It’s easy for you to sit on your backside and talk,’ said Gou-er rudely, ‘but what do
you expect me to do? Go out and rob?’
‘No one’s asking you to rob,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But can’t we all sit down peaceably
and think of a way? Because if we don’t, the money isn’t going to come walking in
the door of its own accord.’
Gou-er snorted sarcastically. ‘If there were a way, do you suppose I should have
waited till now before trying it out? There are no tax-collectors in my family and no
mandarins among my friends. What way could there be of laying my hands on some
money? Even if I did have rich friends or relations, I’m not so sure they would want to
be bothered with the likes of us.’
‘I wouldn’t say that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Man proposes, God disposes. It’s up to us to
think of something. We must leave it to the good Lord to decide whether He’ll help
us or not. Who knows, He might give us the opportunity we are looking for.
‘Now I can think of a chance you might try. Your family used to be connected with
the Wang clan of Nanking. Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very
good to you folk. It’s only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to
approach them that they have become more distant with you.
‘I can remember going to their house once with my daughter. The elder Miss Wang
was a very straightforward young lady, very easy to get on with, and not at all high
and mighty. She’s now the wife of the younger of the two Sir Jias in the Rong
mansion. They say that now she’s getting on in years she’s grown even more
charitable and given to good works than she was as a girl. Her brother has been
promoted; but I shouldn’t be surprised if she at least didn’t still remember us. Why
don’t you try your luck with her? You never know, she might do something for you
for the sake of old times. She only has to feel well disposed and a hair off her arm
would be thicker than a man’s waist to poor folks like us’,
     ‘That’s all very well, Mother,’ put in Gou-er’s wife, ‘but just take a look at us!
What sort of state are we in to go calling on great folks like them? I doubt the people
at the door would bother to tell them we were there. Who’s going to all that trouble
just to make a fool of themselves?’
     Gou-er’s cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law,
and his reaction to them was less dis?couraging than his wife’s.
     ‘Well, if it’s as you say, Grannie, and being as you’ve al?ready seen this lady, why
not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?’
     ‘Bless us and save us!’ said Grannie Lin. ‘You know what they say: “A prince’s
door is like the deep sea.” What sort of creature do you take me for? The servants
there don’t know me; it would be a journey wasted.’
     ‘That’s no problem,’ said Gou-er. ‘I’ll tell you what to do. You take young Ban-er
with you and ask for Old Zhou that stayed in service with your lady after she married.
If you tell them you’ve come to see him, it will give you an excuse for the visit Old
Zhou once entrusted a bit of business to my father. He used to be very friendly with
us at one time.’
     ‘I knew all about that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But it’s a long time since you had
anything to do with him and hard to say how he may prove after all these years.
Howsomever. Being a man, you naturally can’t go in your present pickle; and a young
married woman like my daughter can’t go gallivanting around the countryside
showing herself to everybody. But as my old face is tough enough to stand a slap or
two, it’s up to me to go. So be it, then. If any good does come of the visit, we shall all
of us benefit.’
     And so, that very evening, the matter was settled.
     Next day Grannie Liu was up before dawn. As soon as she had washed and done
her hair, she set about teaching Ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great
house—an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough, as would any little boy
of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city. That done, she set
off on her journey, and in due course made her way to Two Dukes Street. There, at
each side of the stone lions which flanked the gates of the Rong Mansion, she saw a
cluster of horses and palanquins. Not daring to go straight up, she first dusted down
her clothes and rehearsed Ban-er’s little repertoire of phrases before sidling up to
one of the side entrances.
A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gate?way sunning their bellies
and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics. Grannie Liu
waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation. After looking her up and
down for a moment or two, they asked her her business. Grannie Liu smiled
ingratiatingly.
     ‘I’ve come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before
she married. Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?’
The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion. After she had
waited there for some considerable time one of them said, ‘If you stand at that gate
along there on the corner, someone from inside the house should be coming out
presently.’
But a more elderly man among them protested that it was ‘a shame to send her on a
fool’s errand’, and turning to Grannie Liu he said, ‘Old Zhou is away in the South at
the moment, but his missus is still at home. She lives round at the back. You’ll have to
go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.’
     Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted off with little Ban-er all the way round to
the rear entrance. There she found a number of sweetmeat vendors and toy-sellers
who had set their wares down outside the gate and were being besieged by a crowd
of some twenty or thirty noisy, yelling children. She grabbed a small urchin from their
midst and drew him towards her.
     ‘Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?’
     The urchin stared back at her impudently.
     ‘Which Mrs Zhou? There are several Mrs Zhous here. What’s her job?’
‘She’s the Mrs Zhou that came here with Her Ladyship when she was married.’
‘That’s easy,’ said the urchin. ‘Follow me!’
He led Grannie Lin into a rear courtyard. ‘That’s where she lives,’ he said, pointing
in the direction of a side wall. Then, bawling over the wall, ‘Mrs Zhou, there’s an
old woman come to see you！’
Zhou Rui’s wife came hurrying out and asked who it was.
‘How are you, my dear?’ said Grannie Liu, advancing with a smile. Zhou Rui’s wife
scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her.
‘Why, it’s Grannie Liu! How are you? It’s so many years since I saw you last, I’d
forgotten all about you! Come in and sit down!’
Grannie Liu followed her cackling.
‘You know what they say: “Important people have short memories.” I wouldn’t
expect you to remember the likes of us!’
When they were indoors, Zhou Rui’s wife ordered her little hired help to pour out
some tea.
‘And hasn’t Ban-er grown a big boy!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife; then, after a few
inquiries about the various things that had happened since they last met, she asked
Grannie Liu about her visit.
‘Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?’
‘Well, of course, first and foremost we came to see you, replied Grannie Liu
mendaciously, ‘but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship. If you
could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that’s not possible, perhaps
we could trouble you just to give her our regards.’
From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui’s wife was already able to make a pretty good
guess as to the real purpose of the old woman’s visit; but because some years
previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er’s father in a dispute
over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Iiu now, when
she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own
importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one.
‘Don’t you worry, Grannie! After you’ve made such a long pilgrimage, we won’t let
you go home without seeing a real Buddha! By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors
has nothing to do with me. You see, we each have our own jobs here. My man’s is
collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn; and when he’s not doing
that, he takes the young masters out when they go on visits. That’s all he ever does.
Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go
out. But being as how you are a relation of Her ladyship, and since you’ve put your
confidence in me and turned to me to help you, I don’t mind breaking the rules for
once and taking in a message.
‘There’s only one thing, though. I don’t expect you know, but things here are very
different from what they were five years ago. Nowadays Her Ladyship doesn’t run
things here any longer. It’s Master Lian’s wife who does all the managing—You’ll
never guess who that is: Her Ladyship’s niece Wang Xi-feng. You know, Her Ladyship’s
eldest brothers daughter, that we used to call “Feng-ge” when she was a child’
‘Bless you, my dear, for being such a help!’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Oh Grannie, how can you say such a thing?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife demurely. ‘You
know what the old saying is, “He who helps others helps himself.” It’s only a question
of saying a few words. No trouble at all.’
So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady
Jia’s quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet. The little maid departed on her
errand and the two women resumed their conversation.
‘This Mrs Lian,’ said Grannie Liu: ‘she can’t be more than eighteen or nineteen
years old. She must be a very capable young woman. Fancy her being able to run a
great household like this!’
‘Oh Grannie, you have no idea!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Mrs Lian may be young, but
when it comes to doing things, she’s got an older head on her shoulders than any I’ve
ever come across. She’s grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian. But sharp!
Well, if it ever comes to a slanging match, she can talk down ten grown men any day
of the week! Wait till you meet her, and you’ll see what I mean. There’s only one
thing, though. She’s a bit too strict with those beneath her.’
As she was speaking, the little maid came back, her errand completed.
‘They’ve finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship’s. Mrs Lian is still there.’
Thou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise.
‘Quick! After she comes out from there she’ll be free for a few minutes while she
has her meal. We must try and catch her then. If we delay a moment longer, people
will start coming in with messages and we shan’t have a chance to speak to her. And
once she goes off for her afternoon nap, we’ve really lost her!’
Grannie Liu got off the kang, adjusted her clothing, con?ducted Ban-er through a
rapid revision of his little stock of phrases and followed Thou Rui’s wife through
various twists and turns to Jia Lian’s quarters. Just before they reached them, Zhou
Rui’s wife planted them both in a covered passage-way while she went on ahead
round the screen wall and into the gate of the courtyard. First ascertaining that Wang
Xi-feng had not yet left Lady Jia’s, she sought out Xi-feng’s chambermaid and
principal confidante, Patience, and primed her with a full account of Grannie Liu’s
antecedents.
‘She has come all this way today to pay her respects,’ she concluded. ‘At one time
Her Ladyship used to see quite a lot of her, which is why I thought it would be in
order for me to bring her in. I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come
back and explain it all to her. I hope she won’t be angry with me for pushing myself
forward.’
Patience at once made up her mind what to do.
‘Let them come in here. They can sit here while they are waiting.’
Zhou Rui’s wife went off again to fetch her charges. As they ascended the steps to the
main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portère
for them to enter. A strange, delicious fragrance seemed to reach forward and enfold
them as they entered, producing in Grannie Liu the momentary sensation that she
had been transported bodily to one of the celestial paradises. Their eyes, too, were
dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room. Temporarily
speechless with wonder, Grannie Liu stood wagging her head, alternating clicks of
admiration with pious ejaculations.
From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in
which Jia Lian’s baby daughter slept. Patience, who was standing by the edge of the
kang, made a rapid assessment of Grannie Liu and judged it sufficient to greet her
with a civil ‘how-do-you-do’ and an invitation to be seated.
Grannie Liu looked at the silks and satins in which Patience was dressed, the gold and
silver ornaments in her hair, her beauty of feature which in every respect
corresponded with what she had been told of Wang Xi-feng, and taking the maid for
the mistress, was on the point of greeting her as ‘Gou-er’s aunt, when Zhou Rui’s wife
introduced her as ‘Miss Patience. Then, when Patience shortly afterwards addressed
Zhou Rui’s wife as ‘Mrs Zhou’, she knew that this was no mistress but a very
high-class maid. So Grannie Liu and Ban-er got up on the kang at one side, while
Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife sat near the edge of it on the other, and a little maid
came in and poured them all some tea.
Grannie Liu’s attention was distracted by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike
the sound made by a flour-bolting machine, and she could not forbear glancing
round her from time to time to see where it came from. Presently she caught sight of
a sort of boxlike object fastened to one of the central pillars of the room, and a thing
like the weight of a steelyard hanging down from it, which swung to and fro in
ceaseless motion and appeared to be the source of the noise which had distracted
her.
‘I wonder what that can be,’ she thought to herself, ‘and what it can be used for?’
As she studied the strange box, it suddenly gave forth a loud dong! like the sound of
a bronze bell or a copper chime, which so startled the old lady that her eyes nearly
popped out of her head. The dong! was followed in rapid succession by eight or nine
others, and Grannie Liu was on the point of asking what it meant, when all the maids
in the house began scurrying about shouting, ‘The mistress! The mistress! She’ll be
coming out now!’ and Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to their feet.
‘Just stay here, Grannie,’ they said. ‘When it is time for you to see her, we shall
come in and fetch you’; and they went off with the other servants to greet their
mistress.
As Grannie Liu sat in silence, waiting with bated breath and head cocked to one side
for her summons, she heard a far-off sound of laughter, followed presently by a
sound of rustling dresses as between ten and twenty women entered the reception
room and passed from it into the room beyond. Then two or three women bearing
large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which
she sat and stood there waiting to be called. A voice in the far room called out, ‘Serve
now, please!’ at which, to judge from the noises, most of the women scuttled off,
leaving only the few who were waiting at table. A long silence ensued in which not so
much as a cheep could be heard; then two women came in bearing a small, low table
which they set down on the kang. It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all
kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched. At
the sight of it Ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and was silenced by Grannie Liu
with a resounding slap.
Just at that moment Zhou Rui’s wife appeared, her face all wreathed in smiles, and
advanced towards Grannie Liu beckoning. Grannie Liu slipped off the kang, lifted
down Ban-er, and exchanged a few hurried whispers with her in the reception room
before waddling into the room beyond.
A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway. Inside, under
the window in the south wall, there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet. At
the east end of the kang, up against the wooden partition wall, were a back?rest and
bolster, both covered in gold brocade, and a large flat cushion for sitting on, also
glittering with gold thread. Beside them stood a silver spittoon.
Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable, which she wore about the house for
warmth, fastened on with a pearl ?studded bandeau. She was dressed in a sprigged
peach-pink gown, with an ermine-lined skirt of dark-red foreign crepe underneath it,
and a cloak of slate-blue silk with woven coloured insets and lining of grey squirrel
around her shoul?ders. Her face was exquisitely made-up. She was sitting on the
edge of the kang, her back straight as a ramrod, with a dimin?utive pair of tongs in
her hand, removing the spent charcoal from a portable hand-warmer. Patience stood
beside her carrying a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray. Xi-feng appeared
not to have noticed her, for she neither reached out for the cup nor raised her head,
but continued picking ab?sorbedly at her hand-warmer. At last she spoke:
‘Why not ask them in, then?’
As she did so, she raised her head and saw Zhou Rui’s wife with her two charges
already standing in front of her. She made a confused movement as if to rise to her
feet, welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence, and almost in
the same breath said rather crossly to Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’
By this time Grannie Liu was already down on her knees and had touched her head
several times to the floor in reverence to her ‘Aunt Feng’.
‘Stop her, Zhou dear!’ said Xi-feng in alarm. ‘She mustn’t do that, I am much too
young! In any case, I don’t know her very well. I don’t know what sort of relations we
are and what I should call her.’
‘This is the Grannie Liu I was just telling you about,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.
Xi-feng nodded, and Grannie Liu sat herself down on the edge of the kang Ban-er at
once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would
induce him to come out and make a bow to his ‘Auntie’.
‘Relations don’t come to see us much nowadays,’ said Xi-feng affably. ‘We’re
getting to be quite strangers with everybody. People who know us realize that it is
because you are tired of us that you don’t visit us oftener; but some spiteful people
who don’t know us so well think it’s our fault, because we have grown too proud.’

Grannie Liu invoked the Lord Buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view.
‘It’s hard times that keeps us away. We can’t afford to visit. We are afraid that if we
came to see you looking the way we are, you would disown us; and even the people
at the gate might think we were tramps!’
‘Now you are really being too hard on us! What if Grand?father did make a little bit
of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment? What does
it all amount to? It’s all empty show, really. You know what they say: “Even the
Emperor has poor relations.” It would be strange indeed if we didn’t have a few!’
She turned to Thou Rui’s wife.
‘Have you told Her Ladyship yet?’
‘No, ma’am. I was waiting for your instructions.’
‘Go and have a look, then. If she has anyone with her, you had better leave it; but if
she is free, tell her about their visit and see what she says.’
Zhou Rui’s wife departed on her errand.
Xi-feng told one of the servants to give Ban-er a handful of sweets, and had just
begun a desultory conversation with Grannie Liu when a number of domestics and
underlings of either sex arrived to report on their duties.
‘I am entertaining a guest,’ said Xi-feng to Patience when she came in to announce
their arrival. ‘Let them leave it until this evening. But if anyone has important
business, bring them in and I will deal with it now.’
Patience went out and returned a minute later to say that she had asked them and
no one had any business of special importance, so she had sent them all away.
Xi-feng nodded.
At this point Zhou Rui’s wife returned with a message for Xi-feng.
‘Her Ladyship says she isn’t free today, but that if you will entertain them for her, it
will be just the same as if she were to receive them herself. She says please thank
them very much for coming. And she says if it’s just an ordinary visit she has nothing
more to add; but if they have anything particular to say, she says tell them that they
can say it to you instead.’
‘I hadn’t anything particular in mind,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Only to look in on Her Ladyship and your mistress. Just a visit to relations.’
‘Well all right then, if you are sure you have nothing to say. But if you have got
anything to say, you really ought to tell the mistress. It will be just the same as if you
were to say it to Her Ladyship.’ Zhou Rui’s wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie
Liu as she said this.
Grannie Liu perfectly well understood the significance of this look, and a blush of
shame overspread her face. Yet if she did not speak up now, what would have been
the purpose of her visit? She forced herself to say something.
‘By rights I ought not to mention it today, seeing that this is our first meeting: but
as I have come such a long way to see you, it seems silly not to speak…’
She had got no further when the pages from the outer gate announced the arrival of
‘the young master from the Ning mansion’ and Xi-feng gestured to her to stop.
‘It’s all right. There is no need to tell me.’ She turned to the pages. ‘Where is Master
Rong, then ?’
A man’s footstep sounded outside and a fresh-faced, willowy youth of seventeen or
eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress came into the room.
Grannie Liu, acutely embarrassed in this male presence, did not know whether to sit
or stand, and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself. Xi-feng laughed
at her discomfiture.
‘Don’t mind him; just stay where you are! It’s only ray nephew.’
With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again, perching herself
obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang.
Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion.
‘My father is entertaining an important visitor tomorrow and he wondered if he
might borrow the little glass screen that your Uncle Wang’s wife gave you, to put on
our kang while he is there. We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.’
‘You are too late,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I lent it yesterday to someone else.
Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang.
‘If you won’t lend it, my father will say that I didn’t ask properly and I shall get a
beating. Come on, Auntie, be a sport! Just for my sake!’
Xi-feng smiled maliciously.
‘I don’t know what’s so special about my family’s things. Heaven knows, you have
enough stuff of your own over there; yet you have only to set eyes on anything of
ours, and you want it for yourselves.’
Jia Rong’s smile flashed again.
‘Please, Auntie! Be merciful!’
‘If it’s the tiniest bit chipped,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll have the hide off you!’
She ordered Patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable
servants to carry it over. Delighted with his good luck, Jia Rong hurriedly forestalled
her.
‘I’ll get some of my own people to carry it. Don’t put yours to a lot of trouble!’ and
he hurried out.
Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the
window, ‘Rong, come back! ‘
Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, ‘Master Rong, you’re wanted
back again!’
Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with
eyebrows arched inquiringly.
Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying
nothing. Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh:
‘It doesn’t matter. Come back again after supper. I’ve got company now, and
besides, I don’t feel in the mood to tell you.’
‘Yes, Aunt,’ said Jia Rong, and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he
sauntered slowly out of the room.
Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again:
‘The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and
Ma haven’t anything in the house to eat, and the weather is getting colder,
and—and—I thought I’d bring him here to see you ...’ She gave Ban-er a despairing
push. ‘What did your Pa tell you to say when we got here? What was it he sent us for?
Look at you! All you can do is sit there eating sweets!’
It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on,
and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile.
‘It’s quite all right. There is no need to tell me. I quite understand.’ She turned to
Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today ?’
‘We were on our way first thing this morning,’ Grannie Liu chimed in. ‘There was no
time to think about eating.’
Xi-feng gave orders for a meal to be brought in, and Zhou Rui’s wife went out and
presently reappeared with a guest’s portion of various choice dishes on a little table,
which she set down in the east wing, and to which she then conducted Grannie Liu
and Ban-er for their meal.
‘Zhou, dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘will you keep them company and see that they have
enough to eat? I shan’t be able to sit with them myself.’ Then calling her aside for a
moment she asked, ‘What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them
just now?’
‘She said they don’t really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan
years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office. She
said they haven’t been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used
to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed. She said it was nice of them to
come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately. And
she said if they appear to want anything, she would leave it to you to decide what we
should do for them.’
‘No wonder!’ exclaimed Xi-feng when she had heard this account. ‘I couldn’t
understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them.’
While they were talking, Grannie Liu came back from the other room having already
finished eating, smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively, and voicing
her thanks for the repast.
‘Sit down,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I have something to say to you. I quite
understand what you were trying to tell me just now. As we are relations, we ought
by rights not to wait for you to come to our door before helping you when you are in
trouble; but there are so many things to attend to in this family, and now that Her
Ladyship is getting on a bit she doesn’t always remember them all. And since I took
over the management of the household, I find there are quite a lot of relations that I
don’t even know about. And then again, of course, though we may look thriving
enough from the out?side, people don’t realize that being a big establishment like
ours carries its own difficulties. They won’t believe it if you tell them, but it’s true.
However, since you have come such a long way, and since this is the first time you
have ever said a word about needing help, we obviously can’t let you go back
empty-handed. Fortunately it so happens that I still haven’t touched any of the
twenty taels of silver that Her Ladyship gave me the other day to make clothes for
the maids with. If you don’t mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.’
When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about ‘difficulties’ she concluded that there was
no hope. Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she
heard that she was, after all, to be given twenty taels of sliver can be imagined.
‘We knew you had your troubles,’ she said, ‘but as the saying goes, “A starved
camel is bigger than a fat horse.” Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is
thicker than a man’s waist to folks like us!’
Horrified by the crudity of these expressions, Zhou Rui’s wife, who was standing by,
was meanwhile signaling fran?tically to the old lady to stop. But Xi-feng laughed
quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string
of cash to go with it. The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu.
‘Here is the twenty taels of silver,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Take this for the time being to make
some winter clothes for the children with. Some time later on, when you have
nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship’s sake. It’s late now, so
I won’t try to keep you. Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered
when you get back!’
She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt ex?pressions of gratitude, picked
up the money and followed Zhou Rui’s wife out of the room.
‘My dear good woman,’ said the latter when they were out of earshot, ‘whatever
came over you? First, when you met her, you couldn’t get a word out; then, when
you did start talking, it was all “your nephew” this and “your nephew” that! I hope
you won’t mind my saying so, but even if the child was a real nephew you would still
need to go a bit easy on the familiarities. Now Master Rong, he is her real nephew.
That’s the sort of person a lady like that calls “nephew”. Where she would come by a
nephew like this one, I just do not know!’
‘My dear,’ replied Grannie Liu with a laugh, ‘when I saw the pretty little darling
sitting there, I took such a liking to her that my heart was too full to speak.’
Back in Zhou Rui’s quarters the two women sat talking for a while. Grannie Liu
wanted to leave a piece of silver to buy something for the Zhou children with, but
Zhou Rui’s wife said she wouldn’t hear of it and refused absolutely to accept anything.
And so, with many expressions of gratitude, the old lady took her leave and set out
once more through the back gate of the mansion.
And if you want to know what happened after she had left, you will have to read the
next chapter.




CHAPTER 7



Zhou Rui’s wife delivers palace flowers and finds Jia
Lian pursuing night sports by day
Jia Bao-yu visits the Ning-guo mansion and has an
agreeable colloquy with Qin-shi’s brother



When Zhou Rui’s wife had finished seeing off Grannie Liu, she went to Lady Wang’s
place to report. Lady Wang, however, was not in her apartment. The maids said that
she had gone off to visit Aunt Xue. Zhou Rui’s wife accordingly went out by the gate
in the east corner of the compound, crossed the eastern courtyard, and made her
way to Pear Tree Court. As she reached the gate of the Court, she came upon Lady
Wang’s maid, Golden, playing on the front steps with a young girl. Golden realized
that Zhou Rui’s wife must have come with a message for Lady Wang and indicated
that her mistress was inside by turning her chin towards the house and shooting out
her lips.
     Zhou Rui’s wife gently raised a side of the portière and entered. She found the
two sisters in the midst of a seemingly interminable discussion of some domestic
odyssey. Not daring to interrupt it, she passed on into the inner room, where Xue
Bao-chai, dressed in workaday clothes, her hair unadorned and twisted in a knot on
top of her head, sat with her maid Oriole over a little table towards the back of the
kang, tracing a pattern for her embroidery. Seeing Zhou Rui’s wife enter, she laid
down her tracing brush, turned towards her with a smile, and invited her to sit with
them.
     ‘How are you, Miss? asked Zhou Rui’s wife, returning her smile and sitting down
on the edge of the kang. ‘I haven’t seen you over our side these last two or three
days. Has Master Bao been upsetting you?’
     ‘Good gracious, no!’ said Bao-chai with a laugh. ‘I’ve had an attack of my old
sickness again and thought I had better rest quietly at home for a day or two. That’s
the only reason.’
     ‘Very sensible!’ said Zhou Ruj’s wife. ‘But what is this sickness of yours, Miss?
Oughtn’t you to call in a doctor and get it properly seen to? It’s no joke when a young
person of your age lets an illness get its grip on them.’
     ‘Oh, don’t talk about my illness I’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t know how many doctors
we must have consulted about it, and how many medicines I must have swallowed,
or how much money we must have spent on it - all without any benefit whatsoever.
In the end we were fortunate enough to hear of a monk who specialized in treating
illnesses that other people couldn’t diagnose and asked him to have a look at me. He
said that I had a congenital tendency to overheatedness, but that fortunately, as my
constitution was a strong one, it wasn’t serious. He said the usual medicines
wouldn’t do it any good, and he gave us a prescription supposed to have been
handed down from the Immortals of the Islands. He also gave us a packet of powder
with a very unusual fragrance which he said was to be used as the base. He said that
if each time I had a turn I took just one of the pills made up from this prescription,
the sickness would go away. And the remarkable thing is that they really have proved
quite effective.’
‘What was this prescription, Miss? If you will tell me, I shall try to remember it so
that I can pass it on to others. If I ever met anyone else who had the same sort of
illness, I could do them a charity, couldn’t I?’
‘You don’t know what you are asking,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s such a finicky prescription,
it would drive anyone mad trying to make it up. It’s not so much the materials. There
is, after all, a limit to the number of drugs from one part of the world or another that
are available. It’s the timing involved that is so difficult.
      ‘You have to take twelve ounces of stamens of the spring-flowering white
tree-peony, twelve ounces of stamens of the summer-flowering white water-lily,
twelve ounces of stamens of the autumn-flowering white lotus, and twelve ounces of
stamens of the winter-flowering white plum and dry them all in the sun on the day of
the spring equinox of the year im?mediately following the year you picked them in.
Then you have to mix them with the powder I told you about and pound them all up
together in a mortar. Then you must take twelve drams of rain water that fell on the
Rain Days in the second month...
Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.
‘Why, that’s already three years it would take! And suppose it didn’t rain that year
on the Rain Days?’
‘Exactly,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Rain is seldom so obliging. You would just have to wait till
the next year. Then you have to collect twelve drams of dew on the day White Dew in
the ninth month, twelve drams of frost at Frost Fall in the tenth, and twelve drams of
snow at Lesser Snow in the last month of the year, stir these four kinds of water into
the mixture, make it up into pills about the size of a longan, and store the pills in an
old porcelain jar. The jar is supposed to be buried in a flower bed and only dug up
when you have an attack of the illness. Then one of the pills is taken out and
swallowed in hot water into which one and a quarter drams of tincture of
phellodendron has been stirred.’
‘God bless my soul!’ Zhou Rui’s wife exclaimed. ‘You would certainly need some
patience! Why, you might wait ten years before getting all those things at the proper
times!’
‘Well,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we were lucky. Within only a year or two of the monk’s visit
we had managed to get all the ingredients together and were able to make up the
pills without trouble. We brought them with us when we came to live here and have
buried them under one of the pear-trees in the garden.’
‘Has this medicine got a name?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked.
‘Yes,’said Bao-chai.‘The monk said the pills are ￡alled“Cold Fragrance Pills”.’
Zhou Rui’s wife nodded appreciatively.
‘Tell me, Miss, what exactly is this illness of yours?’
‘It doesn’t really bother me very much. It makes me cough and wheeze a bit. But as
soon as I have taken one of the pills, it goes away.’
Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask something else when they were interrupted by a
call from Lady Wang:
‘Who have you got in there?’
She hurried back into the outer room to make her report on Grannie Liu. Having
finished it, she waited for some comment from Lady Wang, but finding that none was
forth?coming, was on the point of withdrawing when Aunt Xue smilingly enjoined
her to stay.
‘Just a moment! There is something I should like you to take for me.’
She called to someone outside.
‘Caltrop!’
The rings of the portière rattled and the young girl whom Zhou Rui’s wife had seen a
few minutes before playing on the steps with Golden came into the room.
‘You called, Madam?’
‘Bring me that box with the flowers in!’
Caltrop went into a side room and returned with a small embroidered box.
‘There are twelve artificial flowers in here,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘They were made in the
Imperial Palace, all in the latest fashion. I suddenly thought to myself yesterday what
a pity it was to leave them lying around here doing nothing, and how much nicer it
would be to give them to the girls to wear. I meant to send them round yesterday but
forgot. It’s lucky that you came here today, because you will be able to take them for
me. There are two each for each of the Jia girls. That leaves six. Then two for Miss Lin,
and the remaining four for Mrs Lian.’
‘Keep them for Bao-chai to wear,’ said Lady Wang. ‘What do you want to go
bothering about our girls for?’
‘You don’t know our Bao-chai. She is funny about these things. She has never liked
ornaments or make-up or anything of that sort.’
Zhou Rui’s wife took up the box and went out into the courtyard, where she came
once more upon Golden, sunning herself on the steps.
‘Tell me,’ she asked her, ‘is that little Caltrop the one they are always talking about
who was bought just before they came to the capital? The one they had the murder
trial about?’
‘That’s her,’ said Golden.
At that moment Caltrop herself came skipping up with a sunny smile on her face, and
Zhou Rui’s wife took her by the hand and studied her curiously. Then she turned to
Golden again.
‘You know, there’s something about this child’s face that reminds me of Master
Rong’s wife over at the Ning mansion.’
‘That’s just what I’ve said,’ Golden agreed.
Zhou Rui’s wife asked Caltrop how old she was when she became a slave. Then she
asked her where her parents were, what her age was, and what part of the country
she came from. But to all of these questions Caltrop only shook her head and said
that she didn’t remember.
Zhou Rui’s wife and Golden exchanged glances and sighed sympathetically.
Bearing her box of flowers, Zhou Rui’s wife presently came to the part of the house
behind Lady Wang’s quarters. Grand?mother Jia had recently decided that her
granddaughters were becoming too numerous and declared that she would retain
only Bao-yu and Dai-yu in her own apartments to keep her amused. Ying-chun,
Tan-chun and Xi-chun were to move out into the penthouse behind Lady Wang’s,
with Li Wan to supervise them and keep them company. Thither, accordingly, Zhou
Rui’s wife now directed her steps.
A number of little maids were sitting under the eaves there waiting to be called, and
just as she arrived, Ying-chun’s maid Chess and Tan-chun’s maid Scribe came through
the portière, each carrying a teacup on a tray, from which she deduced that the two
cousins must be inside together.
On entering the room, Zhou’s wife found Ying-chun and Tan-chun sitting by the
window playing Go. She presented the flowers and explained who they were from,
and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks, and gave
orders to the maids to take charge of them.
‘Where is Miss Xi-chun?’ Zhou Rui’s wife inquired.
‘Isn’t she in the next room?’ said the maids; and there in fact she proved to be,
playing with the little nun Sapientia from Water-moon Priory. She asked Zhou Rui’s
wife what she had come for, and when Zhou Rui’s wife took the flowers from the box
and explained, she laughed:
‘I was telling Sapientia that one of these day I am going to have my hair shaved and
go off with her to be a nun, when just at that very moment you came in with these
flowers. What shall I do with flowers when I have no hair to stick them in?’
Further pleasantries followed from the others present.
Xi-chun told one of the maids to take the flowers and look after them.
‘When did you arrive?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked Sapientia. ‘And where’s that precious
Mother Superior of yours gone off to, bald-headed old mischief?’
‘We arrived first thing this morning,’ said Sapientia. ‘Mother Euergesia went off to
visit the Yu mansion after she had seen Her Ladyship. She told me to wait for her
here.’
Have you had this month’s donation yet?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘It was due on the
fifteenth.’
Sapientia said that she didn’t know.
‘Who looks after the monthly donations nowadays?’ asked Xi-chun.
‘Yu Xin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.
‘That explains it. As soon as Mother Euergesia arrived, Yu Xin’s wife was in here like
a shot and they were chattering together for ages. I expect that’s what it was about.’
After gossiping a bit longer with Sapientia, Zhou Rui’s wife made her way to Xi-feng’s
quarters. To get there she had to go down a passage-way between two walls, under
the windows at the back of Li Wan’s apartments, along the foot of an ornamental
wail, and through a gateway in the western cornet of the compound. When she
entered Xi-feng’s reception room, a maid sitting on the threshold of the inner room
hurriedly waved her away and told her to go across to the other side of the house.
Taking the hint, Zhou Rui’s wife tiptoed quietly into the room opposite, where she
found the baby’s nurse patting her rhythmically to make her sleep.
‘Is the mistress taking her afternoon nap?’ she asked the nurse in a low whisper. ‘I
think you’ll have to wake her, even if she is.’
The nurse smiled, grimaced, and shook her head. Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask
her what she meant when she heard a low laugh in what was unmistakably Jia Lian’s
voice from the room opposite. It was followed almost immediately by the sound of
the door opening, and Patience came out carrying a large copper basin which she
asked one of the maids to fetch water in.
‘Ah, Mrs Zhou!’ she said, catching sight of Zhou Rui’s wife and crossing into the
room opposite ‘What brings you back again?’
         Zhou Rui’s wife hastily rose to her feet and picking up the box, proferred it
to Patience and explained her mission. Patience opened the lid, selected four of the
flowers, and slipped away again for several minutes. She came back with two still in
her hand, which she gave to a little page called Sunshine.
‘Take these to Master Rong’s wife over in the Ning mansion and tell her they are for
her to wear,’ she said. Then turning to Zhou Rui’s wife she asked her to convey
Xi-feng’s thanks to the donor.
Zhou Rui’s wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Just as
she was coming out of the covered passage-way, she ran head-on into her daughter,
all dressed up in her best clothes having just arrived on a visit from her
mother-in-law’s.
‘What’s suddenly brought you here at a time like this ?’ she asked her daughter.
‘How have you been keeping, Mother? I’ve been waiting at your place for hours for
you to come back. What’s been keeping you all this time? I got tired of waiting. I
thought I’d go and say “hullo” to Her Old Ladyship, and now I was just on my way to
see Her Ladyship. Have you still not finished then? What’s that you’ve got in your
hand?’
Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.
‘Today is not my lucky day! First of all someone called Grannie Liu turned up, so like
a fool I spend half the day rushing around with her. Then, as if that wasn’t enough,
Her Ladyships sister sees me and gets me delivering flowers to the young ladies. I
haven’t finished yet. Now what have you come here today for? Something’s gone
wrong, I’ll be bound !’
‘I don’t know how you always manage to guess, Mother, but you’re right: it has. I’ll
be honest with you. My man had a cup too much to drink the other day and got into
a fight with someone, and now, out of spite, they are trying to stir up trouble for him.
They say his papers aren’t in order, and they’ve reported him to the yamen and want
to get him deported back South to his old village. So I thought I’d come and ask your
advice, Mother, and see if you couldn’t get someone here to put in a word for him.
Do you think there’s anyone who would be able to help?’
‘I knew it would be something like this,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Well, cheer up, it’s
not so serious as all that! You just go back and wait while I take these flowers to Miss
Lin. You can’t see Her Ladyship now. She and the young mistress are both busy.’
     The daughter obediently turned back to her mother’s quarters. As she went, she
said pleadingly,
     ‘Be as quick as you can, Mother, won’t you?’
     ‘Yes, yes, yes. I’ll be as quick as I can! You young people take everything so
tragically! Lack of experience, that’s what it is!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, and moved on to
Dai-yu’s room.
     Dai-yu was not in her own room, but with Bao-yu, trying to undo metal puzzles.
     ‘Miss Lin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife with a smile, ‘Mrs Xue asked me to give you these
flowers.’
     ‘What flowers ?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let me see!’
     He stretched out his arm, took the box from Zhou Rui’s wife, and looked. Two
artificial flowers, exquisitely fashioned by Palace craftsmen out of silk gauze, lay
inside it. Dai-yu glanced over his arm into the box.
     ‘Am I the only one getting these, or have the others had some too?’
     ‘All the young ladies are getting them,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘These two are for
you, Miss.’
     ‘I thought as much,’ said Dai-yu sneeringly. ‘I get the leavings when everyone
else has had their pick.’
     Zhou Rui’s wife received this sally in silence, not daring to retort.
     ‘What were you doing at my aunt’s place, Zhou?’ Bao-yu asked.
     ‘Her Ladyship was there, and I had something to tell her.
Then while I was over there, Mrs Xue took the opportunity of giving me these flowers
to deliver for her.’
          Was Miss Bao-chai there?’ Bao-yu asked. ‘Why hasn’t she been round these
last few days?’
‘She’s not very well.’
Bao-yu turned to his maids.
‘Which of you will go and see Miss Bao-chai for me? Say that Miss Lin and I send
our regards to her and her mother, and ask her if her illness is any better and what
she’s taking for it. Say that I really ought to go myself, but that as I’ve just got back
from my lessons and have caught a bit of a cold, I shall be coming round another day.’
Snowpink said that she would go, and she and Zhou Rui’s wife left the room together
and went their separate ways.
This son-in-law of Zhou Rui’s who had got himself into trouble was none other than
Jia Yu-cun’s old friend, Leng Zi-xing. He had recently become involved in a lawsuit
arising out of the sale of some antiques, and had asked his wife to get strings pulled
for him at the mansion. Zhou Rui’s wife made light of the affair, confident of her
employers’ power to in?fluence. A word to Xi-feng in the evening, and it would be as
good as settled.



*

At lighting-up time that evening Xi-feng came in partial négligé(having removed her
ornaments for the night) to report on the day’s affairs to Lady Wang.
‘Today I received the things sent us by the Zhen family. The Zhens have their own
boat delivering seasonal produce for the New Year, so I have given their people our
presents to the Zhens to take back on their return journey.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘I’ve got our birthday presents ready for the Earl of Lin?an’s mother,’ continued
Xi-feng. ‘Who would you like us to send with them ?’
‘Just see which women are free and send four of them,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘You
don’t have to ask me about things like that I’
‘Today Cousin Zhen’s wife invited me to spend tomorrow with them at the other
house,’ Xi-feng continued. ‘Is there anything tomorrow that needs doing here ?’
‘Whether there is or not,’ said Lady Wang, ‘I don’t see that it matters. Generally
when she brings an invitation it is for all of us, and you are naturally too busy to go.
This time the invitation is to you personally, which shows that she had deliberately
arranged this in order to give you a rest. The thought is a kind one, and it would be
ungrateful to refuse. I think you ought to go.’
By now Li Wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty, and when
all had wished Lady Wang good night they departed to their different rooms.
Next day, as soon as Xi-feng had completed her toilet, she first reported to Lady
Wang and then went to take her leave of Grandmother Jia. Hearing that she was
going to the other house, Bao-yu said he wanted to go too, and Xi-feng was obliged
to say that she would take him and to stand waiting for him while he changed his
clothes. The two then got into a mule-cart and were soon inside the Ning-guo
mansion, where Cousin Zhen’s wife You-shi, her son Jia Rong, her little
daughter-in-law Qin-shi, and a large number of women attendants and maids were
standing outside the inner gate ready to welcome them.
You-shi’s encounters with Xi-feng were always the oc?casion of good-humoured
banter. Taking Bao-yu by the hand and chatting to Xi-feng, she conducted them both
into the main reception room, where they all sat down and were served tea by
Qin-shi.
‘Well,’ said Xi-feng, ‘what have you asked me here for? Something nice, I hope! If
it’s a present, you’d better bring it now; I’m a busy woman!’
Before You-shi could think of a suitable retort, one of the women attendants replied
for her:
‘You ought not to have come, Mrs Lian! Now that you’re here, we’ve got you in our
power and you’ll have to do what we say for a change!’
At that moment Jia Rong came in and paid his respects to the visitors. Bao-yu asked
what had happened to Cousin Zhen.
‘He’s gone into the country to see Father,’ said You-shi. Then she added, ‘It’s not
much fun for you sitting here. Why don’t you go off and amuse yourself inside?’
‘You’ve chosen a good day to come, Uncle Bao,’ said little Qin-shi. ‘Last time you
were here you wanted to see my brother. Well, today he’s here. He’s sitting in the
study at this very moment. Why don’t you go in and see him?’
Bao-yu was for rushing off straight away. You-shi hurriedly ordered some servants to
go after him in discreet attendance.
‘Well now, just a minute I’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not ask him in here so that I can see
him too?’
‘Oh dear, I don’t think that would do at all!’ said You-shi. ‘Some people’s children
aren’t used to rackety ways like ours. Some people’s children are quiet and refined. If
they were to meet a termagant like you, they might die of laughing.’
‘He’ll be lucky if I don’t laugh at him,’ said Xi-feng cheer-fully. ‘He’d better not try
laughing at me!’
‘He’s very, very shy, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong. We are afraid that if you saw him it might
only irritate you.’
‘Fiddlestick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t care if he’s a three-faced wonder with eight arms,
I still want to see him. Stop fatting about and bring him in, or I’ll box your ears!’
Jia Rong cringed in mock alarm.
‘Yes, Auntie! No need to get so fierce! We’ll bring him in straight away.’
They both laughed, and Jia Rong disappeared for a while and presently came back
leading a youth who, though some?what thinner than Bao-yu, was mote than his
equal in freshness and liveliness of feature, in delicacy of complexion,
hand?someness of figure, and grace of deportment, but whose painful bashfulness
created a somewhat girlish impression. He approached Xi-feng and made his bow
with a shy con?fusion which delighted her.
‘You’ve met your match!’ she said to Bao-yu with a laugh, nudging him playfully.
Then, leaning forward and gripping the boy’s hand in her own, she drew him down
beside her and proceeded in a very deliberate manner to ask him how old he was,
what books he was reading, and various other matters -among them his name, which
was Qin Zhong.
          When the maids and womenfolk in attendance on Xi-feng realized that she
was about to meet Qin Zhong and that they had come without the requisite material
for a First Meeting present, they had sent some of their number back to consult
Patience in the other house. Patience had, at her own dis?cretion, selected a suitable
length of material and two little ‘Top of the List’ solid gold medallions to give the
mes?sengers. These gifts now arrived for Xi-feng (who thought them somewhat on
the meagre side) to give to Qin Zhong. When he and his sister had formally thanked
her, the company sat down to lunch, after which You-shi, Xi-feng and Qin?-shi settled
down to a game of cards, while Bao-yu and Qin Zhong left the table to converse
elsewhere.
When Bao-yu first set eyes on Qin Zhong it had been as though part of his soul had
left him. For a while he stared blankly, oblivious to all around him, while a stream of
idle fancies passed through his mind.
‘How perfect he is! Who would have believed there could be such perfection? Now
that I have seen him I know that I am just a pig wallowing in the mud, a mangy dog!
Why, why did I have to be born in this pretentious aristocratic household? Why
couldn’t I have been born in the family of some poor scholar or low-grade clerk?
Then I could have been neat him and got to know him, and my life would have been
worth living. Though I am so much richer and more nobly born than he, what use are
my fine clothes but to covet up the dead and rotten wood beneath? What use the
luxuries I eat and drink but to fill the cesspit and swell the stinking sewer of my inside?
O rank and riches! How you poison everything!’
At the same time, Qin Zhong, struck by Bao-yu’s rare good looks and princely bearing
and— even more perhaps—by the golden coronet and embroidered clothing and the
train of pretty maids and handsome pages who attended him, was thinking:
‘No wonder my sister raves about him whenever his name is mentioned! Why did I
have to be born in a poor respectable family? How I should have liked to get to know
him: to have shared moments of warmth and affection with him! But it was not to
be!’
Each, plunged in reverie, for a while said nothing. Then Bao-yu asked Qin Zhong
about his reading, and Qin Zbong replied—a full, frank reply, without the trappings of
polite?ness: and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and
were already like old friends.
After a while tea and various confections were brought in.
‘We two shan’t be drinking any wine,’ Bao-yu said to the ladies. ‘May we have a
plate or two of these things set out on the little kang in the other room? We can talk
in there without disturbing you,’
The two boys moved into the inner room for their tea.
          In between plying Xi-feng with wine and delicacies, Qin?shi slipped in for a
word with Bao-yu.
‘My brother’s quite young, Uncle Bao. Please, for my sake, don’t mind him if he
does anything to offend you! He may be shy, but he’s got quite a nasty temper. He’s
not really easy to get on with at all.
          ‘You go along I’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘We shall be all right!’
          After a few admonitory words to her brother, Qin-shi went back to look
after Xi-feng.
          Some minutes later Xi-feng and You- shi sent a servant in to inquire whether
the boys would like anything else to eat, adding that they had only to ask if they
wanted anything. Bao-yu promised that they would; but his mind was not on eating
and drinking, and he continued to question Qin Zhong about his life at home.
‘My private tutor resigned last year,’ Qin Zhong told him. ‘Father is quite old, and as
his health is not very good and his job keeps him terribly busy, he hasn’t been able to
do any?thing yet about getting me another one. At the moment I am lust going over
old lessons on my own at home. The trouble is, though, that if you want to get on in
a subject, you really need one or two like-minded people to study with you, so that
every so often you can all discuss what you have been reading...’
          ‘Exactly!’ Bao-yu put in eagerly, not waiting for him to finish. ‘We have a
private school in our family to which any members of the clan who can’t manage
private tuition may send their children, and boys from related families who aren’t in
the clan can also be admitted. I have been at a loose end ever since my tutor went
home on leave, and Father would have liked me to go to this school for revision until
he gets back next year and I can be taught privately again. But Grandmother said that
with so many boys in the school I should be sure to get up to mischief, and it would
do me more harm than good. She also said I couldn’t in any case go then, because I’d
only just recovered after several days in bed. And so it got put off.
‘From what you say, your father is worried about the same problem as mine; so
why not tell him about this school when you get back today and ask him if you can
join? I should be there to keep you company, and we could both help each other. I
think it would be a marvellous idea.’
‘The other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up, Father mentioned
this school of yours as a possible alternative,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘He was going to come
over and have a word with my sister’s father-in-law about it and get him to
recommend me; but they were busy here at the time and it didn’t seem the right
moment to bother them with a little thing like this. However, if you are really of the
opinion that I could be of some service to you, even if it’s only grinding your ink or
cleaning your ink-stone, do please arrange it as soon as you can, before we both get
too rusty! We should be relieving our parents of an anxiety and having the pleasure
of each other’s company at one and the same time; so it would be a good
arrangement from every point of view.’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll tell Cousin Lian’s wife presently, when we join the
others. Then when we get back home tonight, you must tell your father and I shall
tell my grandmother. There’s no reason that I can see why this shouldn’t be settled
immediately.’
They had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk, and now moved back into the
lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while. When the latter
had finished and had added up their scores, it appeared that Qin-shi and You-shi had
lost to Xi-feng and owed her a dramatic enter?tainment at which the players and the
drinks were to be provided at their expense. In the course of dinner, which was now
served and at which they were joined by the two boys, it was decided that this
should take place in two days’ time.
As it was now quite dark, You-shi gave her women orders to see that two
menservants were detailed to attend Qin Zhong on his way back home. The women
were gone on their errand an unusually long time and eventually Qin Zhong rose to
take his leave.
‘Who has been chosen to go with him?’ You-shi asked.
‘They have asked Big Jiao,’ said the women, ‘but it seems that he is terribly drunk
and swearing at everybody.’
You-shi and Qin-shi were indignant.
‘Whatever did they want to go and ask him for? Any of the younger ones would
have done. What was the point of provoking him?’
‘I always said you were too soft with people,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You really mustn’t let
servants get away with it like this. I never heard of such a thing !’
‘You don’t know Big Jiao,’ said You-shi. ‘Even Father couldn’t do anything with him,
let alone Zhen. When he was young he went with Grandfather on three or four of his
campaigns and once saved his life by pulling him from under a heap of corpses and
carrying him to safety on his back. He went hungry himself and stole things for his
master to eat; and once when he had managed to get half a cupful of water, he gave
it to his master and drank horse’s urine himself. Because of these one or two acts of
heroism he was always given special treatment during Grandfather’s lifetime; so
naturally we don’t like to upset him now. But since he’s grown old he has let himself
go completely. He drinks all the time, and when he’s drunk he starts abusing
everybody—literally everybody. I’ve repeatedly told the steward not to give him jobs
to do—to behave exactly as though he were dead and ignore him completely. Why
on earth should he have chosen him today?’
     ‘I know this Big Jiao all right,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and I still say that you are too weak.
You ought to send him away. Right away. Send him to live on one of your farms: that
would put a stop to his nonsense!’ She turned to the women and asked if her own
carriage was ready yet. The women replied that it was waiting, and she rose to take
her leave and, taking Bao-yu by the hand, went out on to the steps, attended by
You-shi and the rest.
     In the flickering light of many lanterns the pages stood stiffly to attention on the
pavement below, while Big Jiao, encouraged by Cousin Zhen’s absence to indulge his
talent for drunken abuse, was getting to work on the Chief Steward, Lai Sheng,
accusing him of being unfair, of always dropping on the weakest, and so on and so
forth.
     ‘If there’s a cushy job going you give it to someone else, but when it’s a question
of seeing someone home in pitch bloody darkness, you pick on me. Mean, rotten
bugger! Call yourself a steward? Some steward! Don’t you know who Old Jiao is? I
can lift my foot up higher than your head! Twenty years ago I didn’t give a damn for
anybody, never mind a pack of little misbegotten abortions like you!’
     He was just getting into his stride when Jia Rong came out to see Xi-feng off in
her carriage. The servants shouted to Big Jiao to stop, but without success. Impatient
of the old man’s insolence, Jia Rong cursed him angrily.
     ‘Tie him up,’ he said to the servants. ‘We shall see if he is still so eager for death
tomorrow morning, when he has sobered up a bit.’
     But Big Jiao was not to be intimidated by such as Jia Rong. On the contrary, he
staggered up to him and bel?lowed even louder.
     ‘Oh ho! Little Rong, is it? Don’t you come the Big Master stuff with me, sonny
boy! Never mind a little bit of a kid like you, even your daddy and your granddaddy
don’t dare to try any funny stuff with Old Jiao. If it wasn’t for Old Jiao, where would
you lot all be today, with your rank and your fancy titles and your money and all the
other things you enjoy? It was your great-granddad, whose life I saved when he was
given up for dead, that won all this for you, by the sweat of his brow. And what
reward do I get for saving him? Nothing. Instead you come to me and you put on
your Big Master act. Well, I’ll tell you something. You’d better watch out. Because if
you don’t, you’re going to get a shiny white knife inside you, and it’s going to come
out red!’
     ‘You’d better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business,’
said Xi-feng to Jia Rong from her carriage. ‘It’s positively dangerous to keep a man
like this on the premises. If any of our acquaintance get to know that a family like
ours can’t keep even a semblance of discipline about the place, we shall become a
laughing-stock.’
Jia Rong assented meekly.
     Several of the servants, seeing that Big Jiao had got quite out of hand and that
something had to be done at all costs, rushed up and overpowered him, and
throwing him face downward on the ground, frog-marched him off to the stables. By
now even Cousin Zhen was being included in his mal?edictions, which became wilder
and noisier as he shouted to his captors that he wanted to go to the ancestral temple
and weep before the tablet of his old Master.
    ‘Who would ever have believed the Old Master could spawn this filthy lot of
animals?’ he bawled. ‘Up to their dirty little tricks every day. I know. Father-in-law
pokes in the ashes. Auntie has it off with nevvy. Do you think I don’t know what
you’re all up to? Oh, we “hide our broken arm in our sleeve”; but you don’t fool me.’
    Terrified out of their wits at hearing a fellow-servant utter such enormities, the
grooms and pages tied him up and stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung.
    Big Jiao’s last words had been clearly audible to Xi-feng and Jia Rong, though
they were a considerable distance away, but they both pretended not to have heard.
Bao-yu, sitting in the carriage with Xi-feng, was less inhibited.
    ‘Feng, what did he mean when he said “Father-in-law pokes in the ashes”?’
     ‘Hold your tongue!’ Xi-feng snapped back at him, livid. ‘It’s bad enough for a
person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth, but to go asking
questions about it, really! Just wait till I tell your mother! You’re going to get the
biggest hiding you’ve ever had in your life!’
     Terrified by her vehemence, Bao-yu implored forgiveness. ‘Please, Feng, don’t
tell her! I promise never to say those words again.’
     Xi-feng’s manner at once became soothing and indulgent.
     ‘That’s my good little cuzzy! When we get back I must tell Grandma to make
them explain to the school about Qin Zhong and arrange for him to be admitted
soon.’
     As they talked, the carriage bore them back into Rong-guo House. But what
happened there will be told in the chapter which follows.
CHAPTER 8



Jia Bao-yu is allowed to see the strangely
corresponding golden locket
And Xue Bao-chai has a predestined encounter
with the Magic Jade



When Bao-yu and Xi-feng were back and had seen the others, Bao-yu told
Grandmother Jia of his wish to have Qin Zhong admitted to the clan school. He
pointed out that a congenial study-companion would stimulate him to greater effort
and gave her a glowing account of Qin Zhong’s amiable qualities. Xi-feng was at hand
to lend her support. She told Grandmother Jia that Qin Zhong would be calling on her
within a day or two to pay his respects. Their infectious enthusiasm put the old lady
in a high good humour, which Xi-feng took ad?vantage of to ask if she would
accompany her to the dramatic entertainment which her opponents had promised in
two days’ time.
     In spite of her years Grandmother Jia loved any kind of excitement and when,
two days later, You-shi came to fetch Xi-feng, the old lady did in fact accompany them,
taking Lady Wang, Dai-yu and Bao-yu as well. By about noon, however, she was ready
to go back and rest, and Lady Wang, who disliked noise and excitement, took the
opportunity to leave with her. This left Xi-feng as principal guest, and she moved into
the place of honour and stayed there for the rest of the day, enjoying herself
immensely and not returning until late in the evening.
     After accompanying Grandmother Jia back to her apartment and seeing her
safely settled down for her nap, Bao-yu would have liked to go back and watch some
more plays but was afraid that his presence would be an inconvenience to Qin?shi
and his other ‘juniors’. Remembering that Bao-chai had been at home unwell during
the past few days and that he had still not been to see her, he thought he would go
there instead and pay her a call, but fearing that if he went the quickest way through
the corner gate behind the main hall he might meet with some entanglement on the
way or, worse, run into his father, he decided to go by a more circuitous route.
The maids and nurses who attended him had been expecting him to change into his
everyday clothes, but seeing him go out of the inner gate again without doing so,
followed after him, assuming that he was going back to the other mansion to watch
the plays. To their surprise, however, he turned left when he reached the covered
passage-way instead of going straight on, and made off in a north-easterly direction.
But he was out of luck, for as he did so he found himself facing Zhan Guang and Shan
Ping-ren, two of the literary gentlemen patronized by his father, who were walking
towards him from the opposite direction. They descended on him gleefully, one of
them clasping him round the waist, the other taking him by a hand.
‘Angelic boy! How seldom one has the pleasure! Is it really you, or is this some
delightful dream?’
They prattled on for what seemed an age before finally releasing him. As they were
going, one of the old nurses detained them a moment longer.
‘Have you two gentlemen just come from the Master’s?’
The two gentlemen nodded and smiled conspiratorially:
‘Sir Zheng is in his little study in the Su Dong-po Rooms, having his afternoon nap.
All is well!’
They hurried off. Bao-yu smiled too, relieved that his father was safely out of the way.
Turning once again, this time north-wards, he made his way swiftly towards Pear Tree
Court.
Once more he was unlucky. The Clerk of Stores Wu Xindeng, a man called Dai Liang
who was foreman at the granary, and five other foremen were just at that moment
coming out of the counting-house together and, catching sight of Bao-yu, at once
stood respectfully to attention. One of their number, a buyer called Qian Hua who
had not seen Bao-yu for some considerable time, hurried forward, dropped on his
right knee, and touched his hand to the ground in the Manchu salute. Bao-yu
smilingly extended a hand to raise him up. The men all relaxed in smiles.
‘I saw some of your calligraphy in town the other day, Master Bao,’ said one of
them. ‘It’s getting really good! When are you going to give us a few sheets for
ourselves, to put up on the wall?’
‘Where did you see it?’ Bao-yu asked.
‘Any number of places,’ the men told him. ‘Everyone has been praising it no end.
They even come to us asking for specimens.’
‘You can have some easily enough if you really want to,’ Bao-yu said. ‘You have only
to ask one of my boys.’
He hurried on. The men waited for him to pass before dispersing about their
business.
To omit further details of his progress, Bao-yu came at last to Pear Tree Court, and
going first into Aunt Xue’s room, found her giving instructions to her maids about
some em?broidery. Her response to his greeting was to draw him towards her and
clasp him to her bosom in an affectionate embrace.
‘What a nice, kind boy to think of us on a cold day like this! Come up on the kang
and get warm!’
She ordered a maid to bring him some ‘boiling hot tea’.
Bao-yu inquired whether Cousin Pan was at home. Aunt Xue sighed.
‘Pan is like a riderless horse: always off enjoying himself somewhere or other. He
won’t spend a single day at home if he can help it.’
‘What about Bao-chai? Is she quite better?’
‘Ah yes, of course!’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You sent someone to ask about her the other
day, didn’t you? That was very thoughtful of you. I think she’s inside. Go in and have
a look! It’s warmer in there than here. You go in and sit down, and I’ll be with you in
a moment when I’ve finished tidying up.’
Bao-yu got down from the kang and going to the doorway of the inner room, lifted
up the rather worn-looking red silk curtain which covered it. Bao-chai was sitting on
the kang inside, sewing. Her lustrous black hair was done up in a simple bun without
any kind of ornament. She was wearing a honey-coloured padded gown, a
mulberry-coloured sleeveless jacket with a pattern in gold and silver thread, and a
greenish-yellow padded skirt. All her clothing had the same sensible, rather
well-worn look about it.
    He saw no hint of luxury or show,
    only a chaste, refined sobriety;
       to some her studied taciturnity
       might seem to savour of duplicity;
but she herself saw in conformity
       the means of guarding her simplicity.
‘Have you quite recovered, cousin?’ Bao-yu asked.
Raising her head, Bao-chai saw Bao-yu enter the room. She rose quickly to her feet
and smiled at him.
‘I am quite better now. It was nice of you to think of me.’ She made him sit on the
edge of the kang and ordered Oriole to pour him some tea. Then she proceeded to
ask him first about Grandmother Jia, then about Lady Wang and then about the girls,
while her eye took in the details of his dress.
He had a little jewel-encrusted coronet of gold filigree on the top of his head and a
circlet in the form of two dragons supporting a pearl round his brow. He was dressed
in a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of russet-green material covered with a pattern
of writhing dragons and lined and trimmed with white fox-fur. A
butterfly-embroidered sash with fringed ends was fastened round his waist, and from
his neck hung a padlock-shaped amulet, a lucky charm, and the famous jade said to
have been inside his mouth when he was born.
Bao-chai’s eye came to rest on the jade.
‘I am always hearing about this famous stone of yours,’ she said smilingly, ‘but I
have never yet had a chance of examining it really closely. Today I think I should like
to have a look.’
She moved forward as she spoke, and Bao-yu too leaned towards her, and taking the
stone from his neck, put it into her hand.
Looking at it as it lay on her palm, she saw a stone about the size of a sparrow’s egg,
glowing with the suppressed, milky radiance of a sunlit cloud and veined with
iridescent streaks of colour.
Reader, you will, of course, remember that this jade was a transformation of that
same great stone block which once lay at the foot of Greensickness Peak in the Great
Fable Mountains. A certain jesting poet has written these verses about it:

Nü-wa’s stone-smelting is a tale unfounded:
On such weak fancies our Great Fable’s grounded.
Lost now, alack! and gone my heavenly stone—
Transformed to this vile bag of flesh and bone.
For, in misfortune, gold no longer gleams;
And bright jade, when fate frowns, lack-lustre seems.
Heaped charnel-bones none can identify
Were golden girls and boys in days gone by.

The words which the scabby-headed monk had incised on the stone when he found it
lying in its diminished shape under Greensickness Peak were as follows.

(On the front side)

MAGIC JADE

Mislay me not, forget me not,
And hale old age shall be your lot.

(On the reverse side)
1.Dispels the harms of witchcraft.
2.Cures melancholic distempers.
3.Foretells good and evil fortune.

    When Bao-chai had looked at the stone all over, she turned back to the
inscription on the front and repeated it a couple of times to herself out loud:


‘Mislay me not, forget me not,
And hale old age shall be your lot.’

    ‘Why aren’t you pouring the tea?’ she asked Oriole. ‘What are you standing
there gawping for?’
Oriole laughed.
‘Because those words sounded like a perfect match to the ones on your necklace.’
‘So you have an inscription, too?’ said Bao-yu pricking up his ears. ‘I must have a
look.
‘Don’t take any notice of her!’ said Bao-chai. ‘There is no inscription.’
‘Cousin, cousin,’ said Bao-yu entreatingly, ‘you’ve had a look at mine. Be fair!’
Bao-chai could not escape the logic of this entreaty.
‘There is a motto on it which someone gave us once for luck and which we had
engraved on it,’ she admitted. ‘That’s the only reason I always wear it; otherwise it
would be too tiresome to have a heavy thing like this hanging round one’s neck all
the time.’
As she was speaking she undid the top buttons of her jacket and gown and extracted
the necklace that she was wearing over the dark red shift beneath. Its pendant was a
locket of shining solid gold, bordered with sparkling gems. There was a line of writing
engraved on either side of it which together made up the words of a charm:

Ne’er leave me, ne’er abandon me:
And years of health shall be your fee.

He recited them a couple of times and then recited the word:
of his own Inscription a couple of times.
‘Why, yes!’ he cried delightedly. ‘The two inscriptions are a perfect match!’
‘A scabby-headed old monk gave Miss Bao-chai the words,’ said Oriole. ‘He said
they must be engraved on something made of gold...’
Bao-chai angrily cut her short, telling her to mind her busi?ness and pour the tea. To
change the subject she asked Bao-yu where he had just come from.
Bao-yu was now sitting almost shoulder to shoulder with her and as he did so
became aware of a penetrating fragrance that seemed to emanate from her person.
‘What incense do you use to scent your clothes with, cousin?’ he asked. ‘I have
never smelt such a delicious perfume.’
‘I can’t stand incense perfumes,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I could never see the point of
smoking perfectly good, clean clothes over an incense-pot.’
‘In that case, what is this perfume I can smell?’
Bao-chai thought for a moment.
‘I know! It must be the Cold Fragrance Pill I took this morning.’
‘What’s a Cold Fragrance Pill ?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘Won’t you give me one to
try?’
‘ Now you’re being silly again. Medicine isn’t something to be taken for
amusement.’
Just at that moment the servants outside announced ‘Miss Lin’ and almost
simultaneously Dai-yu came flouncing into the room. Catching sight of Bao-yu she let
out a wail of mock dismay.
‘Oh dear! I have chosen a bad time to come!’
The others rose and invited her to be seated.
‘Why did you say that?’ Bao-chai asked her.
‘If I had known he was coming, I shouldn’t have come myself.’
‘What exactly do you mean by that?’
‘What do I mean by that ?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I mean that if I only come when he does,
then when I don’t come you won’t have any visitors. Whereas if we space ourselves
out so that he comes one day and I come the next, it will never get either too lonely
or too noisy for you. I shouldn’t have thought that needed much explaining.’
Observing that Dai-yu was wearing a greatcoat of red camlet over her dress, Bao-yu
asked whether it was snowing outside.
‘It’s been snowing for some time,’ said one of the old women standing below the
kang.
Bao-yu asked someone to go and fetch his winter cape.
‘You see!’ said Dai-yu. ‘When I come, he has to go!’
‘Who said anything about going?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just want them to have it ready for
me.’
‘It’s no time to go now, while it’s still snowing,’ said Bao-?yu’s old nurse, Nannie Li.
‘Much better stay here and play with your cousins. In any case, I think your Aunt Xue
is getting tea ready for you. I’ll send a maid to fetch your cape. Shall I tell the boys
outside they can go?’
Bao-yu nodded, and Nannie Li went outside and dismissed the pages.
By now Aunt Xue had finished laying tea, which included a number of
delicious-looking things to eat, and invited the cousins to partake. While they were
doing so, Bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by
his Cousin Zhen’s wife that he had eaten at the Ning mansion only two days
previously. Aunt Xue at once hurried out and fetched some of her own for him to try.
‘This really needs to be eaten with wine,’ said Bao-yu.
Aunt Xue gave orders for some of the best wine to be decanted; but Nannie Li
disapproved.
‘He shouldn’t have wine, Mrs Xue.’
‘Oh go on, Nannie I’ Bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly. ‘I shall only drink one cup.’
‘It’s no good!’ said Nannie Li. ‘I don’t mind if you drink a hogshead as long as your
grandmother or your mother is there. But look at the trouble I got into the other day
just because when I had my back turned for a moment some wretched person who
ought to have known better gave you a sip or two to humour you! I didn’t hear the
end of it for days after.
‘You don’t know how wild he can be, Mrs Xue,’ she continued. ‘And he gets even
worse when he’s had something to drink. With Her Old Ladyship you can never tell.
One day when she’s feeling high-spirited she’ll let him drink as much as he likes;
other days she won’t let him touch a drop. But come what may, I’m always the one
that gets into trouble.’
‘Poor old thing!’ said Aunt Xue with a laugh. ‘Have a drink yourself and stop
worrying! I’ll see that he doesn’t drink too much. And if Lady Jia does say anything, I
shall take full responsibility? She turned to one of the maids: ‘Come on’ now! Pour
Nannie a nice warm cup of wine to keep the cold out!’
Nannie Li could scarcely sustain her objection after this and went off with the other
servants to have her drink.
‘Don’t bother to heat the wine for me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I prefer it cold.
‘Good gracious, that will never do! ‘said Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t drink wine cold, or
when you write your hand will shake!’
‘I’m surprised at you, Cousin Bao!’ said Bao-chai with a smile. ‘With all your
enthusiasm for out-of-the-way learning, fancy not knowing a thing like that! Wine
has an exceptionally fiery nature, and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be
quickly digested. If it is drunk cold, it congeals inside the body and harms it by
absorbing heat from the internal organs. From this day on you must reform! No more
cold wine!’
Dai-yu, who sat cracking melon-seeds between her teeth throughout this homily,
smiled ironically. Just at that moment her maid Snowgoose came hurrying in with a
little hand-warmer for her.
‘Who told you to bring this?’ Dai-yu asked her. ‘Very kind of them, I am sure. But I
was not actually freezing to death here.’
‘Nightingale told me to bring it, Miss. She was afraid you might be cold.’
‘I am glad you are so ready to obey her. Generally when 1 tell you to do anything it
goes in one ear and out the other; yet anything she tells you to do is followed out
more promptly than an Imperial Edict!’
Bao-yu knew perfectly well that these words were really intended for him, but made
no reply, beyond laughing good-?humouredly. Bao-chai, long accustomed to Dai-yu’s
peculiar ways, also ignored them. But Aunt Xue protested.
‘You’ve always been rather delicate and you’ve always felt the cold badly. Surely it
was nice of them to think of you?’
‘You don’t understand, Aunt,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t matter here, with you; but
some people might be deeply offended at the sight of one of my maids rushing in
with a hand-warmer. It’s as though I thought my hosts couldn’t supply one
themselves if I needed it. Instead of saying how thoughtful the maid was, they would
put it down to my arrogance and lack of breeding.’
‘You are altogether too sensitive, thinking of things like that,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Such a
thought would never have crossed my mind!’
Bao-yu had soon finished his third cup of wine and Nannie Li once more came
forward to restrain him. But Bao-yu, who was now warm and happy and in the midst
of a hilarious conversation with his cousins, was naturally unwilling to stop, and
pleaded humbly with the old lady for a reprieve.
‘Nannie darling, just two more cups and then I’ll stop!’
‘You’d better look out,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Your father’s at home today. He’ll be asking
you about your lessons before you know where you are.’
At these words all Bao-yu’s happiness drained away. Slowly he set down his cup and
bowed his head in dejection.
‘Don’t spoil everyone’s enjoyment,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Even if Uncle does call for you, you
can always say that Aunt Xue is keeping you. I think that old Nannie of yours has had
a cup too many and is looking for a bit of excitement at our expense. She gave him a
gentle nudge to encourage a more valiant spirit in him, muttering, as she did so,
‘Take no notice of the old fool! Let’s go on enjoying ourselves and not mind about
her!’
Nannie Li knew only too well what Dai-yu was capable of.
‘Now Miss Lin,’ she said, ‘don’t you go taking his part! If you encourage him he’s
only too likely to do what you say!’
Dai-yu smiled dangerously. ‘Take his part? Why should I want to encourage him? You
are over-cautious, my dear Nannie. After all, Lady Jia often lets him drink; why should
it matter if Mrs Xue lets him have a cup or two? I suppose you think he can’t be
trusted to drink here because Mrs Xue is not one of us?’
Nannie Li did not know whether to feel upset or amused. ‘Really, Miss Lin. Some of
the things you say cut sharper than a knife!’
Bao-chai could not suppress a giggle. She pinched Dai-yu’s cheek playfully.
‘Really, Miss Frowner, the things you say! One doesn’t know whether to grind one’s
teeth or laugh!’
Aunt Xue laughed too.
‘Don’t be afraid, my boy! Heaven knows I’ve got little enough to offer you when
you come to see me. You mustn’t get upset over a small thing like this, or I shall feel
quite uncomfortable. Drink as much as you like; I’ll look after you! You may as well
stay to supper, in any case; and even if you do get drunk, you can always spend the
night here.’ She told a maid to heat some more wine. ‘There! Auntie will drink a cup
or two with you, and then we shall have some supper.’
Bao-yu’s spirits began to revive a bit under his aunt’s encouragement.
‘Keep an eye on him,’ said Nannie Li to the maids. ‘I’m lust going back for a few
minutes to change my clothes.’ Then aside to Aunt Xue she said, ‘Don’t let him drink
too much, Mrs Xue!’ and went off home.
Although two or three old women still remained after her departure, none felt very
much concern for Bao-yu, and as soon as Nannie Li was out of the way they quietiy
slipped off about their own concerns, leaving, of the attendants who had come with
him, only two small maids, whose only anxiety was to please their young master by
indulging him as much as possible.
Fortunately Aunt Xue, by exercising great tact and finesse, managed to spirit the wine
away when Bao-yu had drunk only a few more cups, and to replace it with a hot, sour
soup of pickled bamboo-shoots and chicken-skin. He drank several bowls of this with
great relish and then ate half a bowl of green-rice gruel. After that, when Bao-chai
and Dai-yu had finished eating, he drank several cups of very strong tea. At this point
Aunt Xue felt sure that he would be all right.
As Snowgoose and the other maids had now finished supper too and were once
more in attendance, Dai-yu asked Bao-yu if he was ready to go. He looked at her
blearily through tired eyes.
‘If you want to go, I will go with you.’
Dai-yu rose to her feet. ‘We really ought to go. We’ve been here practically all day!’
The two of them began saying their good-byes.
A maid came forward with Bao-yu’s rain-hat and he lowered his head slightly for her
to put it on. Holding the brim of the great saucer-shaped red felt top, she jerked it up
and prepared to bring it down, aiming the inside part at his crown.
‘Stop!’ he cried impatiently.’ You have got to go easy with a great clumsy thing like
that! Haven’t you ever seen anyone putting one of these things on before? You had
better let me do it myself.’
‘Come here!’ said Dai-yu standing on the edge of the kang. ‘I’ll put it on for you!’
Bao-yu went and stood in front of her. Putting her two hands round the inner cap,
Dai-yu eased it gently down until its rim fitted over his golden headband, so that the
walnut-sized red woollen pompom of the headband was left quiver?ing outside the
cap on its flexible golden stem.
‘There!’ she said, after a few further adjustments. ‘Now you can put on your cape.’
Bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself.
‘The nurses who came with you are still not back,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Perhaps you had
better wait a bit.’
‘We wait for them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have got the maids. We shall be all right.’
But Aunt Xue was not satisfied, and ordered two of her own women to see the
cousins home.
As soon as they were back they thanked the women for their trouble and went
straight in to see Grandmother Jia, who had not yet had her supper. She was
delighted to learn that they had been with Aunt Xue, and observing that Bao-yu, had
had more than a little to drink, she told him to go and rest in his room and not come
out again, and instructed the servants to keep a careful watch over him.
Remembering which servants usually attended him, she asked what had become of
Nannie Li. The maids dared not tell her the truth, which was that she had gone
home.
‘I think she must have had something to do,’ said one of them. ‘She came in when
we did just now, but went out again almost immediately.’
‘Why worry about her ?’ said Bao-yu over his shoulder, swaying slightly as he made
his way to the bedroom. ‘She’s better looked after than you are! If it weren’t for her I
might live a few days longer!’
Inside his room he found a writing-brush and ink laid out on the desk. Skybright was
the first to greet him.
‘You’re a nice one!’ she said. ‘You made me mix all this ink for you this morning, sat
down in a state of great en?thusiasm, wrote just three characters, threw down the
brush again, rushed out, and left me waiting here all day for you to come back and
finish. Now you just sit down here and use this ink up, and perhaps I’ll let the matter
pass!’
Skybright’s words awoke in Bao-yu a recollection of the morning’s events.
‘What became of the three characters I wrote?’
Skybright laughed. ‘You’re really drunk, aren’t you! This morning before you went to
the other house you gave careful instructions that they were to be pasted up over
the outside door. I was afraid that someone else might make a mess of it, so I got up
on a ladder and spent half the morning sticking them up myself. My hands are still
numb from doing it.’
‘I’d forgotten.’ Bao-yu smiled. ‘If your hands are cold, I’ll warm them for you.’ He
took both her hands in his own and led her outside to inspect the sheet of calligraphy
newly pasted up over the doorway. Just then Dai-yu arrived.
‘I want you to tell me honestly, cousin,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Which of these three
characters do you think is the best?’
Dai-yu looked up at the three characters above the door:

RED RUE STUDY


‘They are all equally good. I didn’t know you could write so beautifully. You must do
one for me some time!’
‘You’re just saying that to humour me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Where is Aroma?’ he asked
Skybright.
Skybright shot out her lips and indicated the kang inside, on which Aroma, fully
clothed, was lying fast asleep.
‘Just look at that!’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘It’s a bit early for sleep, isn’t it?’
He turned once more to Skybright. ‘When I was having lunch at the other house
today there was a plate of bean-curd dumplings. I remembered how fond you are of
those things and asked Mrs Zhen if I could have some to eat in the evening. She had
them sent over for me. Did you get them all right?’
‘Don’t talk to me about those dumplings!’ said Skybright.
‘As soon as they arrived I realized that they must be for me, but as I’d only just
finished eating, I put them on one side meaning to eat them later. Then after a while
Nannie Li came in and caught sight of them. "I don’t expect Bao-yu will want these,"
she said. “I think I’ll take them for my grand children"; and she had them sent round
to her house.’
While Skybright was talking, Snowpink came in carrying some tea on a tray. Bao-yu
invited Dai-yu to have some, to the great merriment of the maids, who pointed out
that she had slipped away some minutes before.
After drinking about half a cupful, Bao-yu suddenly thought of the tea he had drunk
early that morning.
‘When you made that Fung Loo this morning,’ he said to Snowpink, ‘I remember
telling you that with that particular brand the full flavour doesn’t come out until after
three or four waterings. Why have you given me this other stuff? This would have
been just the time to have the Fung Loo.’
‘I was keeping it for you,’ said Snowpink, ‘but Nannie Li came and drank it all.’
With a flick of the wrist Bao-yu hurled the cup he was holding on to the floor, where
it smashed noisily, breaking into innumerable pieces and showering Snowpink’s skirt
with hot tea. He jumped angrily to his feet.
‘Is she your mistress that you should all treat her with such reverence? Merely
because I drank her milk for a few days when I was a baby she is as spoiled and
pampered as though she were some sort of divinity. Let’s get rid of the old woman
now and have done with it!’
And he strode off without more ado to tell Grandmother Jia that he wanted his old
nurse dismissed.
All this time Aroma had been only pretending to sleep, hoping by this means to
engage Bao-yu’s attention and provoke some coquetry between them. As long as the
talk dwelt on calligraphy and Skybright’s dumplings there seemed no pressing need
for her to get up; but when she heard him break a teacup and grow really angry she
hurriedly rose to her feet and intervened to restrain him.
By this time someone had arrived from Grandmother Jia’s room to inquire what all
the noise was about. Aroma pre?tended that she had smashed the cup herself by
slipping on some snow while fetching tea. Having disposed of the inquirer, she then
proceeded to exhort Bao-yu.
‘Dismiss her by all means, if you really want to! But we could all like to leave with
her; so while you are about it, why not make a clean sweep and dismiss the lot of us?
I am sure you will find plenty of other good servants to replace us with.’
Bao-yu had nothing to say to this, and Aroma and the rest helped him onto the kang
and started undressing him. He kept trying to tell them something as they did so, but
an object seemed to impede his tongue and his eyelids were growing increasingly hot
and heavy. Soon the maids had him lying down between covers. Aroma took off the
‘Magic jade’, wrapped it in a piece of silk, and slipped it under the quilt, so that it
should not be cold on his neck the next morning. By this time Bao-yu was already
asleep, having dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow.
While this was going on, Nannie Li and the other old women had arrived back at last.
Learning that Bao-yu was drunk, they dared not approach him and soon went off
again, having satisfied themselves by whispered exchanges that he was safely asleep.

*

Bao-yu awoke next morning to hear someone announcing that ‘Master Rong from
the other house’ had brought Qin Zhong over to pay his respects. Bao-yu hurried out
to re?ceive them and conducted Qin Zhong into the presence of Grandmother Jia.
Observing that Qin Zhong’s good looks and gentle demeanour admirably qualified
him to become Bao-yu’s study-companion, Grandmother Jia was pleased, and made
him stay for tea and then dinner, after which she sent him to be introduced to Lady
Wang and the rest. Everybody loved Qin-shi and was delighted to meet this charming
younger brother, and there were First Meeting presents from everybody waiting for
him when he left. Grandmother Jia’s was an embroidered purse enclosing a little God
of Literature in solid gold to signify that literary success was in the bag’.
‘Since your home is so far away,’ she said to Qin Zhong as he was leaving, ‘the
weather may sometimes make it incon?venient for you to go back at night. In that
case, do please stay here with us! And mind that you always keep with your Uncle
Bao and don’t go getting into mischief with those young ragamuffins at the school!’
Qin Zhong received these admonitions with deference and then went home to report
on the day’s events to his father.
Qin Zhong’s father, Qin Bang-ye, was one of the Secretaries in the Public Buildings
Department of the Board of Works and a man in his middle sixties. He had lost his
wife early, and finding himself still childless at the age of fifty, had adopted a boy and
a girl from an orphanage. The boy had died, leaving only the girl Ke-er, or ‘Ke-qing’ as
she was more elegantly renamed, who had grown up into an extremely charming and
vivacious young woman and been married into the Jia family, with whom her
adoptive father had long had a con?nection.
Qin Bang-ye fathered Qin Zhong when he was fifty-three and the boy was now
twelve years old. His tutor had returned south the year before, and he had been
revising old lessons at home ever since. Qin Bang-ye had himself been on the point of
speaking to his daughter’s in-laws about the possibility of getting Qin Zhong admitted
into the Jia clan school as an external scholar when the happy accident of Qin
Zhong’s meeting with Bao-yu occurred. Bang-ye knew of Jia Dai-ru, the master in
charge of the school, as one of the leading elder scholars of the day, under whose
tutelage there would be every hope of Qin Zhong’s making rapid strides in his
education and eventually obtaining an advancement. He was therefore delighted that
the matter had been so easily con?cluded.
There was only one difficulty. Knowing the sort of style in which the Jias lived,
Bang-ye realized that he would have to dip deeply into his pocket, and his official
salary left that pocket only meagrely supplied. However, since this was a matter
which concerned the whole future of his son, there was nothing for it but to strain
his credit to the utmost. By borrowing a bit here and a bit there he was able to get
to?gether a sum of twenty-four taels of silver which he made up into a packet and
laid reverently before Jia Dai-ru when he took Qin Zhong to the old teacher’s house
to make his kotow. Nothing now remained but for Bao-yu to choose an aus?picious
day on which the two of them could begin school together.
Their entry into the school was the occasion of a tumultuous incident of which an
account will be given in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 9
A son is admonished and Li Gui receives
an alarming warning
A pupil is abused and Tealeaf throws the
classroom in an uproar



In the last chapter we left Qin Bang-ye and his son waiting for a message from the Jia
household to tell them when Qin Zhong was to begin school. Bao-yu was impatient
to see Qin Zhong again and sent word to say that it was to be the day after next.
When the appointed day arrived, Bao-yu rose in the morning to find that Aroma had
already got his books, brushes and other writing materials ready for him and was
sitting disconsolately on the side of his bed. Seeing him get up, she roused herself
and helped him to do his hair and wash. He asked her the cause of her despondency.
     ‘What’s upset you this time, Aroma? I can’t believe you are worried about being
left alone while I am at school.’
     ‘Of course not!’ said Aroma with a laugh. Learning is a very good thing. Without
it you would fritter all your life away and never get anywhere. I only hope that you’ll
see to it that you are learning when you are meant to be and that, when you are not,
you will be thinking about home and not getting into scrapes with the other boys;
because then you would be in real trouble with your father. And though you talk a lot
about the need for effort and self-improvement, it would really be better to do too
little work than too much. For one thing you don’t want to bite off more than you
can chew; and for another you don’t want your health to suffer. At least, that’s how it
seems to me, so you mustn’t mind my saying so.’
      Each time Aroma paused, Bao-yu answered ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. She continued:
      ‘I have packed your big fur gown for the pages to take. Mind you put it on if you
find it cold at the school. It won’t be like here, where there is always someone else to
think of these things for you. I’ve also given them your foot-warmer and your
hand-warmer. You’ll have to see that they give the charcoal a stir from time to time.
They’re such a lazy pack of good-for-nothings, they’ll be only too pleased to do
nothing if you don’t stand over them. You could freeze to death for all they cared.’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know how to do it myself. And don’t go getting
gloomy, all of you, cooped up here while I am away. Try to spend as much time as you
can with my Cousin Lin.’
His dressing was now completed and Aroma urged him to begin his visits to
Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng and Lady Wang. After a few parting instructions to
Skybright and Musk, he went off to his grandmother’s, where he had to listen to
more admonitions, then on to Lady Wang’s, and then outside to the study to see his
father, Jia Zheng.
Jia Zheng was in conversation with his literary gentlemen when Bao-yu entered the
room and made his salutation. Hear?ing him announce that he was off to school to
resume his studies, Jia Zheng smiled sarcastically.
‘I think you had better not use that word “studies” again in my hearing, unless you
want to make me blush for you. In my opinion you might just as well be left to fool
around as before, since that is all you seem fit for. At all events, I don’t want you here.
I find your presence in a place like this con?taminating.’
The literary gentlemen rose to their feet with nervous laughter.
‘Come, come, Sir Zheng! You are too hard on him! Two or three years from now our
young friend will be carrying all before him! He has left his old, childish ways behind
him now –haven’t you boy? Quite reformed. Come!’—two of the older men took
Bao-yu by the hands and hurried him from the room—’I am sure it must be time now
for your breakfast. To breakfast! To breakfast!’
Jia Zheng asked who was in attendance on Bao-yu. There was a ringing ‘Sir!’ from
outside, and three or four strapping fellows entered the study and saluted Manchu
fashion. Jia Zheng recognized the foremost one as Li Gui, the son of Bao-yu’s old
wet-nurse, Nannie Li, and addressed himself to him.
‘You have attended Bao-yu during all his lessons in the past. What precisely has he
been doing? Stuffing his head with worthless nonsense and acquiring a fine new
stock of knavish tricks, I shouldn’t wonder! Wait until I have a little time to spare: I’ll
have your hide off first and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing son of
mine!’
‘Sir!’
Li Gui sank terrified to his knees, snatched off his cap, and knocked the ground
several times with his forehead.
‘Master Bao has read the first three books of the Poetry Classic, sir, up to the part
that goes

                          Hear the happy bleeding deer
Grousing in the vagrant meads…

That’s the truth, sir. I wouldn’t tell a lie.’
This novel version of the well-known lines provoked a roar of laughter from the
literary gentlemen. Even Jia Zheng could not restrain a smile,
‘If he read thirty books of the Poetry Classic,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘it would still be
tomfoolery. No doubt he hopes to deceive others with this sort of thing, but he does
not deceive me. Give my compliments to the Headmaster and tell him from me that I
want none of this trifling with the Poetry Classic or any other ancient literature. It is
of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly understand and learn by heart
the whole Four Books before he attempts anything else.’
‘Sir!’
Seeing that Jia Zheng had nothing more to say, Li Gui and the other servants rose to
their feet again and withdrew.
All this time Bao-yu had been waiting for them in the courtyard outside, scarcely
daring to breathe. As they came out, dusting their knees, Li Gui said,
‘Did you hear that, young master? “Have my hide off first” he said. Some people’s
servants are respected for their masters sakes, but not us. All we get is beatings and
hard words. So spare a thought for us in future, will you?’
‘Don’t be upset, old chap!’ said Bao-yu. Tomorrow I’ll treat you all.’
‘Little ancestor,’ Li Gui replied, ‘nobody’s looking for treats. All we ask is that once
in a while—just once in a while—you should do what you are told.’
They were now back at Grandmother Jia’s apartment. Qin Zhong had already arrived
and was engaged in conversation with the old lady. As soon as the two friends had
greeted each other they took their leave.
Bao-yu suddenly remembered that he had not yet seen Dai-?yu and hurried to her
room to say good-bye. He found her by the window making herself up at the mirror.
Her answer to his announcement that he was off to begin school was smiling but
perfunctory:
‘Good. I wish you every success. I’m sorry I can’t see you off.’
‘Wait till I get back and have had my supper, cousin,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and I will give
you a hand with that rouge.’
He chatted with her for quite a bit longer before finally tearing himself away. As he
was going she suddenly called after him so that he stopped:
‘Aren’t you going to say good-bye to your cousin Bao-chai?’
Bao-yu smiled but said nothing and went straight off to school with Qin Zhong.



*

The Jia clan school was situated at no great distance from Rong-guo House. It was a
charitable foundation which had been established many years previously by the
founder of the family and was designed for the sons and younger brothers of those
members of the clan who could not afford to pay for private tuition. All members of
the clan holding official posts were expected to contribute towards its expenses and
mem?bers of advanced years and known integrity were chosen to be its masters. As
soon as Bao-yu and Qin Zhong arrived they were introduced to the other students
and then set to work at once on their lessons.
From now on the two friends were inseparable, arriving at school and leaving school
together and sitting beside each other in class. Grandmother Jia herself became very
fond of Qin Zhong. She was always having him to stay for three or four nights at a
time and treated him exactly as if he were one of her own great-grandchildren. And
because she realized that his family was not very well off, she frequently helped out
with clothes and the like. Within a month or two he was a familiar and accepted
member of the Rong household.
Bao-yu had always been impatient of social conventions, preferring to let sentiment
rather than convention dictate the terms of his relationships. It was this which now
prompted him to make Qin Zhong the following proposal:
‘You and I are schoolmates and pretty much the same age. Let us in future forget all
this “uncle” “nephew” business and address each other exactly like friends or
brothers!’
Qin Zhong was at first too timid to comply; but as Bao-yu persisted and went on
calling him ‘brother’ or ‘Jing-qing’ (which was his school-name) whenever he spoke
to him, Qin Zhong himself gradually fell into the habit of addressing Bao-yu as an
equal.
All the pupils at the clan school were either members of the Jia clan or relations by
marriage; but as the proverb rightly says, ‘there are nine kinds of dragon and no two
kinds are alike’. Where many are gathered together the wheat is sure to contain a
certain amount of chaff; and this school was no exception in numbering some very
ill-bred persons among its pupils.
The two new boys, Qin Zhong and Bao-yu, were both as beautiful as flowers; the
other scholars observed how shrinking and gentle Qin Zhong was, blushing almost
before you spoke to him and timid and bashful as a girl; they saw in Bao-yu one
whom nature and habit had made humble and accommodating in spite of his social
position, always willing to defer to others in the interest of harmony; they observed
his affectionate disposition and familiar manner of speech; and they could see that
the two friends were devoted to each other. Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that
these observations should have given rise to certain suspicions in the minds of those
ill-bred persons, and that both in school and out of it all kinds of ugly rumours should
have circulated behind their backs.
When Xue Pan learned, some time after moving into his aunt’s place in the capital,
that the establishment included a clan school plentifully stocked with young males of
a certain age, his old enthusiasm for ‘Lord Long-yang’s vice’ was re?awakened, and
he had hastened to register himself as a pupil. His school-going was, needless to say,
a pretence—‘one day fishing and two days to dry the nets’ as they say—and had
nothing to do with the advancement of learning. Having paid a generous fee to Jia
Dai-ru, he used his membership of the school merely as a means of picking up
‘soul-mates’ from among his fellow-students. It must with regret be recorded that a
surprisingly large number of the latter were deluded into becoming his willing victims
by the prospect of receiving those ample advances of money and goods which he
was in a position to offer.
Among them were two amorous young creatures whose names and parentage
escape us but who, because of their glamorous looks and affected manners, were
universally known by the nicknames of ‘Darling’ and ‘Precious’. Although their
fellow-students much admired them and entertained towards them feelings not at all
conducive to that health of mind which the Young Person should at all times
endeavour to cultivate, they were deterred from meddling with them for fear of what
Xue Pan might do.
When Qin Zhong and Bao-yu joined the school it was only to be expected that they
too should fall under the spell of this charming pair; but like the rest they were
inhibited from overt declaration of their feelings by the knowledge that Xue Pan was
their ‘friend’. Their feelings were reciprocated by Darling and Precious, and a bond of
mutual attraction grew up be?tween the four, which nevertheless remained
unexpressed, except for the significant looks that every day passed between them
across the classroom, or the occasional rather too loud utterance to a neighbour of
some remark really intended for the ears of the opposite pair.
     They were persuaded that these cryptic communications had escaped the notice
of their fellows; but they were wrong. Certain young hooligans among their
classmates had long since discerned the true nature of what was going on, and while
the two handsome couples were engaged in their silent and (as they thought) secret
communion, these others would be winking and leering behind their backs or
becoming suddenly convulsed with paroxysms of artificial coughing.
It happened that one day Jia Dai-ru was called home on business and left the class
with the first half of a fourteen word couplet to complete, telling them that he would
be back on the morrow to take them over the next passage in their reading and
putting his eldest grandson Jia Rui in charge of the school during his absence. Xue
Pan had by now stopped coming in even for roll-call, and so on this occasion he too
was out of the way. The opportunity was too good to miss, and Qin Zhong and
Darling, after a preliminary exchange of glances, both asked to be excused and went
round to the rear courtyard to converse.
‘Does your father mind what friends you have?’ Qin Zhong had got no further than
this question when there was a cough behind them. The two boys spun round and
saw that it came from their classmate ‘Jokey’ Jin. Darling had a somewhat impetuous
nature which now, fired by a mixture of anger and shame, caused him to round
sharply on the intruder.
‘What’s that cough supposed to mean? Aren’t we allowed to talk if we want to?’
Jokey Jin leered: ‘If you’re allowed to talk, aren’t I al?lowed to cough if I want to?
What I’d like to know is, if you’ve got something to say to each other, why can’t you
say it out openly? Why all this guilty secrecy? But what’s the good of pretending? It’s
a fair cop. You let me in on your game and I won’t say anything. Otherwise there’ll be
trouble!’
With furious blushes the other two protested indignantly that they did not know
what he was talking about.
Jokey Jin grinned. ‘Caught you in the act, didn’t I?’ He began to clap his hands and
chant in a loud, guffawing voice,

                          ‘Bum-cake!
                          Bum-cake!
                          Let’s all have a
                          Bit to eat!’

Angry and indignant, Qin Zhong and Darling hurried back into the classroom and
complained to Jia Ruj that Jokey Jin was persecuting them.
This Jia Rui was a spineless, unprincipled character who, as a means of obliging the
boys to treat him, always displayed the most shameless favouritism in his settlement
of class-room disputes. In return for money, drinks, and dinners, he had lately given
Xue Pan a free hand in his nefarious activities—had, indeed, not only refrained from
interfering with him, but even ‘aided the tyrant in his tyranny’.
Now Xue Pan was very inconstant in his affections, always blowing east one day and
west the next. He had recently abandoned Darling and Precious in favour of some
newly discovered sweetheart, just as previously he had abandoned Jokey Jin in
favour of Darling and Precious. It followed that in this present confrontation Jia Rui,
to his chagrin, could not hope to gain any rewards by the exercise of his usual
par?tiality. Instead of blaming this vexatious state of affairs on Xue Pan’s fickleness,
however, he directed all his resentment against Darling and Precious, for whom he
felt the same unreasonable jealousy as motivated Jokey Jin and the rest.
Qin Zhong’s and Darling’s complaint at first put Jia Rui in somewhat of a quandary,
for he dared not openly rebuke Qin Zhong. He could, however, give his resentment
outlet by making an example of Darling; so instead of dealing with his complaint, he
told him that he was a trouble-maker and followed this up with so savage a
dressing-down that even Qin Zhong went back to his seat humiliated and crestfallen.
Jokey Jin, now thoroughly cock-a-hoop, wagged his head and tutted in a most
provoking manner and addressed wound?ing remarks to no one in particular, which
greatly upset Darling and Precious for whose ears they were intended. A furious
muttered altercation broke out between them across the intervening desks. Jokey Jin
insisted that he had caught Qin Zhong and Darling in flag rante delicto.
‘I ran into them in the back courtyard, kissing each other and feeling arses as plain
as anything. I tell you they had it all worked out. They were just measuring
themselves for size before getting down to business.’
Reckless in his hour of triumph, he made these wild al?legations, unmindful of who
might hear them. But one heroic soul was moved to mighty anger by his wanton
words. This was Jia Qiang, a member of the Ning-guo branch of the family of the
same generation as Jia Rong. He had lost both his parents when a small child and
been brought up by Cousin Zhen. At sixteen he was even more handsome and
dashing than Jia Rong and the two youths were inseparable friends.
     Any establishment as large as the Ning household always contains a few
disgruntled domestics who specialize in tra?ducing their masters, and a number of
disagreeable rumours concerning Jia Qiang did in fact begin to circulate among the
servants which seem to have reached the ears of Cousin Zhen, for, partly in
self-defence (since they involved him too), he moved Jia Qiang out of the house and
set him up in a small establishment of his own somewhere in the city.
     Jia Qiang possessed a very shrewd brain under his daz?zlingly handsome exterior
His attendance at the school, however, was no more than a blind to his other
activities, principal among which were cock-fighting, dog-racing, and botanizing
excursions into the Garden of Pleasure; but with a doting Cousin Zhen to protect him
on the one hand and Jia Rong to aid and comfort him on the other, there was no one
in the clan who dared thwart him in anything he did.
Since Qin Zhong was the brother-in-law of his best friend, Jia Qiang was naturally
unwilling to stand by and see him abused in so despiteful a manner without doing
anything to help. On the other hand he reflected that there would be certain
disadvantages in coming forward as his cham?pion.
‘Jokey Jin, Jia Rui, and that lot are all friends of Uncle Xue,’ he thought. ‘For that
matter, I’m a friend of Uncle Xue myself. If I openly stick up for Qin Zhong and they go
and tell old Xue, it’ll make things rather awkward between us. On the other hand, if I
don’t interfere at all, Jokey Jin’s rumours are going to get quite out of hand. This calls
for a stratagem of some kind which will shut the little beast up without causing too
much embarrassment afterwards.’
Having thought of a plan, he pretended that he wanted to be excused, and slipping
round to the back, quietly called over Bao-yu’s little page Tealeaf and whispered a
few inflammatory words in his ear.
Tealeaf was the most willing but also the youngest and least sensible of Bao-yu’s
pages. Jia Qiang told him how Jokey Jin had been bullying Qin Zhong. ‘And even
Bao-yu came in for a share,’ he said. ‘If we don’t take this Jin fellow down a peg, next
time he is going to be quite insufferable.’
Tealeaf never needed any encouragement to pick a fight, and now, inflamed by Jia
Qiang’s message and open incitement to action, he marched straight into the
classroom to look for Jokey Jin. And there was no ‘Master Jin’ when he saw him,
either: it was ‘Jin! Who do you think you are?’
At this point Jia Qiang began to scrape his boots on the floor and make a great
business of straightening his clothes and glancing out of the window at the sky,
muttering to himself as he did so, ‘Ah, yes. Hmn. Must be about time.’ Going up to Jia
Rui, he informed him that he had an engagement which necessitated his leaving early,
and Jia Rui not having the courage to stop him, allowed him to slip away.
Tealeaf had by now singled out Jokey Jin and grabbed him by the front of his jacket.
‘Whether we fuck arseholes or not,’ he said, ‘what fucking business is it of yours?
You should be bloody grateful we haven’t fucked your dad. Come outside and fight it
out with me, if you’ve got any spunk in you!’
‘Tealeaf!’ Jia Rui shouted agitatedly. ‘You are not to use such language in here!’
Jokey Jin’s face turned pale with anger.
‘This is mutiny! I don’t have to take this sort of thing from a slave. I shall see your
master about this’ —and he shook himself free of Tealeaf and made for Bao-yu,
intending to seize and belabour him.
As Qin Zhong turned to watch the onslaught, he heard a rushing noise behind his
head and a square inkstone launched by an unseen hand sailed past it and landed on
the desk oc?cupied by Jia Lan and Jia Jun.
Jia Lan and Jia Jun belonged to the Rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same
generation as the other Jia Lan, the little son of Li Wan and nephew of Bao-yu. Jia Jun
had lost his father in infancy and was doted on by his widowed mother. Jia Lan was
his best friend, which is why they always sat next to each other in school. Though Jia
Jun was among the youngest in the class, his tiny body contained an heroic soul. He
was extremely mischievous and completely fearless. With the impartial interest of an
observer he had watched a friend of Jokey Jin’s slyly aim the inkstone at Tealeaf; but
when it fell short and landed right in front of him on his own desk, smashing a
porcelain water-bottle and showering his books with inky water, his blood was up.
‘Rotten swine!’ he shouted. ‘If this is a free-for-all, here goes!’ and he grabbed at
the inkstone intending to send it sailing back. But Jia Lan was a man of peace and
held it firmly down.
‘Leave it, old chap! It’s none of our business,’ he coun?selled.
Jia Jun was not to be restrained, however. Deprived of the inkstone, he picked up a
satchel full of books and raising it in both hands above his head, hurled it in the
direction of the assailant. Unfortunately his body was too small and his strength too
puny for so great a trajectory, and the satchel fell on the desk occupied by Bao-yu
and Qin Zhong. It landed with a tremendous crash, scattering books, papers,
writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing Bao-yu’s teabowl to
smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about. Nothing daunted, Jia
Jun leaped out and rushed upon the thrower of inkstones to smite him.
Meanwhile Jokey Jin had found a bamboo pole which he flailed around him: a
terrible weapon in so confined and crowded a space. Soon Tealeaf had sustained a
blow from it and was bawling for reinforcements from outside. There were three
other pages in attendance on Bao-yu besides himself, all equally inclined to mischief.
Their names were Sweeper, Ploughboy and Inky. With a great shout of ‘To arms! To
arms! Down with the bastards!’ these three now came rushing like angry hornets
into the classroom, Inky wielding a door-bar which he had picked up and Sweeper
and Ploughboy brandishing horsewhips.
Jia Rui, in a frenzy of outraged authority, hopped from one to the other, alternately
grabbing and cajoling, but none would take the slightest bit of notice. Disorder was
now general. The more mischievous of the scholars mingled glee-fully in the fray, safe,
in the general scrimmage, to land punches at chosen foes without fear of discovery
or reprisal. The more timid crawled into places of safety. Others stood on their desks,
laughing and clapping their hands and cheering on the combatants. The classroom
was like a cauldron of still water that had suddenly come to the boil.
Li Gui and the other older servants, hearing the uproar from outside, now hurried in,
and by concerted shouting eventually managed to call the boys to a halt. Li Gui asked
them what they were fighting about. He was answered by a medley of voices, some
saying one thing and some another. Unable to make sense of what he heard, he
turned his attention to Tealeaf and the other pages, cursing them roundly and
turning them out of the room.
Qin Zhong had fallen an early victim to Jokey Jin’s pole, sustaining a nasty graze on
the head which Bao-yu was at this very moment mopping with the flap of his gown.
Seeing that Li Gui had succeeded in restoring some kind of order, he asked to be
taken away.
‘Pack up my books, Li Gui, and fetch the horse, will you? I am going to tell
Great-uncle Dai-ru about this. We were shamefully insulted, and because we didn’t
want to start a quarrel, we went along in a perfectly polite and reasonable manner
and reported the matter to Cousin Rui. But instead of doing anything about it, he
gave us a telling-off, stood by while someone called us filthy names, and actually
encouraged them to start hitting us. Naturally Tealeaf stuck up for us when he saw
we were being bullied. What would you expect him to do? But they all ganged up on
him and started hitting him, and even Qin Zhong’s head was cut open. We can’t go
on studying here after this.’
Li Gui tried to calm him.
‘Don’t be hasty, young master! Your great-uncle has gone home on business and if
we go running after him to pester him about a little thing like this, he’ll think we
don’t know how to behave. If you want my advice, the proper way to settle this affair
is by dealing with it here, where it started. Not by rushing off and upsetting your poor
old uncle.’ He turned to Jia Rui. ‘This is all your fault, Mr Rui, sir. While your granfer is
away you are the head of the whole school and everyone looks to you to set an
example. If anyone does anything they shouldn’t, it’s up to you to deal with it—give
them a hiding, or whatever it is they need. Not sit by and let matters get out of hand
to this extent.’
‘I did tell them to stop,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but they wouldn’t listen.’
‘If you don’t mind my saying so,’ said Li Gui, ‘it’s because you’ve been to blame
yourself on past occasions that these lads won’t do what you tell them to now. So if
this business today does get to the ears of your grandfather, you’ll be in trouble
yourself, along of all the rest. If I were you, sir, I should think of some way of sorting
this out as quickly as possible.’
‘Sort it out nothing!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m definitely going to report this.’
‘If Jokey Jin stays here,’ wailed Qin Zhong tearfully, ‘I’m not studying in this school
any longer.’
‘There is no earthly reason to talk about leaving this school,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have
as much right to come here as anyone else. When I’ve explained to everyone exactly
what happened, Jokey Jin will be expelled.
‘Who is this Jokey Jin, any way?’ he asked Li Gui.
Li Gui thought for a moment.
‘Better not ask. If I told you, it would only make for more unpleasantness.’
Tealeaf’s voice piped up from outside the window:
‘He’s the nephew of Mrs Huang on the Ning-guo side. Trash like that trying to scare
us! I know your Auntie Huang, Jokey Jin! She’s an old scrounger. I’ve seen her down
on her knees in front of our Mrs Lian, begging for stuff so that she could go out and
pawn it. What an aunt! I’d be ashamed to own an aunt like that!’
Li Gui shouted at him furiously.
‘Detestable little varmint! Trust you to know the answer and spread your poison!’
Bao-yu sniffed contemptuously.
‘So that’s who he is! The nephew of Cousin Huang’s wife. I’ll go and speak to her
about this.’
He wanted to go straight away, and called to Tealeaf to come inside and pack up his
books.
‘No need for you to go, Master Bao,’ said Tealeaf as he swaggered in triumphantly
to do his bidding. ‘Let me go for you and save you the trouble. I’ll just say that Lady
Jia wants a word with her, hire a carriage, and bring her along myself. Then you can
question her in front of Lady Jia.’
Li Gui was furious.
‘Do you want to die? If you’re not careful, my lad, when we get home I’ll first thrash
the living daylights out of you and then tell Sir Zheng and Lady Wang that Master Bao
was put up to all this by your provocation. I’ve had trouble enough as it is trying to
get these lads calmed down a bit without needing any fresh trouble from you. It was
all of your making, this rumpus, in the first place. But instead of thinking about ways
of damping it down, you have to go throwing more fat on the fire.’
After this outburst Tealeaf was at last silent.
Jia Rui was by now terrified lest the matter should go any further and his own far
from clean record be brought to light. Fear made him abject. Addressing Qin Zhong
and Bao-yu in turn, ‘he humbly begged them not to report it. At first they were
adamant. Then Bao-yu made a condition:
‘All right, we won’t tell. But you must make Jokey Jin apologize.’
At first Jokey Jin refused, but Jia Rui was insistent, and Li Gui added his own
persuasion:
‘After all, it started with you, so if you don’t do what they say, how are we ever
going to end it?’
Under their combined pressure Jokey Jin’s resistance at last gave way and he locked
hands and made Qin Zhong a bow. But Bao-yu said this was not enough. He insisted
on a kotow. Jia Rui, whose only concern now was to get the matter over with as
quickly as possible, quietly urged him to comply:
‘You know what the proverb says:
He who can check the moment’s rage
Shall calm and carefree end his days.’
Did Jokey Jin comply? The following chapter will reveal.
CHAPTER 10
Widow Jin’s self-iinterest gets the better of her
righteous indignation
And Doctor Zhang’s diagnosis reveals the origin
of a puzzling disease



Outnumbered, and hard pressed by Jia Rui to apologize, Jokey Jin made a kotow to
Qin Zhong, whereupon Bao-yu agreed to let the matter drop. Back in his own home,
when school was over, he brooded with mounting anger on his humiliation.
‘Qin Zhong is Jia Rong’s brother-in-law: it’s not as if he were one of the Jia clan. He’s
only an external scholar, the same as me; and it’s only because he is friends with
Bao-yu that he can afford to be so high and mighty. Well, in that case he ought to
behave himself, then no one would have any cause to complain. But he’s always
carrying on in such a sneaky, underhand way with Bao-yu, as though he thought the
rest of us were all blind and couldn’t see what he was up to. And now today he’s
started making up to someone else and I happen to have found him out. So what if
there were a row about this? I’ve got nothing to be afraid of.’
His mother, Widow Jin, overheard his muttering.
‘What have you been getting up to this time ?’ she asked. ‘Look at the job we had
getting you into that school. All the talks I had with your aunt and the trouble she
went to to see Mrs Lian about it. Suppose we hadn’t had their help in getting you in
there, we could never have afforded a tutor. What’s more, you get free tea and free
dinners there, don’t you? That has meant a big saving for us during the two years you
have been going there. And you’re glad enough to have some?thing decent to wear
out of the money saved, aren’t you? And another thing. If you hadn’t been going to
that school, how would you ever have met that Mr Xue of yours? Between seventy
and eighty taels of silver we’ve had out of him during this past year. I can tell you this,
my boy. If you get yourself thrown out of there, you needn’t think you can get in
anywhere else, because you could easier fly to the moon than find another place like
that. Now you just play quietly for a bit and then go to bed like a good boy!’
Thus admonished, Jokey Jin swallowed his anger and fell silent. Before long he went
to bed and to sleep, and next day was back at the school again as usual. Of him no
more.



*
Jokey Jin’s aunt was married to one Jia Huang, a member of the Jia clan in the same
generation as Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian. It goes without saying, of course, that not all
members of the clan lived in the sort of style maintained by the Ning and Rong
households. Jia Huang and his wife had only the income from a very small property
to live on, and it was only by dint of frequent visits to the Ning and Rong mansions,
where their flattering attentions on Wang Xi-feng and You-shi earned them an
occasional subsidy, that they were able to make ends meet.
Today the weather was fine and sunny and Mrs Huang had nothing particular to do at
home, so taking an old serving-woman with her, she got into a cab and went off to
pay a call on her sister-in-law and nephew.
In the course of conversation Widow Jin soon got on to the subject of yesterday’s
affair in the schoolroom and launched into a full account, from which no detail was
omitted, of all those happenings. It would have been as well for her if she had not
done so, for the effect was to kindle a dangerous anger in the bosom of her
sister-in-law.
‘That little beast Qin Zhong!’ said Mrs Huang. ‘He may be related to the Jias, by
marriage, but then so is your boy. What business has he to go throwing his weight
about like that, I should like to know? Especially after the disgusting things he had
been doing himself. Considering what he’d been up to, even Bao-yu ought not to
have sided with him to that extent. Let me go and see Mrs Zhen about this. I shall ask
her to let me have it out with Qin Zhong’s sister and see if we can’t get some
satisfaction.’
‘Oh dear, I shouldn’t talk so much! I never meant to tell you this. Please, my dear, I
beg of you not to speak to them about it! Never mind the rights and wrongs of the
case, if this all gets out, they will make it too hot for my boy to stay on at the school;
and if he had to stop going to the school, we should never be able to afford a tutor
for him, quite apart from all the extra expense I should have of feeding him during
the day.’
‘Never mind about all that!’ said Mrs Huang. ‘We’ll worry about that after I’ve
spoken to them and seen what happens.’
Dismissing her sister-in-law’s entreaties, she sent the old servant-woman out for a
cab, and getting inside, drove straight off to the Ning-guo mansion. But by the time
she had reached it, driven in at the east end gate, dismounted from the carriage and
gone in to see You-shi, the edge had already worn off her anger, and it was only after
deferential inquiries about the health and comfort of her hostess and various other
in-consequential matters that she got around to asking what had become of Qin-shi,
who was usually in evidence during her visits.
‘I don’t know what’s the matter with her lately,’ said You?-shi. ‘It’s been more than
two months now since she had a period, yet the doctors say she isn’t pregnant. And
during the last few days she’s been getting so tired and listless in the afternoons:
doesn’t feel like doing anything; doesn’t even feel like talking; all the spirit seems to
have gone out of her. I’ve said to her, “Never mind about wifely duties. Just forget
about the morning and evening visits and concentrate on getting better. Even when
relations call,” I said, “I can see to them myself. And never mind what the older
members of the family might say: I’ll do all the explaining for you.” I’ve spoken to
Rong, as well. “You’re not to tire her out,” I told him, “and you’re not to let her get
upset! She must just rest quietly for a few days and look after herself. And if there’s
anything she fancies to eat, just come to my apartment to get it. Because if anything
should happen to her,” I said, “you wouldn’t find another wife like that, with her
looks and her good nature, if you took a lantern to look for her.” She’s such a sweet
person, there isn’t anyone among our relations or among the older members of the
family who doesn’t love her. I’ve been so worried on her account these last few days.
And just to make matters worse, first thing this morning her young brother comes
along—Silly little boy! he ought to have realized that his sister wasn’t well and not in
a condition to listen to such things, even if he’d suffered ten thousand times the
injustice!—It seems that yesterday there was a fight at the school. One of the
external students—I don’t know which one it was—had been bullying him; and there
were a lot of other very nasty things as well. So he had to go and tell all this to his
sister. Well, you know how sensitive she is, my dear, in spite of the fact that she
always seems so lively and full of fun to talk to. The slightest little thing can upset her
and set her brooding on it for whole days and nights together. In fact, this illness has
been brought on by too much worrying, I’m sure of it. Well, this morning when she
heard that someone had been bullying her brother, it both upset her and at the same
time made her angry. She was upset to think that those horrible boys at the school
should be able to twist things round and say such ter?rible things about him, but she
was also angry with him, because she said he must have been getting into bad ways
and not giving his mind properly to his studies to have got into trouble of this sort in
the first place. So of course, because of this upset she wouldn’t have any breakfast.
I’ve just been round there trying to calm her. I gave her brother a talking-to and sent
him round to see Bao-yu, and I stood over her while she ate half a bowlful of
bird’s-nest soup. I’ve only just this minute got back. Oh, I’m so worried about her, my
dear! We haven’t got a good doctor at the moment, either. It pierces me to the heart
when I think about that child’s illness! I suppose you don’t happen to know of a good
doctor, do you?’
Mrs Huang’s determination to have things out with Qin-shi, of which she had boasted
so valiantly at her sister-in-law’s, had, in the course of this outpouring, fled to the far
kingdom of Java. She hastened to own that she knew of no good doctor.
‘But hearing what you have said about this illness,’ she added, ‘I can’t help
wondering if it may not after all be preg?nancy. You want to be careful they don’t
give her the wrong treatment. If they give her the wrong treatment for that, there
will be real trouble!’
‘I know,’ said You-shi. ‘That’s what I say.’
While they were still talking, Cousin Zhen came in from outside. ‘Isn’t this Cousin
Huang’s wife?’ he asked You-shi, catching sight of the visitor. Mrs Huang dropped him
a curtsey and a ‘how-do-you-do’. ‘You must ask our cousin to dinner,’ he said, going
on into the room beyond.
The original object of Mrs Huang’s visit had of course been to complain to Qin-shi
about Qin Zhong’s treatment of her nephew. Hearing of Qin-shi’s illness she had
abandoned all thought of even mentioning the subject; and now that Cousin Zhen
and You-shi were being so nice to her, her anger grad?ually gave way to pleasure, and
after gossiping a while longer she went off home.
When she had gone, Cousin Zhen came in again and sat down.
‘What did she come about today?’ he asked You-shi.
‘Oh,’ said You-shi, ‘nothing in particular. When she first came in she appeared to be
upset about something or other, then after we’d been talking for some time and I
mentioned that Rong’s wife was ill, she gradually calmed down. When you invited her
to dinner she knew she couldn’t very well stay on with sickness in the house and left
after chatting a few minutes longer. She didn’t ask for anything before she went.
     ‘But let’s talk about that child’s illness. The thing is, you really must find a good
doctor to look at her, before it gets too late. This lot we have around the house at
present are com?pletely useless! Each one of them just listens to what you say and
then gives it back to you with a few learned words thrown in. And they’re so terribly
conscientious about it! We have three or four of them coming by turns every day,
and some?times they’ll take her pulse four or five times in the same day. Then they
have long discussions while they decide on a prescription. None of the medicine does
her any good, and the only consequence of all this is that she is having to change her
clothes four or five times in a day and be constantly getting up and sitting down to
see these doctors, which is no good at all for a person in her condition.’
     ‘Oh, she’s a silly child!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘There’s no need for all this dressing
and undressing. Suppose she caught a chill on top of this other illness, that would be
really frightful. Never mind about the clothes, for goodness’ sake, however good they
are! It’s the child’s health that matters. Who cares if she has to have a completely
new outfit every day? We can afford it.
‘What I was going to tell you is that I’ve just had a visit from Feng Zi-ying. He
noticed that something was bothering me, and when he asked me what it was I
explained that our daughter-in-law isn’t well and told him how worried we are
because we haven’t got a decent doctor who can tell us for sure whether it’s
pregnancy or disease, so that we don’t even know how serious it is. Then Feng
Zi-ying told me about a scholar friend of his called Zhang You-shi. He and Feng were
at school together. He is a man of very wide learning including, apparently, an
excellent knowledge of medicine and the ability to tell with certainty whether a
disease is curable or not. He’s up at the capital this year to purchase a place for his
son and is at present staying in Feng Zi-ying’s house. It looks as if in his hands she
might stand a good chance of getting better. Anyway, I’ve already sent someone
round with my card and and asked him to call. It’s getting a bit late for him to come
today, but he should definitely be round tomorrow. Feng Zi-ying promised to see him
when he got back and put in a word for me to make quite sure that he agrees to
come. So we’ll just have to wait and see what this Dr Zhang says.’
You-shi was delighted with this news.
‘And what are we going to do about Father’s birthday?’ she asked. ‘It’s the day
after tomorrow.’
‘I’ve just been out to see him,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘and I took the opportunity while I
was there of asking him if he would come over on his birthday to receive everyone’s
kowtows, but he refused. He said, “I’ve got used to the peace and quiet of the
monastery and I’m not willing to go back into your quarrelsome world again. If you
insist on celebrating my birthday it would be a hundred times better to have my tract
on Divine Rewards written out by a good calligrapher and cut on blocks for printing
than to drag me back to your house for a lot of senseless head-knocking.” He said, “If
the family turn up tomorrow and the day after for my birthday, you can give them a
party yourself. But don’t go sending me any presents,” he said, “and don’t come
yourself! If it will set your mind at zest you can give me a kotow now and get it over
with. But if you come round here the day after tomorrow with a lot of other people
to pester me, I shall refuse to see you.” Well, after that I obviously can’t go again on
his birthday. We’d better have Lai Sheng in and make arrangements for two days’
entertainment.’
You-shi called in Jia Rong.
‘Tell Lal Sheng to prepare the usual two-day party for Grandfather,’ she said. ‘Say
we want a really good spread. We shall be asking Lady Jia.and Sir Zheng and Lady
Wang and your Auntie Lian from the other house: you can go round yourself to invite
them.
‘And by the way: today your father heard of a good doctor and has already sent
someone to ask him round. He should be coming tomorrow. When he does, you had
better tell him exactly what your wife’s symptoms have been during the past few
days.’
Jia Rong promised to carry out his mother’s instructions and left the room,
encountering, as he did so, the youth who had been sent to Feng Zi-ying’s house to
request a call from the doctor. He had just got back from delivering his message and
reported to Jia Rong as follows:
‘I took the Master’s card to the doctor at Mr Feng’s house and asked him to call. He
said Mr Feng had already spoken to him about it, but he had been out visiting all day
and only just got back and he simply didn’t have the energy to go out any more today.
He said, “Even if I were to go round to your house now I shouldn’t be able to take the
young lady’s pulse. It would take me all night to get my breathing regulated.
However,” he said, “I shall definitely call round tomorrow.” And he said, “My
knowledge of medicine is really too slight for a consultation of this importance, but
as your master and Mr Feng are so pressing, I obviously cannot refuse. But I hope you
will explain this to your master.” And he said, “As for your master’s card, that is an
honour I really cannot accept”; and he made me bring it back. Will you please pass
on this message for me, Master Rong?’
Jia Rong turned and went back into the room to tell his parents. Going out once more,
he summoned Lai Sheng and gave instructions for preparing a two-day birthday party,
which Lai Sheng duly proceeded to put into operation. But of that no more.
About noon next day one of the servants at the gate came in to report:
‘The Dr Zhang you sent for has arrived, sir’.
Cousin Zhen went out to receive the doctor and con?ducted him into the main
reception room, where they both sat down. He waited until the doctor had taken tea
before broaching the subject of his visit.
‘Yesterday Mr Feng was telling me about your great learning,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I
gather that it includes a pro?found knowledge of medicine. I assure you I was very
much impressed.’
‘I am only a very indifferent scholar,’ replied Dr Zhang, ‘and my knowledge is really
extremely superficial. However, Mr Feng was telling me yesterday of the courteous
and con?siderate patronage of scholars which is traditional in your family, so when I
received your summons I felt unable to refuse. I must insist, though, that I am
entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all
too soon become apparent.’
‘My dear sir, you are altogether too modest,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Do you think I
could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-in-law? We are relying on
your superior knowledge to put us out of our uncertainty.’
He left the doctor in the charge of Jia Rong, who conducted him through the inner
part of the house to his own apartment, where Qin-shi was.
‘Is this the lady?’ asked the doctor.
‘Yes, this is my wife,’ Jia Rong replied. ‘Do sit down! I ex?pect you would like me to
describe her symptoms first, before you take the pulse?’
‘If you will permit me, no,’ said the doctor. ‘I think it would be better if I took the
pulse first and asked you about the development of the illness afterwards. This is the
first time .I have been to your house, and as I am not a skilled practitioner and have
only come here at our friend Mr Feng’s insistence, I think I should take the pulse and
give you my diagnosis first. We can go on to talk about her symptoms and discuss a
course of treatment if you are satisfied with the diagnosis. And of course, it will still
be up to you to decide whether or not the treatment I prescribe is to be followed.’
‘You speak with real authority, doctor,’ said Jia Rong. ‘I only wish we had got to hear
of you earlier. Take her pulse now, then, and let us know whether what she has can
be cured, so that my parents may be spared further anxiety.’
At this point Qin-shi’s women carried in a large arm-rest of the kind used in
consultations, propped her forward with her arms across it, and drew back her
sleeves, exposing both arms at the wrist. The doctor stretched out his hand and laid
it on her right wrist, then, having first regulated his own breathing in order to be able
to count the rate, he felt the pulses with great concentration for the space of several
minutes, after which he transferred to the left wrist and spent an equal amount of
time on that. This done, he proposed that they should withdraw to the outside room
to talk.
Jia Rong accompanied him outside and sat with him on the kang. An old woman
served tea, which Jia Rong invited the doctor to take, waiting until he had done so
before asking him for his diagnosis.
‘Tell me, doctor, from your reading of my wife’s pulse, do you think she can be
cured?’
‘Well, the lower left distal pulse is rapid and the lower left median pulse is strong
and full,’ said the doctor. ‘On the right side, the distal pulse is thin and lacks strength
and the median pulse is faint and lacks vitality.
‘Now, a rapid lower left-hand distal pulse means that a malfunction of the
controlling humour of the heart is causing it to generate too much fire; and the
strong lower median pulse means that the liver’s humour is blocked, giving rise to a
deficiency of blood. A thin, weak distal pulse on the right side indicates a gross
deficiency of humour in the lungs; and a faint right median pulse lacking in vitality
shows that the earth of the spleen is being subdued by the woody element of the
liver.
‘If the heart is generating fire, the symptoms should be ir?regularity of the menses
and insomnia. A deficiency of blood and blockage of humour in the liver would result
in pain and congestion under the ribs, delay of the menses beyond their term, and
burning sensations in the heart. A deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise
to sudden attacks of giddiness, sweating at five or six in the morning, and a sinking
feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat. And if the earth of the spleen
is being subdued by the wood of the liver, she would undoubtedly experience loss of
appetite, lassitude, and general enfeeblement of the whole body. If my reading of the
lady’s pulse is correct, she ought to be showing all these symptoms. Some people
would tell you they indicated a pregnancy, but I am afraid I should have to disagree.’
‘You must have second sight, doctor!’ said one of the old women, a body-servant of
Qin-shi’s who was standing by. ‘What you have said exactly describes how it is with
her; there is no need for us to tell you anything more. Of all the doctors we’ve lately
had around here to look at her none has ever spoken as much to the point as this.
Some have said she’s expecting; others have said it’s illness; one says it’s not serious;
another only gives her till the winter solstice; not one of them tells you anything you
can really rely on. Please doctor, you tell us: just how serious is this illness ?’
‘I am afraid my colleagues have allowed your mistress’s condition to deteriorate,’
said the doctor. ‘If she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning, when
she first started her courses, there is every reason to suppose that she would by now
be completely cured. But the illness has been neglected for so long now, this
breakdown was almost bound to happen. I would say that with proper treatment she
has about a one in three chance of recovery. We shall just have to see how she
responds to my medicine. If, after taking it, she can get a good night’s sleep, her
chances will be distinctly better: say fifty?-fifty.
‘From my reading of her pulse, I should expect your mistress to be a very highly
strung, sensitive young woman. Sometimes, when people are over-sensitive, they
find a good deal that is upsetting in what goes on around them; and of course, if
things are upsetting them, they will tend to worry a lot. This illness has been caused
by too much worry affecting the spleen and causing an excess of wood in the liver,
with the result that the menstrual blood has been prevented from flowing at the
proper times. If we were to ask your mistress about the dates of her courses, I am
sure we should find that they tended to be on the late side, isn’t that so?’
‘Absolutely right,’ the old woman replied. ‘Her periods have never been early.
Sometimes two or three days late, sometimes as much as ten days: but in any case,
always late.’
‘You see!’ said the doctor. ‘There is the cause of the trouble. If she could have been
treated in time with something to fortify the heart and stabilize the humours, she
would never have got into this present state. What we have now, I am afraid, is an
advanced case of dehydration. Well, we shall have to see what my medicine can do
for her.’
He wrote out the following prescription and handed it to Jia Rong:

For a decoction to increase the breath, nourish the heart, fortify the spleen and calm
the liver

R
    Ginseng 2 drams
    Atractylis (clay-baked)    2 drams
    Lycoperdon 3 drams
    Nipplewort (processed) 4 drams
    Angelica 2 drams
    White peony root       2 drams
    Hemlock parsley 1? drams
    Yellow vetch root3 drams
    Ground root of nutgrass 2 drams
    Hate’s ear (in vinegar)    ? dram
    Huaiqing yam 2 drams
    Dong E ass’s glue (prepn with powdered oyster-shell)    2 drams
    Corydalis (cooked in wine) 1? drams
    Roast liquorice ? dram
Adjuvant: Excoriate and remove pits from 7 lotus-seeds;
Item 2 large jujubes.
‘Most impressive!’ said Jia Rong, glancing at the pre?scription. ‘Tell me, though,
doctor: just how serious is this illness? Is her life in danger?’
The doctor smiled. ‘You are an intelligent young man, Mr Jia. When an illness has
reached this stage, it is not going to be cured in an afternoon. We must see how she
responds to medication. As I see it, there is no real danger this winter. I should say
that if she can get past the spring equinox, you could look forward to a complete
recovery.’
Jia Rong was intelligent enough to understand the real import of what the doctor was
telling him and did not question him further. Having first seen him out, he went in to
show the prescription and written summary of the diagnosis to Cousin Zhen and gave
both his parents a full account of what the doctor had said.
‘No other doctor has ever spoken so convincingly,’ said You-shi, turning to Cousin
Zhen. ‘I am sure his medicine will do her good.’
Cousin Zhen smiled complacently.
‘This man is no medical hack practising for a living,’ he said. ‘It’s only because Feng
Zi-ying is such a good friend of mine that he could be persuaded to come and see us.
Perhaps with a man like this treating her our daughter-in-law stands some chance of
getting better. I see there is ginseng in that prescription, by the way. You can use
some of that pound of high-grade ginseng we bought the other day.’
     Seeing that they had no more to say, Jia Rong went out and ordered the drugs
for Qin-shi’s medicine to be purchased and prepared. But you will have to read the
next chapter if you want to know what effect the medicine had on her when she had
taken it.
CHAPTER 11

Ning-guo House celebrates the birthday
of an absent member
And Jia Rui conceives an illicit passion
for his attractive cousin

Jia Jing’s birthday had now arrived. Cousin Zhen packed sixteen lacquer gift-boxes
with the rarest and choicest deli?cacies and instructed Jia Rong to take a number of
domestics with him and deliver them to Jia Jing. He was to observe carefully whether
or not his grandfather was pleased, and having made his kotow, was to deliver the
following message:
‘Because of your request, Father has not ventured to visit you himself. Instead he
will place himself at the head of the entire family and lead them in prostrating
themselves in your direction.’
Having received his father’s instructions, Jia Rong mus?tered his band of servants and
set out.
Back at home visitors gradually began to arrive. Jia Lian and Jia Qiang were the first.
Having inspected the various seating arrangements, they inquired whether there was
to be entertainment of some kind.
‘The Master had originally been reckoning on old Sir Jing coming here today,’ said
one of the servants, ‘so he didn’t arrange for any entertainment. But the day before
yesterday he learned that Sir Jing would not be coming, so he asked us to find a
troupe of actors and a band. They are at present on the stage in the garden getting
ready for the performance.’
Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and Bao-yu arrived next and were welcomed
and conducted inside by Cousin Zhen and You-shi. You-shi’s mother was already there.
She was introduced to the new arrivals, who were then invited to sit down and were
served by Cousin Zhen and You-shi with tea.
‘We realize,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘that Lady Jia is a generation older than Father.
Father is only her nephew, of course, and strictly speaking it wasn’t correct form to
invite a person of her age at all. Nevertheless, since the weather is so fresh and nice
just now and the chrysanthemums in the garden at their best, we had rather hoped
that she might enjoy coming over for a bit and having all her children and
grandchildren around her. That was our only motive in asking her. I’m sorry she
decided not to honour us.’
‘Up to yesterday,’ Xi-feng put in hurriedly, not waiting for Lady Wang to reply,
‘Grandmother had been intending to come. Then yesterday evening she saw Bao-yu
eating some peaches and the greedy old thing couldn’t resist trying one herself. She
only ate about two thirds of a peach, but she had to get up twice running in the early
hours, and this morning she still felt rather poorly and told me to tell you that she
definitely wouldn’t be able to come. But she said that if you have any specially nice
things to eat she would like one or two kinds to try; only they must be soft and easy
to digest.’
Cousin Zhen smiled with pleasure.
‘Well, that’s all right then. Knowing how much Grandma enjoys a bit of fun, I
thought it didn’t seem like her not to come today unless she had some good reason
for not coming.’
‘The other day Xi-chun was telling us that Rong’s wife is not very well,’ said Lady
Wang. ‘What exactly is wrong with her?’
‘It’s a very puzzling illness,’ You-shi replied. ‘At Mid-Autumn last month, when she
got back from playing cards half the night with you and Lady Jia, she seemed
perfectly all right. But from the twentieth onwards she seemed to get more and
more tired and listless every day—too tired even to eat. She’s been like that for more
than a fortnight now, and it is two months since she had a period.’
‘Couldn’t she be expecting?’ said Lady Xing.
They were interrupted by a servant from outside:
‘Sir She and Sir Zheng and all the other gentlemen have arrived, sir. They are in the
main reception room.’
Cousin Zhen hurried out.
‘To begin with that’s what some of the doctors told us,’ said You-shi, resuming the
conversation; ‘but yesterday Feng Zi-ying introduced a doctor friend of his to us who
is terribly good, someone he went to school with, and he said that she wasn’t
expecting at all. He said she was suffering from a serious illness. He wrote a
prescription for her yesterday and she has already had one dose of the medicine.
Today her giddiness is a bit better, but everything else is still pretty much the same.’
‘There!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I thought it must be something quite serious to keep her
away, especially on a day like this. I know she would have forced herself to come if
she could have done.’
‘You remember you saw her here on the third,’ said You-shi. ‘She had a terrible
struggle to keep going on that occasion. It was only because the two of you have
always been so close and she didn’t want to miss you that she made the effort.’
Xi-feng’s eyes became moist and for a moment she was too overcome to speak.
‘I know “the weather and human life are both unpredic?table”,’ she said at last,
‘but she’s only a child still. If anything should happen to her as a result of this illness, I
think all the fun would go out of life!’
While she was speaking Jia Rong came in, and having greeted in turn first Lady Xing,
then Lady Wang, and then Xi-feng, he turned to his mother:
‘I’ve just delivered the food to Grandfather, and I told him that Father was
entertaining all the men of the family at home and had not presumed to visit him
because of what he said. Grandfather was very pleased. He said “That is exactly as it
should be.” He said I was to tell you and Father to see that my great-uncles and
great-aunts are properly looked after, and he told me that I was to look after my
uncles and aunts and cousins. He also said he wanted the blocks for Divine Rewards
to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution.
I’ve already given this message to Father. Now I’ve got to hurry off again to look after
the gentlemen while they have their dinner.’
‘Rong, just a moment!’ said Xi-feng as he was going. ‘How is it really with your
wife?’
Jia Rong’s brows contracted in a worried frown.
‘She’s not at all well, Auntie. You’ll know what I mean when you see her presently.’
He left without saying any more.
‘Well, ladies!’ said You-shi. ‘Will you have dinner in here, or shall we eat in the
garden? There are some actors in the garden preparing an entertainment.’
‘In here would be all right, wouldn’t it?’ said Lady Wang with a glance in Lady Xing’s
direction.
You-shi at once gave orders to her women to serve. There was an answering cry from
outside the door and a great flurry of domestics each bustling about her own
contribution to the meal. In no time at all the table was laid and dinner ready. You-shi
made Lady Xing and Lady Wang sit at the head with her mother, while she, Xi-feng
and Bao-yu sat at the two sides.
Lady Xing and Lady Wang politely protested that they had come to offer birthday
felicitations, not to eat a birthday feast.
‘Yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘After all these years of spiritual self-improvement, Uncle must by
now be practically an Immortal. And with Immortals, as we all know, “it’s the thought
that counts and not the ceremony”.’
The others all laughed.
You-shi’s mother, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng, having finished their meal,
rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands, had just announced their intention
of going into the garden, when Jia Rong came in with a message for his mother.
‘My great-uncles and all the other gentlemen have just finished their dinner.
Great-uncle She says he has business at home, and Great-uncle Zheng doesn’t like
plays because he says he can’t stand the noise; but all the others have gone with
Uncle Lian and Cousin Qiang to watch the players.
‘People have come with cards and birthday presents from the Prince of An-nan, the
Prince of Dong-ping, the Prince of Xi-ning, the Prince of Bei-jing, the Duke of
Zhen-guo and five others of the Niu clan and the Marquis of Zhong-jing and seven
others of the Shi clan. The presents have all been received at the counting-house.
They have been entered in the gift-book, and the people who brought them have
been issued with thank-you cards. They have also been tipped the usual amounts and
given a meal before leaving.
‘And Father says will you please bring the great-aunts and Grandmother You and
Auntie Feng to the garden now.’
‘Yes, we’ve finished too,’ said You-shi. We were about to come over when you
arrived.’
‘Aunt Wang,’ said Xi-feng, ‘may I go and see Rong’s wife first? I can go on to the
garden from there.’
‘Certainly. You ought to go,’ said Lady Wang. ‘In fact, we should all like to go with
you, but I am afraid it would be too much excitement for her. Please give her our
love.’
‘My dear,’ said You-shi, ‘I know she will always do any-thing you ask her to. See if
you can talk her into a more cheerful frame of mind. It would be such a relief to me if
you could. But join us in the garden as soon as you can!’
Bao-yu asked if he could go with Xi-feng to see Qin-shi.
‘Yes,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She is your nephew’s wife. I think you should. Just look in for
a moment, though, and then join the rest of us.’
Thereupon You-shi invited Lady Wang, Lady Xing and old Mrs You to accompany her
to the All-scents Garden, while Xi-feng and Bao-yu accompanied Jia Rong to Qin-shi’s
room.
Entering the door of the apartment, they tiptoed softly into the inner room. As soon
as she saw them, Qin-shi attempted to rise, but Xi-feng would not let her.
‘No, no, don’t get up!’ she said. ‘You will make yourself giddy.’
In two rapid strides she was at her side and holding her by the hand.
‘My dearest child! It’s only a few days since last I saw you, but look how thin you
have grown!’
She sat down beside her on the quilt on which she sat propped. Bao-yu, after
greeting her, sat in a chair opposite.
‘Pour out some tea,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Auntie Feng and Uncle Bao didn’t get any after
their dinner.’
Qin-shi grasped Xi-feng’s hand and forced a smile to her wan face.
‘It looks as though I wasn’t meant to be happy, Auntie!’ she said. ‘This is such a
lovely family to have married into. Rong’s parents treat me as if I were their own
daughter. Rong may be young, but he respects me, and I respect him; there has never
been a cross word between us. You, it goes without saying—but not only you, all the
older members of the family—have always been goodness itself to me. I did so want
to he worthy of all this kindness. But now this wretched illness has come along and
taken away the chance. Now I shall never be able to be a good daughter to Rong’s
parents; and however badly I want to, I shall never be able to repay any of the love
you have shown me. I have a feeling inside me, Auntie: I don’t think I am going to last
the year out.’
Bao-yu had been studying the ‘Spring Slumber’ painting on Qin-shi’s wall all this time
and re-reading the couplet by Qin Guan on the scrolls at each side of it:
The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream;
The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents.

As he did so, the memory returned of that earlier afternoon when he had slept in
that very same room and dreamed about the Land of Illusion. He was musing on the
contents of that dream when he suddenly became aware of the words that Qin-shi
was saying. They pierced his heart like the points of a thousand arrows. Great tears
welled up in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks. Xi-feng, seeing him, was herself
deeply affected; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make Qin-shi even more
distressed, whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up, she
rallied him lightly on his tears.
‘Don’t be such a baby, Bao-yu! It’s not really that serious: sick people always say
things like that. Besides, she’s still young, and when you are young you can shake an
illness off in no time at all. --- You mustn’t let yourself think such stupid things,’ she
said, turning to Qin-shi. ‘You’ll make yourself worse.’
‘If only she could get a bit of food inside her.’ said Jia Rong. ‘That’s her real trouble:
she won’t eat anything.’
‘Bao,’ said Xi-feng, ‘your mother told you not to stay long. If you’re going to be like
this, you will only upset her, and in any case I expect your mother is beginning to
wonder about you—You go on ahead with Uncle Bao,’ she said to Jia Rong. ‘I am
going to sit a little longer with your wife.’
     Jia Rong at once led Bao-yu away to join the others in the All-scents Garden,
while Xi-feng addressed some words of encouragement to Qin-shi, after which,
dropping her voice to a murmur, she engaged in a long and intimate conversation
with her, ignoring two or three messages from You-shi urging her to join the party. At
last she felt unable to stay any longer.
‘Look after yourself!’ she said. ‘I shall come again. I feel sure that you are meant to
get better. It can’t have been an accident that they found that doctor the other day;
and now that you’ve got him, there’s really nothing to worry about.’
Qin-shi smiled.
‘Even if he’s a miracle-man, Auntie, “death’s a sickness none can cure”, and I know
that it’s just a question of time now.’
‘If you will go on talking like that, how can you possibly get better?’ said Xi-feng. ‘If
only you would try to look on the bright side. Remember what the doctor said. He
said that if you weren’t being properly treated, next spring would be dangerous for
you. If this were a household which couldn’t afford things like ginseng for your
treatment, you might have something to worry about. But now they know that you
can be cured, there’s nothing Rong’s parents wouldn’t do and nothing they couldn’t
afford to do for you. Never mind two drams of ginseng a day; if you needed two
pounds a day, they would get it for you gladly. So do try and get better! I must go
over to the garden now.’
‘Forgive me for not being able to see you out, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi. ‘Please come
again when you are free. We’ll have a nice talk together, just the two of us.’
There were tears in Xi-feng’s eyes as she promised to come often, whenever she was
free. Then, followed by the women who had accompanied her from the Rong
mansion and a number of female domestics belonging to the Ning household, she
made her way round to one of the side gates leading into the gardens.
        Golden chrysanthemums covered the open spaces;
        Silvery willow-trees bordered the water’s margins.
    The little bridge arched its span over a storied stream;
    The winding path made its way into a fairy hill.
        Crystal rills tinkled amidst the rocks.
        A quickset hedge recalled preautumnal fragrances.
        Crimson leaves fluttered upon the boughs.
        A wintry copse described calligraphic traceries.
        In the cold wind’s more insistent blast
        The oriole’s cry could still be heard.
        In the late sun’s more infrequent warmth
        The cricket’s chirp a while revived.
        At the far south-east end
    Pavilions nestled in artificial mountains.
    On the near north-west side
    Verandahs brooded on circumjacent waters.
    Music of little organs playing in the summer-house
    Increased the melancholy in the air.
    Glimpses of women’s dresses flitting through the little wood
    Enhanced the delicacy of the scene.

Xi-feng was making her way through the garden, admiring the view as she went,
when a figure suddenly stepped out from behind an artificial hill of rock and made its
way towards her:
‘How are you, cousin?’
Xi-feng gave a start of surprise and retreated a step.
‘Isn’t it Cousin Rui?’
‘Don’t you even know who I am, cousin?’
‘It isn’t that I don’t know you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but you did come up rather suddenly
and I wasn’t expecting to see you here.’
‘We must have been fated to meet, cousin,’ said Jia Rui. ‘I had just slipped away
from the party to take a little stroll in these peaceful surroundings. I never expected
to meet my fair cousin here, but lo! So there must be a bond.’
He ogled her as he spoke with a fixed and meaningful stare.
Xi-feng’s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little
game he was playing, and feigning an interest she did not feel, she answered him
with a smile.
‘I can see why Lian is always speaking so highly of you. From seeing you today and
just hearing you speak those few words I can tell at once that you are an intelligent,
good-natured sort of person. At the moment I’m on my way to join my aunts, and I’m
afraid that I can’t stay and talk to you. Perhaps we could meet some other time when
we are both free?’
      ‘I should like to call on you when you are at home,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but I suppose a
young person like your good self is not in a position to receive visitors of the other
sex.’
      Xi-feng feigned a laugh.
      ‘We’re all one family—all one flesh and blood. I don’t see that age comes into it.’
      Jia Rui was secretly delighted by this encouragement.
      ‘I never dreamed today would bring a chance like this my way,’ he thought, and
the goatish eagerness of his expression grew even more repellent.
      ‘You had better hurry back to the party,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If they catch you playing
truant, you will find yourself being sconced!’
      Jia Rui was by now scarcely in command of his own person. Slowly, very slowly
he walked away, frequently turning back to gaze at Xi-feng as he did so. Xi-feng
mischievously pro?voked him by deliberately slowing down the pace of her own
progress through the garden.
     ‘What an odious creature!’ she thought to herself when there was some distance
between them. ‘Appearances certainly are deceptive! Who would have guessed he
was that sort of person? Well, if he is, he had better look out! One of these days I’ll
settle his hash for him; then perhaps he will realize what sort of person he is up
against!’
     Xi-feng had resumed a normal pace and had just skirted the foot of a little hill,
when she saw two or three old serving-women hurrying towards her in a state of
great agitation.
     ‘Oh, Mrs Lian,’ said one of the old women with a smile, when they caught sight
of her, ‘our mistress has been getting into such a state because you didn’t come!
She’s sent us to fetch you.’
    ‘Just like your mistress!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Always in a lather about something or
other!’ and she sauntered on quite un?concernedly, talking to the old woman as she
went.
    ‘How many pieces have they done so far?’
    ‘Eight or nine,’ the old woman replied.
    By this time they had arrived at the rear entrance of the two-storey Celestial
Fragrance Pavilion, where they found Bao-yu playing with a group of maids.
    ‘Mind you don’t make a nuisance of yourself, Bao,’ said Xi-feng.
    ‘Lady Xing and Lady Wang are sitting upstairs watching,’ said one of the maids.
‘You can get up there from this side, madam.’
    Lifting up her skirts, Xi-feng climbed slowly up the stairs. She found You-shi
standing at the top waiting for her.
    ‘You are an affectionate pair!’ said You-shi with a smile. ‘Once the two of you
meet, there’s no separating you. Tomorrow you had better move in with her and set
up house together! Come on, sit down! I’m going to drink a cup of wine with you!’
    Xi-feng asked her two aunts for permission to sit. When she had done so You-shi
held out the playbill and invited her to make a choice.
    ‘It’s not for me to choose when Mother and Aunt Wang are here,’ said Xi-feng.
    ‘Go ahead and choose!’ said Lady Xing. ‘Mrs You and your aunt and I have
already chosen a number of plays. Now you pick out one or two good ones for us!’
    Xi-feng politely rose to thank her, and taking the playbill from You-shi, scanned it
through and picked out two of the items listed: one a scene from The Return of the
Soul and the other ‘Gai-nian Plays His Guitar’ from The Palace of Eternal Youth.
    ‘If they do these two after they have finished singing this scene from Faithful
Bi-lian,’ she said, handing the playbill back to You-shi, ‘I think that will be just about
enough for the day.’
      ‘I’m sure it will,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We ought in any case to break up early, so that
our hosts can get a good night’s rest. They have had a lot on their minds lately.’
      ‘It isn’t often that you both come to see us,’ said You-shi.
      ‘Please stay as long as you can. It will be so much more fun. It’s really quite early
yet.’
‘Where have all the gentlemen gone to?’ inquired Xi-feng, who had got up from her
seat and was peering down into the lower storey.
‘They have gone off to the Frozen Sunlight Gallery to drink,’ said one of the old
women in attendance. ‘They left only a moment ago. They’ve taken the band with
them.’
‘What was wrong with this place?’ said Xi-feng, ‘Heaven knows what they can be
getting up to behind our backs!’
‘We can’t all be as strait-laced as you are,’ said You-shi with a laugh.
As they laughed and chattered together, the actors even?tually finished performing
the second of the two pieces Xi?-feng had selected, whereupon the wine was
removed from the tables and rice served. When they had finished their meal, the
company retired to the main reception room indoors and took tea there, after which
carriages were called for and the other ladies took their leave of old Mrs You. You-shi
stood at the head of all the concubines and female domestics of the Ning household
to see them outside, while Cousin Zhen at the head of the junior male members of
his family stood beside the waiting carriages.
‘You must come again tomorrow, ladies,’ said Cousin Zhen to Lady Xing and Lady
Wang as they emerged from the house.
‘I think not,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We have sat here the whole day being entertained
and we are all rather tired now. I think tomorrow we should like a rest.’
Jia Rui was staring fixedly at Xi-feng throughout this exchange.
After Cousin Zhen had gone indoors again, Li Gui led out a horse and Bao-yu
mounted on its back and rode off behind Lady Wang’s carriage. Cousin Zhen and the
other males then sat down to supper and, when it was over, the party broke up. Next
day there was another day of feasting for the members of the clan, particulars of
which, however, we omit from our record. We shall confine ourselves to observing
that from that day on Xi-feng paid frequent calls on Qin-shi. Sometimes her illness
seemed slightly better for a day or two, sometimes it seemed slightly worse. Cousin
Zhen, You-shi and Jia Rong were acutely worried.

*
Jia Rui made several visits to the Rong mansion, but all his calls seemed to coincide
with Xi-feng’s visits to the Ning mansion to see Qin-shi.
The thirtieth day of the eleventh month, the day of the winter solstice, arrived. It was
the turn of the season, and for several days before it Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang
and Xi-?feng had been sending messengers daily to inquire after Qin shi. Each time
the report they brought back was the same:
‘She hasn’t got any worse these last few days, but she doesn’t seem to be very
much better.’
‘At this time of year,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it’s a hopeful sign if an illness like hers
doesn’t get any worse.’
‘Oh I do hope so!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That sweet child! If anything should
happen to her, it would break my heart.’
A wave of bitterness passed over her.
‘You and she have always been good friends,’ she said turning to Xi-feng.
‘Tomorrow is the “First of the Last”. Go and see her again some time after tomorrow.
Have a very careful look and try to find out exactly how she is. If she seems a bit
better, come and tell me when you get back. And if there is anything the dear child
has ever fancied eating in the past, see that she is kept constantly supplied with it.’
Xi-feng promised to do as she had said, and on the second day of the next month she
went over to the Ning-guo man?sion as soon as she had finished her breakfast.
Qin-shi’s sickness appeared to be no worse than previously, but the flesh on her face
and body was pitifully wasted. Xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her, and once
more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness.
‘We shall know the worst when the spring comes,’ said Qin-shi. ‘At least I’ve got
past the solstice without anything happening, so perhaps I shall get better. Give
Grandma and Auntie Wang my regards, won’t you. I’ve eaten one or two bits of that
yam-cake with the date stuff inside that Grand?ma sent me yesterday. I found it quite
easy to digest.’
‘I’ll send you some more tomorrow,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I must go and see your
mother-in-law, and after that I have to hurry back and give my report on you to
Grandma.’
‘Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my love, Auntie.’
‘I will,’ said Xi-feng, and left her.
She went into You-shi’s reception room and sat down.
‘Tell me honestly,’ said You-shi. ‘What did you think of her?’
Xi-feng sat silent for some time with lowered head.
‘There’s no hope, is there? You’ll have to start getting things ready for the end. Of
course, it’s always possible that doing so may break the bad luck.’
‘I’ve already been quietly making a few preparations on the side,’ said You-shi. ‘The
only thing we haven’t yet got is the right timber {or the you know what. But we’re
looking round all the time.
Xi-feng had some tea and chatted a while longer with You-shi. Then she said:
‘I must hurry back to report to Grandma.’
‘Break it to her gently,’ said You-shi. ‘You don’t want to give her a shock, at her age.’
‘Of course,’ said Xi-feng, and rising to her feet went straight back home and called
on Grandmother Jia.
‘Rong’s wife asked me to give you her regards, Grandma. She sends you a kotow
and she says she feels somewhat better. She begs you not to worry about her. And
she says that when she’s made a bit more progress she’s going to come over to see
you and make you a kotow in person.’
‘How did you think she seemed?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘For the time being there doesn’t seem to be anything much to worry about,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘She seems to be in quite good spirits.’
For a long time the old lady brooded in silence. Then, remembering Xi-feng, she told
her to change her clothes and rest a while.
Xi-feng said yes, she would, and after calling on Lady Wang, went back to her own
apartment, where Patience had warmed her everyday clothes for her to change into.
When she had changed, she sat down and asked Patience if anything had happened
during her absence.
‘Nothing, really,’ said Patience, handing her some tea. ‘Brightie’s wife came with
the interest on the three hundred taels of silver and I received it for you. Oh, and Mr
Rui sent someone to ask if you were in. He wants to pay you a call and talk about
something.’
Xi-feng snorted.
‘Horrible creature! he seems to be looking for trouble. Just let him come, then!’
‘What does Mr Rui want?’ asked Patience. ‘Why does he keep coming like this?’
In reply Xi-feng gave her a full account of her encounter with him in the garden of the
Ning-guo mansion and of the things he had said to her on that occasion,
‘What a nasty, disgusting man!’ said Patience. ‘A case of “the toad on the ground
wanting to eat the goose in the sky”. He’ll come to no good end, getting ideas like
that!’
‘Just wait till he comes! ‘ said Xi-feng. ‘I know how to deal with him.’
But if you wish to know the outcome of Jia Rui’s visit, you will have to read the next
chapter.

CHAPTER 12

Wang Xi-feng sets a trap for her admirer
And Jia Rui looks into the wrong side of the mirror



Jia Rui’s arrival was announced while Xi-feng and Patience were still talking about
him.
     ‘Ask him in,’ said Xi-feng.
     Hearing that he was to be received, Jia Rui rejoiced in?wardly. He came into the
room wreathed in smiles and over?whelmed Xi-feng with civilities. With feigned
solicitude she pressed him to be seated and to take tea. He became quite ecstatic at
the sight of her informal dress.
     ‘Why isn’t Cousin Lian back yet?’ he asked, staring with fascinated eyes.
‘I don’t know what the reason can be,’ said Xi-feng.
     ‘Could it be,’ Jia Rui inquired archly, ‘that Someone has detained him on his way
home and that he can’t tear himself away?’
     ‘Men are all the same!’ said Xi-feng. ‘They have only to set eyes on a woman to
begin another affair.’
     ‘Ah, there you are wrong!’ said Jia Rui. ‘I am not that sort of man.’
     ‘But how many men are there like you?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I doubt you could find one
in ten.’
     At this last remark Jia Rui positively scratched his ears with pleasure.
     ‘You must find it very dull here on your own every day,’ he said.
     ‘Yes, indeed!’ said Xi-feng. ‘If only there were someone who could come and talk
to me and help me to pass the time!’
     ‘Well,’ said Jia Rui, ‘I am always free. How would it be if I were to come every day
to help you pass the time?’
     ‘You must be joking!’ said Xi-feng. ‘What would you want to come here for?’
    ‘I mean every word I say,’ said Jia Rui. ‘May I be struck by lightning if I don’t! True,
there was a time when I should have been scared to come, because people always
told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you; but now
I know that in reality you are all gentleness and fun, there is nothing that could stop
me coming. I would come now if it cost me my life.’
     ‘It’s true then,’ said Xi-feng, smiling delightedly. ‘You really are an understanding
sort of person --- so much more so than Rong or Qiang! I used to think that since they
were such handsome and cultured-looking young men they must be understanding
as well, but they turned out to be stupid brutes without the least consideration for
other people’s feelings.’
    This little speech went straight to Jia Rui’s heart, and un?consciously he began
edging his seat nearer to Xi-feng’s. He peered closely at an embroidered purse that
she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings.
‘Take care!’ said Xi-feng in a low tone. ‘The servants might see you!’
    Obedient to his goddess’s command, Jia Rui quickly drew back again. Xi-feng
laughed.
‘You had better go!’
    ‘Ah no, cruel cousin! Let me stay a little longer!’
    ‘Even if you stay, it’s not very convenient here in broad daylight, with people
coming and going all the time. Go away now and come hack later when it’s dark, at
the beginning of the first watch. You can slip into the gallery west of this apart?ment
and wait for me there.’
    Jia Rui received these words like someone being presented with a rare and costly
jewel.
‘Are you sure you’re not joking ?’he asked hurriedly. ‘A lot of people must go
through that way. How should we avoid being seen?’
     ‘Don’t worry!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll give the watchmen a night off. When the side
gates are closed, no one else can get through.’
     Jia Rui was beside himself with delight and hurriedly took his leave, confident
that the fulfilment of all he wished for was now in sight. Having waited impatiently
for nightfall, he groped his way into the Rong-guo mansion just before they closed
the gates and slipped into the gallery, now totally deserted—as Xi-feng had promised
it would be—and black as pitch.
     The gate at the end of the alley-way opening on to Grand?mother Jia’s quarters
had already been barred on the outer side; only the gate at the east end remained
open. For a long time Jia Rui listened intently, but no one came. Suddenly there was a
loud slam and the gate at the east end, too, banged shut. Alarmed, but not daring to
make a sound, Jia Rui stealthily crept out and tried it. It was locked—as tight as a
bucket. Now even if he wanted to get out he could not, for the walls on either side of
the alley-way were too high to scale. Moreover the gallery was bare and draughty
and this was the midwinter season when the nights are long and the bitter north
wind seems to pierce into the very marrow of the bones. By the end of the night he
was almost dead with cold.
     When at last morning came, Jia Rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old
woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up. Still
hugging himself against the cold, he sprinted out of the other gate while her back
was towards him. Fortunately no one was about at that early hour, and he was able
to slip out of the rear entrance of the mansion and run back home unseen.
     Jia Rui had lost both of his parents in infancy and had been brought up under the
sole guardianship of his grandfather Jia Dai-ru. Obsessed by the fear that once
outside the house his grandson might indulge in drinking and gambling to the
detriment of his studies, Dai-ru had subjected him since early youth to an iron
discipline from which not the slightest deviation was tolerated. Seeing him now
suddenly absent him?self a whole night from home, and being incapable, in his
wildest imaginings, of guessing what had really happened, he took it as a foregone
conclusion that he had been either drink?ing or gaming and had probably passed the
night in some house of prostitution --- a supposition which caused the old gentleman
to spend the whole night in a state of extreme choler.
     The prospect of facing his grandfather on arrival made Jia Rui sweat. A lie of
some sort was indispensable.
     ‘I went to see Uncle yesterday,’ he managed to say, ‘and as it was getting dark, he
asked me to stay the night.’
     ‘I have always told you that you are not to go out of that gate without first
informing me,’ said his grandfather. ‘Why then did you presume to go off on your
own yesterday without saying a word to anybody? That in itself would constitute
sufficient grounds for chastisement. But in addition to that you are lying!’
     Thereupon he, forced him to the ground, and, with the utmost savagery, dealt
him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo, after which he forbade him to eat and
made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared
the equivalent of ten days’ homework.
     The exquisite torments suffered by Jia Rui, as he knelt with an empty stomach in
the draughty courtyard reciting his homework after having already been frozen all
night long and then beaten, can be imagined.
     Yet even now his infatuation remained unaltered. It never entered his mind that
he had been made a fool of. And so two days later, as soon as he had some free time,
he was back once more looking for Xi-feng. She deliberately reproached him for
having failed her, thereby so exasperating him that he swore by the most terrible
oaths that he had been faithful. Seeing him hurl himself so willingly into the net,
Xi-feng decided that a further lesson would be needed to cure him of his folly and
proposed another assignation.
     ‘Only tonight,’ she said, ‘don’t wait for me in that place again. Wait in the empty
room in the little passage-way behind this apartment. But mind you don’t run into
anybody.’
     ‘Do you really mean this?’ said Jia Rui.
     ‘If you don’t believe me, don’t come!’
     ‘I’ll come! I’ll come!’ said Jia Rui. ‘Whatever happens, I shall be there.’
      ‘Now I think you had better go.’
      Confident of seeing her again in the evening, Jia Rui went off uncomplainingly,
leaving Xi-feng time to muster her forces, brief her officers, and prepare the trap in
which the luckless man was to be caught.
      Jia Rui waited for the evening with great impatience. By a stroke of bad luck
some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper. It was already lamplight when
they left, and Jia Rui then had to wait for his grandfather to settle down for the night
before he could scuttle off to the Rong mansion and make his way to the room in the
little passage-way where Xi-feng had told him to go. He waited there for her arrival
with the frenzied agitation of an ant on a hot saucepan. Yet, though he waited and
waited, not a human shape appeared nor a human sound was heard, and he began
to be frightened and a little suspicious:
‘Surely she won’t fail me? Surely I shan’t be made to spend another night in the
cold...?’
As he was in the midst of these gloomy imaginings, a dark figure glided into the room.
Certain that it must be Xi-feng, Jia Rui cast all caution to the winds and, when the
figure approached him, threw himself upon it like a hungry tiger seizing its prey or a
cat pouncing on a harmless mouse.
‘My darling, how I have waited for you!” he exclaimed, enfolding his beloved in his
arms; and carrying her to the kang, he laid her down and began kissing her and
tugging at her trousers, murmuring ‘my sweetest darling’ and ‘my honey love’ and
other such endearments in between kisses. Throughout all of this not a single sound
was uttered by his partner. Jia Rui now tore down his own trousers and prepared to
thrust home his hard and throbbing member. Suddenly a light flashed --- and there
was Jia Qiang holding aloft a candle in a candlestick which he shone around:
‘Who is in this room?’
At this the person on the kang gave a giggle:
‘Uncle Rui is trying to bugger me!’
Horrors! The sight he saw when he looked down made Jia Rui want to sink into the
ground. It was Jia Rong! He turned to bolt, but Jia Qiang held him fast.
‘Oh no you don’t! Auntie Lian has already told Lady Wang that you have been
pestering her. She asked us to keep you here while she went to tell. When Lady Wang
first heard, she was so angry that she fainted, but now she’s come round again and is
asking for you to be brought to her. Come along, then! Off we go!’
At these words Jia Rui’s soul almost left its seat in his body.
‘My dear nephew, just tell her that you didn’t find me here!’ he said. ‘Tomorrow I
will reward you handsomely.’
‘I suppose I could let you go easily enough,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘The question is, how big
would this reward be? In any case, just saying that you will give me a reward is no
good. I should want a written guarantee.’
‘But I can’t put a thing like this down in writing!’
‘No problem there,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Just say that you’ve lost money gambling and
have borrowed such and such an amount to cover your losses. That’s all you need
do.’
‘I could do that, certainly,’ said Jia Rui.
Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a
writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance. Writing at his
dicta?tion Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver
as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once
pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong. But
Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and in?sisted that he would lay
the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done.
Jia Rui became quite frantic and kotowed to him. Finally, under pressure from Jia
Qiang and in return for another IOU for fifty taels of silver made out in his favour, he
allowed his scruples to be overcome.
‘You realize, don’t you,’ said Jia Qiang, ‘that I’m going to get into trouble for this?
Now let’s see. The gate leading to Lady Jia’s courtyard was bolted some time ago, and
Sir Zheng is at the moment in the main reception room looking at some stuff that has
just arrived from Nanking, so you can’t go through that way. The only way left would
be through the back gate. The trouble is, though, that if you leave now, you might
run into someone on the way, and then I should get into even worse trouble. You’d
better let me scout around a bit first and come for you when the coast is clear. In the
meantime you can t hide here, though, because they will shortly be com?ing in to
store the stuff from Nanking here. I’ll find somewhere else for you.’
He took Jia Rui by the arm, and having first blown the candle out, led him into the
courtyard and groped his way round to the underside of the steps which led up to
the terrace of the central building.
‘This hollow under the steps will do. Crouch down there, and don’t make a sound!
You can go when I come for you.
Jia Qiang and Jia Rong then went off leaving him to him?self.
Jia Rui, by now a mere automaton in the hands of his cap?tors, obediently crouched
down beneath the steps and was just beginning a series of calculations respecting his
present financial predicament when a sudden slosh! signalled the dis?charge of a
slop-pail’s stinking contents immediately above his head, drenching him from top to
toe with liquid filth and causing him to cry out in dismay --- but only momentarily, for
the excrement covered his face and head and caused him to close his mouth again in
a hurry and crouch silent and shivering in the icy cold. Just then Jia Qiang came
running up:
     ‘Hurry! hurry! You can go now.’
At the word of command Jia Rui bounded out of his hole and sprinted for dear life
through the rear gate and back to his own home. It was now past midnight, and he
had to shout for someone to let him in. When the servant who answered the gate
saw the state he was in and asked him how it had happened, he had to pretend that
he had been out in the darkness to ease himself and had fallen into the jakes. Then
rushing into his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed, his mind running
all the time on how Xi-feng had tricked him. The thought of her trickery provoked a
surge of hatred in his soul; yet even as he hated her, the vision of her loveliness made
him long to clasp her to his breast. Torn by these violent and con?flicting emotions,
he passed the whole night without a single wink of sleep.
From that time on, though he longed for Xi-feng with un?abated passion, he never
dared to visit the Rong-guo mansion again. Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, on the other hand,
came frequently to his house to ask for their money, so that he was in constant dread
of his grandfather finding out about the IOUs.
Unable, even now, to overcome his longing for Xi-feng, saddled with a heavy burden
of debt, harassed during the day?time by the schoolwork set him by his exacting
grandfather, worn-out during the nights by the excessive hand-pumping inevitable in
an unmarried man of twenty whose mistress was both unattainable and constantly in
his thoughts, twice frozen, tormented and forced to flee --- what constitution could
with?stand so many shocks and strains without succumbing in the end to illness? The
symptoms of Jia Rui’s illness—a palpitation in the heart, a loss of taste in the mouth,
a weakness in the hams, a smarting in the eyes, feverishness by night and lassi?tude
by day, albumen in the urine and blood-flecks in the phlegm—had all manifested
themselves within less than a year. By that time they had produced a complete
breakdown and driven him to his bed, where he lay, with eyes tight shut, babbling
deliriously and inspiring terror in all who saw him. Physicians were called in to treat
him and some bushels of cinnamon bark, autumn root, turtle-shell, black leek and
Solomon’s seal must at one time and another have been in-fused and taken without
the least observable effect.
Winter went and spring came and Jia Rui’s sickness grew even worse. His grandfather
Dai-ru was in despair. Medical advice from every quarter had been taken and none of
it had proved effective. The most recent advice was that the patient should be given
a pure decoction of ginseng without admixture of other ingredients. So costly a
remedy was far beyond Dai?-ru’s resources and he was obliged to go to the Rong-guo
man?sion to beg. Lady Wang ordered Wang Xi-feng to weigh out two ounces for him
from their own supplies.
‘The other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for Grandmother,’ said
Xi-feng, ‘you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you
were sending to General Yang’s wife. I sent her the medicine yesterday, sol am afraid
we haven’t any left.’
‘Well, even if we haven’t got any,’ said Lady Wang, ‘you can send to your
mother-in-law’s for some; and probably they will have some at your Cousin Zhen’s.
Between you you ought somehow or other to be able to raise enough to give him. If
you can save a man’s life by doing so, you will have performed a work of merit.’
But though Xi-feng pretended to do as Lady Wang suggested, in fact she made no
such inquiries. She merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent
them to Dai-ru with a message that ‘Lady Wang had instructed her to send this, and
it was all they had.’ To Lady Wang, however, she reported that she had asked the
others and altogether obtained more than two ounces of ginseng which she had sent
to Dai-ru.
Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swal?lowed every medicine that
they offered him; but all was a waste of money, for nothing seemed to do him any
good. One day a lame Taoist appeared at the door asking for alms and claiming to be
able to cure retributory illnesses. Jia Rui, who chanced to overhear him, called out
from his bed:
‘Quick, tell the holy man to come in and save me!’ and as he called, he kotowed
with his head on the pillow. The servants were obliged to bring the Taoist into the
bedroom. Jia Rui clung to him tenaciously.
‘Holy one, save me!’ he cried out again and again.
The Taoist sighed.
‘No medicine will cure your sickness. However, I have a precious thing here that I
can lend you which, if you will look at it every day, can be guaranteed to save your
life.’
So saying, he took from his satchel a mirror which had reflecting surfaces on both its
sides. The words A MIRROR FOR THE ROMANTIC were inscribed on the back. He
handed it to Jia Rui.
‘This object comes from the Hall of Emptiness in the Land of Illusion. It was
fashioned by the fairy Disenchantment as an antidote to the ill effects of impure
mental activity. It has life-giving and restorative properties and has been brought into
the world for the contemplation of those intelligent and hand?some young
gentlemen whose hearts are too susceptible to the charms of beauty. I lend it to you
on one important condition: you must only look into the back of the mirror. Never,
never under any circumstances look into the front. Three days hence I shall come
again to reclaim it, by which time I guarantee that your illness will have gone.’
With that he left, at a surprising speed, ignoring the earnest entreaties of those
present that he should stay longer.
‘This is intriguing!’ Jia Rui thought to himself when the Taoist gave him the mirror.
‘Let me try looking into it as he says, and holding it up to his face he looked into the
back as instructed and saw a grinning skull, which he covered up hastily with a curse:
‘Silly old fool, to scare me like that! -- But let me see what happens when I look into
the other side!’
He turned the mirror round and looked, and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to
him to enter, and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her. There they
performed the act of love together, after which she saw him out again. But when he
found himself once more back in his bed he stared and cried out in horror: for the
mirror, of its own accord, had turned itself round in his hand and the same grinning
skull faced him that he had seen before. He could feel the sweat trickling all over his
body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated.
Yet still he was not satisfied, and turned the face of the mirror once more towards
him. Xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling, and again he went in after
her. He did this three or four times. But the last time, just as he was going to return
from the mirror, two figures approached him hold?ing iron chains which they
fastened round him and by which they proceeded to drag him away. He cried out as
they dragged him:
‘Wait! Let me take the mirror with me . . .!
Those were the last words he ever uttered.
To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he
appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then
to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from
his grasp, he finally ceased to move.
When they examined him more closely they found that his breathing had already
stopped and that underneath his body there was a large, wet, icy patch of recently
ejaculated semen.
At once they lifted him from the bed and busied themselves with the laying-out,
while old Dai-ru and his wife abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of grief. They
cursed the Taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and
cast the mirror upon the flames. But just at that moment a voice was heard in the air
saying, ‘Who told him to look in the front? It is you who are to blame, for confusing
the unreal with the real! Why then should you burn my mirror?’
Suddenly the mirror was seen to rise up and fly out of the room, and when Dai-ru
went outside to look, there was the lame Taoist asking for it back. He snatched it as it
flew towards him and disappeared before Dai-ru’s very eyes.
Seeing that there was to be no redress, Dai-yu was obliged to set about preparing for
the funeral and began by announc?ing his grandson’s death to everybody concerned.
Reading of the sutras began on the third day and on the seventh the coffin was
drawn in procession to temporary lodging in the Temple of the Iron Threshold to
await future reburial. The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to
offer their condolences. From the Rong-guo side Jia She and Jia Zheng each gave
twenty taels of silver and from the Ning-guo side Cousin Zhen also gave twenty taels.
The other members of the clan gave amounts varying from one to four taels
according to their means. A collection made among the parents of the dead man’s
fellow-students raised an additional twenty or thirty taels. Although Dai-ru’s means
were slender, with so much monetary help coming in he was able to perform the
whole business in considerable style.
*
Towards the end of the year in which Jia Rui’s troubles started Lin Ru-hai fell seriously
ill and wrote a letter asking to see Dai-yu again. Though Grandmother Jia was
plunged into deepest gloom by the letter, she was obliged to prepare with all
possible expedition for her granddaughter’s departure. And Bao-yu, though he too
was distressed at the prospect of Dai-yu’s leaving him, could scarcely seek to
interfere in a matter affecting the natural feelings of a father and his child.
Grandmother Jia insisted that Jia Lian should accompany Dai-yu and see her safely
there and back. The various gifts to be taken and the journey-money were, it goes
without saying, duly prepared. A suitable day on which to commence the journey
was quickly determined and Jia Lian and Dai-yu took leave of all the rest and,
embarking with their attendants, set sail for Yangchow.
If you wish for further details, you may learn them in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 13

Qin-shi posthumously acquires the status
of a Noble Dame
And Xi-feng takes on the management
of a neighbouring establishment



After Jia Lian’s departure for Yangchow Xi-feng felt bored and unhappy, particularly in
the evenings when, apart from chatting with Patience, there seemed little to do but
sleep. On the occasion of which we write she had sat beside the lamp with Patience
until late into the evening; then, the bedding having been well warmed, the two
women had gone to bed, where they lay until after midnight discussing the stages of
Jia Lian’s journey and attempting to calculate what point he was likely to have
reached in it. By this time Patience was fast asleep and Xi-feng herself was on the
point of dropping off when she became dimly aware that Qin-shi had just walked into
the room from outside.
     ‘So fond of sleep, Auntie?’ said Qin-shi with a gentle smile. ‘I shall have to begin
my journey today without you to see me off. But never mind! Since you cannot come
to me, I have come to you instead. We two have always been so close, I could not
have borne to leave you without saying good-bye. Besides, I have a last wish that you
alone must hear, because I cannot trust anyone else with it.’
     ‘What is your wish?’ Xi-feng heard herself asking. ‘You can trust me to carry it
out for you.’
     ‘Tell me, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi, ‘how is it that you who are such a paragon among
women that even strong men find more than their match in you can yet be ignorant
of the simple truths expressed in homely proverbs? Take this one:
The full moon smaller grows,
Full water overflows.

Or this:
The higher the climb, the harder the fall.

Our house has now enjoyed nearly a century of dazzling success. Suppose one day
“joy at its height engenders sorrow”. And suppose that, in the words of another
proverb, “when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter”. Will not our reputation as one of
the great, cultured households of the age then turn into a hollow mockery?’
     Qin-shi’s question made Xi-feng feel uneasy, though at the same time inspiring a
deep respect in her for her niece’s fore?sight.
     ‘You are quite right to show concern,’ she said. ‘Is there any means by which we
can keep permanently out of danger?’
     ‘Now you are being silly, Auntie!’ said Qin-shi somewhat scornfully. ‘“The
extreme of adversity is the beginning of prosperity” --- and the reverse of that saying
is also true. Honour and disgrace follow each other in an unending cycle. No human
power can arrest that cycle and hold it permanently in one position. What you can do,
however, is to plan while we are still prosperous for the kind of heritage that will
stand up to the hard times when they come.
     ‘At the moment everything seems well looked after; but in fact there are still two
matters that have not been properly taken care of. If you will deal with them in the
way that I shall presently suggest, you will be able to face the future without fear of
calamity.’
    ‘What two matters?’ Xi-feng asked her.
    ‘Though the seasonal offerings at the ancestral burial-ground are at present
regularly attended to,’ said Qin-shi, ‘no special income has been set aside to pay for
them. That is the first matter. The second matter concerns the clan school. There
again, there is no fixed source of income. Obviously there will be no lack of funds
either for the seasonal offerings or for the school as long as we enjoy our present
prosperity. But where is the money for them coming from in the future, when the
family has fallen on hard times?
    ‘I am convinced that the only way of dealing with these two matters is to invest
now, while we are still rich and powerful, in as much property as possible—land,
farms, and houses—in the area around the burial-ground, and to pay for the seasonal
offerings and the running of the school entirely out of the income from this property.
Moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it. The whole clan, old and young
alike, should be convened and a set of regulations drawn up whereby each family is
made to administer the estate and look after the financing of the seasonal offerings
and the clan school for one year in turn. By making the responsibility rotate in a fixed
order you will remove the possibility of quarrels about it and also lessen the danger
of the property getting mortgaged or sold.
     ‘Then even if the clan gets into trouble and its possessions are confiscated, this
part of its property, as charitable estate, will escape confiscation; and when the
family’s fortunes are in decline, it will be a place where the young people can go to
farm and study, as well as a means of maintaining the ancestral sacrifices in unbroken
succession. To refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our
present prosperity is going to last for ever would be extremely short-sighted.
     ‘Quite soon a happy event is going to take place in this family, bringing it an even
greater glory than it has enjoyed up to now. But it will be a glory as excessive and as
transitory as a posy of fresh flowers pinned to an embroidered dress or the flare-up
of spilt cooking-oil on a blazing fire. In the midst of that brief moment of happiness
never forget that “even the best party must have an end”. For if you do, and if you fail
to take precautions in good time, you will live to regret it bitterly when it is already
too late.’
     ‘What is this happy event you speak of?’ Xi-feng asked her eagerly.
     ‘That is a secret which may not be revealed to mortal ears. However, for the sake
of our brief friendship on this earth, I leave you these words as my parting gift. Be
sure that you remember them well!

    When the Three Springs have gone, the flowering time will end,
    And each one for himself as best he may must fend.’

Xi-feng was about to ask her another question when she was interrupted by the
sound of the iron chime-bar which hung in the inner gate.
     Four strokes. The signal of death!
     She woke with a start to hear a servant announcing, ‘Mrs Rong of the Ning-guo
mansion is dead.’ A cold sweat broke out over her body and for a while she lay too
stunned to move. Then forcing herself to get up she pulled on her clothes and went
round to Lady Wang’s.
     By this time the entire household had heard the news. All seemed bewildered by
it and all were in one way or another deeply distressed. Those older than Qin-shi
thought of how dutiful she had always been; those in her own generation thought of
her warmth and friendliness; her juniors remem?bered how kindly and lovingly she
had treated them; even the servants, irrespective of sex and age, remembering her
com?passion for the poor and humble and her gentle concern for the old and the
very young, all wept and lamented as loud and bitterly as the rest.
     But we digress.
     During the last few days, since Dai-yu’s return to her father had deprived him of
her companionship, Bao-yu, far from seeking diversion in the company of the others,
had kept to himself, going to bed early every night and sleeping dis?consolately on
his own. The news of Qin-shi’s death came to him in the midst of his dreams, causing
him to start up in bed with a jerk. A sudden stabbing pain shot through his heart. He
retched involuntarily and spat out a mouthful of blood. Aroma and the maids clung
to him, terrified, and asked him what was the matter. They wanted to tell
Grandmother Jia and ask her to send for a doctor; but Bao-yu would not hear of it.
     ‘Don’t worry, it’s of no consequence!’ he told them. ‘Something that happens
when a sudden rush of fire to the heart prevents the blood from getting back into the
right channels.’
     He climbed out of bed as he spoke and told them to bring him some clean
clothes, so that he could see his grandmother and then go straight on to the other
house. Aroma was still concerned for him, but seeing him so determined, allowed
him to have his way.
     Grandmother Jia did not want him to go, either.
     ‘It won’t be clean there,’ she said, ‘with her scarcely yet cold. And besides,
there’s a nasty wind at this time of night. It will be soon enough if you go there first
thing tomorrow.’
     But Bao-yu would not be gainsaid, so she gave instructions for a carriage to be
made ready for him and a numerous retinue of servants to attend him there.
     Arriving in haste at the entrance of the Ning-guo mansion, they found the gates
flung wide open and lanterns on either side turning the night into noonday. Despite
the hour, a multitude of people were hurrying through it in both direc?tions, while
from inside the house issued a sound of lamenta?tion that seemed to shake the very
buildings to their founda?tions.
     Alighting from his carriage, Bao-yu hurried through to the room in which Qin-shi
lay and wept there for a while very bitterly. He then went to call on You-shi, whom he
found ill in bed, struck down by a sudden attack of some gastric trouble from which
she had occasionally suffered in the past. After leaving You-shi, he went to look for
Cousin Zhen.
     By now Jia Dai-ru, Jia Dai-xiu, Jia Chi, Jia Xiao, Jia Dun, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Cong,
Jia Bin, Jia Heng (I), Jia Guang, Jia Chen, Jia Qiong, Jia Lin, Jia Qiang, Jia Chang, Jia Ling,
Jia Yun, Jia Qin, Jia Jin, Jia Ping, Jia Zao, Jia Heng (II), Jia Fen, Jia Fang, Jia Lan, Jia Jun
and Jia Zhi had all arrived, and Bao-yu found Cousin Zhen in their midst addressing
them, though well-nigh choked with tears:
     ‘Everyone, young or old, kinsman or friend, knows that my daughter-in-law was
ten times better than any son. Now that she has been taken from us it’s plain to see
that this senior branch of the family is doomed to extinction!’ and he broke down
once more into incontrollable weeping.
     The men present tried to console him:
     ‘Now that she’s gone, crying isn’t going to bring her back again. The important
thing now is to make your plans for the funeral.’
     ‘Plans? What plans?’ Cousin Zhen cried, somewhat theatrically. ‘Just take
everything I have—everything!’
     As he was speaking Qin Bang-ye and Qin Zhong arrived, and various members of
You-shi’s family, including her two younger sisters. Cousin Zhen deputed Jia Qiong, Jia
Chen, Jia Lin and Jia Qiang from among the younger men present to look after them
and any other guests who might arrive.
     He also instructed someone to invite an expert from the Board of Astronomy to
select dates for the funeral and the ceremonies preceding it. With the approval of
this official it was decided that the lying in state should be for forty-nine days and
that the notification of bereavement indicating the family’s readiness to receive
official visits of condolence should be made in three days’ time. A hundred and eight
Buddhist monks were engaged to perform a Grand Miseri?cordia for the salvation of
all departed souls in the main reception hall of the mansion during these forty-nine
days, while at the same time ninety-nine Taoist priests of the Quan?zhen sect were
to perform ceremonies of purification and absolution at a separate altar in the
Celestial Fragrance pavilion. These arrangements having been made, the body was
moved to a temporary shrine in another pavilion of the All-scents Garden. Fifty
high-ranking Buddhist monks and fifty high-ranking Taoist priests took turns in
chanting and intoning before it on every seventh day.
    Nothing would induce old Jia Jing to return home when he learned of the death
of his grandson’s wife. Immortality was within his grasp and he was not going to
impair his hard-won sanctity with the taint of earthly pollution. Accordingly he left all
these matters to Cousin Zhen to order as he wished.
    Free to indulge his own extravagant tastes, Cousin Zhen had inspected several
sets of deal coffin-boards without finding any to his liking. Xue Pan heard of his
problem when he came round to condole.
    ‘We’ve got a set in our timber-yard,’ he told Cousin Zhen. ‘It’s in a wood
supposed to have come from the Iron Net Mountains. They say that a coffin made
from it will last forever without rotting. It was brought here years ago by my father.
Prince Zhong-yi was going to have it, but when he came unstuck it didn’t get used.
It’s still locked up in store because no one has ever been found who could afford to
buy it. If you are interested, I can have it carried round for you to look at.’
      Cousin Zhen was delighted, and the timber was brought over at once for
everyone to inspect. The planks for the base and sides were at least eight inches thick.
The wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and
sandalwood. When rapped with the knuckles it gave off a hard, ringing sound like
jade or stone. Everyone was impressed and Cousin Zhen eagerly inquired the price.
Xue Pan laughed.
      ‘I doubt you could buy a set like this for a thousand taels of silver cash down,’ he
said. ‘Blow the price! Give the workmen a couple of taels for carrying it here and it’s
yours.’
      Cousin Zhen thanked him profusely and at once gave orders for the planks to be
sawn up and made into a coffin. Jia Zheng doubted the propriety of using such
material for the burial of a person not of royal blood and insisted that it would be
sufficient to use the best quality deal; but Cousin Zhen refused to listen.
      News was suddenly brought that Qin-shi’s little maid Gem, on hearing that her
mistress was dead, had taken her own life by dashing her head against a pillar. Such
rare devotion excited the wondering admiration of the entire clan. Cousin Zhen at
once had her laid out and encoffined with the rites appropriate to a granddaughter
and ordered her coffin to be placed in the Ascension Pavilion of the All-scents Garden
side by side with Qin-shi’s.
      As Qin-shi had died without issue, another of her little maids called Jewel
volunteered to stand in as her daughter and perform the chief mourner’s duties of
smashing the bowl when the bearers came in to take up the coffin and walking in
front of it in the funeral procession. Cousin Zhen was very pleased and gave orders
that thenceforth everyone was to address her as ‘Miss Jewel’ just as if she were
Qin-shi’s real daughter. In the meantime she installed herself by the coffin and,
comporting herself in the manner prescribed for an unmarried daughter, wept and
wailed until she had almost lost her voice.
     Following these preliminaries, the rest of the clan together with the family
servants all proceeded to carry out their mourning duties according to
long-established precedents and in a correct and orderly manner. The family’s
respect for tradition was, however, a source of great unease to Cousin Zhen when he
reflected on Jia Rong’s status: for Jia Rong was only an Imperial College Student --- an
absurdly insignificant title to write on a funeral banner; and the insignia to which
Qin-shi was entitled would make a very poor showing when borne in the funeral
procession.
      By a stroke of luck the fourth day of the first seven-day period—the day on which
official condolences were scheduled to begin --- brought a visit from Dai Quan, the
Eunuch Cham?berlain of the Da-ming Palace. Having sent his representative along
well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit, he presently arrived himself,
seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the
streets before him, to present his offerings in person. Cousin Zhen at once made up
his mind to take advantage of the visit.
      As soon as Dai Quan had made his offering, Cousin Zhen ushered him into the
Honey Bee Gallery, invited him to be seated, and served him with tea. Then, entering
into conversa?tion with his guest, he quickly found occasion to mention the fact that
he was thinking of purchasing a place for his son Jia Rong. The eunuch guessed what
was in his mind, and laughingly inquired whether it was not with a view to adding a
little pomp to the funeral that he had conceived this notion.
      ‘My dear Chamberlain,’ Cousin Zhen readily agreed, you have hit the nail on the
head!’
      ‘Well, by a lucky coincidence,’ said Dai Quan, ‘there is rather a good place going
at this very moment. The Corps of Officers of the Imperial Guard, which has an
establishment of three hundred, has got two vacancies in it. Yesterday Lord
Xiang-yang’s younger brother “Sannikins” begged me for one of them and sent
fifteen hundred taels of silver round to my house to pay for it. He and I have always
been good friends, as you know, and in any case I felt I had to do some?thing, for his
Grandpa’s sake; so I couldn’t very well refuse. “Piggy” Feng, the Military Governor of
Yong-xing, has asked me if he can buy the remaining place for his son, but I haven’t
yet had time to give him a reply. If our young friend here wants it, why not jot down
his particulars and I’ll see what I can do.’
     Cousin Zhen at once ordered someone to write out Jia Rong’s name, age and
lineage on a sheet of red paper. The following description was hurriedly prepared and
handed to Dai Quan for his inspection:

Name: JIA RONG
Place of Origin: (County) Kiangning; (Prefecture) Ying-tian-fu; (Province) Kiangnan.
Status: Imperial College Student
Age:      20
Great-grandfather: General Jia Dai-hua, C.-in-C. Metropolitan Barracks, hereditary
noble of the first rank.
Grandfather:Jia Jing, Palace Graduate of the year 17—.
Father: Hon. Colonel Jia Zhen, third rank (hereditary).
After glancing through it quickly, Dai Quan handed it into the keeping of a young
eunuch secretary at his side.
     ‘When we get back,’ he said to the latter, ‘give this to old Zhao, the President of
the Board of Revenue, with my compli?ments, and ask him if he would kindly make
out a commission for a captain in the Imperial Guard, fifth rank, and also the papers
to go with it with these particulars filled in. Tell him I’ll call round tomorrow to pay in
the money.’
The young eunuch bowed, and Dai Quan rose to go. Seeing that he could no longer
detain him, Cousin Zhen showed him out as far as the main gate. As the eunuch was
getting into his palanquin, Cousin Zhen asked him whether he should take the money
to the Ministry or bring it round to Dai Quan’s own house.
‘Better bring a thousand taels, standard weight, to my house. If you go to the
Ministry, they’re sure to fleece you.’
Cousin Zhen thanked him warmly.
‘When the period of mourning is over,’ he said, ‘I shall bring the young fellow round
to your house to kotow his thanks.’
With that they parted. But no sooner had the eunuch gone than the sound of criers
was once more heard in the street, this time heralding the arrival of the Marchioness
of Zhong?jing, wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, with her little niece Shi
Xing-yun. Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Wang Xi-feng received them in Cousin Zhen’s
drawing-room.
Offerings from the Marquises of Jin-xiang and Chuan-ning and the Earl of Shou-shan
were now on display, and those three gentlemen were shortly to be observed
alighting from their palanquins outside. Cousin Zhen went out to meet them and
conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall.
     From then on there was a continuous stream of arrivals, and throughout the
whole forty-nine-day period the street in front of the Ning-guo mansion was
thronged with family mourners in white and mandarins in their’ colourful robes of
office, milling in and out and to and fro all day long.
     The day after Dai Quan’s visit Cousin Zhen made Jia Rong change out of
mourning into a court dress and go to collect his commission. The furnishings and
insignia in the shrine were all rearranged in a manner befitting a person of the fifth
rank. The wording on the spirit tablet which stood on the table of offerings at the
foot of the coffin now read.

Spirit tablet of the Lady Qin-shi of the Jia family
Gentlewoman of the Fifth Rank by Imperial Patent
The gate of the All-scents Garden opening on to the street was thrown wide open
and booths for musicians were erected on either side of it, in which black-coated
funeral bands played at fixed times throughout the day. To either side of them were
displayed the insignia of rank: glittering rows of axes and halberds arranged in
wooden stands. At each side of the gateway vermilion-painted boards inscribed in
large golden characters boldly announced the status of the bereaved:

Honorary Captain of the Imperial Bodyguard
Inner Palace, Northern Capital Division

Inside the gateway, facing the street, a high staging was con?structed on which
Buddhist monks and Taoist priests sat on opposite sides of an altar intoning their
sacred texts. In front of the staging was a notice on which was written in large
characters:



FUNERAL OBSEQUIES

OF

THE LADY QIN-SHI

Senior great-great-granddaughter-in-law of
Jia Yan, Hereditary Duke of Ning-guo, and
wife of the Right Honourable Jia Rong, Captain
in the Imperial Bodyguard, Inner Palace:

                   WHEREAS
                             in this favoured Country, situate in the centre-
                             most part of the four continents of the earth,
                               on which it has pleased Heaven to bestow the
                               blessings of everlasting prosperity and peace,

WE,
the Very Reverend Wan-xu, Co-President of
the Board of Commissioners having author?ity
over all monks and clergy of the Incorporeal,
EverAranquil Church of the Lord Buddha,

and
the Venerable Ye-sheng, Co-President of the
Board of Commissioners having authority
over all priests and practitioners of the Primordial,
All-unifying Church of the Heavenly Tao,

HAVE,
with all due reverence and care, prepared
offices for the salvation of all departed
souls, supplicating Heaven and calling upon
the Name of the Lord Buddha.

NOW,
earnestly praying and beseeching the Eight?een
Guardians of the Sangha, the Warlike
Guardians of the Law, and the Twelve
Guardians of the Months mercifully to extend
their holy compassion towards us, but
terribly to blaze forth in divine majesty
against the powers of evil, we do solemnly
perform for nine and forty days the Great
Mass for the purification, deliverance and
salvation of all souls on land and on sea...


—and a great deal more on those lines which it would be tedious to repeat.



*
Although Cousin Zhen now had every reason to feel satisfied with his arrangements,
there was still one matter which caused him uneasiness. You-shi’s unfortunate illness
meant that she was unable to discharge any of her social obligations, and he was
mortally afraid that with so many great ladies coming to the house on visits of
condolence, some breach of etiquette might occur which would cause the family to
look ridiculous.
Bao-yu once chanced to be sitting next to him when his mind was dwelling on this
problem, and observing the gloomy and preoccupied expression on his cousin’s face,
asked him why he should still be worried now that everything had been so excellently
taken care of. Cousin Zhen explained that it was the present lack of a responsible
female head of household which was the cause of his concern.
    ‘That’s no problem!’ said Bao-yu encouragingly. ‘I know just the person for this.
Put her in temporary control here for a month, and I guarantee that you will have
nothing further to worry about.’
    ‘Who?’ inquired Cousin Zhen eagerly.
    Bao-yu deemed it imprudent to mention her name out loud in the hearing of so
many friends and relations, so leaning across he whispered it in Cousin Zhen’s ear.
Cousin Zhen’s reaction was ecstatic.
‘Yes, absolutely the right person!’ he cried. ‘Let’s see about it straight away!’
     And seizing Bao-yu by the hand, he excused himself to the company and hurried
round to the reception room in his own apartment.
It so happened that this day was not one of the seven on which masses were said, so
visitors from outside the family were fairly few. In the inner apartments there was
only a hand?ful of lady visitors, all of them close connections of the Jia family, whom
Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and various female members of the clan were
keeping company. When a servant announced ‘The Master is here’, all these females
jumped up with little shrieks of alarm and rushed off to hide themselves—all, that is,
except Xi-feng, who rose slowly to her feet and imperturbably stood her ground.
Cousin Zhen had of late been feeling far from well. The debility his sickness caused
him had been further aggravated by excessive grief and obliged him to support
himself with a staff. Lady Xig was concerned to see the pitiflil figure he presented as
he entered the room.
‘You are not well,’ she said, ‘and you have been doing too much now for days. You
ought to be getting some rest. What do you want to come in here for?’
Clutching his staff in his hand, Cousin Zhen struggled down on to his knees, and
having made his duty to his aunts, began thanking them for all their trouble. Lady
Xing hurriedly ordered Bao-yu to raise him up and commanded a chair to be moved
forward for him to sit on. But Cousin Zhen refused to be seated.
‘I have come to ask you three ladies a favour,’ he said, forcing his woebegone
features into a smile.
    ‘What is it you want?’ Lady Xing asked him.
    ‘As you doubtless know,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘my wife has been ill in bed ever since
our daughter-in-law’s death, and with no one to run her side of the household it has
been getting into a pretty deplorable state. I should like to ask Cousin Feng if she
could possibly see her way to running things here for us during the coming month. It
would be a great relief to me if she could.’
      ‘So that’s what you want!’ said Lady Xing with a smile. ‘Feng is now part of your
Aunt Wang’s establishment. You’d better talk to her about it.’
        ‘She’s only a child yet; you know,’ Lady Wang put in hastily. ‘What experience
has she ever had of this kind of thing? Suppose she proved not quite up to the task.
We should all be made to look ridiculous. I think you had better trouble someone
else.’
      ‘I can easily guess what is in your mind, Aunt,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘You are afraid
we should overwork her. For I assure you there is no question of her not being a good
enough manager. Even in her childhood games, Cousin Feng had the decisiveness of a
little general, and since she’s married and had some experience of running things
next door, she is a thoroughly seasoned campaigner. I’ve thought the matter over
carefully these past few days and am quite convinced that apart from Cousin Feng
there really isn’t anyone else I can ask. If you won’t let her do this for my sake or my
wife’s sake, at least won’t you let her for the sake of the one who has just died?’
And at this point he burst into tears.
Lady Wang’s only concern had been lest Xi-feng, who had had no experience of
large-scale funerals, might find the task too big for her and perhaps end up by
making a fool of herself. But Cousin Zhen’s moving plea caused her attitude to soften
considerably and she eyed Xi-feng thoughtfully as though struggling to make up her
mind. Xi-feng for her part had always loved managing things and enjoyed showing off
her ability to do so. When Cousin Zhen first made his request, her mind had at once
consented; and now, observing that Lady Wang appeared to be already half
persuaded, she hastened to complete the process.
‘Cousin Zhen has spoken su eloquently. Oughtn’t we per?haps to agree, Aunt?’
‘Do you think you can do it?’ Lady Wang asked her in a low aside.
‘I don’t see why not,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Cousin Zhen has already seen to all the outside
arrangements himself. It’s only a question of looking after the domestic side for a bit.
And even if there is anything I don’t know about, I can always ask you.’
This seemed reasonable enough to Lady Wang, so she said nothing. Seeing that
Xi-feng herself appeared to be willing, Cousin Zhen turned to her with a smile.
‘Actually there isn’t so very much to do,’ he said. ‘You really must let us persuade
you to take this on. Let me make you a reverence now, to show my gratitude. Then,
when this is all over, I shall come round to your place to thank you properly.’
So saying, he clasped his hands before him and made her a formal bow. Xi-feng
hurriedly curtseyed back.
Cousin Zhen now ordered someone to fetch the tallies for the entire Ning-guo
household and instructed Bao-yu to hand them to Xi-feng.
‘I want you to manage things whatever way you like,’ he told her. ‘Anything you
want you can get by using one of these. There is no need to ask me for it. I have only
two requests to make of you. First that you should dismiss from your mind any idea
of trying to save me any money. The important thing is to put on a good show: the
expense doesn’t matter. And secondly that you should treat our people here exactly
as you treat the members of your own household. Don’t be afraid of upsetting them.
Provided that you will observe those conditions, I leave everything in your hands
with the utmost confidence.’
Xi-feng watched Lady Wang, not daring to accept the tallies without her approval.
‘You hear what your cousin says,’ said Lady Wang. ‘You bad better do as he asks.
Only do not take too much upon yourself. If there are any decisions to make, be sure
to ask Cousin Zhen or his wife first.’
Bao-yu had already received the tallies from Cousin Zhen and now thrust them at
Xi-feng. For politeness’ sake she feigned a certain amount of reluctance, but was
soon prevailed upon to accept them.
‘Will you stay here with us,’ Cousin Zhen asked her, ‘or will you be coming over
every day from the other house? If you intend to come over from the other house
every day, it will greatly add to your burdens. We have an apartment here with its
own courtyard which we can very quickly place at your disposal. If you would care to
move in for the next week or two, I am sure we could make you comfortable.’
‘Thank you, but it won’t be necessary,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I am needed at
the other house too, so it will be best if I come here every day.’
Having accomplished his mission, Cousin Zhen stayed chatting a little longer and then
left. Presently, when the visiting ladies had dispersed, Lady Wang asked Xi-feng what
her plans were for the rest of the day.
‘Please go on without me, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Before I go back myself I must first
try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail.’
Lady Wang accordingly left without more delay in the company of Lady Xing, and the
two ladies returned to the Rong-guo mansion, where we must now leave them.
Alone at last, Xi-feng wandered into a sort of penthouse building where she sat down
and tried to formulate the task that lay ahead. Five major abuses, long habitual in the
Ning-guo establishment, presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need
of attention, viz:
1.Because it was so large and so motley an establishment, things were always getting
lost.
2.Because there was no rational division of labour, it always seemed to be someone
else’s responsibility whenever a job needed to be done.
      3.Because the household’s expenditure was so lavish, money was always getting
misappropriated or misspent.
        4.Because no distinctions were made between one job and another, the
rewards and hardships were unfairly distributed,
5.Because the servants were so arrogant and undisciplined, those with face’ could
brook no restraint and those without could win no advancement.
If you want to know how Xi-feng dealt with these abuses, you will have to read the
chapter which follows.

CHAPTER 14

Lin Ru-hai is conveyed to his last
resting-place in Soochow
And Jia Bao-yu is presented to the Prince of
Bei-jing at a roadside halt

When Lai Sheng, the Chief Steward of the Ning-guo mansion, learned that Xi-feng
had been invited to take on the manage?ment of the household, he called his cronies
together and addressed them in the following terms:
‘Well lads, it seems that they’ve called in Mrs Lian from the other house to run
things here for a bit; so if she should happen to come round asking for anything or
have occasion to talk to you about anything, be sure to do what she says, won’t you?
During this coming month we shall all have to start work a bit earlier and knock off a
bit later than usual. If you’ll put up with a little extra hardship just for this month, we
can make up for it by taking things easy when it’s over. Anyway, I’m relying on you
not to let me down. She’s well known for a sour-faced, hard-hearted bitch is this one,
and once she’s got her back up, she’ll give no quarter, no matter who you are. So be
careful!’
There was a chorus of agreement from the rest. One of them did observe,
half-jokingly, that ‘by rights they could do with someone like her to straighten things
up a bit, consider?ing the state they had got into’. But just at that moment Brightie’s
wife arrived on a mission from Xi-feng. She was to take receipt of some ledger-paper,
buckram, and book-labels, and had a tally in her hand and a slip of paper specifying
the quantities required. The men pressed round her offering her a place to sit and a
cup of tea to drink while one of them hurried off with the list to fetch the needed
items. Not only that, but, having fetched them, he carried them for her all the way to
the inner gate of the mansion, only handing them to her then so that she could take
them in to Xi-feng by herself. Xi-feng at once ordered Sunshine to make them up into
stout workbooks for use in the office. At the same time she sent for Lai Sheng’s wife
and asked her for the register of the household staff. She also told her to get in touch
with all the married females on the staff and arrange for them to assemble first thing
next morning to be told their new duties. Then, after roughly checking through the
numbers in the ‘establishment’ sheet and questioning Lai Sheng’s wife on a few
points, she got into her carriage and drove back home.
At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion. By this time all
the married women on the staff had been assembled. Not daring to go in, they hung
about outside the window listening to Xi-feng discussing work-plans with Lai Sheng’s
wife inside the office. ‘Now that I’m in charge here’, they heard her telling the latter,
‘I won’t promise to make myself agreeable. I haven’t got a sweet temper like your
mistress, you know. You won’t find me letting you do everything just as it suits you.
So don’t let me hear anyone saying "We don’t do it that way here"! From now on,
whatever it is, you do it the way I tell you to, and anyone who departs by as much as
a hair’s breadth from what I say is for it good and proper, no matter how senior or
how important she thinks she is!’
Having delivered herself of this formidable preliminary she ordered Sunshine to call
the roll. One by one the women stepped into the office to be looked at. When she
had looked at them all, Xi-feng proceeded to make her dispositions.
‘This twenty here. I want you to divide yourselves into two shifts of ten. Your job
every day will be to look after lady visitors and serve them tea. That’s all you have to
do. Nothing else.
‘This twenty here. I want you divided into two shifts like the others. Your job will be
serving tea and meals to the family. Nothing else.
‘These forty. Again, two shifts. Your job is to look after the shrine: lighting fresh
joss-sticks, keeping the lamps in oil, changing the drapes. You will also take turns by
the spirit tablet, making offerings of rice and tea, kotowing when the visitors kotow,
wailing when they wail. That is your job and nothing else besides.
‘You four are to look after the cups and plates and so forth in the ladies’ tea-room.
If anything is missing, you share the responsibility between you and a quarter of the
cost will be stopped out of each of your wages.
‘You four here are to look after the dinner-ware: bowls, wine-cups and the like.
Anything missing will be stopped out of your wages.
‘This eight here. I want you to take charge of all funeral offerings sent in from
outside.
‘This eight. I want you to look after oil, candles, and paper-offerings. I’m going to
put the whole lot in your charge; then whenever any is needed somewhere, you
must go to wherever it is and supply them with whatever amount I tell you to.
‘This twenty here. I want you doing night duty by rota. You are to see that all the
gates are locked and keep a look-out for fires. You’ll also be responsible for keeping
the outside properly swept.
‘The rest of you are to be divided up between the different apartments. Each of you
will be responsible for the things in your own apartment, from furniture and antique
ware down to spittoons and dusters. If the tiniest sliver gets lost or broken, you will
be held responsible and will be expected to make it good.
‘Lai Sheng’s wife will make a general inspection every day, and if she catches
anyone idling or gambling or drinking or fighting or being difficult, she will at once
bring them to me for dealing with. And there will be no favouritism. If I find you’ve
done something wrong, I shan’t care whether you’ve been in service here for three
or four generations, it will make no difference to me.
‘Well, now you all know the rules. From now on whenever any trouble occurs I shall
know exactly who to hold respon?sible.
‘Those who are used to working with me at the other place always have a watch
handy, and everything they do, no matter how small a thing it is, is done at a fixed
time. You may not have watches, but at least there is a clock in your master’s
drawing-room you can look at. So here are the main times to remember. At half past
six I shall come over to hear the roll?call. At ten o’clock I take my lunch. I shall see
people with reports to make or tallies to collect up to, but not after, eleven o’clock. At
seven in the evening, as soon as the paper-offerings have been burnt, I shall make a
personal tour of inspection; and when I get back from it, I shall issue those on night
duty with their keys. Then next day I shall be back here again at half past six.
‘I dare say we are all going to be a bit overworked during the days ahead, but I am
sure your master will want to reward you all for your trouble when this is over.’
Xi-feng now proceeded to supervise the distribution of supplies of tea, oil, candles,
feather-dusters, and brooms to some of her work-parties, and to issue others with
table?cloths, chair-covers, cushions, mats, spittoons, footstools, and other
furnishings, an entry of the amount supplied being made in the book as each
consignment was handed over.
A clear record now existed of what individuals were in charge of which parts of the
household, what items they were responsible for, and what duties they were
expected to per?form. Gone now were the days when everyone picked the easiest
tasks to do first and the less popular ones never got carried out; gone the convenient
disorder in which objects had so easily strayed (no one ever knew how) from the
rooms where they belonged. Even with the greatly increased coming and going
occasioned by the bereavement, it was quieter now than it had been before, when
muddle and confusion still pre?vailed. And the old idling and pilfering appeared to
have been eradicated completely. Secure in her authority, respected and obeyed by
all, Xi-feng might be forgiven for contemplating her achievement with a certain
amount of satisfaction.
Meanwhile You-shi was still unwell and Cousin Zhen too crushed by his somewhat
disproportionate grief to think much about eating and drinking. Xi-feng accordingly
had all sorts of invalid slops for You-shi and tempting little delicacies for Cousin Zhen
prepared in the kitchens of the Rong-guo man?sion and sent over each day to the
prostrate couple. Cousin Zhen reciprocated by instructing his own cooks to prepare
dishes of the very highest quality exclusively for Xi-feng and having them carried
round to her in her little penthouse office.
Xi-feng seemed quite tireless in the discharge of her extra duties. Every morning she
would be over at the appointed the rollcall and would sit there alone in her office,
never once emerging to mix with the young Ning-guo women of her own generation.
Even when lady visitors arrived she remained in the office and took no part in their
reception.
The Thirty-fifth had now arrived—an important day in the penitential cycle of seven
times seven days preceding the funeral—and the monks in the main hall had reached
a particularly dramatic part of their ceremonies. Having opened up a way for the
imprisoned souls, the chief celebrant had succeeded by means of spells and
incantations in breaking open the gates of hell. He had shone his light (a little
hand-mirror) for the souls in darkness. He had confronted Yama, the Judge of the
Dead. He had seized the demon torturers who resisted his progress. He had invoked
Ksitigarbha, the Saviour King, to aid him. He had raised up a golden bridge, and now,
by means of a little flag which he held aloft in one hand, was con?ducting over it
those souls from the very deepest pit of hell who still remained undelivered.
Meanwhile the ninety-nine Taoists in the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion were on their
knees offering up a written petition to the Three Pure Ones and calling on the Jade
Emperor himself in his heavenly palace. Outside, on their high staging, with swinging
of censers and scattering of little cakes for the hungry ghosts to feed on, Zen monks
were performing the great Water Penitential. And in the shrine where the coffin
stood, six young monks and six young nuns, magnificently attired in scarlet slippers
and embroidered copes, sat before the spirit tablet quietly murmuring the dharani
that would assist the soul of the dead woman on the most difficult part of its journey
into the underworld. Everywhere there was a hum of activity.
Knowing that the day would be a busy one bringing a greater than usual number of
visitors, Xi-feng had risen at four o’clock in the morning to begin her toilet. By the
time she had completed it, paid her daily tribute to nature, washed her hands, drunk
a few mouthfuls of milk, and rinsed out her mouth, it was already half past six and
Brightie’s wife, at the head of the other female domestics, had been waiting for some
considerable time in the courtyard outside. At last she emerged and stepped into the
waiting carriage. Two horn lanterns inscribed in large characters with the words

RONG-GUO HOUSE

were borne before her as she went.
     The great gate of the Ning-guo mansion was hung with lanterns and there were
rows of identical standard lanterns on each side of the gateway illuminating the
entrance with the brightness of noonday and eerily emphasizing the whiteness of the
mourning-clothes worn by the menservants lined up to receive the carriage. At their
invitation it was drawn in through the centremost of the three gates. Then the
men-servants retired and Xi-feng’s own women hurried forward and raised the
curtain of the carriage for her to descend. She did so, leaning on the shoulder of her
maid Felicity, and the two women with the lanterns led her in, lighting the way for
her as they went, while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the
Ning-guo household advanced to meet her, curtseyed, and chorused their morning
greetings. Xi-feng walked slowly through the All-scents Garden until she came to the
shrine in the Ascension Pavilion. As soon as she caught sight of the coffin the tears,
like pearls from a broken necklace, rolled in great drops down her cheeks. A number
of pages were standing stiffly in the courtyard outside awaiting the command to set
fire to the paper offerings. Xi-feng gave orders for them to begin and for tea to be
offered up inside the shrine. At once there was a clash of cymbals followed by the
mournful strains of a funeral band. An arm?chair had already been called for and set
down facing the spirit tablet. In this Xi-feng now sat, and raising her voice to a shrill
pitch, wept with abandon, whereupon the entire house?hold, high and low, male and
female, indoors and out, res?ponded by breaking into loud and prolonged
lamentation.
Presently a representative of Cousin Zhen and You-shi arrived and begged Xi-feng to
desist. Brightie’s wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with, and
when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more took
leave of various members of the clan who were present, and went off to her office in
the penthouse.
An inspection of the roster showed that all the members of her work-parties were
present except for one woman belong?ing to the group responsible for the reception
of friends of the family. Someone was sent to fetch her, and presently the woman
arrived, flustered and fearful.
‘So it is you!’ said Xi-feng with a chilling smile. I suppose you thought that because
you have a somewhat more lady-like job than the rest, you could afford to disobey
my orders!’
‘Oh no, madam, indeed not!’ said the woman. ‘I’ve been coming extra early every
day. It’s only today, because I overslept, that I’m a bit late. Please let me off this once,
madam! It really is the first time.’
Just at that moment Xi-feng observed Wang Xing’s wife from the Rong-guo mansion,
peeping round the door as if looking for a chance to speak to her.
‘Yes, what is it?’ she asked, turning away from the offender but giving her no
indication that she might go.
Wang Xing’s wife approached and said that she wanted a tally authorizing the
purchase of silk cord to be made up into carriage trimmings for the funeral. She
handed Xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written. It specified the
number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans, four
small sedans, and four carriages, and the number of pounds of silk cord that would
be required for that amount of network. Xi-feng made Sunshine read it out to her,
and having satisfied herself that the figures were correct, told him to enter them in
his book and to issue Wang Xing’s wife with one of the Rong-guo tallies, whereupon
the latter hurried off to complete her mission.
Xi-feng was about to address the latecomer when four more servants from the
Rong-guo mansion came in asking for tallies. She told them to hand over the
order-slips and made Sunshine read them out to her. Two of them contained errors,
and Xi-feng flung them down and told the bearers to ‘go away and come back when
they had got their figures right’. The two of them went off crestfallen.
     Xi-feng next observed Zhang Cai’s wife hovering about at the edge of the room
and asked her what she wanted.
‘It’s those carriage curtains, ma’am. We want the money for the tailor who made
them up.’ Xi-feng took the bill and told Sunshine to enter the figures from it in his
book. But she would not authorize Zhang Cai’s wife to pay for the tailoring until
Wang Xing’s wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer’s receipt.
There was a second piece of paper which Sunshine now read, requesting permission
to purchase paper for the windows of Bao-yu’s outer study, which had just been
redecorated. This too Xi-feng kept, and made Sunshine enter the amount in his book.
She told Zhang Cai’s wife that the goods must be supplied first before any payment
could be authorized.
‘Tomorrow another one will be late and the day after that it will be someone else,’
said Xi-feng turning to the still waiting offender, ‘and before we know where we are
we shall have no one turning up at all. I should have liked to let you off, but if I’m
lenient with you the first time, it will be that much harder for me to deal with
someone else the second time; so I am obliged to make an example of you.’ Her face
hardened as she pronounced sentence: ‘Take her out and give her twenty strokes of
the bamboo!’
Seeing that Xi-feng was really angry, the servants dared not show themselves slack in
executing her command. The wretched woman was half-dragged from the room and
the flogging administered in full view of the waiting throng, after which they came in
again, the executioners to report that they had discharged their duty and their victim
to thank Xi-feng for her punishment. Xi-feng threw down one of the Ning-guo tallies.
‘Take this to Lai Sheng and tell him to stop a month’s pay from her wages. If anyone
is late tomorrow they will get forty strokes and the day after that it will be sixty. So if
you enjoy being beaten you have only to come late for roll-call. Dismiss.’
The servants, including the shamefaced and silently weeping victim, trooped off to
their various duties.
Now began a steady stream of servants from both house?holds collecting and
returning tallies, each of whom Xi-feng attended to in a brisk and efficient manner.
From that day onwards the staff of the Ning-guo mansion realized just how
formidable Xi-feng could be and went about their duties in fear and trembling, not
daring to idle or delay.

*

    But let us now turn to Bao-yu. On this particular occasion, fearing that with so
great an influx of visitors Qin Zhong might find himself somewhat overwhelmed,
Bao-yu brought him round to Xi-feng’s office for a quiet chat.
‘Did you smell the food?’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. (She was halfway through her
lunch when they entered.) ‘Come up on the kang and have some!’
‘Thank you, but we have already eaten,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Here, or in the other house?’
‘Catch me eating here with those clowns!’ said Bao-yu. ‘No, back at home, with
Grandmother.’
He and Qin Zhong sat down, and presently Xi-feng finished her lunch. Just then a
woman came in asking for a tally with which to obtain a fresh supply of oil for the
altar lamps.
‘I calculated that you would be needing some by now,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I
thought you must have forgotten. If you had forgotten, you’d have had to pay for it
yourself. That would have suited me down to the ground!’
‘Oh no, madam! As you say, I just forgot. I only thought of it a moment ago, and I
realized that if I didn’t hurry I should be too late to get a tally.’
So saying, she took her tally and went. For a short while longer the handing over of
tallies and registering of amounts continued.
‘Both your houses use these tallies for everything,’ said Qin Zhong, who had been
watching these transactions with some interest. ‘Suppose some outsider were to
forge one and use it to get a lot of money with?’
‘Not everyone is as crooked as you are!’ said Xi-feng good? humouredly.
‘How is it that there is no one from our place coming in for tallies?’ Bao-yu asked.
‘At the time when they come,’ Xi-feng replied, ‘you are still fast asleep in bed. Now
let me ask you something. When are you going to begin studying at night?’
‘I should like nothing better than to begin today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But what can I do if
they won’t get on with my study?’
If you were to ask me nicely,’ said Xi-feng jovially, ‘I think I could undertake to hurry
them up for you.’
‘Oh, you’re no good,’ said Bao-yu, ‘no more than any of the rest. They’ll get round
to it in time. It’s just a question of waiting till they do.’
‘Whether they get round to it or not,’ said Xi-feng, ‘they still need materials for the
job, and they can’t get the materials if I don’t choose to give them the tallies—I can
tell you that for sure!’
As soon as he heard this, Bao-yu twined himself round Xi-feng and began coaxing and
wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work
on his study.
‘Stop it! Stop it! ‘ cried Xi-feng. ‘I am so tired that my bones ache. How can I stand
up to being mauled about by a great-ape like you? You needn’t worry. They’ve just
been round to see about paper for the windows. It would look pretty stupid if you
were to send them off for something they have already got.’
Bao-yu refused to believe her until she made Sunshine look up the entry in his book
and show it to him.
While Bao-yu was inspecting the book, a servant announced the arrival of Shiner, one
of the boys who had accompanied Jia Lian to Yangchow. Xi-feng eagerly ordered him
in. Shiner louted to his mistress in the Manchu fashion and hoped that she was well.
‘Why have you come back?’ said Xi-feng.
‘The Master sent me, ma’am. Mr. Lin died on the third at ten in the morning and
the Master and Miss Lin are taking him to Soochow to be buried. They expect to be
home by the end of the spring. The Master told me to bring back the news and to
give everyone his regards, and he said I was to ask Her Old Ladyship for instructions.
He also told me to see if you were getting on all right, ma’am; and he said would I
take some fur-?lined gowns back with me for winter wear.’
‘Have you seen anyone else yet?’ Xi-feng asked him.
‘Yes, everyone,’ said Shiner, and withdrew.
Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu with a smile:
‘It looks now as if your Cousin Lin will be staying with us permanently.’
‘Poor thing!’ said Bao-yu. ‘How she must have cried and cried during this past week
or so!’ The thought of her crying made him knit his brows and sigh.
Now that Shiner was back, Xi-feng was all agog to question him about Jia Lian but
could not do so in any detail in front of the others. She would have liked to follow
him back home, but her duties were by no means over, and she was obliged to hold
out until evening. Then, back in her own apartment, she summoned him to her and
asked him for full particulars of the journey. She looked out all Jia Lian’s furs, and she
and Patience sat up into the night getting them ready and packing them ---together
with anything else which careful thought suggested might be needed—for Shiner to
take back with him to his Master. Xi-feng gave Shiner minute instructions concerning
his conduct towards the latter:
‘Mind you look after your master properly away from home, now. Try not to make
him angry. And do always be on at him not to drink too much. And don’t encourage
him to get mixed up with bad women. If, when you get back, I find out that you have
done, I’ll break your legs!’
Shiner laughingly agreed to abide by all her instructions. By the time they got to bed
it was well past one in the morning. To Xi-feng it seemed as though she had barely
lain down to sleep when it was dawn once more and time to get up again and wash
and dress for another round of duties at Ning-guo House.
The day of the funeral was now approaching and Cousin Zhen took an expert in
geomancy with him in his carriage and drove out to the Temple of the Iron Threshold
to inspect the terrain and personally assist in the selection of a suitable
rest?ing-place for Qin-shi’s coffin. He gave detailed instructions to the
monk-in-charge, Father Sublimitas, for the provision of a completely new set of
hangings and altar furnishings for the funeral, and for the engagement of as many
fashionable monks as he could think of to participate in the ceremony of receiving
the coffin.
Sublimitas hurriedly prepared a vegetarian supper for his visitors; but Cousin Zhen
had little heart for eating, and, as it was by now too late to return to the city,
presently retired to a bed that had been made up for him in the monk’s quarters,
leaving first thing next morning in order to press on with arrangements for the
funeral. On his return he sent some work?men out to the temple to refurbish the
place he had chosen for the coffin. They were instructed to work on the job
through?out the night in order to make sure that it was finished in time. He also sent
out a number of kitchen staff to cater for the funeral party on its arrival.
Xi-feng, too, began to make her own careful preparations as the day of the funeral
drew near. On the one hand she had to select coachmen and bearers from the
Rong-guo staff for the carriages and sedans that Lady Wang and the other Rong-guo
ladies would ride in in the procession. On the other hand, as she fully intended to
take part in it herself, she had to find herself somewhere to stop at on the way as
well as accommodation for the night after the funeral.
The Dowager-duchess of Shan-guo happened to die just about this time and Xi-feng
had to make the arrangements for Lady Xing and Lady Wang when they paid their
visits of condolence and later when they attended the funeral. She had to see about
birthday presents for the Princess of Xi-an. She had to write to her parents and get
things ready to send to them when her elder brother Wang Ren returned with his
wife and children to the South. And when on top of all this Jia Lian’s young sister
Ying-chun fell ill and needed doctors’ visits and medicines every day, it was Xi-feng
who had to puzzle over the diagnostic reports, discuss the patient’s symptoms with
the learned physicians, and decide on the relative merits of rival prescriptions.
Indeed, so multifarious had her activities become that it would be impossible to list
them all. As a consequence she was far too busy to pay much attention to eating and
drinking and could hardly sit or lie down for a moment in peace. When she went to
the Ning-guo mansion she was followed around all the time by people from the
Rong-guo mansion, and when she went back to Rong-guo House, members of the
Ning-guo establishment would trail after her. Yet although she was so busy, a passion
to succeed and a dread of being criticized enabled her to summon up reserves of
energy, and she managed to plan everything with such exemplary thoroughness that
every member of the clan was loud in her praises.
Wake night arrived—the night when no one in the family may go to bed—and
Ning-guo House was crowded with friends and relations. Since You-shi was still
confined to her room, it was left entirely to Xi-feng to do the honours. There were, to
be sure, a number of other young married women in the clan, but all were either
tongue-tied or giddy, or they were so petrified by bashfulness or timidity that the
presence of strangers or persons of higher rank threw them into a state of panic.
Xi-feng’s vivacious charm and social assurance stood out in striking contrast—‘a
touch of scarlet in a field of green’. She was in her element, and if she took any notice
at all of her humbler sisters it was only to throw out an occasional order or to bend
them in some other way to her imperious will.
Throughout the whole of that night the Ning-guo mansion was ablaze with lights.
There was a constant bustle of guests being welcomed or seen off the premises and
all the liveliness and excitement that is customary on occasions of this sort.
With the dawning of the day and the arrival of the hour deemed auspicious for its
departure, sixty-four green-coated bearers arrived for the coffin, preceded by a great
funeral banner bearing the following inscription:
Mortal Remains
of the
Much Lamented
LADY QIN-SHI
of the
House of Jia,
Senior Great-great-granddaughter-in-law
of the
Duke of Ning-guo,
Nobleman of the First Rank by Imperial Patent,
and Wife of the
Right Honourable Jia Rong,
Honorary Captain in the Imperial Bodyguard,
Inner Palace, Northern Capital Division.

The costumes, insignia, and funeral trappings were all glitteringly new, having been
specially made for the occasion.
Jewel, acting in the capacity of unmarried daughter of the deceased, smashed a bowl
on the floor at the foot of the coffin and as they bore it out walked in front with an
impressive display of grief.
Among the distinguished guests taking part in the proces?sion were:
    Niu Ji-zong (earl, hereditary first rank), grandson of Niu Qing, Duke of Zhen-guo,
    Liu Fang (viscount, hereditary first rank), grandson of Liu Biao, Duke of Li-guo,
Chen Rui-wen (Maj.-General), grandson of Chen Yi, Duke of Qi-guo,
    Ma Shang-de (Maj.-General), grandson of Ma Kui, Duke of Zhi-guo,
Hou Xiao-kang (viscount, hereditary first rank), grandson of Hou Xiao-ming, Duke of
Xiu-guo.
The grandfathers of the above, together with the Duke of Shan-guo, whose grandson
Shi Guang-zhu was in mourning for the Dowager-duchess and unable to attend, and
the Dukes of Rong-guo and Ning-guo, had formed the well-known group often
referred to by their contemporaries as the ‘Eight Dukes’.
The other mourners included:

The grandson of H. H. the Prince of Nan-an,
The grandson of H. H. the Prince of Xi-ning,
    Shi Ding, Marquis of Zhong-jing, nephew of old Lady Jia,
Jiang Zi-ning (baron, hereditary second rank), grandson of the Marquis of Ping-yuan,
Xie Kun (baron, hereditary second rank, and lieutenant-colonel, Metropolitan
Barracks), grandson of the Marquis of Ding-cheng,
    Qi Jian-hui (baron, hereditary second rank), grandson of the Marquis of
Xiang-yang,
Qiu Liang (Chief Commissioner of Police, Metropolitan Area), grandson of the
Marquis of Jing-tian.

Also present were the Marquis of Jin-xiang’s son Han Qi, General Feng’s son Feng
Zi-ying, General Chen’s son Chen Ye-jun, General Wei’s son Wei Ruo-An, and a large
number of other young gentlemen of distinguished parentage.
As for lady guests, there were ten or so large and thirty or forty small palanquins,
which together with the palanquins and carriages of the Jia ladies brought the total
number of equipages to at least a hundred and ten. These, with the innumerable
bearers of insignia and other funeral trappings up at the front, formed a procession
altogether more than a mile long.
The procession had not advanced very far when it began to pass the decorated
‘funeral bowers’ and tables of offerings put up along the sides of the street by friends
and well-wishers of the family. From some of them the strains of funeral music struck
up as it approached.
The first of these bowers was the Princess of Dong-ping’s, the second was the Prince
of Nan-an’s, the third was the Prince of Xi-ning’s, and the fourth that of the Prince of
Bei-jing.
Of the original holders of these four titles the Prince of Bei-jing had been highest in
imperial favour by virtue of his great services to the Crown. As a consequence, the
title and the style of ‘prince’ had been retained by his descendants. The present
holder of the title, Shui Rong, was a youth still in his teens ---a young man of great
personal beauty and a modest and unaffected disposition. On receiving the
announcement of the premature demise of the wife of one of the Duke of
Ning-?guo’s descendants, Shui Rong was reminded of the friendship that had
formerly existed between the Duke of Ning-guo and his own ancestor—both having
fought in the same campaigns and shared hardships and triumphs together—and
resolved to lay aside all considerations of rank in demonstrating his sympathy for the
bereaved. Two days previously he had paid a visit of condolence and made inquiries
about the funeral arrangements, and now, today, intending to make a libation to the
coffin as it went by, he had had his booth constructed at the road side and had
instructed a number of his staff to wait there in readiness for his arrival.
At four o’clock that morning the prince had had to be present at the imperial palace
for the early levée; but, as soon as his business there was over, he changed out of
court dress and into mourning and after getting into his great palanquin, was borne
through the streets, preceded by gongs and umbrellas of state, to the place where his
funeral bower had been erected. There his palanquin was set down and the
gentlemen of his household ranged themselves on either side of it. The street was
kept clear of traffic and pedestrians while he waited.
Presently the procession came in sight, advancing from the north end of the street
like a great river, the hearse itself look?ing like some great silver mountain that
crushed the earth beneath it as it moved. In a trice the forerunners had reported
back to Cousin Zhen, who at once gave orders to the insignia bearers to halt, and
hurrying forward with his Uncles Jia She and Jia Zheng, saluted the prince with full
court etiquette. The prince received their prostrations with a gracious smile and a
slight inclination of his person inside the palanquin, and when he spoke to them it
was not as a prince to a subject, but using the form of address he employed when
speaking to family friends.
‘Your Highness, I am quite overwhelmed by the honour you do us in graciously
condescending to be present at the funeral of my daughter-in-law,’ said Cousin Zhen.
‘My dear friend,’ said the Prince of Bei-jing, ‘your excessive modesty does us both
an injustice.’
Thereupon he turned to the chamberlain of his household and ordered him to make
offerings on his behalf. Cousin Zhen and his uncles made the correct ritual responses
while this official performed them, then returned to the palanquin and bowed their
thanks to the prince. The prince received their thanks with a most becoming modesty
and by way of conversa?tion asked Jia Zheng a question about Bao-yu.
‘Which is the boy who was born with a stone in his mouth? I have long looked
forward to the pleasure of meeting him. I am sure he must be here today. Can you
not bring him to see me?’
Jia Zheng at once withdrew to fetch Bao-yu. He made him first change into court
dress before, leading him forward to meet the prince.
Bao-yu had often heard about the Prince of Bei-jing. He had heard that he was very
clever. He had also heard that he was as handsome as he was clever and that he was
a quite jolly, un?conventional sort of person who refused to let either his royal birth
or the conventions of official life constrain him. He had often wanted to meet him,
but had been deterred by his father’s strictness from doing so. And now here was the
Prince of Bei-jing asking to see him! A feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he
hurried forward with his father. He peeped up at the prince as they advanced and
saw that he was, as report had painted him, an extremely good-looking young man.
But if you want to know about his interview with the hand?some prince, you will
have to read about it in the next chapter.

At Water-moon Priory Xi-feng finds how much profit may
procured by the abuse of power
And Qin Zhong discovers the pleasures that are to
be had under the cover of darkness



Looking up, Bao-yu saw that Shui Rong’s princely headgear was embellished by way
of mourning with white bands, a white hatpin, and filigree silver ‘wings’. As a further
token of mourning his robe, though heavily bordered with a ‘tooth and wave’ design
of rainbow-coloured stripes and gold-emblazoned with the royal five-clawed dragon,
was of a white material. It was confined at the waist by a red leather belt, studded
with green jade. The splendid costume, the luminous eyes, the finely chiselled
features really did make him an arrestingly handsome young man. Bao-yu started
forward impulsively to make his salutation, but the prince extended an arm from the
palanquin and prevented him from kneeling.
     Bao-yu was wearing a little silver coronet on the top of his head and a silver
headband round his brow in the form of two dragons emerging from the sea. He had
on a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of white material and a silver belt inlaid with
pearls. After studying these and admiring the flowerlike face and coal-black eyes, the
prince’s face broke into a smile.
         ‘If “Bao-yu” means “precious jade”, you are appropriately named,’ he said.
‘But where is the famous stone you were born with?’
     Bao-yu hurriedly extracted the jade from inside his clothing and taking it off,
handed it to the prince, who scrutinized it carefully, reciting the words of the
inscription as he deciphered them.
     ‘And does it really have these powers?’ he asked.
     ‘It is only alleged to,’ Jia Zheng put in hastily. ‘We have never put them to the
test.’
     The prince pronounced the stone a great wonder and with his own hands
refastened its plaited silken cord round Bao-yu’s neck. Then, taking one of Bao-yu’s
hands in his own, he asked him how old he was, what books he was studying, and
other such questions, to all of which Bao-yu gave prompt replies.
     Delighted that everything Bao-yu said was so clear and to the point, the prince
observed to Jia Zheng that ‘the young phoenix was worthy of his sire.
‘I trust I shall not offend you by saying so to your face,’ he said, ‘but I venture to
prophesy that this fledgling of yours will one day “sing sweeter than the parent bird”.’
Jia Zheng smiled politely.
‘My son is doubtless unworthy of the compliment Your Highness is good enough to
pay him. If; thanks to your en?couragement, he turns out as you say, we shall count
ourselves truly fortunate.’
‘There is only one drawback in possessing such charm,’ said the prince. ‘I am sure it
must make his grandmother dote upon him; and, unfortunately, being the object of
too much affection is very bad for people of our years. It leads us to neglect our
studies. This used at one time to be the case with me, and I suspect is now the case
with your son. If he does find difficulty in working at home, he would be very
welcome to come round to my palace. I do not pretend to be a gifted person myself;
but I am fortunate in counting distinguished writers from all over the empire among
my acquaintances, and my palace is a rendezvous for them when they are in the
capital, so that I never want for intellectual company. By constantly mixing and
conversing with such people at my palace, your son could do much to improve his
education.’
‘Yes.’ Jia Zheng bowed deferentially.
The Prince of Bei-jing removed a rosary from his wrist and handed it to Bao-yu.
‘Today is our first meeting, but as it was an unforeseen one, I have not come
prepared with a suitable gift. All I can offer you is this rosary made of the aromatic
seeds of some Indian plant. It was given me by his Imperial Majesty. I hope you will
accept it as a little token of my esteem.’
Bao-yu took the rosary and turning back offered it respect?fully to Jia Zheng, who
made his son join him in formally thanking the prince for his gift.
At this point Jia She and Cousin Zhen knelt before the prince and invited him to
return.
‘The Departed is now in paradise,’ said the prince. ‘Though I enjoy imperial favour
and princely rank, I would not presume to go past her carriage. Heavenly honours
take precedence over earthly ones!’
When they saw that the prince was adamant, Jia She and the rest bowed their thanks,
then, having ordered the musicians to vail their instruments and march by in silence,
they caused the front part of the procession and the hearse to pass over the junction.
As soon as the hearse had gone over, the prince and his retinue crossed in the other
direction, after which the rear part of the procession moved forward and caught up
with the rest.



*
The liveliness which attended the procession during the whole of its progress
through the city reached a climax as it ap?proached the city gate, for it was along this
last stretch that the colleagues and office juniors of Jia She, Jia Zheng and Cousin
Zhen had arranged their bowers, and it was necessary to stop and thank each one of
them as they made their offerings to the passing hearse. They did at last succeed in
getting out of the city gate, however, after which a clear road lay ahead all the way to
the Temple of the Iron Threshold. Cousin Zhen went round with Jia Rong to the
senior men among the mourners and invited them to proceed from there onwards by
the transport provided. The upshot was that those of Jia She’s generation got into
carriages and sedans, while Cousin Zhen and the younger men mounted on
horseback.
Xi-feng was worried about Bao-yu. Out in the country, she thought, he was liable to
become wild and disobedient. She felt sure that he would get up to some kind of
mischief now that he was removed from Jia Zheng’s restraint. Accordingly she sent
one of her pages to summon him, and presently he rode up to her carriage.
‘Bao dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘a person of your refinement belongs here with us. You
don’t want to go clomping around the countryside like apes on horseback with those
horrid men! Why not get in with me? The two of us will keep each other company.’
Bao-yu at once dismounted and climbed up into the carriage, and the two of them
drove on, laughing and chattering as they went. They had not been driving very long
when two horse?men galloped up beside them, dismounted, and leaning into the
carriage, informed Xi-feng that they were now near her stopping-place, in case she
wished to get out and ‘stretch her legs’. Xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask Lady Xing
and Lady Wang for instructions. The latter sent back word that they had no desire to
stop, themselves, but that Xi-feng was wel?come to do so if she wished. Xi-feng
accordingly gave orders for a short halt. At once the pages led the horses out of the
main stream of traffic and headed northwards down a small side-road.
Bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetch Qin Zhong, who was riding along behind
his father’s sedan. As the page came hurrying up and asked him to stop with Bao-yu
for a little refreshment, he turned round and saw Bao-yu’s horse in the distance,
jogging along in a northerly direction with an empty saddle on its back behind
Xi-feng’s carriage, and he realized that Bao-yu must be inside the carriage with
Xi-feng. Turning his horse’s head about, he hurried after, and followed them into the
gateway of a farm.

Apart from the barns and outhouses, the farmhouse con?sisted of little more than a
single large room, so that there was nowhere the farmer’s womenfolk could go to be
out of the way of the visitors. The sudden appearance in their midst of Xi-feng,
Bao-yu and Qin Zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed
to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one.
As soon as they were inside the thatched central building, Xi-feng asked the boys to
amuse themselves outside. Bao-yu realized that she needed to be alone, and
conducted Qin Zhong and the pages on a tour of the farmyard. He had never in his
life seen any of the farming implements before, and was very curious. One of his
pages who had some experience of country matters was able to name each
implement for him and explain its functions. Bao-yu was impressed.
‘Now I can understand the words of the old poet,’ he said:

‘Each grain of rice we ever ate
Cost someone else a drop of sweat.’

At that moment they came to an outhouse in which was a kang with a
spinning-wheel on it. Bao-yu was even more intrigued.
‘That’s for spinning yarn with to make cloth out of,’ said the pages.
Bao-yu at once got up on the kang and had just started to turn it when a country lass
of seventeen or eighteen summers came running up:
‘Don’t! You’ll spoil it!’
She was shouted at fiercely by the pages, but Bao-yu had already stayed his hand.
‘I’m sorry. I’ve never seen one before. I was just turning it for fun, to see how it
works.’
‘You don’t know how to turn it properly,’ said the girl. Let me show you how ‘tis
done.’
Qin Zhong gave Bao-yu a sly tug:
‘A comely damosel, thinkest thou nottest?’
‘Shut up, or I’ll clout you!’ said Bao-yu, pushing him.
During this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning. She did, indeed, make a
charming picture as she bent over her work. Suddenly an old woman’s voice called
out from the other side of the yard:
‘Ertie! Come here at once my gal.’
The girl jumped up from her spinning and hurried over. Bao-yu’s spirits were quite
dashed by her abrupt departure.
But just then someone came from Xi-feng inviting the boys indoors. They found her
washed and changed. She asked them if they wanted to ‘change’ too, but Bao-yu
replied that they did not. Then a variety of cakes and sweets were brought in by the
servants, and fragrant tea was poured for them to drink. When the three had taken
their fill of these refreshments and everything had been cleared away and re?packed
by the servants, they rose up and got back into their carriage.
Outside in the yard Brightie handed the farmer’s family their payment, which he had
brought with him ready-wrapped in coloured paper, and the womenfolk hurried up
to the carriage to express their thanks. Bao-yu scanned their faces carefully, but could
not see his spinning-girl amongst them. They had not driven far, however, when he
caught sight of her at the end of the village. She was standing watching for him
beside the road, a baby brother in her arms and two little girls at her side. Bao-yu
could not repress a strong emotion on seeing her, but sitting there in the carriage
there was not much he could do but gaze back at her soulfully; and soon, as the
carriage bowled along at a smarter pace, Ertie was lost to sight for ever.
With talk and laughter to beguile them, the journey passed quickly. Soon they had
caught up with the main procession; soon the sound of drums and cymbals was
heard and they could see ahead of them the banners and umbrellas of the monks
from the Temple of the Iron Threshold who had come out in procession and lined
either side of the road to welcome them; and soon they were inside the temple,
where further ceremonies awaited them, a new staging having been erected for this
purpose. The coffin was installed in one of the side-chapels leading off the inner hall,
and Jewel arranged her sleeping-quarters near by to continue her watch over it.
In the outer hall Cousin Zhen was busy attending to his guests, some of whom were
staying on, while others wished to leave immediately. To each he tendered formal
thanks for their trouble in coming. They left in order of seniority; duke’s kin going
first, then those of marquises, then those of earls, then those of viscounts, then
those of barons, and so on down?wards. It was three o’clock by the time the last of
them had gone.
Xi-feng received the lady guests inside. They, too, left in order of precedence and had
not finally dispersed until around two o’clock. Only members of the clan and a few
very close friends stayed behind to see the ceremonies through to their conclusion
two days later.
Lady Xing and Lady Wang were among those who left. They could see that Xi-feng
would be unable to return that day and wanted to take Bao-yu back with them into
town. But Bao-yu, after his first taste of the countryside, was extremely loth to return
and begged to stay with Xi-feng; so Lady Wang went without him, leaving him in
Xi-feng’s charge.
The Temple of the Iron Threshold was a private foundation of the Dukes of Ning-guo
and Rong-guo which still had some land of its own in which members of the clan who
died in the capital could be given temporary burial. The thoughtful Dukes had
provided accommodation not only for the dead but also for the living, in the form of
guest-rooms in which mourners might temporarily reside until their funereal
busi?ness was over What the old gentlemen had not foreseen was that their
multitudinous progeny would come in time to exhibit differences of wealth and
temperament so extreme as often to render their possessors mutually intolerable
and that, whereas the more hard-up members of the clan gladly occupied the
accommodation provided, the more affluent or preten?tious found it ‘inconvenient’
to stay there and preferred to seek alternative accommodation in the farmsteads and
convents round about.
Xi-feng was among those who found the Iron Threshold accommodation
‘inconvenient’. Some time previously she had sent someone to Wheat-cake Priory to
make arrangements on her behalf with the prioress Euergesia, and the old nun had
turned out several rooms in readiness for her arrival. ‘Wheat-cake Priory’ (so-called
because of the excellent steamed wheat bread made in its kitchens) was the popular
name for Water-moon Priory, an offshoot of Water-moon Abbey situated at no great
distance from the Temple of the Iron Threshold.
Presently, when the monks had finished their service and the evening offering of tea
had been made, Cousin Zhen sent Jia Rong in to Xi-feng with a message inviting her
to retire. Having first glanced round to ascertain that a sufficient number of Jia ladies
were present to look after the still remaining guests, Xi-feng bade the company good
night and left for Wheat-cake Priory with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had
attached himself to the other two when his father Qin Bang-ye, unable by reason of
his age and frail state of health to risk a night away from home, had gone back to the
city, leav?ing him to await the conclusion of the requiem services on his own.
They soon arrived at the priory and were met by Euergesia, who had brought her two
little disciples Benevolentia and Sapientia to welcome them. As soon as the first
greetings were over, Xi-feng retired to her room to wash and change. Emerg?ing
refreshed, she observed how much taller Sapientia had grown and how radiantly
good-looking, and inquired of Euergesia why she and her two charges had lately not
been into town to see them.
‘It is on account of Mr. Hu’s good lady,’ said the old nun. ‘She has lately been
brought to bed of a boy, and sent us ten taels of silver for a three-day recital of the
Lake of Blood sutra by some of the sisters to purge the stain of childbirth. We have
been so busy with the arrangements that we haven’t had time to call.’
Let us leave Xi-feng in conversation with the prioress and turn to the other two.
Qin Zhong and Bao-yu were amusing themselves in the main hall of the priory when
Sapientia happened to pass through.
‘Here’s Sappy,’ said Bao-yu with a meaningful smile.
‘Well, what about it?’ said Qin Zhong.
‘Now, now, stop play-acting!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I saw you holding her that day at
Grandma’s when you thought nobody else was about. You needn’t think you can fool
me after that!’
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
‘All right then. Never mind whether you know what I’m talking about or not. Just
ask her to pour me out a cup of tea, will you, and then we’ll let the subject drop.’
‘What sort of joke is this? Why can’t you ask her yourself? She’d pour it out just the
same for you. Why ask me to tell her?’
‘I couldn’t do it with the same feeling as you. There’ll be much more feeling in it if
you ask her.’
He finally prevailed upon Qin Zhong to make the request.
‘Oh, all right! - Sappy, pour us a cup of tea, will you?’
Sapientia had been a regular visitor at the Rong-guo mansion ever since she was a
little girl and was familiar with all its inmates. The innocence of her childish rompings
with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong had latterly, however—now that she had reached
adolescence—given way to a more mature emotion. She had fallen in love with Qin
Zhong, whose every feature and lineament now inspired her with romantic feelings;
and Qin Zhong, captivated by her developing charms, had responded by loving her
back. Although nothing serious had as yet passed between them, in their inclinations
and affections they were already united.
Sapientia hurried out and returned with a cup of tea.
‘Give it to me, Sappy!’ said Qin Zhong.
‘No, give it to me, Sappy I’ said Bao-yu.
She stood between them, pouting prettily, and gave a little laugh:
‘Surely you’re not going to fight over a cup of tea? I must have honey on my hands
I’
Bao-yu snatched the cup before Qin Zhong could do so and began drinking. He was
about to say something when Benevo?lentia came in and fetched Sapientia away to
help her lay the table. She was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and
cakes; but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts, and after
sitting a short while for the sake of politeness, were soon off to amuse themselves
else?where.
Xi-feng, too, soon left, and retired to her private room to rest, Euergesia
accompanying her. By this time the older servants, seeing that there was nothing
further for them to do, had one by one drifted off to bed, leaving only a few personal
maids, all of whom were in Xi-feng’s confidence, in attend?ance. The old nun
deemed it safe to broach a private matter in their hearing.
‘There is something I have been meaning to call at your house and ask Her Ladyship
about, but I should like to have your opinion on it first before I see her.’
‘What do you want to ask her?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Bless his Holy Name!’ the prioress began piously. ‘When I was a nun at the
Treasures in Heaven Convent in Chang-an, one of the convent’s benefactors was a
very wealthy man called Zhang, who had a daughter called Jin-ge. A certain young Mr.
Li, who is brother-in-law to the Governor of Chang-an, met her once when she was
making an incense? offering in our temple and took a violent liking to her. He at once
sent someone to the parents to ask for her hand in marriage, but unfortunately she
was already betrothed to the son of a captain in the Chang-an garrison and the
betrothal-presents had already been accepted. The Zhangs would have liked to
cancel the betrothal but were afraid that the captain would object, so they told Li’s
matchmaker that the girl was already engaged. But oh dear! young Mr. Li wouldn’t
take no for an answer, and the Zhangs were quite at their wit’s end, being now in
trouble with both parties. You see, when the captain got to hear of these goings-on
he was most unreason?able. He came rushing along in a great rage and made a most
terrible scene. ‘Just how many young men is this girl be?trothed to?” he said, and so
on and so forth. He refused out?fight to take back the betrothal-gifts and straightway
began an action for breach of promise. By now the Zhangs were really upset and sent
to the capital for some moral support -- for they are now quite determined to break
off their daughter’s en?gagement, seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable.
‘Well, it occurred to me that the Area Commander for Chang-an, General Yun, is on
very good terms with your husband’s family, and I thought I might try to find some
way of persuading Her Ladyship to talk to Sir Zheng about this and get him to write a
letter to General Yun and ask him to have a word with this captain. It is hardly likely
that he would refuse to obey his commanding officer. The Zhangs would gladly pay
anything—even if it meant bankrupting themselves ---in return for this kindness.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘It doesn’t sound very difficult. The only difficulty is that Lady Wang doesn’t touch
this kind of thing any more.’
‘If Her Ladyship won’t, what about you, Mrs Lian?’
Xi-feng laughed again.
‘I’m not short of money; and besides, I don’t touch that sort of thing either.’
Euergesia’s face assumed an expression of great benignity. After sitting for a while in
silence she sighed.
‘It’s a pity I let the Zhangs know that I was going to talk to you about this,’ she said.
‘Now if you don’t do this favour for them, they will never believe that it is because
you haven’t the time or don’t want the money; they will take it as a sign that you are
not able.’
This put Xi-feng on her mettle.
‘You’ve known me a long time,’ she said. ‘You know that I’ve never believed all that
talk about hell and damnation. If I decide that I want to do something I do it, no
matter what it is. Tell them that if they are prepared to pay out three thousand taels
of silver, I will undertake to relieve them of their trouble.’
The prioress was delighted.
‘They will! They will! No doubt about it!’
‘Mind you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’m not one of your money-grubbing run-of-the-mill
go-betweens. I’m not doing this for the money. Every bit of this three thousand taels
will go into the pockets of my boys or towards their expenses. I shan’t touch a penny
of it. If it was money I wanted, I could lay my hands on thirty thousand taels at this
very moment.’
‘Well, that’s nicely settled!’ said the prioress. ‘So can we lo6k forward to your kind
help in this matter tomorrow? We may as well get it over and done with.’
‘You can see how busy I am and how impossible it is for me to get away,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘I’ve told you I’ll do it, and so I will -- in my own time. Surely that is enough
for you?’
‘A little thing like this might seem a great deal of trouble to some people;’ said the
old nun artfully, ‘but even if it involved more than it does, it would still be nothing to
a capable person like you, Mrs Lian. You know what they say: “The able man gets
little leisure” that’s why Her Ladyship leaves everything to you. She knows how
capable you are. Of course, you have to be careful that you don’t overtax yourself.
Your health is precious!’
Soothed by such flatteries, Xi-feng forgot her weariness, and the conversation
continued with animation.
Meanwhile Qin Zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that there
was no one much about to prosecute his designs on Sapientia. He found her on her
own in one of the rooms at the back of the priory washing up tea-things. Throwing
his arms around her from behind, he gave her a kiss. Sapientia stamped with
vexation:
‘What are you doing? Stop it!’
She was about to call out, but Qin Zhong spoke entreat?ingly:
‘Darling Sappy! I want you so desperately! If you won’t let me, I’ll just lie down and
die!’
‘If you want me,’ said Sapientia, ‘you must first get me out of this hole and away
from these people. Then you can do what you like.’
‘That’s easy,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘But “distant water is no cure for a present thirst” ...’
And with that he blew out the light, plunging the room into inky darkness, and
carried Sapientia on to the kang. She struggled hard to get up—though still not
daring to call out; but soon, almost before she knew it, her breech-clout was off and
the ship was in the harbour.
Suddenly, in less time than it takes to tell, a third person bore down on them from
above and held them fast. The intruder made no sound, and for some moments the
other two lay underneath his weight, half dead with fright. Then there was a splutter
of suppressed laughter and they knew that it was Bao-yu.
‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ said Qin Zhong crossly, as he scrambled to
his feet.
‘If you won’t let me, darling,’ Bao-yu mimicked, ‘I’ll call Out!’
Poor Sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark.
Bao-yu hauled Qin Zhong from the room.
‘Now,’ he said: ‘are you still going to pretend that Sappy means nothing to you?’
‘Look, be a good chap! I’ll do anything you say as long as you promise not to shout.’
‘We won’t say any more about it just now,’ said Bao-yu genially. ‘Wait until we are
both in bed and I’ll settle accounts with you then.’
Bedtime soon came and they partially undressed and settled down for the night,
Xi-feng in an inner room and Bao-yu and Qin Zhong in an outer room adjoining it. As
there were numerous old women on night duty lying about everywhere on the floor
wrapped up in their bedding, Xi-feng was afraid that the ‘Magic Jade’ might
disappear in the course of the night; so as soon as Bao-yu was in bed she sent
someone to fetch it from him, and put it under her own pillow for safety.
As for the ‘settling of accounts’ that Bao-yu had proposed to Qin Zhong, we have
been unable to ascertain exactly what form this took; and as we would not for the
world be guilty of a fabrication, we must allow the matter to remain a mystery.
Next day someone arrived from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to see how Bao-yu
was getting on. He was coun?selled to dress up well against the cold and to come
back home if there was nothing further to do. Bao-yu was most unwilling to return
on his own account, and his unwillingness was re?inforced by the promptings of Qin
Zhong, who was anxious to see more of Sapientia and urged him to ask Xi-feng for
another day.
Xi-feng reflected a little. The main business of the funeral was now over, but a
sufficient number of minor matters still remained to be done to justify their staying
on another day if they wanted to. Three arguments in favour of staying presented
themselves to her mind:
1.It would be a gesture of considerateness to Cousin Zhen which would increase his
indebtedness to her.
     2.It would give her a breathing-space in which to get Euergesia’s business
attended to.
3.It would make Bao-yu happy, which would put her in good odour with
Grandmother Jia.
Having now made her mind up, Xi-feng acceded to Bao-yu’s request in the following
terms:
‘My own business here is all finished now, but if you want to amuse yourselves a bit
longer, I suppose I must resign myself to staying. However, we definitely must go back
tomorrow.’
When Bao-yu heard this it was all ‘dearest Feng’ this and ‘darling Feng’ that, and he
promised faithfully to return on the morrow without demur. Accordingly it was
settled that they should stay for one more night.
Xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain Euergesia’s business to
Brightie. Brightie grasped the situation at once, hurried into town, sought out a
public letter-writer, had a letter written in Jia Lian’s name to the captain’s
commanding officer, and set off for Chang-an over?night bearing the spurious
missive with him.
     Chang-an is only thirty or 50 miles from the capital, so that Brightie could finish
his business and be back again within a couple of days. The general’s name was Yun
Guang. He was indebted to the Jia family for a number of past kindnesses and was
only too ‘pleased to be of service to them in a matter of such trifling importance. He
said as much in the letter of reply which he gave Brightie to carry back with him. But
that part of his mission is omitted from our story.
When their second day at the priory was over, Xi-feng and the boys took leave of
Euergesia, and as she said good-bye, Xi-feng told the prioress to call at the Rong-guo
mansion m two days’ time to hear the news from Chang-an.
This parting was an unbearably painful one for Sapientia and Qin Zhong, and all sorts
of secret vows were exchanged and whispered contracts made before they could tear
them?selves apart. We omit all details of that harrowing scene.
Xi-feng called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on the way back to see that
everything was in order. jewel, it seemed, refused absolutely to go back home, and
Cousin Zhen was obliged to leave a woman or two at the temple to keep her
company.
Their return, and the events which followed it, will be dealt with in the following
chapter.

CHAPTER 16
Jia Yuan-chun is selected for g1orious promotion
to the Imperial Bedchamber
And Qin Zhong is summoned for premature departure
on the journey into Night



Xi-feng, Qin Zhong and Bao-yu, as we have said, called in at the Temple of the Iron
Threshold on their way home. After looking round for a while, the three of them got
back into their carriage and continued their journey into the city. Home once more,
they first called on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then went off to their
several rooms. But of the rest of that day and the night which followed, our story
says nothing.
Next morning Bao-yu found that his outer study had now been finished and was
ready for use. He looked forward to beginning night-work in it with Qin Zhong, in
accordance with a promise they had made each other. But unfortunately Qin Zhong’s
always sickly constitution had been much neglected during their two-day excursion
into the country, and the unwonted exposure to wind and cold and immoderate
indulgence in secret frolic with Sapientia had resulted on his return in a cough and
chill accompanied by total loss of appetite. Altogether he presented so sorry a
spectacle that study was quite out of the question and they were obliged to send him
back home to bed. Although Bao-yu was very dis?appointed, there was nothing at all
he could do but wait for his friend to get better.
Xi-feng had now received Yun Guang’s reply to the bogus letter, expressing his
readiness to comply with her (or, as he supposed, Jia Lian’s) request. Euergesia
communicated this information to the Zhangs; and soon the captain, swallowing his
anger and resentment as best he could, was obliged to receive back the betrothal
gifts he had sent them on behalf of his son. But Jin-ge possessed a far nobler spirit
than might have been expected in the daughter of such mercenary parents. On
learning that her affianced had been sent packing, she quietly went off and hanged
herself in her scarf. The captain’s son, too, turned out to be a young person of
unexpectedly romantic notions, for on hearing that Jin-ge had hanged her?self, he
promptly threw himself into a river and was drowned. The Zhangs and the Lis were
thus left in a very unenviable situation:


‘the maid and eke the money gone’

in the words of the poet. The only gainer was Xi-feng, who now had three thousand
taels of silver to sit back and enjoy at her leisure. Not an inkling of this affair reached
the ears of Lady Wang.
Emboldened by this taste of success, Xi-feng from now on undertook many more
ventures of a similar nature -- far more than we could give an account of in this
history.
*
The day of Jia Zheng’s birthday arrived and all the members of the Ning-guo and
Rong-guo households were gathered together to celebrate it. Just as the festivities
were at their height, one of the janitors from the main gate burst in on the
assembled company:
‘The Master of the Imperial Bedchamber Mr Xia is on his way, sir, with an
announcement from His Majesty the Emperor!’
Jia She, Jia Zheng and the rest were taken completely by surprise, quite unable to
guess what the meaning of this visitation could be. Hurriedly giving orders for the
players to halt their performance and for all traces of the feast to be cleared away,
they caused a table with burning incense (which would be required for the reading of
the Proclamation, if there was one) to beset down in its place. Then, throwing open
the centre of the three main gates, they knelt down in the entrance of the mansion
to receive their visitor.
Soon Xia Bing-zhong, the Eunuch Master of the Bedchamber, arrived on horseback
with a retinue of eunuchs at his back. He appeared to have no Imperial Proclamation
or other document on his person, for instead of dismounting, as etiquette prescribed
that he should if he was carrying a Written Instrument, he rode straight on to the
foot of the main hall. There, with beaming countenance, he got down from his horse,
climbed the steps, faced south and gave utterance to the following announcement:
‘By order of His Imperial Majesty:
Jia Zheng is commanded to present himself at court im?mediately for private
audience with His Imperial Majesty in the Hall of Reverence.’
Having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for
so much as a cup of tea and rode away. Still no wiser, Jia Zheng hurried into his court
dress and hastened to the Palace, leaving Grandmother Jia and the rest in an extreme
state of alarm which they endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to allay by dispatching a
regular stream of mounted couriers post-haste to the Palace to inquire for news.
About four hours later Lai Da, the Chief Steward of the Rong-guo mansion, and three
or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out
congratulations.
‘Master’s orders,’ said Lai Da between breaths: ‘will Her Old Ladyship please bring
Their Ladyships to the Palace to give thanks to His Majesty for the great favour he has
shown us!’
Unable in her agitated state to remain indoors, Grandmother Jia had been waiting
outside in the loggia, whither the others --Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi, Li Wan,
Xi-feng, Aunt Xue and the girls -- had also congregated to await news of Jia Zheng.
Grandmother Jia called Lai Da inside to explain his cryptic message in somewhat
greater detail.
‘We servants were all waiting in an anteroom,’ Lai Da told her, ‘and we had no idea
what was going on inside. Eventually Mr. Xia came out and saw us waiting there.
“Congratulations!” he said. “Your eldest young lady has been appointed Chief
Secretary to the Empress and is to become an Imperial Concubine.” Then after that
Master came out, too, and told us the same thing. “I have to go off to the East Palace
now,” he said, “to see the Prince. But you must hasten back as quick as you can and
tell Their Ladyships to come to the Palace and give thanks.”‘
Lai’s Da information at once dispelled the anxiety that Grandmother Jia and the
others had all this time been feeling, and the worried looks on their faces quickly
gave way to smiles of pleasure. Now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed
herself in the costume appropriate to her rank. Then off they went to the Palace in
four sedans one behind the other: Grand?mother Jia’s at the head, then Lady Xing’s,
then Lady Wang’s, and then You-shi’s. Jia She and Cousin Zhen also changed into
court dress, and taking Jia Rong and Jia Qiang with them, accompanied Grandmother
Jia to the Palace as her male escort.
There was one person who did not share the unbounded delight now general among
the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households—who behaved, indeed,
almost as if he had not heard the news at all. This person was Bao-yu. What was the
reason for his unsociable lack of enthusiasm on this occasion?
A short time previously the little nun Sapientia had ab?sconded from Water-moon
Priory and made her way into the city to look for Qin Zhong. Qin Bang-ye had
discovered her, driven her from the house, and given Qin Zhong a beating. The shock
and anger of the discovery had brought on an attack of the illness from which the old
gentleman was a chronic sufferer, and within only four or five days he had breathed
his last. Qin Zhong had always been of a weak and nervous disposition and had still
not fully recovered from his sickness when these events occurred. The severe beating
followed by the overwhelming grief and remorse attendant on the death of his father
from anger which he had himself provoked led to serious complications in his illness.
This, then, was the reason for Bao-yu’s unseasonable melancholy—a melancholy
which the news of his sister Yuan?-chun’s dazzling promotion was powerless to dispel.
Grand?mother Jia’s visit to the Palace to give thanks, her return home, the visits of
friends and relations to congratulate the family, the unwontedly cheerful bustle of
the Ning and Rong households during the days that followed, the general
satisfac?tion that everyone in those households now seemed to feel—as far as
Bao-yu was concerned these things might just as well not have been: he viewed them
with the eyes of an outsider. The rest of the family merely laughed at him, seeing in
this be?haviour only further confirmation of their belief that he was ‘a bit touched’.
But then there was Jia Lian’s and Dai-yu’s homecoming to look forward to. The
advent of the messenger sent on ahead to announce that they would be arriving next
day produced the first glimmer of cheerfulness that Bao-yu had so far shown. On
being questioned for further details the messenger told them that Jia Yu-cun was also
returning to the capital to have an audience with the Emperor. This was the doing of
Wang Zi-teng, who had recommended him in a report to the throne for promotion to
a metropolitan post. As he was both a cousin (albeit a remote one) of. Jia Lian and
also Dai-yu’s former teacher, it had been resolved that he should travel with them.
Lin Ru-hai having been laid with his ancestors in the family burying-ground and his
obsequies duly concluded, they would, if they had proceeded to the capital by the
usual stages, have been arriving back some time in the following month; but when Jia
Lian heard the news about Yuan-chun’s elevation, they had decided to make greater
speed, travelling by night as well as by day. The journey had been smooth and
uneventful.
Bao-yu merely asked if Dai-yu was all right, and on being assured that she was, paid
no further attention to the man’s news.
Having waited with great impatience until the early afternoon of the following day,
Bao-yu and the rest were rewarded with the announcement ‘Mr Lian and Miss Lin
have just arrived!’ The joy of their reunion was, however, tempered with grief,
because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting, and for a while
there was much loud weeping on either side. Then there were words of comfort and
congratula?tion to exchange and Bao-yu had an opportunity of studying Dai-yu more
carefully. He recognized the same ethereal quality he had always known in her, but it
seemed to have deepened and intensified during her absence.
She had brought a lot of books back with her and was soon busy superintending the
sweeping out of her bedroom to accommodate them and arranging various objets
d’art around it which had also formed part of her luggage. She had salvaged some
paper, writing-brushes and other articles of stationery from her old home which she
distributed as presents to Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Bao-yu and the rest. Bao-yu for his
part hunted up the rosary of fragrant Indian beads given him by the Prince of Bei-jing
and offered it as a gift to Dai-yu; but she flung it back at him disdainfully:
‘What, carry a thing that some coarse man has pawed over? I don’t want it!’
So Bao-yu was compelled to take it back again.
But let us now turn to Jia Lian.
When he had finished seeing everyone in the family, Jia Lian returned at last to his
own apartment. Xi-feng, though still so busy that she had not a moment’s leisure,
had somehow contrived to find time to welcome back her wandering lord.
‘Congratulations, Imperial Kinsman!’ she said with a smile when, except for the
servants, they were at last alone together. ‘You have had a tiring journey, Imperial
Kinsman. Yesterday when the courier gave notice of your arrival, I prepared a humble
entertainment to celebrate your homecoming. Will the Imperial Kinsman graciously
condescend to take a cup of wine with his handmaid?’
Jia Lian replied in the same vein:
‘Madam, you are too kind! I am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant,
ma’am!’
As they joked together, Patience and the other maids came forward to welcome their
Master back, after which they served them both with tea. Jia Lian asked Xi-feng
about the events that had occurred during his absence and thanked her for looking
after things so well while he was away.
‘I am not much of a manager really,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t got the knowledge, and
I’m too poor at expressing myself and too simple-minded --- always inclined to “take
a ramrod for a needle”, as they say. Besides, I’m too soft-hearted for the job. Anyone
who says a few kind words can get the better of me. And my lack of experience
makes me so nervous. Aunt Wang only had to be the slightest bit displeased and I
would get so upset that I couldn’t sleep at night. I begged her not to make me do all
these things, but she insisted. She said I only refused out of laziness and
unwillingness to learn. I don’t think she realizes even now the state I have been in—
too seated to move or even to open my mouth for fear of saying or doing something
wrong. And you know what a difficult lot those old stewardesses are. The tiniest
mistake and they are all laughing at you and making fun; the tiniest hint of
favouritism and they are grumbling and complaining. You know their way of “cursing
the oak-tree when they mean the ash”. Those old women know just how to sit on the
mountain-top and watch the tigers fight; how to murder with a borrowed knife, or
help the wind to fan the fire. They will look on safely from the bank while you are
drowning in the river. And the fallen oil-bottle can drain away: they are not going to
pick it up. On top of that, as I am so young, I haven’t got much authority over them;
so it was all I could do to prevent them from ignoring me altogether. And to crown it
all, when Rong’s wife died Cousin Zhen kept coming round to see Aunt Wang and
begging her on his knees to let me help out for a day or two next door. I said again
and again that I couldn’t do it; but Aunt Wang agreed just to please him, so there was
nothing for it but to do as I was told. I’m afraid I made a terrible mess of it—even
worse than I did here. And now it seems Cousin Zhen is beginning to grumble and
says he wishes he had never asked me. When you see him tomorrow, do please try to
make it up with him. Tell him it’s because I’m young and inexperienced. You might
even hint that it’s his own fault for having asked me in the first place!’
While she was saying this there was a sound of talking in the next room.
‘Who is it?’ said Xi-feng.
Patience came in to reply.
‘Mrs. Xue sent Caltrop over to ask me about something. I’ve already given her an
answer and sent her back.’
‘Ah yes!’ said Jia Lian, apparently pleased by the recollec?tion. ‘When I went to call
on Aunt Xue just now to tell her I was back, I ran into such a pretty young woman! I
couldn’t place her as any of the girls in our household, so in the course of
conversation I asked Aunt Xue who she was. It seems that she’s the little maid they
had that lawsuit about. Cal—something. Caltrop. She’s finally been given as
“chamber-wife” to that idiot Xue, Now that she has been plucked and painted like a
grown-up woman she really does look most attractive! What a waste to throw away a
beautiful girl on that great booby!’
Xi-feng made a little moue.
‘I should have thought that having just got back from Hangchow and Soochow and
seen something of the world, you would have settled down a bit; but I see you are
still the same greedy-guts as ever. Well, if you want her, there’s nothing simpler: I’ll
exchange our Patience for her. You know what Cousin Xue is like: always “one eye on
the dish and the other on the saucepan”. Throughout the whole of this last year
there have been I don’t know how many alarms and excursions between him and
poor Aunt Xue because she wouldn’t let him get his hands on Caltrop. It wasn’t just
her looks that made her concerned for the girl. Everything about her is so unusual.
She is so gentle and so quiet. Even among our own young ladies there is scarcely her
equal. In the end Aunt Xue decided that if she couldn’t stop him having her, at least
she could make sure that the thing was done properly, with a party and invitations
and all the rest of it. So that’s what she did, and made her his chamber wife. But
would you believe it, before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost
interest. . .!’
She was interrupted by an announcement from one of the pages on the inner gate:
‘Mr Zhen wants you, sir. He’s waiting for you in the larger study.’
At once jia Lian did up his gown and hurried out.
‘What on earth did Mrs. Xue want, sending Caltrop here like that?’ Xi-feng asked
Patience as soon as he had gone.
‘It wasn’t Caltrop!’ said Patience. ‘I had to make something up and hers was the
first name that came to mind. That wife of Brightie’s is such a stupid woman! Just
imagine’—she drew closer to Xi-feng’s ear and lowered her voice—‘of all the times
she could have chosen to bring you the interest on that money, she had to pick on
the very moment when the Master has just got home! It’s lucky I was in the outside
room when she came, otherwise she might have come blundering in here and
Master would have heard her message. And we all know what Master is like where
money is concerned: he’d spend the fat in the frying-pan if he could get it out! Once
he found out that you had savings, he’d pluck up courage to spend them in no time.
Anyway, I took the money from her quickly and gave her a piece of my mind -- which
I am afraid you must have heard. That’s why I had to say what I did. I’d never have
men?tioned Caltrop in the Master’s presence otherwise!’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘I was going to say! Why, for no apparent reason, should Mrs. Xue choose a
chamber-wife to send here the moment Master gets back? So it was you up to your
tricks, you little monkey!’
At this point Jia Lian came in again and Xi-feng ordered her maids to serve the wine
and various choice dishes to go with it. Husband and wife sat cross-legged at
opposite sides of the low table on the kang and began their drinking—Xi-feng with
some restraint, although she was normally a fairly hard drinker, in view of the
occasion.
They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Zhao, walked
in. The young couple at once invited her to drink with them and tried to make her
join them on the kang. This last honour she would under no circumstances accept,
and Patience and the girls laid a little table for her at the side of the kang and set a
little stool beside it, on which she sat down very contentedly. Jia Lian made a
selection with his chopsticks from the dishes on the table, and after heaping up two
platefuls, set them down on Nannie Zhao’s own little table for her to eat there by
herself. Xi-feng was critical:
‘Nannie can’t chew stuff like that. She’ll break her teeth on it!’ She turned to
Patience. ‘That piece of boiled gammon in the bowl I said this morning was so tender:
that would be just the thing for Nannie. Why don’t you run round to the kitchen and
ask them to heat it up for her?— Nannie,’ she said, addressing the old woman, ‘you.
must try some of the rice wine your Lian brought back with him from the South!’
‘Ooh yes!’ said Nannie Zhao, ‘I must try some of that! And you must have some too,
Mrs. Lian. Never fear! As long as you don’t drink too much, ’ twill do you good. But I
didn’t come all the way here for vittles and drink, bless you. I came on more serious
business. And you heed my words, Mrs. Lian, and stick up for me; because that
Master Lian of yours he always says he’ll do something, but when you go to see him
later, he’s clean forgot all about it! To think I reared you up on the milk of my own
bosom, Master Lian! And a fine young man you’ve growed into, thanks be! Well, I’m
old and of no account now. But there are these two sons of mine, d’ye see? If only
you would be more like a foster-brother to theta and look after them a bit, no one
would dare say a word agen them. But dearie me! I’ve asked you again and again to
help them, and you always says yes; yet to this very day nothing has ever come of it.
Well, what I thought was this, Mrs Lian. With this great blessing of Heaven that’s
come on the family on account of your eldest young lady, surely, I thought to myself,
there must be jobs in this for someone? I’ll talk to Mrs Lian about it, I said to myself;
because if I rely on Master Lian to help us, we’ll starve to death for certain sure!’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Leave your two boys to me, Nannie. I’ll look after them! You know all about Lian’s
little ways because you nursed him when he was a baby: he’ll give the dearest thing
he has to some nobody he’s picked up outside, yet his own two foster-brothers who
are much nicer young men than any of his favourites he neglects completely. If only
you would take a bit of interest in them, Lian, you wouldn’t hear a word of complaint
from anyone, instead of wasting your kindnesses on those -- those little male misses
of yours! I shouldn’t have called them “misses”, though. You treat the misses as your
missus and give me the miss! ’
There was a loud laugh from everyone present, including Nannie Zhao, who
concluded her cackles with a pious invoca?tion:
‘Bless his Holy Name! Here at last comes a just judge to set all things to rights -- But
oh Mrs Lian, those naughty things you said about “misses”: that’s not my Master Lian.
It’s just that he’s so soft-hearted he can’t bring himself to say “ no” to anyone who
spins him a tale.’
‘Soft-hearted with his boy friends, maybe,’ said Xi-feng with a lubricious smile; ‘but
when he has to do with us women he is hard enough.’
‘Tee, hee, hee, what a one you are, Mrs Lian! I don’t know when I was last so merry.
Come on, let’s have another cup of that good wine! — Now that I’ve got Mrs Lian to
stand up for me I shall have no more worries!’
Jia Lian was by now thoroughly embarrassed and laughed sheepishly.
‘Stop all this nonsense now and serve the rice! I’ve still got to go round to Cousin
Zhen’s after this to discuss things.’
‘Ah yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We mustn’t make you late for that. What did Cousin Zhen
want you for just now?’
‘It was about the visitation business,’ said Jia Lian.
‘Has it been settled, then?’
‘Well, not absolutely. Eight or nine parts settled, you might say.’
‘That’s a great favour of the Emperor’s, isn’t it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Something you don’t
hear of even in plays and stories about the olden days.’
‘Very true!’ chimed in Nannie Zhao. ‘But I must be getting old and stupid, for
everywhere these last few days have been a-buzz with talk of “visitations”, but
blessed if I can make head or tall of it. You tell us now: just what manner of thing is
this “visitation”?’
Jia Lian undertook to do so.
‘Our present Emperor, who has always had a great sym?pathy for the common man,
believes that the filial affection of a child for its parents is the most important thing in
the world, and that family feeling is the same everywhere, irrespective of social rank.
He has found that in his own case, even after see?ing the Ex-Emperor and
Ex-Empress morning, noon and night every day of his life, he is still unable to express
more than a fraction of the devotion he feels for them; and this has led him to think
of all those concubines and maids of honour and other court ladies, taken from their
homes and shut up in the Palace for years and years on end, and to realize how much
they must miss their parents. And from there he got to thinking of the parents
themselves, how they must long for the daughters they can never see again. And
then he thought what a crime against Nature it would be if any of those parents were
to become ill as a result of not seeing their daughters. And so he addressed a
Memorial to the Ex-Emperor and Ex-Empress requesting permission to allow the
families of palace ladies to visit them in the Palace on the twelfth day of every month.
When Their Old Majesties saw this Memorial they were very pleased and praised the
Emperor for his piety and goodness—“doing Heaven’s work among men” they called
it. But they pointed out in their Rescript that when the families of court ladies
entered the Palace on these visits, they would inevitably be hampered by the
restrictions of court etiquette in the ex?pression of their natural feelings. So in the
end, by an act of supreme generosity, the Emperor issued a special decree in which
he said that, apart from allowing the families of court ladies to visit their daughters in
the Palace on the twelfth day of each month, he would allow any family which had a
separate house or annexe capable of being maintained in the degree of security
specified for a temporary Imperial Residence to make written application for
permission to receive a Visitation in their own home, where the pleasures of reunion
could be enjoyed in an atmosphere of intimacy and affection. The proclamation of
this decree has created quite a stir. The Imperial Concubine Lady Zhou’s father
already has the builders at work on a special wing for visitations in his house, and
Lady Wu’s father, Wu Tian-you, has been outside the city looking for a site. So it’s
already eight or nine parts settled, as I said.’
‘Bless my soul!’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘So that’s what it is! Well, I suppose in that case
we shall soon be getting ready to receive our young lady?’
‘Of course,’ said Jia Lian. ‘What else do you think we’re all so busy about?’
‘ If we do receive her,’ said Xi-feng, ‘it should be an ex?perience worth
remembering. I’ve often wished I’d been born twenty or thirty years earlier so that
the old folk wouldn’t be able to look down on me for having missed so much. To hear
them talk about the Emperor Tai-zu’s Southern Progress is better than listening to a
story-teller. How I wish I’d been there to see it all!’
‘Ah, now!’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘That’s the sort of thing that scarce comes once in a
thousand years! I was not so young then that I can’t still remember. The head of the
Jia family in those days was Superintendant of Shipyards and Harbour Maint’nance in
the Soochow-Yangchow area and was chosen to receive the Emperor on one of his
visits. The way they spent silver on that visit, why, it was like pouring out salt sea
water! I call to mind...’
Xi-feng in her eagerness cut her short:
‘We Wangs received the Emperor on one of his visits, too. At that time my
grandfather was in charge of all the foreign tribute and the embassies going up to
Court. Whenever any foreigners arrived, it was always my family that put them up.
All the goods brought by the foreign ships to the seaports in Kwangtung, Fukien,
Yunnan and Chekiang passed through our hands.’
‘Everybody knows that,’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘There’s even a rhyme about it:

The King of the Ocean
Goes along,
When he’s short of gold beds,
To the Nanking Wang.

That’s your family: the “Nanking Wangs”. But then there’s the Zhens, who still live
down that way in Kiangnan. My word! There’s riches for you! That family alone
received the Emperor four times! If I hadn’t seen with my own two eyes, I don’t care
who told me, I wouldn’t have credited it, the sights I saw then! Never mind silver.
Silver was just dirt to them. Every precious thing in the world you can think of they
had there in moun?tains! Words like “save” and “spare” they just didn’t seem to
know the meaning of!’
‘I believe you,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve heard my grandfather talk about it, and he said it
was just like that. But it still amazes me that a single family could have so much
wealth.’
‘I’ll tell you something, Mrs Lian,’ said the knowledgeable Nannie. “Twere no more
than paying for the Emperor’s entertainment with the Emperor’s own silver. No
family that ever lived had money enough of its own to pay for such spectacles of
vanity!’
While they were chatting, Lady Wang sent someone round to see if Xi-feng had
finished her dinner yet. Xi-feng realized that there must be something which
demanded her attention and, finishing hurriedly, rinsed out her mouth and prepared
to go. Before she could leave, however, the pages from the second gate announced
the arrival of Jia Rong and Jia Qiang from the Ning-guo mansion next door. Jia Lian
had just finished rinsing his mouth and was washing his hands in a basin held out for
him by Patience when the two young men came into the room.
‘What is your message?’ he asked them.
Xi-feng, curious, stayed to hear.
‘Father sent us to tell you that the uncles have already reached a decision,’ said Jia
Rong. ‘They have measured off an area just over a quarter of a mile square which
takes in a part of our grounds, including the All-scents Garden, on the east side, and
the north-west corner of your grounds on the west, to be turned into a Separate
Residence for the Visitation. They’ve already commissioned someone to draw a plan,
which should be ready tomorrow. Father says as you’ve just got home he’s sure you
must be tired, so don’t bother to come round tonight. If there’s anything to discuss,
you can tell him about it first thing tomorrow.’
‘Thank your father for me very much,’ said Jia Lian with a grateful smile. ‘It is very
good of him to let me off tonight, and I shall do as he says and not go over until
tomorrow. I think the great advantage of this proposal is that it is so economical and
makes the job of construction so much easier. It would mean very much more
trouble if we were to build on land out?side, yet at the same time we should lose the
convenience this present scheme gives us of a single layout. Tell him when you get
back that I think it is an excellent proposal, and that I leave it to him to protest in any
way he thinks fit if the others show signs of going back on it. The one thing we must
under no circumstances do is to go looking for land outside. Anyway, I shall be round
to see him first thing tomorrow and we can talk about it in detail then.’
Jia Rong promised to retail this message.
Jia Qiang now stepped forward with a message of his own:
‘Uncle Zhen has given me the job of going to Soochow to engage music and drama
teachers and to buy girl players and instruments and costumes so that we can have
our own theatricals for the visitation. I’m to take Lai Sheng’s two sons with me; and
two of Great-uncle Zheng’s gentlemen, Dan Ping-ren and Bu Gu-xiu, are coming as
well. Uncle said I ought to have a word with you about it before I go.’
Jia Lian looked the youth up and down appraisingly and laughed:
‘Do you think you are qualified for the job? It may not be a very big one, but I
should say the pickings would be pretty good for someone who knew the ropes.’
Jia Qiang laughed too.
‘I shall have to learn as I go along!’
Jia Rong, who was standing somewhat away. From the light, availed himself of the
shadow’s concealment to give Xi-feng’s dress a surreptitious tug. She understood
perfectly well what his meaning was, but pretended not to, dismissing him with a
curt wave of the hand and addressing herself instead to Jia Lian:
‘Don’t be so officious, Lian! Cousin Zhen is no less capable of choosing the right
person for the job than we are. What do you mean by asking the boy if he’s qualified?
He’s as much qualified as any of the rest of us. He’s old enough to have seen a pig run,
even if he’s not old enough to have eaten pork! In any case, I’m sure Cousin Zhen
only chose him as a figurehead. You don’t seriously suppose that he’ll be the one to
discuss prices and deal with the business side of the expedition? — I think myself it’s
a very good choice!’
‘Of course it is,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t dispute it. I merely thought we ought to do a
few of his sums for him before he goes. Where is the money for this coming from?’
he asked Jia Qiang.
‘We were discussing that just now,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Gaffer Lai says that there’s no
point in taking money with us from here. He says the Zhens of Kiangnan hold fifty
thousand taels of ours on deposit and he can give us a letter of credit to take to them
when we go. We’ll draw out thirty thousand first and leave the rest to buy lanterns,
lamps, and curtains with later on.’
Jia Lian nodded appreciatively.
‘Good idea.’
‘Well, if that’s all settled,’ Xi-feng put in quickly, ‘I’ve got two very reliable young
men for you to take with you, Qiang. I’m sure you’ll find them extremely useful.’
‘What a coincidence!’ said Jia Qiang. ‘I was just about to ask if you could
recommend a couple of helpers!’
He asked for their names, and Xi-feng turned to Nannie Zhao to supply them. But the
old nurse was so bemused by all this talk of policy and high finance that she
appeared to be in a sort of coma, which it took a sharp nudge from Patience to rouse
her from. When she answered it was in a gabble, to make up for the awkward pause.
‘One of them is called Zhao Tian-liang, the other is called Zhao Tian-dong.’
‘Mind you don’t forget!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I’m off to see to my own affairs.’ And
she left the room.
Jia Rong slipped out after her.
‘If you will make a list of all the things you want,’ he said, smilingly and softly, ‘I’ll
see that he gets them for you, gracious lady.’
‘Gracious arsehole!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you think you can buy my favour with a few
knick-knacks? I don’t like all this whispering in corners.’
She walked away without giving him a chance to reply.
Meanwhile Jia Qiang was making a somewhat similar proposal to Jia Lian.
‘If there’s anything I can get for you while I’m away, Uncle, I shall be glad to wangle
it.’
‘My, my!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Let’s not get carried away, then! I must say, for one who’s
only just started, you certainly haven’t lost much time in picking up the tricks of the
trade! Yes, I dare say I shall write and let you know if I find I’m short of anything.’
With these words he sent the two young men back to the other house. Their
departure was followed by a succession of three or four visits by servants reporting
on household matters, after which he felt so exhausted that he instructed the
servants on the inner gate to refuse admittance to any others and to inform them
that he would deal with their business next day. It was midnight by the time Xi-feng
got back to bed.
But the affairs of that night are no part of our story.
Rising early next morning, Jia Lian first called on his father and uncles and then went
to the Ning-guo mansion, where, with Cousin Zhen, he joined a group consisting of
the older stewards and domestics and a few friends and clients of the family in
making a complete survey of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties with a view to
deciding where the various buildings of the Separate Residence should be sited. He
also helped them interview the craftsmen who would undertake the work.
After the assembling of builders and artisans the assembling of materials began: a
continuous flow of supplies converging on the site from every direction, from
precious consignments of gold, silver, copper and tin, to huge, bulky loads of
builder’s clay, timber, bricks and tiles.
Various walls, including the surrounding walls of the All? scents Garden, and some of
the garden’s pavilions were demolished so that the north-west part of the Ning-guo
property and the large open court on the north-east side of Rong-guo House were
thrown into a single site. A range of servants’ quarters on the east side of the
Rong-guo grounds had already been demolished. The Ning-guo and Rong-guo
properties had previous to this been divided by an alley-way running from north to
south between them, but as it was not a public thoroughfare, no problem as involved
in closing it and incorporating part of it in the rest of the new site.
The All-scents Garden had been watered by a stream led in by a culvert which ran
under a corner of the north wall. Now that the garden was being integrated in the
larger site, it was no longer necessary to lead the water in at this point.
The artificial hills, rocks, trees and shrubs of All-scents Garden were, of course,
insufficient for the whole of the new site; but the area occupied by Jia She was the
original garden of Rong-guo House and plentifully supplied with bamboos, trees,
rocks, pavilions, kiosks and pergolas capable of being moved elsewhere. By pooling
the resources of these two garden—the All-scents Garden of Ning-guo House and the
original Rong-guo garden where Jia She lived— and redistri?buting them over a single
area, it would be possible to make great economies in both labour and materials, and
when the estimates came to be made it was found that the requirements, in terms of
completely new materials, would be comparatively modest.
The conception as a whole and the designs for its execution were alike the work of a
well-known landscape gardener familiar to all and sundry by the sobriquet of
‘Horticultural Hu’.
Jia Zheng was unused to matters of a practical nature and left the management of
men and the control of operations to a consortium consisting of Jia She, Cousin Zhen
and Jia Lian, the stewards Lai Da, Lai Sheng and Lin Zhi-xiao, the Clerk of Stores Wu
Xin-deng, and two of his literary gentlemen, Zhan Guang and Cheng Ri-xing. The
digging of pools, the raising of hills, the sitting and erection of lodges and pavilions,
the planting of bamboos and flowers—in a word, all matters pertaining to the
landscaping and layout of the gardens, were planned and supervised by Horticultural
Hu. Jia Zheng would merely drop in occasionally when he got back from Court and
look around. On any important matters he sought the advice of Jia She and the rest.
Jia She led a life of cultured ease and never did anything. On routine matters of no
great importance Cousin Zhen would either report to him in person or send him a
brief note when the thing was done. If consultation was unavoidable, he would send
along Lai Da or one of the others for a reply.
Jia Rong’s sole task was to supervise the making of objects in gold and silver.
Jia Qiang had already left for Soochow.
Cousin Zhen, Lai Da and the rest were the ones who did most of the real work. It was
they who hired workmen, kept accounts, and supervised and inspected each job as it
was undertaken.
The amount of noise and activity generated by these opera?tions could not be
described in a few words, and for the time being we shall not attempt the task.
The family’s recent preoccupation with these important developments had released
Bao-yu from his father’s periodical quizzing about the progress of his studies.
Unfortunately the relief of mind which this would otherwise have afforded him was
displaced by a grave concern for Qin Zhong, whose sickness seemed to be daily
worsening. Under such circumstances it was impossible for him to feel happy about
anything else.
One morning, just as he had finished washing and dressing and was thinking of going
round to Grandmother Jia to ask if he might pay Qin Zhong another visit, he caught
sight of Tealeaf dodging about behind the screen wall of the inner gate and evidently
trying to catch his attention. Bao-yu hurried over to him.
‘What is it?’
‘Master Qin. He’s dying!’
Bao-yu was stunned.
‘Dying? When I saw him yesterday he seemed quite lucid. How can he be dying so
soon?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Tealeaf. ‘But that’s what the old gaffer said just now who came
round to tell me.’
Bao-yu hurried back and told Grandmother Jia. She in?structed some of the more
reliable servants to go with him and briefly admonished him before he went:
‘When you get there you may stay with him to the end, since you have been such
good friends; but you must come back as soon as it is over. Don’t hang about!’
Bao-yu hurried off to change, only to find, on re-emerging, that the carriage was still
not ready. Anxious lest he should arrive too late, he ran up and down the courtyard in
a frenzy of impatience, imploring the servants to make haste; and when it at last
arrived, he flung himself in it and drove off at great speed, hotly pursued by Li Gui,
Tealeaf and the others attend?ing him.
The house, when they reached it, appeared silent and deserted. Entering together in
a tight little knot, master and servants surged through like swarming bees to the
inner apartment at the back where Qin Zhong lay, causing great consternation among
the two aunts and half-dozen girl cousins who were tending him and who were
unable to con?ceal themselves before the advent of this masculine invasion.
At this stage Qin Zhong had already lost consciousness several times and, in
accordance with the Northern custom which forbids a sick man to breathe his last on
the kang, had some time since been lifted on to a trestle bed to die. Bao-yu gave an
involuntary cry when he saw where he was lying and broke into noisy weeping. He
was quickly restrained by Li Gui:
‘You know how delicate Master Qin is. I expect the kang was too hard for him and
they have put him here so that he can lie a bit more easy. You mustn’t cry like that or
you will make him worse!’
Bao-yu held back his sobs and drew close to his dying friend. Qin Zhong’s face was
waxen. His eyes were closed tight and he seemed to breathe with difficulty, twisting
his head from side to side on the pillow.
‘Jing-qing, old fellow! It’s me! It’s Bao-yu!’—He called him several times, but Qin
Zhong seemed unaware of his presence. Again he called:
‘It’s Bao-yu!’
In point of fact Qin Zhong’s soul had already left his body and the few faint gasps of
breath in his failing lungs were the only life that now remained in it. The ministers of
the under?world, armed with a warrant and chains to bind him with, were at that
very moment confronting him; but his soul was refusing to go quietly. Remembering
that he left no one behind him to look after his family’s affairs, and bethinking him of
poor Sapientia whose whereabouts were still unknown, he entreated them most
piteously to spare him. But the infernal visitants had no ear for his entreaties and
silenced him with angry rebuke:
‘You’re an educated young fellow: haven’t you heard the saying
If Yama calls at midnight hour
      No man can put off death till four—?

We ministers of the nether world, from the highest down to the lowest, all have
unbending iron natures and—unlike the officials of the mortal world, who are always
doing kindnesses and showing favours and inventing little tricks and dodges for
frustrating the course of justice -- we are incapable of showing partiality.’
Suddenly, above their angry shouting, Qin Zhong heard a tiny cry:
‘It’s Bao-yu!’
At once he renewed his entreaties:
‘Good gentlemen, be merciful! Give me just a moment for a few words with a very
dear friend of mine, and I’ll be back directly!’
‘What is it now?’ asked the demons. ‘What friend?’
‘I won’t deceive you, gentlemen. It’s a descendant of the Duke of Rong-guo. His
name is Bao-yu.’
‘What?’ screamed the officer in charge of the party in great alarm. He turned
angrily on his demon minions;
‘I told you we ought to let him go back for a bit, but you wouldn’t listen. Now look
what’s happened! He’s gone and called up a person full of life and health to come
here right in our midst! This is terrible!’
The demons showed signs of disarray on observing their leader to be so affected, and
there was some angry mutter?ing:
‘Yer Honour was putting on a brave enough show a short while ago. Why should
the name “Bao-yu” throw you into such a state of commotion? If you ask us, seeing
that he’s upper world and we’re lower world, there’s nothing to be afraid of. We
might just as well carry this one off now and have done with it.’
The trepidation of their leader, who was perhaps thinking more of Bao-yu’s
demon-repelling talisman than of its wearer, was far from comforted by this
reflection.
‘No! No! No!’ he shouted, and compelled them to let the soul return to its body.
With the return of his soul Qin Zhong regained conscious?ness and opened his eyes.
He could see Bao-yu standing beside him; but his throat was so choked with phlegm
that he was unable to utter a word. He could only fasten his eyes on him and slowly
shake his head. Then there was a rasping sound in his throat and he slid once more
into the dark.
What followed will be told in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 17



The inspection of the new garden becomes
a test of talent
And Rong-guo House makes itself ready for
an important visitor



Now that Qin Zhong was indisputably dead, Bao-yu wept long and bitterly, and it was
some time before Li Gui and the rest could calm him. Even after their return he
continued tearful and distressed. Grandmother Jia contributed thirty or forty taels
towards Qin Zhong’s funeral expenses and made addi?tional provision for offerings
to the dead. Bao-yu condoled and sacrificed, and on the seventh day followed his
friend’s coffin to the grave. He continued in daily grief for Qin Zhong for a very long
time afterwards. But grief cannot mend our losses, and a day did at last arrive when
he hid ceased to mourn.

*

One day Cousin Zhen came to Jia Zheng with his team of helpers to report that work
on the new garden had been completed.
‘Uncle She has already had a look,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Now we are only waiting for
you to look round it to tell us if there is anything you think will need altering and also
to decide what inscriptions ought to be used on the boards everywhere.’
Jia Zheng reflected a while in silence.
‘These inscriptions are going to be difficult,’ he said eventually. ‘By rights, of course,
Her Grace should have the privilege of doing them herself; but she can scarcely be
expected to make them up out of her head without having seen any of the views
which they are to describe. On the other hand, if we wait until she has already visited
the garden before asking her, half the pleasure of the visit will be lost. All those
prospects and pavilions—even the rocks and trees and flowers will seem somehow
incomplete without that touch of poetry which only the written word can lend a
scene.’
‘My dear patron, you are so right,’ said one of the literary gentlemen who sat with
him. ‘But we have had an idea. The inscriptions for the various parts of the garden
obviously cannot be dispensed with; nor, equally obviously, can they be decided in
advance. Our suggestion is that we should compose provisional names and couplets
to suit the places where inscriptions are required, and have them painted on
rectangu?lar paper lanterns which can be hung up temporarily –either horizontally or
vertically as the case may be—when Her Grace comes to visit. We can ask her to
decide on the permanent names after she has inspected the garden. Is not this a
solution of the dilemma?’
‘It is indeed,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘when we look round the garden presently, we must all
try to think of words that can be used. If they seem suitable, we can keep them for
the lanterns. If not, we can call for Yu-cun to come and help us out.’
‘Your own suggestions are sure to be admirable, Sir Zheng,’ said the literary
gentlemen ingratiatingly. ‘There will be no need to call in Yu-cun.’
Jia Zheng smiled deprecatingly.
‘I am afraid it is not as you imagine. In my youth I had at best only indifferent skill in
the art of writing verses about natural objects -- birds and flowers and scenery and
the like; and now that I’m older and have to devote all my energies to official
documents and government papers, I am even more out of touch with this sort of
thing than I was then; so that even if I were to try my hand at it, I fear that my efforts
would be rather dull and pedantic ones. Instead of enhancing the interest and beauty
of the garden, they would probably have a deadening effect upon both.’
‘That doesn’t matter,’ the literary gentlemen replied. ‘We can all try our hands at
composing. If each of us contributes what he is best at, and if we then select the
better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good, we should be able to
manage all right.’
‘That seems to me a very good suggestion,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘As the weather today is
so warm and pleasant, let us all go and take a turn round the garden now!’
So saying he rose to his feet and conducted his little retinue of literary luminaries
towards the garden. Cousin Zhen hurried on ahead to warn those in charge that they
were coming.
As Bao-yu was still in very low spirits these days because of his grief for Qin Zhong,
Grandmother Jia had hit on the idea of sending him into the newly made garden to
play. By un?lucky chance she had selected this very day on which to try out her
antidote. He had in fact only just entered the garden when Cousin Zhen came
hurrying towards him.
‘Better get out of here!’ said Cousin Zhen with an amused smile. ‘Your father will
be here directly!’
Bao-ya streaked back towards the gate, a string of nurses and pages hurrying at his
heels. But he had only just turned the corner on coming out of it when he almost ran
into the arms of Jia Zheng and his party coming from the opposite direction. Escape
was impossible. He simply had to stand meekly to one side and await instructions.
Jia Zheng had recently received a favourable report on Bao-yu from his teacher Jia
Dai-ru in which mention had been made of his skill in composing couplets. Although
the boy showed no aptitude for serious study, Dai-ru had said, he nevertheless
possessed a certain meretricious talent for versi?fication not undeserving of
commendation. Because of this report, Jia Zheng ordered Bao-yu to accompany him
into the garden, intending to put his aptitude to the test. Bao-yu, who knew nothing
either of Dai-ru’s report or of his father’s in?tentions, followed with trepidation.
As soon as they reached the gate they found Cousin Zhen at the head of a group of
overseers waiting to learn Jia Zheng’s wishes.
‘I want you to close the gate,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘so that we can see what it looks like
from outside before we go in.’
Cousin Zhen ordered the gate to be closed, and Jia Zheng stood back and studied it
gravely.
It was a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles. The
wooden lattice-work of the doors and windows was finely carved and ingeniously
patterned. The whole gatehouse was quite unadorned by colour or gild?ing, yet all
was of the most exquisite workmanship. Its walls stood on a terrace of white marble
carved with a pattern of passion-flowers in relief, and the garden’s whitewashed
circumference wall to left and right of it had a footing made of black-and-white
striped stone blocks arranged so that the stripes formed a simple pattern. Jia Zheng
found the unosten?tatious simplicity of this entrance greatly to his liking, and after
ordering the gates to be opened, passed on inside.
A cry of admiration escaped them as they entered, for there, immediately in front of
them, screening everything else from their view, rose a steep, verdure-clad hill.
‘Without this hill,’ Jia Zheng somewhat otiosely observed, ‘the whole garden would
be visible as one entered, and all its mystery would be lost.’
The literary gentlemen concurred. ‘Only a master of the art of landscape could have
conceived so bold a stroke,’ said one of them.
As they gazed at this miniature mountain, they observed a great number of large
white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes, rising course above
course up one of its sides, some recumbent, some upright or leaning at angles, their
surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half concealed by creepers,
and with a narrow, zigzag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between
them.
‘Let us begin our tour by following this path,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If we work our way
round towards the other side of the hill on our way back, we shall have made a
complete circuit of the garden.’
He ordered Cousin Zhen to lead the way, and leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, began the
winding ascent of the little mountain. Suddenly on the mountainside above his head,
he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smoothness and
realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an
inscription.
‘Aha, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng turning back to address the others who were
climbing up behind him. ‘What name are we going to choose for this mountain?’
‘Emerald Heights,’ said one.
‘Embroidery Hill,’ said another.
Another proposed that they should call it ‘Little Censer’ after the famous Censer
Peak in Kiangsi. Another proposed ‘Little Zhong-nan’. Altogether some twenty or
thirty names were suggested -- none of them very seriously, since the literary
gentlemen were aware that Jia Zheng intended to test Bao-yu and were anxious not
to make the boy’s task too difficult. Bao-yu understood and was duly grateful.
When no more names were forthcoming Jia Zheng turned to Bao-yu and asked him
to propose something himself.
‘I remember reading in some old book,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that “to recall old things is
better than to invent new ones; and to re-cut an ancient text is better than to
engrave a modern”. We ought, then, to choose something old. But as this is not the
garden’s principal “mountain” or its chief vista, strictly speak?ing there is no
justification for having an inscription here at all—unless it is to be something which
implies that this is merely a first step towards more important things ahead. I suggest
we should call it “Pathway to Mysteries” after the line in Chang Jian’s poem about
the mountain temple:

A path winds upwards to mysterious places.

A name like that would be more distinguished.’
There was a chorus of praise from the literary gentlemen:
‘Exactly right! Wonderful! Our young friend with his natural talent and youthful
imagination succeeds immediately where we old pedants fail!’
Jia Zheng gave a deprecatory laugh:
‘You mustn’t flatter the boy! People of his age are adept at making a little
knowledge go a long way. I only asked him as a joke, to see what he would say. We
shall have to think of a better name later on.’
As he spoke, they passed through a tunnel of rock in the mountain’s shoulder into an
artificial ravine ablaze with the vari-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of
tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion. Down below, where the trees
were thickest, a clear stream gushed between the rocks. After they had advanced a
few paces in a somewhat northerly direction, the ravine broadened into a little
flat-bottomed valley and the stream widened out to form a pool. Gaily painted and
carved pavilions rose from the slopes on either side, their lower halves concealed
amidst the trees, their tops reaching into the blue. In the midst of the prospect below
them was a handsome bridge:
In a green ravine
A jade stream sped.
A stair of stone
Plunged to the brink.
where the water widened
To a placid pool,
A marble baluster
Ran round about.
A marble bridge crossed it
With triple span,
And a marble lion’s maw
Crowned each of the arches.
Over the centre of the bridge there was a little pavilion, which Jia Zheng and the
others entered and sat down in.
‘Well, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What are we going to call it?’
‘Ou-yang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of “a pavilion poised above
the water”,’ said one of them. ‘what about “Poised Pavilion”?’
‘“Poised Pavilion” is good,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but this pavilion was put here in order to
dominate the water it stands over, and I think there ought to be some reference to
water in its name. I seem to recollect that in that same essay you men?tion Ou-yang
Xiu speaks of the water “gushing between twin peaks”. Could we not use the word
“gushing” in some way?’
‘Yes, yes!’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘“Gushing Jade” would do splendidly.’
Jia Zheng fondled his beard meditatively, then turned to Bao-yu and asked him for his
suggestion.
‘I agreed with what you said just now, Father,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but on second thoughts
it seems to me that though it may have been all right for Ou-yang Xiu to use the word
“gush?ing” in describing the source of the river Rang, it doesn’t really suit the water
round this pavilion. Then again, as this is a Separate Residence specially designed for
the reception of a royal personage, it seems to me that something rather formal is
called for, and that an expression taken from the Drunkard’s Pavilion might seem a bit
improper. I think we should try to find a rather more imaginative, less obvious sort of
name.’
‘I hope you gentlemen are all taking this in!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically, ‘You will
observe that when we suggest something original we are recommended to prefer the
old to the new, but that when we do make use of an old text we are “improper” and
“unimaginative”! -- Well, carry on then! Let’s have your suggestion!’
‘I think “Drenched Blossoms” would be more original and more tasteful than
“Gushing Jade”.’
Jia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently. The literary gentlemen could see
that he was pleased and hastened to commend Bao-yu’s remarkable ability.
‘That’s the two words for the framed board on top,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Not a very
difficult task. But what about the seven-word lines for the sides?’
Bao-yu glanced quickly round, seeking inspiration from the scene, and presently
came up with the following couplet:


‘Three pole-thrust lengths of bankside willows green,
One fragrant breath of bankside flowers sweet.’

Jia Zheng nodded and a barely perceptible smile played over his features. The literary
gentlemen redoubled their praises.
They now left the pavilion and crossed to the other side of the pool. For a while they
walked on, stopping from time to time to admire the various rocks and flowers and
trees which they passed on their way, until suddenly they found them?selves at the
foot of a range of whitewashed walls enclosing a small retreat almost hidden among
the hundreds and hundreds of green bamboos which grew in a dense thicket behind
them. With cries of admiration they went inside. A cloister-like covered walk ran
round the walls from the entrance to the back of the forecourt and a cobbled
pathway up to the steps of the terrace. The house was a tiny three-frame one, two
parts latticed, the third part windowless. The tables, chairs and couches which
furnished it seemed to have been specially made to fit the interior. A door in the rear
wall opened onto a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flowering
pear-tree and overlooked on either side by two diminutive lodges built at right angles
to the back of the house. A stream gushed through an opening at the foot of the
garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran to the foot of the rear terrace
and thence round the side of the house to the front, where it meandered through
the bamboos of the forecourt before finally disappearing through another opening in
the surrounding wall.
‘This must be a pleasant enough place at any time,’ said Jia Zheng with a smile. ‘But
just imagine what it would be like to sit studying beside the window here on a
moonlight night! It is pleasures like that which make a man feel he has not lived in
vain!’
As he spoke, his glance happened to fall on Bao-yu, who instantly became so
embarrassed that he hung his head in shame. He was rescued by the timely
intervention of the literary gentlemen who changed the subject from that of study to
a less dangerous topic. Two of them suggested that the name given to this retreat
should be a four-word one. Jia Zheng asked them what four words they proposed.
‘“Where Bends the Qi”’ said one of them, no doubt hav?ing in mind the song in the
Poetry Classic which begins with the words

See in that nook where bends the Qi,
The green bamboos, how graceful grown!
‘No,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too obvious!’
‘“North of the Sui”,’ said the other, evidently thinking of the ancient Rabbit Garden
of the Prince of Liang in Suiyang—also famous for its bamboos and running water.
‘No,’ said jia Zheng. ‘Still too obvious!’
‘You’d better ask Cousin Bao again,’ said Cousin Zhen, who stood by listening.
‘He always insists on criticizing everyone else’s suggestions before he will deign to
make one of his own,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘He is a worthless creature.’
‘That’s all right,’ said the others. ‘His criticisms are very good ones. He is in no way
to blame for making them.’
‘You shouldn’t let him get away with it!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘All right!’ he went on,
turning to Bao-yu. ‘Today we will indulge you up to the hilt. Let’s have your criticisms,
and after that we’ll hear your own proposal. What about the two suggestions that
have just been made? Do you think either of them could be used?’
‘Neither of them seems quite right to me,’ said Bao-yu in answer to the question.
‘In what way “not quite right”?’ said Jia Zheng with a scornful smile.
‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘This is the first building our visitor will enter when she looks
over the garden, so there ought to be some word of praise for the Emperor at this
point. If we want a classical reference with imperial symbolism, I suggest “The
Phoenix Dance”, alluding to that passage in the History Classic about the male and
female phoenixes alighting “with measured gambollings” in the Emperor’s courtyard.’
‘What about “Bend of the Qi” and “North of the Sui”?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Aren’t they
classical allusions? If not, I should like to know what they are!’
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they are too contrived. “The Phoenix Dance” is more fitting.’
There was a loud murmur of assent from the literary gentlemen. Jia Zhong nodded
and tried not to look pleased.
‘Young idiot!— A “small capacity but a great self-con?ceit”, gentlemen— All right!’
he ordered: ‘now the couplet!’
So Bao-yu recited the following couplet:

    ‘From the empty cauldron the steam still rises after the brewing of tea.
By the darkening window the fingers are still cold after the game of Go.’

Jia Zheng shook his head:
‘Nothing very remarkable about that!’
With this remark he began to move on, but thought of something just as they were
leaving, and stopped to ask Cousin Zhen:
‘I see that the buildings in this garden have their proper complement of chairs and
tables and so forth. What about blinds and curtains and flower-vases and all that sort
of thing? Have they been selected to suit the individual rooms?’
‘As regards ornaments,’ Cousin Zhen replied, ‘we have already got in quite a large
stock, and when the time comes we shall naturally select from it what is suitable for
each individual room. As regards drapes and hangings, Cousin Lian told me yesterday
that there are quite a lot yet to come. what we did was to take the measurements
from the plans drawn up for the carpenters and put the work in hand straight away,
even before the buildings were finished. As far as I know, up to yesterday we had
received about half of what was ordered.’
From the way Cousin Zhen spoke, Jia Zheng gathered that this was not his
responsibility and sent someone to summon Jia Lian. He arrived within moments,
and Jia Zheng ques?tioned him about the types and quantities ordered and the
figures for what had already been received and what was still to come.
In response to his inquiry Jia Lian extracted a wallet from the leg of his boot, and
glancing at a folded schedule inside it summarized its contents as follows:
‘Curtains, large and small, in various silks and satins—flowered, dragon-spot,
sprigged, tapestry, panelled, ink-splash: one hundred and twenty. —Eighty of those
were delivered yesterday. That leaves forty to come. —Blinds: two hundred. —Yes.
They all arrived yesterday. But then there are the special ones. —Blinds, scarlet felt:
two hundred. Speckled bamboo: one hundred. Red lacquered bamboo with gold
fleck: one hundred. Black lacquered bamboo: one hundred. Coloured net: two
hundred. —We now have half of each of those four kinds. The other half is promised
by the end of autumn. —Chair-covers, table-drapes, valances, tablecloths: one
thousand two hundred of each. —Those we already have.’
They had been moving on as he spoke, but were presently brought to a halt by a
steeply sloping hill which rose up in front of them. Having negotiated its foot, they
could see, almost concealed in a fold half-way up the other side of it, a dim-coloured
adobe wall crowned with a coping of rice-straw thatch. Inside it were several
hundred apricot trees, whose flowering tops resembled the billowing rosy clouds of
some vegetable volcano. In their midst stood a little group of reed?-thatched
cottages. Beyond the wall, with a barred gate divid?ing it in the middle, a loose
hedge of irregular shape had been made by weaving together the pliant young
shoots of the mulberry, elm, hibiscus, and silkworm thorn trees which grew outside it.
Between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well,
furnished with both well-sweep and windlass. Below the well, row upon row of
miniature fields full of healthy-looking vegetables and flowers ran down in variegated
strips to the bottom.
‘Ah, now here is a place with a purpose!’ said Jia Zheng with a pleased smile. It may
have been made by human arti?fice, but the sight of it is none the less moving. In me
it awakens the desire to get back to the land, to a life of rural simplicity. Let us go in
and rest a while!’
They were just on the point of entering the gate in the hedge when they observed a
stone at the side of the pathway leading up to it which had evidently been put there
in order that the name of the place might be inscribed upon it.
‘What a brilliant idea!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘If they had put a board
up over the gate, the rustic atmosphere would have been completely destroyed,
whereas this stone actually enhances it. This is a place which calls for the bucolic
talent of a Fan Cheng-da to do it justice!’
‘What shall we call it, then?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘Just now our young friend was saying that to “recall an bid thing is better than to
invent a new one”,’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘In this case the ancients have
already provided the perfect name: “Apricot Village”.’
Jia Zheng knew that he was referring to the words of the fainting traveller in Du Mu’s
poem:


‘Where’s the tavern?’ I cry, and a lad points the way
To a village far off in the apricot trees.

He turned to Cousin Zhen with a smile:
‘Yes. That reminds me. There’s just one thing missing here: an inn-sign. Tomorrow
you must have one made. Nothing fancy. Just an ordinary inn-sign like the ones you
see in country villages outside. And it should hang from a bamboo pole above the
tree-tops.’
Cousin Zhen promised to see this done and added a sugges?tion of his own:
‘The birds here, too, ought to be ordinary farmyard ones—hens, ducks, geese, and
so on—to be in keeping with the surroundings.’
Jia Zheng and the rest agreed enthusiastically.
‘The only trouble with “Apricot Village”,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘—though it would suit the
place very well—is that it is the name of a real village; so we should have to get
official permission first before we could use it.’
‘Ah, yes,’ said the others. ‘That means we still have to think of something for a
temporary name. Now what shall it be?’
While they were all still thinking, Bao-yu who had already had an idea, was so
bursting with eagerness that he broke in, without waiting to be invited by his father:
‘There is an old poem which has the lines
Above the flowering apricot
A hopeful inn-sign hangs.

For the inscription on the stone we ought to have “The Hopeful Sign”.’
‘“The Hopeful Sign”,’ echoed the literary gentlemen admiringly. ‘Very good! The
hidden allusion to “Apricot Village” is most ingenious!’
‘Oh, as for the name of the village,’ said Bao-yu scornfully, ‘“Apricot Village” is
much too obvious! why not “Sweet-rice Village” from the words of the old poem:

A cottage by the water stands
Where Sweet the young rice smells?’

The literary gentlemen clapped their hands delightedly; but their cries of admiration
were cut short by an angry shout from Jia Zheng:
‘Ignorant young puppy! Just how many “old poets” and “old poems” do you think
you know, that you should pre?sume to show off in front of your elders in this
impertinent manner? We let you have your little say just now in order to test your
intelligence. It was no more than a joke. Do you suppose we are seriously interested
in your opinions?’
They had been moving on meanwhile, and he now led them into the largest of the
little thatched buildings, from whose simple interior with its paper windows and
plain deal furniture all hint of urban refinement had been banished. Jia Zheng was
inwardly pleased. He stared hard at Bao-yu:
‘How do you like this place, then?’
With secret winks and nods the literary gentlemen urged Bao-yu to make a
favourable reply, but he willfully ignored their promptings.
‘Not nearly as much as “The Phoenix Dance”.’
His father snorted disgustedly.
‘Ignoramus! You have eyes only for painted halls and gaudy pavilions—the rubbishy
trappings of wealth. What can you know of the beauty that lies in quietness and
natural simplicity? This is a consequence of your refusal to study properly.’
‘Your rebuke is, of course, justified, Father,’ Bao-yu replied promptly, ‘but then I
have never really understood what it was the ancients meant by “natural”.’
The literary gentlemen, who had observed a vein of mulish?ness in Bao-yu which
boded trouble, were surprised by the seeming na?veté of this reply.
‘Why, fancy not knowing what “natural” means -- you who have such a good
understanding of so much else! “Natural” is that which is of nature, that is to say,
that which is produced by nature as opposed to that which is produced by human
artifice.’
‘There you are, you see!’ said Bao-yu. ‘A farm set down in the middle of a place like
this is obviously the product of human artifice. There are no neighbouring villages, no
distant prospects of city walls; the mountain at the back doesn’t belong to any
system; there is no pagoda rising from some tree-hid monastery in the hills above;
there is no bridge below leading to a near-by market town. It sticks up out of
nowhere, in total isolation from everything else. It isn’t even a par?ticularly
remarkable view—not nearly so “natural” in either form or spirit as those other
places we have seen. The bam?boos in those other places may have been planted by
human hand and the streams diverted out of their natural courses, but there was no
appearance of artifice. That’s why, when the ancients use the term “natural” I have
my doubts about what they really meant. For example, when they speak of a “natural
painting”, I can’t help wondering if they are not referring to precisely that forcible
interference with the landscape to which I object: putting hills where they are not
meant to be, and that sort of thing. However great the skill with which this is done,
the results are never quite …”
His discourse was cut short by an outburst of rage from Jia Zheng.
‘Take that boy out of here!’
Bao-yu fled.
‘Come back!’
He returned.
‘You still have to make a couplet on this place. If it isn’t satisfactory, you will find
yourself reciting it to the tune of a slapped face!’
Bao-yu stood quivering with fright and for some moments was unable to say
anything. At last he recited the following couplet:


‘Emergent buds swell where the washerwoman soaks her cloth.
A fresh tang rises where the cress-gatherer fills his pannier.’

Jia Zheng shook his head:
‘Worse and worse.’
He led them out of the ‘village’ and round the foot of the hill:
through flowers and foliage,
by rock and rivulet,
past rose-crowned pergolas
and rose-twined trellises,
through small pavilions
embowered in peonies,
where scent of sweet-briers stole,
or pliant plantains waved –
until they came to a place where a musical murmur of water issued from a cave in
the rock. The cave was half-veiled by a green curtain of creeper, and the water below
was starred with bobbing blossoms.
‘What a delightful spot!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘Very well, gentlemen.
What are you going to call it?’ said Jia Zheng.
Inevitably the literary gentlemen thought of Tao Yuan-?ming’s fisherman of Wu-ling
and his Peach-blossom Stream.
‘“The Wu-ling Stream”,’ said one of them. ‘The name is ready-made for this place.
No need to look further than that.’
Jia Zheng laughed:
‘The same trouble again, I am afraid. It is the name of a real place. In any case, it is
too hackneyed.’
‘All right,’ said the others good-humouredly. ‘In that case simply call it “Refuge of
the Qins”.’ Their minds still ran on the Peach-blossom Stream and its hidden paradise.
‘That’s even more inappropriate!’ said Bao-yu. ‘“Refuge of the Qins” would imply
that the people here were fugitives from tyranny. How can we possibly call it that? I
suggest “Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour”.’
‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. He looked inside the grotto and asked Cousin Zhen if
there were any boats.
‘Four punts for lotus-gathering and one for pleasure are on order,’ said Cousin Zhen,
‘but they haven’t finished making them yet.’
‘What a pity we cannot go through!’ said Jia Zheng.
‘There is a very steep path over the top which would take us there,’ said Cousin
Zhen, and proceeded to lead the way.
The others scrambled up after him, clinging to creepers and leaning on tree-trunks as
they went. When, having descended more, they had regained the stream it was wide
and deep once and distorted by many anfractuosities. The fallen blossoms seemed to
be even more numerous and the waters on whose surface they floated even more
limpid than they had been on the side they had just come from. The weeping willows
which lined both banks were here and there diversified with peach and apricot trees
whose interlacing branches made little worlds of stillness and serenity beneath them.
Suddenly, through the green of the willows, they glimpsed the scarlet balustrade of a
wooden bridge whose sloping ramps led to a flat central span high above the water.
When they had crossed it, they found a choice of paths leading to different parts of
the garden. Ahead was an airy building with roofs of tile, whose elegant surrounding
wall was of grey-plastered brick pierced by ornamental grilles made of semi-circular
tiles laid together in openwork patterns. The wall was so constructed that outcrops
of rock from the garden’s ‘master mountain’ appeared to run through it in several
places into the courtyard inside.
‘This building seems rather out of place here,’ said Jia Zheng.
But as he entered the gate the source of his annoyance dis?appeared; for a miniature
mountain of rock, whose many holes and fissures, worn through it by weathering or
the wash of waters, bestowed on it a misleading appearance of fragile delicacy,
towered up in front of him and combined with the many smaller rocks of various
shapes and sizes which sur?rounded it to efface from their view every vestige of the
build?ing they had just been looking at.
Not a single tree grew in this enclosure, only plants and herbs:
some aspired as vines,
some crept humbly on the ground;
some grew down from the tops of rocks,
some upwards from their feet;
some hung from the eaves in waving trails of green,
some clung to pillars in circling bands of gold;
some had blood-red berries,
some had golden flowers.
And from every flower and every plant and every herb wafted the most exquisite and
incomparable fragrances.
Jia Zheng could not help but admire:
‘Charming! But what are they all?’
‘Wild-fig’ and ‘wistaria’ was all the literary gentlemen would venture.
‘But surely,’ Jia Zheng objected, ‘wild-fig and wisteria do not have this delectable
fragrance?’
‘They certainly don’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are wild-fig and wisteria among the
plants growing here, but the ones with the fragrance are pollia and birthwort and --
yes, I think those are orchids of some kind. That one over there is probably actinidia.
The red flowers are, of course, rue, the “herb of grace”, and the green ones must be
green-flag. A lot of these rare plants are mentioned in Li sao and Wen xuan,
particularly in the Poetical Descriptions of the Three Capitals by Zuo Si. For example,
in his Description of the Wu Capital he has

agastache, eulalia,
and harsh-smelling ginger-bush,
cord-flower, cable-flower,
centaury and purplestrife,
stone-sail and water-pine
and sweet-scented eglantine...

And then there are

amaranth, xanthoxylon,
anemone, phellopteron...

They come in the Description of the Shu Capital. Of course, after all these centuries
nobody really knows what all those names stand for. They apply them quite
arbitrarily to whatever seem to fit the description, and gradually all of them—’
Once more an angry shout from his father cut him short:
‘Who asked for your opinion?’
Bao-yu shrank back and said no more.
Observing that there were balustraded loggias on either side of the court, Jia Zheng
led his party through one of them towards the building at the rear. It was a cool,
five-frame gallery with a low, roofed verandah running round it on all sides. The
window-lattices were green and tile walls freshly painted. It was a building of quite
another order of elegance from the ones they had so far visited.
‘Anyone who sat sipping tea and playing the qin to himself on this verandah would
have no need to burn incense if he wanted sweet smells for his inspiration,’ said Jia
Zheng dreamily. ‘So unexpectedly beautiful a place calls for a specially beautiful
name to adorn it.’
‘What could be better than “Dewy Orchids”?’ said the literary gentleman.
‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘That would do for the name. Now what about the couplet?’
‘I have thought of a couplet,’ said one of the gentlemen. ‘Tell me all of you what
you think of it:

A musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard.
A sweet aroma of galingale floats over the moonlit island.’


‘Not bad,’ said the others. ‘But why “sunset courtyard”?’
‘I was thinking of that line in the old poem,’ said the man:

‘The garden’s gillyflowers at sunset weep.

After all, you have already got “dewy” in the name. I thought the “sunset weeping”
would go with it rather well.’
‘Feeble! Feeble!’ cried the rest.
‘I’ve thought of a couplet, too,’ said one of the others. ‘Let me have your opinion of
it:

Down garden walks a fragrant breeze caresses beds of melilot.
By courtyard walls a brilliant moon illumines golden orchises.’

Jia Zheng stroked his beard, and his lips were observed to move as though he was on
the point of proposing a couplet of his own. Suddenly, looking up, he caught sight of
Bao-yu skulking behind the others, too scared to speak.
‘What’s the matter with you?’ he bellowed at the unfortu?nate boy. ‘You are ready
enough with your opinions when they are not wanted. Speak up! —Or are you
waiting for a written invitation?’
‘I can see no “musk” or “moonlight” or “islands” in this place,’ said Bao-yu, ‘If we
are to make couplets in this follow-my-leader fashion, we could turn out a couple of
hundred of them and still have more to come.’
‘No one’s twisting your arm,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You don’t have to use those words if
you don’t want to.’
‘In that case,’ said Bao-yu, ‘I suggest “The Garden of Spices” for the name; and for
the couplet:

Composing amidst cardamoms, you shall make verses like flowers.
Slumbering amidst the roses, you shall dream fragrant dreams.’


‘We all know where you got that from,’ said Jia zheng:

‘Composing midst the plantains
Green shall my verses be.

We can’t give you much credit for an imitation.’
‘Not at all!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘There is nothing wrong with imitation
provided it is done well. After all, Li Bo’s poem “On Phoenix Terrace” is entirely based
on Cui Hao’s “Yellow Crane Tower”, yet it is a much better poem. On reflection our
young friend’s couplet seems more poetical and imaginative than the original.’
‘Oh, come now!’ said Jia Zheng. But they could see he was not displeased.
Leaving the place of many fragrances behind them, they had not advanced much
further when they could see ahead of them a building of great magnificence which
Jia Zheng at once identified as the main reception hall of the Residence.
Roof above roof soared,
Eye up-compelling,
Of richly-wrought chambers
And high winding galleries.
Green rafts of dark pine
Brushed the eaves’ edges.
Milky magnolias
Bordered the buildings.
Gold-glinting cat-faces,
Rainbow-hued serpents’ snouts
Peered out or snarled down
From cornice and finial.
‘It is rather a showy building,’ said Jia Zheng. But the literary gentlemen reassured
him:
‘Although Her Grace is a person of simple and abstemious tastes, the exalted
position she now occupies makes it only right and proper that there should be a
certain amount of pomp in her reception. This building is in no way excessive.’
Still advancing in the same direction, they presently found themselves at the foot of
the white marble memorial arch which framed the approach to the hall. The pattern
of writhing dragons protectively crouched over its uppermost horizontal was so
pierced and fretted by the sculptor’s artistry as to resemble lacework rather than
solid stone.
‘What inscription do we want on this arch?’ Jia Zheng inquired.
‘“Peng-lai’s Fairy Precincts” is the only name that would do it justice,’ said the
literary gentlemen.
Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing.
The sight of this building and its arch had inspired a strange and unaccountable stir of
emotion in Bao-yu which on reflec?tion he interpreted as a sign that he must have
known a build?ing somewhat like this before -- though where or when he could not
for the life of him remember. He was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded
him of; when Jia Zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch, and
he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composi?tion. The literary
gentlemen, not knowing the nature of his preoccupation, supposed that his father’s
incessant bullying had worn him out and that he had finally come to the end of his
inspiration. They feared that further bullying might once more bring out the mulish
streak in him, thereby provoking an explosion which would be distasteful for
everybody. Accordingly they urged Jia Zheng to allow him a day’s grace in which to
produce something suitable. Jia Zheng, who was secretly beginning to be
apprehensive about the possible consequences of Grandmother Jia’s anxiety for her
darling grand?son, yielded, albeit with a bad grace:
‘Jackanapes! So even you have your off moments it seems. Well, I’ll give you a day
to do it in. But woe betide you if you can’t produce something tomorrow! And it had
better be something good, too, because this is the most important building in the
garden.’
After they had seen over the building and come out again, they stopped for a while
on the terrace to look at a general view of the whole garden and attempted to make
out the places they had already visited. They were surprised to find that even now
they had covered little more than half of the whole area. Just at that moment a
servant came up to report that someone had arrived with a message from Yu-cun.
‘I can see that we shan’t be able to finish today,’ said Jia Zheng. However, if we go
out by the way I said, we should at least be able to get some idea of the general
layout.’
He conducted them to a large bridge above a crystal curtain of rushing water. It was
the weir through which the water from the little river which fed all the pools and
watercourses of the garden ran into it from outside. Jia Zheng invited them to name
it.


‘This is the source of the “Drenched Blossoms” stream we looked at earlier on,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘We should call it “Drenched Blossoms Weir”.’
‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You may as well forget about your “Drenched Blossoms”,
because we are not going to use that name!’
Their progress continued past many unexplored features of the garden, viz:
a summer lodge
a straw-thatched cot
a dry-stone wall
a flowering arch
a tiny temple nestling beneath a hill
a nun’s retreat hidden in a little wood
a straight gallery
a crooked cave
a square pavilion
and a round belvedere.
But Jia Zheng hurried past every one of them without enter?ing. However, he had
now been walking for a very long time without a rest and was beginning to feel
somewhat footsore; and so, when the next building appeared through the trees
ahead, he proposed that they should go in and sit down, and led his party towards it
by the quickest route possible. They had to walk round a stand of double-flowering
ornamental peach-trees and through a circular opening in a flower-covered bamboo
trellis. This brought them in sight of the building’s whitewashed enclosing wall and
the contrasting green of the weeping willows which surrounded it. A roofed gallery
ran from each side of the gate round the inner wall of the fore?court, in which a few
rocks were scattered. On one side of it some green plantains were growing and on
the other a weeping variety of Szechwan crab, whose pendant clusters of
double-flowering carmine blossoms hung by stems as delicate as golden wires on the
umbrella-shaped canopy of its boughs.
‘What magnificent blossom!’ exclaimed the literary gentle?men. ‘One has seen
plenty of crab-apple blossom before, but never anything as beautiful as this.’
‘This kind is called “maiden crab”,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It comes from abroad. According
to vulgar belief it originally came from the Land of Maidens, and that is supposed to
be the reason why it blooms so profusely. Needless to say, it is only the ignorant sort
of persons who hold this ridiculous belief.’
‘It certainly has most unusual blossoms,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Who knows,
perhaps there is something in the popular belief.’
‘Surely,’ said Bao-yu, ‘it is much more probable that poets and painters gave it the
name of “maiden crab” because of its rouge-like colour and delicate, drooping shape,
and that the name was misunderstood by ignorant, literal-minded people, who made
up this silly story to account for it.’
‘That must be it!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Most grate?ful for the explanation!’
While they were speaking they were at the same time arranging themselves on some
benches in the gallery.
‘Has anyone an original idea for a name?’ said Jia Zheng when they were all seated.
One of them proposed ‘Storks in the Plantains’. Another suggested ‘Shimmering
Splendour’.
“‘Shimmering Splendour”,’ Jia Zheng and the others repeated, trying out the words.
‘That’s good!’
‘A lovely name!’ said Bao-yu. But a moment later he added: ‘Rather a pity, though.’
‘Why “rather a pity”?’ they asked.
‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘there are both plantains and crab-apple blossom in this
courtyard. Whoever planted them must have been thinking of “the red and the
green”. If our name men?tions only one and leaves out the other, it will seem
somehow inadequate.’
‘What do you suggest, then?’ said Jia Zheng.
       ‘I suggest “Fragrant Red and Lucent Green”,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That takes account
of both of them.’
Jia zheng shook his head:
‘No, that’s no good!’
He led them inside the building. Its interior turned out to be all corridors and alcoves
and galleries, so that properly speaking it could hardly have been said to have rooms
at all. The partition walls which made these divisions were of wooden panelling
exquisitely carved in a wide variety of motifs: bats in clouds, the ‘three friends of
winter’—pine, plum and bamboo, little figures in landscapes, birds and flowers,
scrollwork, antique bronze shapes, ‘good luck’ and ‘long life’ characters, and many
others. The carvings, all of them the work of master craftsmen, were beautified with
inlays of gold, mother-o’-pearl and semi-precious stones. In addition to being
panelled, the partitions were pierced by numerous apertures, some round, some
square, some sun-flower-shaped, some shaped like a fleur-de-lis, some cusped, some
fan-shaped. Shelving was concealed in the double thick?ness of the partition at the
base of these apertures, making it possible to use them for storing books and writing
materials and for the display of antique bronzes, vases of flowers, miniature
tray-gardens and the like. The overall effect was at once richly colourful and, because
of the many apertures, airy and graceful.
The trompe-l’ail effect of these ingenious partitions had been further enhanced by
inserting false windows and doors in them, the former covered in various pastel
shades of gauze, the latter hung with richly-patterned damask portieres. The main
walls were pierced with window-like perforations in the shape of zithers, swords,
vases and other objects of virtù.
The literary gentlemen were rapturous:
‘Exquisite!’ they cried. ‘what marvellous workmanship!’
Jia Zheng, after taking no more than a couple of turns inside this confusing interior,
was already lost. To the left of him was what appeared to be a door. To the right was
a wall with a window in it. But on raising its portiere he discovered the door to be a
bookcase; and when, looking back, he observed— what he had not noticed before—
that the light coming in through the silk gauze of the window illuminated a
passage-way lead?ing to an open doorway, and began walking towards it, a party of
gentlemen similar to his own came advancing to meet him, and he realized that he
was walking towards a large mirror. They were able to circumvent the mirror, but
only to find an even more bewildering choice of doorways on the other side.
‘Come!’ said Cousin Zhen with a laugh. ‘Let me show you the way! If we go out
here we shall be in the back courtyard. We can reach the gate of the garden much
more easily from the back courtyard than from the front.’
He led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed, then through a door into a
garden full of rambler roses. Behind the rose-trellis was a stream running between
green banks. The literary gentlemen were intrigued to know where the water came
from. Cousin Zhen pointed in the direction of the weir they had visited earlier:
‘The water comes in over that weir, then through the grotto, then under the lea of
the north-east “mountain” to the little farm. There a channel is led off it which runs
into the south-east corner of the garden. Then it runs round and rejoins the main
stream here. And from here the water flows out again underneath that wall.’
‘How very ingenious!’
They moved on again, but soon found themselves at the foot of a tall ‘mountain’.
‘Follow me!’ said Cousin Zhen, amused at the bewilder?ment of the others, who
were now completely at sea as to their whereabouts. He led them round the foot of
the ‘mountain’—and there, miraculously, was a broad, flat path and the gate by
which they had entered, rising majestically in front of them.
‘Well!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen. ‘This beats everything! The skill with
which this has all been designed is quite out of this world!’
Whereupon they all went out of the garden.

*

Bao-yu was now longing to get back to the girls, but as no dis?missal was
forthcoming from his father, he followed him along with the others into his study.
Fortunately Jia Zheng suddenly recollected that Bao-yu was still with him:
‘Well, run along then! Your grandmother will be worrying about you. I take it you’re
not still waiting for more?’
At last Bao-yu could withdraw. But as soon as he was in the courtyard outside, he was
waylaid by a group of Jia Zheng’s pages who laid hands on him and prevented him
from going.
‘You’ve done well today, haven’t you, coming out top with all those poems? You
have us to thank for that! Her Old Ladyship sent round several times asking about
you, but because the Master was so pleased with you, we told her not to worry. If we
hadn’t done that, you wouldn’t have had the chance to show off your poems!
Everyone says they were better than all the others. What about sharing your good
luck with us?’
Bao-yu laughed good-naturedly.
‘All right. A string of cash each.’
‘Who wants a measly string of cash? Give us that little purse you’re wearing!’ And
without a ‘by your leave’ they began to despoil him, beginning with the purse and his
fan-case, of all his trinkets, until every one of the objects he carried about him had
been taken from him.
‘Now,’ they said, ‘we’ll see you back in style!’
And closing round him, they marched him back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment in
triumphal procession.
Grandmother Jia had been waiting for him with some anxiety, and was naturally
delighted to see him come in apparently none the worse for his experience.
Soon after, when he was back in his own room, Aroma came in to pour him some tea
and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had
disappeared.
‘Where have the things from your belt gone?’ she said. ‘I suppose those worthless
pages have taken them again.’
Dai-yu overheard her and came up to inspect. Sure enough, not one of the things
was there.
‘So you’ve given away that little purse I gave you? Very well, then. You needn’t
expect me to give you anything in future, however much you want it!’
With these words she went off to her own room in a temper, and taking up a still
unfinished perfume sachet which she was making for him at his own request, she
began to cut it up with her embroidery scissors. Bao-yu, observing that she was angry,
had hurried after her—but it was too late. The sachet was already cut to pieces.
Although it had not been finished, Bao-yu could see that the embroidery was very
fine, and it made him angry to think of the hours and hours of work so wantonly
destroyed. Tearing open his collar he took out the little embroidered purse which had
all along been hanging round his neck and held it out for her to see.
‘Look! What’s that? When have I ever given anything of yours to someone else?’
Dai-yu knew that he must have treasured her gift to have worn it inside his clothing
where there was no risk of its being taken from him. She regretted her over-hasty
destruction of the sachet and hung her head in silence.
‘You needn’t have cut it up,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know it’s only because you hate giving
things away. Here, you can have this back too since you’re so stingy!’
He tossed the purse into her lap and turned to go. Dai-yu burst into tears of rage, and
picking up the little purse, attacked that too with her scissors. Bao-yu hurried back
and caught her by the wrist.
‘Come, cuzzy dear!’ he said with a laugh. ‘Have mercy on it!’
Dai-yu threw down the scissors and wiped her streaming eyes.
‘You shouldn’t blow hot and cold by turns. If you want to quarrel, let’s quarrel
properly and have nothing to do with each other!’
She got up on the kang in a great huff, and turning her back on him, sobbed into her
handkerchief and affected to ignore his presence. But Bao-yu got up beside her, and
with many soothing words and affectionate endearments humbly en?treated her
forgiveness.
Meanwhile in the front room Grandmother Jia was calling loudly for her beloved
grandson.
‘Master Bao is in the back with Miss Lin,’ they told her.
‘Ah, good!’ said the old lady. ‘Let us leave them alone together, then. it will be a
nice relaxation for him after the strain of being so long with his father -- as long as
they don’t argue.’
‘Yes, milady.’
Finding herself unable to shake off Bao-yu’s attentions, Dai-yu got up from the kang:
‘I can see you are determined not to let me live in peace. I shall just have to go
elsewhere.’ And off she went.
‘Wherever you go, I shall go with you,’ said Bao-yu, taking up the purse and
beginning to fasten it on again. But Dai-yu snatched it away from him.
‘First you say you don’t want it, and now you are trying to put it on again. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself!’
Her anger dissolved in a little explosion of laughter.
‘Dearest cuzzy!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Won’t you please make me another sachet?’
‘That depends on whether I feel in the mood or not,’ said Dai-yu.
Chatting together they went out of the room and round to Lady Wang’s apartment.
Bao-chai was there already. They found everyone there in a state of great excitement
owing to the fact that Jia Qiang had lust arrived back from Soochow with the twelve
child-actresses he had purchased there, to?gether with their instructors and all the
costumes and proper?ties they would use in performing their plays.
Aunt Xue had now moved to a quiet, secluded apartment m the north-east corner of
the mansion, and Pear-tree Court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama
school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges. A number
of female members of the Rong-guo staff who had some previous training in singing
and acting—they were all grey-haired old women by now—were put in charge of the
domestic arrangements. Pay and expenses and the provision of whatever was
needed for the maintenance of the troupe was to remain in the hands of Jia Qiang,
who was also to keep the accounts.
Simultaneously with this arrival, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife had come to announce that the
selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns—twelve Buddhist and twelve
Taoist—had been successfully accomplished. Even the twenty-four little habits they
would wear had now arrived brand-new from the tailor. But that was not all. It
appeared that a young lady who had entered the church under half vows as an
‘unshaved nun’ might be persuaded to loin them.
‘She comes of a highly educated official family from Soo?chow,’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife
told them. ‘As a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of
“proxy novices” in the hope that she would get better; but all was of no avail. In the
end there was nothing for it but for the young lady to take the great step herself --
though as a lay sister, without the shaving of hair. And sure enough her illness got
better immediately. She is now eighteen years of age. Her name in religion is
“Adamantina”. She lost both her parents some time ago and has only two old nurses
and a little maid to look after her. She’s said to be a great clerk and knows all the
classics by heart. What’s more, she is a very handsome young woman. She moved
into this area with her teacher a year ago because of some relic of Guanyin she had
heard about and because there are some old Sanskrit texts here that she wanted to
look at. She has been living ever since in the Sakyamuni Convent outside the west
gate. Her teacher was a great authority on the “Primordial” branch of the Tantra. She
died last winter. As she lay dying she told Adamantina that she was not to go back
home, but to wait here quietly for a call. That is why she stays on here and has never
taken her teacher’s coffin back.’
‘We should certainly take advantage of this to invite her here,’ said Lady Wang.
‘We have tried asking her,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, ‘but the reply she gives is that
noble households are given to trampling on other people’s feelings, and she is not
disposed to be trampled on.’
‘She is bound to be rather a ‘proud young woman, coming from a family of
officials,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t see why we shouldn’t make out a written invitation
and request her formally.’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife promised to see this done and hurried off to ask one of the
professional letter-writers in the family’s employment to make out a formal invitation.
Next day a carriage was sent round to fetch Adamantina to the mansion in a style
befitting a young gentlewoman of tender suscepti?bilities.
But as to what happened thereafter: that will be disclosed in the ensuing chapter.
CHAPTER 18



A brief family reunion is permitted by the
magnanimity of a gracious Emperor
And an Imperial Concubine takes pleasure in the
literary progress of a younger brother



Just at that moment a servant came in to say that the workmen needed some gauze
for pasting on window-lattices and asked Xi-feng if she would unlock the storeroom
for them. Then another servant arrived and asked her to take charge of some gold
and silver plate. Lady Wang and her maids also seemed to be fully occupied.
Thoughtful Bao-chai pointed out to Bao-yu and the rest that they were getting in
everyone’s way, and at her suggestion they all adjourned to Ying-chun’s room.
Lady Wang’s business in fact continued unabated until well into the tenth month. By
then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the various buildings in the
garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques; supplies of
livestock—storks, deer, rabbits, chicken, geese, and so forth--had been purchased
and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared; Jia Qiang’s
young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces;
and the little Buddhist and Taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their
respective liturgies. Jia Zheng could now feel reasonably well satisfied that things
were as they should be, and invited Grandmother Jia into the garden for a final
inspection in which she was to suggest any last-minute alterations that might still be
needed. When not the slightest shadow of an imperfection could any more be found,
he at last sent in his written application for a Visitation. The Gracious Reply arrived
on the very same day:

Her Grace will make a Family Visitation next year on the fif?teenth of the first month,
being the Festival of Lanterns.

The receipt of this reply seemed to throw the Jia family into an even greater frenzy of
preparation than before, so that even its New Year celebrations that year were
somewhat scamped.
In no time at all the Festival of Lanterns seemed to be almost upon them. On the
eighth of the first month a eunuch came from the Palace to inspect the layout of the
Separate Residence and to establish where the Imperial Concubine would ‘change
her clothes’, where she would sit to converse with her family, where she would
receive their obeisances, where she would feast them, and where she would retire to
when she wanted to rest. The eunuch Chief of Security also arrived with his eunuch
minions and supervised a great deal of sealing-up and screening-off everywhere. He
also instructed the members of the household in the regulations for leaving and
entering, serving food and bringing messages, all of which had to be done through
special entrances and exits and by special routes.
Outside the mansion the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and a
gentleman from the Board of Works were busy supervising the sweeping of the
surrounding streets and the chasing away of all idlers, onlookers and other
suspicious-looking characters.
Meanwhile Jia She and the consortium were putting up ornamental lanterns
everywhere in the gardens and fixing fireworks in place for a pyrotechnic display in
honour of the visit. By the fourteenth everything was finally ready. No one in the Jia
household, whether master or servant, had a wink of sleep throughout the whole of
that night.
By five o’clock next morning, when it was still dark night outside, all those in the
family from Grandmother Jia down?wards who held any sort of rank or title were
already dressed in full court rig. In the Separate Residence
    painted phoenix and coiling dragon
         flapped and fluttered on drapes and curtains,
         gold and silver-work gleamed and glinted,
         jewels and gems made a fiery sparkle,
         subtle incenses smouldered in brazen censers,
        ‘everlastings’ blossomed in china vases;
—and all was so silent, that throughout the whole of that great garden not the sound
of a cough was to be heard.
Jia She and the other menfolk drew themselves up outside the west gate.
Grandmother Jia stood outside the main gate with the female members of the family.
They noticed that the ends of the street and the entrances of the side-streets leading
into it had all been screened off.
Just as they were beginning to grow impatient, a eunuch trotted up on horseback
and was stopped and questioned by Jia Zheng
‘Oh, you’re much too early yet!’ said the eunuch. ‘Her Grace won’t be taking her
lunch until one o’clock; then at two she goes to divine service in the Bao-ling chapel.
Five o’clock, when she has an appointment to feast with the Emperor in the Da-ming
Palace and look at the New Year lanterns, is the first opportunity she will have of
asking permission to leave. I should be surprised if she got started much before seven
o’clock this evening!’
‘Well,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when she heard this, ‘you and Aunt Wang
may as well go back to your room. You will be able to come back later on nearer the
time.’
Grandmother Jia and the other ladies took her advice and went off, leaving Xi-feng to
attend to whatever still needed doing in the garden. Under her direction some of the
stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine, while other
servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden’s many
lanterns with.
Suddenly, as afternoon drew towards evening, a clatter of many hooves was heard,
and after a short pause, a group of ten or so eunuchs rushed in out of breath,
clapping their hands as they ran. This was taken by the other eunuchs as a sign that
the Imperial Concubine was on her way, for they at once jumped up and hurried to
their prearranged places. The family, too, took up their positions once more, Jia She
and the menfolk outside the west gate and Grandmother Jia with the ladies outside
the main entrance.
For a long time there was total silence. Then a couple of eunuchs on horseback came
riding very, very slowly up to the west gate. Dismounting, they led their horses out of
sight behind the cloth screens, then returned to take up their stand at the sides of
the road, half-facing towards the west. After a considerable wait, two more eunuchs
arrived and went through the same motions as the first pair. Then another two, and
then another, until in all some ten pairs were standing at the sides of the road, their
faces turned expectantly towards the west.
Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine’s procession
at last came in sight.
First came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners.
Then several more pairs with ceremonial pheasant-feather fans.
Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special ‘palace incense’ was
burning.
Next came a great gold-coloured ‘seven-phoenix’ umbrella of state, hanging from its
curve-topped shaft like a great drooping bell-flower. In its shadow was borne the
Imperial Concubine’s travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes.
Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered
handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items.
Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped palanquin
with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders
of eight eunuch bearers.
As Grandmother Jia and the rest dropped to their knees eunuchs rushed up and
helped them to get up again. The palanquin passed through the great gate and made
for the entrance of a courtyard on the east side of the forecourt. There a eunuch
knelt beside it and invited the Imperial Concubine to descend and ‘change her
clothes’. The bearers carried it through the entrance and set it down just inside the
courtyard. The other eunuchs then withdrew, leaving Yuan-chun’s ladies-in-waiting to
help her from the palanquin.
The courtyard she now stepped out into was brilliant with coloured lanterns of silk
gauze cunningly fashioned in all sorts of curious and beautiful shapes and patterns.
An illuminated sign hung over the entrance of the principal building:

PILLED WITH FAVOURS BATHED IN BLESSINGS

Yuan-chun passed beneath it into the room that had been prepared for her, then,
having ‘changed her clothes’, came out again and stepped back into the palanquin,
which was now borne into the garden.
Her first impression was a confused one of curling drifts of incense smoke and
gleaming colours. There were lanterns everywhere, and soft strains of music. She
seemed to be enter?ing a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and
luxury and delight. Looking at it from the depths of her palanquin she shook her head
a little sadly and sighed:
‘Oh dear, this is all so extravagant!’
At that moment a eunuch knelt beside the palanquin and invited the Imperial
Concubine to proceed by boat. Stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an
expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon. Lanterns of
crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks, their silvery
radiance giving the white marble, in the semi-darkness, the appearance of gleaming
drifts of snow. Because of the season, the willows and apricot trees above them were
bare and leafless; but in place of leaves they were festooned with hundreds of tiny
lanterns, and flowers of gauze, rice-paper and bast had been fastened to the tips of
their branches. Other lanterns made of shells and feathers, in the form of lotuses,
water-lilies, ducks and egrets floated on the surface of the water below. It would
have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the
more brilliant spectacle. Together they combined to make a fairyland of jewelled light.
And to these visual delights were added the many charming miniature gardens on
the barge itself—not to mention its pearl blinds, embroidered curtains, and the
carved and painted oars and paddle with which it was furnished. While Yuan-chun
was still admiring all this, her boat approached a landing-stage in a grotto, above
which hung a lantern-sign inscribed with these words:

SMARTWEED BANK AND FLOWERY HARBOUR

Stone’s Note to Reader:
You may find it surprising that ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’, ‘The Phoenix
Dance’ and those other names, which in the last chapter we showed Bao-yu
inventing in an aptitude test imposed at random by his father, should actually have
been used on the occasion of the Imperial Concubine’s first visit to her family. Surely,
you will say, a household as long established and highly cultivated as the Jias’ must
have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon
for such important purposes as these? These were no wealthy parvenus whose
vulgarity would be satisfied with the effusions of a gifted schoolboy for filling in the
gaps where inscription are felt to be de rigueur.
The answer lies in Yuan-chun’s special relationship with Bao-yu. Before Yuan-chun
entered the Palace, she had been brought up mainly by Grandmother Jia; and when
Bao-yu appeared on the scene (at a time when his mother was already middle-aged
and unlikely to have any more children) she had lavished all her affection on this little
brother who spent all his time with her at their grandmother’s. When he was still a
very little boy of only three or four and had not yet begun his schooling, she had
taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters.
Although they were brother and sister, their relationship was more like that of a
mother and her son; and even after she entered the Palace, she was always writing
letters to her father and her male cousins in which she expressed concern for the
little boy who was so constantly in her thoughts. ‘I beg you to be most careful in your
handling of this child,’ she once wrote. ‘If you are not strict with him, he will never
grow up into a proper man. But if you are too strict, you may endanger his health and
cause Grandmother to be distressed.’
When, some months previously, Jia Zheng received a favourable report from Bao-yu’s
schoolmaster in which his creative ability was commended, he had used the visit to
the garden as a means of trying him out. The results were not, of course, what a
great writer would have produced in similar circumstances, but at least they were not
unworthy of the family’s literary traditions, and Jia Zheng resolved that his daughter
should see them, so that she might know that the progress made by her beloved
younger brother fully came up to the measure of those ardent hopes she had so
often expressed in her letters.
—Incidentally, Bao-yu had, in the intervening time, supplied many more inscriptions
for the places they had been unable to cover on that first occasion.
Stone

When Yuan-chun saw the words ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’ she
laughed.
‘Surely “Flowery Harbour” is enough by itself? Why “Smartweed Bank” as well?’
At once an attendant eunuch disembarked and rushed like the wind to tell Jia Zheng,
who
immediately gave orders to have the inscription changed.
By this time the barge had drawn alongside the bank and Yuan-chun disembarked
and
stepped once more into her palanquin. Soon she was borne into that part of the
garden where
‘Roof above roof soared
Eye up-compelling ...’
and saw the white marble memorial arch which had so strongly affected Bao-yu
when he first saw it. It now bore a temporary inscription:

PRECINCT OF THE CELESTIAL VISITANT

Yuan-chun gave orders that the words ‘The House of Reunion’ should be substituted.
She now ascended the terraces and entered the open-fronted hall of audience.
From a ring of cressets against the night sky
a fragrant scatter dropped on the flagstones;
and candelabra like fiery fir-trees
gleamed festively in the gilded casements;
         there were blinds looped and fringed like a prawn’s belly,
         there were rugs in rows like an otter’s offering;
         and tripods smoked with perfumes of musk and borneol,
         and behind the throne waved fans of pheasant feathers.
It was a scene no whit less splendid than that fairy palace of which the poet sings:

The abode of the Princess has cassia halls and orchid chambers.


‘How is it that this place has no name?’ asked Yuan-chun.
‘This is the principal hall of the Residence, Your Grace. The family dared not give it a
name without consulting you first.
Her Grace nodded.
A eunuch Master of Ceremonies now requested her to seat herself upon a chair of
state in order to receive the obeisances of her family. Music struck up from a band
stationed at either side of the steps as two eunuchs conducted Jia She and Jia Zheng
onto the terrace beneath. The other male members of the family ranged themselves
behind them and the whole party then began to advance in formation up the steps
into the hall.
‘Excused!’
A lady-in-waiting came forward and uttered this single word as an indication that the
Imperial Concubine wished to absolve them from the ceremonial, and with a slight
bow they with?drew.
It was now the turn of Grandmother Jia (‘the Dowager Lady Jia of Rong-guo’ they
called her) and the ladies of the household to make their obeisance. The eunuchs led
them up the steps at the east side of the terrace on to the platform in front of the
hall, where they ranged themselves in order of precedence.
Once more the lady-in-waiting pronounced the absolving word and they, too,
withdrew.
After tea had been offered three times as etiquette prescribed, the Imperial
Concubine descended from her throne, the music stopped, and she withdrew into a
side room to ‘change her clothes’. A less formal carriage than the imperial palanquin
had been prepared which carried her from the garden to her family’s own quarters.
Inside Grandmother Jia’s apartment Yuan-chun became a grandchild once more and
knelt down to make her kotow. But Grandmother Jia and the rest knelt down too and
prevented her from prostrating herself. She ended up, clinging to Grandmother Jia by
one hand and Lady Wang by the other, while the tears streamed down her face, too
overcome to say anything. All three of them, in fact, though there was so much they
wanted to say, seemed quite incapable of speech and stood there holding each other
and sobbing, apparently un?able to stop. The others present— Lady Xing, Li Wan,
Wang Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun—stood round them weeping silently.
No one spoke a word.
Yuan-chun at last restrained her sobs and forced a smile to her tear-stained face:
‘It hasn’t been easy, winning this chance of coming back among you after all those
years since I was first walled up in That Place. Now that we are seeing each other at
last, we ought to talk and be cheerful, not waste all the time crying! I shall be leaving
again in no time at all, and Heaven only knows when I shall have another chance of
seeing you!’
At this point she broke down once more and had to be comforted by Lady Xing.
When she had composed herself, Grandmother Jia made her sit down while the
members of the family came forward one at a time to greet her and say a few words.
This was an occasion for further tears. Then the senior menservants of both the
Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions assembled in the courtyard outside and paid their
respects. They were followed by the women servants and maids, who were allowed
to come inside the room to make their kotow.
Yuan-chun asked why her Aunt Xue and her cousins Bao-chai and Lin Dai-yu were
missing.
‘Relations outside the Jia family are not allowed to see you without a special
invitation, dear,’ Lady Wang told her.
Yuan-chun asked them to be invited in immediately, and Aunt Xue and the two girls
arrived after a few moments. They would have kotowed to her in accordance with
court etiquette had not Yuan-chun hurriedly excused them from doing so. The three
of them went up to her, and niece and aunt exchanged news of the years that had
elapsed since they last met.
Next Lutany and the other maids who had accompanied Yuan-chun into the Palace
came forward to make their kotows to Grandmother Jia. The old lady at once
motioned to them to rise and gave instructions to her own servants to entertain
them in another room.
The senior eunuchs and the ladies-in-waiting were now led off by members of the
staffs of Jia She’s household and the Ning-guo mansion to be entertained elsewhere,
leaving only three or four very junior eunuchs in attendance. Yuan-chun was at last
free to chat informally with her mother and the other female members of her family
and learned for the first time about many personal and domestic events that had
occurred in the household since she left it.
Then there was her interview with Jia Zheng, which had to take place with her father
standing outside the door-curtain of the room in which she was sitting. Now that she
was the Emperor’s woman, this was the nearest to her he could ever hope to get.
The sense of deprivation struck home to Yuan-?chun as she addressed him through
the curtain.
‘What is the use of all this luxury and splendour,’ she said bitterly, ‘if I am to be
always separated from those I love —denied the tenderness which even the poorest
peasant who seasons his bread with salt and pickles and dresses in hempen
homespun is free to enjoy?’
With tears in his eyes the good man delivered the following little speech to the
daughter he could not see:
‘Madam.
That a poor and undistinguished household such as ours should have produced, as it
were, a phoenix from amidst a flock of crows and pies to bask in the sunshine of
Imperial favour and shed its reflected beams on the departed representatives of our
ancestral line must be attributable to the concentration in your single person of the
quintessences of all that is most admirable in celestial and terrestrial nature and the
accumulated merit of many generations of our forebears, and is an honour and a
blessing in which my wife and I are proud to be participators.
‘Our beloved Emperor, who embodies in his own Sacred Person those life-giving
forces which are always invisibly at work in the natural cosmos, has showered down
upon his grate?ful subjects a gracious kindness unprecedented in the annals of
recorded history—a kindness which even the expenditure of our life’s blood to the
veriest ultimate drop would be wholly inadequate to repay and which only the most
unremitting pains and unswerving loyalty in the discharge of those duties to which it
has pleased him to call us could adequately express.
‘It is our earnest prayer that His Sacred Majesty may con?tinue long to reign over
us, a blessing to all his peoples; and that Your Grace should feel no anxiety
concerning the welfare of my wife and myself during our now declining years, but
should rather cherish and sustain your own precious person, in order to be the better
able to serve His Sacred Majesty with care and diligence, seeking by that service to
be worthy of the tender regard and loving favour which he has been graciously
pleased to bestow upon you.’
To this formal speech the Imperial Concubine made a formal reply:
‘Sir. It is of course desirable that you should exercise the utmost diligence when
engaged upon business of state, but it is to be hoped that you will take sufficient care
of your own well-being whenever not so engaged, and will under no circumstances
vex yourself with anxiety on our behalf.’
‘The inscriptions at present displayed on the pavilions and other buildings in the
garden were composed by Bao-yu,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If there are any places in the
garden which particularly take your fancy, we hope you will name them for us.’
The news that Bao-yu could already compose inscriptions evoked a smile of pleasure.
‘He has made progress, then!’
Jia Zheng withdrew.
‘But why is Bao-yu not with us?’ she added.
‘The menfolk of the family are not supposed to see you without special reason,’
Grandmother Jia explained.
Yuan-hun at once gave orders that he should be summoned, and presently he was
brought in by one of the little eunuchs. When he had completed his kotow she called
him over, and stretching Out her arms, drew him to her bosom where she held him in
a close embrace, stroking his hair and fondling the back of his neck.
‘What a lot you have grown---!’ she began. But the rest was drowned in a flood of
tears.
You-shi and Xi-feng now approached to announce that a feast awaited her in the
Separate Residence. Yuan-chun rose to her feet, and bidding Bao-yu lead the way,
walked with the rest of the company to the gate of the garden. There, in the light of
the innumerable lanterns, all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her
entertainment. The route led through ‘The Phoenix Dance’, ‘Fragrant Red and Lucent
Green’, ‘The Hopeful Sign’, and ‘The Garden of Spices’. This time the inspection was
no perfunctory one. Yuan-chun insisted on looking inside the buildings and climbing
up and down their stairs. She crossed bridges, she walked round each tiny ‘mountain’,
and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view. All the
places she visited were so beautifully furnished and so ingeniously planned, that she
could not conceal her delight. But there was a faint note of censure in her praise
‘You really mustn’t be so extravagant in future. This is far too much!’
They had now come to the main hall. Having first decreed that they should dispense
with court etiquette—which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting
down at all—she took her place at the main table, while Grandmother Jia and the
rest sat at little tables on either side, and You-shi, Li Wan and Xi-feng moved to and
fro, dispensing wine and helping with the service.
While they were still drinking, Yuan-chun sent for writing materials, and taking up a
brush, began in her own hand to write out some names for the parts of the garden
she had liked the best. The name she chose for the garden as a whole was ‘Prospect
Garden’, and she composed the following couplet to go outside the main reception
hall:

For all earth to share, his great compassion has been extended,
that children and humble folk may gratefully rejoice.
For all ages to admire, his noble institutions have been promoted,
that people of every land and clime may joyfully exult.

She altered ‘The Phoenix Dance’ to ‘The Naiad’s House’, and she renamed ‘Fragrant
Red and Lucent Green’ ‘Crimson Joys and Green Delights’ and named the building in
its grounds ‘The House of Green Delights’. The buildings belonging to ‘The Garden of
Spices’ she named ‘All-spice Court’. Those of ‘The Hopeful Sign’ she gave the name
‘Washbrook Farm’. The main hall became ‘Prospect Hall’ with separate names for the
high galleries on either side: ‘The Painted Chamber’ for the one on the east side, ‘The
Fragrance Gallery’ for the one on the west. Among the other names which she
invented for various other parts of the garden were:
‘The Smartweed Loggia’, ‘The Lotus Pavilion’, ‘Amaryllis Eyot’, and ‘Duckweed
Island’. She also composed inscrip?tions for some of its prospects, including
‘Pear-tree blossom in springtime rain’, ‘Paulownia leaves in autumn wind’, and
‘Rushes in the winter snow’. The couplets composed by Bao-yu were to remain
unaltered.
Having finished with the inscriptions, she proceeded to write out the following
quatrain of her own composition:

Embracing hills and streams, with skill they wrought:
Their work at last is to perfection brought.
Earth’s fairest prospects all are here installed,
So ‘Prospect Garden’ let its name be called!


‘There!’ she said with a smile to the girls. ‘I’m no genius, as you all well know, and I
have never been much of a poet. But tonight I thought I really must write something,
for this beautiful garden’s sake. Later on, when I have more time to spare, I intend to
write a Description of Prospect Garden and a set of verses to be entitled The
Visitation in commemoration of this wonderful night. But meanwhile I should like
each of you girls to compose an inscription that could be used somewhere in the
garden, and also a poem to go with it. Just write anything that comes into your heads.
I don’t want you to restrict yourselves by trying to make your poems in any way
relate to my own poor effort. As for Bao-yu: I am very pleased that he is able to
compose verses so well, and I want him to write me an octet for each of the four
places in the garden I like best: the Naiad’s House, All-spice Court - those are my two
favourites—the House of Green Delights, and Washbrook Farm. The couplets he has
already written for them are very good, but these are four such special places, that I
feel they deserve to have something more written about them. And apart from that,
if Bao-yu can show me these four poems while I am here, I shall feel that the efforts I
made at teaching him when he was a little boy were worth while.’
Bao-yu could scarcely refuse, and went off to rack his brains for some good lines.
Tan-chun was by far the most gifted of the Three Springs and joined Bao-chai and
Dai-yu in writing octets. Li Wan, Ying-chun and Xi-chun, none of whom had any talent
for versification, contented themselves with a quatrain apiece, but found even four
lines a considerable effort.
When the girls had all finished, Yuan-chun took up the papers one by one and
examined the results of their labours. Here is what they had written:

Ying-chun: Heart’s Ease

        The garden finished, all its prospects please.
        Bidden to write, I name this spot ‘Heart’s Ease’.
        Who would have thought on earth such scenes to find
        As here refresh the heart and ease the mind?

*

Tan-chun: Brightness and Grace

        Water on hills and hills on waters smile,
        More bright and graceful than the Immortal Isle.
        Midst odorous herbs the singer’s green fan hides;
        Her crimson skirt through falling petals glides.
        A radiant jewel to the world is shown,
        A fairy princess from her tower come down:
        And since her steps the garden’s walks have trod,
        No mortal foot must desecrate its sod.

*

Xi-chun: Art the Creator

        The garden’s landscape far and wide outspreads;
        High in the clouds its buildings raise their heads;
        Serene in moonlight, radiant in the sun—
        Great Nature’s handiwork has been outdone!

Li Wan: All Things Bright and Beautiful

        The finished garden is a wondrous sight.
        Unlettered and unskilled, I blush to write.
        Its marvels are not in one phrase expressed,
        Yet ‘Bright and Beautiful’ I judge the best.

Xue Bao-chai: Auspicious Skies

    West of imperial walls the garden lies;
    The sun beams on it from auspicious skies.
    Its willows orioles from the vale invite;
    Tall bamboos tempt the phoenix to alight.
    Poetic arts this night must celebrate
    Filial affection dressed in robes of state.
    Dare I, who have those jewelled phrases read,
    Add more to what She has already said?

Lin Dai-yu: The Fairy Stream

    To fairy haunts far from the world’s annoy
    A royal visit brings a double joy.
    A thousand borrowed beauties here combined
    In this new setting new enchantment find.
    Its odours sweet a poet’s wine enrich;
    Its flowers a queenly visitor bewitch.
    May she and we this favour hope to gain:
    That oft-times she may pass this way again!

*
As soon as she had finished reading the poems, Yuan-chun praised them all warmly.
‘But Cousin Lin’s and Cousin Xue’s poems are specially good,’ she said. ‘Our Jia girls
are no match for them!’
Dai-yu had confidently expected that this night would give her an opportunity of
deploying her talents to the full and amazing everyone with her genius. It was very
disappointing that no more had been required of her than a single little poem and an
inscription; and though she was obliged to confine her?self to what the Imperial
Concubine had commanded, she had composed her octet without enthusiasm and in
a very per?functory manner.
Meanwhile Bao-yu was far from finished with his consignment. He had finished
composing the poems for the Naiad’s House and All-spice Court and was still in the
middle of a poem on the House of Green Delights. Bao-chai took a peep over his
shoulder and noticed that his draft contained the line

Some wear sheathed skirts of lucent green curled tight.

When no one was looking she gave him a nudge:
‘You can tell Her Grace didn’t like “lucent green” because she only lust now altered
it to something else in your inscrip?tion. If you insist on using it in your poem, it will
look as if you are deliberately flaunting your difference of opinion. There are so many
allusions to plantain leaves you could use, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in
substituting something else.’
‘It’s all very well for you to talk,’ said Bao-yu, mopping the perspiration from his
brow, ‘but at this particular moment I can’t think of any allusion that would do.’
‘Why don’t you put “in spring green waxen sheaths” in place of your “sheathed
skirts of lucent green”?’
‘Where do you get “green waxen” from?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Tut, tut, tut!’ Bao-chai shook her head pityingly. ‘If this is what you are like tonight,
Heaven knows what you’ll be like in a few years’ time when you come to take the
Palace Examina?tion. Probably you’ll find you have forgotten even the Child’s First
Primer of Rhyming Names. It’s from the Tang poet Qian Xu’s poem “Furled Plantains”:

Green waxen candles from which no flames rise.

Do you mean to say you’ve forgotten that?’
The scales fell from Bao-yu’s eyes.
‘Good gracious, how stupid of me! The words are there ready-made and I didn’t
think of them! I shall have to call you my “One Word Teacher”, like the poet in the
story! I shan’t be able to treat you like a sister any more, I shall have to say “sir”
when I speak to you!’
‘Sister!’ said Bao-chai with a little laugh. ‘Stop fooling about and get on with your
poem! That’s your sister, sitting up there in the golden robe. I’m no sister of yours!’
Fearing that he would waste more time if she stayed, she slipped quietly away.
The poem finished, Bao-yu had now completed three out of the four commanded. At
this point Dai-yu, who was still full of dissatisfaction because her talent had been
under?employed, noticed that Bao-yu was struggling and came over to the table at
which he was working. Observing that ‘The Hopeful Sign’ still remained to be done,
she told him to get on with the copying out in fair of the three poems he had already
completed while she thought of something for ‘The Hopeful Sign’. When she had
completed a poem in her head, she scribbled it out on a piece of paper, screwed it
into a little ball, and tossed it in front of him. Bao-yu smoothed it out on the table
and read it through. It seemed to him to be ten times better than the ones he had
written himself. He copied it out in neat kai-shu after the other three and handed the
finished task to Yuan-chun for her inspection.
This is what she read:

The Phoenix Dance

                 Perfected now at last, this place is fit
                 For Bird of Paradise to enter it.
             Bach graceful wand lets fall a dewy tear;
             Each glossy leaf breathes coolness on the air.
             Through narrow-parted blocks the pent stream leaps;
             Through chinks of blind the incense thinly seeps.
             Let none the checkered shade with violence rude
             Disrupting, on the slumberer’s dreams intrude!

*

The Garden of Spices

             Fragrance of flower-drifts in these quiet confines
             Mingles with headier scents of eglantines,
             And summer’s herbs in a soft, spicy bed
             Their aromatic perfumes subtly spread.
             Light mist half screens the winding walks from view,
            Where chilly verdure soaks the clothes with dew.
            Here, slumbering quietly at the fountain’s side,
            The dreaming poet all day long may bide.

*

The House of Green Delight

            In this quiet plot, where peace reigns through the year,
            Bewitching ladies rank on rank appear:
            Some wear in spring green waxen sheaths curled tight,
            Some carmine caps, that are not doffed at night.
            Some from the trellis trail their purple sleeves,
            Some lean on rocks, where thin mists cool their leaves.
            Their Mistress, standing in the soft summer breeze,
            Finds quiet content in everything she sees.

*

The Hopeful Sign

            An inn-sign, through the orchards half-discerned,
            Promises shelter and a drink well-earned.
            Through water-weeds the pond’s geese make their way;
            Midst elms and mulberry-trees the swallows play.
            The garden’s chives are ready to prepare;
            The scent of young rice perfumes all the air.
            When want is banished, as in times like these,
            The spinner and the ploughman take their ease.

Yuan-chun was genuinely delighted.
‘You really have made progress!’ she said. She singled out ‘The Hopeful Sign’ as the
best of the four and changed the name ‘Washbrook Farm’ back to ‘Sweet-rice Village’
by way of acknowledgement. She made Tan-chun copy all ten poems -- Bao-yu’s and
the girls’ -- on to a sheet of fancy paper and sent a eunuch to show it to the
gentlemen outside. Jia Zheng and the others were very complimentary, and Jia Zheng
presented a eulogy of his own composition entitled The Visitation. Yuan-chun also
ordered Bao-yu and Jia Lan to be given presents of junket and mince, both of some
special kind only made in the Imperial kitchens. At this period Jia Lan was still only a
very little boy and did not really know what was going on. He was taken by his
mother Li Wan into Yuan-chun’s presence and stood beside his uncle Bao-yu to make
his little bow of thanks.
All this time Jia Qiang and his troupe of girl players had been waiting impatiently
below for an order to begin their performance. Just as they were reaching a peak of
impatience, a eunuch came running down to them.
‘They’ve finished writing poems,’ he said. ‘Quick, give me a play-bill!’
Jia Qiang hurriedly handed him a list of the pieces they had rehearsed, together with
a brochure containing the stage names of each of the twelve players and some notes
on the parts which each of them played. Four pieces were chosen: ‘Shi-fan
Entertains’ from The Handful of Snow, ‘The Double Seventh’ from The Palace of
Eternal Youth, ‘The Meeting of the Immortals’ from The Han-dan Road and Li-niang’s
death-scene from The Return of the Soul. Jia Qiang supervised the prepara?tions,
and soon the rock-splitting little voices and spell-bind?ing movements of the
actresses had taken over, and the stage was full of passions which were no whit less
overwhelming for being counterfeit.
No sooner had they finished than a eunuch came round, bearing a variety of fancy
cakes and sweetmeats on a gilded salver.
‘Which is “Charmante”?’ he asked, referring to the stage name of the little
soubrette who had played the part of Li?-niang’s maid in The Return of the Soul and
a dashing young huntsman in the ‘play within a play’ in The Handful of Snow.
Jia Qiang realized that the confectionery was a present for the little actress, and
taking the salver from the eunuch, made Mademoiselle Charmante come forward
and kotow her thanks.
‘Her Grace says that she enjoyed Mademoiselle Charmante’s performance the most
and would like to see her in two more pieces,’ said the eunuch. ‘She may choose any
two she likes.’
Having replied to the eunuch, Jia Qiang told Charmante that she ought to play two
more pieces from The Return of the Soul: ‘The Walk in the Garden’ and ‘The Dream’.
But neither had a part suitable for a soubrette in it, and Charmante obdurately
refused. She said she would do ‘The Assignation’ and ‘The Altercation’ from The
Bracelet and the Comb, in which the part of the pert young maidservant would allow
her comic talent a fuller scope. Jia Qiang failed to talk her out of this decision and
had to let her do as she wished. Yuan-chun was delighted, and gave special
instructions that Charmante was to be well treated and to have the best possible
training. She also awarded her, over and above her share of the presents that the
whole troupe would receive in commemoration of her visit, two dress-lengths of
tribute satin, two embroidered purses, and some miniature gold and silver ingots.
The feast was now cleared away and Yuan-chun recom?menced her tour of the
garden, visiting those places which she had not had time to look at before dinner.
When they came to the little convent nestling under its hill, she washed her hands
and entered the shrine-hall to offer incense and pray before the image of the Buddha.
She also wrote an inscription for the board which hung above the image:

THE SHIP OF MERCY ON THE SEA OF SUFFERING

and gave instructions for various extra presents to be bestowed on the little nuns in
addition to those which, along with all the other members of the household, they
were already due to receive in commemoration of her visit.
A list for the latter had already been drawn up and presently it was submitted to
Yuan-chun by a kneeling eunuch for her approval. After reading through it in silence
she approved its contents and asked that they should be distributed forthwith. The
presents distributed were as follows:

To Grandmother Jia:
one golden ru-yi sceptre
one jade ditto
a staff of carved aloeswood
a rosary of putchuk beads
four lengths of ‘Fu Gui Chang Chun’ tribute satin
four lengths of ‘Fu Shou Mian Chang’ tribute silk
ten medallions of red gold with a design showing an
ingot, a writing-brush and a sceptre (which in the
riddling rebus-language used by the makers of
such objects meant ‘All your heart’s desire’)
ten silver medallions with a design showing a stone?-
chime flanked by a pair of little fish (carrying the
rebus-message ‘Blessings in abundance’)

Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Aunt Xue each received the same selection of gifts as
Grandmother Jia with the omission of the sceptres, staff and rosary.

To Jia Jing, Jia She and Jia Zheng (each):
two new books of His Imperial Majesty’s own composition
two boxes of ink-sticks (collector’s pieces)
one solid gold wine-cup
one solid silver ditto
silks and satins as above.

To Bao-yu, Dai-yu, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun (each):
one new book
one inkstone (collector’s piece)
two specially designed medallions in gold
two ditto in silver

To Bao-yu and Jia Lan (each):
one gold necklet
one silver ditto
two gold medallions
two silver ditto

To You-shi, Li Wan and Xi-feng (each):
two gold medallions
two silver ditto
four dress-lengths of tribute silk

(Also twenty-four lengths of silk and one hundred strings of unmixed Imperial Mint
copper cash for the women-servants and maids in attendance on Grandmother Jia,
Lady Wang and the girls)

To Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Huan and Jia Rong (each):
one length of tribute satin
one gold medallion
one silver ditto

There were also a hundred bales of variegated satins, a thousand taels of silver and
an unspecified number of bottles of Palace wine for the senior servants of the Rong
and Ning Mansions and Separate Residence responsible for construction and
maintenance, attendance, theatre management, and light?ing, and an additional five
hundred strings of unmixed Im?perial Mint copper cash for the cooks, entertainers
and Miscellaneous.

When all had expressed their thanks, one of the eunuchs in charge announced that it
was a quarter to three and time for Her Grace to return to the Palace. At once
Yuan-chun’s eyes filled with tears, and even though she forced herself to smile, she
was unable to prevent a few drops from falling. Clinging to Grandmother Jia and Lady
Wang as if she would never let them go, she begged them again and again not to
grieve for her.
‘Now you mustn’t worry about me, my dears: just look after yourselves! Thanks to
the Emperor’s kindness, we are now allowed visits in the Palace once a month: so
you see we can see each other quite easily. It is silly of us to be so upset! And if His
Majesty is gracious enough to permit another Visitation next year you really mustn’t
be so extravagant again on my account!’
Grandmother Jia and the others were now sobbing audibly and were much too
overcome to reply. But Yuan-chun, how?ever hard it was to leave her family, dared
not infringe the regulations of the Imperial Household, and steeled herself to
re-enter the palanquin which was to carry her away. It was all the rest of the family
could do to restrain Grandmother Jia from making a scene, and when she was
somewhat calmed, she and Lady Wang had to be led weeping from the garden in a
state of near-collapse.
What followed will be told in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 19



A very earnest young woman offers
counsel by night
And a very endearing one is found to
be a source of fragrance by day



On the day following the Imperial Concubine’s return to the Palace, she called on the
Emperor to offer thanks and gave him a full account of her Visitation. The Emperor
was visibly pleased by her report and commanded that bounties of gold, silver and
silks should be issued to Jia Zheng and the other fathers of visiting ladies by the Inner
Treasury.
But there is no need for us to pursue these matters in further detail.

The events of the last few days had taxed the energies of all the inmates of the
Ning-guo and Rong-guo mansions to the utmost, and by now all of them were feeling
both physically and mentally exhausted. Even so, Xi-feng forced herself to supervise
the taking down and storing away of all the decora?tions and other movables from
the garden—an operation which took another two or three days to accomplish.
Xi-feng’s duties and responsibilities were so many that she could not evade them and
seek recuperation in rest and quiet as the others did. At the same time, however, the
anxiety to be thought well of and the shrinking fear of criticism that were a part of
her nature made her take pains, even when she was at her busiest, to appear
outwardly as idle and unoccupied as the rest.
Of those idle and unoccupied rest, the idlest and most un?occupied was Bao-yu. On
this particular morning, Aroma’s mother had been round first thing to report to
Grandmother Jia that she was taking her daughter home for a New Year’s party and
would not be bringing her back until late that even?ing. After her departure Bao-yu
played ‘Racing Go’ with the other maids. This was a game in which you moved your
Go-?piece across the board in accordance with the throw of dice, the object being to
reach the opposite side before everyone else and pocket all the stakes.
He was already tired of sitting indoors and was beginning to find the game boring,
when one of the maids told him that someone had just been round from Cousin
Zhen’s inviting him over to the other house to see their New Year lanterns and to join
them in watching some plays. Bao-yu told the maids to fetch his going-out clothes
and help him change. As he was on the point of leaving, someone arrived with a
present of sweetened koumiss from the Imperial Concubine. He re?membered how
much Aroma had enjoyed this drink last time they had had some, and asked them to
put it by for her. Then, having first called on Grandmother Jia to tell her he was
leav?ing, he went over to the other house to watch the players.
The plays they were performing turned out to be very noisy ones: Ding-lang Finds His
Father, Huang Bo-yang and the Ghostly Army, Monkey Makes War in Heaven and The
Investiture of the Gods. All of them, but especially the last two, seemed to involve
much rushing in and out of supernatural beings, and the sound of drums and
cymbals and blood-curdling battle-cries, as they whirled into combat across the stage
with banners flying and weapons flashing or invoked the names of the Buddha with
waving of burning joss-sticks, was positively deafening. It carried into the street
outside, where the passers-by smiled appreciatively and told each other that only a
family like the Jias could afford theatricals that produced so satisfying a volume of
noise.
To Bao-yu, however, a little of this kind of thing was more than enough, and after
sitting for a short while with the rest, he drifted off to seek his amusement elsewhere.
To begin with he went inside and spent some time in bantering conver?sation with
You-shi and the maids and concubines in the women’s quarters. When he went off
once more through the inner gate, the women assumed that he was going back to
the play and made no attempt to detain him. The menfolk —Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian,
Xue Pan and the rest—were engrossed in games of guess-fingers and other convivial
aids to drunkenness, and if they noticed his absence at all, assumed that he was
inside with the ladies and did not comment on it.
As for the pages who had accompanied him: the older ones, estimating that he had
almost certainly come over for the day, gave themselves time off to gamble and drink
with their cronies of to visit friends and relations outside, confident that if they
returned in the evening they would be in time for Bao-yu’s departure. The younger
ones wormed their way into the green-room to watch the excitement and get in the
way of the actors. Bao-yu was left without a single one of them in attendance.
Finding himself alone, he began thinking about a certain painting he remembered
having seen in Cousin Zhen’s ‘smaller study’. It was a very life-like portrait of a
beautiful woman. While everyone was celebrating, he reflected, she was sure to have
been left on her own and would perhaps be feeling lonely. He would go and have a
look at her and cheer her up.
But as he approached the study, he experienced a sudden thrill of fright. A gentle
moaning could be heard coming from inside it.
‘Good gracious!’ he thought. ‘Can the woman in the painting really have come to
life?’
He made a tiny hole in the paper window with his tongue and peeped through. It was
no painted lady he saw, stepped down from her hanging scroll upon the wall, but
Tealeaf, pressed upon the body of a girl and evidently engaged in those exercises in
which Bao-yu had once been instructed by the firry Disenchantment.
‘Good lord!’
He cried out involuntarily, and kicking open the door, strode into the study, so
startling the two inside that they shook in their clothes. Seeing that it was Bao-yu,
Tealeaf at once fell upon his knees and begged for mercy.
‘In broad daylight!’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you think you’re at? If Mr Zhen got to
hear of this, it would be more than your life is worth.’
As he spoke, his eye fell upon the girl. She had a soft, white skin, to whose charms he
could not be insensible. At the moment she was red to the very tips of her ears and
stood there in silence, hanging her head with shame. Bao-yu stamped his foot
impatiently:
‘Why don’t you go?’
The words seemed to bring her to herself, for she turned and fled immediately.
Bao-yu ran after her, shouting.
‘Don’t be afraid! I won’t tell anyone!’
Tealeaf, running out behind him, was frantic:
‘My dear little grandfather, that’s exactly what you are doing!’
‘How old is she?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘Not more than fifteen or so,’ said Tealeaf.
‘You don’t even know her age!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You can do this to her without even
knowing her age! She’s wasted on you, that’s evident. Poor girl! What’s her name?’
‘Ah now, that’s quite a story,’ said Tealeaf with a broad smile. ‘She says that just
before she was born her mother dreamed she saw a beautiful piece of brocade,
woven in all the colours of the rainbow, with a pattern of lucky swastikas all over it.
So when she was born, she gave her the name “Swastika”.’
Bao-yu smiled back.
‘She ought to have a lucky future ahead of her, then. shall I ask them tomorrow if
you can have her for your wife?’
Tealeaf thought this was a huge joke.
‘Why aren’t you watching the plays, Master Bao?’ he asked. ‘They’re ever so good!’
‘I did watch for quite a while,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I got rather deafened and came out
to walk around for a bit. That’s how I found you here. But what are we going to do
now?’
Tealeaf gave a sly little smile:
‘What about going for a ride outside the city? If we slipped off quietly we could get
there and back without anyone knowing.’
‘Too risky,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We might get kidnapped or something. Besides, there
would be terrible trouble if they found out. It’d better be somewhere nearer, so that
we can get back quickly.’
‘Who do we know near here that we could call on?’ said Tealeaf. ‘I can’t think of
anyone.’
‘I know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we go round to the Huas’ house and see what
Aroma is up to?’
‘All right. But I’ve forgotten where they live,’ said Tealeaf untruthfully. ‘And suppose
they do find out you’ve been gadding around outside’ (he added the real reason for
his hesitation) ‘they’ll say I put you up to it, and I shall get a beating.’
‘I’ll see you don’t get into trouble,’ said Bao-yu.
Reassured, Tealeaf fetched the horse, and the two of them slipped out by the back
entrance.
Luckily the Huas’ house was only a few hundred yards from the Ning-guo mansion,
and in no time at all they had reached its gate. Tealeaf entered first and called out the
name of Aroma’s elder brother, Hua Zi-fang.
Aroma’s mother was not long back from collecting the various nieces, on both her
own and her late husband’s side of the family, who had had to be fetched after she
had been to call for Aroma, and the family had only just settled down to their tea
when they heard this voice outside calling for Hua Zi-fang. To the latter’s
considerable surprise and mystification he found, on going outside to look, his
sister’s young master waiting at the gate with a servant. Having first lifted Bao-yu off
his horse, he went back into the courtyard and bawled to the rest inside:
‘It’s Master Bao!’
Aroma was dumbfounded and came running out to discover the cause of this
unaccountable visit. As soon as she saw him she clung to him anxiously:
‘What is it? Are you all right?’
Bao-yu laughed carelessly.
‘I was just feeling bored, so I came over to see what you were up to.’
‘Stupid!’ said Aroma, relieved to find that nothing was amiss. ‘What did you think I
would be up to?’
She turned to Tealeaf.
‘Who else is with you?’
‘Nobody,’ said Tealeaf with a grin. ‘Nobody else knows we’re here.’
At this Aroma became alarmed once more.
‘That’s terrible! Suppose you were to run into someone? Suppose you were to
meet the Master?’ She glanced at Bao-yu fearfully. ‘In any case, the streets are so
crowded now. You could easily get ridden down or something. It would be no joke if
you were to have an accident. You two certainly have a nerve!’ She turned to Tealeaf
again. ‘You put him up to this, didn’t you? Wait till I get back: I’ll tell his nannies
about you. They’ll have you flogged like a felon, see if they don’t!’
Tealeaf pulled a face.
‘Don’t go trying to pin the blame on me! Master Bao was cursing and swearing at
me to make me go with him. I kept telling him not to come. Anyway, we’d better be
going back now, if that’s the way you feel!’
‘You might as well stay, now you’re here,’ said Hua Zi-fang in a conciliatory manner.
‘There’s no point in quarrelling about it. The only trouble is, this is not much of a
place we live in here: poor and cramped and not too clean and that. Hardly a fit place
for the likes of Master Bao, I’m thinking.’
By this time Aroma’s mother had joined them outside to welcome the visitors. Aroma
took Bao-yu by the hand and led him in. He saw four or five girls sitting down inside
who hung their heads and blushed when he entered. Despite their blushes, Hua
Zi-fang and his mother insisted that Bao-yu should get up on the kang with them, as
they were afraid that he would find their house cold. Having installed him on the
kang, they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pour?ing tea.
‘Now don’t you two rush about, Mother,’ said Aroma. ‘I know how to look after him.
There’s no point in your giving him a lot of things he won’t be able to eat.’
As she said this, she took her own cushion that she had been sitting on, put it on top
of a little short-legged kang table, and made Bao-yu sit on it with his feet on her
metal foot-warmer. Then she took a couple of rose-shaped perfume lozenges from a
little purse she was wearing, opened up her hand-warmer, popped the lozenges onto
the burning charcoal, and closing it up again, stuffed it into the front of his gown.
Having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction, she served
him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup.
Hua Zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea. The cakes,
nuts and dried fruits were arranged on their plates, and the plates themselves on the
table, with painstaking attention to symmetry and design. Aroma could tell at a
glance that there was nothing there which Bao-yu could possibly be expected to eat.
But her family must not be offended.
‘Since you’ve decided to come,’ she said to Bao-yu with a smile. ‘we can’t let you go
without having tasted something of ours. You’ll have to try something, just to be able
to say that you have been our guest!’
She took a handful of pine nuts from one of the dishes on the table, and blowing
away the skins, handed them to him on her handkerchief.
Bao-yu noticed that Aroma’s eyes were slightly red and that there were recent
tear-stains on her powdered cheeks.
‘Why have you been crying?’ He spoke the words in an undertone as she handed
him the pine nuts.
‘Who’s been crying?’ said Aroma with a feigned laugh. ‘I’ve lust been rubbing my
eyes.’
Her little fiction was successful, for he made no further comment.
Bao-yu was wearing his dark-red gown with the pattern of golden dragons and white
fox-fur lining, and a sable-lined slate-blue jacket with fringed edges.
‘Fancy!’ said Aroma, ‘you got yourself all dressed up lust to come and see us. Didn’t
anyone ask you where you were going?’
‘No,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Actually I changed because I was going to Cousin Zhen’s. He
invited me over to watch the players.’
Aroma nodded.
‘You’d better go back after you’ve sat a bit longer,’ she said. ‘This is really no place
for you here.’
‘You shouldn’t be too long, either,’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘I’ve got something
nice waiting for you when you get back.’
‘Sh!’ said Aroma. ‘Do you want them all to hear you?’
As she said this, she reached out and took the Magic Jade from his neck.
‘Here’s something that will interest you all,’ she said, holding it out to the others.
‘You know how often you’ve spoken about that wonderful lade of Master Bao’s and
said how much you’d give for a look at it? Well, here it is! Now you can look to your
heart’s content. There you are, that’s all it is! Not so wonderful, really, is it?’
They passed it from hand to hand, and when it had gone full circle and all had
examined it, she hung it once more round his neck.
Aroma told her elder brother to go out and hire the cleanest, smartest-looking cab he
could find to take Bao-yu home in.
‘I can see him safely back,’ said Hua Zi-fang. ‘He won’t come to any harm on
horseback.’
‘It’s not a question of whether he’ll come to any harm or not,’ said Aroma ‘I’m
afraid someone might see him.’
Hua Zi-fang hurried out to hire a cab. The rest of the com?pany, realizing that Bao-yu
had no real business to be there, made no effort to detain him and rose to see him
off. Aroma snatched up a handful of sweetmeats for Tealeaf. She also gave him a few
coppers to buy fireworks with.
‘Mind you don’t tell anyone about this visit!’ she said. ‘You’ll be in trouble yourself
if they find out about it.
She escorted Bao-yu to the gate and saw him into the cab, pulling the blind down on
him as soon as he was inside. Tealeaf and her brother followed behind it with the
horse. When they arrived outside the Ning-guo mansion, Tealeaf told the cabbie to
stop.
‘We’d better go in here for a bit before going home,’ he explained to Aroma’s
brother. ‘Otherwise they might get suspicious.’
Hua Zi-fang acknowledged the sense of this precaution, and lifting Bao-yu from the
cab, helped him up on to his horse.
‘Thank you for your trouble,’ said Bao-yu with a winning smile as he rode into the
rear gate of the Ning-guo mansion.
And there, for the time being, we shall leave him.

*

When Bao-yu left his room for the other mansion, his maids were free to do exactly
as they liked and threw themselves into their amusements with great abandon. Some
played at Racing Go, some at Dice and Dominoes. Everywhere a litter of the spat-out
skins of melon-seeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence.
It was unfortunate that Nannie Li should have chosen such a moment to come
stomping in, stick in hand, to call on Bao-yu and to inquire how he was getting on.
She could see that Bao-yu was out, and the uproar created in his absence by the
maids was deeply offensive to her.
‘Now that I’ve left service and don’t come in very often,’ she said with a sigh, ‘you
girls have got worse than ever. The other nannies can do nothing with you. And as for
Bao-yu: he’s like a six-foot lamp stand that lights up others but stays dark itself; for
he’s always on about how dirty other people are, but look at the mess he allows you
to make of his own room! It’s a disgrace!’
Now the maids all knew that Bao-yu did not care about such matters. They also knew
that Nannie Li was pensioned off now and had no more power over them. They
therefore con?tinued with their fun and took no notice of her. But Nannie Li was not
to be ignored. ‘How is Bao-yu eating nowadays?’ ‘what time does he go to bed?’ She
plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all. One
of them even said, quite audibly and in her hearing, ‘Old nuisance!’
‘What’s in this covered bowl?’ Nannie Li went on. ‘It’s junket, isn’t it? Why don’t
you offer it to me?’ She picked up the gift of koumiss and began to drink it.
‘Don’t you touch that!’ said one of the maids. ‘He was keeping that for Aroma. He’ll
be angry when he gets back and finds out about that. You’d better tell him yourself
you took it. We don’t want you getting us into trouble!’
Nannie Li was angry and embarrassed at one and the same time.
‘I won’t believe it of him,’ she said. ‘I won’t believe he would be so wicked as to
grudge his old Nannie a bowl of milk. Why, he owes it to me. And not only a bowl of
milk, either. Much more precious things than that. Do you mean to tell me that
Aroma counts for more with him than I do? He ought to stop and ask himself how he
grew up to be the big boy he is today. It’s my milk he sucked, that came from my own
heart’s blood: that’s what he grew up on. And you mean to tell me that now, if I drink
one little bowlful of his milk—cow’s milk—he’s going to be angry with me? Well, I will
drink it, so there! He can do what he likes about it. And as for that Aroma. I don’t
know what sort of a wonderful creature you think she is -- a little bit of a girl I picked
out myself and trained with my own hand!’
Defiantly she applied the koumiss once more to her lip and downed it to the last
gulp.
One of the maids, politer than the rest, attempted to placate her:
‘They shouldn’t talk to you like that, Nannie! I’m not surprised you are cross. Of
course Bao-yu isn’t going to upset himself over a little thing like that. He’s much more
likely to send something nice round to you when he hears that you’ve been to see
him.’
‘Don’t you try wheedling me with your airs and graces, young woman!’ said Nannie
Li implacably. ‘You think I don’t know about Snowpink being dismissed that time over
the tea? You needn’t worry. If he makes a fuss about it tomorrow, I shall take the
blame.’
She went off in dudgeon.
Presently Bao-yu returned and sent someone off to fetch Aroma. He noticed
Skybright lying motionless on the daybed.
‘What’s the matter with her?’ he asked. ‘Is she ill? Or has she lost the game?’
‘She was winning,’ said Ripple. ‘Then Nannie Li came along and put her off her
stroke and she started losing. She got so cross that she had to go and lie down.’
‘You shouldn’t all take the old girl so seriously,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just leave her to do as
she likes and take no notice!’
Just at that moment Aroma arrived and said ‘hullo’ to everyone. She asked Bao-yu
where he had eaten and what time he had got back. She also gave her mother’s
regards to the other maids. When she had finished changing out of her holiday attire
and taken the ‘going-out’ ornaments from her hair, Bao-yu asked someone to fetch
the koumiss. There was a chorus of replies from the maids:
‘Nannie Li drank it!’
Bao-yu was about to say something when Aroma cut in with a smile:
‘So that’s what you were saving for me! It was a very kind thought; but last time I
had some of that stuff I took too much, being so fond of it, and gave myself a terrible
stomachache. It didn’t go away until I’d brought it all up again, and it’s put me off it
ever since. It’s a good job really that she did drink it. It would only have got left
around and gone bad. Now what I’d really fancy are some dried chestnuts, if you’d
like to be peeling them for me while I make up your bed on the king.’
Bao-yu was completely taken in by this little ruse, and forgetting all about the
koumiss, went off for some chestnuts and sat down by the lamp to peel them. He
and Aroma were flow alone in the room together. Glancing up with a smile from his
peeling he said,
‘What relation of yours was that girl in the red dress today?’
‘That’s my mother’s sister’s child.’
Bao-yu made appreciative noises.
‘What are you “oo-ing” and “ah-ing” about?’ said Aroma. ‘No, don’t tell me! I know
how your mind works. You think she’s not good enough to wear red.’
‘No. On the contrary,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If she’s not good enough to wear red, I
shouldn’t think anyone is. No, I was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and
how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here.’
‘Because I have the misfortune to be a slave,’ Aroma said bitterly, ‘does that mean
that all my relations ought to be slaves too? I suppose you think every pretty girl you
see is just waiting to be bought so that she can be a servant in your house?hold!’
‘How touchy you are!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Having her to live with us doesn’t have to mean
as a servant, does it? It could mean as a bride.’
‘Thank you, I’m sure!’ said Aroma. ‘But my folk are not quite grand enough for
that!’
Bao-yu was unwilling to pursue a conversation that had become so unpleasant and
went on peeling in silence.
‘Why don’t you say something?’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose I’ve upset you now. Well,
never mind! Tomorrow you can go out and buy the lot of them, just to spite me!’
‘I don’t see what answer I can give when you say things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I
only said what a nice girl she was. I think she is exactly suited to live in a big, wealthy
household like ours. Much more so than some of the lumbering idiots who do live
here.’
‘She may not have that much good fortune,’ said Aroma; ‘but for all that she has
been very delicately brought up -- the apple of my aunt’s and uncle’s eye. She was
seventeen this holidays, and her trousseau is all ready for her to be married next
year.’
‘Hai!’
An involuntary expression of regret broke from him when he heard that the girl in red
was to be married. Already Aroma’s words had made him uneasy; but worse was to
follow.
‘I haven’t been able to see much of my cousins during these last few years,’ she
said with a sigh, ‘and now it looks as if they will all have left home when I do go back.’
There was obviously a good deal more that lay behind this remark. Startled, he threw
down the chestnut he was peeling and asked her:
‘How do you mean, “when you do go back”?’
‘Today I heard my mother discussing it with my elder brother. They want me to
hold out this one year more, then next year they will see about buying me out of
service.,
Bao-yu was becoming more and more alarmed.
‘Why should they want to buy you out of service?’
‘Well upon my word, that’s a funny question to ask!’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not one of
your house-born slaves, my family lives elsewhere. I’m the only member of my family
away from home. There’s no future for me here. Naturally I want to rejoin them.’
‘You can’t if I won’t let you,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I never heard of such a thing!’ said Aroma:

‘Even in palace hall
             Law is the lord of all.

A bond is a bond. When their term of service has ended, you have to let people go.
You can’t force them to stay in service for ever and ever -- especially a household like
yours.’
Bao-yu thought a bit. What she said seemed reasonable enough.
‘But suppose Grandmother won’t let you?’
‘Why shouldn’t she?’ said Aroma. ‘If I were a very excep?tional sort of person, it’s
quite possible that she and Her Ladyship might feel upset at the idea of losing me
and offer my family money to let me stay on. But as it is I’m only a very ordinary sort
of maid. There are any number much better than me. I started off with Her Old
Ladyship and served Miss Shi for a few years. Then I was transferred to you, and I’ve
already been quite a few years with you. They would think it quite natural that my
family should want to buy me out now. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if they let me
go as a kindness without even asking for the money. If you think they wouldn’t let me
go because I’ve served you so well, that’s just ridiculous. Serving you well is no more
nor less than what I’m supposed to do. It’s my job. There’s nothing remarkable about
that. There’ll be plenty of other good ones to take my place when I’m gone. I’m not
irreplaceable.’
Everything Aroma said pointed to the reasonableness of her going and the
unreasonableness of her staying. A kind of desperateness began to seize him.
‘That may be so,’ he said, ‘but if I’m absolutely determined to keep you, I’m sure
Grandmother would speak to your mother about it. If Grandmother had a talk with
your mother and offered her a really large sum of money, surely she wouldn’t
refuse?’
‘I’m sure my mother would never insist,’ said Aroma. ‘And I don’t only mean if you
spoke to her and gave her a lot of money. Even if you didn’t speak to her about it and
didn’t give her any money at all, but simply made up your mind to keep me here
against my will and say nothing, I’m sure she wouldn’t dare object. But your family
has never gone in for throwing its weight about like that in the past, and I don’t
believe it is going to start doing so now. It would be different if I were just an object
you’d taken a fancy to and they could get it for you without any danger of upsetting
the owner by simply offering him ten times the price. But I’m not an object. If you
were to keep me here without rhyme or reason against my will, you’d not only be
doing yourselves no good, you’d be breaking up someone else’s family; and that’s
something I’m quite sure Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship would never be willing
to do.’
For some time Bao-yu reflected in silence. At last he spoke:
‘The long and short of all this is that you are definitely going, is that right?’
‘Definitely.’
‘Who would have believed that so sweet a person could be so faithless and
unfeeling?’ he thought to himself. But all he said was:
‘If I had known all along that in the end you would go away and leave me on my
own, I should never have let you work for me in the first place.’
And with those words he took himself off to bed in a thoroughly bad humour and
composed himself for sleep.
Now Aroma’s mother and elder brother had spoken earlier that day about their
intention of buying her out of service, but Aroma had at once stated that she would
never go back home as long as she lived.
‘When you sold me in the first place,’ she said, ‘it was because you had nothing to
eat and I was the only thing you had left in the house which was worth a bit of
money. I couldn’t have refused to go and watched my own mother and father starve.
But now, fortunately, I’ve got a good situation—one in which I’m not beaten and
sworn at all day long and where I’m fed and clothed as well as the masters
themselves—and the rest of you, inspire of losing Father, have managed to get in the
clear again and are as well off now as you’ve ever been. If you were still hard up and
wanted to buy me out so that you could raise a bit of money by reselling me, there
would be some point in it. But you’re not. What do you want to buy me out for? Why
don’t you just pretend that I’m dead, then you won’t need to think about buying me
out any mote?’
And after that she had had a little cry.
Seeing her so adamant, her mother and brother had natur?ally resigned themselves
to her continuing in service. They did so the more readily as Aroma’s contract was, in
point of fact, for life. In seeking to redeem her they would have had to rely on the
customary generosity of the Jia’s, who, as soon as they were approached on the
subject, would in all probability restore not only the person of Aroma but also the
body-price offered for her, but who were certainly not under any obliga?tion to do
so.
Another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known
fact— already mentioned by Aroma—that the Jia household did not ill-treat its
servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them. Indeed,
the ‘inside maids’—those who, like Aroma, were m personal attendance on members
of the family (and this was true of all of them, no matter in whose apartment they
were employed) were the crême de la crême of the household staff and were even
regarded as a cut above the free daughters of poorer households outside.
Later, when Bao-yu unexpectedly arrived on the scene and they saw how it was
between him and Aroma, the reason for her reluctance to leave service at once
became apparent. It was a factor they had not foreseen; but now they recognized it,
it is a great weight off their minds, and it was not without feel?ings of relief that they
abandoned all further thought of attempting to purchase her freedom.
But to return to our story.
Since early youth Aroma had always been aware that Bao-yu’s character was peculiar.
His naughtiness and intract?ability exceeded those of normal boys, and in addition
he had a number of extraordinary eccentricities of his own which she could scarcely
even have put a name to. Recently he had taken advantage of the comparative
immunity from parental control, afforded him by the all-encompassing protection of
his doting grandmother, to become even more wild and self-indulgent and even
more confirmed in his aversion to serious pursuits than in previous years, and all her
attempts to remonstrate with him met with the same obstinate unwilling?ness to
hear. Today’s talk about buying her out of service turned out to be providential. By
employing only a minimum of deceit, she could use it as a means of ascertaining his
real feelings towards her and of humbling his spirit a little, so that he might be in a
suitably chastened frame of mind for the lecture with which she was preparing to
admonish him. She judged from his going off silently to bed that he was shaken and a
little unsure of himself. Evidently she had succeeded in the first part of her plan.
Aroma had not really wanted the chestnuts. She had pre?tended to do so because
she was afraid that the matter of the koumiss might blow up into an incident like the
earlier one in?volving Snowpink and the tea. By pretending to want chest?nuts she
had deflected him from pursuing it further. She now told the younger maids to take
them away and eat them themselves, while she went over to rouse up Bao-yu. The
face that he lifted from the pillow was wet with tears.
‘Now what do you want to go upsetting yourself like that for?’ she said with a smile.
‘If you really want me to stay, of course I won’t go.’
Bao-yu at once brightened up.
‘Tell me!’ he said. ‘Tell me what I must do to prove to you how much I want you to
stay, since nothing I say myself seems any good!’
‘I know we’re both fond of each other,’ said Aroma. ‘That doesn’t need any proving.
But if you want to be sure of my staying here, it mustn’t only be because of that.
There are three other things I want to talk to you about. If you will promise to obey
me in all of them, I shall know that you really and truly want me to stay; then nothing
- not even a knife at my throat - will ever make me leave you!’
‘Tell me what they are!’ he said impetuously. ‘I promise to obey you. Dearest
Aroma! Sweetest Aroma! Never mind two or three: I would promise if it were two or
three hundred! All I ask is that you shouldn’t leave me. If the day ever comes when
nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash - no, not ash. Ash has form and
substance and perhaps consciousness too. Say smoke. A puff of thin smoke dissolved
upon the wind. When that is all that remains of me, and you can no longer fuss over
me because there is nothing left to fuss over, and I can no longer pay attention to you
because there is nothing left to pay attention with - when that time comes, you may
go or stay as you please!’
‘My dear young gentleman,’ said Aroma exasperatedly, dapping her hand over his
mouth to prevent him saying any more, ‘it’s precisely this way of carrying on that I
was going to talk to you about, and here you go, ranting away worse than ever!’
‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Right. I promise never to talk that way again.’
‘That was the first thing I wanted you to reform.’
‘I’ve reformed already,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I ever talk that way again, you can pinch my
lips! Then what?’
‘The second thing is this,’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t care whether you really like studying
or not, but even if you don’t, I’d like you at least to pretend that you do when you’re
with the Master or any other gentlemen, and not always be making sarcastic remarks
about it. If you could only put on an appear?ance of liking it, he would have less
cause to be angry with you, and could even take a bit of pride in you when he was
talk?ing to his friends. Look at it from his point of view. Every generation of your
family up to now have been scholars. Then suddenly you come along. Not only do
you hate studying --that’s already enough to make him feel angry and upset -- but on
top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it -- and not only
behind his back but even when he’s there. According to you anyone who studies and
tries to im?prove himself is a “career worm”. According to you the Illumi?nation of
Clear Virtue or whatever it’s called is the only genuine book ever written and all the
rest are forgeries. No wonder the Master gets so angry with you. No wonder he’s
every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a
thrashing.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘All right. I won’t say such things any more. In any case, these are all things I used to
say when I was younger and didn’t know any better. I don’t say things like that
nowadays. What else?’
‘You must leave off forever going on about people’s appearance and interfering
with their make-up—and you must give up that filthy habit of stealing people’s
lipstick and eating it on the sly. That’s most important!’
‘I’ll reform! I’ll reform! Is there anything else, now?’
‘Nothing else, really. Just to be a bit more careful about things in general and not
always letting yourself get carried away by your whims and fancies. But if you will
really keep your promise about these three things I’ve mentioned, I will promise
never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry
me away!’
‘Oh, come now! Isn’t that stretching it a bit?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘For eight
bearers and a handsome husband I bet you’d go!’
‘It wouldn’t interest me in the least,’ said Aroma haughtily. ‘“Kind sir, for such
blessing I am not willing.” Even if I did go, I should take no pleasure in it.’
Their dialogue was interrupted by Ripple, who just at that moment entered the
room.
‘It’s nearly midnight, you two. You ought to be in bed. Her Old Ladyship just now
sent one of the nannies round to ask about you and I told her you were asleep.’
Bao-yu asked for his watch and looked. The hand was pointing to half past eleven. He
washed and cleaned his teeth all over again, and taking off his outer clothes, settled
down once more to sleep.

*

When Aroma got up first thing next morning she felt heavy and unwell. Her head
ached, her eyelids were puffy and her whole body was afire. At first she dragged
herself round per?forming her usual tasks, but eventually she could hold out no
longer and had to lie down fully clothed on the kang. Bao-yu at once informed
Grandmother Jia, who called in a doctor. Having taken Aroma’s pulses, the doctor
informed them that she had ‘merely contracted a severe chill and would be all right
after taking a few doses of medicine to relieve the congestion,’ and left after writing a
prescription. Bao-yu sent out for the materials prescribed, and when they had been
duly boiled up and the first draught taken, made her cover herself with a quilt to
bring on a perspiration. Then he went off to see Dai-yu.
Dai-yu was at that moment taking a midday nap. Her maids had all gone off about
their own affairs. Not a sound could be heard from the inside room As Bao-yu lifted
the embroidered door-curtain and entered, he could see her lying asleep inside and
hurried over to rouse her:
‘Sleeping after you’ve just eaten, coz? That’s bad! Wake up!’
His voice woke her. She opened her eyes and saw that it was Bao-yu.
‘Do go away and play for a bit! I’m so dreadfully tired. I didn’t get any sleep last
night and I haven’t been able to rest until now.’
‘Never mind how tired you are,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You’ll do yourself much more harm by
sleeping after a meal. I’ll’ stay and amuse you to keep you awake if you feel sleepy.’
‘I’m not sleepy, I’m tired. I want to rest for a bit. Can’t you go and amuse yourself
somewhere else for a few minutes and come back later?’
Bao-yu gave her another shake.
‘Where else can I go?’ he said. ‘I’m so bored with everyone else.’
‘Chee-ee-ee!’ Dai-yu exploded in a little laugh. ‘All right. I suppose now you are
here you may as well stay. You can sit very, very quietly over there and we will talk.’
‘I should prefer to lie down,’ said Bao-yu.
‘All right, lie down then!’
‘There isn’t a pillow. We shall have to share yours.’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Look at all those pillows in the next room. Why
don’t you get yourself one of them?’
Bao-yu went into the outer room for a look but came back empty-handed.
‘I don’t want any of them,’ he said genially. ‘How do I know some dirty old woman
hasn’t been sleeping on them?’
Dai-yu opened her eyes very wide.
‘You really are the bane of my life!’ she said. ‘Here, take this!’ She pushed the
pillow she had been lying on towards him and got up to fetch another one of her
own to replace it with. The two of them then reclined, facing each other, at opposite
ends of the bed.
Glancing up from her recumbent position, Dai-yu noticed that there was a blood-spot
about the size of a small button on Bao-yu’s left cheek. She bent over him to examine
it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger.
‘Whose nails was it this time?’
Bao-yu lay back to avoid her scrutiny and laughed.
‘It isn’t a scratch. I’ve just been helping them make rouge. A little of it must have
splashed on to my face.’ He rum?maged for a handkerchief to wipe it off with.
Dai-yu wiped it off with her own, clicking her tongue censoriously as she did so.
‘So you’re up to those tricks again? You might at least refrain from advertising the
fact! Even if Uncle doesn’t see you himself, someone else might who thought it an
amusing story to go around gossiping about. He could easily get to hear about it in
that way, and that would make it unpleasant for all of us.’
But her words were lost on Bao-yu. He was preoccupied with a subtle fragrance
which seemed to emanate from Dai-?yu’s sleeve - a fragrance that intoxicated the
senses and caused one to feel rather limp. He seized hold of the sleeve and
demanded to know what perfume she was wearing.
‘Perfume? At this season?’ said Dai-yu with a laugh. ‘I’m not wearing any. “In the
cold winter none smells sweet”!’
‘Well, where does it come from, then?’
‘I don’t know myself where it comes from,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I suppose it might have
come from the wardrobe.’
Bao-yu shook his head.
‘I doubt it. It’s a very unusual scent. Not the kind you would get from a scent-cake
or a perfume-ball or sachet.’
‘I hope you don’t imagine it’s some exotic perfume given me by the Immortals of
the Isles. Even if I had the recipe, I have no kind elder brother to get together all
those flowers and stamens and things and make it up for me. I have got only the
ordinary, vulgar sorts of perfume!’
‘Whatever I say, you are always dragging in things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Very well,
You will have to be taught a lesson. From now on, no mercy!’
Half rising, he pretended to spit on his hands, then stretch?ing them out before him,
began to waggle his fingers up and down in the region of her ribs and armpits. Dai-yu
had always been the most ticklish of mortals, and the mere sight of his waggling
fingers sent her off into shrieks of laughter which soon ended in breathlessness:
‘Oh! Oh! Bao-yu! No! Stop! I’ll be angry!’
‘Will you say things like that any more?’
‘No,’ said Dai-yu, laughing weakly, ‘I promise.’
She proceeded to pat her hair into place, smilingly com?placently:
‘So I’ve got an unusual fragrance, have I? Have you got a warm fragrance?’
For the moment Bao-yu was puzzled:
‘Warm fragrance?’
Dai-yu shook her head pityingly.
‘Don’t be so dense! You have your jade. Somebody has a gold thing to match.
Somebody has Cold Fragrance, ergo you must have Warm Fragrance to go with it!’
‘I’ve only just let you off,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and here you go again, worse than ever!’
Once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and Dai-yu again began to shriek.
‘No! Bao-yu! Please! I promise!’
‘All right, I forgive you. But you must let me smell your sleeve.’
He wrapped the free end of that garment over his face and abandoned himself to
long and prodigious sniffs.
Dai-yu jerked away her arm.
‘I really think you ought to go.’
‘Couldn’t go if I wanted to. Let’s lie down very quietly and genteelly and have a
conversation.’ And he stretched himself out again.
Dai-yu lay down too, and covered her face with a handker?chief.
He tried to arouse her interest with desultory chat—talking for the sake of talking.
Dai-yu took no notice. He tried asking questions. How old was she when she first
came to the Capital? What had the scenery been like on the journey? What places of
historical interest were there in Yangchow? What were its inhabitants like? What
were its local customs? Dai-yu made no reply. Still concerned that she might fail
asleep and injure her health, he tried a ruse.
‘Why, yes!’ he said, as if suddenly remembering something. ‘There’s a famous story
that took place near Yangchow. I wonder if you know about it.’
This was delivered with so straight a face and in so serious a tone of voice that Dai-yu
was quite taken in.
‘Oh? What?’
Mastering a strong inclination to laugh, he began to extemporize with whatever
came into his head.
‘Near the city of Yangchow there is a mountain called Mt Yu-dai, in the side of
which is a cavern called the Cave of Lin.’
‘That’s false, for a start,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ve never heard of a mountain of that name.’
‘There are a great many mountains in this world,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You could hardly be
expected to know all of them. Leave your criticisms until I have finished my story.’
‘Carry on,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Now in the Cave of Lin there lived a tribe of magic mice, and one year, on the
seventh day of the last month, the Oldest Mouse climbed up on to his throne and sat
in council with the rest of the tribe.
‘“Tomorrow is Nibbansday,” he said, “and everywhere in the world of men they will
be cooking frumenty. Since our cave is at present short of dry provender, we should
take this opportunity of replenishing our stores by raiding theirs.” He took a
ceremonial arrow from the receptacle in front of him and handing it to an able
younger mouse, instructed him to carry out a reconnaissance. In due course the Able
Younger Mouse came back and reported that, though he had looked positively
everywhere, there were nowhere more plentiful stores to be found than in the
temple at the foot of the mountain.
“‘How many kinds of grain have they got there, and how many sorts of dried
fruits?” the Oldest Mouse asked him.
‘“There is a whole granary full of rice and beans,” replied the Able Younger Mouse,
“but only five kinds of dried fruits:
the first,       red dates
the second,       chestnut
the third,        peanuts
the fourth,       caltrops
the fifth,         sweet potatoes
‘The Oldest Mouse was highly delighted, and picked up another arrow, he said,
“Who will go to steal rice?”
‘A mouse at once took the arrow and went off to steal rice.’
“Who will go to steal beans?” he asked, picking up another arrow.
‘Another mouse took the arrow and went off to steal beans.’ One by one they
departed on their missions until only the sweet potatoes had still to be arranged for.
‘The Oldest Mouse took up another arrow.’
‘“Who will go to steal sweet potatoes?”
‘A little puny, weak mouse replied,
‘ “I will!”

‘Seeing how young and puny he was, the Oldest Mouse and the other members of
the mousey tribe feared that he would be too lacking in training and experience and
too timid and weak to carry out the task, and refused to let him go. But the little
mouse said,
“‘Although I am young in years and weak in body, I am eloquent and resourceful
and possess unlimited magic powers. I can guarantee to carry out this mission even
more ex?peditiously than the rest.”
“‘How will you do that?” asked the other mice.
“‘I shan’t rush at the job head-on like the others,” said the little mouse. “By just
giving my body a couple of shakes I shall change myself into a sweet potato; I shall
roll myself into the pile of sweet potatoes without anyone seeing me; then --very,
very gently I shall roll the sweet potatoes away, one by one, until there aren’t any
more left. Isn’t that a more ex?peditious way of doing it than the crude and headlong
approach which the others have adopted?”
“That’s all very well,” said the other mice, “but what about this transformation
business? Let’s see you do it first!”
‘“Nothing easier!” said the little mouse with a confident smile. “Watch!”
‘He gave his body a couple of shakes.
‘“Hey presto!”
‘And at once he turned into the most exquisitely beautiful young lady.
‘The other mice all laughed.
‘“No, no, no, you’ve made a mistake! That’s not a sweet potato, that’s a young lady
you’ve turned into!”
‘The little mouse resumed his own shape and smiled at them pityingly.
‘“It is you who are mistaken. You have seen too little of the world to understand.
The vegetable tuber is not the only kind of sweet potato. The daughter of our
respected Salt Commis?sioner Lin is also a sweet potato. She is the sweetest sweet
potato of them all.”’
Dai-yu got up on her knees and, crawling over, planted herself on top of Bao-yu.
‘I’ll teach you to make fun of me, you hateful creature! I’ll teach you!’
She seized his lips between thumb and finger and began to pinch and shake them.
‘Help!’ cried Bao-yu. ‘Mercy! I won’t do it again! It was smelling your beautiful
perfume that put me in mind of the allusion.’
‘Allusion?’ said Dai-yu. ‘You vilify someone else and then call it an allusion?’
Just at that moment Bao-chai walked in.
‘Who’s this talking about allusions? I must hear this!’
Dai-yu invited her to sit down.
‘Look! Who else would you expect it to be? He says a lot of horrid things about me
and then tells me it’s an allusion!’
‘Oh,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Bao I’m not surprised, then. He is full of allusions. The
only trouble is that he tends to forget them at the very moment when they are most
needed. If he can remember allusions today, he ought to have been able to
remember that allusion about the plantain the other night. But no, it just wouldn’t
come, and though everyone else was dying of cold, he was perspiring! Yet now his
memory has come back again. Strange!’
‘Now praised be!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have a nice, kind cousin to stick up for me. You’ve
met your match now,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘Now you are going to get as good as you
give! Now we shall see you paid in your own coin!’
Their conversation was interrupted by a burst of angry shouting from the direction of
Bao-yu’s room.
The occasion of it will be discussed in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 20



Wang Xi-feng castigates a jealous attitude
with some forthright speaking
And Lin Dai-yu makes a not unattractive speech
impediment the subject of a jest



We have shown how Bao-yu was in Dai-yu’s room telling her the story of the magic
mice; how Bao-chai burst in on them and twitted Bao-yu with his failure to
remember the ‘green wax’ allusion on the night of the Lantern Festival; and how the
three of them sat teasing each other with good-humoured banter.
Bao-yu had been afraid that by sleeping after her meal Dai-yu would give herself
indigestion or suffer from insomnia through being insufficiently tired when she went
to bed at night, but Bao-chai’s arrival and the lively conversation that followed it
banished all Dai-yu’s desire to sleep and enabled him to lay aside his anxiety on her
behalf.
Just then a sudden commotion arose from the direction of Bao-yu’s room, and the
three of them stopped talking and turned their heads to listen. Dai-yu was the first to
speak:
‘That’s your Nannie quarrelling with Aroma,’ she said. ‘To think how that poor girl
goes out of her way to be nice to the old woman, yet still she manages to find fault
with her! She really must be getting senile.’
Bao-yu was for rushing over straight away, but Bao-chai restrained him:
‘Don’t go quarrelling with your Nannie, whatever you do! She’s only a silly old
woman. You have to indulge her a bit.’
‘Of course,’ said Bao-yu and ran off.
He found Nannie Li leaning on her stick in the middle of the room abusing Aroma.:
‘Ungrateful little baggage! After all I’ve done for you—and now when I come to call
on you, you lie back there on the kang like a young madam and haven’t even the
grace to look up and take notice of me! You and your airs and graces! All you ever
think about is how to win Bao-yu over to you. Thanks to you he won’t listen to me
any more. He only does what you say. To think that a cheap bit of goods like you that
they only paid a few taels of silver for should come along here and turn the whole
place upside down! The best thing they could do with you would be to marry you off
to one of the boys and send you packing. Then we’d see how you managed to play
the siren and lead young gentlemen astray!’
Aroma at first thought that Nannie Li’s anger arose solely on account of her failure to
get up and welcome her, and had started to excuse herself on that supposition:
‘I’m ill, Mrs Li. I’ve just been sweating. I didn’t see you because I had my head
under the clothes.’
But when the old woman proceeded to go on about leading young men astray and
marrying her off to a servant and what not, she felt wronged and humiliated, and in
spite of her efforts to restrain them, burst into tears of sheer helplessness.
Bao-yu had heard all this, and though too embarrassed to argue, could scarcely
refrain from saying a word or two in Aroma’s defence:
‘She’s ill. She’s having to take medicine,’ he said. ‘If you don’t believe me, ask any of
the maids.’
This made the old woman even angrier.
‘Oh yes! You stick up for the little hussies! You don’t care about me any more! And
which of them am I supposed to ask, pray? They will all take your side against me.
You are all under Aroma’s thumb, every one of you. I know what goes on here, don’t
think I don’t! Well, you can come along with me to see Her Old Ladyship and Her
Ladyship about this. Let them heat how you have cast me off—me that reared you at
my own breast—now that you don’t need my milk any more, and how you encourage
a pack of snotty-nosed little maidservants to amuse themselves at my expense!’
She was in tears herself by now, and wept as she cursed.
By this time Dai-yu and Bao-chai had also arrived on the scene and did their best to
calm her:
‘Come, Nannie! Be a bit more forbearing with them! Try to forget about it!’
Nannie Li turned towards this new audience and proceeded to pour out her troubles
in an interminable gabble in which tea and Snowpink and drinking koumiss mingled
incoherently.
Xi-feng happened to be in Grandmother Jia’s room totting up the day’s scores for the
final settlement when she heard this hubbub in the rear apartment. She identified it
immediately as Nannie Li on the rampage once more, taking out on Bao-yu’s
unfortunate maids some of the spleen occasioned by her recent gambling losses. At
once she hurried over, seized Nannie Li by the hand, and admonished her with
smiling briskness:
‘Now, Nannie, we mustn’t lose our tempers! This is the New Year holiday and Her
Old Ladyship has been enjoying herself all day. A person of your years ought to be
stopping other people from quarrelling, not upsetting Her Old Lady?ship by
quarrelling yourself. Surely you know better than that? If anyone has been
misbehaving, you have only to tell me and I’ll have them beaten for you. Now I’ve got
a nice hot pheasant stew in my room. You just come along with me and you shall
have some of that and a drink to go with it!’
She proceeded to haul her off the premises, addressing a few words over her
shoulder to her maid Felicity as she went:
‘Felicity, bring Nannie’s stick for her, there’s a good girl! And for goodness’ sake give
her a handkerchief to wipe her eyes with!’
Unable to hold her ground, the old Nannie was borne off in Xi-feng’s wake, muttering
plaintively as she went:
‘I wish I was dead, I really do! But I’d sooner forget myself and make a scene like I
have today and be shamed in front of you all than put up with the insolence of those
shameless little baggages!’
Watching this sudden exit, Bao-chai and Dai-yu laughed and clapped their hands:
‘How splendid! Just the sort of wind we needed to blow the old woman away!’
But Bao-yu shook his head and sighed:
‘I wonder what had really upset her. Obviously she only picked on Aroma because
she is weak and can’t defend herself. I wonder which of the girls had offended her to
make her so .
He was interrupted by Skybright:
‘Why should any of us want to upset her? Do you think we’re mad? And even if we
had offended her, we should be perfectly capable of owning up to it and not letting
someone else take the blame!’
Aroma grasped Bao-yu’s hand and wept:
‘Because I offended one old nurse, you have to go offending a whole roomful of
people. Don’t you think there’s been enough trouble already without dragging other
people into it?’
Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her
condition, Bao-yu stifled his indig?nation and did his best to comfort her so that she
might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever. Her
skin was burning to the touch. He decided to stay with her for a while, and lying
down beside her, spoke to her soothingly:
‘Just try to get better, now! Never mind all that other nonsense! It’s of no
importance.’
Aroma smiled bitterly.
‘If I had allowed myself to get upset about things like that, I shouldn’t have lasted in
this room for five minutes! Still, if we’re always going to have this sort of trouble, I
think in the long run I just shan’t be able to stand any more. You don’t seem to
realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you’ve forgotten all
about it. But they haven’t. It’s all scored up against me; and as soon as something
goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it
so unpleasant for all of us.’
She cried weakly as she said this, but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting
Bao-yu.
Soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of Aroma’s medicine.
Bao-yu could see that she had started sweating again and told her not to get up,
holding the medicine for her himself and supporting her while she drank it. Then he
told one of the junior maids to make up a bed for her on the kang.
‘Whether you’re going to eat there or not,’ Aroma said to him, ‘you’d better go and
sit with Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship for a bit and play a while with the young
ladies before you come back here again. I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my
own.’
Bao-yu thought he had better do as she said, and after wait?ing until she had taken
off her ornaments and was lying tucked up in bed, he went to the front apartment
and took his dinner with Grandmother Jia.
After dinner Grandmother Jia wanted to go on playing cards with some of the old
stewardesses. Bao-yu, still worrying about Aroma, returned to his own room, where
he found her sleeping fitfully. He thought of going to bed himself, but it was still too
early. Skybright, Mackerel, Ripple and Emerald had gone off in quest of livelier
entertainment, hoping to persuade Grandmother Jia’s maids, Faithful and Amber, to
loin them in a game. Only Musk was left in the outer room, playing Patience under
the lamp with a set of dominoes. Bao-yu smiled at her.
‘Why don’t you go off to loin the others?’
‘I haven’t got any money.’
‘There’s a great pile of money under the bed. Isn’t that enough for you to lose?’
‘If we all went off to play,’ said Musk, ‘who would look after this room? There’s her
sick inside. And lamps and stoves burning everywhere. The old women were
practically dead on their feet after waiting on you all day; I had to let them go and
rest. And the girls have been on duty all day, too. You could scarcely grudge them
some time off now for amusement.—Which leaves only me to look after the place.’
‘Another Aroma,’ thought Bao-yu to himself and gave her another smile.
‘I’ll sit here while you’re away. There’s nothing to worry about here if you’d like to
go.’
‘There’s even less excuse for going if you are here,’ said Musk. ‘Why can’t we both
sit here and talk?’
‘What can we do?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just sitting here talking is going to be rather dull. I
know! You were saying this morning that your head was itchy. As you haven’t got
anything else to do now, I’ll comb it for you.’
‘All right,’ said Musk, and fetching her toilet-box with the mirror on top she
proceeded to take off her ornaments and shake her hair out. Bao-yu took a comb and
began to comb it for her. But he had not drawn it more than four or five times
through her hair, when Skybright came bursting in to get some more money. Seeing
the two of them together, she smiled sarcastically:
‘Fancy! Doing her hair already-- before you’ve even drunk the marriage-cup!’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Come here! I’ll do yours for you too, if you like!’
‘I wouldn’t presume, thanks all the same!’
She took the money, and with a swish of the door-blind was gone.
Bao-yu was standing behind Musk as she sat looking at her?self in the mirror. Their
eyes met in the glass and they both laughed.
‘Of all the girls in this room she has the sharpest tongue,’ said Bao-yu.
Musk signalled to him agitatedly in the glass with her hand. Bao-yu took her meaning;
but it was too late. With another swish of the door-blind, Skybright had already
darted in again.
‘Oh! Sharp-tongued, am I? Perhaps you’d like to say a bit more on that subject?’
‘Get along with you!’ laughed Musk. ‘Don’t go starting any more arguments!’
‘And don’t you go sticking up for him!’ said Skybright gaily. ‘I know what you’re up
to, you two. You don’t deceive me with your goings-on. I’ll have something to say to
you about this when I get back later. Just wait until I’ve won some of my money
back!’
With that she darted off once more.
When Bao-yu had finished combing her hair, he asked Musk to help him get to
bed—very quietly, so as not to disturb Aroma.
And that ends our account of that day.

*

First thing next morning Aroma awoke to find that she had sweated heavily during
the night and that her body felt very much lighter; but she would take only a little
congee for breakfast in order not to tax her system too soon. Bao-yu saw that there
was no further cause for concern, and after his meal drifted off to Aunt Xue’s
apartment in search of amusement.
Now this was the prime of the year, when the schoolroom is closed for the New Year
holiday and the use of the needle is forbidden to maidenly fingers throughout the
whole of the Lucky Month, so that boys and girls alike are all agreeably un?employed,
and Bao-yu’s half-brother Jia Huan, on holiday like all the rest, had also drifted over
to Aunt Xue’s place in search of amusement. He found Bao-chai, Caltrop and Oriole
there playing a game of Racing Go, and after watching them for a bit, wanted to play
too.
Bao-chai had always behaved towards Jia Huan in exactly the same way as she did
towards Bao-yu and made no distinc?tions between them. Consequently, when he
asked to play, she at once made a place for him and invited him to join them on the
kang. They played for stakes of ten cash each a game. Jia Huan won the first game
and felt very pleased. But then, as luck would have it, he lost several times in a row
and began to get somewhat rattled.
It was now his turn to throw the dice. He needed seven to win, and if he threw
anything less than seven, the dice would go next to Oriole, who needed only three.
He hurled them from the pot with all his might. One of them rested at two. The other
continued rather erratically to roll about. ‘Ace! Ace! Ace!’ cried Oriole, clapping her
hands. ‘Six! Seven! Eight!’ shouted Jia Huan glaring at Oriole and commanding the
die to perform the impossible. But the perverse wanderer finally came to rest with
the ace uppermost, making a grand total of three. With the speed of desperation Jia
Huan reached out and snatched it up, claiming, as he did so, that it was a six.
‘It was an ace,’ said Oriole, ‘as plain as anything!’
Bao-chai could see that Jia Huan was rattled, and darting a sharp look at Oriole,
commanded her to yield.
‘You grow more unmannerly every day,’ she told her. ‘Surely you don’t think one of
the masters would cheat you? Come on! Put your money down!’
Oriole smarted with the injustice of this, but her mistress had ordered it, so she had
to pay up without arguing. She could not, however, forbear a few rebellious
mutterings:
‘Huh! One of the masters! Cheating a maid out of a few coppers! Even I should be
ashamed! Look how much money Bao-yu lost when he was playing with us the other
day, yet he didn’t mind. Even when some of the maids took all he had left, he only
laughed...’
She would have gone on, but Bao-chai checked her angrily. ‘How can I hope to
compete with Bao-yu?’ said Jia Huan, beginning to blubber. ‘You’re all afraid of him.
You all take his part against me because I’m only a concubine’s son.’
Bao-chai was shocked:
‘Please don’t say things like that, Cousin! You’ll make your?self ridiculous.’
Once more she rebuked Oriole.
Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in, and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in,
asked him what was the matter. But Jia Huan dared not say anything.
Bao-chai, familiar with the state of affairs, normal in other families, which places the
younger brother in fearful subjec?tion to the elder, assumed that Jia Huan was afraid
of Bao-yu. She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of
him. ‘We are both equally subject to our parents’ control,’ he would say of himself
and Jia Huan. ‘Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control
him myself - especially when I am the wife’s son and he is the concubine’s? People
already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if
I were to start bossing him about.’
But’ there was another, zanier, notion which contributed to this attitude. Let us try to
explain it. Bao-yu had from early youth grown up among girls. There were his sisters
Yuan?-chun and Tan-chun, his cousins of the same surname Ying?-chun and Xi-chun,
and his distaff-cousins Shi Xiang-yun, Lin Dai-yu and Xue Bao-chai. As a result of this
upbringing, he had come to the conclusion that the pure essence of human?ity was
all concentrated in the female of the species and that males were its mere dregs and
off-scourings. To him, there?fore, all members of his own sex without distinction
were brutes who might just as well not have existed. Only in the case of his father,
uncles and brother, where rudeness and dis?obedience were expressly forbidden by
the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception—and even then the allowances
he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly
never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set
an example to the younger males in his clan. The latter—Jia Huan
included—reciprocated with a healthy disrespect only slightly tempered by their fear
of his doting grandmother.
But Bao-chai was ignorant of ail this; and fearing that Bao-yu might embarrass them
all by delivering a big brother’s telling-off, she hastened to Jia Huan’s defence.
‘What are you crying about in the middle of the New Year holidays?’ said Bao-yu to
Jia Huan, ignoring Bao-chai’s excuses. ‘If you don’t like it here, why don’t you go
somewhere else? I think your brains must have been addled by too much study. Can’t
you see that if there is something you don’t like, there must be something else you
do like, and that all you’ve got to do is leave the one and go after the other? Not
hang on to it and cry. Crying won’t make it any better. You came here to enjoy
yourself, didn’t you? And now you’re here you re miserable, right? Then the thing to
do is to go somewhere else, isn’t it?’
In the face of such an argument, Jia Huan could not very well remain
When he got back to his own apartment, his real mother, ‘Aunt’ Zhao (Lady Wang
was his mother only in name) observed the dejected state he was in.
‘Who’s been making a doormat of you this time?’ she asked him, and, obtaining no
immediate reply, asked again.
‘I’ve just been playing at Bao-chai’s. Oriole cheated me and Bao-yu turned me out.’
Aunt Zhao spat contemptuously:
‘Nasty little brat! That’s what comes of getting above yourself. Who asked you to go
playing with that lot? You could have gone anywhere else to play. Asking for trouble!’
Just at that moment Xi-feng happened to be passing by outside, and hearing what
she said, shouted back at her through the window:
‘What sort of language is that to be using in the middle of the New Year holiday?
He’s only a child. He hasn’t done any?thing terrible. What do you want to go carrying
on at him like that for? No matter where he’s been, Sir Zheng and Lady Wang are
quite capable of looking after him themselves. There’s no cause for you to go biting
his head off! After all, he is one of the masters. If he’s misbehaved himself, you
should leave the telling-off to those whose job it is. It’s no business of yours. Huan!
Come out here! Come and play with me!’
Jia Huan had always been afraid of Xi-feng - more even than he was of Lady
Wang—and hearing her call him, came running out immediately. Aunt Zhao dared
not say a word.
‘You’re a poor-spirited creature!’ Xi-feng said to him. ‘How many times have I told
you that you can eat and drink and play with any of the boys and girls you like? But
instead of doing as I say, you hang about with these other people and let them warp
your mind for you and fill it up with mischief. You’ve no self-respect, that’s your
trouble. Can’t keep away from the gutter. You insist on making yourself disagreeable
and then you complain that people are prejudiced against you! Fancy making a fuss
like that about losing a few coppers! How much did you lose?’
‘One or two hundred,’ Jia Huan muttered abjectly.
‘All this fuss about one or two hundred cash! And you one of the masters!’ She
turned to Felicity. ‘Go and get a string of cash for him, Felicity, and take him round to
the back where Miss Ying and the girls are playing! And if I have anymore of this
nonsense from you in future, young man,’ she went on to Jia Huan, ‘I’ll first give you
a good hiding myself and then send someone to tell the school about you and see if
they can knock a bit of sense into you! It sets your Cousin Lan’s teeth on edge to see
you so wanting in self-respect. He’d have dis?-embowelled you by now I shouldn’t
wonder, if I hadn’t kept his hands off you! Now be off with you!’
‘Yes,’ said Jia Huan meekly and went off with Felicity. When he had got his money,
he took himself off to play with Ying-chun and the girls.
And there we must leave him.

*

While Bao-yu was enjoying himself with Bao-chai, a servant announced that Miss Shi
had arrived, and he hurriedly got up to go.
‘Wait!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let’s go and see her together!’ She got down from the kang
as she said this, and accom?panied him round to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. Shi
Xiang-yun was already there, laughing and chattering away nineteen to the dozen,
but rose to greet them as they entered. Dai-yu was there too.
‘Where have you been?’ she asked Bao-yu.
‘Bao-chai’s.’
‘I see’ (very frostily). ‘I thought something must have been detaining you.
Otherwise you would have come flying here long since.’
‘Is one only allowed to play with you,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and keep you amused? I just
happened to be visiting her. Why should you start making remarks like that?’
‘How thoroughly disagreeable you are!’ said Dai-yu. ‘What do I care whether you
go to see her or not? And I’m sure I never asked to be kept amused. From now on
you can ignore me completely, as far as I’m concerned.’
With that she went back to her own room in a temper.
Bao-yu came running after.
‘What on earth are you upset about this time? Even if I’ve said anything wrong, you
ought, out of simple courtesy, to sit and talk with the others for a bit!’
‘Are you telling me how to behave?’
‘Of course not. It’s just that you destroy your health by carrying on in this way.’
‘That’s my affair. If I choose to die, I don’t see that it’s any concern of yours.’
‘Oh, really, really! Here we are in the middle of the New Year holiday, and you have
to start talking about death!’
‘I don’t care. I’ll talk about death if I like. Death! Death! Death! I’m going to die this
minute. If you’re so afraid of death, I wish you long life. A hundred years, will that
satisfy you?’
‘Do you think I’m afraid of dying when all you will do is quarrel? I wish I were dead.
It would be a relief.’
‘Exactly! ‘said Dai-yu. ‘if I were to die, it would be a relief from all this quarrelling!’
‘I said if I were to die,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t twist my words. It isn’t fair.’
Just then Bao-chai came hurrying in.
‘Cousin Shi’s waiting for you!’
She took hold of Bao-yu’s hand and pulled him after her, to the great mortification of
Dai-yu, who sat with her face to the window and shed tears bf pure rage.
After about as long as it would take to drink two cups of tea, Bao-yu came back again.
During his absence Dai-yu’s sobs seemed to have redoubled in intensity. Seeing the
state she was in he realized that it would need careful handling and began turning
over in his mind all kinds of soft and soothing things to coax her with. But before he
could get his mouth open, she had anticipated him:
‘What have you come for this time? Why can’t you just leave me here to die in
peace? After all, you’ve got a new play?mate now - one who can read and write and
compose and laugh and talk to you much better than I can. Oh yes, and drag you off
to be amused if there’s any danger of your getting upset! I really can’t imagine what
you have come back here for!’
‘“Old friends are best friends and close kin are kindest,”’said Bao-yu, coming over
to where she sat and speaking very quietly. ‘You’re too intelligent not to know that.
Even a simpleton like me knows that much! Take kinship first: you are my cousin on
Father’s side; Cousin Bao is only a mother-cousin. That makes you much the closer
kin. And as for length of acquaintance: it was you who came here first. You and I have
practically grown up together—eaten at the same table, even slept in the same bed.
Compared with you she’s practi?cally a new arrival. Why should I ever be any less
dose to you because of her?’
‘Whatever do you take me for? Do you think I want you to be any less close to her
because of me? It’s the way I feel that makes me the way I am.’
‘And it’s the way I feel,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that makes me the way I am! Do you mean to
tell me that you know your own feelings about me but still don’t know what my
feelings are about you?’
Dai-yu lowered her head and made no reply. After a pause she said:
‘You complain that whatever you do people are always getting angry with you. You
don’t seem to realize how much you provoke them by what you do. Take today, for
instance. It’s obviously colder today than it was yesterday. Then why of all days
should you choose today to leave your blue cape off?’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘I didn’t. I was wearing it this morning the same as usual; but when you started
quarrelling just now, I got into such a sweat that I had to take it off.’
‘Next thing you’ll be catching a cold,’ said Dai-yu with a sigh, ‘and then Heaven
knows what grumblings and scoldings there will be!’
Just then Xiang-yun burst in on them and reproved them smilingly for abandoning
her:
‘Couthin Bao, Couthin Lin: you can thee each other every day. It’th not often I get a
chanthe to come here; yet now I have come, you both ignore me!’
Dai-yu burst out laughing:
‘Lisping doesn’t seem to make you any less talkative! Listen to you: “Couthin!”
“Couthin!” Presently, when you’re play?ing Racing Go, you’ll be all “thicktheth” and
“theventh”!’
‘You’d better not imitate her,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’ll get to be a habit. You’ll be lisping
yourself before you know where you are.’
‘How you do pick on one!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Always find?ing fault. Even if you are tho
perfect yourthelf, I don’t thee why you have to go making fun of everyone elthe. But I
can show you thomeone you won’t dare to find fault with. I shall certainly think you a
wonder if you do.’
‘Who’s that?’ said Dai-yu
‘If you can find any shortcomings in Cousin Bao-chai’, said Xiang-yun, ‘you must be
very good indeed.’
‘Oh her,’ said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I wondered whom you could mean. I should never dare
to find fault with her.’
But before she could say any more, Bao-yu cut in and hurriedly changed the subject.
‘I shall never be a match for you as long as I live,’ Xiang?-yun said to Dai-yu with a
disarming smile. ‘All I can thay ith that I hope you marry a lithping huthband, tho that
you have “ithee-withee” “ithee-withee” in your earth every minute of the day. Ah,
Holy Name! I think I can thee that blethed day already before my eyeth!’
Bao-yu could not help laughing; but Xiang-yun had already turned and fled.
If you wish to know the conclusion of this scene, you must read the following
chapter.




CHAPTER 21
Righteous Aroma discovers how to rebuke her
master by saying nothing
And artful Patience is able to rescue hers by being
somewhat less than truthful

As Shi Xiang-yun, fearful that Dai-yu would pursue her, turned and fled, Bao-yu
shouted after her: ‘She’s tripped: you needn’t worry! She’ll never catch up with you
now!’
And when Dai-yu reached the doorway where he was standing, he spread his arms
across it to stop her getting by and laughingly begged an amnesty for Xiang-yun.
‘Never!’ said Dai-yu, endeavouring to tug one of his hands away from the
door-jamb. ‘I’ll get that Yun if it’s the last thing I do!’
With Bao-yu blocking the doorway and Dai-yu evidently unable to get past him,
Xiang-yun deemed it safe to stop running, and turned to plead with her pursuer:
‘Pleathe cousin, just this once — spare me!’
Just then Bao-chai appeared from behind her shoulder — the smiling peacemaker:
‘I advise you two to make it up, for Cousin Bao’s sake.’
‘I won’t!’ said Dai-yu. ‘You’re all in league against me. You have all come here to
make fun of me.’
‘Oh, really!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who would ever have the nerve to make fun of you? Yun
only said what she said because you mimicked her in the first place. She’d never have
dared to otherwise.’
It is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse
had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in
Grandmother Jia’s room. It was already lighting-up time and Lady Wang, Li Wan,
Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had also forgathered for the meal. When
dinner was over, the company conversed for a while and then retired to their various
rooms for the night—Xiang-yun to sleep with Dai-yu in what had once, in the days
when she lived with Grandmother Jia, been her own bedroom. Bao-yu saw the two
of them back to their room and stayed there talking until well after ten, in spite of
frequent summonses by Aroma.
As soon as it was light next morning, Bao-yu was off again to the girls’ room, shuffling
along in his slippers and with a gown thrown loosely round his shoulders. The maids
Night?ingale and Kingfisher were not yet about, and their two young mistresses still
lay fast asleep under the covers. Dai-yu was tightly cocooned in a quilt of
apricot-coloured damask, the picture of tranquil repose Xiang-yun, by contrast, lay
with her hank of jet-black hair tumbled untidily beside the pillow, a white arm with
its two gold bracelets thrown carelessly out?side the bedding and two white
shoulders exposed above the peach-pink coverlet, which barely reached her armpits.
‘A tomboy, even in her sleep!’ Bao-yu muttered ruefully as he gently drew the
bedding up to cover her. ‘She’ll get a draught on those shoulders, and next thing
she’ll be complain?ing of a stiff neck!’
Dai-yu had by now awakened. She sensed that there was someone else in the room,
and guessing that it must be Bao-yu, lifted her head up to look. Sure enough, it was
he.
‘What are you doing here at this early hour?’
‘Early? Get up and have a look and then tell me if you think it’s early!’
‘You’d better go outside a minute if you want us to get up,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-yu went into the outer room. Dai-yu got up as soon as he had gone out and
roused Xiang-yun. When the two girls had slipped into some clothes, Bao-yu came
inside again and sat himself down beside the dressing-table. Presently Night?ingale
and Kingfisher came in to help the girls with their toilet. Xiang-yun finished washing
first. Kingfisher was on her way out to empty the basin, when Bao-yu called her back:
‘Just a moment! While you are about it I may as well wash too and save myself the
trouble of going back to my own room.’
He came over to where she stood, and bending his head down over the basin,
scooped up two handfuls of water and began washing his face. Nightingale handed
him some scented soap.
‘It’s all right,’ he said, ‘there’s lots in here already.’
Then he asked for a towel.
Kingfisher pursed her lips up derisively:
‘You haven’t changed much, have you?’
Ignoring the sarcasm, he demanded crude salt to clean his teeth with, and after
rubbing it all round them vigorously with a finger, he rinsed his mouth out with water.
That part of his toilet completed, he observed that Xiang-yun had just finished doing
her hair and wandered over to where she was sitting.
‘Coz dear, do my hair for me, will you?’
‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Xiang-yun.
Bao-yu smiled coaxingly:
‘Go on, be a dear! You used to do it for me once.’
‘Well, I can’t any longer,’ said Xiang-yun. I’ve forgotten how to.’
‘It doesn’t need very much doing to it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m not going out anywhere
today. Just a few plaits.’
He continued to coax and wheedle until at last she gave in, and taking his head in her
hands, sat him down in her place at the dressing-table and proceeded to comb and
dress his hair.
Bao-yu never wore any head-covering when he was at home. Instead he had his
side-hair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears
and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the
back. It was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular
intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head. As Xiang-yun plaited, she
noticed that a pearl appeared to be missing.
‘What’s happened to this clip?’ she said. ‘I’m sure it used to be the same as the
other three. Where has its pearl gone?’
‘I lost it,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I expect it fell off somewhere outside and somebody picked it up,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Lucky old somebody!’
‘Who knows whether or not he really lost it?’ said Dai-yu scoffingly. ‘For all we
know he may have given it to someone to have remounted as a keepsake!’
Bao-yu made no comment, but sat fiddling with the toilet articles that crowded the
dressing-table on either side of the mirror. He picked up a pot of rouge, almost
without realizing what he was doing, and sat with it poised in his hand, wanting to
put it to his lips for a little taste, but afraid Xiang-yun would rebuke him. While he
hesitated, Xiang-yun leaned forward from where she was sitting and administered a
sharp slap to his hand, causing the rouge-pot to fall from it on to the dressing-table.
‘Nathty habit!’ she said. ‘It’s time you gave it up!’
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Aroma entered. She concluded from
the scene that met her eyes that Bao-yu had already completed his toilet, and went
back again to attend to her own. Soon after this Bao-chai dropped in.
‘Where’s Cousin Bao?’ she asked.
‘ “Cousin Bao” has no time to spend in here nowadays,’ said Aroma bitterly.
Bao-chai immediately understood.
Aroma sighed.
‘I say nothing against being friendly,’ she said. ‘But this hanging around there
morning, noon and night is another matter. However, nothing I say makes any
difference. It’s just a waste of breath.’
Bao-chai was impressed.
‘One mustn’t underestimate this maid,’ she thought to her?self. ‘She is obviously a
girl of some intelligence.’
And she sat down on the kang with her for a chat. In the course of conversation she
inquired casually about her age, family, and various other personal matters, paying
careful attention to her answers and gaining from them and from the tone in which
they were uttered an increasing respect for this uneducated maid.
Presently Bao-yu came in, whereupon Bao-chai got up and left. Bao-yu commented
on her departure:
‘Cousin Bao-chai seemed to be very thick with you just now. Why should she
suddenly rush off when I come into the room?’
There was no reply, so he repeated his question.
‘Are you asking me?’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t know what reasons you all have for your
comings and goings.’
The expression on her face as she uttered these words was angrier than he had ever
seen her look before.
He laughed.
‘Oh dear! Are you in a rage again?’
Aroma laughed mirthlessly.
‘It’s not for the likes of me to get into rages. But I wish that from now on you would
stop coming into this room. After all, you have got people to wait on you elsewhere.
You don’t really need my services. I shall go back to serving Her Old Ladyship, like I
used to before.’
With that she closed her eyes and lay back upon the kang.
Bao-yu was alarmed to see her in such a state and impulsively rushed over to the
kang to soothe her. But Aroma kept her eyes tightly shut and would take no notice.
Bao-yu did not know what to do. Just then Musk chanced to enter and he turned to
her for help:
‘What’s up with Aroma?’
‘How should I know?’ said Musk. ‘You’d do better to ask yourself that question.’
Bao-yu was so taken aback that for a while he said nothing. Then, finding their
combined hostility too much for him, he got up with a sigh from his suppliant
position on the kang.
‘All right, ignore me then! I’m going off to sleep, too.’
And he slid from the kang and went off to his own bed to lie down.
For a long time there was no sound from him except for a gentle snoring. Judging
that he must be really asleep, Aroma rose from the kang and took a large
travelling-cloak to cover him with. A moment later she heard a gentle thud. He had
whipped it from him and thrown it to the floor as soon as her back was turned. But
when she looked, his eyes were closed as before and he was still pretending to be
asleep. The significance of the gesture did not escape her. She nodded slowly and
regarded the feigned sleeper sarcastically:
‘All right, then! There’s no need for you to get angry. From now on I’ll just pretend
I’m dumb. I won’t say another word of criticism. Will that satisfy you?’
This was too much for Bao-yu. He sat bolt upright on his bed.
‘What am I supposed to have done this time? And what’s all this “criticism” you’re
talking about? If you had been criticizing me it wouldn’t be so bad; but when I came
in just now, you didn’t say anything: you simply ignored me. You went and lay down
in a huff without my having the faintest idea what it was all about, and now you
accuse me of behaving unreasonably! I haven’t heard a single peep out of you yet to
explain what it is that you are angry about I’
‘Your own conscience ought to tell you that,’ said Aroma. ‘You don’t need me to tell
you.’
They were still arguing when Grandmother Jia sent a ser?vant round to summon him
to lunch. He went off to the front apartment, but returned almost immediately after
bolting a single bowlful of rice. He found Aroma asleep on the kang and Musk sitting
beside her playing Patience with some dominoes. He had long known that Musk was
a close ally of Aroma’s, so ignoring them both, he marched past them into the inner
room, raising the door-curtain for himself as he passed through. Musk followed him
automatically, but he pushed her out:
‘No, no, I wouldn’t presume to trouble you!’
She laughed and went back to her Patience, having first ordered a couple of the
younger maids to wait on him in her stead.
In the inner room Bao-yu took up a book and reclined on the kang to read. For a
considerable while he remained engrossed in his reading. When eventually he did
look up, intending to ask someone for some tea, he saw two little maids waiting
there in silence, one of whom - evidently the older by a year or two - was an
attractive, intelligent-looking girl. He addressed himself to her:
‘Isn’t your name “Nella” something or other?’
‘Citronella.’
‘Citronella? Who on earth gave you that name?’
‘Aroma, sir. My real name is “Soldanella”, but Miss Aroma altered it to “Citronella”.’
‘I don’t know why she didn’t call you “Citric Acid” and have done with it,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘Citronella! - How many girls are there in your family, Citronella?’
‘Four,’ said Citronella.
‘And which of the four are you?’
‘I’m the youngest.’
‘Right!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In future you will be called Number Four”. We’re not going to
have any more of these floral fragrances around here. It’s an insult to decent scents
and flowers to give their names to you lot!’
Then he asked her to pour him some tea.
Listening attentively in the outer room, ‘Flowers’ Aroma and her Musky ally — for
whose ears this gibe was intended — were nearly bursting themselves in their efforts
not to laugh.
All that day Bao-yu stayed in his own room, seeing no one. It was gloomy on his own,
with nothing but reading and a little writing for amusement, but he refused to make
use of any of his usual attendants and would have only “Number Four” to wait on
him. Though he did not realize it, she was a designing little minx and endeavoured by
every artifice at her command to get her hooks into him while she had the chance.
After dinner Bao-yu came back flushed and slightly tipsy, having taken a few cups of
wine with his meal. Normally this would have been the occasion for an evening of
hilarity with Aroma and the rest, but today he would have to sit by his lamp alone in
cheerless isolation. The prospect was a depressing one. Yet if he were to go running
after her, it would seem too much like a capitulation, and her nagging would
thenceforth become insufferable. On the other hand, to frighten her into some sort
of compliance by asserting his mastery over her would be heartless. There was
nothing else for it: he would just have to grin and bear it.
‘Suppose they were all dead,’ he said to himself. ‘I should have to make do on my
own somehow or other!’
The thought was strangely comforting. He was able to stop worrying. He even began
to feel quite cheerful. Having instructed Number Four to trim up the lamp and brew
him a pot of tea, he settled down to a volume of Zhuang-zi. Presently he came to the
following passage in the chapter called ‘Rifling Trunks’:

Away then with saints and wise men, and the big thieves will cease from despoiling.
Discard your jades, destroy your pearls, and the little thieves will cease from pilfering.
Burn your tallies, smash your seals, and the common people will revert to their
natural integrity. Break all the bushels and snap all the steelyards, and they will have
no further grounds for dispute. Obliterate those ‘sacred laws’ by which the world is
governed, and you will find yourself at last able to reason with them. If you confuse
the pitch? pipes, break up the organs, unstring the zithers and stop up Shi Kuang’s
ears, people will begin to make proper use of their own hearing. If you abolish all
intricacy of design and brilliancy of colouring and glue up Li Zhu’s eyes, people will
begin to make proper use of their own eyesight. And if you destroy your arcs and
lines, throw away your compasses and set-squares and break the fingers of Chui the
Cunning, people will begin to make proper use of their own skill…

The words wonderfully suited his present mood. He read no further. Impulsively
picking up a writing-brush, and with the inspiration lent him by his tipsiness, he
added the following lines in the margin:

Away then with Musk and Aroma, and the female tongue will cease from nagging.
Discard Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty, destroy Dai-yu’s divine intelligence, utterly
abolish all tender feelings, and the female heart will cease from envy. If the female
tongue ceases from nagging there will be no further fear of quarrels and
estrangements; if Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty is discarded there will be no further
grounds for tender admiration; and if Dai-yu’s divine intelligence is des?troyed there
will be no further cause for romantic imaginings. These Bao-chais, Dai-yus, Aromas
and Musks spread their nets and dig their pits, and all the world are bewitched and
ensnared by them.

Having written these lines, he threw down the brush and went straight to bed.
He was asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow and remained dead to
the world throughout the whole of that night. Waking with the first light next
morning, he sat up in bed to find Aroma lying fully clothed beside him outside the
covers. He roused her with a gentle shake, all yesterday’s un?pleasantness now quite
forgotten:
‘Go to bed properly! You’ll get cold, sleeping like that!’
Aroma had not, on the day previous to this, openly criticized Bao-yu for disporting
himself at all hours of the day and night with his girl cousins because she knew from
experience that criticism was powerless to change him. To alert him to the error of
his ways she had instead adopted a more passive approach. She had confidently
expected this new method to produce a speedy repentance, followed by a swift
return to normal relations; so that when, contrary to her expectation, a whole day
went by without his having manifested the looked-for change of heart, she was left
with no further resources, and as a consequence had been too worried to sleep
properly for the greater part of that night.
But now here he was addressing her normally once more. He must have undergone a
change of heart during the night. She forced herself to ignore him still, in order to
drive the lesson home.
Meeting with no response, Bao-yu reached out his hand to help her get undressed;
but he had got no further than undo?ing the first button when she pushed his hand
away and did it up again. He was at a loss to know what to do with her. With a gentle
smile he took her by the hand:
‘Now - what’s the matter?’
He had to repeat the question several times. She fixed her eyes on him angrily:
‘Nothing’s the matter. But now you’re awake, hadn’t you better hurry over to the
other place to get washed? If you delay much longer, you might not be in time.’
‘What other place?’ said Bao-yu.
Aroma smiled coldly.
‘Why ask me? How should I know? Go wherever you like for your toilet! Let’s make
a clean break from now on, you and I, and perhaps we’ll have a bit less of all this
bickering and making ourselves ridiculous in front of the others. I mean to say, even if
you get tired of going there, you’ve always got your Number Fours and Number Fives
back here to wait on you. But as for the rest of us: even our names are “an insult to
decent scents and flowers”!’
Bao-yu laughed:
‘Do you still remember that?’
‘I’ll remember that if I live to be a hundred I’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not like you: treating
everything I say like so much wind and forgetting in the morning what you said
yourself the night before!’
There was something about her pretty face suffused with anger that Bao-yu found
infinitely touching. He snatched up a jade hairpin that was lying beside the pillow and
snapped it in two.
‘So be it with me if I ever fail to listen to you again!’ he said.
‘What a way to carry on at this hour of the morning!’ said Aroma, hurriedly picking
up the pieces. ‘Whether you listen to me or not is up to you. There’s no need to get
into such a state about it!’
‘You don’t know how worried you make me,’ said Bao-yu.
‘So you feel worried, do you?’ said’ Aroma smiling. ‘Now perhaps you’ll have some
idea what I feel like most 6f the time! – Come on, let’s get washed!’
With that the two of them got up and began their toilet.
Later, after Bao-yu had gone off to the front apartment, Dai-yu looked in
unexpectedly, and not finding Bao-yu in, began idly turning over the books that were
lying on his desk. Chancing to light on the volume of Zhuang-zi that he had been
reading the night before, her eye was drawn to the lines he had written in the margin.
They both vexed and amused her, and she could not resist picking up a writing-brush
and adding the following quatrain on the remaining blank space:

What wretch would here, with scurrile pen,
The text of Zhuang-zi plagiarize,
And, heedless of his own great faults,
Fright others with his wicked lies?

That done, she went to the front apartment to see Grand?mother Jia, and from there
on to Lady Wang’s.
*
She found everyone at Lady Wang’s in a great to-do. Xi-feng’s baby daughter was ill.
The doctor had been called and had just finished taking her pulses.
‘Convey my congratulations to Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian’— the doctor’s diagnosis
was couched in the strange language which custom decrees in such cases — ‘I am
happy to inform them that the little girl’s sickness is the small-pox!’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng at once sent back to inquire whether the child was in any
danger. The doctor made the following reply:
‘Variola is, of course, a dangerous disease, but provided there are no complications,
most cases of it are recuperable. Let the ladies lay in a plentiful supply of sanguis
caudae, or pig’s tail blood, and plenty of essence of mulberry-worm. Applied
externally these will ensure a satisfactory development of the pustules.’
Xi-feng immediately became very busy. A room had to be swept out and prepared for
the worship of the Smallpox Goddess. Orders had to be given to the servants to avoid
the use of all fried and sautéed cookery. Patience had to be told to move Jia Lian’s
clothes and bedding to a room outside - for sexual abstinence, too, was enjoined on
the parents of the sufferer. A length of dark-red cloth had to be procured and made
up into a dress for the child by the combined labours of the nurses, maids and female
relations most closely associated with it. Finally, a ritually purified room had to be
made ready for the two doctors who would take it in turns to examine the little
patient and make up her medicines, and who would not be permitted to return to
their own homes until the customary period of twelve days had elapsed. These
arrangements having been completed, Jia Lian went off to the outer study which was
from now on to be his bedroom, while Xi-feng and Patience joined Lady Wang in the
daily worship and propitiation of the Smallpox Goddess.
Jia Lian was the sort of man who will begin getting up to mischief the moment he
takes leave of his wife. After only a couple of nights sleeping on his own he began to
find abstin?ence extremely irksome and was reduced to slaking his fires on the more
presentable of his pages. But other relief was at hand.
Among the domestic staff at the Rong-guo mansion was a certain drunken,
dilapidated cook, by surname Duo, who, because of his weakness of character and
general uselessness, had acquired the nickname of ‘Droopy Duo’. Two years previous
to this date Droopy’s father had provided him with a wife. She was now just turned
twenty, a fine, good-looking young wanton, always eager to throw herself at
whatever partners opportunity might place in her way. Droopy Duo raised no
objection to her infidelities. As long as he had meat to eat and wine to drink and
money in his pocket he saw no reason to concern himself about anything else.
Consequently there was scarcely an able-bodied male in the Ning-guo and Rong-guo
mansions who had not at one time or another sampled her wares. Because of her
pneumatic charms and omnivorous promiscuity this voluptuous young limmer was
referred to by all and sundry as ‘the Mattress’.
Jia Lian, now separated from the wife of his bosom and fairly frying with unsatisfied
desires, had for some time past been aware of the Mattress’s charms; but though his
mouth had long watered to enjoy them, what with fear of his jealous young wife on
the one hand and fear of his fancy boys on the other, he had so far found no
opportunity of approaching her.
The Mattress, too, had for some time past had her eye on Jia Lian, and it was a
source of regret to her that he had so far proved unapproachable. Learning that he
had now moved to his study outside, she managed to find excuses for passing by that
way three or four times in a day, provoking Jia Lian to a pitch of frantic eagerness
only to be compared with that of a starving rat confronted by some food. He was
obliged to seek the advice of his pages and to promise them rich rewards if they
could procure her for his pleasure. The pages were ready enough to oblige — the
more so as they were themselves old customers of hers - and the request for an
assignation was no sooner made than granted.
At about ten o’clock that night, when all were abed and Droopy Duo lay collapsed on
the kang in drunken slumbers, Jia Lian slipped noiselessly into the room for his
pre-arranged meeting with the Mattress. The mere sight of her proved so potent a
stimulant that without wasting any time on tender preliminaries, he took down his
trousers and set to work at once.
Now this wife of Duo’s had a physical peculiarity which was that as soon as the man’s
body came into contact with her own she felt a delicious melting sensation invading
her limbs, rendering her body soft and yielding to that of her partner, so that he had
the impression of lying on a heap of down; and in addition to this natural
endowment she knew more tricks of posture and more ways of exciting a man with
murmured lewdnesses and amorous cries than a professional prostitute.
As Jia Lian lay on top of her, wishing he could melt into her body from sheer excess of
pleasure, she began to exercise this last accomplishment.
‘Your little girl’s got the smallpox,’ she murmured. ‘While they’re worshipping the
Goddess, you are supposed to keep yourself pure. Naughty man! You’re making
yourself unclean because of me. You must leave me! Go away!’
Jia Lian’s movements became more violent.
‘You are my only goddess!’ he said, panting heavily. ‘I care for no other goddess but
you!’
At this the Mattress began to grow even more reckless in her incitements and Jia Lian
to reveal the more disgusting of his sexual accomplishments.
They lay a long time together when it was over, exchanging oaths and promises,
unable to break apart. From that day on?wards there was a secret understanding
between them.
A day arrived when the smallpox poison had spent itself and Baby’s pustules showed
signs of drying up. After the twelfth day the Smallpox Goddess was ceremoniously
ushered off the premises, the entire family joined in a service of thanks?giving to
Heaven and the ancestors, and there was much burn?ing of incense in discharge of
vows made on the child’s behalf by various of its members, and much exchanging of
congratulations and paying out of rewards. When all this was over, Jia Lian returned
once more to the matrimonial couch. ‘A night after absence is better than a wedding
night’ as the proverb crudely puts it, and certainly the affection shown that night by
Jia Lian for his lady was of more than usual intensity.
Early next morning, when Xi-feng had gone off to Grandmother Jia’s, Patience began
putting away the clothes and bedding that had been brought in from the outer study.
To her surprise she felt something strange in the cover of Jia Lian’s head-rest, and
after groping inside it, fished out a black, silky tress of woman’s hair. Quick to
understand its significance, she hid it in her sleeve and going across to the other
room, showed it to Jia Lian and asked him what it was.
As soon as he saw the hair, Jia Lian rushed forward to snatch it from her. She darted
away, but he seized hold of her, and forcing her on to the kang, attempted to wrest it
from her grasp.
‘Mean thing!’ said Patience. ‘After I’ve gone to the trouble of asking you about it
behind her back, you have to start being rough!’
Just at that moment they heard Xi-feng coming. Jia Lian didn’t know whether to let
go of Patience or make a final effort to obtain the hair. Finally, with a muttered
entreaty, he re?leased her:
‘Angel! Don’t let her know!’
Patience managed to get up just as Xi-feng was entering.
‘Quick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Open up the chest and find that pattern for Her Ladyship!’
‘Yes madam,’ said Patience.
While Patience was looking for the pattern, Xi-feng caught sight of Jia Lian and
suddenly thought of something else.
‘Have we got the things back from the outer study yet?’
‘Yes,’ said Patience.
‘Was there anything missing?’
‘No,’ said Patience. ‘I went through them very carefully, but there was nothing
missing.’
‘Was there anything there that shouldn’t have been?’
Patience laughed.
‘Isn’t it enough that there was nothing missing? Why should there be anything
extra?’
Xi-feng laughed, too.
‘He was nearly a fortnight outside. I wouldn’t bank on his having kept himself clean
all that time. There might have been something left behind by one of his little friends:
a ring or a sash or something.’
Jia Lian turned pale with fright. He grimaced piteously at Patience from behind
Xi-feng’s back, and drawing a finger across his throat, silently entreated her to keep
her discovery hidden.
Patience affected not to notice him.
‘It’s funny you should say that, Mrs Lian. Exactly the same thought occurred to me;
but though I went through his things very carefully, I didn’t find anything suspicious.
If you don’t believe me, you can have a look yourself.’
‘Silly girl!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you imagine that if there were really anything there he
would let us look?’
And taking the pattern from her she went out again. Patience pointed a finger at her
own nose and wagged her head from side to side.
‘How are you going to thank me for that?’
‘You’re a sweet little darling!’
He beamed delightedly and lunged forward to embrace her. Patience dangled the
hair in front of him:
‘You’ll have to watch your step from now on,’ she said. ‘Now I’ve got something to
keep you in order with. If you misbehave...!’
‘All right, you look after it, then. But’ - his tone became entreating - ‘don’t,
whatever you do, let her find out!’
He said this to put her off her guard. As soon as her defences were relaxed he made a
quick grab and snatched it from her.
‘Perhaps you’d better not have it, after all,’ he said with a grin of triumph. ‘If I have
it I can burn it, and then it’s all over and done with.’
He stowed the hair in the side of his boot as he said this. Patience clenched her teeth
in anger.
‘You’re mean! Burn the bridge when you’re safely over the river - that’s your way,
isn’t it? All right then, you needn’t expect me to tell lies for you in future!’
In Jia Lian’s lascivious eyes her anger made her adorable. He felt himself becoming
excited, and throwing his arms round her, he asked her to let him take her. But
Patience struggled free and ran from the room, leaving him doubled up in a fury of
frustrated desire.
‘Little cock-teaser!’ he shouted after her. ‘You deliberately provoked me, and now
you run away!’
‘Who provoked you?’ Patience giggled from outside the window. ‘You shouldn’t be
so randy! Do you expect me to make the Mistress hate me just for the sake of making
you feel comfortable?’
‘You needn’t worry about her,’ said Jia Lian. ‘One of these days when I get my
temper up I’m going to lay into that jealous whore and break every bone in her body.
Then perhaps she’ll know who’s master round here. She watches me like a bloody
thief. She can talk to men when she likes, but I’m not supposed to talk to women, oh
no! If I’m talking to a woman and just happen to get a bit close, she immediately
starts suspecting something. But if she wants to go chattering and larking around
with Bao or Rong or any other bloody male on the premises, that’s supposed to be all
right! You wait! One of these days I’ll stop her seeing anyone at all!’
‘She’s every right to watch you,’ said Patience, ‘and you’ve no right at all to be
jealous of her. She’s always been perfectly straight and above board where men are
concerned; but you — whatever you do you’ve got something nasty in mind! You
make even me worried, never mind about her!’
‘Oh, shut up! ‘ said Jia Lian. ‘You’re all perfect, aren’t you? It’s just me that’s always
up to something nasty! One of these days I’ll make a clean sweep of the lot of you!’
Just at that moment Xi-feng stepped into the courtyard and saw Patience standing
outside the window.
‘If you want to talk,’ she said, ‘why not talk inside the room? What’s the idea of
running outside and bawling through the window?’
‘Don’t ask her!’ said Jia Lian’s voice from inside. ‘She thinks there’s a tiger in the
room and she’s afraid of being eaten!’
‘He’s in there on his own,’ said Patience. ‘What should I be doing in there with
him?’
‘All the more reason for being in there, I should have thought, if he’s on his own,’
said Xi-feng, smiling rather spite?fully.
‘Is that remark intended for me?’ said Patience.
‘Who else?’ said Xi-feng.
‘You’ll make me say something I shall feel sorry for in a minute,’ said Patience; and
instead of standing aside and raising the door-blind for her mistress, she entered
ahead of her, dropped it rudely in her face, and marched angrily through the
sitting-room to one of the rooms at the back.
‘What’s the matter with Patience? The girl’s gone mad!’ said Xi-feng when she had
raised the blind again and let her?self in. ‘I really do believe she is trying to displace
me. You’d better look out, my friend: I’ll have the hide off you!’
‘Bravo! Good for Patience!’ said Jia Lian, who had re?treated on to the kang and
was applauding the comedy from that safer eminence. ‘I didn’t know she had it in her.
In future I shall take that girl more seriously.’
‘It’s you who’ve let her get above herself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I hold you directly
responsible for this!’
‘Oh no!’ said Jia Lian. ‘If you two want to quarrel, I’m not going to stand between
you and take all the knocks, I’m getting out of here!’
‘I’m sure I don’t know where you think you’ll go to,’ said Xi-feng.
‘Don’t you worry, I’ve got somewhere to go to,’ said Jia Lian, and he began to go;
but Xi-feng stopped him.
‘No, don’t go! There’s something else I want to talk to you about.’
But if you want to know what it was, you will have to wait for the next chapter.




CHAPTER 22

Bao-yu finds Zen enlightenment
in an operatic aria
And Jia Zheng sees portents of doom in
lantern riddles

Hearing that Xi-feng wanted to consult him about something, Jia Lian halted and
asked her what it was.
‘It’s Bao-chai’s birthday on the twenty-first,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What do you think we
ought to do about it?’
‘How should I know?’ said Jia Lian. ‘You’ve managed plenty of big birthday
celebrations before in your time. Why have you become so helpless all of a sudden?’
‘There are fixed rules for everything when you are planning a big grown-up
celebration,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but in Bao-chai’s case she’s neither exactly grown-up nor
exactly a child any longer. That’s why I wanted your advice.’
Jia Lian lowered his head and thought for a moment.
‘Why, you’re being stupid!’ he said presently. ‘There’s a precedent right in front of
you. What about Dai-yu? All you’ve got to do is find what arrangements you made in
the past for her and do exactly the same for Bao-chai now.’
‘Do you suppose I didn’t think of that?’ said Xi-feng with scorn. ‘I’m not that stupid!
The point is that yesterday, be?cause of something Grandma said, I started asking
them all their birthdays and ages, and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the
twenty-first Bao-chai is going to be fifteen. Now that doesn’t qualify for a full-scale
celebration, but it is a sort of coming-of-age, and when Grandma heard about it she
said she wanted to sponsor something for it herself. So obviously, whatever we do, it
can’t be quite the same as what we’ve done in the past for Dai-yu.’
‘Well in that case,’ said Jia Lian, ‘take what you did for Dai-yu as a basis and just add
on a bit.’
‘That’s what I’d thought of doing,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but I wanted to see what you
thought before doing anything definite, because I didn’t want to go adding extras on
my own initiative and then have you complaining that you hadn’t been properly
consulted.’
‘You can cut that out!’ said Jia Lian — though not ill-?humouredly. ‘You know you
don’t really mean a word of it! Just stop snooping on me all the time, that’s all I ask.
You won’t hear any complaints from me then about not being consulted!’
With that he walked off: but whither, or to whom, our narrative does not disclose.
It tells us instead that Shi Xiang-yun, having spent a con?siderable part of the New
Year holiday with the Jias, was now on the point of returning home, but was urged by
Grand?mother Jia to wait for Bao-chai’s birthday and not go back until she had seen
the plays. Xiang-yun agreed to stay and sent someone home with instructions to tell
them that she would be returning a little later than planned and to fetch a couple of
pieces of her own embroidery that she could give to Bao-chai as a birthday-present.
Ever since Bao-chai’s first arrival, Grandmother Jia had been pleasurably impressed
by her placid and dependable disposition, and now that she was about to spend her
first ‘big’ birthday in the Jia household, the old lady resolved to make it a memorable
one. Taking twenty taels of silver from her private store, she summoned Xi-feng and
directed her to spend it on providing wine and plays for a celebration. Xi-feng made
this the occasion for a little raillery.
‘If the old lady says she wants her grandchild’s birthday celebrated,’ she said, ‘then
celebrated it must be, and we must all jump to it without arguing! But if she’s going
to start asking for plays as well, all I can say to that is that if she’s in the mood for a
bit of fun, I’m afraid she’s going to have to pay for it. She’s going to have to cough up
something out of those private savings of hers she’s been hoarding all these years -
not wait until the last minute and then fish out a measly little twenty taels to pay for
the party: that’s just another way of telling us we’ve got to pay for it ourselves. I
mean, if you were really hard up, it would be another matter: but you’ve got boxes
and boxes of boodle — the bottoms are dropping out of them, they’re so full! It’s
pure meanness, that’s what it is! You forget, Grannie, when you go to heaven young
Bao-yu won’t be the only one who’ll walk ahead of the hearse. You’ve got other
grandchildren too, don’t forget! You don’t have to leave everything to him. The rest
of us may not be much use, but you mustn’t be too hard on us. Twenty taels! Do you
really think that’s enough to pay for a party and plays?’
At this point the entire company burst into laughter, which Grandmother Jia joined in
herself.
‘Just listen to her!’ she said. ‘I thought I had a fairly sharp tongue, but I’m no match
for this one: “Clack-clack, clack-clack” — it’s worse than a pair of wooden clappers!
Even your mother-in-law daren’t argue with me, my dear! Don’t pick on me!’
‘Mother-in-law is just as soppy about Bao-yu as you are,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve got no
one to tell my troubles to. And you say I’m sharp-tongued!’
Xi-feng’s mock-lugubriousness set the old lady off in another squall of laughter. She
loved to be teased, and Xi-feng’s bantering put her in great good humour.
That night, when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were
standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own
apartments, Grandmother Jia asked Bao-chai what sort of plays she liked best and
what her favourite dishes were. Bao-chai was well aware that her grandmother, like
most old women, enjoyed the livelier, more rackety sort of plays and liked sweet and
pappy things to eat, so she framed her answers entirely in terms of these preferences.
The old lady was delighted.
Next day presents of clothing and various other objects, to which Lady Wang, Xi-feng,
Dai-yu and the rest had all contributed, were sent round to Bao-chai’s. Our narrative
supplies no details.
At last the twenty-first arrived. A dear little stage had been erected in the courtyard
outside Grandmother Jia’s apartment and a newly trained troupe of child actors able
to perform both Kun-qu and the noisier Yi-qiang type of plays had been en?gaged. In
the apartment’s main sitting-room a semicircle of little tables were arranged facing
outwards towards the stage and laid in preparation for a feast. No outsiders were
invited. The guests of honour were Aunt Xue, Shi Xiang-yun and Bao-?chai herself. All
the others invited were members of the family.
Early that morning Bao-yu, not seeing Dai-yu around, went to look for her in her
room and found her still reclining on the kang.
‘Get up and have something to eat!’ he said. ‘The players will be starting shortly.
Tell me some play you like so that I shall know which one to choose!’
‘If you’re so anxious to please me,’ said Dai-yu coldly, ‘you ought to hire a troupe
specially and put on all my favourites. It’s a cheap sort of kindness to treat me at
someone else’s expense!’
‘Never mind!’ said Bao-yu. ‘When we hire a troupe for you, you’ll be able to return
the compliment.’
He hauled her up from the kang, and the two of them went off hand in hand
together.
As soon as they had eaten, it was time to talk about choosing the plays and
Grandmother Jia called on Bao-chai to begin. Bao-chai made a show of declining; but
it was her birthday, and in the end she gave in and selected a piece about Monkey
from The Journey to the West. Grandmother Jia was pleased.
Aunt Xue was now invited to pick a play, but as her own daughter had just chosen,
she refused. Grandmother Jia did not press her and passed on to Xi-feng. Xi-feng
would nor?mally have refused to take precedence over her aunt and mother-in-law,
who were both present, but Grandmother had commanded and must be obeyed. As
she happened to know that the old lady’s partiality for lively plays was particularly
strong in the case of those which had lots of jokes and clowning in them, she selected
a piece entitled Liu Er Pawns His Clothes in order to make sure that this element was
not lacking from the programme. As she had anticipated, Grand?mother Jia was even
more delighted by this second choice.
Next Dai-yu was asked to choose. She deferred to Aunt Xing and Aunt Wang; but
Grandmother Jia was insistent:
‘I’ve brought you young people here today for some fun,’ she said. ‘I want you to
enjoy yourselves. Never mind about them! I didn’t go to all this trouble just for their
sakes! They are lucky to be here at all, having all this good food and enter?tainment
for nothing: you surely don’t think that on top of that I’m going to let them choose
the plays?’
The others all laughed, and Dai-yu chose a play. Then Bao-yu, Shi Xiang-yun,
Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Li Wan each chose a play in turn, after which the
little players proceeded to perform them in the order in which they had been
selected.
When the time came to bring in the wine and begin the feast, Grandmother Jia
invited Bao-chai to choose again. This time she asked for Zhi-shen at the Monastery
Gate.
‘Why do you keep choosing plays like that?’ said Bao-yu.
‘To hear you talk, it doesn’t sound as if all your years of play-going have taught you
much,’ said Bao-chai. ‘This is an excellent play, both from the point of view of the
music and of the words.’
‘I can’t stand noisy plays,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I never could.’
‘If you call this a noisy play,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it proves that you don’t know what
you’re talking about. Come over here and I’ll explain. This Zhi-shen at the Monastery
Gate is a “Ruby Lips” sequence in the Northern mode. That means, musically
speaking, that it is in a vigorous, somewhat staccato style. In fact the musical
excellence of this piece goes without saying. But apart from that, the libretto is good,
too. The words of Zhi-shen’s “Clinging Vine” aria, which is the last but one in the
sequence, are particularly fine.’
Bao-yu was interested, drew his chair closer, and begged her to let him hear them.
Lowering her voice so as not to dis?turb the others, she half-sang, half-recited them
for his benefit:

        ‘I dash aside the manly tear
        And take leave of my monkish home.
        A word of thanks to you, my Master dear,
        Who tonsured me before the Lotus Throne:
        ‘T was not my luck to stay with you,
        And in a short while I must say adieu,
        Naked and friendless through the world to roam.
        I ask no goods, no gear to take away,
        Only straw sandals and a broken bowl,
        To beg from place to place as best I may.’

Bao-yu listened enthralled tapping his knee and nodding his head in time to her
singing. When she had done, he agreed enthusiastically about the excellence of the
words and congratulated her on the extraordinary breadth of her know?ledge.
‘Sh!’ said Dai-yu, looking round crossly in Bao-yu’s direction. ‘Can’t you be a bit
quieter and attend to the play? This is Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate we’re
supposed to be listening to, not Jing-de Acts the Madman!’
Xiang-yun found this very funny.
They continued to watch plays until the evening. Grand?mother Jia had taken a
particular fancy to the little player who had acted the heroine’s parts and the one
who had played the clown, and when the last performance was over, she asked for
them to be brought in to see her. She found them very ‘sweet’ - even more so on a
closer inspection - and asked them their ages. The leading lady turned out to be
eleven and the clown only nine! There were murmurs and exclamations from all
present when they heard this, and Grandmother Jia told someone to give them
delicacies from the table and a present of money each, in addition to what they
would receive as members of the troupe.
Meanwhile Xi-feng appeared to be very much amused about something.
‘The way that child there is made-up makes him look so like someone we know,’
she said. ‘Haven’t any of you noticed?’
Bao-chai knew whom she was referring to, but merely nodded her head slightly
without replying. Bao-yu, too, nodded, but did not dare to reply. Only Xiang-yun was
tactless enough to say anything:
‘Oh, I know!’ she blurted out. ‘Like Cousin Lin, you mean?’
Bao-yu shot a quick glance in her direction; but it was too late. Xiang-yun’s reply had
prompted the others to look more carefully, with the result that they all
instantaneously burst out laughing, so striking was the resemblance. Shortly after
this the party broke up.
During the evening Xiang-yun ordered Kingfisher to start packing. Kingfisher
remonstrated:
‘What’s the hurry? Why not wait till we’re going? There’ll be plenty of time before
we go.’
‘We’re going first thing tomorrow,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What’s the point of staying any
longer? You can see from the looks on their faces that we are not welcome here.’
Bao-yu chanced to overhear this remark and hurried in to her:
‘You’re wrong to be offended with me, coz. The others all know how sensitive
Cousin Lin is, and they wouldn’t answer because they were afraid of upsetting her.
When you sud?denly spoke up without realizing, I knew she was bound to be upset,
and that’s the reason why I looked at you like that. I was worried for your sake,
because I was afraid she would be offended with you. That you should now get angry
with me is really rather unfair. If it had been anyone else but you, I shouldn’t have
minded whether they offended her or not. I shouldn’t have felt that much concern
about them.’
Xiang-yun silenced him with an imperious wave of her hand:
‘You can save your fine speeches for someone else. They’re wasted on me.
Obviously I’m not in the same class as your Cousin Lin. It’s all right for other people
to laugh at her; but as soon as I say anything about her, I’m at once in the wrong. I’m
not really worthy to speak about her at all. She’s the young lady of the house. I’m
only a little nobody!’
‘I was only thinking of you,’ said Bao-yu in great agitation, ‘yet now you put me in
the wrong. May I straightway turn into dust and be trodden beneath ten thousand
feet if I had any but the kindest intentions!’
‘You are too glib with your ridiculous oaths,’ said Xiang-?yun. ‘This is no time for
swearing. You can keep that kind of talk for that sensitive, easily upset person you
were talking about. She knows how to handle you. Don’t try it on me: it makes me
thick!’
With these words she walked off into the inner room of Grandmother Jia’s apartment
and lay down on the kang in a rage.
Very much out of countenance, Bao-yu went off to look for Dai-yu. She must have
been waiting for him, for just as he was entering the room, she pushed him out again
and shut the door. Totally at a loss to understand her behaviour, he called to her
softly through the window:
‘Dai, dear! Dai!’
But she took no notice.
Bao-yu stood there disconsolately, hanging his head in silence. Nightingale knew
what was happening, but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene; so he
continued to stand there like an idiot, until at last Dai-yu thought he must have gone
back to his own room, and opened the door again. When she saw him still standing
there, she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time, and allowed him
to follow her back into the room.
‘There’s always a reason for everything,’ he said. ‘If you tell people what it is, they
don’t feel so bad about it. You can’t suddenly get angry with me for no reason
whatever. What is all this about?’
‘Don’t ask me! said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I don’t know. I’m only a figure of fun - the sort of
person you might compare with a child actor in order to get a good laugh from the
others.’
‘I never made the comparison,’ said Bao-yu hotly, ‘and I never laughed at you. Why
should you be angry with me?’
‘You would like to have made the comparison; you would like to have laughed,’ said
Dai-yu. “To me your way of not comparing and not laughing was worse than the
others’ laughing and comparing!’
Bao-yu found this unanswerable.
‘However,’ Dai-yu went on, ‘that I could forgive. But what about that look you gave
Yun? Just what did you mean by that? I think I know what you meant. You meant to
warn her that she would cheapen herself by joking with me as an equal. Because
she’s an Honourable and her uncle’s a marquis and I’m only the daughter of a
commoner, she mustn’t risk joking with me, because it would be so degrading for her
if I were to answer back. That’s what you meant, isn’t it? Oh yes, you had the kindest
intentions. Only unfortunately she didn’t want your kind intentions and got angry
with you in spite of them. So you tried to make it up with her at my expense, by
telling her how touchy I am and how easily I get upset. You were afraid she might
offend me, were you? As if it were any busi?ness of yours whether she offended me
or not, or whether or not I got angry with her!’
When Bao-yu heard her say this, he knew she must have overheard every word of his
conversation with Xiang-yun. He reflected that he had only acted in the first place
from a desire to keep the peace between them: yet the only outcome of his good
intentions had been a telling-off by either party. It put him in mind of something he
had read a day or two previously in Zhuang-zi:

        The cunning waste their pains;
        The wise men vex their brains;
        But the simpleton, who seeks no gains,
        With belly full, he wanders free
        As drifting boat upon the sea.

and of another passage from the same book about timber trees inviting the axe and
sweet springs being the cause of their own contamination. The more he thought
about it, the more dejected he became.
‘If I can’t even get on with the few people I live with now,’ he asked himself, ‘how
am I going to manage later on...?’
At that point in his reflections it seemed to him that there was no further point in
arguing, and he turned to go back to his room.
Dai-yu realized that he must have thought of something upsetting to go off like this.
But not to be answered was al?together too provoking. She felt the anger mounting
inside her.
‘All right, go!’ she shouted after him. ‘And don’t ever come back! And don’t ever
speak to me again!’
Bao-yu ignored her. He went straight back to his own room, threw himself on the bed,
and lay staring at the ceiling. Aroma knew what the trouble was but dared not, for
the time being at any rate, refer to it. She tried distracting him with talk of other
matters.
‘I suppose there’ll be more plays after today, won’t there? Miss Bao is sure to give a
return party, isn’t she?’
‘Whether she does or not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘what concern is it of mine?’
This was certainly not the sort of answer Aroma was used to getting. She tried again,
smiling breezily:
‘That’s no way of looking at it! This is the New Year holi?days, when their ladyships
and the young ladies are all en?joying themselves. We can’t have you mooning
around like this!’
‘Whether their ladyships and the young ladies are enjoying themselves or not,’ said
Bao-yu, ‘what concern is it of mine?’
Aroma laughed.
‘Seeing that they’re all doing their best to be agreeable, couldn’t you try to do
likewise? Surely it’s much better ail round if everyone will give and take a bit?’
‘What do you mean, “give and take a bit”?’ said Bao-yu in the same lack-lustre
voice as before. ‘They can give and take a bit if they like. My destiny is a different
one:
naked and friendless through the world to roam.’
A tear stole down his cheek as he recalled the line from the aria.
He continued to ponder its words and to savour their mean?ing, and ended up by
bursting into tears and crying outright. Jumping up from the bed, he went over to his
desk, took up a writing-brush, and wrote down the following lines in imitation of a
Buddhist gāthā:
         I swear, you swear,
         With heart and mind declare;
         But our protest
         Is no true test.
          It would be best
          Words unexpressed
          To understand,
          And on that ground
          To take our stand.
After writing it, he was still not satisfied. Though now enlightened himself, he feared
that someone reading his gāthā might not be able to share his enlightenment.
Accordingly, with the words of the ‘Clinging Vine’ aria still running in his head, he
added another set of verses after it to explain his point. That done, he read the whole
through to himself out loud, then, with a wonderful feeling of liberation, went to bed
and fell fast asleep.
Curious to know the sequel to Bao-yu’s departure, Dai?-yu, on the pretext of wanting
to see Aroma about something, eventually came round herself to have a look. Aroma
told her that Bao-yu was already in bed asleep. She was on the point of going back
again when Aroma smilingly detained her:
‘Just a moment, Miss! There’s a note here. Would you like to see what it says?’
She handed her the sheet of paper containing Bao-yu’s gāthā and the ‘Clinging Vine’
poem. Dai-yu could see that they must have been written under the influence of
their recent quarrel and could not help feeling both amused by them and a little
sorry. But all she said to Aroma was:
‘It’s only a joke. Nothing of any consequence.’
She took it with her back to her own room and showed it to Xiang-yun. Next day she
showed it to Bao-chai as well. Bao-chai glanced at the second poem. This is what
Bao-yu had written:
              You would have been at fault, if not for me;
              But why should I care if they disagree?
              Free come, free go, let nothing bar or hold me!
              No more I’ll sink and soar between gloom and elation,
              Or endlessly debate the depth of our relation.
              What was the point of all of that past pother?
              When I look back on it, it seems scarce worth the bother.

Then she read the gāthā. She laughed.
‘I’m afraid this is all my fault. It must have been that aria I told him about yesterday
which started it all. Those Taoist writings and Zen paradoxes can so easily lead people
astray if they do not understand them properly. I shall never forgive myself if he is
going to start taking this sort of nonsense seriously and getting it fixed in his head. It
will all be because of that aria!’
She tore the paper into tiny pieces and gave them to one of the maids:
‘Here, burn this - straight away!’
Dai-yu laughed at her.
‘You needn’t have torn it up. If you will both come with me and wait while I put a
question to him, I can guarantee to drive this nonsense from his mind once and for
all.’
The three girls went round to Bao-yu’s room together.
‘Bao-yu,’ said Dai-yu, addressing him in a heavily mock-?serious manner, ‘I wish to
propound a question to you: “Bao” is that which is of all things the most precious and
“yu” is that which is of all things the most hard. Wherein lies your preciousness and
wherein lies your hardness?’
Bao-yu was unable to think of an answer. The girls all laughed and clapped their
hands.
‘Ha, ha, ha! He can’t reply. For a student of Zen he does seem remarkably obtuse!’
‘You say in your gāthā,’ Dai-yu continued,
‘ “... It would be best
Words unexpressed
To understand,
And on that ground
To take our stand.”

Now that’s all right as far as it goes, but it doesn’t go far enough. I should like to add
a few lines to it. Like this:

But, I perpend,
To have no ground
On which to stand
Were yet more sound.
And there’s an end!’


‘Ah, that’s better!’ said Bao-chai. ‘That sounds like a real “insight”. When the Sixth
Patriarch Hui-neng first came to Shao-zhou looking for a teacher, he heard that the
Fifth Patriarch Hong-ren was living at the monastery on Yellow?-plum Mountain, so
he found employment there in the monas?tery kitchen. When the Fifth Patriarch
wanted to choose a successor, he ordered each of the monks to compose a gāthā;
The Elder Shen-xiu recited this one:

    “Our body like the Bo-tree is,
    Our mind’s a mirror bright.
    Then keep it clean and free from dust,
    So it reflects the light!”

Hui-neng happened to be hulling rice in the kitchen at the time, and he shouted out,
“That’s not bad, but it’s still not quite right.” Then he recited this gāthāof his own:

    “No teal Bo-tree the body is,
    The mind no mirror bright.
    Since of the pair none’s really there,
    On what could dust alight?”

The Fifth Patriarch at once handed him his robe and bowl as a sign that he was to
succeed him. Your improvement on Cousin Bao’s gāthāis on very much the same lines,
Dai. There’s just one thing, though: what about that “koan” of yours he couldn’t
answer? Surely you’re not going to let him get away with it?’
‘Failure to answer means defeat,’ said Dai-yu. ‘In any case, if he were to answer
now, it would hardly count. The only condition I impose as victor is that he should
henceforth be forbidden to talk any more about Zen. You see,’ she told Bao-yu, ‘even
Bao-chai and I know more about it than you do. It’s too ridiculous that you should set
yourself up as a Zen authority!’
Bao-yu had in fact believed that he had attained an En?lightenment; but now
suddenly here was Dai-yu propounding koans he couldn’t answer and Bao-chai
quoting with easy familiarity from the Saying of the Patriarchs — though neither had
shown any evidence of these accomplishments in the past. It was clear that their
understanding of these matters was far in advance of his own. He consoled himself
with the reflection that if they, whose understanding was so superior, were
mani?festly still so far from Enlightenment, it was obviously a waste of time for him
to go on pursuing it. Having reached this comfortable conclusion, he accepted
Dai-yu’s condition with a laugh:
‘Who wants to be an authority on Zen? It was only a joke, any way!’

*

Just then it was announced that the Imperial Concubine had sent someone round
from the Palace with a lantern-riddle which they were to try and guess. After they
had guessed the answer, they were each to make up a riddle of their own and send it
back to her.
As soon as they heard this, the four of them hurried to the reception room in
Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where they found a young eunuch with a square,
flat-topped lantern of white gauze specially made for hanging riddles on. There was
one hanging on it already which they crowded round to read while the eunuch gave
them their instructions:
‘When the young ladies have guessed, will they please not tell anyone the answer,
but write it down secretly. The answers will be collected and taken back to the Palace
in a sealed en?velope so that Her Grace can see for herself who has guessed
correctly.’
Bao-chai went up to the lantern and looked at the riddle, which was in the form of a
quatrain. It was not a particularly ingenious one, but she felt obliged to praise it, and
therefore remarked that it was ‘hard to guess’ and pretended to have to think about
the answer, though in truth it had been obvious to her at a glance. Bao-yu, Dai-yu,
Xiang-yun and Tan-chun had also guessed the answer and were busy writing it down.
Presently Jia Huan and Jia Lan were summoned, and they too wrote something down
after a good deal of puzzling. After that everyone made up a riddle about some
object of their choice, wrote it out in the best kai-shu on a slip of paper, and hung it
on the lantern, which was then taken away by the eunuch.
Towards evening the eunuch returned and reported what the Imperial Concubine
had had to say about the results:
‘Her Grace’s own riddle was correctly guessed by everyone except Miss Ying and
Master Huan. Her Grace has thought of answers to all the riddles sent her by the
young ladies and gentlemen, but she does not know whether or not they are correct.’
He showed them the answers written down. Some were right and some were wrong,
but even those whose riddles had been incorrectly answered deemed it prudent to
pretend that the answers they had received were the right ones.
The eunuch proceeded to distribute prizes for answering the Imperial Concubine’s
riddle. Everyone who had guessed correctly received an ivory note-case made by
Palace craftsmen and a bamboo tea-whisk. Ying-chun and Jia Huan were the only
ones who did not receive anything. Ying-chun treated the matter as a joke and
rapidly dismissed it from her mind, but Jia Huan was very much put out. To make
matters worse, the eunuch went on to query Jia Huan’s own riddle:
‘Her Grace says that she has not answered Master Huan’s riddle because she could
not make any sense of it. She told me to bring it back and ask him what it means.’
Intrigued, the others crowded round to look. This is what Jia Huan had written:

         ‘Big brother with eight sits all day on the bed;
Little brother with two sits on the roof’s head.’.

There was a loud laugh when they had finished reading it. Jia Huan told the eunuch
the answer: a head-rest and a ridge-end. The eunuch made a note of it and, after
taking tea, departed once more.
Fired with enthusiasm by Yuan-chun’s example, old Lady Jia decided to hold a riddle
party. A very elegant lantern in the form of a three-leaved screen was hurriedly
constructed on her orders and set up in the hall. When that had been done, she told
all the boys and girls to make up a riddle - being careful to keep the answers to
themselves - write it on a slip of paper, and stick it on her lantern-screen. Then,
having pre?pared the best fragrant tea to drink, a variety of good things to eat, and
lots of little gifts to serve as prizes, she was ready to begin. Jia Zheng observed the
old lady’s excitement when he got back from Court and came along himself in the
evening to join in the fun.
There were three tables. Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng, Bao-yu and Jia Huan sat at the
table on the kang, while below, Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Xiang-yun sat at one
table and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at another. The floor below the kang was
thronged with old women and maids in attendance. Li Wan and Xi-feng had a table to
them?selves in an inner room.
‘Where’s my little Lan?’ said Jia Zheng, not seeing Jia Lan at any of the tables.
One of the serving-women went into the inner room to ask Li Wan. She rose to reply
out of respect for her father-in-law:
‘He refuses to come because he says his Grandpa Zheng hasn’t invited him.’
The others were much amused when the woman relayed this answer back to Jia
Zheng.
‘He’s a stubborn little chap when he’s made his mind up!’ they said. But they
thought none the worse of him for that.
Jia Zheng quickly sent Jia Huan with two of the old women to fetch him. When he
arrived, Grandmother Jia made him squeeze up beside her on her side of the table
and gave him a handful of nuts and dried fruits to eat. The little boy’s presence
provided the company with something to laugh and talk about. But not for long.
Bao-yu, who normally did most of the talking on occasions like this, was today
reduced by his father’s presence to saying no more than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to remarks
made by other people. As for the rest: Xiang-yun, in spite of her sheltered upbringing,
was normally an animated, not to say indefatigable talker, but this evening she too
seemed to have been afflicted with dumbness by Jia Zheng’s presence; Dai-yu was at
the best of times unwilling to say very much in company from a sort of aristocratic
lethargy which was a part of her nature; and Bao-chai, whose punctilious correctness
made her always sparing in the use of words, even though on this occasion she was
probably the least uncomfortable of those present, said little to advance the
conversation. As a consequence, what should have been a jolly, intimate family party
was painfully unnatural and restrained.
Grandmother Jia knew as well as everyone else that this state of affairs was entirely
owing to Jia Zheng’s presence, and after the wine had gone round for the third time,
she attempted to drive him off to bed. Jia Zheng, for his part, was perfectly well
aware that he was being driven away so that the younger people could feel freer to
enjoy themselves and, smiling forcedly, appealed against his banishment:
‘When they told me earlier today that you were planning to give a riddle party, I
specially prepared a contribution to the feast so that I might come and join you. You
have so much affection for your grandchildren, Mama. Can you not spare just a tiny
bit for your son?’
Grandmother Jia laughed:
‘They can’t talk naturally while you are here. All you are doing is making it gloomy
for me. I can’t abide it. Well, if you’ve come to answer riddles, I’ll give you a riddle.
But if you can’t guess the answer, you will have to pay me a for?feit.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Jia Zheng eagerly. ‘And if I guess right, I shall expect to be given
a prize.’
‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The monkey’s tail reaches from tree-top to
ground. It’s the name of a fruit.’
Jia Zheng knew that the answer to this hoary old chestnut was ‘a longan’ (long ‘un),
but pretended not to, and made all kinds of absurd guesses, each time incurring the
obligation to pay his mother a forfeit, before finally giving the right answer and
receiving the old lady’s prize. Then he propounded a riddle of his own for her:


‘My body’s square,
Iron-hard am I.
I speak no word,
But words supply.


—It’s a useful object.’
He whispered the answer to Bao-yu, who, readily understand?ing what was expected
of him, surreptitiously passed it on to Grandmother Jia. The old lady, having thought
for a bit and decided that it sounded all right, said:
‘An inkstone.’
‘Bravo, Mamma! Right first time!’ said Jia Zheng, and turn?ing round to address the
servants, he asked them to bring in the presents for Lady Jia. There was an answering
call from the women below, and presently a number of them came for?ward bearing
trays and boxes of various shapes and sizes which they handed up onto the kang.
Grandmother Jia examined them one by one. They all contained traditional Lantern
Festival presents, but in new and exquisite designs and of the very highest quality.
The old lady was obviously pleased.
‘Come, children!’ she commanded jovially. ‘Give the Master a drink!’
Bao-yu stood up and poured wine from the wine-kettle into a little cup and Ying-chun
handed it ceremoniously to her uncle.
‘Have a look at the riddles on the screen,’ said Grandmother Jia when Jia Zheng,
with equal ceremony, had drained the cup. ‘They were all made up by the children.
See if you can tell me the answers.’
Jia Zheng rose from his seat and went up to the lantern-screen. The first riddle he
saw was Yuan-chun’s:

At my coming the devils turn pallid with wonder.
My body’s all folds and my voice is like thunder.
 When, alarmed by the sound of my thunderous crash,
       You look round, I have already turned into ash.
                               An object of amusement.


‘Would that be a firework?’ said Jia Zheng.
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu.
Jia Zheng looked again, this time at Ying-chun’s:

         Man’s works and heaven’s laws I execute.
Without heaven’s laws, my workings bear no fruit.
Why am I agitated all day long?
For fear my calculations may be wrong.
A useful object.
          ‘An abacus?’
          There was a laugh from Ying-chun:
      ‘Yes.’
     The next riddle was Tan-chun’s:

In spring the little boys look up and stare
To see me ride so proudly in the air.
My strength all goes when once the bond is parted,
And on the wind I drift off broken-hearted.
An object of amusement.


‘It looks as if that ought to be a kite’, said Jia Zheng.
‘Yes,’ said Tan-chun.
The next riddle he looked at was Dai-yu’s:

At court levée my smoke is in your sleeve:
             Music and beds to other sorts I leave.
             With me, at dawn you need no watchman’s cry,
             At night no maid to bring a fresh supply.
             My head burns through the night and through the day,
             And year by year my heart consumes away.
The precious moments I would have you spare:
But come fair, foul, or fine, I do not care.
            A useful object.
‘That must be an incense-clock.’
Bao-yu answered for her:
‘Yes.’
   Jia Zheng looked at the next riddle:

Southward you stare,
He’ll northward glare.
Grieve, and he’s sad.
Laugh, and he’s glad.
A useful object.


‘Very good!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If the answer is “a mirror”, it is a very good riddle.’
Bao-yu laughed:
‘That is the answer.’
‘Who is it by?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘There is no name on it.’
‘I expect that one is by Bao-yu,’ said Grandmother Jia.
Jia Zheng said nothing and passed on to the next one in silence. It was by Bao-chai:

    My ‘eyes’ cannot see and I’m hollow inside.
    When the lotuses surface, I’ll be by your side.
    When the autumn leaves fall I shall bid you adieu,
    For our marriage must end when the summer is through.
        A useful object.

Jia Zheng knew that the answer must be ‘a bamboo wife’, as they call those
wickerwork cylinders which are put between the bedclothes in summertime to make
them cooler; but a growing awareness that all the girls’ verses contained images of
grief and loss was by now so much affecting him that he felt quite unable to go on.
‘Enough is enough!’ he thought. ‘What can it be that makes these innocent young
creatures all produce language that is so tragic and inauspicious? It is almost as if
they were all destined to be unfortunate and short-lived and were un?consciously
foretelling their destiny.’
The gloom into which this reflection plunged him was evident in the melancholy
expression on his face and in his bowed and dejected stance. Grandmother Jia
noticed it but attributed it to fatigue. She feared that in this melancholy mood his
continued presence would place an even greater restraint on the young folk’s gaiety.
‘I think you really oughtn’t to stay,’ she said. ‘Why don’t you go and lie down? The
rest of us will sit up for a bit, but I don’t expect we shall go on very much longer.’
‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng, roused from his reverie by her voice. ‘Yes, of course.’
But he forced himself to resume his former jovial manner and to drink another cup or
two of wine with her before finally retiring. Back in his own apartment, he became
lost in reverie once more; but whichever direction his thoughts took him in, he
remained melancholy and troubled.
Meanwhile the party he had just left was proceeding some?what differently.
‘Now, my dears, you can enjoy yourselves!’ Grandmother Jia said as soon as he had
left the room; and the words were no sooner out of her mouth than Bao-yu leaped
up from his seat and over to the screen and began criticizing the riddles on it - this
one had a line wrong here — that one’s words didn’t suit the subject — pointing with
his finger and capering about for all the world like a captive monkey that had just
been let off its chain.
‘Can’t we sit down and enjoy ourselves quietly, as we were doing just now,’ said
Dai-yu, ‘instead of all this prancing about?’
Xi-feng put in a word too, emerging from the inner room to say it:
‘You ought to have Uncle Zheng with you every day and never budge an inch from
his side!’ She turned to the others: ‘What a pity I didn’t think of it at the time: we
ought to have got Uncle to make him compose some more riddles for us. Then we
should have seen him sweat!’
Bao-yu was greatly exasperated by this remark and tried to seize hold of her. Xi-feng
tried to ward him off, and the result was that the two of them became locked in a
sort of playful wrestling-match.
Grandmother Jia continued for a while to laugh and joke with Li Wan and the girls,
but soon began to feel tired and sleepy. The night-drum was sounding, and when
they stopped to listen they found it was already the beginning of the fourth watch.
She ordered the food to be cleared away, telling the servants that they might have
what was left over for them?selves.
‘Time for bed, children!’ she said, rising to her feet. ‘We can do this again tomorrow,
if you like; but now we must have some sleep.’
With that the party gradually broke up and they all dis?persed to their rooms.
What happened thereafter will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 23

Words from the ‘Western Chamber’ supply
a joke that offends
And songs from the ‘Soul’s Return’ move a
tender heart to anguish

Some time after her return from the Visitation the Imperial Concubine commissioned
Tan-chun to make her a copy of all the poems about Prospect Garden that had been
written during her visit, and having rearranged them in what she considered to be
their order of merit, further instructed that they should be engraved on stone in the
Prospect Garden itself — a lasting memorial to the precocious talent of her gifted
family. In pursuance of these instructions, Jia Zheng ordered his people to look out
the best craftsmen available to prepare and engrave the stone and delegated Cousin
Zhen to supervise the work with Jia Rong and Jia Qiang as his lieutenants. As Jia
Qiang proved to be fully occupied with his twelve young actresses — not to mention
their costumes, pro?perties and other paraphernalia — three other junior members
of the clan, Jia Chang, Jia Ling and Jia Ping, were called in to supervise the labour in
his stead. In due course the preliminary stages of waxing, scratching and ‘redding in’
had commenced, and work on the memorial proceeded according to plan. We pass
from this to other matters.
The twenty-four little Buddhist and Taoist nuns having now been moved out of the
two miniature temples in the garden, Jia Zheng had been thinking of dispersing them
among various temples and convents about the city, when a certain Zhou-shi, the
widow of a poor relation of the Rong-guo Jias who lived near by in North Dukes
Street, chanced to get wind of this matter and saw in it the possibility of some
employment.
Zhou-shi had for some time past been meaning to ask Jia Zheng if he would find her
boy Jia Qin a job — no matter how small a job as long as it would bring them in a
little income — and now, hearing this news about the nuns, she drove incontinent
forth to Xi-feng as fast as cab could carry her and besought her to use her influence
on the boy’s behalf.
Xi-feng had always found Zhou-shi a pleasant, unassuming sort of body and was
disposed to help her. Having agreed to do so, and having rehearsed her line of
approach, she went in to Lady Wang and broached the matter with her in the
follow?ing manner.
‘These little Buddhist and Taoist nuns,’ she said, ‘— we definitely ought not to send
them away. We shall need them again if Her Grace ever comes on another visit, and
it will be a terrible job getting them together again if they have all been dispersed. If
you ask me, the best thing would be to move them to the Temple of the Iron
Threshold where they would still be under our control. It would only be a question of
sending someone out there every month with a bit of money to pay for their
housekeeping; then if there is ever any question of needing them again, we have only
to say the word and they can be with us immediately without any trouble.’
The suggestion pleased Jia Zheng when it was in due course relayed to him by Lady
Wang.
‘Of course. That is just what we should do. I am glad you reminded me.’
From Jia Zheng a summons arrived for Jia Lian while he and Xi-feng were at dinner.
He laid down his chopsticks and rose to go, but Xi-feng put a hand out and detained
him:
‘Not so fast! Listen to me! If it’s anything else, never mind; but if it’s about those
little nuns...’ — and she went on to tell him exactly what he should say in that event
and to impress on him how important it was that he should say it.
Jia Lian smiled and shook his head:
‘Sorry, nothing doing! You’ll have to ask him yourself - if you think you know how
to!’
Xi-feng’s back stiffened. She laid down her chopsticks and looked at Jia Lian. There
was a glint in her eye and a dangerous little smile on her face when she spoke:
‘Do you mean that, or are you joking ?’
‘That boy of my cousin’s widow who lives in West Lane, Jia Yun, has been on at me
two or three times about getting him a job, and I promised to do something for him if
he would wait. Now here at last a job comes along and, as usual, you want to snap it
up yourself.’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Xi-feng consolingly. ‘Her Grace has mentioned that she wants a
lot of planting done - pines and cypresses - in the north-east section of the garden,
and she has also asked for more shrubs and flowers to be planted round the foot of
the main hall. I promise you that as soon as that job comes up your Jia Yun shall be
placed in charge of it.’
‘Oh well, in that case all right,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Just one thing, though’ — he dropped
his voice and smiled at her slily — ‘Why did you keep pushing me off like that last
night? I only wanted to try a change of position.’
A quick flush overspread Xi-feng’s face and she exploded in a little laugh. Then with a
‘pshaw!’ in his direction, she lowered her head again and went back to her meal.
Jia Lian laughed and slipped away. On entering Jia Zheng’s presence he found that
the subject was, as Xi-feng had antici?pated, the arrangements for accommodating
the little nuns, and he replied as Xi-feng had instructed him:
‘Jia Qin is a promising young fellow. I think he could be entrusted with the job. In
any case, he would be drawing the allowance from Accounts each month when all
the other pay?ments are made, so we should be able to keep an eye on him.’
Jia Zheng never took much interest in these trivial domestic matters and agreed
readily enough to Jia Lian’s suggestion. The latter returned to his apartment and
reported to Xi-feng. Xi-feng sent someone to inform Zhou-shi; and soon Jia Qin
himself had arrived and was pouring out his gratitude to the two benefactors. With a
show of conferring further favours, Xi-feng ‘begged’ Jia Lian to allow Jia Qin three
months’ payment in advance. A receipt was written for this amount and Jia Lian’s seal
affixed to it, and there and then Jia Qin was issued with a tally and sent to the
counting-house to collect the money.
When the three hundred taels of shining silver had been weighed and counted and
handed over, Jia Qin picked up a piece at random and tossed it to the cashiers to ‘buy
themselves a cup of tea with’. He had a boy to carry the money back home for him,
and after taking counsel with his mother he hired a stout little donkey for himself to
ride on and four or five covered mule-carts for the nuns, and conducting the carts
round to the side gate of the Rong-guo mansion, he called forth the twenty-four little
nuns and packed them all inside. Then off they set, with Jia Qin on his donkey at the
head of the procession, to the Temple of the Iron Threshold outside the city. And
there we leave them.

*

Yuan-chun’s editing of the Prospect Garden poems had given her a vivid recollection
of the garden’s beauties. She was sure that her father, out of a zealous reverence for
the Emperor and herself, would have kept it all locked and closed since her visit and
would have allowed no one else to enter, and she felt this to be a waste and a shame
— the more so when her family contained so many poetical young ladies who would
have found inspiration in its scenery — not to mention the benefit their presence
would have bestowed on the garden itself: for, as is well-known,

             When lovely woman smiles not,
             All Nature’s charms are dead.
Assuredly, the girls must be allowed into the garden. It should become their home.
And if the girls, why not Bao-yu? He had grown up in their midst. He was different
from other boys. If he were not allowed into the garden as well, he would consider
himself left out in the cold, and his distress would cause Lady Wang and
Grandmother Jia to feel unhappy too. Unquestionably she should ask for him to be
admitted along with the girls. Having reached this decision, she summoned the
eunuch Xia Bing-zhong and ordered him to convey the following Edict to Rong-guo
House:

Bao-chai and the other young ladies of the household are to reside in the Garden.
The Garden is not to be kept closed. Bao-yu is to accompany the young ladies into
the Garden and to continue his studies there.

The Edict was received by Jia Zheng and Lady Wang. When Xia Bing-zhong had gone,
they reported it at once to Grandmother Jia and sent servants into the garden to
sweep and prepare its buildings and rehang the blinds, portières and bed-curtains in
readiness for occupation.
No one was more excited by the prospect of this move than Bao-yu. He was
discussing it animatedly with Grandmother Jia (it was a discussion in which the words
‘I want’ recurred rather frequently) when suddenly a maid came in and an?nounced
that he was wanted by his father. At this bolt from the blue his countenance fell and
all his animation drained away. Clinging to his grandmother with the gluey
persistence of a toffee twist, he made it abundantly plain to her that he had no wish
to obey. The old lady did her best to comfort him:
‘There, there, my lamb! You’d better go and see him. Grannie will see to it that he
doesn’t hurt you. He wouldn’t dare. Besides, look at all those lovely poems you wrote:
I expect that’s why Her Grace is letting you inside the garden. I’m sure that’s all he
wants to see you about. Probably he just wants to warn you against getting up to
mischief after you have moved in. You only have to answer nicely and promise to do
as he says. You’ll be all right.’
To make sure, she sent a couple of old nannies along as well with strict instructions to
watch over him:
‘See that his Pa doesn’t frighten him!’ she told them, and the old women promised
their protection.
Obliged to go, yet still reluctant, Bao-yu contrived to do so at so dawdling a pace that
each step can have advanced him only a few inches upon his way. It so happened
that Jia Zheng had gone for the purpose of discussing these matters into Lady Wang’s
room and Lady Wang’s maids Golden, Suncloud, Sunset, Avis and Avocet were
standing outside under the eaves. Their amusement when they caught sight of
Bao-yu advancing at this snail’s pace into the courtyard was evident from the
expression on their faces. Golden seized him by the hand, and thrusting out a pair of
heavily carmined lips, she said to him in a whisper:
‘Look at that byootiful lipstick! I’ve only just put it on. Wouldn’t you like a taste of
it?’
Suncloud, with a suppressed giggle, pushed her off him:
‘Can’t you see how scared he is? It’s mean of you to tease him at a time like this!
He’s in a good mood,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘You’d better go in straight away, while it
lasts!’
Bao-yu entered in a sort of sideways crouch, the picture of a submissive son - a
gesture that was wasted, however, since his father and mother were in the inner
room at the back. Aunt Zhao raised the inner room’s portière to admit him. He
bowed to her and entered. Jia Zheng and Lady Wang sat facing each other on the
kang talking. Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Jia Huan were sitting on a row of
chairs below. Ying-chun remained seated at his entrance, but the other three rose to
their feet.
Jia Zheng glanced up and saw Bao-yu standing before him. The lively intelligence that
shone in the boy’s every feature, his almost breath-taking beauty of countenance
contrasted strikingly with Jia Huan’s cringing, hang-dog looks and loutish demeanour,
and Jia Zheng thought suddenly of his other son, Jia Zhu, his Firstborn, whom he had
lost. He glanced at Lady Wang. Of the children she had borne him Bao-yu was now
the only surviving son. He knew how much the boy meant to her. He thought of
himself, too: ageing now, his beard already grey. And as he thought, much of his
customary dislike of Bao-yu slipped away, so that for the time being perhaps only ten
or twenty per cent of it still remained. After what seemed to Bao-yu a very long time,
he said:
‘Her Grace has expressed a fear that by spending your time in constant amusement
outside you may become an idler and a dullard, and she has directed that you and
the girls should be moved into the garden so that you may be kept more closely at
your books. See to it that you work hard and diligently! If I detect any signs of your
former unruliness and disobedience, you will be in for trouble!’
Bao-yu assented meekly. Lady Wang took his hand and drew him up beside her on
the kang. Now that he was seated, Jia Huan and the other two sat down once more
in their chairs. Lady Wang stroked Bao-yu’s neck affectionately:
‘Have you finished those pills I sent you the other day yet?’
‘There’s still one left,’ said Bao-yu.
‘You must come for some more tomorrow. I’ll give you another ten. You must get
Aroma to give you one every night before you go to sleep.’
‘Yes. You told Aroma, Mother. She’s been giving me one every night, as you said.’
‘Who is this “Aroma”?’ asked Jia Zheng sharply.
‘A maid,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I suppose there are no limits to what a maid may be called,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but
who would have picked an outlandish name like that to give her?’
Lady Wang could see that he was displeased and did her best to cover up for Bao-yu:
‘I think it was Lady Jia who gave her the name.’
‘Mother would never think of a name like that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It must have been
Bao-yu.’
Bao-yu saw that a frank avowal was now unavoidable and rose to his feet:
‘This maid has a surname which means “Flowers”. There is a line in an old poem I
happened to remember

The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days

and so I named her after that.’
‘When you get back you must change the name at once,’ said Lady Wang hurriedly
to Bao-yu. ‘Come, Sir Zheng’ - this to her husband - ‘you aren’t going to get angry
about a little thing like that?’
‘It doesn’t really matter,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘and there is no need for him to change the
name; but it demonstrates what I have always said about the boy: he is
fundamentally incapable of caring about serious matters and preoccupies himself
with poetic frivolities and other such airy-fairy nonsense as a substitute for solid
learning. Wretched fellow!’ he shouted at Bao-yu. ‘What are you waiting for?’
‘Go now, go now I’ said Lady Wang in a flutter. ‘Grandma is probably waiting to
begin her dinner.’
Bao-yu murmured a reply and retired, rather more slowly than was necessary.
Emerging from the outer door, he grinned and stuck his tongue out at Golden, then
shot off like a puff of smoke, the two old nannies hurrying after him. Arriving at the
entrance of the covered passage-way he came upon Aroma leaning in the doorway.
Her face lit up when she saw him returning unscathed and she asked him what his
father had wanted to see him about.
‘Oh, nothing much,’ said Bao-yu. ‘He just wanted to say a few words about not
getting up to mischief after we’ve moved into the garden.’
Having answered Aroma, he went in to see his grandmother and told her about the
interview. He found Dai-yu with her and asked her which part of the garden she
planned to live in. It appeared that she had just been considering this question
herself, for her answer was a prompt one:
‘I’ve been thinking how nice it would be in the Naiad’s House. I love all those
bamboos and the little winding, half-hidden walk. It is so quiet and peaceful there.’
Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly:
‘Just what I would have chosen for you! I was hoping you would want to live there,
because I want to live in the House of Green Delights — which means that we should
be neigh?bours. And both places are quiet and tucked away.’
They were still discussing their plans when a servant arrived from Jia Zheng with a
message
for Grandmother Jia. It was to say that the twenty-second of the second month being
a Lucky Day was the date on which Bao-yu and the girls were to move into the
garden. Servants were to be allowed inside in the interim in order to make the rooms
ready for them. It was finally settled that Bao-chai should have All-spice Court, Dai-yu
the Naiad’s House, Ying-chun the building on Amaryllis Eyot, Tan-chun the Autumn
Studio, Xi-chun the Lotus Pavilion, Li Wan Sweet-rice Village, and Bao-yu the House
of Green Delights. Each set of rooms was allotted two old women and four maids in
addition to the occupant’s existing maids and nannies, and there were other servants
whose sole duty was sweeping and cleaning. On the twenty-second of the second
month everyone moved in. The silent, deserted garden suddenly came to life —
Live flowers on silk-embroidered flowers up-glanced,
And unguent scents the scents of spring enhanced
as the bevy of gaily-dressed, chattering girls spread themselves through its quiet
walks.



*
But to return to our hero.
Life for Bao-yu after his removal into the garden became utterly and completely
satisfying. Every day was spent in the company of his maids and cousins in the most
amiable and delightful occupations, such as
reading,
practising calligraphy,
strumming on the qin,
playing Go,
painting,
composing verses,
embroidering in coloured silks,
competitive flower-collecting,
making flower-sprays,
singing,
word games and
guess-fingers.
In a word, he was blissfully happy.
One product of this period was a set of four Garden Nights poems which, though
they have little claim to poetic merit, give a fairly accurate impression of the mood
and setting of those carefree days:

I. Spring

Behind silk hangings, in warm quilts cocooned,
His ears half doubt the frogs’ first muted sound.
Rain at his window strikes, the pillow’s cold;
Yet to the sleeper’s eyes spring dreams unfold.
Why does the candle shed its waxen tear?
Why on each flower do angry drops appear?
By uncouth din of giggling maids distressed
He burrows deeper in his silken nest.

II. Summer

A tired maid sleeps at her embroidery.
A parrot in its gilt cage calls for tea.
Pale moonbeams on an opened mirror fall,
And burning sandal makes a fragrant pall.
From amber cups thirst-quenching nectar flows.
A willow-breeze through crystal curtains blows.
In pool-side kiosks light-clad maidens flit,
Or, dressed for bed, by open casements sit.

III. Autumn

In Red Rue Study, far from worldly din,
Through rosy gauze moonlight comes flooding in.
Outside, a stork sleeps on moss-wrinkled rocks,
And dew from well-side trees the crow’s wings soaks.
A maid the great quilt’s golden bird has spread;
Her languid master droops his raven head.
Wine-parched and sleepless, in the still night he cries
For tea, and soon thick smoke and steam arise.

IV. Winter

Midnight and winter: plum with bamboo sleeps,
While one midst Indian rugs his vigil keeps.
Only a stork outside is to be found –
No orioles now, though white flowers mask the ground.
Chill strikes the maid’s bones through her garments fine;
Her fur-clad master’s somewhat worse for wine;
But, in tea-making mysteries deep-skilled,
She has with new-swept snow the kettle filled.

The indifferent quality of these poems did not prevent members of that class of
worldlings who see merit in a name and excellence in a title from copying them out
and proclaiming them everywhere as miracles of precocious talent when they
discovered that their author was the thirteen-year-old heir apparent of Sir Jia of
Rong-guo House. There were also a number of bright young things who professed an
extravagant liking for the deliciousness of the poems, and who copied them on to
fans and wall-spaces and recited them on the least provocation (or none at all) at
social gatherings. Soon Bao-yu was being besieged with requests for more poems, for
speci?mens of his calligraphy, for paintings, for inscriptions. He began to feel himself
a lion and was kept constantly busy with these dilettantish ‘duties’.
Then, quite suddenly, in the midst of this placid, agreeable existence, he was
discontented. He got up one day feeling out of sorts. Nothing he did brought any
relief. Whether he stayed indoors or went out into the garden, he remained bored
and miserable. The garden’s female population were mostly still in that age of
innocence when freedom from inhibition is the fruit of ignorance. Waking and
sleeping they surrounded him, and their mindless giggling was constantly in his ears.
How could they understand the restless feelings that now consumed him? In his
present mood of discontent he was bored with the garden and its inmates; yet his
attempts to find distraction outside it ended in the same emptiness and ennui.
Tealeaf saw how it was with him and racked his brains for a remedy. Unfortunately all
the things he could think of seemed to be things that Bao-yu had already tried and
grown tired of. But no, there was something he had not yet tried. As soon as Tealeaf
thought of it, he set off to the book-stalls and bought a pile of books — books of a
kind Bao-yu had never heard about - to give as a present to his young master. His
purchases included
Old Inklubber’s Stories Old and New
The Secret History of Flying Swallow
Sister of Flying Swallow
The Infamous Loves of Empress Wu
The Jade Ring Concubine, or Peeps in the Inner Palace
and a heap of playbooks — mostly romantic comedies and the like.
Bao-yu took one look at this gift and was enraptured; but Tealeaf uttered a warning:
‘Don’t take these into the garden! If you do, and anyone finds out about them, I’ll
be in real trouble — more than just a bellyful!’
The injunction was one with which Bao-yu was most un?willing to comply. After a
good deal of hesitation he picked out a few of the chaster volumes to keep by his bed
and read when no one was about, and left the cruder, more forthright ones behind,
hidden somewhere in his outer study.
One day after lunch — it was round about the Midwash of the third month, as our
forefathers, who measured the passage of time by their infrequent ablutions, were
wont to say - Bao-yu set off for Drenched Blossoms Weir with the volumes of
Western Chamber under his arm, and sitting down on a rock underneath the
peach-tree which grew there beside the bridge, he took up the first volume and
began, very attentively, to read the play. He had just reached the line

The red flowers in their hosts are falling

when a little gust of wind blew over and a shower of petals suddenly rained down
from the tree above, covering his clothes, his book and all the ground about him. He
did not like to shake them off for fear they got trodden underfoot, so collecting as
many of them as he could in the lap of his gown, he carried them to the water’s edge
and shook them in. The petals bobbed and circled for a while on the surface of the
water before finally disappearing over the weir. When he got back he found that a lot
more of them had fallen while he was away. As he hesitated, a voice behind him said,
‘What are you doing here?’
He looked round and saw that it was Dai-yu. She was carrying a garden hoe with a
muslin bag hanging from the end of it on her shoulder and a garden broom in her
hand.
‘You’ve come just at the right moment,’ said Bao-yu, smiling at her. ‘Here, sweep
these petals up and tip them in the water for me! I’ve just tipped one lot in myself.’
‘It isn’t a good idea to tip them in the water,’ said Dai-yu. ‘The water you see here is
clean, but farther on beyond the weir, where it flows past people’s houses, there are
all sorts of muck and impurity, and in the end they get spoiled just the same. In that
corner over there I’ve got a grave for the flowers, and what I’m doing now is
sweeping them up and putting them in this silk bag to bury them there, so that they
can gradu?ally turn back into earth. Isn’t that a cleaner way of disposing of them?’
Bao-yu was full of admiration for this idea.
‘Just let me put this book somewhere and I’ll give you a hand.’
‘What book?’ said Dai-yu.
‘Oh... The Doctrine of the Mean and The Greater Learning,’ he said, hastily
concealing it.
‘Don’t try to fool me!’ said Dai-yu. ‘You would have done much better to let me
look at it in the first place, instead of hiding it so guiltily.’
‘In your case, coz, I have nothing to be afraid of,’ said Bao-yu; ‘but if I do let you
look, you must promise not to tell anyone. It’s marvellous stuff. Once you start
reading it, you’ll even stop wanting to eat!’
He handed the book to her, and Dai-yu put down her things and looked. The more
she read, the more she liked it, and before very long she had read several acts. She
felt the power of the words and their lingering fragrance. Long after she had finished
reading, when she had laid down the book and was sitting there rapt and silent, the
lines continued to ring on in her head.
‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘is it good?’
Dai-yu smiled and nodded.
Bao-yu laughed:


‘How can I, full of sickness and of woe,
Withstand that face which kingdoms could o’erthrow?’

Dai-yu reddened to the tips of her ears. The eyebrows that seemed to frown yet
somehow didn’t were raised now in anger and the lovely eyes flashed. There was
rage in her crimson cheeks and resentment in all her looks.
‘You’re hateful!’ - she pointed a finger at him in angry accusal — ‘deliberately using
that horrid play to take advantage of me. I’m going straight off to tell Uncle and
Aunt!’
At the words ‘take advantage of me’ her eyes filled with tears, and as she finished
speaking she turned from him and began to go. Bao-yu rushed after her and held her
back:
‘Please, please forgive me! Dearest coz! If I had the slightest intention of taking
advantage of you, may I fall into the water and be eaten up by an old bald-headed
turtle! When you have become a great lady and gone at last to your final
resting-place, I shall become the stone turtle that stands in front of your grave and
spend the rest of eternity carrying your tombstone on my back as a punishment!’
His ridiculous declamation provoked a sudden explosion of mirth. She laughed and
simultaneously wiped the tears away with her knuckles:
‘Look at you - the same as ever! Scared as anything, but you still have to go on
talking nonsense. Well, I know you now for what you are:


“Of silver spear the leaden counterfeit”!’

‘Well! You can talk!’ said Bao-yu laughing. ‘Listen to you! Now I’m going off to tell
on you!’
‘You needn’t imagine you’re the only one with a good memory,’ said Dai-yu
haughtily. ‘I suppose I’m allowed to remember lines too if I like.’
Bao-yu took back the book from her with a good-natured laugh:
‘Never mind about all that now! Let’s get on with this flower-burying!’
And the two of them set about sweeping together the fallen flower-petals and
putting them into the bag. They had just finished burying it when Aroma came
hurrying up to them:
‘So there you are! I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Your Uncle She isn’t well
and the young ladies have all gone over to visit him. Her Old Ladyship says you are to
go as well. You’d better come back straight away and get changed!’
Bao-yu picked up his book, took leave of Dai-yu, and ac?companied Aroma back to
his room.
And there, for the moment, we shall leave him.

*
With Bao-yu gone and the girls evidently all out, Dai-yu began to feel lonely and
depressed. She was on her way back to her own room and was just passing by the
corner of Pear Tree Court when she heard the languorous meanderings of a flute and
the sweet modulation of a girlish voice coming from the other side of the wall, and
knew that the twelve little actresses were at their rehearsal inside. Although she was
paying no particular attention to the singing, a snatch of it chanced suddenly to fall
with very great clarity on her ear, so that she was able to make out quite distinctly
the words of two whole lines of the aria being sung:


‘Here multiflorate splendour blooms forlorn
Midst broken fountains, mouldering walls –’

They moved her strangely, and she stopped to listen. The voice went on:


‘And the bright air, the brilliant morn
Feed my despair.
Joy and gladness have withdrawn
To other gardens, other halls -’

At this point the listener unconsciously nodded her head and sighed.
‘It’s true,’ she thought, ‘there is good poetry even in plays. What a pity most people
think of them only as entertainment. A lot of the real beauty in them must go
unappreciated.’
She suddenly became aware that her mind was wandering and regretted that her
inattention had caused her to miss some of the singing. She listened again. This time
it was another voice:


‘Because for you, my flowerlike fair,
The swift years like the waters flow—’

The words moved her to the depth of her being.


‘I have sought you everywhere,
And at last I find you here,
In a dark room full of woe—’

It was like intoxication, a sort of delirium. Her legs would no longer support her. She
collapsed on to a near-by rockery and crouched there, the words turning over and
over in her mind:

Because for you, my flowerlike fair,
The swift years like the waters flow …

Suddenly she thought of a line from an old poem she had read quite recently:

Relentlessly the waters flow, the flowers fade.

From that her mind turned to those famous lines written in his captivity by the tragic
poet-emperor of Later Tang:

The blossoms fall, the water flows,
The glory of the spring is gone
In nature’s world as in the human one —

and to some lines from The Western Chamber which she had just been reading:

As flowers fall and the flowing stream runs red,
A thousand sickly fancies crowd the mind.

All these different lines and verses combined into a single overpowering impression,
riving her soul with a pang of such keen anguish that the tears started from her eyes.
She might have remained there indefinitely, weeping and comfortless, had not
someone just at that moment come up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder.
She turned to look and saw that it was—
But if you wish to know who it was, you must read the next chapter!
CHAPTER 24

The Drunken Diamond shows nobility of character
in handling his money
And the Quiet-voiced Girl provides material for
fantasy by losing her handkerchief

As Dai-yu continued to crouch there, a prisoner of her own sorrowful thoughts and
emotions, someone suddenly came up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder:
‘What are you doing here all on your own?’
She looked round with a start. It was Caltrop.
‘You silly girl!’ said Dai-yu. ‘You gave me quite a shock, creeping up on me like that.
Where have you just come from?’
Caltrop laughed mischievously:
‘I’ve been looking for our young lady, but I can’t find her anywhere. Your
Nightingale is looking for you too, by the way. She says Mrs Lian has sent you - I think
it’s some kind of tea. Shall I go with you?’
She took her by the hand and accompanied her back to the Naiad’s House. The
present from Xi-feng she had mentioned was waiting there when they arrived: two
little cylindrical containers of a new tea supplied to the Palace for the Emperor’s own
use. The two girls sat down and discussed the relative merits of various pieces of
embroidery, played a little Go, and looked at one or two books. Then Caltrop went off
again.
Our narrative leaves them at this point and passes to other matters.

*

Recalled to his own apartment by Aroma, Bao1u arrived back to find his
grandmother’s maid Faithful reclining on the couch examining Aroma’s needlework.
‘Where have you been?’ she said, as soon as she saw him enter. ‘Her Old Ladyship
is waiting for you. She wants you to go next door to see how your Uncle She is
getting on. You’d better hurry up and get changed!’
Aroma went into the next room to get his clothes. Bao-yu sat on the edge of the
couch and kicked his shoes off. While he was waiting for his boots to come, he turned
and scrutinized Faithful. She was wearing a pale strawberry-coloured dress of silk
damask, a sleeveless black satin jacket, stockings of eggshell blue, and dark-red
embroidered slippers. Her neck, which was towards him as she bent down once more
to inspect the needlework, was encircled at its base by a reddish-purple silk scarf. A
fascinating neck. He bent down over it to sniff its perfume and stroked it softly with
his hand. It was as smooth and white as Aroma’s. With an impish chuckle he threw
himself upon her and clung like sticky toffee about her person:
‘Come on, Faithful darling, give us a taste of your lipstick!’
Faithful called out to Aroma in the next room:
‘Aroma, come in and look at this! All the years you’ve been with him now —
haven’t you managed to cure him yet?’
Aroma came in with her arms full of clothes.
‘I don’t know what’s the matter with you,’ she said to Bao-?yu. ‘Heaven knows, I’ve
tried hard enough to cure you! If you go on much longer like this, you’re just going to
make it impossible to go on living here any longer.’
She hurried him on with his dressing. When he was ready, he accompanied Faithful to
the front apartment to see Grandmother Jia. Going outside again, he found horse
and servants ready waiting and was about to get into the saddle, when he noticed Jia
Lian dismounting opposite, having just returned from his visit. The two cousins went
up to each other and exchanged a few words. Just at that moment a figure emerged
from the side of the courtyard and greeted Bao-yu:
‘Uncle Bao! How are you?’
Bao-yu turned. It was a tall, thin youth of eighteen or nineteen who had spoken, with
a thin, handsome face and an air of great natural refinement. Although his face was
familiar, Bao-yu could not for the moment remember his name or which part of the
clan he belonged to.
‘You look very puzzled!’ said Jia Lian amusedly. ‘Surely you know who this is? This is
Jia Yun - Cousin Bu-shi’s boy, who lives in West Lane.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t think what made me forget! — How’s your
mother?’ he asked Jia Yun. ‘What business brings you here today?’
Jia Yun pointed to Jia Lian:
‘I came here to have a word with Uncle Lian.’
‘You’ve grown very good-looking since I saw you last,’ said Bao-yu with a grin. ‘You
could almost be my son.’
‘You’ve got a nerve!’ said Jia Lian laughing. ‘Your son? He’s five or six years older
than you.’
‘How old are you then?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘Eighteen.’
Being a sharp-witted young man who knew how to make the most of an opportunity,
Jia Yun was quick to turn Bao?-yu’s jest to good account.
‘There’s a saying about “grandsires in cradles and babbies with beards”, you know;
and even if I am older than you, “the highest mountain can’t shut out the sun”! I’ve
had no one to care for me during these last few years since my father died, and if you
don’t mind having so stupid a person for your son, I should certainty be very happy
to have you for a father.’
‘You hear that?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Now you’ve got yourself a son! You’ll find that
parenthood is no laughing matter, I can tell you!’
He left them and went inside, chuckling to himself.
Bao-yu smiled at his new ‘son’:
‘Next time you’re free, come and see me. Don’t waste your time trying to join in
their little intrigues! I’m afraid I’m not free at the moment, but if you will come round
to my study tomorrow, we can spend all day together, and I shall be able to show you
round the garden.’
With these words he mounted his horse and set off, his pages at his back, for Jia
She’s.
Bao-yu found that his uncle was suffering from nothing more serious than a chill. He
delivered his grandmother’s message first and then asked after his uncle on his own
behalf. Jia She stood up to hear what his mother had to say, and when Bao-yu had
finished, ordered a servant to take him to his Aunt Xing’s room. Bao-yu withdrew and
followed the servant through the back and across the courtyard to the main
reception room. Seeing him enter, Lady Xing rose to her feet to ask after
Grandmother Jia, then sat down again to be asked after in turn by Bao-yu. Then she
drew him up to sit beside her on the kang and asked him about the others, at the
same time giving orders for tea to be served.
While they were still sipping the tea, little Jia Cong, the son of one of Jia She’s
concubines, came in to say ‘hullo’ to his Cousin Bao.
‘Where did this little ragamuffin come from?’ Lady Xing scolded. ‘I don’t know what
that Nannie of yours can be thinking of to let you get in such a state! I declare, your
face is as black as a crow! No one would ever think to look at you that you were an
educated little boy and came from a good family!’
While she scolded, Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived, their duty call on Jia She evidently
just completed. Lady Xing made them sit on chairs below the kang. Seeing Bao-yu up
on the kang with Lady Xing and sharing her cushion, and observing how she fondled
and petted him, Jia Huan soon began to feel uncomfortable and made a sign to Jia
Lan indi?cating that they should go. As Jia Huan was his uncle, Jia Lan had to do as he
said, so the little boy and the big one rose together to take their leave. Bao-yu said
he would go with them, but Lady Xing stopped him with a gracious smile:
‘You sit where you are! I’ve got something else to say to you.’
He was obliged to stay. Lady Xing turned to the other two:
‘When you get back, do each of you give my regards to your mothers. I won’t ask
you to stay to dinner because I’ve already got the girls here and they are making so
much rumpus that it’s given me a headache.’
Jia Huan and Jia Lan promised to convey her greetings and went out.
‘Where are the girls, then?’ Bao-yu asked after they had gone. ‘I haven’t seen
them.’
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Lady Xing nonchalantly. ‘They only sat here for a few
moments, then they went round to the back. They’re round the back somewhere or
other.’
‘You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about, Aunt. What was it
you wanted to tell me?’
‘Oh, nothing at all!’ said Lady Xing gaily. ‘I only said that because I wanted you to
stay and have dinner here with me and the girls. And I’ve got something nice for you
to take back with you afterwards.’
Bao-yu and his aunt chatted away, and before long it was time for dinner and the
three girls were called in. A table and chairs were arranged, the table was laid, and
Lady Xing, her daughter Ying-chun, her two nieces and her nephew sat down to their
meal. When it was over, Bao-yu went in to take his leave of Jia She, after which he
and the girls returned to their own side of the mansion. There they first went in to
see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then returned to their own apartments for
the night.
So much for Bao-yu and the girls.
Let us return to Jia Yun who, after his encounter with Bao-?yu, had gone in to see Jia
Lian and ask him if there was any prospect of a job.
‘A job turned up only the other day,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but unfortunately your Aunt
Feng was very anxious that I should give it to Jia Qin and I’m afraid I let him have it.
However, she did mention that there will soon be a lot of planting to do in the garden,
and she promised that as soon as that work turns up we shall definitely hand it over
to you.’
Jia Yun was silent for some moments, then he said:
‘All right. I’ll just have to go on waiting, then. But would you mind not mentioning
this visit to Auntie? I can tell her about it myself, if need be, next time I see her.’
‘I shan’t mention it,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I’ve got better things to do with my time than go
running after her to talk about things like this! Tomorrow I have to go to Xing-yi, by
the way. I have to get back on the same day — but perhaps you’d better wait until
the day after tomorrow before coming round again. In fact, you’d better wait until
the evening of the day after tomorrow - some time after the beginning of the first
watch. Any time before that I shall be busy.’
He terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes.
Jia Yun went out of the Rong-guo mansion and set off for home, ruminating as he
went. A plan at last formed in his mind. Instead of returning home, he struck off for
the house of his maternal uncle.
His uncle’s name was Bu Shi-ren. He was the proprietor of a perfumery, and when Jia
Yun arrived had only just got back from the shop. Seeing his nephew enter, he asked
him what he had come about.
‘I’m on to something which needs your help,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Please Uncle, could you
possibly let me have four ounces of Barus camphor and four ounces of musk on
credit? I promise faithfully that you shall have the money by Autumn Quarter-day.’
Bu Shi-ren ‘humph-ed’ scornfully:
‘Don’t talk to me about credit! A while ago we let one of the assistants have several
taels’ worth of goods on credit for one of his relations, and we haven’t seen the
money for it yet. We had to share the loss between us. We’ve got a written
agreement now that in future if any of us gives credit to a friend or relation, he is
liable to a fine of twenty taels of silver to be shared out among the rest.
‘In any case, we’re short of stock on those two items. I doubt we’ve got that much
in the shop, even if you could pay cash down for it. We’d have to try to raise it for you
else?where.
‘And for another thing: what do you want it for, anyway? I don’t expect it’s for any
serious purpose. Even if I let you have it on credit, I expect it would only get thrown
away on some foolishness or other.
‘And don’t you go saying that your Uncle’s always on at you when you come to see
him! You young people just don’t know what’s good for you. If only you could pull
yourself together and earn a bit of money, no one would be happier for you than I
should.’
Jia Yun smiled:
‘What you say is no doubt perfectly true, Uncle. But when Father died I was too
little to understand what was going on, and according to what Mother has since told
me, it was you who stepped in and took care of everything. Now you know as well as
I do that it wasn’t I who spent all the money that came from selling off our little bit of
property, and I don’t see what I am supposed to do without any capital. Even the
cleverest housewife can’t make bread without flour! You’re lucky you’ve only got me
to contend with. Anyone else in my position would be pestering the life out of you.
They’d be round here scrounging all the time: a pound of rice one day, a quart of
beans the next. Then you would have something to grumble about!’
‘My dear boy,’ said Bu Shi-ren, ‘if I had it to give, you should have it and welcome!
Your trouble is, though, as I’m always telling your Aunt, you won’t think ahead. If only
you’d pull yourself together and go and have a word with your Father’s folk at the big
house - or if you can’t get to see them, put your pride in your pocket and make
yourself agreeable to some of the stewards there — get yourself a job of some kind!
When I was on my way out of the city the other day, I ran into that cousin of yours
from North Street riding on a donkey with four or five carriages behind him and fifty
or sixty nuns on his way to your family temple out in the country. Now that’s a
shrewd young fellow! You can’t tell me he got that job by doing nothing!’
Exasperated by his uncle’s nagging, Jia Yun got up to go. ‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bu
Shi-ren. ‘You can have something to eat before you go -’
‘Are you crazy?’ his wife’s voice cut in from the kitchen. ‘I told you we haven’t got
any rice in the house. I’ve just bought this half a pound of noodles that I’m cooking
for you now. I don’t know what you’re acting so lordly about, asking people to dinner.
The boy’ll only go hungry if he stays!’
‘Buy another half a pound, woman, and put it in with the rest!’ said Bu Shi-ren.
‘Goldie!’ Mrs Bu shouted to her daughter. ‘Go over to Mrs Wang’s house across the
road and ask if she can lend us a few cash. Tell her we can pay her back tomorrow!’
But before she had finished, Jia Yun, with a muttered ‘Don’t bother!’ had slipped
quietly away.
Angrily leaving his uncle’s house behind him, he was on his way back home, eyes
fixed on the ground as he brooded miserably on his affairs, when he walked head-on
into drunkard. The man seized hold of him with a curse:
‘You sodding blind, bumping into me like that?’
The voice was a familiar one. Looking closer he saw that it was his neighbour Ni Er, a
racketeer who made most of his money from high-interest loans supplemented by
what he took off other players in the gambling dens. He drank too much and was
always getting into fights. At this particular moment he was on his way back from
paying a little ‘call’ on one of his debtors — evidently a lucrative one, for he was
already half-seas-over. He did not take kindly to being bumped into, and it would
have gone badly with Jia Yun if he had not immediately identified himself:
‘Ni, old chap, don’t strike! It’s me! I wasn’t looking where I was going.’
Hearing the voice, Ni Er opened his bleary eyes a little wider, saw that it was Jia Yun,
released him - lurching heavily as he did so — and gave a crapulous laugh:
‘Oh,’ he said, ‘young Mist’ Jia. Parm me. Wherra you jus’ come from?’
‘Don’t ask me!’ said Jia Yun bitterly. ‘I’ve just been given the bird!’
‘Nemmind!’ said Ni Er. ‘Anyone been bothering you, Mist’ Jia, jus’ tell me and I’ll
settle accounts with him for you! You know me. Ni Er. The Drunken Diamond. Old
Dime’ll look after you. Anyone this part of the town troubling neighbour of Dime’s,
don’t care who he is, guarantee put him out of business.’
‘Look, Diamond, if you’ll promise not to get angry, I’ll tell you what happened,’ said
Jia Yun, and proceeded to give him an account of his interview with Bu Shi-ren. Ni Er
was hugely incensed:
‘Damn fella! Give the damn fella piece of my mind if he wasn’t a relation of yours.
Make my blood boil. Damn fella! Nemmind. Dome be downhearted. Got a few taels
of silver here. If you can use it, help yourself! Good neighbour of Dime’s. Here y’are.
Interest-free loan.’
‘This man’s a racketeer,’ Jia Yun thought to himself, ‘but he’s been known to do a
good turn before now — in fact, he’s got quite a reputation in some quarters as a
champion of the poor. If I don’t accept his offer, he may turn nasty and I shall be in
trouble. Better accept the money and pay back double the amount when I can.’
Having made the decision, he thanked Ni Er with a smile:
‘You’re a real sport, Diamond! Since you’ve been kind enough to make the offer
then, I won’t refuse. I’ll make you out a proper IOU for it when I get home.’
Ni Er roared with laughter:
‘There’s only fifteen taels and six pennyweights of silver here. If you’re going to go
writing IOUs, I won’t lend it to you!’
Jia Yun laughed too and took the money from him:
‘All right, Diamond, anything you say! Let’s not fall out about it!’
‘That’s more like it!’ said Ni Er. ‘Getting dark now. Won’t keep you for a drink. Still
got a little business to do. You go on home. Like you to give a message to my old
woman, be so kind. Not going home tonight. If there’s anything to tell me about, she
can send my daughter round first thing tomorrow. Find me at Bandy Wang, the
horse-dealer’s.’
With these words he went on his way, lurching horribly.
The encounter left Jia Yun somewhat bemused.
‘That Ni Er’s certainly a character!’ he thought. ‘The trouble is, it may only have
been the drink that made him generous. Perhaps when he’s sobered up tomorrow
he’ll want his money back with a hundred per cent interest. What am I going to do
then?’
Then he suddenly remembered what the money would enable him to do:
‘Of course! It doesn’t matter! If I get the job, I can pay back the loan and a hundred
per cent interest easily.’
With that thought uppermost in his mind he went into a money-changer’s to have
the silver weighed. To his great delight it turned out to be exactly the amount Ni Er
had said, not a pennyweight less. Then he went home, calling at Ni Er’s house on the
way to give the message to his wife. En?tering his own house he found his mother on
the kang spin?ning. She looked up as he entered:
‘Where have you been all day?’
He did not like to mention that he had been to see her brother in case she was angry.
He only said:
‘Been at Rong-guo House waiting for Uncle Lian. Have you had supper yet?’
‘Yes, I’ve had mine. I put something aside for you.’
She called to their little slavey to fetch it for him. Except for her work-lamp it was
already dark indoors, so after finishing his supper he got himself ready for the night,
unrolled his bedding, and settled down to sleep.
Rising early next morning, he went off as soon as he had washed to the shops in
Central Street outside the south gate of the Inner City and bought camphor and musk
at a perfu?mer’s. From there he went to Rong-guo House, and having first
ascertained at the gate that Jia Lian was out for the day, he made his way to the
Lians’ apartment at the back. Outside the gateway leading to their courtyard a
number of page boys were sweeping the ground with long-handled brooms.
Sud?denly Zhou Rui’s wife came out and addressed them:
‘Stop sweeping now! The Mistress is coming.’
Jia Yun hurried up to her with a smile of greeting:
‘Where is Aunt Lian off to, then?’
‘Her Old Ladyship wants her,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I think it’s to see about some
tailoring.’
As she spoke, the subject of his inquiry emerged from the gateway, surrounded by a
bevy of attendants. Jia Yun was well aware that she had a weakness for flattery and
the showier forms of deference. Bringing his hands together in an exag?gerated
salute and stepping briskly forward, he made her a tremendous bow and wished her
in good health.
Xi-feng continued to walk on and, without actually looking at him or turning her head,
inquired after his mother’s health and asked why she never came to visit.
‘She’s not been very well, Auntie. She’s always thinking about you and meaning to
pay a call, but when it’s come to it, she just hasn’t been able to get out.’
‘You’re a wonderful liar!’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. ‘I don’t suppose she’s ever
thought about me until this moment!’
‘I’m too much afraid of lightning to lie to my superiors,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Mother was
talking about you only last night, as a matter of fact. She said, “Your Auntie Lian is
only a single weak woman, yet she has all those responsibilities. It’s a good thing she
has the will-power to keep everything running so smoothly, because if that should go,
she’d be worn out in no tine.”‘
Xi-feng was now all smiles, and halted in spite of herself to hear more.
‘And why should you and your mother be chewing over my affairs behind my back,
pray?’
‘That’s a long story,’ said Jia Yun. ‘A very good friend of mine who runs a perfumery
and had quite a bit put by in savings decided to invest his money in a government
post and bought himself the place of an Assistant Sub-Prefect. Well, a few days ago
his posting came and it turns out to be for somewhere down in Yunnan. He’s taking
his family with him, so of course he won’t be able to keep on the shop, and he’s been
going over all his stock deciding what to give away and what to put in his clearance
sale. He decided to give the more valuable stuff to friends and relations. My share
was a whole quarter of a pound of Borneo camphor and another quarter of musk,
and I was discussing with Mother last night what we ought to do with it. We don’t
know anyone who could afford to buy it; and it seems a shame to sell it at less than
the price; and even if we gave it away, we couldn’t think of anyone who would want
so much. But then I suddenly thought of you and the packets of money you’ve spent
on this kind of thing in years past, and I thought to myself that this year, what with
Her Grace in the Palace and the Double Fifth already not far off, you’re sure to be
using ten or twelve times the usual amount. So, to cut a long story short, we decided
to make a present of it to you. There you are, Auntie - a little token of my esteem!’
As he spoke, he took out a small brocade-covered box and respectfully raised it in
both hands to offer her.
Now Xi-feng was just beginning to think about the problem of purchasing aromatics
for the Double Fifth festival, and it pleased her very much to be relieved of the
trouble of doing so — especially when it was in so agreeable a manner. She smiled at
him graciously before turning to her maid:
‘Felicity, take my nephew’s present and give it to Patience to take care of!’
The smile was directed once more on Jia Yun:
‘You are very thoughtful. I’m not surprised your Uncle speaks so highly of you. He’s
often told me what a well-spoken, sensible young man you are.’
They seemed to be sailing into harbour. Jia Yun took a step closer:
‘Has Uncle been talking to you about me then?’ — The tone in which he asked the
question was deliberately meaningful.
Xi-feng was on the point of telling him that he would get the tree-planting job when
she reflected that by doing so she would be cheapening herself in his estimation. He
would almost certainly suppose that she was promising it in return for the perfume.
In replying to his question she therefore confined herself to a few insipid civilities,
avoiding all mention of jobs and trees, and presently continued on her way to
Grandmother Jia’s.
Obviously Jia Yun was in no position to raise the subject if his aunt was not willing, so
he was obliged to return in the same uncertainty in which he had come. Back home
he remembered Bao-yu’s invitation of the previous day, and as soon as he had
finished his meal, he returned once more to Rong-guo House and made his way to
Sunset Studio outside the gateway leading to Lady Jia’s quarters. He found the pages
Tealeaf and Ploughboy sitting over a game of chess and arguing about a piece that
one of them had just taken. Other pages — Trickles, Sweeper, Cloudy and Storky —
were up on the roof looking for fledgelings. Jia Yun entered the court?yard and
stamped his foot:
‘Come on, you young rapscallions! Can’t you see you’ve got a visitor?’
The pages, except Tealeaf, melted away. Jia Yun went into the study and sat down in a
chair.
‘Has Master Bao been here yet?’
‘He hasn’t been here yet today,’ said Tealeaf. ‘If you want to talk to him, I’ll have a
look and see if he’s about.’
With that he, too, vanished.
For about the time it would take to eat a meal, Jia Yun gazed at the paintings,
calligraphic scrolls and antiques which adorned the room. At the end of that time, as
there was still no sign of Tealeaf, he took a look outside to see if there were any other
pages whom he could ask to take a message; but they had all gone off to play
elsewhere. Dejectedly he went back once more to wait.
‘Tealeaf!’
A soft and thrilling voice was calling from outside. Craning out to look he saw a
fifteen-or sixteen-year-old maid standing near the entrance to the study. She was a
neat, pleasant-looking girl with a pair of limpid, intelligent eyes. Seeing a strange man
in the room, she quickly shrank back out of his line of vision. At that very moment
Tealeaf walked back into the courtyard.
‘Ah, good!’ he said, catching sight of the maid. ‘I was beginning to wonder how I’d
ever get a message to him.’
Jia Yun ran out to question him:
‘Well?’
‘Waited for ages,’ said Tealeaf, ‘but no one came by. She’s from his room, though.’ -
he indicated the soft-voiced maid – ‘Listen, dear,’ he said addressing her. ‘Can you
take a message for us? Tell him that Mr Jia from West Lane is here.’
On learning that the visitor was a member of the clan, the maid became less
concerned about concealment and engaged the limpid eyes in bolder scrutiny of his
features. The object of her scrutiny now addressed her:
‘Don’t bother about the “West Lane” stuff! Just say that “Yun” has called!’
The girl reflected for some moments, then, with a half-smile, she said:
‘If I were you, Mr Jia, I’d go home now and come again tomorrow. I’ll try to get a
message through to him this evening if I get the chance.’
‘What’s the idea?’ said Tealeaf.
‘He didn’t have his nap today,’ said the maid. ‘That means he’ll be having dinner
early. Then suppose he doesn’t go out after dinner: are you going to let Mr Jia wait
here all day without eating? It would be much better if he went home now and came
again tomorrow. Even if I succeed in getting word through to him as soon as I get
back, he’ll probably only send an answer to the message. I don’t expect he’ll actually
come over.’
Her words were sensible and to the point and were spoken in the same thrilling tone
that had first attracted him. Jia Yun would have liked to ask her name, but etiquette
forbade that he should do so now that he knew she was one of Bao-yu’s maids. He
just said:
‘I’m sure you’re right. I’ll come again tomorrow, then.’
He turned to go.
‘I’ll get some tea for you, Mr Jia,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Have a cup of tea before you go.’
‘No thanks,’ said Jia Yun, looking back over his shoulder but continuing to go. ‘I’ve
got other business.’
The words were for Tealeaf, but the look which accom?panied them was directed at
the soft-voiced maid, who was still standing there.
Jia Yun went back home and returned next day as she had advised. On his way in he
ran into Xi-feng outside the main gate. She was about to visit Jia Lian’s parents next
door and had just got into her carriage. Seeing Jia Yun, she made her attendants call
to him to stop.
‘Yun!’ She smiled at him through the window of the carriage. ‘You’ve got a nerve,
my lad, playing a trick like that on me! I see now why you gave me that present. It’s a
job you were after. Your Uncle told me yesterday. Apparently you’ve been on to him
about it already.’
Jia Yun smiled back ruefully:
‘I’d rather we didn’t go into my dealings with Uncle, if you don’t mind! I’m
beginning to wish I’d never spoken to him about it. If I’d realized earlier what the
situation was, I should have gone straight to you in the first place. I’m sure if I had, it
would all have been settled long ago. I’m afraid Uncle has let me down.’
‘Humph!’ said Xi-feng. ‘So that’s why you came to me yesterday, is it? You’d had no
success with the husband so you thought you’d try your luck with the wife!’
‘That’s most unfair, Auntie!’ Jia Yun protested. ‘It was a purely disinterested present.
I wasn’t thinking at all about a job when I gave it to you. If I had been, why do you
suppose I didn’t take the opportunity of asking you about it at the time? However,
since you do now know that I’m looking for one, I’d like to forget about Uncle and
throw myself on your kindness instead.’
‘You have a very devious way of going about things,’ said Xi-feng with a hint of
malice in her smile. ‘Why couldn’t you have spoken up sooner? A little thing like this
is hardly worth so much delay. We still need some more trees and shrubs planted in
the garden, and I’ve been trying to think of someone to do the job. If you’d spoken
up earlier, it could all have been done by now.’
‘You can set me to work tomorrow, Auntie. I’ll be ready.’
Xi-feng thought for a while.
‘I don’t know that it’s a very suitable job for you. Perhaps we’d better wait until
next New Year and put you in charge of lanterns and fireworks. That’s a much bigger
job.’
‘Look, Auntie: you give me this planting job now, then; if you’re satisfied with the
way I do it, you can give me the other job later on.’
Xi-feng laughed:
‘You certainly know how to fish with a long line! — All right, then! It’s not really my
affair, but I suppose as your Uncle has mentioned it to me — I’m only going next door
now and I shall be back again after lunch. Come round a little after midday to get the
money and you shall start your planting the day after tomorrow.’
She told the servants to harness the carriage and drove off to make her call.
Beside himself with joy, Jia Yun now continued on his way to Sunset Studio to look for
Bao-yu. In point of fact Bao-yu had gone off first thing that morning to call on the
Prince of Bei-jing; but no one seemed to know about this, and Jia Yun sat waiting
expectantly throughout the whole of the morning. Having waited until noon, he
inquired whether Xi-feng was back yet, and being informed that she was, he wrote
out a form of receipt, took it round to the Lians’ apartment, and sent in word that he
had called for his tally. Sunshine came out in response to his message and asked him
for the receipt, which he took indoors. Presently he reappeared and handed it back
to Jia Yun with the date and amount filled in in the blanks he had left for this purpose,
together with the precious tally which would enable him to draw the money.
Glancing at the receipt as he took it from him, Jia Yun was delighted to observe that
the figures entered were for a payment of two hundred taels of silver. He hurried off
to the counting-house to collect it, then home once more to share the joyful news
with his mother.
Next day he was off long before daylight to look up Ni Er and pay him back the loan.
That done, he took another fifty taels of the silver with him and called on a
nurseryman outside the West Gate called Fang Chun, from whom he bought a large
number of trees.
At this point our narrative abandons Jia Yun’s affairs and returns to Bao-yu.
When Bao-yu, in the course of his meeting with Jia Yun, had invited Jia Yun to drop in
and spend the following day with him, the invitation was of the careless, half-serious
kind that is unfortunately typical of young gentlemen of his class. As he had made no
real effort to remember it at the time, it naturally slipped his memory the following
day. Returning now, two evenings later, from the palace of the Prince of Bei-jing
where he had been all day, he called first on his grandmother and his mother and
then returned to his own rooms in the garden and changed back into his everyday
clothes.
He decided to take a bath; and since Aroma was out, having been ‘borrowed’ by
Bao-chai to make braid buttons on a dress, Ripple and Emerald had gone off to see
about the water. Of the other senior maids, Skybright had been fetched home for her
cousin’s birthday and Musk was away ill; and the few heavy-work maids left in
attendance had all assumed that their services would not be required and had gone
off in search of their gossips. For a quarter of an hour Bao-yu was left entirely on his
own. It chanced that precisely at this mo?ment he wanted someone to get him some
tea. He had already called a couple of times without response and at his third call
two or three old charwomen came hurrying in to see what was the matter.
‘No, no: I don’t need you!’ - he waved them away im?patiently. The old women
retired, baffled.
Since there were no maids, Bao-yu saw that he would have to serve himself. He
found himself a cup and was about to take up the pot to pour himself some tea when
a voice started speaking right behind him:
‘Let me, Master Bao! You might scald yourself.’
Bao-yu jumped. The owner of the voice hurriedly relieved him of the cup.
‘Where have you been all this time?’ he said. ‘You gave me quite a start, coming up
suddenly like that!’
She handed him his tea with a smile:
‘I was in the back courtyard. I came in through the courtyard door at the back.
Didn’t you hear me coming?’
Bao-yu sipped his tea and observed her carefully. Her dress, though not shabby, was
far from new. By contrast she had a magnificent head of raven-black hair which was
done up in a simple bun. The face was rather long and thin; the build slender; the
overall impression that of a tidy, clean, graceful person.
‘Do you belong here then?’ he asked her.
‘Yes.’ She seemed amused.
‘If you do, how is it that I’ve never seen you before?’
She replied with some bitterness:
‘There are quite a few of us you’ve never seen. I’m not the only one, by any means.
How could you have seen me? I’ve never been allowed to wait on you or show myself
in your presence.’
‘Why not?’
‘I don’t think it’s for me to say. — Oh, there’s something I do have to tell you,
though. Yesterday a gentleman calling himself “Yun” came to see you. I thought you
probably wouldn’t be able to see him at the time, so I told Tealeaf to ask him round
this morning. Unfortunately by the time he came, you’d already gone off to see the
Prince—’
Their conversation was interrupted by the giggles of Ripple and Emerald who had just
entered the courtyard with a large bucket of water. Each of them held the bucket by
one hand and lifted her skirts up with the other. They were staggering under the
unaccustomed weight and slopping a good deal of the water about as they went. The
maid hurried out to relieve them. By now the giggles had given way to
recriminations:
‘Look, you’ve soaked my dress!’
‘You trod on my toe!’
They stopped to look at this person who had just issued from the young Master’s
room and saw with some surprise that it was Crimson. Putting down the water, they
hurried indoors to look. Bao-yu was there on his own. The girls were indignant. As
soon as they had prepared the bath and seen him undressed, they shut the door
after them and hurried to the other side of the building to find Crimson.
‘What were you doing in his room just now?’ they asked her accusingly.
‘I wasn’t doing anything,’ said Crimson. ‘I couldn’t find my handkerchief, so I went
to look for it round the back. He was calling for some tea and none of you happened
to be about, so I ran in and poured it out for him. And just at that moment you came
back.’
Ripple spat in her face:
‘Nasty, shameless little slut! When we asked you to fetch the water for us you said
you were busy and made us go ourselves. You didn’t waste much time, having got
him to yourself, did you? You think you’re on the way up, don’t you? Step by step.
Well, we can catch up with you, my fine lady! Why don’t you take a look at yourself in
the mirror and then ask yourself if you’re a fit person to go serving tea to the
Masters?’
‘We’d better warn the others that when he asks for tea or anything in future they
must stay where they are and let her go and get it!’
‘In that case,’ said Ripple, ‘the rest of us may as well clear off and let her have him
all to herself!’
They were still at their antiphonal taunting when an old woman arrived with a
message from Xi-feng:
‘Someone is bringing some workmen in tomorrow to plant trees, so you have all
got to be extra careful. No hanging clothes out to dry all over the place! There will be
screens put up along the line of the embankment and you are not to go running
around outside.’
‘Who’s the person in charge of the workmen?’ asked Ripple.
‘A young chap called “Yun” from up the Lane,’ said the old woman.
The name meant nothing to Ripple and Emerald, who went on to ask about other
matters; but Crimson knew it must be the young man she had met the day before in
the outer study.
Crimson’s surname was ‘Lin’. Her family had been retainers in the Jia family for
generations. Nowadays her father worked as a farm-bailiff on the family’s estates.
She was sixteen. Along with many other servants, she had originally entered the
Prospect Garden to carry out caretaking duties in the period when it was still
unoccupied. The part of it she was assigned to was the House of Green Delights. She
found it a very beautiful place to live in — very quiet and secluded. But this had
changed when Bao-yu and the girls were commanded to move in and Bao-yu had
chosen the House of Green Delights as his own residence.
Although Crimson was a very inexperienced maid, she had a measure of good looks
and a determination to better herself. She was therefore constantly on the look-out
for an opportunity of making herself known to Bao-yu and showing off her ability to
serve him. Unfortunately the little group of body-servants who had accompanied him
into the garden guarded their privileges with tooth and claw and were careful to
allow no toehold to an ambitious outsider. Today she had at last found an opening,
only to have her hopes immediately dashed by Ripple’s malice. She felt very
discouraged.
Still smarting with resentment, she heard the old woman say that Jia Yun was coming
next day into the garden. The name provoked a momentary flutter in her breast; but
she returned to her room with the same feeling of resentment bottled up inside her
and went to bed to ponder moodily on the events of the day. As the thoughts
pursued themselves round and round in her mind without object or conclusion, she
suddenly heard her name being called very softly outside her window:
‘Crimson! Crim! I’ve found your handkerchief!’ She quickly got up and went outside
to look. To her sur?prise it was Jia Yun. A maidenly confusion mantled her comely
cheek.
‘Where did you find it?’ she asked timidly.
Jia Yun laughed:
‘Come over here and I’ll show you!’
He took hold of her dress to pull her to him. Overcome with shame, she turned and
fled, but her foot caught on the thresh?old and she fell on her face.
The conclusion of this adventure will be revealed in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 25

Two cousins are subjected by witchcraft to
the assaults of demons
And the Magic Jade meets an old acquaintance while
rather the worse for wear

We have seen how Crimson, after lying a long time a prey to confused and troubled
thoughts, at last dozed off to sleep; and how later, when Jia Yun grabbed at her, she
turned and fled, only to stumble and fall on the threshold of her room. At that point
she woke in bed and discovered that she had been dreaming. She did not get to sleep
again after that, but lay tossing restlessly throughout the night.
When daylight came at last, she got up, and shortly after was joined by the other
maids who shared with her the early morning duties of sweeping the rooms and
courtyards and fetching water for the others’ washing.
Crimson’s own toilet was a simple one: a brief look in the mirror while she coiled her
hair, a quick wash, and she was ready to join the others in their sweeping.
Her encounter with Bao-yu had made a stronger impression on that impressionable
young man than she realized. He had even thought of asking for her by name to wait
upon him, but hesitated, partly from fear of offending Aroma and the rest, and partly
because he did not know what she was really like and dreaded the unpleasantness of
sending her away again if she proved unsatisfactory. The question still preoccupied
him when he woke that morning. He rose quite early and sat musing silently on his
own, making no effort to begin his toilet.
In a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see
clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside. He could
see several girls there sweeping, all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and
ornaments in their hair, but no sign of the quiet, neat girl of the day before. He went
outside in his slippers to look around, pretending that he had gone out to inspect the
flowers. He could see someone leaning on the balustrade in the south-west corner of
the cloister-like covered walk, but she was half hidden by the crab-apple tree and he
could not make out who it was. He approached and looked more closely. It was she,
yesterday’s girl, standing there on her own, apparently lost in thought. He was a little
shy of addressing her at that particular moment and was still hesi?tating when
Emerald came up and asked him to come in and wash. He had to go in again without
having spoken to her.
While Crimson stood there musing, she suddenly became aware that Aroma was
beckoning to her, and hurried up to see what she wanted.
‘Our spittoon is broken,’ Aroma said. ‘Can you go to Miss Lin’s and ask them if they
will lend us one until we can get a replacement?’
Crimson hurried off in the direction of the Naiad’s House. When she got to Green
Haze Bridge, she stopped a moment to look around. She noticed that cloth screens
had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill, and remembered that this was
the day on which the workmen were coming into the garden to plant trees. She could
just make out a knot of workmen digging a hole in the distance and Jia Yun sitting on
some rocks supervising them. She would have liked to go over, but did not quite dare,
and having collected the spit?toon, returned, in very low spirits, and lay down in her
own room to brood. The others all assumed that she must be feeling unwell and took
no notice.

*

Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-teng’s lady. A mes?sage had already been
received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day
with her. Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the
invitation was from her brother’s wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia
did not want to. Wang Zi-teng’s other sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with
his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until
the evening.
Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave
him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious
prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate
Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wang’s kang, called for a candle to be lit, and,
with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for
Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and
shortly after that informing Golden that she was standing in his light. The maids all
hated Jia Huan and took no notice — all, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a
soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was
engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly
counselled some restraint:
‘Try not to throw your weight about so!’ she said. ‘It’s silly to put people’s backs
up.’
Jia Huan scowled angrily:
‘I know what I’m doing,’ he said. ‘Don’t talk to me like a child! You’re friends with
Bao-yu nowadays, aren’t you? You don’t like me any more. I know. I’ve watched you
both.’
Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger:
‘You ungrateful thing! You’re like the dog that bit Lü Dong-bin: you don’t know a
friend when you see one.’
They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the
birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been
invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had
to eat and drink.
In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few re?spectful words to his mother,
asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with
his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mother’s bosom to be fondled
and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her
neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the day’s events.
‘You’ve been drinking again, child,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Your face is burning. All this
romping about will make you sick. Lie down quietly for a while over there!’
She made them bring him a head-rest, and he lay down behind her, towards the back
of the kang. Sunset was in?structed to massage him by gently patting his legs.
He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him, but she barely acknowledged his
questions and answered frigidly, directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia
Huan. Bao-yu seized her hand:
‘Come, my dear! You must take notice of me if I speak to you!’
He tugged at her hand as he spoke, but she snatched it from his grasp.
‘If you do that again,’ she said, ‘I shall call out!’
Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange. He had always hated Bao-yu, and this
flirting with Sunset — his Sunset — was the last straw. He must be revenged or burst.
A moment’s reflection suggested the means. He had only to feign a slight clumsiness
of the hand and it was done. The candle, brimming with molten wax, toppled straight
on to Bao-yu’s face. There was a piercing cry, which made everyone else in the room
jump. Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below. By their light
Bao-yu’s face was seen to be covered all over in wax. Torn between anguish for him
and anger with Jia Huan, Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as
possible, while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness. Xi-feng
scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants, grumbling at Jia Huan as she did
so:
‘Huan, you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met! You are simply not
fit for decent company. I don’t know why Aunt Zhao hasn’t taught you better.’
Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the
servants. She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and, summoning Aunt Zhao, directed
all her wrath upon that luckless concubine:
‘This is a fine son you bore us, I must say! He is a black-?hearted little monster! You
might at least try to teach him better. But no. Time and again I have overlooked this
sort of thing, but instead of feeling sorry, you glory in it. You think that when I do
nothing, you have got the better of me.’
Aunt Zhao was obliged to swallow her anger and endure these taunts in silence. She
climbed up onto the kang and made a show of helping the others with the injured
boy. She looked at his face. The whole left side of it was badly blistered. It was a
wonder that the eye had not been damaged. When Lady Wang saw it, she was both
full of anguish for her son and at the same time, when she thought of the
questioning to which she would inevitably be subjected by Grandmother Jia and
wondered what she would say, terrified on her own account. To relieve her fear she
turned once more on Aunt Zhao. Then, after tongue-lashing the concubine, she
comforted her beloved son and applied Antiphlogistic Ointment to the blistered part
of his face.
‘It does hurt a bit,’ said Bao-yu when she asked him, ‘but nothing very terrible.
When Grandma asks about it, we had better tell her that I did it.’
‘She’ll blame the rest of us for not looking after you properly, even if you say you
did it yourself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There’ll be a row, whatever you say.’
Lady Wang told them to see him back to his room. It was a great shock to Aroma and
the other maids when they saw him.
Dai-yu had had a dull time of it with Bao-yu away all day, and in the course of the
evening sent several times round to his room to inquire whether he was back yet. It
was in this way that she heard about his scalding. She hurried round immediately to
see for herself how he was.
She found him with a mirror in his hand, examining the extent of the damage. The
entire left side of his face was thickly plastered with ointment, from which she
deduced that the injury must be a serious one. But when she approached him to look
closer, he averted his head and waved her away. He knew how squeamish she was,
and feared that the sight of it would upset her. Dai-yu for her part was sufficiently
aware of her own weakness not to insist on looking. She merely asked him ‘whether
it hurt very badly’.
‘Not so bad as all that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘A couple of days and it will probably be all
right again.’
Dai-yu sat with him a little longer and then went back to her room.
Next day Bao-yu had to see Grandmother Jia. Although he told her that he had
burned himself through his own carelessness, the old lady, as had been predicted,
berated his attendants for having allowed the accident to happen.
Another day went by, and Bao-yu’s godmother, old Mother Ma, called round. Mother
Ma was a Wise Woman. Her special relationship with Bao-yu had been arranged in
his infancy to ensure him the protection of her powers. She was shocked by her
godson’s appearance and, on being informed of the cause, shook her head and
tutted sympathetically. She made a few signs over his face with her fingers, muttering
some gibberish as she did so, after which she assured them that he would soon be
better the malignant aura that had caused the accident was of a transitory,
impermanent nature. She turned to Grand?mother Jia:
‘Bless you, my lucky lady! Bless you dearie! You don’t know a half of the unseen
harms and dangers the Scripture tells us of. All the sons of princes and great folks the
moment they begin to grow up are followed round everywhere they go by troops of
invisible little imps—spiteful little creatures who nip them and pinch them whenever
they can. Sometimes they knock the rice bowl from their hands when they’re eating.
Sometimes they push them over when they are walking. It’s on account of these
creatures that so many young gentlemen of good family don’t live to make old
bones.’
Grandmother Jia was anxious to know if the afflicted person could be freed from
these unwelcome attentions.
‘Easily,’ said Mother Ma. ‘By doing good works. Giving a bit more to charity on the
young person’s behalf. There is another way, though. According to what the Scripture
says, there’s a Bodhisattva of Universal Light living in the Para?dise of the West who
spends his time lighting up the dark places where these evil spirits lurk, and if any
believer, male or female, will make offerings to that Bodhisattva in a proper spirit of
devoutness, he will grant their children and grandchildren his holy peace and protect
them from possession by devils and from the powers of darkness.’
‘What sort of offerings do you make to this Bodhisattva?’ Grandmother Jia asked
her.
‘Nothing very special. Apart from the usual incense offerings, we take a few pounds
of sesame oil each day and make what we call a “sea of light” by burning wicks in it.
We believe that this sea of light is the trans-substantial body of the Bodhisattva. It
has to be kept burning night and day and never allowed to go out.’
‘How much oil does it take to keep it burning for one whole day and night?’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘I should like to do this for the boy.’
‘There’s no fixed amount,’ said Mother Ma. ‘We leave it to our clients to decide
how much they want to give. There are several members of the aristocracy among
those I do this service for. Let’s see … There’s the Prince of An-nan’s lady. She’s my
biggest subscriber. Her subscription is for forty-eight pounds of oil and a pound of
lampwicks a day. Her sea of light is pretty nearly as big as a cistern. Then there’s the
Marquis of Jin-xiang’s lady: twenty pounds of oil a day. Oh, and there’s some pays for
ten pounds a day, some for eight pounds, three pounds, five pounds - all sorts. All of
them I keep their seas of light burning for them, back at my house.’
Grandmother Jia nodded thoughtfully.
‘One thing I should mention,’ said Mother Ma (observing the thoughtfulness): ‘if
the offering is for an older person — a mother or father, say — it doesn’t matter how
much you subscribe; but if it’s an older person making it for a younger one, like as it
may be Your Ladyship for Bao-yu, you don’t want to subscribe too much, or it would
overload his luck and have the opposite effect. In the case of Your Ladyship
subscribing for Bao-yu, I should suggest between five and seven pounds a day.’
‘Make it five pounds a day, then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We’ll work out the total
and send you a month’s supply every month.’
‘Amitabha, Merciful Buddha! Bless His Holy Name!’ said Mother Ma.
As a further precaution Grandmother Jia called in some of Bao-yu’s maids and told
them that in future whenever Bao-yu went out anywhere his pages were to be
provided with several strings of cash to give as alms to any itinerant monks or priests
or any poor or afflicted persons they might meet upon the way.
After seeing Grandmother Jia, Mother Ma drifted round the mansion calling at
various other apartments. Presently she came to Aunt Zhao’s room. After they had
exchanged greetings, Aunt Zhao told her little servant to pour the old woman a cup
of tea. Aunt Zhao was pasting pieces of cloth together for soling shoes with, and
Mother Ma observed that the kang around her was piled with miscellaneous
remnants of material.
‘I’m looking for something to make a pair of uppers out of, dearie,’ said Mother Ma.
‘I suppose you haven’t got an old bit of silk or an old bit of satin that would do? It
doesn’t matter about the colour.’
Aunt Zhao heaved a long-suffering sigh:
‘Take a look at this lot! You won’t find anything much worth having here. Nothing
worth having in this family ever comes my way. But you’re welcome to pick out a
couple of pieces if you don’t mind the poor quality.’
Mother Ma rummaged around in the heap, and having picked out several pieces,
stuffed them into her sleeve.
‘I sent someone round to you the other day with five hundred cash to pay for an
offering to the Medicine Bud?dha,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘Have you managed to make it
yet?’
‘Oh yes. That was done days ago.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’d do it oftener if things were a bit easier; but you
know the saying: “my heart is willing but my purse is lean”.’
‘Don’t you worry about that!’ said Mother Ma. ‘You only have to hold out a few
more years. When your Huan has grown up and got himself a job in the Service,
you’ll be able to afford all the good works you want.’
Aunt Zhao made a scornful sound in her nose:
‘Hfn! Let’s not talk about it! It’ll be no different then from what it is now: Huan and
I will never be able to compete with the Other One. It’s like the Heavenly Dragon
appearing when he comes on the scene. Mind you, I don’t hold it against the child.
He’s a good-looking boy, is Bao-yu, and you can understand the grown-ups being silly
about him. No, this is the one I can’t stand.’
As she uttered the word ‘this’, she held up two fingers. Mother Ma guessed her
meaning: ‘Number Two’ — the youn?ger of the Rong mansion’s two
daughters-in-law.
‘You mean Mrs Lian?’ she said.
Aunt Zhao’s face assumed an expression of terror. Motion?ing agitatedly to the other
to remain silent, she got up, went to the door, raised the door-blind, looked around,
and having satisfied herself that there were no eavesdroppers, came back and sat
down again, her face close to Mother Ma’s.
‘She’s a dreadful person — dreadful! If that woman doesn’t end up by carrying off
every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with, my name’s
not Zhao!’
Mother Ma sensed interesting possibilities in this conver?sation, and was quick to
explore them:
‘It doesn’t need you to tell me that,’ she said. ‘You surely don’t think I haven’t
noticed that? I’ve often wondered why you all let her get away with it — though I
suppose it’s probably just as well you do.’
‘My dear good woman,’ said Aunt Zhao, ‘we’ve no choice but to let her get away
with it. Who would ever have the nerve to stand up to her?
‘Well,’ said Mother Ma, ‘I don’t want to seem a trouble-maker, but if you don’t
mind my saying so, you do all seem to have acted a hit helpless about her — not that
I’m blaming you, mind. But I mean to say, even if you daren’t stand up to her openly,
there are things you could do in secret. I’m surprised you haven’t thought of it
before.’
To Aunt Zhao the words seemed to contain a hidden promise. She concealed her
pleasure.
‘What do you mean: “things we could do in secret”?’ she said. ‘I’m willing enough
to do them: it’s just that I’ve never met anyone who could tell me how. If you would
show me the way, I’d pay you. I’d pay a lot.’
Mother Ma could see that they understood each other, but she was taking no
chances.
‘Holy Name! Don’t ask me about things like that! I don’t touch that kind of business.
No, no, no. That’s wicked.’
There you are!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘That’s all the help I ever get. And I thought you were
such a kind person, always helping those in trouble. Are you prepared to stand by
and watch me and my Huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman? I
suppose it’s because you think I wouldn’t pay you.’
‘If you was to say that I am too tender-hearted to stand by and watch you and your
boy being wronged,’ said Mother Ma, ‘you would be saying no more nor less than the
truth. But I don’t know what you mean about pay. What have you got that you could
tempt me with, dearie, even if I was willing to do it for pay?’
Aunt Zhao observed that her opposition to the very idea of helping her in the desired
way had considerably weakened.
‘For someone so clever,’ she said, ‘aren’t you being rather stupid? If you help me
and it works, with the two of them safely out of the way, everything in this
household will be ours. You’ll be able to ask for what you like. Fancy not thinking of
that!’
Mother Ma lowered her head and reflected for a while in silence.
‘When that time comes and you’re safely landed,’ she said eventually, ‘you won’t
want to have anything more to do with me, dearie — not when I’ve got no proof to
show what I done for you.’
‘That’s no problem,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’ve got a few taels put by of my own savings,
and I’ve got some dresses, and there’s my jewellery. You can take some of each to be
getting on with and I can give you an IOU promising to pay you so much later on. We
can have a witness too, if you like.’
‘Are you sure?’
‘Why should I tell a lie?’ said Aunt Zhao, and summoned a trusted crone into whose
ear she whispered instructions:
‘Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps.’
The old crone nodded and went out, returning after a few minutes with a promissory
note for five hundred taels of silver. Aunt Zhao made her mark on it and then went to
the wardrobe to get out her savings. The white shine of silver and the signed and
sealed IOU dispelled whatever residual doubts the Wise Woman may have
entertained, for she seized and pocketed both with alacrity, giving hearty assurances
of her aid as she did so; then, after rummaging for some time in the capacious
waistband of her trousers, she fished out twelve little paper cut-out figures — ten of
them demons with green faces and red hair and two of them plain human figures —
and handed them to Aunt Zhao. Dropping her voice to a whisper, she instructed her
to write the eight symbols of her victims’ nativity — two for the year, two for the
month, two for the day and two for the hour — on each of the human figures, wrap
five of the demons round each of them, and slip them some?where under her
victims’ beds.
‘That’s all you have to do,’ she said. ‘I shall be doing other things at home to help
you. It’s sure to work - no question of that. But you must be very, very careful. And
you mustn’t be afraid.’
While she was still talking, one of Lady Wang’s maids came in looking for her.
‘Oh, here you are! Her Ladyship is waiting for you.’ Mother Ma went off in the
company of the maid.
And there we leave her.

*

Because of the injury to his face, Bao-yu had stopped going out of doors since his
accident and Dai-yu spent a good deal of time in his apartment talking to him.
One morning after lunch she had settled down to read, but after a couple of chapters
grew bored with the book and did some sewing instead with the maids Nightingale
and Snowgoose. When that, too, became boring, she stood for a while leaning
against the doorway, vacantly looking out. The young bamboo shoots were just
breaking through in the forecourt, and after inspecting them, she drifted out into the
Garden. Everywhere the flowers were blooming, the birds were singing, and the
water splashed and tinkled, but not a human soul was to be seen. Almost without
thinking where she was going, she made her way to the House of Green Delights. A
group of maids had fetched some water from the well and were watching the
white-eyes in the gallery giving themselves a bath. A sound of laughter came from
inside the house. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-chai were there already. Their friendly
laughter greeted Dai-yu as she entered:
‘Another one! Come in! Come in!’
‘What is this?’ said Dai-yu, joining in the good humour. ‘A party?’
‘I sent someone round to you the other day with two caddies-full of tea,’ said
Xi-feng, ‘but you were out.’
‘Yes,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m sorry: I forgot to thank you.’
‘Have you tried it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘What did you think of it?’
‘I wouldn’t ask, if I were you,’ said Bao-yu, chipping in. ‘I thought it was rotten. I
don’t know what the rest of you thought about it.’
‘I thought the flavour was all right,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The colour wasn’t up to much.’
‘That was tribute tea from Siam,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I didn’t like it at all. I thought it
wasn’t as nice as the tea we drink every day.’
‘Oh, I quite liked it,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Your palates must be more sensitive than mine.’
‘If you really like it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you’re welcome to have mine.’
‘I’ve still got quite a bit left,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If you really like it, you can have it all.’
‘Thank you very much,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll send someone round to fetch it.’
‘No, don’t do that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll send it round to you. There’s something I want
you to do for me. The person I send round about it can bring the tea as well.’
Dai-yu laughed mockingly:
‘Do you hear that, everybody? Because she’s given me a hit of her old tea, I have to
start doing odd jobs for her.’
‘That’s fair enough,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You know the rule:
“drink the family’s tea, the family’s bride-to-be”.’
Everyone laughed at this except Dai-yu, who turned her head away, blushing furiously,
and said nothing.
‘Cousin Feng will have her little joke,’ Li Wan observed to Bao-chai with a smile.
‘Do you call that a joke?’ said Dai-yu. ‘It was a silly, idle remark, and very irritating.’
She gave a snort of disgust by way of reinforcement.
Xi-feng laughed:
‘What’s so irritating about it? Look at him!’ — She pointed at Bao-yu - ‘Isn’t he
good enough for you? Good looks, good family, good income. There are no snags
that I can see. It’s a perfect match!’
Dai-yu rose and fled.
‘Oh, Frowner’s in a rage! Come back Frowner!’ Bao-chai called out after her. ‘If you
go, it will spoil all the fun.’
She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back. At the doorway they ran into Jia
Zheng’s two concubines, Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou, come to see Bao-yu. Li Wan,
Bao-chai and Bao-yu made them welcome and invited them to sit down and talk, but
Xi-feng and Dai-yu conversed with each other and rather pointedly ignored them.
Bao-chai was in the middle of saying something to the rest of the group when a maid
arrived from Lady Wang’s to say that Wang Zi-teng’s wife had come and the presence
of the young ladies was requested. Li Wan and Xi-feng rose to go. Aunt Zhao and
Aunt Zhou hurriedly took their leave.
‘I can’t go out,’ said Bao-yu. ‘For heaven’s sake don’t let Aunt Wang come over here!
- Cousin Lin!’ he called to Dai-yu. ‘Stay here a bit! There’s something I want to say to
you.’
Hearing him, Xi-feng turned back to address Dai-yu:
‘Do you hear that? Someone wants a word with you. You’d better go back and see
what he wants to say!’
She gave her a push in the direction of the house; then she and Li Wan went off, both
laughing.
When they were alone together, Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand. He smiled and
smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away.
‘Aiyo!’ he said. ‘My head!’
‘Good!’ said Dai-yu. ‘It serves you right!’
Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, jumped two or three feet into the air, and began
to shout and babble deliriously. Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell
Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-teng’s lady was with them and hurried
over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several
times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother
were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling.
Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried out to him piteously between their sobs:
‘my son!’, ‘my child!’, ‘my darling!’
Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the
household next door and Jia She, Lady Xing, Cousin Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong,
Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue and Xue Pan — not to mention Zhou Rui’s wife and a great
bevy of domestics both high and low — came hurrying into the garden, adding
numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators.
While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu, Xi-feng appeared,
brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path.
She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now, seeing people
ahead, glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou
Rui’s wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while
the others looked on helplessly, clasped her about the arms and body, wrested the
knife from her hand, and carried her off to her room. Patience and Felicity wept
piteously to see their mistress in such a state.
On this occasion even Jia Zheng’s customary impassivity seemed to have deserted
him, as he turned this way and that, uncertain on whom to direct his attention. And if
Jia Zheng was distraught, the state of the others can be imagined. Most remarkable,
perhaps, was the. spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk, one moment
afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush, the next that Bao-chai might be
ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male. Cousin Zhen, he knew for a fact,
was a notorious womanizer. Then he caught sight of Dai-yu (whom he had never seen
before) and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty.
Although no one knew what to do themselves, there were a great many opinions
about what ought to be done. Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the
malignant spirits, some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out, some
offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master
and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff; yet in spite of prayers, incantations,
divin?ation, and all the expedients that faith and physic could pro?vide, there was no
visible improvement in the condition of the patients. At sundown Wang Zi-teng’s lady
took her leave and went home.
Next day she made another visit to inquire after them. This was followed by visits
from the wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew the Marquis, from Lady Xing’s brothers’
wives, and from the wives of other marriage connections of the family. Bottled
charm-water, wonder-working monks and Taoists and highly recommended
physicians were also sent round to the mansion by various friends and relations.
But the cousins continued delirious and lay on their beds burning with fever and
babbling incomprehensibly. At nightfall they became even worse, so that the maids
and even the older women no longer dared go near them. The two of them had to be
carried into Lady Wang’s room on their beds and set down there side by side so that
Jia Yun and a group of pages could watch over them in shifts throughout the night.
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Aunt Xue stayed near at hand, refusing
to budge, though unable to do anything but sit by and weep. Jia She and Jia Zheng,
afraid that their mother’s health would suffer, displayed their con?cern by keeping
themselves and everyone else up throughout most of the night. There were lights
burning everywhere and hardly anyone slept at all.
Jia She continued to hunt everywhere for monks and ex?orcists reputed able to cure
diseases of the mind. Finally, Jia Zheng, who saw that their methods were all useless,
lost patience with him and tried to make him stop:
‘Young people will die if they must. Nothing can alter fate. And that they are fated
to die would appear from the fact that all efforts to cure them have been unavailing. I
think we should allow them to die in peace.’
But Jia She took no notice, and the commotion continued as before.
By the third day the patients were so weakened that they lay on their beds
motionless and their breathing was scarcely perceptible. The whole family had by
now abandoned hope and were already making preparations for their laying-out.
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Jia Lian, Patience and Aroma had cried themselves into
a state bordering on prostration. Only Aunt Zhao was cheerful — though she did her
best to look miserable.
Early on the fourth day Bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to
Grandmother Jia:
‘From now on I can no longer stay in this family. You must get my things ready and
let me go.’
To the old lady the words were a tearing of heart from body; but Aunt Zhao, who also
heard them, had the temerity to urge their acceptance:
‘Your Ladyship shouldn’t take it so hard. It’s already all up with the boy. We should
be getting his grave clothes ready so that he can go in peace. It will be better that
way. If we won’t let him go now, when he’s ready, it will only make more suffering for
him in the world to come…’
She would have gone on, but Grandmother Jia spat in her face. No empty gesture: it
was a full gob of spittle.
‘Evil woman! May your tongue rot! How do you know it’s all up with him? You want
him to die, don’t you? But if you think you will gain by his death, you must be
dreaming; because if he does die, I shall hold you responsible. It’s your spiteful
meddling that has forced him to do all this studying. You have reduced the poor child
to such a state that the mere sight of his father makes him more scared than a mouse
with the cat after it. You have done this, you and the others of your kind. And now I
suppose, if you succeed in murdering him, you will be satisfied. But don’t imagine
you will escape me — any of you!’
She railed and wept. Jia Zheng was close at hand while she was saying all this and
was deeply distressed by it. Per?emptorily dismissing the concubine, he tried to calm
his mother and reasoned against the injustice of her charges.
It was unfortunate that just at that moment a servant should have come in to
announce that ‘the two coffins that had been ordered were now ready’. The words
were as oil upon fire. The old lady blazed.
‘Who gave orders for those coffins to be made? Where is the man who made them?
Go and get the man who made those coffins! Flog him to death!’
Suddenly, as she raged and stormed, the faint tock tock of a holy man’s wooden fish
was heard upon the air and a high monotone chant that kept time with the beat:
‘Na-mah A-mi-ta-bha Bo-dhi-satt-va!
Mer-ci-ful de-li-ve-rer!
All a-fflic-ted and tor-men-ted,
               All a-ttacked by e-vil spi-rits,
        All de-mo-ni-ac po-sse-ssion,
        I cure,
        I cure,
        I cure.’

Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang at once sent someone into the street to see who it
was. The source of the chanting proved to be a disreputable-looking Buddhist monk.
Stone describes him in the following quatrain:

A bottle nose he had and shaggy brows,
Through which peeped eyes that twinkled like bright Stats.
His robe was patched and torn, his feet straw-shod,
His unclean pate blotched with unsightly scars.

He was accompanied by a lame Taoist, for whom a similar quatrain has been supplied
by our poetical Stone:

Up, down he hopped on his unequal legs,
From mud and puddle not a stitch left dry.
Yet, if you asked him where his dwelling was,
‘Westward of Paradise’ he would reply.

Jia Zheng had them invited in and asked them what monas?tery they were from. The
monk was genially dismissive:
‘There is no need for Your Worship to waste time on formalities. Suffice it to say
that I heard you had sickness in this house and have come to cure it.
‘Two members of this family have, indeed, fallen victims to some kind of
witchcraft,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Might one inquire what charm you intend to cure them
with?’
‘Charm?’ The monk laughed. ‘You already possess in your own house a precious
object capable of curing them. What other charm is necessary?’
Jia Zheng gave a start.
‘To be sure. My son was born with a piece of jade whose inscription makes some
such claim - “Dispels the harms of witchcraft”. But as you see, it does not appear to
possess the power it lays claim to.’
‘That is because the world and its temptations have confused it,’ said the monk. ‘It
certainly used to have the power. If you will have the goodness to fetch it for me and
allow me to hold it in my hand and say a wee prayer over it, I think I can undertake to
bring the power back again.’
Jia Zheng took the Magic Jade from Bao-yu’s neck and handed it to the monk, who
held it on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a sigh:
‘Thirteen years, old friend, since we first met under Green-sickness Peak! Time
certainly flies. But you have not finished with this world yet, you know. Dear, dear,
dear! You aren’t the Stone you were, are you?


—Time was you lived in perfect liberty,
Your heart alike from joy and sorrow free,
Till, by the smelter’s alchemy transformed,
Into the world you came to purchase misery.

By the bye, I am sorry you have been having such a disagree?able experience these
last few days.


—Vain sensual joys the jade’s sheen have besmirched;
The poor bird droops, in its close prison perched.
From drunken dreaming one day you’ll recover:
Then, when all debts are paid, the play will soon be over.’

When the monk had finished apostrophizing the stone, he rubbed it and polished it
between his hands and muttered some strange-sounding words over it.
‘There! Its power has now been restored.’ He handed it back to Jia Zheng. ‘But you
must be careful that it does not become contaminated again. Hang it above the
threshold of the bedroom and let no women apart from the patient’s own mother
and grandmother go inside. If you will do that, I can guarantee a complete recovery
in thirty-three days.’
Jia Zheng would have liked to detain the monk for tea and offer him some
remuneration, but he and the Taoist slipped quietly away and could not be traced.
The monk’s directions were scrupulously followed. Lady Wang guarded the doorway
in person and prevented any unauthorized person from getting into the bedroom. By
evening the sufferers had regained consciousness and said they were hungry. This
news, so precious to the ears of Lady Jia and Lady Wang, who at once had rice gruel
brought in to feed them with, was relayed to the girls in the outer room.
‘Bless His Holy Name!’ Dai-yu murmured fervently.
Bao-chai laughed, but said nothing. The others were mystified.
‘Why do you laugh, Cousin Bao?’ Xi-chun asked her.
‘I was thinking how busy He of the Holy Name must be,’ Bao-chai said. ‘Apart from
working for the salvation of all sentient beings, He has to protect the sick and hasten
their recovery — not to mention watching over plighted couples to make sure that
they marry and live happily ever after. What a lot He has to keep Him busy! Don’t you
find the thought rather amusing?’
Dai-yu affected scorn, but was blushing hotly.
‘You are all horrid. Instead of following good examples, you all imitate Feng and
make nasty, cheap jokes all the time.’
She raised the portiere and went out.
But if you wish to know more, you will have to wait for the next chapter.




CHAPTER 26

A conversation on Wasp Waist Bridge is a cover for
communication of a different kind
And a soliloquy overhead in the Naiad’s House reveals
unsuspected depths of feeling

By the time the thirty-three days’ convalescence had ended, not only were Bao-yu’s
health and strength completely restored, but even the burn-marks on his face had
vanished, and he was allowed to move back into the Garden.
It may be recalled that when Bao-yu’s sickness was at its height, it had been found
necessary to call in Jia Yun with a number of pages under his command to take turns
in watch?ing over him. Crimson was there too at that time, having been brought in
with the other maids from his apartment. During those few days she and Jia Yun
therefore had ample opportunity of seeing each other, and a certain familiarity
began to grow up between them.
Crimson noticed that Jia Yun was often to be seen sporting a handkerchief very much
like the one she had lost. She nearly asked him about it, but in the end was too shy.
Then, after the monk’s visit, the presence of the menfolk was no longer required and
Jia Yun went back to his tree-planting. Though Crimson could still not dismiss the
matter entirely from her mind, she did not ask anyone about it for fear of arousing
their suspicions.
A day or two after their return to Green Delights, Crimson was sitting in her room,
still brooding over this handkerchief business, when a voice outside the window
inquired whether she was in. Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she
recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself.
‘Yes, I’m in,’ she said. ‘Come inside!’
Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle.
‘I’m in luck!’ she said. ‘I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked
for some tea to be taken round to Miss Lin’s for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job
of taking it. When I got there, Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old
Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids, so when she saw me she just said
“Here you are!” and gave me two big handfuls of it. I’ve no idea how much it is. Will
you look after it for me, please?’
She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins. Crimson carefully
counted them for her and put them away in a safe place.
‘What’s been the matter with you lately?’ said Melilot. ‘If you ask me, I think you
ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some
medicine.’
‘Silly!’ said Crimson. ‘I’m perfectly all right. What should I want to go home for?’
‘I know what, then,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Lin’s very weakly. She’s always taking
medicine. Why don’t you ask her to give you some of hers? It would probably do just
as well.’
‘Oh, nonsense!’ said Crimson. ‘You can’t take other peo?ple’s medicines just like
that!’
‘Well, you can’t go on in this way,’ said Melilot, ‘never eating or drinking properly.
What will become of you?
‘Who cares?’ said Crimson. ‘The sooner I’m dead the better!’
‘You shouldn’t say such things,’ said Melilot, ‘It isn’t right.’
‘Why not?’ said Crimson. ‘How do you know what is on my mind?
Melilot shook her head sympathetically.
‘I can’t say I really blame you,’ she said. ‘Things are very difficult here at times. Take
yesterday, for example. Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and
there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery, all those who had the trouble of
nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades. Well
now, I can understand the very young ones like me not being included, but why
should they leave you out? I felt really sorry for you when I heard that they’d left you
out. Aroma, of course, you’d expect to get more than anyone else. I don’t blame her
at all. In fact, I think it’s owing to her. Let’s be honest: none of us can compare with
Aroma. I mean, even if she didn’t always take so much trouble over everything, no
one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share. What makes me so angry
is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when every?one
knows they’re only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu. Doesn’t it make you
angry?’
‘I don’t see much point in getting angry,’ said Crimson. ‘You know what they said
about the mile-wide marquee: “Even the longest party must have an end”? Well,
none of us is here for ever, you know. Another four or five years from now when
we’ve each gone our different ways it won’t matter any longer what all the rest of us
are doing.’
Little Melilot found this talk of parting and impermanence vaguely affecting and a
slight moisture was to be observed about her eyes. She thought shame to cry
without good cause, however, and masked her emotion with a smile:
‘That’s perfectly true. Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things he’s
going to do to his rooms and the clothes he’s going to have made and everything, just
as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in.’
Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilot’s simplicity or at Bao-yu’s
improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came
running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl’s horns. She was
carrying some patterns and sheets of paper.
‘You’re to copy out these two patterns.’
She threw them in Crimson’s direction and straightway darted out again. Crimson
shouted after her:
‘Who are they for, then? You might at least finish your message before rushing off.
What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for
you and you’re afraid they’ll get cold?’
‘They’re for Mackerel.’ The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer
through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam,
plim-plam, plim-plam, as fast as she had come.
Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a
brush to trace them with. After rummaging for several minutes she had only
succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use.
‘Funny!’ she said. ‘I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day ...’
She thought a bit, then laughed at herself as she remembered:
‘Of course. Oriole took it, the evening before last.’ She turned to Melilot. ‘Would
you go and get it for me, then?’
‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Aroma’s waiting for me to fetch some boxes
for her. You’ll have to get it yourself.’
‘If Aroma’s waiting for you, why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time?’
said Crimson. ‘If I hadn’t asked you to go and get it, she wouldn’t have been waiting,
would she? Lazy little beast!’
She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of
Bao-chai’s courtyard. She was just passing by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when she
caught sight of Bao-yu’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Li, coming from the opposite direction
and stood respectfully aside to wait for her.
‘Where have you been, Mrs Li?’ she asked her. ‘I didn’t expect to see you here.’
Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand:
‘What do you think, my dear: His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who
does the tree-planting — “Yin” or “Yun” or whatever his name is — so Nannie has to
go and ask him in. Let’s hope Their Ladyships don’t find out about it. There’ll be
trouble if they do.’
‘Are you really going to ask him in?’
‘Yes. Why?’
Crimson laughed:
‘If your Mr Yun knows what’s good for him, he won’t agree to come.’
‘He’s no fool,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Why shouldn’t he?’
‘Any way, if he does come in,’ said Crimson, ignoring her question, ‘you can’t just
bring him in and then leave him, Mrs Li. You’ll have to take him back again yourself
afterwards. You don’t want him wandering off on his own. There’s no knowing who
he might bump into.’
(Crimson herself, was the secret hope.)
‘Gracious me! I haven’t got that much spare time,’ said Nannie Li. ‘All I’ve done is
just to tell him that he’s got to come. I’ll send someone else to fetch him in when I
get back presently - one of the girls, or one of the older women, maybe.’
She hobbled off on her stick, leaving Crimson standing there in a muse, her mission
to fetch the tracing-brush mo?mentarily forgotten. She was still standing there a
minute or two later when a little maid came along, who, seeing that it was Crimson,
asked her what she was doing there. Crimson looked up. It was Trinket, another of
the maids from Green Delights.
‘Where are you going?’ Crimson asked her.
‘I’ve been sent to fetch Mr Yun,’ said Trinket. ‘I have to bring him inside to meet
Master Bao.’
She ran off on her way.
At the gate to Wasp Waist Bridge Crimson ran into Trinket again, this time with Jia
Yun in tow. His eyes sought Crim?son’s; and hers, as she made pretence of conversing
with Trinket, sought his. Their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished; then
Crimson felt herself blushing, and turning away abruptly, she made off for Allspice
Court.

*
Our narrative now follows Jia Yun and Trinket along the winding pathway to the
House of Green Delights. Soon they were at the courtyard gate and Jia Yun waited
outside while she went in to announce his arrival. She returned presently to lead him
inside.
There were a few scattered rocks in the courtyard and some clumps of jade-green
plantain. Two storks stood in the shadow of a pine-tree, preening themselves with
their long bills. The gallery surrounding the courtyard was hung with cages of unusual
design in which perched or fluttered a wide variety of birds, some of them
gay-plumaged exotic ones. Above the steps was a little five-frame penthouse building
with a glimpse of delicately-carved partitions visible through the open doorway,
above which a horizontal board hung, inscribed with the words

CRIMSON JOYS AND GREEN DELIGHTS


‘So that’s why it’s called “The House of Green Delights”’ Jia Yun told himself. ‘The
name is taken from the inscription.’
A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements:
‘Come on in! It must be two or three months since I first forgot our appointment!’
Jia Yun recognized the voice as Bao-yu’s and hurried up the steps inside. He looked
about him, dazzled by the bril?liance of gold and semi-precious inlay-work and the
richness of the ornaments and furnishings, but unable to see Bao-yu in the midst of it
all. To the left of him was a full-length mirror from behind which two girls now
emerged, both about fifteen or sixteen years old and of much the same build and
height. They addressed him by name and asked him to come inside. Slightly
overawed, he muttered something in reply and hurried after them, not daring to take
more than a furtive glance at them from the corner of his eye. They ushered him into
a tent-like summer ‘cabinet’ of green net, whose principal furniture was a tiny
lacquered bed with crimson hangings heavily patterned in gold. On this Bao-yu,
wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers, was reclining, book in hand.
He threw the book down as Jia Yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming
smile. Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting. Bidden to sit, he
modestly placed himself on a bedside chair.
‘After I invited you round to my study that day,’ said Bao-yu, ‘a whole lot of things
seemed to happen one after the other, and I’m afraid I quite forgot about your visit.’
Jia Yun returned his smile:
‘Let’s just say that it wasn’t my luck to see you then. But you have been ill since
then, Uncle Bao. Are you quite better now?’
‘Quite better, thank you. I hear you’ve been very busy these last few days.’
‘That’s as it should be,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But I’m glad you are better, Uncle. That’s a
piece of good fortune for all of us.’
As they chatted, a maid came in with some tea. Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she
approached, but his eyes were on her. She was tall and rather thin with a long oval
face, and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt
and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress.
In the course of his brief sojourn among them in the early days of Bao-yu’s illness, Jia
Yun had got by heart the names of most of the principal females of Bao-yu’s
establishment. He knew at a glance that the maid now serving him tea was Aroma.
He was also aware that she was in some way more important than the other maids
and that to be waited on by her in the seated presence of her master was an honour.
Jumping hastily to his feet he addressed her with a modest smile:
‘You shouldn’t pour tea for me, Miss! I’m not like a visitor here. You should let me
pour for myself!’
‘Oh do sit down!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t have to be like that in front of the maids!’
‘I know,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But a body-servant! I don’t like to presume.’
He sat down, nevertheless, and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a
number of unimportant topics. He told him which household kept the best troupe of
players, which had the finest gardens, whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the
best parties, and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets. Jia
Yun did his best to keep up with him. After a while Bao-yu showed signs of flagging,
and when Jia Yun, observing what appeared to be fatigue, rose to take his leave, he
did not very strongly press him to stay.
‘You must come again when you can spare the time,’ said Bao-yu, and ordered
Trinket to see him out of the Garden.
Once outside the gateway of Green Delights, Jia Yun looked around him on all sides,
and having ascertained that there was no one else about, slowed down to a more
dawdling pace so that he could ask Trinket a few questions. Indeed, the little maid
was subjected to quite a catechism: How old was she? What was her name? What
did her father and mother do? How many years had she been working for his Uncle
Bao? How much pay did she get a month? How many girls were there working for
him altogether? Trinket seemed to have no objection, however, and answered each
question as it came.
‘That girl you were talking to on the way in,’ he said, ‘isn’t her name “Crimson”?’
Trinket laughed:
‘Yes. Why do you ask?’
‘I heard her asking you about a handkerchief. Only it just so happens that I picked
one up.’
Trinket showed interest.
‘She’s asked me about that handkerchief of hers a number of times. I told her, I’ve
got better things to do with my time than go looking for people’s handkerchiefs. But
when she asked me about it again today, she said that if I could find it for her, she’d
give me a reward. Come to think of it, you were there when she said that, weren’t
you? It was when we were outside the gate of Allspice Court. So you can bear me out.
Oh Mr Jia, please let me have it if you’ve picked it up and I’ll be able to see what she
will give me for it!’
Jia Yun had picked up a silk handkerchief a month pre?viously at the time when his
tree-planting activities had just started. He knew that it must have been dropped by
one or another of the female inmates of the Garden, but not knowing which, had not
so far ventured to do anything about his dis?covery. When earlier on he had heard
Crimson question Trinket about her loss, he had realized, with a thrill of pleasure,
that the handkerchief he had picked up must have been hers. Trinket’s request now
gave him just the opening he required. He drew a handkerchief of his own from
inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile:
‘I’ll give it to you on one condition. If she lets you have this reward you were
speaking of; you’ve got to let me know. No cheating, mind!’
Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed
of the outcome, and having seen him out of the Garden, went back again to look for
Crimson.

*

Our narrative returns now to Bao-yu.
After disposing of Jia Yun, Bao-yu continued to feel ex?tremely lethargic and lay back
on the bed with every appear?ance of being about to doze off to sleep. Aroma
hurried over to him and, sitting on the edge of the bed, roused him with a shake:
‘Come on! Surely you are not going to sleep again? You need some fresh air. Why
don’t you go outside and walk around for a bit?’
Bao-yu took her by the hand and smiled at her.
‘I’d like to go,’ he said, ‘but I don’t want to leave you.’
‘Silly!’ said Aroma with a laugh. ‘Don’t say what you don’t mean!’
She hoicked him to his feet.
‘Well, where am I going to go then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just feel so bored.’
‘Never mind where, just go out!’ said Aroma. ‘If you stay moping indoors like this,
you’ll get even more bored.’
Bao-yu followed her advice, albeit half-heartedly, and went out into the courtyard.
After visiting the cages in the gallery and playing for a bit with the birds, he ambled
out of the courtyard into the Garden and along the batik of Drenched Blossoms
Stream, pausing for a while to look at the goldfish in the water. As he did so, a pair of
fawns came running like the wind from the hillside opposite. Bao-yu was puzzled.
There seemed to be no reason for their mysterious terror. But just then little Jia Lan
came running down the same slope after them, a tiny bow clutched in his hand.
Seeing his uncle ahead of him, he stood politely to attention and greeted him
cheerfully:
‘Hello, Uncle. I didn’t know you were at home. I thought you’d gone out.’
‘Mischievous little blighter, aren’t you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you want to go
shooting them for, poor little things?’
‘I’ve got no reading to do today,’ said Jia Lan, ‘and I don’t like to hang about doing
nothing, so I thought I’d practise my archery and equitation.’
‘Goodness! You’d better not waste time jawing, then,’ said Bao-yu, and left the
young toxophilite to his pursuits.
Moving on, without much thinking where he was going, he came presently to the
gate of a courtyard.
Denser than feathers on the phoenix’ tail
The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragon’s moan.
The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet
had, without conscious direction, carried him to the Naiad’s House. Of their own
accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard.
The House seemed silent and deserted, its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to
the ground; but as he approached the window, he detected a faint sweetness in the
air, traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green
gauze of the casement. He pressed his face to the gauze; but before his eyes could
distinguish anything, his ear became aware of a long, languorous sigh and the sound
of a voice speaking:
‘Each day in a drowsy waking dream of love.’
Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker. He could see her now. It was Dai-yu, of
course, lying on her bed, stretching herself and yawning luxuriously.
He laughed:
‘Why “each day in a drowsy waking dream of love”?’ he asked through the window
(the words were from his beloved Western Chamber); then going to the doorway he
lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room.
Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face
with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu
went over intending to turn her back again, but just at that moment Dai-yu’s old
wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels:
‘Miss Lin’s asleep, sir. Would you mind coming back again after she’s woken up?’
Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh:
‘Who’s asleep?’
The three old women laughed apologetically.
‘Sorry, miss. We thought you were asleep. Nightingale! Come inside now! Your
mistress is awake.’
Having shouted for Nightingale, the three guardians of morality retired.
‘What do you mean by coming into people’s rooms when they’re asleep?’ said
Dai-yu, smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the bed’s edge patting her hair into shape.
At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little
misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him. He sank into a chair and
smiled back at her:
‘What was that you were saying just now before I came in?’
‘I didn’t say anything,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her:
‘Put that on your tongue, girl! I heard you say it.’ While they were talking to one
another, Nightingale came in.
‘Nightingale,’ said Bao-yu, ‘what about a cup of that excellent tea of yours?’
‘Excellent tea?’ said Nightingale. ‘There’s nothing very special about the tea we
drink here. If nothing but the best will do, you’d better wait for Aroma to come.’
‘Never mind about him!’ said Dai-yu. ‘First go and get me some water!’
‘He is our guest,’ said Nightingale. ‘I can’t fetch you any water until I’ve given him
his tea.’ And she went to pour him a cup.
‘Good girl!’ said Bao-yu.

‘If with your amorous mistress I should wed,
‘Tis you, sweet maid, must make our bridal bed.’

The words, like Dai-yu’s languorous line, were from Western Chamber, but in
somewhat dubious taste. Dai-yu was dreadfully offended by them. In an instant the
smile had vanished from her face.
‘What was that you said?’ He laughed:
‘I didn’t say anything.’ Dai-yu began to cry.
‘This is your latest amusement, I suppose. Every time you hear some coarse
expression outside or read some crude, disgusting book, you have to come back here
and give me the benefit of it. I am to become a source of entertainment for the
menfolk now, it seems.’
She rose, weeping, from the bed and went outside. Bao-yu followed her in alarm.
‘Dearest coz, it was very wrong of me to say that, but it just slipped out without
thinking. Please don’t go and tell! I promise never to say anything like that again.
May my mouth rot and my tongue decay if I do!’
Just at that moment Aroma came hurrying up:
‘Quick!’ she said. ‘You must come back and change. The Master wants to see you.’
The descent of this thunderbolt drove all else from his mind and he rushed off in a
panic. As soon as he had changed, he hurried out of the Garden. Tealeaf was waiting
for him outside the inner gate.
‘I suppose you don’t know what he wants to see me about?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘I should hurry up, if I were you,’ said Tealeaf. ‘All I know is that he wants to see you.
You’ll find out why soon enough when you get there.’
He hustled him along as he spoke.
They had passed round the main hall, Bao-yu still in a state of fluttering
apprehensiveness when there was a loud guffaw from a corner of the wall. It was Xue
Pan, clapping his hands and stamping his feet in mirth.
‘Ho! Ho! Ho! You’d never have come this quickly if you hadn’t been told that Uncle
wanted you!’
Tealeaf, also laughing, fell on his knees. Bao-yu stood there looking puzzled. It was
some moments before it dawned on him that he had been hoaxed. Xue Pan was by
this time being apologetic — bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how
sorry he was:
‘Don’t blame the lad!’ he said. ‘It wasn’t his fault. I talked him into it.’
Bao-yu saw that he could do nothing, and might as well accept with a good grace.
‘I don’t mind being made a fool of,’ he said, ‘but I think it was going a bit far to
bring my father into it. I think perhaps I’d better tell Aunt Xue and see what she
thinks about it all.’
‘Now look here, old chap,’ said Xue Pan, getting agitated, ‘it was only because I
wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker. I admit it was very wrong of me to make free
with your Parent, but after all, you’ve only got to mention my father next time you
want to fool me and we’ll be quits!’
‘Aiyo!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Worse and worse!’ He turned to Tealeaf: ‘Treacherous little
beast! What are you still kneeling for?’
Tealeaf kotowed and rose to his feet.
‘Look,’ said Xue Pan. ‘I wouldn’t have troubled you other?wise, only it’s my birthday
on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I
don’t know where they got them from but they’ve given me:
a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as
long as that;
a huge great melon, look, as big as that;
a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that;
and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute
from Siam.
Don’t you think it was clever of them to get me those things? Maybe not so much the
sturgeon and the sucking-pig. They’re just expensive. But where would you go to get
a piece of lotus root or a melon like that? However did they get them to grow so big?
I’ve given some of the stuff to Mother, and while I was about it I sent some round to
your grandmother and Auntie Wang, but I’ve still got a lot left over. I can’t eat it all
myself: it would be unlucky. But apart from me, the only person I can think of who is
worthy to eat a present like this is you. That’s why I came over specially to invite you.
And we’re lucky, because we’ve got a little chap who sings coming round as well. So
you and I will be able to sit down and make a day of it, eh? Really enjoy ourselves.’
Xue Pan, still talking, conducted Bao-yu to his ‘study’, where Zhan Guang, Cheng
Ri-xing, Hu Si-lai and Dan Ping-ren (the four donors of the feast) and the young singer
he had mentioned were already waiting. They rose to welcome Bao-yu as he entered.
When the bowings and courtesies were over and tea had been taken, Xue Pan called
for his servants to lay. A tremendous bustle ensued, which seemed to go on for quite
a long time before everything was finally ready and the diners were able to take their
places at the table.
Bao-yu noticed sliced melon and lotus root among the dishes, both of unusual quality
and size.
‘It seems wrong to be sharing your presents with you before I have given you
anything myself,’ he said jokingly.
‘Yes,’ said Xue Pan. ‘What are you planning to give me for my birthday next month?
Something new and out of the ordinary, I hope.’
‘I haven’t really got anything much to give you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Things like money and
food and clothing I don’t want for, but they’re not really mine to give. The only way I
could give you something that would really be mine would be by doing some
calligraphy or painting a picture for you.’
‘Talking of pictures,’ said Xue Pan genially, ‘that’s reminded me. I saw a set of dirty
pictures in someone’s house the other day. They were real beauties. There was a lot
of writing on top that I didn’t pay much attention to, but I did notice the signature. I
think it was “Geng Huang”, the man who painted them. They were really good!’
Bao-yu was puzzled. His knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both
past and present was not inconsiderable, but he had never in all his experience come
across a ‘Geng Huang’. After racking his brains for some moments he suddenly began
to chuckle and called for a writing-brush. A writing-brush having been produced by
one of the servants, he wrote two characters with it in the palm of his hand.
‘Are you quite sure the signature you saw was “Geng Huang”?’ he asked Xue Pan.
‘What do you mean?’ said Xue Pan. ‘Of course I’m sure.’
Bao-yu opened his hand and held it up for Xue Pan to see:
‘You sure it wasn’t these two characters? They are quite similar.’
The others crowded round to look. They all laughed when they saw what he had
written:
‘Yes, it must have been “Tang Yin”. Mr Xue couldn’t have been seeing straight that
day. Ha! Ha! Ha!’
Xue Pan realized that he had made a fool of himself, but passed it off with an
embarrassed laugh:
‘Oh, Tankin’ or wankin’,’ he said, ‘what difference does it make, anyway?’
Just then ‘Mr Feng’ was announced by one of the servants, which Bao-yu knew could
only mean General Feng Tang’s son, Feng Zi-ying. Xue Pan and the rest told the boy
to bring him in immediately, but Feng Zi-ying was already striding in, talking and
laughing as he went. The others hurriedly rose and invited him to take a seat.
‘Ha!’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘No need to go out then. Enjoyin’ yourselves at home, eh?
Very nice too!’
‘It’s a long time since we’ve seen you around,’ said Bao-yu. ‘How’s the General?’
‘Fahver’s in good health, thank you very much,’ said Feng Zi-ying, ‘but Muvver
hasn’t been too well lately. Caught a chill or somethin’.’
Observing with glee that Feng Zi-ying was sporting a black eye, Xue Pan asked him
how he had come by it:
‘Been having a dust-up, then? Who was it this time? Looks as if he left his
signature!’
Feng Zi-ying laughed:
‘Don’t use the mitts any more nowadays — not since that time I laid into Colonel
Chou’s son and did him an injury. That was a lesson to me. I’ve learned to keep my
temper since then. No, this happened the other day durin’ a huntin’ ex?pedition in
the Iron Net Mountains. I got flicked by a gos?hawk’s wing.’
‘When was this?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘We left on the twenty-eighth of last month,’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘Didn’t get back till a
few days ago.’
‘Ah, that explains why I didn’t see you at Shen’s party earlier this month,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘I meant at the time to ask why you weren’t there, but I forgot. Did you go
alone on this expedition or was the General there with you?’
‘Fahver most certainly was there,’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘I was practically dragged along
in tow. Do you think I’m mad enough to go rushin’ off in pursuit of hideous hardships
when I could be sittin’ comfortably at home eatin’ good food and drinkin’ good wine
and listenin’ to the odd song or two? Still, some good came of it. It was a lucky
accident.’
As he had now finished his tea, Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them
his story at leisure, but Feng Zi-?ying rose to his feet again and declined.
‘I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you,’ he said, ‘but there’s
somethin’ very important I’ve got to see Fahver about now, so I’m afraid I really must
refuse.’
But Xue Pan, Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with
this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table.
‘Now look here, this is too bad!’ Feng Zi-ying good-hum?ouredly protested. ‘All the
years we’ve been knockin’ around togevver we’ve never before insisted that a fellow
should have to stay if he don’t want to. The fact is, I really can’t. Oh well, if I must
have a drink, fetch some decent-sized cups and I’ll just put down a couple of quick
ones!’
This was dearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced. Two
sconce-cups were brought and ceremoniously filled, Bao-yu holding the cups and Xue
Pan pouring from the wine-kettle. Feng Zi-ying drank them standing, one after the
other, each in a single breath.
‘Now come on,’ said Bao-yu, ‘let’s hear about this “lucky accident” before you go!’
Feng Zi-ying laughed:
‘Couldn’t tell it properly just now,’ he said. ‘It’s somethin’ that needs a special party
all to itself. I’ll invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the
details then. There’s a favour I want to ask too, by the bye, so we’ll be able to talk
about that then as well.’
He made a determined movement towards the door.
‘Now you’ve got us all peeing ourselves with curiosity!’ said Xue Pan. ‘You might at
least tell us when this party is going to be, to put us out of our suspense.’
‘Not more than ten days’ time and not less than eight,’ said Feng Zi-ying; and going
out into the courtyard, he jumped on his horse and clattered away.
Having seen him off, the others went in again, reseated themselves at table, and
resumed their potations. When the party finally broke up, Bao-yu returned to the
Garden in a state of cheerful inebriation. Aroma, who had had no idea what the
summons from Jia Zheng might portend and was still wondering anxiously what had
become of him, at once demanded to know the cause of his condition. He gave her a
full account of what had happened.
‘Well really!’ said Aroma. ‘Here were we practically beside ourselves with anxiety,
and all the time you were there enjoying yourself! You might at least have sent word
to let us know you were all right.’
‘I was going to send word,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Of course I was. But then old Feng arrived
and it put it out of my mind,’
At that moment Bao-chai walked in, all smiles.
‘I hear you’ve made a start on the famous present,’ she said.
‘But surely you and your family must have had some al?ready ?’ said Bao-yu.
Bao-chai shook her head:
‘Pan was very pressing that I should have some, but I refused. I told him to save it
for other people. I know I’m not really the right sort of person for such superior
delicacies. If I were to eat any, I should be afraid of some frightful nemesis overtaking
me.’
A maid poured tea for her as she spoke, and conversation of a desultory kind
proceeded between sips.

*
Our narrative returns now to Dai-yu.
Having been present when Bao-yu received his summons, Dai-yu, too, was greatly
worried about him - the more so as the day advanced and he had still not returned.
Then in the evening, some time after dinner, she heard that he had just got back and
resolved to go over and ask him exactly what had happened. She was sauntering
along on the way there when she caught sight of Bao-chai some distance ahead of
her, just entering Bao-yu’s courtyard. Continuing to amble on, she came presently to
Drenched Blossoms Bridge, from which a large number of different kinds of fish were
to be seen swimming about in the water below. Dai-yu did not know what kinds of
fish they were, but they were so beautiful that she had to stop and admire them, and
by the time she reached the House of Green Delights, the courtyard gate had been
shut for the night and she was obliged to knock for ad?mittance.
Now it so happened that Skybright had just been having a quarrel with Emerald, and
being thoroughly out of temper, was venting some of her ill-humour on the lately
arrived Bao-chai, complaining sotto voce behind her back about ‘people who were
always inventing excuses to come dropping in and who kept other people staying up
half the night when they would like to be in bed’. A knock at the gate coming in the
midst of these resentful mutterings was enough to make her really angry.
‘They’ve all gone to bed,’ she shouted, not even bothering to inquire who the caller
was. ‘Come again tomorrow!’
Dai-yu was aware that Bao-yu’s maids often played tricks on one another, and it
occurred to her that the girl in the courtyard, not recognizing her voice, might have
mistaken her for another maid and be keeping her locked out for a joke. She
therefore called out again, this time somewhat louder than before:
‘Come on! Open up, please! It’s me.’
Unfortunately Skybright had still not recognized the voice.
‘I don’t care who you are,’ she replied bad-temperedly. ‘Master Bao’s orders are
that I’m not to let anyone in.’
Dumbfounded by her insolence, Dai-yu stood outside the gate in silence. She could
not, however much she felt like it, give vent to her anger in noisy expostulation.
‘Although they are always telling me to treat my Uncle’s house as my own,’ she
reflected, ‘I am still really an outsider. And now that Mother and Father are both
dead and I am on my own, to make a fuss about a thing like this when I am living in
some?one else’s house could only lead to further unpleasantness.’
A big tear coursed, unregarded, down her cheek.
She was still standing there irresolute, unable to decide whether to go or stay, when
a sudden volley of talk and laughter reached her from inside. It resolved itself, as she
listened attentively, into the voices of Bao-yu and Bao-chai. An even bitterer sense of
chagrin took possession of her. Suddenly, as she hunted in her mind for some
possible reason for her exclusion, she remembered the events of the morning and
concluded that Bao-yu must think she had told on him to his parents and was
punishing her for her betrayal.
‘But I would never betray you!’ she expostulated with him in her mind. ‘Why
couldn’t you have asked first, before letting your resentment carry you to such
lengths? If you won’t see me today, does that mean that from now on we are going
to stop seeing each other altogether?’
The more she thought about it the more distressed she became.

Chill was the green moss pearled with dew
And chill was the wind in the avenue;

but Dai-yu, all unmindful of the unwholesome damp, had withdrawn into the shadow
of a flowering fruit-tree by the corner of the wall, and grieving now in real earnest,
began to cry as though her heart would break. And as if Nature herself were affected
by the grief of so beautiful a creature, the crows who had been roosting in the trees
round about flew up with a great commotion and removed themselves to another
part of the Garden, unable to endure the sorrow of her weeping.

Teats filled each flower and grief their hearts perturbed,
And silly birds were from their nests disturbed.

The author of the preceding couplet has given us a quatrain in much the same vein:

Few in this world fair Frowner’s looks surpassed,
None matched her store of sweetness unexpressed.
The first sob scarcely from her lips had passed
When blossoms fell and birds flew off distressed.

As Dai-yu continued weeping there alone, the courtyard door suddenly opened with
a loud creak and someone came out.
But in order to find out who it was, you will have to wait for the next volume.

TO CONTINUE OUR STORY,

As Dai-yu stood there weeping, there was a sudden creak of the courtyard gate and
Bao-chai walked out, accompanied by Bao-yu with Aroma and a bevy of other maids
who had come out to see her off. Dai-yu was on the point of stepping forward to
question Bao-yu, but shrank from embarrassing him in front of so many people.
Instead she slipped back into the shadows to let Bao-chai pass, emerging only when
Bao-yu and the rest were back inside and the gate was once more barred. She stood
for a while facing it, and shed a few silent tears; then, realizing that it was pointless
to remain standing there, she turned and went back to her room and began, in a
listless, mechanical manner, to take off her ornaments and prepare herself for the
night.
Nightingale and Snowgoose had long since become habitu?ated to Dai-yu’s moody
temperament; they were used to her unaccountable fits of depression, when she
would sit, the picture of misery, in gloomy silence broken only by an occasional gusty
sigh, and to her mysterious, perpetual weeping, that was occasioned by no
observable cause. At first they had tried to reason with her, or, imagining that she
must be grieving for her parents or that she was feeling homesick or had been upset
by some unkindness, they would do their best to comfort her. But as the months
lengthened into years and she still continued exactly the same as before, they
gradually became accustomed and no longer sought reasons for her behaviour. That
was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery,
remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves
with their own affairs.
She sat, motionless as a statue, leaning against the back of the bed, her hands
clasped about her knees, her eyes full of tears. It had already been dark for some
hours when she finally lay down to sleep.
Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence.

*

Next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month, the day on which, this year, the
festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall. To be precise, the festival’s official
commencement was on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month at two o’clock in
the afternoon. It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to
the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer; it is
about this time that the blossom begins to fail; and tradition has it that the
flower-spirits, their work now completed, go away on this day and do not return until
the following year. The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party
for the flowers.
This charming custom of ‘speeding the fairies’ is a special favourite with the fair sex,
and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches
and palan?quins out of willow-twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants
from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find, which they
fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs. Soon
every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering
sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers. Moving about in the
midst of it all, the girls in their brilliant summer dresses, beside which the most vivid
hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy, added the final touch of
brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour.
All the young people — Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi?chun, Li Wan, Xi-feng and
her little girl and Caltrop, and all the maids from all the different apartments — were
outside in the Garden enjoying themselves — all, that is, except Dai-yi, whose
absence, beginning to be noticed, was first commented on by Ying-chun:
‘What’s happened to Cousin Lin? Lazy girl! Surely she can’t still be in bed at this
hour?’
Bao-chai volunteered to go and fetch her:
‘The rest of you wait here; I’ll go and rout her out for you,’ she said; and breaking
away from the others, she made off in the direction of the Naiad’s House.
While she was on her way, she caught sight of élégante and the eleven other little
actresses, evidently on their way to join in the fun. They came up and greeted her,
and for a while she stood and chatted with them. As she was leaving them, she
turned back and pointed in the direction from which she had just come:
‘You’ll find the others somewhere over there,’ she said. ‘I’m on my way to get Miss
Lin. I’ll join the rest of you presently.’
She continued, by the circuitous route that the garden’s con?tours obliged her to take,
on her way to the Naiad’s House. Raising her eyes as she approached it, she suddenly
became aware that the figure ahead of her just disappearing inside it was Bao-yu.
She stopped and lowered her eyes pensively again to the ground.
‘Bao-yu and Dai-yu have known each other since they were little,’ she reflected.
‘They are used to behaving uninhibitedly when they are alone together. They don’t
seem to care what they say to one another; and one is never quite sure what sort of
mood one is going to find them in. And Dai-yu, at the best of times, is always so
touchy and suspicious. If I go in now after him, he is sure to feel embarrassed and she
is sure to start imagining things. It would be better to go back without seeing her.’
Her mind made up, she turned round and began to retrace her steps, intending to go
back to the other girls; but just at that moment she noticed two enormous
turquoise-coloured butterflies a little way ahead of her, each as large as a child’s fan,
fluttering and dancing on the breeze. She watched them fascinated and thought she
would like to play a game with them. Taking a fan from inside her sleeve and holding
it outspread of her, she followed them off the path and into the grass.
To and fro fluttered the pair of butterflies, sometimes alight?ing for a moment, but
always flying off again before she could reach them. Once they seemed on the point
of flying across the little river that flowed through the midst of the garden and
Bao-chai had to stalk them with bated breath for fear of start?ling them out on to the
water. By the time she had reached the Raindrop Pavilion she was perspiring freely
and her interest in the butterflies was beginning to evaporate. She was about to turn
back when she became aware of a low murmur of voices coming from inside the
pavilion.
Raindrop Pavilion was built in such a way that it projected into the middle of the pool
into which the little watercourse widened out at this point, so that on three of its
sides it looked out on to the water. It was surrounded by a verandah, whose railing
followed the many angles formed by the bays and projections of the base. In each of
its wooden walls there was a large paper-covered casement of elegantly patterned
lattice-work.
Hearing voices inside the pavilion, Bao-chai halted and in?clined her ear to listen.
‘Are you sure this is your handkerchief?’ one of the voices was saying. ‘If it is, take it;
but if it isn’t, I must return it to Mr Yun.’
‘Of course it’s mine,’ said the second voice. ‘Come on, let me have it!’
‘Are you going to give me a reward? I hope I haven’t taken all this trouble for
nothing.’
‘I promised you I would give you a reward, and so I shall. Surely you don’t think I
was deceiving you?’
‘All right, I get a reward for bringing it to you. But what about the person who
picked it up? Doesn’t he get anything?’
‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said the second voice. ‘He’s one of the masters. A master
picking up something belonging to one of us should give it back as a matter of course.
How can there be any question of rewarding him?’
‘If you don’t intend to reward him, what am I supposed to tell him when I see him?
He was most insistent that I wasn’t to give you the handkerchief unless you gave him
a reward.’ There was a long pause, after which the second voice re?plied:
‘Oh, all right. Let him have this other handkerchief of mine then. That will have to
do as his reward - But you must swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone else about
this.’
‘May my mouth rot and may I die a horrible death if I ever tell anyone else about
this, amen!’ said the first voice.
‘Goodness!’ said the second voice again. ‘Here we are talk?ing away, and all the
time someone could be creeping up out?side and listening to every word we say. We
had better open these casements; then even if anyone outside sees us, they’ll think
we are having an ordinary conversation; and we shall be able to see them and know
in time when to stop.’
Bao-chai, listening outside, gave a start.
‘No wonder they say “venery and thievery sharpen the wits”,’ she thought. ‘If they
open those windows and see me here, they are going to feel terribly embarrassed.
And one of those voices sounds like that proud, peculiar girl Crimson who works in
Bao-yu’s room. If a girl like that knows that I have overheard her doing something she
shouldn’t be doing, it will be a case of “the desperate dog will jump a wall, the
desperate man will hazard all”: there’ll be a great deal of trouble and I shall be
involved in it. There isn’t time to hide. I shall have to do as the cicada does when he
jumps out of his skin: give them something to put them off the scent—’
There was a loud creak as the casement yielded. Bao-chai advanced with deliberately
noisy tread.
‘Frowner!’ she called out gaily. ‘I know where you’re hid?ing.’
Inside the pavilion Crimson and Trinket, who heard her say this and saw her
advancing towards them just as they were opening the casement, were speechless
with amazement; but Bao-chai ignored their confusion and addressed them genially:
‘Have you two got Miss Lin hidden away in there?’
‘I haven’t seen Miss Lin,’ said Trinket.
‘I saw her just now from the river-bank,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She was squatting down
over here playing with something in the water. I was going to creep up and surprise
her, but she spotted me before I could get up to her and disappeared round this
corner. Are you sure she’s not hiding in there?’
She made a point of going inside the pavilion and searching; then, coming out again,
she said in a voice loud enough for them to hear:
‘If she’s not in the pavilion, she must have crept into that grotto. Oh well, if she’s
not afraid of being bitten by a snake — !’
As she walked away she laughed inwardly at the ease with which she had extricated
herself from a difficult situation.
‘I think I’m fairly safely out of that one,’ she thought. ‘I wonder what those two will
make of it.’
What indeed! Crimson believed every word that Bao-chai had said, and as soon as
the latter was at a distance, she seized hold of Trinket in alarm:
‘Oh, how terrible! If Miss Lin was squatting there, she must have heard what we
said before she went away.’
Her companion was silent.
‘Oh dear! What do you think she’ll do?’ said Crimson.
‘Well, suppose she did hear,’ said Trinket, ‘it’s not her backache. If we mind our
business and she minds hers, there’s no reason why anything should come of it.’
‘If it were Miss Bao that had heard us, I don’t suppose anything would,’ said
Crimson; ‘but Miss Lin is so critical and so intolerant. If she heard it and it gets about
— oh dear!’
But just at that moment Caltrop, Advent, Chess and Scribe were seen approaching
the pavilion, and Crimson and Trinket had to drop the subject in a hurry and join in a
general conversation. Crimson noticed Xi-feng standing half-way up the rockery
above the little grotto, beckoning. Breaking away from the others, she bounded up to
her with a smiling face:
‘What can I do for you, madam?’
Xi-feng ran an appraising eye over her. A neat, pretty, pleasantly-spoken girl, she
decided, and smiled at her graciously:
‘I have come here without my maids and need someone to a message back to my
apartment. I wonder if you are clever enough to get it right.’
‘Tell me the message, madam. If I don’t get it right and make a mess of it, it will be
up to you to punish me.’
‘Which of the young ladies do you work for?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’d better know, so that I
can explain to her if she asks for you while you are doing my errand.’
‘I work for Master Bao,’ said Crimson.
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Ah ha! You work for Master Bao. No wonder. Very well, then, if he asks for you
while you are away, I shall explain. I want you to go to my apartment and tell
Patience that there is a roll of money under the stand of the Ru-ware dish on the
table in the outside room. There are a hundred and twenty taels of silver in it to pay
the embroiderers with. Tell her that when Zhang Cai’s wife comes for it, she is to
weigh it out in front of her before handing it over. And there’s one other thing.
There’s a little purse at the head of the bed in my inside room. I want you to bring it
to me.’
‘Yes madam,’ said Crimson, and hurried off.
Returning shortly afterwards, she found that Xi-feng was no longer on the rockery;
but Chess had just emerged from the little grotto beneath it and was standing there
doing up her sash. Crimson ran down to speak to her:
‘Excuse me, did you see where Mrs Lian went to?’
‘’Fraid I didn’t notice,’ said Chess.
Crimson looked around her. Bao-chai and Tan-chun were standing at the edge of the
pool looking at the fish. She went up to them:
‘Excuse me, does either of you young ladies happen to know where Mrs Lian went
to just now, please?’
‘Try Mrs Zhu’s place,’ said Tan-chun.
Crimson hurried off in the direction of Sweet-rice Village. On her way she ran
head-on into a party of maids consisting of Skybright, Mackerel, Emerald, Ripple,
Musk, Scribe, Pic?ture and Oriole.
‘Here, what are you gadding about like this for?’ said Sky?bright as soon as she saw
who it was. ‘The flowers want watering; the birds need feeding; the stove for the
tea-water needs seeing to. You’ve no business to go wandering around outside!’
‘Master Bao gave orders yesterday that the flowers were only to be watered every
other day,’ said Crimson. ‘I fed the birds when you were still fast asleep in bed.’
‘What about the stove?’ said Emerald.
‘It isn’t my day for the stove,’ said Crimson. ‘The tea-water today has nothing to do
with me.’
‘Listen to Miss Pert!’ said Mackerel. ‘I wouldn’t bother about her, if I were you —
just leave her to wander about as she pleases.’
‘I’m not “wandering about”, if you really want to know,’ said Crimson. ‘If you really
want to know, Mrs Lian sent me outside to take a message and to fetch something
for her.’
She held up the purse for them to see; at which they were silent. But when they had
passed each other, Skybright laughed sneeringly:
‘You can see why she’s so uppity. She’s on the climb again. Look at her — all
cock-a-hoop because someone’s given her a little message to carry! And she probably
doesn’t even know who it’s about. Well, one little message isn’t going to get her very
far. It’s what happens in the long run that counts. Now if she were clever enough to
climb her way right out of this Garden and stay there, that would be really
something!’
These words were spoken for Crimson to hear, but in such a way that she was unable
to answer them. She had to swallow her anger and hurry on to look for Xi-feng.
Xi-feng was in Li Wan’s room, as Tan-chun had predicted, and Crimson found the two
of them in conversation. She went up to Xi-feng and delivered her message:
‘Patience says that she found the silver just after you had gone and took care of it;
and she says that when Zhang Cai’s wife came for it she did weigh it out in front of
her before giving it to her to take away.’
Crimson now produced the purse and handed it to Xi-feng.
Then she added:
‘Patience told me to tell you that Brightie has just been in to inquire what your
instructions were for his visit, and she said that she gave him a message to take
based on the things she thought you would want him to say.’
‘Oh?’ said Xi-feng, amused. ‘And what was this message “based on the things she
thought I would want him to say”?’
‘She said he was to tell them: “Our lady hopes your lady is well and she says that
the Master is away at present and may not be back for another day or two, but your
lady is not to worry; and when the lady from West Lane is better, our lady will come
with their lady to see your lady. And our lady says that the lady from West Lane sent
someone the other day with a message from the elder Lady Wang saying that she
hopes our lady is well and will she please see if our Lady Wang can let her have a few
of her Golden Myriad Macrobiotic Pills; and if she can, will our lady please send
someone with them to her, because someone will be going from there to the elder
Lady Wang’s in a few days’ time and they will be able to take them for her — ”’
Crimson was still in full spate when Li Wan interrupted her with a laugh:
‘What an extraordinary number of “ladies”! I hope you can understand what it’s all
about, Feng. I’m sure I can’t!’
‘I’m not surprised,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There are four or five different households
involved in that message.’ She smiled graciously at Crimson. ‘You’re a clever girl, my
dear, to have got it all right — not like the simpering little ninnies I usually have to
put up with. You have no idea, cousin,’ she said, turn?ing to Li Wan again. ‘Apart from
the one or two girls and one or two older women that I always keep about me, I just
dread talking to servants nowadays. They take such an inter?minable time to tell you
anything — so long-winded! And the airs and graces they give themselves! and the
simpering! and the urn-ing and ah-ing! If they only knew how it makes me fume! Our
Patience used to be like that when she first came to me. I used to say to her, “Do you
think it makes you seem glamorous, all that affected humming? — like a little gnat!” I
had to talk to her several times about it before she would mend her ways.’
Li Wan laughed.
‘I suppose if they were all peppercorns like you, it would be all right.’
‘This girl’s all right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Those two messages she gave me just now may
not have been very long ones, but you could see how clear-cut her delivery of them
was.’
She smiled at Crimson again.
‘How would you like to come and work for me and be my god-daughter? With a
little grooming from me you could go far.’
Crimson suppressed a giggle.
‘Why do you laugh?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I suppose you think I’m too young to be your
god-mother. You’re very silly if you think that. You just ask around a bit: there are
plenty much older than you who’d give their ears to be my god-daughter. What I’m
offering you is a very special favour.’
Crimson smiled.
‘I wasn’t laughing because of that, madam. I was laughing because you had got the
generation wrong. My mother is your god-daughter already. If you made me your
god-daughter too, I should be my own mother’s sister!’
‘Who is your mother?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Do you mean to say that you don’t know who this girl is that you’ve been talking to
all this time?’ said Li Wan. ‘This is Lin Zhi-xiao’s daughter.’
Xi-feng registered surprise:
‘You mean to tell me that this is the Lins’ daughter?’ She laughed. ‘That couple of
old sticks? I can never get a peep out of either of them. I’ve always maintained that
Lin Zhi-xiao and his wife were the perfect match: one hears nothing and the other
says nothing. Well! To think they should have produced a bright little thing like this
between them! — How old are you?’ she asked Crimson.
‘Sixteen.’
‘And what’s your name?’
‘“Crimson”, madam. I used to be called “Jade”, but they made me change it on
account of Master Bao.’
Xi-feng looked away with a frown of displeasure.
‘I should think so too,’ she muttered. ‘Odious people! One can hear them saying it:
“We’ve got a ‘Jade’ in our family the same as you”, or some such impertinence.’
She turned to Li Wan again:
‘I don’t think you know, Wan, but I told this girl’s mother that as Lai Da’s wife is so
busy nowadays that she doesn’t even know who half the girls in the household are
any longer, I wanted her to pick out a couple of likely-looking girls to work under me.
Now she promised that she would do this; but you see, not only has she not done so,
but she’s actually gone and sent her own daughter to work for someone else. Do you
suppose she really thinks her girl would have had such a ter?rible time with me?’
‘Don’t be so touchy,’ said Li Wan. ‘Her mother is not to blame. The girl had already
started service in the Garden before you ever spoke to her about it.’
‘Oh well, in that case,’ said Xi-feng, recovering her good humour, ‘I’ll have a word
with Bao-yu about it tomorrow. I’ll tell him to find someone else and let me have this
girl to work under me. Still — ’ she turned to Crimson, ‘perhaps we ought to ask the
party most concerned if she is willing.’
Crimson smiled.
‘As to being willing or not, madam, I don’t think it’s my place to say. But I do know
this: that if I was to work for you, I should get to know what’s what and all the inside
and out?side of household management. I’m sure it would be wonder?ful
experience.’
Just then a maid arrived from Lady Wang’s asking for Xi?-feng, who promptly excused
herself to Li Wan and left. Crimson returned to Green Delights — where our story
now leaves her.

*

We now return to Dai-yu, who, having slept so little the night before, was very late
getting up on the morning of the festival. Hearing that the other girls were all out in
the garden ‘speeding the fairies’ and fearing to be teased by them for her lazy habits,
she hurried over her toilet and went out as soon as it was completed. A smiling
Bao-yu appeared in the gateway as she was stepping down into the courtyard.
‘Well, coz,’ he said, ‘I hope you didn’t tell on me yesterday. You had me worrying
about it all last night.’
Dai-yu turned back, ignoring him, to address Nightingale inside:
‘When you do the room, leave one of the casements open so that the parent
swallows can get in. And put the lion door?stop on the bottom of the blind to stop it
flapping. And don’t forget to put the cover back on the burner after you’ve lighted
the incense.’
She made her way across the courtyard, still ignoring him. Bao-yu, who knew nothing
of the little drama that had taken place outside his gate the night before, assumed
that she was still angry about his unfortunate lapse earlier on that same day, when
he had offended her susceptibilities with a some?what risqué quotation from The
Western Chamber. He offered her now, with energetic bowing and hand-pumping,
the apologies that the previous day’s emergency had caused him to neglect. But
Dai-yu walked straight past him and out of the gate, not deigning so much as a glance
in his direction, and stalked off in search of the others.
Bao-yu was nonplussed. He began to suspect that something more than he had first
imagined must be wrong.
‘Surely it can’t only be because of yesterday lunchtime that she’s carrying on in this
fashion? There must be something else. On the other hand, I didn’t get back until
late and I didn’t see her again last night, so how could I have offended her?’
Preoccupied with these reflections, he followed her at some distance behind.
Not far ahead Bao-chai and Tan-chun were watching the ungainly courtship dance of
some storks. When they saw Dai?-yu coming, they invited her to join them, and the
three girls stood together and chatted. Then Bao-yu arrived. Tan-chun greeted him
with sisterly concern:
‘How have you been keeping, Bao? It’s three whole days since I saw you last.’
Bao-yu smiled back at her.
‘How have you been keeping, sis? I was asking Cousin Wan about you the day
before yesterday.’
‘Come over here a minute,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I want to talk to you.’
He followed her into the shade of a pomegranate tree a little way apart from the
other two.
‘Has Father asked to see you at all during this last day or two?’ Tan-chun began.
‘No.’
‘I thought I heard someone say yesterday that he had been asking for you.’
‘No,’ said Bao-yu, smiling at her concern. ‘Whoever it was was mistaken. He
certainly hasn’t asked for me.’
Tan-chun smiled and changed the subject.
‘During the past few months,’ she said, ‘I’ve managed to save up another ten
strings or so of cash. I’d like you to take it again like you did last time, and next time
you go out, if you see a nice painting or calligraphic scroll or some amusing little
thing that would do for my room, I’d like you to buy it for me.’
‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘In the trips I make to bazaars and temple fairs,
whether it’s inside the city or round about, I can’t say that I ever see anything really
nice or out of the ordinary. It’s all bronzes and jades and porcelain and that sort of
stuff. Apart from that it’s mostly dress-making materials and clothes and things to
eat.’
‘Now what would I want things like that for?’ said Tan?-chun. ‘No, I mean
something like that little wickerwork basket you bought me last time, or the little box
carved out of bamboo root, or the little clay burner. I thought they were sweet.
Unfortunately the others took such a fancy to them that they carried them off as loot
and wouldn’t give them back to me again.’
‘Oh, if those are the sort of things you want,’ said Bao-yu laughing, ‘it’s very simple.
Just give a few strings of cash to one of the boys and he’ll bring you back a whole
cartload of them.’
‘What do the boys know about it?’ said Tan-chun. ‘I need someone who can pick
out the interesting things and the ones that are in good taste. You get me lots of nice
little things, and I’ll embroider a pair of slippers for you like the ones I made for you
last time — only this time I’ll do them more carefully.’
‘Talking of those slippers reminds me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I happened to run into Father
once when I was wearing them. He was Most Displeased. When he asked me who
made them, I naturally didn’t dare to tell him that you had, so I said that Aunt Wang
had given them to me as a birthday present a few days before. There wasn’t much he
could do about it when he heard that they came from Aunt Wang; so after a very
long pause he just said, “What a pointless waste of human effort and valuable
material, to produce things like that!” I told this to Aroma when I got back, and she
said, “Oh, that’s nothing! You should have heard your Aunt Zhao complaining about
those slippers. She was furious when she heard about them:
‘Her own natural brother so down at heel he scarcely dares show his face to people,
and she spends her time making things like that!’”’
Tan-chun’s smile had vanished:
‘How can she talk such nonsense? Why should I be the one to make shoes for him?
Huan gets a clothing allowance, doesn’t he? He gets his clothing and footwear
provided for the same as all the test of us. And fancy saying a thing like that in front
of a roomful of servants! For whose benefit was this remark made, I wonder? I make
an occasional pair of slippers just for something to do in my spare time; and if I give a
pair to someone I particularly like, that’s my own affair. Surely no one else has any
business to start telling me who I should give them to? Oh, she’s so petty!’
Bao-yu shook his head:
‘Perhaps you’re being a bit hard on her. She’s probably got her reasons.’
This made Tan-chun really angry. Her chin went up de?fiantly:
‘Now you’re being as stupid as her. Of course she’s got her reasons; but they are
ignorant, stupid reasons. But she can think what she likes: as far as I am concerned,
Sir Jia is my father and Lady Wang is my mother, and who was born in whose room
doesn’t interest me — the way I choose my friends inside the family has nothing to
do with that. Oh, I know I shouldn’t talk about her like this; but she is so idiotic about
these things. As a matter of fact I can give you an even better example than your
story of the slippers. That last time I gave you my savings to get something for me,
she saw me a few days afterwards and started telling me how short of money she
was and how difficult things were for her. I took no notice, of course. But later, when
the maids were out of the room, she began attacking me for giving the money I’d
saved to other people instead of giving it to Huan. Really! I didn’t know whether to
laugh or get angry with her. In the end I just walked out of the room and went round
to see Mother.’
There was an amused interruption at this point from Bao-chai, who was still standing
where they had left her a few minutes before:
‘Do finish your talking and come back soon! It’s easy to see that you two are
brother and sister. As soon as you see each other, you get into a huddle and start
talking about family secrets. Would it really be such a disaster if anything you are
saying were to be overheard?’
Tan-chun and Bao-yu rejoined her, laughing.
Not seeing Dai-yu, Bao-yu realized that she must have slipped off elsewhere while be
was talking.
‘Better leave it a day or two,’ he told himself on reflection. ‘Wait until her anger has
calmed down a bit.’
While he was looking downwards and meditating, he noticed that the ground where
they were standing was car?peted with a bright profusion of wind-blown flowers —
pome?granate and balsam for the most part.
‘You can see she’s upset,’ he thought ruefully. ‘She’s neg?lecting her flowers. I’ll
bury this lot for her and remind her about it next time I see her.’
He became aware that Bao-chai was arranging for him and Tan-chun to go with her
outside.
‘I’ll join you two presently,’ he said, and waited until they were a little way off
before stooping down to gather the fallen blossoms into the skirt of his gown. It was
quite a way from where he was to the place where Dai-yu had buried the
peach-blossom on that previous occasion, but he made his way towards it, over rocks
and bridges and through plantations of trees and flowers. When he had almost
reached his destination and there was only the spur of a miniature ‘mountain’
be?tween him and the burial-place of the flowers, he heard the sound of a voice,
coming from the other side of the rock, whose continuous, gentle chiding was
occasionally broken by the most pitiable and heart-rending sobs.
‘It must be a maid from one of the apartments,’ thought Bao-yu. ‘Someone has
been ill-treating her, and she has run here to cry on her own.’
He stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying. She
appeared to be reciting something:

The blossoms fade and falling fill the air,
Of fragrance and bright hues bereft and bare.
Floss drifts and flutters round the Maiden’s bower,
Or softly strikes against her curtained door.

The Maid, grieved by these signs of spring’s decease,
Seeking some means her sorrow to express,
Has rake in hand into the garden gone,
Before the fallen flowers are trampled on.

Elm-pods and willow-floss are fragrant too;
Why care, Maid, where the fallen flowers blew?
Next year, when peach and plum-tree bloom again,
Which of your sweet companions will remain?

This spring the heartless swallow built his nest
Beneath the eaves of mud with flowers compressed.
Next year the flowers will blossom as before,
But swallow, nest, and Maid will be no more.

Three hundred and three-score the year’s full tale:
From swords of frost and from the slaughtering gale
How can the lovely flowers long stay intact,
Or, once loosed, from their drifting fate draw back?
Blooming so steadfast, fallen so hard to find!
Beside the flowers’ grave, with sorrowing mind,
The solitary Maid sheds many a tear,
Which on the boughs as bloody drops appear.

At twilight, when the cuckoo sings no more,
The Maiden with her rake goes in at door
And lays her down between the lamplit walls,
While a chill rain against the window falls.

I know not why my heart’s so strangely sad,
Half grieving for the spring and yet half glad:
Glad that it came, grieved it so soon was spent.
So soft it came, so silently it went!

Last night, outside, a mournful sound was heard:
The spirits of the flowers and of the bird.
But neither bird nor flowers would long delay,
Bird lacking speech, and flowers too shy to stay.

And then I wished that I had wings to fly
After the drifting flowers across the sky:
Across the sky to the world’s farthest end,
The flowers’ last fragrant resting-place to find.

But better their remains in silk to lay
And bury underneath the wholesome clay,
Pure substances the pure earth to enrich,
Than leave to soak and stink in some foul ditch.

Can I, that these flowers’ obsequies attend,
Divine how soon or late my life will end?
Let others laugh flower-burial to see:
Another year who will be burying me?

As petals drop and spring begins to fail,
The bloom of youth, too, sickens and turns pale.
One day, when spring has gone and youth has fled.
The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead.

All this was uttered in a voice half-choked with sobs; for the words recited seemed
only to inflame the grief of the reciter — indeed, Bao-yu, listening on the other side
of the rock, was so overcome by them that he had already flung himself weeping
upon the ground.
But the sequel to this painful scene will be told in the follow?ing chapter.




CHAPTER 28

A crimson cummerbund becomes a pledge of friendship
And a chaplet of medicine-beads becomes a source of
embarrassment

ON the night before the festival, it may be remembered, Lin Dai-yu had mistakenly
supposed Bao-yu responsible for Sky-bright’s refusal to open the gate for her. The
ceremonial fare?well to the flowers of the following morning had transformed her
pent-up and still smouldering resentment into a more generalized and seasonable
sorrow. This had finally found its expression in a violent outburst of grief as she was
burying the latest collection of fallen blossoms in her flower-grave. Meditation on the
fate of flowers had led her to a contempla?tion of her own sad and orphaned lot; she
had burst into tears, and soon. after had begun a recitation of the poem whose
words we recorded in the preceding chapter.
Unknown to her, Bao-yu was listening to this recitation from the slope of the near-by
rockery. At first he merely nod?ded and sighed sympathetically; but when he heard
the words

             ‘Can I, that these flowers’ obsequies attend,
               Divine how soon or late my life will end?’

and, a little later,


‘One day when spring has gone and youth has fled,
The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead.’

he flung himself on the ground in a fit of weeping, scattering the earth all about him
with the flowers he had been carrying in the skirt of his gown.
Lin Dai-yu dead! A world from which that delicate, flower?like countenance had
irrevocably departed! It was unutterable anguish to think of it. Yet his sensitized
imagination did now consider it — went on, indeed, to consider a world from which
the others, too — Bao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and the rest — had also irrevocably
departed. Where would he be then? What would have become of him? And what of
the Garden, the rocks, the flowers, the trees? To whom would they belong when he
and the girls were no longer there to enjoy them? Passing from loss to loss in his
imagination, he plunged deeper and deeper into a grief that seemed inconsolable. As
the poet says:

          Flowers in my eyes and bird-song in my ears
          Augment my loss and mock my bitter tears.

Dai-yu, then, as she stood plunged in her own private sor?rowing, suddenly heard
the sound of another person crying bitterly on the rocks above her.
‘The others are always telling me I’m a “case”,’ she thought. Surely there can’t be
another “case” up there?’
But on looking up she saw that it was Bao-yu.
‘Pshaw!’ she said crossly to herself. ‘I thought it was another girl, but all the time it
was that cruel, hate—’
‘Hateful’ she had been going to say, but clapped her mouth shut before uttering it.
She sighed instead and began to walk away.
By the time Bao-yu’s weeping was over, Dai-yu was no longer there. He realized that
she must have seen him and have gone away in order to avoid him. Feeling suddenly
rather foolish, he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes. Then he
descended from the rockery and began to retrace his steps in the direction of Green
Delights. Quite by coincidence Dai-yu was walking along the same path a little way
ahead.
‘Stop a minute!’ he cried, hurrying forward to catch up with her. ‘I know you are
not taking any notice of me, but I only want to ask you one simple question, and then
you need never have anything more to do with me.’
Dai-yu had turned back to see who it was. When she saw that it was Bao-yu still, she
was going to ignore him again; but hearing him say that he only wanted to ask her
one ques?tion, she told him that he might do so.
Bao-yu could not resist teasing her a little.
‘How about two questions? Would you wait for two?’
Dai-yu set her face forwards and began walking on again.
Bao-yu sighed.
‘If it has to be like this now,’ he said, as if to himself; ‘it’s a pity it was ever like it
was in the beginning.’
Dai-yu’s curiosity got the better of her. She stopped walk?ing and turned once more
towards him.
‘Like what in the beginning?’ she asked. ‘And like what now?’
‘Oh, the beginning!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In the beginning, when you first came here, I was
your faithful companion in all your games. Anything I had, even the thing most dear
to me, was yours for the asking. If there was something to eat that I specially liked, I
had only to hear that you were fond of it too and I would religiously hoard it away to
share with you when you got back, not daring even to touch it until you came. We
ate at the same table. We slept in the same bed. I used to think that because we
were so close then, there would be something special about our relationship when
we grew up — that even if we weren’t particularly affectionate, we should at least
have more understanding and forbearance for each other than the rest. But how
wrong I was! Now that you have grown up, you seem only to have grown more
touchy. You don’t seem to care about me any more at all. You spend all your time
brood?ing about outsiders like Peng and Chai. I haven’t got any real brothers and
sisters left here now. There are Huan and Tan, of course; but as you know, they’re
only my half-brother and half-sister: they aren’t my mother’s children. I’m on my own,
like you. I should have thought we had so much in common - But what’s the use? I try
and try, but it gets me nowhere; and nobody knows or cares.’
At this point — in spite of himself — he burst into tears.
The palpable evidence of her own eyes and ears had by now wrought a considerable
softening on Dai-yu’s heart. A sym?pathetic tear stole down her own cheek, and she
hung her head and said nothing. Bao-yu could see that he had moved her.
‘I know I’m not much use nowadays,’ he continued, ‘but however bad you may
think me, I would never wittingly do anything in your presence to offend you. If I do
ever slip up in some way, you ought to tell me off about it and warn me not to do it
again, or shout at me — hit me, even, if you feel like it; I shouldn’t mind. But you
don’t do that. You just ignore me. You leave me utterly at a loss to know what I’m
supposed to have done wrong, so that I’m driven half frantic wondering what I ought
to do to make up for it. If I were to die now, I should die with a grievance, and all the
masses and exorcisms in the world wouldn’t lay my ghost. Only when you explained
what your reason was for ignoring me should I cease from haunting you and be
reborn into another life.’
Dai-yu’s resentment for the gate incident had by now com?pletely evaporated. She
merely said:
‘Oh well, in that case why did you tell your maids not to let me in when I came to
call on you?’
‘I honestly don’t know what you are referring to,’ said Bao-yu in surprise. ‘Strike me
dead if I ever did any such thing!’
‘Hush!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Talking about death at this time of the morning! You should be
more careful what you say. If you did, you did. If you didn’t, you didn’t. There’s no
need for these horrible oaths.’
‘I really and truly didn’t know you had called,’ said Bao-yu. Cousin Bao came and sat
with me a few minutes last night and then went away again. That’s the only call I
know about.’
Dai-yu reflected for a moment or two, then smiled.
‘ Yes, it must have been the maids being lazy. Certainly they can be very
disagreeable at such times.’
‘Yes, I’m sure that’s what it was,’ said Bao-yu. ‘When I get back, I’ll find out who it
was and give her a good talking-to.’
‘I think some of your young ladies could do with a good talking-to,’ said Dai-yu, ‘—
though it’s not really for me to say so. It’s a good job it was only me they were rude
to. If Miss Bao or Miss Cow were to call and they behaved like that to her, that would
be really serious.’
She giggled mischievously. Bao-yu didn’t know whether to laugh with her or grind his
teeth. But just at that moment a maid came up to ask them both to lunch and the
two of them went together out of the Garden and through into the front part of the
mansion, calling in at Lady Wang’s on the way.
‘How did you get on with that medicine of Dr Bao’s,’ Lady Wang asked Dai-yu as
soon as she saw her, ‘— the Court Physician? Do you think you are any better for it?’
‘It didn’t seem to make very much difference,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Grandmother has put
me back on Dr Wang’s prescription.’
‘Cousin Lin has got a naturally weak constitution, Mother,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She takes
cold very easily. These strong decoc?tions are all very well provided she only takes
one or two to dispel the cold. For regular treatment it’s probably best if she sticks to
pills.’
‘The doctor was telling me about some pills for her the other day,’ said Lady Wang,
‘but I just can’t remember the name.’
‘I know the names of most of those pills,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I expect he wanted her to
take Ginseng Tonic Pills.’
‘No, that wasn’t it,’ said Lady Wang.
‘Eight Gem Motherwort Pills?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Zhang’s Dextrals? Zhang’s Sinistrals? If
it wasn’t any of them, it was probably Dr Cui’s Adenophora Kidney Pills.’
‘No,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it was none of those. All I can remember is that there was a
“Vajra” in it.
Bao-yu gave a hoot and clapped his hands:
‘I’ve never heard of “Vajra Pills”. If there are “Vajra Pills”, I suppose there must be
“Buddha Boluses ”!’
The others all laughed. Bao-chai looked at him mockingly. ‘I should think it was
probably “The Deva-king Cardiac Elixir Pills”,’ she said.
‘Yes, yes, that’s it!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Of course! How stupid of me!’
‘No, Mother, not stupid,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s the strain. All those Vajra-kings and
Bodhisattvas have been overworking you!’
‘You’re a naughty boy to make fun of your poor mother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘A good
whipping from your Pa is what you need.’
‘Oh, Father doesn’t whip me for that sort of thing now?adays,’ said Bao-yu.
Now that we know the name of the pills, we must get them to buy some for your
Cousin Lin,’ said Lady Wang.
‘None of those things are any good,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You give me three hundred and
sixty taels of silver and I’ll make up some pills for Cousin Lin that I guarantee will have
her com?pletely cured before she has finished the first boxful.’
‘Stuff!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Whoever heard of a medicine that cost so much?’
‘No, honestly!’ said Bao-yu. ‘This prescription is a very unusual one with very
special ingredients. I can’t remember all of them, but I know they include

the caul of a first-born child;
a ginseng root shaped like a man, with the leaves still on it;
               a turtle-sized polygonum root;
and
     lycoperdon from the stump of a thousand-year-old pine-tree.


— Actually, though, there’s nothing so very special about those ingredients. They’re
all in the standard pharmacopoeia. For “sovereign remedies” they use ingredients
that would really make you jump. I once gave the prescription for one to Cousin Xue.
He was more than a year begging me for it before I would give it to him, and it took
him another two or three years and nearly a thousand taels of silver to get all the
ingredients to?gether. Ask Bao-chai if you don’t believe me, Mother.’
‘I know nothing about it,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve never heard it mentioned. It’s no good
telling Aunt to ask me.’
‘You see! Bao-chai is a good girl. She doesn’t tell lies,’ said Lady Wang.
Bao-yu was standing in the middle of the floor below the kang. He clapped his hands
at this and turned to the others appealingly.
‘But it’s the truth I’m telling you. This is no lie.’
As he turned, he happened to catch sight of Dai-yu, who was sitting behind Bao-chai,
smiling mockingly and stroking her cheek with her finger — which in sign-language
means, ‘You are a great big liar and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.’
But Xi-feng, who happened to be in the inner room super?vising the laying of the
table and had overheard the preceding remarks, now emerged into the outer room
to corroborate:
‘It’s quite true, what Bao says. I don’t think he is making it up,’ she said. ‘Not so
long ago Cousin Xue came to me asking for some pearls, and when I asked him what
he wanted them for, he said, “To make medicine with.” Then he started grumbling
about the trouble he was having in getting the right ingredients and how he had half
a mind not to make this medicine up after all. I said, “What medicine?” and he told
me that it was a prescription that Cousin Bao had given him and reeled off a lot of
ingredients — I can’t remember them now. “Of course,” he said, “I could easily
enough buy a few pearls; only these have to be ones that have been worn. That’s
why I’m asking you for them. If you haven’t got any loose ones, he said, “a few pearls
broken off a bit of jewellery would do. I’d get you something nice to replace it with.”
He was so insistent that in the end I had to break up two of my ornaments for him.
Then he wanted a yard of Imperial red gauze. That was to put over the mortar to
pound the pearls through. He said they had to be ground until they were as fine as
flour.’
‘You see!’ ‘You see!’ Bao-yu kept interjecting throughout this recital.
‘Incidentally, Mother,’ he said, when it was ended, ‘even that was only a substitute.
According to the prescription, the pearls ought really to have come from an ancient
grave. They should really have been pearls taken from jewellery on the corpse of a
long-buried noblewoman. But as one can’t very well go digging up graves and riding
tombs every time one wants to make this medicine, the prescription allows pearls
worn by the living as a second-best.’
‘Blessed name of the Lord!’ said Lady Wang. ‘What a dread?ful idea! Even if you did
get them from a grave, I can’t believe that a medicine made from pearls that had
been come by so wickedly — desecrating people’s bones that had been lying
peacefully in the ground all those hundreds of years — could possibly do you any
good.’
Bao-yu turned to Dai-yu.
‘Did you hear what Feng said?’ he asked her. ‘I hope you’re not going to say that
she was lying.’
Although the remark was addressed to Dai-yu, he winked at Bao-chai as he made it.
Dai-yu clung to Lady Wang.
‘Listen to him, Aunt!’ she wailed. ‘Bao-chai won’t be a party to his lies, but he still
expects me to be.’
‘Bao-yu, you are very unkind to your cousin,’ said Lady Wang.
Bao-yu only laughed.
‘You don’t know the reason, Mother. Bao-chai didn’t know a half of what Cousin
Xue got up to, even when she was living with her mother outside; and now that she’s
moved into the Garden, she knows even less. When she said she didn’t know, she
really didn’t know: she wasn’t giving me the lie. What you don’t realize is that Cousin
Lin was all the time sitting behind her making signs to show that she didn’t believe
me.’
Just then a maid came from Grandmother Jia’s apartment to fetch Bao-yu and Dai-yu
to lunch.
Without saying a word to Bao-yu, Dai-yu got up and, tak?ing the maid’s hand, began
to go. But the maid was reluctant.
‘Let’s wait for Master Bao and we can go together.’
‘He’s not eating lunch today,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Come on, let’s go!’
‘Whether he’s eating lunch or not,’ said the maid, ‘he’d better come with us, so that
he can explain to Her Old Lady?ship about it when she asks.’
‘All right, you wait for him then,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m going on ahead.’
And off she went.
‘I think I’d rather eat with you today, Mother,’ said Bao-yu.
‘No, no, you can’t,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Today is one of my fast-days: I shall only be
eating vegetables. You go and have a proper meal with your Grandma.’
‘I shall share your vegetables,’ said Bao-yu. Go on, you can go,’ he said, dismissing
the maid; and rushing up to the table, he sat himself down at it in readiness.
‘You others had better get on with your own lunch,’ Lady Wang said to Bao-chai
and the girls. ‘Let him do as he likes.’
‘You really ought to go,’ Bao-chai said to Bao-yu. ‘Whether you have lunch there or
not, you ought to keep Cousin Lin company. She is very upset, you know. Why don’t
you?’
‘Oh, leave her alone!’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’ll be all right presently.’
Soon they had finished eating, and Bao-yu, afraid that Grandmother Jia might be
worrying and at the same time anxious to rejoin Dai-yu, hurriedly demanded tea to
rinse his mouth with. Tan-chun and Xi-chun were much amused.
‘Why are you always in such a hurry, Bao?’ they asked him. ‘Even your eating and
drinking all seems to be done in a rush.’
‘You should let him finish quickly, so that he can get back to his Dai-yu,’ said
Bao-chai blandly. ‘Don’t make him waste time here with us.’
Bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea, and made straight for the west courtyard
where his Grandmother Jia’s apartment was. But as he was passing by the gateway of
Xi?-feng’s courtyard, it happened that Xi-feng herself was stand?ing in her doorway
with one foot on the threshold, grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping
a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her
direction.
‘Ah, just the person I wanted to see!’ she said, as soon as she caught sight of
Bao-yu. ‘Come inside. I want you to write something down for me.’
Bao-yu was obliged to follow her indoors. Xi-feng called for some paper, an inkstone
and a brush, and at once began dictating:
‘ Crimson lining-damask forty lengths, dragonet figured satin forty lengths,
miscellaneous
Imperial gauze one hundred lengths, gold necklets four, —’
‘Here, what is this?’ said Bao-yu. ‘It isn’t an invoice and it isn’t a presentation list.
How am I supposed to write it?’
‘Never you mind about that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘As long as I know what it is, that’s all
that matters. Just put it down any?how.’
Bao-yu wrote down the four items. As soon as he had done so, Xi-feng took up the
paper and folded it away.
‘Now,’ she said, smiling pleasantly, ‘there’s something I want to talk to you about. I
don’t know whether you’ll agree to this or not, but there’s a girl in your room called
“Crimson” whom I’d like to work for me. If I find you someone to re?place her with,
will you let me have her?’
‘There are so many girls in my room,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Please take any you have a fancy
to. You really don’t need to ask me about it.’
‘In that case,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll send for her straight away.’
‘Please do,’ said Bao-yu, and started to go.
‘Hey, come back!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t finished with you yet.’
‘I’ve got to see Grandma now,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you’ve got anything else to say, you
can tell me on my way back.’
When he got to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, they had all just finished lunch.
Grandmother Jia asked him if he bad had anything nice to eat with his mother.
‘There wasn’t anything nice,’ he said. ‘But I had an extra bowl of rice.’
Then, after the briefest pause:
‘Where’s Cousin Lin?’
‘In the inner room,’ said Grandmother Jia.
In the inner room a maid stood below the kang blowing on a flat-iron. Up on the kang
two maids were marking some material with a chalked string, while Dai-yu, her head
bent low over her work, was engaged in cutting something from it with her shears.
‘What are you making?’ he asked her. ‘You’ll give yourself a headache, stooping
down like that immediately after your lunch.’
Dai-yu took no notice and went on cutting.
‘That corner looks a bit creased still,’ said one of the maids. ‘it will have to be
ironed again.’
‘Leave it alone!’ said Dai-yu, laying down her shears. ‘It will be all right presently.’
Bao-yu found her reply puzzling.
Bao-chai, Tan-chun and the rest had now arrived in the outer room and were talking
to Grandmother Jia. Presently Bao-chai drifted inside and asked Dai-yu what she was
doing; then, when she saw that she was cutting material, she ex?claimed admiringly.
‘What a lot of things you can do, Dai! Fancy, even dress-making now!’
Dai-yu smiled malignantly.
‘Oh, it’s all lies, really. I just do it to fool people.’
‘I’ve got something to tell you that I think will amuse you, Dai,’ said Bao-chai
pleasantly. ‘When our cousin was holding forth about that medicine just now and I
said I didn’t know about it, I believe actually he was rather wounded.’
‘Oh, leave him alone!’ said Dai-yu. ‘He will be all right presently.’
‘Grandma wants someone to play dominoes with,’ said Bao-yu to Bao-chai. ‘Why
don’t you go and play dominoes?’
‘Oh, is that what I came for?’ said Bao-chai; but she went, notwithstanding.
‘Why don’t you go?’ said Dai-yu. ‘There’s a tiger in this room. You might get eaten.’
She said this still bending over her cutting, which she con?tinued to work away at
without looking up at him.
Finding himself once more ignored, Bao-yu nevertheless attempted to remain jovial.
‘Why don’t you come out for a bit too? You can do this cutting later.’
Dai-yu continued to take no notice.
Failing to get a response from her, he tried the maids:
‘Who told her to do this dress-making?’
‘Whoever told her to do it,’ said Dai-yu, ‘it has nothing whatever to do with Master
Bao.’
Bao-yu was about to retort, but just at that moment someone came in to say that he
was wanted outside, and he was obliged to hurry off.
Dai-yu leaned forward and shouted after him:
‘Holy Name! By the time you get back, I shall be dead.’

*

Outside the gateway to the inner quartets Bao-yu found Tea-leaf waiting.
‘Mr Feng invites you round to his house,’ said Tealeaf.
Bao-yu realized that this must be in connection with the matter Feng Zi-ying had
spoken of on the previous day. He told Tealeaf to send for his going-out clothes, and
went into his outer study to wait for them.
Tealeaf went back to the west inner gate to wait for someone who would carry a
message inside to the maids. Presently an old woman came out:
‘Excuse me, missus,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Master Bao is waiting in the outer study for his
going-out clothes. Could you take a message inside to say that he wants them?’
‘— your mother’s twat!’ said the old woman. ‘Master Bao lives in the Garden now.
All his maids are in the Garden. What do you want to come running round here for?’
Tealeaf laughed at his own mistake.
‘You’re quite right. I’m going cuckoo.’
He ran round to the gate of the Garden. As luck would have it, the boys on that gate
were playing football in the open space below the terraced walk, and when Tealeaf
had explained his errand, one of them ran off inside for him. He returned after a very
long wait, carrying a large bundle, which he handed to Tealeaf, and which Tealeaf
carried back to the outer study.
While he was changing, Bao-yu asked for his horse to be saddled, and presently set
off, taking only Tealeaf, Ploughboy, Two-times and Oldie as his attendants. When they
reached Feng Zi-ying’s gate, someone ran in to announce his arrival, and Feng Zi-ying
came out in person to greet him and led him inside to meet the company.
This comprised Xue Pan, who had evidently been waiting there for some time, a
number of boy singers, a female imper?sonator called Jiang Yu-han and a girl called
Nuageuse from the Budding Grove, a high-class establishment specializing in female
entertainers. When everyone had been introduced, tea was served.
‘Now come on!’ said Bao-yu, as he picked up the proffered cup of tea. ‘What about
this “lucky accident” you mentioned yesterday? I’ve been waiting anxiously to hear
about it ever since I saw you. That’s why I came so promptly when I got your
invitation.’
Feng Zi-ying laughed.
‘You and your cousin are such simple souls — I find it rahver touchin’! Afraid it was
pure invention, what I said yesterday. I said it to make you come, because I fought
that if I asked you outright to come and drink wiv me, you’d make excuses. Anyway, it
worked.’
The company joined in his merriment.
Wine was now brought in and everyone sat down in the places assigned to them.
Feng Zi-ying first got one of the singing-boys to pour for them; then he called on
Nuageuse to drink with each of the guests in turn.
Xue Pan, by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him, was already
beginning to be obstreperous. He seized Nuageuse by the hand and drew her
towards him:
‘If you’d sing me a nice new song - one of your specials, I’d drink a whole jarful for
you. How about it, eh?’
Nuageuse had to oblige him by taking up her lute and sing?ing the following song for
him to her own accompaniment:

              Two lovely boys
              Are both in love with me
And I can’t get either from my mind.
Both are so beautiful
So wonderful
So marvellous
To give up either one would be unkind.
Last night I promised I would go
To meet one of them in the garden where the roses grow;
The other came to see what he could find.
And now that we three are all
Here in this tribunal,
    There are no words that come into my mind.


‘There you are!’ she said. ‘Now drink your jarful!’
‘That one’s not worth a jarful,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Sing us a better one.’
‘Now just a minute,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just guzzling like this will make us drunk in no
time without giving us any real enjoyment. I’ve got a good new drinking-game for
you. Let me first drink the M.C.’s starting-cup, and I’ll tell you the rules. After that,
anyone who doesn’t toe the line will be made to drink ten Sconce-cups straight off as
a forfeit, give up his seat at the party, and spend the rest of the time pouring out
drinks for the rest of us.’
Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han agreed enthusiastically, and Bao-yu picked up one of
the extra large cups that had now been provided and drained its contents at a single
draught.
‘Now,’ he said. ‘We’re going to take four words — let’s say “upset”, “glum”, “blest”
and “content”. You have to begin by saying “The girl is —”, and then you say one of
the four words. That’s your first line. The next line has to rhyme with the first line and
it has to give the reason why the girl is whatever it says — “upset or glum” or “blest”
or content. When you’ve done all four, you’re entitled to drink the wine in front of
you. Only, before drinking it, you’ve first got to sing some new popular song; and
after you’ve drunk it, you’ve got to choose some animal or vegetable object from the
things in front of us and recite a line from a well-known poem, or an old couplet, or a
quotation from the classics—’
Before he could finish, Xue Pan was on his feet, protesting vigorously:
‘You can count me out of this. I’m taking no part in this. This is just to make a fool of
me, isn’t it?’
Nuageuse, too, stood up and attempted to push him back into his seat:
‘What are you so afraid of, a practiced drinker like you? You can’t be any worse at
this sort of thing than I am, and I’m going to have a go when my turn comes. If you
do it all right, you’ve got nothing to worry about, and even if you can’t, you’ll only be
made to drink a few cups of wine; whereas if you refuse to follow the rules at the
very outset, you’ll have to drink ten sconces straight off in a row and then be thrown
out of the party and made to pour drinks for the rest of us.’
‘Bravo!’ cried the others, clapping; and Xue Pan, seeing them united against him,
subsided.
Bao-yu now began his own turn:

    ‘The girl’s upset:
              The years pass by, but no one’s claimed her yet.
The girl looks glum:
              Her true-love’s gone to follow ambition’s drum.
    The girl feels blest:
          The mirror shows her looks are at their best.
    The girl’s content:
          Long summer days in pleasant pastimes spent.’

The others all applauded, except Xue Pan, who shook his head disapprovingly:
‘No good, no good!’ he said. ‘Pay the forfeit.’
‘Why, what’s wrong with it?’ they asked him.
‘I couldn’t understand a word of it.’
Nuageuse gave him a pinch:
‘Keep quiet and try to think what you’re going to say,’ she advised him; ‘otherwise
you’ll have nothing ready when your own turn comes and you’ll have to pay the
forfeit yourself.’
Thereupon she picked up her lute and accompanied Bao-yu as he sang the following
song:


‘Still weeping tears of blood about our separation:
Little red love-beans of my desolation.
Still blooming flowers I see outside my window growing.
Still awake in the dark I hear the wind a-blowing.
Still oh still I can’t forget those old hopes and fears.
Still can’t swallow food and drink, ’cos I’m choked with tears.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me it’s not true:
Do I look so thin and pale, do I look so blue?
Mirror, mirror, this long night bow shall I get through?
Oh—oh—oh!
Blue as the mist upon the distant mountains,
Blue as the water in the ever-flowing fountains.’

General applause — except from Xue Pan, who objected that there was ‘no rhythm’.
Bao-yu now drank his well-earned cup — the ‘pass cup’ as they call it — and, picking
up a slice of pear from the table, concluded his turn with the following quotation:


‘Rain whips the pear-tree, shut fast the door.’
Now it was Feng Zi-ying’s turn:
‘The girl’s upset:
Her husband’s ill and she’s in debt.
The girl looks glum:
The gale has turned her room into a slum.
The girl feels blest:
She’s got twin babies at the breast.
The girl’s content:
Waiting a certain pleasurable event.’
Next, holding up his cupful of wine in readiness to drink, he sang this song:
‘You’re so exciting,
And so inviting;
You’re my Mary Contrary;
You’re a crazy, mad thing.
You’re my goddess, but oh I you’re deaf to my praying:
Why won’t you listen to what I am saying?
If you don’t believe me, make a small investigation:
You will soon find out the true depth of my admiration.’

Then he drained his bumper and, picking up a piece of chicken from one of the dishes,
ended the performance, prior to popping it into his mouth, with a line from Wen
Ting-yun:


‘From moonlit cot the cry of chanticleer.’
Next it was the turn of Nuageuse:
‘The girl’s upset:’
she began,
‘Not knowing how the future’s to be met—’

Xue Pan laughed noisily.
‘That’s all right, my darling, don’t you worry! Your Uncle Xue will take care of you.’
‘Shush!’ said the others. ‘Don’t confuse her.’
She continued:


‘The girl looks glum:
Nothing but blows and hard words from her Mum— ’


‘I saw that Mum of yours the other day,’ said Xue Pan, ‘and I particularly told her
that she wasn’t to beat you.’
‘Another word from you,’ said the others, ‘and you’ll be made to drink ten cups as a
punishment.’
Xue Pan gave his own face a slap.
‘Sorry! I forgot. Won’t do it again.’

‘The girl feels blest:’
said Nuageuse,
‘Her young man’s rich and beautifully dressed.
The girl’s content:
She’s been performing in a big event.’

Next Nuageuse sang her song:


‘A flower began to open in the month of May.
Along came a honey-bee to sport and play.
He pushed and he squeezed to get inside,
But he couldn’t get in however hard he tried.
       So on the flower’s lip he just hung around,
A-playing the see-saw up and down.
Oh my honey-sweet,
Oh my sweets of sin,
If I don’t open up,
How will you get in?’

After drinking her ‘pass cup’; she picked up a peach:


‘So bonny blooms the peach-tree-o?’

It was now Xue Pan’s turn.
‘Ah yes, now, let’s see! I have to say something now, don’t I?’
‘The girl’s upset—’
But nothing followed.
‘All night, what’s she upset about then?’ said Feng Zi-ying with a laugh. ‘Buck up!’
Xue Pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his
eyes seemed about to pop out of his head. After glaring fixedly for an unconscionable
time, he said:
‘The girl’s upset—’
He coughed a couple of times. Then at last it came:


‘The girl’s upset:
She’s married to a marmoset.’

The others greeted this with a roar of laughter.
‘What are you laughing at?’ said Xue Pan. ‘That’s perfectly reasonable, isn’t it? If a
girl was expecting a proper husband and he turned out to be one of them, she’d have
cause to be upset, wouldn’t she?’
His audience were by now doubled up.
‘That’s perfectly true,’ they conceded. ‘Very good. Now what about the next bit?’
Xue Pan glared a while very concentratedly, then:


‘The girl looks glum—’

But after that was silence.
‘Come on!’ said the others. ‘Why was she glum?’

‘His dad’s a baboon with a big red bum.’

‘Ho! Ho! Ho! Pay the forfeit,’ they cried. ‘The first one was bad enough. We really
can’t let this one go.’
The more officious of them even began filling the sconce-cups for him. But Bao-yu
allowed the line.
‘As long as it rhymes,’ he said, ‘we’ll let it pass.’
‘There you are! ‘ said Xue Pan. ‘The M.C. says it’s all right. What are the rest of you
making such a fuss about?’
At this the others desisted.
‘The next two are even harder,’ said Nuageuse. ‘Shall I do them for you, dear?’
‘Piss off!’ said Xue Pan. ‘D’you think I haven’t got any good lines of my own? Listen
to this:

The girl feels blest:
In bridal bower she takes her rest.’

The others stared at him in amazement:
‘I say, old chap, that’s a bit poetical for you, isn’t it?’ Xue Pan continued
unconcernedly:


‘The girls content:
She’s got a big prick up her vent.’

The others looked away with expressions of disgust.
‘Oh dear, oh dear! Hurry up and get on with the song, then.’

‘One little gnat went hum hum hum,’

Xue Pan began tunelessly. The others looked at him open-mouthed:
‘What sort of song is that?’
Xue Pan droned on, ignoring the question:


‘Two little flies went bum bum bum,
Three little —’

Stop!’ shouted the others.
‘Sod you lot!’ said Xue Pan. ‘This is the very latest new hit. It’s called the Hum-bum
Song. If you can’t be bothered to listen to it, you’ll have to let me off the other thing.
I’ll agree not to sing the rest of the song on that condition.’
‘Yes, yes, we’ll let you off,’ they said. ‘Just don’t interfere with the rest of us, that’s
all we ask.’
This meant that it was now Jiang Yu-han’s turn to perform. This is what he said:
‘The girl’s upset:
Her man’s away, she fears he will forget.
The girl looks glum:
So short of cash she can’t afford a crumb.
The girl feels blest:
Her lampwick’s got a lucky crest.
The girl’s content:
She’s married to a perfect gent.’

Then he sang this song:


‘A mischievous bundle of charm and love,
Or an angel come down from the skies above?
Sweet sixteen
And so very green,
Yet eager to see all there is to be seen.
Aie aie aie
The galaxy’s high
In the roof of the sky,
And the drum from the tower
Sounds the midnight hour,
So trim the lamp, love, and come with me
Inside the bed-curtains, and you shall see!’

He raised the pass cup to his lips, but before drinking it, smiled round at his auditors
and made this little speech:
‘I’m afraid my knowledge of poetry is strictly limited. However, I happened to see a
couplet on someone’s wall yesterday which has stuck in my mind; and as one line in it
is about something I can see here, I shall use it to finish my turn with.’
So saying, he drained the cup and then, picking up a spray of cassia, recited the
following line:


‘The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days.’

The others all accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion of the performance. Not so
Xue Pan, however, who leaped to his feet and began protesting noisily:
‘Terrible! Pay the forfeit. Where’s the little doll? I can’t see any doll on the table.’
‘I didn’t say anything about a doll,’ said Jiang Yu-han.
    ‘What are you talking about?’
‘Come on, don’t try to wriggle out of it!’ said Xue Pan. ‘Say what you said just now
again.’


‘The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days.’

‘There you are!’ said Xue Pan.’ “Aroma”. That’s the name of a little doll. Ask him if
you don’t believe me.’ He pointed to Bao-yu.
Bao-yu looked embarrassed.
‘Cousin Xue, this time I think you do have to pay the forfeit.’
‘All right, all right!’ said Xue Pan. ‘I’ll drink.’
And he picked up the wine in front of him and drained it at a gulp.
Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han were still puzzled and asked him what this was all
about. But it was Nuageuse who explained. Immediately Jiang Yu-han was on his feet
apologiz?ing. The others reassured him.
‘It’s not your fault. “Ignorance excuses all”,’ they said.
Shortly after this Bao-yu had to take temporary leave of the company to ease his
bladder and Jiang Yu-han followed him outside. As the two of them stood side by
side under the eaves, Jiang Yu-han once more offered Bao-yu his apologies. Much
taken with the actor’s winsome looks and gentleness of man?ner, Bao-yu impulsively
took his hand and gave it a squeeze.
‘Do come round to our place some time when you are free,’ he said. ‘There’s
something I want to ask you about. You have an actor in your company called “Bijou”
whom everyone is talking about lately. I should so much like to meet him, but so far I
haven’t had an opportunity.’
‘That’s me!’ said Jiang Yu-han. “Bijou” is my stage name.’
Bao-yu stamped with delight.
‘But this is wonderful! I must say, you fully deserve your reputation. Oh dear! What
am I going to do about a First Meeting present?’
He thought for a bit, then took a fan from his sleeve and broke off its jade pendant.
‘Here you are,’ he said, handing it to Bijou. ‘It’s not much of a present, I’m afraid,
but it will do to remind you of our meeting.’
Bijou smiled and accepted it ceremoniously:
‘I have done nothing to deserve this favour. It is too great an honour. Well, thank
you. There’s rather an unusual thing I’m wearing I put it on today for the first time, so
it’s still fairly new: I wonder if you will allow me to give it to you as a token of my
warm feelings towards you?’
He opened up his gown, undid the crimson cummerbund with which his trousers
were fastened, and handed it to Bao?-yu.
‘It comes from the tribute sent by the Queen of the Madder Islands. It’s for wearing
in summer. It makes you smell nice and it doesn’t show perspiration stains. I was
given it yester?day by the Prince of Beijing, and today is the first time it s ever been
worn. I wouldn’t give a thing like this to anyone else, but I’d like you to have it. Will
you take your own sash off, please, so that I can put it on instead?’
Bao-yu received the crimson cummerbund with delight and quickly took off his own
viridian-coloured sash to give to Bijou in exchange. They had just finished fastening
the sashes on again when Xue Pan jumped out from behind and seized hold of them
both.
‘What are you two up to, leaving the party and sneaking off like this?’ he said.
‘Come on, take ‘em out again and let’s have a look!’
It was useless for them to protest that the situation was not what he imagined. Xue
Pan continued to force his unwelcome attentions upon them until Feng Zi-ying came
out and rescued them. After that they returned to the party and continued drinking
until the evening.
Back in his own apartment in the Garden, Bao-yu took off his outer clothes and
relaxed with a cup of tea. While he did so, Aroma noticed that the pendant of his fan
was missing and asked him what had become of it. Bao-yu told her that it had come
off while he was riding, and she gave the matter no more thought. But later, when he
was going to bed, she saw the magnificent blood-red sash round his waist and began
to put two and two together.
‘Since you’ve got a better sash now,’ she said, ‘do you think I could have mine back,
please?’
Bao-yu remembered, too late, that the viridian sash had been Aroma’s and that he
ought never to have given it away. He now very much regretted having done so, but
instead of apologizing, attempted to pass it off with a laugh.
‘I’ll get you another,’ he told her lightly.
Aroma shook her head and sighed.
‘I knew you still got up to these tricks,’ she said, ‘but at least you might refrain from
giving my things to those disgusting creatures. I’m surprised you haven’t got more
sense.’
She was going to say more, but checked herself for fear of provoking an explosion
while he was in his cups. And since there was nothing else she could do, she went to
bed.
She awoke at first daylight next morning to find Bao-yu smiling down at her:
‘We might have been burgled last night for all you’d have known about it — Look at
your trousers!’
Looking down, Aroma saw the sash that Bao-yu had been wearing yesterday tied
round her own waist, and knew that he must have exchanged it for hers during the
night. She tore it off impatiently.
‘I don’t want the horrible thing. The sooner you take it away the better.’
Bao-yu was anxious that she should keep it, and after a great deal of coaxing she
consented, very reluctantly, to tie it on again. But she took it off once and for all as
soon as he was out of the room and threw it into an empty chest, having first found
another one of her own to put on in its place.
Bao-yu made no comment on the change when they were together again. He merely
inquired whether anything had happened the day before, while he was out.
‘Mrs Lian sent someone round to fetch Crimson,’ said Aroma. ‘She wanted to wait
for you; but it seemed to me that it wasn’t all that important, so I took it on myself to
send her off straight away.’
‘Quite right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I already knew about it. There was no need to wait till I
got back.’
Aroma continued:
‘Her Grace sent that Mr Xia of the Imperial Bedchamber yesterday with a hundred
and twenty taels of silver to pay for a three-day Pro Viventibus by the Taoists of the
Lunar Queen temple starting on the first of next month. There are to be plays
performed as part of the Offering; and Mr Zhen and all the other gentlemen are to go
there to burn incense. Oh, and Her Grace’s presents for the Double Fifth have
arrived.’
She ordered a little maid to get out Bao-yu’s share of the things sent. There were two
Palace fans of exquisite workmanship, two strings of red musk-scented
medicine-beads, two lengths of maidenhair chiffon and a grass-woven ‘lotus’ mat to
lie on in the hot weather.
‘Did the others all get the same?’ he asked.
‘Her Old Ladyship’s presents were the same as yours with the addition of a
perfume-sceptre and an agate head-rest, and Sir Zheng’s, Lady Wang’s and Mrs Xue’s
were the same as Her Old Ladyship’s but without the head-rest; Miss Bao’s were
exactly the same as yours; Miss Lin, Miss Ying-chun, Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xi-chun
got only the fans and the beads; and Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian both got two lengths of
gauze, two lengths of chiffon, two perfume sachets and two moulded
medicine-cakes.’
‘Funny!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I wonder why Miss Lin didn’t get the same as me and why
only Miss Bao’s and mine were the same. There must have been some mistake,
surely?’
‘When they unpacked them yesterday, the separate lots were all labelled,’ said
Aroma. ‘I don’t see how there could have been any mistake. Your share was in Her
Old Ladyship’s room and I went round there to get it for you. Her Old Lady?ship says
she wants you to go to Court at four o’clock tomor?row morning to give thanks.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Bao-yu inattentively, and gave Ripple instructions to take his
presents round to Dai-yu:
‘Tell Miss Lin that I got these things yesterday and that if there’s anything there she
fancies, I should like her to keep it.’
Ripple went off with the presents. She was back in a very short time, however.
‘Miss Lin says she got some yesterday too, and will you please keep these for
yourself.’
Bao-yu told her to put them away. As soon as he had washed, he left to pay his
morning call on Grandmother Jia; but just as he was going out he saw Dai-yu coming
towards him and hurried forward to meet her.
‘Why didn’t you choose anything from the things I sent you?’
Yesterday’s resentments were now quite forgotten; today Dai-yu had fresh matter to
occupy her mind.
‘I’m not equal to the honour,’ she said. ‘You forget, I’m not in the gold and jade
class like you and your Cousin Bao. I’m only a common little wall-flower!’
The reference to gold and jade immediately aroused Bao?-yu’s suspicions.
‘I don’t know what anyone else may have been saying on the subject,’ he said, ‘but
if any such thought ever so much as crossed my mind, may Heaven strike me dead,
and may I never be reborn as a human being!’
Seeing him genuinely bewildered, Dai-yu smiled in what was meant to be a
reassuring manner.
‘I wish you wouldn’t make these horrible oaths. It’s so dis?agreeable. Who cares
about your silly old “gold and jade”, anyway?’
‘It’s hard to make you see what is in my heart,’ said Bao-yu. ‘One day perhaps you
will know. But I can tell you this. My heart has room for four people only. Grannie
and my parents are three of them and Cousin Dai is the fourth. I swear to you there
isn’t a fifth.’
‘There’s no need for you to swear,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I know very well that Cousin Dai has
a place in your heart. The trouble is that as soon as Cousin Chai comes along, Cousin
Dai gets forgotten.’
‘You imagine these things,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It really isn’t as you say.’
‘Yesterday when Little Miss Bao wouldn’t tell lies for you, why did you turn to me
and expect me to? How would you like it if I did that sort of thing to you?’
Bao-chai happened to come along while they were still talk?ing and the two of them
moved aside to avoid her. Bao-chai saw this clearly, but pretended not to notice and
hurried by with lowered eyes. She went and sat with Lady Wang for a while and from
there went on to Grandmother Jia’s. Bao-yu was already at his grandmother’s when
she got there.
Bao-chai had on more than one occasion heard her mother telling Lady Wang and
other people that the golden locket she wore had been given her by a monk, who
had insisted that when she grew up the person she married must be someone who
had ‘a jade to match the gold’. This was one of the reasons why she tended to keep
aloof from Bao-yu. The slight embarrassment she always felt as a result of her
mother’s chat?ter had yesterday been greatly intensified when Yuan-chun singled her
out as the only girl to receive the same selection of presents as Bao-yu. She was
relieved to think that Bao-yu, so wrapped up in Dai-yu that his thoughts were only of
her, was unaware of her embarrassment.
But now here was Bao-yu smiling at her with sudden interest.
‘Cousin Bao, may I have a look at your medicine-beads?’
She happened to be wearing one of the little chaplets on her left wrist and began to
pull it off now in obedience to his re?quest. But Bao-chai was inclined to plumpness
and perspired easily, and for a moment or two it would not come off. While she was
struggling with it, Bao-yu had ample opportunity to observe her snow-white arm,
and a feeling rather warmer than admiration was kindled inside him.
‘If that arm were growing on Cousin Lin’s body,’ he specu?lated, ‘I might hope one
day to touch it. What a pity it’s hers! Now I shall never have that good fortune.’
Suddenly he thought of the curious coincidence of the gold and jade talismans and
their matching inscriptions, which Dai-yu’s remark had reminded him of. He looked
again at Bao-chai—
that face like the full moon’s argent bowl;
those eyes like sloes;
those lips whose carmine hue no Art contrived;
and brows by none but Nature’s pencil lined.

This was beauty of quite a different order from Dai-yu’s. Fas?cinated by it, he
continued to stare at her with a somewhat dazed expression, so that when she
handed him the chaplet, which she had now succeeded in getting off her wrist, he
failed to take it from her.
Seeing that he had gone off into one of his trances, Bao-chai threw down the chaplet
in embarrassment and turned to go. But Dai-yu was standing on the threshold, biting
a corner of her handkerchief, convulsed with silent laughter.
‘I thought you were so delicate,’ said Bao-chai. ‘What are you standing there in the
draught for?’
‘I’ve been in the room all the time,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I just this moment went to have a
look outside because I heard the sound of something in the sky. It was a gawping
goose.’
‘Where?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let me have a look.’
‘Oh,’ said Dai-yu, ‘as soon as I went outside he flew away with a whir-r-r-’
She flicked her long handkerchief as she said this in the direction of Bao-yu’s face.
‘Ow!’ he exclaimed — She had flicked him in the eye.
The extent of the damage will be examined in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 29

In which the greatly blessed pray for yet greater blessings
And the highly strung rise to new heights of passion

WE told in the last chapter how, as Bao-yu was standing lost in one of his trances,
Dai-yu flicked her handkerchief at him and made him jump by inadvertently catching
him in the eye with it.
     ‘Who did that?’ he asked.
Dai-yu laughingly shook her head.
‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. Bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose, and I
accidentally flicked you while I was showing her how it went.’
Bao-yu rubbed his eye. He appeared to be about to say something, but then thought
better of it.
And so the matter passed.

*

Shortly after this incident Xi-feng arrived and began talking about the arrangements
that had been made for the purification ceremonies, due to begin on the first of next
month at the Taoist temple of the Lunar Goddess. She invited Bao-?chai, Bao-yu and
Dai-yu to go with her there to watch the plays.
‘Oh no!’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s too hot. Even if they were to do something we haven’t
seen before — which isn’t likely — I think I should still not want to go.’
     ‘But it’s cool there,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There are upstairs gal?leries on all three sides
that you can watch from in the shade. And if we go, I shall send someone a day or
two in advance to turn the Taoists out of that part of the temple and make it nice and
clean for us and get them to put up blinds. And I’ll ask them not to let any other
visitors in on that day. I’ve already told Lady Wang I’m going, so if you others won’t
come with me, I shall go by myself. I’m so bored lately. And it’s such a business when
we put on our own plays at home, that I can never enjoy them properly.’
‘All right then, I’ll come,’ said Grandmother Jia, who had been listening.
‘You’ll come, Grannie? Well that’s splendid, isn’t it! That means it will be just as bad
for me as it would be if I were watching here at home.’
‘Now look here,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘I shan’t want you to stand and wait on me.
Let me take the gallery facing the stage and you can have one of the side galleries all
to yourself; then you can sit down and enjoy yourself in comfort.’
Xi-feng was touched.
‘Do come!’ Grandmother Jia said to Bao-chai. ‘I’ll see that your mother comes too.
The days are so long now, and there’s nothing to do at home except go to sleep.’
Bao-chai had to promise that she would go.
Grandmother Jia now sent someone to invite Aunt Xue. The messenger was to call in
on the way at Lady Wang’s and ask her if the girls might go as well.
Lady Wang had already made it clear that she would not be going herself, partly
because she was not feeling very well, and partly because she wanted to be at home
in case any further messages arrived from Yuan-chun; but when she learned of
Grandmother Jia’s enthusiasm, she had word carried into the Garden that not just
the girls but anyone else who wanted to might go along with Grandmother Jia’s party
on the first.
When this exciting news had been transmitted throughout the Garden, the maids
some of whom hardly set foot outside their own courtyards from one year’s end to
the next were all dying to go, and those whose mistresses showed a lethargic
disinclination to accept employed a hundred different wiles to make sure that they
did so. The result was that in the end all the Garden’s inhabitants said that they
would be going. Grandmother Jia was quite elated and at once issued orders for the
cleaning and preparation of the temple theatre.
But these are details with which we need not concern our?selves.
On the morning of the first sedans, carriages, horses and people filled all the roadway
outside Rong-guo House. The stewards in charge knew that the occasion of this
outing was a Pro Viventibus ordered by Her Grace the Imperial Concubine and that
Her Old Ladyship was going in person to burn incense — quite apart from the fact
that this was the first day of the month and the first day of the Summer Festival;
con?sequently the turnout was as splendid as they could make it and far exceeded
anything that had been seen on previous occasions.
Presently Grandmother Jia appeared, seated, in solitary splendour, in a large
palanquin carried by eight bearers. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Aunt Xue followed, each in a
palanquin with four bearers. After them came Bao-chai and Dai-yu sharing a carriage
with a splendid turquoise-coloured canopy trimmed with pearls. The carriage after
them, in which Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat, had vermilion-painted wheels
and was shaded with a large embroidered umbrella. After them rode Grandmother
Jia’s maids, Faithful, Parrot, Amber and Pearl; after them Lin Dai-yu’s maids,
Nightingale, Snowgoose and Delicate; then Bao-chai’s maids, Oriole and Apricot; then
Ying-chun’s maids, Chess and Tangerine; then Tan-chun’s maids, Scribe and Ebony;
then Xi-chun’s maids, Picture and Landscape; then Aunt Xue’s maids, Providence and
Prosper, sharing a carriage with Caltrop and Caltrop’s own maid, Advent; then Li
Wan’s maids, Candida and Casta; then Xi-feng’s own maids, Patience, Felicity and
Crimson, with two of Lady Wang’s maids, Golden and Suncloud, whom Xi-feng had
agreed to take with her, in the carriage behind. In the carriage after them sat another
couple of maids and a nurse holding Xi-feng’s little girl. Yet more carriages followed
carrying the nannies and old women from the various apart?ments and the women
whose duty it was to act as duennas when the ladies of the household went out of
doors. The street was packed with carriages as far as the eye could see in either
direction, and Grandmother Jia’s palanquin was well on the way to the temple before
the last passengers in the rear had finished taking their places. A confused hubbub of
laughter and chatter rose from the line of carriages while they were doing so,
punctuated by an occasional louder and more dis?tinctly audible protest, such as:
‘I’m not sitting next to you!’
or,
‘You’re squashing the Mistress’s bundle!’
or,
‘Look, you’ve trodden on my spray!’
or,
‘You’ve ruined my fan, clumsy!’
Zhou Rui’s wife walked up and down calling for some order:
‘Girls! Girls! You’re out in the street now, where people can see you. A little
behaviour, please!’
She had to do this several times before the clamour sub?sided somewhat.
The footmen and insignia-bearers at the front of the proces?sion had now reached
the temple, and as the files of their column opened out to range themselves on
either side of the gateway, the onlookers lining the sides of the street were able to
see Bao-yu on a splendidly caparisoned white horse riding at the head of the
procession immediately in front of his grandmother’s great palanquin with its eight
bearers. As Grandmother Jia and her party approached the temple, there was a crash
of drums and cymbals from the roadside. It was the Taoists of the temple come out
to welcome them, with old Abbot Zhang at their head, resplendent in cope and
vestments and with a burning joss-stick in his hand.
The palanquin passed through the gateway and into the first courtyard. From her
seat inside it Grandmother Jia could see the terrifying painted images of the temple
guardians, one on each side of the inner gate, flanked by that equally ferocious pair,
Thousand League Eye with his blue face and Favourable Wind Ear with his green one,
and farther on, the benigner forms of the City God and the little Local Gods. She
ordered the bearers to halt, and Cousin Zhen at the head of the younger male
members of the clan came forward from the inner court?yard to meet her.
Xi-feng, whose palanquin was nearest to Grandmother Jia’s, realized that Faithful and
the other maids were too far back in the procession to be able to reach the old lady
in time to help her out, and hurried forward to perform this service herself.
Unfortunately a little eleven- or twelve-year-old acolyte, who had been going round
with a pair of snuffers trimming the wicks of the numerous candles that were burning
everywhere and whom the arrival of the procession had caught unawares, chose this
very moment to attempt a getaway and ran head-on into her. Out flew Xi-feng’s hand
and dealt him a resounding smack on the face that sent him flying.
‘Clumsy brat!’ she shouted. ‘Look where you’re going!’
The little acolyte picked himself up and, leaving his snuffers where they had fallen,
darted off in the direction of the gate. But by now Bao-chai and the other young
ladies were getting down from their carriages and a phalanx of women-servants
clustered all round them, making egress impossible. Seeing a little Taoist running
towards them, the women began to scream and shout:
‘Catch him! Catch him! Hit him! Hit him!’
‘What is it?’ asked Grandmother Jia in alarm, hearing this hubbub behind her, and
Cousin Zhen went forward to inves?tigate.
‘It’s one of the young acolytes,’ said Xi-feng as she helped the old lady from her
conveyance. ‘He was snuffing the candles and didn’t get away in time and now he’s
rushing around trying to find a way out.’
‘Bring him to me, poor little thing!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And don’t frighten him.
These children from poorer families have generally been rather spoiled. You can’t
expect them to stand up to great occasions like this. It would be a shame to frighten
the poor little thing out of his wits. Think how upset his mother and father would be.
Go on!’ she said to Cousin Zhen. ‘Go and fetch him yourself.’
Cousin Zhen was obliged to retrieve the little Taoist in per?son and led him by the
hand to Grandmother Jia. The boy knelt down in front of her, the snuffers — now
restored to him – clutched in one hand, trembling like a leaf. Grandmother Jia asked
Cousin Zhen to raise him to his feet.
‘Don’t be afraid,’ she told the boy. ‘How old are you?’
But the little boy’s mouth was hurting him too badly to speak.
‘Poor little thing!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You’d better take him away, Zhen. Give
him some money to buy sweeties with and tell the others that they are not to
grumble at him.’
Cousin Zhen had to promise, and led the boy away, while the old lady led her party
inside to begin a systematic tour of the shrines.
The pages in the outer courtyard, who had a moment before witnessed Grandmother
Jia and her train trooping through the gateway that led into the inner courtyard,
were surprised to see Cousin Zhen now emerging from it again with a little Taoist in
tow. They heard him say that the boy was to be taken out and given a few hundred
cash and that he was to be treated kindly. A few of them came forward and led the
child away in obedience to his instructions.
Still standing at the top of the steps to the inner gate, Cousin Zhen inquired what had
become of the stewards.
‘Steward! Steward!’ shouted the pages in unison, and al?most immediately Lin
Zhi-xiao came running out from heaven knows where, adjusting his hat with one
hand as he ran.
‘This is a big place,’ said Cousin Zhen when Lin Zhi-xiao was standing in front of him,
‘and we weren’t expecting so many here today. I want you to take all the people you
need and stay here in this courtyard with them. Those you don’t need here can wait
in the second courtyard. And pick some reliable boys to go on this gate and the two
posterns to pass word through to those outside if those inside need anything. Do you
understand? All the ladies are here today and I don’t want any outsiders to get in. Is
that understood?’
‘Yes sir!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘Sir!’
‘Well get on with it!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Where’s Rong got to?’
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Jia Rong came bounding out of the
bell-tower, buttoning his jacket as he ran.
‘Look at him!’ said Cousin Zhen irately. ‘Enjoying him-self in the cool while I am
roasting down here! Spit at him, someone.’
Long familiarity with Cousin Zhen’s temper had taught the boys that he would brook
no opposition when roused. One of them obediently stepped forward and spat in Jia
Rong’s face; then, as Cousin. Zhen continued to glare at him, he rebuked Jia Rong for
presuming to be cool while his father was still sweating outside in the sun. Jia Rong
was obliged to stand with his arms hanging submissively at his sides through?out this
public humiliation, not daring to utter a word.
The other members of Jia Rong’s generation who were present — Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia
Qin and the rest — were greatly alarmed by this outburst; indeed, even the clansmen
of Cousin Zhen’s own generation — the Jia Bins and Jia Huangs and Jia Qiongs —
were to be seen putting their hats on and slinking out, one by one, from the shadow
of the walls.
‘What are you standing here for?’ said Cousin Zhen to Jia Rong. ‘Why don’t you get
on your horse and go back home and tell your mother and that new wife of yours
that Her Old Ladyship is here with all the Rong-guo girls. Tell them they must come
here at once to wait on her.’
Jia Rong ran outside and began bawling impatiently for his horse. ‘What on earth can
have got into him that he should suddenly have picked on me like that?’ he muttered
to him?self resentfully; then, as his horse had still not arrived, he shouted angrily at
the grooms:
‘Come on, bring that horse, damn you! Are your hands tied or something?’
He would have liked to send a boy in his place, but was afraid that if he did, his father
would find out when he went back later to report; and so, when the horse arrived, he
mounted and rode off home.
Cousin Zhen was about to turn and go in again when he discovered old Abbot Zhang
at his elbow, smiling somewhat unnaturally.
‘Perhaps I don’t come in quite the same category as the others,’ said the old Taoist.
‘Perhaps I should be allowed in?side to wait on Her Old Ladyship. However. In this
inclement heat, and with so many young ladies about, I shouldn’t like to presume. I
will do whatever you say. I did just wonder whether Her Old Ladyship might ask for
me, or whether she might require a guide to take her round the shrines…How?ever.
Perhaps it would be best if I waited here.’
Cousin Zhen was aware that, though Abbot Zhang had started life a poor boy and
entered the Taoist church as ‘proxy novice of Grandmother Jia’s late husband, a
former Emperor had with his own Imperial lips conferred on him the title ‘Doctor
Mysticus’, and he now held the seals of the Board of Commissioners of the Taoist
Church, had been awarded the title ‘Doctor Serenissimus’ by the reigning sovereign,
and was addressed as ‘Holiness’ by princes, dukes and governors of provinces. He
was therefore not a man to be trifled with. Moreover he was constantly in and out of
the two mansions and on familiar terms with most of the Jia ladies. Cousin Zhen at
once became affable.
‘Oh, you’re one of the family, Papa Zhang, so let’s have no more of that kind of talk,
or I’ll take you by that old beard of yours and give it a good pull. Come on, follow
me!’
Abbot Zhang followed him inside, laughing delightedly.
Having found Grandmother Jia, Cousin Zhen ducked and smiled deferentially.
‘Papa Zhang has come to pay his respects, Grannie.’
‘Help him, then!’ said Grandmother Jia; and Cousin Zhen hurried back to where
Abbot Zhang was waiting a few yards behind him and supported him by an elbow
into her presence. The abbot prefaced his greeting with a good deal of jovial laughter.
‘Blessed Buddha of Boundless Life! And how has Your Old Ladyship been all this
while? In rude good health, I trust? And Their Ladyships, and all the younger ladies?
— also flourishing? It’s quite a while since I was at the mansion to call on Your Old
Ladyship, but I declare you look more blooming than ever!’
‘And how are you, old Holy One?’ Grandmother Jia asked him with a pleased smile.
‘Thank Your Old Ladyship for asking. I still keep pretty fit. But never mind about
that. What I want to know is, how’s our young hero been keeping, eh? We were
celebrating the blessed Nativity of the Veiled King here on the twenty-sixth. Very
select little gathering. Tasteful offerings. I thought our young friend might have
enjoyed it; but when I sent round to invite him, they told me he was out.’
‘He really was out,’ said Grandmother Jia, and turned aside to summon the ‘young
hero’; but Bao-yu had gone to the lavatory. He came hurrying forward presently.
‘Hallo, Papa Zhang! How are you?’
The old Taoist embraced him affectionately and returned his greeting.
‘He’s beginning to fill out,’ he said, addressing Grand?mother Jia.
‘He looks well enough on the outside,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘but underneath he’s
delicate. And his Pa doesn’t improve matters by forcing him to study all the time. I’m
afraid he’ll end up by making the child ill.’
‘Lately I’ve been seeing calligraphy and poems of his in all kinds of places,’ said
Abbot Zhang, ‘— all quite remarkably good. I really can’t understand why Sir Zheng is
concerned that the boy doesn’t study enough. If you ask me, I think he’s all right as
he is.’ He sighed. ‘Of course, you know who this young man reminds me of, don’t you?
Whether it’s his looks or the way he talks or the way he moves, to me he’s the spit
and image of Old Sir Jia.’
The old man’s eyes grew moist, and Grandmother Jia her?self showed a disposition
to be tearful.
‘It’s quite true,’ she said. ‘None of our children or our children’s children turned out
like him, except my Bao. Only my little Jade Boy is like his grandfather.’
‘Of course, your generation wouldn’t remember Old Sir Jia,’ Abbot Zhang said,
turning to Cousin Zhen. ‘It’s before your time. In fact, I don’t suppose even Sir She
and Sir Zheng can have a very clear recollection of what their father was like in his
prime.’
He brightened as another topic occurred to him and once more quaked with laughter.
‘I saw a most attractive young lady when I was out visiting the other day. Fourteen
this year. Seeing her put me in mind of our young friend here. It must be about time
we started thinking about a match for him, surely? In looks, intelligence, breeding,
background this girl was ideally suited. What does Your Old Ladyship feel? I didn’t
want to rush matters. I thought I’d better first wait and see what Your Old Ladyship
thought before saying anything to the family.’
‘A monk who once told the boy’s fortune said that he was not to marry young,’ said
Grandmother Jia; ‘so I think we had better wait until he is a little older before we
arrange any?thing definite. But do by all means go on inquiring for us. It doesn’t
matter whether the family is wealthy or not; as long as the girl looks all right, you can
let me know. Even if it’s a poor family, we can always help out over the expenses.
Money is no problem. It’s looks and character that count.’
‘Now come on, Papa Zhang!’ said Xi-feng when this exchange had ended. Where’s
that new amulet for my little girl? You had the nerve to send someone round the
other day for gosling satin, and of course, as we didn’t want to embar?rass the old
man by refusing, we had to send you some. So now what about that amulet?’
Abbot Zhang once more quaked with laughter.
‘Ho! ho! ho! You can tell how bad my eyes are getting; I didn’t even see you there,
dear lady, or I should have thanked you for the satin. Yes, the amulet has been ready
for some time. I was going to send it to you two days ago, but then Her Grace
unexpectedly asked us for this Pro Viventibus and I stupidly forgot all about it. It’s
still on the high altar being sanctified. I’ll go and get it for you.’
He went off, surprisingly nimbly, to the main hall of the temple and returned after a
short while carrying the amulet on a little tea-tray, using a red satin book-wrap as a
tray-cloth. Baby’s nurse took the amulet from him, and he was just about to receive
the little girl from her arms when he caught sight of Xi-feng laughing at him
mockingly.
‘Why didn’t you bring it in your hand?’ she asked him.
‘The hands get so sweaty in this weather,’ he said. ‘I thought a tray would be more
hygienic.’
‘You gave me quite a fright when I saw you coming in with that tray,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I
thought for one moment you were going to take up a collection!’
There was a loud burst of laughter from the assembled company. Even Cousin Zhen
was unable to restrain himself.
‘Monkey! Monkey!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Aren’t you afraid of going to the Hell of
Scoffers when you die and hav?ing your tongue cut out?’
‘Oh, Papa and I say what we like to each other,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He’s always telling me
I must “acquire merit” and threatening me with a short life if I don’t pay up quickly.
That’s right, isn’t it Papa?’
‘As a matter of fact I did have an ulterior motive in bringing this tray,’ said Abbot
Zhang, laughing, ‘but it wasn’t in order to make a collection, I assure you. I wanted to
ask this young gentleman here if he would be so very kind as to lend me the famous
jade for a few minutes. The tray is for carrying it out?side on, so that my Taoist
friends, some of whom have travelled long distances to be here, and my old students,
and their students, all of whom are gathered here today, may have the privilege of
examining it.’
‘My dear good man, in that case let the boy go with it round his neck and show it to
them himself!’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘No need for all this running to and fro with
trays — at your age, too!’
‘Most kind! Most considerate! — But Your Old Ladyship is deceived,’ said the abbot.
‘I may look my eighty years, but I’m still hale and hearty. No, the point is that with so
many of them here today and the weather so hot, the smell is sure to be somewhat
overpowering. Our young friend here is cer?tainly not used to it. We shouldn’t want
him to be overcome by the – ah - effluvia, should we?’
Hearing this, Grandmother Jia told Bao-yu to take off the Magic Jade and put it on
the tray. Abbot Zhang draped the crimson cloth over his hands, grasped the tray
between satin-covered thumbs and fingers, and, holding it like a sacred relic at eye
level in front of him, conveyed it reverently from the courtyard.
Grandmother Jia and the others now continued their sight?seeing. They had finished
with everything at ground level and were about to mount the stairs into the galleries
when Cousin Zhen came up to report that Abbot Zhang had re?turned with the jade.
He was followed by the smiling figure of the abbot, holding the tray in the same
reverential manner as before.
‘Well, they’ve all seen the jade now,’ he said, ‘— and very grateful they were. They
agreed that it really is a most remark?able object, and they regretted that they had
nothing of value to show their appreciation with. Here you are! — this is the best
they could do. These are all little Taoist trinkets they happened to have about them.
Nothing very special, I’m afraid; but they’d like our young friend to keep them, either
to amuse himself with or to give away to his friends.’
Grandmother Jia looked at the tray. It was covered with jewellery. There were golden
crescents, jade thumb-rings and a lot of ‘motto’ jewellery — a tiny sceptre and
persimmons with the rebus-meaning ‘success in all things’, a little quail and a vase
with corn-stalks meaning ‘peace throughout the years’, and many other designs — all
in gold — or jade — work, and much of it inlaid with pearls and precious stones.
Altogether there must have been about forty pieces.
‘What have you been up to, you naughty old man?’ she said. ‘Those men are all
poor priests - they can’t afford to give things like this away. You really shouldn’t have
done this. We can’t possibly accept them.’
‘It was their own idea, I do assure you,’ said the abbot. ‘There was nothing I could
do to stop them. If you refuse to take these things, I am afraid you will destroy my
credit with these people. They will say that I cannot really have the connection with
your honoured family that I have always claimed to have.’
After this Grandmother Jia could no longer decline. She told one of the servants to
receive the tray.
‘We obviously can’t refuse, Grannie, after what Papa Zhang has just said,’ said
Bao-yu; ‘but I really have no use for this stuff. Why not let one of the boys carry it
outside for me and I’ll distribute it to the poor?’
‘I think that’s a very good idea,’ said Grandmother Jia.
But Abbot Zhang thought otherwise and hastily inter?vened:
‘I’m sure it does our young friend credit, this charitable impulse. However.
Although these things are, as I said, of no especial value, they are — what shall I say
— objects of virtù, and if you give them to the poor, in the first place the poor won’t
have much use for them, and in the second place the objects themselves will get
spoiled. If you want to give something to the poor, a largesse of money would, I
suggest, be far more appropriate.’
‘Very well, look after this stuff for me, then,’ said Bao-yu to the servant, ‘and this
evening you will distribute a largesse.’
This being now settled, Abbot Zhang withdrew, and Grandmother Jia and her party
went up to the galleries. Grandmother Jia sat with Bao-yu and the girls in the gallery
facing the stage and Xi-feng and Li Wan sat in the east gallery. The maids all sat in the
west gallery and took it in turns to go off and wait on their mistresses.
Not long after they were all seated, Cousin Zhen came up?stairs to say that the gods
had now chosen which plays were to be performed — by which was meant, of course,
that the names had been shaken from a pot in front of the altar, since this was the
only way in which the will of the gods could be known. The first play selected was
The White Serpent.
‘What’s the story?’ said Grandmother Jia.
Cousin Zhen explained that it was about the emperor Gao-?zu, founder of the Han
dynasty, who began his rise to great?ness by decapitating a monstrous white snake.
The second choice was A Heap of Honours, which shows the sixtieth birthday party
of the great Tang general Guo Zi-yi, attended by his seven sons and eight sons-in-law,
all of whom held high office, the ‘heap of honours’ of the title being a reference to
the table in his reception-hall piled high with their insignia.
‘It seems a bit conceited to have this second one played,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Still, if that’s what the gods chose, I suppose we’d better have it. What’s the third
one going to be?’
‘The South Branch,’ said Cousin Zhen.
Grandmother Jia was silent. She knew that The South Branch likens the world to an
ant-heap and tells a tale of power and glory which turns out in the end to have been
a dream.
Hearing no reply, Cousin Zhen went off downstairs again to see about the Offertory
Scroll, which had to be ceremonially burnt in front of the holy images along with
paper money and paper ingots before the theatrical performance could begin.
Our record omits any description of that ceremony and moves back to Bao-yu, who
was sitting in the central gallery beside his grandmother, and who now called for a
maid to bring the tray up so that he could put on his Magic Jade again. When he had
done so, he began to pick over the other trinkets with which the tray was covered
and to hand them one by one to Grandmother Jia for her inspection. Her atten?tion
was taken by a little red-gold kylin with kingfisher-feather inlay. She stretched out her
hand to take it.
‘Now where have I seen something like this before?’ she said. ‘I feel certain I’ve
seen some girl wearing an ornament like this.’
‘Cousin Shi’s got one,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s the same as this one only a little smaller.’
‘Funny!’ said Bao-yu. ‘All the times she’s been to our house, I don’t remember ever
having seen it.’
‘Cousin Ban is observant,’ said Tan-chun. ‘No matter what it is, she remembers
everything.’
‘Well, perhaps not quite everything,’ said Dai-yu wryly. ‘But she’s certainly very
observant where things like this are con?cerned.’
Bao-chai turned her head away and pretended not to have heard.
Now that he knew the kylin on the tray was like one that Shi Xiang-yun wore, Bao-yu
hurriedly picked it up and thrust it inside his jacket. But no sooner had he done so
than it occurred to him that his action might be misconstrued; so instead of dropping
it into his inside pocket, he continued to hold it there, at the same time glancing
about him furtively to see if he had been observed. None of the others seemed to
have noticed except Dai-yu, who was staring at him fixedly and nodding her head in
mock approval.
Bao-yu felt suddenly embarrassed. Drawing his hand out again with the ornament
still in it, he returned her look and laughed sheepishly:
‘It’s rather nice, isn’t it? I thought I’d keep it for you,’ he said. ‘When we get home
we can thread it on a ribbon and you’ll be able to wear it.’
Dai-yu tossed her head.
‘I don’t want it!’
‘If you don’t want it, I’ll keep it for myself, then,’ said Bao?-yu, and popped it once
more inside his jacket.
He was about to add something, but just at that moment Cousin Zhen’s wife, You-shi,
and his new daughter-in-law, Hu-shi, arrived and came upstairs to pay their respects
to Grandmother Jia.
‘ Now why have you come here? You really shouldn’t have bothered,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘We only came to amuse ourselves. It isn’t a formal visit.’
No sooner had she said this than it was announced that representatives from General
Feng’s household had arrived. It appeared that Feng Zi-ying’s mother, hearing that
the Jia ladies were having a Pro Viventibus performed at the Taoist temple, had
immediately prepared an offering of pork, mutton, incense, tea and cakes and sent it
post-haste to the temple with her compliments. Xi-feng, hearing the announcement,
came hurrying round to the central gallery. She clapped her hands and laughed.
‘Dear oh dear! This is something I hadn’t bargained for. My idea was a quiet little
outing for us girls; but here is everyone sending offerings and behaving as if we’d
come here for a high mass or something. It’s all your fault, Grannie! And we haven’t
even got any vails ready to give to the beaters.’
Even as she said this, two stewardesses from the Feng house?hold were already
mounting the stairs. And before ‘hey had gone, other messengers arrived with
offerings from Vice-president Zhao’s lady. From then on it was a steady stream:
friends, kinsmen, family connections, business associates - all who had heard that the
Jia ladies were holding a Pro Viven?tibus sent their representatives along with
offerings and com?plimentary messages. Grandmother Jia began to regret that she
had ever come.
‘It isn’t as if we’d come here for the ceremony,’ she grumb?led. ‘We only wanted to
enjoy ourselves. But all we seem to have done is to have stirred up a lot of fuss.’
Consequently, although she stayed and watched the plays for that day, she returned
home fairly early in the afternoon and next day professed herself too lacking in
energy to go again. Xi-feng reacted differently. ‘In for a penny, in for a pound’ was her
motto. They had already had the fuss; and since the players were there anyway, they
might as well go again today and enjoy themselves in peace.
For Bao-yu the whole of the previous day had been spoilt by Abbot Zhang’s proposal
to Grandmother Jia to arrange a match for him. He came home in a thoroughly bad
temper and kept telling everyone that he would ‘never see Abbot Zhang again as
long as he lived’. Not associating his ill-humour with the abbot’s proposal, the others
were mystified.
Grandmother Jia’s unwillingness was further reinforced by the fact that Dai-yu, since
her return home yesterday, had been suffering from mild sunstroke. What with one
thing and another, the old lady declined absolutely to go again, and Xi-?feng had to
make up her own party and go by herself.
But Xi-feng’s play-going does not concern us.

*
Bao-yu, believing that Dai-yu’s sunstroke was serious and that she might even be in
danger of her life, was so worried that he could not eat, and rushed round in the
middle of the lunch-hour to see how she was. He found her neither as ill as he had
feared nor as responsive as he might have hoped.
‘Why don’t you go and watch your plays?’ she asked him. ‘What are you mooning
about at home for?’
Abbot Zhang’s recent attempt at match-making had profoundly distressed Bao-yu
and he was shocked by her seeming indifference.
‘I can forgive the others for not understanding what has upset me,’ he thought; ‘but
that she should want to trifle with me at a time like this…!’
The sense that she had failed him made the annoyance he now felt with her a
hundred times greater than it had been on any previous occasion. Never could any
other person have stirred him to such depths of atrabilious rage. Coming from other
lips, her words would scarcely have touched him. Com?ing from hers, they put him in
a passion. His face darkened.
‘It’s all along been a mistake, then,’ he said. ‘You’re not what I took you for.’
Dai-yu gave an unnatural little laugh.
‘Not what you took me for? That’s hardly surprising, is it? I haven’t got that little
something which would have made me worthy of you.’
Bao-yu came tight up to her and held his face close to hers:
‘You do realize, don’t you, that you are deliberately willing my death?’
Dai-yu could not for the moment understand what he was talking about.
‘I swore an oath to you yesterday,’ he went on. ‘I said that I hoped Heaven might
strike me dead if this “gold and jade” business meant anything to me. Since you have
now brought it up again, it’s clear to me that you want me to die. Though what you
hope to gain by my death I find it hard to imagine.’
Dai-yu now remembered what had passed between them on the previous day. She
knew that she was wrong to have spoken as she did, and felt both ashamed and a
little frightened. Her shoulders started shaking and she began to cry.
‘May Heaven strike me dead if I ever willed your death!’ she said. ‘But I don’t see
what you have to get so worked up about. It’s only because of what Abbot Zhang said
about arranging a match for you. You’re afraid he might interfere with your precious
“gold and jade” plans; and because you’re angry about that, you have to come along
and take it out on me — That’s all it is, isn’t it?’
Bao-yu had from early childhood manifested a streak of morbid sensibility, which
being brought up in close proximity with a nature so closely in harmony with his own
had done little to improve. Now that he had reached an age when both his
experience and the reading of forbidden books had taught him something about
‘worldly matters’, he had begun to take a rather more grown-up interest in girls. But
although there were plenty of young ladies of outstanding beauty and breed?ing
among the Jia family’s numerous acquaintance, none of them, in his view, could
remotely compare with Dai-yu. For some time now his feeling for her had been a
very special one; but precisely because of this same morbid sensibility, he had shrunk
from telling her about it. Instead, whenever he was feeling particularly happy or
particularly cross, he would in?vent all sorts of ways of probing her to find out if this
feeling for her was reciprocated. It was unfortunate for him that Dai-yu herself
possessed a similar streak of morbid sensibility and disguised her real feelings, as he
did his, while attempting to discover what he felt about her.
Here was a situation, then, in which both parties concealed their real emotions and
assumed counterfeit ones in an en?deavour to find out what the real feelings of the
other party were. And because when false meets false the truth will oft-times out,
there was the constant possibility that the innumerable little frustrations that were
engendered by all this concealment would eventually erupt into a quarrel.
Take the present instance. What Bao-yu was actually think?ing at this moment was
something like this:
‘In my eyes and in my thoughts there is no one else but you. I can forgive the others
for not knowing this, but surely you ought to realize? If at a time like this you can’t
share my anxiety — if you can think of nothing better to do than provoke me with
that sort of silly talk, it shows that the concern I feel for you every waking minute of
the day is wasted: that you just don’t care about me at all.’
This was what he thought; but of course be didn’t say it. On her side Dai-yu’s
thoughts were somewhat as follows:
‘I know you must care for me a little bit, and I’m sure you don’t take this ridiculous
“gold and jade” talk seriously. But if you cared only for me and had absolutely no
inclination at all in another direction, then every time I mentioned “gold and jade”
you would behave quite naturally and let it pass almost as if you hadn’t noticed. How
is it, then, that when I do refer to it you get so excited? It shows that it must be on
your mind. You pretend to be upset in order to allay my suspicions.’
Meanwhile a quite different thought was running through Bao-yu’s mind.
‘I would do anything — absolutely anything,’ he was think?ing, ‘if only you would
be nice to me. If you would be nice to me, I would gladly die for you this moment. It
doesn’t really matter whether you know what I feel for you or not. Just be nice to me,
then at least we shall be a little closer to each other, instead of so horribly far apart.’
At the same time Dai-yu was thinking:
‘Never mind me. Just be your own natural self. If yon were all right, I should be all
right too. All these manoeuvrings to try and anticipate my feelings don’t bring us any
closer to?gether; they merely draw us farther apart.’
The percipient reader will no doubt observe that these two young people were
already of one mind, but that the com?plicated procedures by which they sought to
draw together were in fact having precisely the opposite effect. Complacent reader!
Permit us to remind you that your correct under?standing of the situation is due
solely to the fact that we have been revealing to you the secret, innermost thoughts
of those two young persons, which neither of them had so far ever felt able to
express.
Let us now return from the contemplation of inner thoughts to the recording of
outward appearances.
When Dai-yu, far from saying something nice to him, once more made reference to
the ‘gold and jade’, Bao-yu became so choked with rage that for a moment he was
quite literally bereft of speech. Frenziedly snatching the ‘Magic Jade’ from his neck
and holding it by the end of its silken cord he gritted his teeth and dashed it against
the floor with all the strength in his body.
‘Beastly thing!’ he shouted. ‘I’ll smash you to pieces and put an end to this once
and for all.’
But the jade, being exceptionally hard and resistant, was not the tiniest bit damaged.
Seeing that he had not broken it, Bao-yu began to look around for something to
smash it with. Dai-yu, still crying, saw what he was going to do.
‘Why smash a dumb, lifeless object?’ she said. ‘If you want to smash something, let
it be me.’
The sound of their quarrelling brought Nightingale and Snowgoose hurrying in to
keep the peace. They found Bao-yu apparently bent on destroying his jade and tried
to wrest it from him. Failing to do so, and sensing that the quarrel was of more than
usual dimensions, they went off to fetch Aroma. Aroma came back with them as fast
as she could run and eventually succeeded in prising the jade from his hand. He
glared at her scornfully.
‘It’s my own thing I’m smashing,’ he said. ‘What business is it of yours to interfere?’
Aroma saw that his face was white with anger and his eyes wild and dangerous.
Never had she seen him in so terrible a rage. She took him gently by the hand:
‘You shouldn’t smash the jade just because of a disagree?ment with your cousin,’
she said. ‘What do you think she would feel like and what sort of position would it
put her in if you really were to break it?’
Dai-yu heard these words through her sobs. They struck a responsive chord in her
breast, and she wept all the harder to think that even Aroma seemed to understand
her better than Bao-yu did. So much emotion was too much for her weak stomach.
Suddenly there was a horrible retching noise and up came the tisane of elsholtzia
leaves she had taken only a short while before. Nightingale quickly held out her
handkerchief to receive it and, while Snowgoose rubbed and pounded her back,
Dai-yu continued to retch up wave upon wave of watery vomit, until the whole
handkerchief was soaked with it.
‘However cross you may be, Miss, you ought to have more regard for your health,’
said Nightingale. ‘You’d only just taken that medicine and you were beginning to feel
a little bit better for it, and now because of your argument with Master Bao you’ve
gone and brought it all up again. Suppose you were to be really ill as a consequence.
How do you think Master Bao would feel?’
When Bao-yu heard these words they struck a responsive chord in his breast, and he
reflected bitterly that even Nightin?gale seemed to understand him better than
Dai-yu But then he looked again at Dai-yu, who was sobbing and panting by turns,
and whose red and swollen face was wet with perspira?tion and tears, and seeing
how pitiably frail and ill she looked, his heart misgave him.
‘I shouldn’t have taken her up on that “gold and jade” business,’ he thought. ‘I’ve
got her into this state and now there’s no way in which I can relieve her by sharing
what she suffers.’ As he thought this, he, too, began to cry.
Now that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were both crying, Aroma instinctively drew towards her
master to comfort him. A pang of pity for him passed through her and she squeezed
his hand sympathetically. It was as cold as ice. She would have liked to tell him not to
cry but hesitated, partly from the consideration that he might be suffering from some
deep-concealed hurt which crying would do something to relieve, and partly from
the fear that to do so in Dai-yu’s presence might seem pre?sumptuous. Torn between
a desire to speak and fear of the possible consequences of speaking, she did what
girls of her type often do when faced with a difficult decision: she avoided the
necessity of making one by bursting into tears.
As for Nightingale, who had disposed of the handkerchief of vomited tisane and was
now gently fanning her mistress with her fan, seeing the other three all standing
there as quiet as mice with the tears streaming down their faces, she was so
affected by the sight that she too started crying and was obliged to have recourse to
a second handkerchief.
There the four of them stood, then, facing each other; all of them crying; none of
them saying a word. It was Aroma who broke the silence with a strained and nervous
laugh.
‘You ought not to quarrel with Miss Lin,’ she said to Bao-yu, ‘if only for the sake of
this pretty cord she made you.’
At these words Dai-yu, ill as she was, darted forward, grabbed the jade from Aroma’s
hand, and snatching up a pair of scissors that were lying nearby, began feverishly
cutting at its silken cord with them. Before Aroma and Nightingale could stop her, she
had already cut it into several pieces.
‘It was a waste of time making it,’ she sobbed. ‘He doesn’t really care for it. And
there’s someone else who’ll no doubt make him a better one!’
‘What a shame!’ said Aroma, retrieving the jade. ‘It’s all my silly fault. I should have
kept my mouth shut.’
‘Go on! Cut away!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shan’t be wearing the wretched thing again
anyway, so it doesn’t matter.’
Preoccupied with the quarrel, the four of them had failed to notice several old
women, who had been drawn by the sound of it to investigate. Apprehensive, when
they saw Dai?-yu hysterically weeping and vomiting and Bao-yu trying to smash his
jade, of the dire consequences to be expected from a scene of such desperate
passion, they had hurried off in a body to the front of the mansion to report the
matter to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, hoping in this way to establish in advance
that whatever the consequences might be, they were not responsible for them. From
their precipitate entry and the grave tone of their announcement Grandmother Jia
and Lady Wang assumed that some major catastrophe had befallen and hurried with
them into the Garden to find out what it was.
Their arrival filled Aroma with alarm. ‘What did Nightin?gale want to go troubling
Their Ladyships for?’ she thought crossly, supposing that the talebearer had been
sent to them by Nightingale; while Nightingale for her part was angry with Aroma,
thinking that the talebearer must have been one of Aroma’s minions.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang entered the room to find a silent Bao-yu and a silent
Dai-yu, neither of whom, when questioned, would admit that anything at all was the
matter. They therefore visited their wrath on the beads of the two unfortunate maids,
insisting that it was entirely owing to their negligence that matters had got so much
out of hand. Unable to defend themselves, the girls were obliged to endure a long
and abusive dressing-down, after which Grandmother Jia concluded the affair by
carrying Bao-yu off to her own apart?ment.
Next day, the third of the fifth month, was Xue Pan’s birthday and there was a family
party with plays, to which the Jias were all invited. Bao-yu, who had still not seen
Dai-yu since his outburst — which he now deeply regretted — was feeling far too
dispirited to care about seeing plays, and declined to go on the ground that he was
feeling unwell.
Dai-yu, though somewhat overcome on the day previous to this by the sultry weather,
had by no means been seriously ill. Arguing that if she was not ill, it was impossible
that he should be, she felt sure, when she heard of Bao-yu’s excuse, that it must be a
false one.
‘He usually enjoys drinking and watching plays,’ she thought. ‘If he’s not going, it
must be because he is still angry about yesterday; or if it isn’t that, it must be
because he’s heard that I’m not going and doesn’t want to go without me. Oh! I
should never have cut that cord! Now he won’t ever wear his jade again - unless I
make him another cord to wear it on.’
So she, too, regretted the quarrel.
Grandmother Jia knew that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were angry with each other, but she
had been assuming that they would see each other at the Xues’ party and make it up
there. When neither of them turned up at it, she became seriously upset.
‘I’m a miserable old sinner,’ she grumbled. It must be my punishment for something
I did wrong in a past life to have to live with a pair of such obstinate, addle-headed
little geese! I’m sure there isn’t a day goes by without their giving me some fresh
cause for anxiety. It must he fate. That’s what it says in the proverb, after all:
                       ’Tis Fate brings foes and lo’es tegither.
I’ll be glad when I’ve drawn my last breath and closed my old eyes for the last time;
then the two of them can snap and snarl at each other to their hearts’ content, for I
shan’t be there to see it, and “what the eye doesn’t see, the heart doesn’t grieve”.
The Lord knows, it’s not my wish to drag on this wearisome life any longer!’
Amidst these muttered grumblings the old lady began to cry.
In due course her words were transmitted to Bao-yu and Dai-yu. It happened that
neither of them had ever heard the saying
                       ’Tis Fate brings foes and lo’es tegither,

and its impact on them, hearing it for the first time, was like that of a Zen
‘perception’ something to be meditated on with bowed head and savoured with a
gush of tears. Though they had still not made it up since their quarrel, the difference
between them had now vanished completely:
                In Naiad’s House one to the wind made moan,
                In Green Delights one to the moon complained,
to parody the well-known lines. Or, in homelier verses:

                 Though each was in a different place,
                 Their hearts in friendship beat as one.

On the second day after their quarrel Aroma deemed that the time was now ripe for
urging a settlement.
‘Whatever the rights and wrongs of all this may be,’ she said to Bao-yu, ‘you are
certainly the one who is most to blame. Whenever in the past you’ve heard about a
quarrel between one of the pages and one of the girls, you’ve always said that the
boy was a brute for not understanding the girl’s feelings better — yet here you are
behaving in exactly the same way yourself! Tomorrow will be the Double Fifth. Her
Old Ladyship will be really angry if the two of you are still at daggers drawn on the
day of the festival, and that will make life difficult for all of us. Why not put your
pride in your pocket and go and say you are sorry, so that we can all get back to
normal again?’
But as to whether or not Bao-yu followed her advice, or, if he did so, what the effect
of following it was - those ques?tions will be dealt with in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 30

Bao-chai speaks of a fan and castigates her deriders
Charmante scratches a ‘qiang’ and mystifies a beholder

Dai-yu, as we have shown, regretted her quarrel with Bao-yu almost as soon as it was
over; but since there were no con?ceivable grounds on which she could run after him
and tell him so, she continued, both day and night, in a state of un?relieved
depression that made her feel almost as if a part of her was lost. Nightingale had a
shrewd idea how it was with her and resolved at last to tackle her:
‘I think the day before yesterday you were too hasty, Miss. We ought to know what
things Master Bao is touchy about, if no one else does. Look at all the quarrels we’ve
had with him in the past on account of that jade!’
‘Poh!’ said Dai-yu scornfully. ‘You are trying to make out that it was my fault
because you have taken his side against me. Of course I wasn’t too hasty.’
Nightingale gave her a quizzical smile.
‘No? Then why did you cut that cord up? If three parts of the blame was Bao-yu’s,
I’m sure at least seven parts of it was yours. From what I’ve seen of it, he’s all right
with you when you allow him to be; it’s because you’re so prickly with him and
always trying to put him in the wrong that he gets worked up.’
Dai-yu was about to retort when they heard someone at the courtyard gate calling to
be let in. Nightingale turned to listen:
‘That’s Bao-yu’s voice,’ she said. ‘I expect he has come to apologize.’
‘I forbid you to let him in,’ said Dai-yu.
‘There you go again!’ said Nightingale. ‘You’re going to keep him standing outside in
the blazing sun on a day like this. Surely that’s wrong, if nothing else is?’
She was moving outside, even as she said this, regardless of her mistress’s injunction.
Sure enough, it was Bao-yu. She un?fastened the gate and welcomed him in with a
friendly smile.
‘Master Bao! I was beginning to think you weren’t coming to see us any more, I
certainly didn’t expect to see you here again so soon.’
‘Oh, you’ve been making a mountain out of a molehill,’ said Bao-yu, returning her
smile. ‘Why ever shouldn’t I come? Even if I died, my ghost would be round here a
hundred times a day. How is my cousin? Quite better now?’
‘Physically she’s better,’ said Nightingale, ‘but she’s still in very poor spirits.’
‘Ah yes — I know she’s upset.’
This exchange took place as they were crossing the fore?court. He now entered the
room. Dai-yu was sitting on the bed crying. She had not been crying to start with, but
the bittersweet pang she experienced when she heard his arrival had started the
tears rolling. Bao-yu went up to the bed and smiled down at her.
‘How are you, coz? Quite better now?’
As Dai-yu seemed to be too busy wiping her eyes to make a reply, he sat down close
beside her on the edge of the bed:
‘I know you’re not really angry with me,’ he said. ‘It’s just that if the others noticed I
wasn’t coming here, they would think we had been quarrelling; and if we waited for
them to interfere, we should be allowing other people to come be?tween us. It
would be better to hit me and shout at me now and get it over with, if you still bear
any hard feelings, than to go on ignoring me. Coz dear! Coz dear! -’
He must have repeated those same two words in the same tone of passionate
entreaty upwards of twenty times. Dai-yu had been meaning to ignore him, but what
he had just been saying about other people ‘coming between’ them seemed to prove
that he must in some way feel closer to her than the rest, and she was unable to
maintain her silence.
‘You don’t have to treat me like a child,’ she blurted out tearfully. ‘From now on I
shall make no further claims on you. You can behave exactly as if I had gone away.’
‘Gone away?’ said Bao-yu laughingly. ‘Where would you go to?’
‘Back home.’
‘I’d follow you.’
‘As if I were dead then.’
‘If you died,’ he said, ‘I should become a monk.’
Dai-yu’s face darkened immediately:
‘What an utterly idiotic thing to say! Suppose your own sisters were to die? Just
how many times can one person become a monk? I think I had better see what the
others think about that remark.’
Bao-yu had realized at once that she would be offended; but the words were already
out of his mouth before he could stop them. He turned very red and hung his head in
silence. It was a good thing that no one else was in the room at that moment to see
him. Dai-yu glared at him for some seconds - evidently too enraged to speak, for she
made a sound somewhere be?tween a snort and a sigh, but said nothing - then,
seeing him almost purple in the face with suppressed emotion, she clenched her
teeth, pointed her finger at him, and, with an indignant ‘Hmn!’, stabbed the air quite
savagely a few inches away from his forehead:
‘You—!’
But whatever it was she had been going to call him never got said. She merely gave a
sigh and began wiping her eyes again with her handkerchief.
Bao-yu had been in a highly emotional state when he came to see Dai-yu and it had
further upset him to have inadvertent?ly offended her so soon after his arrival. This
angry gesture and the unsuccessful struggle, ending in sighs and tears, to say what
she wanted to say now affected him so deeply that he, too, began to weep. In need
of a handkerchief but finding that he had come out without one, he wiped his eyes
on his sleeve.
Although Dai-yu was crying, the spectacle of Bao-yu using the sleeve of his
brand-new lilac-coloured summer gown as a handkerchief had not escaped her, and
while continuing to wipe her own eyes with one hand, she leaned over and reached
with the other for the square of silk that was draped over the head-rest at the end of
the bed. She lifted it off and threw it at him — all without uttering a word - then,
once more burying her face in her own handkerchief, resumed her weeping. Bao-?yu
picked up the handkerchief she had thrown him and hur?riedly wiped his eyes with it.
When he had dried them, he drew up close to her again and took one of her hands in
his own, smiling at her gently.
‘I don’t know why you go on crying,’ he said. ‘I feel as if all my insides were
shattered. Come! Let’s go and see Grandmother together.’
Dai-yu flung off his hand.
‘Take your hands off me! We’re not children any more. You really can’t go on
mauling me about like this all the time. Don’t you understand anything —?’
‘Bravo!’
The shouted interruption startled them both. They spun round to look just as Xi-feng,
full of smiles, came bustling into the room.
‘Grandmother has been grumbling away something awful,’ she said. ‘She insisted
that I should come over and see if you were both all right. “Oh,” I said, “there’s no
need to go and look, Grannie; they’ll have made it up by now without any
interference from us.” So she told me I was lazy. Well, here I am — and of course it’s
exactly as I said it would be. I don’t know. I don’t understand you two. What is it you
find to argue about? For every three days that you’re friends you must spend at least
two days quarrelling. You really are a couple of babies. And the older you get, the
worse you get. Look at you now — holding hands crying! And a couple of days ago
you were glaring at each other like fighting-cocks. Come on! Come with me to see
Grandmother. Let’s put the old lady’s mind at rest.’
As she said this, she seized Dai-yu’s hand and began march?ing off with her. Dai-yu
turned back and called for her maids, but there was no response.
‘What do you want to call them for?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’ve got me to wait on you,
haven’t you?’
She continued to walk away, still holding Dai-yu by the hand. Bao-yu followed a little
way behind. They went out of the Garden and through into Grandmother Jia’s
apartment.
‘I told you they could be left to themselves to make it up and that there was no
need for you to worry,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when they were all in the old
lady’s pre?sence; ‘but you wouldn’t believe me, would you? You insisted on my going
there to act the peacemaker. Well, I went there; and what did I find? I found the two
of them together apolo?gizing to each other. It was like the kite and the kestrel
holding hands: they were positively locked in a clinch! No need of a peacemaker that
I could see.’
There was a burst of laughter from all present. Bao-chai was among these, but Dai-yu
slipped past her without speaking and took a seat next to Grandmother Jia. Bao-yu,
rather at a loss for something to say, turned to Bao-chai.
‘I’m afraid I’ wasn’t very well on your brother’s birthday; so apart from not giving
him a present, I couldn’t even make him a kotow this year. I’m afraid he may not have
realized I was ill and thought that I was merely making excuses. If you can spare a
moment next time you see him, I do hope you will explain to him for me.’
Bao-chai looked amused.
‘That seems a trifle excessive. I am sure he would have felt uncomfortable about
your kotowing to him, even if you had been able to come; so I’m quite sure he
wouldn’t have wanted you to come when you weren’t feeling well. It would be rather
unfriendly, surely, if cousins who see each other all the time were to start worrying
about trifles like that?’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘Well, as long as yon understand, that’s all right. But why aren’t you watching the
players?’
‘I can’t stand the heat,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I did watch a couple of acts of something,
but it was so hot that I couldn’t stay any longer. Unfortunately none of the guests
showed any sign of going, so I had to pretend I was ill in order to get away.’
‘Touché!’ thought Bao-yu; but he hid his embarrassment in a stupid laugh.
‘No wonder they compare you to Yang Gui-fei, cousin. You are well-covered like her,
and they always say that plump people fear the heat.’
The colour flew into Bao-chai’s face. An angry retort was on her lips, but she could
hardly make it in front of company. Yet reflection only made her angrier. Eventually,
after a scorn?ful sniff or two, she said:
‘I may be like Yang Gui-fei in some respects, but I don’t think there is much danger
of my cousin becoming a Prime Minister.’
It happened that just at that moment a very young maid called ‘Prettikins’ jokingly
accused Bao-chai of having hid?den a fan she was looking for.
‘I know Miss Bao’s hidden it,’ she said, ‘Come on, Miss! Please let me have it.’
‘You be careful,’ said Bao-chai, pointing at the girl angrily and speaking with
unwonted stridency. ‘When did you last see me playing games of this sort with
anyone? If there are other young ladies who are in the habit of romping about with
you, you had better ask them.’
Prettikins fled.
Bao-yu realized that he had once again given offence by speaking thoughtlessly; and
as this time it was in front of a lot of people, his embarrassment was correspondingly
greater. He turned aside in confusion and began talking nervously to someone else.
Bao-yu’s rudeness to Bao-chai had given Dai-yu secret satisfaction. When Prettikins
came in looking for her fan, she had been on the point of adding some facetiousness
of her own at Bao-chai’s expense; but Bao-chai’s brief explosion caused her to drop
the prepared witticism and ask instead what play the two acts were from that
Bao-chai said she had just been watching.
Bao-chai had observed the smirk on Dai-yu’s face and knew very well that Bao-yu’s
rudeness must have pleased her. The smiling answer she gave to Dai-yu’s question
was therefore not without a touch of malice.
‘The play I saw was Li Kui Abuses Song Jiang and After?wards Has to Say He Is
Sorry.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘What a mouthful! Surely, with all your learning, cousin, you must know the proper
name of that play? It’s called The Abject Apology.’
‘The Abject Apology?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Well, no doubt you clever people know all
there is to know about abject apology. I’m afraid it’s something I wouldn’t know
about.’
Her words touched Bao-yu and Dai-yu on a sensitive spot, and by the time she had
finished, they were both blushing hotly with embarrassment.
Xi-feng was insufficiently educated to have understood all these nuances, but by
studying the speakers’ expressions she had formed a pretty good idea of what they
were talking about.
‘Rather hot weather to be eating raw ginger, isn’t it?’ she asked.
No one present could understand what she meant.
‘No one’s been eating raw ginger,’ they said.
Xi-feng affected great surprise and rubbed her cheek mean?ingfully with her hand:
‘If no one’s been eating raw ginger, then why are they look?ing so hot and
bothered?’
At this Bao-yu and Dai-yu felt even more uncomfortable. Bao-chai was about to add
something, but seeing the abject look on Bao-yu’s face, she laughed and held her
tongue. None of the others present had understood what the four of them were
talking about and treated these exchanges as a joke.
Shortly after this, when Bao-chai and Xi-feng had gone out of the room, Dai-yu said
to Bao-yu.
‘You see? There are people even more dangerous to trifle with than I. If I weren’t
such a tongue-tied, slow-witted creature, you wouldn’t get away with it quite so
often, my friend.’
Bao-yu was still smarting from Bao-chai’s testiness. To be set upon now by Dai-yu as
well seemed positively the last straw. But though he wanted to reply, he knew how
easily she would take offence and controlled himself with an effort. Feel?ing in very
low spirits, he left the room himself now and went off on his own.
It was the hottest part of the day. Lunch had long been over, and in every apartment
mistress and maids alike had succumbed to the lassitude of the hour. As he sauntered
slow?ly by, hands clasped behind his back, everywhere he went was hushed in the
breathless silence of noon. From the back of Grandmother Jia’s quartets he passed
eastwards through the gallery that ended near the wall of Xi-feng’s courtyard. He
went up to the gate, but it was closed, and remembering that it was her invariable
custom when the weather was hot to take two whole hours off in the middle of the
day for her siesta, he thought he had better not go in. He continued, instead, through
the corner gate that led into his parents’ courtyard.
On entering his mother’s apartment, he found several maids dozing over their
embroidery. Lady Wang herself was lying on a summer-bed in the inner room,
apparently fast asleep. Her maid Golden, who was sitting beside her gently pounding
her legs, also seemed half asleep, for her head was nodding and her half-closed eyes
were blinking drowsily. Bao-yu tiptoed up to her and tweaked an ear-ring. She
opened her eyes wide and saw that it was Bao-yu.
He smiled at her and whispered.
‘So sleepy?’
Golden pursed her lips up in a smile, motioned to him with her hand to go away, and
then closed her eyes again. But Bao-yu lingered, fascinated. Silently craning forward
to make sure that Lady Wang’s eyes were closed, he took a Fragrant Snow ‘quencher’
from the embroidered pouch at his waist and popped it between Golden’s lips.
Golden nibbled it dreamily without opening her eyes.
‘Shall I ask Her Ladyship to let me have you, so that we can be together?’ he
whispered jokingly.
Golden made no reply.
‘When she wakes up, I’ll talk to her about it,’ he said.
Golden opened her eyes wide and gave him a little push.
‘What’s the hurry?’ she said playfully. ‘“Yours is yours, wherever it be”, as they said
to the lady when she dropped her gold comb in the well. Haven’t you ever heard that
saying? — I’ll tell you something to do, if you want a bit of fun. Go into the little east
courtyard and you’ll be able to catch Sunset and Huan together.’
‘Who cares about them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let’s talk about us.’ At this point Lady Wang
sat bolt upright and dealt Golden a slap in the face.
‘Shameless little harlot!’ she cried, pointing at bet wrath-fully. ‘It’s you and your like
who corrupt our innocent young boys.’
Bao-yu had slipped silently away as soon as his mother sat up. Golden, one of whose
cheeks was now burning a fiery red, was left without a word to say. The other maids,
hearing that their mistress was awake, came hurrying into the room.
‘Silver!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Go and fetch your mother. I want her to take your sister
Golden away.’
Golden threw herself, weeping, upon her knees:
‘No, Your Ladyship, please! Beat me and revile me as much as you like, but please,
for pity’s sake, don’t send me away. I’ve been with Your Ladyship nigh on ten years
now. How can I ever hold up my head again if you dismiss me?’
Lady Wang was not naturally unkind. On the contrary, she was an exceptionally
lenient mistress. This was, in fact, the first time in her life that she had ever struck a
maid. But the kind of ‘shamelessness’ of which — in her view - Golden had just been
guilty was the one thing she had always most abhorred. It was the uncontrollable
anger of the morally out?raged that had caused her to strike Golden and call her
names; and though Golden now begged and pleaded, she refused to retract her
dismissal. When Golden’s mother, old Mrs Bai, had eventually been fetched, the
wretched girl, utterly crushed by her shame and humiliation, was led away.
But of her no more.

*
Embarrassed by his mother’s awakening, Bao-yu had slipped hurriedly into the
Garden.
The burning sun was now in the height of heaven, the con?tracted shadows were
concentrated darkly beneath the trees, and the stillness of noon, filled with the harsh
trilling of cicadas, was broken by no human voice; but as he approached the bamboo
trellises of the rose-garden, a sound like a suppressed sob seemed to come from
inside the pergola. Uncer?tain what it was that he had heard, he stopped to listen.
Undoubtedly there was someone there.
This was the fifth month of the year, when the rambler roses are in fullest bloom.
Peeping through the fragrant panicles with which the pergola was smothered, he saw
a girl crouching down on the other side of the trellis, scratching at the ground with
one of those long, blunt pins that girls use for fastening their back hair with.
‘Can this be some silly maid come here to bury flowers like Frowner?’ he
wondered.
He was reminded of Zhuang-zi’s story of the beautiful Xi-?shi’s ugly neighbour, whose
endeavours to imitate the little frown that made Xi-shi captivating produced an
aspect so hideous that people ran from her in terror. The recollection of it made him
smile.
‘This is “imitating the Frowner” with a vengeance,’ he thought, ‘- if that is really
what she is doing. Not merely un?original, but downright disgusting!”
‘Don’t imitate Miss Lin,’ he was about to shout; but a glimpse of the girl’s face
revealed to him just in time that this was no maid, but one of the twelve little
actresses from Pear?-tree Court – though which of them, since he had seen them
only in their make-up on the stage, he was unable to make out. He stuck out his
tongue in a grimace and clapped a hand to his mouth.
‘Good job I didn’t speak too soon,’ he thought. ‘I’ve been in trouble twice already
today for doing that, once with Frowner and once with Chai. It only needs me to go
and upset these twelve actresses as well and I shall be well and truly in the cart!’
His efforts to identify the girl made him study her more closely. It was curious that he
should have thought her an imitator of Dai-yu, for she had much of Dai-yu’s ethereal
grace in her looks: the same delicate face and frail, slender body; the same
... brows like hills in spring,
And eyes like autumn’s limpid pools;


— even the same little frown that had often made him compare Dai-yu with Xi-shi of
the legend.
It was now quite impossible for him to tear himself away. He watched her fascinated.
As he watched, he began to see that what she was doing with the pin was not
scratching a hole to bury flowers in, but writing. He followed the movements of her
hand, and each vertical and horizontal stroke, each dot and hook that she made he
copied with a finger on the palm of his hand. Altogether there were eighteen strokes.
He thought for a moment. The character he had just written in his hand was QIANG.
The name of the roses which covered the pergola contained the same character:
‘Qiang-wei’.
‘The sight of the roses has inspired her to write a poem,’ he thought. ‘Probably
she’s just thought of a good couplet and wants to write it down before she forgets it;
or perhaps she has already composed several lines and wants to work on them a bit.
Let’s see what she writes next.’
The girl went on writing, and he followed the movements of her hand as before. It
was another QIANG. Again she wrote, and again he followed, and again it was a
QIANG. It was as though she were under some sort of spell. As soon as she had
finished writing one QIANG she began writing another.

QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG…

He must have watched her write several dozen QIANG’s in succession. He seemed to
be as much affected by the spell on his side of the pergola as the girl herself was on
hers, for his eyeballs continued to follow her pin long after he bad learned to
anticipate its movements.
‘This girl must have something on her mind that she cannot tell anyone about to
make her behave in this way,’ he thought. ‘One can see from her outward behaviour
how much she must be suffering inwardly. And she looks so frail. Too frail for
suffering. I wish I could bear some of it for you, my dear!’
In the stifling dog-days of summer the transition from clear to overcast is often
sudden, and a little cloudlet can some?times be the harbinger of a heavy shower. As
Bao-yu watched the girl, a sudden gust of cool wind blew by, followed, within
moments, by the hissing downpour of rain. He could see the water running off her
head in streams and soaking into her clothes.
‘Oh, it’s raining! With her delicate constitution she ought not to be outside in a
downpour like this.’
In his anxiety he cried out to her involuntarily:
‘Don’t write any more. Look! You’re getting soaked.’
The girl looked up, startled, when she heard the voice. She could see someone
amidst the roses saying ‘Don’t write’; but partly because of Bao-yu’s almost girlishly
beautiful features, and partly because she could in any case only see about half of his
face, everything above and below being hidden by flowers and foliage, she took him
for a maid; so instead of rushing from his presence as she would have done if she had
known that it was Bao-yu, she smiled up at him gratefully:
‘Thank you for reminding me. But what about you? You must be getting wet too,
surely?’
‘Aiyo!’— her words made him suddenly aware that the whole of his body was icy
cold, and when he looked down, he saw that he was soaked.
‘Oh lord!’
He rushed off in the direction of Green Delights; but all the time he was worrying
about the girl, who had nowhere where she could shelter from the rain.

*

As this was the day before the Double Fifth festival, élégante and the other little
actresses — including the one whom Bao-yu had just been watching - had already
started their holiday and had gone into the Garden to amuse themselves. Two of
them, Trésor — one of the two members of the company who played Principal Boy
parts — and Topaze — one of the company’s two soubrettes — happened to be in
the House of Green Delights playing with Aroma when the rain started and prevented
their leaving. They and the maids amused themselves by blocking up the gutters and
letting the water collect in the courtyard. When it was nicely flooded, they rounded
up a number of mallards, sheldrakes, mandarin ducks and other waterfowl, tied their
wings together, and having first closed the courtyard gate, set them down in the
water to swim about. Aroma and the girls were all in the outside gallery enjoying this
spectacle when Bao-yu arrived at the gate. Finding it shut, he knocked on it for
someone to come and open up for him. But there was little chance of a knock being
heard above the excited laughter of the maids. He had to shout for some minutes
and pound the gate till it shook before anyone heard him inside.
Aroma was not expecting him back so soon.
‘I wonder who it can be at this time,’ she said. ‘Won’t someone go and answer it?’
‘It’s me!’ shouted Bao-yu.
‘That’s Miss Bao’s voice,’ said Musk.
‘Nonsense!’ said Skybright. ‘What would she be doing visiting us at this time of
day?’
‘Let me just take a peep through the crack,’ said Aroma. ‘If I think it’s all right, I’ll let
them in. We don’t want to turn anyone away in the pouring rain.’
Keeping under cover of the gallery, she made her way round to the gate and peered
through the chink between the double doors. The sight of Bao-yu standing there like
a bedraggled hen with the water running off him in streamlets was both alarming
and —she could not help but feel very funny. She opened the gate as quickly as she
could, then, when she saw him fully, clapped her hands and doubled up with
laughter.
‘Master Bao! I never thought it would be you. What did you want to come running
back in the pouring rain for?’
Bao-yu was by now in a thoroughly evil temper and had fully resolved to give
whoever opened the gate a few kicks. As soon as it was open, therefore, he lashed
out with his foot, not bothering to see who it was — for he assumed that the per?son
answering it would be one of the younger maids — and dealt Aroma a mighty kick in
the ribs that caused her to cry out in pain.
‘Worthless lot!’ he shouted. Because I always treat you decently, you think you can
get away with anything. I’m just your laughing-stock.’
It was not until he looked down and saw Aroma crying that he realized he had kicked
the wrong person.
‘Aiyo! It’s you! Where did I kick you?’
Up to this moment Aroma had never had so much as a harsh word from Bao-yu, and
the combination of shame, anger and pain she now felt on being kicked and shouted
at by him in front of so many people was well-nigh insupport?able. Nevertheless she
forced herself to bear it, reflecting that to have made an outcry would be like
admitting that it was her he had meant to kick, which she knew was almost certainly
not the case.
‘You didn’t; you missed me,’ she said. ‘Come in and get changed.’
When Bao-yu had gone indoors and was changing his clothes, he said to her jokingly:
‘In all these years this is the first time I’ve ever struck any?one in anger. Too bad
that yon should have been the one to get in the way of the blow!’
In spite of the pain, which it cost her some effort to master, Aroma was helping him
with his changing. She smiled when he said this.
‘I’m the person you always begin things with,’ she said. ‘Whether it’s big things or
little things or pleasant ones or unpleasant ones, it’s only natural that you should try
them out first on me. Only in this instance I hope that now you’ve hit me you won’t
from now on go around hitting other people.’
‘I didn’t mean to kick you, you know,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Who said you did?’ said Aroma. ‘It’s the younger ones who normally see to the
gate; and they’ve grown so insolent nowadays, it’s enough to put anyone in a rage. If
you’d given one of them a few kicks and put the fear of God into them, it would have
been a very good thing. No, it was my own silly fault. I should have made them open
the gate and not gone to open it myself.’
While they were speaking, the rain had stopped and Tresor and Topaze had left. The
pain in Aroma’s side was such that it was giving her a feeling of nausea and she could
eat no din?ner. At bedtime, when she took off her clothes, she saw a great black
bruise the size of a rice-bowl spreading over the side of her chest. The extent of it
frightened her, but she for?bore to cry out, Nevertheless even her dreams that night
were full of pain and she several times uttered an ‘Aiyo’ in the midst of her sleep.
Although it was understood that he had not kicked her deliberately, Bao-yu had felt a
little uneasy when he saw how sluggish Aroma seemed in her movements; and when,
during the night, he heard her groaning in her sleep, he knew that he must have
kicked her really hard. Getting out of bed, he picked up a lamp and tiptoed over to
have a look. Just as he reached the foot of her bed, he heard her cough a couple of
times and spit out a mouthful of something.
‘Aiyo!’
She opened her eyes wide and saw Bao-yu. Startled, she asked him what he was
doing there.
‘You’ve been groaning in your sleep,’ he said. ‘I must have hurt you badly. Let me
have a look.’
‘My head feels giddy,’ said Aroma, ‘and I’ve got a sweet, sickly taste in my throat.
Have a look on the floor.’
Bao-yu shone his lamp on the floor. Beside the bed, where she had spat, there was a
mouthful of bright red blood. He was horrified.
‘Oh, help!’
Aroma looked too, and felt the grip of fear on her heart.
The outcome will be told in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 31

A torn fan is the price of silver laughter
And a lost kylin is the clue to a happy marriage

A cold feat came over Aroma when she saw the fresh blood on the floor. She had
often heard people say that if you spat blood when you were young, you would die
early, or at the very least be an invalid all your life; and remembering this now, she
felt all her bright, ambitious hopes for the future turn into dust and ashes. Tears of
misery ran down her cheeks. The sight of them made Bao-yu, too, distressed.
‘What is it?’ he asked her.
‘It’s nothing.’ She forced herself to smile. ‘I’m all right.’
Bao-yu was all for calling one of the maids and getting her to heat some rice wine, so
that Aroma could be given hot wine and Hainan kid’s-blood pills; but Aroma, smiling
through her tears, caught at his hand to restrain him.
‘It’s all right for you to make a fuss,’ she said; ‘but if you go involving the others,
they are sure to accuse me of putting on airs. And besides, it will do neither of us any
good to draw attention to ourselves — especially when so far no one seems to have
noticed anything. The sensible thing would be for you to send one of the boys round
tomorrow to Dr Wang’s and get me some medicine to take. I shall probably be all
right again after a few doses, without a single soul knowing anything about it. Surely
that’s best, isn’t it?’
Bao-yu knew that she was right and abandoned his inten?tion of rousing the others.
Instead he poured her a cup of tea from a pot on the table and gave it to her to rinse
her mouth with. Aroma was uneasy about being waited on by her master; but fearing
that if she refused his services he would insist on disturbing everybody, she lay back
and allowed him to fuss over her.
As soon as it was daylight, Bao-yu threw on his clothes and, without even waiting to
wash or comb, went out of the Gar?den to his study in the front part of the mansion,
whither he summoned the doctor Wang Ji-ren for detailed questioning. When this
worthy had elicited the information that the hae?morrhage inquired about had been
caused by a blow, he seemed less disposed to take a serious view of the case, merely
naming some pills and giving perfunctory instructions for taking them internally and
for applying them in solution as a poultice. Bao-yu made a note of these instructions
and went back into the Garden to carry them out.
But that is no part of our story.

*

It was now the festival of the Double Fifth. Sprays of calamus and artemisia crowned
the doorways and everyone wore tiger amulets fastened on their clothing at the back.
At noon Lady Wang gave a little party at which Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were the
guests.

Bao-yu, finding Bao-chai somewhat glacial in her manner and evidently unwilling to
talk to him, knew that it must be because of his rudeness to her of the day before.
Lady Wang, observing Bao-yu’s dejected appearance, attri?buted it to
embarrassment about yesterday’s episode with Golden and ignored him even more
pointedly than Bao-chai.
Dai-yu, seeing how morose Bao-yu looked assumed that it was because Bao-chai was
offended with him and, feeling resent?ful that he should care, at once became as
morose as he was.
Xi-feng, having been told all about Bao-yu and Golden the night before by Lady Wang,
could scarcely be her usual laughing and joking self when she knew of her aunt’s
displeasure and, taking her cue from the latter, was if anything even more glacial
than the others.
And Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun, seeing everyone else so uncomfortable, soon
began to feel just as uncomfort?able themselves.
The result was that after sitting for only a very short time, the party broke up.
Dai-yu had a natural aversion to gatherings, which she rationalized by saying that
since the inevitable consequence of getting together was parting, and since parting
made people feel lonely and feeling lonely made them unhappy, ergo it was better
for them not to get together in the first place. In the same way she argued that since
the flowers, which give us so much pleasure when they open, only cause us a lot of
extra sadness when they die, it would be better if they didn’t come out at all.
Bao-yu was just the opposite. He always wanted the party to go on for ever and
flowers to be in perpetual bloom; and when at last the party did end and the flowers
did wither well, it was infinitely sad and distressing, but it couldn’t be helped.
And so today, while everyone else left the party with feel?ings of gloom, Dai-yu alone
was completely unaffected. Bao-?yu, on the other hand, returned to his room in a
mood of black despondency, sighing and muttering as he went.
Unfortunately it was the sharp-tongued Skybright who came forward to help him
change his clothes. With provok?ing carelessness she dropped a fan while she was
doing so and snapped the bone fan-sticks by accidentally treading on it.
‘Clumsy!’ said Bao-yu reproachfully. ‘You won’t be so careless with things when you
have a household of your own.’
Skybright gave a sardonic sniff.
‘You’re getting quite a temper lately, Master Bao. Almost every time we move
nowadays we get a nasty look from you. Yesterday even Aroma caught it. Today
you’re finding fault with me, so I suppose I can expect a few kicks too. Well, kick away.
But I must say, I shouldn’t have thought treading on a fan was such a very terrible
thing to do. In the past any num?ber of glass bowls and agate cups have got broken
without your turning a hair. Why this fuss about a fan, then? If you’re not satisfied
with my service, you ought to dismiss me and get someone better. Easy come, easy
go. No need for beating about the bush.’
By the time she had finished, Bao-yu was so angry that he was shaking all over.
‘You’ll go soon enough, don’t you worry!’ he said.
Aroma had heard all this from the adjoining room and now came hurrying in.
‘Now what’s all this about?’ she said, addressing herself to Bao-yu. ‘Didn’t I tell you?
As soon as I turn my back there’s trouble.’
‘If you knew that already,’ said Skybright, ‘it’s a pity you couldn’t have come in a bit
sooner and saved me from provok?ing him. Of course, we all know that you’re the
only one who knows how to serve him properly. None of the rest of us knows how
it’s done. I suppose it’s because you serve him so well that he gave you a kick in the
ribs yesterday. Heaven knows what he’s got in store for me for having served him so
badly!’
Angry, and at the same time ashamed, Aroma was about to retort; but the sight of
Bao-yu’s face, now white with anger, made her restrain herself.
‘Be a good girl - just go away and play for a bit. It’s we who are in the wrong.’
Skybright naturally assumed that ‘we’ meant Aroma and Bao-yu. Her jealousy was
further inflamed.
‘What do you mean, “we”?’ she said, ‘You two make me feel ashamed for you, you
really do — because you needn’t think you deceive me. I know what goes on
between you when you think no one is looking. But when all’s said and done, in
actual fact, when you come down to it, you’re not even a “Miss” by rights. By rights
you’re no better than any of the rest of us. I don’t know where you get this “we”
from.’
Aroma blushed and blushed with shame, until her face had become a dusky red
colour. Too late she realized her slip. By ‘we’ she had meant no more than ‘you and I’;
not ‘Bao-yu and I’ as Skybright imagined. But the pronoun had invited
misunderstanding.
It was Bao-yu who retorted, however.
‘I’ll make her a “Miss” then; I’ll make her my chamber-?wife tomorrow, if that’s all
that’s worrying you. You can spare your jealousy on that account.’
Aroma seized his hand impulsively.
‘Don’t argue with her, she’s only a silly girl. In any case, you’ve put up with much
worse than this in the past; why be so touchy today?’
Skybright gave a harsh little laugh.
‘Oh, yes. I’m too stupid to talk to. I’m only a slave.’
‘Are you arguing with me, Miss, or with Master Bao?’ said Aroma. ‘If it’s me you’ve
got it in for, you’d better address your remarks to me elsewhere. There’s no cause to
go quarrel?ling with me in front of Master Bao. But if it’s Master Bao you want to
quarrel with, then at least you might do it a bit more quietly and not let everyone
else know about it. When I came in just now, it was for everyone’s sake, so that we
could have a bit of peace and quiet. I don’t know why you had to turn on me and
start picking on my shortcomings. It seems as if you can’t make up your mind
whether you’re angry with me or with Master Bao. Slipping in a dig here and a dig
there. I don’t know what you think you’re up to. Anyway, I shan’t say any more; I’ll
just leave you here to get on with it.’
She walked out.
‘There’s no need for you to be so angry,’ Bao-yu said to Skybright. ‘I can guess what
it is that’s bothering you. I shall go and tell Her Ladyship that you’re old enough to
leave us now and ask her to send you away. That’s what you really want, isn’t it?’


‘I don’t want to go away. Why should I want to go away?’ said Skybright with tears
in her eyes now more upset than ever, ‘You’re inventing this as a means of getting rid
of me, aren’t you, because I’m in your way? But you won’t get away with it.’
‘Look, I’ve never had to put up with scenes like this before,’ said Bao-yu. ‘What
other reason can there be but that you want to leave? I really think I had better go
and see Her Ladyship about this.’
He got up and began to go; but Aroma came in again and barred his way.
‘Where are you off to?’ she asked him smilingly.
‘To see Her Ladyship.’
‘Oh, that’s silly,’ said Aroma. ‘I wonder you’re not ashamed to. Even if Skybright
really does want to leave, there will be plenty of time to tell Her Ladyship about it
when everyone has cooled down a bit and you are feeling calm and collected. If you
go rushing off in your present state, Her Ladyship will suspect something.’
‘Her Ladyship won’t suspect anything,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shall tell her quite openly that
Skybright has been agitating to leave.’
‘When have I ever agitated to leave?’ said Skybright, weeping now in earnest. ‘Even
if you’re angry with me, you ought not to twist things round in order to get the better
of me. But you go and tell her! I don’t care if I have to beat my own brains out, I’m
not going out of that door.’
‘Now that’s really strange,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t want to go, yet at the same time
you won’t keep quiet. It’s no good; I really can’t stand this quarrelling. I shall really
have to see Her Ladyship about this and get it over with.’
This time he seemed quite determined to go.
Seeing that she was unable to hold him back, Aroma went down on her knees.
Emerald, Ripple, Musk and the other maids, aware that a quarrel of more than usual
magnitude was going on inside, were waiting together outside in breathless silence.
When word reached them that Aroma was now on her knees interceding for
Skybright, they came silently troop?ing in to kneel down behind her. Bao-yu raised
Aroma to her feet, sighed, sat down on the edge of the bed, and told the other maids
to get up.
‘What do you want me to do?’ be asked Aroma. ‘My heart is destroyed inside me,
but none of you knows or cares.’
Tears started from his eyes and rolled down his cheeks un?heeded. Seeing his tears,
Aroma too began to cry. Skybright, who stood crying beside them, was about to say
something; but just at that moment Dai-yu walked in and she slipped outside.
Dai-yu beamed at the weeping pair:
‘Crying on a holiday? What’s all this about? Have you been quarrelling over the
rice-cakes?’
Bao-yu and Aroma both burst out laughing.
‘Well, if Cousin Bao won’t tell me,’ she went on, ‘I’m sure that you will. Come!’ she
said, slapping Aroma familiarly on the shoulder. ‘Tell sis all about it. It’s obvious that
the two of you have been having an argument. Tell me what it’s all about and I’ll
make it up between you.’
‘Oh, Miss!’ Aroma gave her a push. ‘Don’t carry on so! I’m only a maid; you
shouldn’t say such things to me.’
‘Only a maid?’ said Dai-yu. I always think of you as my sister-in-law.’
‘Don’t you see that you’re simply encouraging people to be nasty to her?’ Bao-yu
protested. ‘Even as it is, people already gossip about her. How can she stand up to
them if you come along and lend your weight to what they are saying?’
‘You don’t know what I feel, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘If I only knew how to stop
breathing, I’d gladly die.’
Dai-yu smiled.
‘If you were to die, I don’t know about anyone else, but I know that I should die of
grief.’
‘I should become a monk,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Try to be a bit more serious,’ said Aroma. ‘You and Miss Lin are both laughing at
me.’
Dai-yu held up two fingers and looked at Bao-yu with a quizzical expression.
‘That’s twice you’re going to become a monk. From now on I’m keeping the score.’
Bao-yu recognized the allusion to what he had said to her the day before. Fortunately
he was able to pass it off with a laugh. Shortly after that, Dai-yu left them.
No sooner had Dai-yu gone than someone arrived with an invitation from Xue Pan.
Bao-yu thought that this time he had better go. It turned out to be only a
drinking-party, but Xue Pan refused to release him and kept him there until it was
over. He returned home in the evening more than a little drunk.
As he came lurching into his courtyard, he saw that some?one in quest of coolness
had taken a bed outside and was lying down on it asleep. Assuming that it must be
Aroma, he sat down on the edge of it and gave her a push.
‘Is the pain any better?’
‘Can’t you leave me alone?’ she said, rising up wrathfully. He looked again and saw
that it was not Aroma after all but Skybright. Taking her by the hand, he drew her
down on the bed beside him.
‘You’re getting so self-willed,’ he said laughingly. ‘When you trod on that fan this
morning, I only made a harmless little remark, but look how you flew up in the air
about it! And then when Aroma, out of the kindness of her heart, tried to reason
with you, look how you pitched into her! Seriously, now, don’t you think it was all a
bit uncalled-for?’
‘I’m so hot,’ said Skybright. ‘Do you have to maul me about like this? Suppose
someone were to see us? Anyway, it’s not right for me to be sitting here.’
‘If you know it’s not right to be sitting here,’ he said teasingly, ‘what were you doing
lying down?’
‘Che-e-e!’ Unable at once to reply, she gave a little laugh. Then she said:
‘When you are not here it doesn’t matter. It’s your being here that makes it wrong.
Anyway, let me get up now, because I want to have a bath. Aroma and Musk have
had theirs al?ready. I’ll send them out to you.’
‘I’ve just had rather a lot to drink and I could do with a bath myself,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As
you haven’t had yours yet, bring the water out here and we’ll have a bath together.’
Skybright laughed and declined with a vigorous gesture of her hand.
‘Oh no! I daren’t start you off on that caper. I still remember that time you got
Emerald to help you bath. You must have been two or three hours in there, so that
we began to get quite worried. We didn’t like to go in while you were there, but
when we did go in to have a look afterwards, we found water all over the floor, pools
of water round the legs of the bed, and even the mat on the bed had water splashed
all over it. Heaven only knows what you’d been up to. We laughed about it for days
afterwards. I haven’t got time to fetch that amount of water. And in any case, you
don’t want to go taking baths with me. As a matter of fact it’s cooler now, so I don’t
think I shall have a bath after all. Why don’t you let me fetch you a bowl of water so
that you can have a nice wash and comb your hair? Faithful just sent a lot of fruit
round and we’ve got it soaking in iced water in the big glass bowl. I’ll tell them to
bring some out to you, shall I?’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you’re not having a bath yourself, I’ll just wash my hands;
and you can get me some of that fruit to eat.’
Skybright smiled.
‘You’ve already told me once today how clumsy I am. I can’t even drop a fan
without treading on it. So I’m much too clumsy to get your fruit for you. Suppose I
were to break a plate. That would be terrible!’
‘If you want to break it, by all means break it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘These things are there
for our use. What we use them for is a matter of individual taste. For example, fans
are made for fanning with; but if you prefer to tear them up because it gives you
pleasure, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t. What you mustn’t do is to use them
as objects to vent your anger on. It’s the same with plates and cups. Plates and cups
are made to put food and drink in. But if you want to smash them on purpose
because you like the noise, it’s perfectly all right to do so. As long as you don’t get
into a passion and start taking it out on things — that is the golden rule.’
‘All right then,’ said Skybright with a mischievous smile. ‘Give me your fan to tear. I
love the sound of a fan being torn.’
Bao-yu held it out to her. She took it eagerly and — chah! — promptly tore it in half.
And again — chah! chah! chah!—she tore it several more times. Bao-yu, an
appreciative onlooker, laughed and encouraged her.
‘Well torn! Well torn! Now again - a really loud one!’
Just then Musk appeared. She stared at them indignantly.
‘Don’t do that!’ she said. ‘It’s wicked to waste things like that.’
But Bao-yu leaped up to her, snatched the fan from her hand, and passed it to
Skybright, who at once tore it into several pieces. The two of them, Bao-yu and
Skybright, then burst into uproarious laughter.
‘What do you think you’re doing?’ said Musk. ‘That’s my fan you’ve just ruined.’
‘What’s an old fan?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Open up the fan box and get yourself another.’
‘If that’s your attitude,’ said Musk, ‘we might as well carry out the whole boxful and
let her tear away to her heart’s con?tent.’
‘All right. Go and get it,’ said Bao-yu.
‘And be born a beggar in my next life?’ said Musk. ‘No thank you I She hasn’t
broken her arm. Let her go and get it herself.’
Skybright stretched back on the bed, smiling complacently. ‘I’m rather tired just now.
I think I shall tear some more tomorrow.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘The ancients used to say that for one smile of a beautiful woman a thousand taels
are well spent. For a few old fans it’s cheap at the price!’
He called to Aroma, who had just finished changing into clean clothes, to come
outside and join them. Little Melilot came and cleared away the broken bits of fan,
and everyone sat for a while and enjoyed the cool.
But our narrative supplies no further details of that evening.

*

About noon next day, while Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the girls were sitting in
Grandmother Jia’s room, some?one came in to announce that ‘Miss Shi’ had arrived.
Shortly afterwards Shi Xiang-yun appeared in the courtyard, attended by a bevy of
matrons and maids. Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the rest hurried out to the foot of the steps
to welcome her.
For young girls like the cousins a reunion after a mere month’s separation is an
occasion for touching demonstrations of affection. After these initial transports,
when they were all indoors and the greetings, introductions and salutations had
been completed, Grandmother Jia suggested that, as the weather was so hot,
Xiang-yun should remove her outer gar?ments. Xiang-yun rose to her feet with
alacrity and divested herself of one or two layers. Lady Wang was amused.
‘Gracious, child! What a lot you have on! I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone
wearing so much.’
‘It’s my Aunt Shi who makes me wear it all,’ said Xiang yun. ‘You wouldn’t catch me
wearing this stuff if I didn’t have to.’
‘You don’t know our Xiang-yun, Aunt,’ Bao-chai inter?posed. ‘She’s really happiest
in boy’s clothes. That time she was here in the third or fourth month last year, I
remember one day she dressed up in one of Bao-yu’s gowns and put a pair of his
boots on and one of his belts round her waist. At first glance she looked exactly like
Cousin Bao. It was only the ear-rings that gave her away. When she stood behind that
chair over there, Grandmother was completely taken in. She said, “Bao-yu, come
over here! You’ll get the dust from that hanging lamp in your eyes if you’re not
careful.” But Xiang?-yun just smiled and didn’t move. It was only when everyone
couldn’t hold it in any longer and started laughing that Grandmother realized who it
was and joined in the laugh. She told her that she made a very good-looking boy.’
‘That’s nothing,’ said Dai-yu. ‘What about that time last year when she came to stay
for a couple of days with us in the first month and it snowed? Grandma and Auntie
Wang had just got back from somewhere — I think it was from visiting the ancestors’
portraits — and she saw Grandma’s new scarlet felt rain-cape lying there and put it
on when no one was looking. Of course, it was much too big and much too long for
her, so she hitched it up and tied it round her waist with a sash and went out like that
into the back courtyard to help the maids build a snowman. And then she slipped
over in it and got covered all over with mud—’
The others all laughed at the recollection.
Bao-chai asked Xiang-yun’s nurse, Mrs Zhou, whether Xiang-yun was still as
tomboyish as ever. Nurse Zhou laughed but said nothing.
‘I don’t mind her being tomboyish,’ said Ying-chun, ‘but I do wish she wasn’t such a
chatterbox. You wouldn’t believe it — even when she’s in bed at night it still goes on.
Jabber-jabber, jabber-jabber. Then she laughs. Then she talks a bit more. Then she
laughs again. And you never heard such a lot of rubbish in your life, I don’t know
where she gets it all from.’
‘Well, perhaps she’ll have got over that by now,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I hear that
someone was round the other day to talk about a betrothal. Now that there’s a
future mother-in-law to think about, she can’t be quite as tomboyish as she used to
be.’
‘Are you staying this time, or do you have to go back to?night?’ asked Grandmother
Jia.
‘Your Old Ladyship hasn’t seen all the clothes she’s brought,’ said Nurse Zhou.
‘She’ll be staying two days here at the very least.’
‘Isn’t Bao at home?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Listen to her!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Bao is the only one she thinks about. He and
she get on well together because they are both fond of mischief. You can see she
hasn’t really changed.’
‘Perhaps now that you’re getting older you had better stop using baby-names,’ said
Grandmother Jia, reminded by the talk of betrothal that her babies were rapidly
turning into grown-ups.
Just then Bao-yu came in.
‘Ah! Hallo, Yun! Why didn’t you come when we sent for you the other day?’
‘Grandmother has just this moment been saying that it is time you all stopped
using baby-names,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I must say, this isn’t a very good beginning.’
‘Our cousin has got something nice to give you,’ said Dai?-yu to Xiang-yun.
‘Oh? What is it?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Don’t believe her,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Goodness! It’s no time since you were here last,
but you seem to have grown taller already.’
Xiang-yun laughed.
‘How’s Aroma?’
‘She’s fine. Thank you for asking.’
‘I’ve brought something for her,’ said Xiang-yun. She produced a knotted-up silk
handkerchief.
‘What treasure have you got wrapped up in there?’ said Bao-yu. ‘The best present
you could have brought Aroma would have been a couple of those cheap agate rings
like the ones you sent us the other day.’
‘What are these, then?’
With a triumphant smile she opened her little bundle and revealed four rings, each
inset with the veined red agate they had so much admired on a previous occasion.
‘What a girl!’ said Dai-yu. ‘These are exactly the same as the ones you sent us the
other day by messenger. Why didn’t you get him to bring these too and save yourself
some trouble? I thought you must have got some wonderful rarity tied up in that
handkerchief, seeing that you’d gone to all the trouble of bringing it here yourself —
and all the time it was only a few more of those! You really are rather a silly.’
‘Thilly yourthelf!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The others can decide which of us is the silly one
when I have explained my reason. If I send things for you and the girls, it’s assumed
that they are for you without the messenger even needing to say any?thing; but if I
send things for any of the maids, I have to explain very carefully to the messenger
which ones I mean. Now if the messenger is someone intelligent, that’s all right; but
if it’s someone not so bright who has difficulty in remembering names, they’ll
probably make such a mess of it that they’ll get not only the maids’ presents mixed
up, but yours as well. Then again, if the messenger is a woman, it’s not so bad; but
the other day it was one of the boys - and you know how hopeless they are over girls’
names. So you see, I thought it would be simpler if I delivered the maids’ ones myself.
There!’— she laid the rings down one after another on the table — ‘One for Aroma;
one for Faithful; one for Golden; and one for Patience. Can you imagine one of the
boys getting those four names right?’
The others laughed.
‘Clever! Clever!’ they said.
‘You’re always so eloquent,’ said Bao-yu. ‘No one else gets a chance.’
‘If she weren’t so eloquent, she wouldn’t be worthy of the gold kylin,’ said Dai-yu
huffily, rising from her seat and walk?ing off as she spoke.
Fortunately no one heard her but Ban-chai, who made a laughing grimace, and
Bao-yu, who immediately regretted having once more spoken out of turn, but who,
suddenly catching sight of Bao-chai’s expression, could not help laugh?ing himself.
Seeing him laugh, Bao-chai at once rose from her seat and hurried off to joke with
Dai-yu.
‘When you’ve finished your tea and rested a bit,’ said Grandmother Jia to Xiang-yun,
‘you can go and see your married cousins. After that, you can amuse yourself in the
Garden with the girls. It’s nice and cool there.’
Xiang-yun thanked her grandmother. She wrapped up three of the rings again, and
after sitting a little longer, went off, attended by her nannies and maids, to call on
Wang Xi-?feng. After chatting a while with her, she went into the Gar?den and called
on Li Wan. Then, after sitting a short while with Li Wan, she went off in the direction
of Green Delights in quest of Aroma. Before doing so, however, she turned to
dis?miss her escort.
‘You needn’t stay with me any longer,’ she said. ‘You can go off now and visit your
relations. I’ll just keep Fishy to wait on me.
The others thanked her and went off to look for various kith and kin, leaving
Xiang-yun alone with Kingfisher.
‘Why aren’t these water-lilies out yet?’ said Kingfisher.
‘It isn’t time for them yet,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Look, they’re going to be “double-decker” ones, like the ones in our lily-pond at
home,’ said Kingfisher.
‘Our ones are better,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘They’ve got a pomegranate-tree here which has four or five lots of flowers growing
one above the other on each branch,’ said Kingfisher. ‘That’s a
double-double-double?-decker. I wonder what makes them grow like that.’
‘Plants are the same as people,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The healthier their constitution is,
the better they grow.’
‘I don’t believe that,’ said Kingfisher with a toss of her head. ‘If that were so, why
don’t we see people walking around with one head growing on top of the other?’
Xiang-yun was unable to avoid laughing at the girl’s sim?plicity.
‘I’ve told you before, you talk too much,’ she said. ‘Let’s see: how can one answer a
question like that? Everything in the world is moulded by the forces of Yin and Yang.
That means that, besides the normal, the abnormal, the peculiar, the freakish — in
fact all the thousands and thousands of different variations we find in things — are
caused by different combina?tions of Yin and Yang. Even if something appears that is
so rare that no one has ever seen it before, the principle is still the same.’
‘So according to what you say,’ said Kingfisher, ‘all the things that have ever existed,
from the time the world began right up to the present moment, have just been a lot
of Yins and Yangs.’
‘No, stupid!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The more you say, the sil?lier you get. “Just a lot of
Yins and Yangs” indeed! In any case, strictly speaking Yin and Yang are not two things
but one and the same thing. By the time the Yang has become exhausted, it is Yin;
and by the time the Yin has become exhausted, it is Yang. It isn’t a case of one of
them coming to an end and then the other one growing out of nothing.’
‘That’s too deep for me,’ said Kingfisher. ‘What sort of thing is a Yin-yang, I’d like to
know? No one’s ever seen one. You just answer that, Miss. What does a Yin-yang look
like?’
‘Yin-yang is a sort of force,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It’s the force in things that gives them
their distinctive forms. For example, the sky is Yang and the earth is Yin; water is Yin
and fire is Yang; the sun is Yang and the moon is Yin.’
‘Ah yes! Now I understand,’ said Kingfisher happily. ‘That’s why astrologers call the
sun the “Yang star” and the moon the “Yin star”.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘She understands.’
‘That’s not so difficult,’ said Kingfisher. ‘But what about things like mosquitoes and
fleas and midges and plants and flowers and bricks and tiles? Surely you are not
going to say that they are all Yin-yang too?’
‘Certainly they are!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Take the leaf of a tree, for example. That’s
divided into Yin and Yang. The side facing upwards towards the sky is Yang; the
underside, facing towards the ground, is Yin.’
Kingfisher nodded.
‘I see. Yes. I can understand that. But take these fans we are holding. Surely they
don’t have Yin and Yang?’
‘Yes they do. The front of the fan is Yang; the back of the fan is Yin.’
Kingfisher nodded, satisfied. She tried to think of some other object to ask about, but
being for the moment unable to, she began looking around her for inspiration. As she
did so, her eye chanced to light on the gold kylin fastened in the intricate loopings of
her mistress’s girdle.
‘Well, Miss,’ she said, pointing triumphantly to the kylin, you’re not going to say
that that’s got Yin and Yang?
‘Certainly. In the case of birds and beasts the males are Yang and the females are
Yin.’
‘Is this a daddy one or a mummy one?’ said Kingfisher.
‘“A daddy one or a mummy one”! Silly girl!’
‘All right, then,’ said Kingfisher. ‘But why is it that everything else has Yin and Yang
but we haven’t?’
‘Get along with you, naughty girl! What subject will you get on to next?’
‘Why? Why can’t you tell me?’ said Kingfisher. ‘Anyway, I know; so there’s no need
for you to be so nasty to me.’
Xiang-yun suppressed a giggle.
‘You’re Yang and I’m Yin,’ said Kingfisher.
Xiang-yun held her handkerchief to her mouth and laughed ‘Well, that’s right, isn’t
it?’ said Kingfisher. ‘What are you laughing at?’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘That’s quite right.’
‘That’s what they always say,’ said Kingfisher: ‘the master is Yang and the servant is
Yin. Even I can understand that principle.’
‘I’m sure you can,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Very good.’
While they were talking, a glittering golden object at the foot of the rose pergola
caught Xiang-yun’s eye. She pointed it out to Kingfisher.
‘Go and see what it is,’
Kingfisher bounded over and picked it up.
‘Ah ha!’ she said, examining the object in her hand. ‘Now we shall be able to see
whether it’s Yin or Yang.’
She took hold of the kylin fastened to Xiang-yun’s girdle and held it up to look at it
more closely. Xiang-yun wanted to see what it was that she held in her hand, but
Kingfisher wouldn’t let her.
‘It’s my treasure,’ she said with a laugh. ‘I won’t let you see it, Miss. Funny, though.
I wonder where it came from. I’ve never seen anyone here wearing it.’
‘Come on! Let me look,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘There you are, Miss!’ Kingfisher opened her hand.
Xiang-yun looked. It was a beautiful, shining gold kylin, both larger and more ornate
than the one she was wearing. Reach?ing out and taking it from Kingfisher, she held
it on the palm of her hand and contemplated it for some moments in silence.
Whatever reverie the contemplation inspired was broken by the sudden arrival of
Bao-yu.
‘What are you doing, standing out here in the blazing sun?’ he asked her. ‘Why
don’t you go and see Aroma?’
‘We were on our way,’ said Xiang-yun, hurriedly conceal?ing the gold kylin.
The three of them entered the courtyard of Green Delights together.
Aroma had gone outside to take the air and was leaning on the verandah railings at
the foot of the front door steps. As soon as she caught sight of Xiang-yun, she hurried
down into the courtyard to welcome her, and taking her by the hand, led her into the
house, animatedly exchanging news with her as they went.
‘You should have come sooner,’ said Bao-yu when they were indoors and Aroma
had made Xiang-yun take a seat. ‘I’ve got something nice for you here and I’ve been
waiting for you to come so that I could give it to you.’
He had been hunting through his pockets as he said this. Not finding what he was
searching for, he exclaimed in sur?prise.
‘Aiyo!’ He turned to Aroma. ‘Have you put it away some?where?’
‘Put what away?’
‘That little kylin I got the other day.’
‘You’ve been carrying it around with you everywhere,’ said Aroma. ‘Why ask me
about it?’
Bao-yu clapped his hands together in vexation.
‘Oh, I’ve lost it! Wherever am I going to look for it?’
He got up to begin searching.
Xiang-yun now realized that it must have been Bao-yu who dropped the kylin she had
only a few minutes earlier dis?covered outside.
‘Since when have you had a kylin?’ she asked him. ‘Oh, several days now,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘What a shame! I’ll never get another one like that. And the trouble is, I don’t
know when I can have lost it. Oh dear! How stupid of me!’
‘It’s only an ornament you’re getting so upset about,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What a good
job it wasn’t something more serious!’
She opened her hand:
‘Look! Is that it?’
Bao-yu looked and saw, with extravagant delight, that it was.
The remainder of this episode will be told in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 32
Bao-yu demonstrates confusion of mind by making his
declaration to the wrong person
And Golden shows an unconquerable spirit by ending her
humiliation in death

OUR last chapter told of Bao-yu’s delight at seeing the gold kylin again. He reached
out eagerly and took it from Xiang-?yun’s hand.
‘Fancy your finding it!’ he said. ‘How did you come to pick it up?’
‘It’s a good job it was only this you lost,’ she said. ‘One of these days it will be your
seal of office — and then it won’t be quite so funny.’
‘Oh, losing one’s seal of office is nothing,’ said Bao-yu. Losing a thing like this is
much more serious.’
Aroma meanwhile was pouring tea.
‘I heard your good news the other day,’ she said, handing Xiang-yun a cup.
‘Congratulations!’
Xiang-yun bent low over the cup to hide her blushes and made no reply.
‘Why so bashful, Miss?’ said Aroma. ‘Have you forgotten the things you used to tell
me at night all those years ago, when we used to sleep together in the little
closet-bed at Her Old Ladyship’s? You weren’t very bashful then. What makes you so
bashful with me now, all of a sudden?’
Xiang-yun’s face became even redder. She gave a forced little laugh.
‘Who’s talking? That was a time when you and I were very close to each other.
Then I had to go back home when my uncle’s first wife died and you were given
Cousin Bao to look after, and I don’t know why, but whenever I came back here after
that, you seemed somehow changed towards me.’
It was now Aroma’s turn to blush and protest.
‘When you first came to live here it was “Pearl dear this” and “Pearl dear that” all
the time. You were always coaxing me to do things for you — do your hair, wash your
face, or I don’t know what. But now that’s all changed. Now you’re the young lady,
aren’t you? You can’t act the young lady with me and expect me to stay on the same
familiar terms as before.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Xiang-yun, now genuinely indignant. ‘That’s tho unfair. I wish I
may die if I ever “acted the young lady” with you, as you put it. I come here in this
frightful heat, and the very first person I want to see when I get here is you. Ask Fishy
if you don’t believe me. She can tell you. At home I’m always going on about you.’
Aroma and Bao-yu both laughed.
‘Don’t take it to heart so, it was only a joke. You shouldn’t be so excitable.’
‘Don’t, whatever you do, admit that what you said was wounding,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Say I’m “excitable” and put me in the wrong!’
While she said this, she was undoing the knotted silk hand-kerchief and extracting
one of the three rings from it. She handed it to Aroma. Aroma was greatly touched.
‘I’ve got one like this already,’ she said. ‘It was given to me when you sent those
ones the other day to the young ladies. But fancy your bringing this one here
specially! Now I know you haven’t forgotten me. It’s little things like this that show
you what a person really is. The ring itself isn’t worth much, I know. It’s the thought
behind it.’
‘Who gave you the one you’ve already got?’ said Xiang-?yun.
‘Miss Bao,’ said Aroma.
‘Ah,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘Miss Bao. And I was thinking it must have been Miss Lin.
Often when I’m at home I think to myself that of all my cousins Bao-chai is the one I
like best. It’s a pity we couldn’t have been born of the same mother. With her for an
elder sister it wouldn’t matter so much being an orphan.’
Her eyelids reddened as she said this and she seemed to be on the verge of tears.
‘Now, now, now!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t say things like that.’
‘And why not?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Oh, I know your trouble. You’re afraid that Cousin
Lin might hear and get angry with me again for praising Cousin Bao. That’s what’s
worrying you, isn’t it?’
Aroma giggled.
‘Oh Miss Yun! You’re just as outspoken as you used to be.’
‘Well, I’ve said that you lot are difficult to talk to,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and I was certainly
right!’
‘Don’t make me sick,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘You say what you like to us. It’s with your
Cousin Lin that you have to be so careful.’
‘Never mind about that,’ said Aroma. ‘Joking apart, now: I want to ask you a favour.’
‘What is it?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘I’ve got a pair of slipper-tops here that I’ve already cut the openwork pattern in,
but as I haven’t been very well this last day or two, I haven’t been able to sew them
on to the backing material. Do you think you’d have time to do them for me?’
‘That’s rather a strange request,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Quite apart from all the clever
maids this household employs you have your own full-time tailors and embroiderers.
Why ask me to do your sewing? You could give it to anyone here you liked. They
could hardly refuse you.’
‘You can’t be serious,’ said Aroma. ‘None of the sewing in this room is allowed to go
outside. Surely you knew that?’
Xiang-yun inferred from this that the slippers in question were for Bao-yu.
‘Oh well,’ she said, ‘in that case I suppose I’d better do them for you. On one
condition, though: I’ll do them if they are for you to wear, but if they are for anyone
else, I’m afraid I can’t.’
‘Get along with you!’ said Aroma. ‘Ask you to make slippers for me? I wouldn’t have
the nerve. No, I’ll be honest with you, they’re not for me. Never mind who they’re for.
Just tell yourself that I’m the one you’ll be doing the favour.’
‘It isn’t that,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘In the past I’ve done lots of things for you. Surely you
must know what makes me un?willing now?’
‘I’m sorry, I don’t,’ said Aroma.
‘What about the person who got in a temper the other day when that fan-case I
made for you was compared with hers and cut it up with a pair of scissors? I heard all
about that, so don’t start protesting. If you expect me to do sewing for you after that,
you’re just treating me as your drudge.’
‘I didn’t know at the time it was you who made it,’ Bao-yu put in hurriedly.
‘He really didn’t,’ said Aroma. ‘I pretended there was some?one outside we’d just
discovered who could do very fine and original needlework. I told him I’d got them to
do that fan?-case for him as a sample. He believed what I said and went around
showing it to everyone. Unfortunately while he was doing this he upset you know
who and she took a pair of scissors and cut it in pieces. Afterwards he was very
anxious to have some more work done by the same person, so I had to tell him who
it really was. He was very upset when he heard that it was you.’
‘I still think this is a very strange request,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘If Miss Lin can cut things
up, she can sew them for him, too. Why not ask her to do them for you?’
‘Oh, she wouldn’t want to do them,’ said Aroma. ‘And even if she did, Her Old
Ladyship wouldn’t let her, for fear of her tiring herself. The doctors say she needs rest
and quiet. I wouldn’t want to trouble her with them. Last year she took practically
the whole year embroidering one little purse, and this last six months I don’t think
she’s picked up a needle.’
Their conversation was interrupted by a servant with a message:
‘Mr Jia of Rich Street is here. The Master says will Master Bao receive him, please?’
Recognizing the ‘Mr Jia’ of the message as Jia Yu-cun, Bao-yu was more than a little
vexed. While Aroma hurried off for his going-out clothes, he sat pulling his boots on
and grumbling.
‘He’s got Father to talk to, surely that’s enough for him? Why does he always have
to see me?’
Xiang-yun laughed at his disgruntlement:
‘I’m sure you’re very good at entertaining people,’ she said. ‘That’s why Sir Zheng
asks you to see him.’
‘That message didn’t come from Father,’ said Bao-yu. ‘He’ll have made it up
himself.’
‘“When the host is refined, the callers are frequent,”’ said Xiang-yun. ‘There must
be something about you that has impressed him, otherwise he wouldn’t want to see
you.’
‘I make no claim to being refined, thanks all the same,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m as common
as dirt. And furthermore I have no wish to mix with people of his sort.’
‘You’re incorrigible,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Now that you’re older, you ought to be mixing
with these officials and ad?ministrators as much as you can. Even if you don’t want to
take the Civil Service examinations and become an adminis?trator yourself, you can
learn a lot from talking to these people about the way the Empire is governed and
the people who govern it that will stand you in good stead later on, when you come
to manage your own affairs and take your place in society. You might even pick up
one or two decent, respect?able friends that way. You’ll certainly never get anywhere
if you spend all your time with us girls.’
Bao-yu found such talk highly displeasing.
‘I think perhaps you’d better go and sit in someone else’s room,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t
want a decent, respectable young lady like you to get contaminated.’
‘Don’t try reasoning with him, Miss,’ Aroma put in hur?riedly. ‘Last time Miss Bao
tried it, he was just as rude to her. No consideration for her feelings whatever. He just
said “Hai!”, picked up his heels, and walked out of the room, leaving her still half-way
through her sentence. Poor Miss Bao! She was so embarrassed she turned bright red.
She didn’t know what to say. A good job it was her, though, and not Miss Lin. If it had
been Miss Lin, there’d have been weeping and carrying on and I don’t know what. I
really admire the way Miss Bao behaved on that occasion. She just stood there a
while collecting herself and then walked quietly out of the room. Myself, I was quite
upset, thinking she must be offended. But not a bit of it. Next time she came round,
it was just as if nothing had happened. A real little lady, Miss Bao — and
generous-hearted, too. And yet the funny thing is that his lordship seems to have
fallen out with her, whereas Miss Lin, who is always getting on her high horse and
ignoring him, has him running round and apologizing to her all the time.’
‘Have you ever heard Miss Lin talking that sort of stupid rubbish?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’d
long since have fallen out with her if she did.’
Aroma and Xiang-yun shook their heads pityingly.
‘So that’s “stupid rubbish”, is it?’ they said, laughing.

*

Dai-yu rightly surmised that now Xiang-yun had arrived, Bao-yu would lose no time in
telling her about his newly? acquired kylin.
Now Dai-yu had observed that in the romances which Bao-yu smuggled in to her and
of which she was nowadays an avid consumer, it was always some trinket or small
object of clothing or jewellery a pair of lovebirds, a male and female phoenix, a jade
ring, a gold buckle, a silken handker?chief, an embroidered belt or what not — that
brought the heroes and heroines together. And since the fate and future happiness of
those fortunate beings seemed to depend wholly on the instrumentality of such
trifling objects, it was natural for her to suppose that Bao-yu’s acquisition of the gold
kylin would become the occasion of a dramatic rupture with her and the beginning of
an association with Xiang-yun in which he and Xiang-yun would do together all those
delightful things that she had read about in the romances.
It was with such apprehensions that she made her way stealthily towards Green
Delights, her intention being to observe how the two of them were behaving and
shape her own actions accordingly. Imagine her surprise when, just as she was about
to enter, she heard Xiang-yun lecturing Bao-yu on his social obligations and Bao-yu
telling Xiang-yun that ‘Cousin Lin never talked that sort of rubbish’ and that if she did
he would have ‘fallen out with her long ago’. Mingled emotions of happiness, alarm,
sorrow and regret assailed her.
Happiness:
Because after all (she thought) I wasn’t mistaken in my judgement of you. I always
thought of you as a true friend, and I was right.
Alarm:
Because if you praise me so unreservedly in front of other people, your warmth and
affection are sure, sooner or later, to excite suspicion and be misunderstood.
Regret:
Because if you are my true friend, then I am yours and the two of us are a perfect
match. But in that case why did there have to be all this talk of ‘the gold and the jade’?
Alternatively, if there had to be all this talk of gold and jade, why weren’t we the two
to have them? Why did there have to be a Bao-chai with her golden locket?
Sorrow:
Because though there are things of burning importance to be said, without a father
or a mother I have no one to say them for me. And besides, I feel so muzzy lately and
I know that my illness is gradually gaining a hold on me. (The doctors say that the
weakness and anaemia I suffer from may be the beginnings of a consumption.) So
even if I am your true love, I fear I may not be able to wait for you. And even though
you are mine, you can do nothing to alter my fate.
At that point in her reflections she began to weep; and feel?ing in no fit state to be
seen, she turned away from the door and began to make her way back again.
Bao-yu had finished his hasty dressing and now came out of the house. He saw
Dai-yu slowly walking on ahead of him and, judging by her appearance from behind,
wiping her eyes. He hurried forward to catch up with her.
‘Where are you off to, coz? Are you crying again? Who has upset you this time?’
Dai-yu turned and saw that it was Bao-yu.
‘I’m perfectly all right,’ she said, forcing a smile. ‘What would I be crying for?’
‘Look at you! The tears are still wet on your face. How can you tell such fibs?’
Impulsively he stretched out his hand to wipe them. Dai-yu recoiled several paces:
‘You’ll get your head chopped off!’ she said. ‘You really must keep your hands to
yourself.’
‘I’m sorry. My feelings got the better of me. I’m afraid I wasn’t thinking about my
head.’
‘No, I forgot,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Losing your head is nothing, is it? It’s losing your
kylin—the famous gold kylin - that is really serious!’
Her words immediately put Bao-yu in a passion. He came up to her and held his face
close to hers.
‘Do you say these things to put a curse on me? or is it merely to make me angry
that you say them ?’
Remembering their recent quarrel, Dai-yu regretted her careless reintroduction of its
theme and hastened to make amends:
‘Now don’t get excited. I shouldn’t have said that - oh come now, it really isn’t that
important! Look at you! The veins are standing out on your forehead and your face is
all covered with sweat.’
She moved forward and wiped the perspiration from his brow. For some moments he
stood there motionless, staring at her. Then he said:
‘Don’t worry!’
Hearing this, Dai-yu herself was silent for some moments.
‘Why should I worry?’ she said eventually. ‘I don’t under?stand you. Would you
mind telling me what you are talking about?’
Bao-yu sighed.
‘Do you really not understand? Can I really have been all this time mistaken in my
feelings towards you? If you don’t even know your own mind, it’s small wonder that
you’re always getting angry on my account.’
‘I really don’t understand what you mean about not worry?ing,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-yu sighed again and shook his head.
‘My dear coz, don’t think you can fool me. If you don’t understand what I’ve just
said, then not only have feelings towards you been all along mistaken, but all that
yon have ever felt for me has been wasted, too. It’s because you worry so much that
you’ve made yourself ill. If only you could take things a bit easier, your illness
wouldn’t go on getting more and more serious all the time.’
Dai-yu was thunderstruck. He had read her mind - had seen inside her more clearly
than if she had plucked out her entrails and held them out for his inspection. And
now there were a thousand things that she wanted to tell him; yet though she was
dying to speak, she was unable to utter a single syllable and stood there like a
simpleton, gazing at him in silence.
Bao-yu, too, had a thousand things to say, but he, too, stood mutely gazing at her, not
knowing where to begin.
After the two of them had stared at each other for some considerable time in silence,
Dai-yu heaved a deep sigh. The tears gushed from her eyes and she turned and
walked away. Bao-yu hurried after her and caught at her dress.
‘Coz dear, stop a moment! Just let me say one word.’
As she wiped her eyes with one hand, Dai-yu pushed him away from her with the
other.
‘There’s nothing to say. I already know what you want to tell me.’
She said this without turning back her head, and having said it, passed swiftly on her
way. Bao-yu remained where he was standing, gazing after her in silent stupefaction.
Now Bao-yu had left the apartment in such haste that he had forgotten to take his
fan with him. Fearing that he would be very hot without it, Aroma hurried outside to
give it to him, but when she noticed him standing some way ahead of her talking to
Dai-yu, she halted. After a little while she saw Dai-yu walk away and Bao-yu continue
standing motionless where he was. She chose this moment to go up and speak to
him.
‘You’ve gone out without your fan,’ she said. ‘It’s a good job I noticed. Here you are.
I ran out to give it to you.’
Bao-yu, still in a muse, saw Aroma there talking to him, yet without clearly perceiving
who it was. With the same glazed look in his eyes, he began to speak.
‘Dearest coz! I’ve never before dared to tell you what I felt for you. Now at last I’m
going to pluck -up courage and tell you, and after that I don’t care what becomes of
me. Because of you I, too, have made myself ill — only I haven’t dared tell anyone
about it and have had to bear it all in silence. And the day that your illness is cured, I
do believe that mine, too, will get better. Night and day, coz, sleeping and dreaming,
you are never out of my mind.’
Aroma listened to this declaration aghast.
‘Holy saints preserve us!’ she exclaimed. ‘He’ll be the death of me.’
She gave him a shake.
‘What are you talking about? Are you bewitched? You’d better hurry.’
Bao-yu seemed suddenly to waken from his trance and recognized the person he had
been speaking to as Aroma. His face turned a deep red with embarrassment and he
snatched the fan from her and fled.

*

After he had gone, Aroma began thinking about the words he had just said and
realized that they must have been intended for Dai-yu. She reflected with some
alarm that if things be?tween them were as his words seemed to indicate, there was
every likelihood of an ugly scandal developing, and wondered how she could arrange
matters to prevent it. Preoccupied with these reflections, she stood as motionless
and unseeing as her master had done a few moments before. Bao-chai found her in
this state on her way back from the house.
‘What are you brooding on, out in the burning sun?’ she asked her, laughing.
Aroma laughed back.
‘There were two little sparrows here having a fight. They were so funny, I had to
stand and watch them.’
‘Where was Cousin Bao rushing off to just now, all dressed up for going out?’ said
Bao-chai. ‘I was going to call out and ask him, but he is getting so crotchety lately
that I thought I had better not.’
‘The Master sent for him,’ said Aroma.
‘Oh dear!’ said Bao-chai. ‘I wonder why he should send for him in heat like this? I
hope he hasn’t thought of something to be angry about and called him over to be
punished.’
‘No, it isn’t that,’ said Aroma. ‘I think it’s to receive a visitor.’
‘It must be a very tiresome visitor,’ said Bao-chai, ‘to go around bothering people
on a boiling day like this instead of staying at home and trying to keep cool.’
‘You can say that again!’ said Aroma.
‘What’s young Xiang-yun been doing at your place?’ said Bao-chai, changing the
subject.
‘We were having a chat,’ said Aroma, ‘and after that she had a look at some
slipper-tops that I’ve got ready pasted and have asked her to sew for me.’
‘You’re an intelligent young woman,’ said Bao-chai, having first looked to right and
left of her to make sure that no one else was about, ‘I should have thought you’d
have sense enough to leave her a few moments in peace. I’ve been watch?ing our
Yun lately, and from what I’ve observed of her and various stray remarks I’ve heard, I
get the impression that back at home she can barely call her soul her own. I know for
a fact that they are too mean to pay for professional seam?stresses and that nearly
all the sewing has to be done by the women of the household, and I’m pretty sure
that’s why, whenever she’s found herself alone with me on these last few visits, she’s
told me how tired she gets at home. When I press her for details, her eyes fill with
tears and she answers evasively, as though she’d like to tell me but daren’t. It must
be very hard for her, losing both her parents when she was so young. It quite wrings
my heart to see her so exploited.’
Aroma smote her hands together as understanding dawned.
‘Yes, I see. I see now why she was so slow with those ten butterfly bows I asked her
to sew for me last month. It was ages before she sent them, and even then there was
a message to say that she’d only been able to do them roughly. She told me I’d better
use them on something else. “If you want nice, even ones,” she said, “you’ll have to
wait until next time I come to stay with you.” Now I can see why. She didn’t like to
refuse when I asked her, but I suppose she had to sit up till midnight doing them,
poor thing. Oh, how stupid of me! I’d never have asked her if I’d realized.’
‘Last time she was here, she told me that it’s quite normal for her to sit up sewing
until midnight,’ said Bao-chai; ‘and if her aunt or the other women catch her doing
the slightest bit of work for anyone else, they are angry with her.’
‘It’s all the fault of that pig-headed young master of mine,’ said Aroma. ‘He refuses
to let any of his sewing be done by the seamstresses outside. Every bit of work, large
or small, has to be done in his room and I just can’t manage it all on my own.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘Why do you take any notice of him? Why not simply give it to the seamstresses
without telling him?’
‘He’s not so easy to fool,’ said Aroma. ‘He can tell the difference. I’m afraid there’s
nothing for it. I shall just have to work through it all gradually on my own.’
‘Now just a minute!’ said Bao-chai. ‘We’ll think of a way round this. Suppose I were
to do some of it for you?’
‘Would you really?’ said Aroma. ‘I’d be so grateful if you would. I’ll come over with
some this evening then.’
She had barely finished saying this when an old woman came rushing up to them in a
state of great agitation.
‘Isn’t it dreadful? Miss Golden has drowned herself in the well.’
‘Which Golden? said Aroma, startled.
‘Which Golden?’ said the old woman. ‘There aren’t two Goldens that I know of.
Golden from Her Ladyship’s room, of course, that was dismissed the day before
yesterday. She’d been crying and carrying on at home ever since, but nobody paid
much attention to her. Then suddenly, when they went to look for her, she wasn’t
there, and just now someone going to fetch water from the well by the south-east
corner found a body in it and rushed inside for help, and when they fished it out,
they found that it was Golden. They did all they could to revive her, but it was too
late. She was dead.’
‘How strange!’ said Bao-chai.
Aroma shook her head wonderingly and a tear or two stole down her cheek. She and
Golden had been like sisters to each other.
Bao-chai hurried off to Lady Wang’s to offer her sympathy. Aroma went back to
Green Delights.

When Bao-chai arrived at Lady Wang’s apartment she found the whole place hushed
and still and Lady Wang sitting in the inner room on her own, crying. Deeming it an
unsuitable moment to raise the subject of her visit, Bao-chai sat down beside her in
silence.
‘Where have you just come from?’ Lady Wang asked her.
‘The Garden.’
‘The Garden,’ Lady Wang echoed. ‘Did you by any chance see your cousin Bao-yu
there?’
‘I saw him going out just now wearing his outdoor clothes, but I don’t know where
he was going to.’
Lady Wang nodded and gave a sigh.
‘I don’t know if you’ve heard. Something very strange has happened. Golden has
drowned herself in a well.’
‘That is strange,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Why ever did she do that?’
‘The day before yesterday she broke something of mine,’ said Lady Wang, ‘and in a
moment of anger I struck her a couple of times and sent her back to her mother’s. I
had only been meaning to leave her there a day or two to punish her. After that I
would have had her back again. I never dreamed that she would be so angry with me
as to drown herself. Now that she has, I feel that it is all my fault.’
‘It’s only natural that a kind person like you should see it in that way,’ said Bao-chai,
‘but in my opinion Golden would never have drowned herself in anger. It’s much
more likely that she was playing about beside the well and slipped in accidentally.
While she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for
her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside. There’s no
earthly reason why she should have felt angry enough with you to drown herself. If
she did, all I can say is that she was a stupid person and not worth feeling sorry for!’
Lady Wang sighed and shook her head doubtfully.
‘Well, it may be as you say, but I still feel very uneasy in my mind.’
‘I’m sure you have no cause, Aunt,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but if you feel very much
distressed, I suggest that you simply give her family a little extra for the funeral. In
that way you will more than fulfill any moral obligation you may have towards her as
a mistress.’
‘I have just given her mother fifty taels,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I wanted to give her two
new outfits as well from one of the girls’ wardrobes, but it just so happens that at the
moment none of them apart from your Cousin Lin has got anything new that would
do. Your Cousin Lin has got two sets that we had made for her next birthday, but she
is such a sensitive child and has had so much sickness and misfortune in her life that
I’m afraid she would almost certainly feel superstitious about the clothes made for
her birthday being used for dress?ing a corpse with, so I’ve had to ask the tailors to
make up a couple in a hurry. Of course, if it were any other maid, I should have given
the mother a few taels and that would have been the end of the matter. But though
Golden was only a servant, she had been with me so long that she had become
almost like a daughter to me.’
She began to cry again as she said this.
‘There’s no need to hurry the tailors about this,’ said Bao-?chai. ‘I’ve got two new
outfits that I recently finished making for myself. Why not let her mother have them
and save them the trouble? Golden once or twice wore old dresses of mine in the
past, so I know they will fit her.’
‘That’s very kind of you, but aren’t you superstitious?’ said Lady Wang.
Bao-chai laughed.
‘Don’t worry about that, Aunt. That sort of thing has never bothered me.’
At that she rose and went off to fetch them. Lady Wang hurriedly ordered two of the
servants to go after her.
When Bao-chai returned with the clothes, she found Bao-yu sitting beside his mother
in tears. Lady Wang was evidently in the midst of rebuking him about something, but
as soon as she caught sight of Bao-chai, she closed her mouth and fell silent. From
the scene before her eyes and the word or two she had overheard, Bao-chai was able
to form a pretty good idea of what had been happening. She handed the clothes over
to Lady Wang and Lady Wang summoned Golden’s mother to come and fetch them.
What happened after that will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 33

An envious younger brother puts in a malicious word or two
And a scapegrace elder brother receives a terrible chastisement

OUR story last told how Golden’s mother was summoned to take away the clothing
that Bao-chai had brought for Golden’s laying-out. When she arrived, Lady Wang
called her inside, and after making her an additional present of some jewellery,
advised her to procure the services of some Buddhist monks to recite a sūtra for the
salvation of the dead girl’s soul. Golden’s mother kotowed her thanks and departed
with the clothes and jewellery.

The news that Golden’s disgrace had driven her to take her own life had reached
Bao-yu as he was returning from his interview with Jia Yu-cun, and he was already in
a state of shock when he went in to see his mother, only to be subjected by her to a
string of accusations and reproaches, to which he was unable to reply. He availed
himself of the opportunity presented by Bao-chai’s arrival to slip quietly out again,
and wandered along, scarcely knowing where he was going, still in a state of shock,
hands clasped behind him, head down low, and sighing as he went.
Without realizing it he was drifting towards the main re?ception hall, and was in fact
just emerging from behind the screen-wall that masked the gateway leading from the
inner to the outer part of the mansion, when he walked head-on into someone
coming from the opposite direction.
‘Stand where you are!’ said this person in a harsh voice.
Bao-yu looked up with a start and saw that it was his father. He gave an involuntary
gasp of fear and, dropping his hands to his sides, hastily assumed a more deferential
posture.
‘Now,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘will you kindly explain the meaning of these sighs and of this
moping, hang-dog appearance? You took your time coming when Yu-cun called for
you just now, and I gather that when you did eventually vouchsafe your presence, he
found you dull and listless and without a lively word to say for yourself. And look at
you now — sullenness and secret depravity written all over your face! What are
these sighings and groanings supposed to indicate? What have you got to he
discontented or displeased about? Come, sit! What is the meaning of this?’
Bao-yu was normally ready enough with his tongue, but on this occasion grief for
Golden so occupied his mind (at that moment he would very willingly have changed
places with her) that though he heard the words addressed to him by his father, he
failed to take in their meaning and merely stared back at him stupidly.
Seeing him too hypnotized by fear — or so it appeared — to answer with his usual
promptness, Jia Zheng, who had not been angry to start with, was now well on the
way to becoming so; but the irate comment he was about to make was checked
when a servant from the outer gate announced that a representative of ‘His Highness
the Prince of Zhong-shun’ had arrived.
Jia Zheng was puzzled.
‘The Prince of Zhong-shun?’ he thought. ‘I have never had any dealings with the
Prince of Zhong-shun. I wonder why he should suddenly send someone to see
me ...?’
‘He told the man to invite the prince’s messenger to sit in the hall, while he himself
hurried inside and changed into court dress. On entering the hall to receive his visitor,
he found that it was the Prince of Zhong-shun’s chamberlain who had come to see
him. After an exchange of bows and verbal salutations, the two men sat down and
tea was served. The chamberlain cut short the customary civilities by coming straight
to the point.
‘It would have been temerity on my part to have intruded on the leisure of an
illustrious scholar in the privacy of his home, but in fact it is not for the purpose of
paying a social call that I am here, but on orders from His Highness. His Highness has
a small request to make of you. If you will be so good as to oblige hint, not only will
His Highness be extremely grateful himself, but I and my colleagues will also be very
much beholden to you.’
Jia Zheng was totally at a loss to imagine what the purpose of the man’s visit might
be; nevertheless he rose to his feet out of respect for the prince and smiled politely.
‘You have orders from His Highness for me? I shall be happy to perform them if you
will have the goodness to instruct me.’
‘I don’t think any performing will be necessary,’ said the chamberlain drily. ‘All we
want from you is a few words. A young actor called Bijou — a female impersonator —
has gone missing from the palace. He hasn’t been back now for four or five days; and
though we have looked everywhere we can think of, we can’t make out where he can
have got to. How?ever, in the course of the very extensive inquiries we have made
both inside and outside the city, eight out of ten of the people we have spoken to say
that he has recently been very thick with the young gentleman who was born with
the jade in his mouth. Well, obviously we couldn’t come inside here and search as we
would have done if this had been anyone else’s house, so we had to go back and
report the matter to His Highness; and His Highness says that though he could view
the loss of a hundred ordinary actors with equanimity, this Bijou is so skilled in
anticipating his wishes and so essential to his peace of mind that it would be utterly
im?possible for him to dispense with his services. I have therefore come here to
request you to ask your son if he will be good enough to let Bijou come back again.
By doing so he will not only earn the undying gratitude of the Prince, but will also
save me and my colleagues a great deal of tiring and disagreeable searching.’
The chamberlain concluded with a sweeping bow.
Surprised and angered by what he had heard, Jia Zheng immediately sent for Bao-yu,
who presently came hurrying in, ignorant of what the reason for his summons might
be.
‘Miserable scum!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It is not enough, apparently, that you should
neglect your studies when you are at home. It seems that you must needs go
perpetrating enor?mities outside. This Bijou I have been hearing about is under the
patronage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Zhong-shun. How could you have the
unspeakable effrontery to commit an act of enticement on his person — involving
me, incidentally, in the consequences of your wrong-doing?’
The question made Bao-yu start.
‘I honestly know nothing about this,’ he said. ‘I don’t even know who or what
“Bijou” is, let alone what you mean by “enticement”’.
Jia Zheng was about to exclaim, but the chamberlain fore?stalled him.
‘There is really no point in concealment, young gentleman,’ he said coldly. ‘Even if
you are not hiding him here, we are sure that you know where he is. In either case
you had much better say straight out and save us a lot of trouble. I’d be greatly
obliged if you would.’
‘I really don’t know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You must have been misinformed.’
The chamberlain gave a sardonic laugh.
‘I have, of course, got evidence for what I am saying and I’m afraid you are doing
yourself little good by forcing me to mention it in front of your father. You say you
don’t know who Bijou is. Very well. Then will you kindly explain how his red
cummerbund came to find its way around your waist?’
Bao-yu stared at him open-mouthed, too stunned to reply.
‘If he knows even a private thing like that,’ he thought, ‘there’s little likelihood of
my being able to hoodwink him about anything else. I’d better get rid of him as
quickly as possible, before he can say any more.’
‘Since you have managed to find out so much about him,’ he said, finding his
tongue at last, ‘I’m surprised that so im?portant a thing as buying a house should
have escaped you. From what I’ve heard, he recently acquired a little villa and an
acre or so of land at Fort Redwood, seven miles east of the walls. I suppose he could
be there.’
The chamberlain smiled.
‘If you say so, then no doubt that is where we shall find him. I shall go and look
there immediately. If I do find him there, you will hear no more from me; if not, I
shall be back again for further instructions.’
So saying, he hurriedly took his leave.
Jia Zheng, his eyes glaring and his mouth contorted with rage, went after the
chamberlain to see him out. He turned briefly towards Bao-yu as he was leaving the
hall.
‘You stay where you are. I shall deal with you when I get back.’
As he was on his way in again after seeing the chamberlain off the premises, Jia Huan
with two or three pages at his heels came stampeding across the courtyard.
‘Hit that boy!’ Jia Zheng shouted, outraged. But Jia Huan, reduced to a quivering
jelly of fear by the sight of his father, had already jolted to a halt and was standing
with bowed head in front of him.
‘And what is the meaning of this?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What has become of the people
who are supposed to look after you? Why do they allow you to gallop around in this
extraordinary fashion?’ His voice rose to a shout: ‘Where are the people responsible
for taking this boy to school?’
Jia Huan saw in his father’s anger an opportunity of exer?cising his malice.
‘I didn’t mean to run, Father, but just as I was going by the well back there I saw the
body of a maid who had drowned herself — all swollen up with water, and her head
all swollen. It was horrible. I just couldn’t help myself.’
Jia Zheng heard him with incredulous horror.
‘What are you saying? Who has drowned herself? Such a thing has never before
happened in our family. Our family has always been lenient and considerate in its
treatment of in?feriors. It is one of our traditions. I suppose it is because I have been
too neglectful of household matters during these last few years. Those in charge have
felt encouraged to abuse their authority, until finally an appalling thing like this can
happen an innocent young life cut off by violence. What a terrible dis?grace to our
ancestors if this should get about!’ He turned and shouted a command.
‘Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da!’
‘Sir!’ chorused the pages, and were on the point of doing so when Jia Huan
impulsively stepped forward, threw himself on his knees and clung to his father’s
skirts.
‘Don’t be angry with me, Father, but apart from the ser?vants in Lady Wang’s room,
no one else knows anything about this. I heard my mother say -’
He broke off and glanced around behind him. Jia Zheng understood and signaled with
his eyes to the pages, who obediently withdrew some distance back to either side of
the courtyard. Jia Huan continued in a voice lowered almost to a whisper.
‘My mother told me that the day before yesterday, in Lady Wang’s room, my
brother Bao-yu tried to rape one of Her Ladyship’s maids called Golden, and when
she wouldn’t let him, he gave her a beating; and Golden was so upset that she threw
herself in the well and was drowned --’
Jia Zheng, whose face had now turned to a ghastly gold-leaf colour, interrupted him
with a dreadful cry.
‘Fetch Bao-yu!’
He began to stride towards his study, shouting to all and sundry as he went.
‘If anyone tries to stop me this time, I shall make over my house and property and
my post at the Ministry and every?thing else I have to him and Bao-yu. I absolutely
refuse to be responsible for the boy any longer. I shall cut off my few remaining hairs
(those that worry and wretchedness have left me) and look for some clean and
decent spot to end my days in. Perhaps in that way I shall escape the charge of
having dis?graced my ancestors by rearing this unnatural monster as my son.’
When they saw the state he was in, the literary gentlemen and senior menservants
who were waiting for him in the study, guessed that Bao-yu must be the cause of it
and, looking at each other with various grimaces, biting their thumbs or sticking their
tongues out, hastily retreated from the room. Jia-Zheng entered it alone and sat
down, stiffly upright, in a chair. He was breathing heavily and his face was bathed in
tears. Presently, when he had regained his breath, he barked out a rapid series of
commands:
‘Bring Bao-yu here. Get a heavy bamboo. Get some rope to tie him with. Close the
courtyard gates. If anyone tries to take word through inside, kill him!’
‘Sir! — Sir! — Sir!’ the terrified pages chorused in unison at each of his commands,
and some of them went off to look for Bao-yu.
Jia Zheng’s ominous ‘Stay where you are’ as he went out with the chamberlain had
warned Bao-yu that something dire was imminent — though just how much more
dire as a result of Jia Huan’s malicious intervention he could not have foreseen and as
he stood where his father had left him, he twisted and turned himself about,
anxiously looking for some passer-by who could take a message through to the
womenfolk inside. But no one came. Even the omnipresent Tealeaf was on this
occasion nowhere to be seen. Then suddenly, in answer to his prayers, an old woman
appeared — a darling, precious treasure of an old woman (or so she seemed at that
moment) — and he dashed forward and clung to her beseechingly.
‘Quickly!’ he said. ‘Go and tell them that Sir Zheng is going to beat me. Quickly!
Quickly! Goand tell. GO AND TELL.’
Partly because agitation had made him incoherent and partly because, as ill luck
would have it, the old woman was deaf, almost everything he said had escaped her
except for the ‘Go and tell’, which she misheard as ‘in the well’. She smiled at him
reassuringly.
‘Let her jump in the well then, young master. Don’t you worry your pretty head
about it!’
Realizing that he had deafness, too, to contend with, he now became quite frantic.
‘GO AND TELL MY PAGES.’
‘Her wages?’ the old woman asked in some surprise. ‘Bless you, of course they paid
her wages! Her Ladyship gave a whole lot of money towards the funeral as well. And
clothes. Paid her wages, indeed!’
Bao-yu stamped his feet in a frenzy of impatience. He was still wondering
despairingly how to make her understand when Jia Zheng’s pages arrived and forced
him to go with them to the study.
Jia Zheng turned a pair of wild and bloodshot eyes on him as he entered. Forgetting
the ‘riotous and dissipated conduct abroad leading to the unseemly bestowal of
impudicities on a theatrical performer’ and the ‘neglect of proper pursuits and
studies at home culminating in the attempted violation of a parent’s maidservant’
and all the other high-sounding charges he had been preparing to hurl against him,
he shouted two brief orders to the pages.
‘Gag his mouth. Beat him to death.’
The pages were too frightened not to comply. Two held Bao-yu face downwards on a
bench while a third lifted up the flattened bamboo sweep and began to strike him
with it across the hams. After about a dozen blows Jia Zheng, not satisfied that his
executioner was hitting hard enough, kicked him impatiently aside, wrested the
bamboo from his grasp, and, gritting his teeth, brought it down with the utmost
savagery on the places that had already been beaten.
At this point the literary gentlemen, sensing that Bao-yu was in serious danger of life
and limb, came in again to remonstrate; but Jia Zheng refused to hear them.
‘Ask him what he has done and then tell me if you think I should spare him,’ he said.
‘It is the encouragement of people like you that has corrupted him; and now, when
things have come to this pass, you intercede for him. I suppose you would like me to
wait until he commits parricide, or worse. Would you still intercede for him then?’
They could see from this reply that he was beside himself. Wasting no further time
on words, they quickly withdrew and looked for someone to take a message through
inside.
Lady Wang did not stop to tell Grandmother Jia when she received it. She snatched
up an outer garment, pulled it about her, and, supported by a single maid, rushed off,
not caring what menfolk might see her, to the outer study, bursting into it with such
suddenness that the literary gentlemen and other males present were unable to
avoid her.
Her entry provoked Jia Zheng to fresh transports of fury. Faster and harder fell the
bamboo on the prostrate form of Bao-yu, which by now appeared to be unconscious,
for when the boys holding it down relaxed their hold and fled from their Mistress’s
presence, it had long since ceased even to twitch. Even so Jia Zheng would have
continued beating it had not Lady Wang clasped the bamboo to her bosom and
prevented him.
‘Enough!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Today you are determined, all of you, to drive me insane.’
‘No doubt Bao-yu deserved to be beaten,’ said Lady Wang tearfully, ‘but it is bad for
you to get over excited. Besides, you ought to have some consideration for Lady Jia.
She is not at all well in this frightful heat. It may not seem to you of much
consequence to kill Bao-yu, but think what the effect would be on her.’
‘Don’t try that sort of talk with me!’ said Jia Zheng bitterly. ‘Merely by fathering a
monster like this I have proved myself an unfilial son; yet whenever in the past I have
tried to disci?pline him, the rest of you have all conspired against me to protect him.
Now that I have the opportunity at last, I may as well finish off what I have begun and
put him down, like the vermin he is, before he can do any more damage.’
So saying, he took up a rope and would have put his threat into execution, had not
Lady Wang held her arms around him to prevent it.
‘Of course you should discipline your son,’ she said, weep?ing, ‘but you have a wife
too, Sir Zheng, don’t forget. I am nearly fifty now and this wretched boy is the only
son I have. If you insist on making an example of him, I dare not do much to dissuade
you. But to kill him outright that is deliberately to make me childless. Better strangle
me first, if you are going to strangle him. Let the two of us die together. At least I
shall have some support then in the world to come, if all support in this world is to
be denied me!’
With these words she threw herself upon Bao-yu’s body and, lifting up her voice,
began weeping with noisy abandon. Jia Zheng, who had heard her with a sigh, sank
into a chair and himself broke down in a fit of weeping.
Presently Lady Wang began to examine the body she was clasping. Bao-yu’s face was
ashen, his breathing was scarcely perceptible, and the trousers of thin green silk
which clothed the lower part of his body were so soaked with blood that their colour
was no longer recognizable. Feverishly she un?fastened his waistband and drew
them back. Everywhere, from the upper part of his buttocks down to his calves, was
either raw and bloody or purplish black with bruises. Not an inch of sound flesh was
to be seen. The sight made her cry out involuntarily.
‘Oh my son! My unfortunate son!’
Once more she broke down into uncontrollable weeping.
Her own words reminded her of the son she had already lost, and now, with added
bitterness, she began to call out his name.
‘Oh, Zhu! Zhu! If only you had lived, I shouldn’t have minded losing a hundred other
sons!’
By this time news of Lady Wang’s démarche had circulated to the other members of
the inner mansion and Li Wan, Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had come to
join her. The invocation of her dead husband’s name, painful to all of them, was
altogether too much for Li Wan, who broke into loud sobs on hearing it. Jia Zheng
himself was deeply affected, and tears as round as pumpkins rolled down both his
cheeks. It was beginning to look as if they might all go on weeping there indefinitely,
since no one would make a move; but just then there was a cry of ‘Her Old
Ladyship—!’ from one of the maids, interrupted by a quavering voice outside the
window.
‘Kill me first! You may as well kill both of us while you are about it!’
As much distressed by his mother’s words as he was alarmed by her arrival, Jia Zheng
hurried out to meet her. She was leaning on the shoulder of a little maid, her old
head swaying from side to side with the effort of running, and pant?ing as she ran.
Jia Zheng bowed down before her and his face assumed the semblance of a smile.
‘Surely, Mother, in such hot weather as this there is no need for you to come here?
If you have any instructions, you should call for me and let me come to you.’
Grandmother Jia had stopped when she heard this voice and now stood panting for
some moments while she regained her breath. When she spoke, her voice had an
unnatural shrillness in it.
‘Oh! Are you speaking to me? — Yes, as a matter of fact I have got instructions”, as
you put it; but as unfortunately I’ve never had a good son who cares for me, there’s
no one I can give them to.’
Wounded in his most sensitive spot, Jia Zheng fell on his knees before her. The voice
in which he replied to her was broken with tears.
‘How can I bear it, Mother, if you speak to me like that? What I did to the boy I did
for the honour of the family.’
Grandmother Jia spat contemptuously.
‘A single harsh word from me and you start whining that you can’t bear it. How do
you think Bao-yu could bear your cruel rod? And you say you’ve been punishing him
for the honour of the family, but you just tell me this: did your own father ever
punish yon in such a way? I think not.’
She was weeping now herself.
‘Don’t upset yourself, Mother,’ said Jia Zheng, with the same forced smile. ‘I acted
too hastily. From now on I’ll never beat him again, if that’s what you wish.’
‘Hoity-toity, keep your temper!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘He’s your son. If you want
to beat him, that’s up to you. If we women are in your way, we’ll leave you alone to
get on with it.’ She turned to her attendants. ‘Call my carriage. Your Mistress and I
and Bao-yu are going back to Nanking. We shall be leaving immediately.’
The servants made a show of compliance.
‘No need for you to cry,’ she said, turning to Lady Wang. ‘You love Bao-yu now that
he’s young, but when he’s grown up and become an important official, he’ll like
enough forget that you’re his mother. Much better force yourself not to love him
now and save yourself some anguish later on.’
Jia Zheng threw himself forward on his face.
‘Don’t say that, Mother! Don’t reject your own son!’
‘On the contrary,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘it is you who have rejected me’. But don’t
worry. When I have gone back to Nanking, there will be no one here to stop you. You
can beat away to your heart’s content.’ She turned to the servants.
‘Come on, hurry up with that packing! And get the carriage and horses ready so
that we can be on our way.’
Jia Zheng’s kotows were by now describing the whole quarter circle from
perpendicular to ground. But the old lady walked on inside, ignoring him.
From the sight that met her eyes she could tell that this had been no ordinary
beating. It filled her with anguish for the sufferer and fresh anger for the man who
had inflicted it, and for a long time she clung to the inert form and wept, only
gradually calming down under the combined coaxing of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Li
Wan.
At this point several of the maids and women servants came forward and attempted
to raise Bao-yu to his feet.
‘Idiots!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Haven’t you got eyes in your heads? Can’t you see that he’s in
no fit state to walk? Go and get that wicker summer-bed from inside and carry him in
on that.’
The servants rushed out and presently reappeared carrying a long, narrow couch of
woven rattan between them, on to which they lifted Bao-yu. Then, with
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest of the womenfolk leading the way, they
carried him to Grandmother Jia’s apartment and set him down inside it.
Jia Zheng, conscious that his mother’s wrath against him had not abated and
unwilling to leave things where they stood, had followed the little procession inside.
His eyes travelled from Bao-yu, who, he now saw, really had been beaten very badly,
to Lady Wang. She was sobbing bitterly, interspersing her sobs with cries of ‘My
child!’ and ‘My son!’. Presently she broke off and began railing at the object of her
sorrow: ‘Why couldn’t you have died instead of Zhu? Zhu wouldn’t have made his
father angry the way you do and I should have been spared this constant anxiety.
What is to become of me if you go away and leave me, too?’ Then, with a cry of ‘Poor,
worthless boy!’, she fell once more to weeping. When Jia Zheng heard this, his own
heart was softened and he began to wish that he had not beaten the boy quite so
savagely. He tried to find words of comfort for his old mother, but she answered him
tearfully.
‘A father ought to punish his son if he’s done wrong, but not like that! — Why don’t
you go now? Won’t you be content until you’ve seen the boy die under your own
eyes?’
Jia Zheng, with flustered deference, withdrew.
By now Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and Shi Xiang-yun were there too. Aroma
was deeply distressed, but could not show the extent of her feelings in the presence
of so many others. Indeed, Bao-yu was so ringed around with people fanning him or
forcing water through his lips that there was nothing she could have done for him if
she had tried. Feeling somewhat superfluous, she left the apartment and went out to
the inner gate, where she asked the pages to look for Tealeaf, so that she could find
out what had hap?pened.
‘Why did the Master suddenly beat him like that?’ she asked Tealeaf when he
arrived. ‘He hadn’t been doing any?thing. And why couldn’t you have warned us in
time?’
Tealeaf was indignant.
‘I couldn’t help it, I wasn’t there. He was half-way through beating him before I
even got to hear about it. I did my best to find out the reason, though. It seems that
there were two things the Master was upset about: one was to do with Bijou and the
other was to do with Golden.’
‘How did the Master get to know about them?’ said Aroma. ‘Well, the Bijou
business he probably knew about indirectly through Mr Xue,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Mr Xue
had been feeling very jealous, and it looks as though he may have put someone else
up to telling the Master about it out of spite. And Golden he probably heard about
from Master Huan - leastways, that’s what the Master’s own people told me.’
The two reasons Tealeaf had given corresponded well enough with Aroma’s own
observations, and she was more than half inclined to believe them. Fairly confident,
therefore, that she now knew the cause of what had happened, she re?turned once
more to the apartment. The ministrations of those surrounding Bao-yu had by now
restored him to fall consciousness, and Grandmother Jia was instructing the
ser?vants to carry him back to his own room. There was an answering cry and
something of a scramble as many willing hands lifted up the cane bed. Then,
preceded as before by Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest, they carried him
through into the Garden and back to Green Delights, where they finally got him on to
his own bed. After a good deal more bustle they gradually all drifted away and Aroma
at last had Bao-yu alone to herself.
But in order to know what happened then, you must refer to the following chapter.
CHAPTER 34

A wordless message meets with silent understanding
And a groundless imputation leads to undeserved rebukes



WHEN she saw that Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest had all gone, Aroma
went and sat down at Bao-yu’s bed?side and asked him, with tears in her eyes, the
reason why he had been beaten so severely.
Bao-yu sighed.
‘Oh, the usual things. Need you ask? I wish you’d take a look down below, though,
and tell me if anything’s broken. It’s hurting so dreadfully down there.’
Very gently Aroma inserted her fingers into the top of his trousers and began to draw
them off. She had barely started when he gritted his teeth and let out a cry, and she
had to stop immediately. This happened three or four times before she finally
succeeded in getting them off. The sight revealed made her grit her own teeth.
‘Mother of mine!’ she gasped, ‘he must have hit you savagely. If only you’d listened
to me a bit in the past, it would never have come to this. Why, you might have been
crippled for life. It doesn’t bear thinking of.’
Just then Bad-chai’s arrival was announced by one of the maids. Since putting his
trousers on again was out of the question, Aroma snatched up a lightweight coverlet
and hur?riedly threw it over him. Bao-chai came in carrying a large tablet of some
sort of solid medicine which she instructed Aroma to pound up in wine and apply to
Bao-yu’s injuries in the evening.
‘This is a decongestant,’ she said, handing it to her. ‘It will take away the
inflammation by dispersing the bad blood in his bruises. After that, he should heal
quite quickly.’
She turned to Bao-yu.
‘Are you feeling any better now?’
Bao-yu thanked her. Yes, he said, he was feeling a little better, and invited her to sit
down beside him. Bao-chai was relieved to see him with his eyes open and talking
again. She shook her head sadly.
‘If you had listened to what one said, this would never have happened. Everyone is
so upset now. It isn’t only Grandmother and Lady Wang, you know. Even—’
She checked herself abruptly, regretting that she had allowed her feelings to run
away with her, and lowered her head, blushing. Bao-yu had sensed hidden depths of
feeling in the passionate earnestness of her tone, and when she suddenly faltered
and turned red, there was something so touching about the pretty air of confusion
with which she dropped her head and played with the ends of her girdle, that his
spirits soared and his pain was momentarily forgotten.
‘What have I undergone but a few whacks of the bamboo?’ he thought, ‘—yet
already they are so sad and concerned about me! What dear, adorable, sweet, noble
girls they are! Heaven knows how they would grieve for me if I were actually to die! It
would be almost worth dying, just to find out. The loss of a life’s ambitions would be
a small price to pay, and I should be a peevish, ungrateful ghost if I did not feel proud
and happy when such darling creatures were grieving for me.’
He was roused from this reverie by the sound of Bao-chai’s voice asking Aroma what
it was that had moved his father to such violent anger against him. Aroma’s low reply,
in which she merely repeated what Tealeaf had told her, was his first inkling of the
part that Jia Huan had played in his misfortune. Her mention of Xue Pan’s
involvement, however, made him apprehensive that Bao-chai might feel embarrassed,
and he hastily interrupted Aroma to prevent her from saying more.
Old Xue would never do a thing like that,’ he said. ‘It’s silly to make these wild
assertions.’
Bao-chai knew that it was out of respect for her feelings that he was silencing Aroma,
and she wondered at his considerateness.
‘What delicacy of feeling!’ she thought, ‘after so terrible a beating and in spite of all
the pain, to be still able to worry about the possibility of someone else’s being
offended! If only you could apply some of that thoughtfulness to the more important
things of life, my friend, you would make my Uncle so happy; and then perhaps these
awful things would never happen. And when all’s said and done, this sensibility on
my behalf is rather wasted. Do you really think I know my own brother so little that I
am unaware of his unruly nature? Nothing has ever been allowed to stand in the way
of Pan’s desires. Look at the terrible trouble he made for you that time over Qin
Zhong. That was a long time ago, and I am sure he has got much worse since then.’
Those were her thoughts, but what she said was:
‘There’s really no need to look around for someone to blame. If you ask me, the
mere fact that Cousin Bao has been willing to keep such company was in itself quite
enough to make Uncle angry. And though my brother can be very tactless and may
well have let something out about Cousin Bao in the course of conversation, I’m sure
it wouldn’t have been deliberate trouble-making on his part. In the first place, it is,
after all, true, what he is supposed to have said: Cousin Bao has been going around
with that actor. And in the second place, my brother simply hasn’t got it in him to be
discreet. You have lived all your life with sensitive, considerate people like Cousin Bao,
my dear Aroma. You have never had to deal with a crude, forthright person like my
brother someone who says whatever comes into his head with complete dis?regard
for the consequences.’
When Bao-yu cut short her remarks about Xue Pan, Aroma had realized at once that
she was being tactless and inwardly prayed that Bao-chai had not taken exception to
them. To her, therefore, these words of Bao-chai’s were a source of tongue-tied
embarrassment. Bao-yu, on the other hand, could see in them only the refusal of a
frank and generous nature to admit deviousness in others and a sensibility capable of
matching and responding to his own. As a consequence his spirits soared yet higher.
He was about to say something, but Bao-chai rose to her feet and anticipated him.
‘I’ll come and see you again tomorrow. You must rest now and give yourself a
chance to get well. I’ve given Aroma something to make a lotion with. Get her to put
it on for you in the evening. I can guarantee that it will hasten your re?covery.’
She was moving towards the door as she said this. When she was outside, Aroma
hurried after her to see her off and to thank her for her trouble.
‘As soon as he’s better,’ she said, ‘Master Bao will come over and thank you himself,
Miss.’
‘It’s nothing at all,’ said Bao-chai, turning back to her with a smile. ‘Do tell him to
rest properly, though, and not to brood. And if there’s anything at all he wants, just
quietly come round to my place for it. Don’t go bothering Lady Jia or Lady Wang or
any of the others, in case my uncle gets to hear of it. It probably wouldn’t matter at
the time, but it might do later on, next time there is any trouble.’
With that she left, and Aroma turned back into the court?yard, her heart full of
gratitude for Bao-chai’s kindness. Re?entering Bao-yu’s room, she found him lying
back quietly, plunged in thought. From the look of it, he was already half asleep.
Tiptoeing out again, she went off to wash her hair.
But it was difficult for Bao-yu to lie quietly for very long. The pain in his buttocks was
like the stabbing and pricking of knives and needles and there was a burning
sensation in them as if he were being grilled over a fire, so that the slightest
movement made him cry out. Already it was growing late. Aroma appeared to have
gone away, but two or three maids were still in attendance. As there was nothing
that they could do for him, he told them that they might go off and prepare
themselves for the night, provided that they remained within call. The maids
accordingly withdrew, leaving him on his own.
He had dozed off. The shadowy form of Jiang Yu-han had come in to tell him of his
capture by the Prince of Zhong?-shun’s men, followed, shortly after, by Golden, who
gave him a tearful account of how she had drowned herself. In his half? dream,
half-awake state he was having the greatest difficulty in attending to what they were
saying, when suddenly he felt someone pushing him and became dimly aware of a
sound of weeping in his ear. He gave a start. Fully awake now, he opened his eyes. It
was Lin Dai-yu. Suspecting this, too, to be a dream, he raised his head to look. A pair
of eyes swollen like peaches met his own, and a face that was glistening with tears. It
was Dai-yu all right, no doubt about that. He would have looked longer, but the strain
of raising himself was causing such excruciating pain in his nether parts, that he fell
back again with a groan. The groan was followed by a sigh.
‘Now what have you come for?’ he said. ‘The sun’s not long set and the ground
must still be very hot underfoot. You could still get a heat-stroke at this time of day,
and that would he a fine how-do-you-do. Actually, in spite of the beating, I don’t feel
very much pain. This fuss I make is put on to fool the others. I’m hoping they’ll
spread the word around outside how badly I’ve been hurt, so that Father gets to hear
of it. It’s all shamming, really. You mustn’t be taken in by it.’
Dai-yu’s sobbing had by this time ceased to be audible; but somehow her strangled,
silent weeping was infinitely more pathetic than the most clamorous grief. At that
moment volumes would have been inadequate to contain the things she wanted to
say to him; yet all she could get out, after struggling for some time with her choking
sobs, was
‘I suppose you’ll change now.’
Bao-yu gave a long sigh.
‘Don’t worry, I shan’t change. People like that are worth dying for. I wouldn’t
change if he killed me.’
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when they heard someone outside in the
courtyard saying:
‘Mrs Lian has come.’
Dai-yu had no wish to see Xi-feng, and rose to her feet hurriedly.
Bao-yu seized hold of her hand.
‘Now that’s funny. Why should you start being afraid of her all of a sudden?’
She stamped with impatience.
‘Look at the state my eyes are in I’ she said. ‘I don’t want them all making fun of me
again.’
At that Bao-yu released her hand and she bounded round to the back of the bed,
slipping into the rear courtyard just as Xi-feng was entering the room from the front.
‘A bit better now?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is there anything you feel like eating yet? If there is,
tell them to come round to my place and get it.’
As soon as Xi-feng had gone, Bao-yu was visited by Aunt Xue, and shortly after that
by someone whom his grandmother had sent to see how he was getting on. At
lighting-up time, after taking a few mouthfuls of soup, he settled down into a fitful
sleep.
Just then a new group of visitors arrived, consisting of Zhou Rui’s wife, Wu Xin-deng’s
wife, Zheng Hao-shi’s wife, and those other members of the mansion’s female staff
who had had most to do with Bao-yu in the past and who, having heard of his beating,
were anxious to see how he was. Aroma came out smiling on to the verandah to
welcome them.
‘You’re just too late to see him, ladies,’ she told them in a low voice. ‘He’s just this
minute dropped off.’
She ushered them into the Outer room, invited them to be seated, and served them
with tea. After sitting there very quietly for several minutes, they got up to take their
leave, requesting Aroma as they did so that she would inform Bao-yu when he waked
that they had been round to ask about him. Aroma promised to do so and showed
them out. Just as she was about to go in again, an old woman arrived from Lady
Wang’s to say that ‘Her Ladyship would like to see one of Master Bao’s people.’ After
reflecting for a moment, Aroma turned to the house and called softly to Skybright,
Musk and Ripple inside.
‘Her Ladyship wants to see someone, so I’m going over. Stay indoors and keep an
eye on things while I’m away. I shan’t be long.’
Then she followed the old woman out of the Garden and round to Lady Wang’s
apartment in the central courtyard. She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane
summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely
pleased when she saw that it was Aroma.
‘You could have sent one of the others,’ she said. ‘There was no need for you to
come and leave him unattended.’
Aroma smiled reassuringly.
‘Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want
anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own.
Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send
one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was
afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted.’
‘I have nothing in particular to tell you,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I merely wanted to ask
about my son. How is the pain now?’
‘Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him,’ said
Aroma. ‘It was so bad before that he couldn’t lie still, but now he’s sleeping quite
soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was.’
‘Has he had anything to eat yet?’ said Lady Wang.
‘He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent,’ said Aroma, ‘but that’s all
he would take. He kept complain?ing that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum
bitters to drink, but of course that’s an astringent, and I thought to myself that as he’
d just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and
hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and
if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious
illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose
syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him; but after only half a cup of it he said it
tasted sickly and he couldn’t get it down.’
‘Oh dear, I wish you’d told me sooner,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We were sent some bottles
of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was
going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably
only get wasted, so I didn’t. If he can’t manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a
few of them to take back with you. You need only mix a teaspoonful of essence in a
cupful of water. The flavours are quite delicious.’ She called Suncloud to her. ‘Fetch
me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day.’
‘Two will be enough,’ said Aroma, ‘otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run out, I
can always come back for more later.’
Suncloud was gone for a considerable time. Eventually she returned with two little
glass bottles, each about three inches high, which she handed to Aroma. They had
screw on silver tops and yellow labels. One of them was labelled ‘Essence of Cassia
Flower’ and the other one ‘Essence of Roses’.
‘What tiny little bottles!’ said Aroma. ‘They can’t hold very much. I suppose the
stuff inside them must be very precious.’
‘It was made specially for the Emperor,’ said Lady Wang. ‘That’s what the yellow
labels mean. Haven’t you seen labels like that before? Mind you look after them and
don’t let the stuff in them get wasted.’
Aroma promised to be careful and began to go.
‘Just a minute!’ said Lady Wang. ‘I’ve thought of some-thing else that I wanted to
ask you.’
Aroma returned. Lady Wang first glanced about her to make sure that no one else
was in the room, then she said:
‘I think I heard someone say that Bao-yu’s beating today was because of something
that Huan had said to Sir Zheng. I suppose you don’t happen to have heard anything
about that?’
‘No. I haven’t heard anything about that,’ said Aroma. ‘What I heard was that it was
because Master Bao had been going around with one of Prince Somebody or other’s
players and the Master was told about it by someone who called.’
Lady Wang nodded her head mysteriously.
‘Yes, that was one of the reasons. But there was another reason as well.’
‘I really know nothing about any other reason, Your Lady?ship,’ said Aroma. She
dropped her head and hesitated a moment before going on. ‘I wonder if I might be
rather bold and say something very outspoken to Your Ladyship? Really and truly ’
She faltered.
‘Please go on.’
‘I will if Your Ladyship will promise not to he angry with me.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Just tell me what you have to say.’
‘Well, really and truly,’ said Aroma, ‘Master Bao needed punishing. If the Master
didn’t keep an eye on him, there’s no knowing what he mightn’t get up to.’
‘My child,’ said Lady Wang with a warmth rarely seen in her, ‘those are exactly my
own sentiments. How clever of you to have understood! Of course, I know perfectly
well that Bao-yu is in need of discipline; and anyone who saw how strict I used to be
with Mr Zhu would realize that I am capable of exercising it. But I have my reasons. A
woman of fifty cannot expect to bear any more children and Bao-yu is now the only
son I have. He is not a very strong boy; and his Grannie dotes on him. I daren’t risk
being strict. I daren’t risk losing another son. I daren’t risk angering Her Old Ladyship
and upsetting the whole household. I do once in a while have it out with him but
though I have argued and pleaded and wept, it doesn’t do any good. He seems all
right at the time, but he’ll be just the same again a short while afterwards and I
always know that I have failed to reach him. Jam afraid he has to suffer before he can
learn but suppose it’s too much for him? - suppose he doesn’t get over this beating?
What will become of me?’
She began to cry.
Seeing her mistress so distressed, Aroma herself was affected and began to cry too.
‘I can understand Your Ladyship being so upset,’ she said, ‘when he’s your own son.
Even we servants that have been with him for a few years get worried about him. The
most that we can ever hope for is to do our duty and get by without too much
trouble but even that won’t be possible if he goes on the way he has been doing. I’m
always telling him to change his ways. Every day every hour I tell him. But it’s no use;
he won’t listen. Of course, if these people will make so much fuss of him, you can
hardly blame him for going round with them though it does make our job more
difficult. But now that Your Ladyship has spoken like this, it puts me in mind of
something that’s been worrying me which I should like to have asked Your Ladyship’s
advice about, only I was afraid you might take it amiss, and then not only should I
have spoken to no purpose, but I should leave myself without even a grave to lie in...’
It was evident to Lady Wang that what she was struggling to get out was a matter of
some consequence.
‘What is it you want to tell me, my child?’ she said kindly. ‘I’ve heard a lot of people
praising you recently, and I confess that I assumed it must be because you took
special pains in serving Bao-yu or in making yourself agreeable to other people —
little things of that sort. But I see that I was wrong. These are not at all little things
that you have been talking about. What you have said so far makes very good sense
and entirely accords with my own opinion of the matter. So if you have anything to
tell me, I should like to hear it. But I must ask you not to discuss it with anyone else.’
‘All I really wanted to ask,’ said Aroma, ‘was if Your Lady?ship could advise me how
later on we can somehow or other contrive to get Master Bao moved back outside
the Garden,’
Lady Wang looked startled and clutched Aroma’s hand in some alarm.
‘I hope Bao-yu hasn’t been doing something dreadful with one of the girls?’
‘Oh no, Your Ladyship, please don’t suspect that!’ said Aroma hurriedly. ‘That
wasn’t my meaning at all. It’s just that—if you’ll allow me to say so—Master Bao and
the young ladies are beginning to grow up now, and though they are all cousins,
there is the difference of sex between them, which makes it very awkward
sometimes when they are all living together, especially in the case of Miss Lin and
Miss Bao, who aren’t even of the same clan. One can’t help feeling uneasy. Even to
outsiders it looks like a very strange sort of family. They say “where nothing happens,
imagination is busiest”, and I’m sure lots of unaccountable misfortunes begin when
some innocent little thing we did unthinkingly gets mis?construed in someone else’s
imagination and reported as something terrible. We just have to be on our guard
against that sort of thing happening especially when Master Bao has such a peculiar
character, as Your Ladyship knows, and spends all his time with girls. He only has to
make the tiniest slip in an unguarded moment, and whether he really did anything or
not, with so many people about and some of them no better than they should be
there is sure to be scandal. For you know what some of these people are like, Your
Ladyship. If they feel well-disposed towards you, they’ll make you out to be a saint;
but if they’re not, then Heaven help you! If Master Bao lives to be spoken well of’ we
can count ourselves lucky; but the way things are, it only needs someone to breathe
a word of scandal and - I say nothing of what will happen to us servants—it’s of no
consequence if we’re all chopped up for mincemeat—but what’s more important,
Master Bao’s reputa?tion will be destroyed for life and all the care and worry Your
Ladyship and Sir Zheng have had on his account will have been wasted. I know Your
Ladyship is very busy and can’t be expected to think of everything, and I probably
shouldn’t have thought of this myself, but once I had thought of it, it seemed to me
that it would be wrong of me not to tell Your Ladyship, and it’s been preying on my
mind ever since. The only reason I haven’t mentioned it before is because I was
afraid Your Ladyship might be angry with me.’
What Aroma had just been saying about misconstructions and scandals so exactly
fitted what had in fact happened in the case of Golden that for a moment Lady Wang
was quite taken aback. But on reflection she felt nothing but love and gratitude for
this humble servant-girl who had shown so much solici?tude on her behalf.
‘It is very perceptive of you, my dear, to have thought it all out so carefully,’ she said.
‘I have, of course, thought about this matter myself’ but other things have put it from
my mind, and what you have just said has reminded me. It is most thoughtful of you.
You are a very, very good girl — Well, you may go now. I think I now know what to do.
There is just one thing before you go, though. Now that you have spoken to me like
this, I am going to place Bao-yu entirely in your hands. Be very careful with him,
won’t you? Remember that anything you do for him you will be doing also for me.
You will find that I am not ungrateful.’
Aroma stood for a moment with bowed head, weighing the import of these words.
Then she said:
‘I will do what Your Ladyship has asked me to the utmost of my ability.’
She left the apartment slowly and made her way back to Green Delights, pondering
-as she went. When she arrived, Bao-yu had just woken up, so she told him about the
flavourings. He was pleased and made her mix some for him straight away. It was
quite delicious. He kept thinking about Dai-yu and wanted to send someone over to
see her, but he was afraid that Aroma would disapprove, so, as a means of getting
her out of the way, he sent her over to Bao-chai’s place to borrow a book. As soon as
she had gone, he summoned Skybright.
‘I want you to go to Miss Lin’s for me,’ he said. ‘Just see what she’s doing, and if she
asks about me, tell her I’m all right.’
‘I can’t go rushing in there bald-headed without a reason,’ said Skybright. ‘You’d
better give me some kind of a message, just to give me an excuse for going there.’
‘I have none to give,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Well, give me something to take, then,’ said Skybright, ‘or think of something I can
ask her for. Otherwise it will look so silly.’
Bao-yu thought for a bit and then, reaching out and picking up two of his old
handkerchiefs, he tossed them towards her with a smile.
‘All right. Tell her I said you were to give her these.’
‘That’s an odd sort of present!’ said Skybright. ‘What’s she going to do with a pair
of your old handkerchiefs? Most likely she’ll think you’re making fun of her and get
upset again.’
‘No she won’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’ll understand.’
Skybright deemed it pointless to argue, so she picked up the handkerchiefs and went
off to the Naiad’s House. Little Deli?cate, who was hanging some towels out to dry on
the verandah railings, saw her enter the courtyard and attempted to wave her away.
‘She’s gone to bed.’
Skybright ignored her and went on inside. The lamps had not been lit and the room
was in almost total darkness. The voice of Dai-yu, lying awake in bed, spoke to her
out of the shadows.
‘Who is it?’
‘Skybright.’
‘What do you want?’
‘Master Bao has sent me with some handkerchiefs, Miss?
Dai-yu seemed to hesitate. She found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it
could mean.
‘I suppose they must be very good ones,’ she said. ‘Prob?ably someone gave them
to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for
them just now myself.’
Skybright laughed.
‘They’re not new ones, Miss. They’re two of his did, everyday ones.’
This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then
suddenly, in a flash, she understood.
‘Put them down. You may go now.’
Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she
tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her.
Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of
conflicting emotions.
‘I feel so happy,’ she thought, ‘that in the midst of his own affliction he has been
able to grasp the cause of all my trouble.
‘And yet at the same time I am sad,’ she thought; ‘because how do I know that my
trouble will end in the way I want it to?
‘Actually, I feel rather amused,’ she thought. ‘Fancy his sending a pair of old
handkerchiefs like that! Suppose I hadn’t understood what he was getting at?
‘But I feel alarmed that he should be sending presents to me in secret.
‘Oh, and I feel so ashamed when I think how I am forever crying and quarrelling,’
she thought, ‘and all the time he has understood! …’
And her thoughts carried her this way and that, until the ferment of excitement
within her cried out to be expressed. Careless of what the maids might think, she
called for a lamp, sat herself down at her desk, ground some ink, softened her brush,
and proceeded to compose the following quatrains, using the handkerchiefs
themselves to write on:

1
                  Seeing my idle teats, you ask me why
                  These foolish drops fall from my teeming eye:
                  Then know, your gift, being by the merfolk made,
                  In merman’s currency must be repaid.

2
                  Jewelled drops by day in secret sorrow shed
                  Or, in the night-time, in my wakeful bed,
                  Lest sleeve or pillow they should spot or stain,
                       Shall on these gifts shower down their salty rain.

3
                 Yet silk preserves but ill the Naiad’s tears:
                       Each salty trace of them fast disappears.
             Only the speckled bamboo stems that grow
                 Outside the window still her tear marks show.

She had only half-filled the second handkerchief and was pre?paring to write another
quatrain, when she became aware that her whole body was burning hot all over and
her cheeks were afire. Going over to the dressing table, she removed the brocade
cover from the mirror and peered into it.
‘Hmn! “Brighter than the peach-flower’s hue”,’ she mur?mured complacently to the
flushed face that stared out at her from the glass, and, little imagining that what she
had been witnessing was the first symptom of a serious illness, went back to bed, her
mind full of handkerchiefs.
*

From Dai-yu and her handkerchiefs let us return to Aroma, who, it will be
remembered, bad been sent off to Bao-chai’s for a book. When she got there, she
found that Bao-chai was not in the Garden, having gone round to her mother’s place
outside. Not liking to return empty-handed, she waited for Bao-chai to return. It was
already the beginning of the first watch when she did so.
Knowing her brother as she did, Bao-chai had already, even before hearing anything
to that effect, suspected that he was in some way responsible for Bao-yu’s
misfortune. What Aroma had earlier on told her had therefore been no more than
con?firmation of an already existing suspicion. Yet Aroma had only been echoing
what Tealeaf had told her; and what Tealeaf had told her was pure guesswork
without a shred of evidence to support it. Thus what started in everyone’s mind as a
sus?picion, repetition very soon compounded into a certainty. Yet the ironical fact
was that he who by his past behaviour had so richly merited the reputation which
had caused them to sus?pect him was totally innocent on the one occasion when
every?one was most unshakeably convinced of his guilt.
The object of this misunderstanding had on this particular evening returned home
having had a good deal to drink out?side. He greeted his mother and then, observing
that his sister, too, was sitting there, addressed a few desultory remarks to her.
Suddenly he seemed to remember something.
‘I hear young Bao-yu’s been in trouble,’ he said. ‘What was it about?’
This was too much for Aunt Xue, who had been seething inwardly and now broke out
in a fury.
‘Shameless villain! How can you have the face to ask such a question? You know
very well it was all your doing?
Xue Pan stared at her in astonishment.
‘What do you mean, “all my doing”?’
‘Don’t act the injured innocent with me!’ said his mother. ‘Everyone knows it was
you who told.’
‘Oh, and I suppose if everyone said I’d killed somebody, you’d believe that too!’
‘Even your sister knows it was you. I suppose you’re not going to call her a liar?’
Bao-chai hurriedly intervened.
‘Don’t shout so, both of you! If you’d be a bit more -calm and collected, you might
have some chance of getting at the truth.’ She turned to Xue Pan: ‘Anyway, whether it
was you or wasn’t you, the damage is done now. There doesn’t seem much point in
raking it over or making an issue of it. My advice to you is to keep out of mischief
from now on and stop interfering in other people’s affairs. When you spend day after
day fooling around outside, sooner or later something is bound to happen; and you
are such a thoughtless creature, that when it does, people naturally suspect that you
are the one to blame, even if you aren’t. I know I do!’
Xue Pan, for all his faults, was a forthright, outspoken sort of fellow, unused to such
ostrich-like avoidance of the issue. Bao-chai’s strictures about ‘fooling around’ and
his mother’s insistence that he had brought about Bao-yu’s beating by means of a
deliberate indiscretion had exasperated him beyond endurance. He jumped about
excitedly, protesting with the most solemn and desperate oaths that he was
innocent.
‘I’d like to find the comedian who’s been making up these stories about me,’ he
shouted, turning in anger upon the domestics. ‘I’ll smash his rotten face in if I do. Of
course, I know what this is all about: you all want to show how con?cerned you are
for poor, darling Bao-yu, so you’ve decided to do it at my expense. What is he,
anyway? a Deva King? Every time his dad gives him a few whacks on the bum, the
whole household is in a state of uproar about it for days on end. I remember that
time Uncle Zheng beat him for doing something he shouldn’t have and old Lady Jia
decided that Cousin Zhen was at the bottom of it. She had the poor so-and-so hauled
up in front of her and there was hell to pay. Now, this time, you want to drag me into
it. All right then I don’t care. A life for a life. I’ll go in there and kill the little blighter
then you can all do what you like to me.’
In the midst of this bawling he had picked up a door bar and was evidently going off
to execute his threat; but his dis?traught mother clung to him and prevented him
from going.
‘You stupid creature!’ she said. ‘Who do you think you’re going to hit with that? If
you’re going to hit anyone, you’d better begin with me!’
Xue Pan’s exasperation had now reached such a pitch that his eyes stood out in his
head like a pair of copper bells.
‘This is rich!’ he shouted. ‘You won’t let me go and finish him off, yet you won’t
stop provoking me by making up all these lies. Every day that fellow stays alive means
one more day of nagging and lies for me to put up with. We’d much better die, the
pair of us, and make an end of it!’
‘Have a little self-control!’ said Bao-chai, joining in her mother’s efforts to restrain
him. ‘Can’t you see how upset poor Mamma is? You ought to be trying to calm her,
not making things worse with this uproar.’
‘Oh yes! you can say that now,’ said Xue Pan, ‘but it was you who started all this by
telling her about me, wasn’t it?’
‘It’s all very well to blame me for telling Mamma,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Why don’t you
blame yourself for being so careless, you great blabber-mouth ?’
‘Me careless?’ said Xue Pan. ‘What about the way Bao-yu stirs up trouble for
himself then? Let me just give you an example. Let me tell you what happened
between him and Bijou the other day. I’d met Bijou ten times, near enough, and
never had so much as a kind word out of him, yet Bao-yu, that didn’t even know him
by sight, meets him for the first time the other day, and before you know where you
are, he’s given him his sash! I hope you’re not going to say that that got about
because of me?’
His mother and sister were indignant.
‘That’s a fine example, isn’t it? It’s precisely because of that that he was beaten.
Now we know it must have been you who told.’
‘This is enough to drive a fellow mad!’ said Xue Pan, ‘It’s not so much the lies you
keep telling about me. What really gets my goat is the almighty fuss you make about
this fellow Bao-yu.’
‘Almighty fuss?’ said Bao-chai. ‘You’ve just been waving a door-bar at us, and you
say that we have been making a fuss?’
Xue Pan could see that Bao-chai had reason on her side and that she was much
harder to argue with than his mother. He was therefore eager to find something that
would stop her mouth, so that he could say what he wanted to without contradiction.
This, coupled with the fact that be was by now far too angry to weigh the seriousness
of what he was saying, was responsible for the unpardonable innuendo that
followed.
‘All right, sis,’ he said, ‘you don’t need to quarrel with me. I know what your trouble
is. Mamma told me long ago that Mr Right would be someone with a jade to match
your locket, so naturally, now you’ve seen that blasted thing that Bao-yu wears round
his neck, you do all you can to stick up for him.’
Anger at first made Bao-chai speechless; then, clinging to Aunt Xue, she burst into
tears.
‘Mamma, listen to what Pan is saying to me!’
Realizing, when he saw his sister’s tears, that he had gone too far, Xue Pan retired
sulkily to his own room and went to bed; Bao-chai was left bursting with injury and
outrage which she dared not express for fear of further upsetting her mother. She
was obliged to bid the latter a tearful goodnight and go back to her own room in the
Garden, where she spent the rest of the night weeping.
She was up early next morning. Too dispirited to make a proper toilet, she stopped
only to tidy herself a little before setting off for her mother’s. On the way she met, of
all people, Dai-yu, standing on her own beneath a flowering tree.
‘Where are you going?’ said Dai-yu.
‘To my mother’s.’ She answered without stopping.
Dai-yu noticed how dispirited she looked and saw that her eyes were swollen as if
she had been weeping.
‘Don’t make yourself ill, coz,’ she called out, almost glee?fully, to the retreating
back. ‘Even a cistern full of tears won’t heal the smart of a beating!’
The nature of Bao-chai’s reply will be revealed in the fol?lowing chapter.




CHAPTER 35

Sulky Silver tastes some lotus-leaf soup
And Golden Oriole knots a flower-patterned fringe

BAO-CHAI heard Dai-yu’s sarcasm quite clearly, but her mind was too taken up with
her own family affairs to pay much attention, and she continued on her way without
looking back.
As Dai-yu gazed towards the House of Green Delights, which was at some distance
from the flowering tree in whose shade she was standing, she presently observed Li
Wan, Ying-?chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun, attended by numerous maids, going into the
gate of its courtyard. Then, as she continued to watch, she saw them one by one
come out again and go their separate ways. It struck her that Xi-feng had not been
with them, and she wondered why.
‘It’s not like her not to visit him,’ she thought. ‘Even if she’s otherwise engaged,
you’d expect her to find some means of getting over and doing her little turn, if only
to keep in with Grandma and Auntie Wang. There must be some very press?ing
reason to keep her away.’
She lowered her head to reflect. Raising it again and looking once more in the
direction of Green Delights, she observed a colourful throng of females just about to
enter, and when she looked a little harder, she could make out Wang Xi-feng with
Grandmother Jia leaning on her arm. Lady Wang and Lady Xing walked behind them,
followed by Aunt Zhou and a large bevy of maids and women servants. As the last of
these disappeared inside the gate, Dai-yu nodded wistfully, thinking how good it
must be to have a family, and soon her face was once more wet with tears. Presently
she saw Aunt Xue and Bao-chai arrive. Not long after she had watched them enter
the gate, Nightingale suddenly walked up behind her.
‘Come and have your medicine, Miss,’ she said. ‘It’s cool enough to drink now.’
‘What’s the matter with you?’ said Dai-yu. ‘Always fussing! What does it matter to
you whether I take my medicine or not?’
Nightingale laughed good-humouredly.
‘Your cough’s only just beginning to get better, and already you want to stop taking
your medicine! It may be the fifth month and the weather may be hot, but all the
same, you still need to be careful. Come on, you’ve been standing quite long enough
in this early morning damp. You ought to come in now and rest a bit.’
Now that Nightingale’s words had recalled her attention to herself, Dai-yu became
aware that her legs were in fact rather tired. For a moment or two she appeared
rather bewildered, then, taking Nightingale’s arm, she slowly made her way back to
the Naiad’s House.
As they entered the courtyard, the chequered shadows of the bamboos and the
dew-pearled moss reminded her of two lines she had read in The Western Chamber:

             A place remote, where footsteps seldom pass,
             And dew still glistens on the untrodden grass.


‘It’s all very well,’ she thought, as she reflected oh the heroine of that play,
‘Ying-ying may have been unfortunate, but at least she had a widowed mother and a
little brother. I have no one.’
She was about to shed tears once more; but just then her parrot, which had been
perched aloft under the verandah eaves, seeing that his mistress had returned, flew
down with a sudden squawk that made her jump.
‘Wicked Polly!’ she said. ‘You’ve shaken dust all over my head!’
The parrot flew on to its perch.
‘Snowgoose!’ it called. ‘Raise the blind! Miss Lin is back!’
Dai-yu stooped in front of it and tapped its perch.
‘Did they remember your food and water, Polly?’
The parrot heaved a long sigh, uncannily like the ones that Dai-yu was wont to utter,
and recited, in its parroty voice:
             Let others laugh flower-burial to see:
             Another year who will be burying me?’

Dai-yu and Nightingale both burst out laughing.
‘It’s what you’re always reciting yourself, Miss,’ said Nightingale. ‘Fancy Polly being
able to remember it!’
Dai-yu made her take the perch down and hang it up outside the round
‘moon-window’ of her study.
Going indoors she sat down by the moon-window to take her medicine. Light
reflected from the bamboos outside passed through the gauze of the window to
make a green gloom within, lending a cold, aquarian look to the floor and the
surfaces of the furniture. To keep her spirits up in these somewhat cheerless
surroundings she spoke teasingly to the parrot hanging on the other side of the gauze
until he jumped and squawked on his perch, after which she taught him a few
snatches of her favourite poems.
At this point our narrative leaves her and returns to Bao-?chai.

*

When Bao-chai arrived at her mother’s apartment that morn?ing, she found her
mother still doing her hair. Aunt Xue greeted her daughter with a smile of surprise.
‘You’re very early this morning, my dear.’
‘I wanted to know how you were, Mamma. Did he come in again and give any more
trouble after I had left you last night?’
She sat down beside her mother and, in spite of herself, began to cry.
Aunt Xue, seeing her daughter’s tears, could not forbear shedding a few herself,
though she did her best to comfort her.
‘There, there, my child! Don’t be upset! I’ll deal with that wicked brother of yours,
you see if I don’t. I don’t want any?thing to happen to my girlie, do I? If anything
were to happen to her, I should have no one to turn to.’
Xue Pan, who had overheard, came running into the room at this point. Clasping his
hands together, he pumped them up and down, at the same time making sweeping
bows to right and left of him, in token of his contrition.
‘Forgive me, sis,’ he said. ‘I’d had too much to drink last night. I met a friend on my
way home. It was already quite late when I bumped into him, and I still hadn’t
sobered up properly when I got back here. I don’t know myself what it was I said, but
I know I must have talked a lot of silly non?sense. I’m not surprised you were angry
with me.’
The clumsiness of his apology rapidly turned Bao-chai’s weeping into laughter. Lifting
her face up from the handker?chief in which it had been buried, she made a little
grimace of derision.
‘There’s no need for you to put on this act,’ she said ‘I understand what your real
motive is perfectly well. You don’t like having us womenfolk around you and you are
looking for a means of getting rid of us, so that you can have the place here to
yourself.’
Xue Pan laughed deprecatingly.
‘I don’t know where you got that idea from, sis,’ he said. ‘It’s very unlike you to
make a snide remark like that.’
‘Snide remark?’ said Aunt Xue indignantly. ‘If that’s a “snide remark”, I don’t know
what sort of remarks you were making to your sister last night. I think you must have
taken leave of your senses!’
‘Now Mamma, don’t be angry,’ said Xue Pan, ‘and don’t you be upset, sis. Suppose I
were to tell you that from now on I’m going to give up drinking with the others
altogether, eh? What would you say to that?’
‘I’d say that you had come to your senses at last,’ said Bao?-chai.
‘And I’d say that the Heavenly Dragon had laid an egg,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘if you really
had the will-power to do it.’
‘All right then,’ said Xue Pan. ‘If you ever hear that I’ve been drinking with those
others again, sis, you can spit at me and you can call me a beast and a — and a —
worthless louse! Dammit, it’s too bad that the two of you should be worried all the
time because of me! It’s bad enough that I should make you angry, Mamma; but to
have poor little sis, too, worrying her heart out — oh, I really am a louse! I ought to
be extra good to you, Mamma, now that Father’s dead, and extra kind to sis; but
instead I make my own dear Mother angry and little sis upset. I’m not a beast, I’m
worse than a beast!’
And the great booby began to cry.
At this Aunt Xue, who had not been crying when he started, was herself becoming
upset, and Bao-chai was obliged to intervene with a brisk cheerfulness that she was
very far from feeling.
‘Haven’t you caused enough trouble already without making Mamma cry again?’
‘Who says I’ve been making Mamma cry?’ said Xue Pan, restraining his tears and
grinning back at her. ‘All right then, all right. Let’s drop the whole subject and say no
more about it. We’ll have Caltrop in and get her to pour you a nice cup of tea.’
‘I don t want any tea, thank you,’ said Bao-chai. ‘As soon as Mamma has washed, I
shall be going back into the Garden with her.’
‘Let me look at that-locket of yours,’ said Xue Pan. ‘I think it needs dipping again.’
‘Whatever for?’ said Bao-chai. ‘The gilding’s as bright as new.’
‘Isn’t it time you had a few more clothes?’ said Xue Pan.
‘Let me know what colours and what sort of patterns you want.’
‘I wouldn’t know what to do with them,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I haven’t yet worn all the
things I’ve got.’
Shortly after this exchange Aunt Xue re-emerged from changing her clothes and,
taking Bao-chai by the hand, went through into the Garden with her, leaving Xue Pan
to go off on his own.
Once in the Garden, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai made their way straight to Green
Delights. From the large number of maids and older women they found when they
got there waiting out?side on the verandah or in the ante-room inside, they knew
that Grandmother Jia and the other ladies must have arrived there before them.
They exchanged greetings with the latter on entering, after which they went over to
the couch on which Bao-yu lay, to inquire if he was feeling any better. Seeing Aunt
Xue, he attempted to raise himself a little.
‘Thank you,’ he said, ‘I am a little better. But what a lot of trouble I am causing! I
feel ashamed that you should have come over just to see me.’
Aunt Xue made him lie down again.
‘If there’s anything you want,’ she said, ‘do please let me know.’
‘I certainly shall,’ he said, ‘if I can think of anything.’
‘Is there anything you fancy to eat?’ said Lady Wang. ‘We can order it for you when
we go back presently.’
‘I can’t think of anything,’ said Bao-yu, ‘unless I did quite like that soup we had once
with the little lotus-leaves and lotus-pods in it.’
Xi-feng, who was standing by listening, gave a crow of laughter.
‘Listen to that, now! What low tastes the boy has! Whatever makes you want to eat
that leathery old stuff?’
‘Have it made, have it made!’ said Grandmother Jia vehemently. ‘Let the boy have
it by all means.’
‘Don’t be in such a hurry, Grannie!’ said Xi-feng laughing. ‘I’m trying to think who’s
got the moulds that they need for making the little shapes with.’
She turned and ordered one of the old women in attendance to go and ask the chief
cook; but though the old woman was a long time gone, she came back
empty-handed.
‘Cook says the four moulds for the soup-shapes were handed in some time ago on
your instructions.’
Xi-feng thought for a bit.
‘Yes, I remember now: I did get them back from her. But I can’t remember who I
gave them to. I should think the likeliest place for them to be is the tea-room.’
She sent someone to the tea-room stewardess; but she hadn’t got them either. In the
end they turned out to be with the plate stewardess, who looked after the gold and
silver. Aunt Xue was the first to examine them when they arrived.
There were four moulds fitted into a single box. They were made of silver, a foot or so
long and about an inch wide. Along the face of each mould were rows of very finely
cut dies, each about the size of a bean, thirty or forty on each mould. On one of the
moulds the dies were in the shape of chrysanthemums, on another of plum-flowers,
on the third of lotus pods and leaves, and on the remaining one of caltrops. Aunt Xue
turned to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang with amusement.
‘You people really do think of everything! All these patterns for a bowl of soup! If
you hadn’t told me, I should never have guessed what these things were for.’
Xi-feng answered her before either of the older ladies could reply.
‘You wouldn’t know about these anyway, Aunt. It’s some?thing they thought up last
year for Her Grace’s visit. They cut shapes with these things out of some special
dough — I’m not sure exactly what it’s made of — and put them in a clear soup.
There’s supposed to be a suggestion of autumn lotuses in the flavour, but it doesn’t
taste very much really. It’s certainly not the sort of thing you’d want to eat very often.
In fact, I think the only time we ever had it was when they made some for the visit.
I’m surprised he can still remember.’
She handed the moulds to an attendant woman-servant.
‘Tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other in?gredients as they’ll need to
make ten bowlfuls with. Say it’s wanted immediately.’
‘Why so much?’ said Lady Wang.
‘I have my reason,’ said Xi-feng. ‘This isn’t the sort of thing one eats every day, and
now that Cousin Bao has men?tioned it, it seems silly to make it just for him and not
let you and Grandma and Auntie Xue taste it as well. So while we are about it, we
might just as well do enough of it for everyone.’ She smiled mischievously. ‘I might
even have a taste of it myself.’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘Little monkey! We spoil you! Spending public money on private entertainment,
that’s what this is!’
The others all laughed. Xi-feng, quite unconcerned, joined in.
‘That’s no problem,’ she said. ‘I’m sure I can afford a little treat like this.’ She turned
to the waiting woman: ‘Tell the kitchen to use plenty of everything and charge it all
up to my account.’
The woman murmured a reply and went off to see about the order.
Bao-chai had been following these exchanges with amuse?ment.
‘Cousin Feng may be very artful,’ she said, ‘but I don’t believe that in all the years
I’ve been here I have ever seen her get the better of Lady Jia.’
‘I’m an old woman, my dear,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘What use would I have for
artfulness at my time of life? Mind you, when I was the age that Feng is now, I could
have taught her a thing or two. Still, though she may not be as sharp as I was then,
she doesn’t do so badly! A deal better than your Aunt Wang here, that’s certain. She
can’t talk to save her life, poor soul, no more than a woman of wood! She could
never get round me the way your Cousin Feng does. Fengie has the gift of a good
tongue, my dear. That’s why your old grannie is so fond of her.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘From what you say, Grandma, it sounds as if the good talkers are the only ones you
can be fond of.’
‘Oh no,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The silent ones have their merits, just as the good
talkers have theirs. Good talkers can be very tiresome at times and then I prefer the
silent ones.’
‘That’s all right then,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was going to say: my sister-in-law certainly isn’t
much of talker, yet I’m sure you are as fond of her as you are of Feng. If being a good
talker were the only thing that mattered, I should have thought that Cousin Feng and
Cousin Lin would be the only two in the family you would really care about.’
‘Well now, if we’re going to start comparing,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘I hope your
Aunt Xue won’t think I am only saying this because she is here, but really and truly I
do think that of all the girls in this family her Bao-chai is the one that I like the best.’
Aunt Xue laughingly demurred.
‘You mustn’t say that. I’m sure you can’t really mean it.’
‘No, no, I’m sure she does,’ Lady Wang hurriedly interposed. ‘I’ve often heard
Mother speak well of Bao-chai when you weren’t around.’
Bao-yu’s contribution to the conversation had been made with the intention of
encouraging Grandmother Jia to say something nice about Dai-yu. It came to him as a
surprise when she started praising Bao-chai instead. He looked at Bao?-chai and
grinned; but she turned quickly away and began talk?ing to Aroma.
Just then a servant came to say that lunch over at the man?sion was ready, and
Grandmother Jia rose to go. Having first exhorted Bao-yu to ‘hurry up and get better’
and then ad?monished his maids, she began to move out of the room not without a
polite attempt to make Aunt Xue go out ahead of her - leaning on Xi-feng’s arm.
‘Is that soup ready yet?’ she inquired when they were out of the room. Then,
turning to Aunt Xue, she asked her if there was anything she particularly fancied for
her lunch.
‘Mind you let me know if there is,’ she said. ‘I have the power to make Fengie treat
us to it.’
Aunt Xue laughed.
‘You shouldn’t tease the poor girl! She’s always getting nice things for you. But
you’re not much of an eater at the best of times.’
‘Don’t you believe it, Aunt!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Grannie knows how to tuck in. She’d have
eaten me by now if she weren’t afraid that she’d find me a bit too vinegary.’
This set them all off laughing. Even Bao-yu, in the inner room, had to join in, though
it hurt him to do so. Aroma, standing beside him, was helpless with mirth.
‘Mrs Lian really is a caution!’
Bao-yu took her hand and drew her down beside him.
‘Come!’ he said. ‘You must be tired. You’ve been on your feet for hours.’
‘Hey, you’ve forgotten!’ said Aroma. ‘While Miss Bao’s still in the courtyard, you
ought to ask her if she’ll let Oriole come over to do that knotting for you.’
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m glad you reminded me.’ He raised his head and shouted
towards the window.
‘Cousin Bao! If you can spare her, after you’ve had your lunch, would you mind
sending Oriole here to do some knotting for me?’
‘Yes, certainly,’ said Bao-chai, turning back to reply. ‘I’ll send her over presently.’
Grandmother Jia and the others had stopped to listen. Not having heard properly, the
old lady asked what it was, Bao?-chai explained.
‘Oh do, my dear!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Do let him have her to do the knotting I If
you need someone in her place, I have plenty of free hands in my apartment. Just
pick whichever of my maids you like to wait on you.’
Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were amused.
‘Let her go to him by all means,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but there certainly won’t be any
need of a stand-in. She has little enough to do but get up to mischief as it is.’
They had been walking on as they talked and presently came upon Xiang-yun,
Patience and Caltrop picking balsams beside an artificial ‘mountain’ of rock. Seeing
Grandmother Jia and the rest coming, they left off their flower gathering and came
forward to join them.
Soon the little party emerged from the Garden. Fearing that Grandmother Jia might
be fatigued, Lady Wang proposed that she should stop on the way back and sit down
for a while in her apartment. The old lady’s feet were indeed beginning to trouble
her and she nodded in consent. Lady Wang sent a maid on ahead to prepare for her
arrival.
Aunt Zhao was prudently avoiding Lady Wang for the time being by feigning sick, so
of the two concubines it was only Aunt Zhou who came out with the old
women-servants and maids of the apartment to welcome Grandmother Jia, holding
up the door blind for her to enter and arranging the pillows and back-rest for her on
the kang.
Moving up to it on Xi-feng’s arm, the old lady installed herself on the right-hand side
at the back with Aunt Xue in the guest’s position beside her. Bao-chai and Xiang-yun
sat nearer the edge of the kang on either side. Lady Wang served Grand?mother Jia
with tea, holding the cup ceremoniously in both her hands, and Li Wan in like
manner offered tea to Aunt Xue.
‘Let the younger women wait on us,’ said Grandmother Jia to Lady Wang. ‘You sit
down over there so that we can talk to you.’
Lady Wang obediently took a seat on a stool-chair beside the kang. She instructed
Xi-feng to be her deputy.
‘You can tell them to serve Grandmother’s lunch in here,’ she said to Xi-feng. ‘You
had better get them to add a dish or two.’
Having said that she would, Xi-feng went outside and in?structed a servant to take
word round to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The old women there passed on the
message in their turn, and soon a reinforcement of maids were hurrying on their way
to Lady Wang’s.
Lady Wang next gave instructions that the rest of the girls should be invited; but after
a long wait only Tan-chun and Xi-chun turned up. Ying-chun was unwell and did not
feel like eating. Dai-yu abstained so frequently — eating perhaps no more than five
meals in every ten — that her absence on this occasion was scarcely noticed.
Soon lunch arrived and the servants brought up a low table and set it down on the
kang. Xi-feng stood on the floor below, a bundle of ivory chopsticks wrapped up in a
tea-towel in her hand.
‘Now, Grannie and Auntie,’ she said, ‘I hope you are going to do as you’re told and
not stand on ceremony!’
Grandmother Jia looked at Aunt Xue and smiled.
‘Shall we do as she says and stay put?’
‘Yes, certainly,’ said Aunt Xue, smiling back, whereupon Xi-feng proceeded to lay for
them where they sat: two pairs of chopsticks on the far side for Grandmother Jia and
Aunt Xue, one pair at either end for Bao-chai and Xiang-yun. Lady Wang and Li Wan
stood on the floor below and supervised the serv?ing of the dishes, while Xi-feng
called for a set of clean things for one more person and went, chopsticks in hand,
from dish to dish, making a selection from them for Bao-yu.
A few minutes later the lotus-leaf soup arrived and was presented to Grandmother
Jia for her inspection. Lady Wang, glancing quickly round her, noticed Silver standing
near at hand and ordered her to carry a bowl of it to Bao-yu together with the other
things that Xi-feng had just put out for him; but Xi-feng objected that there was too
much for one person to carry. Just then Oriole and Providence chanced to enter, and
Bao-chai, knowing that they had already had their lunch, suggested that Oriole
should help with the carrying.
‘Master Bao has been asking if you could go over there to do some knotting for
him,’ she told Oriole, ‘You might as well go with her and do it now.’
‘Yes, Miss,’ said Oriole, and went off with Silver, carrying her share of the bowls.
‘They’re terribly hot,’ she said, when they were alone together. ‘How are we going
to carry them so far?’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Silver, ‘I know just the answer.’
She made one of the old women fetch a covered lacquer carrying-box. The bowls of
soup, rice and so forth fitted into it easily. She told the old woman to follow them.
She and Oriole then sauntered along empty-handed in the direction of Green
Delights, while the old woman trotted along behind them carrying everything. When
they reached the gate of the courtyard, Silver took the box from her and the two girls
went on into the house alone.
They found Aroma, Musk and Ripple in the inner room, enjoying a joke with Bao-yu.
The three of them got up, still laughing, when they saw Silver and Oriole enter, and
Aroma, supposing that they had come from their respective apart?ments, remarked,
as she relieved Silver of the box, on the coincidence of their arriving simultaneously.
Having handed over the box, Silver plumped herself down on a stool-chair; but Oriole
was less bold; and even when Aroma offered her a foot-stool to sit on, she still
refused to be seated.
Bao-yu was naturally very pleased to see Oriole; but the sight of Silver, reminding him,
with a pang of mingled shame and sorrow, of her sister Golden, impelled him to
ignore Oriole and concentrate his attention on the other girl. Aroma noticed this
neglect and was afraid that Oriole might be offended. Partly for this reason and
partly because Oriole looked so uncomfortable standing up, but was evidently
determined not to sit down in Bao-yu’s presence, she took her by the hand and drew
her into the adjoining room for a cup of tea and a chat.
Meanwhile in the inner room Musk and Ripple had laid out the bowls and chopsticks
and were waiting in readiness to serve Bao-yu his lunch; but Bao-yu was still
occupied with Silver and seemed in no hurry to begin.
‘How is your mother?’ he asked her.
The girl sat silent, with a sullen, angry look on her face. When, with a muttered ‘all
right’, she did at last answer him, she averted her eyes and would not look at him.
Bao-yu was very much put out, but did his best to be pleasant.
‘Who told you to bring this for me?’
‘Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian. Who do you think?’
Bao-yu could see the misery in her face and knew that it was because of Golden that
she looked like that. He wished he could humble himself before her, but the presence
of the other maids inhibited him. He had to think of some way of getting rid of them.
Having succeeded at last in doing so, he began, as soon as they were out of the room,
to exercise all his charm upon Silver. At first she tried to ignore the questions with
which he plied her; but he was so patient and persistent, meet?ing her unyielding
stiffness with such warmth and gentleness, that in the end her heart misgave her and
a faintly pleased expression began to steal over her face. Bao-yu judged the time ripe
to entreat her smilingly for his lunch.
‘Fetch me that soup will you, there’s a dear. I’d like to try it now.’
‘I can’t feed other people,’ said Silver. ‘I never could. You’ll have to wait till the
others come back.’
‘I’m not asking you to feed me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m just asking you to get it for me
because I can’t walk. Once you’ve done that you can go back and tell them you’ve
finished your errand and get on with your own lunch. I don’t want to keep you from
your food: you’re probably starving. However, if you don’t even feel up to passing me
a bowl of soup, I’ll just have to put up with the pain and get it myself.’
He tried to rise from his bed, but the effort cost him a cry of pain. Unable to hold out
any longer when she saw the state he was in, Silver jumped to her feet.
‘All right. Lie down, lie down!’ she said. ‘ “Past sin, present suffering.” You’ve got
your retribution without having to wait for it, so you needn’t expect me to feel sorry
for you!’
She broke into a sudden peal of laughter and fetched him the soup.
‘Silver dear,’ said Bao-yu, ‘if you still feel angry with me, get it over with now. Try to
look pleasanter when you are with Their Ladyships. You mustn’t look angry all the
time when you are with them, or you’ll be getting yourself into trouble.’
‘Go on, get on with your soup!’ said Silver. ‘Keep the sugary stuff for other people. I
know all about it!’
Bao-yu drank a couple of mouthfuls of the soup at her in?sistence, but artfully
pretended not to like it.
‘It doesn’t taste nice.’
‘Doesn’t taste nice?’ said Silver with an expression of extreme disgust. ‘Holy Name!
if that doesn’t taste nice, I’d like to know what does!’
‘It’s got no flavour,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Taste it yourself, if you don’t believe me.’
Silver to prove him wrong indignantly raised the spoon to her lips and tasted.
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Ah, now it’ll taste all right!’
Silver realized that he had deliberately tricked her into drinking from the same bowl.
‘You wouldn’t drink it a moment ago,’ she said, ‘so now you shan’t have any even if
you say you want it.’
And though Bao-yu laughingly begged and pleaded, she refused to let him have it
back and called in the other maids to give him the rest of his meal no sooner had
they come in, however, than it was announced that ‘two old nannies from Mr Fu’s’
had arrived ‘to call on Master Bao’.
Bao-yu knew that the ‘Mr Fu’ referred to must be one Fu Shi, an Assistant
Sub-Prefect who had started life as one of Jia Zheng’s protégé’s and made his way up
in the world largely by trading on Jia Zheng’s reputation. Jia Zheng thought highly of
him, regarding him as the brightest of the various young fellows he had patronized,
and Fu Shi for his part was assiduous in sending message and compliments to the
man?sion in order to keep up the connection.
Now if there were two sorts of people Bao-yu could not at any rice abide they were
stupid old women and pushing young men. It may therefore seem strange that these
two old nannies sent by the egregious Fu Shi should have been ac?corded instant
admission to his sickroom. The reason was that Bao-yu’ had heard that Fu Shi had a
younger sister called Fu Qiu-fang, who, though

        a virgin-pearl, still chambered from men’s sight,

was commonly said to be both beautiful and talented. Bao-yu had not actually seen
her; hut he had formed a picture of her in his imagination and worshipped her from
afar. And since to have refused entry to the two old women would have been in his
eyes tantamount to offering Qiu-fang an affront, he at once gave orders for them to
be admitted.
Qiu-fang was, as a matter of fact, a girl of passable good looks and more than average
intelligence. Her brother had entertained hopes of trading on these assets in order to
ally himself matrimonially with some powerful or aristocratic family — an ambition
which had hitherto led him to look frowningly on lesser offers, with the result that, at
the relatively great age of twenty-two, Qiu-fang remained unbetrothed. For the fact
of the matter was that the powerful and aristocratic families with whom he sought
alliance looked on Fu Shi as an impoverished pen-pusher deficient in both breeding
and refinement and showed not the slightest inclination to want his sister as a
daughter-in-law. However, Fu Shi went on cultivating his intimacy with the Jia family
and was still not without hopes of realizing his ambition in that direction.
It so happened that the two old nannies sent to see Bao-yu on this occasion were
exceptionally ignorant old women. Hearing that they were to be admitted, they came
into the room, delivered themselves of the sentence or two it took to inquire after
his health, and thereafter lapsed into a stupid silence.
With the arrival of strangers, Silver had been obliged to drop the bantering tone she
had begun to adopt with Bao-yu and stood, holding the soup-bowl in both her hands,
listening in silence. It was left to Bao-yu to make what conversation he could with the
women as he continued to eat his lunch. While so engaged, he reached out a hand
for the soup, and Silver reciprocated mechanically; but as both of them had their
eyes on the visitors, their uncoordinated movements resulted in a brief collision. The
bowl was upset and hot soup spilled over Bao-yu’s hand. Silver, startled, though
herself unhurt, gave a nervous laugh.
‘Now look what you’ve done!’
The other maids rushed forward to retrieve the bowl. Bao-yu, insensitive to his own
pain, inquired anxiously after Silver.
‘Where did you scald yourself? Does it hurt?’
Silver and the rest all laughed.
‘You’re the one who’s been scalded,’ said Silver. ‘Why ask me?’
Only then did Bao-yu become conscious that his own hand had been burned. The
maids hurriedly mopped up. Not wishing to continue his meal after this, he washed
his hands, drank some tea, and spoke a little longer with the old women, who then
took their leave and were seen through the Garden as far as the bridge by Skybright
and some of the other maids.
When they found themselves alone, ‘the two old women began discussing the visit
with each other as they went along.
‘Well, I’ve heard people say that this Bao-yu is like a bad fruit - good to look at but
rotten inside,’ said one of them, ‘and I must say I’m not surprised. He certainly does
seem a bit simple. Fancy scalding his own hand and then asking someone else where
it hurt! He must be a simpleton! Heh! heh! heh!’
‘He really and truly is a bit simple,’ said the other one. ‘A number of them told me
about it when I came here last. Once when he was out in the pouring rain and
himself as wet as a drowned chicken, he says to someone, “It’s raining,” he says, “run
inside and get out of the rain.” What a laugh! Heh! heh! heh! And he often cries or
laughs when no one else is by. They say that when he sees a swallow he talks to the
swallow, and when he sees a fish in the river he talks to the fish, and when he sees
the stars or the moon, he sighs and groans and mutters away to himself like a crazy
thing. And he’s as soft as a baby. Even the little maids can do what they like with him.
If he’s in the mood for saving, he’ll make a fuss over a piece of thread; but other
times they an smash things worth a fortune and he won’t mind a bit.’
Still talking, they passed out of the gate of the Garden, at which point our narrative
leaves them.
*

Back at Green Delights, Aroma, seeing that the others had now gone, led Oriole into
Bao-yu’s room to ask what it was that he wanted done. Bao-yu gave Oriole a smile.
‘I’m sorry, I was busy talking just now,’ he said. ‘I’m afraid I neglected you. The
reason I’ve dragged you here is because I want you to do some knotting for me.’
‘What’s it for?’ said Oriole.
‘Never mind that,’ said Bao-yu airily. ‘Do me some of every kind.’
Oriole clapped her hands and laughed.
‘Goodness me! That would take me about ten year!’
‘My dear young lady,’ said Bao-yu pleasantly, ‘you have all the time in the world at
your disposal. I’m sure you could manage in less time than that.’
‘Not in one sitting, at all events,’ said Aroma. ‘Better choose two or three of the
main types and let her do one of each.’
‘If you’re talking about types,’ said Oriole, ‘there are really only three: fan tassels,
rosary-nets and net-and-tassel fringes for sashes.’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu, ‘a sash-fringe.’
‘What colour’s the sash?’ said Oriole.
‘Crimson.’
‘Black or navy-blue would go well with crimson,’ said Oriole. ‘With anything lighter
the crimson would be too overpowering.’
‘What goes with viridian?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Peach pink.’
‘Mm. That sounds very colourful, certainly. What about something colourful but a
bit more on the quiet side?’
‘What about leek-green and greenish-yellow?’ said Oriole. ‘That’s a very tasteful
combination.’
‘All right, you make me those three then one black, one peach-pink and one
leek-green.’
‘What pattern do you want for the netting?’ said Oriole.
‘What patterns are there?’ said Bao-yu.
‘There’s stick-pattern, ladder-pattern, diamond, double diamond, linked rings,
flower-pattern, willow-leaf...’
‘What was the pattern of that netting you did the other day for Tan-chun?’
‘Ah, that was a flower-pattern with filled-in centres.’
‘I’d like it in that pattern.’
Aroma had meanwhile left them to fetch the silks. As she came back with them, an
old woman called through the win?dow to say that her lunch was ready.
‘Off with you then,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and come back as soon as you have finished.’
‘How can I possibly leave with a guest here in the room said Aroma.
‘Don’t be ridiculous! ’ said Oriole. ‘You go and have your lunch.’
Aroma smiled at that and tripped off, leaving the two of them alone together, except
for two very junior maids who were to remain at hand in case they were wanted.
Bao-yu lay and watched Oriole knotting, chatting to her in a desultory way as he
watched.
‘How old are you?’ he asked her.
Oriole replied without raising her head from her work.
‘Fourteen.’
‘What’s your surname?’
‘Huang.’
‘Huang? That means “yellow”. It goes well with your name. They say “yellow oriole”,
don’t they? — “yellow oriole”, “golden oriole”.’
‘My name was “Golden Oriole” originally,’ said Oriole, ‘but Miss Bao found it too
much of a mouthful, so she called me just “Oriole” for short, and now everyone else
does.’
‘Miss Bao must be very fond of you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I expect later on when she gets
married she’ll want to take you with her.’
Oriole pulled a face and laughed.
‘I’ve often said to Aroma,’ Bao-yu went on, ‘whoever gets you and your mistress
will be a lucky man.’
‘She’s a good person, is our Miss Bao,’ said Oriole, ‘much more than you realize.
There are things about her you don’t find in many people in this world — more
important things than good looks — though she’s good-looking too, of course.’
Oriole’s mellifluous, lilting voice and the simple, artless way in which she talked and
laughed had powerfully affected Bao-yu. It increased his pleasure to hear her
speaking in this way now about her mistress.
‘What things?’ he asked her eagerly. ‘Tell me about them.’
‘If I do,’ said Oriole, ‘you mustn’t let her know that I to you.’
‘Of course not.’
They were interrupted at this point by a voice from the outer room.
‘You’re very quiet in there!’
As the two of them simultaneously turned to look, it was Bao-chai herself who
stepped into the room. Bao-yu at once invited her to take a seat. When she had done
so, she inquired what Oriole was making and leaned forward to inspect it. The first of
the three sash-ends was already half completed.
‘What do you want to make a thing like that for?’ she asked. ‘Why don’t you make
him a necklet to wear with his jade?’
Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly. He had intended to ask Oriole to do this for
him in the first place, but had for?gotten.
‘Clever coz! What a good thing you mentioned it! I’d quite forgotten. But what
would be the right colour for it?’
‘Let’s see,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The brighter colours definitely wouldn’t do. Crimson
would clash. Yellow wouldn’t be a sufficient contrast. Black would be too heavy. I’ll
tell you what. If you were to take a gold thread and a very fine black bugle-thread
and twist them together — that would look nice.’
Bao-yu was delighted with the suggestion, and shouted several times for Aroma to
fetch the gold thread. She came in while he was still shouting for her, carrying two
plates of food and looking puzzled.
‘I can’t understand it,’ she said. ‘Someone’s just brought me these from Her
Ladyship.’
‘Oh, I expect they had more than they wanted there, so she’s sent you this to share
with the others,’ said Bao-yu.
‘No,’ said Aroma. ‘They said it was for me personally; but I’m not to go over and
kotow for it. I don’t know what to make of it.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘If it’s for you to eat, I should go ahead and eat it! Never mind the whys and
wherefores!’
‘But it never happened before,’ said Aroma. ‘I feel so embarrassed.’
Bao-chai’s lips puckered up mockingly.
‘Embarrassed? Before very long you’re going to have much more than this to feel
embarrassed about!’
Aroma sensed something behind this remark. She knew Bao-chai too well to suppose
that any such remark of hers would be made triflingly. Remembering what Lady
Wang had seemed to hint at in her interview of the previous day, she dropped the
subject.
‘I’ll have these now then,’ she said, holding the dishes out for Bao-yu to inspect,
‘and as soon as I’ve washed, I shall bring you your gold thread.’
With that she hurried out again.
When she returned later, after having lunched and washed her hands, bringing the
gold thread for Oriole’s knotting, Bao-chai was no longer there, since she had been
called away by Xue Pan’s messenger.
Bao-yu once more lay back and watched Oriole knotting; but soon they were
interrupted once more, this time by a couple of maids from Lady Xing’s. They brought
two sorts of fruit and a message for him from their mistress.
‘Her Ladyship says are you able to walk? She says if you are, she’d like you to come
over some time and amuse your?self. She says tell him I’m thinking of him.’
‘Tell her,’ Bao-yu replied politely, ‘that as soon as I can walk, I shall certainly be
round to pay my respects. Tell her that the pain is a little better than it was and that
she is not to worry.’
Asking the two girls to be seated, he called Ripple to him and asked her to take half of
the fruit they had brought and offer it to Dai-yu; but just as she was about to go,
Dai-yu could be heard talking in the courtyard. He told Ripple to hurry outside and
invite her in.

CHAPTER 36

Bao-chai visits Green Delights and hears strange words from
a sleeper
Bao-yu visits Pear-tree Court and learns hard facts from
a performer
WHEN Grandmother Jia got back to her own apartment after lunching with Lady
Wang, she was naturally very pleased to have seen Bao-yu making such rapid
progress; but her pleasure soon gave way to worry when she began wondering what
would happen when he was well enough for Jia Zheng to start asking for him again.
To guard against that contin?gency she had Jia Zheng’s Head Boy brought before her
to receive instructions direct from her own mouth.
‘In future,’ she told him, ‘whenever the Master is entertain?ing guests or seeing
anybody and asks for Bao-yu, you are to say, straight away, without needing to see
me about it, first of all that Master Bao was very seriously injured by his beating and
will need several months’ complete rest before he can walk properly; and secondly
that he has just made an offering to his star-guardian because of an unlucky
conjunction in his horo?scope and isn’t allowed to see outsiders or go outside the
inner gate until the beginning of the eighth month.’
She called Nannie Li and Aroma to her as soon as the Head Boy had gone and
instructed them to tell Bao-yu this, so that no worries should retard the progress of
his recovery.
Bao-yu had always hated meeting or making conversation with senior males of the
scholar-official class and detested all occasions which involved dressing up, such as
visits of congratulation and condolence and the various other formal ex?changes to
which members of that class devote so great a part of their time. His grandmother’s
dispensation was therefore particularly gratifying to him, and he used it as an excuse
for cutting himself off from all contact with visiting relations and friends. He even
pleased himself about whether or not he made the customary morning and evening
duty-calls on the senior members of the household. Each day was spent playing or
resting in the Garden, and during the whole of the day, except for the brief period in
the early morning when he went outside to visit his mother and grandmother, he
was the will?ing captive of his maids and did for them whatever little ser?vices it
pleased them to command. In such enjoyable indolence several weeks slipped
agreeably by. From time to time, as opportunity presented itself, someone like
Bao-chai would attempt to remonstrate with him; but her remonstrances would be
indignantly rejected.
‘Why should a pure, sweet girl like you want to go imitating that ghastly crew of
thievish, place-hunting career worms,’ he would say, ‘bothering her head about
“fame” and “reputa?tion” and all that sort of rubbish? All these notions you are
parroting were dreamed up by meddlesome old men in days gone by for the express
purpose of leading astray the whis?kered idiots who came after them. I really think
it’s too bad that I should have to live in an age when the minds of nice, sensible girls
are contaminated by such idiocies. It’s a tank abuse of the intellectual gifts that you
were born with!’
Hearing him talk so wildly, the remonstrators concluded that he was slightly mad,
and eventually gave up trying to be serious with him. The exception was Dai-yu, who,
ever since they were little children together, had never once spoken to him about the
need to ‘get on in the world’ or ‘make a name for oneself’. This was one of the
reasons why he so much respected her.

*

But to return to our narrative.
Some time after Golden’s death, Xi-feng began receiving presents and courtesy calls
from various senior members of the domestic staff. Though she could not for the
moment guess what lay behind these flattering attentions, her sus?picions were
aroused, and one day, in the course of which she had once more received presents
from these people, she laugh?ingly questioned Patience on the subject when they
were alone together in the evening.
‘I’m surprised you haven’t guessed that!’ said Patience a little scornfully. ‘I think, if
you were to look into it, you’d find that all of these people had daughters working for
Her Lady?ship. There are four senior maids on Her Ladyship’s establish?ment who
each get one tael a month, the rest only get a few hundred cash each; and now that
Golden’s dead, one of the tael-a-month places is vacant. I expect these people are
trying to get it for their own daughters.’
‘Of course!’ said Xi-feng, much amused. ‘Of course! I’m sure you are right. Well, I do
think it rather greedy of them. They earn quite good money as it is, they don’t have
any really hard work to do, and they’ve got daughters to bring them in a little extra
income. I think for them to want to get this plum for themselves as well is really a bit
too much. I wouldn’t have thought they could afford to keep sending me presents
like this. Still, that’s their concern! If they want to go on giving me presents, I shall go
on taking them. But I shall still do what I was going to do anyway. It won’t make any
difference to me.’
In pursuance of this policy she kept the servants waiting for a decision and watched
the presents accumulate; then, when no more seemed to be forthcoming, she
availed herself of the first opportunity to raise the matter with Lady Wang. This
occurred one day about noon when Aunt Xue, Bao-chai and Dai-yu were in Lady
Wang’s apartment sharing a water-melon with her. Xi-feng tackled Lady Wang while
they sat eating the melon.
‘You’ve been short of a maid, Aunt, since Silver’s sister died,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Have you
anyone in mind to replace her with? You might let us know if you have, so that we
know what to do with next month’s allowance.’
Lady Wang thought for a bit.
‘Do I have to have four maids or five maids or whatever it is?’ she asked. ‘It seems
to me that if the maids I’ve got are adequate, I might as well do without the other
one.’
Xi-feng smiled.
‘In principle, of course, you are right, Aunt; but we have got fixed rules about these
things, and when some people at the bottom of the scale are making a great fuss
about keeping their number up, it wouldn’t do to have you cutting yours down. In
any case, the saving would only be one tael a month: it would hardly be worth
making.’
Lady Wang again reflected for some moments.
‘Very well,’ she said at last, you can go on paying the allowance as before, but you
needn’t find me another maid. Silver shall have it. Her sister gave me a lot of service
before she was so unfortunate, poor child. I don’t think it would be excessive to give
Silver a double allowance, for her sister’s sake.’
After promising to see that this was done, Xi-feng turned smilingly to Silver and
congratulated her. Silver hurried for?ward and kotowed in gratitude to Lady Wang.
‘That reminds me,’ said Lady Wang: ‘what allowance do Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou
get each month?’
‘The fixed amount is two taels each a month,’ said Xi-feng, but Aunt Zhao gets an
additional two taels for Huan, so she really gets four taels. Then on top of that they
each get two strings of cash a month for their maids.’
‘Do they get the full amount every month?’ said Lady Wang.
Xi-feng was somewhat taken aback.
‘Of course. Why not?’ she replied, a trifle sharply.
‘It’s just that I thought I heard someone the other day com?plaining that they were
a string of cash short,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I wonder how that could have happened?’
Xi-feng smiled disarmingly.
‘The allowance for Aunt Zhao’s and Aunt Zhou’s maids used to be one string each a
month, but last year Accounts reduced it by a half to five hundred cash. Aunt Zhao
and Aunt Zhou are allowed two maids each, so that means they now get one string a
month less than they used to. This is something completely outside my control. I’d be
only too happy to pay them more if I could, but the cut was made by Accounts, and
all I can do is to hand out what I am given. It’s not my de?cision. In fact, I’ve raised
the matter once or twice with them and told them they ought to go back to the
original payment, but all they’ll say is that that’s what’s been decided and nothing
can be done about it. Actually, now that I do the paying, people do at least get their
allowances on time. In the old days, when Accounts made the payments direct, we
were always having trouble. Never a month went by without some one getting into
debt because they hadn’t been paid on time.’ Another silence followed in which Lady
Wang was evi?dently thinking.
‘How many of Lady Jia’s maids get one tael a month?’ she asked eventually.
‘Seven—well, eight really, if you count Aroma.’
‘Yes, I see,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Bao-yu wouldn’t have any tael-a-month maids of his
own, of course. Aroma still counts as one of Lady Jia’s maids.’
‘Oh yes. Aroma is still Grandma’s maid,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Grandma lets Bao-yu employ
her, but her pay still comes out of Grandma’s allowance. It would be quite out of the
question to cut her pay simply because she’s working for Bao-yu. If you wanted to do
that, you’d first have to find another maid for Grandma. And even then, of course, if
you wanted her to be paid as a member of Bao-yu’s establishment, to make it fair
you’d really need to give Huan another maid, too. Incidentally, the fact that Bao-yu’s
senior maids like Skybright and Musk get a string of cash a month and the juniors like
Melilot five hundred is due to Grandma’s own personal instructions; so I don’t think
anyone is really in a position to make a fuss about that.’
Aunt Xue laughed.
‘Listening to Feng is like listening to a load of walnuts being emptied out of a cart -
all those facts and figures! And everything accounted for — everything just and fair!’
‘I trust none of the facts and figures were wrong, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng.
‘No, no, nothing wrong with the facts and figures,’ said Aunt Xue pleasantly. ‘It’s
just that you would save yourself some energy by taking them a little more slowly.’
Xi-feng seemed about to laugh, but checked herself to hear what her other aunt had
to say. Lady Wang, however, de?liberated for some little while longer before making
her pro?nouncement.
‘Find someone to wait on Lady Jia in place of Aroma,’ she said eventually, ‘and stop
paying Aroma out of Lady Jia’s allowance. Instead you can pay her two taels and a
string of cash a month out of my personal allowance of twenty taels. And in future,
whatever arrangements are made about Aunt Zhao’s and Aunt Zhou’s allowances, I
want you to pay Aroma at exactly the same rate only whatever it is, it’s all to come
out of my personal allowance. I don’t want Accounts getting mixed up in this.’
Having promised to carry out these instructions, Xi-feng turned to Aunt Xue and
nudged her playfully.
‘There you are! What did I tell you? It’s turned out exactly as I said.’
‘And so it should,’ said Aunt Xue warmly. ‘It should have been done long ago. She’s
a lovely girl — and it isn’t only her looks I’m referring to, either. She has such a
generous, open way of doing things, and she is so polite and friendly to talk to.
There’s a strong little will there, though — plenty of deter?mination underneath it
all. Oh, I think she’s a real treasure.’
‘She is a dear, good child,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t think the rest of you realize just
how good she is. Ten times better than my Bao-yu, that’s quite certain. If Bao-yu can
keep her with him always, he’ll he a very lucky boy.’
‘If you think that, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng, ‘why not have her plucked and painted and
make her his chamber-wife openly?’
‘No, it wouldn’t do,’ said Lady Wang. ‘First of all he is too young; secondly Sir Zheng
would never agree to it; and in the third place, even if we allow a certain amount of
freedom between them, as long as he still thinks of her as his maid, there is some
chance that he will listen to what she says, but once we make her his chamber-wife,
she will feel less free to tell him what she thinks of him when he is being silly. No, I
think for the moment at any rate we should leave it a little vague. We can make a
more definite arrangement in two or three years’ time.’
After pausing long enough to ascertain that Lady Wang had nothing more to say,
Xi-feng turned and went. A group of stewards’ wives were waiting for her under the
eaves in the narrow alley-way at the back to report to her on various household
matters. They smiled at her as she emerged, and one of them chaffed her about the
length of her visit.
‘You’ve been a long time today, Madam. What can you have been talking about to
keep you so long? I hope you haven’t overheated yourself with so much talking!’
Xi-feng stood in the doorway in a very unladylike attitude, one foot on the threshold,
rolling her sleeves back and smiling at no one in particular.
‘There’s a nice little draught out here. I think I’ll stand here for a bit and cool off.’
She turned to the women.
‘Did you say I’ve been a long time? It’s hardly surprising. Today Her Ladyship has
been asking about just about every?thing that’s happened here during the past two
hundred years.’ Her voice lost its jocular tone and became suddenly harsher. ‘From
now on if I ever feel like doing something really spite?ful, I shall do it. Let her
complain to Her Ladyship if she has a mind to, I don’t care. Stupid woman! Stupid,
chicken-witted, evil-tongued, snivelling, misbegotten whore! She ought to wake up.
One of these days they’ll make a dean sweep and take the whole lot away — then
she’ll have something to shout about! Complain about me, would she, because her
maid’s allowance has been cut? Who the Holy Name does she think she is? She’s only
a bit of bought goods herself. What’s the likes of her doing with maids to wait on her
any way?’
Leaving the stewardesses to make what they would of this explosion, she strode off
to look for someone suitable to take a message in to Grandmother Jia.
At which point we leave her.

*

After Aunt Xue and the two girls had finished their water?melon, they sat talking for
a few minutes longer with Lady Wang before leaving, Aunt Xue to return to her own
apart?ment, Bao-chai and Dai-yu to go back into the Garden. Bao?-chai invited
Dai-yu to accompany her to the Lotus Pavilion to pay a call on Xi-chun, but Dai-yu
said she was going to have a bath, and presently parted company with Bao-chai,
leaving her to continue on her way there alone. Bao-chai’s route took her past the
House of Green Delights, and as she drew near it, she thought she would call in to
chat for a while with Bao-yu and help him to dispel the sleepiness of the early
afternoon.
The courtyard was silent as she entered it. Not a bird’s cheep was to be heard. Even
the storks were asleep, hunched up in the shadow of the plantains. Keeping to the
relative cool?ness of the covered walk, she made her way round to the house. In the
outer room maids were lying about in all directions asleep. Slipping behind the tall
mirror and through the elaborately carved partition, she passed into the inner room
where Bao-yu lay inside his protective summer ‘cabinet’ of net. He, too, was fast
asleep. Aroma sat at his bedside sewing, a white horse-hair fly-whisk with a handle of
white rhinoceros-horn at her side. Bao-chai entered the ‘cabinet’ and laughed softly
at Aroma.
‘Aren’t you being rather over-cautious?’ she whispered. ‘What’s the fly-whisk for?
Surely no flies or mosquitoes can get in here?’
Aroma looked up, startled, hurriedly put down her sewing, and rose to her feet.
‘Oh, it’s Miss Bao! I wasn’t expecting you,’ she whispered. ‘You gave me quite a
shock - no, we don’t get any flies or mosquitoes in here, but there’s a little tiny insect
that finds its way through the holes in the netting. They’re so small, you don’t notice
them; but when you’re asleep they can give you a nasty bite - a bit like an ant-bite.’
‘That’s not surprising,’ said Bao-chai. ‘You’ve got water behind you here, you see;
you’ve also got a lot of sweet?-smelling flowers outside; and indoors is perfumed as
well. This kind of insect breeds in the insides of flowers and is attracted towards
anything fragrant. That’s why you get them inside the house.’
While she was speaking, her eye fell on the sewing that Aroma had just put down. It
was a pinafore of the kind children wear, with bib and apron in one. It was of white
satin lined with red silk, and the pattern Aroma was em?broidering on it was one of
mandarin ducks disporting themselves in a background of lotuses. The ducks were in
rainbow colours, and the lotuses had red flowers and green leaves.
‘Goodness, how beautiful!’ she exclaimed. ‘Who’s it for? It must be someone very
special, to deserve work as fine as this.’
Aroma turned her head and shot her lips out in the direction of the figure sleeping on
the bed.
‘Him? He’s too big to wear that sort of thing, surely?’
‘He wouldn’t wear them to start with. That’s why I try to make them so nicely—so
that when he sees them he can’t resist putting them on. I try to get him to wear
them in this hot weather, so that if he uncovers himself in his sleep, there’s no risk of
his getting chilled. If you think there’s a1ot of work in this one, you ought to see the
one he’s wearing!’
‘I wonder you can have the patience,’ said Bao-chai.
‘I’ve done such a lot of work on it today,’ said Aroma, ‘my neck is quite stiff from
bending over.’ She smiled at Bao-chai entreatingly: ‘Do us a favour, Miss: sit here a bit
in my place, will you, while I go off and stretch my legs? I’ll be back directly.’
Saying this, she slipped quietly out, not waiting for a reply. So intent was Bao-chai on
the embroidery that she sank down almost without realizing what she was doing into
the place that Aroma had just vacated. It really was a most beauti?ful piece of work;
in fact, she found it irresistible, and taking up the needle, began sewing it where
Aroma had left off.
Meanwhile Dai-yu, on her way back to have a bath, had run into Xiang-yun and
agreed to the latter’s proposal that they should together call on Aroma to
congratulate her on her promotion. They arrived in the courtyard of Green Delights
to find everything plunged in silence. Xiang-yun went round to the side to see if
Aroma was in any of the maids’ rooms. Dai-yu went up to the main building and
peeped through the gauze window into Bao-yu’s bedroom. She saw Bao-yu, clothed
in little else but a thin, rose-coloured shirt, sprawled out asleep on the bed and
Bao-chai sitting beside him sewing, with a fly-whisk in readiness at her side.
For some moments she goggled incredulously at this touch?ing domestic scene, then,
fearful of disturbing it, she tore herself away to stifle her mounting giggles. When she
had some?what subdued them, she beckoned to Xiang-yun to come over and look.
Wondering what extraordinary spectacle could have put her in such a state,
Xiang-yun hurried over for a peep. She, too, found the scene inside a comical one
and would have burst out laughing; but in her case it was the consideration that
Bao-chai had always been so kind to her that caused her to control her mirth. And
knowing how merciless Dai-yu could be with her witticisms, she took her by the hand
and dragged her away, explaining as she did so that she had just remembered that
Aroma had said something about going at noon to wash some clothes in the lake.
‘I’m sure that’s where she will be,’ she said to Dai-yu. ‘Let’s go and look for her
there.’
Dai-yu was not in the least deceived, and showed as much by her sardonic laugh. But
she followed her nonetheless.
Bao-chai meanwhile continued her sewing undisturbed. She had just completed her
second, or maybe it was her third petal, when Bao-yu, who appeared to be dreaming,
cried out angrily in his sleep.
‘Why should I believe what those old monks and Taoists say? I don’t believe in the
marriage of gold and jade. I believe in the marriage of stone and flower.’
The words astounded her. She had still not recovered from the shock of hearing them
when Aroma returned.
‘What, isn’t he awake yet?’
Bao-chai shook her head.
‘I just now ran into Miss Lin and Miss Shi,’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose they didn’t come
in here, did they?’
‘Not that I know of,’ said Bao-chai. She glanced up at Aroma with a sly smile: ‘Did
they tell you anything?’
Aroma coloured.
‘Oh, a lot of nonsense - as usual! They were only joking, though.’
‘They weren’t joking,’ said Bao-chai, ‘- not this time. I was going to tell you myself,
but you went rushing off before I had a chance to.’
Just at that moment a maid arrived from Xi-feng summon?ing Aroma to go and see
her.
‘There you are!’ said Bao-chai. ‘That’ll be what she wants to see you about.’
Aroma had to arouse two of the sleeping maids to take her place in the inner room;
then she and Bao-chai left Green Delights together. They parted company outside,
and Aroma went off to Xi-feng’s place on her own. When she got there she was, as
Bao-chai had predicted, formally acquainted with the new arrangements concerning
her pay and status that had just been made for her by Lady Wang. She was told that
she should go over to Lady Wang’s to kotow her thanks, but that there was no need
for her to see Grandmother Jia.
She found this interview with Xi-feng acutely embarrassing. By the time she got back
from Lady Wang’s, Bao-yu was already awake. She answered him evasively when he
asked her where she had been and waited for the silence and darkness of the night
to tell him of her unofficial promotion to his bed. Bao-yu was delighted.
‘I hope there’ll be no more talk of leaving me now!’ he said, smiling broadly at her.
‘Do you remember the time when you got back from visiting your family and tried to
frighten me with all that talk about your brother wanting to buy you out of service
and how there was no future for you here and no point in your staying permanently,
and all those other heartless, unkind things you said? I’d like to see anyone trying to
take you away from me now!’
‘Huh!’ Aroma sniffed scornfully. ‘That’s not at all the way it is. I belong to Her
Ladyship now. Now if I want to leave you, I don’t have to talk to you about it at all. All
I have to do is have a word with Her Ladyship, and off I go!’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Suppose I were at fault and you told Her Ladyship and asked her to let you go;
don’t you think you’d feel just a tiny bit uncomfortable afterwards when it got about
that you had left me because I wasn’t good enough for you?
‘Why ever should I?’ said Aroma. ‘Of course, I wouldn’t go if it meant marrying a
thief or a murderer. There’s always another way out. I could always take my own life.
We all have to die some time or other; it’s just a question of when. All you’ve got to
do is stop breathing, that’s all. After that you hear nothing, see nothing - it’s all over!’
‘Stop it, now! Stop it!’ said Bao-yu, covering her mouth with his hand. ‘You don’t
have to say things like that.’
All too familiar with the peculiarities of this master who condemned flattering
‘auspicious’ talk as false and hollow, but was upset and morose if you told him the
truth, Aroma regret?ted her blunder in having too openly spoken her mind.
Smil?ingly she turned the conversation on to topics which experience taught her
were agreeable to him: the beauties of Nature, the beauties of girls, girls. But
somehow from there the conversation imperceptibly found its way round to the
subject of girls dying. Suddenly realizing this, Aroma — it was she who was talking at
the time — broke off in alarm. Bao-yu, who up to that point had been listening to her
enthralled, laughed at her sudden silence.
‘We all have to die, as you said yourself just now. The prob?lem is how to die well.
Those whiskered idiots who take quite literally the old saw that “a scholar dies
protesting and a soldier dies fighting” and get themselves killed off on the
assumption that those are the only two ways in which a man of spirit can die
gloriously, would do better to die in their beds. For when you come to think of it, the
only real occasion for protesting is when one’s ruler is misguided, and the only real
occasion for fighting is when one’s country is at war. If the scholar is so greedy for
martyrdom that he throws away his life at the earliest opportunity, what is to
become of the poor misguided ruler in the absence of good advisers? And if the
soldier so hankers for a hero’s death that he gets himself killed off in the first
encounter, what is to become of his country without soldiers to fight its battles—?’
‘But surely,’ Aroma interrupted, ‘those famous men in the olden days laid their lives
down because they had to?’
‘Nonsense!’ said Bao-yu. ‘The soldiers among them lacked generalship; as a
consequence, they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on. They threw
their lives away out of sheer incompetence. Do you call that dying because they had
to? And the scholars were even worse. On the strength of having read a couple of
books and got up a text or two by heart, they began to cry stinking fish as soon as
they found the smallest thing at Court not as they thought it should be, in the hope
of winning themselves an imperishable reputation for honesty; then, if the Court
didn’t immediately change its policy, they would work themselves into a passion and
promptly get themselves killed. You won’t, surely, say that they died because they
had to? What you have to remember is that Emperors hold their power from Heaven,
and it’s un?thinkable that Heaven should lay the huge responsibility of empire on any
but the worthiest shoulders. So you can see that all those death-with-honour
characters you have so high an opinion of were thinking only of their own personal
fame and glory. They weren’t really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at
all.
‘Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me;
then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away
on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently
decompose there until the wind had picked my bones clean, and after that never,
never to be reborn again as a human being—that would be a really good death.’
‘I’m sleepy,’ said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit
was on him again. And Bao-yu at once closed his eyes and fell fast asleep.
By next morning the subject appeared to have been quite forgotten.

*

A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Garden’s possibilities, and
its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on
his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his
appetite for more. Having recently been told that the best singer among the twelve
little actresses of Pear Tree Court was the soubrette called Charmante, he resolved,
for a change of scene, to go over there and look her up, so that he could ask her to
sing him some of the arias from it.
The only girls he recognized when he arrived there were Tresor and Topaze, who
greeted him with smiles and invited him to be seated. When he asked where
Charmante was, the girls all answered him in chorus:
‘In her room.’
Bao-yu at once went to the room indicated. Charmante was in there on her own. She
was lying stretched out on her bed, but made no attempt to get up when she saw
him enter. Nothing daunted, he sat himself down beside her and, in the familiar way
he habitually adopted with girls, smilingly re?quested her to sing the section from
the Return that begins with the words

                  In these quiet courts the floating gossamer...

But Charmante did not respond in the expected manner. She rose up quickly and
drew away from him when he sat down beside her; and in answer to his request to
sing, she informed him, with a cold, unsmiling expression, that she was ‘not invoice’.
‘I strained my voice the other day at a command perform?ance for Her Grace,’ she
said. ‘I am still resting it.’
She was sitting opposite him as she said this, so that he had a full view of her face.
He remembered now, as he studied it, where he had seen that face before. She was
the girl he had seen scratching QIANS on the ground that day under the rose pergola.
And now here she was behaving as if his very presence was distasteful to her. Never
in his life before had he experienced such instant rejection. Reduced to mumbling
incoherence by his embarrassment, he coloured, and — since there was ob?viously
no point in staying — left the room.
Surprised to see him come out again so soon, the others asked him the reason.
Trésor laughed when he told her what had happened.
‘Wait until Mr Qiang gets back,’ she said. ‘If he asks her to, she’ll sing for you.’
Bao-yu did not know quite what to make of this.
‘Qiang?’ he said. ‘Where is he, anyway?’
‘He went out only a few minutes ago,’ said Trésor. ‘I expect Charmante said she
wanted something and he’s gone out to try and get it for her.’
Bao-yu seemed to find this of enormous interest and decided to stay a little longer
and see what happened. Sure enough, Jia Qiang presently returned from his
expedition. He was carry?ing a bird-cage with a bird inside. The cage had a miniature
stage fastened to the top of it. Jia Qiang was on his way inside to look for Charmante,
obviously feeling very pleased with himself, when he caught sight of Bao-yu and
halted.
‘What’s that bird you’ve got there?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘It’s a whitecap,’ said Jia Qiang, smiling proudly. ‘It can hold a flag in its beak and do
a little turn on the stage.’
‘How much did you pay for it?’
‘One tael and sixteen pennyweights of silver.’
He invited Bao-yu to be seated while he went into Charmante’s room to show off his
purchase; but Bao-yu, whose desire to hear Charmante sing was now quite forgotten
in his eagerness to find out exactly how things lay between her and Jia Qiang, joined
the girls as they clustered round the door-way to watch.
‘Look! Look what I’ve brought for you,’ said Jia Qiang, full of smiles.
‘What is it?’
Charmante had been lying down again, but sat up when he entered.
‘I’ve got a little bird to keep you company, to stop you get?ting so depressed. You
watch! I’ll make him perform for you.’
He took a few grains from his pocket and coaxed the bird out on to the stage, where
it picked up a diminutive mask and flag and hopped and pirouetted about like an
actor playing the warrior’s part in a play. The girls all laughed delightedly and said it
was ‘sweet’. All except Charmante. She merely gave a scornful ‘huh!’ or two and lay
back on the bed again in dis?gust.
Jia Qiang smiled — almost beseechingly.
‘How do you like it?’
‘You and your family!’ said Charmante bitterly. ‘It isn’t enough to take decent girls
from their homes and shut them up in this prison to learn beastly opera all day. Now
you have to bring a bird along to do it as well. I suppose it’s to keep me reminded of
my misery. And you have the audacity to ask me “do I like it?”!’
Her words appeared to make Jia Qiang quite frantic, for he uttered a string of the
most violent and passionate oaths in reply.
‘I’m a stupid fool and I should have known better,’ he said. ‘I spent all that money
on the thing because I thought it might cheer you up. It never occurred to me that
you might take it like this. Well, let the thing go then! It’s an “act of merit” to free
living creatures, so at least you’ll get some good from it. Either it will help you in the
next life or free you from sickness in this one.’
With that he released the bird, which promptly flew away, and stamped on the cage
until it was smashed to pieces.
‘Maybe birds aren’t as important as human beings,’ said Charmante, ‘but they have
mothers and fathers just the same. Can’t you see how cruel it is to take them away
from their nests and make them perform for people’s amusement? I coughed up two
mouthfuls of blood today. Her Ladyship sent someone to look for you. She wanted
you to get me a doctor so that we could find out what to do, but instead of a doctor
you bring this thing back with you, to make a mock of me. It’s just my luck to fall ill
when I’ve got no one to care for me or take any notice.’
She began to cry.
‘But I asked the doctor about you yesterday evening and he said it wasn’t serious,’
Jia Qiang protested. ‘He said you were to take a couple of doses of that medicine and
he’d come and look at you again in two days’ time. I’d no idea that you’d been
spitting blood. Well, I’d better go and get him straight away.’
He began to go, but Charmante called him back.
‘Stay where you are! Don’t go rushing off in this burning heat. You’re only going to
fetch him because you’re in a temper, anyway. I wouldn’t see him now if he came!’
Hearing her say this, Jia Qiang halted.
Bao-yu had been watching this scene with open-mouthed fascination. At last he
understood the real meaning of all those QIANGS. There was obviously no place for
him here, so he slipped away. Jia Qiang was so absorbed in his concern for
Charmante that he did not even notice him go and it was left to the little actresses to
see him out.
It was a reflective, self-critical Bao-yu who made his way back to Green Delights, so
bemused that he scarcely noticed where he was going. When he arrived, Dai-yu and
Aroma were sitting in conversation together. He looked at Aroma and sighed heavily.
‘What I told you the other night was wrong,’ he said. ‘I’m not surprised that Father
tells me I have a “small capacity but a great self-conceit”. I mean, that stuff about all
of you making a river of tears for me when I die: I realize now that it’s not possible. I
realize now that we each have our own allotted share of tears and must be content
with what we’ve got.’
Aroma was surprised to hear him bring this up again. She had assumed that what he
said that night was in jest and must long since have been forgotten. She laughed.
‘You know, sometimes I think you really are a bit touched!’
Bao-yu was silent.
From the curious way in which he was behaving Dai-yu could see that something had
got into him, but judged it not her business to inquire what. To change the subject
she asked him about something of a more practical nature.
‘When I was with your Mother just now she told me that it is Mrs Xue’s birthday
tomorrow. She told me to ask you whether you intend going or not. When you’ve
decided, she’d like you to send someone round and let her know.’
‘Well, I didn’t go last time, when it was Uncle She’s birth?day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It will
be a bit awkward if I go this time and run into someone from Uncle She’s. I think I’d
better stop going to birthdays altogether. In any case, it’s terribly hot, and I should
have to dress up for it. And I don’t think Auntie would really mind if I didn’t go.’
‘That’s no way to talk!’ said Aroma. ‘There’s no compari?son whatever between Sir
She and your Aunt Xue. You’re no distance away from her, for a start. And she is your
Mother’s sister. I’m sure if you didn’t go she’d wonder what was the matter. If you’re
afraid of the heat, why don’t you go first thing in the morning, when it’s still cool? All
you need do is make your kotow and drink a cup of tea, and then you can come back
again. Surely that would be more civil?’
‘Of course you must go!’ said Dai-yu, before he had time to reply. ‘Surely you owe a
visit to the person who saved you from the mosquitoes?’
‘What mosquitoes?’ said Bao-yu, mystified. ‘What are you talking about?’
Aroma proceeded to tell him how Bao-chai had sat at his bedside with a fly-whisk
beside her while he slept.
‘How frightful!’ Bao-yu was most upset. ‘However did I come to be asleep when
she was there? And I’d got hardly anything on. How disgusting of me!’
After that there was no further question, of course. He would definitely be going over
for his Aunt Xue’s birthday on the morrow.
While the three of them were talking, Xiang-yun came in wearing her going-out
clothes and looking very dressed-up. Her uncle the Marquis’s people had arrived to
fetch her, and she had come to say good-bye. Bao-yu and Dai-yu both rose and
invited her to be seated, but she could not stay, so the two of them accompanied her
through to the front.
Xiang-yun was struggling to hold back her tears, for she dared not show her distress
openly in front of her uncle’s people. The arrival a few moments later of her dear
Bao-chai, who had hurried over specially to see her off, made going back seem even
more unbearable. Fortunately Bao-chai, always more perceptive than the others,
realized that things would become even more difficult for Xiang-yun if the servants
who had come to collect her were to tell her aunt when they got back that she had
made a fuss, so she did all she could to hasten her departure.
The two girls and Bao-yu saw Xiang-yun as far as the inner gate. Bao-yu would have
gone further, but Xiang-yun re?strained him. Nevertheless, when she had gone a
little way towards her carriage, she changed her mind and, turning back, called him
to her so that she could whisper a parting request in his ear.
‘Remind Her Old Ladyship of me from time to time, will you, in case she forgets?
Then perhaps she’ll send someone to invite me over again.’
Bao-yu gave vigorous assurances that he would do this for her, then, when they had
seen her get into her carriage, they all turned and went in again.
As to what followed, that must be looked for in the follow?ing chapter.
CHAPTER 37

A happy inspiration prompts Tan-chun to found the
Crab-flower Club
And an ingenious arrangement enables Bao-chai to settle the
chrysanthemum poem titles



THIS year Jia Zheng was appointed Commissioner for Edu?cation in one of the
provinces, with instructions to leave for his tour of duty on the twentieth of the
eighth month. When the day for his departure arrived, he took leave of his ancestors
in the family shrine, kotowed to his mother, and was seen on his way as far as the
hostelry of the ‘Tearful Parting’ (the first post-halt on his journey) by Bao-yu and
other junior male members of the clan.
Jia Zheng’s doings after his departure are not recorded in this history; we merely
observe that the departure left Bao-yu free to play and idle in the Garden to his
heart’s content witout the least fear of restraint or reprisal.

The days in idleness passed by
To swell the tale of wasted years

On the day of which we write Bao-yu was feeling very bored. He had returned from
perfunctory morning calls on his mother and grandmother and had just finished
changing back into his everyday clothes, when Tan-chun’s maid Ebony arrived
carrying a carefully-folded letter from her mistress.
‘I’m glad you’ve come,’ said Bao-yu, as she handed him the letter. ‘I’d been meaning
to see your mistress this morning, but I forgot. How is she? Is she any better?’
‘She’s quite better, thank you,’ said Ebony. ‘She’s stopped taking her medicine today.
It was only a slight chill that she was suffering from.’
Bao-yu unfolded the elegant patterned notepaper and glanced at the contents:
Dear Brother,
Some nights ago, when the moon came out in a sky freshly clear after the rain, the
garden seemed veritably awash with moonlight, and sleep in the face of so rare a
spectacle was unthinkable. Thrice the clepsydra had been turned, and still I lingered
beneath the tall paulownias, reluctant to go in. But in the end the treacherous night
air betrayed me, and by morning I was lamentably indisposed.
How kind of you to have visited me in my sickroom! and how exquisitely thoughtful
to have sent your maid-servant shortly after?wards with solicitous inquiries and with
those delicious lychees and the calligraphy by Yan Zhen-qing!
While I have been lying here quietly on my own, I have been thinking how in the
olden days even men whose lives were spent amidst the burly-burly of public affairs
would keep some quiet retreat for themselves with its tiny corner of mountain and
trickle of running water; and how they would seek, by whatever arts and
blandishments they knew of, to assemble there a little group of kindred spirits to
share in their enjoyment of it; and how, on the basis of such leisure-time associations,
rhymers’ guilds and poetry clubs were then founded, so that the fleeting inspirations
of an idle hour might often be perpetuated in imperishable masterpieces of verse.
Now although I am no poet myself, I am privileged to live ‘midst rocks and streams’
and in the company of such gifted practitioners of the poetic art as Xue and Lin; and
it seems to me a great pity that the romantic courts and pavilions of our Garden
should not echo with the jocund carousal of assembled bards, and its flowering
groves and blossoming banksides not become places of wine and song. Why should
the founding of poetry clubs be the sole preroga?tive of the whiskered male, and
female versificators allowed a voice in the tunable concert of the muses only when
some enlightened patriarch sees fit to invite them?
Will you come, then, and rhyme with us? The pathway to my door is swept to receive
you and your arrival is eagerly awaited by
                                                         Your affectionate Sister,
                                                                        Tan-chun

When Bao-yu had finished reading, he clapped his hands delightedly.
‘Dear Tan-chun! Bless her poetic soul! I must go and dis?cuss this with her straight
away.’
He strode off immediately, with Ebony following at his heels. But he had got no
further than Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when he saw one of the old nannies on
duty at the back gate of the Garden hurrying from the opposite direction with a note
in her hand. She came up to him when she saw who he was and handed him the
note.
‘From Mr Yun, sir. He’s waiting at the back gate. He sends his compliments and says
would I please give you this.’
Bao-yu opened it and read.

Dear Father,
I have the Honour to present my Humble Duty and hope this finds you as it leaves me
in the Best of health, ever since you did me the great Kindness to recognize me as
your Son I have been looking for some means of showing my appreciation of your
great kindness but so far no opportunity has presented itself, to date. However,
thanks to your esteemed Advice I have got to know several Nur?serymen also a
number of famous gardens and now through this contacts I have come across a very
rare Variety of autumn crab flower (Pure White) only very little to be had, but using
every means possible I have got two pots of it I hope you will think of me as a real
Son and not refuse to keep them for your enjoyment. However, owing to the present
Hot Weather I did not like to call in Person as the Young Ladies are outside in the
Garden a lot owing to the heat, and not wishing to give Inconvenience
I remain,
       Honoured Father,
Your Dutifully and Affected Son,
                          Jia Yun

Bao-yu laughed when he had finished reading it.
‘Is he alone?’ he asked the old woman, ‘or is there someone with him?’
‘He’s got a couple of young chaps with him carrying potted plants.’
‘I see. Well go back and thank him for me. Tell him it’s very kind of him and I very
much appreciate it. And have the pots taken to my room.’
When he had given these instructions, he continued with Ebony on his way to
Autumn Studio. He arrived to find that Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Ying-chun and Xi-chun had
all got there before him. They laughed excitedly when they saw him enter.
‘Here comes another one!’
‘I hadn’t realized that I was so popular!’ said Tan-chun. ‘I wrote to you all more or
less on the spur of the moment. It was no more than a tentative suggestion. I had no
idea it would meet with this instant response from everybody.’
‘It’s a pity you didn’t think of it earlier,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We ought to have started a
club long ago.’
‘Well I don’t think it’s a pity,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Do, by all means, have a poetry club if
you’re all so keen to, only count me out of it, please. I don’t feel up to it.’
Ying-chun laughed.
‘If you’re not, then what about the rest of us?’
‘This is no time for false modesty,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Here is a serious proposition and
one which we are obviously all enthu?siastic about. What we need are some ideas
that we can all discuss. Come on, Chai! Let’s hear what you have got to say first, then
perhaps we can hear from Cousin Lin.’
‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bao-chai. ‘We’re not even all here yet.’
Just as she was saying that, Li Wan arrived. She smiled at them all as she entered.
‘My! What a poetic lot we are! If you are going to have a poetry club, may I
propose myself for president? The idea of having one did in fact occur to me earlier
in the year, but I thought that as I can’t write poetry myself, a proposal coming from
me might seem a bit presumptuous, and I did nothing about it. Now that my poetical
sister-in-law has had the same idea, I should like to do what I can to help her get it
started.’
‘If we are definitely going to have a poetry club,’ said Dai-yu, ‘then as members of
the club we are all equals and fellow-poets. We can’t go on calling ourselves “cousin”
and “sister-in-law” all the time;’
‘I quite agree,’ said Li Wan. ‘We ought to choose pen?names to sign our poems
with, then we can use them for addressing each other by as well. I shall call myself
“Farmer Sweet-rice”. I don’t suppose anyone else will want that title.’
‘I shall call myself “Autumn Studio”,’ said Tan-chun.
‘That’s pretty unoriginal!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Can’t you do any better than that? You’ve
got all those paulownias and plantain-trees around your place: can’t you make a
name out of them?’
‘All right,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I’m very fond of my plantains. I shall call myself “Under
the Plantains”.’
‘That’s very original,’ said the others admiringly. But Dai-yu laughed.
‘Come on, everybody!’ she said. ‘Pop her in the stew-pot! We’ll have a nice piece of
venison with our wine.’
As no one could understand this recondite joke, Dai-yu undertook to explain it for
them.
“Under the plantains” is where the woodcutter in the old Taoist parable hid the
deer he had killed; so the allusion means “a deer”. In calling herself by that
pen-name, Cousin Tan is therefore offering herself to her fellow-members as venison
for them to feast on in their carousals.’
‘Oh, all right, Miss Clever！’ said Tan-chun. “   ‘Plantain Lover”, then. You wait! I’
ll be even with you yet. I’ve got just the name for her,’ she told the others. ‘When
the Emperor Shun died, his two queens are supposed to have gone along the banks
of the river Xiang looking for him. According to the legend, the two queens turned
into river goddesses and their tears became the spots you find on the bamboos that
grow along the banks of the river. That’s why there’s a kind of bamboo called “Naiad’s
Tears”. Well now, Cousin Dai lives in the Naiad’s House, and she cries so much that I
shouldn’t be at all surprised if one of these days the bamboos in her courtyard all
turned out to have spots on them; so I think the best pen-name for her would be
“River Queen”.’
The others, applauding, agreed that this was exactly the tight name for Dai-yu. Dai-yu
herself hung her head and said nothing.
‘I’ve thought of one for Bao-chai,’ said Li Wan. ‘Not regal, like Dai-yu’s, but
aristocratic, at any rate. What do you all think of “Lady All-spice”?’
‘I think the title becomes her very well,’ said Tan-chun.
‘What about me?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Isn’t anyone going to think of a name for me?’
‘Oh, you!’ said Bao-chai. ‘The obvious one for you is “Busybody” — because you
are always so busy doing nothing.’
‘Why not stick to your old pen-name, “Lord of the Flowers”?’ said Li Wan.
‘Do you have to embarrass me by reminding me of my youthful indiscretions?’ said
Bao-yu.
‘No, let me choose your name,’ said Bao-chai, ‘Actually I’ve already thought of one.
It sounds a bit common, perhaps, but I think it suits you. You are a very lucky person,
living in such luxurious and beautiful surroundings and you enjoy an exceptional
amount of leisure—in fact, I can’t think of anyone who combines quite so much luck
with quite so much leisure—so I suggest “Lucky Lounger” as the most suitable
pen-name for you.’
Bao-yu laughed good-humouredly.
‘You are flattering me! I think you’d better all call me by whatever name each of
you fancies.’
‘No, that won’t do,’ said Dai-yu. ‘As you live in the House of Green Delights, why
don’t we simply call you “Green Boy”?’
‘Yes,’ said the others. ‘Good.’
‘Now, what names are we going to have for Cousin Ying and Cousin Xi?’ said Li
Wan.
‘Neither of us is much good at poetry,’ said Ying-chun. ‘There doesn’t seem much
point in having any.’
‘No, I think you ought to have pen-names,’ said Tan-chun.
‘As Ying-chun lives on Amaryllis Eyot, she could be “Amaryllis Islander”, and as
Xi-chun lives by the Lotus Pavilion, she could be “Lotus Dweller”,’ said Bao-chai. ‘That
would seem to be the simplest solution.’
‘Yes,’ said Li Wan. ‘Those names will do very nicely. Now, I’m the eldest here, so I’m
going to propose some conditions that I’d like you all to agree to. I don’t think you’ll
have much difficulty in doing so when you’ve heard what they are. The first one is
that as three out of the seven of us founding this club—that’s to say Cousin Ying,
Cousin Xi and myself—are no good at writing poetry, I propose that the rest of you
should let us off versifying and allow us to act as your officers instead.’
‘“Cousin Ying”? “Cousin Xi”?’ said Tan-chun. ‘What’s the good of inventing all these
new names if you’re not going to use them? I think that from now on there ought to
be a penalty for not using them.’
‘First things first,’ said Li Wan. ‘Let’s get the club properly founded, and we can talk
about penalties later on. I suggest that the club should hold its meetings at my place,
because I’ve got the most room. I can’t write poetry myself, but if you don’t object to
having so illiterate a person as your host, I’m sure that as time goes by I shall grow
more poetical and re?fined under your influence.
‘My next condition is that you should make me your presi?dent. And as I shan’t be
able to manage all the official business on my own, I should like to be allowed to
co-opt two vice-presidents. I therefore nominate Amaryllis Islander and Lotus
Dweller as my assistants, one to set the themes and rhymes in our competitions and
the other to act as invigilator and copyist.
‘And lastly, although we three officers don’t have to do any versifying, we should
not be precluded from trying our hand at it if we want to. So if there is ever a fairly
simple subject with easy rhymes and we feel like joining in, we should be allowed to
do so. The rest of you, of course, have no option.
‘Well, those are my conditions. If you agree to them, I’ll be glad to help you found
the club. If not, I don’t think there would really be much point in my tagging along.’
The proposed arrangement was highly agreeable to Ying-?chun and Xi-chun, neither
of whom had much enthusiasm for writing poetry—least of all in competition with
experts like Bao-chai and Dai-yu—and they assented readily. The rest, when they saw
how willingly Ying-chun and Xi-chun acquiesced, felt that they could scarcely object
themselves and added their assent— though Tan-chun did remark, somewhat
ruefully, that it seemed a little hard, when she was the one who had thought of the
idea in the first place, that she should now have these other three sitting in
judgement over her.
‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s all settled. Let’s all move over to Sweet-rice Village,
then.’
‘You’re always in such a hurry!’ said Li Wan. ‘Today’s meeting is just a preliminary
discussion. Now you will have to wait for me to issue an invitation.’
‘Before we do anything else,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we had better decide how often we
are going to meet.’
‘Not too often, I hope,’ said Tan-chun, ‘otherwise it will no longer be a pleasure. I
suggest not more than two or three times a month.’
‘Twice a month will be quite enough,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Once we’ve decided which
two days to meet on, we should under-take always to turn up on those two days, wet
or fine. At the same time, we should be allowed to arrange additional meet?ings
outside the fixed dates as and when the fancy takes any of us to do so. If we leave it
that much flexible, it will be more enjoyable.’
The others agreed that this was a good proposal and should be adopted.
‘The poetry club was originally my idea,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I hope you will at least
allow me the pleasure of being your hostess at its first meeting.’
‘All right,’ said Li Wan. ‘We’ll have a meeting tomorrow and you shall entertain us,’
Why wait until tomorrow?’ said Tan-chun. ‘There’s no time like the present. You
choose a title for us, Amaryllis Islander can set the rhymes, and Lotus Dweller can
supervise us while we compose our poems.’
‘If you ask me,’ said Ying-chun, ‘I think that rather than always have the same two
people to choose the titles and set the rhymes, it would be better to draw lots.’
‘As I was on my way here just now,’ said Li Wan, ‘I saw them carrying in two pots of
white crab-blossom. It was so pretty. Couldn’t you have white crab-blossom for your
sub?ject?’
‘We haven’t all seen it yet,’ said Ying-chun. ‘How are they going to write poems
about it if they haven’t seen it?’
‘We all know what white crab-blossom looks like,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t see why
we necessarily have to look at it in order to be able to write a poem about it. The
ancients used a poetic theme as a vehicle for whatever feelings they happened to
want to express at that particular moment. If they’d waited until they’d seen the
objects they were supposed to be writing about, the poems would never have got
written!’
‘Very well, then, I’ll set your rhymes,’ said Ying-chun.
She took a book of verse off the shelf, opened it at random, and held it up for the
others to see.
‘There you are: an octet in Regulated Verse. That’s the form.’
She closed the book again and turned to a little maid who was leaning in the
doorway looking on.
‘Give us a word,’ she said. ‘Any word.’
‘Door,’ said the girl.
‘That means the first line must end with “door”,’ said Ying-chun. She turned again
to the girl: ‘Another one.’
‘Pot,’ said the girl.
‘Right, “pot”,’ said Ying-chun, and going over to a little nest of drawers in which
rhyme-cards were kept, she pulled out one of them and asked the maid to select two
cards from it at random. These turned out to be the cards for ‘not’ and ‘spot’.
‘Now,’ she said to the girl, ‘pick any card out of any drawer. Just one.’
The girl pulled out another drawer and picked out the card for ‘day’.
‘All right,’ said Ying-chun. ‘That means that your first line must end in “door”, your
second in “pot”, your fourth in “not”, your sixth in “spot”, and the rhyming couplet in
the seventh and eighth lines must end in “day”.’
Tan-chun’s maid Scribe laid out four identical sets of brushes and paper for the
competitors, who all, except Dai-yu, now began, with quiet concentration, to
consider what they were going to write. Dai-yu wandered around outside, playing
with the bark of the paulownia trees, admiring the signs of autumn in the garden,
occasionally joking with the maids, and in general not giving the slightest indication
that she was engaged in the throes of composition. Ying-chun told one of the maids
to light a stick of Sweet Dreams—a kind of incense which is only about three inches
long and has a very thick wick so that it burns down fairly rapidly - and told the
competitors that they had to complete their poems by the time the incense had
burned itself out, otherwise they would be penalized.
Tan-chun soon had a poem ready. Taking up a brush, she wrote it out and, after going
over it and making a few cor?rections, handed it in to Ying-chun. Then she turned to
Bao-chai.
‘How are you doing, Lady All-spice? Have you thought of a poem yet?’
‘Well—yes, I’ve thought of something,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I’m not very happy about
it.’
Bao-yu, meanwhile, was pacing up and down, hands clasped behind his back, in the
loggia outside. Hearing this exchange, he paused to address Dai-yu.
‘Do you hear that?’ he said. ‘The other two have nearly finished.’
‘Kindly mind your own business, would you?’ said Dai-yu. Bao-yu glanced inside
and saw that Bao-chai was busy writ?ing her poem down.
‘Lord!’ he said. ‘There’s only an inch left.’ He turned to Dai-yu again: ‘The incense
has nearly burned out. What are you still squatting over there on the damp grass
for?’
Dai-yu ignored him.
‘Oh well,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I haven’t got time to worry about you. I’ll have to start
writing my own now, whether it’s any good or not.’
He went in then, and sat down at the table to write.
‘I’m going to start reading the poems now,’ said Li Wan. ‘Anyone who hasn’t handed
in by the time I’ve finished read?ing will have to pay a fine.’
‘Farmer Sweet-rice may not be much good at writing poetry,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but she
is jolly good at reading it. She’s a very fair critic. I’m sure we shall all be willing to
accept her judgement.’ The others nodded in agreement. Li Wan picked up
Tan-?chun’s draft and the others crowded round to read it with her:

             A wintry sunset gilds the vine-wreathed door
             Where stands, mossed by old rains, the flower-pot.
             Its snowy blooms, as snow impermanent,
             Are pure as pure white jade that alters not.
             O fragrant frailty, that so fears the wind!
             Most radiant whiteness! Pull moon without spot!
             White flower-sprite, shake your silken wings! Away!
             And join with me to hymn the dying day!

All complimented Tan-chun on her poem when they had finished reading it. Then
they looked at Bao-chai’s:

             Guard the sweet scent behind closed courtyard door,
             And with prompt waterings dew the mossy pot!
             The carmine hue their summer sisters wore
             These snowy autumn blossoms envy not—
             Pot beauty in plain whiteness best appears,
             And only in white jade is found no spot.
             Chaste, lovely flowers! Silent, they seem to pray
             To autumn’s White God at the close of day.

Li Wan smiled.
‘That has the All-spice touch all right!’ Next they looked at Bao-yu’s poem.

             White Autumn’s sister stands beside the door;
             Like summer snow her blossoms till the pot—
             A Yang-fei rising naked from the bath,
             With a cool, chaste allure that she had not.
             The dawn wind could not dry those pearly tears
             With which night’s rain each floweret’s eye did spot.
             Pensive and grave, her blossoms gently sway,
             While a sad flute laments the dying day!

When they had finished reading, Bao-yu said he liked Tan-?chun’s poem best of the
three, but Li Wan insisted that Bao?-chai’s was superior. It had ‘more character’ she
said. She was about to press Dai-yu for her contribution when Dai-yu sauntered in of
her own volition.
‘Oh! have you all finished?’
She picked up a brush and proceeded, writing rapidly and without a pause, to set
down the poem that was already com?pleted in her mind. She wrote on the first
sheet of paper that came to hand and, having finished, threw it nonchalantly across
the table for the others to inspect.

             Beside the half-raised blind, the half-closed door,
             Crushed ice for earth and white jade for the pot,

They had got no further than the first couplet, when Bao-yu broke out into praises.
‘Clever! How do you get these ideas?’

             Three parts of whiteness from the pear-tree stolen,
             One part from plum for scent (which pear has not)—

All of them were impressed by this second couplet.
‘This is good. Original. It’s quite different from the other three.’
            Moon-maidens stitched them with white silken thread,
            And virgins’ tears the new-made flowers did spot,
            Which now, like bashful maids that no word say,
            Lean languid on the breeze at close of day.


‘Yes, this is the best,’ they said. ‘This is the best of the four.’
‘For elegance and originally, yes,’ said Li Wan; ‘but for character and depth I prefer
Lady All-spice’s.’
‘I think that’s a fair judgement,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I think River Queen’s has to take
second place.’
‘At all events,’ said Li Wan, ‘Green Boy’s is bottom. Do you accept that judgement,
Green Boy?’
‘Oh yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s a perfectly fair one. Mine is just not a good poem. But’ —
he smiled hopefully —‘I think we ought to reconsider the placing of All-spice’s and
River Queen’s contributions.’
‘You agreed to abide by my decisions,’ said Li Wan. ‘I don’t think the rest of you
have any say in the matter. If anyone questions a decision of mine in future, he will
have to pay a penalty.’
Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter drop.
‘I propose that our two meetings should be on the second and sixteenth of each
month,’ said Li Wan. ‘On those occasions I shall be responsible for choosing the
subjects and the rhymes. If any of you ever feels like having an extra meeting in
be?tween those dates, there’s nothing to stop you. In fact, there’s nothing to stop
you having a meeting every day, if you feel like it. But that’s entirely up to you. On
the second and six?teenth you must all come round to my place, and the meetings
on those two days are my responsibility.’
‘We really ought to have a name for the club,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We don’t want anything
banal,’ said Tan-chun; ‘on the other hand we don’t want anything too weird and
wonderful. As we started off with a poem about white crab-blossom, why don’t we
simply call ourselves “The Crab-flower Club”? That might have seemed a somewhat
banal title other things being equal, but in our case it wouldn’t be because it would
com?memorate our founding meeting.’
Tan-chun’s proposal was followed by general discussion. After partaking of the liquid
and other refreshment which she provided, the party then broke up, some returning
to their own apartments in the Garden, some going on to Grand?mother Jia’s or Lady
Wang’s apartments outside. Our record leaves them at this point and does not
specify.

*

Aroma had been present when Bao-yu received Tan-chun’s letter and had seen him
rush off excitedly with Ebony as soon as he had finished reading it, but without
having any idea what the cause of his excitement might be. Shortly after he left, two
of the old women from the back gate arrived carrying pots of white-flowering
autumn crab. Aroma asked them who the flowers were from, and when the old
women had explained, showed them where she wanted them put, after which she
took them into the servants’ quartets and made them sit down while she went off to
Bao-yu’s room to fetch some money. She weighed out twelve penny-weights of silver
and made it into a little parcel, then, taking out an additional three hundred copper
cash, hurried back to the old women.
‘The silver is to pay the beaters with,’ she told them as she handed them the money.
‘The cash is for you to buy yourselves a drink with.’
The old women stood up, beaming all over their faces. How kind, how very kind, they
said, they couldn’t possibly take it. But as Aroma insisted, they allowed themselves to
be persuaded.
‘Are there any boys on duty outside the gate?’ Aroma asked them.
‘Oh yes, there are always four there,’ said the old women, ‘to do any errands you
young ladies in the Garden happen to want done outside. If there’s anything you
want done, Miss, just let us know and we’ll get them to do it for you.’
‘It isn’t for me,’ said Aroma smiling. ‘I wouldn’t presume. It’s Master Bao. He wants
someone to go to the Marquis of Zhong-jing’s place to deliver some things to Miss
Shi. I thought that now you’re here I might as well ask you if you wouldn’t mind when
you get back telling the boys on the gate to go out and order a cab for me. Only if
they do, will you come to me for the fare, please. Don’t go bothering them in the
front about it.’
The old women departed, promising to do as she asked, while Aroma went back into
the main apartment for a saucer to put some of the things on that she was planning
to send to Xiang-yun. But when she looked on the dresser she found that the saucer
shelf was completely empty. She glanced back to where Skybright, Ripple and Musk
sat sewing together.
‘What happened to that white onyx saucer that used to be here ’ she asked them.
The girls looked at each other blankly, trying to remember. After some moments,
Skybright’s face broke into a smile.
‘I remember. I took it to Miss Tan’s with those lychees on. It’s still there.’
‘Whatever did you take that one for, when there are so many other things you
could have used?’
‘Well, yes, that’s what I said. But the dark brown lychees and the white-and-browny
onyx did go very well together. Even Miss Tan said how pretty they looked. She made
me leave the dish there, where she could look at it. That’s why I didn’t bring it back
with me. By the way, that pair of identical vases that used to be on the very top of
the dresser isn’t back yet, either.’
‘You’ll laugh if I tell you about them,’ said Ripple. ‘You know how Master Bao never
does anything by halves. Well, the other day he had a sudden rush of dutiful feelings
come over him. He’d just picked a couple of sprays of cassia and was going to put
them in a vase, when suddenly he said, “Oh! these are the first cassia flowers I’ve
picked this year. I mustn’t keep them for my own enjoyment.” So what does he do
but fetch down those two vases, put the water in them and arrange the flowers in
them himself, and go along with them (someone else carrying them, of course) to
Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship to give them each a vase. Anyway, the beauty of it
was that some of the effects of this rubbed off on the person carrying the
vases—which it so happens was me. When Her Old Ladyship saw the flowers, she
was so delighted you just can’t imagine. “Oh, look!” she said. “What a good boy he is
to me! He can’t even see a flower without thinking of his old grannie! — And people
grumble at me for being too fond of him!” Well, as I expect you know, Her Old
Ladyship normally doesn’t seem to have much use for me—I don’t know what it is,
but there’s something about me she doesn’t seem to like—but on this occasion she
gave me a hundred cash. And she called me a “poor little thing”. “Poor little thing!”
she said. “She looks so sickly! “ I can tell you, I never expected a piece of luck like that!
I mean, a hundred cash is nothing, but the honour! - in front of all those people!
Then when we got to Her Ladyship’s, Her Ladyship was with Mrs Lian and Mrs Zhao
going through her chests and looking out some of the things she used to wear when
she was a girl to give to someone — I don’t know who it was. Anyway, when she saw
us, she left off to admire the flowers. So of course Mrs Lian has to make the most of it
by putting in her pennyworth going on about how dutiful Master Bao is and how
thoughtful and how this that and the other I can’t remember a half of what she said,
there was a whole cartload of it - but whatever it was it gave Her Ladyship a lot of
face, hearing him praised like that in front of everybody, and You Know Who not
being able to say a word against him, so of course she was very pleased. And what do
you think? She gave me two dresses! Admittedly, we get new dresses every year, so
in itself being given two dresses may not seem so wonderful. But the honour!’
‘Pooh!’ said Skybright. ‘Silly girl! You don’t know much! Those would be two
dresses that she thought weren’t good enough to give to the other person. I can’t see
much honour in that!’
‘I don’t care,’ said Ripple. ‘It was still very kind of Her Ladyship, for all that.’
‘If it had been me, I shouldn’t have wanted them,’ said Skybright. ‘What? take
someone else’s old left-overs? All of us here are only maids; none of us is supposed
to be any higher than the rest, you know. Why should she give someone else the best
and give me the left-overs? No, I’m sorry. I should have had to refuse, even if it
meant offending her. I couldn’t take a thing like that lying down!’
‘Which of us was it that she gave those other dresses to?’ said Ripple, curious. ‘I’ve
been home ill these last few days. I must have been away when it happened. Be a
sport, Skyey — tell us who it was!’
‘Why, if I tell you, will you give those dresses back again?’
‘Of course not, silly! I’d just like to know,’ said Ripple. ‘I don’t care if it was Master
Bao’s little puppy-dog she gave them to, I still think Her Ladyship meant to do me a
kindness, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s all that matters.’
The other maids laughed.
‘You’d better watch what you say! That’s just who she did give them to: Master
Bao’s little dog, Flower.’
‘Wicked girls!’ said ‘Flowers’ Aroma, laughing in spite of herself, ‘taking my name in
vain! Whenever you’ve got a few moments to spare you are making fun of me.
There’s not one of you that will come to a good end!’
‘Oh, it was you,’ said Ripple. ‘I’m go sorry, I didn’t realize. Oh, I do apologize.’
‘All right, that’s enough fooling for now,’ said Aroma. ‘The question is, which of you
is going to get that saucer?’
‘Better get the vases back too, while we’re about it,’ said Musk. ‘The one in Her Old
Ladyship’s room should be safe enough, but I wouldn’t be too sure about the one at
Her Ladyship’s. There are so many people in and out of that place - especially You
Know Who and her lot. If they see anything from our room in there, they’re sure to
find some way of breaking it accidentally-on-purpose, if they get half a chance. Her
Ladyship won’t stop them. She never notices. We ought to get that one back, at least,
as soon as we can.’
‘You’re right,’ said Skybright, laying down her sewing. ‘I’ll go and get it now.’
‘No, I’ll go for that,’ said Ripple. ‘You go and get your saucer.’
‘I’m going for the vase,’ said Skybright. ‘Why should you have all the windfalls? You
others have all had a go. Now it’s my turn.’
‘You do exaggerate,’ said Musk. ‘It’s only Ripple who’s had the luck. And it was only
because of the coincidence that Her Ladyship happened to be going through her
dresses when she arrived. Do you suppose she’ll be going through them again if you
go there now?’
‘Maybe not,’ said Skybright, with a tinge of malice. ‘On the other hand maybe she’ll
notice how conscientious I am and pay me two taels a month out of her allowance.
You see’ — she paused to add this on her way out of the room —‘I know what goes
on in here. There’s no need for the play-acting.’
She ran off with a mocking laugh.
Ripple went, too, and fetched the onyx saucer from Tan-?chun’s room, after which
Aroma made ready the things that were to go to Xiang-yun, and called in old Mamma
Song - one of the nannies attached to Green Delights — to give her in?structions for
their delivery.
‘Get yourself smartened up and change into your best things,’ she said. ‘I want you
to go out presently and take some things for me to Miss Shi’s.’
‘You can give them to me now, Miss — and any message that you want me to
deliver,’ said Mamma Song; ‘then I can go off straight away, as soon as I’ve got myself
ready.’
Aroma fetched two little boxes of lacquer and bamboo basketwork and taking the
tops off them, put foxnuts and caltrops in one and a saucerful of chestnut fudge
(made of chestnut puree steam-cooked with cassia-flavored sugar) in the other.
‘These are all our own things or made from our own things freshly gathered in the
Garden that Master Bao is sending Miss Shi a taste of,’ she said. ‘Tell her the onyx
saucer the fudge is on is the one she was admiring last time she was here and she is
to keep it. This silk bag has got the sewing in that she asked me to do for her. Tell her
the needlework’s a bit on the rough side, but I’m sure she’ll understand. And say
Master Bao sends his regards. And of course I present my compliments. I think that’s
all.’
‘Isn’t there any message from Master Bao?’ said Mamma Song. ‘Perhaps you’d
better ask him, Miss, just in case. We don’t want him saying afterwards that we’ve
forgotten some?thing.’
‘Didn’t he go round just now to Miss Tan’s place?’ Aroma asked Ripple.
‘Yes,’ said Ripple. ‘They’re all round there. They were having a discussion about
setting up a poetry club, what?ever that might be, and they were writing poems,
some of them.’ She turned to Mamma Song. ‘I shouldn’t think he’d have anything to
say. I should just push on, if I were you.’
Mamma Song took up the boxes and went off to get herself ready.
‘When you are ready, go out by the back gate,’ said Aroma as she was leaving.
‘You’ll find some of the boys there and a cab waiting for you.’
Mamma Song then left. The details of her expedition are unrecorded.

*

Some time after this Bao-yu got back. The first thing he did on arrival was to go and
look at the autumn crab-flowers. When he had finished admiring them, he went into
the house and told Aroma all about the poetry club, after which Aroma told him how
she had sent Mamma Song to Shi Xiang-yun’s with a present of things from the
Garden. Bao-yu smote his palms together in vexation.
‘Oh, we forgot about her! I knew there was something we ought to have done and
hadn’t, but I couldn’t think what it was. I’m glad you’ve reminded me. We must invite
her over at once, of course. The poetry club will be nothing without her in it.’
‘I don’t think I’d be in such a hurry to, if I were you,’ said Aroma. ‘It’s only an
amusement, this poetry thing, and Miss Shi doesn’t have the time for amusement
that the rest of you do. It isn’t as if she were her own mistress, you know. Even if you
tell her about this and she wants to come, it doesn’t follow that they’ll let her.
Suppose they don’t. She’ll only fret about it; and then all you’ll have done will be to
have made her feel miserable for nothing.’
‘That’s no problem,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shall ask Her Old Ladyship to have her fetched.’
Just then Mamma Song got back, mission completed, bear?ing Xiang-yun’s thanks to
Aroma for the things.
‘She asked me what Master Bao was doing,’ said the nannie, ‘so I told her that he
and the young ladies were starting a poetry club or some such. She was very upset.
“Oh!” she said, “are they writing poetry? I wish they’d have told me about it!”’
Bao-yu waited to hear no more. Dashing round to his grandmother’s, he insisted that
she should send instantly to have Xiang-yun fetched.
‘It’s too late now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We’ll send for her first thing tomorrow.’
Bao-yu had to be content with that, and went back to his room much downcast. He
was round at Grandmother Jia’s first thing next morning again, pestering; but it was
not until the early afternoon that Xiang-yun eventually arrived and his equanimity
was restored.
As soon as they were all together, Bao-yu began to tell Xiang-yun how the club had
come to be founded and what they had done at its first meeting. He was about to
show her the poems that they had written, but Li Wan prevented him.
‘Don’t let her see them yet,’ she said. ‘Just tell her the rhymes. As she missed our
first meeting, her penalty shall be to make up another poem now, using the same
rhymes that we did. If it’s all right, we shall invite her to join the club straight away. If
not, she must first entertain us all at our next meeting as a further penalty.’
‘I like that!’ said Xiang-yun, laughing. ‘You should be the ones to pay a penalty, for
having forgotten to invite me. Well, show me the rhymes, then. I’m not much good at
this sort of thing, but I don’t mind making a fool of myself. As long as you’ll let me
join your club, I don’t mind what I have to do sweep the floor and light the incense
for you, if you like!’
Delighted to see her so enthusiastic, and still reproaching themselves for having
forgotten about her at their inaugural meeting, the rest of them made haste to give
her the rhyme-words so that she could begin.
Xiang-yun was much too excited for careful composition. Having, even while they
were all talking, concocted a number of verses in her head, she took up a brush and
proceeded to write them down, without a single pause for correction, on the first
piece of paper that came to hand.
‘There you are!’ she said, handing it to the others. ‘I’ve written two poems using
the rhymes you gave me. I don’t know whether they’re any good or not, but at least I
have done what was told!’
‘We thought our four had just about scraped the barrel,’ they told her. ‘We couldn’t
have written one more poem on the subject, let alone two! Whatever can you have
found to say in them? I bet they just repeat what we said in ours.’
But when they looked at the poems, this is what they read.

                  Of late a goddess came down to my door
                  And planted seeds of white jade in a pot,
                  From which a wondrous white Frost Maiden grew,
                  Who, loving cold, all other things loves not.
                  Last night a cloud passed by, whose autumn shower
                  Her cold, unweeping eyes with tears did spot;
                 Since when, the poet here takes up his stay,
                 To praise her loveliness by night and day.

                 Where flower-fringed steps approach the ivied door,
                 At the wall’s foot or in a graceful pot—
                 What flowers do more sad autumn-thoughts inspire
                 Than these, whose pureness others rival not?
                 Wax teats their petals seem, by wind congealed,
                 Or filtered moonlight, flecked with many a spot.
                 Weep they because the shadows stole away
                 Their goddess-queen, who now makes dark night day?

The reading of these poems was punctuated at the end of each line with expressions
of admiration and surprise, and when they had got to the end, all of them agreed
that these two poems had made the exercise a worth-while one and fully justified
their naming the new society ‘The Crab-flower Club’.
‘You must let me provide the refreshments tomorrow as my penalty,’ said
Xiang-yun. ‘I hope you will all consent to be my guests.’
‘Splendid!’ they said; and proceeded to show her the poems they had written the
day before, and to discuss them with her.

*

That evening Bao-chai, who had invited Xiang-yun to spend the night with her at
Allspice Court, sat with her guest under the lamplight while the latter discussed
themes for the mor?row’s meeting and plans for the projected entertainment. As it
became increasingly apparent that her ideas on the subject were quite impracticable,
Bao-chai presently interrupted the flow.
‘The club has only just been founded and this will be its first entertainment,’ she
said. ‘Although it’s all only a game, you are setting a precedent, so you need to think
about it rather carefully. If the entertainment is to be equally enjoyable for everyone,
you don’t want it to be too much of a burden on you; but on the other hand you
don’t want the others to feel that they are being given short commons. Now, you are
not your own mistress, and the few strings of cash they give you a month at home
are not even enough for your own needs. And if your Aunt got to hear that you were
spending money on a frivolous thing like this, she would have still more to grumble
about than usual. In any case, even if you spent all you’d got, it still wouldn’t be
enough to provide an entertainment for several people. So what are you going to do?
You obviously can’t send home for money. Are you going to ask them here for some?’
Xiang-yun, brought back to the realities of her situation, was very much dashed.
While she hesitated, Bao-chai went on.
‘Actually I’ve thought of a way out of this. An assistant in one of our pawnshops
comes from a place where they have very good crabs. Now nearly everyone here
from Lady Jia and Aunt Wang downwards is fond of crabs and only the other day
Aunt Wang was saying that we ought to have a crab and cassia-viewing party for Lady
Jia. It’s only because she has been otherwise occupied that she hasn’t done anything
about it. Why not issue a general invitation, making no mention of the poetry club —
we can write all the poems we want to after the rest of them have gone — and I shall
ask my brother to let us have a few baskets of the biggest, fattest-looking crabs and
tell him to get us a few jars of good wine and side-dishes for four or five tables from
the shop? That should save a lot of trouble for you and make more of an occasion of
it for every?body else.’
Xiang-yun felt deeply grateful to Bao-chai and praised her warmly for her
thoughtfulness. Bao-chai smiled deprecatingly.
‘Now you mustn’t go imagining things and feel that you are being treated like a
poor relation! It’s only because I am so fond of you that I have ventured to make this
proposal. If you promise you won’t take it amiss, I can get them to arrange it for us
straight away.’
‘My dearest girl!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Of course I shan’t take it amiss! How can you
suggest such a thing? If you do so again, I shall begin to think that you aren’t really
fond of me at all! I may be a silly goose, but there are some things I understand! Do
you think that if I didn’t look on you as my own true sister I should ever have told you
last time I was here about all those tiresome things I have to put up with at home?’
Reassured, Bao-chai called in an old woman to take a mes?sage outside to her
brother.
‘Tell Mr Pan to get us a few baskets of crabs like the ones we had the other day. It’s
for after lunch tomorrow. We’re having a cassia-viewing party in the Garden for Their
Ladyships. Tell him please not to forget, because I’ve already invited all the guests.’
The old woman went off to deliver her message. In due course she reported back
again — but these are details omitted from our story.
Bao-chai resumed her conversation with Xiang-yun.
‘About the theme for tomorrow’s poems,’ she said. ‘We don’t want anything too
outlandish. If you look at the works of the great poets, you find that they didn’t go in
for the weird and wonderful titles and “daring” rhymes that people now?adays are
so fond of. Outlandish themes and daring rhymes do not produce good poetry. They
merely show up the poverty of the writer’s ideas. Certainly one wants to avoid
clichés; but one can easily go too far in the pursuit of novelty. The im?portant thing is
to have fresh ideas. If one has fresh ideas, one does not need to worry about clichés:
the words take care of themselves. But what am I saying all this for? Spinning and
sewing is the proper occupation for girls like us. Any time we have left over from that
should be spent in reading a few pages of some improving book — not on this sort of
thing!’
‘Yes,’ said Xiang-yun, without much conviction; but presently smiled as a new idea
occurred to her.
‘I’ve just thought of something. Yesterday’s theme was “White Crab-blossom”. The
flower I’d like to write about is the chrysanthemum. Couldn’t we have
“Chrysanthemums” as our theme for tomorrow?’
‘It is certainly a very seasonable one,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The trouble is that so many
people have written about it before.’
‘Yes,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘I suppose it is rather a hackneyed one.’
Bao-chai thought for a bit.
‘Unless of course you somehow involved the poet in the theme,’ she said. ‘You
could do that by making up verb-object or concrete-abstract tides in which
“chrysanthemums” was the concrete noun or the object of the verb as the case
might be. Then your poem would be both a celebration of chrysanthemums and at
the same time a description of some action or situation. Such a treatment of the
subject has been tried in the past, but it is a much less hackneyed one. The
combining of narrative and lyrical elements in a single treat?ment makes for
freshness and greater freedom.’
‘It sounds a splendid idea,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘But what sort of verbs or abstract nouns
had you in mind? Can you give me an example?’
Bao-chai thought for a bit.
‘What about “The Dream of the Chrysanthemums”?’
‘Yes, that’s a good one,’ said xiang-yun. ‘I’ve thought of one too. Couldn’t we have
“The Shadow of the Chrysanthe?mums”?’
‘Ye-e-es,’ said Bao-chai, doubtfully. ‘The trouble is, it’s been used before. Still, if we
had a lot of titles we could probably slip it in. I’ve thought of another.’
‘Well, come on then!’ said Xiang-yun.
‘What about “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”?’
Xiang-yun slapped the table appreciatively.
‘That’s a lovely one!’ Presently she added: ‘I’ve thought of another. What do you
think of “Seeking the Chrysanthe?mums”?’
‘That should be interesting,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let’s start making a list. We’ll write
down up to ten titles and then see what we think of them.’
The two of them busied themselves for some minutes grinding ink and softening a
brush. Xiang-yun then proceeded to write down the titles at Ban-chai’s dictation.
Soon they had ten. Xiang-yun read them over.
‘Ten doesn’t make a set,’ she said. ‘We need two more to make a round dozen, then
we shall have just the right number for a little album.’
Ban-chai supplied two more without too much difficulty.
‘If we’re thinking in terms of a sequence of poems,’ she said, ‘we may as well, while
we’re about it, arrange these titles in some sort of order.’
‘ That’s it!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Then they will be all ready for making our
“Chrysanthemum Album” with afterwards.’
“‘Remembering the Chrysanthemums” should come first,’ said Bao-chai.
‘Now, let’s see. When you remember them, you realize you haven’t got any, so you
go and look for some. So “Seeking the Chrysanthemums” will be the second title.
‘ Well, having found some, you will want to plant them; so “Planting the
Chrysanthemums” will be the third title.
‘After you’ve planted them and the flowers have come out, you’ll want to stand
and look at them; so the fourth title will be “Admiring the Chrysanthemums”.
‘You won’t be able to have enough of them by just standing and admiring them, so
you’ll naturally want to pick some and arrange them in a vase so that you can enjoy
them indoors. That means “Arranging the Chrysanthemums” for Number Five.
‘But however much you enjoy them, you will feel that they somehow lack their full
lustre without words to grace them, and so you will want to celebrate them in verse.
That means “Celebrating the Chrysanthemums” will be the sixth title.
‘Well now, let’s suppose you’ve just finished writing some verses about them.
You’ve got the ink ready-made and the brush is still in your hand and you feel like
paying the chrysanthemums a further tribute. What should you do but paint them?
That’s Number Seven. “Painting the Chrysan?themums”.
‘Now in spite of these silent tributes, you still don’t know the secret of the
chrysanthemums’ mysterious charm and you can’t resist asking them. Which brings
us to Number Eight “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”.
‘And if the chrysanthemums could really reply, it would be so delightful that you
would want to have them near you all the time - and how better than by “Wearing
the Chrysanthe?mums”? That’s Number Nine.
‘That brings us to the end of the verb-object titles which involve the poet himself as
the understood subject of the action. But there remain other kinds of treatment, in
which we consider the flowers by themselves without postulating the presence of
the poet. So we have “The Shadow of the Chrysanthemums” and “The Dream of the
Chrysanthe?mums” as Numbers Ten and Eleven.
‘And of course “The Death of the Chrysanthemums” at the end of the album to
round off on a suitable note of melan?choly.
‘There you are! All three months of autumn condensed into a single sequence of a
dozen poems!’
Xiang-yun recopied the twelve titles in the order that Bao?-chai had indicated, then,
after running her eye rapidly over them, she asked Bao-chai what rhyme-scheme
they should set.
‘I have always disliked set rhymes,’ said Bao-chai. ‘If you have a good poem in the
making, why shackle it with the constraints of an arbitrary rhyme-scheme? Let us
leave set rhymes to vulgar pedants; all we need do is give out the titles and let the
others choose their own rhyme-schemes for them?selves. After all, the object of the
exercise is to give people enjoyment—the enjoyment gained by producing an
occasional felicitous line. We aren’t out to make things difficult for them.’
‘I entirely agree,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘And I am sure that in this way we shall get better
poems. There’s just one thing, though: we have twelve titles now but only five
people writing poems. Presumably we aren’t going to ask each of them to produce a
poem for every one of the titles?’
‘Oh no, that would be much too difficult,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Make a fair copy of the list
of titles, merely indicating that the poems are to be octets in Regulated Verse, put it
up on the wall where everyone can see it, and then simply let them choose
whichever titles they like. If anyone has the energy to do them all, they are welcome
to try. If they can’t manage more than one, let them do just one. Skill and speed are
what we shall be looking for. As soon as all of the twelve tides have been covered, we
shall call a halt, and anyone who goes on writing after that will be made to pay a
penalty.’
Xiang-yun did not see that this last stipulation was neces?sary, but otherwise agreed
with her, and the two girls, having satisfied themselves that their plans for the
morrow were now complete, put out the light and composed themselves for sleep.
As to the outcome of their plans: that will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 38

River Queen triumphs in her treatment of chrysanthemum themes
And Lady Allspice is satirical on the subject of crabs



THE last chapter concluded with Ban-chai and Xiang-yun retiring for the night after
their plans for the morrow had been completed. This one begins next morning, when
Xiang-yun invited Grandmother Jia and the rest to a cassia-viewing party in the
Garden. Touched by her enthusiasm, the grown-ups readily agreed to go.
‘She is so excited, bless her!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We ought to let her do this,
even though she is our guest.’
And having promised, she was as good as her word, and arrived in the Garden at
noon, bringing Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and Aunt Xue with her and a number of
attendant maids.
‘Now where is it going to be?’ she asked them.
‘Wherever you like, Mother,’ said Lady Wang dutifully.
‘I think they’ve already prepared for us in the Lotus Pavilion,’ said Xi-feng. ‘The
blossom on the two cassia-trees is particularly line there this year, and there is that
lovely clear, emerald water. When you sit in the little centre pavilion, you have water
all round you, which gives you a wonderful feeling of spaciousness. And looking at
water is so restful for the eyes.’
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia, and began to lead the way to the Lotus Pavilion.
The pavilion was built in the middle of the Garden’s little river at one of the places
where it broadened into a wide, deep pool. It had windows all round it and could be
approached either circuitously from one side by way of one of the two many-angled
covered piers leading to its left and right-hand verandahs, or more directly from the
other by means of a bamboo bridge leading to the centre of the verandah at the back.
It was towards this bamboo bridge that the party was now making its way. As
Grandmother Jia stepped on to it, Xi-feng hurried forward to support her.
‘You can put your feet down as hard as you like, Grannie,’ she said. ‘Bamboo
bridges always creak like this when you go over them. They are meant to.’
The Lotus Pavilion was in reality not one pavilion but two, for the main pavilion
properly so called gave on to a smaller pavilion, referred to simply as ‘the water
pavilion’ or the centre pavilion’, which was in the very middle of the little lake.
When they were all inside the main pavilion, they noticed that two bamboo tables
had been set out on the verandah. On one of them were ranged winecups,
chopsticks and all things needful for serving wine, and on the other were teacups,
tea?pots, tea-whisks, saucers, and various other tea-things. Beside the tea-table two
or three maids were busy fanning a little tri?pod stove on which water for tea-making
was being boiled, while at the other end of the verandah maids were fanning a stove
on which water for warming the wine-kettles was being heated. Grandmother Jia was
particularly impressed by the arrangements for tea-making and remarked with
pleasure how clean everything looked—including the spot that had been chosen for
the party.
‘Cousin Bao-chai helped me get it ready,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Well, I’ve always said she
was a thoughtful child,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘A lot of thought has certainly gone
into these preparations.’
As she was speaking, her eye fell on a pair of boards that hung from two of the pillars.
The couplet inscribed on them was in mother-o’-pearl inlay on a black lacquer
background. She asked Xiang-yun to read it out to her. This is what it said:

             Lotus reflections shatter at the dip of a lazy oar-blade
             Lotus fragrances float up from the swirl round a bamboo bridge-pile

After hearing the couplet, Grandmother Jia glanced up at the horizontal board which
bore the name of the pavilion and was in characters large enough for her to read
herself. She turned to Aunt Xue, who was standing beside her.
‘When I was a girl, there was a pavilion like this one in our garden at home. It was
called—let me see—“Above the Clouds” because of the sky reflected in the water
below, you see. When I was about the same age as these young people are now, I
used to go with the others every day there to play. One day I slipped and fell down
into the water. I nearly drowned. They had a terrible job getting me out. And even
then I caught my head on one of the wooden pegs on the way up. I’ve still got a place
big enough to put the tip of a linger in where it hit me. It’s on the side here, just
where the hair begins. Of course, at the time everyone thought it was all up with me.
They were sure that after being all that time in the water I’d catch my death of cold.
But I got over it.’
‘If you hadn’t,’ said Xi-feng before anyone else could speak, ‘what would have
happened to all the good fortune you’ve enjoyed, Grannie? It’s obvious you were
meant to have it, otherwise why would you have been given that dent in your head?
The guardian spirits must have put it there to store your good fortune in. Old
Longevity has got a dent in his head, too; only his has got so much good fortune
packed into it that it bulges out a bit.’
This comical allusion to the God of Longevity’s enormous cranium set all of them
laughing — including, of course, the old lady herself.
‘Naughty monkey!’ she said. ‘Make fun of me, would you? I’d like to tear that
wicked mouth of yours!’
‘It’s because I wanted to make you laugh, Grannie. Laugh?ter makes the humours
circulate. We’re going to be eating crabs shortly, and I was afraid that the cold of the
crab-meat might settle on your heart. If I can make you laugh and stir your humours
up, you’ll be able to eat as much crab as you like without taking any harm from it.’
‘In that case I shall have to keep you with me all the time, so that I am always
laughing,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ll have to stop you going home at night.’
‘It’s because you indulge her so much that she is so cheeky, Mother,’ said Lady
Wang. ‘By saying things like that to her you will make her even worse.’
‘But I like her cheekiness!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘After all, there’s no harm in it.
She knows what’s what underneath it all, of course she does. I think it’s nice that the
young people should feel free to joke and laugh a bit when we are all on our own
together. We don’t want them behaving like a lot of stuffed dummies, surely?’
While she was saying this, they all passed into the smaller pavilion, where tea was
served, after which Xi-feng came bustling in with winecups and chopsticks and began
to lay. Grandmother Jia sat with Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu at a centre
table, and Xiang-yun, Lady Wang, Ying?-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at a table on the
east side of the room. A little table was laid for Xi-feng and Li Wan on the west side of
the doorway, but this was only for form’s sake, since both of them remained on their
feet in order to wait on the other two tables.
‘We shan’t want all the crabs at once,’ said Xi-feng to the servants bringing them in.
‘Ten will be enough to start with. The others can go back into the steamer.’
She called for some water, and after washing her hands, stood at the centre table
facing Grandmother Jia and began shelling the crabs. She offered the first meat, as a
courtesy, to Aunt Xue.
‘No thank you,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I don’t need anyone to do it for me. I like doing it
myself and getting crabby fingers. I think they taste better when you eat them with
your fingers.’
Xi-feng gave the crab-meat she had prepared to Grand?mother Jia. The second lot
she offered to Bao-yu. Then she called for some ‘really hot wine’. She also sent a little
maid to fetch mung-bean flour scented with chrysanthemum leaves and cassia for
cleaning the lingers with and removing the smell of crab.
Xiang-yun sat with the others at her own table for a while, but as soon as she had
finished her first crab, got up to look after her guests. She also went outside and gave
orders for a plate of crabs to be taken to Aunt Zhao and another to Aunt Zhou. At
once Xi-feng came bearing down on her.
‘You’re not used to this. You get on with your eating and leave this to me! I’ll have
mine when the rest of you have finished.’
But Xiang-yun, refusing to be put off, ordered a long table to be laid on the verandah
at the far side of the Lotus Pavilion and invited the maids Faithful, Amber, Sunset,
Suncloud and Patience to come and sit at it.
Faithful glanced laughingly in Xi-feng direction.
‘I can’t very well sit down and eat while Mrs Lian is waiting on everybody.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You all go and sit down. I’ll take care of everything.’
At that Xiang-yun, too, went back to her seat.
Li Wan and Xi-feng now made a brief pretence of joining in the party, but Xi-feng was
soon on her feet again minister?ing to the rest. After a few minutes she went out on
to the verandah, where Faithful and the other maids were regaling themselves with
great gusto. They rose to their feet when they saw her come.
‘What have you come out here for, Mrs Lian?’ said Faith?ful. ‘Can’t you leave us
alone to enjoy ourselves for a bit?’
‘Well, aren’t you disagreeable!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Here am I doing all the work for you,
but instead of thanks I get grumbled at! I was hoping you would offer me a drink.’
Faithful, laughing, quickly filled a winecup and held it to Xi-feng lips. Tilting her head
back, Xi-feng drained it at a gulp. Amber and Sunset followed suit, and two more
cupfuls went down in the same way. Meanwhile Patience had been scooping out
some ‘yolk’ — the delicious golden crab-spawn — which she now offered to her
mistress. Xi-feng told her to put lots of ginger and vinegar on it, then, having quickly
disposed of it, ‘You can all sit down now and get on with your party,’ she said. ‘I’m
going.’
‘What a nerve!’ said Faithful. ‘Scrounging off us like that!’
‘You’d better be careful what you say to me, my girl,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I
suppose you realize that Mr Lian has taken a fancy to you and is going to ask Her Old
Ladyship if he can have you for his Number Two?’
Faithful tutted and shook her head. It was easy to see that she was blushing.
‘Huh!’ she said. ‘Fancy a lady saying a thing like that! I’m going to wipe my smelly
fingers on your face, Mrs Lian, if it’s the last thing I do.’
‘No, no! Please! Forgive me!’ said Xi-feng, as Faithful stood up to carry out her
threat.
‘Even if she does,’ said Amber, laughing, ‘I wouldn’t be too sure that Patience will.
Look at her, all of you! She hasn’t eaten two crabs yet, but she’s already finished a
saucerful of vinegar!’
Patience, who had in her hand a crab richly endowed with ‘yolk’ that she had just
finished shelling, held it up when she heard this jibe and advanced on Amber,
intending to smear her face with it.
‘You nasty, spiteful little creature!’ she said, both laughing and indignant. ‘I’ll—’
But Amber dodged aside, and Patience, losing her balance, plastered the crab smack
on to her mistress’s cheek. Xi-feng, at that moment still preoccupied with Faithful,
was taken completely by surprise. Her startled ‘Aiyo!’ was too much for the maids,
who collapsed in uncontrollable laughter. Xi-feng presently joined in, though cursing
Patience as she did so.
‘Stupid cow! Are you too drunk to see straight? All over my face!’
Patience hurriedly wiped it off and fetched water for her to wash with.
‘Holy Name!’ said Faithful. ‘That was a judgement, if ever there was one!’
Hearing the laughter outside, Grandmother Jia eagerly asked to know its cause.
‘What is it? What have you seen that’s so funny? Tell us, so that we can share the
joke.’
Faithful shouted back, amidst laughter.
‘Mrs Lian came over here and stole some of our crab. Patience didn’t like it, so she
smeared crab-yolk all over her mistress’s face, and now the two of them are having a
fight.’
Hoots of laughter from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang.
‘Poor Mrs Lian!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You ought to feel sorry for her. Couldn’t you
spare her a few of the legs or some of the underneath bits?’
There was renewed laughter from the maids. Faithful shouted back again.
‘She can have all the crab’s-legs on this table, and very welcome to them!’
Xi-feng, taking all in good part, finished washing her face and went back to help
Grandmother Jia and the others at the centre table with their crabs.
Dai-yu dared not eat very much because of her delicate health, and after consuming
a little of the claw-meat, excused herself from the table. Soon Grandmother Jia, too,
had finished eating, and everyone washed their hands and broke off for a while to
amuse themselves, some going off to admire the flowers, some to drop things in the
water and watch the fish rise.
‘It’s rather windy for you here, Mother,’ said Lady Wang, ‘— especially after you’ve
just been eating crab. Perhaps you ought to go back to your own room now and test.
If you have enjoyed it, we could come again tomorrow.’
‘Yes, perhaps you are right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I hadn’t been going to leave,
because I could see how much they were all enjoying themselves and was afraid of
spoiling the fun. But perhaps you and I ought to be getting along now.’
As she rose to leave, she turned to address Xiang-yun.
‘Don’t let your Cousin Bao-yu eat too much!’
‘No, Grandma.’
She turned once more as she was leaving, this time including Bao-chai in her
admonition.
‘And don’t you two eat too much, either. Crab is very good to eat, but it isn’t very
good for you. If you eat too much of it, it will give you stomach-ache.’
‘Yes, Grandma.’
The two girls saw her out of the Garden. When they were back again, they gave
orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid; but Bao-yu
objected.
‘No, don’t lay again,’ he said. ‘We want to get on with the poetry. Put the big round
table in the middle with all the food and drink on it so that we can help ourselves
when we feel like it and sit where we like. That will be much nicer than having set
places.’
Bao-chai agreed; but Xiang-yun reminded them that there were others besides
themselves to be considered, and having first ordered a separate table to be laid and
some good hot crabs to be selected, she invited Aroma, Nightingale, Chess, Scribe,
Picture, Oriole and Ebony to come and sit at it. After that she had a couple of carpets
spread out on the ground beneath the cassia-trees at the foot of the rockery and
made the old nannies and junior maids sit down on them and eat and drink to their
hearts’ content, insisting that they need only get up to wait on them if they were
specially called for. Then she took the list of poem-titles and pinned it to the inside
wall of the pavilion.
‘Very original!’ the others commented when they had finished reading the titles,
but went on to express the fear that they might find them difficult to write on.
Xiang-yun explained what they had decided about rhymes: viz. that there should be
no set rhyme-scheme and everyone should be free to choose their own.
‘Now that’s what I call sensible!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t stand set rhymes.’
Dai-yu had a barrel-shaped porcelain tabouret moved up to the verandah’s edge, and
having selected a fishing-rod for herself, sat leaning on the railing, fishing.
Bao-chai sat for some time silently contemplating a spray of cassia she had picked,
then, leaning over the railings and idly plucking off the flowerets, dropped them one
by one into the water and watched the fish swim up from below and nibble at them
with plopping noises as they floated on the surface.
Xiang-yun for the most part sat quietly musing, occasion?ally getting up to look after
Aroma and the other maids at the table outside, or to make sure that the people
sitting on the carpets were getting enough to eat and drink.
Tan-chun stood with Li Wan and Xi-chun in the shade of a weeping willow, watching
the water-fowl.
Ying-chun sat apart from the rest beneath a flowering tree, stringing jasmine
blossoms into a flower-chain with a needle and thread.
Bao-yu watched Dai-yu fishing for a bit, then went over and leaned on the railings
and talked with Bao-chai for a bit, and finally, after watching Aroma and the other
maids eating and drinking at their table, ended up by drinking with them himself
while Aroma shelled a crab for him.
Presently Dai-yu put down her fishing-rod, went over to the central table, took up a
silver ‘self-service’ wine-kettle whose surface was carved with a nielloed plum-flower
pattern, and, having selected a little shallow, rose-quartz winecup, was just about to
pour herself a drink, when a maid observed her and came hurrying up to do it for her.
‘No, let me pour it myself,’ said Dai-yu. ‘That is half the fun. You get on with your
party.’
So saying, she proceeded to half-fill the tiny receptacle with liquor from the silver
kettle. But it proved to be yellow rice-wine, whereas what she wanted was spirits.
‘I only ate a small amount of crab,’ she said, ‘but it has given me a slight heart-burn.
What I really need is some very hot samshoo.’
‘ We have some,’ said Bao-yu, and quickly ordered a kettle of special
mimosa-flavoured samshoo to be heated for her. Dai-yu took only a sip of it before
putting the winecup down again.
Presently Bao-chai strolled up and helped herself to the samshoo. She, too, put her
cup down after taking only a tiny mouthful of it. Then she moistened a brush with ink,
and going over to the list of titles, put a tick over the first one, ‘Remembering the
Chrysanthemums’, and wrote the word ‘Allspice’ underneath it.
‘Please leave Number Two for me, Chai,’ said Bao-yu anxiously. ‘I’ve already
thought of four lines for it.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘I’ve had a hard enough job thinking of lines for this first one. You’ve nothing to
worry about as far as I’m con?cerned.’
Dai-yu, without saying a word, quietly relieved Bao-chai of the brush, ticked first
‘Questioning the Chrysanthemums’ and then the eleventh title, ‘The Dream of the
Chrysanthemums’, and wrote ‘River’ underneath each of them.
After her, Bao-yu took up the brush and ticked ‘Seeking the Chrysanthemums’. He
signed himself ‘Green’.
Tan-chun now drifted over and looked at the list.
‘Oh, hasn’t anyone chosen “Wearing the Chrysanthemums” yet?’ she said. ‘Let me
do that one.’
She turned, smilingly, to Bao-yu and pointed a warning finger at him.
‘We’ve just made a new rule, by the way. No naked ladies this time, please. You
have been warned!’
Xiang-yun strolled up while she was saying this and ticked Numbers Four and Five —
‘Admiring the Chrysanthemums’ and ‘Arranging the Chrysanthemums’ — in rapid
succession. She signed herself ‘Xiang’ underneath them.
‘You ought to have a pen-name like the test of us,’ said Tan-chun.
‘There are various pavilions and studios at home, of course,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘but I
don’t live in any of them. It would be rather pointless to call myself after a building
like the rest of you.’
‘What about that water pavilion “Above the Clouds” that Lady Jia was telling us
about?’ said Bao-chai. ‘You could call that yours. Even if it doesn’t exist any more,
you can pretend that it would have been yours. You should call yourself “Cloud
Maiden”.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said the others; and before Xiang-yun herself could do anything, Bao-yu
had crossed out the ‘Xiang’ and substituted the word ‘Cloud’ beneath it.
In less time than it would take to eat a meal, poems had been completed for each of
the twelve titles. The young poets then wrote out their poems and handed them in
to Ying-chun, who copied them out, each with the full pen-name of its author, on to
the finest Snow Wave notepaper.
Li Wan then read them all through, the others overlooking her.

Remembering the Chrysanthemums
by Lady Allspice
The autumn wind that through the knotgrass blows
Blurs the sad gazer’s eye with unshed tears;
But autumn’s guest, who last year graced this plot,
Only, as yet, in dreams of night appears.
                           The wild geese from the North are now returning;
                           The dhobi’s thump at evening fills my ears.
                     Those golden flowers for which you see me pine
                     I’ll meet once more at this year’s Double Nine.

Seeking the Chrysanthemum
by Green Boy
                 The crisp day bids us go on an excursion—
                 Resistant to the wineshop door’s temptation—
                 Some garden, where, before the frosts, was planted
                 The glory of autumn, being our destination:
                 Which after weary walk having found, we’ll sing
                          An autumn song with unsubdued elation.
                          And you, gold flowers, if all the poet told
                          You understood, would not refuse his gold!

Planting the Chrysanthemums
by Green Boy
             Brought from their nursery and, with loving hands,
                   Planted along the fence and by the door —
         A shower last night their wilting leaves revived,
                  Opening the morning-buds all silver-hoar.
                   Sweet flowers! a thousand autumn songs I’ll sing
         To praise your beauty, and libations pour,
                  And water you, and ridge with earth around.
                   No dust on my wet well-path shall be found!

Admiring the Chrysanthemums

            Transplanted treasures, dear to me as gold—
            Both the pale clumps and those of darker hue!
            Rare-headed by your wintry bed I sit
            And, musing, hug my knees and sing to you.
        None more than you the villain world disdains;
            None understands your proud heart as I do.
        The precious hours of autumn I’ll not waste,
            But bide with you and savour their full taste.

Arranging the Chrysanthemums

             What greater pleasure than the lute to strum

             To hold the garden’s fragrance in one vase,
                   And see all autumn in a single spray?
             On frosty nights I’ll dream you back again,
             Brave in your garden bed at close of day.
             Since with your shy disdain I sympathize,
    ’Tis you, not summer’s gaudy blooms I prize.

Celebrating the Chrysanthemums
by River Queen
                   Down garden walks, in search of inspiration,
         A restless demon drives me all the time;
             Then brush blooms into praises, and the mouth
             Grows scud-sweet, hymning those scents sublime.
             Yet easier ’twere a world of grief to tell
             Than to lock autumn’s secret in one rhyme.
             That miracle old Tao did once attain;
             Since when a thousand bards have tried in vain

             When cunning black-ink blots the flowers’ leaves make,
             And white the petals, silvered o’er with frost.
             Fresh scents of autumn from the paper rise,
             And shapes unmoving by the wind are tossed.
             No need at Double Ninth live flowers to pluck:
                       These living seem, upon a fine screen stuck!

            Of all the flowers why do yours bloom so late?
                       The garden silent lies in frosty dew;
            The geese return; the cricket mourns his fate.

Wearing the Chrysanthemums
by Plantain Lover
                       Just to admire and not for our adornment
             Were these reared and arranged with so much care;
                       Yet young Sir Fop, with whom flowers are a passion,
             And drunk old Tao both dote on flowers to wear.
                       One’s head-cloth reeks of autumn’s acrid perfume;
             Chill dew of autumn pearls the other’s hair
             The vulgar crowd, which nothing understands,
             Stops in the street and, jeering, claps its hands.

The Shadow of the Chrysanthemums

                     The autumn moonlight through the garden steals,
      Filtered in patches variously bright.
           Flowers by the house as silhouettes appear;
           Flowers by the fence are flecked with coins of light.
                In the flowers’ wintry scent their souls reside,
                Not in those frost-forms, than a dream more slight.
                     Even the gross vandal, squinting through drunken eyes,
                     Can, by their scents, the crushed flowers recognize.

The Dream of the Chrysanthemums

                 Light-headed in my autumn bed I lie
                And seem to chase the moon across the sky.
                Well, if immortal, I’ll go seek old Tao,
                Not imitate Zhuang’s flittering butterfly!
                Following the wild goose, into sleep I slid;
                From which now, startled by the cricket’s cry,
                Midst cold and fog and dying leaves I wake,
                With no one by to tell of my heart’s ache.

The Death of the Chrysanthemums
by Plantain Lover
                The feasting over and the first snow fallen,
                The flowers frost-stricken lie or sideways lean,
                Their perfume lingering, but their gold hue dimmed
                And few poor, tattered leaves bereft of green.
                Now under moonlit bench the cricket shrills,
                And weary goose-files in the cold sky are seen.
                Yet of your passing let me not complain:
                 Next autumn equinox we’ll meet again!

*

Each poem was praised in turn, and the reading of the whole twelve concluded
amidst cries of mutual admiration.
‘Now just a moment!’ said Li Wan, interrupting their encomiums. ‘Let me first try to
give you an impartial judge?ment. I think there were good lines in all of the poems,
but comparing one with another, it seems to be that one is bound to place
“Celebrating the Chrysanthemums” first, with “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”
second and “The Dream of the Chrysanthemums” third. The titles themselves were
original, and - particularly in their treatment of the subject these are three highly
original poems. So I think that today the first place must undoubtedly go to River
Queen. After those first three I would place “Wearing the Chrysan?themums”,
“Admiring the Chrysanthemums”, “Arranging the Chrysanthemums”, “Painting the
Chrysanthemums” and “Remembering the Chrysanthemums” in that order.’
Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly.
‘Absolutely right! A very fair judgement!’
‘I’m afraid mine aren’t really all that good,’ said Dai-yu. ‘They are a bit too
contrived.’
‘There’s nothing wrong with a bit of contrivance,’ said Li Wan. ‘One doesn’t want
the structure of a poem to stand out too ruggedly.’
‘I very much like that couplet of Cloud Maiden’s,’ said Dai-yu:

         ‘On frosty nights I’ll dream you back again,
         Brave in your garden bed at close of day.

It’s a technique that painters call “white-backing”. That mar?vellous couplet that
comes before it:

         To hold the garden’s fragrance in a vase,
         And see all autumn in a single spray

already sums up all there is to be said on the subject of flower? arrangement. You
feel that she’s left herself nothing else to say. So what does she do? She goes back to
the time before the flowers were arranged — before they were picked, even. That
going back in her “frosty nights’ couplet is a very subtle way of throwing the main
theme into relief, just as the artist’s white-backing sharpens the highlights on the
other side of the painting.’
Li Wan smiled.
‘That may be so; but your own “acrid-sweet” couplet is more than a match for it.’
‘I think Lady Allspice dealt with her subject most effect?ively,’ said Tan-chun. ‘That
couplet of hers:

             But autumn’s guest, who last year graced this plot,
             Only as yet in dreams of night appears

seems to bring out the idea of remembering so vividly.’
‘Well, your “head-cloth reeking of autumn’s acrid perfume” and “chill dew of
autumn pearling the hair” give a pretty vivid image of wearing chrysanthemums,’
said Bao-chai with a laugh.
‘And River Queen’s “who shares your hiding place?” “why do you bloom so late?”,’
said Xiang-yun, smiling mis?chievously, ‘make so thorough a job of questioning them,
that one feels the poor things must have been quite tongue-tied!’
‘For that matter,’ said Li Wan, entering into the spirit of the thing, ‘your persistent
haunting of the chrysanthemums — “sitting bare-headed by their wintry bed” and
“hugging your knees and singing to them”—makes one suspect that if the
chrysanthemums really had consciousness, they might, in the end, have grown just a
tiny bit tired of your company!’
The others all laughed.
‘I seem to be bottom again,’ said Bao-yu ruefully. ‘Though I must say I should have
thought that

        … to go on an excursion—
        Some garden where. . . was planted
                           The glory of autumn being our destination

and so forth was a perfectly satisfactory exposition of “seeking the chrysanthemums”;
and that

             A shower last night the wilting leaves revived,
             Opening the morning-buds all silver-hoar

dealt with the theme of transplanting chrysanthemums rather successfully. Heigh-ho!
I suppose it’s just that I couldn’t produce anything quite as good as River Queen’s
“acrid-sweet” line, or Cloud Maiden’s “bare-headed by your wintry bed”, or Plaintain
lover’s “reeking head-cloth” or “few poor, tattered leaves”, or Lady Allspice’s “autumn
guest in dreams of night appears”.
‘Well, never mind,’ he went on, after a moment’s reflection. ‘Perhaps tomorrow or
the day after, if I’ve got the time, I’ll try to do all twelve of them again on my own.’
‘Your poems were perfectly all right,’ said Li Wan consol?ingly. ‘It’s simply as you
yourself have just said that they didn’t have anything quite as good as the lines you
have men?tioned.’
Discussion of the poems continued a little longer, after which they called for another
lot of hot crabs and sat down at the large round table to eat them.
‘Eating crab-and admiring the cassia like this is itself a good theme for a poem, said
Bao-yu. ‘I’ve already thought of one. Is anyone else game to have a try?’
He quickly washed his hands and taking up a brush, wrote down the poem he had
thought of. The others then read what he had written:
            How delightful to sit and a crab’s claw to chew
            In the cassia shade — with some ginger-sauce, too
    Old Grim-chops wants wine, though he’s got no inside,
    And he walks never forwards, but all to one side.
            The ‘yolks’ are so tasty, who cares if we’re ill!
            Though our fingers we’ve washed, they are crab-scented still.
                 ‘O crabs,’ Dong-po said (and his words I repeat)
                 ‘You have not lived in vain if you’re so good to eat!’


‘One could churn out that sort of poem by the dozen,’ said Dai-yu.
‘You’ve used up all your inspiration,’ said Bao-yu; ‘but instead of admitting that you
can’t write any more, you make rude remarks about my poem!’
Dai-yu made no reply, but tilted her head back, lifted up her eyes, and for some
minutes could be observed muttering softly to herself; then, picking a brush up, she
wrote out the follow?ing poem rapidly and without hesitation:

             In arms and in armour they met their sad fate.
             How tempting they look now, piled up on a plate!
             The white flesh is tasty, the pink flesh as well—
             Both the white in the claws and the pink in the shell;
             And we’re glad he’s an eight- not a four-legged beast
             When there’s plenty of wine to enliven the feast.
             So with crab let us honour the Double Ninth Day,
             While chrysanthemums bloom ’neath the cassia’s spray.

Bao-yu had read this and was just beginning to say how good he thought it was when
Dai-yu impetuously tore it up and told one of the servants to take away the pieces
and burn them.
‘It’s not as good as yours,’ she said. ‘It deserves to be burnt. Actually yours is very
good — better even than the chrysanthe?mum ones. You ought to keep it to show
people.’
‘I’ve thought of one too,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It was rather a struggle, so I’m afraid it
won’t be very good; but I’ll write it down anyway for a laugh.’
Then she wrote down her poem, and the others read it.

             With winecups in hand, as the autumn day ends,
             And with watering mouths, we await our small friends.
             A straightforward breed you are certainly not,
             And the goodness inside you has all gone to pot—

There were cries of admiration at this point.
‘That’s a very neat bit of invective!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can see I shall have to burn my
poem now!’
They read on.

                  For your cold humours, ginger; to cut out your smell
                  We’ve got wine and chrysanthemum petals as well.
                  As you hiss in your pot, crabs, d’ye look back with pain
                  On that calm moonlit cove and the fields of fat grain?

When they had finished reading, all agreed that this was the definitive poem on the
subject of eating crabs.
‘It’s the sign of a real talent,’ they said, ‘to be able to see a deeper, allegorical
meaning in a frivolous subject — though the social satire is a trifle on the harsh side!’
Just then Patience arrived back in the Garden.
But what then ensued will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 39

An inventive old county woman tells a story of somewhat
questionable veracity
And an impressionable young listener insists on getting to
the bottom of the matter

PATIENCE, you will recall, had just returned to the party.
‘What’s happened to your mistress?’ the others asked her.
‘Why doesn’t she come back and join us?’
‘She hasn’t got time,’ said Patience, laughing. ‘She’s sent me to ask if you’ve got any
crabs left. She says she didn’t get a proper chance to eat any earlier on, and as she
hasn’t got time to come here herself, would I ask you, if you’ve still got any, to let me
take a few back for her.’
‘We’ve got plenty left,’ said Xiang-yun, and gave orders for ten of the largest to be
put in a box for her to take.
‘Pick as many as you can with the round “navels”,’ said Patience to the old servant
who was departing to do Xiang?-yun’s bidding.
Li Wan tried to make Patience sit down with them, but she refused.
‘You shall sit down!’ said Li Wan, eyeing her skittishly; and taking her by the hand,
she drew her down beside her and held a cup of wine up to her lips so that she was
forced to drink. Patience gulped down a mouthful of it and then rose again to go.
‘I won’t let you go!’ said Li Wan. ‘The only person you ever take any notice of is that
precious Feng of yours; you think you don’t need to obey me; but you shall.’ She
turned to the old woman, now waiting in readiness with the box of crabs, and told
her to go on ahead with them and tell Xi-feng that Patience was being detained. The
old woman went away.
She returned a short while after, still carrying the box, with a message.
‘Mrs Lian says thank you very much, and she hopes you didn’t think her greedy for
asking. She’s put some caltrop?-cakes and some chicken-fat rolls in the box, that have
just been sent her by the elder Lady Wang. She thought you and the young ladies
might like to try them.’
There was a further message for Patience:
‘Mrs Lian says she thought she sent you to fetch something for her, not to stay here
and amuse yourself. Anyway, she says, tell her not to drink too much.’
‘Oh,’ said Patience, laughing, ‘and what will happen to me if I do?’
As if in defiance of her mistress’s instructions, she fell to eating and drinking with
great gusto. Li Wan meanwhile encircled her waist in an affectionate embrace.
‘What a pity that so distinguished-looking a young woman should have been born
to so humble a fate!’ said Li Wan. ‘It’s you who should have been the mistress. You
would have made such a good lady. No one who didn’t know would ever take you for
a maid.’
Patience, who had continued eating and drinking with Bao-chai and Xiang-yun while
Li Wan was saying this, now turned round and looked at her with a giggle.
‘Stop it, Mrs Zhu! You’re tickling me!’
‘Aiyo!’ said Li Wan. ‘What’s this great hard thing here?’
‘Keys,’ said Patience.
‘Keys?’ said Li Wan. ‘What has your mistress got so pre?cious that you need to
carry keys round all the time? Do you know what I tell people about you? I tell them:
Just as you can’t imagine a Tripitaka going off to India to fetch the scriptures without
his white horse or a Liu Zhi-yuan conquer?ing the Empire without a Spirit of the
Melon Fields to give him his armour, so you can’t imagine a Wang Xi-feng without a
Patience alongside helping her. You are your mistress’s master-key. What does she
need to make you carry these things around with you for?’
Patience laughed embarrassedly.
‘You are making fun of me, Mrs Zhu. I’m afraid you’ve had too much to drink.’
‘No, it’s true,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Whenever we start gossiping about personalities, we
nearly always end up by agreeing what exceptional people you and the other chief
maids are. And all exceptional in your own different ways, too— that’s what’s so
interesting.’
‘It’s almost as though Nature had in each case designed the mistress and the maid
to suit each other,’ said Li Wan. ‘Take Grandmother and Faithful, for example.
Grandmother would be completely lost without Faithful. Who in the family from Lady
Wang downwards would ever dare answer Grandmother back? Yet Faithful does. And
what’s more, Grandmother will listen to her. And look at all the things that
Grandmother has. No one else could ever remember them the way that Faithful can.
Just think how Grandmother would be plundered and cheated if Faithful weren’t
there to look after them. And on top of it all, she’s a very fair person. She’ll often put
in a good word for someone. And though she has so much influence with
Grandmother, she never, never uses it to do anyone else down.’
Xi-chun smiled.
‘Yesterday when Grannie was talking about Faithful she said, “She’s better than all
you grandchildren!”’
‘Faithful’s a good sort,’ said Patience. ‘I don’t consider my?self in her class at all.’
‘Mother’s Suncloud is a good, honest soul,’ said Bao-yu.
‘She certainly is,’ said Tan-chun. ‘She’s got a mind of her own, though. You know
what a Holy Buddha Mother is: she doesn’t notice a half of what goes on around her.
But Sun-cloud does. And she is the one who always has to remind Mother about
everything. She even knows about outside mat?ters. When Father is at home, it’s
Suncloud who has to remind Mother about them when she forgets.’
‘I don’t know about Mother and Suncloud,’ said Li Wan, ‘but what about this young
gentleman here?’ She pointed to Bao-yu. ‘Can you imagine the sort of state he would
be in if he hadn’t got his Aroma to look after him? And Feng too. Even though she’s a
regular Tyrant King, she still needs her Patience in order to be so efficient, just as
much as the real Tyrant King needed his two strong arms in order to be able to lift up
those hundredweight tripods.’
‘There were four of us when I first came here with Mrs Lian,’ said Patience, ‘but the
others all either died or left. I’m the only one who’s stayed with her all along.’
‘You’re lucky then,’ said Li Wan. ‘And Feng is lucky, too. When I first came here to
Mr Zhu, I had several maids, too, but — I don’t know why it was, for I’m sure you
wouldn’t call me a hard mistress — they were always dissatisfied. So when Mr Zhu
died, I took advantage of their being still young to get rid of them all. If only I’d had a
dependable girl like you that I could have kept on with me, I shouldn’t feel quite so
helpless now.’
Her eyes began to redden as she said this, and she seemed about to cry.
‘Oh, come now!’ said the others. ‘There’s no need to upset yourself. If you’re going
to be like this, we might just as well break up the party.’
They did in fact begin washing their hands then and pre?sently decided to go off in a
body to pay their duty calls on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang. Meanwhile the old
women and maids busied themselves with sweeping out the pavilion and stacking
and washing up the cups and dishes.
Aroma left in the company of Patience. On the way back she asked Patience into
Green Delights. She made her sit down and invited her to take tea, but Patience
declined, saying that she would drop in another time, and rose to go. Aroma had
something to ask her, however, and called after her as she was going.
‘What’s happened to this month’s allowances?’ she said. ‘Even Her Old Ladyship’s
and Her Ladyship’s people haven’t had theirs yet.’
Patience spun round when she heard this and came back again.
‘Don’t ask me about that, please!’ she said in a low, agit?ated voice, after first
glancing round to make sure that no one else was present. ‘Whatever it is, you’ll only
have another day or two to wait, I promise you.’
Aroma was amused to see her so agitated.
‘Why, what’s the matter? Why should you be in such a state about it?’
Patience dropped her voice even lower.
‘Mrs Lian has already put the money for this month’s allow?ances out at interest.
She’s waiting for the interest on some of her other loans to pay your allowances with.
It’s all right for me to tell you this, but whatever you do, don’t let anyone else know
about it!’
Aroma laughed.
‘But she’s not short of money, she’s got plenty. What does she want to go giving
herself all this extra worry for?’
‘She’s certainly not short of money,’ said Patience. ‘Just in the few years since she
started doing this, the amount she has got out on loan must have grown to several
hundred times the original premium. And she doesn’t spend all of her own
allow?ance, either. Whenever she’s got nine or ten taels saved up out of it, she
invests them too. Why, just her profits alone after she’s deducted the allowances
from the interest must be in the region of a thousand taels a year.’
‘You and your mistress are a nice pair, I must say!’ said Aroma. Keeping the rest of
us short while you use our money to feather your own nests with!’
‘That’s most unfair!’ said Patience indignantly. ‘Any way, I’m sure you can’t really be
short of money.’
‘Not myself, it’s true’ said Aroma. ‘In any case, I haven’t got anything to spend it on.
I was thinking more of my young gentleman. I like to keep some by me in case he
ever needs any.’
‘Look, if you’re in urgent need of money, I’ve got a few taels put by myself that I can
let you have,’ said Patience. ‘You can have them as an advance on this month’s
allowance, if you like.’
‘I don’t really need any at the moment,’ said Aroma, ‘but may I take you up on your
offer if I ever do?’
‘Of course,’ said Patience, and left without further cere?mony.
Outside the courtyard gate a maid from Xi-feng was look?ing for her.
‘The Mistress wants to see you about something.’
‘What has she got so urgent that she has to keep pestering me like this?’ said
Patience. ‘I’ve just had Mrs Zhu all over me to make me stay and talk to her. It’s not
as if I’d run away.’
‘Better ask her yourself,’ said the girl. ‘It wasn’t my idea to fetch you.’
‘Cheeky devil!’ said Patience, and continued on her way.
When she got there, however, it was not Xi-feng she found waiting for her, but the
old countrywoman she had admitted on a previous occasion as a suppliant, Grannie
Liu, with her little grandson Ban-er. They were sitting in the side room on the kang
with Zhang Cai’s wife and Zhou Rui’s wife on either side of them, while maids were
emptying sacks of jujubes, melons and other farm produce on the floor below. The
company rose hurriedly to their feet as Patience entered. Grannie Liu, who
recognized her from her last visit, scrambled down from the kang and greeted her at
once as ‘Miss Patience’ without any of the previous time’s confusion.
‘The family all send their regards, Miss. They’d have come themselves long since to
see you and pay their respects to their Aunt Lian, only they’ve been too busy with
the farm-work. Anyways, they’ve had a good harvest this year, thanks be, and it’s
been a good year for the fruit and vegetables. This here that I’ve brought is the first
pickings. We didn’t like to sell them, because we wanted our first-fruits to go to Mrs
Lian and the young ladies. We thought that mayhap eating the rarities of earth and
sea every day of their lives they might sometimes tire of delicate food and fancy a bit
of plain country stuff for a change. Anyway, there you are! It’s a poor gift, but it’s
given with a warm heart!’
‘It’s very good of you to have brought it,’ said Patience, and begged her to be
seated, sitting down herself as she did so. She invited Zhou Rui’s wife and Zhang Cai’s
wife to be seated as well, and ordered one of the junior maids to pour tea.
Mesdames Zhou and Zhang chaffed her on her appear?ance.
‘You’ve got the spring in your face, Miss. Your eyes are all red.’
Patience laughed.
‘I know. I don’t drink normally, but today Mrs Zhou and the young ladies got hold of
me and just forced it down me. I was made to drink, against my will. That’s why my
face is so red.’
‘Well I don’t know,’ said Zhang Cai’s wife. ‘Here’s me just dying for a drink, but
nobody offers me one. Next time anyone invites you, Miss, you must take me with
you.’
The others laughed.
‘I saw those crabs this morning,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Great big things. There
couldn’t have been more than two or three to a catty. And I should think altogether
there must have been seventy or eighty catties in those hampers. Even so,’ she said
reflectively, ‘there probably wouldn’t have been enough for all the staff to have
some.’
‘Lots of them didn’t,’ said Patience. ‘It was only the top ones that got one or two
crabs to themselves. The rest of them only got a taste - some of them not even that.’
‘Good crabs like that are selling at a pennyweight a catty this year,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘If one catty is a pennyweight, fifty catties is two taels ten, and another thirty is one
and ten; ten and two is twelve and twice ten is a tael, that’s thirteen, and then
there’s the wine and the other dishes. It couldn’t have cost less than twenty taels in
all. Bless us and save us that’d keep a farmer and his family for a year!’
‘I take it you’ve already seen Mrs Lian,’ said Patience.
‘Yes,’ said Grannie Lu. ‘She told us to wait.’
She glanced through the open window as she said this and noticed that the day was
drawing on towards evening.
‘It’s getting dark earlier these days,’ she said. ‘We’d better be on our way. We don’t
want to find the city gates shut, or we shall be in a proper pickle.’
‘Just wait while I slip over and find out what the Mistress is up to,’ said Zhou Rui’s
wife. She left the room and was gone for some considerable time. When she
eventually returned, she was full of smiles.
‘It’s Grannie’s lucky day,’ she said. ‘She’s struck lucky with both of them.’
‘How do you mean?’ said Patience.
‘Well,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Mrs Lian was with Her Old Ladyship when I got there,
so I went up to her and told her on the side that Grannie wanted to go now to make
sure of getting to the gates in time. “Oh” she said, “she came such a long way with all
that stuff. If it’s getting late, she’d better spend the night here and leave tomorrow
morning.” Well, that was one piece of luck; but that’s nothing to what fol?lowed,
because Her Old Ladyship had overheard this and asked her who this “Grannie Liu”
was, and when Mrs Lian told her, she said, “Oh, I’ve been just longing for someone
with a bit of age and experience to talk to! Bring her here! Introduce her to me!”
Now that really was a stroke of luck!’
She urged Grannie Liu to leave her place on the kang and go over to the other
apartment; but the old countrywoman was seized with a sudden attack of shyness.
‘Look at me! Dear soul, I’m in no fit state to see her now! Tell her I’ve already left!’
‘Go on, you go and see her!’ said Patience. ‘It’ll be all right. Our old lady is always
very nice to poor or elderly people She’s not the least bit pretentious or stuck-up like
some I could mention. If you’re nervous about meeting high-ups, Mrs Zhou and I will
go with you to give you confidence.’
She proceeded, with Mrs Zhou’s assistance, to conduct the old woman to her
interview.
When they saw Patience coming out of the courtyard, the pages on duty at the gate
stood up, and two of them came run?ning up to her.
‘Miss! Miss!’
‘What’s it this time?’ said Patience.
‘I’ve been waiting to catch you for hours, Miss,’ said the first of the boys. ‘My ma’s
took ill and I’ve got to go and fetch the doctor for her. Will it be all right if I take the
night off?’
‘You’re a nice lot!’ said Patience. ‘It’s my belief that you’ve got it all worked out
between you so that one of you gets a holiday every day. And instead of telling the
Mistress properly, as you’re supposed to do, you come round to me with these sad
stories and make me take the responsibility. When Stoppo did this the other day, the
Master called for him while he was still away and I got into trouble by speaking jip for
him. The Master accused me of doing favours. And now you want to do the same
thing.’
‘His ma really is ill, Miss,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I’m sure it would be in order for you
to let him go.’
‘All right, then. But mind you’re back first thing tomorrow,’ Patience told the boy.
‘Now you heard that, didn’t you? First thing. Because I’ve got work for you to do. No
lying in bed until you can feel the sun on your backside! And I want you to take a
message to Brightie for me on the way. Tell him the Mistress says that if he hasn’t
handed in the test of that interest by tomorrow, she won’t ask him for it again,
because she’ll know that he’s keeping it for himself.’
The boy promised to deliver the message and scampered off, delighted to be
released.
By the time Patience and her charges arrived at Grand?mother Jia’s apartment, all
the young denizens of Prospect Garden had for some time been assembled there in
attendance, so that as Grannie Liu entered the room, she was confronted by a bevy
of unfamiliar young ladies, all resplendent in orna?ments of pearl and kingfisher, like
a bed of beautiful flowers, none of which she could give a name to. In their midst a
venerable old lady reclined on a couch. A young woman, pretty as a picture and
dressed in silk and satin from top to toe, sat behind her, gently pounding her legs.
Xi-feng, the only person there she could recognize, was standing to one side of her,
evidently in the midst of telling her something amusing. Deducing that the old lady
on the couch must be Grandmother Jia, Grannie Liu hurried up to her and made her
an antique curtsey.
‘Your servant, my lady!’
Grandmother Jia inclined herself politely from the couch and asked Zhou Rui’s wife to
bring up a chair for her to sit on. Ban-er, bashful as ever, would not attempt a
greeting.
‘Now, old kinswoman,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘and what would your age be?’
‘Seventy-five this year,’ said Grannie Liu.
Grandmother Jia turned round to the others present.
‘That’s several years older than me. Fancy still being so fit and lively Heaven only
knows what I shall be like at that age!’
Grannie Liu laughed.
‘I was born for a hard life, d’ye see, just as Your Ladyship was born for a soft one.
We couldn’t all be like Your Ladyship, or there’d be no one to do the farming.’
‘Are your eyes and teeth still good?’ Grandmother Jia asked her.
‘All bar a back tooth on the left-hand side that’s getting a bit loose this year.’
‘There! and I’m already a useless old woman,’ said Grand-mother Jia. ‘Poor eyesight,
poor hearing, memory going — I can’t even remember the names of old kinsfolk like
yourself any longer. I’m scared to meet them when they come visiting, for fear they
might laugh at me. There’s not much I can do nowadays except eat — what I can get
my teeth into — and sleep. Apart from that, I share a joke or two with these young
people when I need a bit of diversion, and that’s about all.’
‘Your Ladyship is lucky,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I couldn’t have such a life if I wanted it.’
‘Lucky? No!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’m just an old crock!’
The others all laughed.
‘Our Feng has been telling me that you’ve brought a lot of fruit and vegetables with
you,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve asked the servants to bring them over. I’m so looking
forward to some nice, fresh farm vegetables. The stuff we buy outside isn’t as tasty
as your home-grown stuff, you know.’
‘That’s the countryman’s idea of a treat,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘He can’t afford meat and
fish, so when he fancies a little luxury, he likes to eat his food fresh from the ground.’


‘Now that you’re one of the family,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘I hope you will stay long
enough to enjoy your visit. Don’t go hurrying back again. Stay here a couple of days
or so, if you can put up with us. We’ve got a garden too, you know, and we grow a
certain amount of fruit in it. Tomorrow you must try some of our stuff and you must
take some back home with you when you go. It will seem more like a proper visit to
rela?tions if you stay a bit, instead of popping in and popping straight out again.’
Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia took pleasure in the old woman’s company
and added her own persuasion.
‘It’s probably not as roomy here as your farmyard, but I expect we’ll manage to
tuck you in somewhere. And you’ll be able to tell our old lady all the village gossip.’
‘Feng!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing in spite of herself. ‘Don’t make fun! She’s a
simple countrywoman. You can’t expect her to stand up to your teasing in the way
that we can.’
She gave orders for Ban-er to be given some sweetmeats. He was unwilling to eat in
front of so many people, however, so she told them to give him some money instead,
and to get some of the younger pages to take him outside to play.
After Grannie Liu had taken tea, she regaled Grandmother Jia with some anecdotes
of village life, thus further endearing herself to her new acquaintance. She was still
holding forth when Xi-feng, who had slipped out some time previously, sent
someone round to invite her back for dinner. Grandmother Jia selected some food
from her own dishes and sent them to Xi-feng’s place for Grannie Liu to try in
addition to what Xi-feng was giving her.
Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia had taken a fancy to the old woman, so after
dinner she sent her back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. As soon as she arrived,
Faithful ordered some of the older domestics to conduct her to a bath. She herself
went off to fetch her a change of clothes. She selected two fairly modest items from
her own wardrobe and sent them to the bathroom with instructions that Grannie Liu
should change into them after her bath. Such goings-on were outside even the old
grannie’s extensive experience, but she took them all in good part, and having
submitted to the ordeal of the bath, quickly dressed herself in the proffered clothes
and went in to take her place once more beside the couch and resume her role of
raconteuse. In this she was eminently successful, since Bao-yu and the girls, now
seated on all sides around her, found her simple country talk much more fascinating
than any of the fictions told by the blind ballad-singers who sometimes visited the
house.
Indeed, there was more than an element of fiction in what she told them: for
Grannie Liu, though born and bred in the country, was a shrewd old soul to whom
the years had given a pretty good understanding of human weakness, and when she
sensed the old lady’s pleased excitement and the avid atten?tion of her younger
listeners, she did her best not to disappoint them by supplying from her own
invention whatever memory and experience were inadequate to provide.
‘We country-folk working out there on the land — year in, year out, rain or fine,
spring, summer, autumn and winter — we never get any time off,’ she told them. ‘If
we rest, it’s only as you might say ‘napping in harness’, like the old post-horse in the
story. And many a strange happening do we see, out there on the land.
‘Take what happened last winter, for instance. It had been snowing for several days
without a stop and the snow was two or three feet thick on the ground, and this
particular morn?ing I rose up early, and while I was still indoors, I heard the sound of
something stirring outside in the woodpile. I thought to myself, “That’ll be someone
stealing the firewood.” So I put my eye to the hole in the shutter, and sure enough
there was someone there; but it wasn’t anyone from the village.’
‘It was probably some traveller,’ Grandmother Jia inter?rupted. ‘He was feeling cold
and helped himself to a bit to make a fire with, so that he could get warm.’
‘Ah, but it wasn’t a traveller,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘That was the strange thing about it.
Now who do you think it was, my old soul? ’Twas a young woman, seventeen or
eighteen years of age seemingly, pretty as a picture, and with no more on her but a
red dress and a white satin skirt, and the hair on her bare head combed as sleek and
shining as black lacquer paint—’
At that point her story was interrupted by a confused hub?bub of voices outside. One
of them could be heard above the rest saying, ‘It isn’t serious. There’s no point in
frightening Her Old Ladyship.’
‘What is it?’ the old lady asked in some alarm.
‘A fire has broken out in the South Court stables,’ said one of the maids. ‘It isn’t
serious, though. They’ve already got it under control.’
Always the most timorous of mortals where fire was con?cerned, Grandmother Jia
struggled to her feet, and supported by the maids, led the others out onto the loggia
to see what was happening. Somewhere beyond the south-east corner of the
courtyard the glare of flames was still distinctly visible. Terrified out of her wits, she
began calling on the names of the Buddha, and hurriedly sent someone to burn
incense before the image of the Fire God.
By now Lady Wang had arrived with the younger women, and added her voice to the
others’ in assuring the old lady that the fire was well under control and urging her to
go indoors; but Grandmother Jia insisted on staying outside until the last of the
flames had been extinguished.
As soon as they were all inside again, Bao-yu began ques?tioning Grannie Liu about
her interrupted story.
‘Why was the girl out in all that snow stealing firewood?’ he asked her. ‘She might
have caught her death of cold.’
‘For goodness’ sake don’t ask about that!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It was talking
about firewood that started that fire just now. Think of something else to talk about
for goodness’ sake!’
Though privately far from satisfied, Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter rest while
Grannie turned her inventive faculties in another direction.
‘In a farmstead east of ours there was an old dame of more than ninety who had
fasted and prayed to the Buddha every day of her life. At last the Blessed Guanyin
was moved by her prayers and appeared to her one night in a dream. ‘It was to have
been your fate to be cut off without an heir,’ the Blessed Mother told her, ‘but
because of your great piety, I have peti?tioned the Jade Emperor to give you a
grandson.’
‘Now this old dame had an only son, and the son, too, had an only son who in spite
of all their care had died when he was only seventeen or eighteen, to their sore and
bitter grief. But after she had this dream a second grandson was born. He’d be
thirteen or fourteen now — a very handsome lad, with skin as white as snow, and
that sharp and clever you’d hardly credit it. So you see there are gods and Buddhas
watching over us, whatever folk may say!’
The circumstances of this tale so perfectly accorded with the idea they had privately
formed of their own situation, that both the senior ladies in her audience — Lady
Wang no less than Grandmother Jia — were quite captivated by it. But Bao-yu,
whose thoughts were still on the beautiful pilferer of fire?wood, looked glum and
preoccupied. His sister Tan-chun observed this and sought to distract him.
‘We’ve got to make some sort of return for Cousin Shi’s party, Bao. Why don’t we
go back now and discuss when the next poetry meeting is to be? We can have our
party for Cousin Shi at the same time, and Grandma will be able to come and look at
the chrysanthemums.’
‘Grandma’s already promised to give a return party for Cousin Shi herself,’ said
Bao-yu, ‘and we are all invited. We’d better wait until that’s over before putting on
anything of our own.’
‘The longer we delay, the colder the weather will be,’ said Tan-chun. ‘It won’t be
much fun for Grandma if it’s too cold.’
‘But she loves parties when it’s raining or snowing,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we
wait until the first snowfall and have it then? Call it a snow-viewing party. Think how
romantic: chanting poems in the falling snow!’
‘It would be more romantic still,’ said Dai-yu drily, ‘if instead of chanting poems we
had a big bundle of firewood and took it in turns to tiptoe through the snow and pull
out sticks from it.’
Bao-chai and the other girls all laughed, but Bao-yu stared at Dai-yu rather crossly
and said nothing.
After the company had dispersed, Bao-yu finally managed to get Grannie Liu into a
corner and question her in detail about the mysterious snow maiden. Grannie Liu’s
inventive?ness was once more put to the test.
‘On the embankment that runs along the north side of our land,’ she said, ‘there is
a little shrine. The image inside it is not a god or a Buddha, though. There used at
one time to be a gentleman living in our parts—’
She broke off at this point and appeared to be trying to remember a name.
‘Never mind his name,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t try to remem?ber it. Just tell me what
happened.’
‘This gentleman had no son, but he had an only daughter called — I think it was
Ruo-yu. She could read books as well as any scholar, this Ruo-yu, and the gentleman
loved her more than all the treasure in the world. But sad to say, she took sick and
died when she was only seventeen years old—‘
Bao-yu groaned and stamped his foot.
‘So what happened then?’
‘Because the gentleman loved her so dearly, he had this shrine built for her out in
the fields and had a likeness of her made out of wood and clay to put inside it; and
he arranged for someone to burn incense there and always keep a spark of fire going
inside the burner. But as the years went by, both the gentleman and the people who
used to tend the shrine for him all died, and now the shrine is falling into ruin and
the statue has come to life and started haunting people.’
‘No, no,’ Bao-yu interrupted hurriedly, ‘that wouldn’t be the statue coming to life.
People like that are never really dead, even after they have died.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Fancy that now! And me thinking all along it was
the statue. Well, whatever it is, every so often it takes on human shape and goes
wandering abroad troubling people. And that’s what I saw when I looked out that
time and saw someone taking our firewood. The people in our village are talking of
breaking up the image and knocking the shrine down so as to put a stop to the
haunting.’
‘Good gracious! they mustn’t do that!’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s a terrible sin, knocking a
temple down!’
‘Now I am glad you told me that,’ said Grannie Liu gravely. ‘When I get hack, I shall
do my best to stop them.’
‘My grandmother and Lady Wang and in fact just about everyone in this family is
terribly keen on good works,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There’s nothing they like better than
repairing temples and restoring things. Tomorrow I’ll write out an appeal and collect
some subscriptions for you. You can be the fund’s Treasurer, and when we’ve got
enough money together, you can supervise the restoration, And I’ll get them to send
you some money every month for incense, How would that be?’
‘Statue or spirit or whatever she is,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘I shall certainly be grateful to
her for the money.’
Bao-yu pressed her for the names of the nearest farms and villages and the exact
location of the shrine in relation to them as well as the distance to it and the general
direction in which it lay. Answering all these questions with whatever came first into
her head, Grannie Liu supplied a set of fictitious direc?tions which Bao-yu, believing
them to be genuine, carefully committed to memory and carried back to his room,
where he lay awake half the night planning what he would do for the beautiful
wood-thief in the days ahead.
He went out of the Garden first thing next morning, and handing Tealeaf a few
hundred cash, told him the directions for getting to the shrine as given him by
Grannie Liu the night before, and instructed him to follow them, inspect the shrine,
and report back on what he saw. He would await Tea-leaf’s report before deciding
what to do next.
But once Tealeaf had gone he found the waiting very tedious, and as the day wore on
and Tealeaf still failed to return, he became as fidgety as a worm on hot earth. He
was obliged to wait until sundown before Tealeaf finally came back. When he did,
however, he was looking extremely pleased with himself.
‘You managed to find it then?’ Bao-yu asked him eagerly. ‘Yes,’ said Tealeaf, smiling
broadly, ‘but you couldn’t have heard the directions right. I had a terrible job finding
it. The place where it is and the way to it are nothing like you said. That’s why I took
so long. I was all day looking for it. In the end I found that there is a ruined temple in
that area, but it’s not where you said: it’s at the east end of the north embank?ment,
on a corner.’
Bao-yu’s face beamed with pleasure.
‘ Grannie Liu’s a very old woman,’ he said. ‘It’s quite pos?sible that she
misremembered when she gave me those direc?tions. Anyway, tell me what you
saw.’
‘The temple was south-facing, like you said,’ Tealeaf re?plied, ‘and it was in a very
tumble-down condition. I’d been searching neatly all day by then, so of course when I
saw that, I was very relieved and hurried straight inside. But oh lot! when I looked at
the image, I was so scared I hurried straight out again it was so real!’
Bao-yu laughed delightedly.
‘Of course. If she’s capable of coming to life, you’d expect a certain liveliness in the
Statue.’
‘She?’ said Tealeaf. ‘This was no she. It was an ugly great Plague God with a blue
face and red hair!’
‘Useless dolt!’ said Bao-yu angrily. ‘You can’t even do a simple little errand like this
for me.’
‘That’s most unfair,’ said Tealeaf in a deeply aggrieved tone of voice. ‘You send me
off on a wild-goose chase to look for something you’ve read about in some book or
other or heard about in some old-wives’ tale, and then when I can’t find it (because
there’s probably no such thing any way) you start abusing me.’
Bao-yu saw that he had hurt his feelings, and hastened to comfort him.
‘There, there, don’t be upset! Some time when you’re not too busy you shall have
another look for it. If the old woman is deceiving us, you naturally won’t be able to
find it. But if there really is such a place and you do, then you will have a share in the
merit when it’s restored. And of course, I shall give you a very big reward.’
While he was talking to Tealeaf, one of the pages from the inner gate came up and
said that ‘one of the young ladies from Her Old Ladyship’s room’ was at the gate
asking for Master Bao.
Who it was and what she wanted will be revealed in the fol?lowing chapter.




CHAPTER 40

Lady Jia holds two feasts in one day in the Prospect Garden
And Faithful makes four calls on three dominoes in the
Painted Chamber



HEARING that he was wanted, Bao-yu hurried to the gate of the inner mansion.
Amber was standing in front of the screen-wall waiting for him.
‘Hurry! You’re holding everyone up. There’s something they want to talk to you
about,’ she said.
In fact, when he arrived at his grandmother’s room, she and his mother and the girls
were already discussing it ‘it’ being the question of what arrangements they should
make for the return party for Shi Xiang-yun.
‘I’ll tell you what to do,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Since there won’t be any outsiders at this
party, instead of having a fixed menu and formally-laid tables, why not get them to
do one or two of everyone’s favourite dishes, put them in those lacquer food-boxes
that have different compartments for the different dishes, and serve them on little
individual tables with a “self-service” wine-kettle each, so that everyone can pour
their own wine? I’m sure that would be jollier than a formal party.’
Grandmother Jia was much taken with this proposal and at once sent orders to the
kitchen to do as he had suggested.
‘Tell them that tomorrow we want them to choose some of the things they know
we like and put them in boxes - one box for each of us. And tell them that we shall
want lunch served in the Garden tomorrow as well.’
The lamps had by now been lit. Of the night which followed our record gives no
account.
Rising early next morning, they were delighted to observe that it was going to be a
beautiful clear, autumn day. Li Wan was among the earliest up, and at once began to
supervise the older women and maids in sweeping up fallen leaves, polish?ing chairs
and tables, and getting ready the sets of teacups, winecups and so forth that would
be needed for the party. Xi-feng’s maid Felicity, accompanied by Grannie Lin and little
Ban-er, arrived while they were in the midst of this activity.
‘You are very busy, Mrs Zhu,’ said Grannie Liu.
Li Wan smiled.
‘I told you you’d never get away! You kept saying yesterday that you had to go, but I
knew they wouldn’t let you.’
‘It was Her Old Ladyship that kept me,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘She said she wanted me to
enjoy meself for a day or two be?fore I went back.’
Felicity produced several large keys.
‘Mrs Lian says the little tables already in use may not he enough and we’d better
open the upstairs storeroom and get some more out, just for today. She meant to
come over herself and see to it, but she’s with Her Ladyship at the moment and can t
get away, so she says would you mind Opening the store?room for her and getting
some of the servants to carry them down?’
Li Wan sent Candida to the storeroom with the keys and told one of the old women
to go to the inner gate and get some of the pages on duty there to help with the
carrying. She herself went and stood in the courtyard behind Prospect Hall and
watched from below while the Painted Chamber was opened up and the tables were
one by one carried down from it. The team of maids, pages and old nannies worked
together with such enthusiasm that soon more than twenty of the little tables had
been manhandled downstairs into the courtyard.
‘Gently now, gently!’ said Li Wan as they were moving them. ‘No need to go at it as
if all the devils in hell were after you! You’ll chip the edges off them if you’re not
careful.’
She turned to Grannie Liu.
‘Wouldn’t you like to go up and have a look?’
The old woman needed no second asking. Holding Ban-er tightly by the hand, she
scrambled up the stairway and looked inside. The interior was stacked high with
folding screens, tables, chairs, lanterns and furniture of every kind. Much of what she
saw she could not identify, but the dull gleam of gold, the rich glow of coloured
lacquers, and the artistry and sump?tuousness of the objects drew many a pious
ejaculation from her before she descended. The door of the storeroom was then
locked and the remaining maids came down.
‘I wonder how energetic Lady Jia will be feeling today,’ said Li Wan. ‘Perhaps while
you are about it you had better get out the oars and punt-poles and paddles and
some boat-awnings as well, in case she decides to go on the water.’
‘Yes’m,’ said the maids, and proceeded to unlock the store?room again and carry
down the items specified. Li Wan mean?while sent one of the pages to tell the
boatwomen that they were to pole a couple of punts out from the boathouse and
have them by in readiness.
While this activity was still in progress, Grandmother Jia arrived at the head of a
troupe of females. Li Wan hurried for?ward to greet her.
‘You are very energetic this morning, Grandmother; I didn’t expect you in the
Garden so soon. I was hoping that you would still be doing your hair. I’ve picked some
chrysan?themums for you to wear and I was just about to send them round to you.’
Even as she was saying this, Casta arrived carrying a large dish of peacock-green glaze
shaped like a lotus-leaf, in which chrysanthemum-flowers of many different colours
were being kept in moisture. Grandmother Jia chose a dark red one to fasten in the
side of her hair. As she turned her head to do so, she caught sight of Grannie Liu and
smiled at her in welcome.
‘Come over here! You must have one too!’
Before she had finished, Xi-feng had already seized the old woman by the hand and
was dragging her over.
‘Come on, let me dress you up properly!’
She began sticking the chrysanthemums into her hair, put?ting them in at every angle,
and continued until all the flowers in the dish had been used up. The effect was so
ludicrous that Grandmother Jia and the rest all burst out laughing. Grannie Liu, not a
whit perturbed, good-humouredly joined in the laughter.
‘I don’t know what my poor old head can have done to deserve so much honour,’
she said.
‘You ought to pull them out and throw them in her lace,’ said the others. ‘She’s
made you look like an old vamp!’
‘I may be getting on now,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘but I used to be a stylish young woman
in my time. I loved to have a bit of powder for my cheek and a flower to wear in my
hair. ‘Tis no matter: now I shall be a stylish old ‘un.’
During this exchange they had been moving towards Drenched Blossoms Pavilion.
Maids went on ahead with a rolled-up patterned rug which they spread out on one of
the bench-boards that ran along the inner sides of the balustrades. Seating herself on
the rug with her back against the railings, Grandmother Jia invited Grannie Liu to sit
down beside her and tell her what she thought of the Garden.
‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘You know, we country folk like to get a picture at
the New Year that we can stick up on the wall. Every year just before New Year the
farmers come into town to buy one. Many’s the time of an evening when the day’s
work was done we’ve sat and looked at the picture on our wall and wished we could
get inside it and walk around, never imagining that such beautiful places could really
be. Yet now I look at this Garden here, and it’s ten times better than any picture I
ever saw. If only I could get someone to make a painting of it all, just the way it is,
that I could take back to show the others, I do believe I should die content!’
Grandmother Jia smilingly pointed a linger in Xi-chun direction.
‘You see my little great-niece over there? She can paint. Shall we get her to do you
a painting of it?’
Grannie Liu jumped up and going over to Xi-chun, took her impulsively by the hand.
‘Dear Miss!’ she said. ‘To think that one so young and pretty should be so gifted
and all! I do believe you must be one of the holy spirits born in a human shape!’
The simple earnestness with which this was uttered made the others all laugh. After
resting a little longer, Grandmother Jia, who intended to show her guest as much of
the Garden as possible, got up again and resumed the tour.
The first place they came to was the Naiad’s House. The green bamboos engulfed
them as they entered the gate and brilliant green moss carpeted the ground beneath.
Through the midst of the bamboos a raised cobbled path wound its way towards the
house. Grannie Liu stepped aside to let Grandmother Jia and the rest walk on it while
she herself walked on the ground below. Amber held a hand out to draw her up.
‘Walk on the path, Grannie! You’ll slip on the moss down there.’
‘Don’t you mind me, my dear!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’m used to it. You keep to the
path, though, with the rest. You don’t want to muddy those fancy shoes of yours.’
Unfortunately the necessity of looking up to talk to some?one who was walking at a
higher level had distracted her attention from the ground beneath, and even as she
said this, her feet slipped on the treacherous moss, her legs flew out from under her,
and she landed on her posterior with a thump. The girls clapped their hands
delightedly. Grandmother Jia laughed too, though trying her hardest to sound cross.
‘Little monsters!’ she said, ‘Don’t just stand there laughing. Help her up!’
But Grannie Liu bad already scrambled up unaided, and was laughing herself.
‘It serves me right,’ she said. ‘I shouldn’t have spoken so soon!’
‘Are you sure you haven’t hurt your back?’ Grandmother Jia asked her. ‘Let one of
the maids massage it for you.’
‘God bless my soul!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’m not that deli?cate! I don’t suppose a day
goes by but what I take a tumble or two. If I was to have meself massaged every time,
it would never
Nightingale was already waiting with the bamboo blind raised for them to enter.
Grandmother Jia led her party through the doorway and sat down inside. Dai-yu
waited on her in person; offering her tea in a covered cup which she carried on a
little tray.
‘We shan’t be taking tea, niece,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Don’t bother to pour for the rest
of us.’
Hearing this, Dai-yu ordered one of the maids to fetch the chair by the window that
she normally sat on herself and bring it up for her aunt to sit on. Grannie Liu noticed
the inkstone and brushes on the table in front of it and all the books on the
bookshelves and said that she supposed this must be ‘the young gentleman’s study’.
Grandmother Jia smiled and pointed to Dai-yu.
‘It belongs to her - my little granddaughter.’
As though incredulous, Grannie Liu studied Dai-yu atten?tively for some moments in
silence.
‘It doesn’t look at all like a young lady’s room,’ she said finally. ‘It looks to me like a
very high-class young gentleman’s study.’
‘Where is Bao-yu, by the way?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘He’s on the lake in one of the punts,’ said the maids.
‘Oh? Whose idea was it to get the punts out?’ she asked.
‘It was my idea,’ said Li Wan hurriedly. ‘It occurred to me just now when we were
getting things out of the storeroom that you might perhaps feel like going on the
water today.’
Grandmother Jia was about to make some comment when Aunt Xue’s arrival was
announced and she rose up, together with the rest of the company, to welcome her.
‘Aren’t you energetic today, Lady Jia!’ said Aunt Xue smilingly when all were seated
once more. ‘Here already!’
‘We were just discussing what sort of fine to impose on late arrivals,’ said
Grandmother Jia teasingly. ‘We didn’t have you in mind, of course!’
A certain amount of good-humoured banter followed. In the course of it
Grandmother Jia chanced to notice that the gauze in Dai-yu’s windows was faded,
and drew Lady Wang’s attention to it.
‘This kind of gauze looks very well on a window when it’s new,’ she said, ‘but after a
while it loses its greenness. Green isn’t a suitable colour for the windows here in any
case. There are no peach or apricot trees outside to make a contrast when they are in
flower, and there is already enough green in all those bamboos. I seem to remember
that we used to have four or five different shades of window gauze somewhere or
other.
You must look some out tomorrow for her and have this changed.’
‘The other day when I had to open the silk-store,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I came across a lot
of rose-coloured “cicada wing” gauze in a long wooden chest. It was a beautiful fresh
colour and the material was beautifully soft and light. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any
quite like it before. I’d like to have taken a couple of lengths of it for facing quilts with.
I’m sure it would make lovely quilts.’
‘Pooh!’ said Grandmother Jia scornfully. ‘I thought you were supposed to be such
an authority on materials — and you can’t even name a gauze properly! You’re not as
clever as you thought, my girl! You’ll have to watch your tongue a bit in future.’
Aunt Xue put in an extenuating word for her niece, while laughing with the rest at
her discomfiture.
‘However much of an authority she may be, I’m sure she would never presume to
compete with you, Lady Jia. If she is wrong about the gauze, you must give her the
benefit of your greater experience and put her right. I am sure the rest of us would
like to know too.’
‘As a matter of fact that gauze is a good deal older than any of you here,’ said
Grandmother Jia, ‘so it is not very surpris?ing that Feng mistook it for cicada wing.
There is a certain resemblance, and cicada wing is what anyone would most likely
take it to be who hadn’t seen it before. The proper name for it, though, is “haze
diaphene”.’
‘What a pretty name!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I must have seen several hundred different
gauzes in my time; but I must con?fess I’ve never heard that name mentioned
before.’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘And what great age have you now reached, my dear, to be talking so freely about
your vast experience? Haze diaphene used to come in four colours: “clear-sky blue”,
“russet green”, “pine green” and “old rose”. Hung up as bed-curtains or pasted in
windows it looks from a distance like a coloured haze. That’s why they called it “haze
diaphene”. The old rose kind is sometimes called “afterglow”. You won’t find fabric
made as fine or as soft as that nowadays, not even among the gauzes made for the
Imperial Household.’
‘Never mind about Feng,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘I’ve never heard about this kind of gauze
before either.’
While they continued to talk about it, Xi-feng sent someone to fetch a piece from the
storeroom.
‘That’s right, that’s it!’ said Grandmother Jia when it arrived. ‘When we first had it,
we used it only for covering windows with, but later on we began experimenting and
found that it made very good quilts and bed-curtains as well. Get a few lengths of it
out tomorrow. You can use the “old rose” kind to re-cover these windows with.’
Xi-feng promised to see to it. Meanwhile the others were examining the gauze and
admiring its quality. Grannie Liu was particularly impressed, uttering a whole series of
‘Holy Names’ as she subjected it to close and careful scrutiny. ‘I could never hope to
get anything as good as this to make a dress with,’ she said. ‘It seems a terrible waste
to use it on windows.’
‘Actually it isn’t much good for clothing,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘What about this, then?’ said Xi-feng, pulling out a flap of the quilted crimson gauze
dress she was wearing underneath her jacket and holding it up for them to see.
‘Yes, very fine,’ said Grandmother Jia, examining it. ‘Ah, yes, now there you are!
This is a modern Imperial Household gauze; but you see it’s still not as good as that
one there.’
‘Well, what do you make of that?’ said Xi-feng. ‘That one there is only an “Official
Use” fabric, yet this one I’m wear?ing, which isn’t as good quality, is “Imperial
Household” !’
‘Anyway, have another look tomorrow,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I think you’ll find
that besides the “old rose” pieces you saw in that chest, there’s a lot of “clear-sky
blue” somewhere as well. If there is, get it all out; give a length of it to our
kins?woman here; I should like two lengths myself for a set of bed-hangings; and any
left over can be matched with suitable lining-material and made up into waistcoats
for the girls. There’s no point in keeping it until it gets mildewed.’
Xi-feng, having first promised that she would do all these things, told the servant who
had brought the sample to take it back to the storeroom.
‘We’re a bit cramped in here,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s move on to somewhere
else now.’
‘They say that “great families live in great houses”,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘and truly,
when I first went into Your Lady?ship’s apartment yesterday and saw those great
chests and cupboards and tables and beds, the size of everything fairly took my
breath away. That great wardrobe of yours is higher and wider than one of our rooms
back home. I’m not sur?prised you keep a ladder in the back courtyard. When I first
saw it, I thought to myself, “Now what can they need a ladder for? They don’t ripen
things on the roofs as we do, so it can’t be for that.” And then of course I realized: it
must be for getting things out of the compartment on top of that ward-robe of yours,
for you could never reach it else. And yet this place here, for all it’s so much smaller,
seems to me more per?fect than your big one. The things here are all so pretty. I
don’t know what they are, some of them, but the more I look at them, the less I want
to leave!’
‘There are other pretty places besides this,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We’re taking you to see
them all.’
As they left the Naiad’s House, they could make out, at some distance from where
they stood, a number of people punting on the lake. Remarking that since the boats
were al?ready out they might just as well use them, Grandmother Jia conducted her
little party in the general direction of Amaryllis Eyot and Flowery Harbour. Before
they had reached the water’s edge, however, a number of elderly women
ap?proached, each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they
make in Soochow, with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately
patterned in needle-en?graving of gold, and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in
their sides. Seeing them approach, Xi-feng asked Lady Wang where she wanted lunch
to be laid.
‘Ask Grandmother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Wherever she wants it, of course.’
Grandmother Jia, who had been moving on, now turned back to tell them.
‘Your Cousin Tan’s would be a nice place to have it. You go on ahead and lay it there,
and the rest of us will follow by boat.’
Xi-feng, accompanied by Li Wan, Tan-chun, Faithful and Amber, led the women with
the lunch-boxes by a short cut to the Autumn Studio. They put out a couple of tables
there in the Paulownia Room.
‘We’re often hearing how the gentlemen at their parties outside have a buffoon to
provide them with their laughs,’ said Faithful while they were getting ready. ‘Today
we’ve got a buffoon of our own — a female one.’
Li Wan, being a good, simple soul, did not understand what she meant; but Xi-feng
knew immediately that she was referring to Grannie Liu and gleefully agreeing that
they should have some laughs at the old woman’s expense, at once began plotting
something with Faithful.
‘You two are awful!’ Li Wan protested laughingly. ‘Anyone would think you were a
couple of mischievous children. And what will Lady Jia say?’
‘Don’t worry, Mrs Zhu!’ said Faithful. ‘You won’t be involved in this one little bit. I
promise to keep you out of it.’
Grandmother Jia now arrived with the others, the company sat down informally, and
maids went round and served every one with tea. When they had all finished their
tea, Xi-feng came in carrying a bundle of silver-tipped and silver-ornamented ebony
chopsticks wrapped in a West Ocean linen napkin, and proceeded to lay the places.
‘Put that little yellow cedar-wood table next to my place so that Mrs Liu can sit by
me,’ said Grandmother Jia.
As the maids hastened to comply, Xi-feng tipped a wink at Faithful, who took the
opportunity presented by this diver?sion to draw Grannie Lu aside and quietly brief
her on the decorums to be observed by anyone eating with the family.
‘It’s part of the rules of this household,’ she told tile old woman in conclusion. ‘If
you don’t do it properly, they will laugh at you.’
The places being now all laid, the company sat down to table, with the exception of
Aunt Xue, who had eaten already and continued sitting where she was, drinking tea.
Bao-yu, Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-chai sat at one of the two large tables with
Grandmother Jia at their head, and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat at the other
one, presided over by Lady Wang. Grannie Liu had a little table of her own next to
Grandmother Jia.
Normally when Grandmother Jia took her meals it was the junior maids who stood
with spittoons, fly-whisks and napkins in their hands behind the chairs. Faithful had
long since graduated from such menial duties. On this occasion, how?ever, she
borrowed a fly-whisk from one of the younger girls and did some whisking herself.
This was a signal for the other maids, who knew that something was afoot, to melt
discreetly away, leaving the stage clear for Faithful. Fly-whisk in hand, Faithful took
up a position on her own and darted a question?ing glance at her victim.
‘All right, Miss, don’t worry!’ said Grannie Liu, and hav?ing settled herself in her
place, picked up her chopsticks. She found them extremely heavy and unwieldy. They
were a pair of old-fashioned, square-handled ivory ones inlaid with gold, which
Xi-feng and Faithful had planted on her in furtherance of their plan.
‘What’s this you’ve given me?’ said Grannie Liu. ‘A pair of tongs? These are heavier
than one of our iron shovels. I shall never be able to manage with these.’
The others all laughed.
A woman-servant now entered carrying one of the luncheon?boxes and stood in the
middle of the room holding it while a maid removed the lid. There were two dishes
inside. Li Wan took out one of them and set it down on Grandmother Jia’s table. The
second, a bowl of pigeon’s eggs (deliberately chosen for their mirth-provoking
possibilities) was taken out by Xi-feng and set down in front of Grannie Liu.
‘Please!’ said Grandmother Jia, waving her chopsticks at the food as a polite
indication that they should begin. At once Grannie Liu leaped to her feet and, in
ringing tones, recited the following grace:
     ‘My name it is Liu,
     I’m a trencherman true;
     I can eat a whole sow
     With her little pigs too.’

Having concluded, she puffed out both her cheeks and stared in front of her with an
expression of great determina?tion.
There was a moment of awestruck silence; then, as it dawned on them that they
really had heard what they thought they had heard, the whole company, both
masters and ser?vants, burst out into roars of laughter.
Shi Xiang-yun, unable to contain herself, spat out a whole mouthful of rice.
Lin Dai-yu, made breathless by laughter, collapsed on the table, uttering weak ‘Aiyos’.
Bao-yu rolled over, convulsed, on to his grandmother’s bosom.
Grandmother Jia, exclaiming helplessly ‘Oh, my heart!’ ‘Oh, my child!’, clung tightly to
her heaving grandson.
Lady Wang pointed an accusing finger at Xi-feng, but laughter had deprived her of
speech.
Aunt Xue exploded a mouthful of tea over Tan-chun’s skirt.
Tan-chun planted a bowlful of rice on the person of Ying-?chun.
Xi-chun got up from the table and going over to her nurse, took her by the hand and
asked her to massage her stomach.
The servants were all doubled up. Some had to go outside where they could squat
down and laugh with abandon. Those who could control themselves sufficiently
helped the casual?ties to mop up or change their clothes.
Only Xi-feng and Faithful remained straight-faced through?out this outburst, politely
urging Grannie Liu to begin. Mani?pulating the unwieldy chopsticks with
considerable difficulty, the old woman prepared to do so.
‘Even your hens here are special,’ she remarked. ‘Such pretty little eggs they lay! I
must see if I can’t get one of these under me belt!’
Under the impact of these remarks the company’s composure, which it had only just
recovered, once more broke down. Grandmother Jia, abandoning any attempt at
self-control, was now actually weeping with laughter. Amber, who feared a seizure,
pounded her energetically on the back.
‘That wicked devil Feng is behind this,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t believe a thing
she tells you!’
‘They cost a silver tael apiece,’ said Xi-feng, as Grannie Liu continued to praise the
diminutive ‘hen’s’ eggs. ‘You should eat them quickly, while they’re still hot. They
won’t be so nice when they’re cold.’
Grannie Liu obediently held out her chopsticks and tried to take hold of one, but the
egg eluded her. After chasing it several times round the inside of the bowl, she did at
last suc?ceed in getting a grip on it. But as she craned forward with open mouth to
reach it, it slipped through the chopsticks and rolled on to the floor. At once she laid
down the chopsticks, and would have gone down on hands and knees to pick it up,
but before she could do so one of the servants had retrieved it and carried it off for
disposal.
‘That’s a tael of silver gone,’ Grannie Liu said regretfully, ‘and we didn’t even hear
the clink!’
The others had by now lost all interest in eating, absorbed by the entertaining antics
of their guest.
‘Who got those chopsticks out?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘They’re not meant for
occasions like this; they’re for using at formal banquets. Whoever it was, I expect it
was that wicked Feng who put them up to it. Take them away at once and get her
another pair!’
The servants had in point of fact had nothing to do with the chryselephantine
chopsticks, which had been smuggled in at the last moment by Faithful and Xi-feng;
nevertheless, on hearing the order, they obediently came forward and replaced them
with a silver and ebony pair like those that had been provided for the rest.
‘Out goes gold and in comes silver!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But when all’s said and done,
our wooden ones at home are han?dier.’
‘If there’s any poison in what you are eating,’ said Xi-feng, ‘the silver will tell you by
changing colour.’
‘If this food is poisoned,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘then what we eat at home must be pure
arsenic. Anyway, I intend to eat it all, come what may!’
Delighted to have found someone who, besides being so amusing, had so evident a
relish for her food, Grandmother Jia insisted on making all her own portion over to
Grannie Liu and ordered one of the older women to go round with a pair of
chopsticks and a bowl and make a selection from all the dishes to give to little Ban-er.
Presently, when they had finished eating, Grandmother Jia and the others moved
into Tan-chun’s bedroom for a chat, while in the Paulownia Room the servants
cleared away the remains of the meal and hastily relaid a table for Li Wan and Xi-feng.
Grannie Liu, who had lingered behind, observed them sitting down at opposite sides
of it to begin their meal. She was greatly impressed by this glimpse of the upper-class
etiquette which requires young married women to eat on their own when the rest
have finished.
‘What I like best of all here,’ she said, ‘is your way of doing things. I’m not surprised
they say that “good breeding is to be found in great houses”.’
The compliment was sincerely meant, but Xi-feng under?stood it in a different sense.
‘I do hope we haven’t hurt your feelings,’ she said. ‘It was only a joke, you know.’
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Faithful came hurrying in.
‘Please don’t be offended, Mrs Liu. I’ve come in to apolo?gize.’
‘Bless you, I’m not offended!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘We were only cheering up Her
Ladyship, dear old soul. What should I be offended for? I knew when you told me to
say those things it was only for a laugh. If I’d felt offended, I should never have said
them.’
A chastened Faithful turned angrily on the other servants. ‘Come on! Why aren’t you
pouring Mrs Liu some tea?’ ‘That’s all right,’ said Grannie Liu hurriedly. ‘I’ve had some
already. I drank the tea that the young woman handed to me a while ago. You get on
with your own lunch, Miss. Don’t mind me!’
Xi-feng took Faithful by the hand.
‘Yes, eat now with us. It’ll keep you out of mischief.’ Faithful sat down and one of
the old women laid another bowl for her and another pair of chopsticks. When the
three young women had finished, Grannie Liu, who had been watching them,
remarked on how little they had eaten.
‘None of you here seems to eat more than a bite or two,’ she said. ‘It’s a marvel to
me you’re not famished. No wonder you all look as if the wind could blow you over!’
‘There is a lot left over today,’ Faithful commented. ‘Where are all the others?’ she
asked the old serving-woman.
‘They’re still here in waiting, Miss,’ said the old woman. ‘They’re not off duty yet.
We can give it to them, if you like, before they go.’
‘They’ll never finish all this lot,’ said Faithful. ‘Pick out a couple of bowlfuls and take
them to Patience in Mrs Lian’s room.’
‘No need,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She’s had her lunch already.’
‘If she can’t eat it herself, she can give it to the cat,’ said Faithful.
The old woman put the contents of two of the dishes into a box and carried it off to
give Patience.
‘Where’s Candida?’ said Faithful.
‘She’s in there eating with the rest,’ said Li Wan. ‘What do you want her for?’
‘It’s all right,’ said Faithful. ‘Nothing.’
‘Aroma isn’t here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why don’t you send her a couple of dishes?’
Faithful gave orders for this to be done. She inquired of the remaining old women
whether the boxes for the drinking party were ready yet.
‘I think they’ll be a while yet,’ said one of them.
‘Hurry them up a bit, will you?’ said Faithful, and the old woman went off to do her
bidding.
The young women, accompanied by Grannie Liu, now went into Tan-chun’s room,
where Grandmother Jia and the others were chatting and laughing together.
This room, a three-frame apartment which Tan-chun, who loved spaciousness, had
left undivided, had in the midst of it a large rosewood table with a Yunnanese marble
top piled high with specimen-books of calligraphy and littered with several dozen
miscellaneous ink-stones and a small forest of writing-brushes standing in
brush-holders and brush-stands of every conceivable shape and size. On one side of
the table was a bucket-sized ‘pincushion’ flower-vase of Ru ware stuck all over with
snow-white pompom chrysanthemums. On the west wall of the room hung a
‘Landscape in Mist and Rain’ by Mi Fei, flanked by a pair of scrolls bearing a couplet
written by the Tang calligrapher Yan Zhen-qing:

   My heart has discovered true ease amidst the clouds and mists of the
mountains;
   My life has gained a fierce freedom from the rocks and torrents of the fells.

Against the wall beneath was a long, high table. On it, to?wards the left, stood a large
Northern Song porcelain dish heaped with those ornamental citrus fruits they call
‘Buddha’s hands’, whose brilliant yellow contrasted agreeably with the greenish blue
of the glaze. To the right a white jade chime in the form of a two-headed fish hung in
a varnished wooden frame to whose side a tiny hammer was attached. Ban-er, whom
growing familiarity was making bolder, was with diffi?culty restrained from
unfastening the hammer and striking the fish with it. He then said that he wanted
one of the ‘yellow things’ to eat, and Tan-chun selected a Buddha’s hand from the
dish and gave it to him.
‘There you are,’ she said, ‘but it’s only to play with. It isn’t good to eat.’
On the opposite side of the room was a large four-poster bed whose silk gauze
hangings had a pattern of bright green plants and insects in reversible embroidery.
Ban-er ran over to it and began identifying the insects:
‘That’s a cricket. That’s a grasshopper
Grannie Liu dealt him a hefty slap:
‘Little varmint! Who said you could go running around putting your dirty hands on
everything? Just because you’ve been allowed in to have a look, it doesn’t mean you
have to start getting above yourself.’
The blow had been hard enough to make him cry, and it took the combined efforts of
the others present to comfort him.
Meanwhile Grandmother Jia had been looking through the gauze-covered windows
into the courtyard behind.
‘Those paulownias by the verandah eaves are still very fine,’ she remarked. ‘It’s a
pity they’ve begun losing their leaves.’
A little gust of wind blew across the courtyard as she spoke, bearing on it a faint
strain of music from outside.
‘That must be a wedding,’ she said. ‘I didn’t realize we were so near to the street
here.’
‘You could never hear the street from here, Mother,’ said Lady Wang, laughing.
‘Those are our twelve little actresses rehearsing.’
‘If they’re going to be playing anyway,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘we may as well have
them to play in here. It will be entertainment for us and it will make an outing of
sorts for them.’
Xi-feng at once ordered the troupe to be summoned, and made hurried
arrangements for a long table to be brought in, that the actresses could sit down to
perform at, and covered with a red rug.
‘Much better put them in Xi-chun’s water pavilion,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The
music will sound even better coming across the water. Later on when we take our
wine we can sit in the downstairs of the Painted Chamber. It’s nice and open there
and close enough to the pavilion for listening to the music from.’
Everyone agreed that this would be a good idea.
Grandmother Jia now turned with a smile to Aunt Xue.
‘I think we’d better be on our way now. These young people don’t much like having
visitors, you know. They are terrified of getting their rooms dirty. We mustn’t be
tactless and overstay our welcome. I think we’d better take another little turn in the
boats now, and then it will be just about time to go and have our drinks.’
‘How unfair!’ said Tan-chun laughing. ‘When I ask you or Mother or Aunt Xue to
come here, you never do.’
‘Oh, my little Tan is all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s those two Yus who are so
detestable. We shall go and brawl in their rooms later on when we are drunk!’
The others (including the detestable Yus) all laughed.
Emerging in a single group from the Autumn Studio, they arrived after a short walk at
Duckweed Island, where their specially imported Soochow boatwomen were waiting
with two elegantly decorated punts. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Grannie
Liu, Faithful and Silver were handed one by one aboard the first one. They were
joined a little later by Li Wan, and finally by Xi-feng, who stood in the bows and said
she was going to punt.
‘Feng!’ Grandmother Jia called nervously from inside the cabin. ‘It’s too dangerous
to fool about. It isn’t like the open river here, but it’s still quite deep. Come in here
with us!’
‘It’s all right, Grannie! Don’t be nervous!’ said Xi-feng, laughing, as she shoved off
from the bank. But the punt, being somewhat overloaded, was hard to manage, so
that by the time they were in midstream she was already in difficulties and had to
hand the pole over to one of the boatwomen and sit down rather abruptly on her
haunches.
When their elders were safely away, Bao-yu and the six girls got into the second punt
and were poled along in the wake of the first one. The maids and older women
proceeded in the same direction on foot along the shore.
These raggedy-looking lotus-leaves everywhere are rather ugly,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t
think why they haven’t been cleared away.’
‘Now when could they have been?’ said Bao-chai. ‘With parties being held here
practically every day this autumn, the Garden has never been free long enough.’
‘I can’t abide the poems of Li Shang-yin,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but there is just one line of
his that I am rather fond of:

Leaves but dead lotus-leaves for the rain to play on.

Trust you not to “leave the dead lotus-leaves”!’
‘It is a good line, I agree,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ll tell them that in future they are not to
remove them.’
They were drifting into Flowery Harbour now, and the dank chill of its creeper-hung
grotto seemed to penetrate their bones. Dead reeds and dying caltrop-leaves added
to the autumnal melancholy of the scene. A clean, airy-looking build?ing was visible
at some distance beyond the bank above.
‘Isn’t that Bao-chai’s place?’ said Grandmother Jia.
On being told that it was, she asked the women to moor the boats there, and having
disembarked, ascended from the landing-stage by a flight of cloud-shaped stone
steps and proceeded, with the rest of the party, to the gateway of Allspice Court.
A delectable fragrance assailed their nostrils as they en?tered. Outside the house the
leaves of the mysterious, un?namable creepers had turned an even intenser green in
the colder weather, and where before there had been flowers, there now hung
trusses of the most beautiful coral-red berries. Indoors, however, it was stark and
bare. The only decoration in Bao-chai’s room was a vase of the cheaper kind of Ding
ware on the table, with a few chrysanthemums in it. Apart from the flowers there
were only a few books and some tea?-things on the table. The bed-hangings were of
black gauze, and the quilts and covers were of the same forbidding plain?ness as the
hangings.
‘This child is really too self-effacing!’ Grandmother Jia mut?tered, evidently
shocked by what she saw. The tone in which she addressed Bao-chai was a somewhat
reproachful one: ‘If you haven’t any things of your own, why ever didn’t you as your
Aunt Wang for some? I’m afraid I never thought about it before. Of course. I realize
now. You must have left all your stuff behind in Nanking.’
She at once ordered Faithful to supply Bao-chai with some Ornaments, and then
turned, with some asperity, on Xi-feng.
‘Really, Feng! I do think it rather stingy of you! Couldn’t you have spared your
cousin a few knick-knacks?’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng both laughed.
‘She said herself that she didn’t want any. We gave her some things, but she sent
them all back again.’
Aunt Xue corroborated this.
‘She was just the same in Nanking, Lady Jia. She’s never cared much for that sort of
thing.’
Grandmother Jia shook her head.
‘That will never do. It saves trouble, no doubt, to keep one’s room so bare. But
what would any of our relations think if they were to come here and see this?
Besides, it isn’t natural for a young girl to be so austere. If girls are to live so austerely,
what sort of a stable ought an old woman like me to live in? Think of the descriptions
of young ladies’ boudoirs you find in plays and romances such exquisite refinement
of luxury! I’m not exactly suggesting that you should emulate them — but you
shouldn’t fall too far short, all the same. After all, when the things are there for the
asking, it seems silly not to use them. Use them sparingly, by all means, if your tastes
are on the austere side; but don’t dispense with them alto?gether! I’ve always had
rather a flair for decorating interiors. I don’t exercise it much nowadays, because I’m
too old; but I think the girls have inherited a little of it from me. The thing one always
has to be on one’s guard against is bad taste - which generally means no more than
arranging good things in a bad way. I don’t think any of my girls has bad taste. Now
why don’t you let me decorate this room for you? I promise you it shall look both
dignified and austere. There are still a few things tucked away in my dowry that
Bao-yu doesn’t know about. (I wouldn’t let him see them, or they’d have disappeared
long ago!).’
She called Faithful to her and instructed her what to bring. ‘I want you to fetch that
bonseki and the little screen and the little tripod of smoky agate. Those three things
arranged on the table here will be enough. There’s also a set of white satin hangings
hand-painted in black ink. I’d like you to get them too and put them up in place of
these bed-curtains.’
‘Yes, madam,’ said Faithful. ‘But these things are all stored in the attic over the east
wing and I’m not sure which chests they’re in, so it will take me quite a while to find
them. Can’t I leave it until tomorrow?’
‘Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is immaterial,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘as long
as it gets done.’
After sitting for a while longer in Bao-chai’s room, they got up and again moved on to
the covered area underneath the Painted Chamber. élégante and the other little
actresses came forward to make their curtseys and to inquire what pieces they
should play.
‘Choose a few of the ones you are most familiar with,’ said Grandmother Jia, and
the little actresses went off to the Lotus Pavilion. No further mention of them is
made in this part of our narrative.
Supervised by Xi-feng, the servants had by now completed the seating arrangements
for the drinking-party. Two wooden couches covered with woven grass mats and
embroidered cushions had been placed side by side at the head. Each had a pair of
carved lacquer tables in front of it. On one of each pair there was an incense set — a
miniature metal vase, a miniature cassolette and a miniature tripod, all for burning
different kinds of incense in - on the other was a large lacquer box. These two
couches with a pair of tables each were for Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue.
Of the places ranged below them only one, Lady Wang’s, had a couch and two tables;
all the rest had one table and a chair. On the east side, nearest to Grandmother Jia,
sat Grannie Liu with Lady Wang below her; on the west side Xiang-yun had been laid
first, nearest to Aunt Xue, then Bao-chai, then Dai-yu, then Ying-chun, then Tan-chun,
then Xi-chun, with Bao-yu in the very last place of all. A table and chairs had been
laid for Li Wan and Xi-feng between the inner and outer mosquito screens which
protected those inside the room from the insects of the lake.
The little lacquer tables were of many different shapes — some four-lobed like a
begonia leaf, some five-lobed like plum-flowers, some shaped like multi-petalled
sunflowers, some like lotus leaves, some square, some round - and the lacquer boxes
were designed to match the shapes of the tables. Everyone had his own nielloed
silver ‘self-service’ wine kettle and a little polychrome cloisonné winecup.
‘Well now,’ said Grandmother Jia when they were all seated, ‘let’s have a cup or
two to warm up on, and after that I think it would be more fun if we played a
drinking game.’
‘I am sure you know lots of good ones,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but what about the rest of
us? I am afraid this is just a trick to make us all drunk. We might just as well drink the
extra cups now, since we’re bound to lose anyway, and forget about the game!’
‘ Come, Mrs Xue, you’re being excessively modest all of a sudden!’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘But perhaps you think I’m too old for this sort of thing?’
‘No, no, no. And I’m not being modest, either,’ said Aunt Xue, laughing. ‘I am afraid
of not being able to give the answers and making a fool of myself.’
‘Even if we can’t give the answers,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it only means drinking a few
more cups of wine. And if we get drunk, we can go to bed. No one is going to laugh at
us, I hope!’
Aunt Xue smiled and nodded.
‘Very well, I shall do as I am told then. But I think Lady Jia ought to drink a cup first,
as proposer of the game.’
‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia, and drained off a cup forthwith.
Xi-feng stepped forward into their midst to make a proposal:
‘If you are going to play a drinking game, may I suggest that you have Faithful as
your M. C.?’
The others, knowing that when Grandmother Jia played drinking games it was
generally Faithful who helped her out, agreed readily to this proposal, whereupon
Xi-feng went to fetch Faithful and drew her into their midst.
‘If Faithful is going to be our M.C.,’ said Lady Wang, ‘we can’t possibly have her
standing up all the time.’ She turned to one of the little maids behind her: ‘Put a chair
for her over there, will you, where Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian are sitting.’
When the chair had been brought, Faithful, offering polite resistance, allowed herself
to be propelled towards it, and having first apologized for the liberty of doing so, sat
down. At once she established her authority by drinking a bumper-cup.
‘Right,’ she said. ‘The rules of drinking are as strict as the rules of war. Now that
you’ve made me your M. C., any of you who doesn’t do exactly as I say, no matter
who it is, has to pay a forfeit.’
‘Agreed, agreed,’ said the others. ‘Hurry up and tell us what the game is.’
Before she could do so, Grannie Liu, waving her hand in protest, got up and began to
go.
‘’Tisn’t right to make sport of folks like this. I’m going home!’
‘No, no, we can’t have that!’ said the others, laughing.
‘Back to the chair with her!’ Faithful shouted to the younger maids. They complied
gleefully, seizing the old woman on either side and marching her back to her seat.
‘Let me off this game!’ she pleaded, as they forced her into it; but Faithful was
adamant.
‘Another word from you,’ she said, ‘and you’ll be made to drink a whole kettleful as
a punishment.’
Grannie Liu’s protests then ceased.
‘What I’m going to do,’ said Faithful, ‘is to call threesomes with the dominoes,
starting from Her Old Ladyship, going round in an anti-clockwise direction, and
ending up with Mrs Liu. First I shall make a separate call for each of the three
dominoes and after that I shall make a call for the whole three?some, so you’ll get
four calls each. Every time I call, you’ve got to answer with something that rhymes
and that has some connection with the call. It can be something from a poem or
song or ballad, or it can be a proverb or some well-known expression anything you
like as long as there is a connection and it rhymes.’
‘Good!’ said the others approvingly. ‘That’s a good game. Let’s have a call then.’
‘Right,’ said Faithful. ‘Here comes the first one.’ She laid down a double six. ‘On my
left the bright blue sky.’
‘The Lord looks down from heaven on high,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Bravo!’ said the others.
The second domino was a five-six.
‘Five and six together meet,’ said Faithful.
‘By Six Bay Bridge the flowers smell sweet.’
‘Leaves six and ace upon the right.’
‘The red sun in the sky so bright,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Altogether that makes: “A shock-headed devil with hair like tow”,’ said Faithful.
‘The devil shouts, “Zhong Kui, let me go!”,’ said Grand?mother Jia.
Amidst laughter, and applause for the successful completion of her turn, she picked
up and drained her winecup.
‘Here comes the next one,’ said Faithful, laying down a double five. ‘On my left all
the fives I find.’
‘Plum-blossoms dancing in the wind,’ said Aunt Xue.
‘On my right all the fives again,’ said Faithful.
‘Plum-blossoms in the tenth month’s rain,’ said Aunt Xue.
‘Between them, two and five make seven.’
‘On Seventh Night the lovers meet in heaven.’
‘Together that gives: “The Second Prince plays in the Five Holy Hills”.’
‘The immortals dwell far off from mortal ills.’
Again there was applause, and Aunt Xue drank her wine.
‘Next threesome coming up,’ said Faithful. ‘All the aces, one and one.’
‘Two lamps for earth, the moon and sun,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘On my right once more aces all.’
‘And flowers to earth in silence fall,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Between them, ace again with four.’
‘Apricot trees make the sun’s red-petalled floor,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Together that makes nine ripe cherries.’
‘Winged thieves have stripped the Emperor’s trees of ber?ries,’ said Xiang-yun, and
drank her wine.
‘A pair on the left then, three and three,’ said Faithful.
‘Swallows in pairs round the old roof-tree,’ said Bao-chai.
‘A pair of threes upon the right,’ said Faithful.
‘Green duckweed-trails on the water bright.’
‘A three and six between them lie.’
‘Three peaks upon the rim of sky,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Together that gives “The lone
boat tied with an iron chain”,’ said Faithful.
‘The waves on every hand and the heart’s pain,’ said Bao-chai, and drank what
remained in her winecup.
‘Sky on the left, the good fresh air,’ said Faithful, putting down a double six.
‘Bright air and brilliant morn feed my despair,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-chai, recognizing the quotation, turned and stared; but Dai-yu was too intent on
keeping her end up to have noticed.
‘A four and a six, the Painted Screen,’ said Faithful.
‘No Reddie at the window seen,’ said Dai-yu, desperately dredging up a line this
time from The Western Chamber to meet the emergency.
‘A two and a six, four twos make eight.’
‘In twos walk backwards from the Hall of State,’ said Dai?-yu, on safer ground with
a line from Du Fu.
‘Together makes: “A basket for the flowers you pick”,’ said Faithful.
‘A basket of peonies slung from his stick,’ Dai-yu con?cluded, and took a sip of her
wine.
‘Four and five, the Flowery Nine,’ said Faithful.
‘The flowering peach-tree drenched with rain,’ said Ying-chun.
‘Forfeit! Forfeit!’ said the others, laughing. ‘It doesn’t rhyme; and besides, the
words don’t fit.’
Ying-chun laughed and sipped her wine. As a matter of fact her failure was
intentional. Eager for more laughs, Xi-feng and Faithful had secretly intimated to the
four remaining cousins that they should give the wrong answers on purpose, in order
to come the more quickly to Grannie Liu. Accordingly Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Bao-yu,
all deliberately fell down on their first calls as well, leaving only Lady Wang to dispose
of, which Faithful accomplished by the simple expedient of sup?plying the answers
for her herself. It was now Grannie Liu’s turn.
‘We often play a game like this ourselves back home when we get together of an
evening,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘only the way we do it, it doesn’t sound so pretty as this.
Howsomever. I don’t mind having a try.’
‘It’s easy, really,’ said the others. ‘Don’t worry about what it sounds like. Just say
what comes naturally.’
Faithful began to lay.
‘A pair of fours on the left, the Man.’
Grannie Liu was a good long while puzzling over this. Finally she said.
‘Is it a farmer?’
The others roared with laughter.
‘That’s all right,’ said Grandmother Jia reassuringly. ‘That answer will do very well.’
‘You young people shouldn’t laugh at me,’ said Grannie Liu to the others. ‘I’m a
countrywoman born and I can’t help my country talk.’
‘Green three, red four, contrasting colours,’ called Faithful.
‘The fire burns up the caterpillars,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Why, so it might,’ said the others. ‘Stick to your “country talk”, Grannie, you’re
doing fine!’
‘Red four on the right and the ace is red,’ said Faithful.
‘A turnip and a garlic-head.’
More laughter.
‘ “That Flower” those three together show,’ said Faithful.
‘This flower will to a pumpkin grow,’ said the flower-bedecked ancient, gesturing
with her hands to demonstrate the size of the imagined pumpkin.
The following chapter will show how the party progressed.
