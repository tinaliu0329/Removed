      "‘Brother Stone, according to what you yourself seem to imply in these verses, this\n",
      "story of yours contains matter of sufficient interest to merit publication and has been\n",
      "carved here with that end in view. But as far as I can see (a) it has no discoverable\n",

      "for some trifling talent or insignificant virtue. Even if I were to copy all this out, I\n",
      "cannot see that it would make a very remarkable book.’\n",

      "that it could speak) ‘must you be so obtuse? All the romances ever written have an\n",
      "artificial period setting—Han or Tang for the most part. In refusing to make use of\n",
      "that stale old convention and telling my Story of the Stone exactly as it occurred, it\n",
      "seems to me that, far from depriving it of anything, I have given it a freshness these\n",
      "other books do not have.\n",
      "‘ Your so-called “historical romances”, consisting, as they do, of scandalous\n",
      "anecdotes about statesmen and emperors of bygone days and scabrous attacks on\n",
      "the reputations of long-dead gentlewomen, contain more wickedness and immorality\n",
      "than I care to mention. Still worse is the “erotic novel”, by whose filthy obscenities\n",
      "our young folk are all too easily corrupted. And the “boudoir romances”, those dreary\n",
      "stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their\n",
      "different characters undistinguishable except by name (all those ideally beautiful\n",
      "young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors)— even they seem unable to avoid\n",
      "descending sooner or later into indecency.\n",
      "“The trouble with this last kind of romance is that it only gets written in the first\n",
      "place because the author requires a framework in which to show off his love-poems.\n",
      "He goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically, beginning with the\n",
      "names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character, a servant or\n",
      "the like, to make mischief between them, like the chou in a comedy.\n",
      "‘What makes these romances even more detestable is the stilted, bombastic\n",

      "particularly wealthy one, but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry\n",
      "as the leading family in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "     Zhen Shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totality unambitious person. He\n",
      "devoted his time to his garden and to the pleasures of wine and poetry. Except for a\n",
      "single flaw, his existence could, indeed, have been described as an idyllic one. The\n",
      "flaw was that, although already past fifty, he had no son, only a little girl, just two\n",
      "years old, whose name was Ying-lian.\n",
      "     Once, during the tedium of a burning summer's day, Shi-yin was sitting idly in his\n",

      "onto the desk in a doze. While in this drowsy state he seemed to drift off to some\n",
      "place he could not identify, where he became aware of a monk and a Taoist walking\n",

      "     ‘Where do you intend to take that thing you are carrying?’ the Taoist was asking.\n",

      "     When this strange pair reached Shi-yin’s door and saw him standing there\n",
      "holding Ying-lian, the monk burst into loud sobs. ‘Patron,’ he said, addressing Shi-yin,\n",
      "'what are you doing, holding in your arms that ill-fated creature who is destined to\n",
      "involve both her parents in her own misfortune?'\n",
      "Shi-yin realized that he was listening to the words of a madman and took no notice.\n",
      "But the monk persisted:\n",
      "‘Give her to me! Give her to me!’\n",
      "Shi-yin was beginning to lose patience and clasping his little girl tightly to him, turned\n",
      "on his heel and was about to re-enter the house when the monk pointed his finger at\n",
      "him, roared with laughter, and then proceeded to intone the following verses:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fond man, your pampered child to cherish so—\n",
      "That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow!\n",
      "Beware the high feast of the fifteenth day,\n",
      "When all in smoke and fire shall pass away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Shi-yin heard all this quite plainly and was a little worried by it. He was thinking or\n",
      "asking the monk what lay behind these puzzling words when he heard the Taoist say,\n",
      "‘We don’t need to stay tether. Why don’t we part company here and each go about\n",
      "his own business? Three kalpas from now I shall wait far you on Bei-mang Hill. Having\n",
      "joined forces again there, we can go together to the Land of Illusion to sign off.’\n",
      "‘Excellent!’said the other. And the two if them went off and soon were both lost to\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "'There must have been something behind all this, ‘thought Shi-yin to himself.’1 really\n",
      "ought to have asked him what he meant, but now it is too late.'\n",
      "He was still standing outside his door brooding when Jia Yu-cun, the poor student\n",
      "who lodged at the Bottle-gourd Temple next door, came up to him. Yu-cun was a\n",
      "native of Hu-zhou and came from a family of scholars and bureaucrats which had,\n",
      "however, fallen on bad times when Yu-cun was born. The family fortunes on both his\n",
      "father’s and mother’s side had all been spent, and the members of the family had\n",
      "themselves gradually died off until only Yu-cun was left There were no prospects for\n",
      "\f",
      "him in his home town, so he had set off for the capital, in search of fame and fortune.\n",
      "Unfor?tunately he had got no further than Soochow when his funds ran out, and he\n",
      "had now been living there in poverty for a year, lodging in this temple and keeping\n",
      "himself alive by working as a copyist. For this reason Shi-yin saw a great deal of his\n",
      "company.\n",
      "     As soon as he caught sight of Shi-yin, Yu-cun clasped his hands in greeting and\n",
      "smiled ingratiatingly. ‘I could see you standing there gazing, sir. Has anything been\n",
      "happening in the street?’\n",
      "     ‘No, no,’ said Shi-yin. ‘It just happened that my little girl was crying, so I brought\n",
      "her out here to amuse her. Your coming is most opportune, dear boy. I was beginning\n",
      "to feel most dreadfully bored. Won’t you come into my little den, and we can help\n",
      "each other to while away this tedious hot day?’\n",
      "     So saying, he called for a servant to take the child indoors, while he himself took\n",
      "Yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study, where his boy served them both with\n",
      "tea. But they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words before one of the servants\n",
      "rushed in to say that ‘Mr Yan had come to pay a call.’ Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and\n",
      "excused himself: ‘I seem to have brought you here under false pretences. I do hope\n",
      "you will forgive me. If you don’t mind sitting on your own here for a moment, I shall\n",
      "be with you directly.’\n",
      "     Yu-cun rose to his feet too. ‘Please do not distress yourself on my account, sir. I\n",
      "am a regular visitor here and can easily wait a bit.’ But by the time he had finished\n",
      "saying this, Shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guest-room.\n",
      "     Left to himself, Yu-cun was flicking through some of Shi?-yin’s books of poetry in\n",
      "order to pass the time, when he heard a woman's cough outside the window.\n",
      "Immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was. The cough appeared to\n",
      "have come from a maid who was picking flowers in the garden. She was an unusually\n",
      "good-looking girl with a rather refined face: not a great beauty, by any means, but\n",
      "with something striking about her. Yu-cun gazed at her spellbound.\n",
      "    Having now finished picking her flowers, this anonymous member of the Zhen\n",
      "household was about to go in again when, on some sudden impulse, she raised her\n",
      "head and caught sight of a man standing in the window. His hat was frayed and his\n",
      "clothing threadbare; yet, though obviously poor, he had a fine, manly physique and\n",
      "handsome, well-proportioned features.\n",
      "    The maid hastened to remove herself from this male presence; but as she went\n",
      "she thought to herself, ‘What a fine-looking man! But so shabby! The family hasn’t\n",
      "got any friends or relations as poor as that. It must be that Jia Yu-cun the master is\n",
      "always on about. No wonder he says that he won’t stay poor long. I remember\n",
      "hearing him say that he’s often wanted to help him but hasn’t yet found an\n",
      "\f",
      "opportunity.’ And thinking these thoughts she could not forbear to turn back for\n",
      "another peep or two.\n",
      "     Yu-cun saw her turn back and, at once assuming that she had taken a fancy to\n",
      "him, was beside himself with delight. What a perceptive young woman she must be,\n",
      "he thought, to have seen the genius underneath the rags! A real friend in trouble!\n",
      "     After a while the boy came in again and Yu-cun elicited from him that the visitor\n",
      "in the front room was now staying to dinner. It was obviously out of the question to\n",
      "wait much longer, so he slipped down the passage-way at the side of the house and\n",
      "let himself out by the back gate. Nor did Shi-yin invite him round again when, having\n",
      "at last seen off his visitor, he learned that Yu-cun had already left.\n",
      "     But then the Mid Autumn festival arrived and, after the family convivialities were\n",
      "over, Shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to\n",
      "invite Yu-cun, walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight.\n",
      "     Ever since the day the Zhens’ maid had, by looking back twice over her shoulder,\n",
      "convinced him that she was a friend, Yu-cun had had the girl very much on his mind,\n",
      "and now that it was festival time, the full moon of Mid Autumn lent an inspiration to\n",
      "his romantic impulses which finally resulted in the following octet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ere on ambition's path my feet are set,\n",
      "Sorrow comes often this poor heart to fret.\n",
      "Yet, as my brow contracted with new care,\n",
      "Was there not one who, parting, turned to stare?\n",
      "Dare I, that grasp at windows in the wind,\n",
      "Hope, underneath the moon, a friend to find?\n",
      "Bright orb, if with my plight you sympathize,\n",
      "Shine first upon the chamber where she lies.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Having delivered himself of this masterpiece, Yu-cun’s thoughts began to run on his\n",
      "unrealized ambitions and, after much head-scratching and many heavenward glances\n",
      "ac?companied by heavy sighs, he produced the following couplet, reciting it in a loud,\n",
      "ringing voice which caught the ear of Shi-yin, who chanced at that moment to be\n",
      "arriving:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy.\n",
      "The jade pin in the drawer hides, waiting its time to fly.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Shi-yin smiled. ‘You are a man of no mean ambition, Yu-cun.’\n",
      "‘Oh no!’Yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly. ‘You are too flattering. I was merely\n",
      "\f",
      "reciting at random from the lines of some old poet. But what brings you here, sir?’\n",
      "‘Tonight is Mid Autumn night,’said Shi-yin. ‘People call it the Festival of Reunion. It\n",
      "occurred to me that you might be feeling rather lonely here in your monkery, so I\n",
      "have arranged for the two of us to take a little wine together in my study. I hope you\n",
      "will not refuse to join me.’\n",
      "Yu-cun made no polite pretence of declining. ‘Your kind?ness is more than I deserve,’\n",
      "he said. ‘I accept gratefully.’ And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door.\n",
      "Soon they had finished their tea. Wine and various choice dishes were brought in\n",
      "and placed on the table, already laid out with cups, plates, and so forth, and the two\n",
      "men took their places and began to drink. At first they were rather slow and\n",
      "ceremonious; but gradually, as the conversation grew more animated, their potations\n",
      "too became more reckless and un?inhibited. The sounds of music and singing which\n",
      "could now be heard from every house in the neighbourhood and the full moon which\n",
      "shone with cold brilliance overhead seemed to increase their elation, so that the\n",
      "cups were emptied almost as soon as they touched their lips, and Yu-cun, who was\n",
      "already a sheet or so in the wind, was seized with an irrepressible excitement to\n",
      "which he presently gave expression in the form of a quatrain, ostensibly on the\n",
      "subject of the moon, but really about the ambition he had hitherto been at some\n",
      "pains to conceal:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In thrice five nights her perfect O is made,\n",
      "Whose cold light bathes each marble balustrade.\n",
      "As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways,\n",
      "On earth ten thousand heads look up and gaze.’\n",
      "\n",
      "     ‘Bravo!’said Shi-yin loudly. 'I have always insisted that you were a young fellow\n",
      "who would go up in the world, and now, in these verses you have just recited, I see\n",
      "an augury of your ascent. In no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds! This\n",
      "calls for a drink!' And, saying this, he poured Yu-cun a large cup of wine.\n",
      "     Yu-cun drained the cup, then, surprisingly, sighed:\n",
      "     ‘Don't imagine the drink is making me boastful, but I really do believe that if it\n",
      "were just a question of having the sort of qualifications now in demand, I should\n",
      "stand as good a chance as any of getting myself on to the list of candidates. The\n",
      "trouble is that I simply have no means of laying my hands on the money that would\n",
      "be needed for lodgings and travel expenses. The journey to the capital is a long one,\n",
      "and the sort of money I can earn from my copying is not enough—’\n",
      "     ‘Why ever didn't you say this before?’ said Shi-yin inter?rupting him. ‘I have long\n",
      "wanted to do something about this, but on all the occasions I have met you\n",
      "\f",
      "previously, the con?versation has never got round to this subject, and I haven't liked\n",
      "to broach it for fear of offending you. Well, now we know where we are. I am not a\n",
      "very clever man, but at least I know the right thing to do when I see it. Luckily, the\n",
      "next Triennial is only a few months ahead. You must go to the capital without delay. A\n",
      "spring examination triumph will make you feel that all your studying has been worth\n",
      "while. I shall take care of all your expenses. It is the least return I can make for your\n",
      "friendship.’ And there and then he instructed his boy to go with all speed and make\n",
      "up a parcel of fifty tales of the best refined silver and two suits of winter clothes.\n",
      "     ‘The almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travel?ling,’ he went on,\n",
      "addressing Yu-cun again. ‘You can set about hiring a boat for the journey straight\n",
      "away. How de?lightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have\n",
      "distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates!’\n",
      "     Yu-cun accepted the silver and the clothes with only the most perfunctory word\n",
      "of thanks and without, apparently, giving them a further moment’s thought, for he\n",
      "continued to drink and laugh and talk as if nothing had happened. It was well after\n",
      "midnight before they broke up.\n",
      "After seeing Yu-cun off, Shi-yin went to bed and slept without a break until the sun\n",
      "was high in the sky next morn?ing. When he awoke, his mind was still running on the\n",
      "con?versation of the previous night. He thought he would write a couple of\n",
      "introductory letters for Yu-cun to take with him to the capital, and arrange for him to\n",
      "call on the family of an official he was acquainted with who might be able to put him\n",
      "up; but when he sent a servant to invite him over, the servant brought back word\n",
      "from the temple as follows:\n",
      "'The monk says that Mr Jia set out for the capital at five o'clock this morning, sir. He\n",
      "says he left a message to pass on to you. He said to tell you, “A scholar should not\n",
      "concern himself with almanacs, but should act as the situation de?mands,”and he\n",
      "said there wasn't time to say good-bye.'\n",
      "So Shi-yin was obliged to let the matter drop.\n",

      "Fifteenth Night, and Shi-yin sent little Ying-lian out, in the charge of one of the\n",
      "servants called Calamity, to see the mummers and the coloured lanterns. It was near\n",
      "midnight when Calamity, feeling an urgent need to relieve his bladder, put Ying-lian\n",
      "down on someone’s doorstep while he went about his business, only to find, on his\n",
      "\f",
      "return, that the child was nowhere to be seen. Frantically he searched for her\n",
      "throughout the rest of the night; but when day dawned and he had still not found her,\n",
      "he took to his heels, not daring to face his master and mistress, and made off for\n",
      "another part of the country.\n",
      "Shi-yin and his wife knew that something must be wrong when their little girl failed\n",
      "to return home all night. Then a search was made; but all those sent out were\n",

      "The shock of so sudden a loss to a middle-aged couple who had only ever had the\n",
      "one daughter can be imagined. In tears every day and most of the night, they almost\n",
      "lost the will to go on living, and after about a month like this first Shi-yin and then his\n",
      "wife fell ill, so that doctors and diviners were in daily attendance on them.\n",
      "     Then, on the fifteenth of the third month, while frying cakes for an offering, the\n",
      "monk of Bottle-gourd Temple carelessly allowed the oil to catch alight, which set fire\n",
      "to the paper window. And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and\n",
      "bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction\n",
      "anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away\n",
      "like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time\n",
      "they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away\n",
      "all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families\n",
      "homeless in the process.\n",
      "Poor Zhens! Though they and their handful of domestics escaped unhurt, their house,\n",

      "After some discussion with his wife, Shi-yin decided that they should move to their\n",
      "farm in the country; but a series of crop failures due to flooding and drought had led\n",
      "to wide?spread brigandage in those parts, and government troops were out\n",
      "everywhere hunting down the mutinous peasants and making arrests. In such\n",
      "conditions it was impossible to settle on the farm, so Shi-yin sold the land and, taking\n",
      "only two of the maids with them, went with his wife to seek refuge with his\n",
      "father-in-law, Feng Su.\n",
      "     This Feng Su was a Ru-zhou man who, though only a farmer by calling, had a very\n",

      "like a refugee on his doorstep; but fortunately Shi- yin had on him the money he had\n",
      "realized from the sale of the farm, and this he now entrusted to his father-in-law to\n",
      "buy for him, as and when he could, a house and land on which he could depend for\n",
      "his future livelihood. Feng Su embezzled about half of this sum and used the other\n",
      "half to provide him with a ruinous cottage and some fields of poor, thin soil.\n",
      "A scholar, with no experience of business or agricultural matters, Shi-yin now found\n",

      "himself poorer after a year or two of struggle than when he had started. Feng Su\n",
      "would treat him to a few pearls of rustic wisdom whenever they met, but behind his\n",
      "back would grumble to all and sundry about 'incompetents' and 'people who liked\n",

      "One day, wishing to take his mind off his troubles for a bit, he had dragged himself,\n",

      "gossip to gossip until it reached the ears of Mrs Zhen, who cried herself into fits when\n",

      "third generation, and it was only through the magnanimity of the reigning sovereign\n",
      "that an exceptional act of grace had extended it for a further generation in the case\n",

      "had up to his time enjoyed hereditary emoluments, it had nevertheless enjoined a\n",
      "high standard of education on all of its members.\n",

      "parents doted on her, and because she showed exceptional intelligence, conceived\n",
      "the idea of giving her a rudimentary education as a substitute for bringing up a son,\n",

      "this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a\n",
      "recurrent sickness, and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons.\n",
      "Bored by his enforced idleness, Yu-cun took to going for walks as soon as lunch was\n",
      "over whenever the weather was warm and sunny.\n",
      "One day a desire to savour country sights and sounds led him outside the city walls,\n",
      "and as he walked along with no fixed destination in mind, he presently found himself\n",
      "in a place ringed with hills and full of murmuring brooks and tall stands of bamboo\n",
      "where a temple stood half-hidden among the trees. The walled approach to the\n",
      "gateway had fallen in and parts of the surrounding wall were in ruins. A board above\n",

      "As long as there is a sufficiency behind you, you press greedily forward.\n",

      "It is only when there is no road in front of you that you think of turning back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The wording is commonplace to a degree,’ Yu-cun reflected, ‘yet the sentiment is\n",
      "\f",
      "quite profound. In all the famous temples and monasteries I have visited, I cannot\n",
      "recollect having ever seen anything quite like it. I shouldn’t be surprised to find that\n",
      "some story of spectacular downfall and dramatic conversion lay behind this\n",
      "inscription. It might be worth going in and inquiring.’\n",
      "But when he went inside and looked around, he saw only an ancient, wizened monk\n",
      "cooking some gruel who paid no attention whatsoever to his greetings and who\n",
      "proved, when Yu-cun went up to him and asked him a few questions, to be both deaf\n",
      "and partially blind. His toothless replies were all but unintelligible, and in any case\n",
      "bore no relation to the questions.\n",
      "Yu-cun walked out again in disgust. He now thought that in order to give the full rural\n",
      "flavour to his outing he would treat himself to a few cups of wine in a little country\n",
      "inn and accordingly directed his steps towards the near-by village. He had scarcely\n",
      "set foot inside the door of the village inn when one of the men drinking at separate\n",
      "tables inside rose up and advanced to meet him with a broad smile.\n",
      "‘Fancy meeting you!’\n",
      "It was an antique dealer called Leng Zi-xing whom Yu-cun had got to know some\n",
      "years previously when he was staying in the capital. Yu-cun had a great admiration\n",
      "for Zi-xing as a practical man of business, whilst Zi-xing for his part was tickled to\n",
      "claim acquaintanceship with a man of Yu-cun’s great learning and culture. On the\n",
      "basis of this mutual admiration the two of them had got on wonderfully well, and\n",
      "Yu-cun now returned the other’s greeting with a pleased smile.\n",
      "‘My dear fellow! How long have you been here? I really had no idea you were in\n",
      "these parts. It was quite an accident that I came here today at all. What an\n",
      "extraordinary coincidence!’\n",
      "‘I went home at the end of last year to spend New Year with the family,’ said Zi-xing.\n",
      "‘On my way back to the capital I thought I would stop off and have a few words with\n",
      "a friend of mine who lives hereabouts, and he very kindly invited me to spend a few\n",
      "days with him. I hadn’t got any urgent business waiting for me, so I thought I might as\n",
      "well stay on a bit and leave at the middle of the month. I came out here on my own\n",
      "because my friend has an engagement today. I certainly didn’t expect to run into you\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "Zi-xing conducted Yu-cun to his table as he spoke and ordered more wine and some\n",
      "fresh dishes to be brought. The two men then proceeded, between leisurely sips of\n",
      "wine, to relate what each had been doing in the years that had elapsed since their\n",
      "last meeting.\n",
      "Presently Yu-cun asked Zi-xing if anything of interest had happened recently in the\n",
      "capital.\n",
      "‘I can’t think of anything particularly deserving of mention,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Except,\n",
      "\f",
      "perhaps, for a very small but very unusual event that took place in your own clan\n",
      "there.’\n",
      "‘What makes you say that?’ said Yu-cun, ‘I have no family connections in the\n",
      "capital.’\n",
      "‘Well, it’s the same name,’ said Zi-xing. ‘They must be the same clan.’\n",
      "Yu-cun asked him what family he could be referring to.\n",
      "‘I fancy you wouldn’t disown the Jias of the Rong-guo mansion as unworthy of you.’\n",
      "‘Oh, you mean them,’ said Yu-cun. ‘There are so many members of my clan, it’s\n",
      "hard to keep up with them all. Since the time of Jia Fu of the Eastern Han dynasty\n",
      "there have been branches of the Jia clan in every province of the empire. The\n",
      "Rong-guo branch is, as a matter of fact, on the same clan register as my own; but\n",
      "since they are exalted so far above us socially, we don’t normally claim the\n",
      "connection, and nowa?days we are completely out of touch with them.’\n",
      "Zi-xing sighed. ‘You shouldn’t speak about them in that way, you know. Nowadays\n",
      "both the Rong and Ning mansions are in a greatly reduced state compared with what\n",
      "they used to be.’\n",
      "‘When I was last that way the Rong and Ning mansions both seemed to be fairly\n",
      "humming with life. Surely nothing could have happened to reduce their prosperity in\n",
      "so short a time?’\n",
      "‘Ah, you may well ask. But it’s a long story.’\n",
      "‘Last time I was in Jinling,’ went on Yu-cun, ‘I passed by their two houses one day on\n",
      "my way to Shi-tou-cheng to visit the ruins. The Ning-guo mansion along the eastern\n",
      "half of the road and the Rong-guo mansion along the western half must between\n",
      "them have occupied the greater part of the north side frontage of that street. It’s\n",
      "true that there wasn’t much activity outside the main entrances, but looking up over\n",
      "the outer walls I had a glimpse of the most magnificent and imposing halls and\n",
      "pavilions, and even the rocks and trees of the gardens beyond seemed to have a\n",
      "sleekness and luxuriance that were certainly not suggestive of a family whose\n",
      "fortunes were in a state of decline.’\n",
      "‘Well! For a Palace Graduate Second Class, you ought to know better than that!\n",
      "Haven’t you ever heard the old saying, “The beast with a hundred legs is a long time\n",
      "dying”? Although I say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past, of\n",
      "course I don’t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their\n",
      "circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average\n",
      "government official. At the moment the numbers of their establishment and the\n",
      "activities they engage in are, if anything, on the increase. Both masters and servants\n",
      "all lead lives of luxury and magnificence. And they still have plenty of plans and\n",
      "projects under way. But they can’t bring themselves to economize or make any\n",
      "\f",
      "adjustment in their ac?customed style of living. Consequently, though outwardly they\n",
      "still manage to keep up appearances, inwardly they are beginning to feel the pinch.\n",
      "But that’s a small matter. There’s something much more seriously wrong with them\n",
      "than that. They are not able to turn out good sons, those stately houses, for all their\n",
      "pomp and show. The males in the family get more degenerate from one generation\n",
      "to the next.’\n",
      "‘Surely,’ said Yu-cun with surprise, ‘it is inconceivable that such highly cultured\n",
      "households should not give their children the best education possible? I say nothing\n",
      "of other families, but the Jias of the Ning and Rong households used to be famous for\n",
      "the way in which they brought up their sons. How could they come to be as you\n",
      "describe?’\n",
      "‘I assure you, it is precisely those families I am speaking of. Let me tell you\n",
      "something of their history. The Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo were two\n",
      "brothers by the same mother. Ning-guo was the elder of the two. When he died, his\n",
      "eldest son, Jia Dai-hua, inherited his post. Dai?hua had two sons. The elder, Jia Fu,\n",
      "died at the age of eight or nine, leaving only the second son, Jia Jing, to inherit.\n",
      "Nowadays Jia Jing’s only interest in life is Taoism. He spends all his time over retorts\n",
      "and crucibles concocting elixirs, and refuses to be bothered with anything else.\n",
      "‘Fortunately he had already provided himself with a son, Jia Zhen, long before he\n",
      "took up this hobby. So, having set his mind on turning himself into an immortal, he\n",
      "has given up his post in favour of this son. And what’s more he refuses outright to\n",
      "live at home and spends his time fooling around with a pack of Taoists somewhere\n",
      "outside the city walls.\n",
      "‘This Jia Zhen has got a son of his own, a lad called Jia Rong, just turned sixteen.\n",
      "With old Jia Jing out of the way and refusing to exercise any authority, Jia Zhen has\n",
      "thrown his res[omsiblities to thw winds and given himself up to a life of pleasure. He\n",
      "has turned that Ning-guo mansion upside down, but there is no one around who\n",
      "dares gainsay him.\n",
      "‘Now I come to the Rong household—it was there that this strange event occurred\n",
      "that I was telling you about. When the old Duke of Rong-guo died, his eldest son, Jia\n",
      "Dai-shan, inherited his emoluments. He married a girl from a very old Nanking family,\n",
      "the daughter of Marquis Shi, who bore him two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘Dai-shan has been dead this many a year, but the old lady is still alive. The elder\n",
      "son, Jia She, inherited; but he’s only a very middling sort of person and doesn’t play\n",
      "much part in running the family. The second son, though, Jia Zheng, has been mad\n",
      "keen on study ever since he was a lad. He is a very upright sort of person, straight as\n",
      "a die. He was his grand?father’s favourite. He would have sat for the examinations,\n",
      "but when the emperor saw Dai-shan’s testamentary memorial that he wrote on his\n",
      "\f",
      "death bed, he was so moved, thinking what a faithful servant the old man had been,\n",
      "that he not only ordered the elder son to inherit his father’s position, but also gave\n",
      "instructions that any other sons of his were to be pre?sented to him at once, and on\n",
      "seeing Jia Zheng he gave him the post of Supernumerary Executive Officer, brevet\n",
      "rank, with instructions to continue his studies while on the Minis?try’s payroll. From\n",
      "there he Jias now risen to the post of Under Secretary.\n",
      "‘Sir Zheng’s lady was formerly a Miss Wang. Her first child was a boy called Jia Zhu.\n",
      "He was already a Licensed Scholar at the age of fourteen. Then he married and had a\n",
      "son. But he died of an illness before he was twenty. The second child she bore him\n",
      "was a little girl, rather remarkable because she was born on New Year’s day. Then\n",
      "after an interval of twelve years or more she suddenly had another son. He was even\n",
      "more remarkable, because at the moment of his birth he had a piece of beautiful,\n",
      "clear, coloured jade in his mouth with a lot of writing on it. They gave him the name\n",
      "“Bao-yu” as a consequence. Now tell me if you don’t think that is an extraordinary\n",
      "thing.’\n",
      "‘It certainly is,’ Yu-cun agreed. ‘I should not be at all surprised to find that there was\n",
      "something very unusual in the heredity of that child.’\n",
      "‘Humph,’ said Zi-xing. ‘A great many people have said that. That is the reason why\n",
      "his old grandmother thinks him such a treasure. But when they celebrated the First\n",
      "Twelve month and Sir Zheng tested his disposition by putting a lot of objects in front\n",
      "of him and seeing which he would take hold of, he stretched out his little hand and\n",
      "started playing with some women’s things –combs, bracelets, pots of rouge and\n",
      "powder and the like—completely ignoring all the other ob?jects. Sir Zheng was very\n",
      "displeased. He said he would grow up to be a rake, and ever since then he hasn’t felt\n",
      "much affection for the child. But to the old lady he’s the very apple of her eye.\n",

      "him manage the family’s affairs. However, ever since he married this young lady I\n",
      "mentioned, every?one high and low has joined in praising her, and he has been put\n",
      "into the shade rather. She is not only a very handsome young woman, she also has a\n",
      "very ready tongue and a very good head – more than a match for most men, I can tell\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "‘You see, I was not mistaken,’ said Yu-cun. ‘All these people you and I have been\n",

      "shut out of the city. Why not continue the conversation on our way back? Then we\n",
      "can take our time.’\n",
      "The two men accordingly rose from their seats, settled the bill for the wine, and were\n",

      "wife; so there will be no one here to act as a mother to you. It isn’t, either, as if you\n",
      "had sisters who could help to take care of you. You know how often you are poorly.\n",

      "On the day of her arrival in the capital, Dai-yu stepped ashore to find covered chairs\n",
      "from the Rong mansion for her and her women and a cart for the luggage ready\n",
      "waiting on the quay.\n",
      "     She had often heard her mother say that her Grandmother Jia’s home was not\n",
      "like other people’s houses. The servants she had been in contact with during the past\n",
      "few days were comparatively low-ranking ones in the domestic hierarchy, yet the\n",
      "food they ate, the clothes they wore, and everything about them was quite out of\n",
      "the ordinary. Dai-yu tried to imagine what the people who employed these superior\n",
      "beings must be like. When she arrived at their house she would have to watch every\n",
      "step she took and weigh every word she said, for if she put a foot wrong they would\n",
      "surely laugh her to scorn.\n",
      "     Dai-yu got into her chair and was soon carried through the city walls. Peeping\n",
      "through the gauze panel which served as a window, she could see streets and\n",
      "buildings more rich and elegant and throngs of people more lively and numerous\n",
      "than she had ever seen in her life before. After being carried for what seemed a very\n",
      "great length of time, she saw, on the north front of the east-west street through\n",
      "which they were passing, two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple\n",
      "gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads. In front of the gateway\n",
      "ten or so splendidly dressed flunkeys sat in a row. The centre of the three gates was\n",
      "closed, but people were going in and out of the two side ones. There was a board\n",
      "above the centre gate on which were written in large characters the words:\n",

      "NING-GUO HOUSE\n",
      "Founded and Constructed by\n",
      "Imperial Command\n",

      "lived. The chair proceeded some dis?tance more down the street and presently there\n",

      "\n",
      "RONG-GUO HOUSE\n",
      "\f",
      "above it.\n",
      "    Ignoring the central gate, her bearers went in by the western entrance and after\n",
      "traversing the distance of a bow-shot inside, half turned a corner and set the chair\n",
      "down. The chairs of her female attendants which were following behind were set\n",
      "down simultaneously and the old women got out. The places of Dai-yu’s bearers\n",
      "were taken by four handsome, fresh-faced pages of seventeen or eighteen. They\n",
      "shouldered her chair and, with the old women now following on foot, carried it as far\n",
      "as an ornamental inner gate. There they set it down again and then retired in\n",
      "respectful silence. The old women came forward to the front of the chair, held up the\n",
      "curtain, and helped Dai-yu to get out.\n",
      "    Each hand resting on the outstretched hand of an elderly attendant, Dai-yu\n",
      "passed through the ornamental gate into a courtyard which had balustraded loggias\n",
      "running along its sides and a covered passage-way through the center. The\n",
      "fore?ground of the courtyard beyond was partially hidden by a screen of polished\n",
      "marble set in an elaborate red sandalwood frame. Passing round the screen and\n",
      "through a small reception hall beyond it, they entered the large courtyard of the\n",
      "man?sion’s principal apartments. These were housed in an imposing five-frame\n",
      "building resplendent with carved and painted beams and rafters which faced them\n",
      "across the courtyard. Running along either side of the courtyard were galleries hung\n",
      "with cages containing a variety of different-coloured parrots, cockatoos, white-eyes,\n",
      "and other birds. Some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main\n",
      "building opposite. At the appearance of the visitors they rose to their feet and came\n",
      "forward with smiling faces to welcome them.\n",
      "    ‘You’ve come just at the right time! Lady Jia was only this moment asking about\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "    Three or four of them ran to lift up the door-curtain, while another of them\n",
      "announced in loud tones,\n",
      "    ‘Miss Lin is here!’\n",
      "    As Dai-yu entered the room she saw a silver-haired old lady advancing to meet\n",
      "her, supported on either side by a servant. She knew that this must be her\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and would have fallen on her knees and made her kotow, but before\n",
      "she could do so her grandmother had caught her in her arms and pressing her to her\n",
      "bosom with cries of ‘My pet!’ and ‘My poor lamb!’ burst into loud sobs, while all\n",
      "those present wept in sympathy, and Dai-yu felt herself crying as though she could\n",
      "never stop. It was some time before those present succeeded in calming them both\n",
      "down and Dai-yu was at last able to make her kotow.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now introduced those present.\n",
      "‘This is your elder uncle’s wife, Aunt Xing. This is your Uncle Zheng’s wife, Aunt\n",

      "Wang. This is Li Wan, the wife of your Cousin Zhu, who died.’\n",
      "Dai-yu kowtowed to each of them in turn.\n",
      "‘Call the girls!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them that we have a very special visitor\n",
      "and that they need not do their lessons today.’\n",
      "There was a cry of ‘Yes ma’am’ from the assembled maids, and two of them went off\n",
      "to do her bidding.\n",
      "Presently three girls arrived, attended by three nurses and five or six maids.\n",
      "The first girl was of medium height and slightly plumpish, with cheeks as white and\n",
      "firm as a fresh lychee and a nose as white and shiny as soap made from the white\n",
      "goose-fat. She had a gentle, sweet, reserved manner. To look at her was to love her.\n",
      "The second girl was rather tall, with sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She had\n",
      "an oval face under whose well-formed brows large, expressive eyes shot out glances\n",
      "that sparkled with animation. To look at her was to forget all that was mean or vulgar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third girl was undersized and her looks were still some?what babyish and\n",
      "unformed.\n",
      "All three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of\n",
      "bracelets and hair ornaments.\n",
      "Dai-yu rose to meet them and exchanged curtseys and intro?ductions. When she was\n",
      "seated once more, a maid served tea, and a conversation began on the subject of her\n",
      "mother: how her illness had started, what doctors had been called in, what\n",
      "medicines prescribed, what arrangements had been made for the funeral, and how\n",
      "the mourning had been observed. This conversation had the foreseeable effect of\n",
      "upsetting the old lady all over again.\n",
      "‘Of all my girls your mother was the one I loved the best,’ she said, ‘and now she’s\n",
      "been the first to go, and without my even being able to see her again before the end.\n",
      "I can’t help being upset!’ And holding fast to Dai-yu’s hand, she once more burst into\n",
      "tears. The rest of the company did their best to comfort her, until at last she had\n",
      "more or less re?covered\n",
      "Everyone’s attention now centred on Dai-yu. They ob?served that although she was\n",
      "still young, her speech and manner already showed unusual refinement. They also\n",
      "noticed the frail body which seemed scarcely strong enough to bear the weight of its\n",
      "clothes, but which yet had an inexpressible grace about it, and realizing that she\n",
      "must be suffering from some deficiency, asked her what medicine she took for it and\n",
      "why it was still not better.\n",
      "‘I have always been like this,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have been taking medicine ever since I\n",
      "could eat and been looked at by ever so many well-known doctors, but it has never\n",
      "done me any good. Once, when I was only three, I can remember a scabby-headed\n",
      "\f",
      "old monk came and said he wanted to take me away and have me brought up as a\n",
      "nun; but of course, Mother and Father wouldn’t hear of it. So he said, “Since you are\n",
      "not prepared to give her up, I am afraid her illness will never get better as long as she\n",
      "lives. The only way it might get better would be if she were never to hear the sound\n",
      "of weeping from this day onwards and never to see any relations other than her own\n",
      "mother and father. Only in those conditions could she get through her life without\n",
      "trouble.” Of course, he was quite crazy, and no one took any notice of the things he\n",
      "said. I’m still taking Ginseng Tonic Pills.’\n",
      "‘Well, that’s handy,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I take the Pills myself. We can easily tell\n",
      "them to make up a few more each time.’\n",
      "She had scarcely finished speaking when someone could be heard talking and\n",
      "laughing in a very loud voice in the inner courtyard behind them.\n",
      "‘Oh dear! I’m late,’ said the voice. ‘I’ve missed the arrival of our guest.’\n",
      "‘Everyone else around here seems to go about with bated breath,’ thought Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Who can this new arrival be who is so brash and unmannerly?’\n",
      "Even as she wondered, a beautiful young woman entered from the room behind the\n",
      "one they were sitting in, surrounded by a bevy of serving women and maids. She was\n",
      "dressed quite differently from the others present, gleaming like some fairy princess\n",
      "with sparkling jewels and gay embroideries.\n",
      "Her chignon was enclosed in a circlet of gold filigree and clustered pearls. It was\n",
      "fastened with a pin embellished with flying phoenixes, from whose beaks pearls were\n",
      "suspended on tiny chains.\n",
      "Her necklet was of red gold in the form of a coiling dragon. Her dress had a fitted\n",
      "bodice and was made of dark red silk damask with a pattern of flowers and\n",
      "butterflies in raised gold thread.\n",
      "Her jacket was lined with ermine. It was of a slate-blue stuff with woven insets in\n",
      "coloured silks.\n",
      "Her under-skirt was of a turquoise-coloured imported silk crêpe embroidered with\n",
      "flowers.\n",
      "She had, moreover,\n",
      "eyes like a painted phoenix,\n",
      "eyebrows like willow-eaves,\n",
      "a slender form,\n",
      "seductive grace;\n",
      "the ever-smiling summer face\n",
      "of hidden thunders showed no trace;\n",
      "the ever-bubbling laughter started\n",
      "almost before the lips were parted.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘You don’t know her,’ said Grandmother Jia merrily. ‘She’s a holy terror this one.\n",
      "What we used to call in Nanking a “peppercorn”. You just call her “Peppercorn Feng”.\n",
      "She’ll know who you mean!’\n",
      "Dai-yu was at a loss to know how she was to address this Peppercorn Feng until one\n",
      "of the cousins whispered that it was ‘Cousin Lian’s wife’, and she remembered having\n",
      "heard her mother say that her elder uncle, Uncle She, had a son called Jia Lian who\n",
      "was married to the niece of her Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. She had been\n",
      "brought up from earliest childhood just like a boy, and had acquired in the\n",
      "schoolroom the somewhat boyish-sounding name of Wang Xi-feng. Dai-yu\n",
      "accordingly smiled and curtseyed, greeting her by her correct name as she did so.\n",
      "Xi-feng took Dai-yu by the hand and for a few moments scrutinized her carefully from\n",
      "top to toe before conducting her back to her seat beside Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘She’s a beauty, Grannie dear! If I hadn’t set eyes on her today, I shouldn’t have\n",
      "believed that such a beautiful creature could exist! And everything about her so\n",
      "distingué!She doesn’t take after your side of the family, Grannie. She’s more like a Jia.\n",
      "I don’t blame you for having gone on so about her during the past few days—but\n",
      "poor little thing! What a cruel fate to have lost Auntie like that!’ and she dabbed at\n",
      "her eyes with a handkerchief.\n",
      "‘I’ve only just recovered,’ laughed Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t you go trying to start me\n",
      "off again! Besides, your little cousin is not very strong, and we’ve only just managed\n",
      "to get her cheered up. So let’s have no more of this!’\n",
      "In obedience to the command Xi-feng at once exchanged her grief for merriment.\n",
      "‘Yes，of course. It was just that seeing my little cousin here put everything else out\n",
      "of my mind. It made me want to laugh and cry all at the same time. I’m afraid I quite\n",
      "forgot about you, Grannie dear. I deserve to be spanked, don’t I?’\n",
      "She grabbed Dai-yu by the hand.\n",
      "‘How old are you dear? Have you begun school yet? You mustn’t feel home sick\n",
      "here. If there’s anything you want to eat or anything you want to play with, just come\n",
      "and tell me. And you must tell me if any of the maids or the old nannies are nasty to\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Dai-yu made appropriate responses to all of these questions and injunctions.\n",
      "Xi-feng turned to the servants.\n",
      "‘Have Miss Lin’s things been brought in yet? How many people did she bring with\n",
      "her? You’d better hurry up and get a couple of rooms swept out for them to rest in.’\n",
      "While Xi-feng was speaking, the servants brought in tea and various plates of food,\n",
      "the distribution of which she pro?ceeded to supervise in person.\n",
      "Dai-yu noticed her Aunt Wang questioning Xi-feng on the side:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Have this month’s allowances been paid out yet?’\n",
      "‘Yes. By the way, just now I went with some of the women to the upstairs\n",
      "storeroom at the back to look for that satin. We looked and looked, but we couldn’t\n",
      "find any like the one you described yesterday. Perhaps you misremembered.’\n",
      "‘Oh well, if you can’t find it, it doesn’t really matter,’ said Lady Wang. Then, after a\n",
      "moment’s reflection, ‘You’d better pick out a couple of lengths presently to have\n",
      "made up into clothes for your little cousin here. If you think of it, send someone\n",
      "round in the evening to fetch them!’\n",
      "‘It’s already been seen to. I knew she was going to arrive within a day or two, so I\n",
      "had some brought out in readiness. They are waiting back at your place for your\n",
      "approval. If you think they are all right, they can be sent over straight away.’\n",
      "Lady Wang merely smiled and nodded her head without saying anything.\n",
      "The tea things and dishes were now cleared away, and Grandmother Jia ordered two\n",
      "old nurses to take Dai-yu round to see her uncles; but Uncle She’s wife, Lady Xing,\n",
      "hurriedly rose to her feet and suggested that it would be more convenient if she\n",
      "were to take her niece round herself.\n",
      "‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You go now, then. There is no need for you to\n",
      "come back afterwards.’\n",
      "So having, together with Lady Wang, who was also return?ing to her quarters, taken\n",
      "leave of the old lady, Lady Xing went off with Dai-yu, attended across the courtyard\n",
      "as far as the covered way by the rest of the company.\n",
      "A carriage painted dark blue and hung with kingfisher-blue curtains had been drawn\n",
      "up in front of the ornamental gateway by some pages. Into this Aunt Xing ascended\n",
      "hand in hand with Dai-yu. The old women pulled down the carriage blind and\n",
      "ordered the pages to take up the shafts, the pages drew the carriage into an open\n",
      "space and harnessed mules to it, and Dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the\n",
      "west gate, east?wards past the main gate of the Rong mansion, in again through a big\n",
      "black-lacquered gate, and up to an inner gate, where they were set down again.\n",
      "Holding Dai-yu by the hand, Aunt Xing led her into a courtyard in the middle of what\n",
      "she imagined must once have been part of the mansion’s gardens. This impression\n",
      "was strengthened when they passed through a third gateway into the quarters\n",
      "occupied by her uncle and aunt; for here the smaller scale and quiet elegance of the\n",
      "halls, galleries and loggias were quite unlike the heavy magnificence and impos?ing\n",
      "grandeur they had just come from, and ornamental trees and artificial rock\n",
      "formations, all in exquisite taste, were to be seen on every hand.\n",
      "As they entered the main reception hall, a number of heavily made-up and\n",
      "expensively dressed maids and concubines, who had been waiting in readiness, came\n",
      "forward to greet them.\n",
      "\f",
      "Aunt Xing asked Dai-yu to be seated while she sent a ser?vant to call Uncle She. After\n",
      "a considerable wait the servant returned with the following message:\n",
      "‘The Master says he hasn’t been well these last few days, and as it would only upset\n",
      "them both if he were to see Miss Lin now, he doesn’t feel up to it for the time being.\n",
      "He says, tell Miss Lin not to grieve and not to feel homesick. She must think of her\n",
      "grandmother and her aunts as her own family now. He says that her cousins may not\n",
      "be very clever girls, but at least they should be company for her and help to take her\n",
      "mind off things. If she finds anything at all here to distress her, she is to speak up at\n",
      "once. She mustn’t feel like an outsider. She is to make herself completely at home.’\n",
      "Dai-yu stood up throughout this recital and murmured polite assent whenever assent\n",
      "seemed indicated. She then sat for about another quarter of an hour before rising to\n",
      "take her leave. Her Aunt Xing was very pressing that she should have a meal with her\n",
      "before she went, but Dai-yu smilingly replied that though it was very kind of her aunt\n",
      "to offer, and though she ought really not to refuse, nevertheless she still had to pay\n",
      "her respects to her Uncle Zheng, and feared that it would be disrespectful if she were\n",
      "to arrive late. She hoped that she might accept on another occasion and begged her\n",
      "aunt to excuse her.\n",
      "‘In that case, never mind,’ said Lady Xing, and instructed the old nurses to see her\n",
      "to her Uncle Zheng’s in the same carriage she had come by. Dai-yu formally took her\n",
      "leave, and Lady Xing saw her as far as the inner gate, where she issued a few more\n",
      "instructions to the servants and watched her niece’s carriage out of sight before\n",
      "returning to her rooms.\n",
      "Presently they re-entered the Rong mansion proper and Dai-yu got down from the\n",
      "carriage. There was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate,\n",
      "along which the old nurses now conducted her. Turning right, they led her down a\n",
      "roofed passage-way along the back of a south-facing hall, then through an inner gate\n",
      "into a large courtyard.\n",
      "The big building at the head of the courtyard was connected at each end to galleries\n",
      "running through the length of the side buildings by means of ‘stag’s head’ roofing\n",
      "over the corners. The whole formed an architectural unit of greater sumptuous?ness\n",
      "and magnificence than anything Dai-yu had yet seen that day, from which she\n",
      "concluded that this must be the main inner hall of the whole mansion.\n",
      "High overhead on the wall facing her as she entered the hall was a great blue board\n",
      "framed in gilded dragons, on which was written in large gold characters\n",
      "\n",
      "THE HALL OF EXALTED FELICITY\n",
      "\n",
      "with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words ‘....\n",
      "\f",
      "written for Our beloved Subject, Jia Yuan,.Duke of Rong-guo’, followed by the\n",
      "Emperor’s private seal, a device containing the words ‘kingly cares’ and ‘royal brush’\n",
      "in archaic seal-script.\n",
      "A long, high table of carved red sandalwood, ornamented with dragons, stood\n",
      "against the wall underneath. In the centre of this was a huge antique bronze ding,\n",
      "fully a yard high, covered with a green patina. On the wall above the ding hung a long\n",
      "vertical scroll with an ink-painting of a dragon emerg?ing from clouds and waves, of\n",
      "the kind often presented to high court officials in token of their office. The ding was\n",
      "flanked on one side by a smaller antique bronze vessel with a pattern of gold inlay\n",
      "and on the other by a crystal bowl. At each side of the table stood a row of eight\n",
      "yellow cedar-wood armchairs with their backs to the wall; and above the chairs hung,\n",
      "one on each side, a pair of vertical ebony boards inlaid with a couplet in characters of\n",
      "gold:\n",
      "  (on the right-hand one)\n",
      "May the jewel of learning shine in this house more effulgently than the sun and\n",
      "moon.\n",
      "  (on the left-hand one)\n",
      "May the insignia of honour glitter in these halls more brilliantly than the starry sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was followed by a colophon in smaller characters:\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Respectful Compliments of your Fellow-\n",
      "Student, Mu Shi, Hereditary Prince of Dong-an.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Wang did not, however, normally spend her leisure hours in this main reception\n",
      "hall, but in a smaller room on the east side of the same building. Accordingly the\n",
      "nurses con?ducted Dai-yu through the door into this side apartment.\n",
      "Here there was a large kang underneath the window, covered with a scarlet Kashmir\n",
      "rug. In the middle of the kang was a dark-red bolster with a pattern of medallions in\n",
      "the form of tiny dragons, and a long russet-green seating strip in the same pattern. A\n",
      "low rose-shaped table of coloured lacquer-work stood at each side. On the left-hand\n",
      "one was a small, square, four-legged ding, together with a bronze ladle, metal\n",
      "chop?sticks, and an incense container. On the right-hand one was a narrow-waisted\n",
      "Ru-ware imitation gu with a spray of freshly cut flowers in it.\n",
      "In the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the\n",
      "east wall. All had footstools in front of them and chair-backs and seat-covers in old\n",
      "rose brocade sprigged with flowers. There were also narrow side-tables on which tea\n",
      "things and vases of flowers were arranged, besides other furnishings which it would\n",
      "\f",
      "be superfluous to enumerate.\n",
      "The old nurses invited Dai-yu to get up on the kang; but guessing that the brocade\n",
      "cushions arranged one on each side near the edge of it must be her uncle’s and\n",
      "aunt’s places, she deemed it more proper to sit on one of the chairs against the wall\n",
      "below. The maids in charge of the apartment served tea, and as she sipped it Dai-yu\n",
      "observed that their clothing, make?up, and deportment were quite different from\n",
      "those of the maids she had seen so far in other parts of the mansion.\n",
      "Before she had time to finish her tea, a smiling maid came in wearing a dress of red\n",
      "damask and a black silk sleeveless jacket which had scalloped borders of some\n",
      "coloured material.\n",
      "‘The Mistress says will Miss Lin come over to the other side, please.’\n",
      "The old nurses now led Dai-yu down the east gallery to a reception room at the side\n",
      "of the courtyard. This too had a kang. It was bisected by a long, low table piled with\n",
      "books and tea things. A much-used black satin back-rest was pushed up against the\n",
      "east wall. Lady Wang was seated on a black satin cushion and leaning against another\n",
      "comfortable-looking back-rest of black satin somewhat farther forward on the\n",
      "opposite side.\n",
      "Seeing her niece enter, she motioned her to sit opposite her on the kang, but Dai-yu\n",
      "felt sure that this must be her Uncle Zheng’s place. So, having observed a row of\n",
      "three chairs near the kang with covers of flower-sprigged brocade which looked as\n",
      "though they were in fairly constant use, she sat upon one of those instead. Only after\n",
      "much further pressing from her aunt would she get up on the kang, and even then\n",
      "she would only sit beside her and not in the position of honour opposite.\n",
      "‘Your uncle is in retreat today,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He will see you another time.\n",
      "There is, however, something I have got to talk to you about. The three girls are very\n",
      "well-behaved children, and in future, when you are studying or sewing together, even\n",
      "if once in a while they may grow a bit high-spirited, I can depend on them not to go\n",
      "too far. There is only one thing that worries me. I have a little monster of a son who\n",
      "tyrannizes over all the rest of this household. He has gone off to the temple today in\n",
      "fulfillment of a vow and is not yet back; but you will see what I mean this evening.\n",
      "The thing to do is never to take any notice of him. None of your cousins dare provoke\n",
      "him.’\n",
      "Dai-yu had long ago been told by her mother that she had a boy cousin who was\n",
      "born with a piece of jade in his mouth and who was exceptionally wild and naughty.\n",
      "He hated study and liked to spend all his time in the women’s apartments with the\n",
      "girls, but because Grandmother Jia doted on him so much, no one ever dared to\n",
      "correct him. She realized that it must be this cousin her aunt was now referring to.\n",
      "‘Do you mean the boy born with the jade, Aunt?’ she asked. ‘Mother often told me\n",
      "\f",
      "about him at home. She told me that he was one year older than me and that his\n",
      "name was Bao-yu. But she said that though he was very willful, he always behaved\n",
      "very nicely to girls. Now that I am here, I suppose I shall be spending all my time with\n",
      "my girl cousins and not in the same part of the house as the boys. Surely there will be\n",
      "no danger of my provoking him?’\n",
      "Lady Wang gave a rueful smile. ‘You little know how things are here! Bao-yu is a law\n",
      "unto himself. Because your grandmother is so fond of him she has thoroughly spoiled\n",
      "him. When he was little he lived with the girls, so with the girls he remains now. As\n",
      "long as they take no notice of him, things run quietly enough. But if they give him the\n",
      "least encouragement, he at once becomes excitable, and then there is no end to the\n",
      "mischief he may get up to. That is why I counsel you to ignore him. He can be all\n",
      "honey-sweet words one minute and ranting and raving like a lunatic the next. So\n",
      "don’t believe anything he says.’\n",
      "Dai-yu promised to follow her aunt’s advice.\n",
      "Just then a maid came in with a message that ‘Lady Jia said it was time for dinner’,\n",
      "whereupon Lady Wang took Dai-yu by the hand and hurried her out through a back\n",
      "door. Passing along a verandah which ran beneath the rear eaves of the hall they\n",
      "came to a corner gate through which they passed into an alley-way running north\n",
      "and south. At the south end it was traversed by a narrow little building with a short\n",
      "passage-way running through its middle. At the north end was a white ?painted\n",
      "screen wall masking a medium-sized gateway leading to a small courtyard in which\n",
      "stood a very little house.\n",
      "‘That,’ said Lady Wang, pointing to the little house, ‘is where your Cousin Lian’s\n",
      "wife, Wang Xi-feng, lives, in case you want to see her later on. She is the person to\n",
      "talk to if there is anything you need.’\n",
      "There were a few young pages at the gate of the courtyard who, when they saw Lady\n",
      "Wang coming, all stood to attention with their hands at their sides.\n",
      "Lady Wang now led Dai-yu along a gallery, running from east to west, which brought\n",
      "them out into the courtyard be?hind Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Entering these\n",
      "by a back entrance, they found a number of servants waiting there who, as soon as\n",
      "they saw Lady Wang, began to arrange the table and chairs for dinner. The ladies of\n",
      "the house themselves took part in the service. Li Wan brought in the cups, Xi-feng\n",
      "laid out the chopsticks, and Lady Wang brought in the soup.\n",
      "The table at which Grandmother Jia presided, seated alone on a couch, had two\n",
      "empty chairs on either side. Xi-feng tried to seat Dai-yu in the one on the left nearer\n",
      "to her grand?mother —an honour which she strenuously resisted until her\n",
      "grandmother explained that her aunt and her elder cousins’ wives would not be\n",
      "eating with them, so that, since she was a guest, the place was properly hers. Only\n",
      "\f",
      "then did she ask per?mission to sit, as etiquette prescribed. Grandmother Jia then\n",
      "ordered Lady Wang to be seated. This was the cue for the three girls to ask\n",
      "permission to sit. Ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite Dai-yu,\n",
      "Tan-chun sat second on the left, and Xi-chun sat second on the right.\n",
      "While Li Wan and Xi-feng stood by the table helping to distribute food from the\n",
      "dishes, maids holding fly-whisks, spittoons, and napkins ranged themselves on either\n",
      "side. In addition to these, there were numerous other maids and serving-women in\n",
      "attendance in the outer room, yet not so much as a cough was heard throughout the\n",
      "whole of the meal.\n",
      "When they had finished eating, a maid served each diner with tea on a little tray.\n",
      "Dai-yu’s parents had brought their daughter up to believe that good health was\n",
      "founded on care?ful habits, and in pursuance of this principle, had always in?sisted\n",
      "that after a meal one should allow a certain interval to elapse before taking tea in\n",
      "order to avoid indigestion. How?ever, she could see that many of the rules in this\n",
      "household were different from the ones she had been used to at home; so, being\n",
      "anxious to conform as much as possible, she accepted the tea. But as she did so,\n",
      "another maid preferred a spittoon, from which she inferred that the tea was for\n",
      "rinsing her mouth with. And it was not, in fact, until they had all rinsed out their\n",
      "mouths and washed their hands that another lot of tea was served, this time for\n",
      "drinking.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now dismissed her lady servers, observing that she wished to enjoy\n",
      "a little chat with her young grand children without the restraint of their grown-up\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "Lady Wang obediently rose to her feet and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, went\n",
      "out, taking Li Wan and Wang Xi-feng with her.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia asked Dai-yu what books she was studying.\n",
      "‘The Four Books,’ said Dai-yu, and inquired in turn what books her cousins were\n",
      "currently engaged on.\n",
      "‘Gracious, child, they don’t study books,’ said her grand?mother; ‘they can barely\n",
      "read and write!’\n",
      "While they were speaking, a flurry of footsteps could be heard outside and a maid\n",
      "came in to say that Bao-yu was back.\n",
      "‘I wonder,’ thought Dai-yu, ‘just what sort of graceless creature this Bao-yu is going\n",
      "to be!’\n",
      "The young gentleman who entered in answer to her un?spoken question had a small\n",
      "jewel-encrusted gold coronet on the top of his head and a golden headband low\n",
      "down over his brow in the form of two dragons playing with a large pearl.\n",
      "He was wearing a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of dark red material with a\n",
      "\f",
      "pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold. It was confined at the waist\n",
      "with a court girdle of coloured silks braided at regular intervals into elaborate clusters\n",
      "of knotwork and terminating in long tassels.\n",
      "Over the upper part of his robe he wore a jacket of slate-blue Japanese silk damask\n",
      "with a raised pattern of eight large medallions on the front and with tasselled\n",
      "borders.\n",
      "On his feet he had half-length dress boots of black satin with thick white soles.\n",
      "As to his person, he had:\n",
      "a face like the moon of Mid-Autumn,\n",
      "a complexion like flowers at dawn,\n",
      "a hairline straight as a knife-cut,\n",
      "eyebrows that might have been painted by an artist’s brush,\n",
      "a shapely nose, and\n",
      "eyes clear as limpid pools,\n",
      "that even in anger seemed to smile,\n",
      "and, as they glared, beamed tenderness the while.\n",
      "Around his neck he wore a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon and a woven\n",
      "cord of coloured silks to which the famous jade was attached.\n",
      "Dai-yu looked at him with astonishment. How strange! How very strange! It was as\n",
      "though she had seen him somewhere before, he was so extraordinarily familiar.\n",
      "Bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother, who told him to come\n",
      "after he had seen his mother, whereupon he turned round and walked straight out\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Quite soon he was back once more, this time dressed in a completely different outfit.\n",
      "The crown and circlet had gone. She could now see that his side hair was dressed in a\n",
      "number of small braids plaited with red silk, which were drawn round to join the long\n",
      "hair at the back in a single large queue of glistening jet black, fastened at intervals\n",
      "from the nape downwards with four enormous pearls and ending in a jewelled gold\n",
      "clasp. He had changed his robe and jacket for a rather more worn-looking\n",
      "rose-coloured gown, sprigged with flowers. He wore the gold torque and his jade as\n",
      "before, and she observed that the collection of objects round his neck had been\n",
      "further augmented by a padlock-shaped amulet and a lucky charm. A pair of\n",
      "ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown, thrust\n",
      "into black and white socks trimmed with brocade. In place of the formal boots he\n",
      "was wearing thick-soled crimson slippers.\n",
      "She was even more struck than before by his fresh com?plexion. The cheeks might\n",
      "have been brushed with powder and the lips touched with rouge, so bright was their\n",
      "natural colour.\n",
      "\f",
      "His glance was soulful,\n",
      "yet from his lips the laughter often leaped;\n",
      "a world of charm upon that brow was heaped;\n",
      "a world of feeling from those dark eyes peeped.\n",
      "In short, his outward appearance was very fine. But appear?ances can be misleading.\n",
      "A perceptive poet has supplied two sets of verses, to be sung to the tune of Moon On\n",
      "West River, which contain a more accurate appraisal of our hero than the foregoing\n",

      "        He proved to have but sorry meat within.\n",
      "        A harum-scarum, to all duty blind,\n",
      "        A doltish mule, to study disinclined;\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Fancy changing your clothes before you have welcomed the visitor!’ Grandmother\n",
      "Jia chided indulgently on seeing Bao-yu back again. ‘Aren’t you going to pay your\n",
      "respects to your cousin?’\n",
      "Bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender, delicate girl whom he surmised to be\n",
      "his Aunt Lin’s daughter and quickly went over to greet her. Then, returning to his\n",
      "place and taking a seat, he studied her attentively. How different she seemed from\n",
      "the other girls he knew!\n",
      "Her mist-wreathed brows at first seemed to frown, yet were not frowning;\n",
      "Her passionate eyes at first seemed to smile, yet were not merry.\n",
      "\f",
      "Habit had given a melancholy cast to her tender face;\n",
      "Nature had bestowed a sickly constitution on her delicate frame.\n",
      "Often the eyes swam with glistening tears;\n",
      "Often the breath came in gentle gasps.\n",
      "In stillness she made one think of a graceful flower reflected in the water;\n",
      "In motion she called to mind tender willow shoots caressed by the wind.\n",
      "She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan;\n",
      "And suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi.\n",
      "Having completed his survey, Bao-yu gaved a laugh.\n",
      "‘I have seen this cousin before.’\n",
      "‘Nonsense!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How could you possibly have done?’\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but her face seems so familiar that I have the\n",
      "impression of meeting her again after a long separation.’\n",
      "‘All the better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That means that you should get on well\n",
      "together.’\n",
      "Bao-yu moved over again and, drawing a chair up beside Dai-yu, recommenced his\n",
      "scrutiny.\n",
      "Presently: ‘Do you study books yet, cousin?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have only been taking lessons for a year or so. I can barely read\n",
      "and write.’\n",
      "‘What’s your name?’\n",
      "Dai-yu told him.\n",
      "‘What’s your school-name?’\n",
      "‘I haven’t got one.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed. ‘I’ll give you one, cousin. I think “Frowner” would suit you perfectly.’\n",
      "‘Where’s your reference?’ said Tan-chun.\n",
      "‘In the Encyclopedia of Men and Objects Ancient and Modern it says that\n",
      "somewhere in the West there is a mineral called “dai” which can be used instead of\n",
      "eye-black for painting the eye?brows with. She has this “dai” in her name and she\n",
      "knits her brows together in a little frown. I think it’s a splendid name for her!’\n",
      "‘I expect you made it up,’ said Tan-chun scornfully.\n",
      "‘What if I did?’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are lots of made-up things in books—apart from\n",
      "the Four Books, of course.’\n",
      "He returned to his interrogation of Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Have you got a jade?’\n",
      "The test of the company were puzzled, hut Dai-yu at once divined that he was asking\n",
      "her if she too had a jade like the one he was born with.\n",
      "‘No,’ said Dal-yu. ‘That jade of yours is a very rare object. You can’t expect\n",
      "\f",
      "everybody to have one.’\n",
      "This sent Bao-yu off instantly into one of his mad fits. Snatching the jade from his\n",
      "neck he hurled it violently on the floor as if to smash it and began abusing it\n",
      "passionately.\n",
      "‘Rare object! Rare object! What’s so lucky about a stone that can’t even tell which\n",
      "people are better than others? Beastly thing! I don’t want it!’\n",
      "The maids all seemed terrified and rushed forward to pick it up, while Grandmother\n",
      "Jia clung to Bao-yu in alarm.\n",
      "‘Naughty, naughty boy! Shout at someone or strike them if you like when you are in\n",
      "a nasty temper, but why go smashing that precious thing that your very life depends\n",
      "on?’\n",
      "‘None of the girls has got one,’ said Bao-yu, his face stream?ing with tears and\n",
      "sobbing hysterically. ‘Only I have got one. It always upsets me. And now this new\n",
      "cousin comes here who is as beautiful as an angel and she hasn’t got one either; so I\n",
      "know it can’t be any good.’\n",
      "‘Your cousin did have a jade once,’ said Grandmother Jia, coaxing him like a little\n",
      "child, ‘but because when Auntie died she couldn’t bear to leave her little girl behind,\n",
      "they had to let her take the jade with her instead. In that way your cousin could show\n",
      "her mamma how much she loved her by letting the jade be buried with her; and at\n",
      "the same time, whenever Auntie’s spirit looked at the jade, it would be just like\n",
      "looking at her own little girl again.\n",
      "‘So when your cousin said she hadn’t got one, it was only because she didn’t want\n",
      "to boast about the good, kind thing she did when she gave it to her mamma. Now\n",
      "you put yours on again like a good boy, and mind your mother doesn’t find out how\n",
      "naughty you have been.’\n",
      "So saying, she took the jade from the hands of one of the maids and hung it round\n",
      "his neck for him. And Bao-yu, after reflecting for a moment or two on what she had\n",
      "said, offered no further resistance.\n",
      "At this point some of the older women came to inquire what room Dai-yu was to\n",
      "sleep in.\n",
      "‘Move Bao-yu into the closet-bed with me,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘and put Miss\n",
      "Lin for the time being in the green muslin summer-bed. We had better wait until\n",
      "spring when the last of the cold weather is over before seeing about the rooms for\n",
      "them and getting them settled permanently.’\n",
      "‘Dearest Grannie,’ said Bao-yu pleadingly, ‘I should be perfectly all right next to the\n",
      "summer-bed. There’s no need to move me into your room. I should only keep you\n",
      "awake.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, after a moment’s reflection, gave her consent. She further gave\n",
      "\f",
      "instructions that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were each to have one nurse and one maid to\n",
      "sleep with them. The rest of their servants were to do night duty by rota in the\n",
      "adjoining room. Xi-feng had already sent across some lilac-coloured hangings,\n",
      "brocade quilts, satin coverlets and the like for Dai-yu’s bedding.\n",
      "Dai-yu had brought only two of her own people with her from home. One was her\n",
      "old wet-nurse Nannie Wang, the other was a little ten-year-old maid called\n",
      "Snowgoose. Con?sidering Snowgoose too young and irresponsible and Nannie Wang\n",
      "too old and decrepit to be of much real service, Grand?mother Jia gave Dai-yu one of\n",
      "her own maids, a body-servant of the second grade called Nightingale. She also gave\n",
      "orders that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were to be attended in other respects exactly like the\n",
      "three girls: that is to say, apart from the one wet-nurse, each was to have four other\n",
      "nurses to act as chaper?ones, two maids as body-servants to attend to their washing,\n",
      "dressing, and so forth, and four or five maids for dusting and cleaning, running\n",
      "errands and general duties.\n",
      "These arrangements completed, Nannie Wang and Night?ingale accompanied Dai-yu\n",
      "to bed inside the tent-like summer?-bed, while Bao-yu’s wet-nurse Nannie Li and his\n",
      "chief maid Aroma settled him down for the night in a big bed on the other side of the\n",
      "canopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Nightingale, Aroma had previously been one of Grand?mother Jia’s own maids.\n",
      "Her real name was Pearl. Bao-yu’s grandmother, fearful that the maids who already\n",
      "waited on her darling boy could not be trusted to look after him properly, had picked\n",
      "out Pearl as a girl of tried and conspicuous fidelity and put her in charge over them. It\n",
      "was Bao-yu who was responsible for the curious name ‘Aroma’. Discovering that\n",
      "Pearl’s surname was Hua, which means ‘Flowers’, and having recently come across\n",
      "the line\n",
      "\n",
      "The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days\n",
      "\n",
      "in a book of poems, he told his grandmother that he wanted to call his new maid\n",
      "‘Aroma’, so ‘Aroma’ her name thence?forth became.\n",
      "Aroma had a certain dogged streak in her nature which had made her utterly devoted\n",
      "to Grandmother Jia as long as she was Grandmother Jia’s servant, but which caused\n",
      "her to become just as exclusively and single-mindedly devoted to Bao-yu when her\n",
      "services were transferred to him. Since she found his character strange and\n",
      "incomprehensible, her simple devotion frequently impelled her to remonstrate with\n",
      "him, and when, as invariably happened, he took not the least notice of what she said,\n",
      "she was worried and hurt.\n",
      "\f",
      "That night, when Bao-yu and Nannie Li were already asleep, Aroma could hear that\n",
      "Dai-yu and Nightingale on their side of the canopy had still not settled down, so,\n",
      "when she had finished taking down her hair and making herself ready for bed, she\n",
      "tiptoed through the muslin curtains and in a friendly way inquired what was the\n",
      "matter. Dai-yu invited her to sit down, and when she had seated herself on the edge\n",
      "of the bed, Nightingale proceeded to tell her what was troubling her new mistress.\n",
      "‘Miss Lin is all upset. She has just been crying her eyes out because she says she\n",
      "only just arrived here today, and yet already she has started young hopeful off on one\n",
      "of his turns. She says if that jade had been really smashed, it would have been all her\n",
      "fault. That’s what she’s so upset about. I’ve had no end of a job trying to comfort her.’\n",
      "‘You mustn’t take on so, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘You’ll see him do much stranger things\n",

      "The couplet inscribed vertically on either side of the doorway was as follows:\n",

      "        Spring grieves and autumn sorrows were by yourselves provoked.\n",
      "        Flower faces, moonlike beauty were to what end disclosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bao-yu grasped enough of the meaning to be affected by its melancholy.\n",
      "\f",
      "Passing inside, he saw a dozen or more large cupboards with paper strips pasted on\n",
      "their doors on which were written the names of different provinces. He was careful\n",
      "to look out for the one belonging to his own area and presently found one on which\n",
      "the paper strip said ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Main Register’. Bao-yu asked\n",
      "Disenchantment what this meant, and she explained that it was a register of the\n",
      "twelve most out-standing girls of his home province.\n",
      "‘People all say what a big place Jinling is,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Surely there should be more\n",
      "than just twelve names? Why, even in my own home, if you count the servants, there\n",
      "must be altogether several hundred girls.’\n",
      "‘Certainly there area great many girls in the whole province,’ said Disenchantment\n",
      "with a smile, ‘but only the most im?portant ones have been selected for recording in\n",

      "selections from the same area. But of the host of ordinary girls outside those three\n",
      "dozen we keep no records.’\n",
      "Bao-yu glanced at the other two cupboards referred to by Disenchantment. One was\n",
      "labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.1’; the other was\n",
      "labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.2’. Stretching out his\n",
      "hand he opened the door of the second one, took out Supplementary Register No.2,\n",
      "which was like a large album, and opened it at the first page.\n",
      "It was a picture, but not of a person or a view.⒈The whole page was covered with\n",

      "\n",
      "                 Seldom the moon shines in a cloudless sky,\n",

      "        Your gentle lord’s solicitude in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bao-yu could not make much sense of this, and turned to the next page. It was\n",

      "aside, opened the door of the cupboard marked ‘Supplementary Register No. I’ and\n",
      "took out the album from that.\n",
      "As in the previous album, the first page was a picture. It represented a branch of\n",
      "cassia with a pool underneath. The water in the pool had dried up and the mud in\n",
      "the bottom was dry and cracked. Growing from it was a withered and broken lotus\n",
      "plant. The picture was followed by these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "        Your stem grew from a noble lotus root,\n",

      "\n",
      "Once more failing to make any sense of what he saw, Bao-yu picked up the Main\n",
      "Register to look at. In this album the picture on the first page represented two dead\n",
      "trees with a jade belt hanging in their branches and on the ground beneath them a\n",
      "pile of snow in which a golden hairpin lay half-buried. This was followed by a\n",
      "quatrain:\n",

      "Still Bao-yu was unable to understand the meaning. He would have liked to ask, but\n",
      "he knew that Disenchantment would be unwilling to divulge the secrets of her\n",
      "immortal world. Yet though he could make no sense of the book, for some reason he\n",
      "found himself unable this time to lay it down, and continued to look through it to the\n",
      "end.\n",
      "The picture that followed was of a bow with a citron hanging from it, followed by\n",
      "what looked like the words of a song:\n",

      "    In spring through tears at river’s bank you gaze,\n",

      "\n",
      "    The plum-tree bore her fruit after the rest,\n",

      "names that were equally bizarre.\n",
      "Presently the little maids came in again and proceeded to arrange some chairs\n",
      "around a table and to lay it with food and wine for a feast. In the words of the poet,\n",
      "Celestial nectar filled the crystal cup,\n",
      "And liquid gold in amber goblets glowed.\n",
      "The wine’s bouquet was delectable, and once again Bao-yu could not resist asking\n",
      "about it.\n",

      "there don’t know me; it would be a journey wasted.’\n",
      "     ‘That’s no problem,’ said Gou-er. ‘I’ll tell you what to do. You take young Ban-er\n",
      "with you and ask for Old Zhou that stayed in service with your lady after she married.\n",
      "If you tell them you’ve come to see him, it will give you an excuse for the visit Old\n",

      "house—an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough, as would any little boy\n",
      "of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city. That done, she set\n",
      "off on her journey, and in due course made her way to Two Dukes Street. There, at\n",
      "each side of the stone lions which flanked the gates of the Rong Mansion, she saw a\n",
      "cluster of horses and palanquins. Not daring to go straight up, she first dusted down\n",

      "one of the side entrances.\n",
      "A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gate?way sunning their bellies\n",
      "and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics. Grannie Liu\n",
      "waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation. After looking her up and\n",
      "down for a moment or two, they asked her her business. Grannie Liu smiled\n",
      "ingratiatingly.\n",
      "     ‘I’ve come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before\n",
      "\f",
      "she married. Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?’\n",
      "The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion. After she had\n",
      "waited there for some considerable time one of them said, ‘If you stand at that gate\n",
      "along there on the corner, someone from inside the house should be coming out\n",
      "presently.’\n",
      "But a more elderly man among them protested that it was ‘a shame to send her on a\n",
      "fool’s errand’, and turning to Grannie Liu he said, ‘Old Zhou is away in the South at\n",
      "the moment, but his missus is still at home. She lives round at the back. You’ll have to\n",
      "go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.’\n",
      "     Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted off with little Ban-er all the way round to\n",
      "the rear entrance. There she found a number of sweetmeat vendors and toy-sellers\n",
      "who had set their wares down outside the gate and were being besieged by a crowd\n",
      "of some twenty or thirty noisy, yelling children. She grabbed a small urchin from their\n",
      "midst and drew him towards her.\n",
      "     ‘Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?’\n",
      "     The urchin stared back at her impudently.\n",
      "     ‘Which Mrs Zhou? There are several Mrs Zhous here. What’s her job?’\n",
      "‘She’s the Mrs Zhou that came here with Her Ladyship when she was married.’\n",
      "‘That’s easy,’ said the urchin. ‘Follow me!’\n",
      "He led Grannie Lin into a rear courtyard. ‘That’s where she lives,’ he said, pointing\n",
      "in the direction of a side wall. Then, bawling over the wall, ‘Mrs Zhou, there’s an\n",
      "old woman come to see you！’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife came hurrying out and asked who it was.\n",
      "‘How are you, my dear?’ said Grannie Liu, advancing with a smile. Zhou Rui’s wife\n",
      "scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her.\n",
      "‘Why, it’s Grannie Liu! How are you? It’s so many years since I saw you last, I’d\n",
      "forgotten all about you! Come in and sit down!’\n",
      "Grannie Liu followed her cackling.\n",
      "‘You know what they say: “Important people have short memories.” I wouldn’t\n",
      "expect you to remember the likes of us!’\n",
      "When they were indoors, Zhou Rui’s wife ordered her little hired help to pour out\n",
      "some tea.\n",
      "‘And hasn’t Ban-er grown a big boy!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife; then, after a few\n",
      "inquiries about the various things that had happened since they last met, she asked\n",
      "Grannie Liu about her visit.\n",
      "‘Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?’\n",
      "‘Well, of course, first and foremost we came to see you, replied Grannie Liu\n",
      "mendaciously, ‘but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship. If you\n",
      "\f",
      "could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that’s not possible, perhaps\n",
      "we could trouble you just to give her our regards.’\n",
      "From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui’s wife was already able to make a pretty good\n",
      "guess as to the real purpose of the old woman’s visit; but because some years\n",
      "previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er’s father in a dispute\n",
      "over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Iiu now, when\n",
      "she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own\n",
      "importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one.\n",
      "‘Don’t you worry, Grannie! After you’ve made such a long pilgrimage, we won’t let\n",
      "you go home without seeing a real Buddha! By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors\n",
      "has nothing to do with me. You see, we each have our own jobs here. My man’s is\n",
      "collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn; and when he’s not doing\n",
      "that, he takes the young masters out when they go on visits. That’s all he ever does.\n",
      "Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go\n",
      "out. But being as how you are a relation of Her ladyship, and since you’ve put your\n",
      "confidence in me and turned to me to help you, I don’t mind breaking the rules for\n",
      "once and taking in a message.\n",
      "‘There’s only one thing, though. I don’t expect you know, but things here are very\n",
      "different from what they were five years ago. Nowadays Her Ladyship doesn’t run\n",
      "things here any longer. It’s Master Lian’s wife who does all the managing—You’ll\n",
      "never guess who that is: Her Ladyship’s niece Wang Xi-feng. You know, Her Ladyship’s\n",
      "eldest brothers daughter, that we used to call “Feng-ge” when she was a child’\n",
      "‘Bless you, my dear, for being such a help!’ said Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Oh Grannie, how can you say such a thing?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife demurely. ‘You\n",
      "know what the old saying is, “He who helps others helps himself.” It’s only a question\n",
      "of saying a few words. No trouble at all.’\n",
      "So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady\n",
      "Jia’s quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet. The little maid departed on her\n",
      "errand and the two women resumed their conversation.\n",
      "‘This Mrs Lian,’ said Grannie Liu: ‘she can’t be more than eighteen or nineteen\n",
      "years old. She must be a very capable young woman. Fancy her being able to run a\n",
      "great household like this!’\n",
      "‘Oh Grannie, you have no idea!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Mrs Lian may be young, but\n",
      "when it comes to doing things, she’s got an older head on her shoulders than any I’ve\n",
      "ever come across. She’s grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian. But sharp!\n",
      "Well, if it ever comes to a slanging match, she can talk down ten grown men any day\n",
      "of the week! Wait till you meet her, and you’ll see what I mean. There’s only one\n",
      "thing, though. She’s a bit too strict with those beneath her.’\n",
      "\f",
      "As she was speaking, the little maid came back, her errand completed.\n",
      "‘They’ve finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship’s. Mrs Lian is still there.’\n",
      "Thou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise.\n",
      "‘Quick! After she comes out from there she’ll be free for a few minutes while she\n",
      "has her meal. We must try and catch her then. If we delay a moment longer, people\n",
      "will start coming in with messages and we shan’t have a chance to speak to her. And\n",
      "once she goes off for her afternoon nap, we’ve really lost her!’\n",
      "Grannie Liu got off the kang, adjusted her clothing, con?ducted Ban-er through a\n",
      "rapid revision of his little stock of phrases and followed Thou Rui’s wife through\n",
      "various twists and turns to Jia Lian’s quarters. Just before they reached them, Zhou\n",
      "Rui’s wife planted them both in a covered passage-way while she went on ahead\n",
      "round the screen wall and into the gate of the courtyard. First ascertaining that Wang\n",
      "Xi-feng had not yet left Lady Jia’s, she sought out Xi-feng’s chambermaid and\n",
      "principal confidante, Patience, and primed her with a full account of Grannie Liu’s\n",
      "antecedents.\n",
      "‘She has come all this way today to pay her respects,’ she concluded. ‘At one time\n",
      "Her Ladyship used to see quite a lot of her, which is why I thought it would be in\n",
      "order for me to bring her in. I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come\n",
      "back and explain it all to her. I hope she won’t be angry with me for pushing myself\n",
      "forward.’\n",
      "Patience at once made up her mind what to do.\n",
      "‘Let them come in here. They can sit here while they are waiting.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife went off again to fetch her charges. As they ascended the steps to the\n",
      "main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portère\n",
      "for them to enter. A strange, delicious fragrance seemed to reach forward and enfold\n",
      "them as they entered, producing in Grannie Liu the momentary sensation that she\n",
      "had been transported bodily to one of the celestial paradises. Their eyes, too, were\n",
      "dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room. Temporarily\n",
      "speechless with wonder, Grannie Liu stood wagging her head, alternating clicks of\n",
      "admiration with pious ejaculations.\n",
      "From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in\n",
      "which Jia Lian’s baby daughter slept. Patience, who was standing by the edge of the\n",
      "kang, made a rapid assessment of Grannie Liu and judged it sufficient to greet her\n",
      "with a civil ‘how-do-you-do’ and an invitation to be seated.\n",
      "Grannie Liu looked at the silks and satins in which Patience was dressed, the gold and\n",
      "silver ornaments in her hair, her beauty of feature which in every respect\n",
      "corresponded with what she had been told of Wang Xi-feng, and taking the maid for\n",
      "the mistress, was on the point of greeting her as ‘Gou-er’s aunt, when Zhou Rui’s wife\n",
      "\f",
      "introduced her as ‘Miss Patience. Then, when Patience shortly afterwards addressed\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife as ‘Mrs Zhou’, she knew that this was no mistress but a very\n",
      "high-class maid. So Grannie Liu and Ban-er got up on the kang at one side, while\n",
      "Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife sat near the edge of it on the other, and a little maid\n",
      "came in and poured them all some tea.\n",
      "Grannie Liu’s attention was distracted by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike\n",
      "the sound made by a flour-bolting machine, and she could not forbear glancing\n",
      "round her from time to time to see where it came from. Presently she caught sight of\n",
      "a sort of boxlike object fastened to one of the central pillars of the room, and a thing\n",
      "like the weight of a steelyard hanging down from it, which swung to and fro in\n",
      "ceaseless motion and appeared to be the source of the noise which had distracted\n",
      "her.\n",
      "‘I wonder what that can be,’ she thought to herself, ‘and what it can be used for?’\n",
      "As she studied the strange box, it suddenly gave forth a loud dong! like the sound of\n",
      "a bronze bell or a copper chime, which so startled the old lady that her eyes nearly\n",
      "popped out of her head. The dong! was followed in rapid succession by eight or nine\n",
      "others, and Grannie Liu was on the point of asking what it meant, when all the maids\n",
      "in the house began scurrying about shouting, ‘The mistress! The mistress! She’ll be\n",
      "coming out now!’ and Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to their feet.\n",
      "‘Just stay here, Grannie,’ they said. ‘When it is time for you to see her, we shall\n",
      "come in and fetch you’; and they went off with the other servants to greet their\n",
      "mistress.\n",
      "As Grannie Liu sat in silence, waiting with bated breath and head cocked to one side\n",
      "for her summons, she heard a far-off sound of laughter, followed presently by a\n",
      "sound of rustling dresses as between ten and twenty women entered the reception\n",
      "room and passed from it into the room beyond. Then two or three women bearing\n",
      "large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which\n",
      "she sat and stood there waiting to be called. A voice in the far room called out, ‘Serve\n",
      "now, please!’ at which, to judge from the noises, most of the women scuttled off,\n",
      "leaving only the few who were waiting at table. A long silence ensued in which not so\n",
      "much as a cheep could be heard; then two women came in bearing a small, low table\n",
      "which they set down on the kang. It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all\n",
      "kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched. At\n",
      "the sight of it Ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and was silenced by Grannie Liu\n",
      "with a resounding slap.\n",
      "Just at that moment Zhou Rui’s wife appeared, her face all wreathed in smiles, and\n",
      "advanced towards Grannie Liu beckoning. Grannie Liu slipped off the kang, lifted\n",
      "down Ban-er, and exchanged a few hurried whispers with her in the reception room\n",
      "\f",
      "before waddling into the room beyond.\n",
      "A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway. Inside, under\n",
      "the window in the south wall, there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet. At\n",
      "the east end of the kang, up against the wooden partition wall, were a back?rest and\n",
      "bolster, both covered in gold brocade, and a large flat cushion for sitting on, also\n",
      "glittering with gold thread. Beside them stood a silver spittoon.\n",
      "Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable, which she wore about the house for\n",
      "warmth, fastened on with a pearl ?studded bandeau. She was dressed in a sprigged\n",
      "peach-pink gown, with an ermine-lined skirt of dark-red foreign crepe underneath it,\n",
      "and a cloak of slate-blue silk with woven coloured insets and lining of grey squirrel\n",
      "around her shoul?ders. Her face was exquisitely made-up. She was sitting on the\n",
      "edge of the kang, her back straight as a ramrod, with a dimin?utive pair of tongs in\n",
      "her hand, removing the spent charcoal from a portable hand-warmer. Patience stood\n",
      "beside her carrying a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray. Xi-feng appeared\n",
      "not to have noticed her, for she neither reached out for the cup nor raised her head,\n",
      "but continued picking ab?sorbedly at her hand-warmer. At last she spoke:\n",
      "‘Why not ask them in, then?’\n",
      "As she did so, she raised her head and saw Zhou Rui’s wife with her two charges\n",
      "already standing in front of her. She made a confused movement as if to rise to her\n",
      "feet, welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence, and almost in\n",
      "the same breath said rather crossly to Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’\n",
      "By this time Grannie Liu was already down on her knees and had touched her head\n",
      "several times to the floor in reverence to her ‘Aunt Feng’.\n",
      "‘Stop her, Zhou dear!’ said Xi-feng in alarm. ‘She mustn’t do that, I am much too\n",
      "young! In any case, I don’t know her very well. I don’t know what sort of relations we\n",
      "are and what I should call her.’\n",
      "‘This is the Grannie Liu I was just telling you about,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.\n",
      "Xi-feng nodded, and Grannie Liu sat herself down on the edge of the kang Ban-er at\n",
      "once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would\n",
      "induce him to come out and make a bow to his ‘Auntie’.\n",
      "‘Relations don’t come to see us much nowadays,’ said Xi-feng affably. ‘We’re\n",
      "getting to be quite strangers with everybody. People who know us realize that it is\n",
      "because you are tired of us that you don’t visit us oftener; but some spiteful people\n",
      "who don’t know us so well think it’s our fault, because we have grown too proud.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Grannie Liu invoked the Lord Buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view.\n",
      "‘It’s hard times that keeps us away. We can’t afford to visit. We are afraid that if we\n",
      "came to see you looking the way we are, you would disown us; and even the people\n",
      "\f",
      "at the gate might think we were tramps!’\n",
      "‘Now you are really being too hard on us! What if Grand?father did make a little bit\n",
      "of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment? What does\n",
      "it all amount to? It’s all empty show, really. You know what they say: “Even the\n",
      "Emperor has poor relations.” It would be strange indeed if we didn’t have a few!’\n",
      "She turned to Thou Rui’s wife.\n",
      "‘Have you told Her Ladyship yet?’\n",
      "‘No, ma’am. I was waiting for your instructions.’\n",
      "‘Go and have a look, then. If she has anyone with her, you had better leave it; but if\n",
      "she is free, tell her about their visit and see what she says.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife departed on her errand.\n",
      "Xi-feng told one of the servants to give Ban-er a handful of sweets, and had just\n",
      "begun a desultory conversation with Grannie Liu when a number of domestics and\n",
      "underlings of either sex arrived to report on their duties.\n",
      "‘I am entertaining a guest,’ said Xi-feng to Patience when she came in to announce\n",
      "their arrival. ‘Let them leave it until this evening. But if anyone has important\n",
      "business, bring them in and I will deal with it now.’\n",
      "Patience went out and returned a minute later to say that she had asked them and\n",
      "no one had any business of special importance, so she had sent them all away.\n",
      "Xi-feng nodded.\n",
      "At this point Zhou Rui’s wife returned with a message for Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Her Ladyship says she isn’t free today, but that if you will entertain them for her, it\n",
      "will be just the same as if she were to receive them herself. She says please thank\n",
      "them very much for coming. And she says if it’s just an ordinary visit she has nothing\n",
      "more to add; but if they have anything particular to say, she says tell them that they\n",
      "can say it to you instead.’\n",
      "‘I hadn’t anything particular in mind,’ said Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Only to look in on Her Ladyship and your mistress. Just a visit to relations.’\n",
      "‘Well all right then, if you are sure you have nothing to say. But if you have got\n",
      "anything to say, you really ought to tell the mistress. It will be just the same as if you\n",
      "were to say it to Her Ladyship.’ Zhou Rui’s wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie\n",
      "Liu as she said this.\n",
      "Grannie Liu perfectly well understood the significance of this look, and a blush of\n",
      "shame overspread her face. Yet if she did not speak up now, what would have been\n",
      "the purpose of her visit? She forced herself to say something.\n",
      "‘By rights I ought not to mention it today, seeing that this is our first meeting: but\n",
      "as I have come such a long way to see you, it seems silly not to speak…’\n",
      "She had got no further when the pages from the outer gate announced the arrival of\n",
      "\f",
      "‘the young master from the Ning mansion’ and Xi-feng gestured to her to stop.\n",
      "‘It’s all right. There is no need to tell me.’ She turned to the pages. ‘Where is Master\n",
      "Rong, then ?’\n",
      "A man’s footstep sounded outside and a fresh-faced, willowy youth of seventeen or\n",
      "eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress came into the room.\n",
      "Grannie Liu, acutely embarrassed in this male presence, did not know whether to sit\n",
      "or stand, and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself. Xi-feng laughed\n",
      "at her discomfiture.\n",
      "‘Don’t mind him; just stay where you are! It’s only ray nephew.’\n",
      "With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again, perching herself\n",
      "obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang.\n",
      "Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion.\n",
      "‘My father is entertaining an important visitor tomorrow and he wondered if he\n",
      "might borrow the little glass screen that your Uncle Wang’s wife gave you, to put on\n",
      "our kang while he is there. We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.’\n",
      "‘You are too late,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I lent it yesterday to someone else.\n",
      "Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang.\n",
      "‘If you won’t lend it, my father will say that I didn’t ask properly and I shall get a\n",
      "beating. Come on, Auntie, be a sport! Just for my sake!’\n",
      "Xi-feng smiled maliciously.\n",
      "‘I don’t know what’s so special about my family’s things. Heaven knows, you have\n",
      "enough stuff of your own over there; yet you have only to set eyes on anything of\n",
      "ours, and you want it for yourselves.’\n",
      "Jia Rong’s smile flashed again.\n",
      "‘Please, Auntie! Be merciful!’\n",
      "‘If it’s the tiniest bit chipped,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll have the hide off you!’\n",
      "She ordered Patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable\n",
      "servants to carry it over. Delighted with his good luck, Jia Rong hurriedly forestalled\n",
      "her.\n",
      "‘I’ll get some of my own people to carry it. Don’t put yours to a lot of trouble!’ and\n",
      "he hurried out.\n",
      "Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the\n",
      "window, ‘Rong, come back! ‘\n",
      "Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, ‘Master Rong, you’re wanted\n",
      "back again!’\n",
      "Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with\n",
      "eyebrows arched inquiringly.\n",
      "Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying\n",
      "\f",
      "nothing. Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh:\n",
      "‘It doesn’t matter. Come back again after supper. I’ve got company now, and\n",
      "besides, I don’t feel in the mood to tell you.’\n",
      "‘Yes, Aunt,’ said Jia Rong, and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he\n",
      "sauntered slowly out of the room.\n",
      "Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again:\n",
      "‘The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and\n",
      "Ma haven’t anything in the house to eat, and the weather is getting colder,\n",
      "and—and—I thought I’d bring him here to see you ...’ She gave Ban-er a despairing\n",
      "push. ‘What did your Pa tell you to say when we got here? What was it he sent us for?\n",
      "Look at you! All you can do is sit there eating sweets!’\n",
      "It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on,\n",
      "and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile.\n",
      "‘It’s quite all right. There is no need to tell me. I quite understand.’ She turned to\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today ?’\n",
      "‘We were on our way first thing this morning,’ Grannie Liu chimed in. ‘There was no\n",
      "time to think about eating.’\n",
      "Xi-feng gave orders for a meal to be brought in, and Zhou Rui’s wife went out and\n",
      "presently reappeared with a guest’s portion of various choice dishes on a little table,\n",
      "which she set down in the east wing, and to which she then conducted Grannie Liu\n",
      "and Ban-er for their meal.\n",
      "‘Zhou, dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘will you keep them company and see that they have\n",
      "enough to eat? I shan’t be able to sit with them myself.’ Then calling her aside for a\n",
      "moment she asked, ‘What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them\n",
      "just now?’\n",
      "‘She said they don’t really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan\n",
      "years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office. She\n",
      "said they haven’t been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used\n",
      "to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed. She said it was nice of them to\n",
      "come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately. And\n",
      "she said if they appear to want anything, she would leave it to you to decide what we\n",
      "should do for them.’\n",
      "‘No wonder!’ exclaimed Xi-feng when she had heard this account. ‘I couldn’t\n",
      "understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them.’\n",
      "While they were talking, Grannie Liu came back from the other room having already\n",
      "finished eating, smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively, and voicing\n",
      "her thanks for the repast.\n",
      "‘Sit down,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I have something to say to you. I quite\n",
      "\f",
      "understand what you were trying to tell me just now. As we are relations, we ought\n",
      "by rights not to wait for you to come to our door before helping you when you are in\n",
      "trouble; but there are so many things to attend to in this family, and now that Her\n",
      "Ladyship is getting on a bit she doesn’t always remember them all. And since I took\n",
      "over the management of the household, I find there are quite a lot of relations that I\n",
      "don’t even know about. And then again, of course, though we may look thriving\n",
      "enough from the out?side, people don’t realize that being a big establishment like\n",
      "ours carries its own difficulties. They won’t believe it if you tell them, but it’s true.\n",
      "However, since you have come such a long way, and since this is the first time you\n",
      "have ever said a word about needing help, we obviously can’t let you go back\n",
      "empty-handed. Fortunately it so happens that I still haven’t touched any of the\n",
      "twenty taels of silver that Her Ladyship gave me the other day to make clothes for\n",
      "the maids with. If you don’t mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.’\n",
      "When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about ‘difficulties’ she concluded that there was\n",
      "no hope. Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she\n",
      "heard that she was, after all, to be given twenty taels of sliver can be imagined.\n",
      "‘We knew you had your troubles,’ she said, ‘but as the saying goes, “A starved\n",
      "camel is bigger than a fat horse.” Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is\n",
      "thicker than a man’s waist to folks like us!’\n",
      "Horrified by the crudity of these expressions, Zhou Rui’s wife, who was standing by,\n",
      "was meanwhile signaling fran?tically to the old lady to stop. But Xi-feng laughed\n",
      "quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string\n",
      "of cash to go with it. The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Here is the twenty taels of silver,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Take this for the time being to make\n",
      "some winter clothes for the children with. Some time later on, when you have\n",
      "nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship’s sake. It’s late now, so\n",
      "I won’t try to keep you. Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered\n",
      "when you get back!’\n",
      "She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt ex?pressions of gratitude, picked\n",
      "up the money and followed Zhou Rui’s wife out of the room.\n",
      "‘My dear good woman,’ said the latter when they were out of earshot, ‘whatever\n",
      "came over you? First, when you met her, you couldn’t get a word out; then, when\n",
      "you did start talking, it was all “your nephew” this and “your nephew” that! I hope\n",
      "you won’t mind my saying so, but even if the child was a real nephew you would still\n",
      "need to go a bit easy on the familiarities. Now Master Rong, he is her real nephew.\n",
      "That’s the sort of person a lady like that calls “nephew”. Where she would come by a\n",
      "nephew like this one, I just do not know!’\n",
      "‘My dear,’ replied Grannie Liu with a laugh, ‘when I saw the pretty little darling\n",
      "\f",
      "sitting there, I took such a liking to her that my heart was too full to speak.’\n",
      "Back in Zhou Rui’s quarters the two women sat talking for a while. Grannie Liu\n",
      "wanted to leave a piece of silver to buy something for the Zhou children with, but\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife said she wouldn’t hear of it and refused absolutely to accept anything.\n",
      "And so, with many expressions of gratitude, the old lady took her leave and set out\n",
      "once more through the back gate of the mansion.\n",
      "And if you want to know what happened after she had left, you will have to read the\n",

      "top of her head, sat with her maid Oriole over a little table towards the back of the\n",

      "‘You don’t know what you are asking,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s such a finicky prescription,\n",
      "it would drive anyone mad trying to make it up. It’s not so much the materials. There\n",
      "is, after all, a limit to the number of drugs from one part of the world or another that\n",

      "‘Why, that’s already three years it would take! And suppose it didn’t rain that year\n",
      "on the Rain Days?’\n",
      "‘Exactly,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Rain is seldom so obliging. You would just have to wait till\n",

      "when you have an attack of the illness. Then one of the pills is taken out and\n",
      "swallowed in hot water into which one and a quarter drams of tincture of\n",

      "‘God bless my soul!’ Zhou Rui’s wife exclaimed. ‘You would certainly need some\n",
      "patience! Why, you might wait ten years before getting all those things at the proper\n",
      "times!’\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we were lucky. Within only a year or two of the monk’s visit\n",

      "call from Lady Wang:\n",
      "‘Who have you got in there?’\n",
      "She hurried back into the outer room to make her report on Grannie Liu. Having\n",
      "finished it, she waited for some comment from Lady Wang, but finding that none was\n",

      "her to stay.\n",
      "‘Just a moment! There is something I should like you to take for me.’\n",
      "She called to someone outside.\n",
      "‘Caltrop!’\n",
      "The rings of the portière rattled and the young girl whom Zhou Rui’s wife had seen a\n",
      "few minutes before playing on the steps with Golden came into the room.\n",
      "‘You called, Madam?’\n",
      "‘Bring me that box with the flowers in!’\n",
      "Caltrop went into a side room and returned with a small embroidered box.\n",
      "‘There are twelve artificial flowers in here,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘They were made in the\n",
      "Imperial Palace, all in the latest fashion. I suddenly thought to myself yesterday what\n",
      "a pity it was to leave them lying around here doing nothing, and how much nicer it\n",
      "would be to give them to the girls to wear. I meant to send them round yesterday but\n",
      "forgot. It’s lucky that you came here today, because you will be able to take them for\n",
      "me. There are two each for each of the Jia girls. That leaves six. Then two for Miss Lin,\n",
      "and the remaining four for Mrs Lian.’\n",
      "‘Keep them for Bao-chai to wear,’ said Lady Wang. ‘What do you want to go\n",
      "bothering about our girls for?’\n",
      "‘You don’t know our Bao-chai. She is funny about these things. She has never liked\n",
      "ornaments or make-up or anything of that sort.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife took up the box and went out into the courtyard, where she came\n",
      "once more upon Golden, sunning herself on the steps.\n",
      "‘Tell me,’ she asked her, ‘is that little Caltrop the one they are always talking about\n",
      "who was bought just before they came to the capital? The one they had the murder\n",
      "trial about?’\n",
      "‘That’s her,’ said Golden.\n",
      "\f",
      "At that moment Caltrop herself came skipping up with a sunny smile on her face, and\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife took her by the hand and studied her curiously. Then she turned to\n",
      "Golden again.\n",
      "‘You know, there’s something about this child’s face that reminds me of Master\n",
      "Rong’s wife over at the Ning mansion.’\n",
      "‘That’s just what I’ve said,’ Golden agreed.\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife asked Caltrop how old she was when she became a slave. Then she\n",
      "asked her where her parents were, what her age was, and what part of the country\n",
      "she came from. But to all of these questions Caltrop only shook her head and said\n",
      "that she didn’t remember.\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife and Golden exchanged glances and sighed sympathetically.\n",
      "Bearing her box of flowers, Zhou Rui’s wife presently came to the part of the house\n",
      "behind Lady Wang’s quarters. Grand?mother Jia had recently decided that her\n",
      "granddaughters were becoming too numerous and declared that she would retain\n",
      "only Bao-yu and Dai-yu in her own apartments to keep her amused. Ying-chun,\n",
      "Tan-chun and Xi-chun were to move out into the penthouse behind Lady Wang’s,\n",
      "with Li Wan to supervise them and keep them company. Thither, accordingly, Zhou\n",
      "Rui’s wife now directed her steps.\n",
      "A number of little maids were sitting under the eaves there waiting to be called, and\n",
      "just as she arrived, Ying-chun’s maid Chess and Tan-chun’s maid Scribe came through\n",
      "the portière, each carrying a teacup on a tray, from which she deduced that the two\n",
      "cousins must be inside together.\n",
      "On entering the room, Zhou’s wife found Ying-chun and Tan-chun sitting by the\n",
      "window playing Go. She presented the flowers and explained who they were from,\n",
      "and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks, and gave\n",
      "orders to the maids to take charge of them.\n",
      "‘Where is Miss Xi-chun?’ Zhou Rui’s wife inquired.\n",
      "‘Isn’t she in the next room?’ said the maids; and there in fact she proved to be,\n",
      "playing with the little nun Sapientia from Water-moon Priory. She asked Zhou Rui’s\n",
      "wife what she had come for, and when Zhou Rui’s wife took the flowers from the box\n",
      "and explained, she laughed:\n",
      "‘I was telling Sapientia that one of these day I am going to have my hair shaved and\n",
      "go off with her to be a nun, when just at that very moment you came in with these\n",
      "flowers. What shall I do with flowers when I have no hair to stick them in?’\n",
      "Further pleasantries followed from the others present.\n",
      "Xi-chun told one of the maids to take the flowers and look after them.\n",
      "‘When did you arrive?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked Sapientia. ‘And where’s that precious\n",
      "Mother Superior of yours gone off to, bald-headed old mischief?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘We arrived first thing this morning,’ said Sapientia. ‘Mother Euergesia went off to\n",
      "visit the Yu mansion after she had seen Her Ladyship. She told me to wait for her\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "Have you had this month’s donation yet?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘It was due on the\n",
      "fifteenth.’\n",
      "Sapientia said that she didn’t know.\n",
      "‘Who looks after the monthly donations nowadays?’ asked Xi-chun.\n",
      "‘Yu Xin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.\n",
      "‘That explains it. As soon as Mother Euergesia arrived, Yu Xin’s wife was in here like\n",
      "a shot and they were chattering together for ages. I expect that’s what it was about.’\n",
      "After gossiping a bit longer with Sapientia, Zhou Rui’s wife made her way to Xi-feng’s\n",
      "quarters. To get there she had to go down a passage-way between two walls, under\n",
      "the windows at the back of Li Wan’s apartments, along the foot of an ornamental\n",
      "wail, and through a gateway in the western cornet of the compound. When she\n",
      "entered Xi-feng’s reception room, a maid sitting on the threshold of the inner room\n",
      "hurriedly waved her away and told her to go across to the other side of the house.\n",
      "Taking the hint, Zhou Rui’s wife tiptoed quietly into the room opposite, where she\n",
      "found the baby’s nurse patting her rhythmically to make her sleep.\n",
      "‘Is the mistress taking her afternoon nap?’ she asked the nurse in a low whisper. ‘I\n",
      "think you’ll have to wake her, even if she is.’\n",
      "The nurse smiled, grimaced, and shook her head. Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask\n",
      "her what she meant when she heard a low laugh in what was unmistakably Jia Lian’s\n",
      "voice from the room opposite. It was followed almost immediately by the sound of\n",
      "the door opening, and Patience came out carrying a large copper basin which she\n",
      "asked one of the maids to fetch water in.\n",
      "‘Ah, Mrs Zhou!’ she said, catching sight of Zhou Rui’s wife and crossing into the\n",
      "room opposite ‘What brings you back again?’\n",
      "         Zhou Rui’s wife hastily rose to her feet and picking up the box, proferred it\n",
      "to Patience and explained her mission. Patience opened the lid, selected four of the\n",
      "flowers, and slipped away again for several minutes. She came back with two still in\n",
      "her hand, which she gave to a little page called Sunshine.\n",
      "‘Take these to Master Rong’s wife over in the Ning mansion and tell her they are for\n",
      "her to wear,’ she said. Then turning to Zhou Rui’s wife she asked her to convey\n",
      "Xi-feng’s thanks to the donor.\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Just as\n",
      "she was coming out of the covered passage-way, she ran head-on into her daughter,\n",
      "all dressed up in her best clothes having just arrived on a visit from her\n",
      "mother-in-law’s.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘What’s suddenly brought you here at a time like this ?’ she asked her daughter.\n",
      "‘How have you been keeping, Mother? I’ve been waiting at your place for hours for\n",
      "you to come back. What’s been keeping you all this time? I got tired of waiting. I\n",
      "thought I’d go and say “hullo” to Her Old Ladyship, and now I was just on my way to\n",
      "see Her Ladyship. Have you still not finished then? What’s that you’ve got in your\n",
      "hand?’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.\n",
      "‘Today is not my lucky day! First of all someone called Grannie Liu turned up, so like\n",
      "a fool I spend half the day rushing around with her. Then, as if that wasn’t enough,\n",
      "Her Ladyships sister sees me and gets me delivering flowers to the young ladies. I\n",
      "haven’t finished yet. Now what have you come here today for? Something’s gone\n",
      "wrong, I’ll be bound !’\n",
      "‘I don’t know how you always manage to guess, Mother, but you’re right: it has. I’ll\n",
      "be honest with you. My man had a cup too much to drink the other day and got into\n",
      "a fight with someone, and now, out of spite, they are trying to stir up trouble for him.\n",
      "They say his papers aren’t in order, and they’ve reported him to the yamen and want\n",
      "to get him deported back South to his old village. So I thought I’d come and ask your\n",
      "advice, Mother, and see if you couldn’t get someone here to put in a word for him.\n",
      "Do you think there’s anyone who would be able to help?’\n",
      "‘I knew it would be something like this,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Well, cheer up, it’s\n",
      "not so serious as all that! You just go back and wait while I take these flowers to Miss\n",
      "Lin. You can’t see Her Ladyship now. She and the young mistress are both busy.’\n",
      "     The daughter obediently turned back to her mother’s quarters. As she went, she\n",
      "said pleadingly,\n",
      "     ‘Be as quick as you can, Mother, won’t you?’\n",
      "     ‘Yes, yes, yes. I’ll be as quick as I can! You young people take everything so\n",
      "tragically! Lack of experience, that’s what it is!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, and moved on to\n",
      "Dai-yu’s room.\n",
      "     Dai-yu was not in her own room, but with Bao-yu, trying to undo metal puzzles.\n",
      "     ‘Miss Lin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife with a smile, ‘Mrs Xue asked me to give you these\n",
      "flowers.’\n",
      "     ‘What flowers ?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let me see!’\n",
      "     He stretched out his arm, took the box from Zhou Rui’s wife, and looked. Two\n",
      "artificial flowers, exquisitely fashioned by Palace craftsmen out of silk gauze, lay\n",
      "inside it. Dai-yu glanced over his arm into the box.\n",
      "     ‘Am I the only one getting these, or have the others had some too?’\n",
      "     ‘All the young ladies are getting them,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘These two are for\n",
      "you, Miss.’\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘I thought as much,’ said Dai-yu sneeringly. ‘I get the leavings when everyone\n",
      "else has had their pick.’\n",
      "     Zhou Rui’s wife received this sally in silence, not daring to retort.\n",
      "     ‘What were you doing at my aunt’s place, Zhou?’ Bao-yu asked.\n",
      "     ‘Her Ladyship was there, and I had something to tell her.\n",
      "Then while I was over there, Mrs Xue took the opportunity of giving me these flowers\n",
      "to deliver for her.’\n",
      "          Was Miss Bao-chai there?’ Bao-yu asked. ‘Why hasn’t she been round these\n",
      "last few days?’\n",
      "‘She’s not very well.’\n",
      "Bao-yu turned to his maids.\n",
      "‘Which of you will go and see Miss Bao-chai for me? Say that Miss Lin and I send\n",
      "our regards to her and her mother, and ask her if her illness is any better and what\n",
      "she’s taking for it. Say that I really ought to go myself, but that as I’ve just got back\n",
      "from my lessons and have caught a bit of a cold, I shall be coming round another day.’\n",
      "Snowpink said that she would go, and she and Zhou Rui’s wife left the room together\n",
      "and went their separate ways.\n",
      "This son-in-law of Zhou Rui’s who had got himself into trouble was none other than\n",
      "Jia Yu-cun’s old friend, Leng Zi-xing. He had recently become involved in a lawsuit\n",
      "arising out of the sale of some antiques, and had asked his wife to get strings pulled\n",
      "for him at the mansion. Zhou Rui’s wife made light of the affair, confident of her\n",
      "employers’ power to in?fluence. A word to Xi-feng in the evening, and it would be as\n",
      "good as settled.\n",
      "\n",

      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "At lighting-up time that evening Xi-feng came in partial négligé(having removed her\n",
      "ornaments for the night) to report on the day’s affairs to Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘Today I received the things sent us by the Zhen family. The Zhens have their own\n",
      "boat delivering seasonal produce for the New Year, so I have given their people our\n",
      "presents to the Zhens to take back on their return journey.’\n",
      "Lady Wang nodded.\n",
      "‘I’ve got our birthday presents ready for the Earl of Lin?an’s mother,’ continued\n",
      "Xi-feng. ‘Who would you like us to send with them ?’\n",
      "‘Just see which women are free and send four of them,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘You\n",
      "don’t have to ask me about things like that I’\n",
      "‘Today Cousin Zhen’s wife invited me to spend tomorrow with them at the other\n",
      "\f",
      "house,’ Xi-feng continued. ‘Is there anything tomorrow that needs doing here ?’\n",
      "‘Whether there is or not,’ said Lady Wang, ‘I don’t see that it matters. Generally\n",
      "when she brings an invitation it is for all of us, and you are naturally too busy to go.\n",
      "This time the invitation is to you personally, which shows that she had deliberately\n",
      "arranged this in order to give you a rest. The thought is a kind one, and it would be\n",
      "ungrateful to refuse. I think you ought to go.’\n",
      "By now Li Wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty, and when\n",
      "all had wished Lady Wang good night they departed to their different rooms.\n",
      "Next day, as soon as Xi-feng had completed her toilet, she first reported to Lady\n",
      "Wang and then went to take her leave of Grandmother Jia. Hearing that she was\n",
      "going to the other house, Bao-yu said he wanted to go too, and Xi-feng was obliged\n",
      "to say that she would take him and to stand waiting for him while he changed his\n",
      "clothes. The two then got into a mule-cart and were soon inside the Ning-guo\n",
      "mansion, where Cousin Zhen’s wife You-shi, her son Jia Rong, her little\n",
      "daughter-in-law Qin-shi, and a large number of women attendants and maids were\n",
      "standing outside the inner gate ready to welcome them.\n",
      "You-shi’s encounters with Xi-feng were always the oc?casion of good-humoured\n",
      "banter. Taking Bao-yu by the hand and chatting to Xi-feng, she conducted them both\n",
      "into the main reception room, where they all sat down and were served tea by\n",
      "Qin-shi.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Xi-feng, ‘what have you asked me here for? Something nice, I hope! If\n",
      "it’s a present, you’d better bring it now; I’m a busy woman!’\n",
      "Before You-shi could think of a suitable retort, one of the women attendants replied\n",
      "for her:\n",
      "‘You ought not to have come, Mrs Lian! Now that you’re here, we’ve got you in our\n",
      "power and you’ll have to do what we say for a change!’\n",
      "At that moment Jia Rong came in and paid his respects to the visitors. Bao-yu asked\n",
      "what had happened to Cousin Zhen.\n",
      "‘He’s gone into the country to see Father,’ said You-shi. Then she added, ‘It’s not\n",
      "much fun for you sitting here. Why don’t you go off and amuse yourself inside?’\n",
      "‘You’ve chosen a good day to come, Uncle Bao,’ said little Qin-shi. ‘Last time you\n",
      "were here you wanted to see my brother. Well, today he’s here. He’s sitting in the\n",
      "study at this very moment. Why don’t you go in and see him?’\n",
      "Bao-yu was for rushing off straight away. You-shi hurriedly ordered some servants to\n",
      "go after him in discreet attendance.\n",
      "‘Well now, just a minute I’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not ask him in here so that I can see\n",
      "him too?’\n",
      "‘Oh dear, I don’t think that would do at all!’ said You-shi. ‘Some people’s children\n",
      "\f",
      "aren’t used to rackety ways like ours. Some people’s children are quiet and refined. If\n",
      "they were to meet a termagant like you, they might die of laughing.’\n",
      "‘He’ll be lucky if I don’t laugh at him,’ said Xi-feng cheer-fully. ‘He’d better not try\n",
      "laughing at me!’\n",
      "‘He’s very, very shy, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong. We are afraid that if you saw him it might\n",
      "only irritate you.’\n",
      "‘Fiddlestick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t care if he’s a three-faced wonder with eight arms,\n",
      "I still want to see him. Stop fatting about and bring him in, or I’ll box your ears!’\n",
      "Jia Rong cringed in mock alarm.\n",
      "‘Yes, Auntie! No need to get so fierce! We’ll bring him in straight away.’\n",
      "They both laughed, and Jia Rong disappeared for a while and presently came back\n",
      "leading a youth who, though some?what thinner than Bao-yu, was mote than his\n",
      "equal in freshness and liveliness of feature, in delicacy of complexion,\n",
      "hand?someness of figure, and grace of deportment, but whose painful bashfulness\n",
      "created a somewhat girlish impression. He approached Xi-feng and made his bow\n",
      "with a shy con?fusion which delighted her.\n",
      "‘You’ve met your match!’ she said to Bao-yu with a laugh, nudging him playfully.\n",
      "Then, leaning forward and gripping the boy’s hand in her own, she drew him down\n",
      "beside her and proceeded in a very deliberate manner to ask him how old he was,\n",
      "what books he was reading, and various other matters -among them his name, which\n",
      "was Qin Zhong.\n",
      "          When the maids and womenfolk in attendance on Xi-feng realized that she\n",
      "was about to meet Qin Zhong and that they had come without the requisite material\n",
      "for a First Meeting present, they had sent some of their number back to consult\n",
      "Patience in the other house. Patience had, at her own dis?cretion, selected a suitable\n",
      "length of material and two little ‘Top of the List’ solid gold medallions to give the\n",
      "mes?sengers. These gifts now arrived for Xi-feng (who thought them somewhat on\n",
      "the meagre side) to give to Qin Zhong. When he and his sister had formally thanked\n",
      "her, the company sat down to lunch, after which You-shi, Xi-feng and Qin?-shi settled\n",
      "down to a game of cards, while Bao-yu and Qin Zhong left the table to converse\n",
      "elsewhere.\n",
      "When Bao-yu first set eyes on Qin Zhong it had been as though part of his soul had\n",
      "left him. For a while he stared blankly, oblivious to all around him, while a stream of\n",
      "idle fancies passed through his mind.\n",
      "‘How perfect he is! Who would have believed there could be such perfection? Now\n",
      "that I have seen him I know that I am just a pig wallowing in the mud, a mangy dog!\n",
      "Why, why did I have to be born in this pretentious aristocratic household? Why\n",
      "couldn’t I have been born in the family of some poor scholar or low-grade clerk?\n",
      "\f",
      "Then I could have been neat him and got to know him, and my life would have been\n",
      "worth living. Though I am so much richer and more nobly born than he, what use are\n",
      "my fine clothes but to covet up the dead and rotten wood beneath? What use the\n",
      "luxuries I eat and drink but to fill the cesspit and swell the stinking sewer of my inside?\n",
      "O rank and riches! How you poison everything!’\n",
      "At the same time, Qin Zhong, struck by Bao-yu’s rare good looks and princely bearing\n",
      "and— even more perhaps—by the golden coronet and embroidered clothing and the\n",
      "train of pretty maids and handsome pages who attended him, was thinking:\n",
      "‘No wonder my sister raves about him whenever his name is mentioned! Why did I\n",
      "have to be born in a poor respectable family? How I should have liked to get to know\n",
      "him: to have shared moments of warmth and affection with him! But it was not to\n",
      "be!’\n",
      "Each, plunged in reverie, for a while said nothing. Then Bao-yu asked Qin Zhong\n",
      "about his reading, and Qin Zbong replied—a full, frank reply, without the trappings of\n",
      "polite?ness: and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and\n",
      "were already like old friends.\n",
      "After a while tea and various confections were brought in.\n",
      "‘We two shan’t be drinking any wine,’ Bao-yu said to the ladies. ‘May we have a\n",
      "plate or two of these things set out on the little kang in the other room? We can talk\n",
      "in there without disturbing you,’\n",
      "The two boys moved into the inner room for their tea.\n",
      "          In between plying Xi-feng with wine and delicacies, Qin?shi slipped in for a\n",
      "word with Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘My brother’s quite young, Uncle Bao. Please, for my sake, don’t mind him if he\n",
      "does anything to offend you! He may be shy, but he’s got quite a nasty temper. He’s\n",
      "not really easy to get on with at all.\n",
      "          ‘You go along I’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘We shall be all right!’\n",
      "          After a few admonitory words to her brother, Qin-shi went back to look\n",
      "after Xi-feng.\n",
      "          Some minutes later Xi-feng and You- shi sent a servant in to inquire whether\n",
      "the boys would like anything else to eat, adding that they had only to ask if they\n",
      "wanted anything. Bao-yu promised that they would; but his mind was not on eating\n",
      "and drinking, and he continued to question Qin Zhong about his life at home.\n",
      "‘My private tutor resigned last year,’ Qin Zhong told him. ‘Father is quite old, and as\n",
      "his health is not very good and his job keeps him terribly busy, he hasn’t been able to\n",
      "do any?thing yet about getting me another one. At the moment I am lust going over\n",
      "old lessons on my own at home. The trouble is, though, that if you want to get on in\n",
      "a subject, you really need one or two like-minded people to study with you, so that\n",
      "\f",
      "every so often you can all discuss what you have been reading...’\n",
      "          ‘Exactly!’ Bao-yu put in eagerly, not waiting for him to finish. ‘We have a\n",
      "private school in our family to which any members of the clan who can’t manage\n",
      "private tuition may send their children, and boys from related families who aren’t in\n",
      "the clan can also be admitted. I have been at a loose end ever since my tutor went\n",
      "home on leave, and Father would have liked me to go to this school for revision until\n",
      "he gets back next year and I can be taught privately again. But Grandmother said that\n",
      "with so many boys in the school I should be sure to get up to mischief, and it would\n",
      "do me more harm than good. She also said I couldn’t in any case go then, because I’d\n",
      "only just recovered after several days in bed. And so it got put off.\n",
      "‘From what you say, your father is worried about the same problem as mine; so\n",
      "why not tell him about this school when you get back today and ask him if you can\n",
      "join? I should be there to keep you company, and we could both help each other. I\n",
      "think it would be a marvellous idea.’\n",
      "‘The other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up, Father mentioned\n",
      "this school of yours as a possible alternative,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘He was going to come\n",
      "over and have a word with my sister’s father-in-law about it and get him to\n",
      "recommend me; but they were busy here at the time and it didn’t seem the right\n",
      "moment to bother them with a little thing like this. However, if you are really of the\n",
      "opinion that I could be of some service to you, even if it’s only grinding your ink or\n",
      "cleaning your ink-stone, do please arrange it as soon as you can, before we both get\n",
      "too rusty! We should be relieving our parents of an anxiety and having the pleasure\n",
      "of each other’s company at one and the same time; so it would be a good\n",
      "arrangement from every point of view.’\n",
      "‘Don’t worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll tell Cousin Lian’s wife presently, when we join the\n",
      "others. Then when we get back home tonight, you must tell your father and I shall\n",
      "tell my grandmother. There’s no reason that I can see why this shouldn’t be settled\n",
      "immediately.’\n",
      "They had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk, and now moved back into the\n",
      "lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while. When the latter\n",
      "had finished and had added up their scores, it appeared that Qin-shi and You-shi had\n",
      "lost to Xi-feng and owed her a dramatic enter?tainment at which the players and the\n",
      "drinks were to be provided at their expense. In the course of dinner, which was now\n",
      "served and at which they were joined by the two boys, it was decided that this\n",
      "should take place in two days’ time.\n",
      "As it was now quite dark, You-shi gave her women orders to see that two\n",
      "menservants were detailed to attend Qin Zhong on his way back home. The women\n",
      "were gone on their errand an unusually long time and eventually Qin Zhong rose to\n",
      "\f",
      "take his leave.\n",
      "‘Who has been chosen to go with him?’ You-shi asked.\n",
      "‘They have asked Big Jiao,’ said the women, ‘but it seems that he is terribly drunk\n",
      "and swearing at everybody.’\n",
      "You-shi and Qin-shi were indignant.\n",
      "‘Whatever did they want to go and ask him for? Any of the younger ones would\n",
      "have done. What was the point of provoking him?’\n",
      "‘I always said you were too soft with people,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You really mustn’t let\n",
      "servants get away with it like this. I never heard of such a thing !’\n",
      "‘You don’t know Big Jiao,’ said You-shi. ‘Even Father couldn’t do anything with him,\n",
      "let alone Zhen. When he was young he went with Grandfather on three or four of his\n",
      "campaigns and once saved his life by pulling him from under a heap of corpses and\n",
      "carrying him to safety on his back. He went hungry himself and stole things for his\n",
      "master to eat; and once when he had managed to get half a cupful of water, he gave\n",
      "it to his master and drank horse’s urine himself. Because of these one or two acts of\n",
      "heroism he was always given special treatment during Grandfather’s lifetime; so\n",
      "naturally we don’t like to upset him now. But since he’s grown old he has let himself\n",
      "go completely. He drinks all the time, and when he’s drunk he starts abusing\n",
      "everybody—literally everybody. I’ve repeatedly told the steward not to give him jobs\n",
      "to do—to behave exactly as though he were dead and ignore him completely. Why\n",
      "on earth should he have chosen him today?’\n",
      "     ‘I know this Big Jiao all right,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and I still say that you are too weak.\n",
      "You ought to send him away. Right away. Send him to live on one of your farms: that\n",
      "would put a stop to his nonsense!’ She turned to the women and asked if her own\n",
      "carriage was ready yet. The women replied that it was waiting, and she rose to take\n",
      "her leave and, taking Bao-yu by the hand, went out on to the steps, attended by\n",
      "You-shi and the rest.\n",
      "     In the flickering light of many lanterns the pages stood stiffly to attention on the\n",
      "pavement below, while Big Jiao, encouraged by Cousin Zhen’s absence to indulge his\n",
      "talent for drunken abuse, was getting to work on the Chief Steward, Lai Sheng,\n",
      "accusing him of being unfair, of always dropping on the weakest, and so on and so\n",
      "forth.\n",
      "     ‘If there’s a cushy job going you give it to someone else, but when it’s a question\n",
      "of seeing someone home in pitch bloody darkness, you pick on me. Mean, rotten\n",
      "bugger! Call yourself a steward? Some steward! Don’t you know who Old Jiao is? I\n",
      "can lift my foot up higher than your head! Twenty years ago I didn’t give a damn for\n",
      "anybody, never mind a pack of little misbegotten abortions like you!’\n",
      "     He was just getting into his stride when Jia Rong came out to see Xi-feng off in\n",
      "\f",
      "her carriage. The servants shouted to Big Jiao to stop, but without success. Impatient\n",
      "of the old man’s insolence, Jia Rong cursed him angrily.\n",
      "     ‘Tie him up,’ he said to the servants. ‘We shall see if he is still so eager for death\n",
      "tomorrow morning, when he has sobered up a bit.’\n",
      "     But Big Jiao was not to be intimidated by such as Jia Rong. On the contrary, he\n",
      "staggered up to him and bel?lowed even louder.\n",
      "     ‘Oh ho! Little Rong, is it? Don’t you come the Big Master stuff with me, sonny\n",
      "boy! Never mind a little bit of a kid like you, even your daddy and your granddaddy\n",
      "don’t dare to try any funny stuff with Old Jiao. If it wasn’t for Old Jiao, where would\n",
      "you lot all be today, with your rank and your fancy titles and your money and all the\n",
      "other things you enjoy? It was your great-granddad, whose life I saved when he was\n",
      "given up for dead, that won all this for you, by the sweat of his brow. And what\n",
      "reward do I get for saving him? Nothing. Instead you come to me and you put on\n",
      "your Big Master act. Well, I’ll tell you something. You’d better watch out. Because if\n",
      "you don’t, you’re going to get a shiny white knife inside you, and it’s going to come\n",
      "out red!’\n",
      "     ‘You’d better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business,’\n",
      "said Xi-feng to Jia Rong from her carriage. ‘It’s positively dangerous to keep a man\n",
      "like this on the premises. If any of our acquaintance get to know that a family like\n",
      "ours can’t keep even a semblance of discipline about the place, we shall become a\n",
      "laughing-stock.’\n",
      "Jia Rong assented meekly.\n",
      "     Several of the servants, seeing that Big Jiao had got quite out of hand and that\n",
      "something had to be done at all costs, rushed up and overpowered him, and\n",
      "throwing him face downward on the ground, frog-marched him off to the stables. By\n",
      "now even Cousin Zhen was being included in his mal?edictions, which became wilder\n",
      "and noisier as he shouted to his captors that he wanted to go to the ancestral temple\n",
      "and weep before the tablet of his old Master.\n",
      "    ‘Who would ever have believed the Old Master could spawn this filthy lot of\n",
      "animals?’ he bawled. ‘Up to their dirty little tricks every day. I know. Father-in-law\n",
      "pokes in the ashes. Auntie has it off with nevvy. Do you think I don’t know what\n",
      "you’re all up to? Oh, we “hide our broken arm in our sleeve”; but you don’t fool me.’\n",
      "    Terrified out of their wits at hearing a fellow-servant utter such enormities, the\n",
      "grooms and pages tied him up and stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung.\n",
      "    Big Jiao’s last words had been clearly audible to Xi-feng and Jia Rong, though\n",
      "they were a considerable distance away, but they both pretended not to have heard.\n",
      "Bao-yu, sitting in the carriage with Xi-feng, was less inhibited.\n",
      "    ‘Feng, what did he mean when he said “Father-in-law pokes in the ashes”?’\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘Hold your tongue!’ Xi-feng snapped back at him, livid. ‘It’s bad enough for a\n",
      "person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth, but to go asking\n",
      "questions about it, really! Just wait till I tell your mother! You’re going to get the\n",
      "biggest hiding you’ve ever had in your life!’\n",
      "     Terrified by her vehemence, Bao-yu implored forgiveness. ‘Please, Feng, don’t\n",
      "tell her! I promise never to say those words again.’\n",
      "     Xi-feng’s manner at once became soothing and indulgent.\n",
      "     ‘That’s my good little cuzzy! When we get back I must tell Grandma to make\n",
      "them explain to the school about Qin Zhong and arrange for him to be admitted\n",
      "soon.’\n",
      "     As they talked, the carriage bore them back into Rong-guo House. But what\n",

      "When Bao-yu and Xi-feng were back and had seen the others, Bao-yu told\n",
      "Grandmother Jia of his wish to have Qin Zhong admitted to the clan school. He\n",
      "pointed out that a congenial study-companion would stimulate him to greater effort\n",
      "and gave her a glowing account of Qin Zhong’s amiable qualities. Xi-feng was at hand\n",
      "to lend her support. She told Grandmother Jia that Qin Zhong would be calling on her\n",
      "within a day or two to pay his respects. Their infectious enthusiasm put the old lady\n",
      "in a high good humour, which Xi-feng took ad?vantage of to ask if she would\n",
      "accompany her to the dramatic entertainment which her opponents had promised in\n",
      "two days’ time.\n",
      "     In spite of her years Grandmother Jia loved any kind of excitement and when,\n",
      "two days later, You-shi came to fetch Xi-feng, the old lady did in fact accompany them,\n",
      "taking Lady Wang, Dai-yu and Bao-yu as well. By about noon, however, she was ready\n",
      "to go back and rest, and Lady Wang, who disliked noise and excitement, took the\n",
      "opportunity to leave with her. This left Xi-feng as principal guest, and she moved into\n",
      "the place of honour and stayed there for the rest of the day, enjoying herself\n",
      "immensely and not returning until late in the evening.\n",
      "     After accompanying Grandmother Jia back to her apartment and seeing her\n",
      "safely settled down for her nap, Bao-yu would have liked to go back and watch some\n",
      "more plays but was afraid that his presence would be an inconvenience to Qin?shi\n",
      "and his other ‘juniors’. Remembering that Bao-chai had been at home unwell during\n",
      "the past few days and that he had still not been to see her, he thought he would go\n",
      "there instead and pay her a call, but fearing that if he went the quickest way through\n",
      "the corner gate behind the main hall he might meet with some entanglement on the\n",
      "way or, worse, run into his father, he decided to go by a more circuitous route.\n",

      "passage-way instead of going straight on, and made off in a north-easterly direction.\n",
      "But he was out of luck, for as he did so he found himself facing Zhan Guang and Shan\n",
      "Ping-ren, two of the literary gentlemen patronized by his father, who were walking\n",
      "towards him from the opposite direction. They descended on him gleefully, one of\n",

      "‘Angelic boy! How seldom one has the pleasure! Is it really you, or is this some\n",
      "delightful dream?’\n",
      "They prattled on for what seemed an age before finally releasing him. As they were\n",
      "going, one of the old nurses detained them a moment longer.\n",
      "‘Have you two gentlemen just come from the Master’s?’\n",
      "The two gentlemen nodded and smiled conspiratorially:\n",
      "‘Sir Zheng is in his little study in the Su Dong-po Rooms, having his afternoon nap.\n",
      "All is well!’\n",

      "Turning once again, this time north-wards, he made his way swiftly towards Pear Tree\n",
      "Court.\n",
      "Once more he was unlucky. The Clerk of Stores Wu Xindeng, a man called Dai Liang\n",
      "who was foreman at the granary, and five other foremen were just at that moment\n",
      "coming out of the counting-house together and, catching sight of Bao-yu, at once\n",
      "stood respectfully to attention. One of their number, a buyer called Qian Hua who\n",
      "had not seen Bao-yu for some considerable time, hurried forward, dropped on his\n",
      "right knee, and touched his hand to the ground in the Manchu salute. Bao-yu\n",
      "smilingly extended a hand to raise him up. The men all relaxed in smiles.\n",
      "‘I saw some of your calligraphy in town the other day, Master Bao,’ said one of\n",
      "them. ‘It’s getting really good! When are you going to give us a few sheets for\n",
      "ourselves, to put up on the wall?’\n",
      "‘Where did you see it?’ Bao-yu asked.\n",
      "‘Any number of places,’ the men told him. ‘Everyone has been praising it no end.\n",
      "They even come to us asking for specimens.’\n",
      "‘You can have some easily enough if you really want to,’ Bao-yu said. ‘You have only\n",
      "to ask one of my boys.’\n",
      "He hurried on. The men waited for him to pass before dispersing about their\n",
      "business.\n",
      "To omit further details of his progress, Bao-yu came at last to Pear Tree Court, and\n",
      "going first into Aunt Xue’s room, found her giving instructions to her maids about\n",
      "some em?broidery. Her response to his greeting was to draw him towards her and\n",

      "\f",
      "‘What a nice, kind boy to think of us on a cold day like this! Come up on the kang\n",

      "‘What about Bao-chai? Is she quite better?’\n",
      "‘Ah yes, of course!’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You sent someone to ask about her the other\n",
      "day, didn’t you? That was very thoughtful of you. I think she’s inside. Go in and have\n",
      "a look! It’s warmer in there than here. You go in and sit down, and I’ll be with you in\n",
      "a moment when I’ve finished tidying up.’\n",
      "Bao-yu got down from the kang and going to the doorway of the inner room, lifted\n",
      "up the rather worn-looking red silk curtain which covered it. Bao-chai was sitting on\n",
      "the kang inside, sewing. Her lustrous black hair was done up in a simple bun without\n",
      "any kind of ornament. She was wearing a honey-coloured padded gown, a\n",
      "mulberry-coloured sleeveless jacket with a pattern in gold and silver thread, and a\n",
      "greenish-yellow padded skirt. All her clothing had the same sensible, rather\n",

      "‘I am quite better now. It was nice of you to think of me.’ She made him sit on the\n",
      "edge of the kang and ordered Oriole to pour him some tea. Then she proceeded to\n",

      "while her eye took in the details of his dress.\n",
      "He had a little jewel-encrusted coronet of gold filigree on the top of his head and a\n",
      "circlet in the form of two dragons supporting a pearl round his brow. He was dressed\n",
      "in a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of russet-green material covered with a pattern\n",
      "of writhing dragons and lined and trimmed with white fox-fur. A\n",
      "butterfly-embroidered sash with fringed ends was fastened round his waist, and from\n",

      "‘Oh dear! I have chosen a bad time to come!’\n",

      "‘What exactly do you mean by that?’\n",
      "‘What do I mean by that ?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I mean that if I only come when he does,\n",
      "then when I don’t come you won’t have any visitors. Whereas if we space ourselves\n",
      "out so that he comes one day and I come the next, it will never get either too lonely\n",

      "Observing that Dai-yu was wearing a greatcoat of red camlet over her dress, Bao-yu\n",

      "‘It’s no time to go now, while it’s still snowing,’ said Bao-?yu’s old nurse, Nannie Li.\n",

      "outside they can go?’\n",
      "Bao-yu nodded, and Nannie Li went outside and dismissed the pages.\n",
      "By now Aunt Xue had finished laying tea, which included a number of\n",
      "delicious-looking things to eat, and invited the cousins to partake. While they were\n",
      "doing so, Bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by\n",
      "his Cousin Zhen’s wife that he had eaten at the Ning mansion only two days\n",
      "previously. Aunt Xue at once hurried out and fetched some of her own for him to try.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘This really needs to be eaten with wine,’ said Bao-yu.\n",

      "‘He shouldn’t have wine, Mrs Xue.’\n",
      "‘Oh go on, Nannie I’ Bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly. ‘I shall only drink one cup.’\n",

      "grandmother or your mother is there. But look at the trouble I got into the other day\n",
      "just because when I had my back turned for a moment some wretched person who\n",
      "ought to have known better gave you a sip or two to humour you! I didn’t hear the\n",

      "‘You don’t know how wild he can be, Mrs Xue,’ she continued. ‘And he gets even\n",
      "worse when he’s had something to drink. With Her Old Ladyship you can never tell.\n",
      "One day when she’s feeling high-spirited she’ll let him drink as much as he likes;\n",
      "other days she won’t let him touch a drop. But come what may, I’m always the one\n",
      "that gets into trouble.’\n",
      "‘Poor old thing!’ said Aunt Xue with a laugh. ‘Have a drink yourself and stop\n",
      "worrying! I’ll see that he doesn’t drink too much. And if Lady Jia does say anything, I\n",
      "shall take full responsibility? She turned to one of the maids: ‘Come on’ now! Pour\n",
      "Nannie a nice warm cup of wine to keep the cold out!’\n",
      "Nannie Li could scarcely sustain her objection after this and went off with the other\n",
      "servants to have her drink.\n",
      "‘Don’t bother to heat the wine for me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I prefer it cold.\n",
      "‘Good gracious, that will never do! ‘said Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t drink wine cold, or\n",
      "when you write your hand will shake!’\n",
      "‘I’m surprised at you, Cousin Bao!’ said Bao-chai with a smile. ‘With all your\n",
      "enthusiasm for out-of-the-way learning, fancy not knowing a thing like that! Wine\n",
      "has an exceptionally fiery nature, and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be\n",
      "quickly digested. If it is drunk cold, it congeals inside the body and harms it by\n",
      "absorbing heat from the internal organs. From this day on you must reform! No more\n",
      "cold wine!’\n",
      "Dai-yu, who sat cracking melon-seeds between her teeth throughout this homily,\n",
      "smiled ironically. Just at that moment her maid Snowgoose came hurrying in with a\n",
      "little hand-warmer for her.\n",
      "‘Who told you to bring this?’ Dai-yu asked her. ‘Very kind of them, I am sure. But I\n",
      "was not actually freezing to death here.’\n",
      "‘Nightingale told me to bring it, Miss. She was afraid you might be cold.’\n",
      "‘I am glad you are so ready to obey her. Generally when 1 tell you to do anything it\n",
      "goes in one ear and out the other; yet anything she tells you to do is followed out\n",
      "\f",
      "more promptly than an Imperial Edict!’\n",
      "Bao-yu knew perfectly well that these words were really intended for him, but made\n",
      "no reply, beyond laughing good-?humouredly. Bao-chai, long accustomed to Dai-yu’s\n",
      "peculiar ways, also ignored them. But Aunt Xue protested.\n",
      "‘You’ve always been rather delicate and you’ve always felt the cold badly. Surely it\n",
      "was nice of them to think of you?’\n",
      "‘You don’t understand, Aunt,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t matter here, with you; but\n",
      "some people might be deeply offended at the sight of one of my maids rushing in\n",
      "with a hand-warmer. It’s as though I thought my hosts couldn’t supply one\n",
      "themselves if I needed it. Instead of saying how thoughtful the maid was, they would\n",
      "put it down to my arrogance and lack of breeding.’\n",
      "‘You are altogether too sensitive, thinking of things like that,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Such a\n",
      "thought would never have crossed my mind!’\n",
      "Bao-yu had soon finished his third cup of wine and Nannie Li once more came\n",
      "forward to restrain him. But Bao-yu, who was now warm and happy and in the midst\n",
      "of a hilarious conversation with his cousins, was naturally unwilling to stop, and\n",
      "pleaded humbly with the old lady for a reprieve.\n",
      "‘Nannie darling, just two more cups and then I’ll stop!’\n",
      "‘You’d better look out,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Your father’s at home today. He’ll be asking\n",
      "you about your lessons before you know where you are.’\n",
      "At these words all Bao-yu’s happiness drained away. Slowly he set down his cup and\n",
      "bowed his head in dejection.\n",
      "‘Don’t spoil everyone’s enjoyment,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Even if Uncle does call for you, you\n",
      "can always say that Aunt Xue is keeping you. I think that old Nannie of yours has had\n",
      "a cup too many and is looking for a bit of excitement at our expense. She gave him a\n",
      "gentle nudge to encourage a more valiant spirit in him, muttering, as she did so,\n",
      "‘Take no notice of the old fool! Let’s go on enjoying ourselves and not mind about\n",
      "her!’\n",
      "Nannie Li knew only too well what Dai-yu was capable of.\n",
      "‘Now Miss Lin,’ she said, ‘don’t you go taking his part! If you encourage him he’s\n",
      "only too likely to do what you say!’\n",
      "Dai-yu smiled dangerously. ‘Take his part? Why should I want to encourage him? You\n",
      "are over-cautious, my dear Nannie. After all, Lady Jia often lets him drink; why should\n",
      "it matter if Mrs Xue lets him have a cup or two? I suppose you think he can’t be\n",
      "trusted to drink here because Mrs Xue is not one of us?’\n",
      "Nannie Li did not know whether to feel upset or amused. ‘Really, Miss Lin. Some of\n",
      "the things you say cut sharper than a knife!’\n",
      "Bao-chai could not suppress a giggle. She pinched Dai-yu’s cheek playfully.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Really, Miss Frowner, the things you say! One doesn’t know whether to grind one’s\n",
      "teeth or laugh!’\n",
      "Aunt Xue laughed too.\n",
      "‘Don’t be afraid, my boy! Heaven knows I’ve got little enough to offer you when\n",
      "you come to see me. You mustn’t get upset over a small thing like this, or I shall feel\n",
      "quite uncomfortable. Drink as much as you like; I’ll look after you! You may as well\n",
      "stay to supper, in any case; and even if you do get drunk, you can always spend the\n",
      "night here.’ She told a maid to heat some more wine. ‘There! Auntie will drink a cup\n",
      "or two with you, and then we shall have some supper.’\n",
      "Bao-yu’s spirits began to revive a bit under his aunt’s encouragement.\n",
      "‘Keep an eye on him,’ said Nannie Li to the maids. ‘I’m lust going back for a few\n",
      "minutes to change my clothes.’ Then aside to Aunt Xue she said, ‘Don’t let him drink\n",
      "too much, Mrs Xue!’ and went off home.\n",
      "Although two or three old women still remained after her departure, none felt very\n",
      "much concern for Bao-yu, and as soon as Nannie Li was out of the way they quietiy\n",
      "slipped off about their own concerns, leaving, of the attendants who had come with\n",
      "him, only two small maids, whose only anxiety was to please their young master by\n",
      "indulging him as much as possible.\n",
      "Fortunately Aunt Xue, by exercising great tact and finesse, managed to spirit the wine\n",
      "away when Bao-yu had drunk only a few more cups, and to replace it with a hot, sour\n",
      "soup of pickled bamboo-shoots and chicken-skin. He drank several bowls of this with\n",
      "great relish and then ate half a bowl of green-rice gruel. After that, when Bao-chai\n",
      "and Dai-yu had finished eating, he drank several cups of very strong tea. At this point\n",
      "Aunt Xue felt sure that he would be all right.\n",
      "As Snowgoose and the other maids had now finished supper too and were once\n",
      "more in attendance, Dai-yu asked Bao-yu if he was ready to go. He looked at her\n",
      "blearily through tired eyes.\n",
      "‘If you want to go, I will go with you.’\n",
      "Dai-yu rose to her feet. ‘We really ought to go. We’ve been here practically all day!’\n",
      "The two of them began saying their good-byes.\n",
      "A maid came forward with Bao-yu’s rain-hat and he lowered his head slightly for her\n",
      "to put it on. Holding the brim of the great saucer-shaped red felt top, she jerked it up\n",
      "and prepared to bring it down, aiming the inside part at his crown.\n",
      "‘Stop!’ he cried impatiently.’ You have got to go easy with a great clumsy thing like\n",
      "that! Haven’t you ever seen anyone putting one of these things on before? You had\n",
      "better let me do it myself.’\n",
      "‘Come here!’ said Dai-yu standing on the edge of the kang. ‘I’ll put it on for you!’\n",
      "Bao-yu went and stood in front of her. Putting her two hands round the inner cap,\n",
      "\f",
      "Dai-yu eased it gently down until its rim fitted over his golden headband, so that the\n",
      "walnut-sized red woollen pompom of the headband was left quiver?ing outside the\n",
      "cap on its flexible golden stem.\n",
      "‘There!’ she said, after a few further adjustments. ‘Now you can put on your cape.’\n",
      "Bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself.\n",
      "‘The nurses who came with you are still not back,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Perhaps you had\n",
      "better wait a bit.’\n",
      "‘We wait for them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have got the maids. We shall be all right.’\n",
      "But Aunt Xue was not satisfied, and ordered two of her own women to see the\n",
      "cousins home.\n",
      "As soon as they were back they thanked the women for their trouble and went\n",
      "straight in to see Grandmother Jia, who had not yet had her supper. She was\n",
      "delighted to learn that they had been with Aunt Xue, and observing that Bao-yu, had\n",
      "had more than a little to drink, she told him to go and rest in his room and not come\n",
      "out again, and instructed the servants to keep a careful watch over him.\n",
      "Remembering which servants usually attended him, she asked what had become of\n",
      "Nannie Li. The maids dared not tell her the truth, which was that she had gone\n",
      "home.\n",
      "‘I think she must have had something to do,’ said one of them. ‘She came in when\n",
      "we did just now, but went out again almost immediately.’\n",
      "‘Why worry about her ?’ said Bao-yu over his shoulder, swaying slightly as he made\n",
      "his way to the bedroom. ‘She’s better looked after than you are! If it weren’t for her I\n",
      "might live a few days longer!’\n",
      "Inside his room he found a writing-brush and ink laid out on the desk. Skybright was\n",
      "the first to greet him.\n",
      "‘You’re a nice one!’ she said. ‘You made me mix all this ink for you this morning, sat\n",
      "down in a state of great en?thusiasm, wrote just three characters, threw down the\n",
      "brush again, rushed out, and left me waiting here all day for you to come back and\n",
      "finish. Now you just sit down here and use this ink up, and perhaps I’ll let the matter\n",
      "pass!’\n",
      "Skybright’s words awoke in Bao-yu a recollection of the morning’s events.\n",
      "‘What became of the three characters I wrote?’\n",
      "Skybright laughed. ‘You’re really drunk, aren’t you! This morning before you went to\n",
      "the other house you gave careful instructions that they were to be pasted up over\n",
      "the outside door. I was afraid that someone else might make a mess of it, so I got up\n",
      "on a ladder and spent half the morning sticking them up myself. My hands are still\n",
      "numb from doing it.’\n",
      "‘I’d forgotten.’ Bao-yu smiled. ‘If your hands are cold, I’ll warm them for you.’ He\n",
      "\f",
      "took both her hands in his own and led her outside to inspect the sheet of calligraphy\n",
      "newly pasted up over the doorway. Just then Dai-yu arrived.\n",
      "‘I want you to tell me honestly, cousin,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Which of these three\n",
      "characters do you think is the best?’\n",
      "Dai-yu looked up at the three characters above the door:\n",
      "\n",
      "RED RUE STUDY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They are all equally good. I didn’t know you could write so beautifully. You must do\n",
      "one for me some time!’\n",
      "‘You’re just saying that to humour me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Where is Aroma?’ he asked\n",
      "Skybright.\n",
      "Skybright shot out her lips and indicated the kang inside, on which Aroma, fully\n",
      "clothed, was lying fast asleep.\n",
      "‘Just look at that!’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘It’s a bit early for sleep, isn’t it?’\n",
      "He turned once more to Skybright. ‘When I was having lunch at the other house\n",
      "today there was a plate of bean-curd dumplings. I remembered how fond you are of\n",
      "those things and asked Mrs Zhen if I could have some to eat in the evening. She had\n",
      "them sent over for me. Did you get them all right?’\n",
      "‘Don’t talk to me about those dumplings!’ said Skybright.\n",
      "‘As soon as they arrived I realized that they must be for me, but as I’d only just\n",
      "finished eating, I put them on one side meaning to eat them later. Then after a while\n",
      "Nannie Li came in and caught sight of them. \"I don’t expect Bao-yu will want these,\"\n",
      "she said. “I think I’ll take them for my grand children\"; and she had them sent round\n",
      "to her house.’\n",
      "While Skybright was talking, Snowpink came in carrying some tea on a tray. Bao-yu\n",
      "invited Dai-yu to have some, to the great merriment of the maids, who pointed out\n",
      "that she had slipped away some minutes before.\n",
      "After drinking about half a cupful, Bao-yu suddenly thought of the tea he had drunk\n",
      "early that morning.\n",
      "‘When you made that Fung Loo this morning,’ he said to Snowpink, ‘I remember\n",
      "telling you that with that particular brand the full flavour doesn’t come out until after\n",
      "three or four waterings. Why have you given me this other stuff? This would have\n",
      "been just the time to have the Fung Loo.’\n",
      "‘I was keeping it for you,’ said Snowpink, ‘but Nannie Li came and drank it all.’\n",
      "With a flick of the wrist Bao-yu hurled the cup he was holding on to the floor, where\n",
      "it smashed noisily, breaking into innumerable pieces and showering Snowpink’s skirt\n",
      "with hot tea. He jumped angrily to his feet.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Is she your mistress that you should all treat her with such reverence? Merely\n",
      "because I drank her milk for a few days when I was a baby she is as spoiled and\n",
      "pampered as though she were some sort of divinity. Let’s get rid of the old woman\n",
      "now and have done with it!’\n",
      "And he strode off without more ado to tell Grandmother Jia that he wanted his old\n",
      "nurse dismissed.\n",
      "All this time Aroma had been only pretending to sleep, hoping by this means to\n",
      "engage Bao-yu’s attention and provoke some coquetry between them. As long as the\n",
      "talk dwelt on calligraphy and Skybright’s dumplings there seemed no pressing need\n",
      "for her to get up; but when she heard him break a teacup and grow really angry she\n",
      "hurriedly rose to her feet and intervened to restrain him.\n",
      "By this time someone had arrived from Grandmother Jia’s room to inquire what all\n",

      "words. This was Jia Qiang, a member of the Ning-guo branch of the family of the\n",
      "same generation as Jia Rong. He had lost both his parents when a small child and\n",

      "excursions into the Garden of Pleasure; but with a doting Cousin Zhen to protect him\n",
      "on the one hand and Jia Rong to aid and comfort him on the other, there was no one\n",
      "in the clan who dared thwart him in anything he did.\n",
      "Since Qin Zhong was the brother-in-law of his best friend, Jia Qiang was naturally\n",
      "unwilling to stand by and see him abused in so despiteful a manner without doing\n",
      "anything to help. On the other hand he reflected that there would be certain\n",
      "disadvantages in coming forward as his cham?pion.\n",
      "‘Jokey Jin, Jia Rui, and that lot are all friends of Uncle Xue,’ he thought. ‘For that\n",

      "for a stratagem of some kind which will shut the little beast up without causing too\n",
      "much embarrassment afterwards.’\n",
      "Having thought of a plan, he pretended that he wanted to be excused, and slipping\n",
      "round to the back, quietly called over Bao-yu’s little page Tealeaf and whispered a\n",
      "few inflammatory words in his ear.\n",
      "Tealeaf was the most willing but also the youngest and least sensible of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "pages. Jia Qiang told him how Jokey Jin had been bullying Qin Zhong. ‘And even\n",
      "Bao-yu came in for a share,’ he said. ‘If we don’t take this Jin fellow down a peg, next\n",
      "time he is going to be quite insufferable.’\n",
      "Tealeaf never needed any encouragement to pick a fight, and now, inflamed by Jia\n",
      "Qiang’s message and open incitement to action, he marched straight into the\n",
      "classroom to look for Jokey Jin. And there was no ‘Master Jin’ when he saw him,\n",
      "either: it was ‘Jin! Who do you think you are?’\n",
      "At this point Jia Qiang began to scrape his boots on the floor and make a great\n",
      "business of straightening his clothes and glancing out of the window at the sky,\n",
      "muttering to himself as he did so, ‘Ah, yes. Hmn. Must be about time.’ Going up to Jia\n",
      "Rui, he informed him that he had an engagement which necessitated his leaving early,\n",
      "and Jia Rui not having the courage to stop him, allowed him to slip away.\n",
      "Tealeaf had by now singled out Jokey Jin and grabbed him by the front of his jacket.\n",
      "‘Whether we fuck arseholes or not,’ he said, ‘what fucking business is it of yours?\n",
      "You should be bloody grateful we haven’t fucked your dad. Come outside and fight it\n",
      "out with me, if you’ve got any spunk in you!’\n",
      "‘Tealeaf!’ Jia Rui shouted agitatedly. ‘You are not to use such language in here!’\n",
      "Jokey Jin’s face turned pale with anger.\n",
      "‘This is mutiny! I don’t have to take this sort of thing from a slave. I shall see your\n",

      "Jia Lan and Jia Jun belonged to the Rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same\n",
      "generation as the other Jia Lan, the little son of Li Wan and nephew of Bao-yu. Jia Jun\n",
      "had lost his father in infancy and was doted on by his widowed mother. Jia Lan was\n",
      "his best friend, which is why they always sat next to each other in school. Though Jia\n",
      "Jun was among the youngest in the class, his tiny body contained an heroic soul. He\n",
      "was extremely mischievous and completely fearless. With the impartial interest of an\n",
      "observer he had watched a friend of Jokey Jin’s slyly aim the inkstone at Tealeaf; but\n",
      "\f",
      "when it fell short and landed right in front of him on his own desk, smashing a\n",
      "porcelain water-bottle and showering his books with inky water, his blood was up.\n",
      "‘Rotten swine!’ he shouted. ‘If this is a free-for-all, here goes!’ and he grabbed at\n",
      "the inkstone intending to send it sailing back. But Jia Lan was a man of peace and\n",
      "held it firmly down.\n",
      "‘Leave it, old chap! It’s none of our business,’ he coun?selled.\n",
      "Jia Jun was not to be restrained, however. Deprived of the inkstone, he picked up a\n",
      "satchel full of books and raising it in both hands above his head, hurled it in the\n",
      "direction of the assailant. Unfortunately his body was too small and his strength too\n",
      "puny for so great a trajectory, and the satchel fell on the desk occupied by Bao-yu\n",
      "and Qin Zhong. It landed with a tremendous crash, scattering books, papers,\n",
      "writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing Bao-yu’s teabowl to\n",
      "smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about. Nothing daunted, Jia\n",
      "Jun leaped out and rushed upon the thrower of inkstones to smite him.\n",
      "Meanwhile Jokey Jin had found a bamboo pole which he flailed around him: a\n",
      "terrible weapon in so confined and crowded a space. Soon Tealeaf had sustained a\n",
      "blow from it and was bawling for reinforcements from outside. There were three\n",
      "other pages in attendance on Bao-yu besides himself, all equally inclined to mischief.\n",
      "Their names were Sweeper, Ploughboy and Inky. With a great shout of ‘To arms! To\n",
      "arms! Down with the bastards!’ these three now came rushing like angry hornets\n",
      "into the classroom, Inky wielding a door-bar which he had picked up and Sweeper\n",
      "and Ploughboy brandishing horsewhips.\n",
      "Jia Rui, in a frenzy of outraged authority, hopped from one to the other, alternately\n",
      "grabbing and cajoling, but none would take the slightest bit of notice. Disorder was\n",
      "now general. The more mischievous of the scholars mingled glee-fully in the fray, safe,\n",
      "in the general scrimmage, to land punches at chosen foes without fear of discovery\n",
      "or reprisal. The more timid crawled into places of safety. Others stood on their desks,\n",
      "laughing and clapping their hands and cheering on the combatants. The classroom\n",
      "was like a cauldron of still water that had suddenly come to the boil.\n",
      "Li Gui and the other older servants, hearing the uproar from outside, now hurried in,\n",
      "and by concerted shouting eventually managed to call the boys to a halt. Li Gui asked\n",
      "them what they were fighting about. He was answered by a medley of voices, some\n",
      "saying one thing and some another. Unable to make sense of what he heard, he\n",
      "turned his attention to Tealeaf and the other pages, cursing them roundly and\n",
      "turning them out of the room.\n",
      "Qin Zhong had fallen an early victim to Jokey Jin’s pole, sustaining a nasty graze on\n",
      "the head which Bao-yu was at this very moment mopping with the flap of his gown.\n",
      "Seeing that Li Gui had succeeded in restoring some kind of order, he asked to be\n",

      "taken away.\n",
      "‘Pack up my books, Li Gui, and fetch the horse, will you? I am going to tell\n",
      "Great-uncle Dai-ru about this. We were shamefully insulted, and because we didn’t\n",
      "want to start a quarrel, we went along in a perfectly polite and reasonable manner\n",
      "and reported the matter to Cousin Rui. But instead of doing anything about it, he\n",
      "gave us a telling-off, stood by while someone called us filthy names, and actually\n",
      "encouraged them to start hitting us. Naturally Tealeaf stuck up for us when he saw\n",
      "we were being bullied. What would you expect him to do? But they all ganged up on\n",
      "him and started hitting him, and even Qin Zhong’s head was cut open. We can’t go\n",

      "don’t know how to behave. If you want my advice, the proper way to settle this affair\n",
      "is by dealing with it here, where it started. Not by rushing off and upsetting your poor\n",

      "away you are the head of the whole school and everyone looks to you to set an\n",
      "example. If anyone does anything they shouldn’t, it’s up to you to deal with it—give\n",

      "to this extent.’\n",
      "‘I did tell them to stop,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but they wouldn’t listen.’\n",
      "‘If you don’t mind my saying so,’ said Li Gui, ‘it’s because you’ve been to blame\n",

      "conscientious about it! We have three or four of them coming by turns every day,\n",

      "explained that our daughter-in-law isn’t well and told him how worried we are\n",
      "because we haven’t got a decent doctor who can tell us for sure whether it’s\n",
      "pregnancy or disease, so that we don’t even know how serious it is. Then Feng\n",
      "Zi-ying told me about a scholar friend of his called Zhang You-shi. He and Feng were\n",

      "reported to Jia Rong as follows:\n",
      "‘I took the Master’s card to the doctor at Mr Feng’s house and asked him to call. He\n",
      "said Mr Feng had already spoken to him about it, but he had been out visiting all day\n",
      "and only just got back and he simply didn’t have the energy to go out any more today.\n",
      "He said, “Even if I were to go round to your house now I shouldn’t be able to take the\n",

      "knowledge of medicine is really too slight for a consultation of this importance, but\n",
      "as your master and Mr Feng are so pressing, I obviously cannot refuse. But I hope you\n",
      "will explain this to your master.” And he said, “As for your master’s card, that is an\n",
      "honour I really cannot accept”; and he made me bring it back. Will you please pass\n",
      "on this message for me, Master Rong?’\n",
      "Jia Rong turned and went back into the room to tell his parents. Going out once more,\n",

      "About noon next day one of the servants at the gate came in to report:\n",
      "‘The Dr Zhang you sent for has arrived, sir’.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen went out to receive the doctor and con?ducted him into the main\n",
      "reception room, where they both sat down. He waited until the doctor had taken tea\n",
      "before broaching the subject of his visit.\n",
      "‘Yesterday Mr Feng was telling me about your great learning,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I\n",
      "gather that it includes a pro?found knowledge of medicine. I assure you I was very\n",
      "much impressed.’\n",
      "‘I am only a very indifferent scholar,’ replied Dr Zhang, ‘and my knowledge is really\n",
      "extremely superficial. However, Mr Feng was telling me yesterday of the courteous\n",
      "and con?siderate patronage of scholars which is traditional in your family, so when I\n",
      "received your summons I felt unable to refuse. I must insist, though, that I am\n",
      "entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all\n",
      "too soon become apparent.’\n",
      "‘My dear sir, you are altogether too modest,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Do you think I\n",
      "could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-in-law? We are relying on\n",
      "your superior knowledge to put us out of our uncertainty.’\n",
      "He left the doctor in the charge of Jia Rong, who conducted him through the inner\n",
      "part of the house to his own apartment, where Qin-shi was.\n",
      "‘Is this the lady?’ asked the doctor.\n",
      "‘Yes, this is my wife,’ Jia Rong replied. ‘Do sit down! I ex?pect you would like me to\n",
      "describe her symptoms first, before you take the pulse?’\n",
      "‘If you will permit me, no,’ said the doctor. ‘I think it would be better if I took the\n",
      "pulse first and asked you about the development of the illness afterwards. This is the\n",
      "first time .I have been to your house, and as I am not a skilled practitioner and have\n",
      "only come here at our friend Mr Feng’s insistence, I think I should take the pulse and\n",
      "give you my diagnosis first. We can go on to talk about her symptoms and discuss a\n",
      "course of treatment if you are satisfied with the diagnosis. And of course, it will still\n",
      "be up to you to decide whether or not the treatment I prescribe is to be followed.’\n",
      "‘You speak with real authority, doctor,’ said Jia Rong. ‘I only wish we had got to hear\n",
      "of you earlier. Take her pulse now, then, and let us know whether what she has can\n",
      "be cured, so that my parents may be spared further anxiety.’\n",
      "At this point Qin-shi’s women carried in a large arm-rest of the kind used in\n",
      "consultations, propped her forward with her arms across it, and drew back her\n",
      "sleeves, exposing both arms at the wrist. The doctor stretched out his hand and laid\n",
      "it on her right wrist, then, having first regulated his own breathing in order to be able\n",
      "to count the rate, he felt the pulses with great concentration for the space of several\n",
      "minutes, after which he transferred to the left wrist and spent an equal amount of\n",
      "\f",
      "time on that. This done, he proposed that they should withdraw to the outside room\n",
      "to talk.\n",
      "Jia Rong accompanied him outside and sat with him on the kang. An old woman\n",
      "served tea, which Jia Rong invited the doctor to take, waiting until he had done so\n",
      "before asking him for his diagnosis.\n",
      "‘Tell me, doctor, from your reading of my wife’s pulse, do you think she can be\n",
      "cured?’\n",
      "‘Well, the lower left distal pulse is rapid and the lower left median pulse is strong\n",
      "and full,’ said the doctor. ‘On the right side, the distal pulse is thin and lacks strength\n",
      "and the median pulse is faint and lacks vitality.\n",
      "‘Now, a rapid lower left-hand distal pulse means that a malfunction of the\n",
      "controlling humour of the heart is causing it to generate too much fire; and the\n",
      "strong lower median pulse means that the liver’s humour is blocked, giving rise to a\n",
      "deficiency of blood. A thin, weak distal pulse on the right side indicates a gross\n",
      "deficiency of humour in the lungs; and a faint right median pulse lacking in vitality\n",
      "shows that the earth of the spleen is being subdued by the woody element of the\n",
      "liver.\n",
      "‘If the heart is generating fire, the symptoms should be ir?regularity of the menses\n",
      "and insomnia. A deficiency of blood and blockage of humour in the liver would result\n",
      "in pain and congestion under the ribs, delay of the menses beyond their term, and\n",
      "burning sensations in the heart. A deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise\n",
      "to sudden attacks of giddiness, sweating at five or six in the morning, and a sinking\n",
      "feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat. And if the earth of the spleen\n",
      "is being subdued by the wood of the liver, she would undoubtedly experience loss of\n",
      "appetite, lassitude, and general enfeeblement of the whole body. If my reading of the\n",
      "lady’s pulse is correct, she ought to be showing all these symptoms. Some people\n",
      "would tell you they indicated a pregnancy, but I am afraid I should have to disagree.’\n",
      "‘You must have second sight, doctor!’ said one of the old women, a body-servant of\n",
      "Qin-shi’s who was standing by. ‘What you have said exactly describes how it is with\n",
      "her; there is no need for us to tell you anything more. Of all the doctors we’ve lately\n",
      "had around here to look at her none has ever spoken as much to the point as this.\n",
      "Some have said she’s expecting; others have said it’s illness; one says it’s not serious;\n",
      "another only gives her till the winter solstice; not one of them tells you anything you\n",
      "can really rely on. Please doctor, you tell us: just how serious is this illness ?’\n",
      "‘I am afraid my colleagues have allowed your mistress’s condition to deteriorate,’\n",
      "said the doctor. ‘If she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning, when\n",
      "she first started her courses, there is every reason to suppose that she would by now\n",
      "be completely cured. But the illness has been neglected for so long now, this\n",
      "\f",
      "breakdown was almost bound to happen. I would say that with proper treatment she\n",
      "has about a one in three chance of recovery. We shall just have to see how she\n",
      "responds to my medicine. If, after taking it, she can get a good night’s sleep, her\n",
      "chances will be distinctly better: say fifty?-fifty.\n",
      "‘From my reading of her pulse, I should expect your mistress to be a very highly\n",
      "strung, sensitive young woman. Sometimes, when people are over-sensitive, they\n",
      "find a good deal that is upsetting in what goes on around them; and of course, if\n",
      "things are upsetting them, they will tend to worry a lot. This illness has been caused\n",
      "by too much worry affecting the spleen and causing an excess of wood in the liver,\n",
      "with the result that the menstrual blood has been prevented from flowing at the\n",
      "proper times. If we were to ask your mistress about the dates of her courses, I am\n",
      "sure we should find that they tended to be on the late side, isn’t that so?’\n",
      "‘Absolutely right,’ the old woman replied. ‘Her periods have never been early.\n",
      "Sometimes two or three days late, sometimes as much as ten days: but in any case,\n",
      "always late.’\n",
      "‘You see!’ said the doctor. ‘There is the cause of the trouble. If she could have been\n",
      "treated in time with something to fortify the heart and stabilize the humours, she\n",
      "would never have got into this present state. What we have now, I am afraid, is an\n",
      "advanced case of dehydration. Well, we shall have to see what my medicine can do\n",
      "for her.’\n",

      "expecting at all. He said she was suffering from a serious illness. He wrote a\n",
      "prescription for her yesterday and she has already had one dose of the medicine.\n",
      "Today her giddiness is a bit better, but everything else is still pretty much the same.’\n",
      "‘There!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I thought it must be something quite serious to keep her\n",
      "away, especially on a day like this. I know she would have forced herself to come if\n",
      "she could have done.’\n",
      "‘You remember you saw her here on the third,’ said You-shi. ‘She had a terrible\n",
      "struggle to keep going on that occasion. It was only because the two of you have\n",
      "always been so close and she didn’t want to miss you that she made the effort.’\n",
      "Xi-feng’s eyes became moist and for a moment she was too overcome to speak.\n",

      "‘but she’s only a child still. If anything should happen to her as a result of this illness, I\n",
      "think all the fun would go out of life!’\n",
      "While she was speaking Jia Rong came in, and having greeted in turn first Lady Xing,\n",
      "then Lady Wang, and then Xi-feng, he turned to his mother:\n",
      "‘I’ve just delivered the food to Grandfather, and I told him that Father was\n",
      "entertaining all the men of the family at home and had not presumed to visit him\n",
      "because of what he said. Grandfather was very pleased. He said “That is exactly as it\n",
      "should be.” He said I was to tell you and Father to see that my great-uncles and\n",
      "great-aunts are properly looked after, and he told me that I was to look after my\n",
      "uncles and aunts and cousins. He also said he wanted the blocks for Divine Rewards\n",
      "to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution.\n",
      "I’ve already given this message to Father. Now I’ve got to hurry off again to look after\n",
      "the gentlemen while they have their dinner.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Rong, just a moment!’ said Xi-feng as he was going. ‘How is it really with your\n",
      "wife?’\n",
      "Jia Rong’s brows contracted in a worried frown.\n",
      "‘She’s not at all well, Auntie. You’ll know what I mean when you see her presently.’\n",
      "He left without saying any more.\n",
      "‘Well, ladies!’ said You-shi. ‘Will you have dinner in here, or shall we eat in the\n",
      "garden? There are some actors in the garden preparing an entertainment.’\n",
      "‘In here would be all right, wouldn’t it?’ said Lady Wang with a glance in Lady Xing’s\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "You-shi at once gave orders to her women to serve. There was an answering cry from\n",
      "outside the door and a great flurry of domestics each bustling about her own\n",
      "contribution to the meal. In no time at all the table was laid and dinner ready. You-shi\n",
      "made Lady Xing and Lady Wang sit at the head with her mother, while she, Xi-feng\n",
      "and Bao-yu sat at the two sides.\n",
      "Lady Xing and Lady Wang politely protested that they had come to offer birthday\n",
      "felicitations, not to eat a birthday feast.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘After all these years of spiritual self-improvement, Uncle must by\n",
      "now be practically an Immortal. And with Immortals, as we all know, “it’s the thought\n",
      "that counts and not the ceremony”.’\n",
      "The others all laughed.\n",
      "You-shi’s mother, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng, having finished their meal,\n",
      "rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands, had just announced their intention\n",
      "of going into the garden, when Jia Rong came in with a message for his mother.\n",
      "‘My great-uncles and all the other gentlemen have just finished their dinner.\n",
      "Great-uncle She says he has business at home, and Great-uncle Zheng doesn’t like\n",
      "plays because he says he can’t stand the noise; but all the others have gone with\n",
      "Uncle Lian and Cousin Qiang to watch the players.\n",
      "‘People have come with cards and birthday presents from the Prince of An-nan, the\n",
      "Prince of Dong-ping, the Prince of Xi-ning, the Prince of Bei-jing, the Duke of\n",
      "Zhen-guo and five others of the Niu clan and the Marquis of Zhong-jing and seven\n",
      "others of the Shi clan. The presents have all been received at the counting-house.\n",
      "They have been entered in the gift-book, and the people who brought them have\n",
      "been issued with thank-you cards. They have also been tipped the usual amounts and\n",
      "given a meal before leaving.\n",
      "‘And Father says will you please bring the great-aunts and Grandmother You and\n",
      "Auntie Feng to the garden now.’\n",
      "‘Yes, we’ve finished too,’ said You-shi. We were about to come over when you\n",
      "arrived.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Aunt Wang,’ said Xi-feng, ‘may I go and see Rong’s wife first? I can go on to the\n",
      "garden from there.’\n",
      "‘Certainly. You ought to go,’ said Lady Wang. ‘In fact, we should all like to go with\n",
      "you, but I am afraid it would be too much excitement for her. Please give her our\n",
      "love.’\n",
      "‘My dear,’ said You-shi, ‘I know she will always do any-thing you ask her to. See if\n",
      "you can talk her into a more cheerful frame of mind. It would be such a relief to me if\n",
      "you could. But join us in the garden as soon as you can!’\n",
      "Bao-yu asked if he could go with Xi-feng to see Qin-shi.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She is your nephew’s wife. I think you should. Just look in for\n",
      "a moment, though, and then join the rest of us.’\n",
      "Thereupon You-shi invited Lady Wang, Lady Xing and old Mrs You to accompany her\n",
      "to the All-scents Garden, while Xi-feng and Bao-yu accompanied Jia Rong to Qin-shi’s\n",
      "room.\n",
      "Entering the door of the apartment, they tiptoed softly into the inner room. As soon\n",
      "as she saw them, Qin-shi attempted to rise, but Xi-feng would not let her.\n",
      "‘No, no, don’t get up!’ she said. ‘You will make yourself giddy.’\n",
      "In two rapid strides she was at her side and holding her by the hand.\n",
      "‘My dearest child! It’s only a few days since last I saw you, but look how thin you\n",
      "have grown!’\n",
      "She sat down beside her on the quilt on which she sat propped. Bao-yu, after\n",
      "greeting her, sat in a chair opposite.\n",
      "‘Pour out some tea,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Auntie Feng and Uncle Bao didn’t get any after\n",
      "their dinner.’\n",
      "Qin-shi grasped Xi-feng’s hand and forced a smile to her wan face.\n",
      "‘It looks as though I wasn’t meant to be happy, Auntie!’ she said. ‘This is such a\n",
      "lovely family to have married into. Rong’s parents treat me as if I were their own\n",
      "daughter. Rong may be young, but he respects me, and I respect him; there has never\n",
      "been a cross word between us. You, it goes without saying—but not only you, all the\n",
      "older members of the family—have always been goodness itself to me. I did so want\n",
      "to he worthy of all this kindness. But now this wretched illness has come along and\n",
      "taken away the chance. Now I shall never be able to be a good daughter to Rong’s\n",
      "parents; and however badly I want to, I shall never be able to repay any of the love\n",
      "you have shown me. I have a feeling inside me, Auntie: I don’t think I am going to last\n",
      "the year out.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had been studying the ‘Spring Slumber’ painting on Qin-shi’s wall all this time\n",
      "and re-reading the couplet by Qin Guan on the scrolls at each side of it:\n",
      "\f",
      "The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream;\n",
      "The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he did so, the memory returned of that earlier afternoon when he had slept in\n",
      "that very same room and dreamed about the Land of Illusion. He was musing on the\n",
      "contents of that dream when he suddenly became aware of the words that Qin-shi\n",
      "was saying. They pierced his heart like the points of a thousand arrows. Great tears\n",
      "welled up in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks. Xi-feng, seeing him, was herself\n",
      "deeply affected; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make Qin-shi even more\n",
      "distressed, whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up, she\n",
      "rallied him lightly on his tears.\n",
      "‘Don’t be such a baby, Bao-yu! It’s not really that serious: sick people always say\n",
      "things like that. Besides, she’s still young, and when you are young you can shake an\n",
      "illness off in no time at all. --- You mustn’t let yourself think such stupid things,’ she\n",
      "said, turning to Qin-shi. ‘You’ll make yourself worse.’\n",
      "‘If only she could get a bit of food inside her.’ said Jia Rong. ‘That’s her real trouble:\n",
      "she won’t eat anything.’\n",
      "‘Bao,’ said Xi-feng, ‘your mother told you not to stay long. If you’re going to be like\n",
      "this, you will only upset her, and in any case I expect your mother is beginning to\n",
      "wonder about you—You go on ahead with Uncle Bao,’ she said to Jia Rong. ‘I am\n",
      "going to sit a little longer with your wife.’\n",
      "     Jia Rong at once led Bao-yu away to join the others in the All-scents Garden,\n",
      "while Xi-feng addressed some words of encouragement to Qin-shi, after which,\n",
      "dropping her voice to a murmur, she engaged in a long and intimate conversation\n",
      "with her, ignoring two or three messages from You-shi urging her to join the party. At\n",
      "last she felt unable to stay any longer.\n",
      "‘Look after yourself!’ she said. ‘I shall come again. I feel sure that you are meant to\n",
      "get better. It can’t have been an accident that they found that doctor the other day;\n",
      "and now that you’ve got him, there’s really nothing to worry about.’\n",
      "Qin-shi smiled.\n",
      "‘Even if he’s a miracle-man, Auntie, “death’s a sickness none can cure”, and I know\n",
      "that it’s just a question of time now.’\n",
      "‘If you will go on talking like that, how can you possibly get better?’ said Xi-feng. ‘If\n",
      "only you would try to look on the bright side. Remember what the doctor said. He\n",
      "said that if you weren’t being properly treated, next spring would be dangerous for\n",
      "you. If this were a household which couldn’t afford things like ginseng for your\n",
      "treatment, you might have something to worry about. But now they know that you\n",
      "can be cured, there’s nothing Rong’s parents wouldn’t do and nothing they couldn’t\n",
      "\f",
      "afford to do for you. Never mind two drams of ginseng a day; if you needed two\n",
      "pounds a day, they would get it for you gladly. So do try and get better! I must go\n",
      "over to the garden now.’\n",
      "‘Forgive me for not being able to see you out, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi. ‘Please come\n",
      "again when you are free. We’ll have a nice talk together, just the two of us.’\n",
      "There were tears in Xi-feng’s eyes as she promised to come often, whenever she was\n",
      "free. Then, followed by the women who had accompanied her from the Rong\n",
      "mansion and a number of female domestics belonging to the Ning household, she\n",
      "made her way round to one of the side gates leading into the gardens.\n",
      "        Golden chrysanthemums covered the open spaces;\n",
      "        Silvery willow-trees bordered the water’s margins.\n",
      "    The little bridge arched its span over a storied stream;\n",
      "    The winding path made its way into a fairy hill.\n",
      "        Crystal rills tinkled amidst the rocks.\n",
      "        A quickset hedge recalled preautumnal fragrances.\n",
      "        Crimson leaves fluttered upon the boughs.\n",
      "        A wintry copse described calligraphic traceries.\n",
      "        In the cold wind’s more insistent blast\n",
      "        The oriole’s cry could still be heard.\n",
      "        In the late sun’s more infrequent warmth\n",
      "        The cricket’s chirp a while revived.\n",
      "        At the far south-east end\n",
      "    Pavilions nestled in artificial mountains.\n",
      "    On the near north-west side\n",
      "    Verandahs brooded on circumjacent waters.\n",
      "    Music of little organs playing in the summer-house\n",
      "    Increased the melancholy in the air.\n",
      "    Glimpses of women’s dresses flitting through the little wood\n",
      "    Enhanced the delicacy of the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi-feng was making her way through the garden, admiring the view as she went,\n",
      "when a figure suddenly stepped out from behind an artificial hill of rock and made its\n",
      "way towards her:\n",
      "‘How are you, cousin?’\n",
      "Xi-feng gave a start of surprise and retreated a step.\n",
      "‘Isn’t it Cousin Rui?’\n",
      "‘Don’t you even know who I am, cousin?’\n",
      "‘It isn’t that I don’t know you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but you did come up rather suddenly\n",
      "\f",
      "and I wasn’t expecting to see you here.’\n",
      "‘We must have been fated to meet, cousin,’ said Jia Rui. ‘I had just slipped away\n",
      "from the party to take a little stroll in these peaceful surroundings. I never expected\n",
      "to meet my fair cousin here, but lo! So there must be a bond.’\n",
      "He ogled her as he spoke with a fixed and meaningful stare.\n",
      "Xi-feng’s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little\n",
      "game he was playing, and feigning an interest she did not feel, she answered him\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "‘I can see why Lian is always speaking so highly of you. From seeing you today and\n",
      "just hearing you speak those few words I can tell at once that you are an intelligent,\n",
      "good-natured sort of person. At the moment I’m on my way to join my aunts, and I’m\n",
      "afraid that I can’t stay and talk to you. Perhaps we could meet some other time when\n",
      "we are both free?’\n",
      "      ‘I should like to call on you when you are at home,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but I suppose a\n",
      "young person like your good self is not in a position to receive visitors of the other\n",
      "sex.’\n",
      "      Xi-feng feigned a laugh.\n",

      "      Jia Rui was secretly delighted by this encouragement.\n",
      "      ‘I never dreamed today would bring a chance like this my way,’ he thought, and\n",
      "the goatish eagerness of his expression grew even more repellent.\n",
      "      ‘You had better hurry back to the party,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If they catch you playing\n",
      "truant, you will find yourself being sconced!’\n",
      "      Jia Rui was by now scarcely in command of his own person. Slowly, very slowly\n",
      "he walked away, frequently turning back to gaze at Xi-feng as he did so. Xi-feng\n",
      "mischievously pro?voked him by deliberately slowing down the pace of her own\n",
      "progress through the garden.\n",
      "     ‘What an odious creature!’ she thought to herself when there was some distance\n",
      "between them. ‘Appearances certainly are deceptive! Who would have guessed he\n",
      "was that sort of person? Well, if he is, he had better look out! One of these days I’ll\n",
      "settle his hash for him; then perhaps he will realize what sort of person he is up\n",
      "against!’\n",
      "     Xi-feng had resumed a normal pace and had just skirted the foot of a little hill,\n",
      "when she saw two or three old serving-women hurrying towards her in a state of\n",
      "great agitation.\n",
      "     ‘Oh, Mrs Lian,’ said one of the old women with a smile, when they caught sight\n",
      "of her, ‘our mistress has been getting into such a state because you didn’t come!\n",
      "She’s sent us to fetch you.’\n",
      "\f",
      "    ‘Just like your mistress!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Always in a lather about something or\n",
      "other!’ and she sauntered on quite un?concernedly, talking to the old woman as she\n",
      "went.\n",
      "    ‘How many pieces have they done so far?’\n",
      "    ‘Eight or nine,’ the old woman replied.\n",
      "    By this time they had arrived at the rear entrance of the two-storey Celestial\n",
      "Fragrance Pavilion, where they found Bao-yu playing with a group of maids.\n",
      "    ‘Mind you don’t make a nuisance of yourself, Bao,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "    ‘Lady Xing and Lady Wang are sitting upstairs watching,’ said one of the maids.\n",
      "‘You can get up there from this side, madam.’\n",
      "    Lifting up her skirts, Xi-feng climbed slowly up the stairs. She found You-shi\n",
      "standing at the top waiting for her.\n",
      "    ‘You are an affectionate pair!’ said You-shi with a smile. ‘Once the two of you\n",
      "meet, there’s no separating you. Tomorrow you had better move in with her and set\n",
      "up house together! Come on, sit down! I’m going to drink a cup of wine with you!’\n",
      "    Xi-feng asked her two aunts for permission to sit. When she had done so You-shi\n",
      "held out the playbill and invited her to make a choice.\n",
      "    ‘It’s not for me to choose when Mother and Aunt Wang are here,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "    ‘Go ahead and choose!’ said Lady Xing. ‘Mrs You and your aunt and I have\n",
      "already chosen a number of plays. Now you pick out one or two good ones for us!’\n",
      "    Xi-feng politely rose to thank her, and taking the playbill from You-shi, scanned it\n",
      "through and picked out two of the items listed: one a scene from The Return of the\n",
      "Soul and the other ‘Gai-nian Plays His Guitar’ from The Palace of Eternal Youth.\n",
      "    ‘If they do these two after they have finished singing this scene from Faithful\n",
      "Bi-lian,’ she said, handing the playbill back to You-shi, ‘I think that will be just about\n",
      "enough for the day.’\n",
      "      ‘I’m sure it will,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We ought in any case to break up early, so that\n",
      "our hosts can get a good night’s rest. They have had a lot on their minds lately.’\n",
      "      ‘It isn’t often that you both come to see us,’ said You-shi.\n",
      "      ‘Please stay as long as you can. It will be so much more fun. It’s really quite early\n",
      "yet.’\n",
      "‘Where have all the gentlemen gone to?’ inquired Xi-feng, who had got up from her\n",
      "seat and was peering down into the lower storey.\n",
      "‘They have gone off to the Frozen Sunlight Gallery to drink,’ said one of the old\n",
      "women in attendance. ‘They left only a moment ago. They’ve taken the band with\n",
      "them.’\n",
      "‘What was wrong with this place?’ said Xi-feng, ‘Heaven knows what they can be\n",
      "getting up to behind our backs!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘We can’t all be as strait-laced as you are,’ said You-shi with a laugh.\n",
      "As they laughed and chattered together, the actors even?tually finished performing\n",
      "the second of the two pieces Xi?-feng had selected, whereupon the wine was\n",
      "removed from the tables and rice served. When they had finished their meal, the\n",
      "company retired to the main reception room indoors and took tea there, after which\n",
      "carriages were called for and the other ladies took their leave of old Mrs You. You-shi\n",
      "stood at the head of all the concubines and female domestics of the Ning household\n",
      "to see them outside, while Cousin Zhen at the head of the junior male members of\n",
      "his family stood beside the waiting carriages.\n",
      "‘You must come again tomorrow, ladies,’ said Cousin Zhen to Lady Xing and Lady\n",
      "Wang as they emerged from the house.\n",
      "‘I think not,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We have sat here the whole day being entertained\n",
      "and we are all rather tired now. I think tomorrow we should like a rest.’\n",
      "Jia Rui was staring fixedly at Xi-feng throughout this exchange.\n",
      "After Cousin Zhen had gone indoors again, Li Gui led out a horse and Bao-yu\n",
      "mounted on its back and rode off behind Lady Wang’s carriage. Cousin Zhen and the\n",
      "other males then sat down to supper and, when it was over, the party broke up. Next\n",
      "day there was another day of feasting for the members of the clan, particulars of\n",
      "which, however, we omit from our record. We shall confine ourselves to observing\n",
      "that from that day on Xi-feng paid frequent calls on Qin-shi. Sometimes her illness\n",
      "seemed slightly better for a day or two, sometimes it seemed slightly worse. Cousin\n",
      "Zhen, You-shi and Jia Rong were acutely worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "Jia Rui made several visits to the Rong mansion, but all his calls seemed to coincide\n",
      "with Xi-feng’s visits to the Ning mansion to see Qin-shi.\n",
      "The thirtieth day of the eleventh month, the day of the winter solstice, arrived. It was\n",
      "the turn of the season, and for several days before it Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang\n",
      "and Xi-?feng had been sending messengers daily to inquire after Qin shi. Each time\n",
      "the report they brought back was the same:\n",
      "‘She hasn’t got any worse these last few days, but she doesn’t seem to be very\n",
      "much better.’\n",
      "‘At this time of year,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it’s a hopeful sign if an illness like hers\n",
      "doesn’t get any worse.’\n",
      "‘Oh I do hope so!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That sweet child! If anything should\n",
      "happen to her, it would break my heart.’\n",
      "A wave of bitterness passed over her.\n",

      "better, come and tell me when you get back. And if there is anything the dear child\n",
      "has ever fancied eating in the past, see that she is kept constantly supplied with it.’\n",
      "Xi-feng promised to do as she had said, and on the second day of the next month she\n",
      "went over to the Ning-guo man?sion as soon as she had finished her breakfast.\n",
      "Qin-shi’s sickness appeared to be no worse than previously, but the flesh on her face\n",
      "and body was pitifully wasted. Xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her, and once\n",
      "more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness.\n",
      "‘We shall know the worst when the spring comes,’ said Qin-shi. ‘At least I’ve got\n",
      "past the solstice without anything happening, so perhaps I shall get better. Give\n",
      "Grandma and Auntie Wang my regards, won’t you. I’ve eaten one or two bits of that\n",
      "yam-cake with the date stuff inside that Grand?ma sent me yesterday. I found it quite\n",
      "easy to digest.’\n",
      "‘I’ll send you some more tomorrow,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I must go and see your\n",
      "mother-in-law, and after that I have to hurry back and give my report on you to\n",
      "Grandma.’\n",
      "‘Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my love, Auntie.’\n",
      "‘I will,’ said Xi-feng, and left her.\n",
      "She went into You-shi’s reception room and sat down.\n",
      "‘Tell me honestly,’ said You-shi. ‘What did you think of her?’\n",
      "Xi-feng sat silent for some time with lowered head.\n",
      "‘There’s no hope, is there? You’ll have to start getting things ready for the end. Of\n",
      "course, it’s always possible that doing so may break the bad luck.’\n",
      "‘I’ve already been quietly making a few preparations on the side,’ said You-shi. ‘The\n",
      "only thing we haven’t yet got is the right timber {or the you know what. But we’re\n",
      "looking round all the time.\n",
      "Xi-feng had some tea and chatted a while longer with You-shi. Then she said:\n",
      "‘I must hurry back to report to Grandma.’\n",
      "‘Break it to her gently,’ said You-shi. ‘You don’t want to give her a shock, at her age.’\n",
      "‘Of course,’ said Xi-feng, and rising to her feet went straight back home and called\n",
      "on Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘Rong’s wife asked me to give you her regards, Grandma. She sends you a kotow\n",
      "and she says she feels somewhat better. She begs you not to worry about her. And\n",
      "she says that when she’s made a bit more progress she’s going to come over to see\n",
      "you and make you a kotow in person.’\n",
      "‘How did you think she seemed?’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘For the time being there doesn’t seem to be anything much to worry about,’ said\n",
      "\f",
      "Xi-feng. ‘She seems to be in quite good spirits.’\n",
      "For a long time the old lady brooded in silence. Then, remembering Xi-feng, she told\n",
      "her to change her clothes and rest a while.\n",
      "Xi-feng said yes, she would, and after calling on Lady Wang, went back to her own\n",
      "apartment, where Patience had warmed her everyday clothes for her to change into.\n",
      "When she had changed, she sat down and asked Patience if anything had happened\n",
      "during her absence.\n",
      "‘Nothing, really,’ said Patience, handing her some tea. ‘Brightie’s wife came with\n",
      "the interest on the three hundred taels of silver and I received it for you. Oh, and Mr\n",
      "Rui sent someone to ask if you were in. He wants to pay you a call and talk about\n",
      "something.’\n",
      "Xi-feng snorted.\n",
      "‘Horrible creature! he seems to be looking for trouble. Just let him come, then!’\n",
      "‘What does Mr Rui want?’ asked Patience. ‘Why does he keep coming like this?’\n",
      "In reply Xi-feng gave her a full account of her encounter with him in the garden of the\n",
      "Ning-guo mansion and of the things he had said to her on that occasion,\n",
      "‘What a nasty, disgusting man!’ said Patience. ‘A case of “the toad on the ground\n",
      "wanting to eat the goose in the sky”. He’ll come to no good end, getting ideas like\n",
      "that!’\n",
      "‘Just wait till he comes! ‘ said Xi-feng. ‘I know how to deal with him.’\n",
      "But if you wish to know the outcome of Jia Rui’s visit, you will have to read the next\n",
      "chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 12\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Xi-feng sets a trap for her admirer\n",
      "And Jia Rui looks into the wrong side of the mirror\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Rui’s arrival was announced while Xi-feng and Patience were still talking about\n",
      "him.\n",
      "     ‘Ask him in,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "     Hearing that he was to be received, Jia Rui rejoiced in?wardly. He came into the\n",
      "room wreathed in smiles and over?whelmed Xi-feng with civilities. With feigned\n",
      "solicitude she pressed him to be seated and to take tea. He became quite ecstatic at\n",
      "the sight of her informal dress.\n",
      "     ‘Why isn’t Cousin Lian back yet?’ he asked, staring with fascinated eyes.\n",
      "‘I don’t know what the reason can be,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘Could it be,’ Jia Rui inquired archly, ‘that Someone has detained him on his way\n",
      "home and that he can’t tear himself away?’\n",
      "     ‘Men are all the same!’ said Xi-feng. ‘They have only to set eyes on a woman to\n",
      "begin another affair.’\n",
      "     ‘Ah, there you are wrong!’ said Jia Rui. ‘I am not that sort of man.’\n",
      "     ‘But how many men are there like you?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I doubt you could find one\n",
      "in ten.’\n",
      "     At this last remark Jia Rui positively scratched his ears with pleasure.\n",
      "     ‘You must find it very dull here on your own every day,’ he said.\n",
      "     ‘Yes, indeed!’ said Xi-feng. ‘If only there were someone who could come and talk\n",
      "to me and help me to pass the time!’\n",
      "     ‘Well,’ said Jia Rui, ‘I am always free. How would it be if I were to come every day\n",
      "to help you pass the time?’\n",
      "     ‘You must be joking!’ said Xi-feng. ‘What would you want to come here for?’\n",
      "    ‘I mean every word I say,’ said Jia Rui. ‘May I be struck by lightning if I don’t! True,\n",
      "there was a time when I should have been scared to come, because people always\n",
      "told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you; but now\n",
      "I know that in reality you are all gentleness and fun, there is nothing that could stop\n",
      "me coming. I would come now if it cost me my life.’\n",
      "     ‘It’s true then,’ said Xi-feng, smiling delightedly. ‘You really are an understanding\n",
      "sort of person --- so much more so than Rong or Qiang! I used to think that since they\n",
      "were such handsome and cultured-looking young men they must be understanding\n",
      "as well, but they turned out to be stupid brutes without the least consideration for\n",
      "other people’s feelings.’\n",
      "    This little speech went straight to Jia Rui’s heart, and un?consciously he began\n",
      "edging his seat nearer to Xi-feng’s. He peered closely at an embroidered purse that\n",
      "she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings.\n",
      "‘Take care!’ said Xi-feng in a low tone. ‘The servants might see you!’\n",
      "    Obedient to his goddess’s command, Jia Rui quickly drew back again. Xi-feng\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "‘You had better go!’\n",
      "    ‘Ah no, cruel cousin! Let me stay a little longer!’\n",
      "    ‘Even if you stay, it’s not very convenient here in broad daylight, with people\n",
      "coming and going all the time. Go away now and come hack later when it’s dark, at\n",
      "the beginning of the first watch. You can slip into the gallery west of this apart?ment\n",
      "and wait for me there.’\n",
      "    Jia Rui received these words like someone being presented with a rare and costly\n",
      "jewel.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Are you sure you’re not joking ?’he asked hurriedly. ‘A lot of people must go\n",
      "through that way. How should we avoid being seen?’\n",
      "     ‘Don’t worry!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll give the watchmen a night off. When the side\n",
      "gates are closed, no one else can get through.’\n",
      "     Jia Rui was beside himself with delight and hurriedly took his leave, confident\n",
      "that the fulfilment of all he wished for was now in sight. Having waited impatiently\n",
      "for nightfall, he groped his way into the Rong-guo mansion just before they closed\n",
      "the gates and slipped into the gallery, now totally deserted—as Xi-feng had promised\n",
      "it would be—and black as pitch.\n",
      "     The gate at the end of the alley-way opening on to Grand?mother Jia’s quarters\n",
      "had already been barred on the outer side; only the gate at the east end remained\n",
      "open. For a long time Jia Rui listened intently, but no one came. Suddenly there was a\n",
      "loud slam and the gate at the east end, too, banged shut. Alarmed, but not daring to\n",
      "make a sound, Jia Rui stealthily crept out and tried it. It was locked—as tight as a\n",
      "bucket. Now even if he wanted to get out he could not, for the walls on either side of\n",
      "the alley-way were too high to scale. Moreover the gallery was bare and draughty\n",
      "and this was the midwinter season when the nights are long and the bitter north\n",
      "wind seems to pierce into the very marrow of the bones. By the end of the night he\n",
      "was almost dead with cold.\n",
      "     When at last morning came, Jia Rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old\n",
      "woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up. Still\n",
      "hugging himself against the cold, he sprinted out of the other gate while her back\n",
      "was towards him. Fortunately no one was about at that early hour, and he was able\n",
      "to slip out of the rear entrance of the mansion and run back home unseen.\n",
      "     Jia Rui had lost both of his parents in infancy and had been brought up under the\n",
      "sole guardianship of his grandfather Jia Dai-ru. Obsessed by the fear that once\n",
      "outside the house his grandson might indulge in drinking and gambling to the\n",
      "detriment of his studies, Dai-ru had subjected him since early youth to an iron\n",
      "discipline from which not the slightest deviation was tolerated. Seeing him now\n",
      "suddenly absent him?self a whole night from home, and being incapable, in his\n",
      "wildest imaginings, of guessing what had really happened, he took it as a foregone\n",
      "conclusion that he had been either drink?ing or gaming and had probably passed the\n",
      "night in some house of prostitution --- a supposition which caused the old gentleman\n",
      "to spend the whole night in a state of extreme choler.\n",
      "     The prospect of facing his grandfather on arrival made Jia Rui sweat. A lie of\n",
      "some sort was indispensable.\n",
      "     ‘I went to see Uncle yesterday,’ he managed to say, ‘and as it was getting dark, he\n",
      "asked me to stay the night.’\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘I have always told you that you are not to go out of that gate without first\n",
      "informing me,’ said his grandfather. ‘Why then did you presume to go off on your\n",
      "own yesterday without saying a word to anybody? That in itself would constitute\n",
      "sufficient grounds for chastisement. But in addition to that you are lying!’\n",
      "     Thereupon he, forced him to the ground, and, with the utmost savagery, dealt\n",
      "him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo, after which he forbade him to eat and\n",
      "made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared\n",
      "the equivalent of ten days’ homework.\n",
      "     The exquisite torments suffered by Jia Rui, as he knelt with an empty stomach in\n",
      "the draughty courtyard reciting his homework after having already been frozen all\n",
      "night long and then beaten, can be imagined.\n",
      "     Yet even now his infatuation remained unaltered. It never entered his mind that\n",
      "he had been made a fool of. And so two days later, as soon as he had some free time,\n",
      "he was back once more looking for Xi-feng. She deliberately reproached him for\n",
      "having failed her, thereby so exasperating him that he swore by the most terrible\n",
      "oaths that he had been faithful. Seeing him hurl himself so willingly into the net,\n",
      "Xi-feng decided that a further lesson would be needed to cure him of his folly and\n",
      "proposed another assignation.\n",
      "     ‘Only tonight,’ she said, ‘don’t wait for me in that place again. Wait in the empty\n",
      "room in the little passage-way behind this apartment. But mind you don’t run into\n",
      "anybody.’\n",
      "     ‘Do you really mean this?’ said Jia Rui.\n",
      "     ‘If you don’t believe me, don’t come!’\n",
      "     ‘I’ll come! I’ll come!’ said Jia Rui. ‘Whatever happens, I shall be there.’\n",
      "      ‘Now I think you had better go.’\n",
      "      Confident of seeing her again in the evening, Jia Rui went off uncomplainingly,\n",
      "leaving Xi-feng time to muster her forces, brief her officers, and prepare the trap in\n",
      "which the luckless man was to be caught.\n",
      "      Jia Rui waited for the evening with great impatience. By a stroke of bad luck\n",
      "some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper. It was already lamplight when\n",
      "they left, and Jia Rui then had to wait for his grandfather to settle down for the night\n",
      "before he could scuttle off to the Rong mansion and make his way to the room in the\n",
      "little passage-way where Xi-feng had told him to go. He waited there for her arrival\n",
      "with the frenzied agitation of an ant on a hot saucepan. Yet, though he waited and\n",
      "waited, not a human shape appeared nor a human sound was heard, and he began\n",
      "to be frightened and a little suspicious:\n",
      "‘Surely she won’t fail me? Surely I shan’t be made to spend another night in the\n",
      "cold...?’\n",
      "\f",
      "As he was in the midst of these gloomy imaginings, a dark figure glided into the room.\n",
      "Certain that it must be Xi-feng, Jia Rui cast all caution to the winds and, when the\n",
      "figure approached him, threw himself upon it like a hungry tiger seizing its prey or a\n",
      "cat pouncing on a harmless mouse.\n",
      "‘My darling, how I have waited for you!” he exclaimed, enfolding his beloved in his\n",
      "arms; and carrying her to the kang, he laid her down and began kissing her and\n",
      "tugging at her trousers, murmuring ‘my sweetest darling’ and ‘my honey love’ and\n",
      "other such endearments in between kisses. Throughout all of this not a single sound\n",
      "was uttered by his partner. Jia Rui now tore down his own trousers and prepared to\n",
      "thrust home his hard and throbbing member. Suddenly a light flashed --- and there\n",
      "was Jia Qiang holding aloft a candle in a candlestick which he shone around:\n",
      "‘Who is in this room?’\n",
      "At this the person on the kang gave a giggle:\n",
      "‘Uncle Rui is trying to bugger me!’\n",
      "Horrors! The sight he saw when he looked down made Jia Rui want to sink into the\n",
      "ground. It was Jia Rong! He turned to bolt, but Jia Qiang held him fast.\n",
      "‘Oh no you don’t! Auntie Lian has already told Lady Wang that you have been\n",
      "pestering her. She asked us to keep you here while she went to tell. When Lady Wang\n",
      "first heard, she was so angry that she fainted, but now she’s come round again and is\n",
      "asking for you to be brought to her. Come along, then! Off we go!’\n",
      "At these words Jia Rui’s soul almost left its seat in his body.\n",
      "‘My dear nephew, just tell her that you didn’t find me here!’ he said. ‘Tomorrow I\n",
      "will reward you handsomely.’\n",
      "‘I suppose I could let you go easily enough,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘The question is, how big\n",
      "would this reward be? In any case, just saying that you will give me a reward is no\n",
      "good. I should want a written guarantee.’\n",
      "‘But I can’t put a thing like this down in writing!’\n",
      "‘No problem there,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Just say that you’ve lost money gambling and\n",
      "have borrowed such and such an amount to cover your losses. That’s all you need\n",
      "do.’\n",
      "‘I could do that, certainly,’ said Jia Rui.\n",
      "Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a\n",
      "writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance. Writing at his\n",
      "dicta?tion Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver\n",
      "as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once\n",
      "pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong. But\n",
      "Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and in?sisted that he would lay\n",
      "the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done.\n",
      "\f",
      "Jia Rui became quite frantic and kotowed to him. Finally, under pressure from Jia\n",
      "Qiang and in return for another IOU for fifty taels of silver made out in his favour, he\n",
      "allowed his scruples to be overcome.\n",
      "‘You realize, don’t you,’ said Jia Qiang, ‘that I’m going to get into trouble for this?\n",
      "Now let’s see. The gate leading to Lady Jia’s courtyard was bolted some time ago, and\n",
      "Sir Zheng is at the moment in the main reception room looking at some stuff that has\n",
      "just arrived from Nanking, so you can’t go through that way. The only way left would\n",
      "be through the back gate. The trouble is, though, that if you leave now, you might\n",
      "run into someone on the way, and then I should get into even worse trouble. You’d\n",
      "better let me scout around a bit first and come for you when the coast is clear. In the\n",
      "meantime you can t hide here, though, because they will shortly be com?ing in to\n",
      "store the stuff from Nanking here. I’ll find somewhere else for you.’\n",
      "He took Jia Rui by the arm, and having first blown the candle out, led him into the\n",
      "courtyard and groped his way round to the underside of the steps which led up to\n",
      "the terrace of the central building.\n",
      "‘This hollow under the steps will do. Crouch down there, and don’t make a sound!\n",
      "You can go when I come for you.\n",
      "Jia Qiang and Jia Rong then went off leaving him to him?self.\n",
      "Jia Rui, by now a mere automaton in the hands of his cap?tors, obediently crouched\n",
      "down beneath the steps and was just beginning a series of calculations respecting his\n",
      "present financial predicament when a sudden slosh! signalled the dis?charge of a\n",
      "slop-pail’s stinking contents immediately above his head, drenching him from top to\n",
      "toe with liquid filth and causing him to cry out in dismay --- but only momentarily, for\n",
      "the excrement covered his face and head and caused him to close his mouth again in\n",
      "a hurry and crouch silent and shivering in the icy cold. Just then Jia Qiang came\n",
      "running up:\n",
      "     ‘Hurry! hurry! You can go now.’\n",
      "At the word of command Jia Rui bounded out of his hole and sprinted for dear life\n",
      "through the rear gate and back to his own home. It was now past midnight, and he\n",
      "had to shout for someone to let him in. When the servant who answered the gate\n",
      "saw the state he was in and asked him how it had happened, he had to pretend that\n",
      "he had been out in the darkness to ease himself and had fallen into the jakes. Then\n",
      "rushing into his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed, his mind running\n",
      "all the time on how Xi-feng had tricked him. The thought of her trickery provoked a\n",
      "surge of hatred in his soul; yet even as he hated her, the vision of her loveliness made\n",
      "him long to clasp her to his breast. Torn by these violent and con?flicting emotions,\n",
      "he passed the whole night without a single wink of sleep.\n",
      "From that time on, though he longed for Xi-feng with un?abated passion, he never\n",
      "\f",
      "dared to visit the Rong-guo mansion again. Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, on the other hand,\n",
      "came frequently to his house to ask for their money, so that he was in constant dread\n",
      "of his grandfather finding out about the IOUs.\n",
      "Unable, even now, to overcome his longing for Xi-feng, saddled with a heavy burden\n",
      "of debt, harassed during the day?time by the schoolwork set him by his exacting\n",
      "grandfather, worn-out during the nights by the excessive hand-pumping inevitable in\n",
      "an unmarried man of twenty whose mistress was both unattainable and constantly in\n",
      "his thoughts, twice frozen, tormented and forced to flee --- what constitution could\n",
      "with?stand so many shocks and strains without succumbing in the end to illness? The\n",
      "symptoms of Jia Rui’s illness—a palpitation in the heart, a loss of taste in the mouth,\n",
      "a weakness in the hams, a smarting in the eyes, feverishness by night and lassi?tude\n",
      "by day, albumen in the urine and blood-flecks in the phlegm—had all manifested\n",
      "themselves within less than a year. By that time they had produced a complete\n",
      "breakdown and driven him to his bed, where he lay, with eyes tight shut, babbling\n",
      "deliriously and inspiring terror in all who saw him. Physicians were called in to treat\n",
      "him and some bushels of cinnamon bark, autumn root, turtle-shell, black leek and\n",
      "Solomon’s seal must at one time and another have been in-fused and taken without\n",
      "the least observable effect.\n",
      "Winter went and spring came and Jia Rui’s sickness grew even worse. His grandfather\n",
      "Dai-ru was in despair. Medical advice from every quarter had been taken and none of\n",
      "it had proved effective. The most recent advice was that the patient should be given\n",
      "a pure decoction of ginseng without admixture of other ingredients. So costly a\n",
      "remedy was far beyond Dai?-ru’s resources and he was obliged to go to the Rong-guo\n",
      "man?sion to beg. Lady Wang ordered Wang Xi-feng to weigh out two ounces for him\n",
      "from their own supplies.\n",
      "‘The other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for Grandmother,’ said\n",
      "Xi-feng, ‘you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you\n",
      "were sending to General Yang’s wife. I sent her the medicine yesterday, sol am afraid\n",
      "we haven’t any left.’\n",
      "‘Well, even if we haven’t got any,’ said Lady Wang, ‘you can send to your\n",
      "mother-in-law’s for some; and probably they will have some at your Cousin Zhen’s.\n",
      "Between you you ought somehow or other to be able to raise enough to give him. If\n",
      "you can save a man’s life by doing so, you will have performed a work of merit.’\n",
      "But though Xi-feng pretended to do as Lady Wang suggested, in fact she made no\n",
      "such inquiries. She merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent\n",
      "them to Dai-ru with a message that ‘Lady Wang had instructed her to send this, and\n",
      "it was all they had.’ To Lady Wang, however, she reported that she had asked the\n",
      "others and altogether obtained more than two ounces of ginseng which she had sent\n",
      "\f",
      "to Dai-ru.\n",
      "Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swal?lowed every medicine that\n",
      "they offered him; but all was a waste of money, for nothing seemed to do him any\n",
      "good. One day a lame Taoist appeared at the door asking for alms and claiming to be\n",
      "able to cure retributory illnesses. Jia Rui, who chanced to overhear him, called out\n",
      "from his bed:\n",
      "‘Quick, tell the holy man to come in and save me!’ and as he called, he kotowed\n",
      "with his head on the pillow. The servants were obliged to bring the Taoist into the\n",
      "bedroom. Jia Rui clung to him tenaciously.\n",
      "‘Holy one, save me!’ he cried out again and again.\n",
      "The Taoist sighed.\n",
      "‘No medicine will cure your sickness. However, I have a precious thing here that I\n",
      "can lend you which, if you will look at it every day, can be guaranteed to save your\n",
      "life.’\n",
      "So saying, he took from his satchel a mirror which had reflecting surfaces on both its\n",
      "sides. The words A MIRROR FOR THE ROMANTIC were inscribed on the back. He\n",
      "handed it to Jia Rui.\n",
      "‘This object comes from the Hall of Emptiness in the Land of Illusion. It was\n",
      "fashioned by the fairy Disenchantment as an antidote to the ill effects of impure\n",
      "mental activity. It has life-giving and restorative properties and has been brought into\n",
      "the world for the contemplation of those intelligent and hand?some young\n",
      "gentlemen whose hearts are too susceptible to the charms of beauty. I lend it to you\n",
      "on one important condition: you must only look into the back of the mirror. Never,\n",
      "never under any circumstances look into the front. Three days hence I shall come\n",
      "again to reclaim it, by which time I guarantee that your illness will have gone.’\n",
      "With that he left, at a surprising speed, ignoring the earnest entreaties of those\n",
      "present that he should stay longer.\n",
      "‘This is intriguing!’ Jia Rui thought to himself when the Taoist gave him the mirror.\n",
      "‘Let me try looking into it as he says, and holding it up to his face he looked into the\n",
      "back as instructed and saw a grinning skull, which he covered up hastily with a curse:\n",
      "‘Silly old fool, to scare me like that! -- But let me see what happens when I look into\n",
      "the other side!’\n",
      "He turned the mirror round and looked, and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to\n",
      "him to enter, and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her. There they\n",
      "performed the act of love together, after which she saw him out again. But when he\n",
      "found himself once more back in his bed he stared and cried out in horror: for the\n",
      "mirror, of its own accord, had turned itself round in his hand and the same grinning\n",
      "skull faced him that he had seen before. He could feel the sweat trickling all over his\n",
      "\f",
      "body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated.\n",
      "Yet still he was not satisfied, and turned the face of the mirror once more towards\n",
      "him. Xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling, and again he went in after\n",
      "her. He did this three or four times. But the last time, just as he was going to return\n",
      "from the mirror, two figures approached him hold?ing iron chains which they\n",
      "fastened round him and by which they proceeded to drag him away. He cried out as\n",
      "they dragged him:\n",
      "‘Wait! Let me take the mirror with me . . .!\n",
      "Those were the last words he ever uttered.\n",
      "To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he\n",
      "appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then\n",
      "to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from\n",
      "his grasp, he finally ceased to move.\n",
      "When they examined him more closely they found that his breathing had already\n",
      "stopped and that underneath his body there was a large, wet, icy patch of recently\n",
      "ejaculated semen.\n",
      "At once they lifted him from the bed and busied themselves with the laying-out,\n",
      "while old Dai-ru and his wife abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of grief. They\n",
      "cursed the Taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and\n",
      "cast the mirror upon the flames. But just at that moment a voice was heard in the air\n",
      "saying, ‘Who told him to look in the front? It is you who are to blame, for confusing\n",
      "the unreal with the real! Why then should you burn my mirror?’\n",
      "Suddenly the mirror was seen to rise up and fly out of the room, and when Dai-ru\n",
      "went outside to look, there was the lame Taoist asking for it back. He snatched it as it\n",
      "flew towards him and disappeared before Dai-ru’s very eyes.\n",
      "Seeing that there was to be no redress, Dai-yu was obliged to set about preparing for\n",
      "the funeral and began by announc?ing his grandson’s death to everybody concerned.\n",
      "Reading of the sutras began on the third day and on the seventh the coffin was\n",
      "drawn in procession to temporary lodging in the Temple of the Iron Threshold to\n",
      "await future reburial. The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to\n",
      "offer their condolences. From the Rong-guo side Jia She and Jia Zheng each gave\n",
      "twenty taels of silver and from the Ning-guo side Cousin Zhen also gave twenty taels.\n",
      "The other members of the clan gave amounts varying from one to four taels\n",
      "according to their means. A collection made among the parents of the dead man’s\n",
      "fellow-students raised an additional twenty or thirty taels. Although Dai-ru’s means\n",
      "were slender, with so much monetary help coming in he was able to perform the\n",
      "whole business in considerable style.\n",

      "Towards the end of the year in which Jia Rui’s troubles started Lin Ru-hai fell seriously\n",

      "plunged into deepest gloom by the letter, she was obliged to prepare with all\n",
      "possible expedition for her granddaughter’s departure. And Bao-yu, though he too\n",
      "was distressed at the prospect of Dai-yu’s leaving him, could scarcely seek to\n",

      "until late into the evening; then, the bedding having been well warmed, the two\n",
      "women had gone to bed, where they lay until after midnight discussing the stages of\n",

      "to me, I have come to you instead. We two have always been so close, I could not\n",

      "deep respect in her for her niece’s fore?sight.\n",
      "     ‘You are quite right to show concern,’ she said. ‘Is there any means by which we\n",
      "can keep permanently out of danger?’\n",
      "     ‘Now you are being silly, Auntie!’ said Qin-shi somewhat scornfully. ‘“The\n",
      "extreme of adversity is the beginning of prosperity” --- and the reverse of that saying\n",
      "is also true. Honour and disgrace follow each other in an unending cycle. No human\n",

      "regularly attended to,’ said Qin-shi, ‘no special income has been set aside to pay for\n",
      "them. That is the first matter. The second matter concerns the clan school. There\n",
      "again, there is no fixed source of income. Obviously there will be no lack of funds\n",
      "either for the seasonal offerings or for the school as long as we enjoy our present\n",
      "prosperity. But where is the money for them coming from in the future, when the\n",

      "farms, and houses—in the area around the burial-ground, and to pay for the seasonal\n",
      "\f",
      "offerings and the running of the school entirely out of the income from this property.\n",
      "Moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it. The whole clan, old and young\n",
      "alike, should be convened and a set of regulations drawn up whereby each family is\n",
      "made to administer the estate and look after the financing of the seasonal offerings\n",
      "and the clan school for one year in turn. By making the responsibility rotate in a fixed\n",
      "order you will remove the possibility of quarrels about it and also lessen the danger\n",

      "     ‘Then even if the clan gets into trouble and its possessions are confiscated, this\n",
      "part of its property, as charitable estate, will escape confiscation; and when the\n",
      "family’s fortunes are in decline, it will be a place where the young people can go to\n",
      "farm and study, as well as a means of maintaining the ancestral sacrifices in unbroken\n",
      "succession. To refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our\n",

      "     ‘Quite soon a happy event is going to take place in this family, bringing it an even\n",

      "his own. The news of Qin-shi’s death came to him in the midst of his dreams, causing\n",
      "him to start up in bed with a jerk. A sudden stabbing pain shot through his heart. He\n",
      "retched involuntarily and spat out a mouthful of blood. Aroma and the maids clung\n",
      "to him, terrified, and asked him what was the matter. They wanted to tell\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and ask her to send for a doctor; but Bao-yu would not hear of it.\n",

      "      Cousin Zhen was delighted, and the timber was brought over at once for\n",
      "everyone to inspect. The planks for the base and sides were at least eight inches thick.\n",
      "The wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and\n",
      "sandalwood. When rapped with the knuckles it gave off a hard, ringing sound like\n",

      "yours.’\n",

      "      By a stroke of luck the fourth day of the first seven-day period—the day on which\n",
      "official condolences were scheduled to begin --- brought a visit from Dai Quan, the\n",
      "Eunuch Cham?berlain of the Da-ming Palace. Having sent his representative along\n",
      "well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit, he presently arrived himself,\n",
      "seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the\n",

      "his mind to take advantage of the visit.\n",
      "      As soon as Dai Quan had made his offering, Cousin Zhen ushered him into the\n",
      "Honey Bee Gallery, invited him to be seated, and served him with tea. Then, entering\n",
      "into conversa?tion with his guest, he quickly found occasion to mention the fact that\n",
      "he was thinking of purchasing a place for his son Jia Rong. The eunuch guessed what\n",
      "was in his mind, and laughingly inquired whether it was not with a view to adding a\n",
      "little pomp to the funeral that he had conceived this notion.\n",
      "      ‘My dear Chamberlain,’ Cousin Zhen readily agreed, you have hit the nail on the\n",
      "head!’\n",
      "      ‘Well, by a lucky coincidence,’ said Dai Quan, ‘there is rather a good place going\n",
      "at this very moment. The Corps of Officers of the Imperial Guard, which has an\n",
      "establishment of three hundred, has got two vacancies in it. Yesterday Lord\n",
      "Xiang-yang’s younger brother “Sannikins” begged me for one of them and sent\n",

      "Yong-xing, has asked me if he can buy the remaining place for his son, but I haven’t\n",
      "yet had time to give him a reply. If our young friend here wants it, why not jot down\n",
      "his particulars and I’ll see what I can do.’\n",
      "     Cousin Zhen at once ordered someone to write out Jia Rong’s name, age and\n",
      "lineage on a sheet of red paper. The following description was hurriedly prepared and\n",
      "handed to Dai Quan for his inspection:\n",
      "\n",
      "Name: JIA RONG\n",
      "Place of Origin: (County) Kiangning; (Prefecture) Ying-tian-fu; (Province) Kiangnan.\n",

      "\f",
      "After glancing through it quickly, Dai Quan handed it into the keeping of a young\n",
      "eunuch secretary at his side.\n",
      "     ‘When we get back,’ he said to the latter, ‘give this to old Zhao, the President of\n",
      "the Board of Revenue, with my compli?ments, and ask him if he would kindly make\n",
      "out a commission for a captain in the Imperial Guard, fifth rank, and also the papers\n",
      "to go with it with these particulars filled in. Tell him I’ll call round tomorrow to pay in\n",
      "the money.’\n",
      "The young eunuch bowed, and Dai Quan rose to go. Seeing that he could no longer\n",
      "detain him, Cousin Zhen showed him out as far as the main gate. As the eunuch was\n",
      "getting into his palanquin, Cousin Zhen asked him whether he should take the money\n",

      "to your house to kotow his thanks.’\n",
      "With that they parted. But no sooner had the eunuch gone than the sound of criers\n",
      "was once more heard in the street, this time heralding the arrival of the Marchioness\n",
      "of Zhong?jing, wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, with her little niece Shi\n",

      "were now on display, and those three gentlemen were shortly to be observed\n",
      "alighting from their palanquins outside. Cousin Zhen went out to meet them and\n",
      "conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall.\n",
      "     From then on there was a continuous stream of arrivals, and throughout the\n",

      "asked him why he should still be worried now that everything had been so excellently\n",

      "    ‘That’s no problem!’ said Bao-yu encouragingly. ‘I know just the person for this.\n",
      "Put her in temporary control here for a month, and I guarantee that you will have\n",
      "nothing further to worry about.’\n",
      "    ‘Who?’ inquired Cousin Zhen eagerly.\n",
      "    Bao-yu deemed it imprudent to mention her name out loud in the hearing of so\n",
      "many friends and relations, so leaning across he whispered it in Cousin Zhen’s ear.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen’s reaction was ecstatic.\n",
      "‘Yes, absolutely the right person!’ he cried. ‘Let’s see about it straight away!’\n",
      "     And seizing Bao-yu by the hand, he excused himself to the company and hurried\n",
      "round to the reception room in his own apartment.\n",
      "It so happened that this day was not one of the seven on which masses were said, so\n",
      "visitors from outside the family were fairly few. In the inner apartments there was\n",
      "only a hand?ful of lady visitors, all of them close connections of the Jia family, whom\n",
      "Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and various female members of the clan were\n",
      "keeping company. When a servant announced ‘The Master is here’, all these females\n",
      "jumped up with little shrieks of alarm and rushed off to hide themselves—all, that is,\n",
      "except Xi-feng, who rose slowly to her feet and imperturbably stood her ground.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen had of late been feeling far from well. The debility his sickness caused\n",
      "him had been further aggravated by excessive grief and obliged him to support\n",
      "himself with a staff. Lady Xig was concerned to see the pitiflil figure he presented as\n",
      "he entered the room.\n",
      "‘You are not well,’ she said, ‘and you have been doing too much now for days. You\n",
      "ought to be getting some rest. What do you want to come in here for?’\n",
      "Clutching his staff in his hand, Cousin Zhen struggled down on to his knees, and\n",
      "having made his duty to his aunts, began thanking them for all their trouble. Lady\n",
      "Xing hurriedly ordered Bao-yu to raise him up and commanded a chair to be moved\n",
      "forward for him to sit on. But Cousin Zhen refused to be seated.\n",
      "‘I have come to ask you three ladies a favour,’ he said, forcing his woebegone\n",
      "features into a smile.\n",
      "    ‘What is it you want?’ Lady Xing asked him.\n",
      "    ‘As you doubtless know,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘my wife has been ill in bed ever since\n",
      "our daughter-in-law’s death, and with no one to run her side of the household it has\n",
      "been getting into a pretty deplorable state. I should like to ask Cousin Feng if she\n",
      "could possibly see her way to running things here for us during the coming month. It\n",
      "would be a great relief to me if she could.’\n",
      "\f",
      "      ‘So that’s what you want!’ said Lady Xing with a smile. ‘Feng is now part of your\n",
      "Aunt Wang’s establishment. You’d better talk to her about it.’\n",
      "        ‘She’s only a child yet; you know,’ Lady Wang put in hastily. ‘What experience\n",
      "has she ever had of this kind of thing? Suppose she proved not quite up to the task.\n",
      "We should all be made to look ridiculous. I think you had better trouble someone\n",
      "else.’\n",
      "      ‘I can easily guess what is in your mind, Aunt,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘You are afraid\n",
      "we should overwork her. For I assure you there is no question of her not being a good\n",
      "enough manager. Even in her childhood games, Cousin Feng had the decisiveness of a\n",
      "little general, and since she’s married and had some experience of running things\n",
      "next door, she is a thoroughly seasoned campaigner. I’ve thought the matter over\n",
      "carefully these past few days and am quite convinced that apart from Cousin Feng\n",
      "there really isn’t anyone else I can ask. If you won’t let her do this for my sake or my\n",
      "wife’s sake, at least won’t you let her for the sake of the one who has just died?’\n",
      "And at this point he burst into tears.\n",
      "Lady Wang’s only concern had been lest Xi-feng, who had had no experience of\n",
      "large-scale funerals, might find the task too big for her and perhaps end up by\n",
      "making a fool of herself. But Cousin Zhen’s moving plea caused her attitude to soften\n",
      "considerably and she eyed Xi-feng thoughtfully as though struggling to make up her\n",
      "mind. Xi-feng for her part had always loved managing things and enjoyed showing off\n",
      "her ability to do so. When Cousin Zhen first made his request, her mind had at once\n",
      "consented; and now, observing that Lady Wang appeared to be already half\n",
      "persuaded, she hastened to complete the process.\n",
      "‘Cousin Zhen has spoken su eloquently. Oughtn’t we per?haps to agree, Aunt?’\n",
      "‘Do you think you can do it?’ Lady Wang asked her in a low aside.\n",
      "‘I don’t see why not,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Cousin Zhen has already seen to all the outside\n",
      "arrangements himself. It’s only a question of looking after the domestic side for a bit.\n",
      "And even if there is anything I don’t know about, I can always ask you.’\n",
      "This seemed reasonable enough to Lady Wang, so she said nothing. Seeing that\n",
      "Xi-feng herself appeared to be willing, Cousin Zhen turned to her with a smile.\n",
      "‘Actually there isn’t so very much to do,’ he said. ‘You really must let us persuade\n",
      "you to take this on. Let me make you a reverence now, to show my gratitude. Then,\n",
      "when this is all over, I shall come round to your place to thank you properly.’\n",
      "So saying, he clasped his hands before him and made her a formal bow. Xi-feng\n",
      "hurriedly curtseyed back.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen now ordered someone to fetch the tallies for the entire Ning-guo\n",
      "household and instructed Bao-yu to hand them to Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘I want you to manage things whatever way you like,’ he told her. ‘Anything you\n",
      "\f",
      "want you can get by using one of these. There is no need to ask me for it. I have only\n",
      "two requests to make of you. First that you should dismiss from your mind any idea\n",
      "of trying to save me any money. The important thing is to put on a good show: the\n",
      "expense doesn’t matter. And secondly that you should treat our people here exactly\n",
      "as you treat the members of your own household. Don’t be afraid of upsetting them.\n",
      "Provided that you will observe those conditions, I leave everything in your hands\n",
      "with the utmost confidence.’\n",
      "Xi-feng watched Lady Wang, not daring to accept the tallies without her approval.\n",
      "‘You hear what your cousin says,’ said Lady Wang. ‘You bad better do as he asks.\n",
      "Only do not take too much upon yourself. If there are any decisions to make, be sure\n",
      "to ask Cousin Zhen or his wife first.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had already received the tallies from Cousin Zhen and now thrust them at\n",
      "Xi-feng. For politeness’ sake she feigned a certain amount of reluctance, but was\n",
      "soon prevailed upon to accept them.\n",
      "‘Will you stay here with us,’ Cousin Zhen asked her, ‘or will you be coming over\n",
      "every day from the other house? If you intend to come over from the other house\n",
      "every day, it will greatly add to your burdens. We have an apartment here with its\n",
      "own courtyard which we can very quickly place at your disposal. If you would care to\n",
      "move in for the next week or two, I am sure we could make you comfortable.’\n",
      "‘Thank you, but it won’t be necessary,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I am needed at\n",
      "the other house too, so it will be best if I come here every day.’\n",
      "Having accomplished his mission, Cousin Zhen stayed chatting a little longer and then\n",
      "left. Presently, when the visiting ladies had dispersed, Lady Wang asked Xi-feng what\n",
      "her plans were for the rest of the day.\n",
      "‘Please go on without me, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Before I go back myself I must first\n",
      "try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail.’\n",
      "Lady Wang accordingly left without more delay in the company of Lady Xing, and the\n",
      "two ladies returned to the Rong-guo mansion, where we must now leave them.\n",
      "Alone at last, Xi-feng wandered into a sort of penthouse building where she sat down\n",
      "and tried to formulate the task that lay ahead. Five major abuses, long habitual in the\n",
      "Ning-guo establishment, presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need\n",
      "of attention, viz:\n",
      "1.Because it was so large and so motley an establishment, things were always getting\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "2.Because there was no rational division of labour, it always seemed to be someone\n",
      "else’s responsibility whenever a job needed to be done.\n",
      "      3.Because the household’s expenditure was so lavish, money was always getting\n",
      "misappropriated or misspent.\n",
      "\f",
      "        4.Because no distinctions were made between one job and another, the\n",
      "rewards and hardships were unfairly distributed,\n",
      "5.Because the servants were so arrogant and undisciplined, those with face’ could\n",
      "brook no restraint and those without could win no advancement.\n",
      "If you want to know how Xi-feng dealt with these abuses, you will have to read the\n",
      "chapter which follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 14\n",
      "\n",
      "Lin Ru-hai is conveyed to his last\n",
      "resting-place in Soochow\n",
      "And Jia Bao-yu is presented to the Prince of\n",
      "Bei-jing at a roadside halt\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lai Sheng, the Chief Steward of the Ning-guo mansion, learned that Xi-feng\n",
      "had been invited to take on the manage?ment of the household, he called his cronies\n",
      "together and addressed them in the following terms:\n",
      "‘Well lads, it seems that they’ve called in Mrs Lian from the other house to run\n",
      "things here for a bit; so if she should happen to come round asking for anything or\n",
      "have occasion to talk to you about anything, be sure to do what she says, won’t you?\n",
      "During this coming month we shall all have to start work a bit earlier and knock off a\n",
      "bit later than usual. If you’ll put up with a little extra hardship just for this month, we\n",
      "can make up for it by taking things easy when it’s over. Anyway, I’m relying on you\n",
      "not to let me down. She’s well known for a sour-faced, hard-hearted bitch is this one,\n",
      "and once she’s got her back up, she’ll give no quarter, no matter who you are. So be\n",
      "careful!’\n",
      "There was a chorus of agreement from the rest. One of them did observe,\n",
      "half-jokingly, that ‘by rights they could do with someone like her to straighten things\n",
      "up a bit, consider?ing the state they had got into’. But just at that moment Brightie’s\n",
      "wife arrived on a mission from Xi-feng. She was to take receipt of some ledger-paper,\n",
      "buckram, and book-labels, and had a tally in her hand and a slip of paper specifying\n",
      "the quantities required. The men pressed round her offering her a place to sit and a\n",
      "cup of tea to drink while one of them hurried off with the list to fetch the needed\n",
      "items. Not only that, but, having fetched them, he carried them for her all the way to\n",
      "the inner gate of the mansion, only handing them to her then so that she could take\n",
      "them in to Xi-feng by herself. Xi-feng at once ordered Sunshine to make them up into\n",
      "stout workbooks for use in the office. At the same time she sent for Lai Sheng’s wife\n",
      "and asked her for the register of the household staff. She also told her to get in touch\n",
      "\f",
      "with all the married females on the staff and arrange for them to assemble first thing\n",
      "next morning to be told their new duties. Then, after roughly checking through the\n",
      "numbers in the ‘establishment’ sheet and questioning Lai Sheng’s wife on a few\n",
      "points, she got into her carriage and drove back home.\n",
      "At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion. By this time all\n",
      "the married women on the staff had been assembled. Not daring to go in, they hung\n",
      "about outside the window listening to Xi-feng discussing work-plans with Lai Sheng’s\n",
      "wife inside the office. ‘Now that I’m in charge here’, they heard her telling the latter,\n",
      "‘I won’t promise to make myself agreeable. I haven’t got a sweet temper like your\n",
      "mistress, you know. You won’t find me letting you do everything just as it suits you.\n",
      "So don’t let me hear anyone saying \"We don’t do it that way here\"! From now on,\n",
      "whatever it is, you do it the way I tell you to, and anyone who departs by as much as\n",
      "a hair’s breadth from what I say is for it good and proper, no matter how senior or\n",
      "how important she thinks she is!’\n",
      "Having delivered herself of this formidable preliminary she ordered Sunshine to call\n",
      "the roll. One by one the women stepped into the office to be looked at. When she\n",
      "had looked at them all, Xi-feng proceeded to make her dispositions.\n",
      "‘This twenty here. I want you to divide yourselves into two shifts of ten. Your job\n",
      "every day will be to look after lady visitors and serve them tea. That’s all you have to\n",
      "do. Nothing else.\n",
      "‘This twenty here. I want you divided into two shifts like the others. Your job will be\n",
      "serving tea and meals to the family. Nothing else.\n",
      "‘These forty. Again, two shifts. Your job is to look after the shrine: lighting fresh\n",
      "joss-sticks, keeping the lamps in oil, changing the drapes. You will also take turns by\n",
      "the spirit tablet, making offerings of rice and tea, kotowing when the visitors kotow,\n",
      "wailing when they wail. That is your job and nothing else besides.\n",
      "‘You four are to look after the cups and plates and so forth in the ladies’ tea-room.\n",
      "If anything is missing, you share the responsibility between you and a quarter of the\n",
      "cost will be stopped out of each of your wages.\n",
      "‘You four here are to look after the dinner-ware: bowls, wine-cups and the like.\n",
      "Anything missing will be stopped out of your wages.\n",
      "‘This eight here. I want you to take charge of all funeral offerings sent in from\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "‘This eight. I want you to look after oil, candles, and paper-offerings. I’m going to\n",
      "put the whole lot in your charge; then whenever any is needed somewhere, you\n",
      "must go to wherever it is and supply them with whatever amount I tell you to.\n",
      "‘This twenty here. I want you doing night duty by rota. You are to see that all the\n",
      "gates are locked and keep a look-out for fires. You’ll also be responsible for keeping\n",
      "\f",
      "the outside properly swept.\n",
      "‘The rest of you are to be divided up between the different apartments. Each of you\n",
      "will be responsible for the things in your own apartment, from furniture and antique\n",
      "ware down to spittoons and dusters. If the tiniest sliver gets lost or broken, you will\n",
      "be held responsible and will be expected to make it good.\n",
      "‘Lai Sheng’s wife will make a general inspection every day, and if she catches\n",
      "anyone idling or gambling or drinking or fighting or being difficult, she will at once\n",
      "bring them to me for dealing with. And there will be no favouritism. If I find you’ve\n",
      "done something wrong, I shan’t care whether you’ve been in service here for three\n",
      "or four generations, it will make no difference to me.\n",
      "‘Well, now you all know the rules. From now on whenever any trouble occurs I shall\n",
      "know exactly who to hold respon?sible.\n",
      "‘Those who are used to working with me at the other place always have a watch\n",
      "handy, and everything they do, no matter how small a thing it is, is done at a fixed\n",
      "time. You may not have watches, but at least there is a clock in your master’s\n",
      "drawing-room you can look at. So here are the main times to remember. At half past\n",
      "six I shall come over to hear the roll?call. At ten o’clock I take my lunch. I shall see\n",
      "people with reports to make or tallies to collect up to, but not after, eleven o’clock. At\n",
      "seven in the evening, as soon as the paper-offerings have been burnt, I shall make a\n",
      "personal tour of inspection; and when I get back from it, I shall issue those on night\n",

      "‘I dare say we are all going to be a bit overworked during the days ahead, but I am\n",
      "sure your master will want to reward you all for your trouble when this is over.’\n",
      "Xi-feng now proceeded to supervise the distribution of supplies of tea, oil, candles,\n",
      "feather-dusters, and brooms to some of her work-parties, and to issue others with\n",
      "table?cloths, chair-covers, cushions, mats, spittoons, footstools, and other\n",
      "furnishings, an entry of the amount supplied being made in the book as each\n",
      "consignment was handed over.\n",
      "A clear record now existed of what individuals were in charge of which parts of the\n",
      "household, what items they were responsible for, and what duties they were\n",
      "expected to per?form. Gone now were the days when everyone picked the easiest\n",
      "tasks to do first and the less popular ones never got carried out; gone the convenient\n",
      "disorder in which objects had so easily strayed (no one ever knew how) from the\n",
      "rooms where they belonged. Even with the greatly increased coming and going\n",
      "occasioned by the bereavement, it was quieter now than it had been before, when\n",
      "muddle and confusion still pre?vailed. And the old idling and pilfering appeared to\n",
      "have been eradicated completely. Secure in her authority, respected and obeyed by\n",
      "all, Xi-feng might be forgiven for contemplating her achievement with a certain\n",
      "\f",
      "amount of satisfaction.\n",
      "Meanwhile You-shi was still unwell and Cousin Zhen too crushed by his somewhat\n",
      "disproportionate grief to think much about eating and drinking. Xi-feng accordingly\n",
      "had all sorts of invalid slops for You-shi and tempting little delicacies for Cousin Zhen\n",
      "prepared in the kitchens of the Rong-guo man?sion and sent over each day to the\n",
      "prostrate couple. Cousin Zhen reciprocated by instructing his own cooks to prepare\n",
      "dishes of the very highest quality exclusively for Xi-feng and having them carried\n",
      "round to her in her little penthouse office.\n",
      "Xi-feng seemed quite tireless in the discharge of her extra duties. Every morning she\n",
      "would be over at the appointed the rollcall and would sit there alone in her office,\n",
      "never once emerging to mix with the young Ning-guo women of her own generation.\n",
      "Even when lady visitors arrived she remained in the office and took no part in their\n",
      "reception.\n",
      "The Thirty-fifth had now arrived—an important day in the penitential cycle of seven\n",
      "times seven days preceding the funeral—and the monks in the main hall had reached\n",
      "a particularly dramatic part of their ceremonies. Having opened up a way for the\n",
      "imprisoned souls, the chief celebrant had succeeded by means of spells and\n",
      "incantations in breaking open the gates of hell. He had shone his light (a little\n",
      "hand-mirror) for the souls in darkness. He had confronted Yama, the Judge of the\n",
      "Dead. He had seized the demon torturers who resisted his progress. He had invoked\n",
      "Ksitigarbha, the Saviour King, to aid him. He had raised up a golden bridge, and now,\n",
      "by means of a little flag which he held aloft in one hand, was con?ducting over it\n",
      "those souls from the very deepest pit of hell who still remained undelivered.\n",
      "Meanwhile the ninety-nine Taoists in the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion were on their\n",
      "knees offering up a written petition to the Three Pure Ones and calling on the Jade\n",
      "Emperor himself in his heavenly palace. Outside, on their high staging, with swinging\n",
      "of censers and scattering of little cakes for the hungry ghosts to feed on, Zen monks\n",
      "were performing the great Water Penitential. And in the shrine where the coffin\n",
      "stood, six young monks and six young nuns, magnificently attired in scarlet slippers\n",
      "and embroidered copes, sat before the spirit tablet quietly murmuring the dharani\n",
      "that would assist the soul of the dead woman on the most difficult part of its journey\n",
      "into the underworld. Everywhere there was a hum of activity.\n",
      "Knowing that the day would be a busy one bringing a greater than usual number of\n",
      "visitors, Xi-feng had risen at four o’clock in the morning to begin her toilet. By the\n",
      "time she had completed it, paid her daily tribute to nature, washed her hands, drunk\n",
      "a few mouthfuls of milk, and rinsed out her mouth, it was already half past six and\n",
      "Brightie’s wife, at the head of the other female domestics, had been waiting for some\n",
      "considerable time in the courtyard outside. At last she emerged and stepped into the\n",
      "\f",
      "waiting carriage. Two horn lanterns inscribed in large characters with the words\n",
      "\n",
      "RONG-GUO HOUSE\n",
      "\n",
      "were borne before her as she went.\n",
      "     The great gate of the Ning-guo mansion was hung with lanterns and there were\n",
      "rows of identical standard lanterns on each side of the gateway illuminating the\n",
      "entrance with the brightness of noonday and eerily emphasizing the whiteness of the\n",
      "mourning-clothes worn by the menservants lined up to receive the carriage. At their\n",
      "invitation it was drawn in through the centremost of the three gates. Then the\n",
      "men-servants retired and Xi-feng’s own women hurried forward and raised the\n",
      "curtain of the carriage for her to descend. She did so, leaning on the shoulder of her\n",
      "maid Felicity, and the two women with the lanterns led her in, lighting the way for\n",
      "her as they went, while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the\n",
      "Ning-guo household advanced to meet her, curtseyed, and chorused their morning\n",
      "greetings. Xi-feng walked slowly through the All-scents Garden until she came to the\n",
      "shrine in the Ascension Pavilion. As soon as she caught sight of the coffin the tears,\n",
      "like pearls from a broken necklace, rolled in great drops down her cheeks. A number\n",
      "of pages were standing stiffly in the courtyard outside awaiting the command to set\n",
      "fire to the paper offerings. Xi-feng gave orders for them to begin and for tea to be\n",
      "offered up inside the shrine. At once there was a clash of cymbals followed by the\n",
      "mournful strains of a funeral band. An arm?chair had already been called for and set\n",
      "down facing the spirit tablet. In this Xi-feng now sat, and raising her voice to a shrill\n",
      "pitch, wept with abandon, whereupon the entire house?hold, high and low, male and\n",
      "female, indoors and out, res?ponded by breaking into loud and prolonged\n",
      "lamentation.\n",
      "Presently a representative of Cousin Zhen and You-shi arrived and begged Xi-feng to\n",
      "desist. Brightie’s wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with, and\n",
      "when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more took\n",
      "leave of various members of the clan who were present, and went off to her office in\n",
      "the penthouse.\n",
      "An inspection of the roster showed that all the members of her work-parties were\n",
      "present except for one woman belong?ing to the group responsible for the reception\n",
      "of friends of the family. Someone was sent to fetch her, and presently the woman\n",
      "arrived, flustered and fearful.\n",
      "‘So it is you!’ said Xi-feng with a chilling smile. I suppose you thought that because\n",
      "you have a somewhat more lady-like job than the rest, you could afford to disobey\n",
      "my orders!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Oh no, madam, indeed not!’ said the woman. ‘I’ve been coming extra early every\n",
      "day. It’s only today, because I overslept, that I’m a bit late. Please let me off this once,\n",
      "madam! It really is the first time.’\n",
      "Just at that moment Xi-feng observed Wang Xing’s wife from the Rong-guo mansion,\n",
      "peeping round the door as if looking for a chance to speak to her.\n",
      "‘Yes, what is it?’ she asked, turning away from the offender but giving her no\n",
      "indication that she might go.\n",
      "Wang Xing’s wife approached and said that she wanted a tally authorizing the\n",
      "purchase of silk cord to be made up into carriage trimmings for the funeral. She\n",
      "handed Xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written. It specified the\n",
      "number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans, four\n",
      "small sedans, and four carriages, and the number of pounds of silk cord that would\n",
      "be required for that amount of network. Xi-feng made Sunshine read it out to her,\n",
      "and having satisfied herself that the figures were correct, told him to enter them in\n",
      "his book and to issue Wang Xing’s wife with one of the Rong-guo tallies, whereupon\n",
      "the latter hurried off to complete her mission.\n",
      "Xi-feng was about to address the latecomer when four more servants from the\n",
      "Rong-guo mansion came in asking for tallies. She told them to hand over the\n",
      "order-slips and made Sunshine read them out to her. Two of them contained errors,\n",
      "and Xi-feng flung them down and told the bearers to ‘go away and come back when\n",
      "they had got their figures right’. The two of them went off crestfallen.\n",
      "     Xi-feng next observed Zhang Cai’s wife hovering about at the edge of the room\n",
      "and asked her what she wanted.\n",
      "‘It’s those carriage curtains, ma’am. We want the money for the tailor who made\n",
      "them up.’ Xi-feng took the bill and told Sunshine to enter the figures from it in his\n",
      "book. But she would not authorize Zhang Cai’s wife to pay for the tailoring until\n",
      "Wang Xing’s wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer’s receipt.\n",
      "There was a second piece of paper which Sunshine now read, requesting permission\n",
      "to purchase paper for the windows of Bao-yu’s outer study, which had just been\n",
      "redecorated. This too Xi-feng kept, and made Sunshine enter the amount in his book.\n",
      "She told Zhang Cai’s wife that the goods must be supplied first before any payment\n",
      "could be authorized.\n",
      "‘Tomorrow another one will be late and the day after that it will be someone else,’\n",
      "said Xi-feng turning to the still waiting offender, ‘and before we know where we are\n",
      "we shall have no one turning up at all. I should have liked to let you off, but if I’m\n",
      "lenient with you the first time, it will be that much harder for me to deal with\n",
      "someone else the second time; so I am obliged to make an example of you.’ Her face\n",
      "hardened as she pronounced sentence: ‘Take her out and give her twenty strokes of\n",
      "\f",
      "the bamboo!’\n",
      "Seeing that Xi-feng was really angry, the servants dared not show themselves slack in\n",
      "executing her command. The wretched woman was half-dragged from the room and\n",
      "the flogging administered in full view of the waiting throng, after which they came in\n",
      "again, the executioners to report that they had discharged their duty and their victim\n",
      "to thank Xi-feng for her punishment. Xi-feng threw down one of the Ning-guo tallies.\n",
      "‘Take this to Lai Sheng and tell him to stop a month’s pay from her wages. If anyone\n",
      "is late tomorrow they will get forty strokes and the day after that it will be sixty. So if\n",
      "you enjoy being beaten you have only to come late for roll-call. Dismiss.’\n",
      "The servants, including the shamefaced and silently weeping victim, trooped off to\n",
      "their various duties.\n",
      "Now began a steady stream of servants from both house?holds collecting and\n",
      "returning tallies, each of whom Xi-feng attended to in a brisk and efficient manner.\n",
      "From that day onwards the staff of the Ning-guo mansion realized just how\n",
      "formidable Xi-feng could be and went about their duties in fear and trembling, not\n",
      "daring to idle or delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "    But let us now turn to Bao-yu. On this particular occasion, fearing that with so\n",
      "great an influx of visitors Qin Zhong might find himself somewhat overwhelmed,\n",
      "Bao-yu brought him round to Xi-feng’s office for a quiet chat.\n",
      "‘Did you smell the food?’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. (She was halfway through her\n",
      "lunch when they entered.) ‘Come up on the kang and have some!’\n",
      "‘Thank you, but we have already eaten,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Here, or in the other house?’\n",
      "‘Catch me eating here with those clowns!’ said Bao-yu. ‘No, back at home, with\n",
      "Grandmother.’\n",
      "He and Qin Zhong sat down, and presently Xi-feng finished her lunch. Just then a\n",
      "woman came in asking for a tally with which to obtain a fresh supply of oil for the\n",
      "altar lamps.\n",
      "‘I calculated that you would be needing some by now,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I\n",
      "thought you must have forgotten. If you had forgotten, you’d have had to pay for it\n",
      "yourself. That would have suited me down to the ground!’\n",
      "‘Oh no, madam! As you say, I just forgot. I only thought of it a moment ago, and I\n",
      "realized that if I didn’t hurry I should be too late to get a tally.’\n",
      "So saying, she took her tally and went. For a short while longer the handing over of\n",
      "tallies and registering of amounts continued.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Both your houses use these tallies for everything,’ said Qin Zhong, who had been\n",
      "watching these transactions with some interest. ‘Suppose some outsider were to\n",
      "forge one and use it to get a lot of money with?’\n",
      "‘Not everyone is as crooked as you are!’ said Xi-feng good? humouredly.\n",
      "‘How is it that there is no one from our place coming in for tallies?’ Bao-yu asked.\n",
      "‘At the time when they come,’ Xi-feng replied, ‘you are still fast asleep in bed. Now\n",
      "let me ask you something. When are you going to begin studying at night?’\n",
      "‘I should like nothing better than to begin today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But what can I do if\n",
      "they won’t get on with my study?’\n",
      "If you were to ask me nicely,’ said Xi-feng jovially, ‘I think I could undertake to hurry\n",
      "them up for you.’\n",
      "‘Oh, you’re no good,’ said Bao-yu, ‘no more than any of the rest. They’ll get round\n",
      "to it in time. It’s just a question of waiting till they do.’\n",
      "‘Whether they get round to it or not,’ said Xi-feng, ‘they still need materials for the\n",
      "job, and they can’t get the materials if I don’t choose to give them the tallies—I can\n",
      "tell you that for sure!’\n",
      "As soon as he heard this, Bao-yu twined himself round Xi-feng and began coaxing and\n",
      "wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work\n",
      "on his study.\n",
      "‘Stop it! Stop it! ‘ cried Xi-feng. ‘I am so tired that my bones ache. How can I stand\n",
      "up to being mauled about by a great-ape like you? You needn’t worry. They’ve just\n",
      "been round to see about paper for the windows. It would look pretty stupid if you\n",
      "were to send them off for something they have already got.’\n",
      "Bao-yu refused to believe her until she made Sunshine look up the entry in his book\n",
      "and show it to him.\n",
      "While Bao-yu was inspecting the book, a servant announced the arrival of Shiner, one\n",
      "of the boys who had accompanied Jia Lian to Yangchow. Xi-feng eagerly ordered him\n",
      "in. Shiner louted to his mistress in the Manchu fashion and hoped that she was well.\n",
      "‘Why have you come back?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘The Master sent me, ma’am. Mr. Lin died on the third at ten in the morning and\n",
      "the Master and Miss Lin are taking him to Soochow to be buried. They expect to be\n",
      "home by the end of the spring. The Master told me to bring back the news and to\n",
      "give everyone his regards, and he said I was to ask Her Old Ladyship for instructions.\n",
      "He also told me to see if you were getting on all right, ma’am; and he said would I\n",
      "take some fur-?lined gowns back with me for winter wear.’\n",
      "‘Have you seen anyone else yet?’ Xi-feng asked him.\n",
      "‘Yes, everyone,’ said Shiner, and withdrew.\n",
      "Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu with a smile:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘It looks now as if your Cousin Lin will be staying with us permanently.’\n",
      "‘Poor thing!’ said Bao-yu. ‘How she must have cried and cried during this past week\n",
      "or so!’ The thought of her crying made him knit his brows and sigh.\n",
      "Now that Shiner was back, Xi-feng was all agog to question him about Jia Lian but\n",
      "could not do so in any detail in front of the others. She would have liked to follow\n",
      "him back home, but her duties were by no means over, and she was obliged to hold\n",
      "out until evening. Then, back in her own apartment, she summoned him to her and\n",
      "asked him for full particulars of the journey. She looked out all Jia Lian’s furs, and she\n",
      "and Patience sat up into the night getting them ready and packing them ---together\n",
      "with anything else which careful thought suggested might be needed—for Shiner to\n",
      "take back with him to his Master. Xi-feng gave Shiner minute instructions concerning\n",
      "his conduct towards the latter:\n",
      "‘Mind you look after your master properly away from home, now. Try not to make\n",
      "him angry. And do always be on at him not to drink too much. And don’t encourage\n",
      "him to get mixed up with bad women. If, when you get back, I find out that you have\n",
      "done, I’ll break your legs!’\n",
      "Shiner laughingly agreed to abide by all her instructions. By the time they got to bed\n",
      "it was well past one in the morning. To Xi-feng it seemed as though she had barely\n",
      "lain down to sleep when it was dawn once more and time to get up again and wash\n",
      "and dress for another round of duties at Ning-guo House.\n",
      "The day of the funeral was now approaching and Cousin Zhen took an expert in\n",
      "geomancy with him in his carriage and drove out to the Temple of the Iron Threshold\n",
      "to inspect the terrain and personally assist in the selection of a suitable\n",
      "rest?ing-place for Qin-shi’s coffin. He gave detailed instructions to the\n",
      "monk-in-charge, Father Sublimitas, for the provision of a completely new set of\n",
      "hangings and altar furnishings for the funeral, and for the engagement of as many\n",
      "fashionable monks as he could think of to participate in the ceremony of receiving\n",
      "the coffin.\n",
      "Sublimitas hurriedly prepared a vegetarian supper for his visitors; but Cousin Zhen\n",
      "had little heart for eating, and, as it was by now too late to return to the city,\n",
      "presently retired to a bed that had been made up for him in the monk’s quarters,\n",
      "leaving first thing next morning in order to press on with arrangements for the\n",
      "funeral. On his return he sent some work?men out to the temple to refurbish the\n",
      "place he had chosen for the coffin. They were instructed to work on the job\n",
      "through?out the night in order to make sure that it was finished in time. He also sent\n",
      "out a number of kitchen staff to cater for the funeral party on its arrival.\n",
      "Xi-feng, too, began to make her own careful preparations as the day of the funeral\n",
      "drew near. On the one hand she had to select coachmen and bearers from the\n",
      "\f",
      "Rong-guo staff for the carriages and sedans that Lady Wang and the other Rong-guo\n",

      "Ying-chun fell ill and needed doctors’ visits and medicines every day, it was Xi-feng\n",

      "Indeed, so multifarious had her activities become that it would be impossible to list\n",
      "them all. As a consequence she was far too busy to pay much attention to eating and\n",

      "to succeed and a dread of being criticized enabled her to summon up reserves of\n",
      "energy, and she managed to plan everything with such exemplary thoroughness that\n",
      "every member of the clan was loud in her praises.\n",
      "Wake night arrived—the night when no one in the family may go to bed—and\n",
      "Ning-guo House was crowded with friends and relations. Since You-shi was still\n",
      "confined to her room, it was left entirely to Xi-feng to do the honours. There were, to\n",
      "be sure, a number of other young married women in the clan, but all were either\n",
      "tongue-tied or giddy, or they were so petrified by bashfulness or timidity that the\n",
      "presence of strangers or persons of higher rank threw them into a state of panic.\n",
      "Xi-feng’s vivacious charm and social assurance stood out in striking contrast—‘a\n",
      "touch of scarlet in a field of green’. She was in her element, and if she took any notice\n",
      "at all of her humbler sisters it was only to throw out an occasional order or to bend\n",
      "them in some other way to her imperious will.\n",
      "Throughout the whole of that night the Ning-guo mansion was ablaze with lights.\n",

      "hurrying forward with his Uncles Jia She and Jia Zheng, saluted the prince with full\n",

      "while this official performed them, then returned to the palanquin and bowed their\n",
      "thanks to the prince. The prince received their thanks with a most becoming modesty\n",

      "not bring him to see me?’\n",
      "Jia Zheng at once withdrew to fetch Bao-yu. He made him first change into court\n",
      "dress before, leading him forward to meet the prince.\n",
      "Bao-yu had often heard about the Prince of Bei-jing. He had heard that he was very\n",

      "a quite jolly, un?conventional sort of person who refused to let either his royal birth\n",
      "or the conventions of official life constrain him. He had often wanted to meet him,\n",
      "but had been deterred by his father’s strictness from doing so. And now here was the\n",
      "Prince of Bei-jing asking to see him! A feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he\n",
      "hurried forward with his father. He peeped up at the prince as they advanced and\n",
      "saw that he was, as report had painted him, an extremely good-looking young man.\n",

      "of rainbow-coloured stripes and gold-emblazoned with the royal five-clawed dragon,\n",

      "with green jade. The splendid costume, the luminous eyes, the finely chiselled\n",
      "features really did make him an arrestingly handsome young man. Bao-yu started\n",
      "forward impulsively to make his salutation, but the prince extended an arm from the\n",

      "     The prince pronounced the stone a great wonder and with his own hands\n",
      "refastened its plaited silken cord round Bao-yu’s neck. Then, taking one of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "hands in his own, he asked him how old he was, what books he was studying, and\n",
      "other such questions, to all of which Bao-yu gave prompt replies.\n",
      "     Delighted that everything Bao-yu said was so clear and to the point, the prince\n",

      "the transport provided. The upshot was that those of Jia She’s generation got into\n",

      "horseback.\n",
      "Xi-feng was worried about Bao-yu. Out in the country, she thought, he was liable to\n",

      "one of her pages to summon him, and presently he rode up to her carriage.\n",
      "‘Bao dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘a person of your refinement belongs here with us. You\n",

      "horrid men! Why not get in with me? The two of us will keep each other company.’\n",

      "wished to get out and ‘stretch her legs’. Xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask Lady Xing\n",
      "and Lady Wang for instructions. The latter sent back word that they had no desire to\n",
      "stop, themselves, but that Xi-feng was wel?come to do so if she wished. Xi-feng\n",
      "accordingly gave orders for a short halt. At once the pages led the horses out of the\n",
      "main stream of traffic and headed northwards down a small side-road.\n",
      "Bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetch Qin Zhong, who was riding along behind\n",

      "for a little refreshment, he turned round and saw Bao-yu’s horse in the distance,\n",
      "jogging along in a northerly direction with an empty saddle on its back behind\n",

      "\n",
      "Apart from the barns and outhouses, the farmhouse con?sisted of little more than a\n",
      "\f",
      "single large room, so that there was nowhere the farmer’s womenfolk could go to be\n",
      "out of the way of the visitors. The sudden appearance in their midst of Xi-feng,\n",
      "Bao-yu and Qin Zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed\n",
      "to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one.\n",
      "As soon as they were inside the thatched central building, Xi-feng asked the boys to\n",
      "amuse themselves outside. Bao-yu realized that she needed to be alone, and\n",
      "conducted Qin Zhong and the pages on a tour of the farmyard. He had never in his\n",
      "life seen any of the farming implements before, and was very curious. One of his\n",
      "pages who had some experience of country matters was able to name each\n",
      "implement for him and explain its functions. Bao-yu was impressed.\n",
      "‘Now I can understand the words of the old poet,’ he said:\n",

      "‘Each grain of rice we ever ate\n",
      "Cost someone else a drop of sweat.’\n",

      "Bao-yu at once got up on the kang and had just started to turn it when a country lass\n",
      "of seventeen or eighteen summers came running up:\n",
      "‘Don’t! You’ll spoil it!’\n",
      "She was shouted at fiercely by the pages, but Bao-yu had already stayed his hand.\n",
      "‘I’m sorry. I’ve never seen one before. I was just turning it for fun, to see how it\n",
      "works.’\n",
      "‘You don’t know how to turn it properly,’ said the girl. Let me show you how ‘tis\n",
      "done.’\n",

      "‘A comely damosel, thinkest thou nottest?’\n",
      "‘Shut up, or I’ll clout you!’ said Bao-yu, pushing him.\n",
      "During this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning. She did, indeed, make a\n",
      "charming picture as she bent over her work. Suddenly an old woman’s voice called\n",
      "out from the other side of the yard:\n",
      "‘Ertie! Come here at once my gal.’\n",
      "The girl jumped up from her spinning and hurried over. Bao-yu’s spirits were quite\n",
      "dashed by her abrupt departure.\n",
      "But just then someone came from Xi-feng inviting the boys indoors. They found her\n",
      "washed and changed. She asked them if they wanted to ‘change’ too, but Bao-yu\n",
      "replied that they did not. Then a variety of cakes and sweets were brought in by the\n",
      "\f",
      "servants, and fragrant tea was poured for them to drink. When the three had taken\n",
      "their fill of these refreshments and everything had been cleared away and re?packed\n",
      "by the servants, they rose up and got back into their carriage.\n",
      "Outside in the yard Brightie handed the farmer’s family their payment, which he had\n",
      "brought with him ready-wrapped in coloured paper, and the womenfolk hurried up\n",
      "to the carriage to express their thanks. Bao-yu scanned their faces carefully, but could\n",
      "not see his spinning-girl amongst them. They had not driven far, however, when he\n",
      "caught sight of her at the end of the village. She was standing watching for him\n",
      "beside the road, a baby brother in her arms and two little girls at her side. Bao-yu\n",
      "could not repress a strong emotion on seeing her, but sitting there in the carriage\n",
      "there was not much he could do but gaze back at her soulfully; and soon, as the\n",
      "carriage bowled along at a smarter pace, Ertie was lost to sight for ever.\n",
      "With talk and laughter to beguile them, the journey passed quickly. Soon they had\n",
      "caught up with the main procession; soon the sound of drums and cymbals was\n",
      "heard and they could see ahead of them the banners and umbrellas of the monks\n",
      "from the Temple of the Iron Threshold who had come out in procession and lined\n",
      "either side of the road to welcome them; and soon they were inside the temple,\n",
      "where further ceremonies awaited them, a new staging having been erected for this\n",
      "purpose. The coffin was installed in one of the side-chapels leading off the inner hall,\n",
      "and Jewel arranged her sleeping-quarters near by to continue her watch over it.\n",
      "In the outer hall Cousin Zhen was busy attending to his guests, some of whom were\n",
      "staying on, while others wished to leave immediately. To each he tendered formal\n",
      "thanks for their trouble in coming. They left in order of seniority; duke’s kin going\n",
      "first, then those of marquises, then those of earls, then those of viscounts, then\n",
      "those of barons, and so on down?wards. It was three o’clock by the time the last of\n",
      "them had gone.\n",
      "Xi-feng received the lady guests inside. They, too, left in order of precedence and had\n",
      "not finally dispersed until around two o’clock. Only members of the clan and a few\n",
      "very close friends stayed behind to see the ceremonies through to their conclusion\n",
      "two days later.\n",
      "Lady Xing and Lady Wang were among those who left. They could see that Xi-feng\n",
      "would be unable to return that day and wanted to take Bao-yu back with them into\n",
      "town. But Bao-yu, after his first taste of the countryside, was extremely loth to return\n",
      "and begged to stay with Xi-feng; so Lady Wang went without him, leaving him in\n",
      "Xi-feng’s charge.\n",
      "The Temple of the Iron Threshold was a private foundation of the Dukes of Ning-guo\n",
      "and Rong-guo which still had some land of its own in which members of the clan who\n",
      "died in the capital could be given temporary burial. The thoughtful Dukes had\n",
      "\f",
      "provided accommodation not only for the dead but also for the living, in the form of\n",
      "guest-rooms in which mourners might temporarily reside until their funereal\n",
      "busi?ness was over What the old gentlemen had not foreseen was that their\n",
      "multitudinous progeny would come in time to exhibit differences of wealth and\n",
      "temperament so extreme as often to render their possessors mutually intolerable\n",
      "and that, whereas the more hard-up members of the clan gladly occupied the\n",
      "accommodation provided, the more affluent or preten?tious found it ‘inconvenient’\n",
      "to stay there and preferred to seek alternative accommodation in the farmsteads and\n",
      "convents round about.\n",
      "Xi-feng was among those who found the Iron Threshold accommodation\n",
      "‘inconvenient’. Some time previously she had sent someone to Wheat-cake Priory to\n",
      "make arrangements on her behalf with the prioress Euergesia, and the old nun had\n",
      "turned out several rooms in readiness for her arrival. ‘Wheat-cake Priory’ (so-called\n",
      "because of the excellent steamed wheat bread made in its kitchens) was the popular\n",
      "name for Water-moon Priory, an offshoot of Water-moon Abbey situated at no great\n",
      "distance from the Temple of the Iron Threshold.\n",
      "Presently, when the monks had finished their service and the evening offering of tea\n",
      "had been made, Cousin Zhen sent Jia Rong in to Xi-feng with a message inviting her\n",
      "to retire. Having first glanced round to ascertain that a sufficient number of Jia ladies\n",
      "were present to look after the still remaining guests, Xi-feng bade the company good\n",
      "night and left for Wheat-cake Priory with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had\n",
      "attached himself to the other two when his father Qin Bang-ye, unable by reason of\n",
      "his age and frail state of health to risk a night away from home, had gone back to the\n",
      "city, leav?ing him to await the conclusion of the requiem services on his own.\n",
      "They soon arrived at the priory and were met by Euergesia, who had brought her two\n",
      "little disciples Benevolentia and Sapientia to welcome them. As soon as the first\n",
      "greetings were over, Xi-feng retired to her room to wash and change. Emerg?ing\n",
      "refreshed, she observed how much taller Sapientia had grown and how radiantly\n",
      "good-looking, and inquired of Euergesia why she and her two charges had lately not\n",
      "been into town to see them.\n",
      "‘It is on account of Mr. Hu’s good lady,’ said the old nun. ‘She has lately been\n",
      "brought to bed of a boy, and sent us ten taels of silver for a three-day recital of the\n",
      "Lake of Blood sutra by some of the sisters to purge the stain of childbirth. We have\n",
      "been so busy with the arrangements that we haven’t had time to call.’\n",
      "Let us leave Xi-feng in conversation with the prioress and turn to the other two.\n",
      "Qin Zhong and Bao-yu were amusing themselves in the main hall of the priory when\n",
      "Sapientia happened to pass through.\n",
      "‘Here’s Sappy,’ said Bao-yu with a meaningful smile.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Well, what about it?’ said Qin Zhong.\n",
      "‘Now, now, stop play-acting!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I saw you holding her that day at\n",
      "Grandma’s when you thought nobody else was about. You needn’t think you can fool\n",
      "me after that!’\n",
      "‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’\n",
      "‘All right then. Never mind whether you know what I’m talking about or not. Just\n",
      "ask her to pour me out a cup of tea, will you, and then we’ll let the subject drop.’\n",
      "‘What sort of joke is this? Why can’t you ask her yourself? She’d pour it out just the\n",
      "same for you. Why ask me to tell her?’\n",
      "‘I couldn’t do it with the same feeling as you. There’ll be much more feeling in it if\n",
      "you ask her.’\n",
      "He finally prevailed upon Qin Zhong to make the request.\n",
      "‘Oh, all right! - Sappy, pour us a cup of tea, will you?’\n",
      "Sapientia had been a regular visitor at the Rong-guo mansion ever since she was a\n",
      "little girl and was familiar with all its inmates. The innocence of her childish rompings\n",
      "with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong had latterly, however—now that she had reached\n",
      "adolescence—given way to a more mature emotion. She had fallen in love with Qin\n",
      "Zhong, whose every feature and lineament now inspired her with romantic feelings;\n",
      "and Qin Zhong, captivated by her developing charms, had responded by loving her\n",
      "back. Although nothing serious had as yet passed between them, in their inclinations\n",
      "and affections they were already united.\n",
      "Sapientia hurried out and returned with a cup of tea.\n",
      "‘Give it to me, Sappy!’ said Qin Zhong.\n",
      "‘No, give it to me, Sappy I’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "She stood between them, pouting prettily, and gave a little laugh:\n",
      "‘Surely you’re not going to fight over a cup of tea? I must have honey on my hands\n",
      "I’\n",
      "Bao-yu snatched the cup before Qin Zhong could do so and began drinking. He was\n",
      "about to say something when Benevo?lentia came in and fetched Sapientia away to\n",
      "help her lay the table. She was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and\n",
      "cakes; but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts, and after\n",
      "sitting a short while for the sake of politeness, were soon off to amuse themselves\n",
      "else?where.\n",
      "Xi-feng, too, soon left, and retired to her private room to rest, Euergesia\n",
      "accompanying her. By this time the older servants, seeing that there was nothing\n",
      "further for them to do, had one by one drifted off to bed, leaving only a few personal\n",
      "maids, all of whom were in Xi-feng’s confidence, in attend?ance. The old nun\n",
      "deemed it safe to broach a private matter in their hearing.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There is something I have been meaning to call at your house and ask Her Ladyship\n",
      "about, but I should like to have your opinion on it first before I see her.’\n",
      "‘What do you want to ask her?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Bless his Holy Name!’ the prioress began piously. ‘When I was a nun at the\n",
      "Treasures in Heaven Convent in Chang-an, one of the convent’s benefactors was a\n",
      "very wealthy man called Zhang, who had a daughter called Jin-ge. A certain young Mr.\n",
      "Li, who is brother-in-law to the Governor of Chang-an, met her once when she was\n",
      "making an incense? offering in our temple and took a violent liking to her. He at once\n",
      "sent someone to the parents to ask for her hand in marriage, but unfortunately she\n",
      "was already betrothed to the son of a captain in the Chang-an garrison and the\n",
      "betrothal-presents had already been accepted. The Zhangs would have liked to\n",
      "cancel the betrothal but were afraid that the captain would object, so they told Li’s\n",
      "matchmaker that the girl was already engaged. But oh dear! young Mr. Li wouldn’t\n",
      "take no for an answer, and the Zhangs were quite at their wit’s end, being now in\n",
      "trouble with both parties. You see, when the captain got to hear of these goings-on\n",
      "he was most unreason?able. He came rushing along in a great rage and made a most\n",
      "terrible scene. ‘Just how many young men is this girl be?trothed to?” he said, and so\n",
      "on and so forth. He refused out?fight to take back the betrothal-gifts and straightway\n",
      "began an action for breach of promise. By now the Zhangs were really upset and sent\n",
      "to the capital for some moral support -- for they are now quite determined to break\n",
      "off their daughter’s en?gagement, seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable.\n",
      "‘Well, it occurred to me that the Area Commander for Chang-an, General Yun, is on\n",
      "very good terms with your husband’s family, and I thought I might try to find some\n",
      "way of persuading Her Ladyship to talk to Sir Zheng about this and get him to write a\n",
      "letter to General Yun and ask him to have a word with this captain. It is hardly likely\n",
      "that he would refuse to obey his commanding officer. The Zhangs would gladly pay\n",
      "anything—even if it meant bankrupting themselves ---in return for this kindness.’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘It doesn’t sound very difficult. The only difficulty is that Lady Wang doesn’t touch\n",
      "this kind of thing any more.’\n",
      "‘If Her Ladyship won’t, what about you, Mrs Lian?’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed again.\n",
      "‘I’m not short of money; and besides, I don’t touch that sort of thing either.’\n",
      "Euergesia’s face assumed an expression of great benignity. After sitting for a while in\n",
      "silence she sighed.\n",
      "‘It’s a pity I let the Zhangs know that I was going to talk to you about this,’ she said.\n",
      "‘Now if you don’t do this favour for them, they will never believe that it is because\n",
      "you haven’t the time or don’t want the money; they will take it as a sign that you are\n",
      "\f",
      "not able.’\n",
      "This put Xi-feng on her mettle.\n",
      "‘You’ve known me a long time,’ she said. ‘You know that I’ve never believed all that\n",
      "talk about hell and damnation. If I decide that I want to do something I do it, no\n",
      "matter what it is. Tell them that if they are prepared to pay out three thousand taels\n",
      "of silver, I will undertake to relieve them of their trouble.’\n",
      "The prioress was delighted.\n",
      "‘They will! They will! No doubt about it!’\n",
      "‘Mind you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’m not one of your money-grubbing run-of-the-mill\n",
      "go-betweens. I’m not doing this for the money. Every bit of this three thousand taels\n",
      "will go into the pockets of my boys or towards their expenses. I shan’t touch a penny\n",
      "of it. If it was money I wanted, I could lay my hands on thirty thousand taels at this\n",
      "very moment.’\n",
      "‘Well, that’s nicely settled!’ said the prioress. ‘So can we lo6k forward to your kind\n",
      "help in this matter tomorrow? We may as well get it over and done with.’\n",
      "‘You can see how busy I am and how impossible it is for me to get away,’ said\n",
      "Xi-feng. ‘I’ve told you I’ll do it, and so I will -- in my own time. Surely that is enough\n",
      "for you?’\n",
      "‘A little thing like this might seem a great deal of trouble to some people;’ said the\n",
      "old nun artfully, ‘but even if it involved more than it does, it would still be nothing to\n",
      "a capable person like you, Mrs Lian. You know what they say: “The able man gets\n",
      "little leisure” that’s why Her Ladyship leaves everything to you. She knows how\n",
      "capable you are. Of course, you have to be careful that you don’t overtax yourself.\n",
      "Your health is precious!’\n",
      "Soothed by such flatteries, Xi-feng forgot her weariness, and the conversation\n",
      "continued with animation.\n",
      "Meanwhile Qin Zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that there\n",
      "was no one much about to prosecute his designs on Sapientia. He found her on her\n",
      "own in one of the rooms at the back of the priory washing up tea-things. Throwing\n",
      "his arms around her from behind, he gave her a kiss. Sapientia stamped with\n",
      "vexation:\n",
      "‘What are you doing? Stop it!’\n",
      "She was about to call out, but Qin Zhong spoke entreat?ingly:\n",
      "‘Darling Sappy! I want you so desperately! If you won’t let me, I’ll just lie down and\n",
      "die!’\n",
      "‘If you want me,’ said Sapientia, ‘you must first get me out of this hole and away\n",
      "from these people. Then you can do what you like.’\n",
      "‘That’s easy,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘But “distant water is no cure for a present thirst” ...’\n",
      "\f",
      "And with that he blew out the light, plunging the room into inky darkness, and\n",
      "carried Sapientia on to the kang. She struggled hard to get up—though still not\n",
      "daring to call out; but soon, almost before she knew it, her breech-clout was off and\n",
      "the ship was in the harbour.\n",
      "Suddenly, in less time than it takes to tell, a third person bore down on them from\n",
      "above and held them fast. The intruder made no sound, and for some moments the\n",
      "other two lay underneath his weight, half dead with fright. Then there was a splutter\n",
      "of suppressed laughter and they knew that it was Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ said Qin Zhong crossly, as he scrambled to\n",
      "his feet.\n",
      "‘If you won’t let me, darling,’ Bao-yu mimicked, ‘I’ll call Out!’\n",
      "Poor Sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark.\n",
      "Bao-yu hauled Qin Zhong from the room.\n",
      "‘Now,’ he said: ‘are you still going to pretend that Sappy means nothing to you?’\n",
      "‘Look, be a good chap! I’ll do anything you say as long as you promise not to shout.’\n",
      "‘We won’t say any more about it just now,’ said Bao-yu genially. ‘Wait until we are\n",
      "both in bed and I’ll settle accounts with you then.’\n",
      "Bedtime soon came and they partially undressed and settled down for the night,\n",
      "Xi-feng in an inner room and Bao-yu and Qin Zhong in an outer room adjoining it. As\n",
      "there were numerous old women on night duty lying about everywhere on the floor\n",
      "wrapped up in their bedding, Xi-feng was afraid that the ‘Magic Jade’ might\n",
      "disappear in the course of the night; so as soon as Bao-yu was in bed she sent\n",
      "someone to fetch it from him, and put it under her own pillow for safety.\n",
      "As for the ‘settling of accounts’ that Bao-yu had proposed to Qin Zhong, we have\n",
      "been unable to ascertain exactly what form this took; and as we would not for the\n",
      "world be guilty of a fabrication, we must allow the matter to remain a mystery.\n",
      "Next day someone arrived from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to see how Bao-yu\n",
      "was getting on. He was coun?selled to dress up well against the cold and to come\n",
      "back home if there was nothing further to do. Bao-yu was most unwilling to return\n",
      "on his own account, and his unwillingness was re?inforced by the promptings of Qin\n",
      "Zhong, who was anxious to see more of Sapientia and urged him to ask Xi-feng for\n",
      "another day.\n",
      "Xi-feng reflected a little. The main business of the funeral was now over, but a\n",
      "sufficient number of minor matters still remained to be done to justify their staying\n",
      "on another day if they wanted to. Three arguments in favour of staying presented\n",
      "themselves to her mind:\n",
      "1.It would be a gesture of considerateness to Cousin Zhen which would increase his\n",
      "indebtedness to her.\n",
      "\f",
      "     2.It would give her a breathing-space in which to get Euergesia’s business\n",
      "attended to.\n",
      "3.It would make Bao-yu happy, which would put her in good odour with\n",
      "Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "Having now made her mind up, Xi-feng acceded to Bao-yu’s request in the following\n",
      "terms:\n",
      "‘My own business here is all finished now, but if you want to amuse yourselves a bit\n",
      "longer, I suppose I must resign myself to staying. However, we definitely must go back\n",
      "tomorrow.’\n",
      "When Bao-yu heard this it was all ‘dearest Feng’ this and ‘darling Feng’ that, and he\n",
      "promised faithfully to return on the morrow without demur. Accordingly it was\n",
      "settled that they should stay for one more night.\n",
      "Xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain Euergesia’s business to\n",
      "Brightie. Brightie grasped the situation at once, hurried into town, sought out a\n",
      "public letter-writer, had a letter written in Jia Lian’s name to the captain’s\n",
      "commanding officer, and set off for Chang-an over?night bearing the spurious\n",
      "missive with him.\n",
      "     Chang-an is only thirty or 50 miles from the capital, so that Brightie could finish\n",
      "his business and be back again within a couple of days. The general’s name was Yun\n",
      "Guang. He was indebted to the Jia family for a number of past kindnesses and was\n",
      "only too ‘pleased to be of service to them in a matter of such trifling importance. He\n",
      "said as much in the letter of reply which he gave Brightie to carry back with him. But\n",
      "that part of his mission is omitted from our story.\n",
      "When their second day at the priory was over, Xi-feng and the boys took leave of\n",
      "Euergesia, and as she said good-bye, Xi-feng told the prioress to call at the Rong-guo\n",
      "mansion m two days’ time to hear the news from Chang-an.\n",
      "This parting was an unbearably painful one for Sapientia and Qin Zhong, and all sorts\n",
      "of secret vows were exchanged and whispered contracts made before they could tear\n",
      "them?selves apart. We omit all details of that harrowing scene.\n",
      "Xi-feng called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on the way back to see that\n",
      "everything was in order. jewel, it seemed, refused absolutely to go back home, and\n",

      "indulgence in secret frolic with Sapientia had resulted on his return in a cough and\n",
      "chill accompanied by total loss of appetite. Altogether he presented so sorry a\n",
      "spectacle that study was quite out of the question and they were obliged to send him\n",
      "back home to bed. Although Bao-yu was very dis?appointed, there was nothing at all\n",
      "he could do but wait for his friend to get better.\n",
      "Xi-feng had now received Yun Guang’s reply to the bogus letter, expressing his\n",

      "they caused a table with burning incense (which would be required for the reading of\n",
      "the Proclamation, if there was one) to beset down in its place. Then, throwing open\n",
      "the centre of the three main gates, they knelt down in the entrance of the mansion\n",
      "to receive their visitor.\n",
      "Soon Xia Bing-zhong, the Eunuch Master of the Bedchamber, arrived on horseback\n",
      "with a retinue of eunuchs at his back. He appeared to have no Imperial Proclamation\n",
      "or other document on his person, for instead of dismounting, as etiquette prescribed\n",
      "that he should if he was carrying a Written Instrument, he rode straight on to the\n",
      "foot of the main hall. There, with beaming countenance, he got down from his horse,\n",
      "climbed the steps, faced south and gave utterance to the following announcement:\n",
      "‘By order of His Imperial Majesty:\n",
      "Jia Zheng is commanded to present himself at court im?mediately for private\n",
      "audience with His Imperial Majesty in the Hall of Reverence.’\n",
      "Having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for\n",
      "so much as a cup of tea and rode away. Still no wiser, Jia Zheng hurried into his court\n",
      "dress and hastened to the Palace, leaving Grandmother Jia and the rest in an extreme\n",
      "state of alarm which they endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to allay by dispatching a\n",
      "regular stream of mounted couriers post-haste to the Palace to inquire for news.\n",
      "About four hours later Lai Da, the Chief Steward of the Rong-guo mansion, and three\n",
      "or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out\n",
      "congratulations.\n",
      "‘Master’s orders,’ said Lai Da between breaths: ‘will Her Old Ladyship please bring\n",
      "Their Ladyships to the Palace to give thanks to His Majesty for the great favour he has\n",
      "\f",
      "shown us!’\n",
      "Unable in her agitated state to remain indoors, Grandmother Jia had been waiting\n",
      "outside in the loggia, whither the others --Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi, Li Wan,\n",
      "Xi-feng, Aunt Xue and the girls -- had also congregated to await news of Jia Zheng.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia called Lai Da inside to explain his cryptic message in somewhat\n",
      "greater detail.\n",
      "‘We servants were all waiting in an anteroom,’ Lai Da told her, ‘and we had no idea\n",
      "what was going on inside. Eventually Mr. Xia came out and saw us waiting there.\n",
      "“Congratulations!” he said. “Your eldest young lady has been appointed Chief\n",
      "Secretary to the Empress and is to become an Imperial Concubine.” Then after that\n",
      "Master came out, too, and told us the same thing. “I have to go off to the East Palace\n",
      "now,” he said, “to see the Prince. But you must hasten back as quick as you can and\n",
      "tell Their Ladyships to come to the Palace and give thanks.”‘\n",
      "Lai’s Da information at once dispelled the anxiety that Grandmother Jia and the\n",
      "others had all this time been feeling, and the worried looks on their faces quickly\n",
      "gave way to smiles of pleasure. Now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed\n",
      "herself in the costume appropriate to her rank. Then off they went to the Palace in\n",
      "four sedans one behind the other: Grand?mother Jia’s at the head, then Lady Xing’s,\n",
      "then Lady Wang’s, and then You-shi’s. Jia She and Cousin Zhen also changed into\n",
      "court dress, and taking Jia Rong and Jia Qiang with them, accompanied Grandmother\n",
      "Jia to the Palace as her male escort.\n",
      "There was one person who did not share the unbounded delight now general among\n",
      "the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households—who behaved, indeed,\n",
      "almost as if he had not heard the news at all. This person was Bao-yu. What was the\n",
      "reason for his unsociable lack of enthusiasm on this occasion?\n",
      "A short time previously the little nun Sapientia had ab?sconded from Water-moon\n",
      "Priory and made her way into the city to look for Qin Zhong. Qin Bang-ye had\n",
      "discovered her, driven her from the house, and given Qin Zhong a beating. The shock\n",
      "and anger of the discovery had brought on an attack of the illness from which the old\n",
      "gentleman was a chronic sufferer, and within only four or five days he had breathed\n",
      "his last. Qin Zhong had always been of a weak and nervous disposition and had still\n",
      "not fully recovered from his sickness when these events occurred. The severe beating\n",
      "followed by the overwhelming grief and remorse attendant on the death of his father\n",
      "from anger which he had himself provoked led to serious complications in his illness.\n",
      "This, then, was the reason for Bao-yu’s unseasonable melancholy—a melancholy\n",
      "which the news of his sister Yuan?-chun’s dazzling promotion was powerless to dispel.\n",
      "Grand?mother Jia’s visit to the Palace to give thanks, her return home, the visits of\n",
      "friends and relations to congratulate the family, the unwontedly cheerful bustle of\n",
      "\f",
      "the Ning and Rong households during the days that followed, the general\n",
      "satisfac?tion that everyone in those households now seemed to feel—as far as\n",
      "Bao-yu was concerned these things might just as well not have been: he viewed them\n",
      "with the eyes of an outsider. The rest of the family merely laughed at him, seeing in\n",
      "this be?haviour only further confirmation of their belief that he was ‘a bit touched’.\n",
      "But then there was Jia Lian’s and Dai-yu’s homecoming to look forward to. The\n",
      "advent of the messenger sent on ahead to announce that they would be arriving next\n",
      "day produced the first glimmer of cheerfulness that Bao-yu had so far shown. On\n",
      "being questioned for further details the messenger told them that Jia Yu-cun was also\n",
      "returning to the capital to have an audience with the Emperor. This was the doing of\n",
      "Wang Zi-teng, who had recommended him in a report to the throne for promotion to\n",
      "a metropolitan post. As he was both a cousin (albeit a remote one) of. Jia Lian and\n",
      "also Dai-yu’s former teacher, it had been resolved that he should travel with them.\n",
      "Lin Ru-hai having been laid with his ancestors in the family burying-ground and his\n",
      "obsequies duly concluded, they would, if they had proceeded to the capital by the\n",
      "usual stages, have been arriving back some time in the following month; but when Jia\n",
      "Lian heard the news about Yuan-chun’s elevation, they had decided to make greater\n",
      "speed, travelling by night as well as by day. The journey had been smooth and\n",
      "uneventful.\n",
      "Bao-yu merely asked if Dai-yu was all right, and on being assured that she was, paid\n",
      "no further attention to the man’s news.\n",
      "Having waited with great impatience until the early afternoon of the following day,\n",
      "Bao-yu and the rest were rewarded with the announcement ‘Mr Lian and Miss Lin\n",
      "have just arrived!’ The joy of their reunion was, however, tempered with grief,\n",
      "because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting, and for a while\n",
      "there was much loud weeping on either side. Then there were words of comfort and\n",
      "congratula?tion to exchange and Bao-yu had an opportunity of studying Dai-yu more\n",
      "carefully. He recognized the same ethereal quality he had always known in her, but it\n",
      "seemed to have deepened and intensified during her absence.\n",
      "She had brought a lot of books back with her and was soon busy superintending the\n",
      "sweeping out of her bedroom to accommodate them and arranging various objets\n",
      "d’art around it which had also formed part of her luggage. She had salvaged some\n",
      "paper, writing-brushes and other articles of stationery from her old home which she\n",
      "distributed as presents to Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Bao-yu and the rest. Bao-yu for his\n",
      "part hunted up the rosary of fragrant Indian beads given him by the Prince of Bei-jing\n",
      "and offered it as a gift to Dai-yu; but she flung it back at him disdainfully:\n",
      "‘What, carry a thing that some coarse man has pawed over? I don’t want it!’\n",
      "So Bao-yu was compelled to take it back again.\n",
      "\f",
      "But let us now turn to Jia Lian.\n",
      "When he had finished seeing everyone in the family, Jia Lian returned at last to his\n",
      "own apartment. Xi-feng, though still so busy that she had not a moment’s leisure,\n",
      "had somehow contrived to find time to welcome back her wandering lord.\n",
      "‘Congratulations, Imperial Kinsman!’ she said with a smile when, except for the\n",
      "servants, they were at last alone together. ‘You have had a tiring journey, Imperial\n",
      "Kinsman. Yesterday when the courier gave notice of your arrival, I prepared a humble\n",
      "entertainment to celebrate your homecoming. Will the Imperial Kinsman graciously\n",
      "condescend to take a cup of wine with his handmaid?’\n",
      "Jia Lian replied in the same vein:\n",
      "‘Madam, you are too kind! I am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant,\n",
      "ma’am!’\n",
      "As they joked together, Patience and the other maids came forward to welcome their\n",
      "Master back, after which they served them both with tea. Jia Lian asked Xi-feng\n",
      "about the events that had occurred during his absence and thanked her for looking\n",
      "after things so well while he was away.\n",
      "‘I am not much of a manager really,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t got the knowledge, and\n",
      "I’m too poor at expressing myself and too simple-minded --- always inclined to “take\n",
      "a ramrod for a needle”, as they say. Besides, I’m too soft-hearted for the job. Anyone\n",
      "who says a few kind words can get the better of me. And my lack of experience\n",
      "makes me so nervous. Aunt Wang only had to be the slightest bit displeased and I\n",
      "would get so upset that I couldn’t sleep at night. I begged her not to make me do all\n",
      "these things, but she insisted. She said I only refused out of laziness and\n",
      "unwillingness to learn. I don’t think she realizes even now the state I have been in—\n",
      "too seated to move or even to open my mouth for fear of saying or doing something\n",
      "wrong. And you know what a difficult lot those old stewardesses are. The tiniest\n",
      "mistake and they are all laughing at you and making fun; the tiniest hint of\n",
      "favouritism and they are grumbling and complaining. You know their way of “cursing\n",
      "the oak-tree when they mean the ash”. Those old women know just how to sit on the\n",
      "mountain-top and watch the tigers fight; how to murder with a borrowed knife, or\n",
      "help the wind to fan the fire. They will look on safely from the bank while you are\n",
      "drowning in the river. And the fallen oil-bottle can drain away: they are not going to\n",
      "pick it up. On top of that, as I am so young, I haven’t got much authority over them;\n",
      "so it was all I could do to prevent them from ignoring me altogether. And to crown it\n",
      "all, when Rong’s wife died Cousin Zhen kept coming round to see Aunt Wang and\n",
      "begging her on his knees to let me help out for a day or two next door. I said again\n",
      "and again that I couldn’t do it; but Aunt Wang agreed just to please him, so there was\n",
      "nothing for it but to do as I was told. I’m afraid I made a terrible mess of it—even\n",
      "\f",
      "worse than I did here. And now it seems Cousin Zhen is beginning to grumble and\n",
      "says he wishes he had never asked me. When you see him tomorrow, do please try to\n",
      "make it up with him. Tell him it’s because I’m young and inexperienced. You might\n",
      "even hint that it’s his own fault for having asked me in the first place!’\n",
      "While she was saying this there was a sound of talking in the next room.\n",
      "‘Who is it?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "Patience came in to reply.\n",
      "‘Mrs. Xue sent Caltrop over to ask me about something. I’ve already given her an\n",
      "answer and sent her back.’\n",
      "‘Ah yes!’ said Jia Lian, apparently pleased by the recollec?tion. ‘When I went to call\n",
      "on Aunt Xue just now to tell her I was back, I ran into such a pretty young woman! I\n",
      "couldn’t place her as any of the girls in our household, so in the course of\n",
      "conversation I asked Aunt Xue who she was. It seems that she’s the little maid they\n",
      "had that lawsuit about. Cal—something. Caltrop. She’s finally been given as\n",
      "“chamber-wife” to that idiot Xue, Now that she has been plucked and painted like a\n",
      "grown-up woman she really does look most attractive! What a waste to throw away a\n",
      "beautiful girl on that great booby!’\n",
      "Xi-feng made a little moue.\n",
      "‘I should have thought that having just got back from Hangchow and Soochow and\n",
      "seen something of the world, you would have settled down a bit; but I see you are\n",
      "still the same greedy-guts as ever. Well, if you want her, there’s nothing simpler: I’ll\n",
      "exchange our Patience for her. You know what Cousin Xue is like: always “one eye on\n",
      "the dish and the other on the saucepan”. Throughout the whole of this last year\n",
      "there have been I don’t know how many alarms and excursions between him and\n",
      "poor Aunt Xue because she wouldn’t let him get his hands on Caltrop. It wasn’t just\n",
      "her looks that made her concerned for the girl. Everything about her is so unusual.\n",
      "She is so gentle and so quiet. Even among our own young ladies there is scarcely her\n",
      "equal. In the end Aunt Xue decided that if she couldn’t stop him having her, at least\n",
      "she could make sure that the thing was done properly, with a party and invitations\n",
      "and all the rest of it. So that’s what she did, and made her his chamber wife. But\n",
      "would you believe it, before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost\n",
      "interest. . .!’\n",
      "She was interrupted by an announcement from one of the pages on the inner gate:\n",
      "‘Mr Zhen wants you, sir. He’s waiting for you in the larger study.’\n",
      "At once jia Lian did up his gown and hurried out.\n",
      "‘What on earth did Mrs. Xue want, sending Caltrop here like that?’ Xi-feng asked\n",
      "Patience as soon as he had gone.\n",
      "‘It wasn’t Caltrop!’ said Patience. ‘I had to make something up and hers was the\n",
      "\f",
      "first name that came to mind. That wife of Brightie’s is such a stupid woman! Just\n",
      "imagine’—she drew closer to Xi-feng’s ear and lowered her voice—‘of all the times\n",
      "she could have chosen to bring you the interest on that money, she had to pick on\n",
      "the very moment when the Master has just got home! It’s lucky I was in the outside\n",
      "room when she came, otherwise she might have come blundering in here and\n",
      "Master would have heard her message. And we all know what Master is like where\n",
      "money is concerned: he’d spend the fat in the frying-pan if he could get it out! Once\n",
      "he found out that you had savings, he’d pluck up courage to spend them in no time.\n",
      "Anyway, I took the money from her quickly and gave her a piece of my mind -- which\n",
      "I am afraid you must have heard. That’s why I had to say what I did. I’d never have\n",
      "men?tioned Caltrop in the Master’s presence otherwise!’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘I was going to say! Why, for no apparent reason, should Mrs. Xue choose a\n",
      "chamber-wife to send here the moment Master gets back? So it was you up to your\n",
      "tricks, you little monkey!’\n",
      "At this point Jia Lian came in again and Xi-feng ordered her maids to serve the wine\n",
      "and various choice dishes to go with it. Husband and wife sat cross-legged at\n",
      "opposite sides of the low table on the kang and began their drinking—Xi-feng with\n",
      "some restraint, although she was normally a fairly hard drinker, in view of the\n",
      "occasion.\n",
      "They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Zhao, walked\n",
      "in. The young couple at once invited her to drink with them and tried to make her\n",
      "join them on the kang. This last honour she would under no circumstances accept,\n",
      "and Patience and the girls laid a little table for her at the side of the kang and set a\n",
      "little stool beside it, on which she sat down very contentedly. Jia Lian made a\n",
      "selection with his chopsticks from the dishes on the table, and after heaping up two\n",
      "platefuls, set them down on Nannie Zhao’s own little table for her to eat there by\n",
      "herself. Xi-feng was critical:\n",
      "‘Nannie can’t chew stuff like that. She’ll break her teeth on it!’ She turned to\n",
      "Patience. ‘That piece of boiled gammon in the bowl I said this morning was so tender:\n",
      "that would be just the thing for Nannie. Why don’t you run round to the kitchen and\n",
      "ask them to heat it up for her?— Nannie,’ she said, addressing the old woman, ‘you.\n",
      "must try some of the rice wine your Lian brought back with him from the South!’\n",
      "‘Ooh yes!’ said Nannie Zhao, ‘I must try some of that! And you must have some too,\n",
      "Mrs. Lian. Never fear! As long as you don’t drink too much, ’ twill do you good. But I\n",
      "didn’t come all the way here for vittles and drink, bless you. I came on more serious\n",
      "business. And you heed my words, Mrs. Lian, and stick up for me; because that\n",
      "Master Lian of yours he always says he’ll do something, but when you go to see him\n",
      "\f",
      "later, he’s clean forgot all about it! To think I reared you up on the milk of my own\n",
      "bosom, Master Lian! And a fine young man you’ve growed into, thanks be! Well, I’m\n",
      "old and of no account now. But there are these two sons of mine, d’ye see? If only\n",
      "you would be more like a foster-brother to theta and look after them a bit, no one\n",
      "would dare say a word agen them. But dearie me! I’ve asked you again and again to\n",
      "help them, and you always says yes; yet to this very day nothing has ever come of it.\n",
      "Well, what I thought was this, Mrs Lian. With this great blessing of Heaven that’s\n",
      "come on the family on account of your eldest young lady, surely, I thought to myself,\n",
      "there must be jobs in this for someone? I’ll talk to Mrs Lian about it, I said to myself;\n",
      "because if I rely on Master Lian to help us, we’ll starve to death for certain sure!’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘Leave your two boys to me, Nannie. I’ll look after them! You know all about Lian’s\n",
      "little ways because you nursed him when he was a baby: he’ll give the dearest thing\n",
      "he has to some nobody he’s picked up outside, yet his own two foster-brothers who\n",
      "are much nicer young men than any of his favourites he neglects completely. If only\n",
      "you would take a bit of interest in them, Lian, you wouldn’t hear a word of complaint\n",
      "from anyone, instead of wasting your kindnesses on those -- those little male misses\n",
      "of yours! I shouldn’t have called them “misses”, though. You treat the misses as your\n",
      "missus and give me the miss! ’\n",
      "There was a loud laugh from everyone present, including Nannie Zhao, who\n",
      "concluded her cackles with a pious invoca?tion:\n",
      "‘Bless his Holy Name! Here at last comes a just judge to set all things to rights -- But\n",
      "oh Mrs Lian, those naughty things you said about “misses”: that’s not my Master Lian.\n",
      "It’s just that he’s so soft-hearted he can’t bring himself to say “ no” to anyone who\n",
      "spins him a tale.’\n",
      "‘Soft-hearted with his boy friends, maybe,’ said Xi-feng with a lubricious smile; ‘but\n",
      "when he has to do with us women he is hard enough.’\n",
      "‘Tee, hee, hee, what a one you are, Mrs Lian! I don’t know when I was last so merry.\n",
      "Come on, let’s have another cup of that good wine! — Now that I’ve got Mrs Lian to\n",
      "stand up for me I shall have no more worries!’\n",
      "Jia Lian was by now thoroughly embarrassed and laughed sheepishly.\n",
      "‘Stop all this nonsense now and serve the rice! I’ve still got to go round to Cousin\n",
      "Zhen’s after this to discuss things.’\n",
      "‘Ah yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We mustn’t make you late for that. What did Cousin Zhen\n",
      "want you for just now?’\n",
      "‘It was about the visitation business,’ said Jia Lian.\n",
      "‘Has it been settled, then?’\n",
      "‘Well, not absolutely. Eight or nine parts settled, you might say.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘That’s a great favour of the Emperor’s, isn’t it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Something you don’t\n",
      "hear of even in plays and stories about the olden days.’\n",
      "‘Very true!’ chimed in Nannie Zhao. ‘But I must be getting old and stupid, for\n",
      "everywhere these last few days have been a-buzz with talk of “visitations”, but\n",
      "blessed if I can make head or tall of it. You tell us now: just what manner of thing is\n",
      "this “visitation”?’\n",
      "Jia Lian undertook to do so.\n",
      "‘Our present Emperor, who has always had a great sym?pathy for the common man,\n",
      "believes that the filial affection of a child for its parents is the most important thing in\n",
      "the world, and that family feeling is the same everywhere, irrespective of social rank.\n",
      "He has found that in his own case, even after see?ing the Ex-Emperor and\n",
      "Ex-Empress morning, noon and night every day of his life, he is still unable to express\n",
      "more than a fraction of the devotion he feels for them; and this has led him to think\n",
      "of all those concubines and maids of honour and other court ladies, taken from their\n",
      "homes and shut up in the Palace for years and years on end, and to realize how much\n",
      "they must miss their parents. And from there he got to thinking of the parents\n",
      "themselves, how they must long for the daughters they can never see again. And\n",
      "then he thought what a crime against Nature it would be if any of those parents were\n",
      "to become ill as a result of not seeing their daughters. And so he addressed a\n",
      "Memorial to the Ex-Emperor and Ex-Empress requesting permission to allow the\n",
      "families of palace ladies to visit them in the Palace on the twelfth day of every month.\n",
      "When Their Old Majesties saw this Memorial they were very pleased and praised the\n",
      "Emperor for his piety and goodness—“doing Heaven’s work among men” they called\n",
      "it. But they pointed out in their Rescript that when the families of court ladies\n",
      "entered the Palace on these visits, they would inevitably be hampered by the\n",
      "restrictions of court etiquette in the ex?pression of their natural feelings. So in the\n",
      "end, by an act of supreme generosity, the Emperor issued a special decree in which\n",
      "he said that, apart from allowing the families of court ladies to visit their daughters in\n",
      "the Palace on the twelfth day of each month, he would allow any family which had a\n",
      "separate house or annexe capable of being maintained in the degree of security\n",
      "specified for a temporary Imperial Residence to make written application for\n",
      "permission to receive a Visitation in their own home, where the pleasures of reunion\n",
      "could be enjoyed in an atmosphere of intimacy and affection. The proclamation of\n",
      "this decree has created quite a stir. The Imperial Concubine Lady Zhou’s father\n",
      "already has the builders at work on a special wing for visitations in his house, and\n",

      "Xi-feng in her eagerness cut her short:\n",
      "‘We Wangs received the Emperor on one of his visits, too. At that time my\n",

      "Court. Whenever any foreigners arrived, it was always my family that put them up.\n",
      "All the goods brought by the foreign ships to the seaports in Kwangtung, Fukien,\n",

      "received the Emperor four times! If I hadn’t seen with my own two eyes, I don’t care\n",
      "who told me, I wouldn’t have credited it, the sights I saw then! Never mind silver.\n",

      "know the meaning of!’\n",
      "‘I believe you,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve heard my grandfather talk about it, and he said it\n",
      "was just like that. But it still amazes me that a single family could have so much\n",

      "demanded her attention and, finishing hurriedly, rinsed out her mouth and prepared\n",
      "to go. Before she could leave, however, the pages from the second gate announced\n",

      "Xi-feng, curious, stayed to hear.\n",
      "‘Father sent us to tell you that the uncles have already reached a decision,’ said Jia\n",

      "the north-west corner of your grounds on the west, to be turned into a Separate\n",
      "Residence for the Visitation. They’ve already commissioned someone to draw a plan,\n",
      "which should be ready tomorrow. Father says as you’ve just got home he’s sure you\n",
      "must be tired, so don’t bother to come round tonight. If there’s anything to discuss,\n",
      "you can tell him about it first thing tomorrow.’\n",
      "‘Thank your father for me very much,’ said Jia Lian with a grateful smile. ‘It is very\n",
      "good of him to let me off tonight, and I shall do as he says and not go over until\n",
      "tomorrow. I think the great advantage of this proposal is that it is so economical and\n",
      "makes the job of construction so much easier. It would mean very much more\n",
      "trouble if we were to build on land out?side, yet at the same time we should lose the\n",
      "convenience this present scheme gives us of a single layout. Tell him when you get\n",
      "back that I think it is an excellent proposal, and that I leave it to him to protest in any\n",
      "way he thinks fit if the others show signs of going back on it. The one thing we must\n",
      "under no circumstances do is to go looking for land outside. Anyway, I shall be round\n",
      "to see him first thing tomorrow and we can talk about it in detail then.’\n",
      "Jia Rong promised to retail this message.\n",
      "Jia Qiang now stepped forward with a message of his own:\n",
      "‘Uncle Zhen has given me the job of going to Soochow to engage music and drama\n",
      "teachers and to buy girl players and instruments and costumes so that we can have\n",
      "our own theatricals for the visitation. I’m to take Lai Sheng’s two sons with me; and\n",
      "two of Great-uncle Zheng’s gentlemen, Dan Ping-ren and Bu Gu-xiu, are coming as\n",
      "well. Uncle said I ought to have a word with you about it before I go.’\n",

      "‘Do you think you are qualified for the job? It may not be a very big one, but I\n",
      "\f",
      "should say the pickings would be pretty good for someone who knew the ropes.’\n",
      "Jia Qiang laughed too.\n",
      "‘I shall have to learn as I go along!’\n",
      "Jia Rong, who was standing somewhat away. From the light, availed himself of the\n",
      "shadow’s concealment to give Xi-feng’s dress a surreptitious tug. She understood\n",
      "perfectly well what his meaning was, but pretended not to, dismissing him with a\n",
      "curt wave of the hand and addressing herself instead to Jia Lian:\n",
      "‘Don’t be so officious, Lian! Cousin Zhen is no less capable of choosing the right\n",
      "person for the job than we are. What do you mean by asking the boy if he’s qualified?\n",
      "He’s as much qualified as any of the rest of us. He’s old enough to have seen a pig run,\n",
      "even if he’s not old enough to have eaten pork! In any case, I’m sure Cousin Zhen\n",
      "only chose him as a figurehead. You don’t seriously suppose that he’ll be the one to\n",
      "discuss prices and deal with the business side of the expedition? — I think myself it’s\n",
      "a very good choice!’\n",
      "‘Of course it is,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t dispute it. I merely thought we ought to do a\n",
      "few of his sums for him before he goes. Where is the money for this coming from?’\n",
      "he asked Jia Qiang.\n",
      "‘We were discussing that just now,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Gaffer Lai says that there’s no\n",
      "point in taking money with us from here. He says the Zhens of Kiangnan hold fifty\n",
      "thousand taels of ours on deposit and he can give us a letter of credit to take to them\n",
      "when we go. We’ll draw out thirty thousand first and leave the rest to buy lanterns,\n",
      "lamps, and curtains with later on.’\n",
      "Jia Lian nodded appreciatively.\n",
      "‘Good idea.’\n",
      "‘Well, if that’s all settled,’ Xi-feng put in quickly, ‘I’ve got two very reliable young\n",
      "men for you to take with you, Qiang. I’m sure you’ll find them extremely useful.’\n",
      "‘What a coincidence!’ said Jia Qiang. ‘I was just about to ask if you could\n",
      "recommend a couple of helpers!’\n",
      "He asked for their names, and Xi-feng turned to Nannie Zhao to supply them. But the\n",
      "old nurse was so bemused by all this talk of policy and high finance that she\n",
      "appeared to be in a sort of coma, which it took a sharp nudge from Patience to rouse\n",
      "her from. When she answered it was in a gabble, to make up for the awkward pause.\n",
      "‘One of them is called Zhao Tian-liang, the other is called Zhao Tian-dong.’\n",
      "‘Mind you don’t forget!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I’m off to see to my own affairs.’ And\n",
      "she left the room.\n",
      "Jia Rong slipped out after her.\n",
      "‘If you will make a list of all the things you want,’ he said, smilingly and softly, ‘I’ll\n",
      "see that he gets them for you, gracious lady.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Gracious arsehole!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you think you can buy my favour with a few\n",
      "knick-knacks? I don’t like all this whispering in corners.’\n",
      "She walked away without giving him a chance to reply.\n",
      "Meanwhile Jia Qiang was making a somewhat similar proposal to Jia Lian.\n",
      "‘If there’s anything I can get for you while I’m away, Uncle, I shall be glad to wangle\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "‘My, my!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Let’s not get carried away, then! I must say, for one who’s\n",
      "only just started, you certainly haven’t lost much time in picking up the tricks of the\n",
      "trade! Yes, I dare say I shall write and let you know if I find I’m short of anything.’\n",
      "With these words he sent the two young men back to the other house. Their\n",
      "departure was followed by a succession of three or four visits by servants reporting\n",
      "on household matters, after which he felt so exhausted that he instructed the\n",
      "servants on the inner gate to refuse admittance to any others and to inform them\n",
      "that he would deal with their business next day. It was midnight by the time Xi-feng\n",
      "got back to bed.\n",
      "But the affairs of that night are no part of our story.\n",
      "Rising early next morning, Jia Lian first called on his father and uncles and then went\n",
      "to the Ning-guo mansion, where, with Cousin Zhen, he joined a group consisting of\n",
      "the older stewards and domestics and a few friends and clients of the family in\n",
      "making a complete survey of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties with a view to\n",
      "deciding where the various buildings of the Separate Residence should be sited. He\n",
      "also helped them interview the craftsmen who would undertake the work.\n",
      "After the assembling of builders and artisans the assembling of materials began: a\n",
      "continuous flow of supplies converging on the site from every direction, from\n",
      "precious consignments of gold, silver, copper and tin, to huge, bulky loads of\n",
      "builder’s clay, timber, bricks and tiles.\n",
      "Various walls, including the surrounding walls of the All? scents Garden, and some of\n",
      "the garden’s pavilions were demolished so that the north-west part of the Ning-guo\n",
      "property and the large open court on the north-east side of Rong-guo House were\n",
      "thrown into a single site. A range of servants’ quarters on the east side of the\n",
      "Rong-guo grounds had already been demolished. The Ning-guo and Rong-guo\n",
      "properties had previous to this been divided by an alley-way running from north to\n",
      "south between them, but as it was not a public thoroughfare, no problem as involved\n",
      "in closing it and incorporating part of it in the rest of the new site.\n",
      "The All-scents Garden had been watered by a stream led in by a culvert which ran\n",
      "under a corner of the north wall. Now that the garden was being integrated in the\n",
      "larger site, it was no longer necessary to lead the water in at this point.\n",
      "The artificial hills, rocks, trees and shrubs of All-scents Garden were, of course,\n",
      "\f",
      "insufficient for the whole of the new site; but the area occupied by Jia She was the\n",
      "original garden of Rong-guo House and plentifully supplied with bamboos, trees,\n",
      "rocks, pavilions, kiosks and pergolas capable of being moved elsewhere. By pooling\n",
      "the resources of these two garden—the All-scents Garden of Ning-guo House and the\n",
      "original Rong-guo garden where Jia She lived— and redistri?buting them over a single\n",
      "area, it would be possible to make great economies in both labour and materials, and\n",
      "when the estimates came to be made it was found that the requirements, in terms of\n",
      "completely new materials, would be comparatively modest.\n",
      "The conception as a whole and the designs for its execution were alike the work of a\n",
      "well-known landscape gardener familiar to all and sundry by the sobriquet of\n",
      "‘Horticultural Hu’.\n",
      "Jia Zheng was unused to matters of a practical nature and left the management of\n",
      "men and the control of operations to a consortium consisting of Jia She, Cousin Zhen\n",
      "and Jia Lian, the stewards Lai Da, Lai Sheng and Lin Zhi-xiao, the Clerk of Stores Wu\n",
      "Xin-deng, and two of his literary gentlemen, Zhan Guang and Cheng Ri-xing. The\n",
      "digging of pools, the raising of hills, the sitting and erection of lodges and pavilions,\n",
      "the planting of bamboos and flowers—in a word, all matters pertaining to the\n",
      "landscaping and layout of the gardens, were planned and supervised by Horticultural\n",
      "Hu. Jia Zheng would merely drop in occasionally when he got back from Court and\n",
      "look around. On any important matters he sought the advice of Jia She and the rest.\n",
      "Jia She led a life of cultured ease and never did anything. On routine matters of no\n",
      "great importance Cousin Zhen would either report to him in person or send him a\n",
      "brief note when the thing was done. If consultation was unavoidable, he would send\n",
      "along Lai Da or one of the others for a reply.\n",
      "Jia Rong’s sole task was to supervise the making of objects in gold and silver.\n",
      "Jia Qiang had already left for Soochow.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen, Lai Da and the rest were the ones who did most of the real work. It was\n",
      "they who hired workmen, kept accounts, and supervised and inspected each job as it\n",
      "was undertaken.\n",
      "The amount of noise and activity generated by these opera?tions could not be\n",
      "described in a few words, and for the time being we shall not attempt the task.\n",
      "The family’s recent preoccupation with these important developments had released\n",
      "Bao-yu from his father’s periodical quizzing about the progress of his studies.\n",
      "Unfortunately the relief of mind which this would otherwise have afforded him was\n",
      "displaced by a grave concern for Qin Zhong, whose sickness seemed to be daily\n",
      "worsening. Under such circumstances it was impossible for him to feel happy about\n",
      "anything else.\n",
      "One morning, just as he had finished washing and dressing and was thinking of going\n",
      "\f",
      "round to Grandmother Jia to ask if he might pay Qin Zhong another visit, he caught\n",
      "sight of Tealeaf dodging about behind the screen wall of the inner gate and evidently\n",
      "trying to catch his attention. Bao-yu hurried over to him.\n",
      "‘What is it?’\n",
      "‘Master Qin. He’s dying!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was stunned.\n",
      "‘Dying? When I saw him yesterday he seemed quite lucid. How can he be dying so\n",
      "soon?’\n",
      "‘I don’t know,’ said Tealeaf. ‘But that’s what the old gaffer said just now who came\n",
      "round to tell me.’\n",
      "Bao-yu hurried back and told Grandmother Jia. She in?structed some of the more\n",
      "reliable servants to go with him and briefly admonished him before he went:\n",
      "‘When you get there you may stay with him to the end, since you have been such\n",
      "good friends; but you must come back as soon as it is over. Don’t hang about!’\n",
      "Bao-yu hurried off to change, only to find, on re-emerging, that the carriage was still\n",
      "not ready. Anxious lest he should arrive too late, he ran up and down the courtyard in\n",
      "a frenzy of impatience, imploring the servants to make haste; and when it at last\n",
      "arrived, he flung himself in it and drove off at great speed, hotly pursued by Li Gui,\n",
      "Tealeaf and the others attend?ing him.\n",
      "The house, when they reached it, appeared silent and deserted. Entering together in\n",
      "a tight little knot, master and servants surged through like swarming bees to the\n",
      "inner apartment at the back where Qin Zhong lay, causing great consternation among\n",
      "the two aunts and half-dozen girl cousins who were tending him and who were\n",
      "unable to con?ceal themselves before the advent of this masculine invasion.\n",
      "At this stage Qin Zhong had already lost consciousness several times and, in\n",
      "accordance with the Northern custom which forbids a sick man to breathe his last on\n",
      "the kang, had some time since been lifted on to a trestle bed to die. Bao-yu gave an\n",
      "involuntary cry when he saw where he was lying and broke into noisy weeping. He\n",
      "was quickly restrained by Li Gui:\n",
      "‘You know how delicate Master Qin is. I expect the kang was too hard for him and\n",
      "they have put him here so that he can lie a bit more easy. You mustn’t cry like that or\n",
      "you will make him worse!’\n",
      "Bao-yu held back his sobs and drew close to his dying friend. Qin Zhong’s face was\n",
      "waxen. His eyes were closed tight and he seemed to breathe with difficulty, twisting\n",
      "his head from side to side on the pillow.\n",
      "‘Jing-qing, old fellow! It’s me! It’s Bao-yu!’—He called him several times, but Qin\n",
      "Zhong seemed unaware of his presence. Again he called:\n",
      "‘It’s Bao-yu!’\n",
      "\f",
      "In point of fact Qin Zhong’s soul had already left his body and the few faint gasps of\n",
      "breath in his failing lungs were the only life that now remained in it. The ministers of\n",
      "the under?world, armed with a warrant and chains to bind him with, were at that\n",
      "very moment confronting him; but his soul was refusing to go quietly. Remembering\n",
      "that he left no one behind him to look after his family’s affairs, and bethinking him of\n",
      "poor Sapientia whose whereabouts were still unknown, he entreated them most\n",
      "piteously to spare him. But the infernal visitants had no ear for his entreaties and\n",
      "silenced him with angry rebuke:\n",
      "‘You’re an educated young fellow: haven’t you heard the saying\n",
      "If Yama calls at midnight hour\n",
      "      No man can put off death till four—?\n",

      "doing kindnesses and showing favours and inventing little tricks and dodges for\n",
      "frustrating the course of justice -- we are incapable of showing partiality.’\n",
      "Suddenly, above their angry shouting, Qin Zhong heard a tiny cry:\n",
      "‘It’s Bao-yu!’\n",
      "At once he renewed his entreaties:\n",
      "‘Good gentlemen, be merciful! Give me just a moment for a few words with a very\n",
      "dear friend of mine, and I’ll be back directly!’\n",
      "‘What is it now?’ asked the demons. ‘What friend?’\n",
      "‘I won’t deceive you, gentlemen. It’s a descendant of the Duke of Rong-guo. His\n",
      "name is Bao-yu.’\n",
      "‘What?’ screamed the officer in charge of the party in great alarm. He turned\n",
      "angrily on his demon minions;\n",
      "‘I told you we ought to let him go back for a bit, but you wouldn’t listen. Now look\n",
      "what’s happened! He’s gone and called up a person full of life and health to come\n",
      "here right in our midst! This is terrible!’\n",
      "The demons showed signs of disarray on observing their leader to be so affected, and\n",
      "there was some angry mutter?ing:\n",
      "‘Yer Honour was putting on a brave enough show a short while ago. Why should\n",
      "the name “Bao-yu” throw you into such a state of commotion? If you ask us, seeing\n",
      "that he’s upper world and we’re lower world, there’s nothing to be afraid of. We\n",
      "might just as well carry this one off now and have done with it.’\n",
      "The trepidation of their leader, who was perhaps thinking more of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "demon-repelling talisman than of its wearer, was far from comforted by this\n",
      "reflection.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘No! No! No!’ he shouted, and compelled them to let the soul return to its body.\n",
      "With the return of his soul Qin Zhong regained conscious?ness and opened his eyes.\n",
      "He could see Bao-yu standing beside him; but his throat was so choked with phlegm\n",

      "prospects and pavilions—even the rocks and trees and flowers will seem somehow\n",
      "incomplete without that touch of poetry which only the written word can lend a\n",
      "scene.’\n",
      "‘My dear patron, you are so right,’ said one of the literary gentlemen who sat with\n",
      "him. ‘But we have had an idea. The inscriptions for the various parts of the garden\n",
      "obviously cannot be dispensed with; nor, equally obviously, can they be decided in\n",
      "advance. Our suggestion is that we should compose provisional names and couplets\n",
      "to suit the places where inscriptions are required, and have them painted on\n",
      "rectangu?lar paper lanterns which can be hung up temporarily –either horizontally or\n",
      "vertically as the case may be—when Her Grace comes to visit. We can ask her to\n",
      "decide on the permanent names after she has inspected the garden. Is not this a\n",
      "solution of the dilemma?’\n",
      "‘It is indeed,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘when we look round the garden presently, we must all\n",
      "try to think of words that can be used. If they seem suitable, we can keep them for\n",
      "the lanterns. If not, we can call for Yu-cun to come and help us out.’\n",
      "‘Your own suggestions are sure to be admirable, Sir Zheng,’ said the literary\n",
      "gentlemen ingratiatingly. ‘There will be no need to call in Yu-cun.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng smiled deprecatingly.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I am afraid it is not as you imagine. In my youth I had at best only indifferent skill in\n",
      "the art of writing verses about natural objects -- birds and flowers and scenery and\n",
      "the like; and now that I’m older and have to devote all my energies to official\n",
      "documents and government papers, I am even more out of touch with this sort of\n",
      "thing than I was then; so that even if I were to try my hand at it, I fear that my efforts\n",
      "would be rather dull and pedantic ones. Instead of enhancing the interest and beauty\n",
      "of the garden, they would probably have a deadening effect upon both.’\n",
      "‘That doesn’t matter,’ the literary gentlemen replied. ‘We can all try our hands at\n",
      "composing. If each of us contributes what he is best at, and if we then select the\n",
      "better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good, we should be able to\n",
      "manage all right.’\n",
      "‘That seems to me a very good suggestion,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘As the weather today is\n",
      "so warm and pleasant, let us all go and take a turn round the garden now!’\n",
      "So saying he rose to his feet and conducted his little retinue of literary luminaries\n",
      "towards the garden. Cousin Zhen hurried on ahead to warn those in charge that they\n",
      "were coming.\n",
      "As Bao-yu was still in very low spirits these days because of his grief for Qin Zhong,\n",
      "Grandmother Jia had hit on the idea of sending him into the newly made garden to\n",
      "play. By un?lucky chance she had selected this very day on which to try out her\n",
      "antidote. He had in fact only just entered the garden when Cousin Zhen came\n",
      "hurrying towards him.\n",
      "‘Better get out of here!’ said Cousin Zhen with an amused smile. ‘Your father will\n",
      "be here directly!’\n",
      "Bao-ya streaked back towards the gate, a string of nurses and pages hurrying at his\n",
      "heels. But he had only just turned the corner on coming out of it when he almost ran\n",
      "into the arms of Jia Zheng and his party coming from the opposite direction. Escape\n",
      "was impossible. He simply had to stand meekly to one side and await instructions.\n",
      "Jia Zheng had recently received a favourable report on Bao-yu from his teacher Jia\n",
      "Dai-ru in which mention had been made of his skill in composing couplets. Although\n",
      "the boy showed no aptitude for serious study, Dai-ru had said, he nevertheless\n",
      "possessed a certain meretricious talent for versi?fication not undeserving of\n",
      "commendation. Because of this report, Jia Zheng ordered Bao-yu to accompany him\n",
      "into the garden, intending to put his aptitude to the test. Bao-yu, who knew nothing\n",
      "either of Dai-ru’s report or of his father’s in?tentions, followed with trepidation.\n",
      "As soon as they reached the gate they found Cousin Zhen at the head of a group of\n",
      "overseers waiting to learn Jia Zheng’s wishes.\n",
      "‘I want you to close the gate,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘so that we can see what it looks like\n",
      "from outside before we go in.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Cousin Zhen ordered the gate to be closed, and Jia Zheng stood back and studied it\n",
      "gravely.\n",
      "It was a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles. The\n",
      "wooden lattice-work of the doors and windows was finely carved and ingeniously\n",
      "patterned. The whole gatehouse was quite unadorned by colour or gild?ing, yet all\n",
      "was of the most exquisite workmanship. Its walls stood on a terrace of white marble\n",
      "carved with a pattern of passion-flowers in relief, and the garden’s whitewashed\n",
      "circumference wall to left and right of it had a footing made of black-and-white\n",
      "striped stone blocks arranged so that the stripes formed a simple pattern. Jia Zheng\n",
      "found the unosten?tatious simplicity of this entrance greatly to his liking, and after\n",
      "ordering the gates to be opened, passed on inside.\n",
      "A cry of admiration escaped them as they entered, for there, immediately in front of\n",
      "them, screening everything else from their view, rose a steep, verdure-clad hill.\n",
      "‘Without this hill,’ Jia Zheng somewhat otiosely observed, ‘the whole garden would\n",
      "be visible as one entered, and all its mystery would be lost.’\n",
      "The literary gentlemen concurred. ‘Only a master of the art of landscape could have\n",
      "conceived so bold a stroke,’ said one of them.\n",
      "As they gazed at this miniature mountain, they observed a great number of large\n",
      "white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes, rising course above\n",
      "course up one of its sides, some recumbent, some upright or leaning at angles, their\n",
      "surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half concealed by creepers,\n",
      "and with a narrow, zigzag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between\n",
      "them.\n",
      "‘Let us begin our tour by following this path,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If we work our way\n",
      "round towards the other side of the hill on our way back, we shall have made a\n",
      "complete circuit of the garden.’\n",
      "He ordered Cousin Zhen to lead the way, and leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, began the\n",
      "winding ascent of the little mountain. Suddenly on the mountainside above his head,\n",
      "he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smoothness and\n",
      "realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an\n",
      "inscription.\n",
      "‘Aha, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng turning back to address the others who were\n",
      "climbing up behind him. ‘What name are we going to choose for this mountain?’\n",
      "‘Emerald Heights,’ said one.\n",
      "‘Embroidery Hill,’ said another.\n",
      "Another proposed that they should call it ‘Little Censer’ after the famous Censer\n",
      "Peak in Kiangsi. Another proposed ‘Little Zhong-nan’. Altogether some twenty or\n",
      "thirty names were suggested -- none of them very seriously, since the literary\n",
      "\f",
      "gentlemen were aware that Jia Zheng intended to test Bao-yu and were anxious not\n",
      "to make the boy’s task too difficult. Bao-yu understood and was duly grateful.\n",
      "When no more names were forthcoming Jia Zheng turned to Bao-yu and asked him\n",
      "to propose something himself.\n",
      "‘I remember reading in some old book,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that “to recall old things is\n",
      "better than to invent new ones; and to re-cut an ancient text is better than to\n",
      "engrave a modern”. We ought, then, to choose something old. But as this is not the\n",
      "garden’s principal “mountain” or its chief vista, strictly speak?ing there is no\n",
      "justification for having an inscription here at all—unless it is to be something which\n",
      "implies that this is merely a first step towards more important things ahead. I suggest\n",
      "we should call it “Pathway to Mysteries” after the line in Chang Jian’s poem about\n",
      "the mountain temple:\n",
      "\n",
      "A path winds upwards to mysterious places.\n",
      "\n",
      "A name like that would be more distinguished.’\n",
      "There was a chorus of praise from the literary gentlemen:\n",
      "‘Exactly right! Wonderful! Our young friend with his natural talent and youthful\n",
      "imagination succeeds immediately where we old pedants fail!’\n",
      "Jia Zheng gave a deprecatory laugh:\n",
      "‘You mustn’t flatter the boy! People of his age are adept at making a little\n",
      "knowledge go a long way. I only asked him as a joke, to see what he would say. We\n",
      "shall have to think of a better name later on.’\n",
      "As he spoke, they passed through a tunnel of rock in the mountain’s shoulder into an\n",
      "artificial ravine ablaze with the vari-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of\n",
      "tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion. Down below, where the trees\n",
      "were thickest, a clear stream gushed between the rocks. After they had advanced a\n",
      "few paces in a somewhat northerly direction, the ravine broadened into a little\n",
      "flat-bottomed valley and the stream widened out to form a pool. Gaily painted and\n",
      "carved pavilions rose from the slopes on either side, their lower halves concealed\n",
      "amidst the trees, their tops reaching into the blue. In the midst of the prospect below\n",
      "them was a handsome bridge:\n",
      "In a green ravine\n",
      "A jade stream sped.\n",
      "A stair of stone\n",
      "Plunged to the brink.\n",
      "where the water widened\n",
      "To a placid pool,\n",
      "\f",
      "A marble baluster\n",
      "Ran round about.\n",
      "A marble bridge crossed it\n",
      "With triple span,\n",
      "And a marble lion’s maw\n",
      "Crowned each of the arches.\n",
      "Over the centre of the bridge there was a little pavilion, which Jia Zheng and the\n",
      "others entered and sat down in.\n",
      "‘Well, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What are we going to call it?’\n",
      "‘Ou-yang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of “a pavilion poised above\n",
      "the water”,’ said one of them. ‘what about “Poised Pavilion”?’\n",
      "‘“Poised Pavilion” is good,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but this pavilion was put here in order to\n",
      "dominate the water it stands over, and I think there ought to be some reference to\n",
      "water in its name. I seem to recollect that in that same essay you men?tion Ou-yang\n",
      "Xiu speaks of the water “gushing between twin peaks”. Could we not use the word\n",
      "“gushing” in some way?’\n",
      "‘Yes, yes!’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘“Gushing Jade” would do splendidly.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng fondled his beard meditatively, then turned to Bao-yu and asked him for his\n",
      "suggestion.\n",
      "‘I agreed with what you said just now, Father,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but on second thoughts\n",
      "it seems to me that though it may have been all right for Ou-yang Xiu to use the word\n",
      "“gush?ing” in describing the source of the river Rang, it doesn’t really suit the water\n",
      "round this pavilion. Then again, as this is a Separate Residence specially designed for\n",
      "the reception of a royal personage, it seems to me that something rather formal is\n",
      "called for, and that an expression taken from the Drunkard’s Pavilion might seem a bit\n",
      "improper. I think we should try to find a rather more imaginative, less obvious sort of\n",
      "name.’\n",
      "‘I hope you gentlemen are all taking this in!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically, ‘You will\n",
      "observe that when we suggest something original we are recommended to prefer the\n",
      "old to the new, but that when we do make use of an old text we are “improper” and\n",
      "“unimaginative”! -- Well, carry on then! Let’s have your suggestion!’\n",
      "‘I think “Drenched Blossoms” would be more original and more tasteful than\n",
      "“Gushing Jade”.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently. The literary gentlemen could see\n",
      "that he was pleased and hastened to commend Bao-yu’s remarkable ability.\n",
      "‘That’s the two words for the framed board on top,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Not a very\n",
      "difficult task. But what about the seven-word lines for the sides?’\n",
      "Bao-yu glanced quickly round, seeking inspiration from the scene, and presently\n",
      "\f",
      "came up with the following couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Three pole-thrust lengths of bankside willows green,\n",
      "One fragrant breath of bankside flowers sweet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng nodded and a barely perceptible smile played over his features. The literary\n",
      "gentlemen redoubled their praises.\n",
      "They now left the pavilion and crossed to the other side of the pool. For a while they\n",
      "walked on, stopping from time to time to admire the various rocks and flowers and\n",
      "trees which they passed on their way, until suddenly they found them?selves at the\n",
      "foot of a range of whitewashed walls enclosing a small retreat almost hidden among\n",
      "the hundreds and hundreds of green bamboos which grew in a dense thicket behind\n",
      "them. With cries of admiration they went inside. A cloister-like covered walk ran\n",
      "round the walls from the entrance to the back of the forecourt and a cobbled\n",
      "pathway up to the steps of the terrace. The house was a tiny three-frame one, two\n",
      "parts latticed, the third part windowless. The tables, chairs and couches which\n",
      "furnished it seemed to have been specially made to fit the interior. A door in the rear\n",
      "wall opened onto a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flowering\n",
      "pear-tree and overlooked on either side by two diminutive lodges built at right angles\n",
      "to the back of the house. A stream gushed through an opening at the foot of the\n",
      "garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran to the foot of the rear terrace\n",
      "and thence round the side of the house to the front, where it meandered through\n",
      "the bamboos of the forecourt before finally disappearing through another opening in\n",
      "the surrounding wall.\n",
      "‘This must be a pleasant enough place at any time,’ said Jia Zheng with a smile. ‘But\n",
      "just imagine what it would be like to sit studying beside the window here on a\n",
      "moonlight night! It is pleasures like that which make a man feel he has not lived in\n",
      "vain!’\n",
      "As he spoke, his glance happened to fall on Bao-yu, who instantly became so\n",
      "embarrassed that he hung his head in shame. He was rescued by the timely\n",
      "intervention of the literary gentlemen who changed the subject from that of study to\n",
      "a less dangerous topic. Two of them suggested that the name given to this retreat\n",
      "should be a four-word one. Jia Zheng asked them what four words they proposed.\n",
      "‘“Where Bends the Qi”’ said one of them, no doubt hav?ing in mind the song in the\n",
      "Poetry Classic which begins with the words\n",
      "\n",
      "See in that nook where bends the Qi,\n",
      "The green bamboos, how graceful grown!\n",
      "\f",
      "‘No,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too obvious!’\n",
      "‘“North of the Sui”,’ said the other, evidently thinking of the ancient Rabbit Garden\n",
      "of the Prince of Liang in Suiyang—also famous for its bamboos and running water.\n",
      "‘No,’ said jia Zheng. ‘Still too obvious!’\n",
      "‘You’d better ask Cousin Bao again,’ said Cousin Zhen, who stood by listening.\n",
      "‘He always insists on criticizing everyone else’s suggestions before he will deign to\n",
      "make one of his own,’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘He is a worthless creature.’\n",
      "‘That’s all right,’ said the others. ‘His criticisms are very good ones. He is in no way\n",
      "to blame for making them.’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t let him get away with it!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘All right!’ he went on,\n",
      "turning to Bao-yu. ‘Today we will indulge you up to the hilt. Let’s have your criticisms,\n",
      "and after that we’ll hear your own proposal. What about the two suggestions that\n",
      "have just been made? Do you think either of them could be used?’\n",
      "‘Neither of them seems quite right to me,’ said Bao-yu in answer to the question.\n",
      "‘In what way “not quite right”?’ said Jia Zheng with a scornful smile.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘This is the first building our visitor will enter when she looks\n",
      "over the garden, so there ought to be some word of praise for the Emperor at this\n",
      "point. If we want a classical reference with imperial symbolism, I suggest “The\n",
      "Phoenix Dance”, alluding to that passage in the History Classic about the male and\n",
      "female phoenixes alighting “with measured gambollings” in the Emperor’s courtyard.’\n",
      "‘What about “Bend of the Qi” and “North of the Sui”?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Aren’t they\n",
      "classical allusions? If not, I should like to know what they are!’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they are too contrived. “The Phoenix Dance” is more fitting.’\n",
      "There was a loud murmur of assent from the literary gentlemen. Jia Zhong nodded\n",
      "and tried not to look pleased.\n",
      "‘Young idiot!— A “small capacity but a great self-con?ceit”, gentlemen— All right!’\n",
      "he ordered: ‘now the couplet!’\n",
      "So Bao-yu recited the following couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ‘From the empty cauldron the steam still rises after the brewing of tea.\n",
      "By the darkening window the fingers are still cold after the game of Go.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng shook his head:\n",
      "‘Nothing very remarkable about that!’\n",
      "With this remark he began to move on, but thought of something just as they were\n",
      "leaving, and stopped to ask Cousin Zhen:\n",
      "‘I see that the buildings in this garden have their proper complement of chairs and\n",
      "\f",
      "tables and so forth. What about blinds and curtains and flower-vases and all that sort\n",
      "of thing? Have they been selected to suit the individual rooms?’\n",
      "‘As regards ornaments,’ Cousin Zhen replied, ‘we have already got in quite a large\n",
      "stock, and when the time comes we shall naturally select from it what is suitable for\n",
      "each individual room. As regards drapes and hangings, Cousin Lian told me yesterday\n",
      "that there are quite a lot yet to come. what we did was to take the measurements\n",
      "from the plans drawn up for the carpenters and put the work in hand straight away,\n",
      "even before the buildings were finished. As far as I know, up to yesterday we had\n",
      "received about half of what was ordered.’\n",
      "From the way Cousin Zhen spoke, Jia Zheng gathered that this was not his\n",
      "responsibility and sent someone to summon Jia Lian. He arrived within moments,\n",
      "and Jia Zheng ques?tioned him about the types and quantities ordered and the\n",
      "figures for what had already been received and what was still to come.\n",
      "In response to his inquiry Jia Lian extracted a wallet from the leg of his boot, and\n",
      "glancing at a folded schedule inside it summarized its contents as follows:\n",
      "‘Curtains, large and small, in various silks and satins—flowered, dragon-spot,\n",
      "sprigged, tapestry, panelled, ink-splash: one hundred and twenty. —Eighty of those\n",
      "were delivered yesterday. That leaves forty to come. —Blinds: two hundred. —Yes.\n",
      "They all arrived yesterday. But then there are the special ones. —Blinds, scarlet felt:\n",
      "two hundred. Speckled bamboo: one hundred. Red lacquered bamboo with gold\n",
      "fleck: one hundred. Black lacquered bamboo: one hundred. Coloured net: two\n",
      "hundred. —We now have half of each of those four kinds. The other half is promised\n",
      "by the end of autumn. —Chair-covers, table-drapes, valances, tablecloths: one\n",
      "thousand two hundred of each. —Those we already have.’\n",
      "They had been moving on as he spoke, but were presently brought to a halt by a\n",
      "steeply sloping hill which rose up in front of them. Having negotiated its foot, they\n",
      "could see, almost concealed in a fold half-way up the other side of it, a dim-coloured\n",
      "adobe wall crowned with a coping of rice-straw thatch. Inside it were several\n",
      "hundred apricot trees, whose flowering tops resembled the billowing rosy clouds of\n",
      "some vegetable volcano. In their midst stood a little group of reed?-thatched\n",
      "cottages. Beyond the wall, with a barred gate divid?ing it in the middle, a loose\n",
      "hedge of irregular shape had been made by weaving together the pliant young\n",
      "shoots of the mulberry, elm, hibiscus, and silkworm thorn trees which grew outside it.\n",
      "Between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well,\n",
      "furnished with both well-sweep and windlass. Below the well, row upon row of\n",
      "miniature fields full of healthy-looking vegetables and flowers ran down in variegated\n",
      "strips to the bottom.\n",
      "‘Ah, now here is a place with a purpose!’ said Jia Zheng with a pleased smile. It may\n",
      "\f",
      "have been made by human arti?fice, but the sight of it is none the less moving. In me\n",
      "it awakens the desire to get back to the land, to a life of rural simplicity. Let us go in\n",
      "and rest a while!’\n",
      "They were just on the point of entering the gate in the hedge when they observed a\n",
      "stone at the side of the pathway leading up to it which had evidently been put there\n",
      "in order that the name of the place might be inscribed upon it.\n",
      "‘What a brilliant idea!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘If they had put a board\n",
      "up over the gate, the rustic atmosphere would have been completely destroyed,\n",
      "whereas this stone actually enhances it. This is a place which calls for the bucolic\n",
      "talent of a Fan Cheng-da to do it justice!’\n",
      "‘What shall we call it, then?’ asked Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘Just now our young friend was saying that to “recall an bid thing is better than to\n",
      "invent a new one”,’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘In this case the ancients have\n",
      "already provided the perfect name: “Apricot Village”.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng knew that he was referring to the words of the fainting traveller in Du Mu’s\n",
      "poem:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where’s the tavern?’ I cry, and a lad points the way\n",
      "To a village far off in the apricot trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to Cousin Zhen with a smile:\n",
      "‘Yes. That reminds me. There’s just one thing missing here: an inn-sign. Tomorrow\n",
      "you must have one made. Nothing fancy. Just an ordinary inn-sign like the ones you\n",
      "see in country villages outside. And it should hang from a bamboo pole above the\n",
      "tree-tops.’\n",
      "Cousin Zhen promised to see this done and added a sugges?tion of his own:\n",
      "‘The birds here, too, ought to be ordinary farmyard ones—hens, ducks, geese, and\n",
      "so on—to be in keeping with the surroundings.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng and the rest agreed enthusiastically.\n",
      "‘The only trouble with “Apricot Village”,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘—though it would suit the\n",
      "place very well—is that it is the name of a real village; so we should have to get\n",
      "official permission first before we could use it.’\n",
      "‘Ah, yes,’ said the others. ‘That means we still have to think of something for a\n",
      "temporary name. Now what shall it be?’\n",
      "While they were all still thinking, Bao-yu who had already had an idea, was so\n",
      "bursting with eagerness that he broke in, without waiting to be invited by his father:\n",
      "‘There is an old poem which has the lines\n",
      "\f",
      "Above the flowering apricot\n",
      "A hopeful inn-sign hangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the inscription on the stone we ought to have “The Hopeful Sign”.’\n",
      "‘“The Hopeful Sign”,’ echoed the literary gentlemen admiringly. ‘Very good! The\n",
      "hidden allusion to “Apricot Village” is most ingenious!’\n",
      "‘Oh, as for the name of the village,’ said Bao-yu scornfully, ‘“Apricot Village” is\n",
      "much too obvious! why not “Sweet-rice Village” from the words of the old poem:\n",
      "\n",
      "A cottage by the water stands\n",
      "Where Sweet the young rice smells?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The literary gentlemen clapped their hands delightedly; but their cries of admiration\n",
      "were cut short by an angry shout from Jia Zheng:\n",
      "‘Ignorant young puppy! Just how many “old poets” and “old poems” do you think\n",
      "you know, that you should pre?sume to show off in front of your elders in this\n",
      "impertinent manner? We let you have your little say just now in order to test your\n",
      "intelligence. It was no more than a joke. Do you suppose we are seriously interested\n",
      "in your opinions?’\n",
      "They had been moving on meanwhile, and he now led them into the largest of the\n",
      "little thatched buildings, from whose simple interior with its paper windows and\n",
      "plain deal furniture all hint of urban refinement had been banished. Jia Zheng was\n",
      "inwardly pleased. He stared hard at Bao-yu:\n",
      "‘How do you like this place, then?’\n",
      "With secret winks and nods the literary gentlemen urged Bao-yu to make a\n",
      "favourable reply, but he willfully ignored their promptings.\n",
      "‘Not nearly as much as “The Phoenix Dance”.’\n",
      "His father snorted disgustedly.\n",
      "‘Ignoramus! You have eyes only for painted halls and gaudy pavilions—the rubbishy\n",
      "trappings of wealth. What can you know of the beauty that lies in quietness and\n",
      "natural simplicity? This is a consequence of your refusal to study properly.’\n",
      "‘Your rebuke is, of course, justified, Father,’ Bao-yu replied promptly, ‘but then I\n",
      "have never really understood what it was the ancients meant by “natural”.’\n",
      "The literary gentlemen, who had observed a vein of mulish?ness in Bao-yu which\n",
      "boded trouble, were surprised by the seeming na?veté of this reply.\n",
      "‘Why, fancy not knowing what “natural” means -- you who have such a good\n",
      "understanding of so much else! “Natural” is that which is of nature, that is to say,\n",
      "that which is produced by nature as opposed to that which is produced by human\n",
      "\f",
      "artifice.’\n",
      "‘There you are, you see!’ said Bao-yu. ‘A farm set down in the middle of a place like\n",
      "this is obviously the product of human artifice. There are no neighbouring villages, no\n",
      "distant prospects of city walls; the mountain at the back doesn’t belong to any\n",
      "system; there is no pagoda rising from some tree-hid monastery in the hills above;\n",
      "there is no bridge below leading to a near-by market town. It sticks up out of\n",
      "nowhere, in total isolation from everything else. It isn’t even a par?ticularly\n",
      "remarkable view—not nearly so “natural” in either form or spirit as those other\n",
      "places we have seen. The bam?boos in those other places may have been planted by\n",
      "human hand and the streams diverted out of their natural courses, but there was no\n",
      "appearance of artifice. That’s why, when the ancients use the term “natural” I have\n",
      "my doubts about what they really meant. For example, when they speak of a “natural\n",
      "painting”, I can’t help wondering if they are not referring to precisely that forcible\n",
      "interference with the landscape to which I object: putting hills where they are not\n",
      "meant to be, and that sort of thing. However great the skill with which this is done,\n",
      "the results are never quite …”\n",
      "His discourse was cut short by an outburst of rage from Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘Take that boy out of here!’\n",
      "Bao-yu fled.\n",
      "‘Come back!’\n",
      "He returned.\n",
      "‘You still have to make a couplet on this place. If it isn’t satisfactory, you will find\n",
      "yourself reciting it to the tune of a slapped face!’\n",
      "Bao-yu stood quivering with fright and for some moments was unable to say\n",
      "anything. At last he recited the following couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Emergent buds swell where the washerwoman soaks her cloth.\n",
      "A fresh tang rises where the cress-gatherer fills his pannier.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng shook his head:\n",
      "‘Worse and worse.’\n",
      "He led them out of the ‘village’ and round the foot of the hill:\n",
      "through flowers and foliage,\n",
      "by rock and rivulet,\n",
      "past rose-crowned pergolas\n",
      "and rose-twined trellises,\n",
      "through small pavilions\n",
      "embowered in peonies,\n",
      "\f",
      "where scent of sweet-briers stole,\n",
      "or pliant plantains waved –\n",
      "until they came to a place where a musical murmur of water issued from a cave in\n",
      "the rock. The cave was half-veiled by a green curtain of creeper, and the water below\n",
      "was starred with bobbing blossoms.\n",
      "‘What a delightful spot!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘Very well, gentlemen.\n",
      "What are you going to call it?’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "Inevitably the literary gentlemen thought of Tao Yuan-?ming’s fisherman of Wu-ling\n",
      "and his Peach-blossom Stream.\n",
      "‘“The Wu-ling Stream”,’ said one of them. ‘The name is ready-made for this place.\n",
      "No need to look further than that.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng laughed:\n",
      "‘The same trouble again, I am afraid. It is the name of a real place. In any case, it is\n",
      "too hackneyed.’\n",
      "‘All right,’ said the others good-humouredly. ‘In that case simply call it “Refuge of\n",
      "the Qins”.’ Their minds still ran on the Peach-blossom Stream and its hidden paradise.\n",
      "‘That’s even more inappropriate!’ said Bao-yu. ‘“Refuge of the Qins” would imply\n",
      "that the people here were fugitives from tyranny. How can we possibly call it that? I\n",
      "suggest “Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour”.’\n",
      "‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. He looked inside the grotto and asked Cousin Zhen if\n",
      "there were any boats.\n",
      "‘Four punts for lotus-gathering and one for pleasure are on order,’ said Cousin Zhen,\n",
      "‘but they haven’t finished making them yet.’\n",
      "‘What a pity we cannot go through!’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘There is a very steep path over the top which would take us there,’ said Cousin\n",
      "Zhen, and proceeded to lead the way.\n",
      "The others scrambled up after him, clinging to creepers and leaning on tree-trunks as\n",
      "they went. When, having descended more, they had regained the stream it was wide\n",
      "and deep once and distorted by many anfractuosities. The fallen blossoms seemed to\n",
      "be even more numerous and the waters on whose surface they floated even more\n",
      "limpid than they had been on the side they had just come from. The weeping willows\n",
      "which lined both banks were here and there diversified with peach and apricot trees\n",
      "whose interlacing branches made little worlds of stillness and serenity beneath them.\n",
      "Suddenly, through the green of the willows, they glimpsed the scarlet balustrade of a\n",
      "wooden bridge whose sloping ramps led to a flat central span high above the water.\n",
      "When they had crossed it, they found a choice of paths leading to different parts of\n",
      "the garden. Ahead was an airy building with roofs of tile, whose elegant surrounding\n",
      "wall was of grey-plastered brick pierced by ornamental grilles made of semi-circular\n",
      "\f",
      "tiles laid together in openwork patterns. The wall was so constructed that outcrops\n",
      "of rock from the garden’s ‘master mountain’ appeared to run through it in several\n",
      "places into the courtyard inside.\n",
      "‘This building seems rather out of place here,’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "But as he entered the gate the source of his annoyance dis?appeared; for a miniature\n",
      "mountain of rock, whose many holes and fissures, worn through it by weathering or\n",
      "the wash of waters, bestowed on it a misleading appearance of fragile delicacy,\n",
      "towered up in front of him and combined with the many smaller rocks of various\n",
      "shapes and sizes which sur?rounded it to efface from their view every vestige of the\n",
      "build?ing they had just been looking at.\n",
      "Not a single tree grew in this enclosure, only plants and herbs:\n",
      "some aspired as vines,\n",
      "some crept humbly on the ground;\n",
      "some grew down from the tops of rocks,\n",
      "some upwards from their feet;\n",
      "some hung from the eaves in waving trails of green,\n",
      "some clung to pillars in circling bands of gold;\n",
      "some had blood-red berries,\n",
      "some had golden flowers.\n",
      "And from every flower and every plant and every herb wafted the most exquisite and\n",
      "incomparable fragrances.\n",
      "Jia Zheng could not help but admire:\n",
      "‘Charming! But what are they all?’\n",
      "‘Wild-fig’ and ‘wistaria’ was all the literary gentlemen would venture.\n",
      "‘But surely,’ Jia Zheng objected, ‘wild-fig and wisteria do not have this delectable\n",
      "fragrance?’\n",
      "‘They certainly don’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are wild-fig and wisteria among the\n",
      "plants growing here, but the ones with the fragrance are pollia and birthwort and --\n",
      "yes, I think those are orchids of some kind. That one over there is probably actinidia.\n",
      "The red flowers are, of course, rue, the “herb of grace”, and the green ones must be\n",
      "green-flag. A lot of these rare plants are mentioned in Li sao and Wen xuan,\n",
      "particularly in the Poetical Descriptions of the Three Capitals by Zuo Si. For example,\n",
      "in his Description of the Wu Capital he has\n",
      "\n",
      "agastache, eulalia,\n",
      "and harsh-smelling ginger-bush,\n",
      "cord-flower, cable-flower,\n",
      "centaury and purplestrife,\n",
      "\f",
      "stone-sail and water-pine\n",
      "and sweet-scented eglantine...\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there are\n",
      "\n",
      "amaranth, xanthoxylon,\n",
      "anemone, phellopteron...\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in the Description of the Shu Capital. Of course, after all these centuries\n",
      "nobody really knows what all those names stand for. They apply them quite\n",
      "arbitrarily to whatever seem to fit the description, and gradually all of them—’\n",
      "Once more an angry shout from his father cut him short:\n",
      "‘Who asked for your opinion?’\n",
      "Bao-yu shrank back and said no more.\n",
      "Observing that there were balustraded loggias on either side of the court, Jia Zheng\n",
      "led his party through one of them towards the building at the rear. It was a cool,\n",
      "five-frame gallery with a low, roofed verandah running round it on all sides. The\n",
      "window-lattices were green and tile walls freshly painted. It was a building of quite\n",
      "another order of elegance from the ones they had so far visited.\n",
      "‘Anyone who sat sipping tea and playing the qin to himself on this verandah would\n",
      "have no need to burn incense if he wanted sweet smells for his inspiration,’ said Jia\n",
      "Zheng dreamily. ‘So unexpectedly beautiful a place calls for a specially beautiful\n",
      "name to adorn it.’\n",
      "‘What could be better than “Dewy Orchids”?’ said the literary gentleman.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘That would do for the name. Now what about the couplet?’\n",
      "‘I have thought of a couplet,’ said one of the gentlemen. ‘Tell me all of you what\n",
      "you think of it:\n",
      "\n",
      "A musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard.\n",
      "A sweet aroma of galingale floats over the moonlit island.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not bad,’ said the others. ‘But why “sunset courtyard”?’\n",
      "‘I was thinking of that line in the old poem,’ said the man:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The garden’s gillyflowers at sunset weep.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, you have already got “dewy” in the name. I thought the “sunset weeping”\n",
      "would go with it rather well.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Feeble! Feeble!’ cried the rest.\n",
      "‘I’ve thought of a couplet, too,’ said one of the others. ‘Let me have your opinion of\n",
      "it:\n",
      "\n",
      "Down garden walks a fragrant breeze caresses beds of melilot.\n",
      "By courtyard walls a brilliant moon illumines golden orchises.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng stroked his beard, and his lips were observed to move as though he was on\n",
      "the point of proposing a couplet of his own. Suddenly, looking up, he caught sight of\n",
      "Bao-yu skulking behind the others, too scared to speak.\n",
      "‘What’s the matter with you?’ he bellowed at the unfortu?nate boy. ‘You are ready\n",
      "enough with your opinions when they are not wanted. Speak up! —Or are you\n",
      "waiting for a written invitation?’\n",
      "‘I can see no “musk” or “moonlight” or “islands” in this place,’ said Bao-yu, ‘If we\n",
      "are to make couplets in this follow-my-leader fashion, we could turn out a couple of\n",
      "hundred of them and still have more to come.’\n",
      "‘No one’s twisting your arm,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You don’t have to use those words if\n",
      "you don’t want to.’\n",
      "‘In that case,’ said Bao-yu, ‘I suggest “The Garden of Spices” for the name; and for\n",
      "the couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "Composing amidst cardamoms, you shall make verses like flowers.\n",
      "Slumbering amidst the roses, you shall dream fragrant dreams.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We all know where you got that from,’ said Jia zheng:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Composing midst the plantains\n",
      "Green shall my verses be.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can’t give you much credit for an imitation.’\n",
      "‘Not at all!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘There is nothing wrong with imitation\n",
      "provided it is done well. After all, Li Bo’s poem “On Phoenix Terrace” is entirely based\n",
      "on Cui Hao’s “Yellow Crane Tower”, yet it is a much better poem. On reflection our\n",
      "young friend’s couplet seems more poetical and imaginative than the original.’\n",
      "‘Oh, come now!’ said Jia Zheng. But they could see he was not displeased.\n",
      "Leaving the place of many fragrances behind them, they had not advanced much\n",
      "further when they could see ahead of them a building of great magnificence which\n",
      "Jia Zheng at once identified as the main reception hall of the Residence.\n",
      "\f",
      "Roof above roof soared,\n",
      "Eye up-compelling,\n",
      "Of richly-wrought chambers\n",
      "And high winding galleries.\n",
      "Green rafts of dark pine\n",
      "Brushed the eaves’ edges.\n",
      "Milky magnolias\n",
      "Bordered the buildings.\n",
      "Gold-glinting cat-faces,\n",
      "Rainbow-hued serpents’ snouts\n",
      "Peered out or snarled down\n",
      "From cornice and finial.\n",
      "‘It is rather a showy building,’ said Jia Zheng. But the literary gentlemen reassured\n",
      "him:\n",
      "‘Although Her Grace is a person of simple and abstemious tastes, the exalted\n",
      "position she now occupies makes it only right and proper that there should be a\n",
      "certain amount of pomp in her reception. This building is in no way excessive.’\n",
      "Still advancing in the same direction, they presently found themselves at the foot of\n",
      "the white marble memorial arch which framed the approach to the hall. The pattern\n",
      "of writhing dragons protectively crouched over its uppermost horizontal was so\n",
      "pierced and fretted by the sculptor’s artistry as to resemble lacework rather than\n",
      "solid stone.\n",
      "‘What inscription do we want on this arch?’ Jia Zheng inquired.\n",
      "‘“Peng-lai’s Fairy Precincts” is the only name that would do it justice,’ said the\n",
      "literary gentlemen.\n",
      "Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing.\n",
      "The sight of this building and its arch had inspired a strange and unaccountable stir of\n",
      "emotion in Bao-yu which on reflec?tion he interpreted as a sign that he must have\n",
      "known a build?ing somewhat like this before -- though where or when he could not\n",
      "for the life of him remember. He was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded\n",
      "him of; when Jia Zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch, and\n",
      "he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composi?tion. The literary\n",
      "gentlemen, not knowing the nature of his preoccupation, supposed that his father’s\n",
      "incessant bullying had worn him out and that he had finally come to the end of his\n",
      "inspiration. They feared that further bullying might once more bring out the mulish\n",
      "streak in him, thereby provoking an explosion which would be distasteful for\n",
      "everybody. Accordingly they urged Jia Zheng to allow him a day’s grace in which to\n",
      "produce something suitable. Jia Zheng, who was secretly beginning to be\n",
      "\f",
      "apprehensive about the possible consequences of Grandmother Jia’s anxiety for her\n",
      "darling grand?son, yielded, albeit with a bad grace:\n",
      "‘Jackanapes! So even you have your off moments it seems. Well, I’ll give you a day\n",
      "to do it in. But woe betide you if you can’t produce something tomorrow! And it had\n",
      "better be something good, too, because this is the most important building in the\n",
      "garden.’\n",
      "After they had seen over the building and come out again, they stopped for a while\n",
      "on the terrace to look at a general view of the whole garden and attempted to make\n",
      "out the places they had already visited. They were surprised to find that even now\n",
      "they had covered little more than half of the whole area. Just at that moment a\n",
      "servant came up to report that someone had arrived with a message from Yu-cun.\n",
      "‘I can see that we shan’t be able to finish today,’ said Jia Zheng. However, if we go\n",
      "out by the way I said, we should at least be able to get some idea of the general\n",
      "layout.’\n",
      "He conducted them to a large bridge above a crystal curtain of rushing water. It was\n",
      "the weir through which the water from the little river which fed all the pools and\n",
      "watercourses of the garden ran into it from outside. Jia Zheng invited them to name\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is the source of the “Drenched Blossoms” stream we looked at earlier on,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu. ‘We should call it “Drenched Blossoms Weir”.’\n",
      "‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You may as well forget about your “Drenched Blossoms”,\n",
      "because we are not going to use that name!’\n",
      "Their progress continued past many unexplored features of the garden, viz:\n",
      "a summer lodge\n",
      "a straw-thatched cot\n",
      "a dry-stone wall\n",
      "a flowering arch\n",
      "a tiny temple nestling beneath a hill\n",
      "a nun’s retreat hidden in a little wood\n",
      "a straight gallery\n",
      "a crooked cave\n",
      "a square pavilion\n",
      "and a round belvedere.\n",
      "But Jia Zheng hurried past every one of them without enter?ing. However, he had\n",
      "now been walking for a very long time without a rest and was beginning to feel\n",
      "somewhat footsore; and so, when the next building appeared through the trees\n",
      "ahead, he proposed that they should go in and sit down, and led his party towards it\n",
      "\f",
      "by the quickest route possible. They had to walk round a stand of double-flowering\n",
      "ornamental peach-trees and through a circular opening in a flower-covered bamboo\n",
      "trellis. This brought them in sight of the building’s whitewashed enclosing wall and\n",
      "the contrasting green of the weeping willows which surrounded it. A roofed gallery\n",
      "ran from each side of the gate round the inner wall of the fore?court, in which a few\n",
      "rocks were scattered. On one side of it some green plantains were growing and on\n",
      "the other a weeping variety of Szechwan crab, whose pendant clusters of\n",
      "double-flowering carmine blossoms hung by stems as delicate as golden wires on the\n",
      "umbrella-shaped canopy of its boughs.\n",
      "‘What magnificent blossom!’ exclaimed the literary gentle?men. ‘One has seen\n",
      "plenty of crab-apple blossom before, but never anything as beautiful as this.’\n",
      "‘This kind is called “maiden crab”,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It comes from abroad. According\n",
      "to vulgar belief it originally came from the Land of Maidens, and that is supposed to\n",
      "be the reason why it blooms so profusely. Needless to say, it is only the ignorant sort\n",
      "of persons who hold this ridiculous belief.’\n",
      "‘It certainly has most unusual blossoms,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Who knows,\n",
      "perhaps there is something in the popular belief.’\n",
      "‘Surely,’ said Bao-yu, ‘it is much more probable that poets and painters gave it the\n",
      "name of “maiden crab” because of its rouge-like colour and delicate, drooping shape,\n",
      "and that the name was misunderstood by ignorant, literal-minded people, who made\n",
      "up this silly story to account for it.’\n",
      "‘That must be it!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Most grate?ful for the explanation!’\n",
      "While they were speaking they were at the same time arranging themselves on some\n",
      "benches in the gallery.\n",
      "‘Has anyone an original idea for a name?’ said Jia Zheng when they were all seated.\n",
      "One of them proposed ‘Storks in the Plantains’. Another suggested ‘Shimmering\n",
      "Splendour’.\n",
      "“‘Shimmering Splendour”,’ Jia Zheng and the others repeated, trying out the words.\n",
      "‘That’s good!’\n",
      "‘A lovely name!’ said Bao-yu. But a moment later he added: ‘Rather a pity, though.’\n",
      "‘Why “rather a pity”?’ they asked.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘there are both plantains and crab-apple blossom in this\n",
      "courtyard. Whoever planted them must have been thinking of “the red and the\n",
      "green”. If our name men?tions only one and leaves out the other, it will seem\n",
      "somehow inadequate.’\n",
      "‘What do you suggest, then?’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "       ‘I suggest “Fragrant Red and Lucent Green”,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That takes account\n",
      "of both of them.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Jia zheng shook his head:\n",
      "‘No, that’s no good!’\n",
      "He led them inside the building. Its interior turned out to be all corridors and alcoves\n",
      "and galleries, so that properly speaking it could hardly have been said to have rooms\n",
      "at all. The partition walls which made these divisions were of wooden panelling\n",
      "exquisitely carved in a wide variety of motifs: bats in clouds, the ‘three friends of\n",
      "winter’—pine, plum and bamboo, little figures in landscapes, birds and flowers,\n",
      "scrollwork, antique bronze shapes, ‘good luck’ and ‘long life’ characters, and many\n",
      "others. The carvings, all of them the work of master craftsmen, were beautified with\n",
      "inlays of gold, mother-o’-pearl and semi-precious stones. In addition to being\n",
      "panelled, the partitions were pierced by numerous apertures, some round, some\n",
      "square, some sun-flower-shaped, some shaped like a fleur-de-lis, some cusped, some\n",
      "fan-shaped. Shelving was concealed in the double thick?ness of the partition at the\n",
      "base of these apertures, making it possible to use them for storing books and writing\n",
      "materials and for the display of antique bronzes, vases of flowers, miniature\n",
      "tray-gardens and the like. The overall effect was at once richly colourful and, because\n",
      "of the many apertures, airy and graceful.\n",
      "The trompe-l’ail effect of these ingenious partitions had been further enhanced by\n",
      "inserting false windows and doors in them, the former covered in various pastel\n",
      "shades of gauze, the latter hung with richly-patterned damask portieres. The main\n",
      "walls were pierced with window-like perforations in the shape of zithers, swords,\n",
      "vases and other objects of virtù.\n",
      "The literary gentlemen were rapturous:\n",
      "‘Exquisite!’ they cried. ‘what marvellous workmanship!’\n",
      "Jia Zheng, after taking no more than a couple of turns inside this confusing interior,\n",
      "was already lost. To the left of him was what appeared to be a door. To the right was\n",
      "a wall with a window in it. But on raising its portiere he discovered the door to be a\n",
      "bookcase; and when, looking back, he observed— what he had not noticed before—\n",
      "that the light coming in through the silk gauze of the window illuminated a\n",
      "passage-way lead?ing to an open doorway, and began walking towards it, a party of\n",
      "gentlemen similar to his own came advancing to meet him, and he realized that he\n",
      "was walking towards a large mirror. They were able to circumvent the mirror, but\n",
      "only to find an even more bewildering choice of doorways on the other side.\n",
      "‘Come!’ said Cousin Zhen with a laugh. ‘Let me show you the way! If we go out\n",
      "here we shall be in the back courtyard. We can reach the gate of the garden much\n",
      "more easily from the back courtyard than from the front.’\n",
      "He led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed, then through a door into a\n",
      "garden full of rambler roses. Behind the rose-trellis was a stream running between\n",
      "\f",
      "green banks. The literary gentlemen were intrigued to know where the water came\n",
      "from. Cousin Zhen pointed in the direction of the weir they had visited earlier:\n",
      "‘The water comes in over that weir, then through the grotto, then under the lea of\n",
      "the north-east “mountain” to the little farm. There a channel is led off it which runs\n",
      "into the south-east corner of the garden. Then it runs round and rejoins the main\n",
      "stream here. And from here the water flows out again underneath that wall.’\n",
      "‘How very ingenious!’\n",
      "They moved on again, but soon found themselves at the foot of a tall ‘mountain’.\n",
      "‘Follow me!’ said Cousin Zhen, amused at the bewilder?ment of the others, who\n",
      "were now completely at sea as to their whereabouts. He led them round the foot of\n",
      "the ‘mountain’—and there, miraculously, was a broad, flat path and the gate by\n",
      "which they had entered, rising majestically in front of them.\n",
      "‘Well!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen. ‘This beats everything! The skill with\n",
      "which this has all been designed is quite out of this world!’\n",
      "Whereupon they all went out of the garden.\n",
      "\n",

      "Bao-yu was now longing to get back to the girls, but as no dis?missal was\n",
      "forthcoming from his father, he followed him along with the others into his study.\n",
      "Fortunately Jia Zheng suddenly recollected that Bao-yu was still with him:\n",
      "‘Well, run along then! Your grandmother will be worrying about you. I take it you’re\n",
      "not still waiting for more?’\n",
      "At last Bao-yu could withdraw. But as soon as he was in the courtyard outside, he was\n",
      "waylaid by a group of Jia Zheng’s pages who laid hands on him and prevented him\n",
      "from going.\n",
      "‘You’ve done well today, haven’t you, coming out top with all those poems? You\n",
      "have us to thank for that! Her Old Ladyship sent round several times asking about\n",
      "you, but because the Master was so pleased with you, we told her not to worry. If we\n",
      "hadn’t done that, you wouldn’t have had the chance to show off your poems!\n",
      "Everyone says they were better than all the others. What about sharing your good\n",
      "luck with us?’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed good-naturedly.\n",
      "‘All right. A string of cash each.’\n",
      "‘Who wants a measly string of cash? Give us that little purse you’re wearing!’ And\n",
      "without a ‘by your leave’ they began to despoil him, beginning with the purse and his\n",
      "fan-case, of all his trinkets, until every one of the objects he carried about him had\n",
      "been taken from him.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Now,’ they said, ‘we’ll see you back in style!’\n",
      "And closing round him, they marched him back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment in\n",
      "triumphal procession.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia had been waiting for him with some anxiety, and was naturally\n",
      "delighted to see him come in apparently none the worse for his experience.\n",
      "Soon after, when he was back in his own room, Aroma came in to pour him some tea\n",
      "and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had\n",
      "disappeared.\n",
      "‘Where have the things from your belt gone?’ she said. ‘I suppose those worthless\n",
      "pages have taken them again.’\n",
      "Dai-yu overheard her and came up to inspect. Sure enough, not one of the things\n",
      "was there.\n",
      "‘So you’ve given away that little purse I gave you? Very well, then. You needn’t\n",
      "expect me to give you anything in future, however much you want it!’\n",
      "With these words she went off to her own room in a temper, and taking up a still\n",
      "unfinished perfume sachet which she was making for him at his own request, she\n",
      "began to cut it up with her embroidery scissors. Bao-yu, observing that she was angry,\n",
      "had hurried after her—but it was too late. The sachet was already cut to pieces.\n",
      "Although it had not been finished, Bao-yu could see that the embroidery was very\n",
      "fine, and it made him angry to think of the hours and hours of work so wantonly\n",
      "destroyed. Tearing open his collar he took out the little embroidered purse which had\n",
      "all along been hanging round his neck and held it out for her to see.\n",
      "‘Look! What’s that? When have I ever given anything of yours to someone else?’\n",
      "Dai-yu knew that he must have treasured her gift to have worn it inside his clothing\n",
      "where there was no risk of its being taken from him. She regretted her over-hasty\n",
      "destruction of the sachet and hung her head in silence.\n",
      "‘You needn’t have cut it up,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know it’s only because you hate giving\n",
      "things away. Here, you can have this back too since you’re so stingy!’\n",
      "He tossed the purse into her lap and turned to go. Dai-yu burst into tears of rage, and\n",
      "picking up the little purse, attacked that too with her scissors. Bao-yu hurried back\n",
      "and caught her by the wrist.\n",
      "‘Come, cuzzy dear!’ he said with a laugh. ‘Have mercy on it!’\n",
      "Dai-yu threw down the scissors and wiped her streaming eyes.\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t blow hot and cold by turns. If you want to quarrel, let’s quarrel\n",
      "properly and have nothing to do with each other!’\n",
      "She got up on the kang in a great huff, and turning her back on him, sobbed into her\n",
      "handkerchief and affected to ignore his presence. But Bao-yu got up beside her, and\n",
      "with many soothing words and affectionate endearments humbly en?treated her\n",
      "\f",
      "forgiveness.\n",
      "Meanwhile in the front room Grandmother Jia was calling loudly for her beloved\n",
      "grandson.\n",
      "‘Master Bao is in the back with Miss Lin,’ they told her.\n",
      "‘Ah, good!’ said the old lady. ‘Let us leave them alone together, then. it will be a\n",
      "nice relaxation for him after the strain of being so long with his father -- as long as\n",
      "they don’t argue.’\n",
      "‘Yes, milady.’\n",
      "Finding herself unable to shake off Bao-yu’s attentions, Dai-yu got up from the kang:\n",
      "‘I can see you are determined not to let me live in peace. I shall just have to go\n",
      "elsewhere.’ And off she went.\n",
      "‘Wherever you go, I shall go with you,’ said Bao-yu, taking up the purse and\n",
      "beginning to fasten it on again. But Dai-yu snatched it away from him.\n",
      "‘First you say you don’t want it, and now you are trying to put it on again. You\n",
      "ought to be ashamed of yourself!’\n",
      "Her anger dissolved in a little explosion of laughter.\n",
      "‘Dearest cuzzy!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Won’t you please make me another sachet?’\n",
      "‘That depends on whether I feel in the mood or not,’ said Dai-yu.\n",
      "Chatting together they went out of the room and round to Lady Wang’s apartment.\n",
      "Bao-chai was there already. They found everyone there in a state of great excitement\n",
      "owing to the fact that Jia Qiang had lust arrived back from Soochow with the twelve\n",
      "child-actresses he had purchased there, to?gether with their instructors and all the\n",
      "costumes and proper?ties they would use in performing their plays.\n",
      "Aunt Xue had now moved to a quiet, secluded apartment m the north-east corner of\n",
      "the mansion, and Pear-tree Court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama\n",
      "school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges. A number\n",
      "of female members of the Rong-guo staff who had some previous training in singing\n",
      "and acting—they were all grey-haired old women by now—were put in charge of the\n",
      "domestic arrangements. Pay and expenses and the provision of whatever was\n",
      "needed for the maintenance of the troupe was to remain in the hands of Jia Qiang,\n",
      "who was also to keep the accounts.\n",
      "Simultaneously with this arrival, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife had come to announce that the\n",
      "selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns—twelve Buddhist and twelve\n",
      "Taoist—had been successfully accomplished. Even the twenty-four little habits they\n",
      "would wear had now arrived brand-new from the tailor. But that was not all. It\n",
      "appeared that a young lady who had entered the church under half vows as an\n",
      "‘unshaved nun’ might be persuaded to loin them.\n",
      "‘She comes of a highly educated official family from Soo?chow,’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife\n",
      "\f",
      "told them. ‘As a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of\n",
      "“proxy novices” in the hope that she would get better; but all was of no avail. In the\n",
      "end there was nothing for it but for the young lady to take the great step herself --\n",
      "though as a lay sister, without the shaving of hair. And sure enough her illness got\n",
      "better immediately. She is now eighteen years of age. Her name in religion is\n",
      "“Adamantina”. She lost both her parents some time ago and has only two old nurses\n",
      "and a little maid to look after her. She’s said to be a great clerk and knows all the\n",
      "classics by heart. What’s more, she is a very handsome young woman. She moved\n",
      "into this area with her teacher a year ago because of some relic of Guanyin she had\n",
      "heard about and because there are some old Sanskrit texts here that she wanted to\n",
      "look at. She has been living ever since in the Sakyamuni Convent outside the west\n",
      "gate. Her teacher was a great authority on the “Primordial” branch of the Tantra. She\n",
      "died last winter. As she lay dying she told Adamantina that she was not to go back\n",
      "home, but to wait here quietly for a call. That is why she stays on here and has never\n",
      "taken her teacher’s coffin back.’\n",
      "‘We should certainly take advantage of this to invite her here,’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘We have tried asking her,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, ‘but the reply she gives is that\n",
      "noble households are given to trampling on other people’s feelings, and she is not\n",
      "disposed to be trampled on.’\n",
      "‘She is bound to be rather a ‘proud young woman, coming from a family of\n",
      "officials,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t see why we shouldn’t make out a written invitation\n",
      "and request her formally.’\n",
      "Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife promised to see this done and hurried off to ask one of the\n",
      "professional letter-writers in the family’s employment to make out a formal invitation.\n",
      "Next day a carriage was sent round to fetch Adamantina to the mansion in a style\n",
      "befitting a young gentlewoman of tender suscepti?bilities.\n",
      "But as to what happened thereafter: that will be disclosed in the ensuing chapter.\n",

      "\n",

      "Just at that moment a servant came in to say that the workmen needed some gauze\n",
      "for pasting on window-lattices and asked Xi-feng if she would unlock the storeroom\n",
      "for them. Then another servant arrived and asked her to take charge of some gold\n",
      "and silver plate. Lady Wang and her maids also seemed to be fully occupied.\n",
      "Thoughtful Bao-chai pointed out to Bao-yu and the rest that they were getting in\n",
      "everyone’s way, and at her suggestion they all adjourned to Ying-chun’s room.\n",
      "Lady Wang’s business in fact continued unabated until well into the tenth month. By\n",
      "then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the various buildings in the\n",
      "garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques; supplies of\n",
      "livestock—storks, deer, rabbits, chicken, geese, and so forth--had been purchased\n",
      "and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared; Jia Qiang’s\n",
      "young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces;\n",
      "and the little Buddhist and Taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their\n",
      "respective liturgies. Jia Zheng could now feel reasonably well satisfied that things\n",
      "were as they should be, and invited Grandmother Jia into the garden for a final\n",
      "\f",
      "inspection in which she was to suggest any last-minute alterations that might still be\n",
      "needed. When not the slightest shadow of an imperfection could any more be found,\n",
      "he at last sent in his written application for a Visitation. The Gracious Reply arrived\n",
      "on the very same day:\n",
      "\n",
      "Her Grace will make a Family Visitation next year on the fif?teenth of the first month,\n",
      "being the Festival of Lanterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The receipt of this reply seemed to throw the Jia family into an even greater frenzy of\n",
      "preparation than before, so that even its New Year celebrations that year were\n",
      "somewhat scamped.\n",
      "In no time at all the Festival of Lanterns seemed to be almost upon them. On the\n",
      "eighth of the first month a eunuch came from the Palace to inspect the layout of the\n",
      "Separate Residence and to establish where the Imperial Concubine would ‘change\n",
      "her clothes’, where she would sit to converse with her family, where she would\n",
      "receive their obeisances, where she would feast them, and where she would retire to\n",
      "when she wanted to rest. The eunuch Chief of Security also arrived with his eunuch\n",
      "minions and supervised a great deal of sealing-up and screening-off everywhere. He\n",
      "also instructed the members of the household in the regulations for leaving and\n",
      "entering, serving food and bringing messages, all of which had to be done through\n",

      "Meanwhile Jia She and the consortium were putting up ornamental lanterns\n",
      "everywhere in the gardens and fixing fireworks in place for a pyrotechnic display in\n",
      "honour of the visit. By the fourteenth everything was finally ready. No one in the Jia\n",
      "household, whether master or servant, had a wink of sleep throughout the whole of\n",
      "that night.\n",
      "By five o’clock next morning, when it was still dark night outside, all those in the\n",
      "family from Grandmother Jia down?wards who held any sort of rank or title were\n",
      "already dressed in full court rig. In the Separate Residence\n",
      "    painted phoenix and coiling dragon\n",
      "         flapped and fluttered on drapes and curtains,\n",
      "         gold and silver-work gleamed and glinted,\n",

      "Jia She and the other menfolk drew themselves up outside the west gate.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia stood outside the main gate with the female members of the family.\n",
      "They noticed that the ends of the street and the entrances of the side-streets leading\n",
      "into it had all been screened off.\n",
      "Just as they were beginning to grow impatient, a eunuch trotted up on horseback\n",
      "and was stopped and questioned by Jia Zheng\n",
      "‘Oh, you’re much too early yet!’ said the eunuch. ‘Her Grace won’t be taking her\n",
      "lunch until one o’clock; then at two she goes to divine service in the Bao-ling chapel.\n",
      "Five o’clock, when she has an appointment to feast with the Emperor in the Da-ming\n",

      "‘Well,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when she heard this, ‘you and Aunt Wang\n",
      "may as well go back to your room. You will be able to come back later on nearer the\n",
      "time.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and the other ladies took her advice and went off, leaving Xi-feng to\n",
      "attend to whatever still needed doing in the garden. Under her direction some of the\n",
      "stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine, while other\n",
      "servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden’s many\n",
      "lanterns with.\n",
      "Suddenly, as afternoon drew towards evening, a clatter of many hooves was heard,\n",
      "and after a short pause, a group of ten or so eunuchs rushed in out of breath,\n",
      "clapping their hands as they ran. This was taken by the other eunuchs as a sign that\n",
      "the Imperial Concubine was on her way, for they at once jumped up and hurried to\n",
      "their prearranged places. The family, too, took up their positions once more, Jia She\n",
      "and the menfolk outside the west gate and Grandmother Jia with the ladies outside\n",
      "the main entrance.\n",
      "For a long time there was total silence. Then a couple of eunuchs on horseback came\n",
      "riding very, very slowly up to the west gate. Dismounting, they led their horses out of\n",
      "sight behind the cloth screens, then returned to take up their stand at the sides of\n",
      "the road, half-facing towards the west. After a considerable wait, two more eunuchs\n",
      "arrived and went through the same motions as the first pair. Then another two, and\n",
      "then another, until in all some ten pairs were standing at the sides of the road, their\n",
      "faces turned expectantly towards the west.\n",
      "Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine’s procession\n",
      "\f",
      "at last came in sight.\n",
      "First came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners.\n",
      "Then several more pairs with ceremonial pheasant-feather fans.\n",
      "Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special ‘palace incense’ was\n",
      "burning.\n",
      "Next came a great gold-coloured ‘seven-phoenix’ umbrella of state, hanging from its\n",
      "curve-topped shaft like a great drooping bell-flower. In its shadow was borne the\n",
      "Imperial Concubine’s travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes.\n",
      "Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered\n",
      "handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items.\n",
      "Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped palanquin\n",
      "with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders\n",
      "of eight eunuch bearers.\n",
      "As Grandmother Jia and the rest dropped to their knees eunuchs rushed up and\n",
      "helped them to get up again. The palanquin passed through the great gate and made\n",
      "for the entrance of a courtyard on the east side of the forecourt. There a eunuch\n",
      "knelt beside it and invited the Imperial Concubine to descend and ‘change her\n",
      "clothes’. The bearers carried it through the entrance and set it down just inside the\n",
      "courtyard. The other eunuchs then withdrew, leaving Yuan-chun’s ladies-in-waiting to\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yuan-chun passed beneath it into the room that had been prepared for her, then,\n",
      "having ‘changed her clothes’, came out again and stepped back into the palanquin,\n",
      "which was now borne into the garden.\n",
      "Her first impression was a confused one of curling drifts of incense smoke and\n",
      "gleaming colours. There were lanterns everywhere, and soft strains of music. She\n",
      "seemed to be enter?ing a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and\n",
      "luxury and delight. Looking at it from the depths of her palanquin she shook her head\n",
      "a little sadly and sighed:\n",
      "‘Oh dear, this is all so extravagant!’\n",
      "At that moment a eunuch knelt beside the palanquin and invited the Imperial\n",
      "Concubine to proceed by boat. Stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an\n",
      "expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon. Lanterns of\n",
      "\f",
      "crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks, their silvery\n",
      "radiance giving the white marble, in the semi-darkness, the appearance of gleaming\n",
      "drifts of snow. Because of the season, the willows and apricot trees above them were\n",
      "bare and leafless; but in place of leaves they were festooned with hundreds of tiny\n",
      "lanterns, and flowers of gauze, rice-paper and bast had been fastened to the tips of\n",
      "their branches. Other lanterns made of shells and feathers, in the form of lotuses,\n",
      "water-lilies, ducks and egrets floated on the surface of the water below. It would\n",
      "have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the\n",
      "more brilliant spectacle. Together they combined to make a fairyland of jewelled light.\n",
      "And to these visual delights were added the many charming miniature gardens on\n",
      "the barge itself—not to mention its pearl blinds, embroidered curtains, and the\n",
      "carved and painted oars and paddle with which it was furnished. While Yuan-chun\n",
      "was still admiring all this, her boat approached a landing-stage in a grotto, above\n",
      "which hung a lantern-sign inscribed with these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "SMARTWEED BANK AND FLOWERY HARBOUR\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone’s Note to Reader:\n",
      "You may find it surprising that ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’, ‘The Phoenix\n",
      "Dance’ and those other names, which in the last chapter we showed Bao-yu\n",
      "inventing in an aptitude test imposed at random by his father, should actually have\n",
      "been used on the occasion of the Imperial Concubine’s first visit to her family. Surely,\n",
      "you will say, a household as long established and highly cultivated as the Jias’ must\n",
      "have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon\n",
      "for such important purposes as these? These were no wealthy parvenus whose\n",
      "vulgarity would be satisfied with the effusions of a gifted schoolboy for filling in the\n",
      "gaps where inscription are felt to be de rigueur.\n",
      "The answer lies in Yuan-chun’s special relationship with Bao-yu. Before Yuan-chun\n",
      "entered the Palace, she had been brought up mainly by Grandmother Jia; and when\n",
      "Bao-yu appeared on the scene (at a time when his mother was already middle-aged\n",
      "and unlikely to have any more children) she had lavished all her affection on this little\n",
      "brother who spent all his time with her at their grandmother’s. When he was still a\n",
      "very little boy of only three or four and had not yet begun his schooling, she had\n",
      "taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters.\n",
      "Although they were brother and sister, their relationship was more like that of a\n",
      "mother and her son; and even after she entered the Palace, she was always writing\n",
      "letters to her father and her male cousins in which she expressed concern for the\n",
      "little boy who was so constantly in her thoughts. ‘I beg you to be most careful in your\n",
      "\f",
      "handling of this child,’ she once wrote. ‘If you are not strict with him, he will never\n",
      "grow up into a proper man. But if you are too strict, you may endanger his health and\n",
      "cause Grandmother to be distressed.’\n",
      "When, some months previously, Jia Zheng received a favourable report from Bao-yu’s\n",
      "schoolmaster in which his creative ability was commended, he had used the visit to\n",
      "the garden as a means of trying him out. The results were not, of course, what a\n",
      "great writer would have produced in similar circumstances, but at least they were not\n",
      "unworthy of the family’s literary traditions, and Jia Zheng resolved that his daughter\n",
      "should see them, so that she might know that the progress made by her beloved\n",
      "younger brother fully came up to the measure of those ardent hopes she had so\n",
      "often expressed in her letters.\n",
      "—Incidentally, Bao-yu had, in the intervening time, supplied many more inscriptions\n",
      "for the places they had been unable to cover on that first occasion.\n",
      "Stone\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yuan-chun saw the words ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’ she\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "‘Surely “Flowery Harbour” is enough by itself? Why “Smartweed Bank” as well?’\n",
      "At once an attendant eunuch disembarked and rushed like the wind to tell Jia Zheng,\n",
      "who\n",
      "immediately gave orders to have the inscription changed.\n",
      "By this time the barge had drawn alongside the bank and Yuan-chun disembarked\n",
      "and\n",
      "stepped once more into her palanquin. Soon she was borne into that part of the\n",
      "garden where\n",
      "‘Roof above roof soared\n",
      "Eye up-compelling ...’\n",
      "and saw the white marble memorial arch which had so strongly affected Bao-yu\n",
      "when he first saw it. It now bore a temporary inscription:\n",
      "\n",
      "PRECINCT OF THE CELESTIAL VISITANT\n",
      "\n",
      "Yuan-chun gave orders that the words ‘The House of Reunion’ should be substituted.\n",
      "She now ascended the terraces and entered the open-fronted hall of audience.\n",
      "From a ring of cressets against the night sky\n",
      "a fragrant scatter dropped on the flagstones;\n",
      "and candelabra like fiery fir-trees\n",
      "gleamed festively in the gilded casements;\n",
      "\f",
      "         there were blinds looped and fringed like a prawn’s belly,\n",
      "         there were rugs in rows like an otter’s offering;\n",
      "         and tripods smoked with perfumes of musk and borneol,\n",
      "         and behind the throne waved fans of pheasant feathers.\n",
      "It was a scene no whit less splendid than that fairy palace of which the poet sings:\n",
      "\n",
      "The abode of the Princess has cassia halls and orchid chambers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How is it that this place has no name?’ asked Yuan-chun.\n",
      "‘This is the principal hall of the Residence, Your Grace. The family dared not give it a\n",
      "name without consulting you first.\n",
      "Her Grace nodded.\n",
      "A eunuch Master of Ceremonies now requested her to seat herself upon a chair of\n",
      "state in order to receive the obeisances of her family. Music struck up from a band\n",
      "stationed at either side of the steps as two eunuchs conducted Jia She and Jia Zheng\n",
      "onto the terrace beneath. The other male members of the family ranged themselves\n",
      "behind them and the whole party then began to advance in formation up the steps\n",
      "into the hall.\n",
      "‘Excused!’\n",
      "A lady-in-waiting came forward and uttered this single word as an indication that the\n",
      "Imperial Concubine wished to absolve them from the ceremonial, and with a slight\n",
      "bow they with?drew.\n",
      "It was now the turn of Grandmother Jia (‘the Dowager Lady Jia of Rong-guo’ they\n",
      "called her) and the ladies of the household to make their obeisance. The eunuchs led\n",
      "them up the steps at the east side of the terrace on to the platform in front of the\n",
      "hall, where they ranged themselves in order of precedence.\n",
      "Once more the lady-in-waiting pronounced the absolving word and they, too,\n",
      "withdrew.\n",
      "After tea had been offered three times as etiquette prescribed, the Imperial\n",
      "Concubine descended from her throne, the music stopped, and she withdrew into a\n",
      "side room to ‘change her clothes’. A less formal carriage than the imperial palanquin\n",
      "had been prepared which carried her from the garden to her family’s own quarters.\n",
      "Inside Grandmother Jia’s apartment Yuan-chun became a grandchild once more and\n",
      "knelt down to make her kotow. But Grandmother Jia and the rest knelt down too and\n",
      "prevented her from prostrating herself. She ended up, clinging to Grandmother Jia by\n",
      "one hand and Lady Wang by the other, while the tears streamed down her face, too\n",
      "overcome to say anything. All three of them, in fact, though there was so much they\n",
      "wanted to say, seemed quite incapable of speech and stood there holding each other\n",
      "\f",
      "and sobbing, apparently un?able to stop. The others present— Lady Xing, Li Wan,\n",
      "Wang Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun—stood round them weeping silently.\n",
      "No one spoke a word.\n",
      "Yuan-chun at last restrained her sobs and forced a smile to her tear-stained face:\n",
      "‘It hasn’t been easy, winning this chance of coming back among you after all those\n",
      "years since I was first walled up in That Place. Now that we are seeing each other at\n",
      "last, we ought to talk and be cheerful, not waste all the time crying! I shall be leaving\n",
      "again in no time at all, and Heaven only knows when I shall have another chance of\n",
      "seeing you!’\n",
      "At this point she broke down once more and had to be comforted by Lady Xing.\n",
      "When she had composed herself, Grandmother Jia made her sit down while the\n",
      "members of the family came forward one at a time to greet her and say a few words.\n",
      "This was an occasion for further tears. Then the senior menservants of both the\n",
      "Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions assembled in the courtyard outside and paid their\n",
      "respects. They were followed by the women servants and maids, who were allowed\n",
      "to come inside the room to make their kotow.\n",
      "Yuan-chun asked why her Aunt Xue and her cousins Bao-chai and Lin Dai-yu were\n",
      "missing.\n",
      "‘Relations outside the Jia family are not allowed to see you without a special\n",
      "invitation, dear,’ Lady Wang told her.\n",
      "Yuan-chun asked them to be invited in immediately, and Aunt Xue and the two girls\n",
      "arrived after a few moments. They would have kotowed to her in accordance with\n",
      "court etiquette had not Yuan-chun hurriedly excused them from doing so. The three\n",
      "of them went up to her, and niece and aunt exchanged news of the years that had\n",
      "elapsed since they last met.\n",
      "Next Lutany and the other maids who had accompanied Yuan-chun into the Palace\n",
      "came forward to make their kotows to Grandmother Jia. The old lady at once\n",
      "motioned to them to rise and gave instructions to her own servants to entertain\n",
      "them in another room.\n",
      "The senior eunuchs and the ladies-in-waiting were now led off by members of the\n",
      "staffs of Jia She’s household and the Ning-guo mansion to be entertained elsewhere,\n",
      "leaving only three or four very junior eunuchs in attendance. Yuan-chun was at last\n",
      "free to chat informally with her mother and the other female members of her family\n",
      "and learned for the first time about many personal and domestic events that had\n",
      "occurred in the household since she left it.\n",
      "Then there was her interview with Jia Zheng, which had to take place with her father\n",
      "standing outside the door-curtain of the room in which she was sitting. Now that she\n",
      "was the Emperor’s woman, this was the nearest to her he could ever hope to get.\n",
      "\f",
      "The sense of deprivation struck home to Yuan-?chun as she addressed him through\n",
      "the curtain.\n",
      "‘What is the use of all this luxury and splendour,’ she said bitterly, ‘if I am to be\n",
      "always separated from those I love —denied the tenderness which even the poorest\n",
      "peasant who seasons his bread with salt and pickles and dresses in hempen\n",
      "homespun is free to enjoy?’\n",
      "With tears in his eyes the good man delivered the following little speech to the\n",

      "That a poor and undistinguished household such as ours should have produced, as it\n",

      "ancestral line must be attributable to the concentration in your single person of the\n",
      "quintessences of all that is most admirable in celestial and terrestrial nature and the\n",
      "accumulated merit of many generations of our forebears, and is an honour and a\n",
      "blessing in which my wife and I are proud to be participators.\n",
      "‘Our beloved Emperor, who embodies in his own Sacred Person those life-giving\n",
      "forces which are always invisibly at work in the natural cosmos, has showered down\n",
      "upon his grate?ful subjects a gracious kindness unprecedented in the annals of\n",
      "recorded history—a kindness which even the expenditure of our life’s blood to the\n",
      "veriest ultimate drop would be wholly inadequate to repay and which only the most\n",
      "unremitting pains and unswerving loyalty in the discharge of those duties to which it\n",

      "‘It is our earnest prayer that His Sacred Majesty may con?tinue long to reign over\n",
      "us, a blessing to all his peoples; and that Your Grace should feel no anxiety\n",
      "concerning the welfare of my wife and myself during our now declining years, but\n",
      "should rather cherish and sustain your own precious person, in order to be the better\n",
      "able to serve His Sacred Majesty with care and diligence, seeking by that service to\n",
      "be worthy of the tender regard and loving favour which he has been graciously\n",
      "pleased to bestow upon you.’\n",
      "To this formal speech the Imperial Concubine made a formal reply:\n",
      "‘Sir. It is of course desirable that you should exercise the utmost diligence when\n",
      "engaged upon business of state, but it is to be hoped that you will take sufficient care\n",
      "of your own well-being whenever not so engaged, and will under no circumstances\n",
      "vex yourself with anxiety on our behalf.’\n",
      "‘The inscriptions at present displayed on the pavilions and other buildings in the\n",
      "garden were composed by Bao-yu,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If there are any places in the\n",
      "garden which particularly take your fancy, we hope you will name them for us.’\n",
      "\f",
      "The news that Bao-yu could already compose inscriptions evoked a smile of pleasure.\n",

      "Jia Zheng withdrew.\n",
      "‘But why is Bao-yu not with us?’ she added.\n",
      "‘The menfolk of the family are not supposed to see you without special reason,’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia explained.\n",
      "Yuan-hun at once gave orders that he should be summoned, and presently he was\n",
      "brought in by one of the little eunuchs. When he had completed his kotow she called\n",
      "him over, and stretching Out her arms, drew him to her bosom where she held him in\n",
      "a close embrace, stroking his hair and fondling the back of his neck.\n",
      "‘What a lot you have grown---!’ she began. But the rest was drowned in a flood of\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "You-shi and Xi-feng now approached to announce that a feast awaited her in the\n",
      "Separate Residence. Yuan-chun rose to her feet, and bidding Bao-yu lead the way,\n",
      "walked with the rest of the company to the gate of the garden. There, in the light of\n",
      "the innumerable lanterns, all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her\n",
      "entertainment. The route led through ‘The Phoenix Dance’, ‘Fragrant Red and Lucent\n",
      "Green’, ‘The Hopeful Sign’, and ‘The Garden of Spices’. This time the inspection was\n",
      "no perfunctory one. Yuan-chun insisted on looking inside the buildings and climbing\n",
      "up and down their stairs. She crossed bridges, she walked round each tiny ‘mountain’,\n",
      "and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view. All the\n",
      "places she visited were so beautifully furnished and so ingeniously planned, that she\n",
      "could not conceal her delight. But there was a faint note of censure in her praise\n",
      "‘You really mustn’t be so extravagant in future. This is far too much!’\n",
      "They had now come to the main hall. Having first decreed that they should dispense\n",
      "with court etiquette—which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting\n",
      "down at all—she took her place at the main table, while Grandmother Jia and the\n",
      "rest sat at little tables on either side, and You-shi, Li Wan and Xi-feng moved to and\n",
      "fro, dispensing wine and helping with the service.\n",
      "While they were still drinking, Yuan-chun sent for writing materials, and taking up a\n",
      "brush, began in her own hand to write out some names for the parts of the garden\n",
      "she had liked the best. The name she chose for the garden as a whole was ‘Prospect\n",
      "Garden’, and she composed the following couplet to go outside the main reception\n",
      "hall:\n",
      "\n",
      "For all earth to share, his great compassion has been extended,\n",
      "that children and humble folk may gratefully rejoice.\n",
      "For all ages to admire, his noble institutions have been promoted,\n",
      "\f",
      "that people of every land and clime may joyfully exult.\n",
      "\n",
      "She altered ‘The Phoenix Dance’ to ‘The Naiad’s House’, and she renamed ‘Fragrant\n",
      "Red and Lucent Green’ ‘Crimson Joys and Green Delights’ and named the building in\n",
      "its grounds ‘The House of Green Delights’. The buildings belonging to ‘The Garden of\n",
      "Spices’ she named ‘All-spice Court’. Those of ‘The Hopeful Sign’ she gave the name\n",
      "‘Washbrook Farm’. The main hall became ‘Prospect Hall’ with separate names for the\n",
      "high galleries on either side: ‘The Painted Chamber’ for the one on the east side, ‘The\n",
      "Fragrance Gallery’ for the one on the west. Among the other names which she\n",
      "invented for various other parts of the garden were:\n",
      "‘The Smartweed Loggia’, ‘The Lotus Pavilion’, ‘Amaryllis Eyot’, and ‘Duckweed\n",
      "Island’. She also composed inscrip?tions for some of its prospects, including\n",
      "‘Pear-tree blossom in springtime rain’, ‘Paulownia leaves in autumn wind’, and\n",
      "‘Rushes in the winter snow’. The couplets composed by Bao-yu were to remain\n",
      "unaltered.\n",
      "Having finished with the inscriptions, she proceeded to write out the following\n",
      "quatrain of her own composition:\n",
      "\n",
      "Embracing hills and streams, with skill they wrought:\n",
      "Their work at last is to perfection brought.\n",

      "‘There!’ she said with a smile to the girls. ‘I’m no genius, as you all well know, and I\n",
      "have never been much of a poet. But tonight I thought I really must write something,\n",
      "for this beautiful garden’s sake. Later on, when I have more time to spare, I intend to\n",
      "write a Description of Prospect Garden and a set of verses to be entitled The\n",
      "Visitation in commemoration of this wonderful night. But meanwhile I should like\n",
      "each of you girls to compose an inscription that could be used somewhere in the\n",
      "garden, and also a poem to go with it. Just write anything that comes into your heads.\n",
      "I don’t want you to restrict yourselves by trying to make your poems in any way\n",
      "relate to my own poor effort. As for Bao-yu: I am very pleased that he is able to\n",
      "compose verses so well, and I want him to write me an octet for each of the four\n",
      "places in the garden I like best: the Naiad’s House, All-spice Court - those are my two\n",
      "favourites—the House of Green Delights, and Washbrook Farm. The couplets he has\n",
      "already written for them are very good, but these are four such special places, that I\n",
      "feel they deserve to have something more written about them. And apart from that,\n",
      "if Bao-yu can show me these four poems while I am here, I shall feel that the efforts I\n",

      "As for the pages who had accompanied him: the older ones, estimating that he had\n",
      "almost certainly come over for the day, gave themselves time off to gamble and drink\n",
      "\f",
      "with their cronies of to visit friends and relations outside, confident that if they\n",
      "returned in the evening they would be in time for Bao-yu’s departure. The younger\n",
      "ones wormed their way into the green-room to watch the excitement and get in the\n",
      "way of the actors. Bao-yu was left without a single one of them in attendance.\n",
      "Finding himself alone, he began thinking about a certain painting he remembered\n",
      "having seen in Cousin Zhen’s ‘smaller study’. It was a very life-like portrait of a\n",
      "beautiful woman. While everyone was celebrating, he reflected, she was sure to have\n",
      "been left on her own and would perhaps be feeling lonely. He would go and have a\n",
      "look at her and cheer her up.\n",
      "But as he approached the study, he experienced a sudden thrill of fright. A gentle\n",
      "moaning could be heard coming from inside it.\n",
      "‘Good gracious!’ he thought. ‘Can the woman in the painting really have come to\n",
      "life?’\n",
      "He made a tiny hole in the paper window with his tongue and peeped through. It was\n",
      "no painted lady he saw, stepped down from her hanging scroll upon the wall, but\n",
      "Tealeaf, pressed upon the body of a girl and evidently engaged in those exercises in\n",
      "which Bao-yu had once been instructed by the firry Disenchantment.\n",
      "‘Good lord!’\n",
      "He cried out involuntarily, and kicking open the door, strode into the study, so\n",
      "startling the two inside that they shook in their clothes. Seeing that it was Bao-yu,\n",
      "Tealeaf at once fell upon his knees and begged for mercy.\n",
      "‘In broad daylight!’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you think you’re at? If Mr Zhen got to\n",
      "hear of this, it would be more than your life is worth.’\n",
      "As he spoke, his eye fell upon the girl. She had a soft, white skin, to whose charms he\n",
      "could not be insensible. At the moment she was red to the very tips of her ears and\n",
      "stood there in silence, hanging her head with shame. Bao-yu stamped his foot\n",
      "impatiently:\n",
      "‘Why don’t you go?’\n",
      "The words seemed to bring her to herself, for she turned and fled immediately.\n",
      "Bao-yu ran after her, shouting.\n",
      "‘Don’t be afraid! I won’t tell anyone!’\n",
      "Tealeaf, running out behind him, was frantic:\n",
      "‘My dear little grandfather, that’s exactly what you are doing!’\n",
      "‘How old is she?’ Bao-yu asked him.\n",
      "‘Not more than fifteen or so,’ said Tealeaf.\n",
      "‘You don’t even know her age!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You can do this to her without even\n",
      "knowing her age! She’s wasted on you, that’s evident. Poor girl! What’s her name?’\n",
      "‘Ah now, that’s quite a story,’ said Tealeaf with a broad smile. ‘She says that just\n",
      "\f",
      "before she was born her mother dreamed she saw a beautiful piece of brocade,\n",
      "woven in all the colours of the rainbow, with a pattern of lucky swastikas all over it.\n",
      "So when she was born, she gave her the name “Swastika”.’\n",
      "Bao-yu smiled back.\n",
      "‘She ought to have a lucky future ahead of her, then. shall I ask them tomorrow if\n",
      "you can have her for your wife?’\n",
      "Tealeaf thought this was a huge joke.\n",
      "‘Why aren’t you watching the plays, Master Bao?’ he asked. ‘They’re ever so good!’\n",
      "‘I did watch for quite a while,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I got rather deafened and came out\n",
      "to walk around for a bit. That’s how I found you here. But what are we going to do\n",
      "now?’\n",
      "Tealeaf gave a sly little smile:\n",
      "‘What about going for a ride outside the city? If we slipped off quietly we could get\n",
      "there and back without anyone knowing.’\n",
      "‘Too risky,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We might get kidnapped or something. Besides, there\n",
      "would be terrible trouble if they found out. It’d better be somewhere nearer, so that\n",
      "we can get back quickly.’\n",
      "‘Who do we know near here that we could call on?’ said Tealeaf. ‘I can’t think of\n",
      "anyone.’\n",
      "‘I know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we go round to the Huas’ house and see what\n",
      "Aroma is up to?’\n",
      "‘All right. But I’ve forgotten where they live,’ said Tealeaf untruthfully. ‘And suppose\n",
      "they do find out you’ve been gadding around outside’ (he added the real reason for\n",
      "his hesitation) ‘they’ll say I put you up to it, and I shall get a beating.’\n",
      "‘I’ll see you don’t get into trouble,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Reassured, Tealeaf fetched the horse, and the two of them slipped out by the back\n",
      "entrance.\n",
      "Luckily the Huas’ house was only a few hundred yards from the Ning-guo mansion,\n",
      "and in no time at all they had reached its gate. Tealeaf entered first and called out the\n",
      "name of Aroma’s elder brother, Hua Zi-fang.\n",
      "Aroma’s mother was not long back from collecting the various nieces, on both her\n",
      "own and her late husband’s side of the family, who had had to be fetched after she\n",
      "had been to call for Aroma, and the family had only just settled down to their tea\n",
      "when they heard this voice outside calling for Hua Zi-fang. To the latter’s\n",
      "considerable surprise and mystification he found, on going outside to look, his\n",
      "sister’s young master waiting at the gate with a servant. Having first lifted Bao-yu off\n",
      "his horse, he went back into the courtyard and bawled to the rest inside:\n",
      "‘It’s Master Bao!’\n",
      "\f",
      "Aroma was dumbfounded and came running out to discover the cause of this\n",
      "unaccountable visit. As soon as she saw him she clung to him anxiously:\n",
      "‘What is it? Are you all right?’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed carelessly.\n",
      "‘I was just feeling bored, so I came over to see what you were up to.’\n",
      "‘Stupid!’ said Aroma, relieved to find that nothing was amiss. ‘What did you think I\n",
      "would be up to?’\n",
      "She turned to Tealeaf.\n",
      "‘Who else is with you?’\n",
      "‘Nobody,’ said Tealeaf with a grin. ‘Nobody else knows we’re here.’\n",
      "At this Aroma became alarmed once more.\n",
      "‘That’s terrible! Suppose you were to run into someone? Suppose you were to\n",
      "meet the Master?’ She glanced at Bao-yu fearfully. ‘In any case, the streets are so\n",
      "crowded now. You could easily get ridden down or something. It would be no joke if\n",
      "you were to have an accident. You two certainly have a nerve!’ She turned to Tealeaf\n",
      "again. ‘You put him up to this, didn’t you? Wait till I get back: I’ll tell his nannies\n",
      "about you. They’ll have you flogged like a felon, see if they don’t!’\n",
      "Tealeaf pulled a face.\n",
      "‘Don’t go trying to pin the blame on me! Master Bao was cursing and swearing at\n",
      "me to make me go with him. I kept telling him not to come. Anyway, we’d better be\n",
      "going back now, if that’s the way you feel!’\n",
      "‘You might as well stay, now you’re here,’ said Hua Zi-fang in a conciliatory manner.\n",
      "‘There’s no point in quarrelling about it. The only trouble is, this is not much of a\n",
      "place we live in here: poor and cramped and not too clean and that. Hardly a fit place\n",
      "for the likes of Master Bao, I’m thinking.’\n",
      "By this time Aroma’s mother had joined them outside to welcome the visitors. Aroma\n",
      "took Bao-yu by the hand and led him in. He saw four or five girls sitting down inside\n",
      "who hung their heads and blushed when he entered. Despite their blushes, Hua\n",
      "Zi-fang and his mother insisted that Bao-yu should get up on the kang with them, as\n",
      "they were afraid that he would find their house cold. Having installed him on the\n",
      "kang, they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pour?ing tea.\n",
      "‘Now don’t you two rush about, Mother,’ said Aroma. ‘I know how to look after him.\n",
      "There’s no point in your giving him a lot of things he won’t be able to eat.’\n",
      "As she said this, she took her own cushion that she had been sitting on, put it on top\n",
      "of a little short-legged kang table, and made Bao-yu sit on it with his feet on her\n",
      "metal foot-warmer. Then she took a couple of rose-shaped perfume lozenges from a\n",
      "little purse she was wearing, opened up her hand-warmer, popped the lozenges onto\n",
      "the burning charcoal, and closing it up again, stuffed it into the front of his gown.\n",
      "\f",
      "Having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction, she served\n",
      "him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup.\n",
      "Hua Zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea. The cakes,\n",
      "nuts and dried fruits were arranged on their plates, and the plates themselves on the\n",
      "table, with painstaking attention to symmetry and design. Aroma could tell at a\n",
      "glance that there was nothing there which Bao-yu could possibly be expected to eat.\n",
      "But her family must not be offended.\n",
      "‘Since you’ve decided to come,’ she said to Bao-yu with a smile. ‘we can’t let you go\n",
      "without having tasted something of ours. You’ll have to try something, just to be able\n",
      "to say that you have been our guest!’\n",
      "She took a handful of pine nuts from one of the dishes on the table, and blowing\n",
      "away the skins, handed them to him on her handkerchief.\n",
      "Bao-yu noticed that Aroma’s eyes were slightly red and that there were recent\n",
      "tear-stains on her powdered cheeks.\n",
      "‘Why have you been crying?’ He spoke the words in an undertone as she handed\n",
      "him the pine nuts.\n",
      "‘Who’s been crying?’ said Aroma with a feigned laugh. ‘I’ve lust been rubbing my\n",
      "eyes.’\n",
      "Her little fiction was successful, for he made no further comment.\n",
      "Bao-yu was wearing his dark-red gown with the pattern of golden dragons and white\n",
      "fox-fur lining, and a sable-lined slate-blue jacket with fringed edges.\n",
      "‘Fancy!’ said Aroma, ‘you got yourself all dressed up lust to come and see us. Didn’t\n",
      "anyone ask you where you were going?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Actually I changed because I was going to Cousin Zhen’s. He\n",
      "invited me over to watch the players.’\n",
      "Aroma nodded.\n",
      "‘You’d better go back after you’ve sat a bit longer,’ she said. ‘This is really no place\n",
      "for you here.’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t be too long, either,’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘I’ve got something\n",
      "nice waiting for you when you get back.’\n",
      "‘Sh!’ said Aroma. ‘Do you want them all to hear you?’\n",
      "As she said this, she reached out and took the Magic Jade from his neck.\n",
      "‘Here’s something that will interest you all,’ she said, holding it out to the others.\n",
      "‘You know how often you’ve spoken about that wonderful lade of Master Bao’s and\n",
      "said how much you’d give for a look at it? Well, here it is! Now you can look to your\n",
      "heart’s content. There you are, that’s all it is! Not so wonderful, really, is it?’\n",
      "They passed it from hand to hand, and when it had gone full circle and all had\n",
      "examined it, she hung it once more round his neck.\n",
      "\f",
      "Aroma told her elder brother to go out and hire the cleanest, smartest-looking cab he\n",
      "could find to take Bao-yu home in.\n",
      "‘I can see him safely back,’ said Hua Zi-fang. ‘He won’t come to any harm on\n",
      "horseback.’\n",
      "‘It’s not a question of whether he’ll come to any harm or not,’ said Aroma ‘I’m\n",
      "afraid someone might see him.’\n",
      "Hua Zi-fang hurried out to hire a cab. The rest of the com?pany, realizing that Bao-yu\n",
      "had no real business to be there, made no effort to detain him and rose to see him\n",
      "off. Aroma snatched up a handful of sweetmeats for Tealeaf. She also gave him a few\n",
      "coppers to buy fireworks with.\n",
      "‘Mind you don’t tell anyone about this visit!’ she said. ‘You’ll be in trouble yourself\n",
      "if they find out about it.\n",
      "She escorted Bao-yu to the gate and saw him into the cab, pulling the blind down on\n",
      "him as soon as he was inside. Tealeaf and her brother followed behind it with the\n",
      "horse. When they arrived outside the Ning-guo mansion, Tealeaf told the cabbie to\n",
      "stop.\n",
      "‘We’d better go in here for a bit before going home,’ he explained to Aroma’s\n",
      "brother. ‘Otherwise they might get suspicious.’\n",
      "Hua Zi-fang acknowledged the sense of this precaution, and lifting Bao-yu from the\n",
      "cab, helped him up on to his horse.\n",
      "‘Thank you for your trouble,’ said Bao-yu with a winning smile as he rode into the\n",
      "rear gate of the Ning-guo mansion.\n",
      "And there, for the time being, we shall leave him.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bao-yu left his room for the other mansion, his maids were free to do exactly\n",
      "as they liked and threw themselves into their amusements with great abandon. Some\n",
      "played at Racing Go, some at Dice and Dominoes. Everywhere a litter of the spat-out\n",
      "skins of melon-seeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence.\n",
      "It was unfortunate that Nannie Li should have chosen such a moment to come\n",
      "stomping in, stick in hand, to call on Bao-yu and to inquire how he was getting on.\n",
      "She could see that Bao-yu was out, and the uproar created in his absence by the\n",
      "maids was deeply offensive to her.\n",
      "‘Now that I’ve left service and don’t come in very often,’ she said with a sigh, ‘you\n",
      "girls have got worse than ever. The other nannies can do nothing with you. And as for\n",
      "Bao-yu: he’s like a six-foot lamp stand that lights up others but stays dark itself; for\n",
      "he’s always on about how dirty other people are, but look at the mess he allows you\n",
      "\f",
      "to make of his own room! It’s a disgrace!’\n",
      "Now the maids all knew that Bao-yu did not care about such matters. They also knew\n",
      "that Nannie Li was pensioned off now and had no more power over them. They\n",
      "therefore con?tinued with their fun and took no notice of her. But Nannie Li was not\n",
      "to be ignored. ‘How is Bao-yu eating nowadays?’ ‘what time does he go to bed?’ She\n",
      "plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all. One\n",
      "of them even said, quite audibly and in her hearing, ‘Old nuisance!’\n",
      "‘What’s in this covered bowl?’ Nannie Li went on. ‘It’s junket, isn’t it? Why don’t\n",
      "you offer it to me?’ She picked up the gift of koumiss and began to drink it.\n",
      "‘Don’t you touch that!’ said one of the maids. ‘He was keeping that for Aroma. He’ll\n",
      "be angry when he gets back and finds out about that. You’d better tell him yourself\n",
      "you took it. We don’t want you getting us into trouble!’\n",
      "Nannie Li was angry and embarrassed at one and the same time.\n",
      "‘I won’t believe it of him,’ she said. ‘I won’t believe he would be so wicked as to\n",
      "grudge his old Nannie a bowl of milk. Why, he owes it to me. And not only a bowl of\n",
      "milk, either. Much more precious things than that. Do you mean to tell me that\n",
      "Aroma counts for more with him than I do? He ought to stop and ask himself how he\n",
      "grew up to be the big boy he is today. It’s my milk he sucked, that came from my own\n",
      "heart’s blood: that’s what he grew up on. And you mean to tell me that now, if I drink\n",
      "one little bowlful of his milk—cow’s milk—he’s going to be angry with me? Well, I will\n",
      "drink it, so there! He can do what he likes about it. And as for that Aroma. I don’t\n",
      "know what sort of a wonderful creature you think she is -- a little bit of a girl I picked\n",
      "out myself and trained with my own hand!’\n",
      "Defiantly she applied the koumiss once more to her lip and downed it to the last\n",
      "gulp.\n",
      "One of the maids, politer than the rest, attempted to placate her:\n",
      "‘They shouldn’t talk to you like that, Nannie! I’m not surprised you are cross. Of\n",
      "course Bao-yu isn’t going to upset himself over a little thing like that. He’s much more\n",
      "likely to send something nice round to you when he hears that you’ve been to see\n",
      "him.’\n",
      "‘Don’t you try wheedling me with your airs and graces, young woman!’ said Nannie\n",
      "Li implacably. ‘You think I don’t know about Snowpink being dismissed that time over\n",
      "the tea? You needn’t worry. If he makes a fuss about it tomorrow, I shall take the\n",
      "blame.’\n",
      "She went off in dudgeon.\n",
      "Presently Bao-yu returned and sent someone off to fetch Aroma. He noticed\n",
      "Skybright lying motionless on the daybed.\n",
      "‘What’s the matter with her?’ he asked. ‘Is she ill? Or has she lost the game?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘She was winning,’ said Ripple. ‘Then Nannie Li came along and put her off her\n",
      "stroke and she started losing. She got so cross that she had to go and lie down.’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t all take the old girl so seriously,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just leave her to do as\n",
      "she likes and take no notice!’\n",
      "Just at that moment Aroma arrived and said ‘hullo’ to everyone. She asked Bao-yu\n",
      "where he had eaten and what time he had got back. She also gave her mother’s\n",
      "regards to the other maids. When she had finished changing out of her holiday attire\n",
      "and taken the ‘going-out’ ornaments from her hair, Bao-yu asked someone to fetch\n",
      "the koumiss. There was a chorus of replies from the maids:\n",
      "‘Nannie Li drank it!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was about to say something when Aroma cut in with a smile:\n",
      "‘So that’s what you were saving for me! It was a very kind thought; but last time I\n",
      "had some of that stuff I took too much, being so fond of it, and gave myself a terrible\n",
      "stomachache. It didn’t go away until I’d brought it all up again, and it’s put me off it\n",
      "ever since. It’s a good job really that she did drink it. It would only have got left\n",
      "around and gone bad. Now what I’d really fancy are some dried chestnuts, if you’d\n",
      "like to be peeling them for me while I make up your bed on the king.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was completely taken in by this little ruse, and forgetting all about the\n",
      "koumiss, went off for some chestnuts and sat down by the lamp to peel them. He\n",
      "and Aroma were flow alone in the room together. Glancing up with a smile from his\n",
      "peeling he said,\n",
      "‘What relation of yours was that girl in the red dress today?’\n",
      "‘That’s my mother’s sister’s child.’\n",
      "Bao-yu made appreciative noises.\n",
      "‘What are you “oo-ing” and “ah-ing” about?’ said Aroma. ‘No, don’t tell me! I know\n",
      "how your mind works. You think she’s not good enough to wear red.’\n",
      "‘No. On the contrary,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If she’s not good enough to wear red, I\n",
      "shouldn’t think anyone is. No, I was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and\n",
      "how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here.’\n",
      "‘Because I have the misfortune to be a slave,’ Aroma said bitterly, ‘does that mean\n",
      "that all my relations ought to be slaves too? I suppose you think every pretty girl you\n",
      "see is just waiting to be bought so that she can be a servant in your house?hold!’\n",
      "‘How touchy you are!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Having her to live with us doesn’t have to mean\n",
      "as a servant, does it? It could mean as a bride.’\n",
      "‘Thank you, I’m sure!’ said Aroma. ‘But my folk are not quite grand enough for\n",
      "that!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was unwilling to pursue a conversation that had become so unpleasant and\n",
      "went on peeling in silence.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Why don’t you say something?’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose I’ve upset you now. Well,\n",
      "never mind! Tomorrow you can go out and buy the lot of them, just to spite me!’\n",
      "‘I don’t see what answer I can give when you say things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I\n",
      "only said what a nice girl she was. I think she is exactly suited to live in a big, wealthy\n",
      "household like ours. Much more so than some of the lumbering idiots who do live\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "‘She may not have that much good fortune,’ said Aroma; ‘but for all that she has\n",
      "been very delicately brought up -- the apple of my aunt’s and uncle’s eye. She was\n",
      "seventeen this holidays, and her trousseau is all ready for her to be married next\n",
      "year.’\n",
      "‘Hai!’\n",
      "An involuntary expression of regret broke from him when he heard that the girl in red\n",
      "was to be married. Already Aroma’s words had made him uneasy; but worse was to\n",
      "follow.\n",
      "‘I haven’t been able to see much of my cousins during these last few years,’ she\n",
      "said with a sigh, ‘and now it looks as if they will all have left home when I do go back.’\n",
      "There was obviously a good deal more that lay behind this remark. Startled, he threw\n",
      "down the chestnut he was peeling and asked her:\n",
      "‘How do you mean, “when you do go back”?’\n",
      "‘Today I heard my mother discussing it with my elder brother. They want me to\n",
      "hold out this one year more, then next year they will see about buying me out of\n",
      "service.,\n",
      "Bao-yu was becoming more and more alarmed.\n",
      "‘Why should they want to buy you out of service?’\n",
      "‘Well upon my word, that’s a funny question to ask!’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not one of\n",
      "your house-born slaves, my family lives elsewhere. I’m the only member of my family\n",
      "away from home. There’s no future for me here. Naturally I want to rejoin them.’\n",
      "‘You can’t if I won’t let you,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘I never heard of such a thing!’ said Aroma:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Even in palace hall\n",
      "             Law is the lord of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bond is a bond. When their term of service has ended, you have to let people go.\n",
      "You can’t force them to stay in service for ever and ever -- especially a household like\n",
      "yours.’\n",
      "Bao-yu thought a bit. What she said seemed reasonable enough.\n",
      "‘But suppose Grandmother won’t let you?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Why shouldn’t she?’ said Aroma. ‘If I were a very excep?tional sort of person, it’s\n",
      "quite possible that she and Her Ladyship might feel upset at the idea of losing me\n",
      "and offer my family money to let me stay on. But as it is I’m only a very ordinary sort\n",
      "of maid. There are any number much better than me. I started off with Her Old\n",
      "Ladyship and served Miss Shi for a few years. Then I was transferred to you, and I’ve\n",
      "already been quite a few years with you. They would think it quite natural that my\n",
      "family should want to buy me out now. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if they let me\n",
      "go as a kindness without even asking for the money. If you think they wouldn’t let me\n",
      "go because I’ve served you so well, that’s just ridiculous. Serving you well is no more\n",
      "nor less than what I’m supposed to do. It’s my job. There’s nothing remarkable about\n",
      "that. There’ll be plenty of other good ones to take my place when I’m gone. I’m not\n",
      "irreplaceable.’\n",
      "Everything Aroma said pointed to the reasonableness of her going and the\n",
      "unreasonableness of her staying. A kind of desperateness began to seize him.\n",
      "‘That may be so,’ he said, ‘but if I’m absolutely determined to keep you, I’m sure\n",
      "Grandmother would speak to your mother about it. If Grandmother had a talk with\n",
      "your mother and offered her a really large sum of money, surely she wouldn’t\n",
      "refuse?’\n",
      "‘I’m sure my mother would never insist,’ said Aroma. ‘And I don’t only mean if you\n",
      "spoke to her and gave her a lot of money. Even if you didn’t speak to her about it and\n",
      "didn’t give her any money at all, but simply made up your mind to keep me here\n",
      "against my will and say nothing, I’m sure she wouldn’t dare object. But your family\n",
      "has never gone in for throwing its weight about like that in the past, and I don’t\n",
      "believe it is going to start doing so now. It would be different if I were just an object\n",
      "you’d taken a fancy to and they could get it for you without any danger of upsetting\n",
      "the owner by simply offering him ten times the price. But I’m not an object. If you\n",
      "were to keep me here without rhyme or reason against my will, you’d not only be\n",
      "doing yourselves no good, you’d be breaking up someone else’s family; and that’s\n",
      "something I’m quite sure Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship would never be willing\n",
      "to do.’\n",
      "For some time Bao-yu reflected in silence. At last he spoke:\n",
      "‘The long and short of all this is that you are definitely going, is that right?’\n",
      "‘Definitely.’\n",
      "‘Who would have believed that so sweet a person could be so faithless and\n",
      "unfeeling?’ he thought to himself. But all he said was:\n",
      "‘If I had known all along that in the end you would go away and leave me on my\n",
      "own, I should never have let you work for me in the first place.’\n",
      "And with those words he took himself off to bed in a thoroughly bad humour and\n",
      "\f",
      "composed himself for sleep.\n",
      "Now Aroma’s mother and elder brother had spoken earlier that day about their\n",
      "intention of buying her out of service, but Aroma had at once stated that she would\n",
      "never go back home as long as she lived.\n",
      "‘When you sold me in the first place,’ she said, ‘it was because you had nothing to\n",
      "eat and I was the only thing you had left in the house which was worth a bit of\n",
      "money. I couldn’t have refused to go and watched my own mother and father starve.\n",
      "But now, fortunately, I’ve got a good situation—one in which I’m not beaten and\n",
      "sworn at all day long and where I’m fed and clothed as well as the masters\n",
      "themselves—and the rest of you, inspire of losing Father, have managed to get in the\n",
      "clear again and are as well off now as you’ve ever been. If you were still hard up and\n",
      "wanted to buy me out so that you could raise a bit of money by reselling me, there\n",
      "would be some point in it. But you’re not. What do you want to buy me out for? Why\n",
      "don’t you just pretend that I’m dead, then you won’t need to think about buying me\n",
      "out any mote?’\n",
      "And after that she had had a little cry.\n",
      "Seeing her so adamant, her mother and brother had natur?ally resigned themselves\n",
      "to her continuing in service. They did so the more readily as Aroma’s contract was, in\n",
      "point of fact, for life. In seeking to redeem her they would have had to rely on the\n",
      "customary generosity of the Jia’s, who, as soon as they were approached on the\n",
      "subject, would in all probability restore not only the person of Aroma but also the\n",
      "body-price offered for her, but who were certainly not under any obliga?tion to do\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known\n",
      "fact— already mentioned by Aroma—that the Jia household did not ill-treat its\n",
      "servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them. Indeed,\n",
      "the ‘inside maids’—those who, like Aroma, were m personal attendance on members\n",
      "of the family (and this was true of all of them, no matter in whose apartment they\n",
      "were employed) were the crême de la crême of the household staff and were even\n",
      "regarded as a cut above the free daughters of poorer households outside.\n",
      "Later, when Bao-yu unexpectedly arrived on the scene and they saw how it was\n",
      "between him and Aroma, the reason for her reluctance to leave service at once\n",
      "became apparent. It was a factor they had not foreseen; but now they recognized it,\n",
      "it is a great weight off their minds, and it was not without feel?ings of relief that they\n",
      "abandoned all further thought of attempting to purchase her freedom.\n",
      "But to return to our story.\n",
      "Since early youth Aroma had always been aware that Bao-yu’s character was peculiar.\n",
      "His naughtiness and intract?ability exceeded those of normal boys, and in addition\n",
      "\f",
      "he had a number of extraordinary eccentricities of his own which she could scarcely\n",
      "even have put a name to. Recently he had taken advantage of the comparative\n",
      "immunity from parental control, afforded him by the all-encompassing protection of\n",
      "his doting grandmother, to become even more wild and self-indulgent and even\n",
      "more confirmed in his aversion to serious pursuits than in previous years, and all her\n",
      "attempts to remonstrate with him met with the same obstinate unwilling?ness to\n",
      "hear. Today’s talk about buying her out of service turned out to be providential. By\n",
      "employing only a minimum of deceit, she could use it as a means of ascertaining his\n",
      "real feelings towards her and of humbling his spirit a little, so that he might be in a\n",
      "suitably chastened frame of mind for the lecture with which she was preparing to\n",
      "admonish him. She judged from his going off silently to bed that he was shaken and a\n",
      "little unsure of himself. Evidently she had succeeded in the first part of her plan.\n",
      "Aroma had not really wanted the chestnuts. She had pre?tended to do so because\n",
      "she was afraid that the matter of the koumiss might blow up into an incident like the\n",
      "earlier one in?volving Snowpink and the tea. By pretending to want chest?nuts she\n",
      "had deflected him from pursuing it further. She now told the younger maids to take\n",
      "them away and eat them themselves, while she went over to rouse up Bao-yu. The\n",
      "face that he lifted from the pillow was wet with tears.\n",
      "‘Now what do you want to go upsetting yourself like that for?’ she said with a smile.\n",
      "‘If you really want me to stay, of course I won’t go.’\n",
      "Bao-yu at once brightened up.\n",
      "‘Tell me!’ he said. ‘Tell me what I must do to prove to you how much I want you to\n",
      "stay, since nothing I say myself seems any good!’\n",
      "‘I know we’re both fond of each other,’ said Aroma. ‘That doesn’t need any proving.\n",
      "But if you want to be sure of my staying here, it mustn’t only be because of that.\n",
      "There are three other things I want to talk to you about. If you will promise to obey\n",
      "me in all of them, I shall know that you really and truly want me to stay; then nothing\n",
      "- not even a knife at my throat - will ever make me leave you!’\n",
      "‘Tell me what they are!’ he said impetuously. ‘I promise to obey you. Dearest\n",
      "Aroma! Sweetest Aroma! Never mind two or three: I would promise if it were two or\n",
      "three hundred! All I ask is that you shouldn’t leave me. If the day ever comes when\n",
      "nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash - no, not ash. Ash has form and\n",
      "substance and perhaps consciousness too. Say smoke. A puff of thin smoke dissolved\n",
      "upon the wind. When that is all that remains of me, and you can no longer fuss over\n",
      "me because there is nothing left to fuss over, and I can no longer pay attention to you\n",
      "because there is nothing left to pay attention with - when that time comes, you may\n",
      "go or stay as you please!’\n",
      "‘My dear young gentleman,’ said Aroma exasperatedly, dapping her hand over his\n",
      "\f",
      "mouth to prevent him saying any more, ‘it’s precisely this way of carrying on that I\n",
      "was going to talk to you about, and here you go, ranting away worse than ever!’\n",
      "‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Right. I promise never to talk that way again.’\n",
      "‘That was the first thing I wanted you to reform.’\n",
      "‘I’ve reformed already,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I ever talk that way again, you can pinch my\n",
      "lips! Then what?’\n",
      "‘The second thing is this,’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t care whether you really like studying\n",
      "or not, but even if you don’t, I’d like you at least to pretend that you do when you’re\n",
      "with the Master or any other gentlemen, and not always be making sarcastic remarks\n",
      "about it. If you could only put on an appear?ance of liking it, he would have less\n",
      "cause to be angry with you, and could even take a bit of pride in you when he was\n",
      "talk?ing to his friends. Look at it from his point of view. Every generation of your\n",
      "family up to now have been scholars. Then suddenly you come along. Not only do\n",
      "you hate studying --that’s already enough to make him feel angry and upset -- but on\n",
      "top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it -- and not only\n",
      "behind his back but even when he’s there. According to you anyone who studies and\n",
      "tries to im?prove himself is a “career worm”. According to you the Illumi?nation of\n",
      "Clear Virtue or whatever it’s called is the only genuine book ever written and all the\n",
      "rest are forgeries. No wonder the Master gets so angry with you. No wonder he’s\n",
      "every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a\n",
      "thrashing.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘All right. I won’t say such things any more. In any case, these are all things I used to\n",
      "say when I was younger and didn’t know any better. I don’t say things like that\n",
      "nowadays. What else?’\n",
      "‘You must leave off forever going on about people’s appearance and interfering\n",
      "with their make-up—and you must give up that filthy habit of stealing people’s\n",
      "lipstick and eating it on the sly. That’s most important!’\n",
      "‘I’ll reform! I’ll reform! Is there anything else, now?’\n",
      "‘Nothing else, really. Just to be a bit more careful about things in general and not\n",
      "always letting yourself get carried away by your whims and fancies. But if you will\n",
      "really keep your promise about these three things I’ve mentioned, I will promise\n",
      "never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry\n",
      "me away!’\n",
      "‘Oh, come now! Isn’t that stretching it a bit?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘For eight\n",
      "bearers and a handsome husband I bet you’d go!’\n",
      "‘It wouldn’t interest me in the least,’ said Aroma haughtily. ‘“Kind sir, for such\n",
      "blessing I am not willing.” Even if I did go, I should take no pleasure in it.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Their dialogue was interrupted by Ripple, who just at that moment entered the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "‘It’s nearly midnight, you two. You ought to be in bed. Her Old Ladyship just now\n",
      "sent one of the nannies round to ask about you and I told her you were asleep.’\n",
      "Bao-yu asked for his watch and looked. The hand was pointing to half past eleven. He\n",
      "washed and cleaned his teeth all over again, and taking off his outer clothes, settled\n",
      "down once more to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "When Aroma got up first thing next morning she felt heavy and unwell. Her head\n",
      "ached, her eyelids were puffy and her whole body was afire. At first she dragged\n",
      "herself round per?forming her usual tasks, but eventually she could hold out no\n",
      "longer and had to lie down fully clothed on the kang. Bao-yu at once informed\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, who called in a doctor. Having taken Aroma’s pulses, the doctor\n",
      "informed them that she had ‘merely contracted a severe chill and would be all right\n",
      "after taking a few doses of medicine to relieve the congestion,’ and left after writing a\n",
      "prescription. Bao-yu sent out for the materials prescribed, and when they had been\n",
      "duly boiled up and the first draught taken, made her cover herself with a quilt to\n",
      "bring on a perspiration. Then he went off to see Dai-yu.\n",
      "Dai-yu was at that moment taking a midday nap. Her maids had all gone off about\n",
      "their own affairs. Not a sound could be heard from the inside room As Bao-yu lifted\n",
      "the embroidered door-curtain and entered, he could see her lying asleep inside and\n",
      "hurried over to rouse her:\n",
      "‘Sleeping after you’ve just eaten, coz? That’s bad! Wake up!’\n",
      "His voice woke her. She opened her eyes and saw that it was Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Do go away and play for a bit! I’m so dreadfully tired. I didn’t get any sleep last\n",
      "night and I haven’t been able to rest until now.’\n",
      "‘Never mind how tired you are,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You’ll do yourself much more harm by\n",
      "sleeping after a meal. I’ll’ stay and amuse you to keep you awake if you feel sleepy.’\n",
      "‘I’m not sleepy, I’m tired. I want to rest for a bit. Can’t you go and amuse yourself\n",
      "somewhere else for a few minutes and come back later?’\n",
      "Bao-yu gave her another shake.\n",
      "‘Where else can I go?’ he said. ‘I’m so bored with everyone else.’\n",
      "‘Chee-ee-ee!’ Dai-yu exploded in a little laugh. ‘All right. I suppose now you are\n",
      "here you may as well stay. You can sit very, very quietly over there and we will talk.’\n",
      "‘I should prefer to lie down,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘All right, lie down then!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There isn’t a pillow. We shall have to share yours.’\n",
      "‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Look at all those pillows in the next room. Why\n",
      "don’t you get yourself one of them?’\n",
      "Bao-yu went into the outer room for a look but came back empty-handed.\n",
      "‘I don’t want any of them,’ he said genially. ‘How do I know some dirty old woman\n",
      "hasn’t been sleeping on them?’\n",
      "Dai-yu opened her eyes very wide.\n",
      "‘You really are the bane of my life!’ she said. ‘Here, take this!’ She pushed the\n",
      "pillow she had been lying on towards him and got up to fetch another one of her\n",
      "own to replace it with. The two of them then reclined, facing each other, at opposite\n",
      "ends of the bed.\n",
      "Glancing up from her recumbent position, Dai-yu noticed that there was a blood-spot\n",
      "about the size of a small button on Bao-yu’s left cheek. She bent over him to examine\n",
      "it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger.\n",
      "‘Whose nails was it this time?’\n",
      "Bao-yu lay back to avoid her scrutiny and laughed.\n",
      "‘It isn’t a scratch. I’ve just been helping them make rouge. A little of it must have\n",
      "splashed on to my face.’ He rum?maged for a handkerchief to wipe it off with.\n",
      "Dai-yu wiped it off with her own, clicking her tongue censoriously as she did so.\n",
      "‘So you’re up to those tricks again? You might at least refrain from advertising the\n",
      "fact! Even if Uncle doesn’t see you himself, someone else might who thought it an\n",
      "amusing story to go around gossiping about. He could easily get to hear about it in\n",
      "that way, and that would make it unpleasant for all of us.’\n",
      "But her words were lost on Bao-yu. He was preoccupied with a subtle fragrance\n",
      "which seemed to emanate from Dai-?yu’s sleeve - a fragrance that intoxicated the\n",
      "senses and caused one to feel rather limp. He seized hold of the sleeve and\n",
      "demanded to know what perfume she was wearing.\n",
      "‘Perfume? At this season?’ said Dai-yu with a laugh. ‘I’m not wearing any. “In the\n",
      "cold winter none smells sweet”!’\n",
      "‘Well, where does it come from, then?’\n",
      "‘I don’t know myself where it comes from,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I suppose it might have\n",
      "come from the wardrobe.’\n",
      "Bao-yu shook his head.\n",
      "‘I doubt it. It’s a very unusual scent. Not the kind you would get from a scent-cake\n",
      "or a perfume-ball or sachet.’\n",
      "‘I hope you don’t imagine it’s some exotic perfume given me by the Immortals of\n",
      "the Isles. Even if I had the recipe, I have no kind elder brother to get together all\n",
      "those flowers and stamens and things and make it up for me. I have got only the\n",
      "\f",
      "ordinary, vulgar sorts of perfume!’\n",
      "‘Whatever I say, you are always dragging in things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Very well,\n",
      "You will have to be taught a lesson. From now on, no mercy!’\n",
      "Half rising, he pretended to spit on his hands, then stretch?ing them out before him,\n",
      "began to waggle his fingers up and down in the region of her ribs and armpits. Dai-yu\n",
      "had always been the most ticklish of mortals, and the mere sight of his waggling\n",
      "fingers sent her off into shrieks of laughter which soon ended in breathlessness:\n",
      "‘Oh! Oh! Bao-yu! No! Stop! I’ll be angry!’\n",
      "‘Will you say things like that any more?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Dai-yu, laughing weakly, ‘I promise.’\n",
      "She proceeded to pat her hair into place, smilingly com?placently:\n",
      "‘So I’ve got an unusual fragrance, have I? Have you got a warm fragrance?’\n",
      "For the moment Bao-yu was puzzled:\n",
      "‘Warm fragrance?’\n",
      "Dai-yu shook her head pityingly.\n",
      "‘Don’t be so dense! You have your jade. Somebody has a gold thing to match.\n",
      "Somebody has Cold Fragrance, ergo you must have Warm Fragrance to go with it!’\n",
      "‘I’ve only just let you off,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and here you go again, worse than ever!’\n",
      "Once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and Dai-yu again began to shriek.\n",
      "‘No! Bao-yu! Please! I promise!’\n",
      "‘All right, I forgive you. But you must let me smell your sleeve.’\n",
      "He wrapped the free end of that garment over his face and abandoned himself to\n",
      "long and prodigious sniffs.\n",
      "Dai-yu jerked away her arm.\n",
      "‘I really think you ought to go.’\n",
      "‘Couldn’t go if I wanted to. Let’s lie down very quietly and genteelly and have a\n",
      "conversation.’ And he stretched himself out again.\n",
      "Dai-yu lay down too, and covered her face with a handker?chief.\n",
      "He tried to arouse her interest with desultory chat—talking for the sake of talking.\n",
      "Dai-yu took no notice. He tried asking questions. How old was she when she first\n",
      "came to the Capital? What had the scenery been like on the journey? What places of\n",
      "historical interest were there in Yangchow? What were its inhabitants like? What\n",
      "were its local customs? Dai-yu made no reply. Still concerned that she might fail\n",
      "asleep and injure her health, he tried a ruse.\n",
      "‘Why, yes!’ he said, as if suddenly remembering something. ‘There’s a famous story\n",
      "that took place near Yangchow. I wonder if you know about it.’\n",
      "This was delivered with so straight a face and in so serious a tone of voice that Dai-yu\n",
      "was quite taken in.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Oh? What?’\n",
      "Mastering a strong inclination to laugh, he began to extemporize with whatever\n",
      "came into his head.\n",
      "‘Near the city of Yangchow there is a mountain called Mt Yu-dai, in the side of\n",
      "which is a cavern called the Cave of Lin.’\n",
      "‘That’s false, for a start,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ve never heard of a mountain of that name.’\n",
      "‘There are a great many mountains in this world,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You could hardly be\n",
      "expected to know all of them. Leave your criticisms until I have finished my story.’\n",
      "‘Carry on,’ said Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Now in the Cave of Lin there lived a tribe of magic mice, and one year, on the\n",
      "seventh day of the last month, the Oldest Mouse climbed up on to his throne and sat\n",
      "in council with the rest of the tribe.\n",
      "‘“Tomorrow is Nibbansday,” he said, “and everywhere in the world of men they will\n",
      "be cooking frumenty. Since our cave is at present short of dry provender, we should\n",
      "take this opportunity of replenishing our stores by raiding theirs.” He took a\n",
      "ceremonial arrow from the receptacle in front of him and handing it to an able\n",
      "younger mouse, instructed him to carry out a reconnaissance. In due course the Able\n",
      "Younger Mouse came back and reported that, though he had looked positively\n",
      "everywhere, there were nowhere more plentiful stores to be found than in the\n",
      "temple at the foot of the mountain.\n",

      "Aroma at first thought that Nannie Li’s anger arose solely on account of her failure to\n",
      "get up and welcome her, and had started to excuse herself on that supposition:\n",
      "‘I’m ill, Mrs Li. I’ve just been sweating. I didn’t see you because I had my head\n",

      "Watching this sudden exit, Bao-chai and Dai-yu laughed and clapped their hands:\n",
      "‘How splendid! Just the sort of wind we needed to blow the old woman away!’\n",
      "But Bao-yu shook his head and sighed:\n",
      "‘I wonder what had really upset her. Obviously she only picked on Aroma because\n",
      "she is weak and can’t defend herself. I wonder which of the girls had offended her to\n",
      "make her so .\n",
      "He was interrupted by Skybright:\n",
      "‘Why should any of us want to upset her? Do you think we’re mad? And even if we\n",
      "had offended her, we should be perfectly capable of owning up to it and not letting\n",
      "someone else take the blame!’\n",
      "Aroma grasped Bao-yu’s hand and wept:\n",
      "‘Because I offended one old nurse, you have to go offending a whole roomful of\n",
      "\f",
      "people. Don’t you think there’s been enough trouble already without dragging other\n",
      "people into it?’\n",
      "Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her\n",
      "condition, Bao-yu stifled his indig?nation and did his best to comfort her so that she\n",
      "might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever. Her\n",
      "skin was burning to the touch. He decided to stay with her for a while, and lying\n",
      "down beside her, spoke to her soothingly:\n",
      "‘Just try to get better, now! Never mind all that other nonsense! It’s of no\n",
      "importance.’\n",
      "Aroma smiled bitterly.\n",
      "‘If I had allowed myself to get upset about things like that, I shouldn’t have lasted in\n",
      "this room for five minutes! Still, if we’re always going to have this sort of trouble, I\n",
      "think in the long run I just shan’t be able to stand any more. You don’t seem to\n",
      "realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you’ve forgotten all\n",
      "about it. But they haven’t. It’s all scored up against me; and as soon as something\n",
      "goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it\n",
      "so unpleasant for all of us.’\n",
      "She cried weakly as she said this, but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting\n",
      "Bao-yu.\n",
      "Soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of Aroma’s medicine.\n",
      "Bao-yu could see that she had started sweating again and told her not to get up,\n",
      "holding the medicine for her himself and supporting her while she drank it. Then he\n",
      "told one of the junior maids to make up a bed for her on the kang.\n",
      "‘Whether you’re going to eat there or not,’ Aroma said to him, ‘you’d better go and\n",
      "sit with Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship for a bit and play a while with the young\n",
      "ladies before you come back here again. I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my\n",
      "own.’\n",
      "Bao-yu thought he had better do as she said, and after wait?ing until she had taken\n",
      "off her ornaments and was lying tucked up in bed, he went to the front apartment\n",
      "and took his dinner with Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "After dinner Grandmother Jia wanted to go on playing cards with some of the old\n",
      "stewardesses. Bao-yu, still worrying about Aroma, returned to his own room, where\n",
      "he found her sleeping fitfully. He thought of going to bed himself, but it was still too\n",
      "early. Skybright, Mackerel, Ripple and Emerald had gone off in quest of livelier\n",
      "entertainment, hoping to persuade Grandmother Jia’s maids, Faithful and Amber, to\n",
      "loin them in a game. Only Musk was left in the outer room, playing Patience under\n",
      "the lamp with a set of dominoes. Bao-yu smiled at her.\n",
      "‘Why don’t you go off to loin the others?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I haven’t got any money.’\n",
      "‘There’s a great pile of money under the bed. Isn’t that enough for you to lose?’\n",
      "‘If we all went off to play,’ said Musk, ‘who would look after this room? There’s her\n",
      "sick inside. And lamps and stoves burning everywhere. The old women were\n",
      "practically dead on their feet after waiting on you all day; I had to let them go and\n",
      "rest. And the girls have been on duty all day, too. You could scarcely grudge them\n",
      "some time off now for amusement.—Which leaves only me to look after the place.’\n",
      "‘Another Aroma,’ thought Bao-yu to himself and gave her another smile.\n",
      "‘I’ll sit here while you’re away. There’s nothing to worry about here if you’d like to\n",
      "go.’\n",
      "‘There’s even less excuse for going if you are here,’ said Musk. ‘Why can’t we both\n",
      "sit here and talk?’\n",
      "‘What can we do?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just sitting here talking is going to be rather dull. I\n",
      "know! You were saying this morning that your head was itchy. As you haven’t got\n",
      "anything else to do now, I’ll comb it for you.’\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Musk, and fetching her toilet-box with the mirror on top she\n",
      "proceeded to take off her ornaments and shake her hair out. Bao-yu took a comb and\n",
      "began to comb it for her. But he had not drawn it more than four or five times\n",
      "through her hair, when Skybright came bursting in to get some more money. Seeing\n",
      "the two of them together, she smiled sarcastically:\n",
      "‘Fancy! Doing her hair already-- before you’ve even drunk the marriage-cup!’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘Come here! I’ll do yours for you too, if you like!’\n",
      "‘I wouldn’t presume, thanks all the same!’\n",
      "She took the money, and with a swish of the door-blind was gone.\n",
      "Bao-yu was standing behind Musk as she sat looking at her?self in the mirror. Their\n",
      "eyes met in the glass and they both laughed.\n",
      "‘Of all the girls in this room she has the sharpest tongue,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Musk signalled to him agitatedly in the glass with her hand. Bao-yu took her meaning;\n",
      "but it was too late. With another swish of the door-blind, Skybright had already\n",
      "darted in again.\n",
      "‘Oh! Sharp-tongued, am I? Perhaps you’d like to say a bit more on that subject?’\n",
      "‘Get along with you!’ laughed Musk. ‘Don’t go starting any more arguments!’\n",
      "‘And don’t you go sticking up for him!’ said Skybright gaily. ‘I know what you’re up\n",
      "to, you two. You don’t deceive me with your goings-on. I’ll have something to say to\n",
      "you about this when I get back later. Just wait until I’ve won some of my money\n",
      "back!’\n",
      "With that she darted off once more.\n",
      "\f",
      "When Bao-yu had finished combing her hair, he asked Musk to help him get to\n",
      "bed—very quietly, so as not to disturb Aroma.\n",
      "And that ends our account of that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing next morning Aroma awoke to find that she had sweated heavily during\n",
      "the night and that her body felt very much lighter; but she would take only a little\n",
      "congee for breakfast in order not to tax her system too soon. Bao-yu saw that there\n",
      "was no further cause for concern, and after his meal drifted off to Aunt Xue’s\n",
      "apartment in search of amusement.\n",
      "Now this was the prime of the year, when the schoolroom is closed for the New Year\n",
      "holiday and the use of the needle is forbidden to maidenly fingers throughout the\n",
      "whole of the Lucky Month, so that boys and girls alike are all agreeably un?employed,\n",
      "and Bao-yu’s half-brother Jia Huan, on holiday like all the rest, had also drifted over\n",
      "to Aunt Xue’s place in search of amusement. He found Bao-chai, Caltrop and Oriole\n",
      "there playing a game of Racing Go, and after watching them for a bit, wanted to play\n",
      "too.\n",
      "Bao-chai had always behaved towards Jia Huan in exactly the same way as she did\n",
      "towards Bao-yu and made no distinc?tions between them. Consequently, when he\n",
      "asked to play, she at once made a place for him and invited him to join them on the\n",
      "kang. They played for stakes of ten cash each a game. Jia Huan won the first game\n",
      "and felt very pleased. But then, as luck would have it, he lost several times in a row\n",
      "and began to get somewhat rattled.\n",
      "It was now his turn to throw the dice. He needed seven to win, and if he threw\n",
      "anything less than seven, the dice would go next to Oriole, who needed only three.\n",
      "He hurled them from the pot with all his might. One of them rested at two. The other\n",
      "continued rather erratically to roll about. ‘Ace! Ace! Ace!’ cried Oriole, clapping her\n",
      "hands. ‘Six! Seven! Eight!’ shouted Jia Huan glaring at Oriole and commanding the\n",
      "die to perform the impossible. But the perverse wanderer finally came to rest with\n",
      "the ace uppermost, making a grand total of three. With the speed of desperation Jia\n",
      "Huan reached out and snatched it up, claiming, as he did so, that it was a six.\n",
      "‘It was an ace,’ said Oriole, ‘as plain as anything!’\n",
      "Bao-chai could see that Jia Huan was rattled, and darting a sharp look at Oriole,\n",
      "commanded her to yield.\n",
      "‘You grow more unmannerly every day,’ she told her. ‘Surely you don’t think one of\n",
      "the masters would cheat you? Come on! Put your money down!’\n",
      "Oriole smarted with the injustice of this, but her mistress had ordered it, so she had\n",
      "\f",
      "to pay up without arguing. She could not, however, forbear a few rebellious\n",
      "mutterings:\n",
      "‘Huh! One of the masters! Cheating a maid out of a few coppers! Even I should be\n",
      "ashamed! Look how much money Bao-yu lost when he was playing with us the other\n",
      "day, yet he didn’t mind. Even when some of the maids took all he had left, he only\n",
      "laughed...’\n",
      "She would have gone on, but Bao-chai checked her angrily. ‘How can I hope to\n",
      "compete with Bao-yu?’ said Jia Huan, beginning to blubber. ‘You’re all afraid of him.\n",
      "You all take his part against me because I’m only a concubine’s son.’\n",
      "Bao-chai was shocked:\n",
      "‘Please don’t say things like that, Cousin! You’ll make your?self ridiculous.’\n",
      "Once more she rebuked Oriole.\n",
      "Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in, and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in,\n",
      "asked him what was the matter. But Jia Huan dared not say anything.\n",
      "Bao-chai, familiar with the state of affairs, normal in other families, which places the\n",
      "younger brother in fearful subjec?tion to the elder, assumed that Jia Huan was afraid\n",
      "of Bao-yu. She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of\n",
      "him. ‘We are both equally subject to our parents’ control,’ he would say of himself\n",
      "and Jia Huan. ‘Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control\n",
      "him myself - especially when I am the wife’s son and he is the concubine’s? People\n",
      "already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if\n",
      "I were to start bossing him about.’\n",
      "But’ there was another, zanier, notion which contributed to this attitude. Let us try to\n",

Theoretically, it is impossible to deceive the POS test because no one write while calculating the POS makeup of their sentences, making POS test the best parameter for tagging an author’s writing style. \n",

    "Chan’s result, however, is challenged by Chao Kang’s research, who analyzed a different POS, the empty word (xuci). Empty words in Classical Chinese do not carry any semantic meaning but functions as syntactic markers. Because of the lack of sematic meaning, in many situations, empty words can be omitted according to the author’s will. Therefore, Chao considers empty words the best indicator of an author’s style, and by analyzing empty words, Chao ends by concluding the presence of different authors. \n",

In contrast, Chan collected the relative frequency of words and performed association test to testify the likeliness.
