      "‘Brother Stone, according to what you yourself seem to imply in these verses, this\n",
      "story of yours contains matter of sufficient interest to merit publication and has been\n",
      "carved here with that end in view. But as far as I can see (a) it has no discoverable\n",

      "for some trifling talent or insignificant virtue. Even if I were to copy all this out, I\n",

      "that it could speak) ‘must you be so obtuse? All the romances ever written have an\n",
      "artificial period setting—Han or Tang for the most part. In refusing to make use of\n",
      "that stale old convention and telling my Story of the Stone exactly as it occurred, it\n",
      "seems to me that, far from depriving it of anything, I have given it a freshness these\n",
      "other books do not have.\n",

      "anecdotes about statesmen and emperors of bygone days and scabrous attacks on\n",
      "the reputations of long-dead gentlewomen, contain more wickedness and immorality\n",
      "than I care to mention. Still worse is the “erotic novel”, by whose filthy obscenities\n",
      "our young folk are all too easily corrupted. And the “boudoir romances”, those dreary\n",

      "young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors)— even they seem unable to avoid\n",
      "descending sooner or later into indecency.\n",
      "“The trouble with this last kind of romance is that it only gets written in the first\n",
      "place because the author requires a framework in which to show off his love-poems.\n",
      "He goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically, beginning with the\n",
      "names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character, a servant or\n",
      "the like, to make mischief between them, like the chou in a comedy.\n",
      "‘What makes these romances even more detestable is the stilted, bombastic\n",

      "area which, because of the way it is bottled up inside a narrow cul-de-sac, is referred\n",

      "particularly wealthy one, but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry\n",
      "as the leading family in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "     Zhen Shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totality unambitious person. He\n",
      "devoted his time to his garden and to the pleasures of wine and poetry. Except for a\n",
      "single flaw, his existence could, indeed, have been described as an idyllic one. The\n",
      "flaw was that, although already past fifty, he had no son, only a little girl, just two\n",
      "years old, whose name was Ying-lian.\n",
      "     Once, during the tedium of a burning summer's day, Shi-yin was sitting idly in his\n",

      "onto the desk in a doze. While in this drowsy state he seemed to drift off to some\n",

      "     ‘Where do you intend to take that thing you are carrying?’ the Taoist was asking.\n",

      "‘Give her to me! Give her to me!’\n",
      "Shi-yin was beginning to lose patience and clasping his little girl tightly to him, turned\n",
      "on his heel and was about to re-enter the house when the monk pointed his finger at\n",
      "him, roared with laughter, and then proceeded to intone the following verses:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fond man, your pampered child to cherish so—\n",
      "That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow!\n",
      "Beware the high feast of the fifteenth day,\n",
      "When all in smoke and fire shall pass away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Shi-yin heard all this quite plainly and was a little worried by it. He was thinking or\n",
      "asking the monk what lay behind these puzzling words when he heard the Taoist say,\n",
      "‘We don’t need to stay tether. Why don’t we part company here and each go about\n",
      "his own business? Three kalpas from now I shall wait far you on Bei-mang Hill. Having\n",
      "joined forces again there, we can go together to the Land of Illusion to sign off.’\n",
      "‘Excellent!’said the other. And the two if them went off and soon were both lost to\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "'There must have been something behind all this, ‘thought Shi-yin to himself.’1 really\n",
      "ought to have asked him what he meant, but now it is too late.'\n",
      "He was still standing outside his door brooding when Jia Yu-cun, the poor student\n",
      "who lodged at the Bottle-gourd Temple next door, came up to him. Yu-cun was a\n",
      "native of Hu-zhou and came from a family of scholars and bureaucrats which had,\n",
      "however, fallen on bad times when Yu-cun was born. The family fortunes on both his\n",

      "him in his home town, so he had set off for the capital, in search of fame and fortune.\n",
      "Unfor?tunately he had got no further than Soochow when his funds ran out, and he\n",
      "had now been living there in poverty for a year, lodging in this temple and keeping\n",
      "himself alive by working as a copyist. For this reason Shi-yin saw a great deal of his\n",
      "company.\n",
      "     As soon as he caught sight of Shi-yin, Yu-cun clasped his hands in greeting and\n",
      "smiled ingratiatingly. ‘I could see you standing there gazing, sir. Has anything been\n",
      "happening in the street?’\n",
      "     ‘No, no,’ said Shi-yin. ‘It just happened that my little girl was crying, so I brought\n",
      "her out here to amuse her. Your coming is most opportune, dear boy. I was beginning\n",
      "to feel most dreadfully bored. Won’t you come into my little den, and we can help\n",
      "each other to while away this tedious hot day?’\n",
      "     So saying, he called for a servant to take the child indoors, while he himself took\n",
      "Yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study, where his boy served them both with\n",
      "tea. But they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words before one of the servants\n",
      "rushed in to say that ‘Mr Yan had come to pay a call.’ Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and\n",
      "excused himself: ‘I seem to have brought you here under false pretences. I do hope\n",
      "you will forgive me. If you don’t mind sitting on your own here for a moment, I shall\n",
      "be with you directly.’\n",
      "     Yu-cun rose to his feet too. ‘Please do not distress yourself on my account, sir. I\n",
      "am a regular visitor here and can easily wait a bit.’ But by the time he had finished\n",
      "saying this, Shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guest-room.\n",
      "     Left to himself, Yu-cun was flicking through some of Shi?-yin’s books of poetry in\n",
      "order to pass the time, when he heard a woman's cough outside the window.\n",
      "Immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was. The cough appeared to\n",
      "have come from a maid who was picking flowers in the garden. She was an unusually\n",
      "good-looking girl with a rather refined face: not a great beauty, by any means, but\n",
      "with something striking about her. Yu-cun gazed at her spellbound.\n",
      "    Having now finished picking her flowers, this anonymous member of the Zhen\n",
      "household was about to go in again when, on some sudden impulse, she raised her\n",
      "head and caught sight of a man standing in the window. His hat was frayed and his\n",
      "clothing threadbare; yet, though obviously poor, he had a fine, manly physique and\n",
      "handsome, well-proportioned features.\n",
      "    The maid hastened to remove herself from this male presence; but as she went\n",
      "she thought to herself, ‘What a fine-looking man! But so shabby! The family hasn’t\n",
      "got any friends or relations as poor as that. It must be that Jia Yu-cun the master is\n",
      "always on about. No wonder he says that he won’t stay poor long. I remember\n",
      "hearing him say that he’s often wanted to help him but hasn’t yet found an\n",
      "\f",
      "opportunity.’ And thinking these thoughts she could not forbear to turn back for\n",
      "another peep or two.\n",
      "     Yu-cun saw her turn back and, at once assuming that she had taken a fancy to\n",
      "him, was beside himself with delight. What a perceptive young woman she must be,\n",
      "he thought, to have seen the genius underneath the rags! A real friend in trouble!\n",
      "     After a while the boy came in again and Yu-cun elicited from him that the visitor\n",
      "in the front room was now staying to dinner. It was obviously out of the question to\n",
      "wait much longer, so he slipped down the passage-way at the side of the house and\n",
      "let himself out by the back gate. Nor did Shi-yin invite him round again when, having\n",
      "at last seen off his visitor, he learned that Yu-cun had already left.\n",
      "     But then the Mid Autumn festival arrived and, after the family convivialities were\n",
      "over, Shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to\n",
      "invite Yu-cun, walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight.\n",
      "     Ever since the day the Zhens’ maid had, by looking back twice over her shoulder,\n",
      "convinced him that she was a friend, Yu-cun had had the girl very much on his mind,\n",
      "and now that it was festival time, the full moon of Mid Autumn lent an inspiration to\n",
      "his romantic impulses which finally resulted in the following octet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ere on ambition's path my feet are set,\n",
      "Sorrow comes often this poor heart to fret.\n",
      "Yet, as my brow contracted with new care,\n",
      "Was there not one who, parting, turned to stare?\n",
      "Dare I, that grasp at windows in the wind,\n",
      "Hope, underneath the moon, a friend to find?\n",
      "Bright orb, if with my plight you sympathize,\n",
      "Shine first upon the chamber where she lies.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Having delivered himself of this masterpiece, Yu-cun’s thoughts began to run on his\n",
      "unrealized ambitions and, after much head-scratching and many heavenward glances\n",
      "ac?companied by heavy sighs, he produced the following couplet, reciting it in a loud,\n",
      "ringing voice which caught the ear of Shi-yin, who chanced at that moment to be\n",
      "arriving:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy.\n",
      "The jade pin in the drawer hides, waiting its time to fly.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Shi-yin smiled. ‘You are a man of no mean ambition, Yu-cun.’\n",
      "‘Oh no!’Yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly. ‘You are too flattering. I was merely\n",
      "\f",
      "reciting at random from the lines of some old poet. But what brings you here, sir?’\n",
      "‘Tonight is Mid Autumn night,’said Shi-yin. ‘People call it the Festival of Reunion. It\n",
      "occurred to me that you might be feeling rather lonely here in your monkery, so I\n",
      "have arranged for the two of us to take a little wine together in my study. I hope you\n",
      "will not refuse to join me.’\n",
      "Yu-cun made no polite pretence of declining. ‘Your kind?ness is more than I deserve,’\n",
      "he said. ‘I accept gratefully.’ And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door.\n",
      "Soon they had finished their tea. Wine and various choice dishes were brought in\n",
      "and placed on the table, already laid out with cups, plates, and so forth, and the two\n",
      "men took their places and began to drink. At first they were rather slow and\n",
      "ceremonious; but gradually, as the conversation grew more animated, their potations\n",
      "too became more reckless and un?inhibited. The sounds of music and singing which\n",
      "could now be heard from every house in the neighbourhood and the full moon which\n",
      "shone with cold brilliance overhead seemed to increase their elation, so that the\n",
      "cups were emptied almost as soon as they touched their lips, and Yu-cun, who was\n",
      "already a sheet or so in the wind, was seized with an irrepressible excitement to\n",
      "which he presently gave expression in the form of a quatrain, ostensibly on the\n",
      "subject of the moon, but really about the ambition he had hitherto been at some\n",
      "pains to conceal:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In thrice five nights her perfect O is made,\n",
      "Whose cold light bathes each marble balustrade.\n",
      "As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways,\n",
      "On earth ten thousand heads look up and gaze.’\n",
      "\n",
      "     ‘Bravo!’said Shi-yin loudly. 'I have always insisted that you were a young fellow\n",
      "who would go up in the world, and now, in these verses you have just recited, I see\n",
      "an augury of your ascent. In no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds! This\n",
      "calls for a drink!' And, saying this, he poured Yu-cun a large cup of wine.\n",
      "     Yu-cun drained the cup, then, surprisingly, sighed:\n",
      "     ‘Don't imagine the drink is making me boastful, but I really do believe that if it\n",
      "were just a question of having the sort of qualifications now in demand, I should\n",
      "stand as good a chance as any of getting myself on to the list of candidates. The\n",
      "trouble is that I simply have no means of laying my hands on the money that would\n",
      "be needed for lodgings and travel expenses. The journey to the capital is a long one,\n",
      "and the sort of money I can earn from my copying is not enough—’\n",
      "     ‘Why ever didn't you say this before?’ said Shi-yin inter?rupting him. ‘I have long\n",
      "wanted to do something about this, but on all the occasions I have met you\n",
      "\f",
      "previously, the con?versation has never got round to this subject, and I haven't liked\n",
      "to broach it for fear of offending you. Well, now we know where we are. I am not a\n",
      "very clever man, but at least I know the right thing to do when I see it. Luckily, the\n",
      "next Triennial is only a few months ahead. You must go to the capital without delay. A\n",
      "spring examination triumph will make you feel that all your studying has been worth\n",
      "while. I shall take care of all your expenses. It is the least return I can make for your\n",
      "friendship.’ And there and then he instructed his boy to go with all speed and make\n",
      "up a parcel of fifty tales of the best refined silver and two suits of winter clothes.\n",
      "     ‘The almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travel?ling,’ he went on,\n",
      "addressing Yu-cun again. ‘You can set about hiring a boat for the journey straight\n",
      "away. How de?lightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have\n",
      "distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates!’\n",
      "     Yu-cun accepted the silver and the clothes with only the most perfunctory word\n",
      "of thanks and without, apparently, giving them a further moment’s thought, for he\n",
      "continued to drink and laugh and talk as if nothing had happened. It was well after\n",
      "midnight before they broke up.\n",
      "After seeing Yu-cun off, Shi-yin went to bed and slept without a break until the sun\n",
      "was high in the sky next morn?ing. When he awoke, his mind was still running on the\n",
      "con?versation of the previous night. He thought he would write a couple of\n",
      "introductory letters for Yu-cun to take with him to the capital, and arrange for him to\n",
      "call on the family of an official he was acquainted with who might be able to put him\n",
      "up; but when he sent a servant to invite him over, the servant brought back word\n",
      "from the temple as follows:\n",
      "'The monk says that Mr Jia set out for the capital at five o'clock this morning, sir. He\n",
      "says he left a message to pass on to you. He said to tell you, “A scholar should not\n",
      "concern himself with almanacs, but should act as the situation de?mands,”and he\n",
      "said there wasn't time to say good-bye.'\n",
      "So Shi-yin was obliged to let the matter drop.\n",

      "Fifteenth Night, and Shi-yin sent little Ying-lian out, in the charge of one of the\n",
      "servants called Calamity, to see the mummers and the coloured lanterns. It was near\n",
      "midnight when Calamity, feeling an urgent need to relieve his bladder, put Ying-lian\n",
      "down on someone’s doorstep while he went about his business, only to find, on his\n",
      "\f",
      "return, that the child was nowhere to be seen. Frantically he searched for her\n",
      "throughout the rest of the night; but when day dawned and he had still not found her,\n",
      "he took to his heels, not daring to face his master and mistress, and made off for\n",
      "another part of the country.\n",
      "Shi-yin and his wife knew that something must be wrong when their little girl failed\n",
      "to return home all night. Then a search was made; but all those sent out were\n",

      "The shock of so sudden a loss to a middle-aged couple who had only ever had the\n",
      "one daughter can be imagined. In tears every day and most of the night, they almost\n",
      "lost the will to go on living, and after about a month like this first Shi-yin and then his\n",
      "wife fell ill, so that doctors and diviners were in daily attendance on them.\n",
      "     Then, on the fifteenth of the third month, while frying cakes for an offering, the\n",
      "monk of Bottle-gourd Temple carelessly allowed the oil to catch alight, which set fire\n",
      "to the paper window. And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and\n",
      "bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction\n",
      "anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away\n",
      "like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time\n",
      "they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away\n",
      "all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families\n",
      "homeless in the process.\n",
      "Poor Zhens! Though they and their handful of domestics escaped unhurt, their house,\n",
      "which was only next door to the temple, was soon reduced to a heap of rubble, while\n",
      "Shi-yin stood by helpless, groaning and stamping in despair.\n",
      "After some discussion with his wife, Shi-yin decided that they should move to their\n",
      "farm in the country; but a series of crop failures due to flooding and drought had led\n",
      "to wide?spread brigandage in those parts, and government troops were out\n",
      "everywhere hunting down the mutinous peasants and making arrests. In such\n",
      "conditions it was impossible to settle on the farm, so Shi-yin sold the land and, taking\n",
      "only two of the maids with them, went with his wife to seek refuge with his\n",
      "father-in-law, Feng Su.\n",
      "     This Feng Su was a Ru-zhou man who, though only a farmer by calling, had a very\n",
      "comfortable sufficiency. He was somewhat displeased to see his son-in-law arriving\n",
      "like a refugee on his doorstep; but fortunately Shi- yin had on him the money he had\n",
      "realized from the sale of the farm, and this he now entrusted to his father-in-law to\n",
      "buy for him, as and when he could, a house and land on which he could depend for\n",
      "his future livelihood. Feng Su embezzled about half of this sum and used the other\n",
      "half to provide him with a ruinous cottage and some fields of poor, thin soil.\n",
      "A scholar, with no experience of business or agricultural matters, Shi-yin now found\n",
      "\f",
      "himself poorer after a year or two of struggle than when he had started. Feng Su\n",
      "would treat him to a few pearls of rustic wisdom whenever they met, but behind his\n",
      "back would grumble to all and sundry about 'incompetents' and 'people who liked\n",
      "their food but were too lazy to work for it', which caused Shi-yin great bitterness\n",

      "One day, wishing to take his mind off his troubles for a bit, he had dragged himself,\n",

      "parents doted on her, and because she showed exceptional intelligence, conceived\n",
      "the idea of giving her a rudimentary education as a substitute for bringing up a son,\n",

      "looking for a suitable tutor for his daughter, took Yu-cun along to the yamen and\n",

      "this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a\n",
      "recurrent sickness, and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons.\n",
      "Bored by his enforced idleness, Yu-cun took to going for walks as soon as lunch was\n",
      "over whenever the weather was warm and sunny.\n",
      "One day a desire to savour country sights and sounds led him outside the city walls,\n",
      "and as he walked along with no fixed destination in mind, he presently found himself\n",
      "in a place ringed with hills and full of murmuring brooks and tall stands of bamboo\n",
      "where a temple stood half-hidden among the trees. The walled approach to the\n",
      "gateway had fallen in and parts of the surrounding wall were in ruins. A board above\n",

      "As long as there is a sufficiency behind you, you press greedily forward.\n",

      "It is only when there is no road in front of you that you think of turning back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The wording is commonplace to a degree,’ Yu-cun reflected, ‘yet the sentiment is\n",
      "\f",
      "quite profound. In all the famous temples and monasteries I have visited, I cannot\n",
      "recollect having ever seen anything quite like it. I shouldn’t be surprised to find that\n",
      "some story of spectacular downfall and dramatic conversion lay behind this\n",
      "inscription. It might be worth going in and inquiring.’\n",
      "But when he went inside and looked around, he saw only an ancient, wizened monk\n",
      "cooking some gruel who paid no attention whatsoever to his greetings and who\n",
      "proved, when Yu-cun went up to him and asked him a few questions, to be both deaf\n",
      "and partially blind. His toothless replies were all but unintelligible, and in any case\n",
      "bore no relation to the questions.\n",
      "Yu-cun walked out again in disgust. He now thought that in order to give the full rural\n",
      "flavour to his outing he would treat himself to a few cups of wine in a little country\n",
      "inn and accordingly directed his steps towards the near-by village. He had scarcely\n",
      "set foot inside the door of the village inn when one of the men drinking at separate\n",
      "tables inside rose up and advanced to meet him with a broad smile.\n",
      "‘Fancy meeting you!’\n",
      "It was an antique dealer called Leng Zi-xing whom Yu-cun had got to know some\n",
      "years previously when he was staying in the capital. Yu-cun had a great admiration\n",
      "for Zi-xing as a practical man of business, whilst Zi-xing for his part was tickled to\n",
      "claim acquaintanceship with a man of Yu-cun’s great learning and culture. On the\n",
      "basis of this mutual admiration the two of them had got on wonderfully well, and\n",
      "Yu-cun now returned the other’s greeting with a pleased smile.\n",
      "‘My dear fellow! How long have you been here? I really had no idea you were in\n",
      "these parts. It was quite an accident that I came here today at all. What an\n",
      "extraordinary coincidence!’\n",
      "‘I went home at the end of last year to spend New Year with the family,’ said Zi-xing.\n",
      "‘On my way back to the capital I thought I would stop off and have a few words with\n",
      "a friend of mine who lives hereabouts, and he very kindly invited me to spend a few\n",
      "days with him. I hadn’t got any urgent business waiting for me, so I thought I might as\n",
      "well stay on a bit and leave at the middle of the month. I came out here on my own\n",
      "because my friend has an engagement today. I certainly didn’t expect to run into you\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "Zi-xing conducted Yu-cun to his table as he spoke and ordered more wine and some\n",
      "fresh dishes to be brought. The two men then proceeded, between leisurely sips of\n",
      "wine, to relate what each had been doing in the years that had elapsed since their\n",
      "last meeting.\n",
      "Presently Yu-cun asked Zi-xing if anything of interest had happened recently in the\n",
      "capital.\n",
      "‘I can’t think of anything particularly deserving of mention,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Except,\n",
      "\f",
      "perhaps, for a very small but very unusual event that took place in your own clan\n",
      "there.’\n",
      "‘What makes you say that?’ said Yu-cun, ‘I have no family connections in the\n",
      "capital.’\n",
      "‘Well, it’s the same name,’ said Zi-xing. ‘They must be the same clan.’\n",
      "Yu-cun asked him what family he could be referring to.\n",
      "‘I fancy you wouldn’t disown the Jias of the Rong-guo mansion as unworthy of you.’\n",
      "‘Oh, you mean them,’ said Yu-cun. ‘There are so many members of my clan, it’s\n",
      "hard to keep up with them all. Since the time of Jia Fu of the Eastern Han dynasty\n",
      "there have been branches of the Jia clan in every province of the empire. The\n",
      "Rong-guo branch is, as a matter of fact, on the same clan register as my own; but\n",
      "since they are exalted so far above us socially, we don’t normally claim the\n",
      "connection, and nowa?days we are completely out of touch with them.’\n",
      "Zi-xing sighed. ‘You shouldn’t speak about them in that way, you know. Nowadays\n",
      "both the Rong and Ning mansions are in a greatly reduced state compared with what\n",
      "they used to be.’\n",
      "‘When I was last that way the Rong and Ning mansions both seemed to be fairly\n",
      "humming with life. Surely nothing could have happened to reduce their prosperity in\n",
      "so short a time?’\n",
      "‘Ah, you may well ask. But it’s a long story.’\n",
      "‘Last time I was in Jinling,’ went on Yu-cun, ‘I passed by their two houses one day on\n",
      "my way to Shi-tou-cheng to visit the ruins. The Ning-guo mansion along the eastern\n",
      "half of the road and the Rong-guo mansion along the western half must between\n",
      "them have occupied the greater part of the north side frontage of that street. It’s\n",
      "true that there wasn’t much activity outside the main entrances, but looking up over\n",
      "the outer walls I had a glimpse of the most magnificent and imposing halls and\n",
      "pavilions, and even the rocks and trees of the gardens beyond seemed to have a\n",
      "sleekness and luxuriance that were certainly not suggestive of a family whose\n",
      "fortunes were in a state of decline.’\n",
      "‘Well! For a Palace Graduate Second Class, you ought to know better than that!\n",
      "Haven’t you ever heard the old saying, “The beast with a hundred legs is a long time\n",
      "dying”? Although I say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past, of\n",
      "course I don’t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their\n",
      "circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average\n",
      "government official. At the moment the numbers of their establishment and the\n",
      "activities they engage in are, if anything, on the increase. Both masters and servants\n",
      "all lead lives of luxury and magnificence. And they still have plenty of plans and\n",
      "projects under way. But they can’t bring themselves to economize or make any\n",
      "\f",
      "adjustment in their ac?customed style of living. Consequently, though outwardly they\n",
      "still manage to keep up appearances, inwardly they are beginning to feel the pinch.\n",
      "But that’s a small matter. There’s something much more seriously wrong with them\n",
      "than that. They are not able to turn out good sons, those stately houses, for all their\n",
      "pomp and show. The males in the family get more degenerate from one generation\n",
      "to the next.’\n",
      "‘Surely,’ said Yu-cun with surprise, ‘it is inconceivable that such highly cultured\n",
      "households should not give their children the best education possible? I say nothing\n",
      "of other families, but the Jias of the Ning and Rong households used to be famous for\n",
      "the way in which they brought up their sons. How could they come to be as you\n",
      "describe?’\n",
      "‘I assure you, it is precisely those families I am speaking of. Let me tell you\n",
      "something of their history. The Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo were two\n",
      "brothers by the same mother. Ning-guo was the elder of the two. When he died, his\n",
      "eldest son, Jia Dai-hua, inherited his post. Dai?hua had two sons. The elder, Jia Fu,\n",
      "died at the age of eight or nine, leaving only the second son, Jia Jing, to inherit.\n",
      "Nowadays Jia Jing’s only interest in life is Taoism. He spends all his time over retorts\n",
      "and crucibles concocting elixirs, and refuses to be bothered with anything else.\n",
      "‘Fortunately he had already provided himself with a son, Jia Zhen, long before he\n",
      "took up this hobby. So, having set his mind on turning himself into an immortal, he\n",
      "has given up his post in favour of this son. And what’s more he refuses outright to\n",
      "live at home and spends his time fooling around with a pack of Taoists somewhere\n",
      "outside the city walls.\n",
      "‘This Jia Zhen has got a son of his own, a lad called Jia Rong, just turned sixteen.\n",
      "With old Jia Jing out of the way and refusing to exercise any authority, Jia Zhen has\n",
      "thrown his res[omsiblities to thw winds and given himself up to a life of pleasure. He\n",
      "has turned that Ning-guo mansion upside down, but there is no one around who\n",
      "dares gainsay him.\n",
      "‘Now I come to the Rong household—it was there that this strange event occurred\n",
      "that I was telling you about. When the old Duke of Rong-guo died, his eldest son, Jia\n",
      "Dai-shan, inherited his emoluments. He married a girl from a very old Nanking family,\n",
      "the daughter of Marquis Shi, who bore him two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘Dai-shan has been dead this many a year, but the old lady is still alive. The elder\n",
      "son, Jia She, inherited; but he’s only a very middling sort of person and doesn’t play\n",
      "much part in running the family. The second son, though, Jia Zheng, has been mad\n",
      "keen on study ever since he was a lad. He is a very upright sort of person, straight as\n",
      "a die. He was his grand?father’s favourite. He would have sat for the examinations,\n",
      "but when the emperor saw Dai-shan’s testamentary memorial that he wrote on his\n",
      "\f",
      "death bed, he was so moved, thinking what a faithful servant the old man had been,\n",
      "that he not only ordered the elder son to inherit his father’s position, but also gave\n",
      "instructions that any other sons of his were to be pre?sented to him at once, and on\n",
      "seeing Jia Zheng he gave him the post of Supernumerary Executive Officer, brevet\n",
      "rank, with instructions to continue his studies while on the Minis?try’s payroll. From\n",
      "there he Jias now risen to the post of Under Secretary.\n",
      "‘Sir Zheng’s lady was formerly a Miss Wang. Her first child was a boy called Jia Zhu.\n",
      "He was already a Licensed Scholar at the age of fourteen. Then he married and had a\n",
      "son. But he died of an illness before he was twenty. The second child she bore him\n",
      "was a little girl, rather remarkable because she was born on New Year’s day. Then\n",
      "after an interval of twelve years or more she suddenly had another son. He was even\n",
      "more remarkable, because at the moment of his birth he had a piece of beautiful,\n",
      "clear, coloured jade in his mouth with a lot of writing on it. They gave him the name\n",
      "“Bao-yu” as a consequence. Now tell me if you don’t think that is an extraordinary\n",
      "thing.’\n",
      "‘It certainly is,’ Yu-cun agreed. ‘I should not be at all surprised to find that there was\n",
      "something very unusual in the heredity of that child.’\n",
      "‘Humph,’ said Zi-xing. ‘A great many people have said that. That is the reason why\n",
      "his old grandmother thinks him such a treasure. But when they celebrated the First\n",
      "Twelve month and Sir Zheng tested his disposition by putting a lot of objects in front\n",
      "of him and seeing which he would take hold of, he stretched out his little hand and\n",
      "started playing with some women’s things –combs, bracelets, pots of rouge and\n",
      "powder and the like—completely ignoring all the other ob?jects. Sir Zheng was very\n",
      "displeased. He said he would grow up to be a rake, and ever since then he hasn’t felt\n",
      "much affection for the child. But to the old lady he’s the very apple of her eye.\n",
      "‘But there’s more that’s unusual about him than that. He’s now rising ten and\n",
      "unusually mischievous, yet his mind is as sharp as a needle. You wouldn’t find one in\n",
      "a hundred to match him. Some of the childish things he says are most extraordinary.\n",
      "He’ll say, “Girls are made of water and boys are made of mud. When I am with girls I\n",
      "feel fresh and clean’ but when I am with boys I feel stupid and nasty.” Now isn’t that\n",
      "priceless! He’ll be a lady-killer when he grows up, no question of that.’\n",

      "who invariably use fancy words like “chun”, “hong”, “xiang”, “yu”, and so forth. How\n",

      "great gift of the gab, so at present he stays at home with his Uncle Zheng and helps\n",
      "him manage the family’s affairs. However, ever since he married this young lady I\n",
      "mentioned, every?one high and low has joined in praising her, and he has been put\n",
      "into the shade rather. She is not only a very handsome young woman, she also has a\n",
      "very ready tongue and a very good head – more than a match for most men, I can tell\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "‘You see, I was not mistaken,’ said Yu-cun. ‘All these people you and I have been\n",

      "shut out of the city. Why not continue the conversation on our way back? Then we\n",
      "can take our time.’\n",
      "The two men accordingly rose from their seats, settled the bill for the wine, and were\n",
      "just about to start on their way, when a voice from behind called out, ‘Yu-cun,\n",

      "     Yu-cun accepted the suggestion with eager deference. Everything, he thought to\n",

      "     ‘I’m half a century old now, my dear, and I have no inten?tion of taking a second\n",
      "wife; so there will be no one here to act as a mother to you. It isn’t, either, as if you\n",
      "had sisters who could help to take care of you. You know how often you are poorly.\n",

      "On the day of her arrival in the capital, Dai-yu stepped ashore to find covered chairs\n",
      "from the Rong mansion for her and her women and a cart for the luggage ready\n",
      "waiting on the quay.\n",
      "     She had often heard her mother say that her Grandmother Jia’s home was not\n",
      "like other people’s houses. The servants she had been in contact with during the past\n",
      "few days were comparatively low-ranking ones in the domestic hierarchy, yet the\n",
      "food they ate, the clothes they wore, and everything about them was quite out of\n",
      "the ordinary. Dai-yu tried to imagine what the people who employed these superior\n",
      "beings must be like. When she arrived at their house she would have to watch every\n",
      "step she took and weigh every word she said, for if she put a foot wrong they would\n",
      "surely laugh her to scorn.\n",
      "     Dai-yu got into her chair and was soon carried through the city walls. Peeping\n",
      "through the gauze panel which served as a window, she could see streets and\n",
      "buildings more rich and elegant and throngs of people more lively and numerous\n",
      "than she had ever seen in her life before. After being carried for what seemed a very\n",
      "great length of time, she saw, on the north front of the east-west street through\n",
      "which they were passing, two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple\n",
      "gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads. In front of the gateway\n",
      "ten or so splendidly dressed flunkeys sat in a row. The centre of the three gates was\n",
      "closed, but people were going in and out of the two side ones. There was a board\n",
      "above the centre gate on which were written in large characters the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "NING-GUO HOUSE\n",
      "Founded and Constructed by\n",
      "Imperial Command\n",
      "\n",
      "Dai-yu realized that this must be where the elder branch of her grandmother’s family\n",
      "lived. The chair proceeded some dis?tance more down the street and presently there\n",
      "was another triple gate, this time with the legend\n",
      "\n",
      "RONG-GUO HOUSE\n",
      "\f",
      "above it.\n",
      "    Ignoring the central gate, her bearers went in by the western entrance and after\n",
      "traversing the distance of a bow-shot inside, half turned a corner and set the chair\n",
      "down. The chairs of her female attendants which were following behind were set\n",
      "down simultaneously and the old women got out. The places of Dai-yu’s bearers\n",
      "were taken by four handsome, fresh-faced pages of seventeen or eighteen. They\n",
      "shouldered her chair and, with the old women now following on foot, carried it as far\n",
      "as an ornamental inner gate. There they set it down again and then retired in\n",
      "respectful silence. The old women came forward to the front of the chair, held up the\n",
      "curtain, and helped Dai-yu to get out.\n",
      "    Each hand resting on the outstretched hand of an elderly attendant, Dai-yu\n",
      "passed through the ornamental gate into a courtyard which had balustraded loggias\n",
      "running along its sides and a covered passage-way through the center. The\n",
      "fore?ground of the courtyard beyond was partially hidden by a screen of polished\n",
      "marble set in an elaborate red sandalwood frame. Passing round the screen and\n",
      "through a small reception hall beyond it, they entered the large courtyard of the\n",
      "man?sion’s principal apartments. These were housed in an imposing five-frame\n",
      "building resplendent with carved and painted beams and rafters which faced them\n",
      "across the courtyard. Running along either side of the courtyard were galleries hung\n",
      "with cages containing a variety of different-coloured parrots, cockatoos, white-eyes,\n",
      "and other birds. Some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main\n",
      "building opposite. At the appearance of the visitors they rose to their feet and came\n",
      "forward with smiling faces to welcome them.\n",
      "    ‘You’ve come just at the right time! Lady Jia was only this moment asking about\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "    Three or four of them ran to lift up the door-curtain, while another of them\n",
      "announced in loud tones,\n",
      "    ‘Miss Lin is here!’\n",
      "    As Dai-yu entered the room she saw a silver-haired old lady advancing to meet\n",
      "her, supported on either side by a servant. She knew that this must be her\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and would have fallen on her knees and made her kotow, but before\n",
      "she could do so her grandmother had caught her in her arms and pressing her to her\n",
      "bosom with cries of ‘My pet!’ and ‘My poor lamb!’ burst into loud sobs, while all\n",
      "those present wept in sympathy, and Dai-yu felt herself crying as though she could\n",
      "never stop. It was some time before those present succeeded in calming them both\n",
      "down and Dai-yu was at last able to make her kotow.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now introduced those present.\n",
      "‘This is your elder uncle’s wife, Aunt Xing. This is your Uncle Zheng’s wife, Aunt\n",
      "\f",
      "Wang. This is Li Wan, the wife of your Cousin Zhu, who died.’\n",
      "Dai-yu kowtowed to each of them in turn.\n",
      "‘Call the girls!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them that we have a very special visitor\n",
      "and that they need not do their lessons today.’\n",
      "There was a cry of ‘Yes ma’am’ from the assembled maids, and two of them went off\n",
      "to do her bidding.\n",
      "Presently three girls arrived, attended by three nurses and five or six maids.\n",
      "The first girl was of medium height and slightly plumpish, with cheeks as white and\n",
      "firm as a fresh lychee and a nose as white and shiny as soap made from the white\n",
      "goose-fat. She had a gentle, sweet, reserved manner. To look at her was to love her.\n",
      "The second girl was rather tall, with sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She had\n",
      "an oval face under whose well-formed brows large, expressive eyes shot out glances\n",
      "that sparkled with animation. To look at her was to forget all that was mean or vulgar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third girl was undersized and her looks were still some?what babyish and\n",
      "unformed.\n",
      "All three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of\n",
      "bracelets and hair ornaments.\n",
      "Dai-yu rose to meet them and exchanged curtseys and intro?ductions. When she was\n",
      "seated once more, a maid served tea, and a conversation began on the subject of her\n",
      "mother: how her illness had started, what doctors had been called in, what\n",
      "medicines prescribed, what arrangements had been made for the funeral, and how\n",
      "the mourning had been observed. This conversation had the foreseeable effect of\n",
      "upsetting the old lady all over again.\n",
      "‘Of all my girls your mother was the one I loved the best,’ she said, ‘and now she’s\n",
      "been the first to go, and without my even being able to see her again before the end.\n",
      "I can’t help being upset!’ And holding fast to Dai-yu’s hand, she once more burst into\n",
      "tears. The rest of the company did their best to comfort her, until at last she had\n",
      "more or less re?covered\n",
      "Everyone’s attention now centred on Dai-yu. They ob?served that although she was\n",
      "still young, her speech and manner already showed unusual refinement. They also\n",
      "noticed the frail body which seemed scarcely strong enough to bear the weight of its\n",
      "clothes, but which yet had an inexpressible grace about it, and realizing that she\n",
      "must be suffering from some deficiency, asked her what medicine she took for it and\n",
      "why it was still not better.\n",
      "‘I have always been like this,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have been taking medicine ever since I\n",
      "could eat and been looked at by ever so many well-known doctors, but it has never\n",
      "done me any good. Once, when I was only three, I can remember a scabby-headed\n",
      "\f",
      "old monk came and said he wanted to take me away and have me brought up as a\n",
      "nun; but of course, Mother and Father wouldn’t hear of it. So he said, “Since you are\n",
      "not prepared to give her up, I am afraid her illness will never get better as long as she\n",
      "lives. The only way it might get better would be if she were never to hear the sound\n",
      "of weeping from this day onwards and never to see any relations other than her own\n",
      "mother and father. Only in those conditions could she get through her life without\n",
      "trouble.” Of course, he was quite crazy, and no one took any notice of the things he\n",
      "said. I’m still taking Ginseng Tonic Pills.’\n",
      "‘Well, that’s handy,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I take the Pills myself. We can easily tell\n",
      "them to make up a few more each time.’\n",
      "She had scarcely finished speaking when someone could be heard talking and\n",
      "laughing in a very loud voice in the inner courtyard behind them.\n",
      "‘Oh dear! I’m late,’ said the voice. ‘I’ve missed the arrival of our guest.’\n",
      "‘Everyone else around here seems to go about with bated breath,’ thought Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Who can this new arrival be who is so brash and unmannerly?’\n",
      "Even as she wondered, a beautiful young woman entered from the room behind the\n",
      "one they were sitting in, surrounded by a bevy of serving women and maids. She was\n",
      "dressed quite differently from the others present, gleaming like some fairy princess\n",
      "with sparkling jewels and gay embroideries.\n",
      "Her chignon was enclosed in a circlet of gold filigree and clustered pearls. It was\n",
      "fastened with a pin embellished with flying phoenixes, from whose beaks pearls were\n",
      "suspended on tiny chains.\n",
      "Her necklet was of red gold in the form of a coiling dragon. Her dress had a fitted\n",
      "bodice and was made of dark red silk damask with a pattern of flowers and\n",
      "butterflies in raised gold thread.\n",
      "Her jacket was lined with ermine. It was of a slate-blue stuff with woven insets in\n",
      "coloured silks.\n",
      "Her under-skirt was of a turquoise-coloured imported silk crêpe embroidered with\n",
      "flowers.\n",
      "She had, moreover,\n",
      "eyes like a painted phoenix,\n",
      "eyebrows like willow-eaves,\n",
      "a slender form,\n",
      "seductive grace;\n",
      "the ever-smiling summer face\n",
      "of hidden thunders showed no trace;\n",
      "the ever-bubbling laughter started\n",
      "almost before the lips were parted.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘You don’t know her,’ said Grandmother Jia merrily. ‘She’s a holy terror this one.\n",
      "What we used to call in Nanking a “peppercorn”. You just call her “Peppercorn Feng”.\n",
      "She’ll know who you mean!’\n",
      "Dai-yu was at a loss to know how she was to address this Peppercorn Feng until one\n",
      "of the cousins whispered that it was ‘Cousin Lian’s wife’, and she remembered having\n",
      "heard her mother say that her elder uncle, Uncle She, had a son called Jia Lian who\n",
      "was married to the niece of her Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. She had been\n",
      "brought up from earliest childhood just like a boy, and had acquired in the\n",
      "schoolroom the somewhat boyish-sounding name of Wang Xi-feng. Dai-yu\n",
      "accordingly smiled and curtseyed, greeting her by her correct name as she did so.\n",
      "Xi-feng took Dai-yu by the hand and for a few moments scrutinized her carefully from\n",
      "top to toe before conducting her back to her seat beside Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘She’s a beauty, Grannie dear! If I hadn’t set eyes on her today, I shouldn’t have\n",
      "believed that such a beautiful creature could exist! And everything about her so\n",
      "distingué!She doesn’t take after your side of the family, Grannie. She’s more like a Jia.\n",
      "I don’t blame you for having gone on so about her during the past few days—but\n",
      "poor little thing! What a cruel fate to have lost Auntie like that!’ and she dabbed at\n",
      "her eyes with a handkerchief.\n",
      "‘I’ve only just recovered,’ laughed Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t you go trying to start me\n",
      "off again! Besides, your little cousin is not very strong, and we’ve only just managed\n",
      "to get her cheered up. So let’s have no more of this!’\n",
      "In obedience to the command Xi-feng at once exchanged her grief for merriment.\n",
      "‘Yes，of course. It was just that seeing my little cousin here put everything else out\n",
      "of my mind. It made me want to laugh and cry all at the same time. I’m afraid I quite\n",
      "forgot about you, Grannie dear. I deserve to be spanked, don’t I?’\n",
      "She grabbed Dai-yu by the hand.\n",
      "‘How old are you dear? Have you begun school yet? You mustn’t feel home sick\n",
      "here. If there’s anything you want to eat or anything you want to play with, just come\n",
      "and tell me. And you must tell me if any of the maids or the old nannies are nasty to\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Dai-yu made appropriate responses to all of these questions and injunctions.\n",
      "Xi-feng turned to the servants.\n",
      "‘Have Miss Lin’s things been brought in yet? How many people did she bring with\n",
      "her? You’d better hurry up and get a couple of rooms swept out for them to rest in.’\n",
      "While Xi-feng was speaking, the servants brought in tea and various plates of food,\n",
      "the distribution of which she pro?ceeded to supervise in person.\n",
      "Dai-yu noticed her Aunt Wang questioning Xi-feng on the side:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Have this month’s allowances been paid out yet?’\n",
      "‘Yes. By the way, just now I went with some of the women to the upstairs\n",
      "storeroom at the back to look for that satin. We looked and looked, but we couldn’t\n",
      "find any like the one you described yesterday. Perhaps you misremembered.’\n",
      "‘Oh well, if you can’t find it, it doesn’t really matter,’ said Lady Wang. Then, after a\n",
      "moment’s reflection, ‘You’d better pick out a couple of lengths presently to have\n",
      "made up into clothes for your little cousin here. If you think of it, send someone\n",
      "round in the evening to fetch them!’\n",
      "‘It’s already been seen to. I knew she was going to arrive within a day or two, so I\n",
      "had some brought out in readiness. They are waiting back at your place for your\n",
      "approval. If you think they are all right, they can be sent over straight away.’\n",
      "Lady Wang merely smiled and nodded her head without saying anything.\n",
      "The tea things and dishes were now cleared away, and Grandmother Jia ordered two\n",
      "old nurses to take Dai-yu round to see her uncles; but Uncle She’s wife, Lady Xing,\n",
      "hurriedly rose to her feet and suggested that it would be more convenient if she\n",
      "were to take her niece round herself.\n",
      "‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You go now, then. There is no need for you to\n",
      "come back afterwards.’\n",
      "So having, together with Lady Wang, who was also return?ing to her quarters, taken\n",
      "leave of the old lady, Lady Xing went off with Dai-yu, attended across the courtyard\n",
      "as far as the covered way by the rest of the company.\n",
      "A carriage painted dark blue and hung with kingfisher-blue curtains had been drawn\n",
      "up in front of the ornamental gateway by some pages. Into this Aunt Xing ascended\n",
      "hand in hand with Dai-yu. The old women pulled down the carriage blind and\n",
      "ordered the pages to take up the shafts, the pages drew the carriage into an open\n",
      "space and harnessed mules to it, and Dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the\n",
      "west gate, east?wards past the main gate of the Rong mansion, in again through a big\n",
      "black-lacquered gate, and up to an inner gate, where they were set down again.\n",
      "Holding Dai-yu by the hand, Aunt Xing led her into a courtyard in the middle of what\n",
      "she imagined must once have been part of the mansion’s gardens. This impression\n",
      "was strengthened when they passed through a third gateway into the quarters\n",
      "occupied by her uncle and aunt; for here the smaller scale and quiet elegance of the\n",
      "halls, galleries and loggias were quite unlike the heavy magnificence and impos?ing\n",
      "grandeur they had just come from, and ornamental trees and artificial rock\n",
      "formations, all in exquisite taste, were to be seen on every hand.\n",
      "As they entered the main reception hall, a number of heavily made-up and\n",
      "expensively dressed maids and concubines, who had been waiting in readiness, came\n",
      "forward to greet them.\n",
      "\f",
      "Aunt Xing asked Dai-yu to be seated while she sent a ser?vant to call Uncle She. After\n",
      "a considerable wait the servant returned with the following message:\n",
      "‘The Master says he hasn’t been well these last few days, and as it would only upset\n",
      "them both if he were to see Miss Lin now, he doesn’t feel up to it for the time being.\n",
      "He says, tell Miss Lin not to grieve and not to feel homesick. She must think of her\n",
      "grandmother and her aunts as her own family now. He says that her cousins may not\n",
      "be very clever girls, but at least they should be company for her and help to take her\n",
      "mind off things. If she finds anything at all here to distress her, she is to speak up at\n",
      "once. She mustn’t feel like an outsider. She is to make herself completely at home.’\n",
      "Dai-yu stood up throughout this recital and murmured polite assent whenever assent\n",
      "seemed indicated. She then sat for about another quarter of an hour before rising to\n",
      "take her leave. Her Aunt Xing was very pressing that she should have a meal with her\n",
      "before she went, but Dai-yu smilingly replied that though it was very kind of her aunt\n",
      "to offer, and though she ought really not to refuse, nevertheless she still had to pay\n",
      "her respects to her Uncle Zheng, and feared that it would be disrespectful if she were\n",
      "to arrive late. She hoped that she might accept on another occasion and begged her\n",
      "aunt to excuse her.\n",
      "‘In that case, never mind,’ said Lady Xing, and instructed the old nurses to see her\n",
      "to her Uncle Zheng’s in the same carriage she had come by. Dai-yu formally took her\n",
      "leave, and Lady Xing saw her as far as the inner gate, where she issued a few more\n",
      "instructions to the servants and watched her niece’s carriage out of sight before\n",
      "returning to her rooms.\n",
      "Presently they re-entered the Rong mansion proper and Dai-yu got down from the\n",
      "carriage. There was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate,\n",
      "along which the old nurses now conducted her. Turning right, they led her down a\n",
      "roofed passage-way along the back of a south-facing hall, then through an inner gate\n",
      "into a large courtyard.\n",
      "The big building at the head of the courtyard was connected at each end to galleries\n",
      "running through the length of the side buildings by means of ‘stag’s head’ roofing\n",
      "over the corners. The whole formed an architectural unit of greater sumptuous?ness\n",
      "and magnificence than anything Dai-yu had yet seen that day, from which she\n",
      "concluded that this must be the main inner hall of the whole mansion.\n",
      "High overhead on the wall facing her as she entered the hall was a great blue board\n",
      "framed in gilded dragons, on which was written in large gold characters\n",
      "\n",
      "THE HALL OF EXALTED FELICITY\n",
      "\n",
      "with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words ‘....\n",
      "\f",
      "written for Our beloved Subject, Jia Yuan,.Duke of Rong-guo’, followed by the\n",
      "Emperor’s private seal, a device containing the words ‘kingly cares’ and ‘royal brush’\n",
      "in archaic seal-script.\n",
      "A long, high table of carved red sandalwood, ornamented with dragons, stood\n",
      "against the wall underneath. In the centre of this was a huge antique bronze ding,\n",
      "fully a yard high, covered with a green patina. On the wall above the ding hung a long\n",
      "vertical scroll with an ink-painting of a dragon emerg?ing from clouds and waves, of\n",
      "the kind often presented to high court officials in token of their office. The ding was\n",
      "flanked on one side by a smaller antique bronze vessel with a pattern of gold inlay\n",
      "and on the other by a crystal bowl. At each side of the table stood a row of eight\n",
      "yellow cedar-wood armchairs with their backs to the wall; and above the chairs hung,\n",
      "one on each side, a pair of vertical ebony boards inlaid with a couplet in characters of\n",
      "gold:\n",
      "  (on the right-hand one)\n",
      "May the jewel of learning shine in this house more effulgently than the sun and\n",
      "moon.\n",
      "  (on the left-hand one)\n",
      "May the insignia of honour glitter in these halls more brilliantly than the starry sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was followed by a colophon in smaller characters:\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Respectful Compliments of your Fellow-\n",
      "Student, Mu Shi, Hereditary Prince of Dong-an.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Wang did not, however, normally spend her leisure hours in this main reception\n",
      "hall, but in a smaller room on the east side of the same building. Accordingly the\n",
      "nurses con?ducted Dai-yu through the door into this side apartment.\n",
      "Here there was a large kang underneath the window, covered with a scarlet Kashmir\n",
      "rug. In the middle of the kang was a dark-red bolster with a pattern of medallions in\n",
      "the form of tiny dragons, and a long russet-green seating strip in the same pattern. A\n",
      "low rose-shaped table of coloured lacquer-work stood at each side. On the left-hand\n",
      "one was a small, square, four-legged ding, together with a bronze ladle, metal\n",
      "chop?sticks, and an incense container. On the right-hand one was a narrow-waisted\n",
      "Ru-ware imitation gu with a spray of freshly cut flowers in it.\n",
      "In the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the\n",
      "east wall. All had footstools in front of them and chair-backs and seat-covers in old\n",
      "rose brocade sprigged with flowers. There were also narrow side-tables on which tea\n",
      "things and vases of flowers were arranged, besides other furnishings which it would\n",
      "\f",
      "be superfluous to enumerate.\n",
      "The old nurses invited Dai-yu to get up on the kang; but guessing that the brocade\n",
      "cushions arranged one on each side near the edge of it must be her uncle’s and\n",
      "aunt’s places, she deemed it more proper to sit on one of the chairs against the wall\n",
      "below. The maids in charge of the apartment served tea, and as she sipped it Dai-yu\n",
      "observed that their clothing, make?up, and deportment were quite different from\n",
      "those of the maids she had seen so far in other parts of the mansion.\n",
      "Before she had time to finish her tea, a smiling maid came in wearing a dress of red\n",
      "damask and a black silk sleeveless jacket which had scalloped borders of some\n",
      "coloured material.\n",
      "‘The Mistress says will Miss Lin come over to the other side, please.’\n",
      "The old nurses now led Dai-yu down the east gallery to a reception room at the side\n",
      "of the courtyard. This too had a kang. It was bisected by a long, low table piled with\n",
      "books and tea things. A much-used black satin back-rest was pushed up against the\n",
      "east wall. Lady Wang was seated on a black satin cushion and leaning against another\n",
      "comfortable-looking back-rest of black satin somewhat farther forward on the\n",
      "opposite side.\n",
      "Seeing her niece enter, she motioned her to sit opposite her on the kang, but Dai-yu\n",
      "felt sure that this must be her Uncle Zheng’s place. So, having observed a row of\n",
      "three chairs near the kang with covers of flower-sprigged brocade which looked as\n",
      "though they were in fairly constant use, she sat upon one of those instead. Only after\n",
      "much further pressing from her aunt would she get up on the kang, and even then\n",
      "she would only sit beside her and not in the position of honour opposite.\n",
      "‘Your uncle is in retreat today,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He will see you another time.\n",
      "There is, however, something I have got to talk to you about. The three girls are very\n",
      "well-behaved children, and in future, when you are studying or sewing together, even\n",
      "if once in a while they may grow a bit high-spirited, I can depend on them not to go\n",
      "too far. There is only one thing that worries me. I have a little monster of a son who\n",
      "tyrannizes over all the rest of this household. He has gone off to the temple today in\n",
      "fulfillment of a vow and is not yet back; but you will see what I mean this evening.\n",
      "The thing to do is never to take any notice of him. None of your cousins dare provoke\n",
      "him.’\n",
      "Dai-yu had long ago been told by her mother that she had a boy cousin who was\n",
      "born with a piece of jade in his mouth and who was exceptionally wild and naughty.\n",
      "He hated study and liked to spend all his time in the women’s apartments with the\n",
      "girls, but because Grandmother Jia doted on him so much, no one ever dared to\n",
      "correct him. She realized that it must be this cousin her aunt was now referring to.\n",
      "‘Do you mean the boy born with the jade, Aunt?’ she asked. ‘Mother often told me\n",
      "\f",
      "about him at home. She told me that he was one year older than me and that his\n",
      "name was Bao-yu. But she said that though he was very willful, he always behaved\n",
      "very nicely to girls. Now that I am here, I suppose I shall be spending all my time with\n",
      "my girl cousins and not in the same part of the house as the boys. Surely there will be\n",
      "no danger of my provoking him?’\n",
      "Lady Wang gave a rueful smile. ‘You little know how things are here! Bao-yu is a law\n",
      "unto himself. Because your grandmother is so fond of him she has thoroughly spoiled\n",
      "him. When he was little he lived with the girls, so with the girls he remains now. As\n",
      "long as they take no notice of him, things run quietly enough. But if they give him the\n",
      "least encouragement, he at once becomes excitable, and then there is no end to the\n",
      "mischief he may get up to. That is why I counsel you to ignore him. He can be all\n",
      "honey-sweet words one minute and ranting and raving like a lunatic the next. So\n",
      "don’t believe anything he says.’\n",
      "Dai-yu promised to follow her aunt’s advice.\n",
      "Just then a maid came in with a message that ‘Lady Jia said it was time for dinner’,\n",
      "whereupon Lady Wang took Dai-yu by the hand and hurried her out through a back\n",
      "door. Passing along a verandah which ran beneath the rear eaves of the hall they\n",
      "came to a corner gate through which they passed into an alley-way running north\n",
      "and south. At the south end it was traversed by a narrow little building with a short\n",
      "passage-way running through its middle. At the north end was a white ?painted\n",
      "screen wall masking a medium-sized gateway leading to a small courtyard in which\n",
      "stood a very little house.\n",
      "‘That,’ said Lady Wang, pointing to the little house, ‘is where your Cousin Lian’s\n",
      "wife, Wang Xi-feng, lives, in case you want to see her later on. She is the person to\n",
      "talk to if there is anything you need.’\n",
      "There were a few young pages at the gate of the courtyard who, when they saw Lady\n",
      "Wang coming, all stood to attention with their hands at their sides.\n",
      "Lady Wang now led Dai-yu along a gallery, running from east to west, which brought\n",
      "them out into the courtyard be?hind Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Entering these\n",
      "by a back entrance, they found a number of servants waiting there who, as soon as\n",
      "they saw Lady Wang, began to arrange the table and chairs for dinner. The ladies of\n",
      "the house themselves took part in the service. Li Wan brought in the cups, Xi-feng\n",
      "laid out the chopsticks, and Lady Wang brought in the soup.\n",
      "The table at which Grandmother Jia presided, seated alone on a couch, had two\n",
      "empty chairs on either side. Xi-feng tried to seat Dai-yu in the one on the left nearer\n",
      "to her grand?mother —an honour which she strenuously resisted until her\n",
      "grandmother explained that her aunt and her elder cousins’ wives would not be\n",
      "eating with them, so that, since she was a guest, the place was properly hers. Only\n",
      "\f",
      "then did she ask per?mission to sit, as etiquette prescribed. Grandmother Jia then\n",
      "ordered Lady Wang to be seated. This was the cue for the three girls to ask\n",
      "permission to sit. Ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite Dai-yu,\n",
      "Tan-chun sat second on the left, and Xi-chun sat second on the right.\n",
      "While Li Wan and Xi-feng stood by the table helping to distribute food from the\n",
      "dishes, maids holding fly-whisks, spittoons, and napkins ranged themselves on either\n",
      "side. In addition to these, there were numerous other maids and serving-women in\n",
      "attendance in the outer room, yet not so much as a cough was heard throughout the\n",
      "whole of the meal.\n",
      "When they had finished eating, a maid served each diner with tea on a little tray.\n",
      "Dai-yu’s parents had brought their daughter up to believe that good health was\n",
      "founded on care?ful habits, and in pursuance of this principle, had always in?sisted\n",
      "that after a meal one should allow a certain interval to elapse before taking tea in\n",
      "order to avoid indigestion. How?ever, she could see that many of the rules in this\n",
      "household were different from the ones she had been used to at home; so, being\n",
      "anxious to conform as much as possible, she accepted the tea. But as she did so,\n",
      "another maid preferred a spittoon, from which she inferred that the tea was for\n",
      "rinsing her mouth with. And it was not, in fact, until they had all rinsed out their\n",
      "mouths and washed their hands that another lot of tea was served, this time for\n",
      "drinking.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now dismissed her lady servers, observing that she wished to enjoy\n",
      "a little chat with her young grand children without the restraint of their grown-up\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "Lady Wang obediently rose to her feet and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, went\n",
      "out, taking Li Wan and Wang Xi-feng with her.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia asked Dai-yu what books she was studying.\n",
      "‘The Four Books,’ said Dai-yu, and inquired in turn what books her cousins were\n",
      "currently engaged on.\n",
      "‘Gracious, child, they don’t study books,’ said her grand?mother; ‘they can barely\n",
      "read and write!’\n",
      "While they were speaking, a flurry of footsteps could be heard outside and a maid\n",
      "came in to say that Bao-yu was back.\n",
      "‘I wonder,’ thought Dai-yu, ‘just what sort of graceless creature this Bao-yu is going\n",
      "to be!’\n",
      "The young gentleman who entered in answer to her un?spoken question had a small\n",
      "jewel-encrusted gold coronet on the top of his head and a golden headband low\n",
      "down over his brow in the form of two dragons playing with a large pearl.\n",
      "He was wearing a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of dark red material with a\n",
      "\f",
      "pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold. It was confined at the waist\n",
      "with a court girdle of coloured silks braided at regular intervals into elaborate clusters\n",
      "of knotwork and terminating in long tassels.\n",
      "Over the upper part of his robe he wore a jacket of slate-blue Japanese silk damask\n",
      "with a raised pattern of eight large medallions on the front and with tasselled\n",
      "borders.\n",
      "On his feet he had half-length dress boots of black satin with thick white soles.\n",
      "As to his person, he had:\n",
      "a face like the moon of Mid-Autumn,\n",
      "a complexion like flowers at dawn,\n",
      "a hairline straight as a knife-cut,\n",
      "eyebrows that might have been painted by an artist’s brush,\n",
      "a shapely nose, and\n",
      "eyes clear as limpid pools,\n",
      "that even in anger seemed to smile,\n",
      "and, as they glared, beamed tenderness the while.\n",
      "Around his neck he wore a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon and a woven\n",
      "cord of coloured silks to which the famous jade was attached.\n",
      "Dai-yu looked at him with astonishment. How strange! How very strange! It was as\n",
      "though she had seen him somewhere before, he was so extraordinarily familiar.\n",
      "Bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother, who told him to come\n",
      "after he had seen his mother, whereupon he turned round and walked straight out\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Quite soon he was back once more, this time dressed in a completely different outfit.\n",
      "The crown and circlet had gone. She could now see that his side hair was dressed in a\n",
      "number of small braids plaited with red silk, which were drawn round to join the long\n",
      "hair at the back in a single large queue of glistening jet black, fastened at intervals\n",
      "from the nape downwards with four enormous pearls and ending in a jewelled gold\n",
      "clasp. He had changed his robe and jacket for a rather more worn-looking\n",
      "rose-coloured gown, sprigged with flowers. He wore the gold torque and his jade as\n",
      "before, and she observed that the collection of objects round his neck had been\n",
      "further augmented by a padlock-shaped amulet and a lucky charm. A pair of\n",
      "ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown, thrust\n",
      "into black and white socks trimmed with brocade. In place of the formal boots he\n",
      "was wearing thick-soled crimson slippers.\n",
      "She was even more struck than before by his fresh com?plexion. The cheeks might\n",
      "have been brushed with powder and the lips touched with rouge, so bright was their\n",
      "natural colour.\n",
      "\f",
      "His glance was soulful,\n",
      "yet from his lips the laughter often leaped;\n",
      "a world of charm upon that brow was heaped;\n",
      "a world of feeling from those dark eyes peeped.\n",
      "In short, his outward appearance was very fine. But appear?ances can be misleading.\n",
      "A perceptive poet has supplied two sets of verses, to be sung to the tune of Moon On\n",

      "Bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender, delicate girl whom he surmised to be\n",
      "his Aunt Lin’s daughter and quickly went over to greet her. Then, returning to his\n",
      "place and taking a seat, he studied her attentively. How different she seemed from\n",

      "Habit had given a melancholy cast to her tender face;\n",

      "Often the eyes swam with glistening tears;\n",
      "Often the breath came in gentle gasps.\n",
      "In stillness she made one think of a graceful flower reflected in the water;\n",

      "She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan;\n",
      "And suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi.\n",
      "Having completed his survey, Bao-yu gaved a laugh.\n",
      "‘I have seen this cousin before.’\n",
      "‘Nonsense!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How could you possibly have done?’\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but her face seems so familiar that I have the\n",
      "impression of meeting her again after a long separation.’\n",
      "‘All the better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That means that you should get on well\n",
      "together.’\n",

      "scrutiny.\n",
      "Presently: ‘Do you study books yet, cousin?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have only been taking lessons for a year or so. I can barely read\n",

      "‘What’s your name?’\n",
      "Dai-yu told him.\n",
      "‘What’s your school-name?’\n",
      "‘I haven’t got one.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed. ‘I’ll give you one, cousin. I think “Frowner” would suit you perfectly.’\n",
      "‘Where’s your reference?’ said Tan-chun.\n",
      "‘In the Encyclopedia of Men and Objects Ancient and Modern it says that\n",
      "somewhere in the West there is a mineral called “dai” which can be used instead of\n",
      "eye-black for painting the eye?brows with. She has this “dai” in her name and she\n",
      "knits her brows together in a little frown. I think it’s a splendid name for her!’\n",
      "‘I expect you made it up,’ said Tan-chun scornfully.\n",
      "‘What if I did?’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are lots of made-up things in books—apart from\n",
      "the Four Books, of course.’\n",
      "He returned to his interrogation of Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Have you got a jade?’\n",
      "The test of the company were puzzled, hut Dai-yu at once divined that he was asking\n",
      "her if she too had a jade like the one he was born with.\n",
      "‘No,’ said Dal-yu. ‘That jade of yours is a very rare object. You can’t expect\n",
      "\f",
      "everybody to have one.’\n",
      "This sent Bao-yu off instantly into one of his mad fits. Snatching the jade from his\n",
      "neck he hurled it violently on the floor as if to smash it and began abusing it\n",
      "passionately.\n",
      "‘Rare object! Rare object! What’s so lucky about a stone that can’t even tell which\n",
      "people are better than others? Beastly thing! I don’t want it!’\n",
      "The maids all seemed terrified and rushed forward to pick it up, while Grandmother\n",
      "Jia clung to Bao-yu in alarm.\n",
      "‘Naughty, naughty boy! Shout at someone or strike them if you like when you are in\n",
      "a nasty temper, but why go smashing that precious thing that your very life depends\n",
      "on?’\n",
      "‘None of the girls has got one,’ said Bao-yu, his face stream?ing with tears and\n",
      "sobbing hysterically. ‘Only I have got one. It always upsets me. And now this new\n",
      "cousin comes here who is as beautiful as an angel and she hasn’t got one either; so I\n",
      "know it can’t be any good.’\n",
      "‘Your cousin did have a jade once,’ said Grandmother Jia, coaxing him like a little\n",
      "child, ‘but because when Auntie died she couldn’t bear to leave her little girl behind,\n",
      "they had to let her take the jade with her instead. In that way your cousin could show\n",
      "her mamma how much she loved her by letting the jade be buried with her; and at\n",
      "the same time, whenever Auntie’s spirit looked at the jade, it would be just like\n",
      "looking at her own little girl again.\n",
      "‘So when your cousin said she hadn’t got one, it was only because she didn’t want\n",
      "to boast about the good, kind thing she did when she gave it to her mamma. Now\n",
      "you put yours on again like a good boy, and mind your mother doesn’t find out how\n",
      "naughty you have been.’\n",
      "So saying, she took the jade from the hands of one of the maids and hung it round\n",
      "his neck for him. And Bao-yu, after reflecting for a moment or two on what she had\n",
      "said, offered no further resistance.\n",
      "At this point some of the older women came to inquire what room Dai-yu was to\n",
      "sleep in.\n",
      "‘Move Bao-yu into the closet-bed with me,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘and put Miss\n",
      "Lin for the time being in the green muslin summer-bed. We had better wait until\n",
      "spring when the last of the cold weather is over before seeing about the rooms for\n",
      "them and getting them settled permanently.’\n",
      "‘Dearest Grannie,’ said Bao-yu pleadingly, ‘I should be perfectly all right next to the\n",
      "summer-bed. There’s no need to move me into your room. I should only keep you\n",
      "awake.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, after a moment’s reflection, gave her consent. She further gave\n",
      "\f",
      "instructions that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were each to have one nurse and one maid to\n",
      "sleep with them. The rest of their servants were to do night duty by rota in the\n",
      "adjoining room. Xi-feng had already sent across some lilac-coloured hangings,\n",
      "brocade quilts, satin coverlets and the like for Dai-yu’s bedding.\n",
      "Dai-yu had brought only two of her own people with her from home. One was her\n",
      "old wet-nurse Nannie Wang, the other was a little ten-year-old maid called\n",
      "Snowgoose. Con?sidering Snowgoose too young and irresponsible and Nannie Wang\n",
      "too old and decrepit to be of much real service, Grand?mother Jia gave Dai-yu one of\n",
      "her own maids, a body-servant of the second grade called Nightingale. She also gave\n",
      "orders that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were to be attended in other respects exactly like the\n",
      "three girls: that is to say, apart from the one wet-nurse, each was to have four other\n",
      "nurses to act as chaper?ones, two maids as body-servants to attend to their washing,\n",
      "dressing, and so forth, and four or five maids for dusting and cleaning, running\n",

      "These arrangements completed, Nannie Wang and Night?ingale accompanied Dai-yu\n",
      "to bed inside the tent-like summer?-bed, while Bao-yu’s wet-nurse Nannie Li and his\n",

      "out Pearl as a girl of tried and conspicuous fidelity and put her in charge over them. It\n",
      "was Bao-yu who was responsible for the curious name ‘Aroma’. Discovering that\n",
      "Pearl’s surname was Hua, which means ‘Flowers’, and having recently come across\n",

      "\n",
      "The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days\n",
      "\n",
      "in a book of poems, he told his grandmother that he wanted to call his new maid\n",

      "Aroma had a certain dogged streak in her nature which had made her utterly devoted\n",
      "to Grandmother Jia as long as she was Grandmother Jia’s servant, but which caused\n",
      "her to become just as exclusively and single-mindedly devoted to Bao-yu when her\n",
      "services were transferred to him. Since she found his character strange and\n",
      "incomprehensible, her simple devotion frequently impelled her to remonstrate with\n",
      "him, and when, as invariably happened, he took not the least notice of what she said,\n",
      "she was worried and hurt.\n",
      "\f",
      "That night, when Bao-yu and Nannie Li were already asleep, Aroma could hear that\n",
      "Dai-yu and Nightingale on their side of the canopy had still not settled down, so,\n",
      "when she had finished taking down her hair and making herself ready for bed, she\n",
      "tiptoed through the muslin curtains and in a friendly way inquired what was the\n",
      "matter. Dai-yu invited her to sit down, and when she had seated herself on the edge\n",
      "of the bed, Nightingale proceeded to tell her what was troubling her new mistress.\n",
      "‘Miss Lin is all upset. She has just been crying her eyes out because she says she\n",
      "only just arrived here today, and yet already she has started young hopeful off on one\n",
      "of his turns. She says if that jade had been really smashed, it would have been all her\n",
      "fault. That’s what she’s so upset about. I’ve had no end of a job trying to comfort her.’\n",
      "‘You mustn’t take on so, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘You’ll see him do much stranger things\n",
      "than that before he’s finished. If you allow yourself to feel hurt every time he carries\n",
      "on like that, he will always be hurting you. Try not to be so sensitive; Miss!’\n",
      "Dai-yu thanked her and promised to bear in mind what she had said, and after talking\n",

      "her meals and accommodation were exactly the same as for Bao-yu. The other three\n",
      "granddaughters, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi?-chun, were relegated to a secondary\n",
      "place in the old lady’s affections, and the objects of her partiality themselves began\n",
      "to feel an affection for each other which far exceeded what they felt for any of the\n",
      "rest. Sharing each other’s company every minute of the day and sleeping in the same\n",
      "room at night, they developed an understanding so intense that it was almost as if\n",
      "they had grown into a single person.\n",
      "And now suddenly this Xue Bao-chai had appeared on the scene—a young lady who,\n",
      "though very little older than Dai-yu, possessed a grown-up beauty and aplomb in\n",
      "which all agreed Dai-yu was her inferior. Moreover, in contrast to Dai-yu with her alt\n",
      "of lofty self-sufficiency and total obliviousness to all who did not move on the same\n",
      "exalted level as herself, Bao-chai had a generous, accommodating disposition which\n",
      "greatly endeared her to subordinates, so that even the tiniest maid looked on Miss\n",
      "Bao-chai as a familiar friend. Dai-yu could not but feel somewhat put out by this—a\n",
      "fact of which Bao-chai herself, however, was totally unaware.\n",
      "As for Bao-yu, he was still only a child—a child, moreover, whom nature had\n",
      "endowed with the eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. Brothers, sisters, cousins,\n",
      "were all one to him. In his relationships with people he made no distinction between\n",
      "one person and another. If his relationship with Dai-yu was exceptional, it was\n",
      "because greater proximity—since she was living with him in his grandmother’s\n",
      "quarters—made her more familiar to him than the rest; and greater familiarity bred\n",
      "greater intimacy.\n",
      "And of course, with greater intimacy came the occasional tiffs and misunderstandings\n",
      "that are usual with people who have a great deal to do with each other.\n",
      "One day the two of them had fallen out over something or other and the argument\n",
      "had ended with Dai-yu crying alone in her room and Bao-yu feeling remorsefully that\n",
      "perhaps he had spoken too roughly. Presently he went in to make his peace with her\n",

      "represented Scholarly Diligence in the person of the Han philosopher Liu Xiang at his\n",
      "book, obligingly illuminated for him by a supernatural being holding a large flaming\n",
      "torch. Bao-yu found the painting—or rather its subject—distasteful. But the pair of\n",

      "once.\n",
      "‘If this is not good enough for you,’ said Qin-shi with a laugh, ‘where are we going\n",

      "A little smile played over Bao-yu’s face and he nodded. The nurses were shocked.\n",

      "‘He won’t misbehave. Good gracious, he’s only a little boy! We don’t have to worry\n",
      "about that sort of thing yet! You know my little brother who came last month: he’s\n",

      "\f",
      "Passing inside, he saw a dozen or more large cupboards with paper strips pasted on\n",
      "their doors on which were written the names of different provinces. He was careful\n",
      "to look out for the one belonging to his own area and presently found one on which\n",
      "the paper strip said ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Main Register’. Bao-yu asked\n",
      "Disenchantment what this meant, and she explained that it was a register of the\n",
      "twelve most out-standing girls of his home province.\n",
      "‘People all say what a big place Jinling is,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Surely there should be more\n",

      "dozen we keep no records.’\n",
      "Bao-yu glanced at the other two cupboards referred to by Disenchantment. One was\n",

      "labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.2’. Stretching out his\n",
      "hand he opened the door of the second one, took out Supplementary Register No.2,\n",

      "It was a picture, but not of a person or a view.⒈The whole page was covered with\n",

      "aside, opened the door of the cupboard marked ‘Supplementary Register No. I’ and\n",
      "took out the album from that.\n",
      "As in the previous album, the first page was a picture. It represented a branch of\n",
      "cassia with a pool underneath. The water in the pool had dried up and the mud in\n",
      "the bottom was dry and cracked. Growing from it was a withered and broken lotus\n",
      "plant. The picture was followed by these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "        Your stem grew from a noble lotus root,\n",

      "\n",
      "Once more failing to make any sense of what he saw, Bao-yu picked up the Main\n",
      "Register to look at. In this album the picture on the first page represented two dead\n",
      "trees with a jade belt hanging in their branches and on the ground beneath them a\n",
      "pile of snow in which a golden hairpin lay half-buried. This was followed by a\n",

      "he knew that Disenchantment would be unwilling to divulge the secrets of her\n",
      "immortal world. Yet though he could make no sense of the book, for some reason he\n",
      "found himself unable this time to lay it down, and continued to look through it to the\n",
      "end.\n",
      "The picture that followed was of a bow with a citron hanging from it, followed by\n",

      "\n",
      "    The plum-tree bore her fruit after the rest,\n",

      "painted eaves and rafters, their doorways curtained with strings of pearls and their\n",

      "‘So this is your “honoured guest”! What do you mean by making us hurry out to\n",

      "with a conciliatory smile.\n",
      "‘Let me tell you the reason for my change of plan. It is true that I set off for the\n",

      "through the Ning mansion on my way, I happened to run into the Duke of Ning?-guo\n",

      "\f",
      "and intelligence augur well, we fear that owing to the fated eclipse of our family’s\n",
      "fortunes there will be no one at hand to give the lad proper guidance and to start\n",
      "him off along the right lines.\n",
      "‘“May we profit from the fortunate accident of this en?counter, Madam, to entreat\n",

      "some time in the future.’\n",

      "paintings by old masters, poems by new poets, and other hallmarks of gracious living.\n",
      "He was particularly delighted to observe some rouge-stained pieces of cotton-wool\n",

      "names that were equally bizarre.\n",
      "Presently the little maids came in again and proceeded to arrange some chairs\n",
      "around a table and to lay it with food and wine for a feast. In the words of the poet,\n",
      "Celestial nectar filled the crystal cup,\n",
      "And liquid gold in amber goblets glowed.\n",
      "The wine’s bouquet was delectable, and once again Bao-yu could not resist asking\n",
      "about it.\n",

      "‘You can do the twelve songs of my new song-and-dance suite “A Dream of Golden\n",

      "A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gate?way sunning their bellies\n",

      "     ‘I’ve come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before\n",
      "\f",
      "she married. Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?’\n",
      "The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion. After she had\n",
      "waited there for some considerable time one of them said, ‘If you stand at that gate\n",
      "along there on the corner, someone from inside the house should be coming out\n",
      "presently.’\n",
      "But a more elderly man among them protested that it was ‘a shame to send her on a\n",
      "fool’s errand’, and turning to Grannie Liu he said, ‘Old Zhou is away in the South at\n",
      "the moment, but his missus is still at home. She lives round at the back. You’ll have to\n",
      "go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.’\n",
      "     Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted off with little Ban-er all the way round to\n",
      "the rear entrance. There she found a number of sweetmeat vendors and toy-sellers\n",
      "who had set their wares down outside the gate and were being besieged by a crowd\n",
      "of some twenty or thirty noisy, yelling children. She grabbed a small urchin from their\n",
      "midst and drew him towards her.\n",
      "     ‘Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?’\n",
      "     The urchin stared back at her impudently.\n",
      "     ‘Which Mrs Zhou? There are several Mrs Zhous here. What’s her job?’\n",
      "‘She’s the Mrs Zhou that came here with Her Ladyship when she was married.’\n",
      "‘That’s easy,’ said the urchin. ‘Follow me!’\n",
      "He led Grannie Lin into a rear courtyard. ‘That’s where she lives,’ he said, pointing\n",
      "in the direction of a side wall. Then, bawling over the wall, ‘Mrs Zhou, there’s an\n",
      "old woman come to see you！’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife came hurrying out and asked who it was.\n",
      "‘How are you, my dear?’ said Grannie Liu, advancing with a smile. Zhou Rui’s wife\n",
      "scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her.\n",
      "‘Why, it’s Grannie Liu! How are you? It’s so many years since I saw you last, I’d\n",
      "forgotten all about you! Come in and sit down!’\n",
      "Grannie Liu followed her cackling.\n",
      "‘You know what they say: “Important people have short memories.” I wouldn’t\n",
      "expect you to remember the likes of us!’\n",
      "When they were indoors, Zhou Rui’s wife ordered her little hired help to pour out\n",
      "some tea.\n",
      "‘And hasn’t Ban-er grown a big boy!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife; then, after a few\n",
      "inquiries about the various things that had happened since they last met, she asked\n",
      "Grannie Liu about her visit.\n",
      "‘Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?’\n",
      "‘Well, of course, first and foremost we came to see you, replied Grannie Liu\n",
      "mendaciously, ‘but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship. If you\n",
      "\f",
      "could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that’s not possible, perhaps\n",
      "we could trouble you just to give her our regards.’\n",
      "From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui’s wife was already able to make a pretty good\n",
      "guess as to the real purpose of the old woman’s visit; but because some years\n",
      "previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er’s father in a dispute\n",
      "over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Iiu now, when\n",
      "she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own\n",
      "importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one.\n",
      "‘Don’t you worry, Grannie! After you’ve made such a long pilgrimage, we won’t let\n",
      "you go home without seeing a real Buddha! By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors\n",
      "has nothing to do with me. You see, we each have our own jobs here. My man’s is\n",
      "collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn; and when he’s not doing\n",
      "that, he takes the young masters out when they go on visits. That’s all he ever does.\n",
      "Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go\n",
      "out. But being as how you are a relation of Her ladyship, and since you’ve put your\n",
      "confidence in me and turned to me to help you, I don’t mind breaking the rules for\n",
      "once and taking in a message.\n",
      "‘There’s only one thing, though. I don’t expect you know, but things here are very\n",
      "different from what they were five years ago. Nowadays Her Ladyship doesn’t run\n",
      "things here any longer. It’s Master Lian’s wife who does all the managing—You’ll\n",
      "never guess who that is: Her Ladyship’s niece Wang Xi-feng. You know, Her Ladyship’s\n",
      "eldest brothers daughter, that we used to call “Feng-ge” when she was a child’\n",
      "‘Bless you, my dear, for being such a help!’ said Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Oh Grannie, how can you say such a thing?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife demurely. ‘You\n",
      "know what the old saying is, “He who helps others helps himself.” It’s only a question\n",
      "of saying a few words. No trouble at all.’\n",
      "So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady\n",
      "Jia’s quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet. The little maid departed on her\n",
      "errand and the two women resumed their conversation.\n",
      "‘This Mrs Lian,’ said Grannie Liu: ‘she can’t be more than eighteen or nineteen\n",
      "years old. She must be a very capable young woman. Fancy her being able to run a\n",
      "great household like this!’\n",
      "‘Oh Grannie, you have no idea!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Mrs Lian may be young, but\n",
      "when it comes to doing things, she’s got an older head on her shoulders than any I’ve\n",
      "ever come across. She’s grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian. But sharp!\n",
      "Well, if it ever comes to a slanging match, she can talk down ten grown men any day\n",
      "of the week! Wait till you meet her, and you’ll see what I mean. There’s only one\n",
      "thing, though. She’s a bit too strict with those beneath her.’\n",
      "\f",
      "As she was speaking, the little maid came back, her errand completed.\n",
      "‘They’ve finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship’s. Mrs Lian is still there.’\n",
      "Thou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise.\n",
      "‘Quick! After she comes out from there she’ll be free for a few minutes while she\n",
      "has her meal. We must try and catch her then. If we delay a moment longer, people\n",
      "will start coming in with messages and we shan’t have a chance to speak to her. And\n",
      "once she goes off for her afternoon nap, we’ve really lost her!’\n",
      "Grannie Liu got off the kang, adjusted her clothing, con?ducted Ban-er through a\n",
      "rapid revision of his little stock of phrases and followed Thou Rui’s wife through\n",
      "various twists and turns to Jia Lian’s quarters. Just before they reached them, Zhou\n",
      "Rui’s wife planted them both in a covered passage-way while she went on ahead\n",
      "round the screen wall and into the gate of the courtyard. First ascertaining that Wang\n",
      "Xi-feng had not yet left Lady Jia’s, she sought out Xi-feng’s chambermaid and\n",
      "principal confidante, Patience, and primed her with a full account of Grannie Liu’s\n",
      "antecedents.\n",
      "‘She has come all this way today to pay her respects,’ she concluded. ‘At one time\n",
      "Her Ladyship used to see quite a lot of her, which is why I thought it would be in\n",
      "order for me to bring her in. I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come\n",
      "back and explain it all to her. I hope she won’t be angry with me for pushing myself\n",
      "forward.’\n",
      "Patience at once made up her mind what to do.\n",
      "‘Let them come in here. They can sit here while they are waiting.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife went off again to fetch her charges. As they ascended the steps to the\n",
      "main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portère\n",
      "for them to enter. A strange, delicious fragrance seemed to reach forward and enfold\n",
      "them as they entered, producing in Grannie Liu the momentary sensation that she\n",
      "had been transported bodily to one of the celestial paradises. Their eyes, too, were\n",
      "dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room. Temporarily\n",
      "speechless with wonder, Grannie Liu stood wagging her head, alternating clicks of\n",
      "admiration with pious ejaculations.\n",
      "From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in\n",
      "which Jia Lian’s baby daughter slept. Patience, who was standing by the edge of the\n",

      "corresponded with what she had been told of Wang Xi-feng, and taking the maid for\n",
      "the mistress, was on the point of greeting her as ‘Gou-er’s aunt, when Zhou Rui’s wife\n",
      "\f",
      "introduced her as ‘Miss Patience. Then, when Patience shortly afterwards addressed\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife as ‘Mrs Zhou’, she knew that this was no mistress but a very\n",
      "high-class maid. So Grannie Liu and Ban-er got up on the kang at one side, while\n",
      "Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife sat near the edge of it on the other, and a little maid\n",
      "came in and poured them all some tea.\n",
      "Grannie Liu’s attention was distracted by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike\n",
      "the sound made by a flour-bolting machine, and she could not forbear glancing\n",
      "round her from time to time to see where it came from. Presently she caught sight of\n",
      "a sort of boxlike object fastened to one of the central pillars of the room, and a thing\n",
      "like the weight of a steelyard hanging down from it, which swung to and fro in\n",
      "ceaseless motion and appeared to be the source of the noise which had distracted\n",
      "her.\n",
      "‘I wonder what that can be,’ she thought to herself, ‘and what it can be used for?’\n",
      "As she studied the strange box, it suddenly gave forth a loud dong! like the sound of\n",
      "a bronze bell or a copper chime, which so startled the old lady that her eyes nearly\n",
      "popped out of her head. The dong! was followed in rapid succession by eight or nine\n",
      "others, and Grannie Liu was on the point of asking what it meant, when all the maids\n",
      "in the house began scurrying about shouting, ‘The mistress! The mistress! She’ll be\n",
      "coming out now!’ and Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to their feet.\n",
      "‘Just stay here, Grannie,’ they said. ‘When it is time for you to see her, we shall\n",
      "come in and fetch you’; and they went off with the other servants to greet their\n",
      "mistress.\n",
      "As Grannie Liu sat in silence, waiting with bated breath and head cocked to one side\n",
      "for her summons, she heard a far-off sound of laughter, followed presently by a\n",
      "sound of rustling dresses as between ten and twenty women entered the reception\n",
      "room and passed from it into the room beyond. Then two or three women bearing\n",
      "large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which\n",
      "she sat and stood there waiting to be called. A voice in the far room called out, ‘Serve\n",
      "now, please!’ at which, to judge from the noises, most of the women scuttled off,\n",
      "leaving only the few who were waiting at table. A long silence ensued in which not so\n",
      "much as a cheep could be heard; then two women came in bearing a small, low table\n",
      "which they set down on the kang. It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all\n",
      "kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched. At\n",
      "the sight of it Ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and was silenced by Grannie Liu\n",
      "with a resounding slap.\n",
      "Just at that moment Zhou Rui’s wife appeared, her face all wreathed in smiles, and\n",
      "advanced towards Grannie Liu beckoning. Grannie Liu slipped off the kang, lifted\n",
      "down Ban-er, and exchanged a few hurried whispers with her in the reception room\n",
      "\f",
      "before waddling into the room beyond.\n",
      "A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway. Inside, under\n",
      "the window in the south wall, there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet. At\n",
      "the east end of the kang, up against the wooden partition wall, were a back?rest and\n",
      "bolster, both covered in gold brocade, and a large flat cushion for sitting on, also\n",
      "glittering with gold thread. Beside them stood a silver spittoon.\n",
      "Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable, which she wore about the house for\n",
      "warmth, fastened on with a pearl ?studded bandeau. She was dressed in a sprigged\n",
      "peach-pink gown, with an ermine-lined skirt of dark-red foreign crepe underneath it,\n",
      "and a cloak of slate-blue silk with woven coloured insets and lining of grey squirrel\n",
      "around her shoul?ders. Her face was exquisitely made-up. She was sitting on the\n",
      "edge of the kang, her back straight as a ramrod, with a dimin?utive pair of tongs in\n",
      "her hand, removing the spent charcoal from a portable hand-warmer. Patience stood\n",
      "beside her carrying a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray. Xi-feng appeared\n",
      "not to have noticed her, for she neither reached out for the cup nor raised her head,\n",
      "but continued picking ab?sorbedly at her hand-warmer. At last she spoke:\n",
      "‘Why not ask them in, then?’\n",
      "As she did so, she raised her head and saw Zhou Rui’s wife with her two charges\n",
      "already standing in front of her. She made a confused movement as if to rise to her\n",
      "feet, welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence, and almost in\n",
      "the same breath said rather crossly to Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’\n",
      "By this time Grannie Liu was already down on her knees and had touched her head\n",
      "several times to the floor in reverence to her ‘Aunt Feng’.\n",
      "‘Stop her, Zhou dear!’ said Xi-feng in alarm. ‘She mustn’t do that, I am much too\n",
      "young! In any case, I don’t know her very well. I don’t know what sort of relations we\n",
      "are and what I should call her.’\n",
      "‘This is the Grannie Liu I was just telling you about,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.\n",
      "Xi-feng nodded, and Grannie Liu sat herself down on the edge of the kang Ban-er at\n",
      "once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would\n",
      "induce him to come out and make a bow to his ‘Auntie’.\n",
      "‘Relations don’t come to see us much nowadays,’ said Xi-feng affably. ‘We’re\n",
      "getting to be quite strangers with everybody. People who know us realize that it is\n",
      "because you are tired of us that you don’t visit us oftener; but some spiteful people\n",
      "who don’t know us so well think it’s our fault, because we have grown too proud.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Grannie Liu invoked the Lord Buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view.\n",
      "‘It’s hard times that keeps us away. We can’t afford to visit. We are afraid that if we\n",
      "came to see you looking the way we are, you would disown us; and even the people\n",
      "\f",
      "at the gate might think we were tramps!’\n",
      "‘Now you are really being too hard on us! What if Grand?father did make a little bit\n",
      "of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment? What does\n",
      "it all amount to? It’s all empty show, really. You know what they say: “Even the\n",
      "Emperor has poor relations.” It would be strange indeed if we didn’t have a few!’\n",
      "She turned to Thou Rui’s wife.\n",
      "‘Have you told Her Ladyship yet?’\n",
      "‘No, ma’am. I was waiting for your instructions.’\n",
      "‘Go and have a look, then. If she has anyone with her, you had better leave it; but if\n",
      "she is free, tell her about their visit and see what she says.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife departed on her errand.\n",
      "Xi-feng told one of the servants to give Ban-er a handful of sweets, and had just\n",
      "begun a desultory conversation with Grannie Liu when a number of domestics and\n",
      "underlings of either sex arrived to report on their duties.\n",
      "‘I am entertaining a guest,’ said Xi-feng to Patience when she came in to announce\n",
      "their arrival. ‘Let them leave it until this evening. But if anyone has important\n",
      "business, bring them in and I will deal with it now.’\n",
      "Patience went out and returned a minute later to say that she had asked them and\n",
      "no one had any business of special importance, so she had sent them all away.\n",
      "Xi-feng nodded.\n",
      "At this point Zhou Rui’s wife returned with a message for Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Her Ladyship says she isn’t free today, but that if you will entertain them for her, it\n",
      "will be just the same as if she were to receive them herself. She says please thank\n",
      "them very much for coming. And she says if it’s just an ordinary visit she has nothing\n",
      "more to add; but if they have anything particular to say, she says tell them that they\n",
      "can say it to you instead.’\n",
      "‘I hadn’t anything particular in mind,’ said Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Only to look in on Her Ladyship and your mistress. Just a visit to relations.’\n",
      "‘Well all right then, if you are sure you have nothing to say. But if you have got\n",
      "anything to say, you really ought to tell the mistress. It will be just the same as if you\n",
      "were to say it to Her Ladyship.’ Zhou Rui’s wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie\n",
      "Liu as she said this.\n",
      "Grannie Liu perfectly well understood the significance of this look, and a blush of\n",
      "shame overspread her face. Yet if she did not speak up now, what would have been\n",
      "the purpose of her visit? She forced herself to say something.\n",
      "‘By rights I ought not to mention it today, seeing that this is our first meeting: but\n",
      "as I have come such a long way to see you, it seems silly not to speak…’\n",
      "She had got no further when the pages from the outer gate announced the arrival of\n",
      "\f",
      "‘the young master from the Ning mansion’ and Xi-feng gestured to her to stop.\n",
      "‘It’s all right. There is no need to tell me.’ She turned to the pages. ‘Where is Master\n",
      "Rong, then ?’\n",
      "A man’s footstep sounded outside and a fresh-faced, willowy youth of seventeen or\n",
      "eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress came into the room.\n",
      "Grannie Liu, acutely embarrassed in this male presence, did not know whether to sit\n",
      "or stand, and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself. Xi-feng laughed\n",
      "at her discomfiture.\n",
      "‘Don’t mind him; just stay where you are! It’s only ray nephew.’\n",
      "With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again, perching herself\n",
      "obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang.\n",
      "Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion.\n",
      "‘My father is entertaining an important visitor tomorrow and he wondered if he\n",
      "might borrow the little glass screen that your Uncle Wang’s wife gave you, to put on\n",
      "our kang while he is there. We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.’\n",
      "‘You are too late,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I lent it yesterday to someone else.\n",
      "Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang.\n",
      "‘If you won’t lend it, my father will say that I didn’t ask properly and I shall get a\n",
      "beating. Come on, Auntie, be a sport! Just for my sake!’\n",
      "Xi-feng smiled maliciously.\n",
      "‘I don’t know what’s so special about my family’s things. Heaven knows, you have\n",
      "enough stuff of your own over there; yet you have only to set eyes on anything of\n",
      "ours, and you want it for yourselves.’\n",
      "Jia Rong’s smile flashed again.\n",
      "‘Please, Auntie! Be merciful!’\n",
      "‘If it’s the tiniest bit chipped,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll have the hide off you!’\n",
      "She ordered Patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable\n",
      "servants to carry it over. Delighted with his good luck, Jia Rong hurriedly forestalled\n",
      "her.\n",
      "‘I’ll get some of my own people to carry it. Don’t put yours to a lot of trouble!’ and\n",
      "he hurried out.\n",
      "Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the\n",
      "window, ‘Rong, come back! ‘\n",
      "Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, ‘Master Rong, you’re wanted\n",
      "back again!’\n",
      "Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with\n",
      "eyebrows arched inquiringly.\n",
      "Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying\n",
      "\f",
      "nothing. Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh:\n",
      "‘It doesn’t matter. Come back again after supper. I’ve got company now, and\n",
      "besides, I don’t feel in the mood to tell you.’\n",
      "‘Yes, Aunt,’ said Jia Rong, and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he\n",
      "sauntered slowly out of the room.\n",
      "Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again:\n",
      "‘The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and\n",
      "Ma haven’t anything in the house to eat, and the weather is getting colder,\n",
      "and—and—I thought I’d bring him here to see you ...’ She gave Ban-er a despairing\n",
      "push. ‘What did your Pa tell you to say when we got here? What was it he sent us for?\n",
      "Look at you! All you can do is sit there eating sweets!’\n",
      "It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on,\n",
      "and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile.\n",
      "‘It’s quite all right. There is no need to tell me. I quite understand.’ She turned to\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today ?’\n",
      "‘We were on our way first thing this morning,’ Grannie Liu chimed in. ‘There was no\n",
      "time to think about eating.’\n",
      "Xi-feng gave orders for a meal to be brought in, and Zhou Rui’s wife went out and\n",
      "presently reappeared with a guest’s portion of various choice dishes on a little table,\n",
      "which she set down in the east wing, and to which she then conducted Grannie Liu\n",
      "and Ban-er for their meal.\n",
      "‘Zhou, dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘will you keep them company and see that they have\n",
      "enough to eat? I shan’t be able to sit with them myself.’ Then calling her aside for a\n",
      "moment she asked, ‘What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them\n",
      "just now?’\n",
      "‘She said they don’t really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan\n",
      "years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office. She\n",
      "said they haven’t been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used\n",
      "to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed. She said it was nice of them to\n",
      "come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately. And\n",
      "she said if they appear to want anything, she would leave it to you to decide what we\n",
      "should do for them.’\n",
      "‘No wonder!’ exclaimed Xi-feng when she had heard this account. ‘I couldn’t\n",
      "understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them.’\n",
      "While they were talking, Grannie Liu came back from the other room having already\n",
      "finished eating, smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively, and voicing\n",
      "her thanks for the repast.\n",
      "‘Sit down,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I have something to say to you. I quite\n",
      "\f",
      "understand what you were trying to tell me just now. As we are relations, we ought\n",
      "by rights not to wait for you to come to our door before helping you when you are in\n",
      "trouble; but there are so many things to attend to in this family, and now that Her\n",
      "Ladyship is getting on a bit she doesn’t always remember them all. And since I took\n",
      "over the management of the household, I find there are quite a lot of relations that I\n",
      "don’t even know about. And then again, of course, though we may look thriving\n",
      "enough from the out?side, people don’t realize that being a big establishment like\n",
      "ours carries its own difficulties. They won’t believe it if you tell them, but it’s true.\n",
      "However, since you have come such a long way, and since this is the first time you\n",
      "have ever said a word about needing help, we obviously can’t let you go back\n",
      "empty-handed. Fortunately it so happens that I still haven’t touched any of the\n",
      "twenty taels of silver that Her Ladyship gave me the other day to make clothes for\n",
      "the maids with. If you don’t mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.’\n",
      "When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about ‘difficulties’ she concluded that there was\n",
      "no hope. Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she\n",
      "heard that she was, after all, to be given twenty taels of sliver can be imagined.\n",
      "‘We knew you had your troubles,’ she said, ‘but as the saying goes, “A starved\n",
      "camel is bigger than a fat horse.” Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is\n",
      "thicker than a man’s waist to folks like us!’\n",
      "Horrified by the crudity of these expressions, Zhou Rui’s wife, who was standing by,\n",
      "was meanwhile signaling fran?tically to the old lady to stop. But Xi-feng laughed\n",
      "quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string\n",
      "of cash to go with it. The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Here is the twenty taels of silver,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Take this for the time being to make\n",
      "some winter clothes for the children with. Some time later on, when you have\n",
      "nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship’s sake. It’s late now, so\n",
      "I won’t try to keep you. Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered\n",
      "when you get back!’\n",
      "She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt ex?pressions of gratitude, picked\n",
      "up the money and followed Zhou Rui’s wife out of the room.\n",
      "‘My dear good woman,’ said the latter when they were out of earshot, ‘whatever\n",
      "came over you? First, when you met her, you couldn’t get a word out; then, when\n",
      "you did start talking, it was all “your nephew” this and “your nephew” that! I hope\n",
      "you won’t mind my saying so, but even if the child was a real nephew you would still\n",
      "need to go a bit easy on the familiarities. Now Master Rong, he is her real nephew.\n",
      "That’s the sort of person a lady like that calls “nephew”. Where she would come by a\n",
      "nephew like this one, I just do not know!’\n",
      "‘My dear,’ replied Grannie Liu with a laugh, ‘when I saw the pretty little darling\n",
      "\f",
      "sitting there, I took such a liking to her that my heart was too full to speak.’\n",
      "Back in Zhou Rui’s quarters the two women sat talking for a while. Grannie Liu\n",
      "wanted to leave a piece of silver to buy something for the Zhou children with, but\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife said she wouldn’t hear of it and refused absolutely to accept anything.\n",
      "And so, with many expressions of gratitude, the old lady took her leave and set out\n",
      "once more through the back gate of the mansion.\n",
      "And if you want to know what happened after she had left, you will have to read the\n",

      "she had gone off to visit Aunt Xue. Zhou Rui’s wife accordingly went out by the gate\n",
      "in the east corner of the compound, crossed the eastern courtyard, and made her\n",
      "way to Pear Tree Court. As she reached the gate of the Court, she came upon Lady\n",
      "Wang’s maid, Golden, playing on the front steps with a young girl. Golden realized\n",
      "that Zhou Rui’s wife must have come with a message for Lady Wang and indicated\n",

      "Bao-chai, dressed in workaday clothes, her hair unadorned and twisted in a knot on\n",
      "top of her head, sat with her maid Oriole over a little table towards the back of the\n",

      "them.\n",
      "     ‘How are you, Miss? asked Zhou Rui’s wife, returning her smile and sitting down\n",
      "on the edge of the kang. ‘I haven’t seen you over our side these last two or three\n",
      "days. Has Master Bao been upsetting you?’\n",
      "     ‘Good gracious, no!’ said Bao-chai with a laugh. ‘I’ve had an attack of my old\n",

      "the only reason.’\n",
      "     ‘Very sensible!’ said Zhou Ruj’s wife. ‘But what is this sickness of yours, Miss?\n",
      "Oughtn’t you to call in a doctor and get it properly seen to? It’s no joke when a young\n",
      "person of your age lets an illness get its grip on them.’\n",
      "     ‘Oh, don’t talk about my illness I’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t know how many doctors\n",
      "we must have consulted about it, and how many medicines I must have swallowed,\n",
      "or how much money we must have spent on it - all without any benefit whatsoever.\n",
      "In the end we were fortunate enough to hear of a monk who specialized in treating\n",
      "illnesses that other people couldn’t diagnose and asked him to have a look at me. He\n",
      "said that I had a congenital tendency to overheatedness, but that fortunately, as my\n",
      "constitution was a strong one, it wasn’t serious. He said the usual medicines\n",
      "wouldn’t do it any good, and he gave us a prescription supposed to have been\n",
      "handed down from the Immortals of the Islands. He also gave us a packet of powder\n",
      "\f",
      "with a very unusual fragrance which he said was to be used as the base. He said that\n",
      "if each time I had a turn I took just one of the pills made up from this prescription,\n",
      "the sickness would go away. And the remarkable thing is that they really have proved\n",
      "quite effective.’\n",
      "‘What was this prescription, Miss? If you will tell me, I shall try to remember it so\n",

      "illness, I could do them a charity, couldn’t I?’\n",
      "‘You don’t know what you are asking,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s such a finicky prescription,\n",
      "it would drive anyone mad trying to make it up. It’s not so much the materials. There\n",
      "is, after all, a limit to the number of drugs from one part of the world or another that\n",

      "Rain Days in the second month...\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.\n",
      "‘Why, that’s already three years it would take! And suppose it didn’t rain that year\n",
      "on the Rain Days?’\n",
      "‘Exactly,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Rain is seldom so obliging. You would just have to wait till\n",
      "the next year. Then you have to collect twelve drams of dew on the day White Dew in\n",
      "the ninth month, twelve drams of frost at Frost Fall in the tenth, and twelve drams of\n",
      "snow at Lesser Snow in the last month of the year, stir these four kinds of water into\n",
      "the mixture, make it up into pills about the size of a longan, and store the pills in an\n",
      "old porcelain jar. The jar is supposed to be buried in a flower bed and only dug up\n",
      "when you have an attack of the illness. Then one of the pills is taken out and\n",
      "swallowed in hot water into which one and a quarter drams of tincture of\n",
      "phellodendron has been stirred.’\n",
      "‘God bless my soul!’ Zhou Rui’s wife exclaimed. ‘You would certainly need some\n",
      "patience! Why, you might wait ten years before getting all those things at the proper\n",
      "times!’\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we were lucky. Within only a year or two of the monk’s visit\n",
      "we had managed to get all the ingredients together and were able to make up the\n",
      "pills without trouble. We brought them with us when we came to live here and have\n",

      "‘Tell me, Miss, what exactly is this illness of yours?’\n",
      "‘It doesn’t really bother me very much. It makes me cough and wheeze a bit. But as\n",
      "soon as I have taken one of the pills, it goes away.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask something else when they were interrupted by a\n",
      "call from Lady Wang:\n",
      "‘Who have you got in there?’\n",
      "She hurried back into the outer room to make her report on Grannie Liu. Having\n",
      "finished it, she waited for some comment from Lady Wang, but finding that none was\n",
      "forth?coming, was on the point of withdrawing when Aunt Xue smilingly enjoined\n",
      "her to stay.\n",
      "‘Just a moment! There is something I should like you to take for me.’\n",
      "She called to someone outside.\n",
      "‘Caltrop!’\n",
      "The rings of the portière rattled and the young girl whom Zhou Rui’s wife had seen a\n",
      "few minutes before playing on the steps with Golden came into the room.\n",
      "‘You called, Madam?’\n",
      "‘Bring me that box with the flowers in!’\n",
      "Caltrop went into a side room and returned with a small embroidered box.\n",
      "‘There are twelve artificial flowers in here,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘They were made in the\n",
      "Imperial Palace, all in the latest fashion. I suddenly thought to myself yesterday what\n",
      "a pity it was to leave them lying around here doing nothing, and how much nicer it\n",
      "would be to give them to the girls to wear. I meant to send them round yesterday but\n",
      "forgot. It’s lucky that you came here today, because you will be able to take them for\n",
      "me. There are two each for each of the Jia girls. That leaves six. Then two for Miss Lin,\n",
      "and the remaining four for Mrs Lian.’\n",
      "‘Keep them for Bao-chai to wear,’ said Lady Wang. ‘What do you want to go\n",
      "bothering about our girls for?’\n",
      "‘You don’t know our Bao-chai. She is funny about these things. She has never liked\n",
      "ornaments or make-up or anything of that sort.’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife took up the box and went out into the courtyard, where she came\n",
      "once more upon Golden, sunning herself on the steps.\n",
      "‘Tell me,’ she asked her, ‘is that little Caltrop the one they are always talking about\n",
      "who was bought just before they came to the capital? The one they had the murder\n",
      "trial about?’\n",
      "‘That’s her,’ said Golden.\n",
      "\f",
      "At that moment Caltrop herself came skipping up with a sunny smile on her face, and\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife took her by the hand and studied her curiously. Then she turned to\n",
      "Golden again.\n",
      "‘You know, there’s something about this child’s face that reminds me of Master\n",
      "Rong’s wife over at the Ning mansion.’\n",
      "‘That’s just what I’ve said,’ Golden agreed.\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife asked Caltrop how old she was when she became a slave. Then she\n",
      "asked her where her parents were, what her age was, and what part of the country\n",
      "she came from. But to all of these questions Caltrop only shook her head and said\n",
      "that she didn’t remember.\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife and Golden exchanged glances and sighed sympathetically.\n",
      "Bearing her box of flowers, Zhou Rui’s wife presently came to the part of the house\n",
      "behind Lady Wang’s quarters. Grand?mother Jia had recently decided that her\n",
      "granddaughters were becoming too numerous and declared that she would retain\n",
      "only Bao-yu and Dai-yu in her own apartments to keep her amused. Ying-chun,\n",
      "Tan-chun and Xi-chun were to move out into the penthouse behind Lady Wang’s,\n",
      "with Li Wan to supervise them and keep them company. Thither, accordingly, Zhou\n",
      "Rui’s wife now directed her steps.\n",
      "A number of little maids were sitting under the eaves there waiting to be called, and\n",
      "just as she arrived, Ying-chun’s maid Chess and Tan-chun’s maid Scribe came through\n",
      "the portière, each carrying a teacup on a tray, from which she deduced that the two\n",
      "cousins must be inside together.\n",
      "On entering the room, Zhou’s wife found Ying-chun and Tan-chun sitting by the\n",
      "window playing Go. She presented the flowers and explained who they were from,\n",
      "and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks, and gave\n",
      "orders to the maids to take charge of them.\n",
      "‘Where is Miss Xi-chun?’ Zhou Rui’s wife inquired.\n",
      "‘Isn’t she in the next room?’ said the maids; and there in fact she proved to be,\n",
      "playing with the little nun Sapientia from Water-moon Priory. She asked Zhou Rui’s\n",
      "wife what she had come for, and when Zhou Rui’s wife took the flowers from the box\n",
      "and explained, she laughed:\n",
      "‘I was telling Sapientia that one of these day I am going to have my hair shaved and\n",
      "go off with her to be a nun, when just at that very moment you came in with these\n",
      "flowers. What shall I do with flowers when I have no hair to stick them in?’\n",
      "Further pleasantries followed from the others present.\n",
      "Xi-chun told one of the maids to take the flowers and look after them.\n",
      "‘When did you arrive?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked Sapientia. ‘And where’s that precious\n",
      "Mother Superior of yours gone off to, bald-headed old mischief?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘We arrived first thing this morning,’ said Sapientia. ‘Mother Euergesia went off to\n",
      "visit the Yu mansion after she had seen Her Ladyship. She told me to wait for her\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "Have you had this month’s donation yet?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘It was due on the\n",
      "fifteenth.’\n",
      "Sapientia said that she didn’t know.\n",
      "‘Who looks after the monthly donations nowadays?’ asked Xi-chun.\n",
      "‘Yu Xin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.\n",
      "‘That explains it. As soon as Mother Euergesia arrived, Yu Xin’s wife was in here like\n",
      "a shot and they were chattering together for ages. I expect that’s what it was about.’\n",
      "After gossiping a bit longer with Sapientia, Zhou Rui’s wife made her way to Xi-feng’s\n",
      "quarters. To get there she had to go down a passage-way between two walls, under\n",
      "the windows at the back of Li Wan’s apartments, along the foot of an ornamental\n",
      "wail, and through a gateway in the western cornet of the compound. When she\n",
      "entered Xi-feng’s reception room, a maid sitting on the threshold of the inner room\n",
      "hurriedly waved her away and told her to go across to the other side of the house.\n",
      "Taking the hint, Zhou Rui’s wife tiptoed quietly into the room opposite, where she\n",
      "found the baby’s nurse patting her rhythmically to make her sleep.\n",
      "‘Is the mistress taking her afternoon nap?’ she asked the nurse in a low whisper. ‘I\n",
      "think you’ll have to wake her, even if she is.’\n",
      "The nurse smiled, grimaced, and shook her head. Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask\n",
      "her what she meant when she heard a low laugh in what was unmistakably Jia Lian’s\n",
      "voice from the room opposite. It was followed almost immediately by the sound of\n",
      "the door opening, and Patience came out carrying a large copper basin which she\n",
      "asked one of the maids to fetch water in.\n",
      "‘Ah, Mrs Zhou!’ she said, catching sight of Zhou Rui’s wife and crossing into the\n",
      "room opposite ‘What brings you back again?’\n",
      "         Zhou Rui’s wife hastily rose to her feet and picking up the box, proferred it\n",
      "to Patience and explained her mission. Patience opened the lid, selected four of the\n",
      "flowers, and slipped away again for several minutes. She came back with two still in\n",
      "her hand, which she gave to a little page called Sunshine.\n",
      "‘Take these to Master Rong’s wife over in the Ning mansion and tell her they are for\n",
      "her to wear,’ she said. Then turning to Zhou Rui’s wife she asked her to convey\n",
      "Xi-feng’s thanks to the donor.\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Just as\n",
      "she was coming out of the covered passage-way, she ran head-on into her daughter,\n",
      "all dressed up in her best clothes having just arrived on a visit from her\n",
      "mother-in-law’s.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘What’s suddenly brought you here at a time like this ?’ she asked her daughter.\n",
      "‘How have you been keeping, Mother? I’ve been waiting at your place for hours for\n",
      "you to come back. What’s been keeping you all this time? I got tired of waiting. I\n",
      "thought I’d go and say “hullo” to Her Old Ladyship, and now I was just on my way to\n",
      "see Her Ladyship. Have you still not finished then? What’s that you’ve got in your\n",
      "hand?’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.\n",
      "‘Today is not my lucky day! First of all someone called Grannie Liu turned up, so like\n",
      "a fool I spend half the day rushing around with her. Then, as if that wasn’t enough,\n",
      "Her Ladyships sister sees me and gets me delivering flowers to the young ladies. I\n",
      "haven’t finished yet. Now what have you come here today for? Something’s gone\n",
      "wrong, I’ll be bound !’\n",
      "‘I don’t know how you always manage to guess, Mother, but you’re right: it has. I’ll\n",
      "be honest with you. My man had a cup too much to drink the other day and got into\n",
      "a fight with someone, and now, out of spite, they are trying to stir up trouble for him.\n",
      "They say his papers aren’t in order, and they’ve reported him to the yamen and want\n",
      "to get him deported back South to his old village. So I thought I’d come and ask your\n",
      "advice, Mother, and see if you couldn’t get someone here to put in a word for him.\n",
      "Do you think there’s anyone who would be able to help?’\n",
      "‘I knew it would be something like this,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Well, cheer up, it’s\n",
      "not so serious as all that! You just go back and wait while I take these flowers to Miss\n",
      "Lin. You can’t see Her Ladyship now. She and the young mistress are both busy.’\n",
      "     The daughter obediently turned back to her mother’s quarters. As she went, she\n",
      "said pleadingly,\n",
      "     ‘Be as quick as you can, Mother, won’t you?’\n",
      "     ‘Yes, yes, yes. I’ll be as quick as I can! You young people take everything so\n",
      "tragically! Lack of experience, that’s what it is!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, and moved on to\n",
      "Dai-yu’s room.\n",
      "     Dai-yu was not in her own room, but with Bao-yu, trying to undo metal puzzles.\n",
      "     ‘Miss Lin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife with a smile, ‘Mrs Xue asked me to give you these\n",
      "flowers.’\n",
      "     ‘What flowers ?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let me see!’\n",
      "     He stretched out his arm, took the box from Zhou Rui’s wife, and looked. Two\n",
      "artificial flowers, exquisitely fashioned by Palace craftsmen out of silk gauze, lay\n",
      "inside it. Dai-yu glanced over his arm into the box.\n",
      "     ‘Am I the only one getting these, or have the others had some too?’\n",
      "     ‘All the young ladies are getting them,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘These two are for\n",
      "you, Miss.’\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘I thought as much,’ said Dai-yu sneeringly. ‘I get the leavings when everyone\n",
      "else has had their pick.’\n",
      "     Zhou Rui’s wife received this sally in silence, not daring to retort.\n",
      "     ‘What were you doing at my aunt’s place, Zhou?’ Bao-yu asked.\n",
      "     ‘Her Ladyship was there, and I had something to tell her.\n",
      "Then while I was over there, Mrs Xue took the opportunity of giving me these flowers\n",
      "to deliver for her.’\n",
      "          Was Miss Bao-chai there?’ Bao-yu asked. ‘Why hasn’t she been round these\n",
      "last few days?’\n",
      "‘She’s not very well.’\n",
      "Bao-yu turned to his maids.\n",
      "‘Which of you will go and see Miss Bao-chai for me? Say that Miss Lin and I send\n",
      "our regards to her and her mother, and ask her if her illness is any better and what\n",
      "she’s taking for it. Say that I really ought to go myself, but that as I’ve just got back\n",
      "from my lessons and have caught a bit of a cold, I shall be coming round another day.’\n",
      "Snowpink said that she would go, and she and Zhou Rui’s wife left the room together\n",
      "and went their separate ways.\n",
      "This son-in-law of Zhou Rui’s who had got himself into trouble was none other than\n",
      "Jia Yu-cun’s old friend, Leng Zi-xing. He had recently become involved in a lawsuit\n",
      "arising out of the sale of some antiques, and had asked his wife to get strings pulled\n",
      "for him at the mansion. Zhou Rui’s wife made light of the affair, confident of her\n",
      "employers’ power to in?fluence. A word to Xi-feng in the evening, and it would be as\n",
      "good as settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "At lighting-up time that evening Xi-feng came in partial négligé(having removed her\n",
      "ornaments for the night) to report on the day’s affairs to Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘Today I received the things sent us by the Zhen family. The Zhens have their own\n",
      "boat delivering seasonal produce for the New Year, so I have given their people our\n",
      "presents to the Zhens to take back on their return journey.’\n",
      "Lady Wang nodded.\n",
      "‘I’ve got our birthday presents ready for the Earl of Lin?an’s mother,’ continued\n",
      "Xi-feng. ‘Who would you like us to send with them ?’\n",
      "‘Just see which women are free and send four of them,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘You\n",
      "don’t have to ask me about things like that I’\n",
      "‘Today Cousin Zhen’s wife invited me to spend tomorrow with them at the other\n",
      "\f",
      "house,’ Xi-feng continued. ‘Is there anything tomorrow that needs doing here ?’\n",
      "‘Whether there is or not,’ said Lady Wang, ‘I don’t see that it matters. Generally\n",
      "when she brings an invitation it is for all of us, and you are naturally too busy to go.\n",
      "This time the invitation is to you personally, which shows that she had deliberately\n",
      "arranged this in order to give you a rest. The thought is a kind one, and it would be\n",
      "ungrateful to refuse. I think you ought to go.’\n",
      "By now Li Wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty, and when\n",
      "all had wished Lady Wang good night they departed to their different rooms.\n",
      "Next day, as soon as Xi-feng had completed her toilet, she first reported to Lady\n",
      "Wang and then went to take her leave of Grandmother Jia. Hearing that she was\n",
      "going to the other house, Bao-yu said he wanted to go too, and Xi-feng was obliged\n",
      "to say that she would take him and to stand waiting for him while he changed his\n",
      "clothes. The two then got into a mule-cart and were soon inside the Ning-guo\n",
      "mansion, where Cousin Zhen’s wife You-shi, her son Jia Rong, her little\n",
      "daughter-in-law Qin-shi, and a large number of women attendants and maids were\n",
      "standing outside the inner gate ready to welcome them.\n",
      "You-shi’s encounters with Xi-feng were always the oc?casion of good-humoured\n",
      "banter. Taking Bao-yu by the hand and chatting to Xi-feng, she conducted them both\n",
      "into the main reception room, where they all sat down and were served tea by\n",
      "Qin-shi.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Xi-feng, ‘what have you asked me here for? Something nice, I hope! If\n",
      "it’s a present, you’d better bring it now; I’m a busy woman!’\n",
      "Before You-shi could think of a suitable retort, one of the women attendants replied\n",
      "for her:\n",
      "‘You ought not to have come, Mrs Lian! Now that you’re here, we’ve got you in our\n",
      "power and you’ll have to do what we say for a change!’\n",
      "At that moment Jia Rong came in and paid his respects to the visitors. Bao-yu asked\n",
      "what had happened to Cousin Zhen.\n",
      "‘He’s gone into the country to see Father,’ said You-shi. Then she added, ‘It’s not\n",
      "much fun for you sitting here. Why don’t you go off and amuse yourself inside?’\n",
      "‘You’ve chosen a good day to come, Uncle Bao,’ said little Qin-shi. ‘Last time you\n",
      "were here you wanted to see my brother. Well, today he’s here. He’s sitting in the\n",
      "study at this very moment. Why don’t you go in and see him?’\n",
      "Bao-yu was for rushing off straight away. You-shi hurriedly ordered some servants to\n",
      "go after him in discreet attendance.\n",
      "‘Well now, just a minute I’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not ask him in here so that I can see\n",
      "him too?’\n",
      "‘Oh dear, I don’t think that would do at all!’ said You-shi. ‘Some people’s children\n",
      "\f",
      "aren’t used to rackety ways like ours. Some people’s children are quiet and refined. If\n",
      "they were to meet a termagant like you, they might die of laughing.’\n",
      "‘He’ll be lucky if I don’t laugh at him,’ said Xi-feng cheer-fully. ‘He’d better not try\n",
      "laughing at me!’\n",
      "‘He’s very, very shy, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong. We are afraid that if you saw him it might\n",
      "only irritate you.’\n",
      "‘Fiddlestick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t care if he’s a three-faced wonder with eight arms,\n",
      "I still want to see him. Stop fatting about and bring him in, or I’ll box your ears!’\n",
      "Jia Rong cringed in mock alarm.\n",
      "‘Yes, Auntie! No need to get so fierce! We’ll bring him in straight away.’\n",
      "They both laughed, and Jia Rong disappeared for a while and presently came back\n",
      "leading a youth who, though some?what thinner than Bao-yu, was mote than his\n",
      "equal in freshness and liveliness of feature, in delicacy of complexion,\n",
      "hand?someness of figure, and grace of deportment, but whose painful bashfulness\n",
      "created a somewhat girlish impression. He approached Xi-feng and made his bow\n",
      "with a shy con?fusion which delighted her.\n",
      "‘You’ve met your match!’ she said to Bao-yu with a laugh, nudging him playfully.\n",
      "Then, leaning forward and gripping the boy’s hand in her own, she drew him down\n",
      "beside her and proceeded in a very deliberate manner to ask him how old he was,\n",
      "what books he was reading, and various other matters -among them his name, which\n",
      "was Qin Zhong.\n",
      "          When the maids and womenfolk in attendance on Xi-feng realized that she\n",
      "was about to meet Qin Zhong and that they had come without the requisite material\n",
      "for a First Meeting present, they had sent some of their number back to consult\n",
      "Patience in the other house. Patience had, at her own dis?cretion, selected a suitable\n",
      "length of material and two little ‘Top of the List’ solid gold medallions to give the\n",
      "mes?sengers. These gifts now arrived for Xi-feng (who thought them somewhat on\n",
      "the meagre side) to give to Qin Zhong. When he and his sister had formally thanked\n",
      "her, the company sat down to lunch, after which You-shi, Xi-feng and Qin?-shi settled\n",
      "down to a game of cards, while Bao-yu and Qin Zhong left the table to converse\n",
      "elsewhere.\n",
      "When Bao-yu first set eyes on Qin Zhong it had been as though part of his soul had\n",
      "left him. For a while he stared blankly, oblivious to all around him, while a stream of\n",
      "idle fancies passed through his mind.\n",
      "‘How perfect he is! Who would have believed there could be such perfection? Now\n",

      "Why, why did I have to be born in this pretentious aristocratic household? Why\n",
      "couldn’t I have been born in the family of some poor scholar or low-grade clerk?\n",
      "\f",
      "Then I could have been neat him and got to know him, and my life would have been\n",
      "worth living. Though I am so much richer and more nobly born than he, what use are\n",
      "my fine clothes but to covet up the dead and rotten wood beneath? What use the\n",
      "luxuries I eat and drink but to fill the cesspit and swell the stinking sewer of my inside?\n",
      "O rank and riches! How you poison everything!’\n",
      "At the same time, Qin Zhong, struck by Bao-yu’s rare good looks and princely bearing\n",
      "and— even more perhaps—by the golden coronet and embroidered clothing and the\n",
      "train of pretty maids and handsome pages who attended him, was thinking:\n",
      "‘No wonder my sister raves about him whenever his name is mentioned! Why did I\n",
      "have to be born in a poor respectable family? How I should have liked to get to know\n",
      "him: to have shared moments of warmth and affection with him! But it was not to\n",
      "be!’\n",
      "Each, plunged in reverie, for a while said nothing. Then Bao-yu asked Qin Zhong\n",
      "about his reading, and Qin Zbong replied—a full, frank reply, without the trappings of\n",
      "polite?ness: and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and\n",
      "were already like old friends.\n",
      "After a while tea and various confections were brought in.\n",
      "‘We two shan’t be drinking any wine,’ Bao-yu said to the ladies. ‘May we have a\n",
      "plate or two of these things set out on the little kang in the other room? We can talk\n",
      "in there without disturbing you,’\n",
      "The two boys moved into the inner room for their tea.\n",
      "          In between plying Xi-feng with wine and delicacies, Qin?shi slipped in for a\n",
      "word with Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘My brother’s quite young, Uncle Bao. Please, for my sake, don’t mind him if he\n",
      "does anything to offend you! He may be shy, but he’s got quite a nasty temper. He’s\n",
      "not really easy to get on with at all.\n",
      "          ‘You go along I’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘We shall be all right!’\n",
      "          After a few admonitory words to her brother, Qin-shi went back to look\n",
      "after Xi-feng.\n",
      "          Some minutes later Xi-feng and You- shi sent a servant in to inquire whether\n",
      "the boys would like anything else to eat, adding that they had only to ask if they\n",
      "wanted anything. Bao-yu promised that they would; but his mind was not on eating\n",
      "and drinking, and he continued to question Qin Zhong about his life at home.\n",
      "‘My private tutor resigned last year,’ Qin Zhong told him. ‘Father is quite old, and as\n",
      "his health is not very good and his job keeps him terribly busy, he hasn’t been able to\n",
      "do any?thing yet about getting me another one. At the moment I am lust going over\n",
      "old lessons on my own at home. The trouble is, though, that if you want to get on in\n",
      "a subject, you really need one or two like-minded people to study with you, so that\n",
      "\f",
      "every so often you can all discuss what you have been reading...’\n",
      "          ‘Exactly!’ Bao-yu put in eagerly, not waiting for him to finish. ‘We have a\n",
      "private school in our family to which any members of the clan who can’t manage\n",
      "private tuition may send their children, and boys from related families who aren’t in\n",
      "the clan can also be admitted. I have been at a loose end ever since my tutor went\n",
      "home on leave, and Father would have liked me to go to this school for revision until\n",
      "he gets back next year and I can be taught privately again. But Grandmother said that\n",
      "with so many boys in the school I should be sure to get up to mischief, and it would\n",
      "do me more harm than good. She also said I couldn’t in any case go then, because I’d\n",
      "only just recovered after several days in bed. And so it got put off.\n",
      "‘From what you say, your father is worried about the same problem as mine; so\n",
      "why not tell him about this school when you get back today and ask him if you can\n",
      "join? I should be there to keep you company, and we could both help each other. I\n",
      "think it would be a marvellous idea.’\n",
      "‘The other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up, Father mentioned\n",
      "this school of yours as a possible alternative,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘He was going to come\n",
      "over and have a word with my sister’s father-in-law about it and get him to\n",
      "recommend me; but they were busy here at the time and it didn’t seem the right\n",
      "moment to bother them with a little thing like this. However, if you are really of the\n",
      "opinion that I could be of some service to you, even if it’s only grinding your ink or\n",
      "cleaning your ink-stone, do please arrange it as soon as you can, before we both get\n",
      "too rusty! We should be relieving our parents of an anxiety and having the pleasure\n",
      "of each other’s company at one and the same time; so it would be a good\n",
      "arrangement from every point of view.’\n",
      "‘Don’t worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll tell Cousin Lian’s wife presently, when we join the\n",
      "others. Then when we get back home tonight, you must tell your father and I shall\n",
      "tell my grandmother. There’s no reason that I can see why this shouldn’t be settled\n",
      "immediately.’\n",
      "They had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk, and now moved back into the\n",
      "lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while. When the latter\n",
      "had finished and had added up their scores, it appeared that Qin-shi and You-shi had\n",
      "lost to Xi-feng and owed her a dramatic enter?tainment at which the players and the\n",
      "drinks were to be provided at their expense. In the course of dinner, which was now\n",
      "served and at which they were joined by the two boys, it was decided that this\n",
      "should take place in two days’ time.\n",
      "As it was now quite dark, You-shi gave her women orders to see that two\n",
      "menservants were detailed to attend Qin Zhong on his way back home. The women\n",
      "were gone on their errand an unusually long time and eventually Qin Zhong rose to\n",
      "\f",
      "take his leave.\n",
      "‘Who has been chosen to go with him?’ You-shi asked.\n",
      "‘They have asked Big Jiao,’ said the women, ‘but it seems that he is terribly drunk\n",
      "and swearing at everybody.’\n",
      "You-shi and Qin-shi were indignant.\n",
      "‘Whatever did they want to go and ask him for? Any of the younger ones would\n",
      "have done. What was the point of provoking him?’\n",
      "‘I always said you were too soft with people,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You really mustn’t let\n",
      "servants get away with it like this. I never heard of such a thing !’\n",
      "‘You don’t know Big Jiao,’ said You-shi. ‘Even Father couldn’t do anything with him,\n",
      "let alone Zhen. When he was young he went with Grandfather on three or four of his\n",
      "campaigns and once saved his life by pulling him from under a heap of corpses and\n",
      "carrying him to safety on his back. He went hungry himself and stole things for his\n",
      "master to eat; and once when he had managed to get half a cupful of water, he gave\n",
      "it to his master and drank horse’s urine himself. Because of these one or two acts of\n",
      "heroism he was always given special treatment during Grandfather’s lifetime; so\n",
      "naturally we don’t like to upset him now. But since he’s grown old he has let himself\n",
      "go completely. He drinks all the time, and when he’s drunk he starts abusing\n",
      "everybody—literally everybody. I’ve repeatedly told the steward not to give him jobs\n",
      "to do—to behave exactly as though he were dead and ignore him completely. Why\n",
      "on earth should he have chosen him today?’\n",
      "     ‘I know this Big Jiao all right,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and I still say that you are too weak.\n",
      "You ought to send him away. Right away. Send him to live on one of your farms: that\n",
      "would put a stop to his nonsense!’ She turned to the women and asked if her own\n",
      "carriage was ready yet. The women replied that it was waiting, and she rose to take\n",
      "her leave and, taking Bao-yu by the hand, went out on to the steps, attended by\n",
      "You-shi and the rest.\n",
      "     In the flickering light of many lanterns the pages stood stiffly to attention on the\n",
      "pavement below, while Big Jiao, encouraged by Cousin Zhen’s absence to indulge his\n",
      "talent for drunken abuse, was getting to work on the Chief Steward, Lai Sheng,\n",
      "accusing him of being unfair, of always dropping on the weakest, and so on and so\n",
      "forth.\n",
      "     ‘If there’s a cushy job going you give it to someone else, but when it’s a question\n",
      "of seeing someone home in pitch bloody darkness, you pick on me. Mean, rotten\n",
      "bugger! Call yourself a steward? Some steward! Don’t you know who Old Jiao is? I\n",
      "can lift my foot up higher than your head! Twenty years ago I didn’t give a damn for\n",
      "anybody, never mind a pack of little misbegotten abortions like you!’\n",
      "     He was just getting into his stride when Jia Rong came out to see Xi-feng off in\n",
      "\f",
      "her carriage. The servants shouted to Big Jiao to stop, but without success. Impatient\n",
      "of the old man’s insolence, Jia Rong cursed him angrily.\n",
      "     ‘Tie him up,’ he said to the servants. ‘We shall see if he is still so eager for death\n",
      "tomorrow morning, when he has sobered up a bit.’\n",
      "     But Big Jiao was not to be intimidated by such as Jia Rong. On the contrary, he\n",
      "staggered up to him and bel?lowed even louder.\n",
      "     ‘Oh ho! Little Rong, is it? Don’t you come the Big Master stuff with me, sonny\n",
      "boy! Never mind a little bit of a kid like you, even your daddy and your granddaddy\n",
      "don’t dare to try any funny stuff with Old Jiao. If it wasn’t for Old Jiao, where would\n",
      "you lot all be today, with your rank and your fancy titles and your money and all the\n",
      "other things you enjoy? It was your great-granddad, whose life I saved when he was\n",
      "given up for dead, that won all this for you, by the sweat of his brow. And what\n",
      "reward do I get for saving him? Nothing. Instead you come to me and you put on\n",
      "your Big Master act. Well, I’ll tell you something. You’d better watch out. Because if\n",
      "you don’t, you’re going to get a shiny white knife inside you, and it’s going to come\n",
      "out red!’\n",
      "     ‘You’d better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business,’\n",
      "said Xi-feng to Jia Rong from her carriage. ‘It’s positively dangerous to keep a man\n",
      "like this on the premises. If any of our acquaintance get to know that a family like\n",
      "ours can’t keep even a semblance of discipline about the place, we shall become a\n",
      "laughing-stock.’\n",
      "Jia Rong assented meekly.\n",
      "     Several of the servants, seeing that Big Jiao had got quite out of hand and that\n",
      "something had to be done at all costs, rushed up and overpowered him, and\n",
      "throwing him face downward on the ground, frog-marched him off to the stables. By\n",
      "now even Cousin Zhen was being included in his mal?edictions, which became wilder\n",
      "and noisier as he shouted to his captors that he wanted to go to the ancestral temple\n",
      "and weep before the tablet of his old Master.\n",
      "    ‘Who would ever have believed the Old Master could spawn this filthy lot of\n",
      "animals?’ he bawled. ‘Up to their dirty little tricks every day. I know. Father-in-law\n",
      "pokes in the ashes. Auntie has it off with nevvy. Do you think I don’t know what\n",
      "you’re all up to? Oh, we “hide our broken arm in our sleeve”; but you don’t fool me.’\n",
      "    Terrified out of their wits at hearing a fellow-servant utter such enormities, the\n",
      "grooms and pages tied him up and stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung.\n",
      "    Big Jiao’s last words had been clearly audible to Xi-feng and Jia Rong, though\n",
      "they were a considerable distance away, but they both pretended not to have heard.\n",
      "Bao-yu, sitting in the carriage with Xi-feng, was less inhibited.\n",
      "    ‘Feng, what did he mean when he said “Father-in-law pokes in the ashes”?’\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘Hold your tongue!’ Xi-feng snapped back at him, livid. ‘It’s bad enough for a\n",
      "person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth, but to go asking\n",
      "questions about it, really! Just wait till I tell your mother! You’re going to get the\n",
      "biggest hiding you’ve ever had in your life!’\n",
      "     Terrified by her vehemence, Bao-yu implored forgiveness. ‘Please, Feng, don’t\n",
      "tell her! I promise never to say those words again.’\n",
      "     Xi-feng’s manner at once became soothing and indulgent.\n",
      "     ‘That’s my good little cuzzy! When we get back I must tell Grandma to make\n",
      "them explain to the school about Qin Zhong and arrange for him to be admitted\n",
      "soon.’\n",
      "     As they talked, the carriage bore them back into Rong-guo House. But what\n",

      "When Bao-yu and Xi-feng were back and had seen the others, Bao-yu told\n",
      "Grandmother Jia of his wish to have Qin Zhong admitted to the clan school. He\n",
      "pointed out that a congenial study-companion would stimulate him to greater effort\n",
      "and gave her a glowing account of Qin Zhong’s amiable qualities. Xi-feng was at hand\n",
      "to lend her support. She told Grandmother Jia that Qin Zhong would be calling on her\n",
      "within a day or two to pay his respects. Their infectious enthusiasm put the old lady\n",
      "in a high good humour, which Xi-feng took ad?vantage of to ask if she would\n",
      "accompany her to the dramatic entertainment which her opponents had promised in\n",
      "two days’ time.\n",
      "     In spite of her years Grandmother Jia loved any kind of excitement and when,\n",
      "two days later, You-shi came to fetch Xi-feng, the old lady did in fact accompany them,\n",
      "taking Lady Wang, Dai-yu and Bao-yu as well. By about noon, however, she was ready\n",
      "to go back and rest, and Lady Wang, who disliked noise and excitement, took the\n",
      "opportunity to leave with her. This left Xi-feng as principal guest, and she moved into\n",
      "the place of honour and stayed there for the rest of the day, enjoying herself\n",
      "immensely and not returning until late in the evening.\n",
      "     After accompanying Grandmother Jia back to her apartment and seeing her\n",
      "safely settled down for her nap, Bao-yu would have liked to go back and watch some\n",
      "more plays but was afraid that his presence would be an inconvenience to Qin?shi\n",
      "and his other ‘juniors’. Remembering that Bao-chai had been at home unwell during\n",
      "the past few days and that he had still not been to see her, he thought he would go\n",
      "there instead and pay her a call, but fearing that if he went the quickest way through\n",
      "the corner gate behind the main hall he might meet with some entanglement on the\n",
      "way or, worse, run into his father, he decided to go by a more circuitous route.\n",
      "The maids and nurses who attended him had been expecting him to change into his\n",

      "followed after him, assuming that he was going back to the other mansion to watch\n",

      "the plays. To their surprise, however, he turned left when he reached the covered\n",
      "passage-way instead of going straight on, and made off in a north-easterly direction.\n",
      "But he was out of luck, for as he did so he found himself facing Zhan Guang and Shan\n",
      "Ping-ren, two of the literary gentlemen patronized by his father, who were walking\n",
      "towards him from the opposite direction. They descended on him gleefully, one of\n",
      "them clasping him round the waist, the other taking him by a hand.\n",
      "‘Angelic boy! How seldom one has the pleasure! Is it really you, or is this some\n",
      "delightful dream?’\n",
      "They prattled on for what seemed an age before finally releasing him. As they were\n",
      "going, one of the old nurses detained them a moment longer.\n",
      "‘Have you two gentlemen just come from the Master’s?’\n",
      "The two gentlemen nodded and smiled conspiratorially:\n",
      "‘Sir Zheng is in his little study in the Su Dong-po Rooms, having his afternoon nap.\n",
      "All is well!’\n",
      "They hurried off. Bao-yu smiled too, relieved that his father was safely out of the way.\n",
      "Turning once again, this time north-wards, he made his way swiftly towards Pear Tree\n",
      "Court.\n",
      "Once more he was unlucky. The Clerk of Stores Wu Xindeng, a man called Dai Liang\n",
      "who was foreman at the granary, and five other foremen were just at that moment\n",
      "coming out of the counting-house together and, catching sight of Bao-yu, at once\n",
      "stood respectfully to attention. One of their number, a buyer called Qian Hua who\n",
      "had not seen Bao-yu for some considerable time, hurried forward, dropped on his\n",
      "right knee, and touched his hand to the ground in the Manchu salute. Bao-yu\n",
      "smilingly extended a hand to raise him up. The men all relaxed in smiles.\n",
      "‘I saw some of your calligraphy in town the other day, Master Bao,’ said one of\n",
      "them. ‘It’s getting really good! When are you going to give us a few sheets for\n",
      "ourselves, to put up on the wall?’\n",
      "‘Where did you see it?’ Bao-yu asked.\n",
      "‘Any number of places,’ the men told him. ‘Everyone has been praising it no end.\n",
      "They even come to us asking for specimens.’\n",
      "‘You can have some easily enough if you really want to,’ Bao-yu said. ‘You have only\n",
      "to ask one of my boys.’\n",
      "He hurried on. The men waited for him to pass before dispersing about their\n",
      "business.\n",
      "To omit further details of his progress, Bao-yu came at last to Pear Tree Court, and\n",
      "going first into Aunt Xue’s room, found her giving instructions to her maids about\n",
      "some em?broidery. Her response to his greeting was to draw him towards her and\n",

      "\f",
      "‘What a nice, kind boy to think of us on a cold day like this! Come up on the kang\n",
      "and get warm!’\n",
      "She ordered a maid to bring him some ‘boiling hot tea’.\n",

      "‘What about Bao-chai? Is she quite better?’\n",
      "‘Ah yes, of course!’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You sent someone to ask about her the other\n",
      "day, didn’t you? That was very thoughtful of you. I think she’s inside. Go in and have\n",
      "a look! It’s warmer in there than here. You go in and sit down, and I’ll be with you in\n",
      "a moment when I’ve finished tidying up.’\n",
      "Bao-yu got down from the kang and going to the doorway of the inner room, lifted\n",
      "up the rather worn-looking red silk curtain which covered it. Bao-chai was sitting on\n",
      "the kang inside, sewing. Her lustrous black hair was done up in a simple bun without\n",
      "any kind of ornament. She was wearing a honey-coloured padded gown, a\n",
      "mulberry-coloured sleeveless jacket with a pattern in gold and silver thread, and a\n",
      "greenish-yellow padded skirt. All her clothing had the same sensible, rather\n",

      "‘I am quite better now. It was nice of you to think of me.’ She made him sit on the\n",
      "edge of the kang and ordered Oriole to pour him some tea. Then she proceeded to\n",
      "ask him first about Grandmother Jia, then about Lady Wang and then about the girls,\n",
      "while her eye took in the details of his dress.\n",
      "He had a little jewel-encrusted coronet of gold filigree on the top of his head and a\n",
      "circlet in the form of two dragons supporting a pearl round his brow. He was dressed\n",
      "in a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of russet-green material covered with a pattern\n",
      "of writhing dragons and lined and trimmed with white fox-fur. A\n",
      "butterfly-embroidered sash with fringed ends was fastened round his waist, and from\n",

      "‘What do I mean by that ?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I mean that if I only come when he does,\n",

      "out so that he comes one day and I come the next, it will never get either too lonely\n",

      "By now Aunt Xue had finished laying tea, which included a number of\n",

      "doing so, Bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by\n",
      "his Cousin Zhen’s wife that he had eaten at the Ning mansion only two days\n",
      "previously. Aunt Xue at once hurried out and fetched some of her own for him to try.\n",

      "grandmother or your mother is there. But look at the trouble I got into the other day\n",
      "just because when I had my back turned for a moment some wretched person who\n",

      "‘You don’t know how wild he can be, Mrs Xue,’ she continued. ‘And he gets even\n",
      "worse when he’s had something to drink. With Her Old Ladyship you can never tell.\n",
      "One day when she’s feeling high-spirited she’ll let him drink as much as he likes;\n",
      "other days she won’t let him touch a drop. But come what may, I’m always the one\n",
      "that gets into trouble.’\n",
      "‘Poor old thing!’ said Aunt Xue with a laugh. ‘Have a drink yourself and stop\n",
      "worrying! I’ll see that he doesn’t drink too much. And if Lady Jia does say anything, I\n",
      "shall take full responsibility? She turned to one of the maids: ‘Come on’ now! Pour\n",
      "Nannie a nice warm cup of wine to keep the cold out!’\n",
      "Nannie Li could scarcely sustain her objection after this and went off with the other\n",
      "servants to have her drink.\n",
      "‘Don’t bother to heat the wine for me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I prefer it cold.\n",
      "‘Good gracious, that will never do! ‘said Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t drink wine cold, or\n",
      "when you write your hand will shake!’\n",
      "‘I’m surprised at you, Cousin Bao!’ said Bao-chai with a smile. ‘With all your\n",
      "enthusiasm for out-of-the-way learning, fancy not knowing a thing like that! Wine\n",
      "has an exceptionally fiery nature, and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be\n",
      "quickly digested. If it is drunk cold, it congeals inside the body and harms it by\n",
      "absorbing heat from the internal organs. From this day on you must reform! No more\n",
      "cold wine!’\n",
      "Dai-yu, who sat cracking melon-seeds between her teeth throughout this homily,\n",
      "smiled ironically. Just at that moment her maid Snowgoose came hurrying in with a\n",
      "little hand-warmer for her.\n",
      "‘Who told you to bring this?’ Dai-yu asked her. ‘Very kind of them, I am sure. But I\n",
      "was not actually freezing to death here.’\n",
      "‘Nightingale told me to bring it, Miss. She was afraid you might be cold.’\n",
      "‘I am glad you are so ready to obey her. Generally when 1 tell you to do anything it\n",
      "goes in one ear and out the other; yet anything she tells you to do is followed out\n",
      "\f",
      "more promptly than an Imperial Edict!’\n",
      "Bao-yu knew perfectly well that these words were really intended for him, but made\n",
      "no reply, beyond laughing good-?humouredly. Bao-chai, long accustomed to Dai-yu’s\n",
      "peculiar ways, also ignored them. But Aunt Xue protested.\n",
      "‘You’ve always been rather delicate and you’ve always felt the cold badly. Surely it\n",
      "was nice of them to think of you?’\n",
      "‘You don’t understand, Aunt,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t matter here, with you; but\n",
      "some people might be deeply offended at the sight of one of my maids rushing in\n",
      "with a hand-warmer. It’s as though I thought my hosts couldn’t supply one\n",
      "themselves if I needed it. Instead of saying how thoughtful the maid was, they would\n",
      "put it down to my arrogance and lack of breeding.’\n",
      "‘You are altogether too sensitive, thinking of things like that,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Such a\n",
      "thought would never have crossed my mind!’\n",
      "Bao-yu had soon finished his third cup of wine and Nannie Li once more came\n",
      "forward to restrain him. But Bao-yu, who was now warm and happy and in the midst\n",
      "of a hilarious conversation with his cousins, was naturally unwilling to stop, and\n",
      "pleaded humbly with the old lady for a reprieve.\n",
      "‘Nannie darling, just two more cups and then I’ll stop!’\n",
      "‘You’d better look out,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Your father’s at home today. He’ll be asking\n",
      "you about your lessons before you know where you are.’\n",
      "At these words all Bao-yu’s happiness drained away. Slowly he set down his cup and\n",
      "bowed his head in dejection.\n",
      "‘Don’t spoil everyone’s enjoyment,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Even if Uncle does call for you, you\n",
      "can always say that Aunt Xue is keeping you. I think that old Nannie of yours has had\n",
      "a cup too many and is looking for a bit of excitement at our expense. She gave him a\n",
      "gentle nudge to encourage a more valiant spirit in him, muttering, as she did so,\n",
      "‘Take no notice of the old fool! Let’s go on enjoying ourselves and not mind about\n",
      "her!’\n",
      "Nannie Li knew only too well what Dai-yu was capable of.\n",
      "‘Now Miss Lin,’ she said, ‘don’t you go taking his part! If you encourage him he’s\n",
      "only too likely to do what you say!’\n",
      "Dai-yu smiled dangerously. ‘Take his part? Why should I want to encourage him? You\n",
      "are over-cautious, my dear Nannie. After all, Lady Jia often lets him drink; why should\n",
      "it matter if Mrs Xue lets him have a cup or two? I suppose you think he can’t be\n",
      "trusted to drink here because Mrs Xue is not one of us?’\n",
      "Nannie Li did not know whether to feel upset or amused. ‘Really, Miss Lin. Some of\n",
      "the things you say cut sharper than a knife!’\n",
      "Bao-chai could not suppress a giggle. She pinched Dai-yu’s cheek playfully.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Really, Miss Frowner, the things you say! One doesn’t know whether to grind one’s\n",
      "teeth or laugh!’\n",
      "Aunt Xue laughed too.\n",
      "‘Don’t be afraid, my boy! Heaven knows I’ve got little enough to offer you when\n",
      "you come to see me. You mustn’t get upset over a small thing like this, or I shall feel\n",
      "quite uncomfortable. Drink as much as you like; I’ll look after you! You may as well\n",
      "stay to supper, in any case; and even if you do get drunk, you can always spend the\n",
      "night here.’ She told a maid to heat some more wine. ‘There! Auntie will drink a cup\n",
      "or two with you, and then we shall have some supper.’\n",
      "Bao-yu’s spirits began to revive a bit under his aunt’s encouragement.\n",
      "‘Keep an eye on him,’ said Nannie Li to the maids. ‘I’m lust going back for a few\n",
      "minutes to change my clothes.’ Then aside to Aunt Xue she said, ‘Don’t let him drink\n",
      "too much, Mrs Xue!’ and went off home.\n",
      "Although two or three old women still remained after her departure, none felt very\n",
      "much concern for Bao-yu, and as soon as Nannie Li was out of the way they quietiy\n",
      "slipped off about their own concerns, leaving, of the attendants who had come with\n",
      "him, only two small maids, whose only anxiety was to please their young master by\n",
      "indulging him as much as possible.\n",
      "Fortunately Aunt Xue, by exercising great tact and finesse, managed to spirit the wine\n",
      "away when Bao-yu had drunk only a few more cups, and to replace it with a hot, sour\n",
      "soup of pickled bamboo-shoots and chicken-skin. He drank several bowls of this with\n",
      "great relish and then ate half a bowl of green-rice gruel. After that, when Bao-chai\n",
      "and Dai-yu had finished eating, he drank several cups of very strong tea. At this point\n",
      "Aunt Xue felt sure that he would be all right.\n",
      "As Snowgoose and the other maids had now finished supper too and were once\n",
      "more in attendance, Dai-yu asked Bao-yu if he was ready to go. He looked at her\n",
      "blearily through tired eyes.\n",
      "‘If you want to go, I will go with you.’\n",
      "Dai-yu rose to her feet. ‘We really ought to go. We’ve been here practically all day!’\n",
      "The two of them began saying their good-byes.\n",
      "A maid came forward with Bao-yu’s rain-hat and he lowered his head slightly for her\n",
      "to put it on. Holding the brim of the great saucer-shaped red felt top, she jerked it up\n",
      "and prepared to bring it down, aiming the inside part at his crown.\n",
      "‘Stop!’ he cried impatiently.’ You have got to go easy with a great clumsy thing like\n",
      "that! Haven’t you ever seen anyone putting one of these things on before? You had\n",
      "better let me do it myself.’\n",
      "‘Come here!’ said Dai-yu standing on the edge of the kang. ‘I’ll put it on for you!’\n",
      "Bao-yu went and stood in front of her. Putting her two hands round the inner cap,\n",
      "\f",
      "Dai-yu eased it gently down until its rim fitted over his golden headband, so that the\n",
      "walnut-sized red woollen pompom of the headband was left quiver?ing outside the\n",
      "cap on its flexible golden stem.\n",
      "‘There!’ she said, after a few further adjustments. ‘Now you can put on your cape.’\n",
      "Bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself.\n",
      "‘The nurses who came with you are still not back,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Perhaps you had\n",
      "better wait a bit.’\n",
      "‘We wait for them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have got the maids. We shall be all right.’\n",
      "But Aunt Xue was not satisfied, and ordered two of her own women to see the\n",
      "cousins home.\n",
      "As soon as they were back they thanked the women for their trouble and went\n",
      "straight in to see Grandmother Jia, who had not yet had her supper. She was\n",
      "delighted to learn that they had been with Aunt Xue, and observing that Bao-yu, had\n",
      "had more than a little to drink, she told him to go and rest in his room and not come\n",
      "out again, and instructed the servants to keep a careful watch over him.\n",
      "Remembering which servants usually attended him, she asked what had become of\n",
      "Nannie Li. The maids dared not tell her the truth, which was that she had gone\n",
      "home.\n",
      "‘I think she must have had something to do,’ said one of them. ‘She came in when\n",
      "we did just now, but went out again almost immediately.’\n",
      "‘Why worry about her ?’ said Bao-yu over his shoulder, swaying slightly as he made\n",
      "his way to the bedroom. ‘She’s better looked after than you are! If it weren’t for her I\n",
      "might live a few days longer!’\n",
      "Inside his room he found a writing-brush and ink laid out on the desk. Skybright was\n",
      "the first to greet him.\n",
      "‘You’re a nice one!’ she said. ‘You made me mix all this ink for you this morning, sat\n",
      "down in a state of great en?thusiasm, wrote just three characters, threw down the\n",
      "brush again, rushed out, and left me waiting here all day for you to come back and\n",
      "finish. Now you just sit down here and use this ink up, and perhaps I’ll let the matter\n",
      "pass!’\n",
      "Skybright’s words awoke in Bao-yu a recollection of the morning’s events.\n",
      "‘What became of the three characters I wrote?’\n",
      "Skybright laughed. ‘You’re really drunk, aren’t you! This morning before you went to\n",
      "the other house you gave careful instructions that they were to be pasted up over\n",
      "the outside door. I was afraid that someone else might make a mess of it, so I got up\n",
      "on a ladder and spent half the morning sticking them up myself. My hands are still\n",
      "numb from doing it.’\n",
      "‘I’d forgotten.’ Bao-yu smiled. ‘If your hands are cold, I’ll warm them for you.’ He\n",
      "\f",
      "took both her hands in his own and led her outside to inspect the sheet of calligraphy\n",
      "newly pasted up over the doorway. Just then Dai-yu arrived.\n",
      "‘I want you to tell me honestly, cousin,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Which of these three\n",
      "characters do you think is the best?’\n",
      "Dai-yu looked up at the three characters above the door:\n",
      "\n",
      "RED RUE STUDY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They are all equally good. I didn’t know you could write so beautifully. You must do\n",
      "one for me some time!’\n",
      "‘You’re just saying that to humour me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Where is Aroma?’ he asked\n",
      "Skybright.\n",
      "Skybright shot out her lips and indicated the kang inside, on which Aroma, fully\n",
      "clothed, was lying fast asleep.\n",
      "‘Just look at that!’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘It’s a bit early for sleep, isn’t it?’\n",
      "He turned once more to Skybright. ‘When I was having lunch at the other house\n",
      "today there was a plate of bean-curd dumplings. I remembered how fond you are of\n",
      "those things and asked Mrs Zhen if I could have some to eat in the evening. She had\n",
      "them sent over for me. Did you get them all right?’\n",
      "‘Don’t talk to me about those dumplings!’ said Skybright.\n",
      "‘As soon as they arrived I realized that they must be for me, but as I’d only just\n",
      "finished eating, I put them on one side meaning to eat them later. Then after a while\n",
      "Nannie Li came in and caught sight of them. \"I don’t expect Bao-yu will want these,\"\n",
      "she said. “I think I’ll take them for my grand children\"; and she had them sent round\n",
      "to her house.’\n",
      "While Skybright was talking, Snowpink came in carrying some tea on a tray. Bao-yu\n",
      "invited Dai-yu to have some, to the great merriment of the maids, who pointed out\n",
      "that she had slipped away some minutes before.\n",
      "After drinking about half a cupful, Bao-yu suddenly thought of the tea he had drunk\n",
      "early that morning.\n",
      "‘When you made that Fung Loo this morning,’ he said to Snowpink, ‘I remember\n",
      "telling you that with that particular brand the full flavour doesn’t come out until after\n",
      "three or four waterings. Why have you given me this other stuff? This would have\n",
      "been just the time to have the Fung Loo.’\n",
      "‘I was keeping it for you,’ said Snowpink, ‘but Nannie Li came and drank it all.’\n",
      "With a flick of the wrist Bao-yu hurled the cup he was holding on to the floor, where\n",
      "it smashed noisily, breaking into innumerable pieces and showering Snowpink’s skirt\n",
      "with hot tea. He jumped angrily to his feet.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Is she your mistress that you should all treat her with such reverence? Merely\n",
      "because I drank her milk for a few days when I was a baby she is as spoiled and\n",
      "pampered as though she were some sort of divinity. Let’s get rid of the old woman\n",
      "now and have done with it!’\n",
      "And he strode off without more ado to tell Grandmother Jia that he wanted his old\n",
      "nurse dismissed.\n",
      "All this time Aroma had been only pretending to sleep, hoping by this means to\n",
      "engage Bao-yu’s attention and provoke some coquetry between them. As long as the\n",
      "talk dwelt on calligraphy and Skybright’s dumplings there seemed no pressing need\n",
      "for her to get up; but when she heard him break a teacup and grow really angry she\n",
      "hurriedly rose to her feet and intervened to restrain him.\n",
      "By this time someone had arrived from Grandmother Jia’s room to inquire what all\n",
      "the noise was about. Aroma pre?tended that she had smashed the cup herself by\n",
      "slipping on some snow while fetching tea. Having disposed of the inquirer, she then\n",
      "proceeded to exhort Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Dismiss her by all means, if you really want to! But we could all like to leave with\n",
      "her; so while you are about it, why not make a clean sweep and dismiss the lot of us?\n",
      "I am sure you will find plenty of other good servants to replace us with.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had nothing to say to this, and Aroma and the rest helped him onto the kang\n",
      "and started undressing him. He kept trying to tell them something as they did so, but\n",
      "an object seemed to impede his tongue and his eyelids were growing increasingly hot\n",

      "disadvantages in coming forward as his cham?pion.\n",
      "‘Jokey Jin, Jia Rui, and that lot are all friends of Uncle Xue,’ he thought. ‘For that\n",

      "few inflammatory words in his ear.\n",
      "Tealeaf was the most willing but also the youngest and least sensible of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "pages. Jia Qiang told him how Jokey Jin had been bullying Qin Zhong. ‘And even\n",
      "Bao-yu came in for a share,’ he said. ‘If we don’t take this Jin fellow down a peg, next\n",

      "At this point Jia Qiang began to scrape his boots on the floor and make a great\n",

      "muttering to himself as he did so, ‘Ah, yes. Hmn. Must be about time.’ Going up to Jia\n",
      "Rui, he informed him that he had an engagement which necessitated his leaving early,\n",
      "and Jia Rui not having the courage to stop him, allowed him to slip away.\n",
      "Tealeaf had by now singled out Jokey Jin and grabbed him by the front of his jacket.\n",
      "‘Whether we fuck arseholes or not,’ he said, ‘what fucking business is it of yours?\n",
      "You should be bloody grateful we haven’t fucked your dad. Come outside and fight it\n",

      "Jia Lan and Jia Jun belonged to the Rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same\n",
      "generation as the other Jia Lan, the little son of Li Wan and nephew of Bao-yu. Jia Jun\n",
      "had lost his father in infancy and was doted on by his widowed mother. Jia Lan was\n",
      "his best friend, which is why they always sat next to each other in school. Though Jia\n",
      "Jun was among the youngest in the class, his tiny body contained an heroic soul. He\n",
      "was extremely mischievous and completely fearless. With the impartial interest of an\n",
      "observer he had watched a friend of Jokey Jin’s slyly aim the inkstone at Tealeaf; but\n",
      "\f",
      "when it fell short and landed right in front of him on his own desk, smashing a\n",
      "porcelain water-bottle and showering his books with inky water, his blood was up.\n",
      "‘Rotten swine!’ he shouted. ‘If this is a free-for-all, here goes!’ and he grabbed at\n",
      "the inkstone intending to send it sailing back. But Jia Lan was a man of peace and\n",
      "held it firmly down.\n",
      "‘Leave it, old chap! It’s none of our business,’ he coun?selled.\n",
      "Jia Jun was not to be restrained, however. Deprived of the inkstone, he picked up a\n",
      "satchel full of books and raising it in both hands above his head, hurled it in the\n",
      "direction of the assailant. Unfortunately his body was too small and his strength too\n",
      "puny for so great a trajectory, and the satchel fell on the desk occupied by Bao-yu\n",
      "and Qin Zhong. It landed with a tremendous crash, scattering books, papers,\n",
      "writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing Bao-yu’s teabowl to\n",
      "smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about. Nothing daunted, Jia\n",
      "Jun leaped out and rushed upon the thrower of inkstones to smite him.\n",
      "Meanwhile Jokey Jin had found a bamboo pole which he flailed around him: a\n",
      "terrible weapon in so confined and crowded a space. Soon Tealeaf had sustained a\n",
      "blow from it and was bawling for reinforcements from outside. There were three\n",
      "other pages in attendance on Bao-yu besides himself, all equally inclined to mischief.\n",
      "Their names were Sweeper, Ploughboy and Inky. With a great shout of ‘To arms! To\n",
      "arms! Down with the bastards!’ these three now came rushing like angry hornets\n",
      "into the classroom, Inky wielding a door-bar which he had picked up and Sweeper\n",
      "and Ploughboy brandishing horsewhips.\n",
      "Jia Rui, in a frenzy of outraged authority, hopped from one to the other, alternately\n",
      "grabbing and cajoling, but none would take the slightest bit of notice. Disorder was\n",
      "now general. The more mischievous of the scholars mingled glee-fully in the fray, safe,\n",
      "in the general scrimmage, to land punches at chosen foes without fear of discovery\n",
      "or reprisal. The more timid crawled into places of safety. Others stood on their desks,\n",
      "laughing and clapping their hands and cheering on the combatants. The classroom\n",
      "was like a cauldron of still water that had suddenly come to the boil.\n",
      "Li Gui and the other older servants, hearing the uproar from outside, now hurried in,\n",
      "and by concerted shouting eventually managed to call the boys to a halt. Li Gui asked\n",
      "them what they were fighting about. He was answered by a medley of voices, some\n",
      "saying one thing and some another. Unable to make sense of what he heard, he\n",
      "turned his attention to Tealeaf and the other pages, cursing them roundly and\n",
      "turning them out of the room.\n",

      "Great-uncle Dai-ru about this. We were shamefully insulted, and because we didn’t\n",
      "want to start a quarrel, we went along in a perfectly polite and reasonable manner\n",
      "and reported the matter to Cousin Rui. But instead of doing anything about it, he\n",
      "gave us a telling-off, stood by while someone called us filthy names, and actually\n",
      "encouraged them to start hitting us. Naturally Tealeaf stuck up for us when he saw\n",
      "we were being bullied. What would you expect him to do? But they all ganged up on\n",
      "him and started hitting him, and even Qin Zhong’s head was cut open. We can’t go\n",

      "is by dealing with it here, where it started. Not by rushing off and upsetting your poor\n",

      "away you are the head of the whole school and everyone looks to you to set an\n",
      "example. If anyone does anything they shouldn’t, it’s up to you to deal with it—give\n",

      "to this extent.’\n",
      "‘I did tell them to stop,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but they wouldn’t listen.’\n",
      "‘If you don’t mind my saying so,’ said Li Gui, ‘it’s because you’ve been to blame\n",

      "on into the room beyond.\n",
      "The original object of Mrs Huang’s visit had of course been to complain to Qin-shi\n",
      "about Qin Zhong’s treatment of her nephew. Hearing of Qin-shi’s illness she had\n",
      "abandoned all thought of even mentioning the subject; and now that Cousin Zhen\n",

      "When she had gone, Cousin Zhen came in again and sat down.\n",
      "‘What did she come about today?’ he asked You-shi.\n",
      "‘Oh,’ said You-shi, ‘nothing in particular. When she first came in she appeared to be\n",
      "upset about something or other, then after we’d been talking for some time and I\n",
      "mentioned that Rong’s wife was ill, she gradually calmed down. When you invited her\n",
      "\f",
      "to dinner she knew she couldn’t very well stay on with sickness in the house and left\n",
      "after chatting a few minutes longer. She didn’t ask for anything before she went.\n",
      "     ‘But let’s talk about that child’s illness. The thing is, you really must find a good\n",

      "present are com?pletely useless! Each one of them just listens to what you say and\n",
      "then gives it back to you with a few learned words thrown in. And they’re so terribly\n",
      "conscientious about it! We have three or four of them coming by turns every day,\n",
      "and some?times they’ll take her pulse four or five times in the same day. Then they\n",
      "have long discussions while they decide on a prescription. None of the medicine does\n",
      "her any good, and the only consequence of all this is that she is having to change her\n",
      "clothes four or five times in a day and be constantly getting up and sitting down to\n",
      "see these doctors, which is no good at all for a person in her condition.’\n",
      "     ‘Oh, she’s a silly child!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘There’s no need for all this dressing\n",
      "and undressing. Suppose she caught a chill on top of this other illness, that would be\n",
      "really frightful. Never mind about the clothes, for goodness’ sake, however good they\n",
      "are! It’s the child’s health that matters. Who cares if she has to have a completely\n",
      "new outfit every day? We can afford it.\n",
      "‘What I was going to tell you is that I’ve just had a visit from Feng Zi-ying. He\n",
      "noticed that something was bothering me, and when he asked me what it was I\n",
      "explained that our daughter-in-law isn’t well and told him how worried we are\n",
      "because we haven’t got a decent doctor who can tell us for sure whether it’s\n",
      "pregnancy or disease, so that we don’t even know how serious it is. Then Feng\n",
      "Zi-ying told me about a scholar friend of his called Zhang You-shi. He and Feng were\n",
      "at school together. He is a man of very wide learning including, apparently, an\n",
      "excellent knowledge of medicine and the ability to tell with certainty whether a\n",
      "disease is curable or not. He’s up at the capital this year to purchase a place for his\n",
      "son and is at present staying in Feng Zi-ying’s house. It looks as if in his hands she\n",
      "might stand a good chance of getting better. Anyway, I’ve already sent someone\n",
      "round with my card and and asked him to call. It’s getting a bit late for him to come\n",
      "today, but he should definitely be round tomorrow. Feng Zi-ying promised to see him\n",
      "when he got back and put in a word for me to make quite sure that he agrees to\n",
      "come. So we’ll just have to wait and see what this Dr Zhang says.’\n",

      "was there of asking him if he would come over on his birthday to receive everyone’s\n",

      "monastery and I’m not willing to go back into your quarrelsome world again. If you\n",
      "insist on celebrating my birthday it would be a hundred times better to have my tract\n",
      "on Divine Rewards written out by a good calligrapher and cut on blocks for printing\n",
      "than to drag me back to your house for a lot of senseless head-knocking.” He said, “If\n",

      "party yourself. But don’t go sending me any presents,” he said, “and don’t come\n",

      "with. But if you come round here the day after tomorrow with a lot of other people\n",
      "to pester me, I shall refuse to see you.” Well, after that I obviously can’t go again on\n",

      "encountering, as he did so, the youth who had been sent to Feng Zi-ying’s house to\n",
      "request a call from the doctor. He had just got back from delivering his message and\n",
      "reported to Jia Rong as follows:\n",
      "‘I took the Master’s card to the doctor at Mr Feng’s house and asked him to call. He\n",
      "said Mr Feng had already spoken to him about it, but he had been out visiting all day\n",
      "and only just got back and he simply didn’t have the energy to go out any more today.\n",
      "He said, “Even if I were to go round to your house now I shouldn’t be able to take the\n",
      "young lady’s pulse. It would take me all night to get my breathing regulated.\n",
      "However,” he said, “I shall definitely call round tomorrow.” And he said, “My\n",
      "knowledge of medicine is really too slight for a consultation of this importance, but\n",
      "as your master and Mr Feng are so pressing, I obviously cannot refuse. But I hope you\n",
      "will explain this to your master.” And he said, “As for your master’s card, that is an\n",
      "honour I really cannot accept”; and he made me bring it back. Will you please pass\n",
      "on this message for me, Master Rong?’\n",
      "Jia Rong turned and went back into the room to tell his parents. Going out once more,\n",
      "he summoned Lai Sheng and gave instructions for preparing a two-day birthday party,\n",
      "which Lai Sheng duly proceeded to put into operation. But of that no more.\n",
      "\f",
      "About noon next day one of the servants at the gate came in to report:\n",
      "‘The Dr Zhang you sent for has arrived, sir’.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen went out to receive the doctor and con?ducted him into the main\n",
      "reception room, where they both sat down. He waited until the doctor had taken tea\n",
      "before broaching the subject of his visit.\n",
      "‘Yesterday Mr Feng was telling me about your great learning,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I\n",
      "gather that it includes a pro?found knowledge of medicine. I assure you I was very\n",
      "much impressed.’\n",
      "‘I am only a very indifferent scholar,’ replied Dr Zhang, ‘and my knowledge is really\n",
      "extremely superficial. However, Mr Feng was telling me yesterday of the courteous\n",
      "and con?siderate patronage of scholars which is traditional in your family, so when I\n",
      "received your summons I felt unable to refuse. I must insist, though, that I am\n",
      "entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all\n",
      "too soon become apparent.’\n",
      "‘My dear sir, you are altogether too modest,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Do you think I\n",
      "could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-in-law? We are relying on\n",
      "your superior knowledge to put us out of our uncertainty.’\n",
      "He left the doctor in the charge of Jia Rong, who conducted him through the inner\n",
      "part of the house to his own apartment, where Qin-shi was.\n",
      "‘Is this the lady?’ asked the doctor.\n",
      "‘Yes, this is my wife,’ Jia Rong replied. ‘Do sit down! I ex?pect you would like me to\n",
      "describe her symptoms first, before you take the pulse?’\n",
      "‘If you will permit me, no,’ said the doctor. ‘I think it would be better if I took the\n",
      "pulse first and asked you about the development of the illness afterwards. This is the\n",
      "first time .I have been to your house, and as I am not a skilled practitioner and have\n",
      "only come here at our friend Mr Feng’s insistence, I think I should take the pulse and\n",
      "give you my diagnosis first. We can go on to talk about her symptoms and discuss a\n",
      "course of treatment if you are satisfied with the diagnosis. And of course, it will still\n",
      "be up to you to decide whether or not the treatment I prescribe is to be followed.’\n",
      "‘You speak with real authority, doctor,’ said Jia Rong. ‘I only wish we had got to hear\n",
      "of you earlier. Take her pulse now, then, and let us know whether what she has can\n",
      "be cured, so that my parents may be spared further anxiety.’\n",
      "At this point Qin-shi’s women carried in a large arm-rest of the kind used in\n",
      "consultations, propped her forward with her arms across it, and drew back her\n",
      "sleeves, exposing both arms at the wrist. The doctor stretched out his hand and laid\n",
      "it on her right wrist, then, having first regulated his own breathing in order to be able\n",
      "to count the rate, he felt the pulses with great concentration for the space of several\n",
      "minutes, after which he transferred to the left wrist and spent an equal amount of\n",
      "\f",
      "time on that. This done, he proposed that they should withdraw to the outside room\n",
      "to talk.\n",
      "Jia Rong accompanied him outside and sat with him on the kang. An old woman\n",
      "served tea, which Jia Rong invited the doctor to take, waiting until he had done so\n",
      "before asking him for his diagnosis.\n",
      "‘Tell me, doctor, from your reading of my wife’s pulse, do you think she can be\n",
      "cured?’\n",
      "‘Well, the lower left distal pulse is rapid and the lower left median pulse is strong\n",
      "and full,’ said the doctor. ‘On the right side, the distal pulse is thin and lacks strength\n",
      "and the median pulse is faint and lacks vitality.\n",
      "‘Now, a rapid lower left-hand distal pulse means that a malfunction of the\n",
      "controlling humour of the heart is causing it to generate too much fire; and the\n",
      "strong lower median pulse means that the liver’s humour is blocked, giving rise to a\n",
      "deficiency of blood. A thin, weak distal pulse on the right side indicates a gross\n",
      "deficiency of humour in the lungs; and a faint right median pulse lacking in vitality\n",
      "shows that the earth of the spleen is being subdued by the woody element of the\n",
      "liver.\n",
      "‘If the heart is generating fire, the symptoms should be ir?regularity of the menses\n",
      "and insomnia. A deficiency of blood and blockage of humour in the liver would result\n",
      "in pain and congestion under the ribs, delay of the menses beyond their term, and\n",
      "burning sensations in the heart. A deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise\n",
      "to sudden attacks of giddiness, sweating at five or six in the morning, and a sinking\n",
      "feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat. And if the earth of the spleen\n",
      "is being subdued by the wood of the liver, she would undoubtedly experience loss of\n",
      "appetite, lassitude, and general enfeeblement of the whole body. If my reading of the\n",
      "lady’s pulse is correct, she ought to be showing all these symptoms. Some people\n",
      "would tell you they indicated a pregnancy, but I am afraid I should have to disagree.’\n",
      "‘You must have second sight, doctor!’ said one of the old women, a body-servant of\n",
      "Qin-shi’s who was standing by. ‘What you have said exactly describes how it is with\n",
      "her; there is no need for us to tell you anything more. Of all the doctors we’ve lately\n",
      "had around here to look at her none has ever spoken as much to the point as this.\n",
      "Some have said she’s expecting; others have said it’s illness; one says it’s not serious;\n",
      "another only gives her till the winter solstice; not one of them tells you anything you\n",
      "can really rely on. Please doctor, you tell us: just how serious is this illness ?’\n",
      "‘I am afraid my colleagues have allowed your mistress’s condition to deteriorate,’\n",
      "said the doctor. ‘If she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning, when\n",
      "she first started her courses, there is every reason to suppose that she would by now\n",
      "be completely cured. But the illness has been neglected for so long now, this\n",
      "\f",
      "breakdown was almost bound to happen. I would say that with proper treatment she\n",
      "has about a one in three chance of recovery. We shall just have to see how she\n",
      "responds to my medicine. If, after taking it, she can get a good night’s sleep, her\n",
      "chances will be distinctly better: say fifty?-fifty.\n",
      "‘From my reading of her pulse, I should expect your mistress to be a very highly\n",
      "strung, sensitive young woman. Sometimes, when people are over-sensitive, they\n",
      "find a good deal that is upsetting in what goes on around them; and of course, if\n",
      "things are upsetting them, they will tend to worry a lot. This illness has been caused\n",
      "by too much worry affecting the spleen and causing an excess of wood in the liver,\n",
      "with the result that the menstrual blood has been prevented from flowing at the\n",
      "proper times. If we were to ask your mistress about the dates of her courses, I am\n",
      "sure we should find that they tended to be on the late side, isn’t that so?’\n",
      "‘Absolutely right,’ the old woman replied. ‘Her periods have never been early.\n",
      "Sometimes two or three days late, sometimes as much as ten days: but in any case,\n",
      "always late.’\n",
      "‘You see!’ said the doctor. ‘There is the cause of the trouble. If she could have been\n",
      "treated in time with something to fortify the heart and stabilize the humours, she\n",
      "would never have got into this present state. What we have now, I am afraid, is an\n",
      "advanced case of dehydration. Well, we shall have to see what my medicine can do\n",
      "for her.’\n",
      "He wrote out the following prescription and handed it to Jia Rong:\n",

      "always been so close and she didn’t want to miss you that she made the effort.’\n",
      "Xi-feng’s eyes became moist and for a moment she was too overcome to speak.\n",
      "‘I know “the weather and human life are both unpredic?table”,’ she said at last,\n",
      "‘but she’s only a child still. If anything should happen to her as a result of this illness, I\n",
      "think all the fun would go out of life!’\n",
      "While she was speaking Jia Rong came in, and having greeted in turn first Lady Xing,\n",
      "then Lady Wang, and then Xi-feng, he turned to his mother:\n",
      "‘I’ve just delivered the food to Grandfather, and I told him that Father was\n",
      "entertaining all the men of the family at home and had not presumed to visit him\n",
      "because of what he said. Grandfather was very pleased. He said “That is exactly as it\n",
      "should be.” He said I was to tell you and Father to see that my great-uncles and\n",
      "great-aunts are properly looked after, and he told me that I was to look after my\n",
      "uncles and aunts and cousins. He also said he wanted the blocks for Divine Rewards\n",
      "to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution.\n",
      "I’ve already given this message to Father. Now I’ve got to hurry off again to look after\n",
      "the gentlemen while they have their dinner.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Rong, just a moment!’ said Xi-feng as he was going. ‘How is it really with your\n",
      "wife?’\n",
      "Jia Rong’s brows contracted in a worried frown.\n",
      "‘She’s not at all well, Auntie. You’ll know what I mean when you see her presently.’\n",
      "He left without saying any more.\n",
      "‘Well, ladies!’ said You-shi. ‘Will you have dinner in here, or shall we eat in the\n",
      "garden? There are some actors in the garden preparing an entertainment.’\n",
      "‘In here would be all right, wouldn’t it?’ said Lady Wang with a glance in Lady Xing’s\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "You-shi at once gave orders to her women to serve. There was an answering cry from\n",
      "outside the door and a great flurry of domestics each bustling about her own\n",
      "contribution to the meal. In no time at all the table was laid and dinner ready. You-shi\n",
      "made Lady Xing and Lady Wang sit at the head with her mother, while she, Xi-feng\n",
      "and Bao-yu sat at the two sides.\n",
      "Lady Xing and Lady Wang politely protested that they had come to offer birthday\n",
      "felicitations, not to eat a birthday feast.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘After all these years of spiritual self-improvement, Uncle must by\n",
      "now be practically an Immortal. And with Immortals, as we all know, “it’s the thought\n",
      "that counts and not the ceremony”.’\n",
      "The others all laughed.\n",
      "You-shi’s mother, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng, having finished their meal,\n",
      "rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands, had just announced their intention\n",
      "of going into the garden, when Jia Rong came in with a message for his mother.\n",
      "‘My great-uncles and all the other gentlemen have just finished their dinner.\n",
      "Great-uncle She says he has business at home, and Great-uncle Zheng doesn’t like\n",
      "plays because he says he can’t stand the noise; but all the others have gone with\n",
      "Uncle Lian and Cousin Qiang to watch the players.\n",
      "‘People have come with cards and birthday presents from the Prince of An-nan, the\n",
      "Prince of Dong-ping, the Prince of Xi-ning, the Prince of Bei-jing, the Duke of\n",
      "Zhen-guo and five others of the Niu clan and the Marquis of Zhong-jing and seven\n",
      "others of the Shi clan. The presents have all been received at the counting-house.\n",
      "They have been entered in the gift-book, and the people who brought them have\n",
      "been issued with thank-you cards. They have also been tipped the usual amounts and\n",
      "given a meal before leaving.\n",
      "‘And Father says will you please bring the great-aunts and Grandmother You and\n",
      "Auntie Feng to the garden now.’\n",
      "‘Yes, we’ve finished too,’ said You-shi. We were about to come over when you\n",
      "arrived.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Aunt Wang,’ said Xi-feng, ‘may I go and see Rong’s wife first? I can go on to the\n",
      "garden from there.’\n",
      "‘Certainly. You ought to go,’ said Lady Wang. ‘In fact, we should all like to go with\n",
      "you, but I am afraid it would be too much excitement for her. Please give her our\n",
      "love.’\n",
      "‘My dear,’ said You-shi, ‘I know she will always do any-thing you ask her to. See if\n",
      "you can talk her into a more cheerful frame of mind. It would be such a relief to me if\n",
      "you could. But join us in the garden as soon as you can!’\n",
      "Bao-yu asked if he could go with Xi-feng to see Qin-shi.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She is your nephew’s wife. I think you should. Just look in for\n",
      "a moment, though, and then join the rest of us.’\n",
      "Thereupon You-shi invited Lady Wang, Lady Xing and old Mrs You to accompany her\n",
      "to the All-scents Garden, while Xi-feng and Bao-yu accompanied Jia Rong to Qin-shi’s\n",
      "room.\n",
      "Entering the door of the apartment, they tiptoed softly into the inner room. As soon\n",
      "as she saw them, Qin-shi attempted to rise, but Xi-feng would not let her.\n",
      "‘No, no, don’t get up!’ she said. ‘You will make yourself giddy.’\n",
      "In two rapid strides she was at her side and holding her by the hand.\n",
      "‘My dearest child! It’s only a few days since last I saw you, but look how thin you\n",
      "have grown!’\n",
      "She sat down beside her on the quilt on which she sat propped. Bao-yu, after\n",
      "greeting her, sat in a chair opposite.\n",
      "‘Pour out some tea,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Auntie Feng and Uncle Bao didn’t get any after\n",
      "their dinner.’\n",
      "Qin-shi grasped Xi-feng’s hand and forced a smile to her wan face.\n",
      "‘It looks as though I wasn’t meant to be happy, Auntie!’ she said. ‘This is such a\n",
      "lovely family to have married into. Rong’s parents treat me as if I were their own\n",
      "daughter. Rong may be young, but he respects me, and I respect him; there has never\n",
      "been a cross word between us. You, it goes without saying—but not only you, all the\n",
      "older members of the family—have always been goodness itself to me. I did so want\n",
      "to he worthy of all this kindness. But now this wretched illness has come along and\n",
      "taken away the chance. Now I shall never be able to be a good daughter to Rong’s\n",
      "parents; and however badly I want to, I shall never be able to repay any of the love\n",
      "you have shown me. I have a feeling inside me, Auntie: I don’t think I am going to last\n",
      "the year out.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had been studying the ‘Spring Slumber’ painting on Qin-shi’s wall all this time\n",
      "and re-reading the couplet by Qin Guan on the scrolls at each side of it:\n",
      "\f",
      "The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream;\n",
      "The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he did so, the memory returned of that earlier afternoon when he had slept in\n",
      "that very same room and dreamed about the Land of Illusion. He was musing on the\n",
      "contents of that dream when he suddenly became aware of the words that Qin-shi\n",
      "was saying. They pierced his heart like the points of a thousand arrows. Great tears\n",
      "welled up in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks. Xi-feng, seeing him, was herself\n",
      "deeply affected; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make Qin-shi even more\n",
      "distressed, whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up, she\n",
      "rallied him lightly on his tears.\n",
      "‘Don’t be such a baby, Bao-yu! It’s not really that serious: sick people always say\n",
      "things like that. Besides, she’s still young, and when you are young you can shake an\n",
      "illness off in no time at all. --- You mustn’t let yourself think such stupid things,’ she\n",
      "said, turning to Qin-shi. ‘You’ll make yourself worse.’\n",
      "‘If only she could get a bit of food inside her.’ said Jia Rong. ‘That’s her real trouble:\n",
      "she won’t eat anything.’\n",
      "‘Bao,’ said Xi-feng, ‘your mother told you not to stay long. If you’re going to be like\n",
      "this, you will only upset her, and in any case I expect your mother is beginning to\n",
      "wonder about you—You go on ahead with Uncle Bao,’ she said to Jia Rong. ‘I am\n",
      "going to sit a little longer with your wife.’\n",
      "     Jia Rong at once led Bao-yu away to join the others in the All-scents Garden,\n",
      "while Xi-feng addressed some words of encouragement to Qin-shi, after which,\n",
      "dropping her voice to a murmur, she engaged in a long and intimate conversation\n",
      "with her, ignoring two or three messages from You-shi urging her to join the party. At\n",
      "last she felt unable to stay any longer.\n",
      "‘Look after yourself!’ she said. ‘I shall come again. I feel sure that you are meant to\n",
      "get better. It can’t have been an accident that they found that doctor the other day;\n",
      "and now that you’ve got him, there’s really nothing to worry about.’\n",
      "Qin-shi smiled.\n",
      "‘Even if he’s a miracle-man, Auntie, “death’s a sickness none can cure”, and I know\n",
      "that it’s just a question of time now.’\n",
      "‘If you will go on talking like that, how can you possibly get better?’ said Xi-feng. ‘If\n",
      "only you would try to look on the bright side. Remember what the doctor said. He\n",
      "said that if you weren’t being properly treated, next spring would be dangerous for\n",
      "you. If this were a household which couldn’t afford things like ginseng for your\n",
      "treatment, you might have something to worry about. But now they know that you\n",
      "can be cured, there’s nothing Rong’s parents wouldn’t do and nothing they couldn’t\n",
      "\f",
      "afford to do for you. Never mind two drams of ginseng a day; if you needed two\n",
      "pounds a day, they would get it for you gladly. So do try and get better! I must go\n",
      "over to the garden now.’\n",
      "‘Forgive me for not being able to see you out, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi. ‘Please come\n",
      "again when you are free. We’ll have a nice talk together, just the two of us.’\n",
      "There were tears in Xi-feng’s eyes as she promised to come often, whenever she was\n",
      "free. Then, followed by the women who had accompanied her from the Rong\n",
      "mansion and a number of female domestics belonging to the Ning household, she\n",
      "made her way round to one of the side gates leading into the gardens.\n",
      "        Golden chrysanthemums covered the open spaces;\n",
      "        Silvery willow-trees bordered the water’s margins.\n",
      "    The little bridge arched its span over a storied stream;\n",
      "    The winding path made its way into a fairy hill.\n",
      "        Crystal rills tinkled amidst the rocks.\n",
      "        A quickset hedge recalled preautumnal fragrances.\n",
      "        Crimson leaves fluttered upon the boughs.\n",
      "        A wintry copse described calligraphic traceries.\n",
      "        In the cold wind’s more insistent blast\n",
      "        The oriole’s cry could still be heard.\n",
      "        In the late sun’s more infrequent warmth\n",
      "        The cricket’s chirp a while revived.\n",
      "        At the far south-east end\n",
      "    Pavilions nestled in artificial mountains.\n",
      "    On the near north-west side\n",
      "    Verandahs brooded on circumjacent waters.\n",
      "    Music of little organs playing in the summer-house\n",
      "    Increased the melancholy in the air.\n",
      "    Glimpses of women’s dresses flitting through the little wood\n",
      "    Enhanced the delicacy of the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xi-feng was making her way through the garden, admiring the view as she went,\n",
      "when a figure suddenly stepped out from behind an artificial hill of rock and made its\n",
      "way towards her:\n",
      "‘How are you, cousin?’\n",
      "Xi-feng gave a start of surprise and retreated a step.\n",
      "‘Isn’t it Cousin Rui?’\n",
      "‘Don’t you even know who I am, cousin?’\n",
      "‘It isn’t that I don’t know you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but you did come up rather suddenly\n",
      "\f",
      "and I wasn’t expecting to see you here.’\n",
      "‘We must have been fated to meet, cousin,’ said Jia Rui. ‘I had just slipped away\n",
      "from the party to take a little stroll in these peaceful surroundings. I never expected\n",
      "to meet my fair cousin here, but lo! So there must be a bond.’\n",
      "He ogled her as he spoke with a fixed and meaningful stare.\n",
      "Xi-feng’s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little\n",
      "game he was playing, and feigning an interest she did not feel, she answered him\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "‘I can see why Lian is always speaking so highly of you. From seeing you today and\n",
      "just hearing you speak those few words I can tell at once that you are an intelligent,\n",
      "good-natured sort of person. At the moment I’m on my way to join my aunts, and I’m\n",
      "afraid that I can’t stay and talk to you. Perhaps we could meet some other time when\n",
      "we are both free?’\n",
      "      ‘I should like to call on you when you are at home,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but I suppose a\n",
      "young person like your good self is not in a position to receive visitors of the other\n",
      "sex.’\n",
      "      Xi-feng feigned a laugh.\n",
      "      ‘We’re all one family—all one flesh and blood. I don’t see that age comes into it.’\n",
      "      Jia Rui was secretly delighted by this encouragement.\n",
      "      ‘I never dreamed today would bring a chance like this my way,’ he thought, and\n",
      "the goatish eagerness of his expression grew even more repellent.\n",
      "      ‘You had better hurry back to the party,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If they catch you playing\n",
      "truant, you will find yourself being sconced!’\n",
      "      Jia Rui was by now scarcely in command of his own person. Slowly, very slowly\n",
      "he walked away, frequently turning back to gaze at Xi-feng as he did so. Xi-feng\n",
      "mischievously pro?voked him by deliberately slowing down the pace of her own\n",
      "progress through the garden.\n",
      "     ‘What an odious creature!’ she thought to herself when there was some distance\n",
      "between them. ‘Appearances certainly are deceptive! Who would have guessed he\n",
      "was that sort of person? Well, if he is, he had better look out! One of these days I’ll\n",
      "settle his hash for him; then perhaps he will realize what sort of person he is up\n",
      "against!’\n",
      "     Xi-feng had resumed a normal pace and had just skirted the foot of a little hill,\n",
      "when she saw two or three old serving-women hurrying towards her in a state of\n",
      "great agitation.\n",
      "     ‘Oh, Mrs Lian,’ said one of the old women with a smile, when they caught sight\n",
      "of her, ‘our mistress has been getting into such a state because you didn’t come!\n",
      "She’s sent us to fetch you.’\n",
      "\f",
      "    ‘Just like your mistress!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Always in a lather about something or\n",
      "other!’ and she sauntered on quite un?concernedly, talking to the old woman as she\n",
      "went.\n",
      "    ‘How many pieces have they done so far?’\n",
      "    ‘Eight or nine,’ the old woman replied.\n",
      "    By this time they had arrived at the rear entrance of the two-storey Celestial\n",
      "Fragrance Pavilion, where they found Bao-yu playing with a group of maids.\n",
      "    ‘Mind you don’t make a nuisance of yourself, Bao,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "    ‘Lady Xing and Lady Wang are sitting upstairs watching,’ said one of the maids.\n",
      "‘You can get up there from this side, madam.’\n",
      "    Lifting up her skirts, Xi-feng climbed slowly up the stairs. She found You-shi\n",
      "standing at the top waiting for her.\n",
      "    ‘You are an affectionate pair!’ said You-shi with a smile. ‘Once the two of you\n",
      "meet, there’s no separating you. Tomorrow you had better move in with her and set\n",
      "up house together! Come on, sit down! I’m going to drink a cup of wine with you!’\n",
      "    Xi-feng asked her two aunts for permission to sit. When she had done so You-shi\n",
      "held out the playbill and invited her to make a choice.\n",
      "    ‘It’s not for me to choose when Mother and Aunt Wang are here,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "    ‘Go ahead and choose!’ said Lady Xing. ‘Mrs You and your aunt and I have\n",
      "already chosen a number of plays. Now you pick out one or two good ones for us!’\n",
      "    Xi-feng politely rose to thank her, and taking the playbill from You-shi, scanned it\n",
      "through and picked out two of the items listed: one a scene from The Return of the\n",
      "Soul and the other ‘Gai-nian Plays His Guitar’ from The Palace of Eternal Youth.\n",
      "    ‘If they do these two after they have finished singing this scene from Faithful\n",
      "Bi-lian,’ she said, handing the playbill back to You-shi, ‘I think that will be just about\n",
      "enough for the day.’\n",
      "      ‘I’m sure it will,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We ought in any case to break up early, so that\n",
      "our hosts can get a good night’s rest. They have had a lot on their minds lately.’\n",
      "      ‘It isn’t often that you both come to see us,’ said You-shi.\n",
      "      ‘Please stay as long as you can. It will be so much more fun. It’s really quite early\n",
      "yet.’\n",
      "‘Where have all the gentlemen gone to?’ inquired Xi-feng, who had got up from her\n",
      "seat and was peering down into the lower storey.\n",
      "‘They have gone off to the Frozen Sunlight Gallery to drink,’ said one of the old\n",
      "women in attendance. ‘They left only a moment ago. They’ve taken the band with\n",
      "them.’\n",
      "‘What was wrong with this place?’ said Xi-feng, ‘Heaven knows what they can be\n",
      "getting up to behind our backs!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘We can’t all be as strait-laced as you are,’ said You-shi with a laugh.\n",
      "As they laughed and chattered together, the actors even?tually finished performing\n",
      "the second of the two pieces Xi?-feng had selected, whereupon the wine was\n",
      "removed from the tables and rice served. When they had finished their meal, the\n",
      "company retired to the main reception room indoors and took tea there, after which\n",
      "carriages were called for and the other ladies took their leave of old Mrs You. You-shi\n",
      "stood at the head of all the concubines and female domestics of the Ning household\n",
      "to see them outside, while Cousin Zhen at the head of the junior male members of\n",
      "his family stood beside the waiting carriages.\n",
      "‘You must come again tomorrow, ladies,’ said Cousin Zhen to Lady Xing and Lady\n",
      "Wang as they emerged from the house.\n",
      "‘I think not,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We have sat here the whole day being entertained\n",
      "and we are all rather tired now. I think tomorrow we should like a rest.’\n",
      "Jia Rui was staring fixedly at Xi-feng throughout this exchange.\n",
      "After Cousin Zhen had gone indoors again, Li Gui led out a horse and Bao-yu\n",
      "mounted on its back and rode off behind Lady Wang’s carriage. Cousin Zhen and the\n",
      "other males then sat down to supper and, when it was over, the party broke up. Next\n",
      "day there was another day of feasting for the members of the clan, particulars of\n",
      "which, however, we omit from our record. We shall confine ourselves to observing\n",
      "that from that day on Xi-feng paid frequent calls on Qin-shi. Sometimes her illness\n",
      "seemed slightly better for a day or two, sometimes it seemed slightly worse. Cousin\n",
      "Zhen, You-shi and Jia Rong were acutely worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "Jia Rui made several visits to the Rong mansion, but all his calls seemed to coincide\n",
      "with Xi-feng’s visits to the Ning mansion to see Qin-shi.\n",
      "The thirtieth day of the eleventh month, the day of the winter solstice, arrived. It was\n",
      "the turn of the season, and for several days before it Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang\n",
      "and Xi-?feng had been sending messengers daily to inquire after Qin shi. Each time\n",
      "the report they brought back was the same:\n",
      "‘She hasn’t got any worse these last few days, but she doesn’t seem to be very\n",
      "much better.’\n",
      "‘At this time of year,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it’s a hopeful sign if an illness like hers\n",
      "doesn’t get any worse.’\n",
      "‘Oh I do hope so!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That sweet child! If anything should\n",
      "happen to her, it would break my heart.’\n",
      "A wave of bitterness passed over her.\n",
      "‘You and she have always been good friends,’ she said turning to Xi-feng.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Tomorrow is the “First of the Last”. Go and see her again some time after tomorrow.\n",
      "Have a very careful look and try to find out exactly how she is. If she seems a bit\n",
      "better, come and tell me when you get back. And if there is anything the dear child\n",
      "has ever fancied eating in the past, see that she is kept constantly supplied with it.’\n",
      "Xi-feng promised to do as she had said, and on the second day of the next month she\n",
      "went over to the Ning-guo man?sion as soon as she had finished her breakfast.\n",
      "Qin-shi’s sickness appeared to be no worse than previously, but the flesh on her face\n",
      "and body was pitifully wasted. Xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her, and once\n",
      "more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness.\n",
      "‘We shall know the worst when the spring comes,’ said Qin-shi. ‘At least I’ve got\n",
      "past the solstice without anything happening, so perhaps I shall get better. Give\n",

      "easy to digest.’\n",
      "‘I’ll send you some more tomorrow,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I must go and see your\n",
      "mother-in-law, and after that I have to hurry back and give my report on you to\n",
      "Grandma.’\n",
      "‘Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my love, Auntie.’\n",
      "‘I will,’ said Xi-feng, and left her.\n",
      "She went into You-shi’s reception room and sat down.\n",
      "‘Tell me honestly,’ said You-shi. ‘What did you think of her?’\n",
      "Xi-feng sat silent for some time with lowered head.\n",
      "‘There’s no hope, is there? You’ll have to start getting things ready for the end. Of\n",
      "course, it’s always possible that doing so may break the bad luck.’\n",
      "‘I’ve already been quietly making a few preparations on the side,’ said You-shi. ‘The\n",
      "only thing we haven’t yet got is the right timber {or the you know what. But we’re\n",
      "looking round all the time.\n",
      "Xi-feng had some tea and chatted a while longer with You-shi. Then she said:\n",
      "‘I must hurry back to report to Grandma.’\n",
      "‘Break it to her gently,’ said You-shi. ‘You don’t want to give her a shock, at her age.’\n",
      "‘Of course,’ said Xi-feng, and rising to her feet went straight back home and called\n",
      "on Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘Rong’s wife asked me to give you her regards, Grandma. She sends you a kotow\n",
      "and she says she feels somewhat better. She begs you not to worry about her. And\n",
      "she says that when she’s made a bit more progress she’s going to come over to see\n",
      "you and make you a kotow in person.’\n",
      "‘How did you think she seemed?’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘For the time being there doesn’t seem to be anything much to worry about,’ said\n",
      "\f",
      "Xi-feng. ‘She seems to be in quite good spirits.’\n",
      "For a long time the old lady brooded in silence. Then, remembering Xi-feng, she told\n",
      "her to change her clothes and rest a while.\n",
      "Xi-feng said yes, she would, and after calling on Lady Wang, went back to her own\n",
      "apartment, where Patience had warmed her everyday clothes for her to change into.\n",
      "When she had changed, she sat down and asked Patience if anything had happened\n",
      "during her absence.\n",
      "‘Nothing, really,’ said Patience, handing her some tea. ‘Brightie’s wife came with\n",
      "the interest on the three hundred taels of silver and I received it for you. Oh, and Mr\n",
      "Rui sent someone to ask if you were in. He wants to pay you a call and talk about\n",
      "something.’\n",
      "Xi-feng snorted.\n",
      "‘Horrible creature! he seems to be looking for trouble. Just let him come, then!’\n",
      "‘What does Mr Rui want?’ asked Patience. ‘Why does he keep coming like this?’\n",
      "In reply Xi-feng gave her a full account of her encounter with him in the garden of the\n",
      "Ning-guo mansion and of the things he had said to her on that occasion,\n",
      "‘What a nasty, disgusting man!’ said Patience. ‘A case of “the toad on the ground\n",
      "wanting to eat the goose in the sky”. He’ll come to no good end, getting ideas like\n",
      "that!’\n",
      "‘Just wait till he comes! ‘ said Xi-feng. ‘I know how to deal with him.’\n",
      "But if you wish to know the outcome of Jia Rui’s visit, you will have to read the next\n",
      "chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 12\n",
      "\n",
      "Wang Xi-feng sets a trap for her admirer\n",
      "And Jia Rui looks into the wrong side of the mirror\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Rui’s arrival was announced while Xi-feng and Patience were still talking about\n",
      "him.\n",
      "     ‘Ask him in,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "     Hearing that he was to be received, Jia Rui rejoiced in?wardly. He came into the\n",
      "room wreathed in smiles and over?whelmed Xi-feng with civilities. With feigned\n",
      "solicitude she pressed him to be seated and to take tea. He became quite ecstatic at\n",
      "the sight of her informal dress.\n",
      "     ‘Why isn’t Cousin Lian back yet?’ he asked, staring with fascinated eyes.\n",
      "‘I don’t know what the reason can be,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘Could it be,’ Jia Rui inquired archly, ‘that Someone has detained him on his way\n",
      "home and that he can’t tear himself away?’\n",
      "     ‘Men are all the same!’ said Xi-feng. ‘They have only to set eyes on a woman to\n",
      "begin another affair.’\n",
      "     ‘Ah, there you are wrong!’ said Jia Rui. ‘I am not that sort of man.’\n",
      "     ‘But how many men are there like you?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I doubt you could find one\n",
      "in ten.’\n",
      "     At this last remark Jia Rui positively scratched his ears with pleasure.\n",
      "     ‘You must find it very dull here on your own every day,’ he said.\n",
      "     ‘Yes, indeed!’ said Xi-feng. ‘If only there were someone who could come and talk\n",
      "to me and help me to pass the time!’\n",
      "     ‘Well,’ said Jia Rui, ‘I am always free. How would it be if I were to come every day\n",
      "to help you pass the time?’\n",
      "     ‘You must be joking!’ said Xi-feng. ‘What would you want to come here for?’\n",
      "    ‘I mean every word I say,’ said Jia Rui. ‘May I be struck by lightning if I don’t! True,\n",
      "there was a time when I should have been scared to come, because people always\n",
      "told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you; but now\n",
      "I know that in reality you are all gentleness and fun, there is nothing that could stop\n",
      "me coming. I would come now if it cost me my life.’\n",
      "     ‘It’s true then,’ said Xi-feng, smiling delightedly. ‘You really are an understanding\n",
      "sort of person --- so much more so than Rong or Qiang! I used to think that since they\n",
      "were such handsome and cultured-looking young men they must be understanding\n",
      "as well, but they turned out to be stupid brutes without the least consideration for\n",
      "other people’s feelings.’\n",
      "    This little speech went straight to Jia Rui’s heart, and un?consciously he began\n",
      "edging his seat nearer to Xi-feng’s. He peered closely at an embroidered purse that\n",
      "she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings.\n",
      "‘Take care!’ said Xi-feng in a low tone. ‘The servants might see you!’\n",
      "    Obedient to his goddess’s command, Jia Rui quickly drew back again. Xi-feng\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "‘You had better go!’\n",
      "    ‘Ah no, cruel cousin! Let me stay a little longer!’\n",
      "    ‘Even if you stay, it’s not very convenient here in broad daylight, with people\n",
      "coming and going all the time. Go away now and come hack later when it’s dark, at\n",
      "the beginning of the first watch. You can slip into the gallery west of this apart?ment\n",
      "and wait for me there.’\n",
      "    Jia Rui received these words like someone being presented with a rare and costly\n",
      "jewel.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Are you sure you’re not joking ?’he asked hurriedly. ‘A lot of people must go\n",
      "through that way. How should we avoid being seen?’\n",
      "     ‘Don’t worry!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll give the watchmen a night off. When the side\n",
      "gates are closed, no one else can get through.’\n",
      "     Jia Rui was beside himself with delight and hurriedly took his leave, confident\n",
      "that the fulfilment of all he wished for was now in sight. Having waited impatiently\n",
      "for nightfall, he groped his way into the Rong-guo mansion just before they closed\n",
      "the gates and slipped into the gallery, now totally deserted—as Xi-feng had promised\n",
      "it would be—and black as pitch.\n",
      "     The gate at the end of the alley-way opening on to Grand?mother Jia’s quarters\n",
      "had already been barred on the outer side; only the gate at the east end remained\n",
      "open. For a long time Jia Rui listened intently, but no one came. Suddenly there was a\n",
      "loud slam and the gate at the east end, too, banged shut. Alarmed, but not daring to\n",
      "make a sound, Jia Rui stealthily crept out and tried it. It was locked—as tight as a\n",
      "bucket. Now even if he wanted to get out he could not, for the walls on either side of\n",
      "the alley-way were too high to scale. Moreover the gallery was bare and draughty\n",
      "and this was the midwinter season when the nights are long and the bitter north\n",
      "wind seems to pierce into the very marrow of the bones. By the end of the night he\n",
      "was almost dead with cold.\n",
      "     When at last morning came, Jia Rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old\n",
      "woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up. Still\n",
      "hugging himself against the cold, he sprinted out of the other gate while her back\n",
      "was towards him. Fortunately no one was about at that early hour, and he was able\n",
      "to slip out of the rear entrance of the mansion and run back home unseen.\n",
      "     Jia Rui had lost both of his parents in infancy and had been brought up under the\n",
      "sole guardianship of his grandfather Jia Dai-ru. Obsessed by the fear that once\n",
      "outside the house his grandson might indulge in drinking and gambling to the\n",
      "detriment of his studies, Dai-ru had subjected him since early youth to an iron\n",
      "discipline from which not the slightest deviation was tolerated. Seeing him now\n",
      "suddenly absent him?self a whole night from home, and being incapable, in his\n",
      "wildest imaginings, of guessing what had really happened, he took it as a foregone\n",
      "conclusion that he had been either drink?ing or gaming and had probably passed the\n",
      "night in some house of prostitution --- a supposition which caused the old gentleman\n",
      "to spend the whole night in a state of extreme choler.\n",
      "     The prospect of facing his grandfather on arrival made Jia Rui sweat. A lie of\n",
      "some sort was indispensable.\n",
      "     ‘I went to see Uncle yesterday,’ he managed to say, ‘and as it was getting dark, he\n",
      "asked me to stay the night.’\n",
      "\f",
      "     ‘I have always told you that you are not to go out of that gate without first\n",
      "informing me,’ said his grandfather. ‘Why then did you presume to go off on your\n",
      "own yesterday without saying a word to anybody? That in itself would constitute\n",
      "sufficient grounds for chastisement. But in addition to that you are lying!’\n",
      "     Thereupon he, forced him to the ground, and, with the utmost savagery, dealt\n",
      "him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo, after which he forbade him to eat and\n",
      "made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared\n",
      "the equivalent of ten days’ homework.\n",
      "     The exquisite torments suffered by Jia Rui, as he knelt with an empty stomach in\n",
      "the draughty courtyard reciting his homework after having already been frozen all\n",
      "night long and then beaten, can be imagined.\n",
      "     Yet even now his infatuation remained unaltered. It never entered his mind that\n",
      "he had been made a fool of. And so two days later, as soon as he had some free time,\n",
      "he was back once more looking for Xi-feng. She deliberately reproached him for\n",
      "having failed her, thereby so exasperating him that he swore by the most terrible\n",
      "oaths that he had been faithful. Seeing him hurl himself so willingly into the net,\n",
      "Xi-feng decided that a further lesson would be needed to cure him of his folly and\n",
      "proposed another assignation.\n",
      "     ‘Only tonight,’ she said, ‘don’t wait for me in that place again. Wait in the empty\n",
      "room in the little passage-way behind this apartment. But mind you don’t run into\n",
      "anybody.’\n",
      "     ‘Do you really mean this?’ said Jia Rui.\n",
      "     ‘If you don’t believe me, don’t come!’\n",
      "     ‘I’ll come! I’ll come!’ said Jia Rui. ‘Whatever happens, I shall be there.’\n",
      "      ‘Now I think you had better go.’\n",
      "      Confident of seeing her again in the evening, Jia Rui went off uncomplainingly,\n",
      "leaving Xi-feng time to muster her forces, brief her officers, and prepare the trap in\n",
      "which the luckless man was to be caught.\n",
      "      Jia Rui waited for the evening with great impatience. By a stroke of bad luck\n",
      "some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper. It was already lamplight when\n",
      "they left, and Jia Rui then had to wait for his grandfather to settle down for the night\n",
      "before he could scuttle off to the Rong mansion and make his way to the room in the\n",
      "little passage-way where Xi-feng had told him to go. He waited there for her arrival\n",
      "with the frenzied agitation of an ant on a hot saucepan. Yet, though he waited and\n",
      "waited, not a human shape appeared nor a human sound was heard, and he began\n",
      "to be frightened and a little suspicious:\n",
      "‘Surely she won’t fail me? Surely I shan’t be made to spend another night in the\n",
      "cold...?’\n",
      "\f",
      "As he was in the midst of these gloomy imaginings, a dark figure glided into the room.\n",
      "Certain that it must be Xi-feng, Jia Rui cast all caution to the winds and, when the\n",
      "figure approached him, threw himself upon it like a hungry tiger seizing its prey or a\n",
      "cat pouncing on a harmless mouse.\n",
      "‘My darling, how I have waited for you!” he exclaimed, enfolding his beloved in his\n",
      "arms; and carrying her to the kang, he laid her down and began kissing her and\n",
      "tugging at her trousers, murmuring ‘my sweetest darling’ and ‘my honey love’ and\n",
      "other such endearments in between kisses. Throughout all of this not a single sound\n",
      "was uttered by his partner. Jia Rui now tore down his own trousers and prepared to\n",
      "thrust home his hard and throbbing member. Suddenly a light flashed --- and there\n",
      "was Jia Qiang holding aloft a candle in a candlestick which he shone around:\n",
      "‘Who is in this room?’\n",
      "At this the person on the kang gave a giggle:\n",
      "‘Uncle Rui is trying to bugger me!’\n",
      "Horrors! The sight he saw when he looked down made Jia Rui want to sink into the\n",
      "ground. It was Jia Rong! He turned to bolt, but Jia Qiang held him fast.\n",
      "‘Oh no you don’t! Auntie Lian has already told Lady Wang that you have been\n",
      "pestering her. She asked us to keep you here while she went to tell. When Lady Wang\n",
      "first heard, she was so angry that she fainted, but now she’s come round again and is\n",
      "asking for you to be brought to her. Come along, then! Off we go!’\n",
      "At these words Jia Rui’s soul almost left its seat in his body.\n",
      "‘My dear nephew, just tell her that you didn’t find me here!’ he said. ‘Tomorrow I\n",
      "will reward you handsomely.’\n",
      "‘I suppose I could let you go easily enough,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘The question is, how big\n",
      "would this reward be? In any case, just saying that you will give me a reward is no\n",
      "good. I should want a written guarantee.’\n",
      "‘But I can’t put a thing like this down in writing!’\n",
      "‘No problem there,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Just say that you’ve lost money gambling and\n",
      "have borrowed such and such an amount to cover your losses. That’s all you need\n",
      "do.’\n",
      "‘I could do that, certainly,’ said Jia Rui.\n",
      "Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a\n",
      "writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance. Writing at his\n",
      "dicta?tion Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver\n",
      "as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once\n",
      "pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong. But\n",
      "Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and in?sisted that he would lay\n",
      "the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done.\n",
      "\f",
      "Jia Rui became quite frantic and kotowed to him. Finally, under pressure from Jia\n",
      "Qiang and in return for another IOU for fifty taels of silver made out in his favour, he\n",
      "allowed his scruples to be overcome.\n",
      "‘You realize, don’t you,’ said Jia Qiang, ‘that I’m going to get into trouble for this?\n",
      "Now let’s see. The gate leading to Lady Jia’s courtyard was bolted some time ago, and\n",
      "Sir Zheng is at the moment in the main reception room looking at some stuff that has\n",
      "just arrived from Nanking, so you can’t go through that way. The only way left would\n",
      "be through the back gate. The trouble is, though, that if you leave now, you might\n",
      "run into someone on the way, and then I should get into even worse trouble. You’d\n",
      "better let me scout around a bit first and come for you when the coast is clear. In the\n",
      "meantime you can t hide here, though, because they will shortly be com?ing in to\n",
      "store the stuff from Nanking here. I’ll find somewhere else for you.’\n",
      "He took Jia Rui by the arm, and having first blown the candle out, led him into the\n",
      "courtyard and groped his way round to the underside of the steps which led up to\n",
      "the terrace of the central building.\n",
      "‘This hollow under the steps will do. Crouch down there, and don’t make a sound!\n",
      "You can go when I come for you.\n",
      "Jia Qiang and Jia Rong then went off leaving him to him?self.\n",
      "Jia Rui, by now a mere automaton in the hands of his cap?tors, obediently crouched\n",
      "down beneath the steps and was just beginning a series of calculations respecting his\n",
      "present financial predicament when a sudden slosh! signalled the dis?charge of a\n",
      "slop-pail’s stinking contents immediately above his head, drenching him from top to\n",
      "toe with liquid filth and causing him to cry out in dismay --- but only momentarily, for\n",
      "the excrement covered his face and head and caused him to close his mouth again in\n",
      "a hurry and crouch silent and shivering in the icy cold. Just then Jia Qiang came\n",
      "running up:\n",
      "     ‘Hurry! hurry! You can go now.’\n",
      "At the word of command Jia Rui bounded out of his hole and sprinted for dear life\n",
      "through the rear gate and back to his own home. It was now past midnight, and he\n",
      "had to shout for someone to let him in. When the servant who answered the gate\n",
      "saw the state he was in and asked him how it had happened, he had to pretend that\n",
      "he had been out in the darkness to ease himself and had fallen into the jakes. Then\n",
      "rushing into his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed, his mind running\n",
      "all the time on how Xi-feng had tricked him. The thought of her trickery provoked a\n",
      "surge of hatred in his soul; yet even as he hated her, the vision of her loveliness made\n",
      "him long to clasp her to his breast. Torn by these violent and con?flicting emotions,\n",
      "he passed the whole night without a single wink of sleep.\n",
      "From that time on, though he longed for Xi-feng with un?abated passion, he never\n",
      "\f",
      "dared to visit the Rong-guo mansion again. Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, on the other hand,\n",
      "came frequently to his house to ask for their money, so that he was in constant dread\n",
      "of his grandfather finding out about the IOUs.\n",
      "Unable, even now, to overcome his longing for Xi-feng, saddled with a heavy burden\n",
      "of debt, harassed during the day?time by the schoolwork set him by his exacting\n",
      "grandfather, worn-out during the nights by the excessive hand-pumping inevitable in\n",
      "an unmarried man of twenty whose mistress was both unattainable and constantly in\n",
      "his thoughts, twice frozen, tormented and forced to flee --- what constitution could\n",
      "with?stand so many shocks and strains without succumbing in the end to illness? The\n",
      "symptoms of Jia Rui’s illness—a palpitation in the heart, a loss of taste in the mouth,\n",
      "a weakness in the hams, a smarting in the eyes, feverishness by night and lassi?tude\n",
      "by day, albumen in the urine and blood-flecks in the phlegm—had all manifested\n",
      "themselves within less than a year. By that time they had produced a complete\n",
      "breakdown and driven him to his bed, where he lay, with eyes tight shut, babbling\n",
      "deliriously and inspiring terror in all who saw him. Physicians were called in to treat\n",
      "him and some bushels of cinnamon bark, autumn root, turtle-shell, black leek and\n",
      "Solomon’s seal must at one time and another have been in-fused and taken without\n",
      "the least observable effect.\n",
      "Winter went and spring came and Jia Rui’s sickness grew even worse. His grandfather\n",
      "Dai-ru was in despair. Medical advice from every quarter had been taken and none of\n",
      "it had proved effective. The most recent advice was that the patient should be given\n",
      "a pure decoction of ginseng without admixture of other ingredients. So costly a\n",
      "remedy was far beyond Dai?-ru’s resources and he was obliged to go to the Rong-guo\n",
      "man?sion to beg. Lady Wang ordered Wang Xi-feng to weigh out two ounces for him\n",
      "from their own supplies.\n",
      "‘The other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for Grandmother,’ said\n",
      "Xi-feng, ‘you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you\n",
      "were sending to General Yang’s wife. I sent her the medicine yesterday, sol am afraid\n",
      "we haven’t any left.’\n",
      "‘Well, even if we haven’t got any,’ said Lady Wang, ‘you can send to your\n",
      "mother-in-law’s for some; and probably they will have some at your Cousin Zhen’s.\n",
      "Between you you ought somehow or other to be able to raise enough to give him. If\n",
      "you can save a man’s life by doing so, you will have performed a work of merit.’\n",
      "But though Xi-feng pretended to do as Lady Wang suggested, in fact she made no\n",
      "such inquiries. She merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent\n",
      "them to Dai-ru with a message that ‘Lady Wang had instructed her to send this, and\n",
      "it was all they had.’ To Lady Wang, however, she reported that she had asked the\n",
      "others and altogether obtained more than two ounces of ginseng which she had sent\n",
      "\f",
      "to Dai-ru.\n",
      "Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swal?lowed every medicine that\n",
      "they offered him; but all was a waste of money, for nothing seemed to do him any\n",
      "good. One day a lame Taoist appeared at the door asking for alms and claiming to be\n",

      "from his bed:\n",
      "‘Quick, tell the holy man to come in and save me!’ and as he called, he kotowed\n",
      "with his head on the pillow. The servants were obliged to bring the Taoist into the\n",
      "bedroom. Jia Rui clung to him tenaciously.\n",
      "‘Holy one, save me!’ he cried out again and again.\n",
      "The Taoist sighed.\n",

      "So saying, he took from his satchel a mirror which had reflecting surfaces on both its\n",
      "sides. The words A MIRROR FOR THE ROMANTIC were inscribed on the back. He\n",
      "handed it to Jia Rui.\n",
      "‘This object comes from the Hall of Emptiness in the Land of Illusion. It was\n",
      "fashioned by the fairy Disenchantment as an antidote to the ill effects of impure\n",

      "the world for the contemplation of those intelligent and hand?some young\n",

      "never under any circumstances look into the front. Three days hence I shall come\n",
      "again to reclaim it, by which time I guarantee that your illness will have gone.’\n",
      "With that he left, at a surprising speed, ignoring the earnest entreaties of those\n",
      "present that he should stay longer.\n",
      "‘This is intriguing!’ Jia Rui thought to himself when the Taoist gave him the mirror.\n",
      "‘Let me try looking into it as he says, and holding it up to his face he looked into the\n",
      "back as instructed and saw a grinning skull, which he covered up hastily with a curse:\n",
      "‘Silly old fool, to scare me like that! -- But let me see what happens when I look into\n",
      "the other side!’\n",
      "He turned the mirror round and looked, and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to\n",
      "him to enter, and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her. There they\n",
      "performed the act of love together, after which she saw him out again. But when he\n",
      "found himself once more back in his bed he stared and cried out in horror: for the\n",
      "mirror, of its own accord, had turned itself round in his hand and the same grinning\n",
      "skull faced him that he had seen before. He could feel the sweat trickling all over his\n",
      "\f",
      "body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated.\n",
      "Yet still he was not satisfied, and turned the face of the mirror once more towards\n",
      "him. Xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling, and again he went in after\n",
      "her. He did this three or four times. But the last time, just as he was going to return\n",
      "from the mirror, two figures approached him hold?ing iron chains which they\n",
      "fastened round him and by which they proceeded to drag him away. He cried out as\n",
      "they dragged him:\n",
      "‘Wait! Let me take the mirror with me . . .!\n",
      "Those were the last words he ever uttered.\n",
      "To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he\n",
      "appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then\n",
      "to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from\n",
      "his grasp, he finally ceased to move.\n",
      "When they examined him more closely they found that his breathing had already\n",
      "stopped and that underneath his body there was a large, wet, icy patch of recently\n",
      "ejaculated semen.\n",
      "At once they lifted him from the bed and busied themselves with the laying-out,\n",
      "while old Dai-ru and his wife abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of grief. They\n",
      "cursed the Taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and\n",
      "cast the mirror upon the flames. But just at that moment a voice was heard in the air\n",
      "saying, ‘Who told him to look in the front? It is you who are to blame, for confusing\n",
      "the unreal with the real! Why then should you burn my mirror?’\n",
      "Suddenly the mirror was seen to rise up and fly out of the room, and when Dai-ru\n",
      "went outside to look, there was the lame Taoist asking for it back. He snatched it as it\n",
      "flew towards him and disappeared before Dai-ru’s very eyes.\n",
      "Seeing that there was to be no redress, Dai-yu was obliged to set about preparing for\n",
      "the funeral and began by announc?ing his grandson’s death to everybody concerned.\n",
      "Reading of the sutras began on the third day and on the seventh the coffin was\n",
      "drawn in procession to temporary lodging in the Temple of the Iron Threshold to\n",
      "await future reburial. The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to\n",

      "     ‘Now you are being silly, Auntie!’ said Qin-shi somewhat scornfully. ‘“The\n",
      "extreme of adversity is the beginning of prosperity” --- and the reverse of that saying\n",
      "is also true. Honour and disgrace follow each other in an unending cycle. No human\n",

      "them. That is the first matter. The second matter concerns the clan school. There\n",
      "again, there is no fixed source of income. Obviously there will be no lack of funds\n",
      "either for the seasonal offerings or for the school as long as we enjoy our present\n",
      "prosperity. But where is the money for them coming from in the future, when the\n",

      "\f",
      "offerings and the running of the school entirely out of the income from this property.\n",
      "Moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it. The whole clan, old and young\n",
      "alike, should be convened and a set of regulations drawn up whereby each family is\n",
      "made to administer the estate and look after the financing of the seasonal offerings\n",

      "farm and study, as well as a means of maintaining the ancestral sacrifices in unbroken\n",
      "succession. To refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our\n",

      "his own. The news of Qin-shi’s death came to him in the midst of his dreams, causing\n",
      "him to start up in bed with a jerk. A sudden stabbing pain shot through his heart. He\n",
      "retched involuntarily and spat out a mouthful of blood. Aroma and the maids clung\n",
      "to him, terrified, and asked him what was the matter. They wanted to tell\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and ask her to send for a doctor; but Bao-yu would not hear of it.\n",

      "      Cousin Zhen was delighted, and the timber was brought over at once for\n",
      "everyone to inspect. The planks for the base and sides were at least eight inches thick.\n",
      "The wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and\n",
      "sandalwood. When rapped with the knuckles it gave off a hard, ringing sound like\n",

      "seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the\n",
      "streets before him, to present his offerings in person. Cousin Zhen at once made up\n",
      "his mind to take advantage of the visit.\n",
      "      As soon as Dai Quan had made his offering, Cousin Zhen ushered him into the\n",
      "Honey Bee Gallery, invited him to be seated, and served him with tea. Then, entering\n",
      "into conversa?tion with his guest, he quickly found occasion to mention the fact that\n",
      "he was thinking of purchasing a place for his son Jia Rong. The eunuch guessed what\n",
      "was in his mind, and laughingly inquired whether it was not with a view to adding a\n",
      "little pomp to the funeral that he had conceived this notion.\n",
      "      ‘My dear Chamberlain,’ Cousin Zhen readily agreed, you have hit the nail on the\n",
      "head!’\n",
      "      ‘Well, by a lucky coincidence,’ said Dai Quan, ‘there is rather a good place going\n",
      "at this very moment. The Corps of Officers of the Imperial Guard, which has an\n",
      "establishment of three hundred, has got two vacancies in it. Yesterday Lord\n",
      "Xiang-yang’s younger brother “Sannikins” begged me for one of them and sent\n",
      "fifteen hundred taels of silver round to my house to pay for it. He and I have always\n",
      "been good friends, as you know, and in any case I felt I had to do some?thing, for his\n",
      "Grandpa’s sake; so I couldn’t very well refuse. “Piggy” Feng, the Military Governor of\n",
      "Yong-xing, has asked me if he can buy the remaining place for his son, but I haven’t\n",
      "yet had time to give him a reply. If our young friend here wants it, why not jot down\n",
      "his particulars and I’ll see what I can do.’\n",
      "     Cousin Zhen at once ordered someone to write out Jia Rong’s name, age and\n",
      "lineage on a sheet of red paper. The following description was hurriedly prepared and\n",
      "handed to Dai Quan for his inspection:\n",
      "\n",
      "Name: JIA RONG\n",
      "Place of Origin: (County) Kiangning; (Prefecture) Ying-tian-fu; (Province) Kiangnan.\n",
      "Status: Imperial College Student\n",
      "Age:      20\n",
      "Great-grandfather: General Jia Dai-hua, C.-in-C. Metropolitan Barracks, hereditary\n",
      "noble of the first rank.\n",
      "Grandfather:Jia Jing, Palace Graduate of the year 17—.\n",
      "Father: Hon. Colonel Jia Zhen, third rank (hereditary).\n",
      "\f",
      "After glancing through it quickly, Dai Quan handed it into the keeping of a young\n",
      "eunuch secretary at his side.\n",
      "     ‘When we get back,’ he said to the latter, ‘give this to old Zhao, the President of\n",
      "the Board of Revenue, with my compli?ments, and ask him if he would kindly make\n",
      "out a commission for a captain in the Imperial Guard, fifth rank, and also the papers\n",
      "to go with it with these particulars filled in. Tell him I’ll call round tomorrow to pay in\n",
      "the money.’\n",
      "The young eunuch bowed, and Dai Quan rose to go. Seeing that he could no longer\n",
      "detain him, Cousin Zhen showed him out as far as the main gate. As the eunuch was\n",
      "getting into his palanquin, Cousin Zhen asked him whether he should take the money\n",
      "to the Ministry or bring it round to Dai Quan’s own house.\n",
      "‘Better bring a thousand taels, standard weight, to my house. If you go to the\n",
      "Ministry, they’re sure to fleece you.’\n",
      "Cousin Zhen thanked him warmly.\n",
      "‘When the period of mourning is over,’ he said, ‘I shall bring the young fellow round\n",
      "to your house to kotow his thanks.’\n",
      "With that they parted. But no sooner had the eunuch gone than the sound of criers\n",
      "was once more heard in the street, this time heralding the arrival of the Marchioness\n",
      "of Zhong?jing, wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, with her little niece Shi\n",
      "Xing-yun. Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Wang Xi-feng received them in Cousin Zhen’s\n",

      "Offerings from the Marquises of Jin-xiang and Chuan-ning and the Earl of Shou-shan\n",
      "were now on display, and those three gentlemen were shortly to be observed\n",
      "alighting from their palanquins outside. Cousin Zhen went out to meet them and\n",
      "conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall.\n",
      "     From then on there was a continuous stream of arrivals, and throughout the\n",
      "whole forty-nine-day period the street in front of the Ning-guo mansion was\n",
      "thronged with family mourners in white and mandarins in their’ colourful robes of\n",

      "     The day after Dai Quan’s visit Cousin Zhen made Jia Rong change out of\n",
      "mourning into a court dress and go to collect his commission. The furnishings and\n",
      "insignia in the shrine were all rearranged in a manner befitting a person of the fifth\n",

      "problem, and observing the gloomy and preoccupied expression on his cousin’s face,\n",
      "\f",
      "asked him why he should still be worried now that everything had been so excellently\n",
      "taken care of. Cousin Zhen explained that it was the present lack of a responsible\n",
      "female head of household which was the cause of his concern.\n",
      "    ‘That’s no problem!’ said Bao-yu encouragingly. ‘I know just the person for this.\n",
      "Put her in temporary control here for a month, and I guarantee that you will have\n",
      "nothing further to worry about.’\n",
      "    ‘Who?’ inquired Cousin Zhen eagerly.\n",
      "    Bao-yu deemed it imprudent to mention her name out loud in the hearing of so\n",
      "many friends and relations, so leaning across he whispered it in Cousin Zhen’s ear.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen’s reaction was ecstatic.\n",
      "‘Yes, absolutely the right person!’ he cried. ‘Let’s see about it straight away!’\n",
      "     And seizing Bao-yu by the hand, he excused himself to the company and hurried\n",
      "round to the reception room in his own apartment.\n",
      "It so happened that this day was not one of the seven on which masses were said, so\n",
      "visitors from outside the family were fairly few. In the inner apartments there was\n",
      "only a hand?ful of lady visitors, all of them close connections of the Jia family, whom\n",
      "Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and various female members of the clan were\n",
      "keeping company. When a servant announced ‘The Master is here’, all these females\n",
      "jumped up with little shrieks of alarm and rushed off to hide themselves—all, that is,\n",
      "except Xi-feng, who rose slowly to her feet and imperturbably stood her ground.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen had of late been feeling far from well. The debility his sickness caused\n",
      "him had been further aggravated by excessive grief and obliged him to support\n",
      "himself with a staff. Lady Xig was concerned to see the pitiflil figure he presented as\n",
      "he entered the room.\n",
      "‘You are not well,’ she said, ‘and you have been doing too much now for days. You\n",
      "ought to be getting some rest. What do you want to come in here for?’\n",
      "Clutching his staff in his hand, Cousin Zhen struggled down on to his knees, and\n",
      "having made his duty to his aunts, began thanking them for all their trouble. Lady\n",
      "Xing hurriedly ordered Bao-yu to raise him up and commanded a chair to be moved\n",
      "forward for him to sit on. But Cousin Zhen refused to be seated.\n",
      "‘I have come to ask you three ladies a favour,’ he said, forcing his woebegone\n",
      "features into a smile.\n",
      "    ‘What is it you want?’ Lady Xing asked him.\n",
      "    ‘As you doubtless know,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘my wife has been ill in bed ever since\n",
      "our daughter-in-law’s death, and with no one to run her side of the household it has\n",
      "been getting into a pretty deplorable state. I should like to ask Cousin Feng if she\n",
      "could possibly see her way to running things here for us during the coming month. It\n",
      "would be a great relief to me if she could.’\n",
      "\f",
      "      ‘So that’s what you want!’ said Lady Xing with a smile. ‘Feng is now part of your\n",
      "Aunt Wang’s establishment. You’d better talk to her about it.’\n",
      "        ‘She’s only a child yet; you know,’ Lady Wang put in hastily. ‘What experience\n",
      "has she ever had of this kind of thing? Suppose she proved not quite up to the task.\n",
      "We should all be made to look ridiculous. I think you had better trouble someone\n",
      "else.’\n",
      "      ‘I can easily guess what is in your mind, Aunt,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘You are afraid\n",
      "we should overwork her. For I assure you there is no question of her not being a good\n",
      "enough manager. Even in her childhood games, Cousin Feng had the decisiveness of a\n",
      "little general, and since she’s married and had some experience of running things\n",
      "next door, she is a thoroughly seasoned campaigner. I’ve thought the matter over\n",
      "carefully these past few days and am quite convinced that apart from Cousin Feng\n",
      "there really isn’t anyone else I can ask. If you won’t let her do this for my sake or my\n",
      "wife’s sake, at least won’t you let her for the sake of the one who has just died?’\n",
      "And at this point he burst into tears.\n",
      "Lady Wang’s only concern had been lest Xi-feng, who had had no experience of\n",
      "large-scale funerals, might find the task too big for her and perhaps end up by\n",
      "making a fool of herself. But Cousin Zhen’s moving plea caused her attitude to soften\n",
      "considerably and she eyed Xi-feng thoughtfully as though struggling to make up her\n",
      "mind. Xi-feng for her part had always loved managing things and enjoyed showing off\n",
      "her ability to do so. When Cousin Zhen first made his request, her mind had at once\n",
      "consented; and now, observing that Lady Wang appeared to be already half\n",
      "persuaded, she hastened to complete the process.\n",
      "‘Cousin Zhen has spoken su eloquently. Oughtn’t we per?haps to agree, Aunt?’\n",
      "‘Do you think you can do it?’ Lady Wang asked her in a low aside.\n",
      "‘I don’t see why not,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Cousin Zhen has already seen to all the outside\n",
      "arrangements himself. It’s only a question of looking after the domestic side for a bit.\n",
      "And even if there is anything I don’t know about, I can always ask you.’\n",
      "This seemed reasonable enough to Lady Wang, so she said nothing. Seeing that\n",
      "Xi-feng herself appeared to be willing, Cousin Zhen turned to her with a smile.\n",
      "‘Actually there isn’t so very much to do,’ he said. ‘You really must let us persuade\n",
      "you to take this on. Let me make you a reverence now, to show my gratitude. Then,\n",
      "when this is all over, I shall come round to your place to thank you properly.’\n",
      "So saying, he clasped his hands before him and made her a formal bow. Xi-feng\n",
      "hurriedly curtseyed back.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen now ordered someone to fetch the tallies for the entire Ning-guo\n",
      "household and instructed Bao-yu to hand them to Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘I want you to manage things whatever way you like,’ he told her. ‘Anything you\n",
      "\f",
      "want you can get by using one of these. There is no need to ask me for it. I have only\n",
      "two requests to make of you. First that you should dismiss from your mind any idea\n",
      "of trying to save me any money. The important thing is to put on a good show: the\n",
      "expense doesn’t matter. And secondly that you should treat our people here exactly\n",
      "as you treat the members of your own household. Don’t be afraid of upsetting them.\n",
      "Provided that you will observe those conditions, I leave everything in your hands\n",
      "with the utmost confidence.’\n",
      "Xi-feng watched Lady Wang, not daring to accept the tallies without her approval.\n",
      "‘You hear what your cousin says,’ said Lady Wang. ‘You bad better do as he asks.\n",
      "Only do not take too much upon yourself. If there are any decisions to make, be sure\n",
      "to ask Cousin Zhen or his wife first.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had already received the tallies from Cousin Zhen and now thrust them at\n",
      "Xi-feng. For politeness’ sake she feigned a certain amount of reluctance, but was\n",
      "soon prevailed upon to accept them.\n",
      "‘Will you stay here with us,’ Cousin Zhen asked her, ‘or will you be coming over\n",
      "every day from the other house? If you intend to come over from the other house\n",
      "every day, it will greatly add to your burdens. We have an apartment here with its\n",
      "own courtyard which we can very quickly place at your disposal. If you would care to\n",
      "move in for the next week or two, I am sure we could make you comfortable.’\n",
      "‘Thank you, but it won’t be necessary,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I am needed at\n",
      "the other house too, so it will be best if I come here every day.’\n",
      "Having accomplished his mission, Cousin Zhen stayed chatting a little longer and then\n",
      "left. Presently, when the visiting ladies had dispersed, Lady Wang asked Xi-feng what\n",
      "her plans were for the rest of the day.\n",
      "‘Please go on without me, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Before I go back myself I must first\n",
      "try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail.’\n",
      "Lady Wang accordingly left without more delay in the company of Lady Xing, and the\n",
      "two ladies returned to the Rong-guo mansion, where we must now leave them.\n",
      "Alone at last, Xi-feng wandered into a sort of penthouse building where she sat down\n",
      "and tried to formulate the task that lay ahead. Five major abuses, long habitual in the\n",
      "Ning-guo establishment, presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need\n",
      "of attention, viz:\n",
      "1.Because it was so large and so motley an establishment, things were always getting\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "2.Because there was no rational division of labour, it always seemed to be someone\n",
      "else’s responsibility whenever a job needed to be done.\n",
      "      3.Because the household’s expenditure was so lavish, money was always getting\n",
      "misappropriated or misspent.\n",
      "\f",
      "        4.Because no distinctions were made between one job and another, the\n",
      "rewards and hardships were unfairly distributed,\n",
      "5.Because the servants were so arrogant and undisciplined, those with face’ could\n",
      "brook no restraint and those without could win no advancement.\n",
      "If you want to know how Xi-feng dealt with these abuses, you will have to read the\n",
      "chapter which follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 14\n",
      "\n",
      "Lin Ru-hai is conveyed to his last\n",
      "resting-place in Soochow\n",
      "And Jia Bao-yu is presented to the Prince of\n",
      "Bei-jing at a roadside halt\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lai Sheng, the Chief Steward of the Ning-guo mansion, learned that Xi-feng\n",
      "had been invited to take on the manage?ment of the household, he called his cronies\n",
      "together and addressed them in the following terms:\n",
      "‘Well lads, it seems that they’ve called in Mrs Lian from the other house to run\n",
      "things here for a bit; so if she should happen to come round asking for anything or\n",
      "have occasion to talk to you about anything, be sure to do what she says, won’t you?\n",
      "During this coming month we shall all have to start work a bit earlier and knock off a\n",
      "bit later than usual. If you’ll put up with a little extra hardship just for this month, we\n",
      "can make up for it by taking things easy when it’s over. Anyway, I’m relying on you\n",
      "not to let me down. She’s well known for a sour-faced, hard-hearted bitch is this one,\n",
      "and once she’s got her back up, she’ll give no quarter, no matter who you are. So be\n",
      "careful!’\n",
      "There was a chorus of agreement from the rest. One of them did observe,\n",
      "half-jokingly, that ‘by rights they could do with someone like her to straighten things\n",
      "up a bit, consider?ing the state they had got into’. But just at that moment Brightie’s\n",
      "wife arrived on a mission from Xi-feng. She was to take receipt of some ledger-paper,\n",
      "buckram, and book-labels, and had a tally in her hand and a slip of paper specifying\n",
      "the quantities required. The men pressed round her offering her a place to sit and a\n",
      "cup of tea to drink while one of them hurried off with the list to fetch the needed\n",
      "items. Not only that, but, having fetched them, he carried them for her all the way to\n",
      "the inner gate of the mansion, only handing them to her then so that she could take\n",
      "them in to Xi-feng by herself. Xi-feng at once ordered Sunshine to make them up into\n",
      "stout workbooks for use in the office. At the same time she sent for Lai Sheng’s wife\n",
      "and asked her for the register of the household staff. She also told her to get in touch\n",
      "\f",
      "with all the married females on the staff and arrange for them to assemble first thing\n",
      "next morning to be told their new duties. Then, after roughly checking through the\n",
      "numbers in the ‘establishment’ sheet and questioning Lai Sheng’s wife on a few\n",
      "points, she got into her carriage and drove back home.\n",
      "At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion. By this time all\n",
      "the married women on the staff had been assembled. Not daring to go in, they hung\n",
      "about outside the window listening to Xi-feng discussing work-plans with Lai Sheng’s\n",
      "wife inside the office. ‘Now that I’m in charge here’, they heard her telling the latter,\n",
      "‘I won’t promise to make myself agreeable. I haven’t got a sweet temper like your\n",
      "mistress, you know. You won’t find me letting you do everything just as it suits you.\n",
      "So don’t let me hear anyone saying \"We don’t do it that way here\"! From now on,\n",
      "whatever it is, you do it the way I tell you to, and anyone who departs by as much as\n",
      "a hair’s breadth from what I say is for it good and proper, no matter how senior or\n",
      "how important she thinks she is!’\n",
      "Having delivered herself of this formidable preliminary she ordered Sunshine to call\n",
      "the roll. One by one the women stepped into the office to be looked at. When she\n",
      "had looked at them all, Xi-feng proceeded to make her dispositions.\n",

      "\n",
      "were borne before her as she went.\n",

      "men-servants retired and Xi-feng’s own women hurried forward and raised the\n",
      "curtain of the carriage for her to descend. She did so, leaning on the shoulder of her\n",
      "maid Felicity, and the two women with the lanterns led her in, lighting the way for\n",
      "her as they went, while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the\n",
      "Ning-guo household advanced to meet her, curtseyed, and chorused their morning\n",
      "greetings. Xi-feng walked slowly through the All-scents Garden until she came to the\n",
      "shrine in the Ascension Pavilion. As soon as she caught sight of the coffin the tears,\n",
      "like pearls from a broken necklace, rolled in great drops down her cheeks. A number\n",
      "of pages were standing stiffly in the courtyard outside awaiting the command to set\n",
      "fire to the paper offerings. Xi-feng gave orders for them to begin and for tea to be\n",
      "offered up inside the shrine. At once there was a clash of cymbals followed by the\n",
      "mournful strains of a funeral band. An arm?chair had already been called for and set\n",
      "down facing the spirit tablet. In this Xi-feng now sat, and raising her voice to a shrill\n",
      "pitch, wept with abandon, whereupon the entire house?hold, high and low, male and\n",
      "female, indoors and out, res?ponded by breaking into loud and prolonged\n",
      "lamentation.\n",
      "Presently a representative of Cousin Zhen and You-shi arrived and begged Xi-feng to\n",
      "desist. Brightie’s wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with, and\n",
      "when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more took\n",
      "leave of various members of the clan who were present, and went off to her office in\n",
      "the penthouse.\n",
      "An inspection of the roster showed that all the members of her work-parties were\n",
      "present except for one woman belong?ing to the group responsible for the reception\n",
      "of friends of the family. Someone was sent to fetch her, and presently the woman\n",
      "arrived, flustered and fearful.\n",
      "‘So it is you!’ said Xi-feng with a chilling smile. I suppose you thought that because\n",
      "you have a somewhat more lady-like job than the rest, you could afford to disobey\n",
      "my orders!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Oh no, madam, indeed not!’ said the woman. ‘I’ve been coming extra early every\n",
      "day. It’s only today, because I overslept, that I’m a bit late. Please let me off this once,\n",
      "madam! It really is the first time.’\n",
      "Just at that moment Xi-feng observed Wang Xing’s wife from the Rong-guo mansion,\n",
      "peeping round the door as if looking for a chance to speak to her.\n",
      "‘Yes, what is it?’ she asked, turning away from the offender but giving her no\n",
      "indication that she might go.\n",
      "Wang Xing’s wife approached and said that she wanted a tally authorizing the\n",
      "purchase of silk cord to be made up into carriage trimmings for the funeral. She\n",
      "handed Xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written. It specified the\n",
      "number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans, four\n",
      "small sedans, and four carriages, and the number of pounds of silk cord that would\n",
      "be required for that amount of network. Xi-feng made Sunshine read it out to her,\n",
      "and having satisfied herself that the figures were correct, told him to enter them in\n",
      "his book and to issue Wang Xing’s wife with one of the Rong-guo tallies, whereupon\n",
      "the latter hurried off to complete her mission.\n",
      "Xi-feng was about to address the latecomer when four more servants from the\n",
      "Rong-guo mansion came in asking for tallies. She told them to hand over the\n",
      "order-slips and made Sunshine read them out to her. Two of them contained errors,\n",
      "and Xi-feng flung them down and told the bearers to ‘go away and come back when\n",
      "they had got their figures right’. The two of them went off crestfallen.\n",
      "     Xi-feng next observed Zhang Cai’s wife hovering about at the edge of the room\n",
      "and asked her what she wanted.\n",
      "‘It’s those carriage curtains, ma’am. We want the money for the tailor who made\n",
      "them up.’ Xi-feng took the bill and told Sunshine to enter the figures from it in his\n",
      "book. But she would not authorize Zhang Cai’s wife to pay for the tailoring until\n",
      "Wang Xing’s wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer’s receipt.\n",
      "There was a second piece of paper which Sunshine now read, requesting permission\n",
      "to purchase paper for the windows of Bao-yu’s outer study, which had just been\n",
      "redecorated. This too Xi-feng kept, and made Sunshine enter the amount in his book.\n",
      "She told Zhang Cai’s wife that the goods must be supplied first before any payment\n",
      "could be authorized.\n",
      "‘Tomorrow another one will be late and the day after that it will be someone else,’\n",
      "said Xi-feng turning to the still waiting offender, ‘and before we know where we are\n",
      "we shall have no one turning up at all. I should have liked to let you off, but if I’m\n",
      "lenient with you the first time, it will be that much harder for me to deal with\n",
      "someone else the second time; so I am obliged to make an example of you.’ Her face\n",
      "hardened as she pronounced sentence: ‘Take her out and give her twenty strokes of\n",
      "\f",
      "the bamboo!’\n",
      "Seeing that Xi-feng was really angry, the servants dared not show themselves slack in\n",
      "executing her command. The wretched woman was half-dragged from the room and\n",
      "the flogging administered in full view of the waiting throng, after which they came in\n",
      "again, the executioners to report that they had discharged their duty and their victim\n",
      "to thank Xi-feng for her punishment. Xi-feng threw down one of the Ning-guo tallies.\n",
      "‘Take this to Lai Sheng and tell him to stop a month’s pay from her wages. If anyone\n",
      "is late tomorrow they will get forty strokes and the day after that it will be sixty. So if\n",
      "you enjoy being beaten you have only to come late for roll-call. Dismiss.’\n",
      "The servants, including the shamefaced and silently weeping victim, trooped off to\n",
      "their various duties.\n",
      "Now began a steady stream of servants from both house?holds collecting and\n",
      "returning tallies, each of whom Xi-feng attended to in a brisk and efficient manner.\n",
      "From that day onwards the staff of the Ning-guo mansion realized just how\n",
      "formidable Xi-feng could be and went about their duties in fear and trembling, not\n",
      "daring to idle or delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "    But let us now turn to Bao-yu. On this particular occasion, fearing that with so\n",
      "great an influx of visitors Qin Zhong might find himself somewhat overwhelmed,\n",
      "Bao-yu brought him round to Xi-feng’s office for a quiet chat.\n",
      "‘Did you smell the food?’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. (She was halfway through her\n",
      "lunch when they entered.) ‘Come up on the kang and have some!’\n",
      "‘Thank you, but we have already eaten,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Here, or in the other house?’\n",
      "‘Catch me eating here with those clowns!’ said Bao-yu. ‘No, back at home, with\n",
      "Grandmother.’\n",
      "He and Qin Zhong sat down, and presently Xi-feng finished her lunch. Just then a\n",
      "woman came in asking for a tally with which to obtain a fresh supply of oil for the\n",
      "altar lamps.\n",
      "‘I calculated that you would be needing some by now,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I\n",
      "thought you must have forgotten. If you had forgotten, you’d have had to pay for it\n",
      "yourself. That would have suited me down to the ground!’\n",
      "‘Oh no, madam! As you say, I just forgot. I only thought of it a moment ago, and I\n",
      "realized that if I didn’t hurry I should be too late to get a tally.’\n",
      "So saying, she took her tally and went. For a short while longer the handing over of\n",
      "tallies and registering of amounts continued.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Both your houses use these tallies for everything,’ said Qin Zhong, who had been\n",
      "watching these transactions with some interest. ‘Suppose some outsider were to\n",
      "forge one and use it to get a lot of money with?’\n",
      "‘Not everyone is as crooked as you are!’ said Xi-feng good? humouredly.\n",
      "‘How is it that there is no one from our place coming in for tallies?’ Bao-yu asked.\n",
      "‘At the time when they come,’ Xi-feng replied, ‘you are still fast asleep in bed. Now\n",
      "let me ask you something. When are you going to begin studying at night?’\n",
      "‘I should like nothing better than to begin today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But what can I do if\n",
      "they won’t get on with my study?’\n",
      "If you were to ask me nicely,’ said Xi-feng jovially, ‘I think I could undertake to hurry\n",
      "them up for you.’\n",
      "‘Oh, you’re no good,’ said Bao-yu, ‘no more than any of the rest. They’ll get round\n",
      "to it in time. It’s just a question of waiting till they do.’\n",
      "‘Whether they get round to it or not,’ said Xi-feng, ‘they still need materials for the\n",
      "job, and they can’t get the materials if I don’t choose to give them the tallies—I can\n",
      "tell you that for sure!’\n",
      "As soon as he heard this, Bao-yu twined himself round Xi-feng and began coaxing and\n",
      "wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work\n",
      "on his study.\n",
      "‘Stop it! Stop it! ‘ cried Xi-feng. ‘I am so tired that my bones ache. How can I stand\n",
      "up to being mauled about by a great-ape like you? You needn’t worry. They’ve just\n",
      "been round to see about paper for the windows. It would look pretty stupid if you\n",
      "were to send them off for something they have already got.’\n",
      "Bao-yu refused to believe her until she made Sunshine look up the entry in his book\n",
      "and show it to him.\n",
      "While Bao-yu was inspecting the book, a servant announced the arrival of Shiner, one\n",
      "of the boys who had accompanied Jia Lian to Yangchow. Xi-feng eagerly ordered him\n",
      "in. Shiner louted to his mistress in the Manchu fashion and hoped that she was well.\n",
      "‘Why have you come back?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘The Master sent me, ma’am. Mr. Lin died on the third at ten in the morning and\n",
      "the Master and Miss Lin are taking him to Soochow to be buried. They expect to be\n",
      "home by the end of the spring. The Master told me to bring back the news and to\n",
      "give everyone his regards, and he said I was to ask Her Old Ladyship for instructions.\n",
      "He also told me to see if you were getting on all right, ma’am; and he said would I\n",
      "take some fur-?lined gowns back with me for winter wear.’\n",
      "‘Have you seen anyone else yet?’ Xi-feng asked him.\n",
      "‘Yes, everyone,’ said Shiner, and withdrew.\n",
      "Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu with a smile:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘It looks now as if your Cousin Lin will be staying with us permanently.’\n",
      "‘Poor thing!’ said Bao-yu. ‘How she must have cried and cried during this past week\n",
      "or so!’ The thought of her crying made him knit his brows and sigh.\n",
      "Now that Shiner was back, Xi-feng was all agog to question him about Jia Lian but\n",
      "could not do so in any detail in front of the others. She would have liked to follow\n",
      "him back home, but her duties were by no means over, and she was obliged to hold\n",
      "out until evening. Then, back in her own apartment, she summoned him to her and\n",
      "asked him for full particulars of the journey. She looked out all Jia Lian’s furs, and she\n",
      "and Patience sat up into the night getting them ready and packing them ---together\n",
      "with anything else which careful thought suggested might be needed—for Shiner to\n",
      "take back with him to his Master. Xi-feng gave Shiner minute instructions concerning\n",
      "his conduct towards the latter:\n",
      "‘Mind you look after your master properly away from home, now. Try not to make\n",
      "him angry. And do always be on at him not to drink too much. And don’t encourage\n",
      "him to get mixed up with bad women. If, when you get back, I find out that you have\n",
      "done, I’ll break your legs!’\n",
      "Shiner laughingly agreed to abide by all her instructions. By the time they got to bed\n",
      "it was well past one in the morning. To Xi-feng it seemed as though she had barely\n",
      "lain down to sleep when it was dawn once more and time to get up again and wash\n",
      "and dress for another round of duties at Ning-guo House.\n",
      "The day of the funeral was now approaching and Cousin Zhen took an expert in\n",
      "geomancy with him in his carriage and drove out to the Temple of the Iron Threshold\n",
      "to inspect the terrain and personally assist in the selection of a suitable\n",
      "rest?ing-place for Qin-shi’s coffin. He gave detailed instructions to the\n",
      "monk-in-charge, Father Sublimitas, for the provision of a completely new set of\n",
      "hangings and altar furnishings for the funeral, and for the engagement of as many\n",
      "fashionable monks as he could think of to participate in the ceremony of receiving\n",
      "the coffin.\n",
      "Sublimitas hurriedly prepared a vegetarian supper for his visitors; but Cousin Zhen\n",
      "had little heart for eating, and, as it was by now too late to return to the city,\n",
      "presently retired to a bed that had been made up for him in the monk’s quarters,\n",
      "leaving first thing next morning in order to press on with arrangements for the\n",
      "funeral. On his return he sent some work?men out to the temple to refurbish the\n",
      "place he had chosen for the coffin. They were instructed to work on the job\n",
      "through?out the night in order to make sure that it was finished in time. He also sent\n",
      "out a number of kitchen staff to cater for the funeral party on its arrival.\n",
      "Xi-feng, too, began to make her own careful preparations as the day of the funeral\n",
      "drew near. On the one hand she had to select coachmen and bearers from the\n",
      "\f",
      "Rong-guo staff for the carriages and sedans that Lady Wang and the other Rong-guo\n",
      "ladies would ride in in the procession. On the other hand, as she fully intended to\n",
      "take part in it herself, she had to find herself somewhere to stop at on the way as\n",
      "well as accommodation for the night after the funeral.\n",
      "The Dowager-duchess of Shan-guo happened to die just about this time and Xi-feng\n",
      "had to make the arrangements for Lady Xing and Lady Wang when they paid their\n",
      "visits of condolence and later when they attended the funeral. She had to see about\n",
      "birthday presents for the Princess of Xi-an. She had to write to her parents and get\n",
      "things ready to send to them when her elder brother Wang Ren returned with his\n",

      "a quite jolly, un?conventional sort of person who refused to let either his royal birth\n",
      "or the conventions of official life constrain him. He had often wanted to meet him,\n",
      "but had been deterred by his father’s strictness from doing so. And now here was the\n",
      "Prince of Bei-jing asking to see him! A feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he\n",
      "hurried forward with his father. He peeped up at the prince as they advanced and\n",
      "saw that he was, as report had painted him, an extremely good-looking young man.\n",

      "with green jade. The splendid costume, the luminous eyes, the finely chiselled\n",
      "features really did make him an arrestingly handsome young man. Bao-yu started\n",
      "forward impulsively to make his salutation, but the prince extended an arm from the\n",

      "     The prince pronounced the stone a great wonder and with his own hands\n",
      "refastened its plaited silken cord round Bao-yu’s neck. Then, taking one of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "hands in his own, he asked him how old he was, what books he was studying, and\n",
      "other such questions, to all of which Bao-yu gave prompt replies.\n",
      "     Delighted that everything Bao-yu said was so clear and to the point, the prince\n",

      "horseback.\n",
      "Xi-feng was worried about Bao-yu. Out in the country, she thought, he was liable to\n",

      "one of her pages to summon him, and presently he rode up to her carriage.\n",
      "‘Bao dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘a person of your refinement belongs here with us. You\n",

      "horrid men! Why not get in with me? The two of us will keep each other company.’\n",

      "and Lady Wang for instructions. The latter sent back word that they had no desire to\n",
      "stop, themselves, but that Xi-feng was wel?come to do so if she wished. Xi-feng\n",
      "accordingly gave orders for a short halt. At once the pages led the horses out of the\n",

      "Bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetch Qin Zhong, who was riding along behind\n",

      "single large room, so that there was nowhere the farmer’s womenfolk could go to be\n",
      "out of the way of the visitors. The sudden appearance in their midst of Xi-feng,\n",
      "Bao-yu and Qin Zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed\n",
      "to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one.\n",
      "As soon as they were inside the thatched central building, Xi-feng asked the boys to\n",
      "amuse themselves outside. Bao-yu realized that she needed to be alone, and\n",
      "conducted Qin Zhong and the pages on a tour of the farmyard. He had never in his\n",
      "life seen any of the farming implements before, and was very curious. One of his\n",
      "pages who had some experience of country matters was able to name each\n",
      "implement for him and explain its functions. Bao-yu was impressed.\n",
      "‘Now I can understand the words of the old poet,’ he said:\n",

      "Bao-yu at once got up on the kang and had just started to turn it when a country lass\n",
      "of seventeen or eighteen summers came running up:\n",
      "‘Don’t! You’ll spoil it!’\n",
      "She was shouted at fiercely by the pages, but Bao-yu had already stayed his hand.\n",
      "‘I’m sorry. I’ve never seen one before. I was just turning it for fun, to see how it\n",
      "works.’\n",
      "‘You don’t know how to turn it properly,’ said the girl. Let me show you how ‘tis\n",
      "done.’\n",

      "‘A comely damosel, thinkest thou nottest?’\n",
      "‘Shut up, or I’ll clout you!’ said Bao-yu, pushing him.\n",
      "During this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning. She did, indeed, make a\n",
      "charming picture as she bent over her work. Suddenly an old woman’s voice called\n",
      "out from the other side of the yard:\n",
      "‘Ertie! Come here at once my gal.’\n",
      "The girl jumped up from her spinning and hurried over. Bao-yu’s spirits were quite\n",
      "dashed by her abrupt departure.\n",
      "But just then someone came from Xi-feng inviting the boys indoors. They found her\n",
      "washed and changed. She asked them if they wanted to ‘change’ too, but Bao-yu\n",
      "replied that they did not. Then a variety of cakes and sweets were brought in by the\n",
      "\f",
      "servants, and fragrant tea was poured for them to drink. When the three had taken\n",
      "their fill of these refreshments and everything had been cleared away and re?packed\n",
      "by the servants, they rose up and got back into their carriage.\n",
      "Outside in the yard Brightie handed the farmer’s family their payment, which he had\n",
      "brought with him ready-wrapped in coloured paper, and the womenfolk hurried up\n",
      "to the carriage to express their thanks. Bao-yu scanned their faces carefully, but could\n",
      "not see his spinning-girl amongst them. They had not driven far, however, when he\n",
      "caught sight of her at the end of the village. She was standing watching for him\n",
      "beside the road, a baby brother in her arms and two little girls at her side. Bao-yu\n",
      "could not repress a strong emotion on seeing her, but sitting there in the carriage\n",
      "there was not much he could do but gaze back at her soulfully; and soon, as the\n",
      "carriage bowled along at a smarter pace, Ertie was lost to sight for ever.\n",
      "With talk and laughter to beguile them, the journey passed quickly. Soon they had\n",
      "caught up with the main procession; soon the sound of drums and cymbals was\n",
      "heard and they could see ahead of them the banners and umbrellas of the monks\n",
      "from the Temple of the Iron Threshold who had come out in procession and lined\n",
      "either side of the road to welcome them; and soon they were inside the temple,\n",
      "where further ceremonies awaited them, a new staging having been erected for this\n",

      "them had gone.\n",
      "Xi-feng received the lady guests inside. They, too, left in order of precedence and had\n",
      "not finally dispersed until around two o’clock. Only members of the clan and a few\n",
      "very close friends stayed behind to see the ceremonies through to their conclusion\n",
      "two days later.\n",
      "Lady Xing and Lady Wang were among those who left. They could see that Xi-feng\n",
      "would be unable to return that day and wanted to take Bao-yu back with them into\n",
      "town. But Bao-yu, after his first taste of the countryside, was extremely loth to return\n",
      "and begged to stay with Xi-feng; so Lady Wang went without him, leaving him in\n",
      "Xi-feng’s charge.\n",
      "The Temple of the Iron Threshold was a private foundation of the Dukes of Ning-guo\n",
      "and Rong-guo which still had some land of its own in which members of the clan who\n",
      "died in the capital could be given temporary burial. The thoughtful Dukes had\n",
      "\f",
      "provided accommodation not only for the dead but also for the living, in the form of\n",
      "guest-rooms in which mourners might temporarily reside until their funereal\n",
      "busi?ness was over What the old gentlemen had not foreseen was that their\n",
      "multitudinous progeny would come in time to exhibit differences of wealth and\n",
      "temperament so extreme as often to render their possessors mutually intolerable\n",
      "and that, whereas the more hard-up members of the clan gladly occupied the\n",
      "accommodation provided, the more affluent or preten?tious found it ‘inconvenient’\n",
      "to stay there and preferred to seek alternative accommodation in the farmsteads and\n",
      "convents round about.\n",
      "Xi-feng was among those who found the Iron Threshold accommodation\n",
      "‘inconvenient’. Some time previously she had sent someone to Wheat-cake Priory to\n",
      "make arrangements on her behalf with the prioress Euergesia, and the old nun had\n",
      "turned out several rooms in readiness for her arrival. ‘Wheat-cake Priory’ (so-called\n",
      "because of the excellent steamed wheat bread made in its kitchens) was the popular\n",
      "name for Water-moon Priory, an offshoot of Water-moon Abbey situated at no great\n",
      "distance from the Temple of the Iron Threshold.\n",
      "Presently, when the monks had finished their service and the evening offering of tea\n",
      "had been made, Cousin Zhen sent Jia Rong in to Xi-feng with a message inviting her\n",
      "to retire. Having first glanced round to ascertain that a sufficient number of Jia ladies\n",
      "were present to look after the still remaining guests, Xi-feng bade the company good\n",
      "night and left for Wheat-cake Priory with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had\n",
      "attached himself to the other two when his father Qin Bang-ye, unable by reason of\n",
      "his age and frail state of health to risk a night away from home, had gone back to the\n",
      "city, leav?ing him to await the conclusion of the requiem services on his own.\n",
      "They soon arrived at the priory and were met by Euergesia, who had brought her two\n",
      "little disciples Benevolentia and Sapientia to welcome them. As soon as the first\n",
      "greetings were over, Xi-feng retired to her room to wash and change. Emerg?ing\n",
      "refreshed, she observed how much taller Sapientia had grown and how radiantly\n",
      "good-looking, and inquired of Euergesia why she and her two charges had lately not\n",
      "been into town to see them.\n",
      "‘It is on account of Mr. Hu’s good lady,’ said the old nun. ‘She has lately been\n",
      "brought to bed of a boy, and sent us ten taels of silver for a three-day recital of the\n",
      "Lake of Blood sutra by some of the sisters to purge the stain of childbirth. We have\n",
      "been so busy with the arrangements that we haven’t had time to call.’\n",
      "Let us leave Xi-feng in conversation with the prioress and turn to the other two.\n",
      "Qin Zhong and Bao-yu were amusing themselves in the main hall of the priory when\n",

      "\f",
      "‘Well, what about it?’ said Qin Zhong.\n",
      "‘Now, now, stop play-acting!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I saw you holding her that day at\n",
      "Grandma’s when you thought nobody else was about. You needn’t think you can fool\n",
      "me after that!’\n",
      "‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’\n",
      "‘All right then. Never mind whether you know what I’m talking about or not. Just\n",
      "ask her to pour me out a cup of tea, will you, and then we’ll let the subject drop.’\n",
      "‘What sort of joke is this? Why can’t you ask her yourself? She’d pour it out just the\n",
      "same for you. Why ask me to tell her?’\n",
      "‘I couldn’t do it with the same feeling as you. There’ll be much more feeling in it if\n",
      "you ask her.’\n",
      "He finally prevailed upon Qin Zhong to make the request.\n",
      "‘Oh, all right! - Sappy, pour us a cup of tea, will you?’\n",
      "Sapientia had been a regular visitor at the Rong-guo mansion ever since she was a\n",
      "little girl and was familiar with all its inmates. The innocence of her childish rompings\n",
      "with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong had latterly, however—now that she had reached\n",
      "adolescence—given way to a more mature emotion. She had fallen in love with Qin\n",
      "Zhong, whose every feature and lineament now inspired her with romantic feelings;\n",
      "and Qin Zhong, captivated by her developing charms, had responded by loving her\n",
      "back. Although nothing serious had as yet passed between them, in their inclinations\n",
      "and affections they were already united.\n",
      "Sapientia hurried out and returned with a cup of tea.\n",
      "‘Give it to me, Sappy!’ said Qin Zhong.\n",
      "‘No, give it to me, Sappy I’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "She stood between them, pouting prettily, and gave a little laugh:\n",
      "‘Surely you’re not going to fight over a cup of tea? I must have honey on my hands\n",
      "I’\n",
      "Bao-yu snatched the cup before Qin Zhong could do so and began drinking. He was\n",
      "about to say something when Benevo?lentia came in and fetched Sapientia away to\n",
      "help her lay the table. She was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and\n",
      "cakes; but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts, and after\n",
      "sitting a short while for the sake of politeness, were soon off to amuse themselves\n",
      "else?where.\n",
      "Xi-feng, too, soon left, and retired to her private room to rest, Euergesia\n",
      "accompanying her. By this time the older servants, seeing that there was nothing\n",
      "further for them to do, had one by one drifted off to bed, leaving only a few personal\n",
      "maids, all of whom were in Xi-feng’s confidence, in attend?ance. The old nun\n",
      "deemed it safe to broach a private matter in their hearing.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There is something I have been meaning to call at your house and ask Her Ladyship\n",
      "about, but I should like to have your opinion on it first before I see her.’\n",
      "‘What do you want to ask her?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Bless his Holy Name!’ the prioress began piously. ‘When I was a nun at the\n",
      "Treasures in Heaven Convent in Chang-an, one of the convent’s benefactors was a\n",
      "very wealthy man called Zhang, who had a daughter called Jin-ge. A certain young Mr.\n",
      "Li, who is brother-in-law to the Governor of Chang-an, met her once when she was\n",
      "making an incense? offering in our temple and took a violent liking to her. He at once\n",
      "sent someone to the parents to ask for her hand in marriage, but unfortunately she\n",
      "was already betrothed to the son of a captain in the Chang-an garrison and the\n",
      "betrothal-presents had already been accepted. The Zhangs would have liked to\n",
      "cancel the betrothal but were afraid that the captain would object, so they told Li’s\n",
      "matchmaker that the girl was already engaged. But oh dear! young Mr. Li wouldn’t\n",
      "take no for an answer, and the Zhangs were quite at their wit’s end, being now in\n",
      "trouble with both parties. You see, when the captain got to hear of these goings-on\n",
      "he was most unreason?able. He came rushing along in a great rage and made a most\n",
      "terrible scene. ‘Just how many young men is this girl be?trothed to?” he said, and so\n",
      "on and so forth. He refused out?fight to take back the betrothal-gifts and straightway\n",
      "began an action for breach of promise. By now the Zhangs were really upset and sent\n",
      "to the capital for some moral support -- for they are now quite determined to break\n",
      "off their daughter’s en?gagement, seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable.\n",
      "‘Well, it occurred to me that the Area Commander for Chang-an, General Yun, is on\n",
      "very good terms with your husband’s family, and I thought I might try to find some\n",
      "way of persuading Her Ladyship to talk to Sir Zheng about this and get him to write a\n",
      "letter to General Yun and ask him to have a word with this captain. It is hardly likely\n",
      "that he would refuse to obey his commanding officer. The Zhangs would gladly pay\n",
      "anything—even if it meant bankrupting themselves ---in return for this kindness.’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘It doesn’t sound very difficult. The only difficulty is that Lady Wang doesn’t touch\n",
      "this kind of thing any more.’\n",
      "‘If Her Ladyship won’t, what about you, Mrs Lian?’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed again.\n",
      "‘I’m not short of money; and besides, I don’t touch that sort of thing either.’\n",
      "Euergesia’s face assumed an expression of great benignity. After sitting for a while in\n",
      "silence she sighed.\n",
      "‘It’s a pity I let the Zhangs know that I was going to talk to you about this,’ she said.\n",
      "‘Now if you don’t do this favour for them, they will never believe that it is because\n",
      "you haven’t the time or don’t want the money; they will take it as a sign that you are\n",
      "\f",
      "not able.’\n",
      "This put Xi-feng on her mettle.\n",
      "‘You’ve known me a long time,’ she said. ‘You know that I’ve never believed all that\n",
      "talk about hell and damnation. If I decide that I want to do something I do it, no\n",
      "matter what it is. Tell them that if they are prepared to pay out three thousand taels\n",
      "of silver, I will undertake to relieve them of their trouble.’\n",
      "The prioress was delighted.\n",
      "‘They will! They will! No doubt about it!’\n",
      "‘Mind you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’m not one of your money-grubbing run-of-the-mill\n",
      "go-betweens. I’m not doing this for the money. Every bit of this three thousand taels\n",
      "will go into the pockets of my boys or towards their expenses. I shan’t touch a penny\n",
      "of it. If it was money I wanted, I could lay my hands on thirty thousand taels at this\n",
      "very moment.’\n",
      "‘Well, that’s nicely settled!’ said the prioress. ‘So can we lo6k forward to your kind\n",
      "help in this matter tomorrow? We may as well get it over and done with.’\n",
      "‘You can see how busy I am and how impossible it is for me to get away,’ said\n",
      "Xi-feng. ‘I’ve told you I’ll do it, and so I will -- in my own time. Surely that is enough\n",
      "for you?’\n",
      "‘A little thing like this might seem a great deal of trouble to some people;’ said the\n",
      "old nun artfully, ‘but even if it involved more than it does, it would still be nothing to\n",
      "a capable person like you, Mrs Lian. You know what they say: “The able man gets\n",
      "little leisure” that’s why Her Ladyship leaves everything to you. She knows how\n",
      "capable you are. Of course, you have to be careful that you don’t overtax yourself.\n",
      "Your health is precious!’\n",
      "Soothed by such flatteries, Xi-feng forgot her weariness, and the conversation\n",
      "continued with animation.\n",
      "Meanwhile Qin Zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that there\n",
      "was no one much about to prosecute his designs on Sapientia. He found her on her\n",
      "own in one of the rooms at the back of the priory washing up tea-things. Throwing\n",
      "his arms around her from behind, he gave her a kiss. Sapientia stamped with\n",
      "vexation:\n",
      "‘What are you doing? Stop it!’\n",
      "She was about to call out, but Qin Zhong spoke entreat?ingly:\n",
      "‘Darling Sappy! I want you so desperately! If you won’t let me, I’ll just lie down and\n",
      "die!’\n",
      "‘If you want me,’ said Sapientia, ‘you must first get me out of this hole and away\n",
      "from these people. Then you can do what you like.’\n",
      "‘That’s easy,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘But “distant water is no cure for a present thirst” ...’\n",
      "\f",
      "And with that he blew out the light, plunging the room into inky darkness, and\n",
      "carried Sapientia on to the kang. She struggled hard to get up—though still not\n",
      "daring to call out; but soon, almost before she knew it, her breech-clout was off and\n",
      "the ship was in the harbour.\n",
      "Suddenly, in less time than it takes to tell, a third person bore down on them from\n",
      "above and held them fast. The intruder made no sound, and for some moments the\n",
      "other two lay underneath his weight, half dead with fright. Then there was a splutter\n",
      "of suppressed laughter and they knew that it was Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ said Qin Zhong crossly, as he scrambled to\n",
      "his feet.\n",
      "‘If you won’t let me, darling,’ Bao-yu mimicked, ‘I’ll call Out!’\n",
      "Poor Sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark.\n",
      "Bao-yu hauled Qin Zhong from the room.\n",
      "‘Now,’ he said: ‘are you still going to pretend that Sappy means nothing to you?’\n",
      "‘Look, be a good chap! I’ll do anything you say as long as you promise not to shout.’\n",
      "‘We won’t say any more about it just now,’ said Bao-yu genially. ‘Wait until we are\n",
      "both in bed and I’ll settle accounts with you then.’\n",
      "Bedtime soon came and they partially undressed and settled down for the night,\n",
      "Xi-feng in an inner room and Bao-yu and Qin Zhong in an outer room adjoining it. As\n",
      "there were numerous old women on night duty lying about everywhere on the floor\n",
      "wrapped up in their bedding, Xi-feng was afraid that the ‘Magic Jade’ might\n",
      "disappear in the course of the night; so as soon as Bao-yu was in bed she sent\n",
      "someone to fetch it from him, and put it under her own pillow for safety.\n",
      "As for the ‘settling of accounts’ that Bao-yu had proposed to Qin Zhong, we have\n",
      "been unable to ascertain exactly what form this took; and as we would not for the\n",
      "world be guilty of a fabrication, we must allow the matter to remain a mystery.\n",
      "Next day someone arrived from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to see how Bao-yu\n",
      "was getting on. He was coun?selled to dress up well against the cold and to come\n",
      "back home if there was nothing further to do. Bao-yu was most unwilling to return\n",
      "on his own account, and his unwillingness was re?inforced by the promptings of Qin\n",
      "Zhong, who was anxious to see more of Sapientia and urged him to ask Xi-feng for\n",
      "another day.\n",
      "Xi-feng reflected a little. The main business of the funeral was now over, but a\n",
      "sufficient number of minor matters still remained to be done to justify their staying\n",
      "on another day if they wanted to. Three arguments in favour of staying presented\n",
      "themselves to her mind:\n",
      "1.It would be a gesture of considerateness to Cousin Zhen which would increase his\n",
      "indebtedness to her.\n",
      "\f",
      "     2.It would give her a breathing-space in which to get Euergesia’s business\n",
      "attended to.\n",
      "3.It would make Bao-yu happy, which would put her in good odour with\n",
      "Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "Having now made her mind up, Xi-feng acceded to Bao-yu’s request in the following\n",
      "terms:\n",
      "‘My own business here is all finished now, but if you want to amuse yourselves a bit\n",
      "longer, I suppose I must resign myself to staying. However, we definitely must go back\n",
      "tomorrow.’\n",
      "When Bao-yu heard this it was all ‘dearest Feng’ this and ‘darling Feng’ that, and he\n",
      "promised faithfully to return on the morrow without demur. Accordingly it was\n",
      "settled that they should stay for one more night.\n",
      "Xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain Euergesia’s business to\n",
      "Brightie. Brightie grasped the situation at once, hurried into town, sought out a\n",
      "public letter-writer, had a letter written in Jia Lian’s name to the captain’s\n",
      "commanding officer, and set off for Chang-an over?night bearing the spurious\n",
      "missive with him.\n",
      "     Chang-an is only thirty or 50 miles from the capital, so that Brightie could finish\n",
      "his business and be back again within a couple of days. The general’s name was Yun\n",
      "Guang. He was indebted to the Jia family for a number of past kindnesses and was\n",
      "only too ‘pleased to be of service to them in a matter of such trifling importance. He\n",
      "said as much in the letter of reply which he gave Brightie to carry back with him. But\n",
      "that part of his mission is omitted from our story.\n",
      "When their second day at the priory was over, Xi-feng and the boys took leave of\n",
      "Euergesia, and as she said good-bye, Xi-feng told the prioress to call at the Rong-guo\n",
      "mansion m two days’ time to hear the news from Chang-an.\n",
      "This parting was an unbearably painful one for Sapientia and Qin Zhong, and all sorts\n",
      "of secret vows were exchanged and whispered contracts made before they could tear\n",
      "them?selves apart. We omit all details of that harrowing scene.\n",
      "Xi-feng called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on the way back to see that\n",
      "everything was in order. jewel, it seemed, refused absolutely to go back home, and\n",

      "indulgence in secret frolic with Sapientia had resulted on his return in a cough and\n",
      "chill accompanied by total loss of appetite. Altogether he presented so sorry a\n",
      "spectacle that study was quite out of the question and they were obliged to send him\n",
      "back home to bed. Although Bao-yu was very dis?appointed, there was nothing at all\n",
      "he could do but wait for his friend to get better.\n",
      "Xi-feng had now received Yun Guang’s reply to the bogus letter, expressing his\n",

      "foot of the main hall. There, with beaming countenance, he got down from his horse,\n",
      "climbed the steps, faced south and gave utterance to the following announcement:\n",
      "‘By order of His Imperial Majesty:\n",
      "Jia Zheng is commanded to present himself at court im?mediately for private\n",
      "audience with His Imperial Majesty in the Hall of Reverence.’\n",
      "Having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for\n",
      "so much as a cup of tea and rode away. Still no wiser, Jia Zheng hurried into his court\n",
      "dress and hastened to the Palace, leaving Grandmother Jia and the rest in an extreme\n",
      "state of alarm which they endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to allay by dispatching a\n",
      "regular stream of mounted couriers post-haste to the Palace to inquire for news.\n",
      "About four hours later Lai Da, the Chief Steward of the Rong-guo mansion, and three\n",
      "or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out\n",
      "congratulations.\n",
      "‘Master’s orders,’ said Lai Da between breaths: ‘will Her Old Ladyship please bring\n",
      "Their Ladyships to the Palace to give thanks to His Majesty for the great favour he has\n",
      "\f",
      "shown us!’\n",
      "Unable in her agitated state to remain indoors, Grandmother Jia had been waiting\n",
      "outside in the loggia, whither the others --Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi, Li Wan,\n",
      "Xi-feng, Aunt Xue and the girls -- had also congregated to await news of Jia Zheng.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia called Lai Da inside to explain his cryptic message in somewhat\n",
      "greater detail.\n",
      "‘We servants were all waiting in an anteroom,’ Lai Da told her, ‘and we had no idea\n",
      "what was going on inside. Eventually Mr. Xia came out and saw us waiting there.\n",
      "“Congratulations!” he said. “Your eldest young lady has been appointed Chief\n",
      "Secretary to the Empress and is to become an Imperial Concubine.” Then after that\n",
      "Master came out, too, and told us the same thing. “I have to go off to the East Palace\n",
      "now,” he said, “to see the Prince. But you must hasten back as quick as you can and\n",
      "tell Their Ladyships to come to the Palace and give thanks.”‘\n",
      "Lai’s Da information at once dispelled the anxiety that Grandmother Jia and the\n",
      "others had all this time been feeling, and the worried looks on their faces quickly\n",
      "gave way to smiles of pleasure. Now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed\n",
      "herself in the costume appropriate to her rank. Then off they went to the Palace in\n",
      "four sedans one behind the other: Grand?mother Jia’s at the head, then Lady Xing’s,\n",
      "then Lady Wang’s, and then You-shi’s. Jia She and Cousin Zhen also changed into\n",
      "court dress, and taking Jia Rong and Jia Qiang with them, accompanied Grandmother\n",
      "Jia to the Palace as her male escort.\n",
      "There was one person who did not share the unbounded delight now general among\n",
      "the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households—who behaved, indeed,\n",
      "almost as if he had not heard the news at all. This person was Bao-yu. What was the\n",
      "reason for his unsociable lack of enthusiasm on this occasion?\n",
      "A short time previously the little nun Sapientia had ab?sconded from Water-moon\n",
      "Priory and made her way into the city to look for Qin Zhong. Qin Bang-ye had\n",
      "discovered her, driven her from the house, and given Qin Zhong a beating. The shock\n",
      "and anger of the discovery had brought on an attack of the illness from which the old\n",
      "gentleman was a chronic sufferer, and within only four or five days he had breathed\n",
      "his last. Qin Zhong had always been of a weak and nervous disposition and had still\n",
      "not fully recovered from his sickness when these events occurred. The severe beating\n",
      "followed by the overwhelming grief and remorse attendant on the death of his father\n",
      "from anger which he had himself provoked led to serious complications in his illness.\n",
      "This, then, was the reason for Bao-yu’s unseasonable melancholy—a melancholy\n",
      "which the news of his sister Yuan?-chun’s dazzling promotion was powerless to dispel.\n",
      "Grand?mother Jia’s visit to the Palace to give thanks, her return home, the visits of\n",
      "friends and relations to congratulate the family, the unwontedly cheerful bustle of\n",
      "\f",
      "the Ning and Rong households during the days that followed, the general\n",
      "satisfac?tion that everyone in those households now seemed to feel—as far as\n",
      "Bao-yu was concerned these things might just as well not have been: he viewed them\n",
      "with the eyes of an outsider. The rest of the family merely laughed at him, seeing in\n",
      "this be?haviour only further confirmation of their belief that he was ‘a bit touched’.\n",
      "But then there was Jia Lian’s and Dai-yu’s homecoming to look forward to. The\n",
      "advent of the messenger sent on ahead to announce that they would be arriving next\n",
      "day produced the first glimmer of cheerfulness that Bao-yu had so far shown. On\n",
      "being questioned for further details the messenger told them that Jia Yu-cun was also\n",
      "returning to the capital to have an audience with the Emperor. This was the doing of\n",
      "Wang Zi-teng, who had recommended him in a report to the throne for promotion to\n",
      "a metropolitan post. As he was both a cousin (albeit a remote one) of. Jia Lian and\n",
      "also Dai-yu’s former teacher, it had been resolved that he should travel with them.\n",
      "Lin Ru-hai having been laid with his ancestors in the family burying-ground and his\n",
      "obsequies duly concluded, they would, if they had proceeded to the capital by the\n",
      "usual stages, have been arriving back some time in the following month; but when Jia\n",
      "Lian heard the news about Yuan-chun’s elevation, they had decided to make greater\n",
      "speed, travelling by night as well as by day. The journey had been smooth and\n",
      "uneventful.\n",
      "Bao-yu merely asked if Dai-yu was all right, and on being assured that she was, paid\n",
      "no further attention to the man’s news.\n",
      "Having waited with great impatience until the early afternoon of the following day,\n",
      "Bao-yu and the rest were rewarded with the announcement ‘Mr Lian and Miss Lin\n",
      "have just arrived!’ The joy of their reunion was, however, tempered with grief,\n",
      "because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting, and for a while\n",
      "there was much loud weeping on either side. Then there were words of comfort and\n",
      "congratula?tion to exchange and Bao-yu had an opportunity of studying Dai-yu more\n",
      "carefully. He recognized the same ethereal quality he had always known in her, but it\n",
      "seemed to have deepened and intensified during her absence.\n",
      "She had brought a lot of books back with her and was soon busy superintending the\n",
      "sweeping out of her bedroom to accommodate them and arranging various objets\n",
      "d’art around it which had also formed part of her luggage. She had salvaged some\n",
      "paper, writing-brushes and other articles of stationery from her old home which she\n",
      "distributed as presents to Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Bao-yu and the rest. Bao-yu for his\n",
      "part hunted up the rosary of fragrant Indian beads given him by the Prince of Bei-jing\n",
      "and offered it as a gift to Dai-yu; but she flung it back at him disdainfully:\n",
      "‘What, carry a thing that some coarse man has pawed over? I don’t want it!’\n",
      "So Bao-yu was compelled to take it back again.\n",
      "\f",
      "But let us now turn to Jia Lian.\n",
      "When he had finished seeing everyone in the family, Jia Lian returned at last to his\n",
      "own apartment. Xi-feng, though still so busy that she had not a moment’s leisure,\n",
      "had somehow contrived to find time to welcome back her wandering lord.\n",
      "‘Congratulations, Imperial Kinsman!’ she said with a smile when, except for the\n",
      "servants, they were at last alone together. ‘You have had a tiring journey, Imperial\n",
      "Kinsman. Yesterday when the courier gave notice of your arrival, I prepared a humble\n",
      "entertainment to celebrate your homecoming. Will the Imperial Kinsman graciously\n",
      "condescend to take a cup of wine with his handmaid?’\n",
      "Jia Lian replied in the same vein:\n",
      "‘Madam, you are too kind! I am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant,\n",
      "ma’am!’\n",
      "As they joked together, Patience and the other maids came forward to welcome their\n",
      "Master back, after which they served them both with tea. Jia Lian asked Xi-feng\n",
      "about the events that had occurred during his absence and thanked her for looking\n",
      "after things so well while he was away.\n",
      "‘I am not much of a manager really,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t got the knowledge, and\n",
      "I’m too poor at expressing myself and too simple-minded --- always inclined to “take\n",
      "a ramrod for a needle”, as they say. Besides, I’m too soft-hearted for the job. Anyone\n",
      "who says a few kind words can get the better of me. And my lack of experience\n",
      "makes me so nervous. Aunt Wang only had to be the slightest bit displeased and I\n",
      "would get so upset that I couldn’t sleep at night. I begged her not to make me do all\n",
      "these things, but she insisted. She said I only refused out of laziness and\n",
      "unwillingness to learn. I don’t think she realizes even now the state I have been in—\n",
      "too seated to move or even to open my mouth for fear of saying or doing something\n",
      "wrong. And you know what a difficult lot those old stewardesses are. The tiniest\n",
      "mistake and they are all laughing at you and making fun; the tiniest hint of\n",
      "favouritism and they are grumbling and complaining. You know their way of “cursing\n",
      "the oak-tree when they mean the ash”. Those old women know just how to sit on the\n",
      "mountain-top and watch the tigers fight; how to murder with a borrowed knife, or\n",
      "help the wind to fan the fire. They will look on safely from the bank while you are\n",
      "drowning in the river. And the fallen oil-bottle can drain away: they are not going to\n",
      "pick it up. On top of that, as I am so young, I haven’t got much authority over them;\n",
      "so it was all I could do to prevent them from ignoring me altogether. And to crown it\n",
      "all, when Rong’s wife died Cousin Zhen kept coming round to see Aunt Wang and\n",
      "begging her on his knees to let me help out for a day or two next door. I said again\n",
      "and again that I couldn’t do it; but Aunt Wang agreed just to please him, so there was\n",
      "nothing for it but to do as I was told. I’m afraid I made a terrible mess of it—even\n",
      "\f",
      "worse than I did here. And now it seems Cousin Zhen is beginning to grumble and\n",
      "says he wishes he had never asked me. When you see him tomorrow, do please try to\n",
      "make it up with him. Tell him it’s because I’m young and inexperienced. You might\n",
      "even hint that it’s his own fault for having asked me in the first place!’\n",
      "While she was saying this there was a sound of talking in the next room.\n",
      "‘Who is it?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "Patience came in to reply.\n",
      "‘Mrs. Xue sent Caltrop over to ask me about something. I’ve already given her an\n",
      "answer and sent her back.’\n",
      "‘Ah yes!’ said Jia Lian, apparently pleased by the recollec?tion. ‘When I went to call\n",
      "on Aunt Xue just now to tell her I was back, I ran into such a pretty young woman! I\n",
      "couldn’t place her as any of the girls in our household, so in the course of\n",
      "conversation I asked Aunt Xue who she was. It seems that she’s the little maid they\n",
      "had that lawsuit about. Cal—something. Caltrop. She’s finally been given as\n",
      "“chamber-wife” to that idiot Xue, Now that she has been plucked and painted like a\n",
      "grown-up woman she really does look most attractive! What a waste to throw away a\n",
      "beautiful girl on that great booby!’\n",
      "Xi-feng made a little moue.\n",
      "‘I should have thought that having just got back from Hangchow and Soochow and\n",
      "seen something of the world, you would have settled down a bit; but I see you are\n",
      "still the same greedy-guts as ever. Well, if you want her, there’s nothing simpler: I’ll\n",
      "exchange our Patience for her. You know what Cousin Xue is like: always “one eye on\n",
      "the dish and the other on the saucepan”. Throughout the whole of this last year\n",
      "there have been I don’t know how many alarms and excursions between him and\n",
      "poor Aunt Xue because she wouldn’t let him get his hands on Caltrop. It wasn’t just\n",
      "her looks that made her concerned for the girl. Everything about her is so unusual.\n",
      "She is so gentle and so quiet. Even among our own young ladies there is scarcely her\n",
      "equal. In the end Aunt Xue decided that if she couldn’t stop him having her, at least\n",
      "she could make sure that the thing was done properly, with a party and invitations\n",
      "and all the rest of it. So that’s what she did, and made her his chamber wife. But\n",
      "would you believe it, before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost\n",
      "interest. . .!’\n",
      "She was interrupted by an announcement from one of the pages on the inner gate:\n",
      "‘Mr Zhen wants you, sir. He’s waiting for you in the larger study.’\n",
      "At once jia Lian did up his gown and hurried out.\n",
      "‘What on earth did Mrs. Xue want, sending Caltrop here like that?’ Xi-feng asked\n",
      "Patience as soon as he had gone.\n",
      "‘It wasn’t Caltrop!’ said Patience. ‘I had to make something up and hers was the\n",
      "\f",
      "first name that came to mind. That wife of Brightie’s is such a stupid woman! Just\n",
      "imagine’—she drew closer to Xi-feng’s ear and lowered her voice—‘of all the times\n",
      "she could have chosen to bring you the interest on that money, she had to pick on\n",
      "the very moment when the Master has just got home! It’s lucky I was in the outside\n",
      "room when she came, otherwise she might have come blundering in here and\n",
      "Master would have heard her message. And we all know what Master is like where\n",
      "money is concerned: he’d spend the fat in the frying-pan if he could get it out! Once\n",
      "he found out that you had savings, he’d pluck up courage to spend them in no time.\n",
      "Anyway, I took the money from her quickly and gave her a piece of my mind -- which\n",
      "I am afraid you must have heard. That’s why I had to say what I did. I’d never have\n",
      "men?tioned Caltrop in the Master’s presence otherwise!’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘I was going to say! Why, for no apparent reason, should Mrs. Xue choose a\n",
      "chamber-wife to send here the moment Master gets back? So it was you up to your\n",
      "tricks, you little monkey!’\n",
      "At this point Jia Lian came in again and Xi-feng ordered her maids to serve the wine\n",
      "and various choice dishes to go with it. Husband and wife sat cross-legged at\n",
      "opposite sides of the low table on the kang and began their drinking—Xi-feng with\n",
      "some restraint, although she was normally a fairly hard drinker, in view of the\n",
      "occasion.\n",
      "They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Zhao, walked\n",
      "in. The young couple at once invited her to drink with them and tried to make her\n",
      "join them on the kang. This last honour she would under no circumstances accept,\n",
      "and Patience and the girls laid a little table for her at the side of the kang and set a\n",
      "little stool beside it, on which she sat down very contentedly. Jia Lian made a\n",
      "selection with his chopsticks from the dishes on the table, and after heaping up two\n",
      "platefuls, set them down on Nannie Zhao’s own little table for her to eat there by\n",
      "herself. Xi-feng was critical:\n",
      "‘Nannie can’t chew stuff like that. She’ll break her teeth on it!’ She turned to\n",
      "Patience. ‘That piece of boiled gammon in the bowl I said this morning was so tender:\n",
      "that would be just the thing for Nannie. Why don’t you run round to the kitchen and\n",
      "ask them to heat it up for her?— Nannie,’ she said, addressing the old woman, ‘you.\n",
      "must try some of the rice wine your Lian brought back with him from the South!’\n",
      "‘Ooh yes!’ said Nannie Zhao, ‘I must try some of that! And you must have some too,\n",
      "Mrs. Lian. Never fear! As long as you don’t drink too much, ’ twill do you good. But I\n",
      "didn’t come all the way here for vittles and drink, bless you. I came on more serious\n",
      "business. And you heed my words, Mrs. Lian, and stick up for me; because that\n",
      "Master Lian of yours he always says he’ll do something, but when you go to see him\n",
      "\f",
      "later, he’s clean forgot all about it! To think I reared you up on the milk of my own\n",
      "bosom, Master Lian! And a fine young man you’ve growed into, thanks be! Well, I’m\n",
      "old and of no account now. But there are these two sons of mine, d’ye see? If only\n",
      "you would be more like a foster-brother to theta and look after them a bit, no one\n",
      "would dare say a word agen them. But dearie me! I’ve asked you again and again to\n",
      "help them, and you always says yes; yet to this very day nothing has ever come of it.\n",
      "Well, what I thought was this, Mrs Lian. With this great blessing of Heaven that’s\n",
      "come on the family on account of your eldest young lady, surely, I thought to myself,\n",
      "there must be jobs in this for someone? I’ll talk to Mrs Lian about it, I said to myself;\n",
      "because if I rely on Master Lian to help us, we’ll starve to death for certain sure!’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘Leave your two boys to me, Nannie. I’ll look after them! You know all about Lian’s\n",
      "little ways because you nursed him when he was a baby: he’ll give the dearest thing\n",
      "he has to some nobody he’s picked up outside, yet his own two foster-brothers who\n",
      "are much nicer young men than any of his favourites he neglects completely. If only\n",
      "you would take a bit of interest in them, Lian, you wouldn’t hear a word of complaint\n",
      "from anyone, instead of wasting your kindnesses on those -- those little male misses\n",
      "of yours! I shouldn’t have called them “misses”, though. You treat the misses as your\n",
      "missus and give me the miss! ’\n",
      "There was a loud laugh from everyone present, including Nannie Zhao, who\n",
      "concluded her cackles with a pious invoca?tion:\n",
      "‘Bless his Holy Name! Here at last comes a just judge to set all things to rights -- But\n",
      "oh Mrs Lian, those naughty things you said about “misses”: that’s not my Master Lian.\n",
      "It’s just that he’s so soft-hearted he can’t bring himself to say “ no” to anyone who\n",
      "spins him a tale.’\n",
      "‘Soft-hearted with his boy friends, maybe,’ said Xi-feng with a lubricious smile; ‘but\n",
      "when he has to do with us women he is hard enough.’\n",
      "‘Tee, hee, hee, what a one you are, Mrs Lian! I don’t know when I was last so merry.\n",
      "Come on, let’s have another cup of that good wine! — Now that I’ve got Mrs Lian to\n",
      "stand up for me I shall have no more worries!’\n",
      "Jia Lian was by now thoroughly embarrassed and laughed sheepishly.\n",
      "‘Stop all this nonsense now and serve the rice! I’ve still got to go round to Cousin\n",
      "Zhen’s after this to discuss things.’\n",
      "‘Ah yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We mustn’t make you late for that. What did Cousin Zhen\n",
      "want you for just now?’\n",
      "‘It was about the visitation business,’ said Jia Lian.\n",
      "‘Has it been settled, then?’\n",
      "‘Well, not absolutely. Eight or nine parts settled, you might say.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘That’s a great favour of the Emperor’s, isn’t it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Something you don’t\n",
      "hear of even in plays and stories about the olden days.’\n",
      "‘Very true!’ chimed in Nannie Zhao. ‘But I must be getting old and stupid, for\n",
      "everywhere these last few days have been a-buzz with talk of “visitations”, but\n",
      "blessed if I can make head or tall of it. You tell us now: just what manner of thing is\n",
      "this “visitation”?’\n",
      "Jia Lian undertook to do so.\n",
      "‘Our present Emperor, who has always had a great sym?pathy for the common man,\n",
      "believes that the filial affection of a child for its parents is the most important thing in\n",
      "the world, and that family feeling is the same everywhere, irrespective of social rank.\n",
      "He has found that in his own case, even after see?ing the Ex-Emperor and\n",
      "Ex-Empress morning, noon and night every day of his life, he is still unable to express\n",
      "more than a fraction of the devotion he feels for them; and this has led him to think\n",
      "of all those concubines and maids of honour and other court ladies, taken from their\n",
      "homes and shut up in the Palace for years and years on end, and to realize how much\n",
      "they must miss their parents. And from there he got to thinking of the parents\n",
      "themselves, how they must long for the daughters they can never see again. And\n",
      "then he thought what a crime against Nature it would be if any of those parents were\n",
      "to become ill as a result of not seeing their daughters. And so he addressed a\n",
      "Memorial to the Ex-Emperor and Ex-Empress requesting permission to allow the\n",
      "families of palace ladies to visit them in the Palace on the twelfth day of every month.\n",
      "When Their Old Majesties saw this Memorial they were very pleased and praised the\n",
      "Emperor for his piety and goodness—“doing Heaven’s work among men” they called\n",
      "it. But they pointed out in their Rescript that when the families of court ladies\n",
      "entered the Palace on these visits, they would inevitably be hampered by the\n",
      "restrictions of court etiquette in the ex?pression of their natural feelings. So in the\n",
      "end, by an act of supreme generosity, the Emperor issued a special decree in which\n",
      "he said that, apart from allowing the families of court ladies to visit their daughters in\n",
      "the Palace on the twelfth day of each month, he would allow any family which had a\n",
      "separate house or annexe capable of being maintained in the degree of security\n",
      "specified for a temporary Imperial Residence to make written application for\n",
      "permission to receive a Visitation in their own home, where the pleasures of reunion\n",
      "could be enjoyed in an atmosphere of intimacy and affection. The proclamation of\n",
      "this decree has created quite a stir. The Imperial Concubine Lady Zhou’s father\n",
      "already has the builders at work on a special wing for visitations in his house, and\n",
      "Lady Wu’s father, Wu Tian-you, has been outside the city looking for a site. So it’s\n",
      "already eight or nine parts settled, as I said.’\n",
      "‘Bless my soul!’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘So that’s what it is! Well, I suppose in that case\n",
      "\f",
      "we shall soon be getting ready to receive our young lady?’\n",
      "‘Of course,’ said Jia Lian. ‘What else do you think we’re all so busy about?’\n",
      "‘ If we do receive her,’ said Xi-feng, ‘it should be an ex?perience worth\n",

      "the north-west corner of your grounds on the west, to be turned into a Separate\n",

      "which should be ready tomorrow. Father says as you’ve just got home he’s sure you\n",

      "you can tell him about it first thing tomorrow.’\n",
      "‘Thank your father for me very much,’ said Jia Lian with a grateful smile. ‘It is very\n",
      "good of him to let me off tonight, and I shall do as he says and not go over until\n",
      "tomorrow. I think the great advantage of this proposal is that it is so economical and\n",

      "teachers and to buy girl players and instruments and costumes so that we can have\n",
      "our own theatricals for the visitation. I’m to take Lai Sheng’s two sons with me; and\n",

      "should say the pickings would be pretty good for someone who knew the ropes.’\n",
      "Jia Qiang laughed too.\n",
      "‘I shall have to learn as I go along!’\n",
      "Jia Rong, who was standing somewhat away. From the light, availed himself of the\n",
      "shadow’s concealment to give Xi-feng’s dress a surreptitious tug. She understood\n",
      "perfectly well what his meaning was, but pretended not to, dismissing him with a\n",
      "curt wave of the hand and addressing herself instead to Jia Lian:\n",
      "‘Don’t be so officious, Lian! Cousin Zhen is no less capable of choosing the right\n",
      "person for the job than we are. What do you mean by asking the boy if he’s qualified?\n",
      "He’s as much qualified as any of the rest of us. He’s old enough to have seen a pig run,\n",
      "even if he’s not old enough to have eaten pork! In any case, I’m sure Cousin Zhen\n",
      "only chose him as a figurehead. You don’t seriously suppose that he’ll be the one to\n",
      "discuss prices and deal with the business side of the expedition? — I think myself it’s\n",
      "a very good choice!’\n",
      "‘Of course it is,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t dispute it. I merely thought we ought to do a\n",
      "few of his sums for him before he goes. Where is the money for this coming from?’\n",
      "he asked Jia Qiang.\n",
      "‘We were discussing that just now,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Gaffer Lai says that there’s no\n",
      "point in taking money with us from here. He says the Zhens of Kiangnan hold fifty\n",
      "thousand taels of ours on deposit and he can give us a letter of credit to take to them\n",
      "when we go. We’ll draw out thirty thousand first and leave the rest to buy lanterns,\n",
      "lamps, and curtains with later on.’\n",
      "Jia Lian nodded appreciatively.\n",
      "‘Good idea.’\n",
      "‘Well, if that’s all settled,’ Xi-feng put in quickly, ‘I’ve got two very reliable young\n",
      "men for you to take with you, Qiang. I’m sure you’ll find them extremely useful.’\n",
      "‘What a coincidence!’ said Jia Qiang. ‘I was just about to ask if you could\n",
      "recommend a couple of helpers!’\n",
      "He asked for their names, and Xi-feng turned to Nannie Zhao to supply them. But the\n",
      "old nurse was so bemused by all this talk of policy and high finance that she\n",
      "appeared to be in a sort of coma, which it took a sharp nudge from Patience to rouse\n",
      "her from. When she answered it was in a gabble, to make up for the awkward pause.\n",
      "‘One of them is called Zhao Tian-liang, the other is called Zhao Tian-dong.’\n",
      "‘Mind you don’t forget!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I’m off to see to my own affairs.’ And\n",
      "she left the room.\n",
      "Jia Rong slipped out after her.\n",
      "‘If you will make a list of all the things you want,’ he said, smilingly and softly, ‘I’ll\n",
      "see that he gets them for you, gracious lady.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Gracious arsehole!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you think you can buy my favour with a few\n",
      "knick-knacks? I don’t like all this whispering in corners.’\n",
      "She walked away without giving him a chance to reply.\n",
      "Meanwhile Jia Qiang was making a somewhat similar proposal to Jia Lian.\n",
      "‘If there’s anything I can get for you while I’m away, Uncle, I shall be glad to wangle\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "‘My, my!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Let’s not get carried away, then! I must say, for one who’s\n",
      "only just started, you certainly haven’t lost much time in picking up the tricks of the\n",
      "trade! Yes, I dare say I shall write and let you know if I find I’m short of anything.’\n",
      "With these words he sent the two young men back to the other house. Their\n",
      "departure was followed by a succession of three or four visits by servants reporting\n",
      "on household matters, after which he felt so exhausted that he instructed the\n",
      "servants on the inner gate to refuse admittance to any others and to inform them\n",
      "that he would deal with their business next day. It was midnight by the time Xi-feng\n",
      "got back to bed.\n",
      "But the affairs of that night are no part of our story.\n",
      "Rising early next morning, Jia Lian first called on his father and uncles and then went\n",
      "to the Ning-guo mansion, where, with Cousin Zhen, he joined a group consisting of\n",
      "the older stewards and domestics and a few friends and clients of the family in\n",
      "making a complete survey of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties with a view to\n",
      "deciding where the various buildings of the Separate Residence should be sited. He\n",
      "also helped them interview the craftsmen who would undertake the work.\n",
      "After the assembling of builders and artisans the assembling of materials began: a\n",
      "continuous flow of supplies converging on the site from every direction, from\n",
      "precious consignments of gold, silver, copper and tin, to huge, bulky loads of\n",
      "builder’s clay, timber, bricks and tiles.\n",
      "Various walls, including the surrounding walls of the All? scents Garden, and some of\n",
      "the garden’s pavilions were demolished so that the north-west part of the Ning-guo\n",
      "property and the large open court on the north-east side of Rong-guo House were\n",
      "thrown into a single site. A range of servants’ quarters on the east side of the\n",
      "Rong-guo grounds had already been demolished. The Ning-guo and Rong-guo\n",
      "properties had previous to this been divided by an alley-way running from north to\n",
      "south between them, but as it was not a public thoroughfare, no problem as involved\n",
      "in closing it and incorporating part of it in the rest of the new site.\n",
      "The All-scents Garden had been watered by a stream led in by a culvert which ran\n",
      "under a corner of the north wall. Now that the garden was being integrated in the\n",
      "larger site, it was no longer necessary to lead the water in at this point.\n",
      "The artificial hills, rocks, trees and shrubs of All-scents Garden were, of course,\n",
      "\f",
      "insufficient for the whole of the new site; but the area occupied by Jia She was the\n",
      "original garden of Rong-guo House and plentifully supplied with bamboos, trees,\n",
      "rocks, pavilions, kiosks and pergolas capable of being moved elsewhere. By pooling\n",
      "the resources of these two garden—the All-scents Garden of Ning-guo House and the\n",
      "original Rong-guo garden where Jia She lived— and redistri?buting them over a single\n",
      "area, it would be possible to make great economies in both labour and materials, and\n",
      "when the estimates came to be made it was found that the requirements, in terms of\n",
      "completely new materials, would be comparatively modest.\n",
      "The conception as a whole and the designs for its execution were alike the work of a\n",
      "well-known landscape gardener familiar to all and sundry by the sobriquet of\n",
      "‘Horticultural Hu’.\n",
      "Jia Zheng was unused to matters of a practical nature and left the management of\n",
      "men and the control of operations to a consortium consisting of Jia She, Cousin Zhen\n",
      "and Jia Lian, the stewards Lai Da, Lai Sheng and Lin Zhi-xiao, the Clerk of Stores Wu\n",
      "Xin-deng, and two of his literary gentlemen, Zhan Guang and Cheng Ri-xing. The\n",
      "digging of pools, the raising of hills, the sitting and erection of lodges and pavilions,\n",
      "the planting of bamboos and flowers—in a word, all matters pertaining to the\n",
      "landscaping and layout of the gardens, were planned and supervised by Horticultural\n",
      "Hu. Jia Zheng would merely drop in occasionally when he got back from Court and\n",
      "look around. On any important matters he sought the advice of Jia She and the rest.\n",
      "Jia She led a life of cultured ease and never did anything. On routine matters of no\n",
      "great importance Cousin Zhen would either report to him in person or send him a\n",
      "brief note when the thing was done. If consultation was unavoidable, he would send\n",
      "along Lai Da or one of the others for a reply.\n",
      "Jia Rong’s sole task was to supervise the making of objects in gold and silver.\n",
      "Jia Qiang had already left for Soochow.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen, Lai Da and the rest were the ones who did most of the real work. It was\n",
      "they who hired workmen, kept accounts, and supervised and inspected each job as it\n",
      "was undertaken.\n",
      "The amount of noise and activity generated by these opera?tions could not be\n",
      "described in a few words, and for the time being we shall not attempt the task.\n",
      "The family’s recent preoccupation with these important developments had released\n",
      "Bao-yu from his father’s periodical quizzing about the progress of his studies.\n",
      "Unfortunately the relief of mind which this would otherwise have afforded him was\n",
      "displaced by a grave concern for Qin Zhong, whose sickness seemed to be daily\n",
      "worsening. Under such circumstances it was impossible for him to feel happy about\n",
      "anything else.\n",
      "One morning, just as he had finished washing and dressing and was thinking of going\n",
      "\f",
      "round to Grandmother Jia to ask if he might pay Qin Zhong another visit, he caught\n",
      "sight of Tealeaf dodging about behind the screen wall of the inner gate and evidently\n",
      "trying to catch his attention. Bao-yu hurried over to him.\n",
      "‘What is it?’\n",
      "‘Master Qin. He’s dying!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was stunned.\n",
      "‘Dying? When I saw him yesterday he seemed quite lucid. How can he be dying so\n",
      "soon?’\n",
      "‘I don’t know,’ said Tealeaf. ‘But that’s what the old gaffer said just now who came\n",
      "round to tell me.’\n",
      "Bao-yu hurried back and told Grandmother Jia. She in?structed some of the more\n",
      "reliable servants to go with him and briefly admonished him before he went:\n",
      "‘When you get there you may stay with him to the end, since you have been such\n",
      "good friends; but you must come back as soon as it is over. Don’t hang about!’\n",
      "Bao-yu hurried off to change, only to find, on re-emerging, that the carriage was still\n",
      "not ready. Anxious lest he should arrive too late, he ran up and down the courtyard in\n",
      "a frenzy of impatience, imploring the servants to make haste; and when it at last\n",
      "arrived, he flung himself in it and drove off at great speed, hotly pursued by Li Gui,\n",
      "Tealeaf and the others attend?ing him.\n",
      "The house, when they reached it, appeared silent and deserted. Entering together in\n",
      "a tight little knot, master and servants surged through like swarming bees to the\n",
      "inner apartment at the back where Qin Zhong lay, causing great consternation among\n",
      "the two aunts and half-dozen girl cousins who were tending him and who were\n",
      "unable to con?ceal themselves before the advent of this masculine invasion.\n",
      "At this stage Qin Zhong had already lost consciousness several times and, in\n",
      "accordance with the Northern custom which forbids a sick man to breathe his last on\n",
      "the kang, had some time since been lifted on to a trestle bed to die. Bao-yu gave an\n",
      "involuntary cry when he saw where he was lying and broke into noisy weeping. He\n",
      "was quickly restrained by Li Gui:\n",
      "‘You know how delicate Master Qin is. I expect the kang was too hard for him and\n",
      "they have put him here so that he can lie a bit more easy. You mustn’t cry like that or\n",
      "you will make him worse!’\n",
      "Bao-yu held back his sobs and drew close to his dying friend. Qin Zhong’s face was\n",
      "waxen. His eyes were closed tight and he seemed to breathe with difficulty, twisting\n",
      "his head from side to side on the pillow.\n",
      "‘Jing-qing, old fellow! It’s me! It’s Bao-yu!’—He called him several times, but Qin\n",
      "Zhong seemed unaware of his presence. Again he called:\n",
      "‘It’s Bao-yu!’\n",
      "\f",
      "In point of fact Qin Zhong’s soul had already left his body and the few faint gasps of\n",
      "breath in his failing lungs were the only life that now remained in it. The ministers of\n",
      "the under?world, armed with a warrant and chains to bind him with, were at that\n",
      "very moment confronting him; but his soul was refusing to go quietly. Remembering\n",
      "that he left no one behind him to look after his family’s affairs, and bethinking him of\n",
      "poor Sapientia whose whereabouts were still unknown, he entreated them most\n",
      "piteously to spare him. But the infernal visitants had no ear for his entreaties and\n",
      "silenced him with angry rebuke:\n",
      "‘You’re an educated young fellow: haven’t you heard the saying\n",
      "If Yama calls at midnight hour\n",
      "      No man can put off death till four—?\n",

      "doing kindnesses and showing favours and inventing little tricks and dodges for\n",
      "frustrating the course of justice -- we are incapable of showing partiality.’\n",
      "Suddenly, above their angry shouting, Qin Zhong heard a tiny cry:\n",
      "‘It’s Bao-yu!’\n",
      "At once he renewed his entreaties:\n",
      "‘Good gentlemen, be merciful! Give me just a moment for a few words with a very\n",
      "dear friend of mine, and I’ll be back directly!’\n",
      "‘What is it now?’ asked the demons. ‘What friend?’\n",
      "‘I won’t deceive you, gentlemen. It’s a descendant of the Duke of Rong-guo. His\n",
      "name is Bao-yu.’\n",
      "‘What?’ screamed the officer in charge of the party in great alarm. He turned\n",
      "angrily on his demon minions;\n",
      "‘I told you we ought to let him go back for a bit, but you wouldn’t listen. Now look\n",
      "what’s happened! He’s gone and called up a person full of life and health to come\n",
      "here right in our midst! This is terrible!’\n",
      "The demons showed signs of disarray on observing their leader to be so affected, and\n",
      "there was some angry mutter?ing:\n",
      "‘Yer Honour was putting on a brave enough show a short while ago. Why should\n",
      "the name “Bao-yu” throw you into such a state of commotion? If you ask us, seeing\n",
      "that he’s upper world and we’re lower world, there’s nothing to be afraid of. We\n",
      "might just as well carry this one off now and have done with it.’\n",
      "The trepidation of their leader, who was perhaps thinking more of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "demon-repelling talisman than of its wearer, was far from comforted by this\n",
      "reflection.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘No! No! No!’ he shouted, and compelled them to let the soul return to its body.\n",
      "With the return of his soul Qin Zhong regained conscious?ness and opened his eyes.\n",
      "He could see Bao-yu standing beside him; but his throat was so choked with phlegm\n",

      "to suit the places where inscriptions are required, and have them painted on\n",
      "rectangu?lar paper lanterns which can be hung up temporarily –either horizontally or\n",
      "vertically as the case may be—when Her Grace comes to visit. We can ask her to\n",
      "decide on the permanent names after she has inspected the garden. Is not this a\n",
      "solution of the dilemma?’\n",
      "‘It is indeed,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘when we look round the garden presently, we must all\n",
      "try to think of words that can be used. If they seem suitable, we can keep them for\n",
      "the lanterns. If not, we can call for Yu-cun to come and help us out.’\n",
      "‘Your own suggestions are sure to be admirable, Sir Zheng,’ said the literary\n",
      "gentlemen ingratiatingly. ‘There will be no need to call in Yu-cun.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng smiled deprecatingly.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I am afraid it is not as you imagine. In my youth I had at best only indifferent skill in\n",
      "the art of writing verses about natural objects -- birds and flowers and scenery and\n",
      "the like; and now that I’m older and have to devote all my energies to official\n",
      "documents and government papers, I am even more out of touch with this sort of\n",
      "thing than I was then; so that even if I were to try my hand at it, I fear that my efforts\n",
      "would be rather dull and pedantic ones. Instead of enhancing the interest and beauty\n",
      "of the garden, they would probably have a deadening effect upon both.’\n",
      "‘That doesn’t matter,’ the literary gentlemen replied. ‘We can all try our hands at\n",
      "composing. If each of us contributes what he is best at, and if we then select the\n",
      "better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good, we should be able to\n",
      "manage all right.’\n",
      "‘That seems to me a very good suggestion,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘As the weather today is\n",
      "so warm and pleasant, let us all go and take a turn round the garden now!’\n",
      "So saying he rose to his feet and conducted his little retinue of literary luminaries\n",
      "towards the garden. Cousin Zhen hurried on ahead to warn those in charge that they\n",
      "were coming.\n",
      "As Bao-yu was still in very low spirits these days because of his grief for Qin Zhong,\n",
      "Grandmother Jia had hit on the idea of sending him into the newly made garden to\n",
      "play. By un?lucky chance she had selected this very day on which to try out her\n",
      "antidote. He had in fact only just entered the garden when Cousin Zhen came\n",
      "hurrying towards him.\n",
      "‘Better get out of here!’ said Cousin Zhen with an amused smile. ‘Your father will\n",
      "be here directly!’\n",
      "Bao-ya streaked back towards the gate, a string of nurses and pages hurrying at his\n",
      "heels. But he had only just turned the corner on coming out of it when he almost ran\n",
      "into the arms of Jia Zheng and his party coming from the opposite direction. Escape\n",
      "was impossible. He simply had to stand meekly to one side and await instructions.\n",
      "Jia Zheng had recently received a favourable report on Bao-yu from his teacher Jia\n",
      "Dai-ru in which mention had been made of his skill in composing couplets. Although\n",
      "the boy showed no aptitude for serious study, Dai-ru had said, he nevertheless\n",
      "possessed a certain meretricious talent for versi?fication not undeserving of\n",
      "commendation. Because of this report, Jia Zheng ordered Bao-yu to accompany him\n",
      "into the garden, intending to put his aptitude to the test. Bao-yu, who knew nothing\n",
      "either of Dai-ru’s report or of his father’s in?tentions, followed with trepidation.\n",
      "As soon as they reached the gate they found Cousin Zhen at the head of a group of\n",
      "overseers waiting to learn Jia Zheng’s wishes.\n",
      "‘I want you to close the gate,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘so that we can see what it looks like\n",
      "from outside before we go in.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Cousin Zhen ordered the gate to be closed, and Jia Zheng stood back and studied it\n",
      "gravely.\n",
      "It was a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles. The\n",
      "wooden lattice-work of the doors and windows was finely carved and ingeniously\n",
      "patterned. The whole gatehouse was quite unadorned by colour or gild?ing, yet all\n",
      "was of the most exquisite workmanship. Its walls stood on a terrace of white marble\n",
      "carved with a pattern of passion-flowers in relief, and the garden’s whitewashed\n",
      "circumference wall to left and right of it had a footing made of black-and-white\n",
      "striped stone blocks arranged so that the stripes formed a simple pattern. Jia Zheng\n",
      "found the unosten?tatious simplicity of this entrance greatly to his liking, and after\n",
      "ordering the gates to be opened, passed on inside.\n",
      "A cry of admiration escaped them as they entered, for there, immediately in front of\n",
      "them, screening everything else from their view, rose a steep, verdure-clad hill.\n",
      "‘Without this hill,’ Jia Zheng somewhat otiosely observed, ‘the whole garden would\n",
      "be visible as one entered, and all its mystery would be lost.’\n",
      "The literary gentlemen concurred. ‘Only a master of the art of landscape could have\n",
      "conceived so bold a stroke,’ said one of them.\n",
      "As they gazed at this miniature mountain, they observed a great number of large\n",
      "white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes, rising course above\n",
      "course up one of its sides, some recumbent, some upright or leaning at angles, their\n",
      "surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half concealed by creepers,\n",
      "and with a narrow, zigzag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between\n",
      "them.\n",
      "‘Let us begin our tour by following this path,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If we work our way\n",
      "round towards the other side of the hill on our way back, we shall have made a\n",
      "complete circuit of the garden.’\n",
      "He ordered Cousin Zhen to lead the way, and leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, began the\n",
      "winding ascent of the little mountain. Suddenly on the mountainside above his head,\n",
      "he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smoothness and\n",
      "realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an\n",
      "inscription.\n",
      "‘Aha, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng turning back to address the others who were\n",
      "climbing up behind him. ‘What name are we going to choose for this mountain?’\n",
      "‘Emerald Heights,’ said one.\n",
      "‘Embroidery Hill,’ said another.\n",
      "Another proposed that they should call it ‘Little Censer’ after the famous Censer\n",
      "Peak in Kiangsi. Another proposed ‘Little Zhong-nan’. Altogether some twenty or\n",
      "thirty names were suggested -- none of them very seriously, since the literary\n",
      "\f",
      "gentlemen were aware that Jia Zheng intended to test Bao-yu and were anxious not\n",
      "to make the boy’s task too difficult. Bao-yu understood and was duly grateful.\n",
      "When no more names were forthcoming Jia Zheng turned to Bao-yu and asked him\n",
      "to propose something himself.\n",
      "‘I remember reading in some old book,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that “to recall old things is\n",
      "better than to invent new ones; and to re-cut an ancient text is better than to\n",
      "engrave a modern”. We ought, then, to choose something old. But as this is not the\n",
      "garden’s principal “mountain” or its chief vista, strictly speak?ing there is no\n",
      "justification for having an inscription here at all—unless it is to be something which\n",
      "implies that this is merely a first step towards more important things ahead. I suggest\n",
      "we should call it “Pathway to Mysteries” after the line in Chang Jian’s poem about\n",
      "the mountain temple:\n",
      "\n",
      "A path winds upwards to mysterious places.\n",
      "\n",
      "A name like that would be more distinguished.’\n",
      "There was a chorus of praise from the literary gentlemen:\n",
      "‘Exactly right! Wonderful! Our young friend with his natural talent and youthful\n",
      "imagination succeeds immediately where we old pedants fail!’\n",
      "Jia Zheng gave a deprecatory laugh:\n",
      "‘You mustn’t flatter the boy! People of his age are adept at making a little\n",
      "knowledge go a long way. I only asked him as a joke, to see what he would say. We\n",
      "shall have to think of a better name later on.’\n",
      "As he spoke, they passed through a tunnel of rock in the mountain’s shoulder into an\n",
      "artificial ravine ablaze with the vari-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of\n",
      "tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion. Down below, where the trees\n",
      "were thickest, a clear stream gushed between the rocks. After they had advanced a\n",
      "few paces in a somewhat northerly direction, the ravine broadened into a little\n",
      "flat-bottomed valley and the stream widened out to form a pool. Gaily painted and\n",
      "carved pavilions rose from the slopes on either side, their lower halves concealed\n",
      "amidst the trees, their tops reaching into the blue. In the midst of the prospect below\n",
      "them was a handsome bridge:\n",
      "In a green ravine\n",
      "A jade stream sped.\n",
      "A stair of stone\n",
      "Plunged to the brink.\n",
      "where the water widened\n",
      "To a placid pool,\n",
      "\f",
      "A marble baluster\n",
      "Ran round about.\n",
      "A marble bridge crossed it\n",
      "With triple span,\n",
      "And a marble lion’s maw\n",
      "Crowned each of the arches.\n",
      "Over the centre of the bridge there was a little pavilion, which Jia Zheng and the\n",
      "others entered and sat down in.\n",
      "‘Well, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What are we going to call it?’\n",
      "‘Ou-yang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of “a pavilion poised above\n",
      "the water”,’ said one of them. ‘what about “Poised Pavilion”?’\n",
      "‘“Poised Pavilion” is good,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but this pavilion was put here in order to\n",
      "dominate the water it stands over, and I think there ought to be some reference to\n",
      "water in its name. I seem to recollect that in that same essay you men?tion Ou-yang\n",
      "Xiu speaks of the water “gushing between twin peaks”. Could we not use the word\n",
      "“gushing” in some way?’\n",
      "‘Yes, yes!’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘“Gushing Jade” would do splendidly.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng fondled his beard meditatively, then turned to Bao-yu and asked him for his\n",
      "suggestion.\n",
      "‘I agreed with what you said just now, Father,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but on second thoughts\n",
      "it seems to me that though it may have been all right for Ou-yang Xiu to use the word\n",
      "“gush?ing” in describing the source of the river Rang, it doesn’t really suit the water\n",
      "round this pavilion. Then again, as this is a Separate Residence specially designed for\n",
      "the reception of a royal personage, it seems to me that something rather formal is\n",
      "called for, and that an expression taken from the Drunkard’s Pavilion might seem a bit\n",
      "improper. I think we should try to find a rather more imaginative, less obvious sort of\n",
      "name.’\n",
      "‘I hope you gentlemen are all taking this in!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically, ‘You will\n",
      "observe that when we suggest something original we are recommended to prefer the\n",
      "old to the new, but that when we do make use of an old text we are “improper” and\n",
      "“unimaginative”! -- Well, carry on then! Let’s have your suggestion!’\n",
      "‘I think “Drenched Blossoms” would be more original and more tasteful than\n",
      "“Gushing Jade”.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently. The literary gentlemen could see\n",
      "that he was pleased and hastened to commend Bao-yu’s remarkable ability.\n",
      "‘That’s the two words for the framed board on top,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Not a very\n",
      "difficult task. But what about the seven-word lines for the sides?’\n",
      "Bao-yu glanced quickly round, seeking inspiration from the scene, and presently\n",
      "\f",
      "came up with the following couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Three pole-thrust lengths of bankside willows green,\n",
      "One fragrant breath of bankside flowers sweet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng nodded and a barely perceptible smile played over his features. The literary\n",
      "gentlemen redoubled their praises.\n",
      "They now left the pavilion and crossed to the other side of the pool. For a while they\n",
      "walked on, stopping from time to time to admire the various rocks and flowers and\n",
      "trees which they passed on their way, until suddenly they found them?selves at the\n",
      "foot of a range of whitewashed walls enclosing a small retreat almost hidden among\n",
      "the hundreds and hundreds of green bamboos which grew in a dense thicket behind\n",
      "them. With cries of admiration they went inside. A cloister-like covered walk ran\n",
      "round the walls from the entrance to the back of the forecourt and a cobbled\n",
      "pathway up to the steps of the terrace. The house was a tiny three-frame one, two\n",
      "parts latticed, the third part windowless. The tables, chairs and couches which\n",
      "furnished it seemed to have been specially made to fit the interior. A door in the rear\n",
      "wall opened onto a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flowering\n",
      "pear-tree and overlooked on either side by two diminutive lodges built at right angles\n",
      "to the back of the house. A stream gushed through an opening at the foot of the\n",
      "garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran to the foot of the rear terrace\n",
      "and thence round the side of the house to the front, where it meandered through\n",
      "the bamboos of the forecourt before finally disappearing through another opening in\n",
      "the surrounding wall.\n",
      "‘This must be a pleasant enough place at any time,’ said Jia Zheng with a smile. ‘But\n",
      "just imagine what it would be like to sit studying beside the window here on a\n",
      "moonlight night! It is pleasures like that which make a man feel he has not lived in\n",
      "vain!’\n",
      "As he spoke, his glance happened to fall on Bao-yu, who instantly became so\n",
      "embarrassed that he hung his head in shame. He was rescued by the timely\n",
      "intervention of the literary gentlemen who changed the subject from that of study to\n",
      "a less dangerous topic. Two of them suggested that the name given to this retreat\n",
      "should be a four-word one. Jia Zheng asked them what four words they proposed.\n",
      "‘“Where Bends the Qi”’ said one of them, no doubt hav?ing in mind the song in the\n",
      "Poetry Classic which begins with the words\n",
      "\n",
      "See in that nook where bends the Qi,\n",
      "The green bamboos, how graceful grown!\n",
      "\f",
      "‘No,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too obvious!’\n",
      "‘“North of the Sui”,’ said the other, evidently thinking of the ancient Rabbit Garden\n",
      "of the Prince of Liang in Suiyang—also famous for its bamboos and running water.\n",
      "‘No,’ said jia Zheng. ‘Still too obvious!’\n",
      "‘You’d better ask Cousin Bao again,’ said Cousin Zhen, who stood by listening.\n",
      "‘He always insists on criticizing everyone else’s suggestions before he will deign to\n",
      "make one of his own,’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘He is a worthless creature.’\n",
      "‘That’s all right,’ said the others. ‘His criticisms are very good ones. He is in no way\n",
      "to blame for making them.’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t let him get away with it!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘All right!’ he went on,\n",
      "turning to Bao-yu. ‘Today we will indulge you up to the hilt. Let’s have your criticisms,\n",
      "and after that we’ll hear your own proposal. What about the two suggestions that\n",
      "have just been made? Do you think either of them could be used?’\n",
      "‘Neither of them seems quite right to me,’ said Bao-yu in answer to the question.\n",
      "‘In what way “not quite right”?’ said Jia Zheng with a scornful smile.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘This is the first building our visitor will enter when she looks\n",
      "over the garden, so there ought to be some word of praise for the Emperor at this\n",
      "point. If we want a classical reference with imperial symbolism, I suggest “The\n",
      "Phoenix Dance”, alluding to that passage in the History Classic about the male and\n",
      "female phoenixes alighting “with measured gambollings” in the Emperor’s courtyard.’\n",
      "‘What about “Bend of the Qi” and “North of the Sui”?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Aren’t they\n",
      "classical allusions? If not, I should like to know what they are!’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they are too contrived. “The Phoenix Dance” is more fitting.’\n",
      "There was a loud murmur of assent from the literary gentlemen. Jia Zhong nodded\n",
      "and tried not to look pleased.\n",
      "‘Young idiot!— A “small capacity but a great self-con?ceit”, gentlemen— All right!’\n",
      "he ordered: ‘now the couplet!’\n",
      "So Bao-yu recited the following couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ‘From the empty cauldron the steam still rises after the brewing of tea.\n",
      "By the darkening window the fingers are still cold after the game of Go.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng shook his head:\n",
      "‘Nothing very remarkable about that!’\n",
      "With this remark he began to move on, but thought of something just as they were\n",
      "leaving, and stopped to ask Cousin Zhen:\n",
      "‘I see that the buildings in this garden have their proper complement of chairs and\n",
      "\f",
      "tables and so forth. What about blinds and curtains and flower-vases and all that sort\n",
      "of thing? Have they been selected to suit the individual rooms?’\n",
      "‘As regards ornaments,’ Cousin Zhen replied, ‘we have already got in quite a large\n",
      "stock, and when the time comes we shall naturally select from it what is suitable for\n",
      "each individual room. As regards drapes and hangings, Cousin Lian told me yesterday\n",
      "that there are quite a lot yet to come. what we did was to take the measurements\n",
      "from the plans drawn up for the carpenters and put the work in hand straight away,\n",
      "even before the buildings were finished. As far as I know, up to yesterday we had\n",
      "received about half of what was ordered.’\n",
      "From the way Cousin Zhen spoke, Jia Zheng gathered that this was not his\n",
      "responsibility and sent someone to summon Jia Lian. He arrived within moments,\n",
      "and Jia Zheng ques?tioned him about the types and quantities ordered and the\n",
      "figures for what had already been received and what was still to come.\n",
      "In response to his inquiry Jia Lian extracted a wallet from the leg of his boot, and\n",
      "glancing at a folded schedule inside it summarized its contents as follows:\n",
      "‘Curtains, large and small, in various silks and satins—flowered, dragon-spot,\n",
      "sprigged, tapestry, panelled, ink-splash: one hundred and twenty. —Eighty of those\n",
      "were delivered yesterday. That leaves forty to come. —Blinds: two hundred. —Yes.\n",
      "They all arrived yesterday. But then there are the special ones. —Blinds, scarlet felt:\n",
      "two hundred. Speckled bamboo: one hundred. Red lacquered bamboo with gold\n",
      "fleck: one hundred. Black lacquered bamboo: one hundred. Coloured net: two\n",
      "hundred. —We now have half of each of those four kinds. The other half is promised\n",
      "by the end of autumn. —Chair-covers, table-drapes, valances, tablecloths: one\n",
      "thousand two hundred of each. —Those we already have.’\n",
      "They had been moving on as he spoke, but were presently brought to a halt by a\n",
      "steeply sloping hill which rose up in front of them. Having negotiated its foot, they\n",
      "could see, almost concealed in a fold half-way up the other side of it, a dim-coloured\n",
      "adobe wall crowned with a coping of rice-straw thatch. Inside it were several\n",
      "hundred apricot trees, whose flowering tops resembled the billowing rosy clouds of\n",
      "some vegetable volcano. In their midst stood a little group of reed?-thatched\n",
      "cottages. Beyond the wall, with a barred gate divid?ing it in the middle, a loose\n",
      "hedge of irregular shape had been made by weaving together the pliant young\n",
      "shoots of the mulberry, elm, hibiscus, and silkworm thorn trees which grew outside it.\n",
      "Between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well,\n",
      "furnished with both well-sweep and windlass. Below the well, row upon row of\n",
      "miniature fields full of healthy-looking vegetables and flowers ran down in variegated\n",
      "strips to the bottom.\n",
      "‘Ah, now here is a place with a purpose!’ said Jia Zheng with a pleased smile. It may\n",
      "\f",
      "have been made by human arti?fice, but the sight of it is none the less moving. In me\n",
      "it awakens the desire to get back to the land, to a life of rural simplicity. Let us go in\n",
      "and rest a while!’\n",
      "They were just on the point of entering the gate in the hedge when they observed a\n",
      "stone at the side of the pathway leading up to it which had evidently been put there\n",
      "in order that the name of the place might be inscribed upon it.\n",
      "‘What a brilliant idea!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘If they had put a board\n",
      "up over the gate, the rustic atmosphere would have been completely destroyed,\n",
      "whereas this stone actually enhances it. This is a place which calls for the bucolic\n",
      "talent of a Fan Cheng-da to do it justice!’\n",
      "‘What shall we call it, then?’ asked Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘Just now our young friend was saying that to “recall an bid thing is better than to\n",
      "invent a new one”,’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘In this case the ancients have\n",
      "already provided the perfect name: “Apricot Village”.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng knew that he was referring to the words of the fainting traveller in Du Mu’s\n",
      "poem:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where’s the tavern?’ I cry, and a lad points the way\n",
      "To a village far off in the apricot trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to Cousin Zhen with a smile:\n",
      "‘Yes. That reminds me. There’s just one thing missing here: an inn-sign. Tomorrow\n",
      "you must have one made. Nothing fancy. Just an ordinary inn-sign like the ones you\n",
      "see in country villages outside. And it should hang from a bamboo pole above the\n",
      "tree-tops.’\n",
      "Cousin Zhen promised to see this done and added a sugges?tion of his own:\n",
      "‘The birds here, too, ought to be ordinary farmyard ones—hens, ducks, geese, and\n",
      "so on—to be in keeping with the surroundings.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng and the rest agreed enthusiastically.\n",
      "‘The only trouble with “Apricot Village”,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘—though it would suit the\n",
      "place very well—is that it is the name of a real village; so we should have to get\n",
      "official permission first before we could use it.’\n",
      "‘Ah, yes,’ said the others. ‘That means we still have to think of something for a\n",
      "temporary name. Now what shall it be?’\n",
      "While they were all still thinking, Bao-yu who had already had an idea, was so\n",
      "bursting with eagerness that he broke in, without waiting to be invited by his father:\n",
      "‘There is an old poem which has the lines\n",
      "\f",
      "Above the flowering apricot\n",
      "A hopeful inn-sign hangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the inscription on the stone we ought to have “The Hopeful Sign”.’\n",
      "‘“The Hopeful Sign”,’ echoed the literary gentlemen admiringly. ‘Very good! The\n",
      "hidden allusion to “Apricot Village” is most ingenious!’\n",
      "‘Oh, as for the name of the village,’ said Bao-yu scornfully, ‘“Apricot Village” is\n",
      "much too obvious! why not “Sweet-rice Village” from the words of the old poem:\n",
      "\n",
      "A cottage by the water stands\n",
      "Where Sweet the young rice smells?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The literary gentlemen clapped their hands delightedly; but their cries of admiration\n",
      "were cut short by an angry shout from Jia Zheng:\n",
      "‘Ignorant young puppy! Just how many “old poets” and “old poems” do you think\n",
      "you know, that you should pre?sume to show off in front of your elders in this\n",
      "impertinent manner? We let you have your little say just now in order to test your\n",
      "intelligence. It was no more than a joke. Do you suppose we are seriously interested\n",
      "in your opinions?’\n",
      "They had been moving on meanwhile, and he now led them into the largest of the\n",
      "little thatched buildings, from whose simple interior with its paper windows and\n",
      "plain deal furniture all hint of urban refinement had been banished. Jia Zheng was\n",
      "inwardly pleased. He stared hard at Bao-yu:\n",
      "‘How do you like this place, then?’\n",
      "With secret winks and nods the literary gentlemen urged Bao-yu to make a\n",
      "favourable reply, but he willfully ignored their promptings.\n",
      "‘Not nearly as much as “The Phoenix Dance”.’\n",
      "His father snorted disgustedly.\n",
      "‘Ignoramus! You have eyes only for painted halls and gaudy pavilions—the rubbishy\n",
      "trappings of wealth. What can you know of the beauty that lies in quietness and\n",
      "natural simplicity? This is a consequence of your refusal to study properly.’\n",
      "‘Your rebuke is, of course, justified, Father,’ Bao-yu replied promptly, ‘but then I\n",
      "have never really understood what it was the ancients meant by “natural”.’\n",
      "The literary gentlemen, who had observed a vein of mulish?ness in Bao-yu which\n",
      "boded trouble, were surprised by the seeming na?veté of this reply.\n",
      "‘Why, fancy not knowing what “natural” means -- you who have such a good\n",
      "understanding of so much else! “Natural” is that which is of nature, that is to say,\n",
      "that which is produced by nature as opposed to that which is produced by human\n",
      "\f",
      "artifice.’\n",
      "‘There you are, you see!’ said Bao-yu. ‘A farm set down in the middle of a place like\n",
      "this is obviously the product of human artifice. There are no neighbouring villages, no\n",
      "distant prospects of city walls; the mountain at the back doesn’t belong to any\n",
      "system; there is no pagoda rising from some tree-hid monastery in the hills above;\n",
      "there is no bridge below leading to a near-by market town. It sticks up out of\n",
      "nowhere, in total isolation from everything else. It isn’t even a par?ticularly\n",
      "remarkable view—not nearly so “natural” in either form or spirit as those other\n",
      "places we have seen. The bam?boos in those other places may have been planted by\n",
      "human hand and the streams diverted out of their natural courses, but there was no\n",
      "appearance of artifice. That’s why, when the ancients use the term “natural” I have\n",
      "my doubts about what they really meant. For example, when they speak of a “natural\n",
      "painting”, I can’t help wondering if they are not referring to precisely that forcible\n",
      "interference with the landscape to which I object: putting hills where they are not\n",
      "meant to be, and that sort of thing. However great the skill with which this is done,\n",
      "the results are never quite …”\n",
      "His discourse was cut short by an outburst of rage from Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘Take that boy out of here!’\n",
      "Bao-yu fled.\n",
      "‘Come back!’\n",
      "He returned.\n",
      "‘You still have to make a couplet on this place. If it isn’t satisfactory, you will find\n",
      "yourself reciting it to the tune of a slapped face!’\n",
      "Bao-yu stood quivering with fright and for some moments was unable to say\n",
      "anything. At last he recited the following couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Emergent buds swell where the washerwoman soaks her cloth.\n",
      "A fresh tang rises where the cress-gatherer fills his pannier.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng shook his head:\n",
      "‘Worse and worse.’\n",
      "He led them out of the ‘village’ and round the foot of the hill:\n",
      "through flowers and foliage,\n",
      "by rock and rivulet,\n",
      "past rose-crowned pergolas\n",
      "and rose-twined trellises,\n",
      "through small pavilions\n",
      "embowered in peonies,\n",
      "\f",
      "where scent of sweet-briers stole,\n",
      "or pliant plantains waved –\n",
      "until they came to a place where a musical murmur of water issued from a cave in\n",
      "the rock. The cave was half-veiled by a green curtain of creeper, and the water below\n",
      "was starred with bobbing blossoms.\n",
      "‘What a delightful spot!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘Very well, gentlemen.\n",
      "What are you going to call it?’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "Inevitably the literary gentlemen thought of Tao Yuan-?ming’s fisherman of Wu-ling\n",
      "and his Peach-blossom Stream.\n",
      "‘“The Wu-ling Stream”,’ said one of them. ‘The name is ready-made for this place.\n",
      "No need to look further than that.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng laughed:\n",
      "‘The same trouble again, I am afraid. It is the name of a real place. In any case, it is\n",
      "too hackneyed.’\n",
      "‘All right,’ said the others good-humouredly. ‘In that case simply call it “Refuge of\n",
      "the Qins”.’ Their minds still ran on the Peach-blossom Stream and its hidden paradise.\n",
      "‘That’s even more inappropriate!’ said Bao-yu. ‘“Refuge of the Qins” would imply\n",
      "that the people here were fugitives from tyranny. How can we possibly call it that? I\n",
      "suggest “Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour”.’\n",
      "‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. He looked inside the grotto and asked Cousin Zhen if\n",
      "there were any boats.\n",
      "‘Four punts for lotus-gathering and one for pleasure are on order,’ said Cousin Zhen,\n",
      "‘but they haven’t finished making them yet.’\n",
      "‘What a pity we cannot go through!’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "‘There is a very steep path over the top which would take us there,’ said Cousin\n",
      "Zhen, and proceeded to lead the way.\n",
      "The others scrambled up after him, clinging to creepers and leaning on tree-trunks as\n",
      "they went. When, having descended more, they had regained the stream it was wide\n",
      "and deep once and distorted by many anfractuosities. The fallen blossoms seemed to\n",
      "be even more numerous and the waters on whose surface they floated even more\n",
      "limpid than they had been on the side they had just come from. The weeping willows\n",
      "which lined both banks were here and there diversified with peach and apricot trees\n",
      "whose interlacing branches made little worlds of stillness and serenity beneath them.\n",
      "Suddenly, through the green of the willows, they glimpsed the scarlet balustrade of a\n",
      "wooden bridge whose sloping ramps led to a flat central span high above the water.\n",
      "When they had crossed it, they found a choice of paths leading to different parts of\n",
      "the garden. Ahead was an airy building with roofs of tile, whose elegant surrounding\n",
      "wall was of grey-plastered brick pierced by ornamental grilles made of semi-circular\n",
      "\f",
      "tiles laid together in openwork patterns. The wall was so constructed that outcrops\n",
      "of rock from the garden’s ‘master mountain’ appeared to run through it in several\n",
      "places into the courtyard inside.\n",
      "‘This building seems rather out of place here,’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "But as he entered the gate the source of his annoyance dis?appeared; for a miniature\n",
      "mountain of rock, whose many holes and fissures, worn through it by weathering or\n",
      "the wash of waters, bestowed on it a misleading appearance of fragile delicacy,\n",
      "towered up in front of him and combined with the many smaller rocks of various\n",
      "shapes and sizes which sur?rounded it to efface from their view every vestige of the\n",
      "build?ing they had just been looking at.\n",
      "Not a single tree grew in this enclosure, only plants and herbs:\n",
      "some aspired as vines,\n",
      "some crept humbly on the ground;\n",
      "some grew down from the tops of rocks,\n",
      "some upwards from their feet;\n",
      "some hung from the eaves in waving trails of green,\n",
      "some clung to pillars in circling bands of gold;\n",
      "some had blood-red berries,\n",
      "some had golden flowers.\n",
      "And from every flower and every plant and every herb wafted the most exquisite and\n",
      "incomparable fragrances.\n",
      "Jia Zheng could not help but admire:\n",
      "‘Charming! But what are they all?’\n",
      "‘Wild-fig’ and ‘wistaria’ was all the literary gentlemen would venture.\n",
      "‘But surely,’ Jia Zheng objected, ‘wild-fig and wisteria do not have this delectable\n",
      "fragrance?’\n",
      "‘They certainly don’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are wild-fig and wisteria among the\n",
      "plants growing here, but the ones with the fragrance are pollia and birthwort and --\n",
      "yes, I think those are orchids of some kind. That one over there is probably actinidia.\n",
      "The red flowers are, of course, rue, the “herb of grace”, and the green ones must be\n",
      "green-flag. A lot of these rare plants are mentioned in Li sao and Wen xuan,\n",
      "particularly in the Poetical Descriptions of the Three Capitals by Zuo Si. For example,\n",
      "in his Description of the Wu Capital he has\n",
      "\n",
      "agastache, eulalia,\n",
      "and harsh-smelling ginger-bush,\n",
      "cord-flower, cable-flower,\n",
      "centaury and purplestrife,\n",
      "\f",
      "stone-sail and water-pine\n",
      "and sweet-scented eglantine...\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there are\n",
      "\n",
      "amaranth, xanthoxylon,\n",
      "anemone, phellopteron...\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in the Description of the Shu Capital. Of course, after all these centuries\n",
      "nobody really knows what all those names stand for. They apply them quite\n",
      "arbitrarily to whatever seem to fit the description, and gradually all of them—’\n",
      "Once more an angry shout from his father cut him short:\n",
      "‘Who asked for your opinion?’\n",
      "Bao-yu shrank back and said no more.\n",
      "Observing that there were balustraded loggias on either side of the court, Jia Zheng\n",
      "led his party through one of them towards the building at the rear. It was a cool,\n",
      "five-frame gallery with a low, roofed verandah running round it on all sides. The\n",
      "window-lattices were green and tile walls freshly painted. It was a building of quite\n",
      "another order of elegance from the ones they had so far visited.\n",
      "‘Anyone who sat sipping tea and playing the qin to himself on this verandah would\n",
      "have no need to burn incense if he wanted sweet smells for his inspiration,’ said Jia\n",
      "Zheng dreamily. ‘So unexpectedly beautiful a place calls for a specially beautiful\n",
      "name to adorn it.’\n",
      "‘What could be better than “Dewy Orchids”?’ said the literary gentleman.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘That would do for the name. Now what about the couplet?’\n",
      "‘I have thought of a couplet,’ said one of the gentlemen. ‘Tell me all of you what\n",
      "you think of it:\n",
      "\n",
      "A musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard.\n",
      "A sweet aroma of galingale floats over the moonlit island.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not bad,’ said the others. ‘But why “sunset courtyard”?’\n",
      "‘I was thinking of that line in the old poem,’ said the man:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The garden’s gillyflowers at sunset weep.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, you have already got “dewy” in the name. I thought the “sunset weeping”\n",
      "would go with it rather well.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Feeble! Feeble!’ cried the rest.\n",
      "‘I’ve thought of a couplet, too,’ said one of the others. ‘Let me have your opinion of\n",
      "it:\n",
      "\n",
      "Down garden walks a fragrant breeze caresses beds of melilot.\n",
      "By courtyard walls a brilliant moon illumines golden orchises.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng stroked his beard, and his lips were observed to move as though he was on\n",
      "the point of proposing a couplet of his own. Suddenly, looking up, he caught sight of\n",
      "Bao-yu skulking behind the others, too scared to speak.\n",
      "‘What’s the matter with you?’ he bellowed at the unfortu?nate boy. ‘You are ready\n",
      "enough with your opinions when they are not wanted. Speak up! —Or are you\n",
      "waiting for a written invitation?’\n",
      "‘I can see no “musk” or “moonlight” or “islands” in this place,’ said Bao-yu, ‘If we\n",
      "are to make couplets in this follow-my-leader fashion, we could turn out a couple of\n",
      "hundred of them and still have more to come.’\n",
      "‘No one’s twisting your arm,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You don’t have to use those words if\n",
      "you don’t want to.’\n",
      "‘In that case,’ said Bao-yu, ‘I suggest “The Garden of Spices” for the name; and for\n",
      "the couplet:\n",
      "\n",
      "Composing amidst cardamoms, you shall make verses like flowers.\n",
      "Slumbering amidst the roses, you shall dream fragrant dreams.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We all know where you got that from,’ said Jia zheng:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Composing midst the plantains\n",
      "Green shall my verses be.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can’t give you much credit for an imitation.’\n",
      "‘Not at all!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘There is nothing wrong with imitation\n",
      "provided it is done well. After all, Li Bo’s poem “On Phoenix Terrace” is entirely based\n",
      "on Cui Hao’s “Yellow Crane Tower”, yet it is a much better poem. On reflection our\n",
      "young friend’s couplet seems more poetical and imaginative than the original.’\n",
      "‘Oh, come now!’ said Jia Zheng. But they could see he was not displeased.\n",
      "Leaving the place of many fragrances behind them, they had not advanced much\n",
      "further when they could see ahead of them a building of great magnificence which\n",
      "Jia Zheng at once identified as the main reception hall of the Residence.\n",
      "\f",
      "Roof above roof soared,\n",
      "Eye up-compelling,\n",
      "Of richly-wrought chambers\n",
      "And high winding galleries.\n",
      "Green rafts of dark pine\n",
      "Brushed the eaves’ edges.\n",
      "Milky magnolias\n",
      "Bordered the buildings.\n",
      "Gold-glinting cat-faces,\n",
      "Rainbow-hued serpents’ snouts\n",
      "Peered out or snarled down\n",
      "From cornice and finial.\n",
      "‘It is rather a showy building,’ said Jia Zheng. But the literary gentlemen reassured\n",
      "him:\n",
      "‘Although Her Grace is a person of simple and abstemious tastes, the exalted\n",
      "position she now occupies makes it only right and proper that there should be a\n",
      "certain amount of pomp in her reception. This building is in no way excessive.’\n",
      "Still advancing in the same direction, they presently found themselves at the foot of\n",
      "the white marble memorial arch which framed the approach to the hall. The pattern\n",
      "of writhing dragons protectively crouched over its uppermost horizontal was so\n",
      "pierced and fretted by the sculptor’s artistry as to resemble lacework rather than\n",
      "solid stone.\n",
      "‘What inscription do we want on this arch?’ Jia Zheng inquired.\n",
      "‘“Peng-lai’s Fairy Precincts” is the only name that would do it justice,’ said the\n",
      "literary gentlemen.\n",
      "Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing.\n",
      "The sight of this building and its arch had inspired a strange and unaccountable stir of\n",
      "emotion in Bao-yu which on reflec?tion he interpreted as a sign that he must have\n",
      "known a build?ing somewhat like this before -- though where or when he could not\n",
      "for the life of him remember. He was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded\n",
      "him of; when Jia Zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch, and\n",
      "he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composi?tion. The literary\n",
      "gentlemen, not knowing the nature of his preoccupation, supposed that his father’s\n",
      "incessant bullying had worn him out and that he had finally come to the end of his\n",
      "inspiration. They feared that further bullying might once more bring out the mulish\n",
      "streak in him, thereby provoking an explosion which would be distasteful for\n",
      "everybody. Accordingly they urged Jia Zheng to allow him a day’s grace in which to\n",
      "produce something suitable. Jia Zheng, who was secretly beginning to be\n",
      "\f",
      "apprehensive about the possible consequences of Grandmother Jia’s anxiety for her\n",
      "darling grand?son, yielded, albeit with a bad grace:\n",
      "‘Jackanapes! So even you have your off moments it seems. Well, I’ll give you a day\n",
      "to do it in. But woe betide you if you can’t produce something tomorrow! And it had\n",
      "better be something good, too, because this is the most important building in the\n",
      "garden.’\n",
      "After they had seen over the building and come out again, they stopped for a while\n",
      "on the terrace to look at a general view of the whole garden and attempted to make\n",
      "out the places they had already visited. They were surprised to find that even now\n",
      "they had covered little more than half of the whole area. Just at that moment a\n",
      "servant came up to report that someone had arrived with a message from Yu-cun.\n",
      "‘I can see that we shan’t be able to finish today,’ said Jia Zheng. However, if we go\n",
      "out by the way I said, we should at least be able to get some idea of the general\n",
      "layout.’\n",
      "He conducted them to a large bridge above a crystal curtain of rushing water. It was\n",
      "the weir through which the water from the little river which fed all the pools and\n",
      "watercourses of the garden ran into it from outside. Jia Zheng invited them to name\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is the source of the “Drenched Blossoms” stream we looked at earlier on,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu. ‘We should call it “Drenched Blossoms Weir”.’\n",
      "‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You may as well forget about your “Drenched Blossoms”,\n",
      "because we are not going to use that name!’\n",
      "Their progress continued past many unexplored features of the garden, viz:\n",
      "a summer lodge\n",
      "a straw-thatched cot\n",
      "a dry-stone wall\n",
      "a flowering arch\n",
      "a tiny temple nestling beneath a hill\n",
      "a nun’s retreat hidden in a little wood\n",
      "a straight gallery\n",
      "a crooked cave\n",
      "a square pavilion\n",
      "and a round belvedere.\n",
      "But Jia Zheng hurried past every one of them without enter?ing. However, he had\n",
      "now been walking for a very long time without a rest and was beginning to feel\n",
      "somewhat footsore; and so, when the next building appeared through the trees\n",
      "ahead, he proposed that they should go in and sit down, and led his party towards it\n",
      "\f",
      "by the quickest route possible. They had to walk round a stand of double-flowering\n",
      "ornamental peach-trees and through a circular opening in a flower-covered bamboo\n",
      "trellis. This brought them in sight of the building’s whitewashed enclosing wall and\n",
      "the contrasting green of the weeping willows which surrounded it. A roofed gallery\n",
      "ran from each side of the gate round the inner wall of the fore?court, in which a few\n",
      "rocks were scattered. On one side of it some green plantains were growing and on\n",
      "the other a weeping variety of Szechwan crab, whose pendant clusters of\n",
      "double-flowering carmine blossoms hung by stems as delicate as golden wires on the\n",
      "umbrella-shaped canopy of its boughs.\n",
      "‘What magnificent blossom!’ exclaimed the literary gentle?men. ‘One has seen\n",
      "plenty of crab-apple blossom before, but never anything as beautiful as this.’\n",
      "‘This kind is called “maiden crab”,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It comes from abroad. According\n",
      "to vulgar belief it originally came from the Land of Maidens, and that is supposed to\n",
      "be the reason why it blooms so profusely. Needless to say, it is only the ignorant sort\n",
      "of persons who hold this ridiculous belief.’\n",
      "‘It certainly has most unusual blossoms,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Who knows,\n",
      "perhaps there is something in the popular belief.’\n",
      "‘Surely,’ said Bao-yu, ‘it is much more probable that poets and painters gave it the\n",
      "name of “maiden crab” because of its rouge-like colour and delicate, drooping shape,\n",
      "and that the name was misunderstood by ignorant, literal-minded people, who made\n",
      "up this silly story to account for it.’\n",
      "‘That must be it!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Most grate?ful for the explanation!’\n",
      "While they were speaking they were at the same time arranging themselves on some\n",
      "benches in the gallery.\n",
      "‘Has anyone an original idea for a name?’ said Jia Zheng when they were all seated.\n",
      "One of them proposed ‘Storks in the Plantains’. Another suggested ‘Shimmering\n",
      "Splendour’.\n",
      "“‘Shimmering Splendour”,’ Jia Zheng and the others repeated, trying out the words.\n",
      "‘That’s good!’\n",
      "‘A lovely name!’ said Bao-yu. But a moment later he added: ‘Rather a pity, though.’\n",
      "‘Why “rather a pity”?’ they asked.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘there are both plantains and crab-apple blossom in this\n",
      "courtyard. Whoever planted them must have been thinking of “the red and the\n",
      "green”. If our name men?tions only one and leaves out the other, it will seem\n",
      "somehow inadequate.’\n",
      "‘What do you suggest, then?’ said Jia Zheng.\n",
      "       ‘I suggest “Fragrant Red and Lucent Green”,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That takes account\n",
      "of both of them.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Jia zheng shook his head:\n",
      "‘No, that’s no good!’\n",
      "He led them inside the building. Its interior turned out to be all corridors and alcoves\n",
      "and galleries, so that properly speaking it could hardly have been said to have rooms\n",
      "at all. The partition walls which made these divisions were of wooden panelling\n",
      "exquisitely carved in a wide variety of motifs: bats in clouds, the ‘three friends of\n",
      "winter’—pine, plum and bamboo, little figures in landscapes, birds and flowers,\n",
      "scrollwork, antique bronze shapes, ‘good luck’ and ‘long life’ characters, and many\n",
      "others. The carvings, all of them the work of master craftsmen, were beautified with\n",
      "inlays of gold, mother-o’-pearl and semi-precious stones. In addition to being\n",
      "panelled, the partitions were pierced by numerous apertures, some round, some\n",
      "square, some sun-flower-shaped, some shaped like a fleur-de-lis, some cusped, some\n",
      "fan-shaped. Shelving was concealed in the double thick?ness of the partition at the\n",
      "base of these apertures, making it possible to use them for storing books and writing\n",
      "materials and for the display of antique bronzes, vases of flowers, miniature\n",
      "tray-gardens and the like. The overall effect was at once richly colourful and, because\n",
      "of the many apertures, airy and graceful.\n",
      "The trompe-l’ail effect of these ingenious partitions had been further enhanced by\n",
      "inserting false windows and doors in them, the former covered in various pastel\n",
      "shades of gauze, the latter hung with richly-patterned damask portieres. The main\n",
      "walls were pierced with window-like perforations in the shape of zithers, swords,\n",
      "vases and other objects of virtù.\n",
      "The literary gentlemen were rapturous:\n",
      "‘Exquisite!’ they cried. ‘what marvellous workmanship!’\n",
      "Jia Zheng, after taking no more than a couple of turns inside this confusing interior,\n",
      "was already lost. To the left of him was what appeared to be a door. To the right was\n",
      "a wall with a window in it. But on raising its portiere he discovered the door to be a\n",
      "bookcase; and when, looking back, he observed— what he had not noticed before—\n",
      "that the light coming in through the silk gauze of the window illuminated a\n",
      "passage-way lead?ing to an open doorway, and began walking towards it, a party of\n",
      "gentlemen similar to his own came advancing to meet him, and he realized that he\n",
      "was walking towards a large mirror. They were able to circumvent the mirror, but\n",
      "only to find an even more bewildering choice of doorways on the other side.\n",
      "‘Come!’ said Cousin Zhen with a laugh. ‘Let me show you the way! If we go out\n",
      "here we shall be in the back courtyard. We can reach the gate of the garden much\n",
      "more easily from the back courtyard than from the front.’\n",
      "He led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed, then through a door into a\n",
      "garden full of rambler roses. Behind the rose-trellis was a stream running between\n",
      "\f",
      "green banks. The literary gentlemen were intrigued to know where the water came\n",
      "from. Cousin Zhen pointed in the direction of the weir they had visited earlier:\n",
      "‘The water comes in over that weir, then through the grotto, then under the lea of\n",
      "the north-east “mountain” to the little farm. There a channel is led off it which runs\n",
      "into the south-east corner of the garden. Then it runs round and rejoins the main\n",
      "stream here. And from here the water flows out again underneath that wall.’\n",
      "‘How very ingenious!’\n",
      "They moved on again, but soon found themselves at the foot of a tall ‘mountain’.\n",
      "‘Follow me!’ said Cousin Zhen, amused at the bewilder?ment of the others, who\n",
      "were now completely at sea as to their whereabouts. He led them round the foot of\n",
      "the ‘mountain’—and there, miraculously, was a broad, flat path and the gate by\n",
      "which they had entered, rising majestically in front of them.\n",
      "‘Well!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen. ‘This beats everything! The skill with\n",
      "which this has all been designed is quite out of this world!’\n",
      "Whereupon they all went out of the garden.\n",

      "Bao-yu was now longing to get back to the girls, but as no dis?missal was\n",
      "forthcoming from his father, he followed him along with the others into his study.\n",
      "Fortunately Jia Zheng suddenly recollected that Bao-yu was still with him:\n",
      "‘Well, run along then! Your grandmother will be worrying about you. I take it you’re\n",
      "not still waiting for more?’\n",
      "At last Bao-yu could withdraw. But as soon as he was in the courtyard outside, he was\n",
      "waylaid by a group of Jia Zheng’s pages who laid hands on him and prevented him\n",
      "from going.\n",
      "‘You’ve done well today, haven’t you, coming out top with all those poems? You\n",
      "have us to thank for that! Her Old Ladyship sent round several times asking about\n",
      "you, but because the Master was so pleased with you, we told her not to worry. If we\n",
      "hadn’t done that, you wouldn’t have had the chance to show off your poems!\n",
      "Everyone says they were better than all the others. What about sharing your good\n",
      "luck with us?’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed good-naturedly.\n",
      "‘All right. A string of cash each.’\n",
      "‘Who wants a measly string of cash? Give us that little purse you’re wearing!’ And\n",
      "without a ‘by your leave’ they began to despoil him, beginning with the purse and his\n",
      "fan-case, of all his trinkets, until every one of the objects he carried about him had\n",
      "been taken from him.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Now,’ they said, ‘we’ll see you back in style!’\n",
      "And closing round him, they marched him back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment in\n",
      "triumphal procession.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia had been waiting for him with some anxiety, and was naturally\n",
      "delighted to see him come in apparently none the worse for his experience.\n",
      "Soon after, when he was back in his own room, Aroma came in to pour him some tea\n",
      "and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had\n",
      "disappeared.\n",
      "‘Where have the things from your belt gone?’ she said. ‘I suppose those worthless\n",
      "pages have taken them again.’\n",
      "Dai-yu overheard her and came up to inspect. Sure enough, not one of the things\n",
      "was there.\n",
      "‘So you’ve given away that little purse I gave you? Very well, then. You needn’t\n",
      "expect me to give you anything in future, however much you want it!’\n",
      "With these words she went off to her own room in a temper, and taking up a still\n",
      "unfinished perfume sachet which she was making for him at his own request, she\n",
      "began to cut it up with her embroidery scissors. Bao-yu, observing that she was angry,\n",
      "had hurried after her—but it was too late. The sachet was already cut to pieces.\n",
      "Although it had not been finished, Bao-yu could see that the embroidery was very\n",
      "fine, and it made him angry to think of the hours and hours of work so wantonly\n",
      "destroyed. Tearing open his collar he took out the little embroidered purse which had\n",
      "all along been hanging round his neck and held it out for her to see.\n",
      "‘Look! What’s that? When have I ever given anything of yours to someone else?’\n",
      "Dai-yu knew that he must have treasured her gift to have worn it inside his clothing\n",
      "where there was no risk of its being taken from him. She regretted her over-hasty\n",
      "destruction of the sachet and hung her head in silence.\n",
      "‘You needn’t have cut it up,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know it’s only because you hate giving\n",
      "things away. Here, you can have this back too since you’re so stingy!’\n",
      "He tossed the purse into her lap and turned to go. Dai-yu burst into tears of rage, and\n",
      "picking up the little purse, attacked that too with her scissors. Bao-yu hurried back\n",
      "and caught her by the wrist.\n",
      "‘Come, cuzzy dear!’ he said with a laugh. ‘Have mercy on it!’\n",
      "Dai-yu threw down the scissors and wiped her streaming eyes.\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t blow hot and cold by turns. If you want to quarrel, let’s quarrel\n",
      "properly and have nothing to do with each other!’\n",
      "She got up on the kang in a great huff, and turning her back on him, sobbed into her\n",
      "handkerchief and affected to ignore his presence. But Bao-yu got up beside her, and\n",
      "with many soothing words and affectionate endearments humbly en?treated her\n",
      "\f",
      "forgiveness.\n",
      "Meanwhile in the front room Grandmother Jia was calling loudly for her beloved\n",
      "grandson.\n",
      "‘Master Bao is in the back with Miss Lin,’ they told her.\n",
      "‘Ah, good!’ said the old lady. ‘Let us leave them alone together, then. it will be a\n",
      "nice relaxation for him after the strain of being so long with his father -- as long as\n",
      "they don’t argue.’\n",
      "‘Yes, milady.’\n",
      "Finding herself unable to shake off Bao-yu’s attentions, Dai-yu got up from the kang:\n",
      "‘I can see you are determined not to let me live in peace. I shall just have to go\n",
      "elsewhere.’ And off she went.\n",
      "‘Wherever you go, I shall go with you,’ said Bao-yu, taking up the purse and\n",
      "beginning to fasten it on again. But Dai-yu snatched it away from him.\n",
      "‘First you say you don’t want it, and now you are trying to put it on again. You\n",
      "ought to be ashamed of yourself!’\n",
      "Her anger dissolved in a little explosion of laughter.\n",
      "‘Dearest cuzzy!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Won’t you please make me another sachet?’\n",
      "‘That depends on whether I feel in the mood or not,’ said Dai-yu.\n",
      "Chatting together they went out of the room and round to Lady Wang’s apartment.\n",
      "Bao-chai was there already. They found everyone there in a state of great excitement\n",
      "owing to the fact that Jia Qiang had lust arrived back from Soochow with the twelve\n",
      "child-actresses he had purchased there, to?gether with their instructors and all the\n",
      "costumes and proper?ties they would use in performing their plays.\n",
      "Aunt Xue had now moved to a quiet, secluded apartment m the north-east corner of\n",
      "the mansion, and Pear-tree Court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama\n",
      "school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges. A number\n",
      "of female members of the Rong-guo staff who had some previous training in singing\n",
      "and acting—they were all grey-haired old women by now—were put in charge of the\n",
      "domestic arrangements. Pay and expenses and the provision of whatever was\n",
      "needed for the maintenance of the troupe was to remain in the hands of Jia Qiang,\n",
      "who was also to keep the accounts.\n",
      "Simultaneously with this arrival, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife had come to announce that the\n",
      "selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns—twelve Buddhist and twelve\n",
      "Taoist—had been successfully accomplished. Even the twenty-four little habits they\n",
      "would wear had now arrived brand-new from the tailor. But that was not all. It\n",
      "appeared that a young lady who had entered the church under half vows as an\n",
      "‘unshaved nun’ might be persuaded to loin them.\n",
      "‘She comes of a highly educated official family from Soo?chow,’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife\n",
      "\f",
      "told them. ‘As a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of\n",
      "“proxy novices” in the hope that she would get better; but all was of no avail. In the\n",
      "end there was nothing for it but for the young lady to take the great step herself --\n",
      "though as a lay sister, without the shaving of hair. And sure enough her illness got\n",
      "better immediately. She is now eighteen years of age. Her name in religion is\n",
      "“Adamantina”. She lost both her parents some time ago and has only two old nurses\n",
      "and a little maid to look after her. She’s said to be a great clerk and knows all the\n",
      "classics by heart. What’s more, she is a very handsome young woman. She moved\n",
      "into this area with her teacher a year ago because of some relic of Guanyin she had\n",
      "heard about and because there are some old Sanskrit texts here that she wanted to\n",
      "look at. She has been living ever since in the Sakyamuni Convent outside the west\n",
      "gate. Her teacher was a great authority on the “Primordial” branch of the Tantra. She\n",
      "died last winter. As she lay dying she told Adamantina that she was not to go back\n",
      "home, but to wait here quietly for a call. That is why she stays on here and has never\n",
      "taken her teacher’s coffin back.’\n",
      "‘We should certainly take advantage of this to invite her here,’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘We have tried asking her,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, ‘but the reply she gives is that\n",
      "noble households are given to trampling on other people’s feelings, and she is not\n",
      "disposed to be trampled on.’\n",
      "‘She is bound to be rather a ‘proud young woman, coming from a family of\n",
      "officials,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t see why we shouldn’t make out a written invitation\n",
      "and request her formally.’\n",
      "Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife promised to see this done and hurried off to ask one of the\n",
      "professional letter-writers in the family’s employment to make out a formal invitation.\n",
      "Next day a carriage was sent round to fetch Adamantina to the mansion in a style\n",
      "befitting a young gentlewoman of tender suscepti?bilities.\n",
      "But as to what happened thereafter: that will be disclosed in the ensuing chapter.\n",

      "Just at that moment a servant came in to say that the workmen needed some gauze\n",
      "for pasting on window-lattices and asked Xi-feng if she would unlock the storeroom\n",
      "for them. Then another servant arrived and asked her to take charge of some gold\n",
      "and silver plate. Lady Wang and her maids also seemed to be fully occupied.\n",
      "Thoughtful Bao-chai pointed out to Bao-yu and the rest that they were getting in\n",
      "everyone’s way, and at her suggestion they all adjourned to Ying-chun’s room.\n",
      "Lady Wang’s business in fact continued unabated until well into the tenth month. By\n",
      "then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the various buildings in the\n",
      "garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques; supplies of\n",
      "livestock—storks, deer, rabbits, chicken, geese, and so forth--had been purchased\n",
      "and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared; Jia Qiang’s\n",
      "young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces;\n",
      "and the little Buddhist and Taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their\n",
      "respective liturgies. Jia Zheng could now feel reasonably well satisfied that things\n",
      "were as they should be, and invited Grandmother Jia into the garden for a final\n",
      "\f",
      "inspection in which she was to suggest any last-minute alterations that might still be\n",
      "needed. When not the slightest shadow of an imperfection could any more be found,\n",
      "he at last sent in his written application for a Visitation. The Gracious Reply arrived\n",
      "on the very same day:\n",

      "Her Grace will make a Family Visitation next year on the fif?teenth of the first month,\n",

      "The receipt of this reply seemed to throw the Jia family into an even greater frenzy of\n",
      "preparation than before, so that even its New Year celebrations that year were\n",
      "somewhat scamped.\n",
      "In no time at all the Festival of Lanterns seemed to be almost upon them. On the\n",
      "eighth of the first month a eunuch came from the Palace to inspect the layout of the\n",
      "Separate Residence and to establish where the Imperial Concubine would ‘change\n",
      "her clothes’, where she would sit to converse with her family, where she would\n",
      "receive their obeisances, where she would feast them, and where she would retire to\n",
      "when she wanted to rest. The eunuch Chief of Security also arrived with his eunuch\n",
      "minions and supervised a great deal of sealing-up and screening-off everywhere. He\n",
      "also instructed the members of the household in the regulations for leaving and\n",
      "entering, serving food and bringing messages, all of which had to be done through\n",
      "special entrances and exits and by special routes.\n",
      "Outside the mansion the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and a\n",

      "suspicious-looking characters.\n",
      "Meanwhile Jia She and the consortium were putting up ornamental lanterns\n",
      "everywhere in the gardens and fixing fireworks in place for a pyrotechnic display in\n",
      "honour of the visit. By the fourteenth everything was finally ready. No one in the Jia\n",
      "household, whether master or servant, had a wink of sleep throughout the whole of\n",
      "that night.\n",
      "By five o’clock next morning, when it was still dark night outside, all those in the\n",
      "family from Grandmother Jia down?wards who held any sort of rank or title were\n",
      "already dressed in full court rig. In the Separate Residence\n",
      "    painted phoenix and coiling dragon\n",
      "         flapped and fluttered on drapes and curtains,\n",
      "         gold and silver-work gleamed and glinted,\n",

      "Jia She and the other menfolk drew themselves up outside the west gate.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia stood outside the main gate with the female members of the family.\n",
      "They noticed that the ends of the street and the entrances of the side-streets leading\n",
      "into it had all been screened off.\n",
      "Just as they were beginning to grow impatient, a eunuch trotted up on horseback\n",
      "and was stopped and questioned by Jia Zheng\n",
      "‘Oh, you’re much too early yet!’ said the eunuch. ‘Her Grace won’t be taking her\n",
      "lunch until one o’clock; then at two she goes to divine service in the Bao-ling chapel.\n",
      "Five o’clock, when she has an appointment to feast with the Emperor in the Da-ming\n",

      "‘Well,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when she heard this, ‘you and Aunt Wang\n",
      "may as well go back to your room. You will be able to come back later on nearer the\n",
      "time.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and the other ladies took her advice and went off, leaving Xi-feng to\n",
      "attend to whatever still needed doing in the garden. Under her direction some of the\n",
      "stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine, while other\n",
      "servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden’s many\n",
      "lanterns with.\n",
      "Suddenly, as afternoon drew towards evening, a clatter of many hooves was heard,\n",
      "and after a short pause, a group of ten or so eunuchs rushed in out of breath,\n",
      "clapping their hands as they ran. This was taken by the other eunuchs as a sign that\n",
      "the Imperial Concubine was on her way, for they at once jumped up and hurried to\n",
      "their prearranged places. The family, too, took up their positions once more, Jia She\n",
      "and the menfolk outside the west gate and Grandmother Jia with the ladies outside\n",
      "the main entrance.\n",
      "For a long time there was total silence. Then a couple of eunuchs on horseback came\n",
      "riding very, very slowly up to the west gate. Dismounting, they led their horses out of\n",
      "sight behind the cloth screens, then returned to take up their stand at the sides of\n",
      "the road, half-facing towards the west. After a considerable wait, two more eunuchs\n",
      "arrived and went through the same motions as the first pair. Then another two, and\n",
      "then another, until in all some ten pairs were standing at the sides of the road, their\n",
      "faces turned expectantly towards the west.\n",
      "Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine’s procession\n",
      "\f",
      "at last came in sight.\n",
      "First came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners.\n",
      "Then several more pairs with ceremonial pheasant-feather fans.\n",
      "Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special ‘palace incense’ was\n",
      "burning.\n",
      "Next came a great gold-coloured ‘seven-phoenix’ umbrella of state, hanging from its\n",
      "curve-topped shaft like a great drooping bell-flower. In its shadow was borne the\n",
      "Imperial Concubine’s travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes.\n",
      "Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered\n",
      "handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items.\n",
      "Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped palanquin\n",
      "with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders\n",
      "of eight eunuch bearers.\n",
      "As Grandmother Jia and the rest dropped to their knees eunuchs rushed up and\n",
      "helped them to get up again. The palanquin passed through the great gate and made\n",
      "for the entrance of a courtyard on the east side of the forecourt. There a eunuch\n",
      "knelt beside it and invited the Imperial Concubine to descend and ‘change her\n",
      "clothes’. The bearers carried it through the entrance and set it down just inside the\n",
      "courtyard. The other eunuchs then withdrew, leaving Yuan-chun’s ladies-in-waiting to\n",
      "help her from the palanquin.\n",
      "The courtyard she now stepped out into was brilliant with coloured lanterns of silk\n",
      "gauze cunningly fashioned in all sorts of curious and beautiful shapes and patterns.\n",
      "An illuminated sign hung over the entrance of the principal building:\n",
      "\n",
      "PILLED WITH FAVOURS BATHED IN BLESSINGS\n",
      "\n",
      "Yuan-chun passed beneath it into the room that had been prepared for her, then,\n",
      "having ‘changed her clothes’, came out again and stepped back into the palanquin,\n",
      "which was now borne into the garden.\n",
      "Her first impression was a confused one of curling drifts of incense smoke and\n",
      "gleaming colours. There were lanterns everywhere, and soft strains of music. She\n",
      "seemed to be enter?ing a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and\n",
      "luxury and delight. Looking at it from the depths of her palanquin she shook her head\n",
      "a little sadly and sighed:\n",
      "‘Oh dear, this is all so extravagant!’\n",
      "At that moment a eunuch knelt beside the palanquin and invited the Imperial\n",
      "Concubine to proceed by boat. Stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an\n",
      "expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon. Lanterns of\n",
      "\f",
      "crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks, their silvery\n",
      "radiance giving the white marble, in the semi-darkness, the appearance of gleaming\n",
      "drifts of snow. Because of the season, the willows and apricot trees above them were\n",
      "bare and leafless; but in place of leaves they were festooned with hundreds of tiny\n",
      "lanterns, and flowers of gauze, rice-paper and bast had been fastened to the tips of\n",
      "their branches. Other lanterns made of shells and feathers, in the form of lotuses,\n",
      "water-lilies, ducks and egrets floated on the surface of the water below. It would\n",
      "have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the\n",
      "more brilliant spectacle. Together they combined to make a fairyland of jewelled light.\n",
      "And to these visual delights were added the many charming miniature gardens on\n",
      "the barge itself—not to mention its pearl blinds, embroidered curtains, and the\n",
      "carved and painted oars and paddle with which it was furnished. While Yuan-chun\n",
      "was still admiring all this, her boat approached a landing-stage in a grotto, above\n",
      "which hung a lantern-sign inscribed with these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "SMARTWEED BANK AND FLOWERY HARBOUR\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone’s Note to Reader:\n",
      "You may find it surprising that ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’, ‘The Phoenix\n",
      "Dance’ and those other names, which in the last chapter we showed Bao-yu\n",
      "inventing in an aptitude test imposed at random by his father, should actually have\n",
      "been used on the occasion of the Imperial Concubine’s first visit to her family. Surely,\n",
      "you will say, a household as long established and highly cultivated as the Jias’ must\n",
      "have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon\n",
      "for such important purposes as these? These were no wealthy parvenus whose\n",
      "vulgarity would be satisfied with the effusions of a gifted schoolboy for filling in the\n",
      "gaps where inscription are felt to be de rigueur.\n",
      "The answer lies in Yuan-chun’s special relationship with Bao-yu. Before Yuan-chun\n",
      "entered the Palace, she had been brought up mainly by Grandmother Jia; and when\n",
      "Bao-yu appeared on the scene (at a time when his mother was already middle-aged\n",
      "and unlikely to have any more children) she had lavished all her affection on this little\n",
      "brother who spent all his time with her at their grandmother’s. When he was still a\n",
      "very little boy of only three or four and had not yet begun his schooling, she had\n",
      "taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters.\n",
      "Although they were brother and sister, their relationship was more like that of a\n",
      "mother and her son; and even after she entered the Palace, she was always writing\n",
      "letters to her father and her male cousins in which she expressed concern for the\n",
      "little boy who was so constantly in her thoughts. ‘I beg you to be most careful in your\n",
      "\f",
      "handling of this child,’ she once wrote. ‘If you are not strict with him, he will never\n",
      "grow up into a proper man. But if you are too strict, you may endanger his health and\n",
      "cause Grandmother to be distressed.’\n",
      "When, some months previously, Jia Zheng received a favourable report from Bao-yu’s\n",
      "schoolmaster in which his creative ability was commended, he had used the visit to\n",
      "the garden as a means of trying him out. The results were not, of course, what a\n",
      "great writer would have produced in similar circumstances, but at least they were not\n",
      "unworthy of the family’s literary traditions, and Jia Zheng resolved that his daughter\n",
      "should see them, so that she might know that the progress made by her beloved\n",
      "younger brother fully came up to the measure of those ardent hopes she had so\n",
      "often expressed in her letters.\n",
      "—Incidentally, Bao-yu had, in the intervening time, supplied many more inscriptions\n",
      "for the places they had been unable to cover on that first occasion.\n",
      "Stone\n",
      "\n",
      "When Yuan-chun saw the words ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’ she\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "‘Surely “Flowery Harbour” is enough by itself? Why “Smartweed Bank” as well?’\n",
      "At once an attendant eunuch disembarked and rushed like the wind to tell Jia Zheng,\n",
      "who\n",
      "immediately gave orders to have the inscription changed.\n",
      "By this time the barge had drawn alongside the bank and Yuan-chun disembarked\n",
      "and\n",
      "stepped once more into her palanquin. Soon she was borne into that part of the\n",
      "garden where\n",
      "‘Roof above roof soared\n",
      "Eye up-compelling ...’\n",
      "and saw the white marble memorial arch which had so strongly affected Bao-yu\n",
      "when he first saw it. It now bore a temporary inscription:\n",
      "\n",
      "PRECINCT OF THE CELESTIAL VISITANT\n",
      "\n",
      "Yuan-chun gave orders that the words ‘The House of Reunion’ should be substituted.\n",
      "She now ascended the terraces and entered the open-fronted hall of audience.\n",
      "From a ring of cressets against the night sky\n",
      "a fragrant scatter dropped on the flagstones;\n",
      "and candelabra like fiery fir-trees\n",
      "gleamed festively in the gilded casements;\n",
      "\f",
      "         there were blinds looped and fringed like a prawn’s belly,\n",
      "         there were rugs in rows like an otter’s offering;\n",
      "         and tripods smoked with perfumes of musk and borneol,\n",
      "         and behind the throne waved fans of pheasant feathers.\n",
      "It was a scene no whit less splendid than that fairy palace of which the poet sings:\n",
      "\n",
      "The abode of the Princess has cassia halls and orchid chambers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How is it that this place has no name?’ asked Yuan-chun.\n",
      "‘This is the principal hall of the Residence, Your Grace. The family dared not give it a\n",
      "name without consulting you first.\n",
      "Her Grace nodded.\n",
      "A eunuch Master of Ceremonies now requested her to seat herself upon a chair of\n",
      "state in order to receive the obeisances of her family. Music struck up from a band\n",
      "stationed at either side of the steps as two eunuchs conducted Jia She and Jia Zheng\n",
      "onto the terrace beneath. The other male members of the family ranged themselves\n",
      "behind them and the whole party then began to advance in formation up the steps\n",
      "into the hall.\n",
      "‘Excused!’\n",
      "A lady-in-waiting came forward and uttered this single word as an indication that the\n",
      "Imperial Concubine wished to absolve them from the ceremonial, and with a slight\n",
      "bow they with?drew.\n",
      "It was now the turn of Grandmother Jia (‘the Dowager Lady Jia of Rong-guo’ they\n",
      "called her) and the ladies of the household to make their obeisance. The eunuchs led\n",
      "them up the steps at the east side of the terrace on to the platform in front of the\n",
      "hall, where they ranged themselves in order of precedence.\n",
      "Once more the lady-in-waiting pronounced the absolving word and they, too,\n",
      "withdrew.\n",
      "After tea had been offered three times as etiquette prescribed, the Imperial\n",
      "Concubine descended from her throne, the music stopped, and she withdrew into a\n",
      "side room to ‘change her clothes’. A less formal carriage than the imperial palanquin\n",
      "had been prepared which carried her from the garden to her family’s own quarters.\n",
      "Inside Grandmother Jia’s apartment Yuan-chun became a grandchild once more and\n",
      "knelt down to make her kotow. But Grandmother Jia and the rest knelt down too and\n",
      "prevented her from prostrating herself. She ended up, clinging to Grandmother Jia by\n",
      "one hand and Lady Wang by the other, while the tears streamed down her face, too\n",
      "overcome to say anything. All three of them, in fact, though there was so much they\n",
      "wanted to say, seemed quite incapable of speech and stood there holding each other\n",
      "\f",
      "and sobbing, apparently un?able to stop. The others present— Lady Xing, Li Wan,\n",
      "Wang Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun—stood round them weeping silently.\n",
      "No one spoke a word.\n",
      "Yuan-chun at last restrained her sobs and forced a smile to her tear-stained face:\n",
      "‘It hasn’t been easy, winning this chance of coming back among you after all those\n",
      "years since I was first walled up in That Place. Now that we are seeing each other at\n",
      "last, we ought to talk and be cheerful, not waste all the time crying! I shall be leaving\n",
      "again in no time at all, and Heaven only knows when I shall have another chance of\n",
      "seeing you!’\n",
      "At this point she broke down once more and had to be comforted by Lady Xing.\n",
      "When she had composed herself, Grandmother Jia made her sit down while the\n",
      "members of the family came forward one at a time to greet her and say a few words.\n",
      "This was an occasion for further tears. Then the senior menservants of both the\n",
      "Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions assembled in the courtyard outside and paid their\n",
      "respects. They were followed by the women servants and maids, who were allowed\n",
      "to come inside the room to make their kotow.\n",
      "Yuan-chun asked why her Aunt Xue and her cousins Bao-chai and Lin Dai-yu were\n",
      "missing.\n",
      "‘Relations outside the Jia family are not allowed to see you without a special\n",
      "invitation, dear,’ Lady Wang told her.\n",
      "Yuan-chun asked them to be invited in immediately, and Aunt Xue and the two girls\n",
      "arrived after a few moments. They would have kotowed to her in accordance with\n",
      "court etiquette had not Yuan-chun hurriedly excused them from doing so. The three\n",
      "of them went up to her, and niece and aunt exchanged news of the years that had\n",
      "elapsed since they last met.\n",
      "Next Lutany and the other maids who had accompanied Yuan-chun into the Palace\n",
      "came forward to make their kotows to Grandmother Jia. The old lady at once\n",
      "motioned to them to rise and gave instructions to her own servants to entertain\n",
      "them in another room.\n",
      "The senior eunuchs and the ladies-in-waiting were now led off by members of the\n",
      "staffs of Jia She’s household and the Ning-guo mansion to be entertained elsewhere,\n",
      "leaving only three or four very junior eunuchs in attendance. Yuan-chun was at last\n",
      "free to chat informally with her mother and the other female members of her family\n",
      "and learned for the first time about many personal and domestic events that had\n",
      "occurred in the household since she left it.\n",
      "Then there was her interview with Jia Zheng, which had to take place with her father\n",
      "standing outside the door-curtain of the room in which she was sitting. Now that she\n",
      "was the Emperor’s woman, this was the nearest to her he could ever hope to get.\n",
      "\f",
      "The sense of deprivation struck home to Yuan-?chun as she addressed him through\n",
      "the curtain.\n",
      "‘What is the use of all this luxury and splendour,’ she said bitterly, ‘if I am to be\n",
      "always separated from those I love —denied the tenderness which even the poorest\n",
      "peasant who seasons his bread with salt and pickles and dresses in hempen\n",
      "homespun is free to enjoy?’\n",
      "With tears in his eyes the good man delivered the following little speech to the\n",
      "daughter he could not see:\n",
      "‘Madam.\n",
      "That a poor and undistinguished household such as ours should have produced, as it\n",
      "were, a phoenix from amidst a flock of crows and pies to bask in the sunshine of\n",
      "Imperial favour and shed its reflected beams on the departed representatives of our\n",
      "ancestral line must be attributable to the concentration in your single person of the\n",
      "quintessences of all that is most admirable in celestial and terrestrial nature and the\n",
      "accumulated merit of many generations of our forebears, and is an honour and a\n",
      "blessing in which my wife and I are proud to be participators.\n",
      "‘Our beloved Emperor, who embodies in his own Sacred Person those life-giving\n",
      "forces which are always invisibly at work in the natural cosmos, has showered down\n",
      "upon his grate?ful subjects a gracious kindness unprecedented in the annals of\n",
      "recorded history—a kindness which even the expenditure of our life’s blood to the\n",
      "veriest ultimate drop would be wholly inadequate to repay and which only the most\n",
      "unremitting pains and unswerving loyalty in the discharge of those duties to which it\n",

      "‘It is our earnest prayer that His Sacred Majesty may con?tinue long to reign over\n",
      "us, a blessing to all his peoples; and that Your Grace should feel no anxiety\n",
      "concerning the welfare of my wife and myself during our now declining years, but\n",
      "should rather cherish and sustain your own precious person, in order to be the better\n",
      "able to serve His Sacred Majesty with care and diligence, seeking by that service to\n",
      "be worthy of the tender regard and loving favour which he has been graciously\n",
      "pleased to bestow upon you.’\n",
      "To this formal speech the Imperial Concubine made a formal reply:\n",
      "‘Sir. It is of course desirable that you should exercise the utmost diligence when\n",
      "engaged upon business of state, but it is to be hoped that you will take sufficient care\n",
      "of your own well-being whenever not so engaged, and will under no circumstances\n",
      "vex yourself with anxiety on our behalf.’\n",
      "‘The inscriptions at present displayed on the pavilions and other buildings in the\n",
      "garden were composed by Bao-yu,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If there are any places in the\n",
      "garden which particularly take your fancy, we hope you will name them for us.’\n",
      "\f",
      "The news that Bao-yu could already compose inscriptions evoked a smile of pleasure.\n",
      "‘He has made progress, then!’\n",
      "Jia Zheng withdrew.\n",
      "‘But why is Bao-yu not with us?’ she added.\n",
      "‘The menfolk of the family are not supposed to see you without special reason,’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia explained.\n",
      "Yuan-hun at once gave orders that he should be summoned, and presently he was\n",
      "brought in by one of the little eunuchs. When he had completed his kotow she called\n",
      "him over, and stretching Out her arms, drew him to her bosom where she held him in\n",
      "a close embrace, stroking his hair and fondling the back of his neck.\n",
      "‘What a lot you have grown---!’ she began. But the rest was drowned in a flood of\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "You-shi and Xi-feng now approached to announce that a feast awaited her in the\n",
      "Separate Residence. Yuan-chun rose to her feet, and bidding Bao-yu lead the way,\n",
      "walked with the rest of the company to the gate of the garden. There, in the light of\n",
      "the innumerable lanterns, all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her\n",
      "entertainment. The route led through ‘The Phoenix Dance’, ‘Fragrant Red and Lucent\n",
      "Green’, ‘The Hopeful Sign’, and ‘The Garden of Spices’. This time the inspection was\n",
      "no perfunctory one. Yuan-chun insisted on looking inside the buildings and climbing\n",
      "up and down their stairs. She crossed bridges, she walked round each tiny ‘mountain’,\n",
      "and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view. All the\n",
      "places she visited were so beautifully furnished and so ingeniously planned, that she\n",
      "could not conceal her delight. But there was a faint note of censure in her praise\n",
      "‘You really mustn’t be so extravagant in future. This is far too much!’\n",
      "They had now come to the main hall. Having first decreed that they should dispense\n",
      "with court etiquette—which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting\n",
      "down at all—she took her place at the main table, while Grandmother Jia and the\n",
      "rest sat at little tables on either side, and You-shi, Li Wan and Xi-feng moved to and\n",
      "fro, dispensing wine and helping with the service.\n",
      "While they were still drinking, Yuan-chun sent for writing materials, and taking up a\n",
      "brush, began in her own hand to write out some names for the parts of the garden\n",
      "she had liked the best. The name she chose for the garden as a whole was ‘Prospect\n",
      "Garden’, and she composed the following couplet to go outside the main reception\n",
      "hall:\n",
      "\n",
      "For all earth to share, his great compassion has been extended,\n",
      "that children and humble folk may gratefully rejoice.\n",
      "For all ages to admire, his noble institutions have been promoted,\n",
      "\f",
      "that people of every land and clime may joyfully exult.\n",
      "\n",
      "She altered ‘The Phoenix Dance’ to ‘The Naiad’s House’, and she renamed ‘Fragrant\n",
      "Red and Lucent Green’ ‘Crimson Joys and Green Delights’ and named the building in\n",
      "its grounds ‘The House of Green Delights’. The buildings belonging to ‘The Garden of\n",
      "Spices’ she named ‘All-spice Court’. Those of ‘The Hopeful Sign’ she gave the name\n",
      "‘Washbrook Farm’. The main hall became ‘Prospect Hall’ with separate names for the\n",
      "high galleries on either side: ‘The Painted Chamber’ for the one on the east side, ‘The\n",
      "Fragrance Gallery’ for the one on the west. Among the other names which she\n",
      "invented for various other parts of the garden were:\n",
      "‘The Smartweed Loggia’, ‘The Lotus Pavilion’, ‘Amaryllis Eyot’, and ‘Duckweed\n",
      "Island’. She also composed inscrip?tions for some of its prospects, including\n",
      "‘Pear-tree blossom in springtime rain’, ‘Paulownia leaves in autumn wind’, and\n",
      "‘Rushes in the winter snow’. The couplets composed by Bao-yu were to remain\n",
      "unaltered.\n",
      "Having finished with the inscriptions, she proceeded to write out the following\n",
      "quatrain of her own composition:\n",
      "\n",
      "Embracing hills and streams, with skill they wrought:\n",
      "Their work at last is to perfection brought.\n",

      "‘There!’ she said with a smile to the girls. ‘I’m no genius, as you all well know, and I\n",
      "have never been much of a poet. But tonight I thought I really must write something,\n",
      "for this beautiful garden’s sake. Later on, when I have more time to spare, I intend to\n",
      "write a Description of Prospect Garden and a set of verses to be entitled The\n",
      "Visitation in commemoration of this wonderful night. But meanwhile I should like\n",
      "each of you girls to compose an inscription that could be used somewhere in the\n",
      "garden, and also a poem to go with it. Just write anything that comes into your heads.\n",
      "I don’t want you to restrict yourselves by trying to make your poems in any way\n",
      "relate to my own poor effort. As for Bao-yu: I am very pleased that he is able to\n",
      "compose verses so well, and I want him to write me an octet for each of the four\n",
      "places in the garden I like best: the Naiad’s House, All-spice Court - those are my two\n",
      "favourites—the House of Green Delights, and Washbrook Farm. The couplets he has\n",
      "already written for them are very good, but these are four such special places, that I\n",
      "feel they deserve to have something more written about them. And apart from that,\n",
      "if Bao-yu can show me these four poems while I am here, I shall feel that the efforts I\n",

      "ones wormed their way into the green-room to watch the excitement and get in the\n",
      "way of the actors. Bao-yu was left without a single one of them in attendance.\n",
      "Finding himself alone, he began thinking about a certain painting he remembered\n",
      "having seen in Cousin Zhen’s ‘smaller study’. It was a very life-like portrait of a\n",
      "beautiful woman. While everyone was celebrating, he reflected, she was sure to have\n",
      "been left on her own and would perhaps be feeling lonely. He would go and have a\n",
      "look at her and cheer her up.\n",
      "But as he approached the study, he experienced a sudden thrill of fright. A gentle\n",
      "moaning could be heard coming from inside it.\n",
      "‘Good gracious!’ he thought. ‘Can the woman in the painting really have come to\n",
      "life?’\n",
      "He made a tiny hole in the paper window with his tongue and peeped through. It was\n",
      "no painted lady he saw, stepped down from her hanging scroll upon the wall, but\n",
      "Tealeaf, pressed upon the body of a girl and evidently engaged in those exercises in\n",
      "which Bao-yu had once been instructed by the firry Disenchantment.\n",
      "‘Good lord!’\n",
      "He cried out involuntarily, and kicking open the door, strode into the study, so\n",
      "startling the two inside that they shook in their clothes. Seeing that it was Bao-yu,\n",
      "Tealeaf at once fell upon his knees and begged for mercy.\n",
      "‘In broad daylight!’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you think you’re at? If Mr Zhen got to\n",
      "hear of this, it would be more than your life is worth.’\n",
      "As he spoke, his eye fell upon the girl. She had a soft, white skin, to whose charms he\n",
      "could not be insensible. At the moment she was red to the very tips of her ears and\n",
      "stood there in silence, hanging her head with shame. Bao-yu stamped his foot\n",
      "impatiently:\n",
      "‘Why don’t you go?’\n",
      "The words seemed to bring her to herself, for she turned and fled immediately.\n",
      "Bao-yu ran after her, shouting.\n",
      "‘Don’t be afraid! I won’t tell anyone!’\n",
      "Tealeaf, running out behind him, was frantic:\n",
      "‘My dear little grandfather, that’s exactly what you are doing!’\n",
      "‘How old is she?’ Bao-yu asked him.\n",
      "‘Not more than fifteen or so,’ said Tealeaf.\n",
      "‘You don’t even know her age!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You can do this to her without even\n",
      "knowing her age! She’s wasted on you, that’s evident. Poor girl! What’s her name?’\n",
      "‘Ah now, that’s quite a story,’ said Tealeaf with a broad smile. ‘She says that just\n",
      "\f",
      "before she was born her mother dreamed she saw a beautiful piece of brocade,\n",
      "woven in all the colours of the rainbow, with a pattern of lucky swastikas all over it.\n",
      "So when she was born, she gave her the name “Swastika”.’\n",
      "Bao-yu smiled back.\n",
      "‘She ought to have a lucky future ahead of her, then. shall I ask them tomorrow if\n",
      "you can have her for your wife?’\n",
      "Tealeaf thought this was a huge joke.\n",
      "‘Why aren’t you watching the plays, Master Bao?’ he asked. ‘They’re ever so good!’\n",
      "‘I did watch for quite a while,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I got rather deafened and came out\n",
      "to walk around for a bit. That’s how I found you here. But what are we going to do\n",
      "now?’\n",
      "Tealeaf gave a sly little smile:\n",
      "‘What about going for a ride outside the city? If we slipped off quietly we could get\n",
      "there and back without anyone knowing.’\n",
      "‘Too risky,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We might get kidnapped or something. Besides, there\n",
      "would be terrible trouble if they found out. It’d better be somewhere nearer, so that\n",
      "we can get back quickly.’\n",
      "‘Who do we know near here that we could call on?’ said Tealeaf. ‘I can’t think of\n",
      "anyone.’\n",
      "‘I know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we go round to the Huas’ house and see what\n",
      "Aroma is up to?’\n",
      "‘All right. But I’ve forgotten where they live,’ said Tealeaf untruthfully. ‘And suppose\n",
      "they do find out you’ve been gadding around outside’ (he added the real reason for\n",
      "his hesitation) ‘they’ll say I put you up to it, and I shall get a beating.’\n",
      "‘I’ll see you don’t get into trouble,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Reassured, Tealeaf fetched the horse, and the two of them slipped out by the back\n",
      "entrance.\n",
      "Luckily the Huas’ house was only a few hundred yards from the Ning-guo mansion,\n",
      "and in no time at all they had reached its gate. Tealeaf entered first and called out the\n",
      "name of Aroma’s elder brother, Hua Zi-fang.\n",
      "Aroma’s mother was not long back from collecting the various nieces, on both her\n",
      "own and her late husband’s side of the family, who had had to be fetched after she\n",
      "had been to call for Aroma, and the family had only just settled down to their tea\n",
      "when they heard this voice outside calling for Hua Zi-fang. To the latter’s\n",
      "considerable surprise and mystification he found, on going outside to look, his\n",
      "sister’s young master waiting at the gate with a servant. Having first lifted Bao-yu off\n",
      "his horse, he went back into the courtyard and bawled to the rest inside:\n",
      "‘It’s Master Bao!’\n",
      "\f",
      "Aroma was dumbfounded and came running out to discover the cause of this\n",
      "unaccountable visit. As soon as she saw him she clung to him anxiously:\n",
      "‘What is it? Are you all right?’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed carelessly.\n",
      "‘I was just feeling bored, so I came over to see what you were up to.’\n",
      "‘Stupid!’ said Aroma, relieved to find that nothing was amiss. ‘What did you think I\n",
      "would be up to?’\n",
      "She turned to Tealeaf.\n",
      "‘Who else is with you?’\n",
      "‘Nobody,’ said Tealeaf with a grin. ‘Nobody else knows we’re here.’\n",
      "At this Aroma became alarmed once more.\n",
      "‘That’s terrible! Suppose you were to run into someone? Suppose you were to\n",
      "meet the Master?’ She glanced at Bao-yu fearfully. ‘In any case, the streets are so\n",
      "crowded now. You could easily get ridden down or something. It would be no joke if\n",
      "you were to have an accident. You two certainly have a nerve!’ She turned to Tealeaf\n",
      "again. ‘You put him up to this, didn’t you? Wait till I get back: I’ll tell his nannies\n",
      "about you. They’ll have you flogged like a felon, see if they don’t!’\n",
      "Tealeaf pulled a face.\n",
      "‘Don’t go trying to pin the blame on me! Master Bao was cursing and swearing at\n",
      "me to make me go with him. I kept telling him not to come. Anyway, we’d better be\n",
      "going back now, if that’s the way you feel!’\n",
      "‘You might as well stay, now you’re here,’ said Hua Zi-fang in a conciliatory manner.\n",
      "‘There’s no point in quarrelling about it. The only trouble is, this is not much of a\n",
      "place we live in here: poor and cramped and not too clean and that. Hardly a fit place\n",
      "for the likes of Master Bao, I’m thinking.’\n",
      "By this time Aroma’s mother had joined them outside to welcome the visitors. Aroma\n",
      "took Bao-yu by the hand and led him in. He saw four or five girls sitting down inside\n",
      "who hung their heads and blushed when he entered. Despite their blushes, Hua\n",
      "Zi-fang and his mother insisted that Bao-yu should get up on the kang with them, as\n",
      "they were afraid that he would find their house cold. Having installed him on the\n",
      "kang, they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pour?ing tea.\n",
      "‘Now don’t you two rush about, Mother,’ said Aroma. ‘I know how to look after him.\n",
      "There’s no point in your giving him a lot of things he won’t be able to eat.’\n",
      "As she said this, she took her own cushion that she had been sitting on, put it on top\n",
      "of a little short-legged kang table, and made Bao-yu sit on it with his feet on her\n",
      "metal foot-warmer. Then she took a couple of rose-shaped perfume lozenges from a\n",
      "little purse she was wearing, opened up her hand-warmer, popped the lozenges onto\n",
      "the burning charcoal, and closing it up again, stuffed it into the front of his gown.\n",
      "\f",
      "Having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction, she served\n",
      "him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup.\n",
      "Hua Zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea. The cakes,\n",
      "nuts and dried fruits were arranged on their plates, and the plates themselves on the\n",
      "table, with painstaking attention to symmetry and design. Aroma could tell at a\n",
      "glance that there was nothing there which Bao-yu could possibly be expected to eat.\n",
      "But her family must not be offended.\n",
      "‘Since you’ve decided to come,’ she said to Bao-yu with a smile. ‘we can’t let you go\n",
      "without having tasted something of ours. You’ll have to try something, just to be able\n",
      "to say that you have been our guest!’\n",
      "She took a handful of pine nuts from one of the dishes on the table, and blowing\n",
      "away the skins, handed them to him on her handkerchief.\n",
      "Bao-yu noticed that Aroma’s eyes were slightly red and that there were recent\n",
      "tear-stains on her powdered cheeks.\n",
      "‘Why have you been crying?’ He spoke the words in an undertone as she handed\n",
      "him the pine nuts.\n",
      "‘Who’s been crying?’ said Aroma with a feigned laugh. ‘I’ve lust been rubbing my\n",
      "eyes.’\n",
      "Her little fiction was successful, for he made no further comment.\n",
      "Bao-yu was wearing his dark-red gown with the pattern of golden dragons and white\n",
      "fox-fur lining, and a sable-lined slate-blue jacket with fringed edges.\n",
      "‘Fancy!’ said Aroma, ‘you got yourself all dressed up lust to come and see us. Didn’t\n",
      "anyone ask you where you were going?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Actually I changed because I was going to Cousin Zhen’s. He\n",
      "invited me over to watch the players.’\n",
      "Aroma nodded.\n",
      "‘You’d better go back after you’ve sat a bit longer,’ she said. ‘This is really no place\n",
      "for you here.’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t be too long, either,’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘I’ve got something\n",
      "nice waiting for you when you get back.’\n",
      "‘Sh!’ said Aroma. ‘Do you want them all to hear you?’\n",
      "As she said this, she reached out and took the Magic Jade from his neck.\n",
      "‘Here’s something that will interest you all,’ she said, holding it out to the others.\n",
      "‘You know how often you’ve spoken about that wonderful lade of Master Bao’s and\n",
      "said how much you’d give for a look at it? Well, here it is! Now you can look to your\n",
      "heart’s content. There you are, that’s all it is! Not so wonderful, really, is it?’\n",
      "They passed it from hand to hand, and when it had gone full circle and all had\n",
      "examined it, she hung it once more round his neck.\n",
      "\f",
      "Aroma told her elder brother to go out and hire the cleanest, smartest-looking cab he\n",
      "could find to take Bao-yu home in.\n",
      "‘I can see him safely back,’ said Hua Zi-fang. ‘He won’t come to any harm on\n",
      "horseback.’\n",
      "‘It’s not a question of whether he’ll come to any harm or not,’ said Aroma ‘I’m\n",
      "afraid someone might see him.’\n",
      "Hua Zi-fang hurried out to hire a cab. The rest of the com?pany, realizing that Bao-yu\n",
      "had no real business to be there, made no effort to detain him and rose to see him\n",
      "off. Aroma snatched up a handful of sweetmeats for Tealeaf. She also gave him a few\n",
      "coppers to buy fireworks with.\n",
      "‘Mind you don’t tell anyone about this visit!’ she said. ‘You’ll be in trouble yourself\n",
      "if they find out about it.\n",
      "She escorted Bao-yu to the gate and saw him into the cab, pulling the blind down on\n",
      "him as soon as he was inside. Tealeaf and her brother followed behind it with the\n",
      "horse. When they arrived outside the Ning-guo mansion, Tealeaf told the cabbie to\n",
      "stop.\n",
      "‘We’d better go in here for a bit before going home,’ he explained to Aroma’s\n",
      "brother. ‘Otherwise they might get suspicious.’\n",
      "Hua Zi-fang acknowledged the sense of this precaution, and lifting Bao-yu from the\n",
      "cab, helped him up on to his horse.\n",
      "‘Thank you for your trouble,’ said Bao-yu with a winning smile as he rode into the\n",
      "rear gate of the Ning-guo mansion.\n",
      "And there, for the time being, we shall leave him.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bao-yu left his room for the other mansion, his maids were free to do exactly\n",
      "as they liked and threw themselves into their amusements with great abandon. Some\n",
      "played at Racing Go, some at Dice and Dominoes. Everywhere a litter of the spat-out\n",
      "skins of melon-seeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence.\n",
      "It was unfortunate that Nannie Li should have chosen such a moment to come\n",
      "stomping in, stick in hand, to call on Bao-yu and to inquire how he was getting on.\n",
      "She could see that Bao-yu was out, and the uproar created in his absence by the\n",
      "maids was deeply offensive to her.\n",
      "‘Now that I’ve left service and don’t come in very often,’ she said with a sigh, ‘you\n",
      "girls have got worse than ever. The other nannies can do nothing with you. And as for\n",
      "Bao-yu: he’s like a six-foot lamp stand that lights up others but stays dark itself; for\n",
      "he’s always on about how dirty other people are, but look at the mess he allows you\n",
      "\f",
      "to make of his own room! It’s a disgrace!’\n",
      "Now the maids all knew that Bao-yu did not care about such matters. They also knew\n",
      "that Nannie Li was pensioned off now and had no more power over them. They\n",
      "therefore con?tinued with their fun and took no notice of her. But Nannie Li was not\n",
      "to be ignored. ‘How is Bao-yu eating nowadays?’ ‘what time does he go to bed?’ She\n",
      "plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all. One\n",
      "of them even said, quite audibly and in her hearing, ‘Old nuisance!’\n",
      "‘What’s in this covered bowl?’ Nannie Li went on. ‘It’s junket, isn’t it? Why don’t\n",
      "you offer it to me?’ She picked up the gift of koumiss and began to drink it.\n",
      "‘Don’t you touch that!’ said one of the maids. ‘He was keeping that for Aroma. He’ll\n",
      "be angry when he gets back and finds out about that. You’d better tell him yourself\n",
      "you took it. We don’t want you getting us into trouble!’\n",
      "Nannie Li was angry and embarrassed at one and the same time.\n",
      "‘I won’t believe it of him,’ she said. ‘I won’t believe he would be so wicked as to\n",
      "grudge his old Nannie a bowl of milk. Why, he owes it to me. And not only a bowl of\n",
      "milk, either. Much more precious things than that. Do you mean to tell me that\n",
      "Aroma counts for more with him than I do? He ought to stop and ask himself how he\n",
      "grew up to be the big boy he is today. It’s my milk he sucked, that came from my own\n",
      "heart’s blood: that’s what he grew up on. And you mean to tell me that now, if I drink\n",
      "one little bowlful of his milk—cow’s milk—he’s going to be angry with me? Well, I will\n",
      "drink it, so there! He can do what he likes about it. And as for that Aroma. I don’t\n",
      "know what sort of a wonderful creature you think she is -- a little bit of a girl I picked\n",
      "out myself and trained with my own hand!’\n",
      "Defiantly she applied the koumiss once more to her lip and downed it to the last\n",
      "gulp.\n",
      "One of the maids, politer than the rest, attempted to placate her:\n",
      "‘They shouldn’t talk to you like that, Nannie! I’m not surprised you are cross. Of\n",
      "course Bao-yu isn’t going to upset himself over a little thing like that. He’s much more\n",
      "likely to send something nice round to you when he hears that you’ve been to see\n",
      "him.’\n",
      "‘Don’t you try wheedling me with your airs and graces, young woman!’ said Nannie\n",
      "Li implacably. ‘You think I don’t know about Snowpink being dismissed that time over\n",
      "the tea? You needn’t worry. If he makes a fuss about it tomorrow, I shall take the\n",
      "blame.’\n",
      "She went off in dudgeon.\n",
      "Presently Bao-yu returned and sent someone off to fetch Aroma. He noticed\n",
      "Skybright lying motionless on the daybed.\n",
      "‘What’s the matter with her?’ he asked. ‘Is she ill? Or has she lost the game?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘She was winning,’ said Ripple. ‘Then Nannie Li came along and put her off her\n",
      "stroke and she started losing. She got so cross that she had to go and lie down.’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t all take the old girl so seriously,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just leave her to do as\n",
      "she likes and take no notice!’\n",
      "Just at that moment Aroma arrived and said ‘hullo’ to everyone. She asked Bao-yu\n",
      "where he had eaten and what time he had got back. She also gave her mother’s\n",
      "regards to the other maids. When she had finished changing out of her holiday attire\n",
      "and taken the ‘going-out’ ornaments from her hair, Bao-yu asked someone to fetch\n",
      "the koumiss. There was a chorus of replies from the maids:\n",
      "‘Nannie Li drank it!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was about to say something when Aroma cut in with a smile:\n",
      "‘So that’s what you were saving for me! It was a very kind thought; but last time I\n",
      "had some of that stuff I took too much, being so fond of it, and gave myself a terrible\n",
      "stomachache. It didn’t go away until I’d brought it all up again, and it’s put me off it\n",
      "ever since. It’s a good job really that she did drink it. It would only have got left\n",
      "around and gone bad. Now what I’d really fancy are some dried chestnuts, if you’d\n",
      "like to be peeling them for me while I make up your bed on the king.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was completely taken in by this little ruse, and forgetting all about the\n",
      "koumiss, went off for some chestnuts and sat down by the lamp to peel them. He\n",
      "and Aroma were flow alone in the room together. Glancing up with a smile from his\n",
      "peeling he said,\n",
      "‘What relation of yours was that girl in the red dress today?’\n",
      "‘That’s my mother’s sister’s child.’\n",
      "Bao-yu made appreciative noises.\n",
      "‘What are you “oo-ing” and “ah-ing” about?’ said Aroma. ‘No, don’t tell me! I know\n",
      "how your mind works. You think she’s not good enough to wear red.’\n",
      "‘No. On the contrary,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If she’s not good enough to wear red, I\n",
      "shouldn’t think anyone is. No, I was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and\n",
      "how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here.’\n",
      "‘Because I have the misfortune to be a slave,’ Aroma said bitterly, ‘does that mean\n",
      "that all my relations ought to be slaves too? I suppose you think every pretty girl you\n",
      "see is just waiting to be bought so that she can be a servant in your house?hold!’\n",
      "‘How touchy you are!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Having her to live with us doesn’t have to mean\n",
      "as a servant, does it? It could mean as a bride.’\n",
      "‘Thank you, I’m sure!’ said Aroma. ‘But my folk are not quite grand enough for\n",
      "that!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was unwilling to pursue a conversation that had become so unpleasant and\n",
      "went on peeling in silence.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Why don’t you say something?’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose I’ve upset you now. Well,\n",
      "never mind! Tomorrow you can go out and buy the lot of them, just to spite me!’\n",
      "‘I don’t see what answer I can give when you say things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I\n",
      "only said what a nice girl she was. I think she is exactly suited to live in a big, wealthy\n",
      "household like ours. Much more so than some of the lumbering idiots who do live\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "‘She may not have that much good fortune,’ said Aroma; ‘but for all that she has\n",
      "been very delicately brought up -- the apple of my aunt’s and uncle’s eye. She was\n",
      "seventeen this holidays, and her trousseau is all ready for her to be married next\n",
      "year.’\n",
      "‘Hai!’\n",
      "An involuntary expression of regret broke from him when he heard that the girl in red\n",
      "was to be married. Already Aroma’s words had made him uneasy; but worse was to\n",
      "follow.\n",
      "‘I haven’t been able to see much of my cousins during these last few years,’ she\n",
      "said with a sigh, ‘and now it looks as if they will all have left home when I do go back.’\n",
      "There was obviously a good deal more that lay behind this remark. Startled, he threw\n",
      "down the chestnut he was peeling and asked her:\n",
      "‘How do you mean, “when you do go back”?’\n",
      "‘Today I heard my mother discussing it with my elder brother. They want me to\n",
      "hold out this one year more, then next year they will see about buying me out of\n",
      "service.,\n",
      "Bao-yu was becoming more and more alarmed.\n",
      "‘Why should they want to buy you out of service?’\n",
      "‘Well upon my word, that’s a funny question to ask!’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not one of\n",
      "your house-born slaves, my family lives elsewhere. I’m the only member of my family\n",
      "away from home. There’s no future for me here. Naturally I want to rejoin them.’\n",
      "‘You can’t if I won’t let you,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘I never heard of such a thing!’ said Aroma:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Even in palace hall\n",

      "You can’t force them to stay in service for ever and ever -- especially a household like\n",
      "yours.’\n",
      "Bao-yu thought a bit. What she said seemed reasonable enough.\n",
      "‘But suppose Grandmother won’t let you?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Why shouldn’t she?’ said Aroma. ‘If I were a very excep?tional sort of person, it’s\n",
      "quite possible that she and Her Ladyship might feel upset at the idea of losing me\n",
      "and offer my family money to let me stay on. But as it is I’m only a very ordinary sort\n",
      "of maid. There are any number much better than me. I started off with Her Old\n",
      "Ladyship and served Miss Shi for a few years. Then I was transferred to you, and I’ve\n",
      "already been quite a few years with you. They would think it quite natural that my\n",
      "family should want to buy me out now. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if they let me\n",
      "go as a kindness without even asking for the money. If you think they wouldn’t let me\n",
      "go because I’ve served you so well, that’s just ridiculous. Serving you well is no more\n",
      "nor less than what I’m supposed to do. It’s my job. There’s nothing remarkable about\n",
      "that. There’ll be plenty of other good ones to take my place when I’m gone. I’m not\n",
      "irreplaceable.’\n",
      "Everything Aroma said pointed to the reasonableness of her going and the\n",
      "unreasonableness of her staying. A kind of desperateness began to seize him.\n",
      "‘That may be so,’ he said, ‘but if I’m absolutely determined to keep you, I’m sure\n",
      "Grandmother would speak to your mother about it. If Grandmother had a talk with\n",
      "your mother and offered her a really large sum of money, surely she wouldn’t\n",
      "refuse?’\n",
      "‘I’m sure my mother would never insist,’ said Aroma. ‘And I don’t only mean if you\n",
      "spoke to her and gave her a lot of money. Even if you didn’t speak to her about it and\n",
      "didn’t give her any money at all, but simply made up your mind to keep me here\n",
      "against my will and say nothing, I’m sure she wouldn’t dare object. But your family\n",
      "has never gone in for throwing its weight about like that in the past, and I don’t\n",
      "believe it is going to start doing so now. It would be different if I were just an object\n",
      "you’d taken a fancy to and they could get it for you without any danger of upsetting\n",
      "the owner by simply offering him ten times the price. But I’m not an object. If you\n",
      "were to keep me here without rhyme or reason against my will, you’d not only be\n",
      "doing yourselves no good, you’d be breaking up someone else’s family; and that’s\n",
      "something I’m quite sure Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship would never be willing\n",
      "to do.’\n",
      "For some time Bao-yu reflected in silence. At last he spoke:\n",
      "‘The long and short of all this is that you are definitely going, is that right?’\n",
      "‘Definitely.’\n",
      "‘Who would have believed that so sweet a person could be so faithless and\n",
      "unfeeling?’ he thought to himself. But all he said was:\n",
      "‘If I had known all along that in the end you would go away and leave me on my\n",
      "own, I should never have let you work for me in the first place.’\n",
      "And with those words he took himself off to bed in a thoroughly bad humour and\n",
      "\f",
      "composed himself for sleep.\n",
      "Now Aroma’s mother and elder brother had spoken earlier that day about their\n",
      "intention of buying her out of service, but Aroma had at once stated that she would\n",
      "never go back home as long as she lived.\n",
      "‘When you sold me in the first place,’ she said, ‘it was because you had nothing to\n",
      "eat and I was the only thing you had left in the house which was worth a bit of\n",
      "money. I couldn’t have refused to go and watched my own mother and father starve.\n",
      "But now, fortunately, I’ve got a good situation—one in which I’m not beaten and\n",
      "sworn at all day long and where I’m fed and clothed as well as the masters\n",
      "themselves—and the rest of you, inspire of losing Father, have managed to get in the\n",
      "clear again and are as well off now as you’ve ever been. If you were still hard up and\n",
      "wanted to buy me out so that you could raise a bit of money by reselling me, there\n",
      "would be some point in it. But you’re not. What do you want to buy me out for? Why\n",
      "don’t you just pretend that I’m dead, then you won’t need to think about buying me\n",
      "out any mote?’\n",
      "And after that she had had a little cry.\n",
      "Seeing her so adamant, her mother and brother had natur?ally resigned themselves\n",
      "to her continuing in service. They did so the more readily as Aroma’s contract was, in\n",
      "point of fact, for life. In seeking to redeem her they would have had to rely on the\n",
      "customary generosity of the Jia’s, who, as soon as they were approached on the\n",
      "subject, would in all probability restore not only the person of Aroma but also the\n",
      "body-price offered for her, but who were certainly not under any obliga?tion to do\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known\n",
      "fact— already mentioned by Aroma—that the Jia household did not ill-treat its\n",
      "servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them. Indeed,\n",
      "the ‘inside maids’—those who, like Aroma, were m personal attendance on members\n",
      "of the family (and this was true of all of them, no matter in whose apartment they\n",
      "were employed) were the crême de la crême of the household staff and were even\n",
      "regarded as a cut above the free daughters of poorer households outside.\n",
      "Later, when Bao-yu unexpectedly arrived on the scene and they saw how it was\n",
      "between him and Aroma, the reason for her reluctance to leave service at once\n",
      "became apparent. It was a factor they had not foreseen; but now they recognized it,\n",
      "it is a great weight off their minds, and it was not without feel?ings of relief that they\n",
      "abandoned all further thought of attempting to purchase her freedom.\n",
      "But to return to our story.\n",
      "Since early youth Aroma had always been aware that Bao-yu’s character was peculiar.\n",
      "His naughtiness and intract?ability exceeded those of normal boys, and in addition\n",
      "\f",
      "he had a number of extraordinary eccentricities of his own which she could scarcely\n",
      "even have put a name to. Recently he had taken advantage of the comparative\n",
      "immunity from parental control, afforded him by the all-encompassing protection of\n",
      "his doting grandmother, to become even more wild and self-indulgent and even\n",
      "more confirmed in his aversion to serious pursuits than in previous years, and all her\n",
      "attempts to remonstrate with him met with the same obstinate unwilling?ness to\n",
      "hear. Today’s talk about buying her out of service turned out to be providential. By\n",
      "employing only a minimum of deceit, she could use it as a means of ascertaining his\n",
      "real feelings towards her and of humbling his spirit a little, so that he might be in a\n",
      "suitably chastened frame of mind for the lecture with which she was preparing to\n",
      "admonish him. She judged from his going off silently to bed that he was shaken and a\n",
      "little unsure of himself. Evidently she had succeeded in the first part of her plan.\n",
      "Aroma had not really wanted the chestnuts. She had pre?tended to do so because\n",
      "she was afraid that the matter of the koumiss might blow up into an incident like the\n",
      "earlier one in?volving Snowpink and the tea. By pretending to want chest?nuts she\n",
      "had deflected him from pursuing it further. She now told the younger maids to take\n",
      "them away and eat them themselves, while she went over to rouse up Bao-yu. The\n",
      "face that he lifted from the pillow was wet with tears.\n",
      "‘Now what do you want to go upsetting yourself like that for?’ she said with a smile.\n",
      "‘If you really want me to stay, of course I won’t go.’\n",
      "Bao-yu at once brightened up.\n",
      "‘Tell me!’ he said. ‘Tell me what I must do to prove to you how much I want you to\n",
      "stay, since nothing I say myself seems any good!’\n",
      "‘I know we’re both fond of each other,’ said Aroma. ‘That doesn’t need any proving.\n",
      "But if you want to be sure of my staying here, it mustn’t only be because of that.\n",
      "There are three other things I want to talk to you about. If you will promise to obey\n",
      "me in all of them, I shall know that you really and truly want me to stay; then nothing\n",
      "- not even a knife at my throat - will ever make me leave you!’\n",
      "‘Tell me what they are!’ he said impetuously. ‘I promise to obey you. Dearest\n",
      "Aroma! Sweetest Aroma! Never mind two or three: I would promise if it were two or\n",
      "three hundred! All I ask is that you shouldn’t leave me. If the day ever comes when\n",
      "nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash - no, not ash. Ash has form and\n",
      "substance and perhaps consciousness too. Say smoke. A puff of thin smoke dissolved\n",
      "upon the wind. When that is all that remains of me, and you can no longer fuss over\n",
      "me because there is nothing left to fuss over, and I can no longer pay attention to you\n",
      "because there is nothing left to pay attention with - when that time comes, you may\n",
      "go or stay as you please!’\n",
      "‘My dear young gentleman,’ said Aroma exasperatedly, dapping her hand over his\n",
      "\f",
      "mouth to prevent him saying any more, ‘it’s precisely this way of carrying on that I\n",
      "was going to talk to you about, and here you go, ranting away worse than ever!’\n",
      "‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Right. I promise never to talk that way again.’\n",
      "‘That was the first thing I wanted you to reform.’\n",
      "‘I’ve reformed already,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I ever talk that way again, you can pinch my\n",
      "lips! Then what?’\n",
      "‘The second thing is this,’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t care whether you really like studying\n",
      "or not, but even if you don’t, I’d like you at least to pretend that you do when you’re\n",
      "with the Master or any other gentlemen, and not always be making sarcastic remarks\n",
      "about it. If you could only put on an appear?ance of liking it, he would have less\n",
      "cause to be angry with you, and could even take a bit of pride in you when he was\n",
      "talk?ing to his friends. Look at it from his point of view. Every generation of your\n",
      "family up to now have been scholars. Then suddenly you come along. Not only do\n",
      "you hate studying --that’s already enough to make him feel angry and upset -- but on\n",
      "top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it -- and not only\n",
      "behind his back but even when he’s there. According to you anyone who studies and\n",
      "tries to im?prove himself is a “career worm”. According to you the Illumi?nation of\n",
      "Clear Virtue or whatever it’s called is the only genuine book ever written and all the\n",
      "rest are forgeries. No wonder the Master gets so angry with you. No wonder he’s\n",
      "every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a\n",
      "thrashing.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘All right. I won’t say such things any more. In any case, these are all things I used to\n",
      "say when I was younger and didn’t know any better. I don’t say things like that\n",
      "nowadays. What else?’\n",
      "‘You must leave off forever going on about people’s appearance and interfering\n",
      "with their make-up—and you must give up that filthy habit of stealing people’s\n",
      "lipstick and eating it on the sly. That’s most important!’\n",
      "‘I’ll reform! I’ll reform! Is there anything else, now?’\n",
      "‘Nothing else, really. Just to be a bit more careful about things in general and not\n",
      "always letting yourself get carried away by your whims and fancies. But if you will\n",
      "really keep your promise about these three things I’ve mentioned, I will promise\n",
      "never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry\n",
      "me away!’\n",
      "‘Oh, come now! Isn’t that stretching it a bit?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘For eight\n",
      "bearers and a handsome husband I bet you’d go!’\n",
      "‘It wouldn’t interest me in the least,’ said Aroma haughtily. ‘“Kind sir, for such\n",
      "blessing I am not willing.” Even if I did go, I should take no pleasure in it.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Their dialogue was interrupted by Ripple, who just at that moment entered the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "‘It’s nearly midnight, you two. You ought to be in bed. Her Old Ladyship just now\n",
      "sent one of the nannies round to ask about you and I told her you were asleep.’\n",
      "Bao-yu asked for his watch and looked. The hand was pointing to half past eleven. He\n",
      "washed and cleaned his teeth all over again, and taking off his outer clothes, settled\n",
      "down once more to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "When Aroma got up first thing next morning she felt heavy and unwell. Her head\n",
      "ached, her eyelids were puffy and her whole body was afire. At first she dragged\n",
      "herself round per?forming her usual tasks, but eventually she could hold out no\n",
      "longer and had to lie down fully clothed on the kang. Bao-yu at once informed\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, who called in a doctor. Having taken Aroma’s pulses, the doctor\n",
      "informed them that she had ‘merely contracted a severe chill and would be all right\n",
      "after taking a few doses of medicine to relieve the congestion,’ and left after writing a\n",
      "prescription. Bao-yu sent out for the materials prescribed, and when they had been\n",
      "duly boiled up and the first draught taken, made her cover herself with a quilt to\n",
      "bring on a perspiration. Then he went off to see Dai-yu.\n",
      "Dai-yu was at that moment taking a midday nap. Her maids had all gone off about\n",
      "their own affairs. Not a sound could be heard from the inside room As Bao-yu lifted\n",
      "the embroidered door-curtain and entered, he could see her lying asleep inside and\n",
      "hurried over to rouse her:\n",
      "‘Sleeping after you’ve just eaten, coz? That’s bad! Wake up!’\n",
      "His voice woke her. She opened her eyes and saw that it was Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Do go away and play for a bit! I’m so dreadfully tired. I didn’t get any sleep last\n",
      "night and I haven’t been able to rest until now.’\n",
      "‘Never mind how tired you are,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You’ll do yourself much more harm by\n",
      "sleeping after a meal. I’ll’ stay and amuse you to keep you awake if you feel sleepy.’\n",
      "‘I’m not sleepy, I’m tired. I want to rest for a bit. Can’t you go and amuse yourself\n",
      "somewhere else for a few minutes and come back later?’\n",
      "Bao-yu gave her another shake.\n",
      "‘Where else can I go?’ he said. ‘I’m so bored with everyone else.’\n",
      "‘Chee-ee-ee!’ Dai-yu exploded in a little laugh. ‘All right. I suppose now you are\n",
      "here you may as well stay. You can sit very, very quietly over there and we will talk.’\n",
      "‘I should prefer to lie down,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘All right, lie down then!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There isn’t a pillow. We shall have to share yours.’\n",
      "‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Look at all those pillows in the next room. Why\n",
      "don’t you get yourself one of them?’\n",
      "Bao-yu went into the outer room for a look but came back empty-handed.\n",
      "‘I don’t want any of them,’ he said genially. ‘How do I know some dirty old woman\n",
      "hasn’t been sleeping on them?’\n",
      "Dai-yu opened her eyes very wide.\n",
      "‘You really are the bane of my life!’ she said. ‘Here, take this!’ She pushed the\n",
      "pillow she had been lying on towards him and got up to fetch another one of her\n",
      "own to replace it with. The two of them then reclined, facing each other, at opposite\n",
      "ends of the bed.\n",
      "Glancing up from her recumbent position, Dai-yu noticed that there was a blood-spot\n",
      "about the size of a small button on Bao-yu’s left cheek. She bent over him to examine\n",
      "it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger.\n",
      "‘Whose nails was it this time?’\n",
      "Bao-yu lay back to avoid her scrutiny and laughed.\n",
      "‘It isn’t a scratch. I’ve just been helping them make rouge. A little of it must have\n",
      "splashed on to my face.’ He rum?maged for a handkerchief to wipe it off with.\n",
      "Dai-yu wiped it off with her own, clicking her tongue censoriously as she did so.\n",
      "‘So you’re up to those tricks again? You might at least refrain from advertising the\n",
      "fact! Even if Uncle doesn’t see you himself, someone else might who thought it an\n",
      "amusing story to go around gossiping about. He could easily get to hear about it in\n",
      "that way, and that would make it unpleasant for all of us.’\n",
      "But her words were lost on Bao-yu. He was preoccupied with a subtle fragrance\n",
      "which seemed to emanate from Dai-?yu’s sleeve - a fragrance that intoxicated the\n",
      "senses and caused one to feel rather limp. He seized hold of the sleeve and\n",
      "demanded to know what perfume she was wearing.\n",
      "‘Perfume? At this season?’ said Dai-yu with a laugh. ‘I’m not wearing any. “In the\n",
      "cold winter none smells sweet”!’\n",
      "‘Well, where does it come from, then?’\n",
      "‘I don’t know myself where it comes from,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I suppose it might have\n",
      "come from the wardrobe.’\n",
      "Bao-yu shook his head.\n",
      "‘I doubt it. It’s a very unusual scent. Not the kind you would get from a scent-cake\n",
      "or a perfume-ball or sachet.’\n",
      "‘I hope you don’t imagine it’s some exotic perfume given me by the Immortals of\n",
      "the Isles. Even if I had the recipe, I have no kind elder brother to get together all\n",
      "those flowers and stamens and things and make it up for me. I have got only the\n",
      "\f",
      "ordinary, vulgar sorts of perfume!’\n",
      "‘Whatever I say, you are always dragging in things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Very well,\n",
      "You will have to be taught a lesson. From now on, no mercy!’\n",
      "Half rising, he pretended to spit on his hands, then stretch?ing them out before him,\n",
      "began to waggle his fingers up and down in the region of her ribs and armpits. Dai-yu\n",
      "had always been the most ticklish of mortals, and the mere sight of his waggling\n",
      "fingers sent her off into shrieks of laughter which soon ended in breathlessness:\n",
      "‘Oh! Oh! Bao-yu! No! Stop! I’ll be angry!’\n",
      "‘Will you say things like that any more?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Dai-yu, laughing weakly, ‘I promise.’\n",
      "She proceeded to pat her hair into place, smilingly com?placently:\n",
      "‘So I’ve got an unusual fragrance, have I? Have you got a warm fragrance?’\n",
      "For the moment Bao-yu was puzzled:\n",
      "‘Warm fragrance?’\n",
      "Dai-yu shook her head pityingly.\n",
      "‘Don’t be so dense! You have your jade. Somebody has a gold thing to match.\n",
      "Somebody has Cold Fragrance, ergo you must have Warm Fragrance to go with it!’\n",
      "‘I’ve only just let you off,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and here you go again, worse than ever!’\n",
      "Once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and Dai-yu again began to shriek.\n",
      "‘No! Bao-yu! Please! I promise!’\n",
      "‘All right, I forgive you. But you must let me smell your sleeve.’\n",
      "He wrapped the free end of that garment over his face and abandoned himself to\n",
      "long and prodigious sniffs.\n",
      "Dai-yu jerked away her arm.\n",
      "‘I really think you ought to go.’\n",
      "‘Couldn’t go if I wanted to. Let’s lie down very quietly and genteelly and have a\n",
      "conversation.’ And he stretched himself out again.\n",
      "Dai-yu lay down too, and covered her face with a handker?chief.\n",
      "He tried to arouse her interest with desultory chat—talking for the sake of talking.\n",
      "Dai-yu took no notice. He tried asking questions. How old was she when she first\n",
      "came to the Capital? What had the scenery been like on the journey? What places of\n",
      "historical interest were there in Yangchow? What were its inhabitants like? What\n",
      "were its local customs? Dai-yu made no reply. Still concerned that she might fail\n",
      "asleep and injure her health, he tried a ruse.\n",
      "‘Why, yes!’ he said, as if suddenly remembering something. ‘There’s a famous story\n",
      "that took place near Yangchow. I wonder if you know about it.’\n",
      "This was delivered with so straight a face and in so serious a tone of voice that Dai-yu\n",
      "was quite taken in.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Oh? What?’\n",
      "Mastering a strong inclination to laugh, he began to extemporize with whatever\n",
      "came into his head.\n",
      "‘Near the city of Yangchow there is a mountain called Mt Yu-dai, in the side of\n",
      "which is a cavern called the Cave of Lin.’\n",
      "‘That’s false, for a start,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ve never heard of a mountain of that name.’\n",
      "‘There are a great many mountains in this world,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You could hardly be\n",
      "expected to know all of them. Leave your criticisms until I have finished my story.’\n",
      "‘Carry on,’ said Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Now in the Cave of Lin there lived a tribe of magic mice, and one year, on the\n",
      "seventh day of the last month, the Oldest Mouse climbed up on to his throne and sat\n",
      "in council with the rest of the tribe.\n",
      "‘“Tomorrow is Nibbansday,” he said, “and everywhere in the world of men they will\n",
      "be cooking frumenty. Since our cave is at present short of dry provender, we should\n",
      "take this opportunity of replenishing our stores by raiding theirs.” He took a\n",
      "ceremonial arrow from the receptacle in front of him and handing it to an able\n",
      "younger mouse, instructed him to carry out a reconnaissance. In due course the Able\n",
      "Younger Mouse came back and reported that, though he had looked positively\n",
      "everywhere, there were nowhere more plentiful stores to be found than in the\n",
      "temple at the foot of the mountain.\n",
      "“‘How many kinds of grain have they got there, and how many sorts of dried\n",
      "fruits?” the Oldest Mouse asked him.\n",
      "‘“There is a whole granary full of rice and beans,” replied the Able Younger Mouse,\n",
      "“but only five kinds of dried fruits:\n",
      "the first,       red dates\n",

      "grace to look up and take notice of me! You and your airs and graces! All you ever\n",
      "think about is how to win Bao-yu over to you. Thanks to you he won’t listen to me\n",
      "any more. He only does what you say. To think that a cheap bit of goods like you that\n",
      "they only paid a few taels of silver for should come along here and turn the whole\n",

      "to one of the boys and send you packing. Then we’d see how you managed to play\n",
      "the siren and lead young gentlemen astray!’\n",
      "Aroma at first thought that Nannie Li’s anger arose solely on account of her failure to\n",
      "get up and welcome her, and had started to excuse herself on that supposition:\n",
      "‘I’m ill, Mrs Li. I’ve just been sweating. I didn’t see you because I had my head\n",

      "quarrelling yourself. Surely you know better than that? If anyone has been\n",
      "misbehaving, you have only to tell me and I’ll have them beaten for you. Now I’ve got\n",
      "a nice hot pheasant stew in my room. You just come along with me and you shall\n",
      "have some of that and a drink to go with it!’\n",

      "Unable to hold her ground, the old Nannie was borne off in Xi-feng’s wake, muttering\n",

      "‘I wish I was dead, I really do! But I’d sooner forget myself and make a scene like I\n",

      "shameless little baggages!’\n",
      "Watching this sudden exit, Bao-chai and Dai-yu laughed and clapped their hands:\n",
      "‘How splendid! Just the sort of wind we needed to blow the old woman away!’\n",
      "But Bao-yu shook his head and sighed:\n",
      "‘I wonder what had really upset her. Obviously she only picked on Aroma because\n",
      "she is weak and can’t defend herself. I wonder which of the girls had offended her to\n",
      "make her so .\n",
      "He was interrupted by Skybright:\n",
      "‘Why should any of us want to upset her? Do you think we’re mad? And even if we\n",
      "had offended her, we should be perfectly capable of owning up to it and not letting\n",
      "someone else take the blame!’\n",
      "Aroma grasped Bao-yu’s hand and wept:\n",
      "‘Because I offended one old nurse, you have to go offending a whole roomful of\n",
      "\f",
      "people. Don’t you think there’s been enough trouble already without dragging other\n",
      "people into it?’\n",
      "Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her\n",
      "condition, Bao-yu stifled his indig?nation and did his best to comfort her so that she\n",
      "might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever. Her\n",
      "skin was burning to the touch. He decided to stay with her for a while, and lying\n",
      "down beside her, spoke to her soothingly:\n",
      "‘Just try to get better, now! Never mind all that other nonsense! It’s of no\n",
      "importance.’\n",
      "Aroma smiled bitterly.\n",
      "‘If I had allowed myself to get upset about things like that, I shouldn’t have lasted in\n",
      "this room for five minutes! Still, if we’re always going to have this sort of trouble, I\n",
      "think in the long run I just shan’t be able to stand any more. You don’t seem to\n",
      "realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you’ve forgotten all\n",
      "about it. But they haven’t. It’s all scored up against me; and as soon as something\n",
      "goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it\n",
      "so unpleasant for all of us.’\n",
      "She cried weakly as she said this, but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting\n",
      "Bao-yu.\n",
      "Soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of Aroma’s medicine.\n",
      "Bao-yu could see that she had started sweating again and told her not to get up,\n",
      "holding the medicine for her himself and supporting her while she drank it. Then he\n",
      "told one of the junior maids to make up a bed for her on the kang.\n",
      "‘Whether you’re going to eat there or not,’ Aroma said to him, ‘you’d better go and\n",
      "sit with Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship for a bit and play a while with the young\n",
      "ladies before you come back here again. I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my\n",
      "own.’\n",
      "Bao-yu thought he had better do as she said, and after wait?ing until she had taken\n",
      "off her ornaments and was lying tucked up in bed, he went to the front apartment\n",
      "and took his dinner with Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "After dinner Grandmother Jia wanted to go on playing cards with some of the old\n",
      "stewardesses. Bao-yu, still worrying about Aroma, returned to his own room, where\n",
      "he found her sleeping fitfully. He thought of going to bed himself, but it was still too\n",
      "early. Skybright, Mackerel, Ripple and Emerald had gone off in quest of livelier\n",
      "entertainment, hoping to persuade Grandmother Jia’s maids, Faithful and Amber, to\n",
      "loin them in a game. Only Musk was left in the outer room, playing Patience under\n",
      "the lamp with a set of dominoes. Bao-yu smiled at her.\n",
      "‘Why don’t you go off to loin the others?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I haven’t got any money.’\n",
      "‘There’s a great pile of money under the bed. Isn’t that enough for you to lose?’\n",
      "‘If we all went off to play,’ said Musk, ‘who would look after this room? There’s her\n",
      "sick inside. And lamps and stoves burning everywhere. The old women were\n",
      "practically dead on their feet after waiting on you all day; I had to let them go and\n",
      "rest. And the girls have been on duty all day, too. You could scarcely grudge them\n",
      "some time off now for amusement.—Which leaves only me to look after the place.’\n",
      "‘Another Aroma,’ thought Bao-yu to himself and gave her another smile.\n",
      "‘I’ll sit here while you’re away. There’s nothing to worry about here if you’d like to\n",
      "go.’\n",
      "‘There’s even less excuse for going if you are here,’ said Musk. ‘Why can’t we both\n",
      "sit here and talk?’\n",
      "‘What can we do?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just sitting here talking is going to be rather dull. I\n",
      "know! You were saying this morning that your head was itchy. As you haven’t got\n",
      "anything else to do now, I’ll comb it for you.’\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Musk, and fetching her toilet-box with the mirror on top she\n",
      "proceeded to take off her ornaments and shake her hair out. Bao-yu took a comb and\n",
      "began to comb it for her. But he had not drawn it more than four or five times\n",
      "through her hair, when Skybright came bursting in to get some more money. Seeing\n",
      "the two of them together, she smiled sarcastically:\n",
      "‘Fancy! Doing her hair already-- before you’ve even drunk the marriage-cup!’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘Come here! I’ll do yours for you too, if you like!’\n",
      "‘I wouldn’t presume, thanks all the same!’\n",
      "She took the money, and with a swish of the door-blind was gone.\n",
      "Bao-yu was standing behind Musk as she sat looking at her?self in the mirror. Their\n",
      "eyes met in the glass and they both laughed.\n",
      "‘Of all the girls in this room she has the sharpest tongue,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Musk signalled to him agitatedly in the glass with her hand. Bao-yu took her meaning;\n",
      "but it was too late. With another swish of the door-blind, Skybright had already\n",
      "darted in again.\n",
      "‘Oh! Sharp-tongued, am I? Perhaps you’d like to say a bit more on that subject?’\n",
      "‘Get along with you!’ laughed Musk. ‘Don’t go starting any more arguments!’\n",
      "‘And don’t you go sticking up for him!’ said Skybright gaily. ‘I know what you’re up\n",
      "to, you two. You don’t deceive me with your goings-on. I’ll have something to say to\n",
      "you about this when I get back later. Just wait until I’ve won some of my money\n",
      "back!’\n",
      "With that she darted off once more.\n",
      "\f",
      "When Bao-yu had finished combing her hair, he asked Musk to help him get to\n",
      "bed—very quietly, so as not to disturb Aroma.\n",
      "And that ends our account of that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing next morning Aroma awoke to find that she had sweated heavily during\n",
      "the night and that her body felt very much lighter; but she would take only a little\n",
      "congee for breakfast in order not to tax her system too soon. Bao-yu saw that there\n",
      "was no further cause for concern, and after his meal drifted off to Aunt Xue’s\n",
      "apartment in search of amusement.\n",
      "Now this was the prime of the year, when the schoolroom is closed for the New Year\n",
      "holiday and the use of the needle is forbidden to maidenly fingers throughout the\n",
      "whole of the Lucky Month, so that boys and girls alike are all agreeably un?employed,\n",
      "and Bao-yu’s half-brother Jia Huan, on holiday like all the rest, had also drifted over\n",
      "to Aunt Xue’s place in search of amusement. He found Bao-chai, Caltrop and Oriole\n",
      "there playing a game of Racing Go, and after watching them for a bit, wanted to play\n",
      "too.\n",
      "Bao-chai had always behaved towards Jia Huan in exactly the same way as she did\n",
      "towards Bao-yu and made no distinc?tions between them. Consequently, when he\n",
      "asked to play, she at once made a place for him and invited him to join them on the\n",
      "kang. They played for stakes of ten cash each a game. Jia Huan won the first game\n",
      "and felt very pleased. But then, as luck would have it, he lost several times in a row\n",
      "and began to get somewhat rattled.\n",
      "It was now his turn to throw the dice. He needed seven to win, and if he threw\n",
      "anything less than seven, the dice would go next to Oriole, who needed only three.\n",
      "He hurled them from the pot with all his might. One of them rested at two. The other\n",
      "continued rather erratically to roll about. ‘Ace! Ace! Ace!’ cried Oriole, clapping her\n",
      "hands. ‘Six! Seven! Eight!’ shouted Jia Huan glaring at Oriole and commanding the\n",
      "die to perform the impossible. But the perverse wanderer finally came to rest with\n",
      "the ace uppermost, making a grand total of three. With the speed of desperation Jia\n",
      "Huan reached out and snatched it up, claiming, as he did so, that it was a six.\n",
      "‘It was an ace,’ said Oriole, ‘as plain as anything!’\n",
      "Bao-chai could see that Jia Huan was rattled, and darting a sharp look at Oriole,\n",
      "commanded her to yield.\n",
      "‘You grow more unmannerly every day,’ she told her. ‘Surely you don’t think one of\n",
      "the masters would cheat you? Come on! Put your money down!’\n",
      "Oriole smarted with the injustice of this, but her mistress had ordered it, so she had\n",
      "\f",
      "to pay up without arguing. She could not, however, forbear a few rebellious\n",
      "mutterings:\n",
      "‘Huh! One of the masters! Cheating a maid out of a few coppers! Even I should be\n",
      "ashamed! Look how much money Bao-yu lost when he was playing with us the other\n",
      "day, yet he didn’t mind. Even when some of the maids took all he had left, he only\n",
      "laughed...’\n",
      "She would have gone on, but Bao-chai checked her angrily. ‘How can I hope to\n",
      "compete with Bao-yu?’ said Jia Huan, beginning to blubber. ‘You’re all afraid of him.\n",
      "You all take his part against me because I’m only a concubine’s son.’\n",
      "Bao-chai was shocked:\n",
      "‘Please don’t say things like that, Cousin! You’ll make your?self ridiculous.’\n",
      "Once more she rebuked Oriole.\n",
      "Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in, and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in,\n",
      "asked him what was the matter. But Jia Huan dared not say anything.\n",
      "Bao-chai, familiar with the state of affairs, normal in other families, which places the\n",
      "younger brother in fearful subjec?tion to the elder, assumed that Jia Huan was afraid\n",
      "of Bao-yu. She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of\n",
      "him. ‘We are both equally subject to our parents’ control,’ he would say of himself\n",
      "and Jia Huan. ‘Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control\n",
      "him myself - especially when I am the wife’s son and he is the concubine’s? People\n",
      "already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if\n",
      "I were to start bossing him about.’\n",
      "But’ there was another, zanier, notion which contributed to this attitude. Let us try to\n",
      "explain it. Bao-yu had from early youth grown up among girls. There were his sisters\n",
      "Yuan?-chun and Tan-chun, his cousins of the same surname Ying?-chun and Xi-chun,\n",
      "and his distaff-cousins Shi Xiang-yun, Lin Dai-yu and Xue Bao-chai. As a result of this\n",
      "upbringing, he had come to the conclusion that the pure essence of human?ity was\n",

      "quite capable of looking after him themselves. There’s no cause for you to go biting\n",

      "‘What have you come for this time? Why can’t you just leave me here to die in\n",

      "‘And it’s the way I feel,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that makes me the way I am! Do you mean to\n",
      "tell me that you know your own feelings about me but still don’t know what my\n",
      "feelings are about you?’\n",

      "perfect yourthelf, I don’t thee why you have to go making fun of everyone elthe. But I\n",
      "can show you thomeone you won’t dare to find fault with. I shall certainly think you a\n",
      "wonder if you do.’\n",
      "‘Who’s that?’ said Dai-yu\n",
      "‘If you can find any shortcomings in Cousin Bao-chai’, said Xiang-yun, ‘you must be\n",
      "very good indeed.’\n",
      "‘Oh her,’ said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I wondered whom you could mean. I should never dare\n",
      "to find fault with her.’\n",
      "But before she could say any more, Bao-yu cut in and hurriedly changed the subject.\n",
      "‘I shall never be a match for you as long as I live,’ Xiang?-yun said to Dai-yu with a\n",
      "disarming smile. ‘All I can thay ith that I hope you marry a lithping huthband, tho that\n",
      "you have “ithee-withee” “ithee-withee” in your earth every minute of the day. Ah,\n",
      "Holy Name! I think I can thee that blethed day already before my eyeth!’\n",
      "Bao-yu could not help laughing; but Xiang-yun had already turned and fled.\n",

      "now!’\n",
      "And when Dai-yu reached the doorway where he was standing, he spread his arms\n",
      "across it to stop her getting by and laughingly begged an amnesty for Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Never!’ said Dai-yu, endeavouring to tug one of his hands away from the\n",
      "door-jamb. ‘I’ll get that Yun if it’s the last thing I do!’\n",
      "With Bao-yu blocking the doorway and Dai-yu evidently unable to get past him,\n",
      "Xiang-yun deemed it safe to stop running, and turned to plead with her pursuer:\n",

      "‘Oh, really!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who would ever have the nerve to make fun of you? Yun\n",
      "only said what she said because you mimicked her in the first place. She’d never have\n",
      "dared to otherwise.’\n",
      "It is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse\n",
      "had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in\n",
      "Grandmother Jia’s room. It was already lighting-up time and Lady Wang, Li Wan,\n",
      "Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had also forgathered for the meal. When\n",
      "dinner was over, the company conversed for a while and then retired to their various\n",
      "rooms for the night—Xiang-yun to sleep with Dai-yu in what had once, in the days\n",
      "when she lived with Grandmother Jia, been her own bedroom. Bao-yu saw the two\n",
      "of them back to their room and stayed there talking until well after ten, in spite of\n",
      "frequent summonses by Aroma.\n",
      "As soon as it was light next morning, Bao-yu was off again to the girls’ room, shuffling\n",
      "along in his slippers and with a gown thrown loosely round his shoulders. The maids\n",
      "Night?ingale and Kingfisher were not yet about, and their two young mistresses still\n",
      "lay fast asleep under the covers. Dai-yu was tightly cocooned in a quilt of\n",
      "apricot-coloured damask, the picture of tranquil repose Xiang-yun, by contrast, lay\n",
      "with her hank of jet-black hair tumbled untidily beside the pillow, a white arm with\n",
      "its two gold bracelets thrown carelessly out?side the bedding and two white\n",
      "\f",
      "shoulders exposed above the peach-pink coverlet, which barely reached her armpits.\n",
      "‘A tomboy, even in her sleep!’ Bao-yu muttered ruefully as he gently drew the\n",
      "bedding up to cover her. ‘She’ll get a draught on those shoulders, and next thing\n",
      "she’ll be complain?ing of a stiff neck!’\n",
      "Dai-yu had by now awakened. She sensed that there was someone else in the room,\n",
      "and guessing that it must be Bao-yu, lifted her head up to look. Sure enough, it was\n",
      "he.\n",
      "‘What are you doing here at this early hour?’\n",
      "‘Early? Get up and have a look and then tell me if you think it’s early!’\n",
      "‘You’d better go outside a minute if you want us to get up,’ said Dai-yu.\n",
      "Bao-yu went into the outer room. Dai-yu got up as soon as he had gone out and\n",
      "roused Xiang-yun. When the two girls had slipped into some clothes, Bao-yu came\n",
      "inside again and sat himself down beside the dressing-table. Presently Night?ingale\n",
      "and Kingfisher came in to help the girls with their toilet. Xiang-yun finished washing\n",
      "first. Kingfisher was on her way out to empty the basin, when Bao-yu called her back:\n",
      "‘Just a moment! While you are about it I may as well wash too and save myself the\n",
      "trouble of going back to my own room.’\n",
      "He came over to where she stood, and bending his head down over the basin,\n",
      "scooped up two handfuls of water and began washing his face. Nightingale handed\n",
      "him some scented soap.\n",
      "‘It’s all right,’ he said, ‘there’s lots in here already.’\n",
      "Then he asked for a towel.\n",
      "Kingfisher pursed her lips up derisively:\n",
      "‘You haven’t changed much, have you?’\n",
      "Ignoring the sarcasm, he demanded crude salt to clean his teeth with, and after\n",
      "rubbing it all round them vigorously with a finger, he rinsed his mouth out with water.\n",
      "That part of his toilet completed, he observed that Xiang-yun had just finished doing\n",
      "her hair and wandered over to where she was sitting.\n",
      "‘Coz dear, do my hair for me, will you?’\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "Bao-yu smiled coaxingly:\n",
      "‘Go on, be a dear! You used to do it for me once.’\n",
      "‘Well, I can’t any longer,’ said Xiang-yun. I’ve forgotten how to.’\n",
      "‘It doesn’t need very much doing to it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m not going out anywhere\n",
      "today. Just a few plaits.’\n",
      "He continued to coax and wheedle until at last she gave in, and taking his head in her\n",
      "hands, sat him down in her place at the dressing-table and proceeded to comb and\n",
      "dress his hair.\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu never wore any head-covering when he was at home. Instead he had his\n",
      "side-hair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears\n",
      "and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the\n",
      "back. It was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular\n",
      "intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head. As Xiang-yun plaited, she\n",
      "noticed that a pearl appeared to be missing.\n",
      "‘What’s happened to this clip?’ she said. ‘I’m sure it used to be the same as the\n",
      "other three. Where has its pearl gone?’\n",
      "‘I lost it,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘I expect it fell off somewhere outside and somebody picked it up,’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Lucky old somebody!’\n",
      "‘Who knows whether or not he really lost it?’ said Dai-yu scoffingly. ‘For all we\n",
      "know he may have given it to someone to have remounted as a keepsake!’\n",
      "Bao-yu made no comment, but sat fiddling with the toilet articles that crowded the\n",
      "dressing-table on either side of the mirror. He picked up a pot of rouge, almost\n",
      "without realizing what he was doing, and sat with it poised in his hand, wanting to\n",
      "put it to his lips for a little taste, but afraid Xiang-yun would rebuke him. While he\n",
      "hesitated, Xiang-yun leaned forward from where she was sitting and administered a\n",
      "sharp slap to his hand, causing the rouge-pot to fall from it on to the dressing-table.\n",
      "‘Nathty habit!’ she said. ‘It’s time you gave it up!’\n",
      "The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Aroma entered. She concluded from\n",
      "the scene that met her eyes that Bao-yu had already completed his toilet, and went\n",
      "back again to attend to her own. Soon after this Bao-chai dropped in.\n",
      "‘Where’s Cousin Bao?’ she asked.\n",
      "‘ “Cousin Bao” has no time to spend in here nowadays,’ said Aroma bitterly.\n",
      "Bao-chai immediately understood.\n",
      "Aroma sighed.\n",
      "‘I say nothing against being friendly,’ she said. ‘But this hanging around there\n",
      "morning, noon and night is another matter. However, nothing I say makes any\n",
      "difference. It’s just a waste of breath.’\n",
      "Bao-chai was impressed.\n",
      "‘One mustn’t underestimate this maid,’ she thought to her?self. ‘She is obviously a\n",
      "girl of some intelligence.’\n",
      "And she sat down on the kang with her for a chat. In the course of conversation she\n",
      "inquired casually about her age, family, and various other personal matters, paying\n",
      "careful attention to her answers and gaining from them and from the tone in which\n",
      "they were uttered an increasing respect for this uneducated maid.\n",
      "Presently Bao-yu came in, whereupon Bao-chai got up and left. Bao-yu commented\n",
      "\f",
      "on her departure:\n",
      "‘Cousin Bao-chai seemed to be very thick with you just now. Why should she\n",
      "suddenly rush off when I come into the room?’\n",
      "There was no reply, so he repeated his question.\n",
      "‘Are you asking me?’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t know what reasons you all have for your\n",
      "comings and goings.’\n",
      "The expression on her face as she uttered these words was angrier than he had ever\n",
      "seen her look before.\n",
      "He laughed.\n",
      "‘Oh dear! Are you in a rage again?’\n",
      "Aroma laughed mirthlessly.\n",
      "‘It’s not for the likes of me to get into rages. But I wish that from now on you would\n",
      "stop coming into this room. After all, you have got people to wait on you elsewhere.\n",
      "You don’t really need my services. I shall go back to serving Her Old Ladyship, like I\n",
      "used to before.’\n",
      "With that she closed her eyes and lay back upon the kang.\n",
      "Bao-yu was alarmed to see her in such a state and impulsively rushed over to the\n",
      "kang to soothe her. But Aroma kept her eyes tightly shut and would take no notice.\n",
      "Bao-yu did not know what to do. Just then Musk chanced to enter and he turned to\n",
      "her for help:\n",
      "‘What’s up with Aroma?’\n",
      "‘How should I know?’ said Musk. ‘You’d do better to ask yourself that question.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was so taken aback that for a while he said nothing. Then, finding their\n",
      "combined hostility too much for him, he got up with a sigh from his suppliant\n",
      "position on the kang.\n",
      "‘All right, ignore me then! I’m going off to sleep, too.’\n",
      "And he slid from the kang and went off to his own bed to lie down.\n",
      "For a long time there was no sound from him except for a gentle snoring. Judging\n",
      "that he must be really asleep, Aroma rose from the kang and took a large\n",
      "travelling-cloak to cover him with. A moment later she heard a gentle thud. He had\n",
      "whipped it from him and thrown it to the floor as soon as her back was turned. But\n",
      "when she looked, his eyes were closed as before and he was still pretending to be\n",
      "asleep. The significance of the gesture did not escape her. She nodded slowly and\n",
      "regarded the feigned sleeper sarcastically:\n",
      "‘All right, then! There’s no need for you to get angry. From now on I’ll just pretend\n",
      "I’m dumb. I won’t say another word of criticism. Will that satisfy you?’\n",
      "This was too much for Bao-yu. He sat bolt upright on his bed.\n",
      "‘What am I supposed to have done this time? And what’s all this “criticism” you’re\n",
      "\f",
      "talking about? If you had been criticizing me it wouldn’t be so bad; but when I came\n",
      "in just now, you didn’t say anything: you simply ignored me. You went and lay down\n",
      "in a huff without my having the faintest idea what it was all about, and now you\n",
      "accuse me of behaving unreasonably! I haven’t heard a single peep out of you yet to\n",
      "explain what it is that you are angry about I’\n",
      "‘Your own conscience ought to tell you that,’ said Aroma. ‘You don’t need me to tell\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "They were still arguing when Grandmother Jia sent a ser?vant round to summon him\n",
      "to lunch. He went off to the front apartment, but returned almost immediately after\n",
      "bolting a single bowlful of rice. He found Aroma asleep on the kang and Musk sitting\n",
      "beside her playing Patience with some dominoes. He had long known that Musk was\n",
      "a close ally of Aroma’s, so ignoring them both, he marched past them into the inner\n",
      "room, raising the door-curtain for himself as he passed through. Musk followed him\n",
      "automatically, but he pushed her out:\n",
      "‘No, no, I wouldn’t presume to trouble you!’\n",
      "She laughed and went back to her Patience, having first ordered a couple of the\n",
      "younger maids to wait on him in her stead.\n",
      "In the inner room Bao-yu took up a book and reclined on the kang to read. For a\n",
      "considerable while he remained engrossed in his reading. When eventually he did\n",
      "look up, intending to ask someone for some tea, he saw two little maids waiting\n",
      "there in silence, one of whom - evidently the older by a year or two - was an\n",
      "attractive, intelligent-looking girl. He addressed himself to her:\n",
      "‘Isn’t your name “Nella” something or other?’\n",
      "‘Citronella.’\n",
      "‘Citronella? Who on earth gave you that name?’\n",
      "‘Aroma, sir. My real name is “Soldanella”, but Miss Aroma altered it to “Citronella”.’\n",
      "‘I don’t know why she didn’t call you “Citric Acid” and have done with it,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu. ‘Citronella! - How many girls are there in your family, Citronella?’\n",
      "‘Four,’ said Citronella.\n",
      "‘And which of the four are you?’\n",
      "‘I’m the youngest.’\n",
      "‘Right!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In future you will be called Number Four”. We’re not going to\n",
      "have any more of these floral fragrances around here. It’s an insult to decent scents\n",
      "and flowers to give their names to you lot!’\n",
      "Then he asked her to pour him some tea.\n",
      "Listening attentively in the outer room, ‘Flowers’ Aroma and her Musky ally — for\n",
      "whose ears this gibe was intended — were nearly bursting themselves in their efforts\n",
      "not to laugh.\n",
      "\f",
      "All that day Bao-yu stayed in his own room, seeing no one. It was gloomy on his own,\n",
      "with nothing but reading and a little writing for amusement, but he refused to make\n",
      "use of any of his usual attendants and would have only “Number Four” to wait on\n",
      "him. Though he did not realize it, she was a designing little minx and endeavoured by\n",
      "every artifice at her command to get her hooks into him while she had the chance.\n",
      "After dinner Bao-yu came back flushed and slightly tipsy, having taken a few cups of\n",
      "wine with his meal. Normally this would have been the occasion for an evening of\n",
      "hilarity with Aroma and the rest, but today he would have to sit by his lamp alone in\n",
      "cheerless isolation. The prospect was a depressing one. Yet if he were to go running\n",
      "after her, it would seem too much like a capitulation, and her nagging would\n",
      "thenceforth become insufferable. On the other hand, to frighten her into some sort\n",
      "of compliance by asserting his mastery over her would be heartless. There was\n",
      "nothing else for it: he would just have to grin and bear it.\n",
      "‘Suppose they were all dead,’ he said to himself. ‘I should have to make do on my\n",
      "own somehow or other!’\n",
      "The thought was strangely comforting. He was able to stop worrying. He even began\n",
      "to feel quite cheerful. Having instructed Number Four to trim up the lamp and brew\n",
      "him a pot of tea, he settled down to a volume of Zhuang-zi. Presently he came to the\n",
      "following passage in the chapter called ‘Rifling Trunks’:\n",
      "\n",
      "Away then with saints and wise men, and the big thieves will cease from despoiling.\n",
      "Discard your jades, destroy your pearls, and the little thieves will cease from pilfering.\n",
      "Burn your tallies, smash your seals, and the common people will revert to their\n",
      "natural integrity. Break all the bushels and snap all the steelyards, and they will have\n",
      "no further grounds for dispute. Obliterate those ‘sacred laws’ by which the world is\n",
      "governed, and you will find yourself at last able to reason with them. If you confuse\n",
      "the pitch? pipes, break up the organs, unstring the zithers and stop up Shi Kuang’s\n",
      "ears, people will begin to make proper use of their own hearing. If you abolish all\n",
      "intricacy of design and brilliancy of colouring and glue up Li Zhu’s eyes, people will\n",
      "begin to make proper use of their own eyesight. And if you destroy your arcs and\n",
      "lines, throw away your compasses and set-squares and break the fingers of Chui the\n",
      "Cunning, people will begin to make proper use of their own skill…\n",
      "\n",
      "The words wonderfully suited his present mood. He read no further. Impulsively\n",
      "picking up a writing-brush, and with the inspiration lent him by his tipsiness, he\n",
      "added the following lines in the margin:\n",
      "\n",
      "Away then with Musk and Aroma, and the female tongue will cease from nagging.\n",
      "\f",
      "Discard Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty, destroy Dai-yu’s divine intelligence, utterly\n",
      "abolish all tender feelings, and the female heart will cease from envy. If the female\n",
      "tongue ceases from nagging there will be no further fear of quarrels and\n",
      "estrangements; if Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty is discarded there will be no further\n",
      "grounds for tender admiration; and if Dai-yu’s divine intelligence is des?troyed there\n",
      "will be no further cause for romantic imaginings. These Bao-chais, Dai-yus, Aromas\n",
      "and Musks spread their nets and dig their pits, and all the world are bewitched and\n",
      "ensnared by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having written these lines, he threw down the brush and went straight to bed.\n",
      "He was asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow and remained dead to\n",
      "the world throughout the whole of that night. Waking with the first light next\n",
      "morning, he sat up in bed to find Aroma lying fully clothed beside him outside the\n",
      "covers. He roused her with a gentle shake, all yesterday’s un?pleasantness now quite\n",
      "forgotten:\n",
      "‘Go to bed properly! You’ll get cold, sleeping like that!’\n",
      "Aroma had not, on the day previous to this, openly criticized Bao-yu for disporting\n",
      "himself at all hours of the day and night with his girl cousins because she knew from\n",
      "experience that criticism was powerless to change him. To alert him to the error of\n",
      "his ways she had instead adopted a more passive approach. She had confidently\n",
      "expected this new method to produce a speedy repentance, followed by a swift\n",
      "return to normal relations; so that when, contrary to her expectation, a whole day\n",
      "went by without his having manifested the looked-for change of heart, she was left\n",
      "with no further resources, and as a consequence had been too worried to sleep\n",
      "properly for the greater part of that night.\n",
      "But now here he was addressing her normally once more. He must have undergone a\n",
      "change of heart during the night. She forced herself to ignore him still, in order to\n",
      "drive the lesson home.\n",
      "Meeting with no response, Bao-yu reached out his hand to help her get undressed;\n",
      "but he had got no further than undo?ing the first button when she pushed his hand\n",
      "away and did it up again. He was at a loss to know what to do with her. With a gentle\n",
      "smile he took her by the hand:\n",
      "‘Now - what’s the matter?’\n",
      "He had to repeat the question several times. She fixed her eyes on him angrily:\n",
      "‘Nothing’s the matter. But now you’re awake, hadn’t you better hurry over to the\n",
      "other place to get washed? If you delay much longer, you might not be in time.’\n",
      "‘What other place?’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Aroma smiled coldly.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Why ask me? How should I know? Go wherever you like for your toilet! Let’s make\n",
      "a clean break from now on, you and I, and perhaps we’ll have a bit less of all this\n",
      "bickering and making ourselves ridiculous in front of the others. I mean to say, even if\n",
      "you get tired of going there, you’ve always got your Number Fours and Number Fives\n",
      "back here to wait on you. But as for the rest of us: even our names are “an insult to\n",
      "decent scents and flowers”!’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed:\n",
      "‘Do you still remember that?’\n",
      "‘I’ll remember that if I live to be a hundred I’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not like you: treating\n",
      "everything I say like so much wind and forgetting in the morning what you said\n",
      "yourself the night before!’\n",
      "There was something about her pretty face suffused with anger that Bao-yu found\n",
      "infinitely touching. He snatched up a jade hairpin that was lying beside the pillow and\n",
      "snapped it in two.\n",
      "‘So be it with me if I ever fail to listen to you again!’ he said.\n",
      "‘What a way to carry on at this hour of the morning!’ said Aroma, hurriedly picking\n",
      "up the pieces. ‘Whether you listen to me or not is up to you. There’s no need to get\n",
      "into such a state about it!’\n",
      "‘You don’t know how worried you make me,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘So you feel worried, do you?’ said’ Aroma smiling. ‘Now perhaps you’ll have some\n",
      "idea what I feel like most 6f the time! – Come on, let’s get washed!’\n",
      "With that the two of them got up and began their toilet.\n",
      "Later, after Bao-yu had gone off to the front apartment, Dai-yu looked in\n",
      "unexpectedly, and not finding Bao-yu in, began idly turning over the books that were\n",
      "lying on his desk. Chancing to light on the volume of Zhuang-zi that he had been\n",
      "reading the night before, her eye was drawn to the lines he had written in the margin.\n",
      "They both vexed and amused her, and she could not resist picking up a writing-brush\n",
      "and adding the following quatrain on the remaining blank space:\n",
      "\n",
      "What wretch would here, with scurrile pen,\n",
      "The text of Zhuang-zi plagiarize,\n",
      "And, heedless of his own great faults,\n",
      "Fright others with his wicked lies?\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, she went to the front apartment to see Grand?mother Jia, and from there\n",
      "on to Lady Wang’s.\n",
      "*\n",
      "\f",
      "She found everyone at Lady Wang’s in a great to-do. Xi-feng’s baby daughter was ill.\n",
      "The doctor had been called and had just finished taking her pulses.\n",
      "‘Convey my congratulations to Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian’— the doctor’s diagnosis\n",
      "was couched in the strange language which custom decrees in such cases — ‘I am\n",
      "happy to inform them that the little girl’s sickness is the small-pox!’\n",
      "Lady Wang and Xi-feng at once sent back to inquire whether the child was in any\n",
      "danger. The doctor made the following reply:\n",
      "‘Variola is, of course, a dangerous disease, but provided there are no complications,\n",
      "most cases of it are recuperable. Let the ladies lay in a plentiful supply of sanguis\n",
      "caudae, or pig’s tail blood, and plenty of essence of mulberry-worm. Applied\n",
      "externally these will ensure a satisfactory development of the pustules.’\n",
      "Xi-feng immediately became very busy. A room had to be swept out and prepared for\n",
      "the worship of the Smallpox Goddess. Orders had to be given to the servants to avoid\n",
      "the use of all fried and sautéed cookery. Patience had to be told to move Jia Lian’s\n",
      "clothes and bedding to a room outside - for sexual abstinence, too, was enjoined on\n",
      "the parents of the sufferer. A length of dark-red cloth had to be procured and made\n",
      "up into a dress for the child by the combined labours of the nurses, maids and female\n",
      "relations most closely associated with it. Finally, a ritually purified room had to be\n",
      "made ready for the two doctors who would take it in turns to examine the little\n",
      "patient and make up her medicines, and who would not be permitted to return to\n",
      "their own homes until the customary period of twelve days had elapsed. These\n",
      "arrangements having been completed, Jia Lian went off to the outer study which was\n",
      "from now on to be his bedroom, while Xi-feng and Patience joined Lady Wang in the\n",
      "daily worship and propitiation of the Smallpox Goddess.\n",
      "Jia Lian was the sort of man who will begin getting up to mischief the moment he\n",
      "takes leave of his wife. After only a couple of nights sleeping on his own he began to\n",
      "find abstin?ence extremely irksome and was reduced to slaking his fires on the more\n",
      "presentable of his pages. But other relief was at hand.\n",
      "Among the domestic staff at the Rong-guo mansion was a certain drunken,\n",
      "dilapidated cook, by surname Duo, who, because of his weakness of character and\n",
      "general uselessness, had acquired the nickname of ‘Droopy Duo’. Two years previous\n",
      "to this date Droopy’s father had provided him with a wife. She was now just turned\n",
      "twenty, a fine, good-looking young wanton, always eager to throw herself at\n",
      "whatever partners opportunity might place in her way. Droopy Duo raised no\n",
      "objection to her infidelities. As long as he had meat to eat and wine to drink and\n",
      "money in his pocket he saw no reason to concern himself about anything else.\n",
      "Consequently there was scarcely an able-bodied male in the Ning-guo and Rong-guo\n",
      "mansions who had not at one time or another sampled her wares. Because of her\n",
      "\f",
      "pneumatic charms and omnivorous promiscuity this voluptuous young limmer was\n",
      "referred to by all and sundry as ‘the Mattress’.\n",
      "Jia Lian, now separated from the wife of his bosom and fairly frying with unsatisfied\n",
      "desires, had for some time past been aware of the Mattress’s charms; but though his\n",
      "mouth had long watered to enjoy them, what with fear of his jealous young wife on\n",
      "the one hand and fear of his fancy boys on the other, he had so far found no\n",
      "opportunity of approaching her.\n",
      "The Mattress, too, had for some time past had her eye on Jia Lian, and it was a\n",
      "source of regret to her that he had so far proved unapproachable. Learning that he\n",
      "had now moved to his study outside, she managed to find excuses for passing by that\n",
      "way three or four times in a day, provoking Jia Lian to a pitch of frantic eagerness\n",
      "only to be compared with that of a starving rat confronted by some food. He was\n",
      "obliged to seek the advice of his pages and to promise them rich rewards if they\n",
      "could procure her for his pleasure. The pages were ready enough to oblige — the\n",
      "more so as they were themselves old customers of hers - and the request for an\n",
      "assignation was no sooner made than granted.\n",
      "At about ten o’clock that night, when all were abed and Droopy Duo lay collapsed on\n",
      "the kang in drunken slumbers, Jia Lian slipped noiselessly into the room for his\n",
      "pre-arranged meeting with the Mattress. The mere sight of her proved so potent a\n",
      "stimulant that without wasting any time on tender preliminaries, he took down his\n",
      "trousers and set to work at once.\n",
      "Now this wife of Duo’s had a physical peculiarity which was that as soon as the man’s\n",
      "body came into contact with her own she felt a delicious melting sensation invading\n",
      "her limbs, rendering her body soft and yielding to that of her partner, so that he had\n",
      "the impression of lying on a heap of down; and in addition to this natural\n",
      "endowment she knew more tricks of posture and more ways of exciting a man with\n",
      "murmured lewdnesses and amorous cries than a professional prostitute.\n",
      "As Jia Lian lay on top of her, wishing he could melt into her body from sheer excess of\n",
      "pleasure, she began to exercise this last accomplishment.\n",
      "‘Your little girl’s got the smallpox,’ she murmured. ‘While they’re worshipping the\n",
      "Goddess, you are supposed to keep yourself pure. Naughty man! You’re making\n",
      "yourself unclean because of me. You must leave me! Go away!’\n",
      "Jia Lian’s movements became more violent.\n",
      "‘You are my only goddess!’ he said, panting heavily. ‘I care for no other goddess but\n",
      "you!’\n",
      "At this the Mattress began to grow even more reckless in her incitements and Jia Lian\n",
      "to reveal the more disgusting of his sexual accomplishments.\n",
      "They lay a long time together when it was over, exchanging oaths and promises,\n",
      "\f",
      "unable to break apart. From that day on?wards there was a secret understanding\n",
      "between them.\n",
      "A day arrived when the smallpox poison had spent itself and Baby’s pustules showed\n",
      "signs of drying up. After the twelfth day the Smallpox Goddess was ceremoniously\n",
      "ushered off the premises, the entire family joined in a service of thanks?giving to\n",
      "Heaven and the ancestors, and there was much burn?ing of incense in discharge of\n",
      "vows made on the child’s behalf by various of its members, and much exchanging of\n",
      "congratulations and paying out of rewards. When all this was over, Jia Lian returned\n",
      "once more to the matrimonial couch. ‘A night after absence is better than a wedding\n",
      "night’ as the proverb crudely puts it, and certainly the affection shown that night by\n",
      "Jia Lian for his lady was of more than usual intensity.\n",
      "Early next morning, when Xi-feng had gone off to Grandmother Jia’s, Patience began\n",
      "putting away the clothes and bedding that had been brought in from the outer study.\n",
      "To her surprise she felt something strange in the cover of Jia Lian’s head-rest, and\n",
      "after groping inside it, fished out a black, silky tress of woman’s hair. Quick to\n",
      "understand its significance, she hid it in her sleeve and going across to the other\n",
      "room, showed it to Jia Lian and asked him what it was.\n",
      "As soon as he saw the hair, Jia Lian rushed forward to snatch it from her. She darted\n",
      "away, but he seized hold of her, and forcing her on to the kang, attempted to wrest it\n",
      "from her grasp.\n",
      "‘Mean thing!’ said Patience. ‘After I’ve gone to the trouble of asking you about it\n",
      "behind her back, you have to start being rough!’\n",
      "Just at that moment they heard Xi-feng coming. Jia Lian didn’t know whether to let\n",
      "go of Patience or make a final effort to obtain the hair. Finally, with a muttered\n",
      "entreaty, he re?leased her:\n",
      "‘Angel! Don’t let her know!’\n",
      "Patience managed to get up just as Xi-feng was entering.\n",
      "‘Quick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Open up the chest and find that pattern for Her Ladyship!’\n",
      "‘Yes madam,’ said Patience.\n",
      "While Patience was looking for the pattern, Xi-feng caught sight of Jia Lian and\n",
      "suddenly thought of something else.\n",
      "‘Have we got the things back from the outer study yet?’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Patience.\n",
      "‘Was there anything missing?’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Patience. ‘I went through them very carefully, but there was nothing\n",
      "missing.’\n",
      "‘Was there anything there that shouldn’t have been?’\n",
      "Patience laughed.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Isn’t it enough that there was nothing missing? Why should there be anything\n",
      "extra?’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed, too.\n",
      "‘He was nearly a fortnight outside. I wouldn’t bank on his having kept himself clean\n",
      "all that time. There might have been something left behind by one of his little friends:\n",
      "a ring or a sash or something.’\n",
      "Jia Lian turned pale with fright. He grimaced piteously at Patience from behind\n",
      "Xi-feng’s back, and drawing a finger across his throat, silently entreated her to keep\n",
      "her discovery hidden.\n",
      "Patience affected not to notice him.\n",
      "‘It’s funny you should say that, Mrs Lian. Exactly the same thought occurred to me;\n",
      "but though I went through his things very carefully, I didn’t find anything suspicious.\n",
      "If you don’t believe me, you can have a look yourself.’\n",
      "‘Silly girl!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you imagine that if there were really anything there he\n",
      "would let us look?’\n",
      "And taking the pattern from her she went out again. Patience pointed a finger at her\n",
      "own nose and wagged her head from side to side.\n",
      "‘How are you going to thank me for that?’\n",
      "‘You’re a sweet little darling!’\n",
      "He beamed delightedly and lunged forward to embrace her. Patience dangled the\n",
      "hair in front of him:\n",
      "‘You’ll have to watch your step from now on,’ she said. ‘Now I’ve got something to\n",
      "keep you in order with. If you misbehave...!’\n",
      "‘All right, you look after it, then. But’ - his tone became entreating - ‘don’t,\n",
      "whatever you do, let her find out!’\n",
      "He said this to put her off her guard. As soon as her defences were relaxed he made a\n",
      "quick grab and snatched it from her.\n",
      "‘Perhaps you’d better not have it, after all,’ he said with a grin of triumph. ‘If I have\n",
      "it I can burn it, and then it’s all over and done with.’\n",
      "He stowed the hair in the side of his boot as he said this. Patience clenched her teeth\n",
      "in anger.\n",
      "‘You’re mean! Burn the bridge when you’re safely over the river - that’s your way,\n",
      "isn’t it? All right then, you needn’t expect me to tell lies for you in future!’\n",
      "In Jia Lian’s lascivious eyes her anger made her adorable. He felt himself becoming\n",
      "excited, and throwing his arms round her, he asked her to let him take her. But\n",
      "Patience struggled free and ran from the room, leaving him doubled up in a fury of\n",
      "frustrated desire.\n",
      "‘Little cock-teaser!’ he shouted after her. ‘You deliberately provoked me, and now\n",
      "\f",
      "you run away!’\n",
      "‘Who provoked you?’ Patience giggled from outside the window. ‘You shouldn’t be\n",
      "so randy! Do you expect me to make the Mistress hate me just for the sake of making\n",
      "you feel comfortable?’\n",
      "‘You needn’t worry about her,’ said Jia Lian. ‘One of these days when I get my\n",
      "temper up I’m going to lay into that jealous whore and break every bone in her body.\n",
      "Then perhaps she’ll know who’s master round here. She watches me like a bloody\n",
      "thief. She can talk to men when she likes, but I’m not supposed to talk to women, oh\n",
      "no! If I’m talking to a woman and just happen to get a bit close, she immediately\n",
      "starts suspecting something. But if she wants to go chattering and larking around\n",
      "with Bao or Rong or any other bloody male on the premises, that’s supposed to be all\n",
      "right! You wait! One of these days I’ll stop her seeing anyone at all!’\n",
      "‘She’s every right to watch you,’ said Patience, ‘and you’ve no right at all to be\n",
      "jealous of her. She’s always been perfectly straight and above board where men are\n",
      "concerned; but you — whatever you do you’ve got something nasty in mind! You\n",
      "make even me worried, never mind about her!’\n",
      "‘Oh, shut up! ‘ said Jia Lian. ‘You’re all perfect, aren’t you? It’s just me that’s always\n",
      "up to something nasty! One of these days I’ll make a clean sweep of the lot of you!’\n",
      "Just at that moment Xi-feng stepped into the courtyard and saw Patience standing\n",
      "outside the window.\n",
      "‘If you want to talk,’ she said, ‘why not talk inside the room? What’s the idea of\n",
      "running outside and bawling through the window?’\n",
      "‘Don’t ask her!’ said Jia Lian’s voice from inside. ‘She thinks there’s a tiger in the\n",
      "room and she’s afraid of being eaten!’\n",
      "‘He’s in there on his own,’ said Patience. ‘What should I be doing in there with\n",
      "him?’\n",
      "‘All the more reason for being in there, I should have thought, if he’s on his own,’\n",
      "said Xi-feng, smiling rather spite?fully.\n",
      "‘Is that remark intended for me?’ said Patience.\n",
      "‘Who else?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘You’ll make me say something I shall feel sorry for in a minute,’ said Patience; and\n",
      "instead of standing aside and raising the door-blind for her mistress, she entered\n",
      "ahead of her, dropped it rudely in her face, and marched angrily through the\n",
      "sitting-room to one of the rooms at the back.\n",
      "‘What’s the matter with Patience? The girl’s gone mad!’ said Xi-feng when she had\n",
      "raised the blind again and let her?self in. ‘I really do believe she is trying to displace\n",
      "me. You’d better look out, my friend: I’ll have the hide off you!’\n",
      "‘Bravo! Good for Patience!’ said Jia Lian, who had re?treated on to the kang and\n",
      "\f",
      "was applauding the comedy from that safer eminence. ‘I didn’t know she had it in her.\n",
      "In future I shall take that girl more seriously.’\n",
      "‘It’s you who’ve let her get above herself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I hold you directly\n",
      "responsible for this!’\n",
      "‘Oh no!’ said Jia Lian. ‘If you two want to quarrel, I’m not going to stand between\n",
      "you and take all the knocks, I’m getting out of here!’\n",
      "‘I’m sure I don’t know where you think you’ll go to,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Don’t you worry, I’ve got somewhere to go to,’ said Jia Lian, and he began to go;\n",
      "but Xi-feng stopped him.\n",
      "‘No, don’t go! There’s something else I want to talk to you about.’\n",
      "But if you want to know what it was, you will have to wait for the next chapter.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hearing that Xi-feng wanted to consult him about something, Jia Lian halted and\n",
      "asked her what it was.\n",
      "‘It’s Bao-chai’s birthday on the twenty-first,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What do you think we\n",
      "\f",
      "ought to do about it?’\n",
      "‘How should I know?’ said Jia Lian. ‘You’ve managed plenty of big birthday\n",
      "celebrations before in your time. Why have you become so helpless all of a sudden?’\n",
      "‘There are fixed rules for everything when you are planning a big grown-up\n",
      "celebration,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but in Bao-chai’s case she’s neither exactly grown-up nor\n",
      "exactly a child any longer. That’s why I wanted your advice.’\n",
      "Jia Lian lowered his head and thought for a moment.\n",
      "‘Why, you’re being stupid!’ he said presently. ‘There’s a precedent right in front of\n",
      "you. What about Dai-yu? All you’ve got to do is find what arrangements you made in\n",
      "the past for her and do exactly the same for Bao-chai now.’\n",
      "‘Do you suppose I didn’t think of that?’ said Xi-feng with scorn. ‘I’m not that stupid!\n",
      "The point is that yesterday, be?cause of something Grandma said, I started asking\n",
      "them all their birthdays and ages, and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the\n",
      "twenty-first Bao-chai is going to be fifteen. Now that doesn’t qualify for a full-scale\n",
      "celebration, but it is a sort of coming-of-age, and when Grandma heard about it she\n",
      "said she wanted to sponsor something for it herself. So obviously, whatever we do, it\n",
      "can’t be quite the same as what we’ve done in the past for Dai-yu.’\n",
      "‘Well in that case,’ said Jia Lian, ‘take what you did for Dai-yu as a basis and just add\n",
      "on a bit.’\n",
      "‘That’s what I’d thought of doing,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but I wanted to see what you\n",
      "thought before doing anything definite, because I didn’t want to go adding extras on\n",
      "my own initiative and then have you complaining that you hadn’t been properly\n",
      "consulted.’\n",
      "‘You can cut that out!’ said Jia Lian — though not ill-?humouredly. ‘You know you\n",
      "don’t really mean a word of it! Just stop snooping on me all the time, that’s all I ask.\n",
      "You won’t hear any complaints from me then about not being consulted!’\n",
      "With that he walked off: but whither, or to whom, our narrative does not disclose.\n",
      "It tells us instead that Shi Xiang-yun, having spent a con?siderable part of the New\n",
      "Year holiday with the Jias, was now on the point of returning home, but was urged by\n",
      "Grand?mother Jia to wait for Bao-chai’s birthday and not go back until she had seen\n",
      "the plays. Xiang-yun agreed to stay and sent someone home with instructions to tell\n",
      "them that she would be returning a little later than planned and to fetch a couple of\n",
      "pieces of her own embroidery that she could give to Bao-chai as a birthday-present.\n",
      "Ever since Bao-chai’s first arrival, Grandmother Jia had been pleasurably impressed\n",
      "by her placid and dependable disposition, and now that she was about to spend her\n",
      "first ‘big’ birthday in the Jia household, the old lady resolved to make it a memorable\n",
      "one. Taking twenty taels of silver from her private store, she summoned Xi-feng and\n",
      "directed her to spend it on providing wine and plays for a celebration. Xi-feng made\n",
      "\f",
      "this the occasion for a little raillery.\n",
      "‘If the old lady says she wants her grandchild’s birthday celebrated,’ she said, ‘then\n",
      "celebrated it must be, and we must all jump to it without arguing! But if she’s going\n",
      "to start asking for plays as well, all I can say to that is that if she’s in the mood for a\n",
      "bit of fun, I’m afraid she’s going to have to pay for it. She’s going to have to cough up\n",
      "something out of those private savings of hers she’s been hoarding all these years -\n",
      "not wait until the last minute and then fish out a measly little twenty taels to pay for\n",
      "the party: that’s just another way of telling us we’ve got to pay for it ourselves. I\n",
      "mean, if you were really hard up, it would be another matter: but you’ve got boxes\n",
      "and boxes of boodle — the bottoms are dropping out of them, they’re so full! It’s\n",
      "pure meanness, that’s what it is! You forget, Grannie, when you go to heaven young\n",
      "Bao-yu won’t be the only one who’ll walk ahead of the hearse. You’ve got other\n",
      "grandchildren too, don’t forget! You don’t have to leave everything to him. The rest\n",
      "of us may not be much use, but you mustn’t be too hard on us. Twenty taels! Do you\n",
      "really think that’s enough to pay for a party and plays?’\n",
      "At this point the entire company burst into laughter, which Grandmother Jia joined in\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "‘Just listen to her!’ she said. ‘I thought I had a fairly sharp tongue, but I’m no match\n",
      "for this one: “Clack-clack, clack-clack” — it’s worse than a pair of wooden clappers!\n",
      "Even your mother-in-law daren’t argue with me, my dear! Don’t pick on me!’\n",
      "‘Mother-in-law is just as soppy about Bao-yu as you are,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve got no\n",
      "one to tell my troubles to. And you say I’m sharp-tongued!’\n",
      "Xi-feng’s mock-lugubriousness set the old lady off in another squall of laughter. She\n",
      "loved to be teased, and Xi-feng’s bantering put her in great good humour.\n",
      "That night, when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were\n",
      "standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own\n",
      "apartments, Grandmother Jia asked Bao-chai what sort of plays she liked best and\n",
      "what her favourite dishes were. Bao-chai was well aware that her grandmother, like\n",
      "most old women, enjoyed the livelier, more rackety sort of plays and liked sweet and\n",
      "pappy things to eat, so she framed her answers entirely in terms of these preferences.\n",
      "The old lady was delighted.\n",
      "Next day presents of clothing and various other objects, to which Lady Wang, Xi-feng,\n",
      "Dai-yu and the rest had all contributed, were sent round to Bao-chai’s. Our narrative\n",
      "supplies no details.\n",
      "At last the twenty-first arrived. A dear little stage had been erected in the courtyard\n",
      "outside Grandmother Jia’s apartment and a newly trained troupe of child actors able\n",
      "to perform both Kun-qu and the noisier Yi-qiang type of plays had been en?gaged. In\n",
      "the apartment’s main sitting-room a semicircle of little tables were arranged facing\n",
      "\f",
      "outwards towards the stage and laid in preparation for a feast. No outsiders were\n",
      "invited. The guests of honour were Aunt Xue, Shi Xiang-yun and Bao-?chai herself. All\n",
      "the others invited were members of the family.\n",
      "Early that morning Bao-yu, not seeing Dai-yu around, went to look for her in her\n",
      "room and found her still reclining on the kang.\n",
      "‘Get up and have something to eat!’ he said. ‘The players will be starting shortly.\n",
      "Tell me some play you like so that I shall know which one to choose!’\n",
      "‘If you’re so anxious to please me,’ said Dai-yu coldly, ‘you ought to hire a troupe\n",
      "specially and put on all my favourites. It’s a cheap sort of kindness to treat me at\n",
      "someone else’s expense!’\n",
      "‘Never mind!’ said Bao-yu. ‘When we hire a troupe for you, you’ll be able to return\n",
      "the compliment.’\n",
      "He hauled her up from the kang, and the two of them went off hand in hand\n",
      "together.\n",
      "As soon as they had eaten, it was time to talk about choosing the plays and\n",
      "Grandmother Jia called on Bao-chai to begin. Bao-chai made a show of declining; but\n",
      "it was her birthday, and in the end she gave in and selected a piece about Monkey\n",
      "from The Journey to the West. Grandmother Jia was pleased.\n",
      "Aunt Xue was now invited to pick a play, but as her own daughter had just chosen,\n",
      "she refused. Grandmother Jia did not press her and passed on to Xi-feng. Xi-feng\n",
      "would nor?mally have refused to take precedence over her aunt and mother-in-law,\n",
      "who were both present, but Grandmother had commanded and must be obeyed. As\n",
      "she happened to know that the old lady’s partiality for lively plays was particularly\n",
      "strong in the case of those which had lots of jokes and clowning in them, she selected\n",
      "a piece entitled Liu Er Pawns His Clothes in order to make sure that this element was\n",
      "not lacking from the programme. As she had anticipated, Grand?mother Jia was even\n",
      "more delighted by this second choice.\n",
      "Next Dai-yu was asked to choose. She deferred to Aunt Xing and Aunt Wang; but\n",
      "Grandmother Jia was insistent:\n",
      "‘I’ve brought you young people here today for some fun,’ she said. ‘I want you to\n",
      "enjoy yourselves. Never mind about them! I didn’t go to all this trouble just for their\n",
      "sakes! They are lucky to be here at all, having all this good food and enter?tainment\n",
      "for nothing: you surely don’t think that on top of that I’m going to let them choose\n",
      "the plays?’\n",
      "The others all laughed, and Dai-yu chose a play. Then Bao-yu, Shi Xiang-yun,\n",
      "Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Li Wan each chose a play in turn, after which the\n",
      "little players proceeded to perform them in the order in which they had been\n",
      "selected.\n",
      "\f",
      "When the time came to bring in the wine and begin the feast, Grandmother Jia\n",
      "invited Bao-chai to choose again. This time she asked for Zhi-shen at the Monastery\n",
      "Gate.\n",
      "‘Why do you keep choosing plays like that?’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘To hear you talk, it doesn’t sound as if all your years of play-going have taught you\n",
      "much,’ said Bao-chai. ‘This is an excellent play, both from the point of view of the\n",
      "music and of the words.’\n",
      "‘I can’t stand noisy plays,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I never could.’\n",
      "‘If you call this a noisy play,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it proves that you don’t know what\n",
      "you’re talking about. Come over here and I’ll explain. This Zhi-shen at the Monastery\n",
      "Gate is a “Ruby Lips” sequence in the Northern mode. That means, musically\n",
      "speaking, that it is in a vigorous, somewhat staccato style. In fact the musical\n",
      "excellence of this piece goes without saying. But apart from that, the libretto is good,\n",
      "too. The words of Zhi-shen’s “Clinging Vine” aria, which is the last but one in the\n",
      "sequence, are particularly fine.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was interested, drew his chair closer, and begged her to let him hear them.\n",
      "Lowering her voice so as not to dis?turb the others, she half-sang, half-recited them\n",
      "for his benefit:\n",
      "\n",
      "        ‘I dash aside the manly tear\n",
      "        And take leave of my monkish home.\n",
      "        A word of thanks to you, my Master dear,\n",
      "        Who tonsured me before the Lotus Throne:\n",
      "        ‘T was not my luck to stay with you,\n",
      "        And in a short while I must say adieu,\n",
      "        Naked and friendless through the world to roam.\n",
      "        I ask no goods, no gear to take away,\n",
      "        Only straw sandals and a broken bowl,\n",
      "        To beg from place to place as best I may.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Bao-yu listened enthralled tapping his knee and nodding his head in time to her\n",
      "singing. When she had done, he agreed enthusiastically about the excellence of the\n",
      "words and congratulated her on the extraordinary breadth of her know?ledge.\n",
      "‘Sh!’ said Dai-yu, looking round crossly in Bao-yu’s direction. ‘Can’t you be a bit\n",
      "quieter and attend to the play? This is Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate we’re\n",
      "supposed to be listening to, not Jing-de Acts the Madman!’\n",
      "Xiang-yun found this very funny.\n",
      "They continued to watch plays until the evening. Grand?mother Jia had taken a\n",
      "\f",
      "particular fancy to the little player who had acted the heroine’s parts and the one\n",
      "who had played the clown, and when the last performance was over, she asked for\n",
      "them to be brought in to see her. She found them very ‘sweet’ - even more so on a\n",
      "closer inspection - and asked them their ages. The leading lady turned out to be\n",
      "eleven and the clown only nine! There were murmurs and exclamations from all\n",
      "present when they heard this, and Grandmother Jia told someone to give them\n",
      "delicacies from the table and a present of money each, in addition to what they\n",
      "would receive as members of the troupe.\n",
      "Meanwhile Xi-feng appeared to be very much amused about something.\n",
      "‘The way that child there is made-up makes him look so like someone we know,’\n",
      "she said. ‘Haven’t any of you noticed?’\n",
      "Bao-chai knew whom she was referring to, but merely nodded her head slightly\n",
      "without replying. Bao-yu, too, nodded, but did not dare to reply. Only Xiang-yun was\n",
      "tactless enough to say anything:\n",
      "‘Oh, I know!’ she blurted out. ‘Like Cousin Lin, you mean?’\n",
      "Bao-yu shot a quick glance in her direction; but it was too late. Xiang-yun’s reply had\n",
      "prompted the others to look more carefully, with the result that they all\n",
      "instantaneously burst out laughing, so striking was the resemblance. Shortly after\n",
      "this the party broke up.\n",
      "During the evening Xiang-yun ordered Kingfisher to start packing. Kingfisher\n",
      "remonstrated:\n",
      "‘What’s the hurry? Why not wait till we’re going? There’ll be plenty of time before\n",
      "we go.’\n",
      "‘We’re going first thing tomorrow,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What’s the point of staying any\n",
      "longer? You can see from the looks on their faces that we are not welcome here.’\n",
      "Bao-yu chanced to overhear this remark and hurried in to her:\n",
      "‘You’re wrong to be offended with me, coz. The others all know how sensitive\n",
      "Cousin Lin is, and they wouldn’t answer because they were afraid of upsetting her.\n",
      "When you sud?denly spoke up without realizing, I knew she was bound to be upset,\n",
      "and that’s the reason why I looked at you like that. I was worried for your sake,\n",
      "because I was afraid she would be offended with you. That you should now get angry\n",
      "with me is really rather unfair. If it had been anyone else but you, I shouldn’t have\n",
      "minded whether they offended her or not. I shouldn’t have felt that much concern\n",
      "about them.’\n",
      "Xiang-yun silenced him with an imperious wave of her hand:\n",
      "‘You can save your fine speeches for someone else. They’re wasted on me.\n",
      "Obviously I’m not in the same class as your Cousin Lin. It’s all right for other people\n",
      "to laugh at her; but as soon as I say anything about her, I’m at once in the wrong. I’m\n",
      "\f",
      "not really worthy to speak about her at all. She’s the young lady of the house. I’m\n",
      "only a little nobody!’\n",
      "‘I was only thinking of you,’ said Bao-yu in great agitation, ‘yet now you put me in\n",
      "the wrong. May I straightway turn into dust and be trodden beneath ten thousand\n",
      "feet if I had any but the kindest intentions!’\n",
      "‘You are too glib with your ridiculous oaths,’ said Xiang-?yun. ‘This is no time for\n",
      "swearing. You can keep that kind of talk for that sensitive, easily upset person you\n",
      "were talking about. She knows how to handle you. Don’t try it on me: it makes me\n",
      "thick!’\n",
      "With these words she walked off into the inner room of Grandmother Jia’s apartment\n",
      "and lay down on the kang in a rage.\n",
      "Very much out of countenance, Bao-yu went off to look for Dai-yu. She must have\n",
      "been waiting for him, for just as he was entering the room, she pushed him out again\n",
      "and shut the door. Totally at a loss to understand her behaviour, he called to her\n",
      "softly through the window:\n",
      "‘Dai, dear! Dai!’\n",
      "But she took no notice.\n",
      "Bao-yu stood there disconsolately, hanging his head in silence. Nightingale knew\n",
      "what was happening, but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene; so he\n",
      "continued to stand there like an idiot, until at last Dai-yu thought he must have gone\n",
      "back to his own room, and opened the door again. When she saw him still standing\n",
      "there, she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time, and allowed him\n",
      "to follow her back into the room.\n",
      "‘There’s always a reason for everything,’ he said. ‘If you tell people what it is, they\n",
      "don’t feel so bad about it. You can’t suddenly get angry with me for no reason\n",
      "whatever. What is all this about?’\n",
      "‘Don’t ask me! said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I don’t know. I’m only a figure of fun - the sort of\n",
      "person you might compare with a child actor in order to get a good laugh from the\n",
      "others.’\n",
      "‘I never made the comparison,’ said Bao-yu hotly, ‘and I never laughed at you. Why\n",
      "should you be angry with me?’\n",
      "‘You would like to have made the comparison; you would like to have laughed,’ said\n",
      "Dai-yu. “To me your way of not comparing and not laughing was worse than the\n",
      "others’ laughing and comparing!’\n",
      "Bao-yu found this unanswerable.\n",
      "‘However,’ Dai-yu went on, ‘that I could forgive. But what about that look you gave\n",
      "Yun? Just what did you mean by that? I think I know what you meant. You meant to\n",

      "on the lantern, which was then taken away by the eunuch.\n",

      "Master Huan. Her Grace has thought of answers to all the riddles sent her by the\n",
      "young ladies and gentlemen, but she does not know whether or not they are correct.’\n",
      "He showed them the answers written down. Some were right and some were wrong,\n",
      "but even those whose riddles had been incorrectly answered deemed it prudent to\n",
      "pretend that the answers they had received were the right ones.\n",
      "The eunuch proceeded to distribute prizes for answering the Imperial Concubine’s\n",
      "riddle. Everyone who had guessed correctly received an ivory note-case made by\n",
      "Palace craftsmen and a bamboo tea-whisk. Ying-chun and Jia Huan were the only\n",
      "ones who did not receive anything. Ying-chun treated the matter as a joke and\n",
      "rapidly dismissed it from her mind, but Jia Huan was very much put out. To make\n",
      "matters worse, the eunuch went on to query Jia Huan’s own riddle:\n",
      "‘Her Grace says that she has not answered Master Huan’s riddle because she could\n",
      "not make any sense of it. She told me to bring it back and ask him what it means.’\n",
      "Intrigued, the others crowded round to look. This is what Jia Huan had written:\n",

      "         ‘Big brother with eight sits all day on the bed;\n",
      "Little brother with two sits on the roof’s head.’.\n",

      "There was a loud laugh when they had finished reading it. Jia Huan told the eunuch\n",
      "the answer: a head-rest and a ridge-end. The eunuch made a note of it and, after\n",
      "taking tea, departed once more.\n",
      "Fired with enthusiasm by Yuan-chun’s example, old Lady Jia decided to hold a riddle\n",
      "party. A very elegant lantern in the form of a three-leaved screen was hurriedly\n",
      "constructed on her orders and set up in the hall. When that had been done, she told\n",
      "all the boys and girls to make up a riddle - being careful to keep the answers to\n",
      "themselves - write it on a slip of paper, and stick it on her lantern-screen. Then,\n",
      "having pre?pared the best fragrant tea to drink, a variety of good things to eat, and\n",
      "lots of little gifts to serve as prizes, she was ready to begin. Jia Zheng observed the\n",
      "old lady’s excitement when he got back from Court and came along himself in the\n",
      "evening to join in the fun.\n",
      "There were three tables. Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng, Bao-yu and Jia Huan sat at the\n",

      "table on the kang, while below, Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Xiang-yun sat at one\n",
      "table and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at another. The floor below the kang was\n",
      "thronged with old women and maids in attendance. Li Wan and Xi-feng had a table to\n",
      "them?selves in an inner room.\n",
      "‘Where’s my little Lan?’ said Jia Zheng, not seeing Jia Lan at any of the tables.\n",
      "One of the serving-women went into the inner room to ask Li Wan. She rose to reply\n",
      "out of respect for her father-in-law:\n",
      "‘He refuses to come because he says his Grandpa Zheng hasn’t invited him.’\n",
      "The others were much amused when the woman relayed this answer back to Jia\n",
      "Zheng.\n",
      "‘He’s a stubborn little chap when he’s made his mind up!’ they said. But they\n",
      "thought none the worse of him for that.\n",
      "Jia Zheng quickly sent Jia Huan with two of the old women to fetch him. When he\n",
      "arrived, Grandmother Jia made him squeeze up beside her on her side of the table\n",
      "and gave him a handful of nuts and dried fruits to eat. The little boy’s presence\n",
      "provided the company with something to laugh and talk about. But not for long.\n",
      "Bao-yu, who normally did most of the talking on occasions like this, was today\n",
      "reduced by his father’s presence to saying no more than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to remarks\n",
      "made by other people. As for the rest: Xiang-yun, in spite of her sheltered upbringing,\n",
      "was normally an animated, not to say indefatigable talker, but this evening she too\n",
      "seemed to have been afflicted with dumbness by Jia Zheng’s presence; Dai-yu was at\n",
      "the best of times unwilling to say very much in company from a sort of aristocratic\n",
      "lethargy which was a part of her nature; and Bao-chai, whose punctilious correctness\n",
      "made her always sparing in the use of words, even though on this occasion she was\n",
      "probably the least uncomfortable of those present, said little to advance the\n",
      "conversation. As a consequence, what should have been a jolly, intimate family party\n",
      "was painfully unnatural and restrained.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia knew as well as everyone else that this state of affairs was entirely\n",
      "owing to Jia Zheng’s presence, and after the wine had gone round for the third time,\n",
      "she attempted to drive him off to bed. Jia Zheng, for his part, was perfectly well\n",
      "aware that he was being driven away so that the younger people could feel freer to\n",
      "enjoy themselves and, smiling forcedly, appealed against his banishment:\n",
      "‘When they told me earlier today that you were planning to give a riddle party, I\n",
      "specially prepared a contribution to the feast so that I might come and join you. You\n",
      "have so much affection for your grandchildren, Mama. Can you not spare just a tiny\n",
      "bit for your son?’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia laughed:\n",
      "‘They can’t talk naturally while you are here. All you are doing is making it gloomy\n",
      "\f",
      "for me. I can’t abide it. Well, if you’ve come to answer riddles, I’ll give you a riddle.\n",
      "But if you can’t guess the answer, you will have to pay me a for?feit.’\n",
      "‘Yes, of course,’ said Jia Zheng eagerly. ‘And if I guess right, I shall expect to be given\n",
      "a prize.’\n",
      "‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The monkey’s tail reaches from tree-top to\n",
      "ground. It’s the name of a fruit.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng knew that the answer to this hoary old chestnut was ‘a longan’ (long ‘un),\n",
      "but pretended not to, and made all kinds of absurd guesses, each time incurring the\n",
      "obligation to pay his mother a forfeit, before finally giving the right answer and\n",
      "receiving the old lady’s prize. Then he propounded a riddle of his own for her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My body’s square,\n",

      "\n",
      "—It’s a useful object.’\n",
      "He whispered the answer to Bao-yu, who, readily understand?ing what was expected\n",
      "of him, surreptitiously passed it on to Grandmother Jia. The old lady, having thought\n",
      "for a bit and decided that it sounded all right, said:\n",
      "‘An inkstone.’\n",
      "‘Bravo, Mamma! Right first time!’ said Jia Zheng, and turn?ing round to address the\n",
      "servants, he asked them to bring in the presents for Lady Jia. There was an answering\n",
      "call from the women below, and presently a number of them came for?ward bearing\n",
      "trays and boxes of various shapes and sizes which they handed up onto the kang.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia examined them one by one. They all contained traditional Lantern\n",
      "Festival presents, but in new and exquisite designs and of the very highest quality.\n",
      "The old lady was obviously pleased.\n",
      "‘Come, children!’ she commanded jovially. ‘Give the Master a drink!’\n",
      "Bao-yu stood up and poured wine from the wine-kettle into a little cup and Ying-chun\n",
      "handed it ceremoniously to her uncle.\n",
      "‘Have a look at the riddles on the screen,’ said Grandmother Jia when Jia Zheng,\n",
      "with equal ceremony, had drained the cup. ‘They were all made up by the children.\n",
      "See if you can tell me the answers.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng rose from his seat and went up to the lantern-screen. The first riddle he\n",

      "affixed to it, and there and then Jia Qin was issued with a tally and sent to the\n",
      "counting-house to collect the money.\n",
      "When the three hundred taels of shining silver had been weighed and counted and\n",
      "handed over, Jia Qin picked up a piece at random and tossed it to the cashiers to ‘buy\n",
      "themselves a cup of tea with’. He had a boy to carry the money back home for him,\n",
      "and after taking counsel with his mother he hired a stout little donkey for himself to\n",

      "that he was wanted by his father. At this bolt from the blue his countenance fell and\n",

      "‘Her Grace has expressed a fear that by spending your time in constant amusement\n",
      "outside you may become an idler and a dullard, and she has directed that you and\n",

      "‘I suppose there are no limits to what a maid may be called,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but\n",
      "who would have picked an outlandish name like that to give her?’\n",
      "Lady Wang could see that he was displeased and did her best to cover up for Bao-yu:\n",

      "about a little thing like that?’\n",
      "‘It doesn’t really matter,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘and there is no need for him to change the\n",
      "name; but it demonstrates what I have always said about the boy: he is\n",
      "fundamentally incapable of caring about serious matters and preoccupies himself\n",
      "with poetic frivolities and other such airy-fairy nonsense as a substitute for solid\n",

      "‘You’ve got a nerve!’ said Jia Lian laughing. ‘Your son? He’s five or six years older\n",
      "than you.’\n",
      "‘How old are you then?’ Bao-yu asked him.\n",
      "‘Eighteen.’\n",
      "Being a sharp-witted young man who knew how to make the most of an opportunity,\n",
      "Jia Yun was quick to turn Bao?-yu’s jest to good account.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There’s a saying about “grandsires in cradles and babbies with beards”, you know;\n",
      "and even if I am older than you, “the highest mountain can’t shut out the sun”! I’ve\n",
      "had no one to care for me during these last few years since my father died, and if you\n",
      "don’t mind having so stupid a person for your son, I should certainty be very happy\n",
      "to have you for a father.’\n",
      "‘You hear that?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Now you’ve got yourself a son! You’ll find that\n",
      "parenthood is no laughing matter, I can tell you!’\n",
      "He left them and went inside, chuckling to himself.\n",
      "Bao-yu smiled at his new ‘son’:\n",
      "‘Next time you’re free, come and see me. Don’t waste your time trying to join in\n",
      "their little intrigues! I’m afraid I’m not free at the moment, but if you will come round\n",
      "to my study tomorrow, we can spend all day together, and I shall be able to show you\n",
      "round the garden.’\n",
      "With these words he mounted his horse and set off, his pages at his back, for Jia\n",
      "She’s.\n",
      "Bao-yu found that his uncle was suffering from nothing more serious than a chill. He\n",
      "delivered his grandmother’s message first and then asked after his uncle on his own\n",
      "behalf. Jia She stood up to hear what his mother had to say, and when Bao-yu had\n",
      "finished, ordered a servant to take him to his Aunt Xing’s room. Bao-yu withdrew and\n",
      "followed the servant through the back and across the courtyard to the main\n",
      "reception room. Seeing him enter, Lady Xing rose to her feet to ask after\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, then sat down again to be asked after in turn by Bao-yu. Then she\n",
      "drew him up to sit beside her on the kang and asked him about the others, at the\n",
      "same time giving orders for tea to be served.\n",
      "While they were still sipping the tea, little Jia Cong, the son of one of Jia She’s\n",
      "concubines, came in to say ‘hullo’ to his Cousin Bao.\n",
      "‘Where did this little ragamuffin come from?’ Lady Xing scolded. ‘I don’t know what\n",
      "that Nannie of yours can be thinking of to let you get in such a state! I declare, your\n",
      "face is as black as a crow! No one would ever think to look at you that you were an\n",
      "educated little boy and came from a good family!’\n",
      "While she scolded, Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived, their duty call on Jia She evidently\n",
      "just completed. Lady Xing made them sit on chairs below the kang. Seeing Bao-yu up\n",
      "on the kang with Lady Xing and sharing her cushion, and observing how she fondled\n",
      "and petted him, Jia Huan soon began to feel uncomfortable and made a sign to Jia\n",
      "Lan indi?cating that they should go. As Jia Huan was his uncle, Jia Lan had to do as he\n",
      "said, so the little boy and the big one rose together to take their leave. Bao-yu said\n",
      "he would go with them, but Lady Xing stopped him with a gracious smile:\n",
      "‘You sit where you are! I’ve got something else to say to you.’\n",
      "\f",
      "He was obliged to stay. Lady Xing turned to the other two:\n",
      "‘When you get back, do each of you give my regards to your mothers. I won’t ask\n",
      "you to stay to dinner because I’ve already got the girls here and they are making so\n",
      "much rumpus that it’s given me a headache.’\n",
      "Jia Huan and Jia Lan promised to convey her greetings and went out.\n",
      "‘Where are the girls, then?’ Bao-yu asked after they had gone. ‘I haven’t seen\n",
      "them.’\n",
      "‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Lady Xing nonchalantly. ‘They only sat here for a few\n",
      "moments, then they went round to the back. They’re round the back somewhere or\n",
      "other.’\n",
      "‘You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about, Aunt. What was it\n",
      "you wanted to tell me?’\n",
      "‘Oh, nothing at all!’ said Lady Xing gaily. ‘I only said that because I wanted you to\n",
      "stay and have dinner here with me and the girls. And I’ve got something nice for you\n",
      "to take back with you afterwards.’\n",
      "Bao-yu and his aunt chatted away, and before long it was time for dinner and the\n",
      "three girls were called in. A table and chairs were arranged, the table was laid, and\n",
      "Lady Xing, her daughter Ying-chun, her two nieces and her nephew sat down to their\n",
      "meal. When it was over, Bao-yu went in to take his leave of Jia She, after which he\n",
      "and the girls returned to their own side of the mansion. There they first went in to\n",
      "see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then returned to their own apartments for\n",
      "the night.\n",
      "So much for Bao-yu and the girls.\n",
      "Let us return to Jia Yun who, after his encounter with Bao-?yu, had gone in to see Jia\n",
      "Lian and ask him if there was any prospect of a job.\n",
      "‘A job turned up only the other day,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but unfortunately your Aunt\n",
      "Feng was very anxious that I should give it to Jia Qin and I’m afraid I let him have it.\n",
      "However, she did mention that there will soon be a lot of planting to do in the garden,\n",
      "and she promised that as soon as that work turns up we shall definitely hand it over\n",
      "to you.’\n",
      "Jia Yun was silent for some moments, then he said:\n",
      "‘All right. I’ll just have to go on waiting, then. But would you mind not mentioning\n",
      "this visit to Auntie? I can tell her about it myself, if need be, next time I see her.’\n",
      "‘I shan’t mention it,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I’ve got better things to do with my time than go\n",
      "running after her to talk about things like this! Tomorrow I have to go to Xing-yi, by\n",
      "the way. I have to get back on the same day — but perhaps you’d better wait until\n",
      "the day after tomorrow before coming round again. In fact, you’d better wait until\n",
      "the evening of the day after tomorrow - some time after the beginning of the first\n",
      "\f",
      "watch. Any time before that I shall be busy.’\n",
      "He terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes.\n",
      "Jia Yun went out of the Rong-guo mansion and set off for home, ruminating as he\n",
      "went. A plan at last formed in his mind. Instead of returning home, he struck off for\n",
      "the house of his maternal uncle.\n",
      "His uncle’s name was Bu Shi-ren. He was the proprietor of a perfumery, and when Jia\n",
      "Yun arrived had only just got back from the shop. Seeing his nephew enter, he asked\n",
      "him what he had come about.\n",
      "‘I’m on to something which needs your help,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Please Uncle, could you\n",
      "possibly let me have four ounces of Barus camphor and four ounces of musk on\n",
      "credit? I promise faithfully that you shall have the money by Autumn Quarter-day.’\n",
      "Bu Shi-ren ‘humph-ed’ scornfully:\n",
      "‘Don’t talk to me about credit! A while ago we let one of the assistants have several\n",
      "taels’ worth of goods on credit for one of his relations, and we haven’t seen the\n",
      "money for it yet. We had to share the loss between us. We’ve got a written\n",
      "agreement now that in future if any of us gives credit to a friend or relation, he is\n",
      "liable to a fine of twenty taels of silver to be shared out among the rest.\n",
      "‘In any case, we’re short of stock on those two items. I doubt we’ve got that much\n",
      "in the shop, even if you could pay cash down for it. We’d have to try to raise it for you\n",
      "else?where.\n",
      "‘And for another thing: what do you want it for, anyway? I don’t expect it’s for any\n",
      "serious purpose. Even if I let you have it on credit, I expect it would only get thrown\n",
      "away on some foolishness or other.\n",
      "‘And don’t you go saying that your Uncle’s always on at you when you come to see\n",
      "him! You young people just don’t know what’s good for you. If only you could pull\n",
      "yourself together and earn a bit of money, no one would be happier for you than I\n",
      "should.’\n",
      "Jia Yun smiled:\n",
      "‘What you say is no doubt perfectly true, Uncle. But when Father died I was too\n",
      "little to understand what was going on, and according to what Mother has since told\n",
      "me, it was you who stepped in and took care of everything. Now you know as well as\n",
      "I do that it wasn’t I who spent all the money that came from selling off our little bit of\n",
      "property, and I don’t see what I am supposed to do without any capital. Even the\n",
      "cleverest housewife can’t make bread without flour! You’re lucky you’ve only got me\n",
      "to contend with. Anyone else in my position would be pestering the life out of you.\n",
      "They’d be round here scrounging all the time: a pound of rice one day, a quart of\n",
      "beans the next. Then you would have something to grumble about!’\n",
      "‘My dear boy,’ said Bu Shi-ren, ‘if I had it to give, you should have it and welcome!\n",
      "\f",
      "Your trouble is, though, as I’m always telling your Aunt, you won’t think ahead. If only\n",
      "you’d pull yourself together and go and have a word with your Father’s folk at the big\n",
      "house - or if you can’t get to see them, put your pride in your pocket and make\n",
      "yourself agreeable to some of the stewards there — get yourself a job of some kind!\n",
      "When I was on my way out of the city the other day, I ran into that cousin of yours\n",
      "from North Street riding on a donkey with four or five carriages behind him and fifty\n",
      "or sixty nuns on his way to your family temple out in the country. Now that’s a\n",
      "shrewd young fellow! You can’t tell me he got that job by doing nothing!’\n",
      "Exasperated by his uncle’s nagging, Jia Yun got up to go. ‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bu\n",
      "Shi-ren. ‘You can have something to eat before you go -’\n",
      "‘Are you crazy?’ his wife’s voice cut in from the kitchen. ‘I told you we haven’t got\n",
      "any rice in the house. I’ve just bought this half a pound of noodles that I’m cooking\n",
      "for you now. I don’t know what you’re acting so lordly about, asking people to dinner.\n",
      "The boy’ll only go hungry if he stays!’\n",
      "‘Buy another half a pound, woman, and put it in with the rest!’ said Bu Shi-ren.\n",
      "‘Goldie!’ Mrs Bu shouted to her daughter. ‘Go over to Mrs Wang’s house across the\n",
      "road and ask if she can lend us a few cash. Tell her we can pay her back tomorrow!’\n",
      "But before she had finished, Jia Yun, with a muttered ‘Don’t bother!’ had slipped\n",
      "quietly away.\n",
      "Angrily leaving his uncle’s house behind him, he was on his way back home, eyes\n",
      "fixed on the ground as he brooded miserably on his affairs, when he walked head-on\n",
      "into drunkard. The man seized hold of him with a curse:\n",
      "‘You sodding blind, bumping into me like that?’\n",
      "The voice was a familiar one. Looking closer he saw that it was his neighbour Ni Er, a\n",
      "racketeer who made most of his money from high-interest loans supplemented by\n",
      "what he took off other players in the gambling dens. He drank too much and was\n",
      "always getting into fights. At this particular moment he was on his way back from\n",
      "paying a little ‘call’ on one of his debtors — evidently a lucrative one, for he was\n",
      "already half-seas-over. He did not take kindly to being bumped into, and it would\n",
      "have gone badly with Jia Yun if he had not immediately identified himself:\n",
      "‘Ni, old chap, don’t strike! It’s me! I wasn’t looking where I was going.’\n",
      "Hearing the voice, Ni Er opened his bleary eyes a little wider, saw that it was Jia Yun,\n",
      "released him - lurching heavily as he did so — and gave a crapulous laugh:\n",
      "‘Oh,’ he said, ‘young Mist’ Jia. Parm me. Wherra you jus’ come from?’\n",
      "‘Don’t ask me!’ said Jia Yun bitterly. ‘I’ve just been given the bird!’\n",
      "‘Nemmind!’ said Ni Er. ‘Anyone been bothering you, Mist’ Jia, jus’ tell me and I’ll\n",
      "settle accounts with him for you! You know me. Ni Er. The Drunken Diamond. Old\n",
      "Dime’ll look after you. Anyone this part of the town troubling neighbour of Dime’s,\n",
      "\f",
      "don’t care who he is, guarantee put him out of business.’\n",
      "‘Look, Diamond, if you’ll promise not to get angry, I’ll tell you what happened,’ said\n",
      "Jia Yun, and proceeded to give him an account of his interview with Bu Shi-ren. Ni Er\n",
      "was hugely incensed:\n",
      "‘Damn fella! Give the damn fella piece of my mind if he wasn’t a relation of yours.\n",
      "Make my blood boil. Damn fella! Nemmind. Dome be downhearted. Got a few taels\n",
      "of silver here. If you can use it, help yourself! Good neighbour of Dime’s. Here y’are.\n",
      "Interest-free loan.’\n",
      "‘This man’s a racketeer,’ Jia Yun thought to himself, ‘but he’s been known to do a\n",
      "good turn before now — in fact, he’s got quite a reputation in some quarters as a\n",
      "champion of the poor. If I don’t accept his offer, he may turn nasty and I shall be in\n",
      "trouble. Better accept the money and pay back double the amount when I can.’\n",
      "Having made the decision, he thanked Ni Er with a smile:\n",
      "‘You’re a real sport, Diamond! Since you’ve been kind enough to make the offer\n",
      "then, I won’t refuse. I’ll make you out a proper IOU for it when I get home.’\n",
      "Ni Er roared with laughter:\n",
      "‘There’s only fifteen taels and six pennyweights of silver here. If you’re going to go\n",
      "writing IOUs, I won’t lend it to you!’\n",
      "Jia Yun laughed too and took the money from him:\n",
      "‘All right, Diamond, anything you say! Let’s not fall out about it!’\n",
      "‘That’s more like it!’ said Ni Er. ‘Getting dark now. Won’t keep you for a drink. Still\n",
      "got a little business to do. You go on home. Like you to give a message to my old\n",
      "woman, be so kind. Not going home tonight. If there’s anything to tell me about, she\n",
      "can send my daughter round first thing tomorrow. Find me at Bandy Wang, the\n",
      "horse-dealer’s.’\n",
      "With these words he went on his way, lurching horribly.\n",
      "The encounter left Jia Yun somewhat bemused.\n",
      "‘That Ni Er’s certainly a character!’ he thought. ‘The trouble is, it may only have\n",
      "been the drink that made him generous. Perhaps when he’s sobered up tomorrow\n",
      "he’ll want his money back with a hundred per cent interest. What am I going to do\n",
      "then?’\n",
      "Then he suddenly remembered what the money would enable him to do:\n",
      "‘Of course! It doesn’t matter! If I get the job, I can pay back the loan and a hundred\n",
      "per cent interest easily.’\n",
      "With that thought uppermost in his mind he went into a money-changer’s to have\n",
      "the silver weighed. To his great delight it turned out to be exactly the amount Ni Er\n",
      "had said, not a pennyweight less. Then he went home, calling at Ni Er’s house on the\n",
      "way to give the message to his wife. En?tering his own house he found his mother on\n",
      "\f",
      "the kang spin?ning. She looked up as he entered:\n",
      "‘Where have you been all day?’\n",
      "He did not like to mention that he had been to see her brother in case she was angry.\n",
      "He only said:\n",
      "‘Been at Rong-guo House waiting for Uncle Lian. Have you had supper yet?’\n",
      "‘Yes, I’ve had mine. I put something aside for you.’\n",
      "She called to their little slavey to fetch it for him. Except for her work-lamp it was\n",
      "already dark indoors, so after finishing his supper he got himself ready for the night,\n",
      "unrolled his bedding, and settled down to sleep.\n",
      "Rising early next morning, he went off as soon as he had washed to the shops in\n",
      "Central Street outside the south gate of the Inner City and bought camphor and musk\n",
      "at a perfu?mer’s. From there he went to Rong-guo House, and having first\n",
      "ascertained at the gate that Jia Lian was out for the day, he made his way to the\n",
      "Lians’ apartment at the back. Outside the gateway leading to their courtyard a\n",
      "number of page boys were sweeping the ground with long-handled brooms.\n",
      "Sud?denly Zhou Rui’s wife came out and addressed them:\n",
      "‘Stop sweeping now! The Mistress is coming.’\n",
      "Jia Yun hurried up to her with a smile of greeting:\n",
      "‘Where is Aunt Lian off to, then?’\n",
      "‘Her Old Ladyship wants her,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I think it’s to see about some\n",
      "tailoring.’\n",
      "As she spoke, the subject of his inquiry emerged from the gateway, surrounded by a\n",
      "bevy of attendants. Jia Yun was well aware that she had a weakness for flattery and\n",
      "the showier forms of deference. Bringing his hands together in an exag?gerated\n",
      "salute and stepping briskly forward, he made her a tremendous bow and wished her\n",
      "in good health.\n",
      "Xi-feng continued to walk on and, without actually looking at him or turning her head,\n",
      "inquired after his mother’s health and asked why she never came to visit.\n",
      "‘She’s not been very well, Auntie. She’s always thinking about you and meaning to\n",
      "pay a call, but when it’s come to it, she just hasn’t been able to get out.’\n",
      "‘You’re a wonderful liar!’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. ‘I don’t suppose she’s ever\n",
      "thought about me until this moment!’\n",
      "‘I’m too much afraid of lightning to lie to my superiors,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Mother was\n",
      "talking about you only last night, as a matter of fact. She said, “Your Auntie Lian is\n",
      "only a single weak woman, yet she has all those responsibilities. It’s a good thing she\n",
      "has the will-power to keep everything running so smoothly, because if that should go,\n",
      "she’d be worn out in no tine.”‘\n",
      "Xi-feng was now all smiles, and halted in spite of herself to hear more.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘And why should you and your mother be chewing over my affairs behind my back,\n",
      "pray?’\n",
      "‘That’s a long story,’ said Jia Yun. ‘A very good friend of mine who runs a perfumery\n",
      "and had quite a bit put by in savings decided to invest his money in a government\n",
      "post and bought himself the place of an Assistant Sub-Prefect. Well, a few days ago\n",
      "his posting came and it turns out to be for somewhere down in Yunnan. He’s taking\n",
      "his family with him, so of course he won’t be able to keep on the shop, and he’s been\n",
      "going over all his stock deciding what to give away and what to put in his clearance\n",
      "sale. He decided to give the more valuable stuff to friends and relations. My share\n",
      "was a whole quarter of a pound of Borneo camphor and another quarter of musk,\n",
      "and I was discussing with Mother last night what we ought to do with it. We don’t\n",
      "know anyone who could afford to buy it; and it seems a shame to sell it at less than\n",
      "the price; and even if we gave it away, we couldn’t think of anyone who would want\n",
      "so much. But then I suddenly thought of you and the packets of money you’ve spent\n",
      "on this kind of thing in years past, and I thought to myself that this year, what with\n",
      "Her Grace in the Palace and the Double Fifth already not far off, you’re sure to be\n",
      "using ten or twelve times the usual amount. So, to cut a long story short, we decided\n",
      "to make a present of it to you. There you are, Auntie - a little token of my esteem!’\n",
      "As he spoke, he took out a small brocade-covered box and respectfully raised it in\n",
      "both hands to offer her.\n",
      "Now Xi-feng was just beginning to think about the problem of purchasing aromatics\n",
      "for the Double Fifth festival, and it pleased her very much to be relieved of the\n",
      "trouble of doing so — especially when it was in so agreeable a manner. She smiled at\n",
      "him graciously before turning to her maid:\n",
      "‘Felicity, take my nephew’s present and give it to Patience to take care of!’\n",
      "The smile was directed once more on Jia Yun:\n",
      "‘You are very thoughtful. I’m not surprised your Uncle speaks so highly of you. He’s\n",
      "often told me what a well-spoken, sensible young man you are.’\n",
      "They seemed to be sailing into harbour. Jia Yun took a step closer:\n",
      "‘Has Uncle been talking to you about me then?’ — The tone in which he asked the\n",
      "question was deliberately meaningful.\n",
      "Xi-feng was on the point of telling him that he would get the tree-planting job when\n",
      "she reflected that by doing so she would be cheapening herself in his estimation. He\n",
      "would almost certainly suppose that she was promising it in return for the perfume.\n",
      "In replying to his question she therefore confined herself to a few insipid civilities,\n",
      "avoiding all mention of jobs and trees, and presently continued on her way to\n",
      "Grandmother Jia’s.\n",
      "Obviously Jia Yun was in no position to raise the subject if his aunt was not willing, so\n",
      "\f",
      "he was obliged to return in the same uncertainty in which he had come. Back home\n",
      "he remembered Bao-yu’s invitation of the previous day, and as soon as he had\n",
      "finished his meal, he returned once more to Rong-guo House and made his way to\n",
      "Sunset Studio outside the gateway leading to Lady Jia’s quarters. He found the pages\n",
      "Tealeaf and Ploughboy sitting over a game of chess and arguing about a piece that\n",
      "one of them had just taken. Other pages — Trickles, Sweeper, Cloudy and Storky —\n",
      "were up on the roof looking for fledgelings. Jia Yun entered the court?yard and\n",
      "stamped his foot:\n",
      "‘Come on, you young rapscallions! Can’t you see you’ve got a visitor?’\n",
      "The pages, except Tealeaf, melted away. Jia Yun went into the study and sat down in a\n",
      "chair.\n",
      "‘Has Master Bao been here yet?’\n",
      "‘He hasn’t been here yet today,’ said Tealeaf. ‘If you want to talk to him, I’ll have a\n",
      "look and see if he’s about.’\n",
      "With that he, too, vanished.\n",
      "For about the time it would take to eat a meal, Jia Yun gazed at the paintings,\n",
      "calligraphic scrolls and antiques which adorned the room. At the end of that time, as\n",
      "there was still no sign of Tealeaf, he took a look outside to see if there were any other\n",
      "pages whom he could ask to take a message; but they had all gone off to play\n",
      "elsewhere. Dejectedly he went back once more to wait.\n",
      "‘Tealeaf!’\n",
      "A soft and thrilling voice was calling from outside. Craning out to look he saw a\n",
      "fifteen-or sixteen-year-old maid standing near the entrance to the study. She was a\n",
      "neat, pleasant-looking girl with a pair of limpid, intelligent eyes. Seeing a strange man\n",
      "in the room, she quickly shrank back out of his line of vision. At that very moment\n",
      "Tealeaf walked back into the courtyard.\n",
      "‘Ah, good!’ he said, catching sight of the maid. ‘I was beginning to wonder how I’d\n",
      "ever get a message to him.’\n",
      "Jia Yun ran out to question him:\n",
      "‘Well?’\n",
      "‘Waited for ages,’ said Tealeaf, ‘but no one came by. She’s from his room, though.’ -\n",
      "he indicated the soft-voiced maid – ‘Listen, dear,’ he said addressing her. ‘Can you\n",
      "take a message for us? Tell him that Mr Jia from West Lane is here.’\n",
      "On learning that the visitor was a member of the clan, the maid became less\n",
      "concerned about concealment and engaged the limpid eyes in bolder scrutiny of his\n",
      "features. The object of her scrutiny now addressed her:\n",
      "‘Don’t bother about the “West Lane” stuff! Just say that “Yun” has called!’\n",
      "The girl reflected for some moments, then, with a half-smile, she said:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘If I were you, Mr Jia, I’d go home now and come again tomorrow. I’ll try to get a\n",
      "message through to him this evening if I get the chance.’\n",
      "‘What’s the idea?’ said Tealeaf.\n",
      "‘He didn’t have his nap today,’ said the maid. ‘That means he’ll be having dinner\n",
      "early. Then suppose he doesn’t go out after dinner: are you going to let Mr Jia wait\n",
      "here all day without eating? It would be much better if he went home now and came\n",
      "again tomorrow. Even if I succeed in getting word through to him as soon as I get\n",
      "back, he’ll probably only send an answer to the message. I don’t expect he’ll actually\n",
      "come over.’\n",
      "Her words were sensible and to the point and were spoken in the same thrilling tone\n",
      "that had first attracted him. Jia Yun would have liked to ask her name, but etiquette\n",
      "forbade that he should do so now that he knew she was one of Bao-yu’s maids. He\n",
      "just said:\n",
      "‘I’m sure you’re right. I’ll come again tomorrow, then.’\n",
      "He turned to go.\n",
      "‘I’ll get some tea for you, Mr Jia,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Have a cup of tea before you go.’\n",
      "‘No thanks,’ said Jia Yun, looking back over his shoulder but continuing to go. ‘I’ve\n",
      "got other business.’\n",
      "The words were for Tealeaf, but the look which accom?panied them was directed at\n",
      "the soft-voiced maid, who was still standing there.\n",
      "Jia Yun went back home and returned next day as she had advised. On his way in he\n",
      "ran into Xi-feng outside the main gate. She was about to visit Jia Lian’s parents next\n",
      "door and had just got into her carriage. Seeing Jia Yun, she made her attendants call\n",
      "to him to stop.\n",
      "‘Yun!’ She smiled at him through the window of the carriage. ‘You’ve got a nerve,\n",
      "my lad, playing a trick like that on me! I see now why you gave me that present. It’s a\n",
      "job you were after. Your Uncle told me yesterday. Apparently you’ve been on to him\n",
      "about it already.’\n",
      "Jia Yun smiled back ruefully:\n",
      "‘I’d rather we didn’t go into my dealings with Uncle, if you don’t mind! I’m\n",
      "beginning to wish I’d never spoken to him about it. If I’d realized earlier what the\n",
      "situation was, I should have gone straight to you in the first place. I’m sure if I had, it\n",
      "would all have been settled long ago. I’m afraid Uncle has let me down.’\n",
      "‘Humph!’ said Xi-feng. ‘So that’s why you came to me yesterday, is it? You’d had no\n",
      "success with the husband so you thought you’d try your luck with the wife!’\n",
      "‘That’s most unfair, Auntie!’ Jia Yun protested. ‘It was a purely disinterested present.\n",
      "I wasn’t thinking at all about a job when I gave it to you. If I had been, why do you\n",
      "suppose I didn’t take the opportunity of asking you about it at the time? However,\n",
      "\f",
      "since you do now know that I’m looking for one, I’d like to forget about Uncle and\n",
      "throw myself on your kindness instead.’\n",
      "‘You have a very devious way of going about things,’ said Xi-feng with a hint of\n",
      "malice in her smile. ‘Why couldn’t you have spoken up sooner? A little thing like this\n",
      "is hardly worth so much delay. We still need some more trees and shrubs planted in\n",
      "the garden, and I’ve been trying to think of someone to do the job. If you’d spoken\n",
      "up earlier, it could all have been done by now.’\n",
      "‘You can set me to work tomorrow, Auntie. I’ll be ready.’\n",
      "Xi-feng thought for a while.\n",
      "‘I don’t know that it’s a very suitable job for you. Perhaps we’d better wait until\n",
      "next New Year and put you in charge of lanterns and fireworks. That’s a much bigger\n",
      "job.’\n",
      "‘Look, Auntie: you give me this planting job now, then; if you’re satisfied with the\n",
      "way I do it, you can give me the other job later on.’\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed:\n",
      "‘You certainly know how to fish with a long line! — All right, then! It’s not really my\n",
      "affair, but I suppose as your Uncle has mentioned it to me — I’m only going next door\n",
      "now and I shall be back again after lunch. Come round a little after midday to get the\n",
      "money and you shall start your planting the day after tomorrow.’\n",
      "She told the servants to harness the carriage and drove off to make her call.\n",
      "Beside himself with joy, Jia Yun now continued on his way to Sunset Studio to look for\n",
      "Bao-yu. In point of fact Bao-yu had gone off first thing that morning to call on the\n",
      "Prince of Bei-jing; but no one seemed to know about this, and Jia Yun sat waiting\n",
      "expectantly throughout the whole of the morning. Having waited until noon, he\n",
      "inquired whether Xi-feng was back yet, and being informed that she was, he wrote\n",
      "out a form of receipt, took it round to the Lians’ apartment, and sent in word that he\n",
      "had called for his tally. Sunshine came out in response to his message and asked him\n",
      "for the receipt, which he took indoors. Presently he reappeared and handed it back\n",
      "to Jia Yun with the date and amount filled in in the blanks he had left for this purpose,\n",
      "together with the precious tally which would enable him to draw the money.\n",
      "Glancing at the receipt as he took it from him, Jia Yun was delighted to observe that\n",
      "the figures entered were for a payment of two hundred taels of silver. He hurried off\n",
      "to the counting-house to collect it, then home once more to share the joyful news\n",
      "with his mother.\n",
      "Next day he was off long before daylight to look up Ni Er and pay him back the loan.\n",
      "That done, he took another fifty taels of the silver with him and called on a\n",
      "nurseryman outside the West Gate called Fang Chun, from whom he bought a large\n",
      "number of trees.\n",
      "\f",
      "At this point our narrative abandons Jia Yun’s affairs and returns to Bao-yu.\n",
      "When Bao-yu, in the course of his meeting with Jia Yun, had invited Jia Yun to drop in\n",
      "and spend the following day with him, the invitation was of the careless, half-serious\n",
      "kind that is unfortunately typical of young gentlemen of his class. As he had made no\n",
      "real effort to remember it at the time, it naturally slipped his memory the following\n",
      "day. Returning now, two evenings later, from the palace of the Prince of Bei-jing\n",
      "where he had been all day, he called first on his grandmother and his mother and\n",
      "then returned to his own rooms in the garden and changed back into his everyday\n",
      "clothes.\n",
      "He decided to take a bath; and since Aroma was out, having been ‘borrowed’ by\n",
      "Bao-chai to make braid buttons on a dress, Ripple and Emerald had gone off to see\n",
      "about the water. Of the other senior maids, Skybright had been fetched home for her\n",
      "cousin’s birthday and Musk was away ill; and the few heavy-work maids left in\n",
      "attendance had all assumed that their services would not be required and had gone\n",
      "off in search of their gossips. For a quarter of an hour Bao-yu was left entirely on his\n",
      "own. It chanced that precisely at this mo?ment he wanted someone to get him some\n",
      "tea. He had already called a couple of times without response and at his third call\n",
      "two or three old charwomen came hurrying in to see what was the matter.\n",
      "‘No, no: I don’t need you!’ - he waved them away im?patiently. The old women\n",
      "retired, baffled.\n",
      "Since there were no maids, Bao-yu saw that he would have to serve himself. He\n",
      "found himself a cup and was about to take up the pot to pour himself some tea when\n",
      "a voice started speaking right behind him:\n",
      "‘Let me, Master Bao! You might scald yourself.’\n",
      "Bao-yu jumped. The owner of the voice hurriedly relieved him of the cup.\n",
      "‘Where have you been all this time?’ he said. ‘You gave me quite a start, coming up\n",
      "suddenly like that!’\n",
      "She handed him his tea with a smile:\n",
      "‘I was in the back courtyard. I came in through the courtyard door at the back.\n",
      "Didn’t you hear me coming?’\n",
      "Bao-yu sipped his tea and observed her carefully. Her dress, though not shabby, was\n",
      "far from new. By contrast she had a magnificent head of raven-black hair which was\n",
      "done up in a simple bun. The face was rather long and thin; the build slender; the\n",
      "overall impression that of a tidy, clean, graceful person.\n",
      "‘Do you belong here then?’ he asked her.\n",
      "‘Yes.’ She seemed amused.\n",
      "‘If you do, how is it that I’ve never seen you before?’\n",
      "She replied with some bitterness:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There are quite a few of us you’ve never seen. I’m not the only one, by any means.\n",
      "How could you have seen me? I’ve never been allowed to wait on you or show myself\n",
      "in your presence.’\n",
      "‘Why not?’\n",
      "‘I don’t think it’s for me to say. — Oh, there’s something I do have to tell you,\n",
      "though. Yesterday a gentleman calling himself “Yun” came to see you. I thought you\n",
      "probably wouldn’t be able to see him at the time, so I told Tealeaf to ask him round\n",
      "this morning. Unfortunately by the time he came, you’d already gone off to see the\n",
      "Prince—’\n",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by the giggles of Ripple and Emerald who had just\n",
      "entered the courtyard with a large bucket of water. Each of them held the bucket by\n",
      "one hand and lifted her skirts up with the other. They were staggering under the\n",
      "unaccustomed weight and slopping a good deal of the water about as they went. The\n",
      "maid hurried out to relieve them. By now the giggles had given way to\n",
      "recriminations:\n",
      "‘Look, you’ve soaked my dress!’\n",
      "‘You trod on my toe!’\n",
      "They stopped to look at this person who had just issued from the young Master’s\n",
      "room and saw with some surprise that it was Crimson. Putting down the water, they\n",
      "hurried indoors to look. Bao-yu was there on his own. The girls were indignant. As\n",
      "soon as they had prepared the bath and seen him undressed, they shut the door\n",
      "after them and hurried to the other side of the building to find Crimson.\n",
      "‘What were you doing in his room just now?’ they asked her accusingly.\n",
      "‘I wasn’t doing anything,’ said Crimson. ‘I couldn’t find my handkerchief, so I went\n",
      "to look for it round the back. He was calling for some tea and none of you happened\n",
      "to be about, so I ran in and poured it out for him. And just at that moment you came\n",
      "back.’\n",
      "Ripple spat in her face:\n",
      "‘Nasty, shameless little slut! When we asked you to fetch the water for us you said\n",
      "you were busy and made us go ourselves. You didn’t waste much time, having got\n",
      "him to yourself, did you? You think you’re on the way up, don’t you? Step by step.\n",
      "Well, we can catch up with you, my fine lady! Why don’t you take a look at yourself in\n",
      "the mirror and then ask yourself if you’re a fit person to go serving tea to the\n",
      "Masters?’\n",
      "‘We’d better warn the others that when he asks for tea or anything in future they\n",
      "must stay where they are and let her go and get it!’\n",
      "‘In that case,’ said Ripple, ‘the rest of us may as well clear off and let her have him\n",
      "all to herself!’\n",
      "\f",
      "They were still at their antiphonal taunting when an old woman arrived with a\n",
      "message from Xi-feng:\n",
      "‘Someone is bringing some workmen in tomorrow to plant trees, so you have all\n",
      "got to be extra careful. No hanging clothes out to dry all over the place! There will be\n",
      "screens put up along the line of the embankment and you are not to go running\n",
      "around outside.’\n",
      "‘Who’s the person in charge of the workmen?’ asked Ripple.\n",
      "‘A young chap called “Yun” from up the Lane,’ said the old woman.\n",
      "The name meant nothing to Ripple and Emerald, who went on to ask about other\n",
      "matters; but Crimson knew it must be the young man she had met the day before in\n",
      "the outer study.\n",
      "Crimson’s surname was ‘Lin’. Her family had been retainers in the Jia family for\n",
      "generations. Nowadays her father worked as a farm-bailiff on the family’s estates.\n",
      "She was sixteen. Along with many other servants, she had originally entered the\n",
      "Prospect Garden to carry out caretaking duties in the period when it was still\n",
      "unoccupied. The part of it she was assigned to was the House of Green Delights. She\n",
      "found it a very beautiful place to live in — very quiet and secluded. But this had\n",
      "changed when Bao-yu and the girls were commanded to move in and Bao-yu had\n",
      "chosen the House of Green Delights as his own residence.\n",
      "Although Crimson was a very inexperienced maid, she had a measure of good looks\n",
      "and a determination to better herself. She was therefore constantly on the look-out\n",
      "for an opportunity of making herself known to Bao-yu and showing off her ability to\n",
      "serve him. Unfortunately the little group of body-servants who had accompanied him\n",
      "into the garden guarded their privileges with tooth and claw and were careful to\n",
      "allow no toehold to an ambitious outsider. Today she had at last found an opening,\n",
      "only to have her hopes immediately dashed by Ripple’s malice. She felt very\n",
      "discouraged.\n",
      "Still smarting with resentment, she heard the old woman say that Jia Yun was coming\n",
      "next day into the garden. The name provoked a momentary flutter in her breast; but\n",
      "she returned to her room with the same feeling of resentment bottled up inside her\n",
      "and went to bed to ponder moodily on the events of the day. As the thoughts\n",
      "pursued themselves round and round in her mind without object or conclusion, she\n",
      "suddenly heard her name being called very softly outside her window:\n",
      "‘Crimson! Crim! I’ve found your handkerchief!’ She quickly got up and went outside\n",
      "to look. To her sur?prise it was Jia Yun. A maidenly confusion mantled her comely\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "‘Where did you find it?’ she asked timidly.\n",
      "Jia Yun laughed:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Come over here and I’ll show you!’\n",
      "He took hold of her dress to pull her to him. Overcome with shame, she turned and\n",
      "fled, but her foot caught on the thresh?old and she fell on her face.\n",

      "she woke in bed and discovered that she had been dreaming. She did not get to sleep\n",
      "again after that, but lay tossing restlessly throughout the night.\n",
      "When daylight came at last, she got up, and shortly after was joined by the other\n",

      "because he did not know what she was really like and dreaded the unpleasantness of\n",
      "sending her away again if she proved unsatisfactory. The question still preoccupied\n",
      "him when he woke that morning. He rose quite early and sat musing silently on his\n",

      "In a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see\n",
      "clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside. He could\n",
      "see several girls there sweeping, all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and\n",
      "ornaments in their hair, but no sign of the quiet, neat girl of the day before. He went\n",
      "\f",
      "outside in his slippers to look around, pretending that he had gone out to inspect the\n",
      "flowers. He could see someone leaning on the balustrade in the south-west corner of\n",
      "the cloister-like covered walk, but she was half hidden by the crab-apple tree and he\n",
      "could not make out who it was. He approached and looked more closely. It was she,\n",
      "yesterday’s girl, standing there on her own, apparently lost in thought. He was a little\n",

      "Haze Bridge, she stopped a moment to look around. She noticed that cloth screens\n",
      "had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill, and remembered that this was\n",

      "‘You’ve been drinking again, child,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Your face is burning. All this\n",
      "romping about will make you sick. Lie down quietly for a while over there!’\n",
      "She made them bring him a head-rest, and he lay down behind her, towards the back\n",
      "of the kang. Sunset was in?structed to massage him by gently patting his legs.\n",
      "He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him, but she barely acknowledged his\n",
      "questions and answered frigidly, directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia\n",
      "Huan. Bao-yu seized her hand:\n",
      "‘Come, my dear! You must take notice of me if I speak to you!’\n",
      "He tugged at her hand as he spoke, but she snatched it from his grasp.\n",
      "‘If you do that again,’ she said, ‘I shall call out!’\n",
      "Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange. He had always hated Bao-yu, and this\n",
      "flirting with Sunset — his Sunset — was the last straw. He must be revenged or burst.\n",
      "A moment’s reflection suggested the means. He had only to feign a slight clumsiness\n",
      "of the hand and it was done. The candle, brimming with molten wax, toppled straight\n",
      "on to Bao-yu’s face. There was a piercing cry, which made everyone else in the room\n",
      "jump. Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below. By their light\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu’s face was seen to be covered all over in wax. Torn between anguish for him\n",
      "and anger with Jia Huan, Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as\n",
      "possible, while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness. Xi-feng\n",
      "scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants, grumbling at Jia Huan as she did\n",
      "so:\n",
      "‘Huan, you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met! You are simply not\n",
      "fit for decent company. I don’t know why Aunt Zhao hasn’t taught you better.’\n",
      "Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the\n",
      "servants. She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and, summoning Aunt Zhao, directed\n",
      "all her wrath upon that luckless concubine:\n",
      "‘This is a fine son you bore us, I must say! He is a black-?hearted little monster! You\n",
      "might at least try to teach him better. But no. Time and again I have overlooked this\n",
      "sort of thing, but instead of feeling sorry, you glory in it. You think that when I do\n",
      "nothing, you have got the better of me.’\n",
      "Aunt Zhao was obliged to swallow her anger and endure these taunts in silence. She\n",
      "climbed up onto the kang and made a show of helping the others with the injured\n",
      "boy. She looked at his face. The whole left side of it was badly blistered. It was a\n",
      "wonder that the eye had not been damaged. When Lady Wang saw it, she was both\n",
      "full of anguish for her son and at the same time, when she thought of the\n",
      "questioning to which she would inevitably be subjected by Grandmother Jia and\n",
      "wondered what she would say, terrified on her own account. To relieve her fear she\n",
      "turned once more on Aunt Zhao. Then, after tongue-lashing the concubine, she\n",
      "comforted her beloved son and applied Antiphlogistic Ointment to the blistered part\n",
      "of his face.\n",
      "‘It does hurt a bit,’ said Bao-yu when she asked him, ‘but nothing very terrible.\n",
      "When Grandma asks about it, we had better tell her that I did it.’\n",
      "‘She’ll blame the rest of us for not looking after you properly, even if you say you\n",
      "did it yourself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There’ll be a row, whatever you say.’\n",
      "Lady Wang told them to see him back to his room. It was a great shock to Aroma and\n",
      "the other maids when they saw him.\n",
      "Dai-yu had had a dull time of it with Bao-yu away all day, and in the course of the\n",
      "evening sent several times round to his room to inquire whether he was back yet. It\n",
      "was in this way that she heard about his scalding. She hurried round immediately to\n",
      "see for herself how he was.\n",
      "She found him with a mirror in his hand, examining the extent of the damage. The\n",
      "entire left side of his face was thickly plastered with ointment, from which she\n",
      "deduced that the injury must be a serious one. But when she approached him to look\n",
      "closer, he averted his head and waved her away. He knew how squeamish she was,\n",
      "\f",
      "and feared that the sight of it would upset her. Dai-yu for her part was sufficiently\n",
      "aware of her own weakness not to insist on looking. She merely asked him ‘whether\n",
      "it hurt very badly’.\n",
      "‘Not so bad as all that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘A couple of days and it will probably be all\n",
      "right again.’\n",
      "Dai-yu sat with him a little longer and then went back to her room.\n",
      "Next day Bao-yu had to see Grandmother Jia. Although he told her that he had\n",
      "burned himself through his own carelessness, the old lady, as had been predicted,\n",
      "berated his attendants for having allowed the accident to happen.\n",
      "Another day went by, and Bao-yu’s godmother, old Mother Ma, called round. Mother\n",
      "Ma was a Wise Woman. Her special relationship with Bao-yu had been arranged in\n",
      "his infancy to ensure him the protection of her powers. She was shocked by her\n",
      "godson’s appearance and, on being informed of the cause, shook her head and\n",
      "tutted sympathetically. She made a few signs over his face with her fingers, muttering\n",
      "some gibberish as she did so, after which she assured them that he would soon be\n",
      "better the malignant aura that had caused the accident was of a transitory,\n",
      "impermanent nature. She turned to Grand?mother Jia:\n",
      "‘Bless you, my lucky lady! Bless you dearie! You don’t know a half of the unseen\n",
      "harms and dangers the Scripture tells us of. All the sons of princes and great folks the\n",
      "moment they begin to grow up are followed round everywhere they go by troops of\n",
      "invisible little imps—spiteful little creatures who nip them and pinch them whenever\n",
      "they can. Sometimes they knock the rice bowl from their hands when they’re eating.\n",
      "Sometimes they push them over when they are walking. It’s on account of these\n",
      "creatures that so many young gentlemen of good family don’t live to make old\n",
      "bones.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia was anxious to know if the afflicted person could be freed from\n",
      "these unwelcome attentions.\n",
      "‘Easily,’ said Mother Ma. ‘By doing good works. Giving a bit more to charity on the\n",
      "young person’s behalf. There is another way, though. According to what the Scripture\n",
      "says, there’s a Bodhisattva of Universal Light living in the Para?dise of the West who\n",
      "spends his time lighting up the dark places where these evil spirits lurk, and if any\n",
      "believer, male or female, will make offerings to that Bodhisattva in a proper spirit of\n",
      "devoutness, he will grant their children and grandchildren his holy peace and protect\n",
      "them from possession by devils and from the powers of darkness.’\n",
      "‘What sort of offerings do you make to this Bodhisattva?’ Grandmother Jia asked\n",
      "her.\n",
      "‘Nothing very special. Apart from the usual incense offerings, we take a few pounds\n",
      "of sesame oil each day and make what we call a “sea of light” by burning wicks in it.\n",
      "\f",
      "We believe that this sea of light is the trans-substantial body of the Bodhisattva. It\n",
      "has to be kept burning night and day and never allowed to go out.’\n",
      "‘How much oil does it take to keep it burning for one whole day and night?’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia. ‘I should like to do this for the boy.’\n",
      "‘There’s no fixed amount,’ said Mother Ma. ‘We leave it to our clients to decide\n",
      "how much they want to give. There are several members of the aristocracy among\n",
      "those I do this service for. Let’s see … There’s the Prince of An-nan’s lady. She’s my\n",
      "biggest subscriber. Her subscription is for forty-eight pounds of oil and a pound of\n",
      "lampwicks a day. Her sea of light is pretty nearly as big as a cistern. Then there’s the\n",
      "Marquis of Jin-xiang’s lady: twenty pounds of oil a day. Oh, and there’s some pays for\n",
      "ten pounds a day, some for eight pounds, three pounds, five pounds - all sorts. All of\n",
      "them I keep their seas of light burning for them, back at my house.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia nodded thoughtfully.\n",
      "‘One thing I should mention,’ said Mother Ma (observing the thoughtfulness): ‘if\n",
      "the offering is for an older person — a mother or father, say — it doesn’t matter how\n",
      "much you subscribe; but if it’s an older person making it for a younger one, like as it\n",
      "may be Your Ladyship for Bao-yu, you don’t want to subscribe too much, or it would\n",
      "overload his luck and have the opposite effect. In the case of Your Ladyship\n",
      "subscribing for Bao-yu, I should suggest between five and seven pounds a day.’\n",
      "‘Make it five pounds a day, then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We’ll work out the total\n",
      "and send you a month’s supply every month.’\n",
      "‘Amitabha, Merciful Buddha! Bless His Holy Name!’ said Mother Ma.\n",
      "As a further precaution Grandmother Jia called in some of Bao-yu’s maids and told\n",
      "them that in future whenever Bao-yu went out anywhere his pages were to be\n",
      "provided with several strings of cash to give as alms to any itinerant monks or priests\n",
      "or any poor or afflicted persons they might meet upon the way.\n",
      "After seeing Grandmother Jia, Mother Ma drifted round the mansion calling at\n",
      "various other apartments. Presently she came to Aunt Zhao’s room. After they had\n",
      "exchanged greetings, Aunt Zhao told her little servant to pour the old woman a cup\n",
      "of tea. Aunt Zhao was pasting pieces of cloth together for soling shoes with, and\n",
      "Mother Ma observed that the kang around her was piled with miscellaneous\n",
      "remnants of material.\n",
      "‘I’m looking for something to make a pair of uppers out of, dearie,’ said Mother Ma.\n",
      "‘I suppose you haven’t got an old bit of silk or an old bit of satin that would do? It\n",
      "doesn’t matter about the colour.’\n",
      "Aunt Zhao heaved a long-suffering sigh:\n",
      "‘Take a look at this lot! You won’t find anything much worth having here. Nothing\n",
      "worth having in this family ever comes my way. But you’re welcome to pick out a\n",
      "\f",
      "couple of pieces if you don’t mind the poor quality.’\n",
      "Mother Ma rummaged around in the heap, and having picked out several pieces,\n",
      "stuffed them into her sleeve.\n",
      "‘I sent someone round to you the other day with five hundred cash to pay for an\n",
      "offering to the Medicine Bud?dha,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘Have you managed to make it\n",
      "yet?’\n",
      "‘Oh yes. That was done days ago.’\n",
      "‘Holy Name!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’d do it oftener if things were a bit easier; but you\n",
      "know the saying: “my heart is willing but my purse is lean”.’\n",
      "‘Don’t you worry about that!’ said Mother Ma. ‘You only have to hold out a few\n",
      "more years. When your Huan has grown up and got himself a job in the Service,\n",
      "you’ll be able to afford all the good works you want.’\n",
      "Aunt Zhao made a scornful sound in her nose:\n",
      "‘Hfn! Let’s not talk about it! It’ll be no different then from what it is now: Huan and\n",
      "I will never be able to compete with the Other One. It’s like the Heavenly Dragon\n",
      "appearing when he comes on the scene. Mind you, I don’t hold it against the child.\n",
      "He’s a good-looking boy, is Bao-yu, and you can understand the grown-ups being silly\n",
      "about him. No, this is the one I can’t stand.’\n",
      "As she uttered the word ‘this’, she held up two fingers. Mother Ma guessed her\n",
      "meaning: ‘Number Two’ — the youn?ger of the Rong mansion’s two\n",
      "daughters-in-law.\n",
      "‘You mean Mrs Lian?’ she said.\n",
      "Aunt Zhao’s face assumed an expression of terror. Motion?ing agitatedly to the other\n",
      "to remain silent, she got up, went to the door, raised the door-blind, looked around,\n",
      "and having satisfied herself that there were no eavesdroppers, came back and sat\n",
      "down again, her face close to Mother Ma’s.\n",
      "‘She’s a dreadful person — dreadful! If that woman doesn’t end up by carrying off\n",
      "every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with, my name’s\n",
      "not Zhao!’\n",
      "Mother Ma sensed interesting possibilities in this conver?sation, and was quick to\n",
      "explore them:\n",
      "‘It doesn’t need you to tell me that,’ she said. ‘You surely don’t think I haven’t\n",
      "noticed that? I’ve often wondered why you all let her get away with it — though I\n",
      "suppose it’s probably just as well you do.’\n",
      "‘My dear good woman,’ said Aunt Zhao, ‘we’ve no choice but to let her get away\n",
      "with it. Who would ever have the nerve to stand up to her?\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Mother Ma, ‘I don’t want to seem a trouble-maker, but if you don’t\n",
      "mind my saying so, you do all seem to have acted a hit helpless about her — not that\n",
      "\f",
      "I’m blaming you, mind. But I mean to say, even if you daren’t stand up to her openly,\n",
      "there are things you could do in secret. I’m surprised you haven’t thought of it\n",
      "before.’\n",
      "To Aunt Zhao the words seemed to contain a hidden promise. She concealed her\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "‘What do you mean: “things we could do in secret”?’ she said. ‘I’m willing enough\n",
      "to do them: it’s just that I’ve never met anyone who could tell me how. If you would\n",
      "show me the way, I’d pay you. I’d pay a lot.’\n",
      "Mother Ma could see that they understood each other, but she was taking no\n",
      "chances.\n",
      "‘Holy Name! Don’t ask me about things like that! I don’t touch that kind of business.\n",
      "No, no, no. That’s wicked.’\n",
      "There you are!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘That’s all the help I ever get. And I thought you were\n",
      "such a kind person, always helping those in trouble. Are you prepared to stand by\n",
      "and watch me and my Huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman? I\n",
      "suppose it’s because you think I wouldn’t pay you.’\n",
      "‘If you was to say that I am too tender-hearted to stand by and watch you and your\n",
      "boy being wronged,’ said Mother Ma, ‘you would be saying no more nor less than the\n",
      "truth. But I don’t know what you mean about pay. What have you got that you could\n",
      "tempt me with, dearie, even if I was willing to do it for pay?’\n",
      "Aunt Zhao observed that her opposition to the very idea of helping her in the desired\n",
      "way had considerably weakened.\n",
      "‘For someone so clever,’ she said, ‘aren’t you being rather stupid? If you help me\n",
      "and it works, with the two of them safely out of the way, everything in this\n",
      "household will be ours. You’ll be able to ask for what you like. Fancy not thinking of\n",
      "that!’\n",
      "Mother Ma lowered her head and reflected for a while in silence.\n",
      "‘When that time comes and you’re safely landed,’ she said eventually, ‘you won’t\n",
      "want to have anything more to do with me, dearie — not when I’ve got no proof to\n",
      "show what I done for you.’\n",
      "‘That’s no problem,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’ve got a few taels put by of my own savings,\n",
      "and I’ve got some dresses, and there’s my jewellery. You can take some of each to be\n",
      "getting on with and I can give you an IOU promising to pay you so much later on. We\n",
      "can have a witness too, if you like.’\n",
      "‘Are you sure?’\n",
      "‘Why should I tell a lie?’ said Aunt Zhao, and summoned a trusted crone into whose\n",
      "ear she whispered instructions:\n",
      "‘Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps.’\n",
      "\f",
      "The old crone nodded and went out, returning after a few minutes with a promissory\n",
      "note for five hundred taels of silver. Aunt Zhao made her mark on it and then went to\n",
      "the wardrobe to get out her savings. The white shine of silver and the signed and\n",
      "sealed IOU dispelled whatever residual doubts the Wise Woman may have\n",
      "entertained, for she seized and pocketed both with alacrity, giving hearty assurances\n",
      "of her aid as she did so; then, after rummaging for some time in the capacious\n",
      "waistband of her trousers, she fished out twelve little paper cut-out figures — ten of\n",
      "them demons with green faces and red hair and two of them plain human figures —\n",
      "and handed them to Aunt Zhao. Dropping her voice to a whisper, she instructed her\n",
      "to write the eight symbols of her victims’ nativity — two for the year, two for the\n",
      "month, two for the day and two for the hour — on each of the human figures, wrap\n",
      "five of the demons round each of them, and slip them some?where under her\n",
      "victims’ beds.\n",
      "‘That’s all you have to do,’ she said. ‘I shall be doing other things at home to help\n",
      "you. It’s sure to work - no question of that. But you must be very, very careful. And\n",
      "you mustn’t be afraid.’\n",
      "While she was still talking, one of Lady Wang’s maids came in looking for her.\n",

      "One morning after lunch she had settled down to read, but after a couple of chapters\n",
      "grew bored with the book and did some sewing instead with the maids Nightingale\n",
      "and Snowgoose. When that, too, became boring, she stood for a while leaning\n",
      "against the doorway, vacantly looking out. The young bamboo shoots were just\n",
      "breaking through in the forecourt, and after inspecting them, she drifted out into the\n",

      "water splashed and tinkled, but not a human soul was to be seen. Almost without\n",
      "thinking where she was going, she made her way to the House of Green Delights. A\n",

      "smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away.\n",
      "‘Aiyo!’ he said. ‘My head!’\n",
      "‘Good!’ said Dai-yu. ‘It serves you right!’\n",
      "Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, jumped two or three feet into the air, and began\n",
      "to shout and babble deliriously. Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell\n",
      "Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-teng’s lady was with them and hurried\n",
      "over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several\n",
      "times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother\n",
      "were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling.\n",
      "Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried out to him piteously between their sobs:\n",
      "‘my son!’, ‘my child!’, ‘my darling!’\n",
      "Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the\n",
      "household next door and Jia She, Lady Xing, Cousin Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong,\n",
      "Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue and Xue Pan — not to mention Zhou Rui’s wife and a great\n",
      "bevy of domestics both high and low — came hurrying into the garden, adding\n",
      "numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators.\n",
      "While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu, Xi-feng appeared,\n",
      "brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path.\n",
      "She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now, seeing people\n",
      "ahead, glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou\n",
      "Rui’s wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while\n",
      "the others looked on helplessly, clasped her about the arms and body, wrested the\n",
      "knife from her hand, and carried her off to her room. Patience and Felicity wept\n",
      "piteously to see their mistress in such a state.\n",
      "On this occasion even Jia Zheng’s customary impassivity seemed to have deserted\n",
      "him, as he turned this way and that, uncertain on whom to direct his attention. And if\n",
      "\f",
      "Jia Zheng was distraught, the state of the others can be imagined. Most remarkable,\n",
      "perhaps, was the. spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk, one moment\n",
      "afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush, the next that Bao-chai might be\n",
      "ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male. Cousin Zhen, he knew for a fact,\n",
      "was a notorious womanizer. Then he caught sight of Dai-yu (whom he had never seen\n",
      "before) and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty.\n",
      "Although no one knew what to do themselves, there were a great many opinions\n",
      "about what ought to be done. Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the\n",
      "malignant spirits, some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out, some\n",
      "offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master\n",
      "and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff; yet in spite of prayers, incantations,\n",
      "divin?ation, and all the expedients that faith and physic could pro?vide, there was no\n",
      "visible improvement in the condition of the patients. At sundown Wang Zi-teng’s lady\n",
      "took her leave and went home.\n",
      "Next day she made another visit to inquire after them. This was followed by visits\n",
      "from the wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew the Marquis, from Lady Xing’s brothers’\n",
      "wives, and from the wives of other marriage connections of the family. Bottled\n",
      "charm-water, wonder-working monks and Taoists and highly recommended\n",
      "physicians were also sent round to the mansion by various friends and relations.\n",
      "But the cousins continued delirious and lay on their beds burning with fever and\n",
      "babbling incomprehensibly. At nightfall they became even worse, so that the maids\n",
      "and even the older women no longer dared go near them. The two of them had to be\n",
      "carried into Lady Wang’s room on their beds and set down there side by side so that\n",
      "Jia Yun and a group of pages could watch over them in shifts throughout the night.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Aunt Xue stayed near at hand, refusing\n",
      "to budge, though unable to do anything but sit by and weep. Jia She and Jia Zheng,\n",
      "afraid that their mother’s health would suffer, displayed their con?cern by keeping\n",
      "themselves and everyone else up throughout most of the night. There were lights\n",
      "burning everywhere and hardly anyone slept at all.\n",
      "Jia She continued to hunt everywhere for monks and ex?orcists reputed able to cure\n",
      "diseases of the mind. Finally, Jia Zheng, who saw that their methods were all useless,\n",
      "lost patience with him and tried to make him stop:\n",
      "‘Young people will die if they must. Nothing can alter fate. And that they are fated\n",
      "to die would appear from the fact that all efforts to cure them have been unavailing. I\n",
      "think we should allow them to die in peace.’\n",
      "But Jia She took no notice, and the commotion continued as before.\n",
      "By the third day the patients were so weakened that they lay on their beds\n",
      "motionless and their breathing was scarcely perceptible. The whole family had by\n",
      "\f",
      "now abandoned hope and were already making preparations for their laying-out.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Jia Lian, Patience and Aroma had cried themselves into\n",
      "a state bordering on prostration. Only Aunt Zhao was cheerful — though she did her\n",
      "best to look miserable.\n",
      "Early on the fourth day Bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to\n",
      "Grandmother Jia:\n",
      "‘From now on I can no longer stay in this family. You must get my things ready and\n",
      "let me go.’\n",
      "To the old lady the words were a tearing of heart from body; but Aunt Zhao, who also\n",
      "heard them, had the temerity to urge their acceptance:\n",
      "‘Your Ladyship shouldn’t take it so hard. It’s already all up with the boy. We should\n",
      "be getting his grave clothes ready so that he can go in peace. It will be better that\n",
      "way. If we won’t let him go now, when he’s ready, it will only make more suffering for\n",
      "him in the world to come…’\n",
      "She would have gone on, but Grandmother Jia spat in her face. No empty gesture: it\n",
      "was a full gob of spittle.\n",
      "‘Evil woman! May your tongue rot! How do you know it’s all up with him? You want\n",
      "him to die, don’t you? But if you think you will gain by his death, you must be\n",
      "dreaming; because if he does die, I shall hold you responsible. It’s your spiteful\n",
      "meddling that has forced him to do all this studying. You have reduced the poor child\n",
      "to such a state that the mere sight of his father makes him more scared than a mouse\n",
      "with the cat after it. You have done this, you and the others of your kind. And now I\n",
      "suppose, if you succeed in murdering him, you will be satisfied. But don’t imagine\n",
      "you will escape me — any of you!’\n",
      "She railed and wept. Jia Zheng was close at hand while she was saying all this and\n",
      "was deeply distressed by it. Per?emptorily dismissing the concubine, he tried to calm\n",
      "his mother and reasoned against the injustice of her charges.\n",
      "It was unfortunate that just at that moment a servant should have come in to\n",
      "announce that ‘the two coffins that had been ordered were now ready’. The words\n",
      "were as oil upon fire. The old lady blazed.\n",
      "‘Who gave orders for those coffins to be made? Where is the man who made them?\n",
      "Go and get the man who made those coffins! Flog him to death!’\n",
      "Suddenly, as she raged and stormed, the faint tock tock of a holy man’s wooden fish\n",
      "was heard upon the air and a high monotone chant that kept time with the beat:\n",
      "‘Na-mah A-mi-ta-bha Bo-dhi-satt-va!\n",
      "Mer-ci-ful de-li-ve-rer!\n",
      "All a-fflic-ted and tor-men-ted,\n",

      "\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang at once sent someone into the street to see who it\n",
      "was. The source of the chanting proved to be a disreputable-looking Buddhist monk.\n",
      "Stone describes him in the following quatrain:\n",
      "\n",
      "A bottle nose he had and shaggy brows,\n",
      "Through which peeped eyes that twinkled like bright Stats.\n",
      "His robe was patched and torn, his feet straw-shod,\n",
      "His unclean pate blotched with unsightly scars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was accompanied by a lame Taoist, for whom a similar quatrain has been supplied\n",
      "by our poetical Stone:\n",
      "\n",
      "Up, down he hopped on his unequal legs,\n",
      "From mud and puddle not a stitch left dry.\n",
      "Yet, if you asked him where his dwelling was,\n",
      "‘Westward of Paradise’ he would reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia Zheng had them invited in and asked them what monas?tery they were from. The\n",
      "monk was genially dismissive:\n",
      "‘There is no need for Your Worship to waste time on formalities. Suffice it to say\n",
      "that I heard you had sickness in this house and have come to cure it.\n",
      "‘Two members of this family have, indeed, fallen victims to some kind of\n",
      "witchcraft,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Might one inquire what charm you intend to cure them\n",
      "with?’\n",
      "‘Charm?’ The monk laughed. ‘You already possess in your own house a precious\n",
      "object capable of curing them. What other charm is necessary?’\n",
      "Jia Zheng gave a start.\n",
      "‘To be sure. My son was born with a piece of jade whose inscription makes some\n",
      "such claim - “Dispels the harms of witchcraft”. But as you see, it does not appear to\n",
      "possess the power it lays claim to.’\n",
      "‘That is because the world and its temptations have confused it,’ said the monk. ‘It\n",
      "certainly used to have the power. If you will have the goodness to fetch it for me and\n",
      "allow me to hold it in my hand and say a wee prayer over it, I think I can undertake to\n",
      "\f",
      "bring the power back again.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng took the Magic Jade from Bao-yu’s neck and handed it to the monk, who\n",
      "held it on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a sigh:\n",
      "‘Thirteen years, old friend, since we first met under Green-sickness Peak! Time\n",
      "certainly flies. But you have not finished with this world yet, you know. Dear, dear,\n",

      "\n",

      "From drunken dreaming one day you’ll recover:\n",
      "Then, when all debts are paid, the play will soon be over.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the monk had finished apostrophizing the stone, he rubbed it and polished it\n",
      "between his hands and muttered some strange-sounding words over it.\n",
      "‘There! Its power has now been restored.’ He handed it back to Jia Zheng. ‘But you\n",
      "must be careful that it does not become contaminated again. Hang it above the\n",
      "threshold of the bedroom and let no women apart from the patient’s own mother\n",
      "and grandmother go inside. If you will do that, I can guarantee a complete recovery\n",
      "in thirty-three days.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng would have liked to detain the monk for tea and offer him some\n",
      "remuneration, but he and the Taoist slipped quietly away and could not be traced.\n",
      "The monk’s directions were scrupulously followed. Lady Wang guarded the doorway\n",
      "in person and prevented any unauthorized person from getting into the bedroom. By\n",
      "evening the sufferers had regained consciousness and said they were hungry. This\n",
      "news, so precious to the ears of Lady Jia and Lady Wang, who at once had rice gruel\n",
      "brought in to feed them with, was relayed to the girls in the outer room.\n",

      "Bao-chai laughed, but said nothing. The others were mystified.\n",
      "‘Why do you laugh, Cousin Bao?’ Xi-chun asked her.\n",
      "‘I was thinking how busy He of the Holy Name must be,’ Bao-chai said. ‘Apart from\n",

      "their recovery — not to mention watching over plighted couples to make sure that\n",

      "By the time the thirty-three days’ convalescence had ended, not only were Bao-yu’s\n",
      "health and strength completely restored, but even the burn-marks on his face had\n",
      "vanished, and he was allowed to move back into the Garden.\n",
      "It may be recalled that when Bao-yu’s sickness was at its height, it had been found\n",
      "necessary to call in Jia Yun with a number of pages under his command to take turns\n",
      "in watch?ing over him. Crimson was there too at that time, having been brought in\n",
      "with the other maids from his apartment. During those few days she and Jia Yun\n",
      "therefore had ample opportunity of seeing each other, and a certain familiarity\n",
      "began to grow up between them.\n",
      "Crimson noticed that Jia Yun was often to be seen sporting a handkerchief very much\n",
      "like the one she had lost. She nearly asked him about it, but in the end was too shy.\n",
      "Then, after the monk’s visit, the presence of the menfolk was no longer required and\n",
      "Jia Yun went back to his tree-planting. Though Crimson could still not dismiss the\n",
      "matter entirely from her mind, she did not ask anyone about it for fear of arousing\n",
      "their suspicions.\n",
      "A day or two after their return to Green Delights, Crimson was sitting in her room,\n",
      "still brooding over this handkerchief business, when a voice outside the window\n",
      "inquired whether she was in. Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she\n",
      "\f",
      "recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself.\n",
      "‘Yes, I’m in,’ she said. ‘Come inside!’\n",
      "Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle.\n",
      "‘I’m in luck!’ she said. ‘I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked\n",
      "for some tea to be taken round to Miss Lin’s for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job\n",
      "of taking it. When I got there, Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old\n",
      "Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids, so when she saw me she just said\n",
      "“Here you are!” and gave me two big handfuls of it. I’ve no idea how much it is. Will\n",
      "you look after it for me, please?’\n",
      "She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins. Crimson carefully\n",
      "counted them for her and put them away in a safe place.\n",
      "‘What’s been the matter with you lately?’ said Melilot. ‘If you ask me, I think you\n",
      "ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some\n",
      "medicine.’\n",
      "‘Silly!’ said Crimson. ‘I’m perfectly all right. What should I want to go home for?’\n",
      "‘I know what, then,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Lin’s very weakly. She’s always taking\n",
      "medicine. Why don’t you ask her to give you some of hers? It would probably do just\n",
      "as well.’\n",
      "‘Oh, nonsense!’ said Crimson. ‘You can’t take other peo?ple’s medicines just like\n",
      "that!’\n",
      "‘Well, you can’t go on in this way,’ said Melilot, ‘never eating or drinking properly.\n",
      "What will become of you?\n",
      "‘Who cares?’ said Crimson. ‘The sooner I’m dead the better!’\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t say such things,’ said Melilot, ‘It isn’t right.’\n",
      "‘Why not?’ said Crimson. ‘How do you know what is on my mind?\n",
      "Melilot shook her head sympathetically.\n",
      "‘I can’t say I really blame you,’ she said. ‘Things are very difficult here at times. Take\n",
      "yesterday, for example. Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and\n",
      "there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery, all those who had the trouble of\n",
      "nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades. Well\n",
      "now, I can understand the very young ones like me not being included, but why\n",
      "should they leave you out? I felt really sorry for you when I heard that they’d left you\n",
      "out. Aroma, of course, you’d expect to get more than anyone else. I don’t blame her\n",
      "at all. In fact, I think it’s owing to her. Let’s be honest: none of us can compare with\n",
      "Aroma. I mean, even if she didn’t always take so much trouble over everything, no\n",
      "one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share. What makes me so angry\n",
      "is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when every?one\n",
      "knows they’re only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu. Doesn’t it make you\n",
      "\f",
      "angry?’\n",
      "‘I don’t see much point in getting angry,’ said Crimson. ‘You know what they said\n",
      "about the mile-wide marquee: “Even the longest party must have an end”? Well,\n",
      "none of us is here for ever, you know. Another four or five years from now when\n",
      "we’ve each gone our different ways it won’t matter any longer what all the rest of us\n",
      "are doing.’\n",
      "Little Melilot found this talk of parting and impermanence vaguely affecting and a\n",
      "slight moisture was to be observed about her eyes. She thought shame to cry\n",
      "without good cause, however, and masked her emotion with a smile:\n",
      "‘That’s perfectly true. Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things he’s\n",
      "going to do to his rooms and the clothes he’s going to have made and everything, just\n",
      "as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in.’\n",
      "Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilot’s simplicity or at Bao-yu’s\n",
      "improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came\n",
      "running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl’s horns. She was\n",
      "carrying some patterns and sheets of paper.\n",
      "‘You’re to copy out these two patterns.’\n",
      "She threw them in Crimson’s direction and straightway darted out again. Crimson\n",
      "shouted after her:\n",
      "‘Who are they for, then? You might at least finish your message before rushing off.\n",
      "What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for\n",
      "you and you’re afraid they’ll get cold?’\n",
      "‘They’re for Mackerel.’ The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer\n",
      "through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam,\n",
      "plim-plam, plim-plam, as fast as she had come.\n",
      "Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a\n",
      "brush to trace them with. After rummaging for several minutes she had only\n",
      "succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use.\n",
      "‘Funny!’ she said. ‘I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day ...’\n",
      "She thought a bit, then laughed at herself as she remembered:\n",
      "‘Of course. Oriole took it, the evening before last.’ She turned to Melilot. ‘Would\n",
      "you go and get it for me, then?’\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Aroma’s waiting for me to fetch some boxes\n",
      "for her. You’ll have to get it yourself.’\n",
      "‘If Aroma’s waiting for you, why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time?’\n",

      "would she? Lazy little beast!’\n",
      "She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of\n",

      "go and ask him in. Let’s hope Their Ladyships don’t find out about it. There’ll be\n",
      "trouble if they do.’\n",
      "‘Are you really going to ask him in?’\n",
      "‘Yes. Why?’\n",
      "Crimson laughed:\n",
      "‘If your Mr Yun knows what’s good for him, he won’t agree to come.’\n",
      "‘He’s no fool,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Why shouldn’t he?’\n",
      "‘Any way, if he does come in,’ said Crimson, ignoring her question, ‘you can’t just\n",
      "bring him in and then leave him, Mrs Li. You’ll have to take him back again yourself\n",
      "afterwards. You don’t want him wandering off on his own. There’s no knowing who\n",
      "he might bump into.’\n",

      "get back presently - one of the girls, or one of the older women, maybe.’\n",
      "She hobbled off on her stick, leaving Crimson standing there in a muse, her mission\n",

      "minute or two later when a little maid came along, who, seeing that it was Crimson,\n",
      "asked her what she was doing there. Crimson looked up. It was Trinket, another of\n",
      "the maids from Green Delights.\n",
      "‘Where are you going?’ Crimson asked her.\n",
      "‘I’ve been sent to fetch Mr Yun,’ said Trinket. ‘I have to bring him inside to meet\n",
      "Master Bao.’\n",
      "She ran off on her way.\n",
      "At the gate to Wasp Waist Bridge Crimson ran into Trinket again, this time with Jia\n",

      "with Trinket, sought his. Their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished; then\n",

      "Our narrative now follows Jia Yun and Trinket along the winding pathway to the\n",
      "House of Green Delights. Soon they were at the courtyard gate and Jia Yun waited\n",
      "outside while she went in to announce his arrival. She returned presently to lead him\n",
      "inside.\n",
      "There were a few scattered rocks in the courtyard and some clumps of jade-green\n",
      "plantain. Two storks stood in the shadow of a pine-tree, preening themselves with\n",
      "their long bills. The gallery surrounding the courtyard was hung with cages of unusual\n",
      "design in which perched or fluttered a wide variety of birds, some of them\n",
      "gay-plumaged exotic ones. Above the steps was a little five-frame penthouse building\n",
      "with a glimpse of delicately-carved partitions visible through the open doorway,\n",
      "above which a horizontal board hung, inscribed with the words\n",
      "\n",
      "CRIMSON JOYS AND GREEN DELIGHTS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So that’s why it’s called “The House of Green Delights”’ Jia Yun told himself. ‘The\n",
      "name is taken from the inscription.’\n",
      "A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements:\n",
      "‘Come on in! It must be two or three months since I first forgot our appointment!’\n",
      "Jia Yun recognized the voice as Bao-yu’s and hurried up the steps inside. He looked\n",
      "about him, dazzled by the bril?liance of gold and semi-precious inlay-work and the\n",
      "richness of the ornaments and furnishings, but unable to see Bao-yu in the midst of it\n",
      "all. To the left of him was a full-length mirror from behind which two girls now\n",
      "emerged, both about fifteen or sixteen years old and of much the same build and\n",
      "height. They addressed him by name and asked him to come inside. Slightly\n",
      "overawed, he muttered something in reply and hurried after them, not daring to take\n",
      "more than a furtive glance at them from the corner of his eye. They ushered him into\n",
      "a tent-like summer ‘cabinet’ of green net, whose principal furniture was a tiny\n",
      "lacquered bed with crimson hangings heavily patterned in gold. On this Bao-yu,\n",
      "wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers, was reclining, book in hand.\n",
      "He threw the book down as Jia Yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming\n",
      "smile. Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting. Bidden to sit, he\n",
      "modestly placed himself on a bedside chair.\n",
      "‘After I invited you round to my study that day,’ said Bao-yu, ‘a whole lot of things\n",
      "seemed to happen one after the other, and I’m afraid I quite forgot about your visit.’\n",
      "Jia Yun returned his smile:\n",
      "‘Let’s just say that it wasn’t my luck to see you then. But you have been ill since\n",
      "then, Uncle Bao. Are you quite better now?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Quite better, thank you. I hear you’ve been very busy these last few days.’\n",
      "‘That’s as it should be,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But I’m glad you are better, Uncle. That’s a\n",
      "piece of good fortune for all of us.’\n",
      "As they chatted, a maid came in with some tea. Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she\n",
      "approached, but his eyes were on her. She was tall and rather thin with a long oval\n",
      "face, and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt\n",
      "and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress.\n",
      "In the course of his brief sojourn among them in the early days of Bao-yu’s illness, Jia\n",
      "Yun had got by heart the names of most of the principal females of Bao-yu’s\n",
      "establishment. He knew at a glance that the maid now serving him tea was Aroma.\n",
      "He was also aware that she was in some way more important than the other maids\n",
      "and that to be waited on by her in the seated presence of her master was an honour.\n",
      "Jumping hastily to his feet he addressed her with a modest smile:\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t pour tea for me, Miss! I’m not like a visitor here. You should let me\n",
      "pour for myself!’\n",
      "‘Oh do sit down!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t have to be like that in front of the maids!’\n",
      "‘I know,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But a body-servant! I don’t like to presume.’\n",
      "He sat down, nevertheless, and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a\n",
      "number of unimportant topics. He told him which household kept the best troupe of\n",
      "players, which had the finest gardens, whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the\n",
      "best parties, and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets. Jia\n",
      "Yun did his best to keep up with him. After a while Bao-yu showed signs of flagging,\n",
      "and when Jia Yun, observing what appeared to be fatigue, rose to take his leave, he\n",
      "did not very strongly press him to stay.\n",
      "‘You must come again when you can spare the time,’ said Bao-yu, and ordered\n",
      "Trinket to see him out of the Garden.\n",
      "Once outside the gateway of Green Delights, Jia Yun looked around him on all sides,\n",
      "and having ascertained that there was no one else about, slowed down to a more\n",
      "dawdling pace so that he could ask Trinket a few questions. Indeed, the little maid\n",
      "was subjected to quite a catechism: How old was she? What was her name? What\n",
      "did her father and mother do? How many years had she been working for his Uncle\n",
      "Bao? How much pay did she get a month? How many girls were there working for\n",
      "him altogether? Trinket seemed to have no objection, however, and answered each\n",
      "question as it came.\n",
      "‘That girl you were talking to on the way in,’ he said, ‘isn’t her name “Crimson”?’\n",
      "Trinket laughed:\n",
      "‘Yes. Why do you ask?’\n",
      "‘I heard her asking you about a handkerchief. Only it just so happens that I picked\n",
      "\f",
      "one up.’\n",
      "Trinket showed interest.\n",
      "‘She’s asked me about that handkerchief of hers a number of times. I told her, I’ve\n",
      "got better things to do with my time than go looking for people’s handkerchiefs. But\n",
      "when she asked me about it again today, she said that if I could find it for her, she’d\n",
      "give me a reward. Come to think of it, you were there when she said that, weren’t\n",
      "you? It was when we were outside the gate of Allspice Court. So you can bear me out.\n",
      "Oh Mr Jia, please let me have it if you’ve picked it up and I’ll be able to see what she\n",
      "will give me for it!’\n",
      "Jia Yun had picked up a silk handkerchief a month pre?viously at the time when his\n",
      "tree-planting activities had just started. He knew that it must have been dropped by\n",
      "one or another of the female inmates of the Garden, but not knowing which, had not\n",
      "so far ventured to do anything about his dis?covery. When earlier on he had heard\n",
      "Crimson question Trinket about her loss, he had realized, with a thrill of pleasure,\n",
      "that the handkerchief he had picked up must have been hers. Trinket’s request now\n",
      "gave him just the opening he required. He drew a handkerchief of his own from\n",
      "inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile:\n",
      "‘I’ll give it to you on one condition. If she lets you have this reward you were\n",
      "speaking of; you’ve got to let me know. No cheating, mind!’\n",
      "Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed\n",
      "of the outcome, and having seen him out of the Garden, went back again to look for\n",
      "Crimson.\n",

      "Our narrative returns now to Bao-yu.\n",
      "After disposing of Jia Yun, Bao-yu continued to feel ex?tremely lethargic and lay back\n",
      "on the bed with every appear?ance of being about to doze off to sleep. Aroma\n",
      "hurried over to him and, sitting on the edge of the bed, roused him with a shake:\n",
      "‘Come on! Surely you are not going to sleep again? You need some fresh air. Why\n",
      "don’t you go outside and walk around for a bit?’\n",
      "Bao-yu took her by the hand and smiled at her.\n",
      "‘I’d like to go,’ he said, ‘but I don’t want to leave you.’\n",
      "‘Silly!’ said Aroma with a laugh. ‘Don’t say what you don’t mean!’\n",
      "She hoicked him to his feet.\n",
      "‘Well, where am I going to go then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just feel so bored.’\n",
      "‘Never mind where, just go out!’ said Aroma. ‘If you stay moping indoors like this,\n",
      "you’ll get even more bored.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu followed her advice, albeit half-heartedly, and went out into the courtyard.\n",
      "After visiting the cages in the gallery and playing for a bit with the birds, he ambled\n",
      "out of the courtyard into the Garden and along the batik of Drenched Blossoms\n",
      "Stream, pausing for a while to look at the goldfish in the water. As he did so, a pair of\n",
      "fawns came running like the wind from the hillside opposite. Bao-yu was puzzled.\n",
      "There seemed to be no reason for their mysterious terror. But just then little Jia Lan\n",
      "came running down the same slope after them, a tiny bow clutched in his hand.\n",
      "Seeing his uncle ahead of him, he stood politely to attention and greeted him\n",
      "cheerfully:\n",
      "‘Hello, Uncle. I didn’t know you were at home. I thought you’d gone out.’\n",
      "‘Mischievous little blighter, aren’t you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you want to go\n",
      "shooting them for, poor little things?’\n",
      "‘I’ve got no reading to do today,’ said Jia Lan, ‘and I don’t like to hang about doing\n",
      "nothing, so I thought I’d practise my archery and equitation.’\n",
      "‘Goodness! You’d better not waste time jawing, then,’ said Bao-yu, and left the\n",
      "young toxophilite to his pursuits.\n",
      "Moving on, without much thinking where he was going, he came presently to the\n",
      "gate of a courtyard.\n",
      "Denser than feathers on the phoenix’ tail\n",
      "The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragon’s moan.\n",
      "The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet\n",
      "had, without conscious direction, carried him to the Naiad’s House. Of their own\n",
      "accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard.\n",
      "The House seemed silent and deserted, its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to\n",
      "the ground; but as he approached the window, he detected a faint sweetness in the\n",
      "air, traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green\n",
      "gauze of the casement. He pressed his face to the gauze; but before his eyes could\n",
      "distinguish anything, his ear became aware of a long, languorous sigh and the sound\n",
      "of a voice speaking:\n",
      "‘Each day in a drowsy waking dream of love.’\n",
      "Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker. He could see her now. It was Dai-yu, of\n",
      "course, lying on her bed, stretching herself and yawning luxuriously.\n",
      "He laughed:\n",
      "‘Why “each day in a drowsy waking dream of love”?’ he asked through the window\n",
      "(the words were from his beloved Western Chamber); then going to the doorway he\n",
      "lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room.\n",
      "Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face\n",
      "with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu\n",
      "\f",
      "went over intending to turn her back again, but just at that moment Dai-yu’s old\n",
      "wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels:\n",
      "‘Miss Lin’s asleep, sir. Would you mind coming back again after she’s woken up?’\n",
      "Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh:\n",
      "‘Who’s asleep?’\n",
      "The three old women laughed apologetically.\n",
      "‘Sorry, miss. We thought you were asleep. Nightingale! Come inside now! Your\n",
      "mistress is awake.’\n",
      "Having shouted for Nightingale, the three guardians of morality retired.\n",
      "‘What do you mean by coming into people’s rooms when they’re asleep?’ said\n",
      "Dai-yu, smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the bed’s edge patting her hair into shape.\n",
      "At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little\n",
      "misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him. He sank into a chair and\n",
      "smiled back at her:\n",
      "‘What was that you were saying just now before I came in?’\n",
      "‘I didn’t say anything,’ said Dai-yu.\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her:\n",
      "‘Put that on your tongue, girl! I heard you say it.’ While they were talking to one\n",
      "another, Nightingale came in.\n",
      "‘Nightingale,’ said Bao-yu, ‘what about a cup of that excellent tea of yours?’\n",
      "‘Excellent tea?’ said Nightingale. ‘There’s nothing very special about the tea we\n",
      "drink here. If nothing but the best will do, you’d better wait for Aroma to come.’\n",
      "‘Never mind about him!’ said Dai-yu. ‘First go and get me some water!’\n",
      "‘He is our guest,’ said Nightingale. ‘I can’t fetch you any water until I’ve given him\n",
      "his tea.’ And she went to pour him a cup.\n",
      "‘Good girl!’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If with your amorous mistress I should wed,\n",
      "‘Tis you, sweet maid, must make our bridal bed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The words, like Dai-yu’s languorous line, were from Western Chamber, but in\n",
      "somewhat dubious taste. Dai-yu was dreadfully offended by them. In an instant the\n",
      "smile had vanished from her face.\n",
      "‘What was that you said?’ He laughed:\n",
      "‘I didn’t say anything.’ Dai-yu began to cry.\n",
      "‘This is your latest amusement, I suppose. Every time you hear some coarse\n",
      "expression outside or read some crude, disgusting book, you have to come back here\n",
      "and give me the benefit of it. I am to become a source of entertainment for the\n",
      "\f",
      "menfolk now, it seems.’\n",
      "She rose, weeping, from the bed and went outside. Bao-yu followed her in alarm.\n",
      "‘Dearest coz, it was very wrong of me to say that, but it just slipped out without\n",
      "thinking. Please don’t go and tell! I promise never to say anything like that again.\n",
      "May my mouth rot and my tongue decay if I do!’\n",
      "Just at that moment Aroma came hurrying up:\n",
      "‘Quick!’ she said. ‘You must come back and change. The Master wants to see you.’\n",
      "The descent of this thunderbolt drove all else from his mind and he rushed off in a\n",
      "panic. As soon as he had changed, he hurried out of the Garden. Tealeaf was waiting\n",
      "for him outside the inner gate.\n",
      "‘I suppose you don’t know what he wants to see me about?’ Bao-yu asked him.\n",
      "‘I should hurry up, if I were you,’ said Tealeaf. ‘All I know is that he wants to see you.\n",
      "You’ll find out why soon enough when you get there.’\n",
      "He hustled him along as he spoke.\n",
      "They had passed round the main hall, Bao-yu still in a state of fluttering\n",
      "apprehensiveness when there was a loud guffaw from a corner of the wall. It was Xue\n",
      "Pan, clapping his hands and stamping his feet in mirth.\n",
      "‘Ho! Ho! Ho! You’d never have come this quickly if you hadn’t been told that Uncle\n",
      "wanted you!’\n",
      "Tealeaf, also laughing, fell on his knees. Bao-yu stood there looking puzzled. It was\n",
      "some moments before it dawned on him that he had been hoaxed. Xue Pan was by\n",
      "this time being apologetic — bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how\n",
      "sorry he was:\n",
      "‘Don’t blame the lad!’ he said. ‘It wasn’t his fault. I talked him into it.’\n",
      "Bao-yu saw that he could do nothing, and might as well accept with a good grace.\n",
      "‘I don’t mind being made a fool of,’ he said, ‘but I think it was going a bit far to\n",
      "bring my father into it. I think perhaps I’d better tell Aunt Xue and see what she\n",
      "thinks about it all.’\n",
      "‘Now look here, old chap,’ said Xue Pan, getting agitated, ‘it was only because I\n",
      "wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker. I admit it was very wrong of me to make free\n",
      "with your Parent, but after all, you’ve only got to mention my father next time you\n",
      "want to fool me and we’ll be quits!’\n",
      "‘Aiyo!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Worse and worse!’ He turned to Tealeaf: ‘Treacherous little\n",
      "beast! What are you still kneeling for?’\n",
      "Tealeaf kotowed and rose to his feet.\n",
      "‘Look,’ said Xue Pan. ‘I wouldn’t have troubled you other?wise, only it’s my birthday\n",
      "on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I\n",
      "don’t know where they got them from but they’ve given me:\n",

      "a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that;\n",
      "and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute\n",
      "from Siam.\n",
      "Don’t you think it was clever of them to get me those things? Maybe not so much the\n",
      "sturgeon and the sucking-pig. They’re just expensive. But where would you go to get\n",
      "a piece of lotus root or a melon like that? However did they get them to grow so big?\n",
      "I’ve given some of the stuff to Mother, and while I was about it I sent some round to\n",
      "your grandmother and Auntie Wang, but I’ve still got a lot left over. I can’t eat it all\n",
      "myself: it would be unlucky. But apart from me, the only person I can think of who is\n",
      "worthy to eat a present like this is you. That’s why I came over specially to invite you.\n",
      "And we’re lucky, because we’ve got a little chap who sings coming round as well. So\n",
      "you and I will be able to sit down and make a day of it, eh? Really enjoy ourselves.’\n",

      "When the bowings and courtesies were over and tea had been taken, Xue Pan called\n",
      "for his servants to lay. A tremendous bustle ensued, which seemed to go on for quite\n",
      "a long time before everything was finally ready and the diners were able to take their\n",
      "places at the table.\n",
      "Bao-yu noticed sliced melon and lotus root among the dishes, both of unusual quality\n",

      "‘It seems wrong to be sharing your presents with you before I have given you\n",
      "anything myself,’ he said jokingly.\n",

      "Something new and out of the ordinary, I hope.’\n",
      "‘I haven’t really got anything much to give you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Things like money and\n",
      "food and clothing I don’t want for, but they’re not really mine to give. The only way I\n",
      "could give you something that would really be mine would be by doing some\n",
      "calligraphy or painting a picture for you.’\n",
      "‘Talking of pictures,’ said Xue Pan genially, ‘that’s reminded me. I saw a set of dirty\n",
      "pictures in someone’s house the other day. They were real beauties. There was a lot\n",
      "of writing on top that I didn’t pay much attention to, but I did notice the signature. I\n",
      "think it was “Geng Huang”, the man who painted them. They were really good!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was puzzled. His knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both\n",
      "past and present was not inconsiderable, but he had never in all his experience come\n",
      "\f",
      "across a ‘Geng Huang’. After racking his brains for some moments he suddenly began\n",
      "to chuckle and called for a writing-brush. A writing-brush having been produced by\n",

      "written:\n",
      "‘Yes, it must have been “Tang Yin”. Mr Xue couldn’t have been seeing straight that\n",
      "day. Ha! Ha! Ha!’\n",

      "embarrassed laugh:\n",
      "‘Oh, Tankin’ or wankin’,’ he said, ‘what difference does it make, anyway?’\n",
      "Just then ‘Mr Feng’ was announced by one of the servants, which Bao-yu knew could\n",
      "only mean General Feng Tang’s son, Feng Zi-ying. Xue Pan and the rest told the boy\n",
      "to bring him in immediately, but Feng Zi-ying was already striding in, talking and\n",
      "laughing as he went. The others hurriedly rose and invited him to take a seat.\n",
      "‘Ha!’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘No need to go out then. Enjoyin’ yourselves at home, eh?\n",
      "Very nice too!’\n",
      "‘It’s a long time since we’ve seen you around,’ said Bao-yu. ‘How’s the General?’\n",
      "‘Fahver’s in good health, thank you very much,’ said Feng Zi-ying, ‘but Muvver\n",
      "hasn’t been too well lately. Caught a chill or somethin’.’\n",
      "Observing with glee that Feng Zi-ying was sporting a black eye, Xue Pan asked him\n",
      "how he had come by it:\n",
      "‘Been having a dust-up, then? Who was it this time? Looks as if he left his\n",
      "signature!’\n",
      "Feng Zi-ying laughed:\n",
      "‘Don’t use the mitts any more nowadays — not since that time I laid into Colonel\n",
      "Chou’s son and did him an injury. That was a lesson to me. I’ve learned to keep my\n",
      "temper since then. No, this happened the other day durin’ a huntin’ ex?pedition in\n",
      "the Iron Net Mountains. I got flicked by a gos?hawk’s wing.’\n",
      "‘When was this?’ Bao-yu asked him.\n",
      "‘We left on the twenty-eighth of last month,’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘Didn’t get back till a\n",
      "few days ago.’\n",
      "‘Ah, that explains why I didn’t see you at Shen’s party earlier this month,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu. ‘I meant at the time to ask why you weren’t there, but I forgot. Did you go\n",
      "alone on this expedition or was the General there with you?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Fahver most certainly was there,’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘I was practically dragged along\n",
      "in tow. Do you think I’m mad enough to go rushin’ off in pursuit of hideous hardships\n",
      "when I could be sittin’ comfortably at home eatin’ good food and drinkin’ good wine\n",
      "and listenin’ to the odd song or two? Still, some good came of it. It was a lucky\n",
      "accident.’\n",
      "As he had now finished his tea, Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them\n",
      "his story at leisure, but Feng Zi-?ying rose to his feet again and declined.\n",
      "‘I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you,’ he said, ‘but there’s\n",
      "somethin’ very important I’ve got to see Fahver about now, so I’m afraid I really must\n",
      "refuse.’\n",
      "But Xue Pan, Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with\n",
      "this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table.\n",
      "‘Now look here, this is too bad!’ Feng Zi-ying good-hum?ouredly protested. ‘All the\n",
      "years we’ve been knockin’ around togevver we’ve never before insisted that a fellow\n",
      "should have to stay if he don’t want to. The fact is, I really can’t. Oh well, if I must\n",
      "have a drink, fetch some decent-sized cups and I’ll just put down a couple of quick\n",
      "ones!’\n",
      "This was dearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced. Two\n",
      "sconce-cups were brought and ceremoniously filled, Bao-yu holding the cups and Xue\n",
      "Pan pouring from the wine-kettle. Feng Zi-ying drank them standing, one after the\n",
      "other, each in a single breath.\n",
      "‘Now come on,’ said Bao-yu, ‘let’s hear about this “lucky accident” before you go!’\n",
      "Feng Zi-ying laughed:\n",
      "‘Couldn’t tell it properly just now,’ he said. ‘It’s somethin’ that needs a special party\n",
      "all to itself. I’ll invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the\n",
      "details then. There’s a favour I want to ask too, by the bye, so we’ll be able to talk\n",
      "about that then as well.’\n",
      "He made a determined movement towards the door.\n",
      "‘Now you’ve got us all peeing ourselves with curiosity!’ said Xue Pan. ‘You might at\n",
      "least tell us when this party is going to be, to put us out of our suspense.’\n",
      "‘Not more than ten days’ time and not less than eight,’ said Feng Zi-ying; and going\n",
      "out into the courtyard, he jumped on his horse and clattered away.\n",
      "Having seen him off, the others went in again, reseated themselves at table, and\n",
      "resumed their potations. When the party finally broke up, Bao-yu returned to the\n",
      "Garden in a state of cheerful inebriation. Aroma, who had had no idea what the\n",
      "summons from Jia Zheng might portend and was still wondering anxiously what had\n",
      "become of him, at once demanded to know the cause of his condition. He gave her a\n",
      "full account of what had happened.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Well really!’ said Aroma. ‘Here were we practically beside ourselves with anxiety,\n",

      "to let us know you were all right.’\n",
      "‘I was going to send word,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Of course I was. But then old Feng arrived\n",
      "and it put it out of my mind,’\n",
      "At that moment Bao-chai walked in, all smiles.\n",
      "‘I hear you’ve made a start on the famous present,’ she said.\n",
      "‘But surely you and your family must have had some al?ready ?’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Bao-chai shook her head:\n",
      "‘Pan was very pressing that I should have some, but I refused. I told him to save it\n",

      "Our narrative returns now to Dai-yu.\n",
      "Having been present when Bao-yu received his summons, Dai-yu, too, was greatly\n",
      "worried about him - the more so as the day advanced and he had still not returned.\n",
      "Then in the evening, some time after dinner, she heard that he had just got back and\n",
      "resolved to go over and ask him exactly what had happened. She was sauntering\n",
      "along on the way there when she caught sight of Bao-chai some distance ahead of\n",
      "her, just entering Bao-yu’s courtyard. Continuing to amble on, she came presently to\n",
      "Drenched Blossoms Bridge, from which a large number of different kinds of fish were\n",
      "to be seen swimming about in the water below. Dai-yu did not know what kinds of\n",
      "fish they were, but they were so beautiful that she had to stop and admire them, and\n",
      "by the time she reached the House of Green Delights, the courtyard gate had been\n",
      "shut for the night and she was obliged to knock for ad?mittance.\n",
      "Now it so happened that Skybright had just been having a quarrel with Emerald, and\n",
      "being thoroughly out of temper, was venting some of her ill-humour on the lately\n",
      "arrived Bao-chai, complaining sotto voce behind her back about ‘people who were\n",
      "always inventing excuses to come dropping in and who kept other people staying up\n",
      "half the night when they would like to be in bed’. A knock at the gate coming in the\n",
      "midst of these resentful mutterings was enough to make her really angry.\n",
      "‘They’ve all gone to bed,’ she shouted, not even bothering to inquire who the caller\n",
      "was. ‘Come again tomorrow!’\n",
      "Dai-yu was aware that Bao-yu’s maids often played tricks on one another, and it\n",
      "\f",
      "occurred to her that the girl in the courtyard, not recognizing her voice, might have\n",
      "mistaken her for another maid and be keeping her locked out for a joke. She\n",

      "that I’m not to let anyone in.’\n",
      "Dumbfounded by her insolence, Dai-yu stood outside the gate in silence. She could\n",
      "not, however much she felt like it, give vent to her anger in noisy expostulation.\n",
      "‘Although they are always telling me to treat my Uncle’s house as my own,’ she\n",
      "reflected, ‘I am still really an outsider. And now that Mother and Father are both\n",
      "dead and I am on my own, to make a fuss about a thing like this when I am living in\n",
      "some?one else’s house could only lead to further unpleasantness.’\n",

      "a sudden volley of talk and laughter reached her from inside. It resolved itself, as she\n",
      "listened attentively, into the voices of Bao-yu and Bao-chai. An even bitterer sense of\n",
      "chagrin took possession of her. Suddenly, as she hunted in her mind for some\n",
      "possible reason for her exclusion, she remembered the events of the morning and\n",
      "concluded that Bao-yu must think she had told on him to his parents and was\n",
      "punishing her for her betrayal.\n",
      "‘But I would never betray you!’ she expostulated with him in her mind. ‘Why\n",
      "couldn’t you have asked first, before letting your resentment carry you to such\n",
      "lengths? If you won’t see me today, does that mean that from now on we are going\n",

      "began to cry as though her heart would break. And as if Nature herself were affected\n",
      "by the grief of so beautiful a creature, the crows who had been roosting in the trees\n",
      "round about flew up with a great commotion and removed themselves to another\n",

      "remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves\n",
      "with their own affairs.\n",
      "She sat, motionless as a statue, leaning against the back of the bed, her hands\n",

      "commencement was on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month at two o’clock in\n",

      "the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer; it is\n",
      "about this time that the blossom begins to fail; and tradition has it that the\n",

      "While she was on her way, she caught sight of élégante and the eleven other little\n",

      "To and fro fluttered the pair of butterflies, sometimes alight?ing for a moment, but\n",
      "always flying off again before she could reach them. Once they seemed on the point\n",
      "of flying across the little river that flowed through the midst of the garden and\n",
      "Bao-chai had to stalk them with bated breath for fear of start?ling them out on to the\n",
      "water. By the time she had reached the Raindrop Pavilion she was perspiring freely\n",
      "and her interest in the butterflies was beginning to evaporate. She was about to turn\n",
      "back when she became aware of a low murmur of voices coming from inside the\n",
      "pavilion.\n",
      "\f",
      "Raindrop Pavilion was built in such a way that it projected into the middle of the pool\n",
      "into which the little watercourse widened out at this point, so that on three of its\n",
      "sides it looked out on to the water. It was surrounded by a verandah, whose railing\n",
      "followed the many angles formed by the bays and projections of the base. In each of\n",
      "its wooden walls there was a large paper-covered casement of elegantly patterned\n",
      "lattice-work.\n",
      "Hearing voices inside the pavilion, Bao-chai halted and in?clined her ear to listen.\n",
      "‘Are you sure this is your handkerchief?’ one of the voices was saying. ‘If it is, take it;\n",
      "but if it isn’t, I must return it to Mr Yun.’\n",
      "‘Of course it’s mine,’ said the second voice. ‘Come on, let me have it!’\n",
      "‘Are you going to give me a reward? I hope I haven’t taken all this trouble for\n",
      "nothing.’\n",
      "‘I promised you I would give you a reward, and so I shall. Surely you don’t think I\n",
      "was deceiving you?’\n",
      "‘All right, I get a reward for bringing it to you. But what about the person who\n",
      "picked it up? Doesn’t he get anything?’\n",
      "‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said the second voice. ‘He’s one of the masters. A master\n",
      "picking up something belonging to one of us should give it back as a matter of course.\n",
      "How can there be any question of rewarding him?’\n",
      "‘If you don’t intend to reward him, what am I supposed to tell him when I see him?\n",
      "He was most insistent that I wasn’t to give you the handkerchief unless you gave him\n",
      "a reward.’ There was a long pause, after which the second voice re?plied:\n",
      "‘Oh, all right. Let him have this other handkerchief of mine then. That will have to\n",
      "do as his reward - But you must swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone else about\n",
      "this.’\n",
      "‘May my mouth rot and may I die a horrible death if I ever tell anyone else about\n",
      "this, amen!’ said the first voice.\n",
      "‘Goodness!’ said the second voice again. ‘Here we are talk?ing away, and all the\n",
      "time someone could be creeping up out?side and listening to every word we say. We\n",
      "had better open these casements; then even if anyone outside sees us, they’ll think\n",
      "we are having an ordinary conversation; and we shall be able to see them and know\n",
      "in time when to stop.’\n",
      "Bao-chai, listening outside, gave a start.\n",
      "‘No wonder they say “venery and thievery sharpen the wits”,’ she thought. ‘If they\n",
      "open those windows and see me here, they are going to feel terribly embarrassed.\n",
      "And one of those voices sounds like that proud, peculiar girl Crimson who works in\n",
      "Bao-yu’s room. If a girl like that knows that I have overheard her doing something she\n",
      "shouldn’t be doing, it will be a case of “the desperate dog will jump a wall, the\n",

      "desperate man will hazard all”: there’ll be a great deal of trouble and I shall be\n",
      "involved in it. There isn’t time to hide. I shall have to do as the cicada does when he\n",
      "jumps out of his skin: give them something to put them off the scent—’\n",
      "There was a loud creak as the casement yielded. Bao-chai advanced with deliberately\n",
      "noisy tread.\n",
      "‘Frowner!’ she called out gaily. ‘I know where you’re hid?ing.’\n",
      "Inside the pavilion Crimson and Trinket, who heard her say this and saw her\n",
      "advancing towards them just as they were opening the casement, were speechless\n",
      "with amazement; but Bao-chai ignored their confusion and addressed them genially:\n",
      "‘Have you two got Miss Lin hidden away in there?’\n",
      "‘I haven’t seen Miss Lin,’ said Trinket.\n",
      "‘I saw her just now from the river-bank,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She was squatting down\n",
      "over here playing with something in the water. I was going to creep up and surprise\n",
      "her, but she spotted me before I could get up to her and disappeared round this\n",
      "corner. Are you sure she’s not hiding in there?’\n",
      "She made a point of going inside the pavilion and searching; then, coming out again,\n",
      "she said in a voice loud enough for them to hear:\n",
      "‘If she’s not in the pavilion, she must have crept into that grotto. Oh well, if she’s\n",
      "not afraid of being bitten by a snake — !’\n",
      "As she walked away she laughed inwardly at the ease with which she had extricated\n",
      "herself from a difficult situation.\n",
      "‘I think I’m fairly safely out of that one,’ she thought. ‘I wonder what those two will\n",
      "make of it.’\n",
      "What indeed! Crimson believed every word that Bao-chai had said, and as soon as\n",
      "the latter was at a distance, she seized hold of Trinket in alarm:\n",
      "‘Oh, how terrible! If Miss Lin was squatting there, she must have heard what we\n",
      "said before she went away.’\n",
      "Her companion was silent.\n",
      "‘Oh dear! What do you think she’ll do?’ said Crimson.\n",
      "‘Well, suppose she did hear,’ said Trinket, ‘it’s not her backache. If we mind our\n",
      "business and she minds hers, there’s no reason why anything should come of it.’\n",
      "‘If it were Miss Bao that had heard us, I don’t suppose anything would,’ said\n",
      "Crimson; ‘but Miss Lin is so critical and so intolerant. If she heard it and it gets about\n",
      "— oh dear!’\n",
      "But just at that moment Caltrop, Advent, Chess and Scribe were seen approaching\n",
      "the pavilion, and Crimson and Trinket had to drop the subject in a hurry and join in a\n",
      "general conversation. Crimson noticed Xi-feng standing half-way up the rockery\n",
      "above the little grotto, beckoning. Breaking away from the others, she bounded up to\n",
      "\f",
      "her with a smiling face:\n",
      "‘What can I do for you, madam?’\n",
      "Xi-feng ran an appraising eye over her. A neat, pretty, pleasantly-spoken girl, she\n",
      "decided, and smiled at her graciously:\n",
      "‘I have come here without my maids and need someone to a message back to my\n",
      "apartment. I wonder if you are clever enough to get it right.’\n",
      "‘Tell me the message, madam. If I don’t get it right and make a mess of it, it will be\n",
      "up to you to punish me.’\n",
      "‘Which of the young ladies do you work for?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’d better know, so that I\n",
      "can explain to her if she asks for you while you are doing my errand.’\n",
      "‘I work for Master Bao,’ said Crimson.\n",
      "Xi-feng laughed.\n",
      "‘Ah ha! You work for Master Bao. No wonder. Very well, then, if he asks for you\n",
      "while you are away, I shall explain. I want you to go to my apartment and tell\n",
      "Patience that there is a roll of money under the stand of the Ru-ware dish on the\n",
      "table in the outside room. There are a hundred and twenty taels of silver in it to pay\n",
      "the embroiderers with. Tell her that when Zhang Cai’s wife comes for it, she is to\n",
      "weigh it out in front of her before handing it over. And there’s one other thing.\n",
      "There’s a little purse at the head of the bed in my inside room. I want you to bring it\n",
      "to me.’\n",
      "‘Yes madam,’ said Crimson, and hurried off.\n",
      "Returning shortly afterwards, she found that Xi-feng was no longer on the rockery;\n",
      "but Chess had just emerged from the little grotto beneath it and was standing there\n",
      "doing up her sash. Crimson ran down to speak to her:\n",
      "‘Excuse me, did you see where Mrs Lian went to?’\n",
      "‘’Fraid I didn’t notice,’ said Chess.\n",
      "Crimson looked around her. Bao-chai and Tan-chun were standing at the edge of the\n",
      "pool looking at the fish. She went up to them:\n",
      "‘Excuse me, does either of you young ladies happen to know where Mrs Lian went\n",
      "to just now, please?’\n",
      "‘Try Mrs Zhu’s place,’ said Tan-chun.\n",
      "Crimson hurried off in the direction of Sweet-rice Village. On her way she ran\n",
      "head-on into a party of maids consisting of Skybright, Mackerel, Emerald, Ripple,\n",
      "Musk, Scribe, Pic?ture and Oriole.\n",
      "‘Here, what are you gadding about like this for?’ said Sky?bright as soon as she saw\n",
      "who it was. ‘The flowers want watering; the birds need feeding; the stove for the\n",
      "tea-water needs seeing to. You’ve no business to go wandering around outside!’\n",
      "‘Master Bao gave orders yesterday that the flowers were only to be watered every\n",
      "\f",
      "other day,’ said Crimson. ‘I fed the birds when you were still fast asleep in bed.’\n",
      "‘What about the stove?’ said Emerald.\n",
      "‘It isn’t my day for the stove,’ said Crimson. ‘The tea-water today has nothing to do\n",
      "with me.’\n",
      "‘Listen to Miss Pert!’ said Mackerel. ‘I wouldn’t bother about her, if I were you —\n",
      "just leave her to wander about as she pleases.’\n",
      "‘I’m not “wandering about”, if you really want to know,’ said Crimson. ‘If you really\n",
      "want to know, Mrs Lian sent me outside to take a message and to fetch something\n",
      "for her.’\n",
      "She held up the purse for them to see; at which they were silent. But when they had\n",
      "passed each other, Skybright laughed sneeringly:\n",
      "‘You can see why she’s so uppity. She’s on the climb again. Look at her — all\n",
      "cock-a-hoop because someone’s given her a little message to carry! And she probably\n",
      "doesn’t even know who it’s about. Well, one little message isn’t going to get her very\n",
      "far. It’s what happens in the long run that counts. Now if she were clever enough to\n",
      "climb her way right out of this Garden and stay there, that would be really\n",
      "something!’\n",
      "These words were spoken for Crimson to hear, but in such a way that she was unable\n",
      "to answer them. She had to swallow her anger and hurry on to look for Xi-feng.\n",
      "Xi-feng was in Li Wan’s room, as Tan-chun had predicted, and Crimson found the two\n",
      "of them in conversation. She went up to Xi-feng and delivered her message:\n",
      "‘Patience says that she found the silver just after you had gone and took care of it;\n",
      "and she says that when Zhang Cai’s wife came for it she did weigh it out in front of\n",
      "her before giving it to her to take away.’\n",
      "Crimson now produced the purse and handed it to Xi-feng.\n",
      "Then she added:\n",
      "‘Patience told me to tell you that Brightie has just been in to inquire what your\n",
      "instructions were for his visit, and she said that she gave him a message to take\n",
      "based on the things she thought you would want him to say.’\n",
      "‘Oh?’ said Xi-feng, amused. ‘And what was this message “based on the things she\n",
      "thought I would want him to say”?’\n",
      "‘She said he was to tell them: “Our lady hopes your lady is well and she says that\n",
      "the Master is away at present and may not be back for another day or two, but your\n",
      "lady is not to worry; and when the lady from West Lane is better, our lady will come\n",
      "with their lady to see your lady. And our lady says that the lady from West Lane sent\n",
      "someone the other day with a message from the elder Lady Wang saying that she\n",
      "hopes our lady is well and will she please see if our Lady Wang can let her have a few\n",
      "of her Golden Myriad Macrobiotic Pills; and if she can, will our lady please send\n",
      "\f",
      "someone with them to her, because someone will be going from there to the elder\n",
      "Lady Wang’s in a few days’ time and they will be able to take them for her — ”’\n",
      "Crimson was still in full spate when Li Wan interrupted her with a laugh:\n",
      "‘What an extraordinary number of “ladies”! I hope you can understand what it’s all\n",
      "about, Feng. I’m sure I can’t!’\n",
      "‘I’m not surprised,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There are four or five different households\n",
      "involved in that message.’ She smiled graciously at Crimson. ‘You’re a clever girl, my\n",
      "dear, to have got it all right — not like the simpering little ninnies I usually have to\n",
      "put up with. You have no idea, cousin,’ she said, turn?ing to Li Wan again. ‘Apart from\n",
      "the one or two girls and one or two older women that I always keep about me, I just\n",
      "dread talking to servants nowadays. They take such an inter?minable time to tell you\n",
      "anything — so long-winded! And the airs and graces they give themselves! and the\n",
      "simpering! and the urn-ing and ah-ing! If they only knew how it makes me fume! Our\n",
      "Patience used to be like that when she first came to me. I used to say to her, “Do you\n",
      "think it makes you seem glamorous, all that affected humming? — like a little gnat!” I\n",
      "had to talk to her several times about it before she would mend her ways.’\n",
      "Li Wan laughed.\n",
      "‘I suppose if they were all peppercorns like you, it would be all right.’\n",
      "‘This girl’s all right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Those two messages she gave me just now may\n",
      "not have been very long ones, but you could see how clear-cut her delivery of them\n",
      "was.’\n",
      "She smiled at Crimson again.\n",
      "‘How would you like to come and work for me and be my god-daughter? With a\n",
      "little grooming from me you could go far.’\n",
      "Crimson suppressed a giggle.\n",
      "‘Why do you laugh?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I suppose you think I’m too young to be your\n",
      "god-mother. You’re very silly if you think that. You just ask around a bit: there are\n",
      "plenty much older than you who’d give their ears to be my god-daughter. What I’m\n",
      "offering you is a very special favour.’\n",
      "Crimson smiled.\n",
      "‘I wasn’t laughing because of that, madam. I was laughing because you had got the\n",
      "generation wrong. My mother is your god-daughter already. If you made me your\n",
      "god-daughter too, I should be my own mother’s sister!’\n",
      "‘Who is your mother?’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Do you mean to say that you don’t know who this girl is that you’ve been talking to\n",
      "all this time?’ said Li Wan. ‘This is Lin Zhi-xiao’s daughter.’\n",
      "Xi-feng registered surprise:\n",
      "‘You mean to tell me that this is the Lins’ daughter?’ She laughed. ‘That couple of\n",
      "\f",
      "old sticks? I can never get a peep out of either of them. I’ve always maintained that\n",
      "Lin Zhi-xiao and his wife were the perfect match: one hears nothing and the other\n",
      "says nothing. Well! To think they should have produced a bright little thing like this\n",
      "between them! — How old are you?’ she asked Crimson.\n",
      "‘Sixteen.’\n",
      "‘And what’s your name?’\n",
      "‘“Crimson”, madam. I used to be called “Jade”, but they made me change it on\n",
      "account of Master Bao.’\n",
      "Xi-feng looked away with a frown of displeasure.\n",
      "‘I should think so too,’ she muttered. ‘Odious people! One can hear them saying it:\n",
      "“We’ve got a ‘Jade’ in our family the same as you”, or some such impertinence.’\n",
      "She turned to Li Wan again:\n",
      "‘I don’t think you know, Wan, but I told this girl’s mother that as Lai Da’s wife is so\n",
      "busy nowadays that she doesn’t even know who half the girls in the household are\n",
      "any longer, I wanted her to pick out a couple of likely-looking girls to work under me.\n",
      "Now she promised that she would do this; but you see, not only has she not done so,\n",
      "but she’s actually gone and sent her own daughter to work for someone else. Do you\n",
      "suppose she really thinks her girl would have had such a ter?rible time with me?’\n",
      "‘Don’t be so touchy,’ said Li Wan. ‘Her mother is not to blame. The girl had already\n",
      "started service in the Garden before you ever spoke to her about it.’\n",
      "‘Oh well, in that case,’ said Xi-feng, recovering her good humour, ‘I’ll have a word\n",
      "with Bao-yu about it tomorrow. I’ll tell him to find someone else and let me have this\n",
      "girl to work under me. Still — ’ she turned to Crimson, ‘perhaps we ought to ask the\n",
      "party most concerned if she is willing.’\n",
      "Crimson smiled.\n",
      "‘As to being willing or not, madam, I don’t think it’s my place to say. But I do know\n",
      "this: that if I was to work for you, I should get to know what’s what and all the inside\n",
      "and out?side of household management. I’m sure it would be wonder?ful\n",
      "experience.’\n",
      "Just then a maid arrived from Lady Wang’s asking for Xi?-feng, who promptly excused\n",
      "herself to Li Wan and left. Crimson returned to Green Delights — where our story\n",
      "now leaves her.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "We now return to Dai-yu, who, having slept so little the night before, was very late\n",
      "getting up on the morning of the festival. Hearing that the other girls were all out in\n",
      "the garden ‘speeding the fairies’ and fearing to be teased by them for her lazy habits,\n",
      "\f",
      "she hurried over her toilet and went out as soon as it was completed. A smiling\n",
      "Bao-yu appeared in the gateway as she was stepping down into the courtyard.\n",
      "‘Well, coz,’ he said, ‘I hope you didn’t tell on me yesterday. You had me worrying\n",
      "about it all last night.’\n",
      "Dai-yu turned back, ignoring him, to address Nightingale inside:\n",
      "‘When you do the room, leave one of the casements open so that the parent\n",
      "swallows can get in. And put the lion door?stop on the bottom of the blind to stop it\n",
      "flapping. And don’t forget to put the cover back on the burner after you’ve lighted\n",
      "the incense.’\n",
      "She made her way across the courtyard, still ignoring him. Bao-yu, who knew nothing\n",
      "of the little drama that had taken place outside his gate the night before, assumed\n",
      "that she was still angry about his unfortunate lapse earlier on that same day, when\n",
      "he had offended her susceptibilities with a some?what risqué quotation from The\n",
      "Western Chamber. He offered her now, with energetic bowing and hand-pumping,\n",
      "the apologies that the previous day’s emergency had caused him to neglect. But\n",
      "Dai-yu walked straight past him and out of the gate, not deigning so much as a glance\n",
      "in his direction, and stalked off in search of the others.\n",
      "Bao-yu was nonplussed. He began to suspect that something more than he had first\n",
      "imagined must be wrong.\n",
      "‘Surely it can’t only be because of yesterday lunchtime that she’s carrying on in this\n",
      "fashion? There must be something else. On the other hand, I didn’t get back until\n",
      "late and I didn’t see her again last night, so how could I have offended her?’\n",
      "Preoccupied with these reflections, he followed her at some distance behind.\n",
      "Not far ahead Bao-chai and Tan-chun were watching the ungainly courtship dance of\n",
      "some storks. When they saw Dai?-yu coming, they invited her to join them, and the\n",
      "three girls stood together and chatted. Then Bao-yu arrived. Tan-chun greeted him\n",
      "with sisterly concern:\n",
      "‘How have you been keeping, Bao? It’s three whole days since I saw you last.’\n",
      "Bao-yu smiled back at her.\n",
      "‘How have you been keeping, sis? I was asking Cousin Wan about you the day\n",
      "before yesterday.’\n",
      "‘Come over here a minute,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I want to talk to you.’\n",
      "He followed her into the shade of a pomegranate tree a little way apart from the\n",
      "other two.\n",
      "‘Has Father asked to see you at all during this last day or two?’ Tan-chun began.\n",
      "‘No.’\n",
      "‘I thought I heard someone say yesterday that he had been asking for you.’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Bao-yu, smiling at her concern. ‘Whoever it was was mistaken. He\n",
      "\f",
      "certainly hasn’t asked for me.’\n",
      "Tan-chun smiled and changed the subject.\n",
      "‘During the past few months,’ she said, ‘I’ve managed to save up another ten\n",
      "strings or so of cash. I’d like you to take it again like you did last time, and next time\n",
      "you go out, if you see a nice painting or calligraphic scroll or some amusing little\n",
      "thing that would do for my room, I’d like you to buy it for me.’\n",
      "‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘In the trips I make to bazaars and temple fairs,\n",
      "whether it’s inside the city or round about, I can’t say that I ever see anything really\n",
      "nice or out of the ordinary. It’s all bronzes and jades and porcelain and that sort of\n",
      "stuff. Apart from that it’s mostly dress-making materials and clothes and things to\n",
      "eat.’\n",
      "‘Now what would I want things like that for?’ said Tan?-chun. ‘No, I mean\n",
      "something like that little wickerwork basket you bought me last time, or the little box\n",
      "carved out of bamboo root, or the little clay burner. I thought they were sweet.\n",
      "Unfortunately the others took such a fancy to them that they carried them off as loot\n",
      "and wouldn’t give them back to me again.’\n",
      "‘Oh, if those are the sort of things you want,’ said Bao-yu laughing, ‘it’s very simple.\n",
      "Just give a few strings of cash to one of the boys and he’ll bring you back a whole\n",
      "cartload of them.’\n",
      "‘What do the boys know about it?’ said Tan-chun. ‘I need someone who can pick\n",
      "out the interesting things and the ones that are in good taste. You get me lots of nice\n",
      "little things, and I’ll embroider a pair of slippers for you like the ones I made for you\n",
      "last time — only this time I’ll do them more carefully.’\n",
      "‘Talking of those slippers reminds me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I happened to run into Father\n",
      "once when I was wearing them. He was Most Displeased. When he asked me who\n",
      "made them, I naturally didn’t dare to tell him that you had, so I said that Aunt Wang\n",
      "had given them to me as a birthday present a few days before. There wasn’t much he\n",
      "could do about it when he heard that they came from Aunt Wang; so after a very\n",
      "long pause he just said, “What a pointless waste of human effort and valuable\n",
      "material, to produce things like that!” I told this to Aroma when I got back, and she\n",
      "said, “Oh, that’s nothing! You should have heard your Aunt Zhao complaining about\n",
      "those slippers. She was furious when she heard about them:\n",
      "‘Her own natural brother so down at heel he scarcely dares show his face to people,\n",
      "and she spends her time making things like that!’”’\n",
      "Tan-chun’s smile had vanished:\n",
      "‘How can she talk such nonsense? Why should I be the one to make shoes for him?\n",
      "Huan gets a clothing allowance, doesn’t he? He gets his clothing and footwear\n",
      "provided for the same as all the test of us. And fancy saying a thing like that in front\n",
      "\f",
      "of a roomful of servants! For whose benefit was this remark made, I wonder? I make\n",
      "an occasional pair of slippers just for something to do in my spare time; and if I give a\n",
      "pair to someone I particularly like, that’s my own affair. Surely no one else has any\n",
      "business to start telling me who I should give them to? Oh, she’s so petty!’\n",
      "Bao-yu shook his head:\n",
      "‘Perhaps you’re being a bit hard on her. She’s probably got her reasons.’\n",
      "This made Tan-chun really angry. Her chin went up de?fiantly:\n",
      "‘Now you’re being as stupid as her. Of course she’s got her reasons; but they are\n",
      "ignorant, stupid reasons. But she can think what she likes: as far as I am concerned,\n",
      "Sir Jia is my father and Lady Wang is my mother, and who was born in whose room\n",
      "doesn’t interest me — the way I choose my friends inside the family has nothing to\n",
      "do with that. Oh, I know I shouldn’t talk about her like this; but she is so idiotic about\n",
      "these things. As a matter of fact I can give you an even better example than your\n",
      "story of the slippers. That last time I gave you my savings to get something for me,\n",
      "she saw me a few days afterwards and started telling me how short of money she\n",
      "was and how difficult things were for her. I took no notice, of course. But later, when\n",
      "the maids were out of the room, she began attacking me for giving the money I’d\n",
      "saved to other people instead of giving it to Huan. Really! I didn’t know whether to\n",
      "laugh or get angry with her. In the end I just walked out of the room and went round\n",
      "to see Mother.’\n",
      "There was an amused interruption at this point from Bao-chai, who was still standing\n",
      "where they had left her a few minutes before:\n",
      "‘Do finish your talking and come back soon! It’s easy to see that you two are\n",
      "brother and sister. As soon as you see each other, you get into a huddle and start\n",
      "talking about family secrets. Would it really be such a disaster if anything you are\n",
      "saying were to be overheard?’\n",
      "Tan-chun and Bao-yu rejoined her, laughing.\n",
      "Not seeing Dai-yu, Bao-yu realized that she must have slipped off elsewhere while be\n",
      "was talking.\n",
      "‘Better leave it a day or two,’ he told himself on reflection. ‘Wait until her anger has\n",
      "calmed down a bit.’\n",
      "While he was looking downwards and meditating, he noticed that the ground where\n",
      "they were standing was car?peted with a bright profusion of wind-blown flowers —\n",
      "pome?granate and balsam for the most part.\n",
      "‘You can see she’s upset,’ he thought ruefully. ‘She’s neg?lecting her flowers. I’ll\n",
      "bury this lot for her and remind her about it next time I see her.’\n",
      "He became aware that Bao-chai was arranging for him and Tan-chun to go with her\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I’ll join you two presently,’ he said, and waited until they were a little way off\n",
      "before stooping down to gather the fallen blossoms into the skirt of his gown. It was\n",
      "quite a way from where he was to the place where Dai-yu had buried the\n",
      "peach-blossom on that previous occasion, but he made his way towards it, over rocks\n",
      "and bridges and through plantations of trees and flowers. When he had almost\n",
      "reached his destination and there was only the spur of a miniature ‘mountain’\n",
      "be?tween him and the burial-place of the flowers, he heard the sound of a voice,\n",
      "coming from the other side of the rock, whose continuous, gentle chiding was\n",
      "occasionally broken by the most pitiable and heart-rending sobs.\n",
      "‘It must be a maid from one of the apartments,’ thought Bao-yu. ‘Someone has\n",
      "been ill-treating her, and she has run here to cry on her own.’\n",
      "He stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying. She\n",
      "appeared to be reciting something:\n",
      "\n",
      "The blossoms fade and falling fill the air,\n",
      "Of fragrance and bright hues bereft and bare.\n",
      "Floss drifts and flutters round the Maiden’s bower,\n",
      "Or softly strikes against her curtained door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Maid, grieved by these signs of spring’s decease,\n",
      "Seeking some means her sorrow to express,\n",
      "Has rake in hand into the garden gone,\n",
      "Before the fallen flowers are trampled on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elm-pods and willow-floss are fragrant too;\n",

      "          Flowers in my eyes and bird-song in my ears\n",

      "she must have seen him and have gone away in order to avoid him. Feeling suddenly\n",
      "rather foolish, he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes. Then he\n",
      "descended from the rockery and began to retrace his steps in the direction of Green\n",
      "Delights. Quite by coincidence Dai-yu was walking along the same path a little way\n",
      "ahead.\n",
      "‘Stop a minute!’ he cried, hurrying forward to catch up with her. ‘I know you are\n",
      "\f",
      "not taking any notice of me, but I only want to ask you one simple question, and then\n",
      "you need never have anything more to do with me.’\n",
      "Dai-yu had turned back to see who it was. When she saw that it was Bao-yu still, she\n",
      "was going to ignore him again; but hearing him say that he only wanted to ask her\n",
      "one ques?tion, she told him that he might do so.\n",
      "Bao-yu could not resist teasing her a little.\n",
      "‘How about two questions? Would you wait for two?’\n",
      "Dai-yu set her face forwards and began walking on again.\n",
      "Bao-yu sighed.\n",
      "‘If it has to be like this now,’ he said, as if to himself; ‘it’s a pity it was ever like it\n",
      "was in the beginning.’\n",
      "Dai-yu’s curiosity got the better of her. She stopped walk?ing and turned once more\n",
      "towards him.\n",
      "‘Like what in the beginning?’ she asked. ‘And like what now?’\n",
      "‘Oh, the beginning!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In the beginning, when you first came here, I was\n",
      "your faithful companion in all your games. Anything I had, even the thing most dear\n",
      "to me, was yours for the asking. If there was something to eat that I specially liked, I\n",
      "had only to hear that you were fond of it too and I would religiously hoard it away to\n",
      "share with you when you got back, not daring even to touch it until you came. We\n",
      "ate at the same table. We slept in the same bed. I used to think that because we\n",
      "were so close then, there would be something special about our relationship when\n",
      "we grew up — that even if we weren’t particularly affectionate, we should at least\n",
      "have more understanding and forbearance for each other than the rest. But how\n",
      "wrong I was! Now that you have grown up, you seem only to have grown more\n",
      "touchy. You don’t seem to care about me any more at all. You spend all your time\n",
      "brood?ing about outsiders like Peng and Chai. I haven’t got any real brothers and\n",
      "sisters left here now. There are Huan and Tan, of course; but as you know, they’re\n",
      "only my half-brother and half-sister: they aren’t my mother’s children. I’m on my own,\n",
      "like you. I should have thought we had so much in common - But what’s the use? I try\n",
      "and try, but it gets me nowhere; and nobody knows or cares.’\n",
      "At this point — in spite of himself — he burst into tears.\n",
      "The palpable evidence of her own eyes and ears had by now wrought a considerable\n",
      "softening on Dai-yu’s heart. A sym?pathetic tear stole down her own cheek, and she\n",
      "hung her head and said nothing. Bao-yu could see that he had moved her.\n",
      "‘I know I’m not much use nowadays,’ he continued, ‘but however bad you may\n",
      "think me, I would never wittingly do anything in your presence to offend you. If I do\n",
      "ever slip up in some way, you ought to tell me off about it and warn me not to do it\n",
      "again, or shout at me — hit me, even, if you feel like it; I shouldn’t mind. But you\n",
      "\f",
      "don’t do that. You just ignore me. You leave me utterly at a loss to know what I’m\n",
      "supposed to have done wrong, so that I’m driven half frantic wondering what I ought\n",
      "to do to make up for it. If I were to die now, I should die with a grievance, and all the\n",
      "masses and exorcisms in the world wouldn’t lay my ghost. Only when you explained\n",
      "what your reason was for ignoring me should I cease from haunting you and be\n",
      "reborn into another life.’\n",
      "Dai-yu’s resentment for the gate incident had by now com?pletely evaporated. She\n",
      "merely said:\n",
      "‘Oh well, in that case why did you tell your maids not to let me in when I came to\n",
      "call on you?’\n",
      "‘I honestly don’t know what you are referring to,’ said Bao-yu in surprise. ‘Strike me\n",
      "dead if I ever did any such thing!’\n",
      "‘Hush!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Talking about death at this time of the morning! You should be\n",
      "more careful what you say. If you did, you did. If you didn’t, you didn’t. There’s no\n",
      "need for these horrible oaths.’\n",
      "‘I really and truly didn’t know you had called,’ said Bao-yu. Cousin Bao came and sat\n",
      "with me a few minutes last night and then went away again. That’s the only call I\n",
      "know about.’\n",
      "Dai-yu reflected for a moment or two, then smiled.\n",
      "‘ Yes, it must have been the maids being lazy. Certainly they can be very\n",
      "disagreeable at such times.’\n",
      "‘Yes, I’m sure that’s what it was,’ said Bao-yu. ‘When I get back, I’ll find out who it\n",
      "was and give her a good talking-to.’\n",
      "‘I think some of your young ladies could do with a good talking-to,’ said Dai-yu, ‘—\n",
      "though it’s not really for me to say so. It’s a good job it was only me they were rude\n",
      "to. If Miss Bao or Miss Cow were to call and they behaved like that to her, that would\n",
      "be really serious.’\n",
      "She giggled mischievously. Bao-yu didn’t know whether to laugh with her or grind his\n",
      "teeth. But just at that moment a maid came up to ask them both to lunch and the\n",
      "two of them went together out of the Garden and through into the front part of the\n",
      "mansion, calling in at Lady Wang’s on the way.\n",
      "‘How did you get on with that medicine of Dr Bao’s,’ Lady Wang asked Dai-yu as\n",
      "soon as she saw her, ‘— the Court Physician? Do you think you are any better for it?’\n",
      "‘It didn’t seem to make very much difference,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Grandmother has put\n",
      "me back on Dr Wang’s prescription.’\n",
      "‘Cousin Lin has got a naturally weak constitution, Mother,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She takes\n",
      "cold very easily. These strong decoc?tions are all very well provided she only takes\n",
      "one or two to dispel the cold. For regular treatment it’s probably best if she sticks to\n",
      "\f",
      "pills.’\n",
      "‘The doctor was telling me about some pills for her the other day,’ said Lady Wang,\n",
      "‘but I just can’t remember the name.’\n",
      "‘I know the names of most of those pills,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I expect he wanted her to\n",
      "take Ginseng Tonic Pills.’\n",
      "‘No, that wasn’t it,’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘Eight Gem Motherwort Pills?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Zhang’s Dextrals? Zhang’s Sinistrals? If\n",
      "it wasn’t any of them, it was probably Dr Cui’s Adenophora Kidney Pills.’\n",
      "‘No,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it was none of those. All I can remember is that there was a\n",
      "“Vajra” in it.\n",
      "Bao-yu gave a hoot and clapped his hands:\n",
      "‘I’ve never heard of “Vajra Pills”. If there are “Vajra Pills”, I suppose there must be\n",
      "“Buddha Boluses ”!’\n",
      "The others all laughed. Bao-chai looked at him mockingly. ‘I should think it was\n",
      "probably “The Deva-king Cardiac Elixir Pills”,’ she said.\n",
      "‘Yes, yes, that’s it!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Of course! How stupid of me!’\n",
      "‘No, Mother, not stupid,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s the strain. All those Vajra-kings and\n",
      "Bodhisattvas have been overworking you!’\n",
      "‘You’re a naughty boy to make fun of your poor mother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘A good\n",
      "whipping from your Pa is what you need.’\n",
      "‘Oh, Father doesn’t whip me for that sort of thing now?adays,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "Now that we know the name of the pills, we must get them to buy some for your\n",
      "Cousin Lin,’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘None of those things are any good,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You give me three hundred and\n",
      "sixty taels of silver and I’ll make up some pills for Cousin Lin that I guarantee will have\n",
      "her com?pletely cured before she has finished the first boxful.’\n",
      "‘Stuff!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Whoever heard of a medicine that cost so much?’\n",
      "‘No, honestly!’ said Bao-yu. ‘This prescription is a very unusual one with very\n",
      "special ingredients. I can’t remember all of them, but I know they include\n",
      "\n",
      "the caul of a first-born child;\n",
      "a ginseng root shaped like a man, with the leaves still on it;\n",
      "               a turtle-sized polygonum root;\n",
      "and\n",
      "     lycoperdon from the stump of a thousand-year-old pine-tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "— Actually, though, there’s nothing so very special about those ingredients. They’re\n",
      "all in the standard pharmacopoeia. For “sovereign remedies” they use ingredients\n",
      "\f",
      "that would really make you jump. I once gave the prescription for one to Cousin Xue.\n",
      "He was more than a year begging me for it before I would give it to him, and it took\n",
      "him another two or three years and nearly a thousand taels of silver to get all the\n",
      "ingredients to?gether. Ask Bao-chai if you don’t believe me, Mother.’\n",
      "‘I know nothing about it,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve never heard it mentioned. It’s no good\n",
      "telling Aunt to ask me.’\n",
      "‘You see! Bao-chai is a good girl. She doesn’t tell lies,’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "Bao-yu was standing in the middle of the floor below the kang. He clapped his hands\n",
      "at this and turned to the others appealingly.\n",
      "‘But it’s the truth I’m telling you. This is no lie.’\n",
      "As he turned, he happened to catch sight of Dai-yu, who was sitting behind Bao-chai,\n",
      "smiling mockingly and stroking her cheek with her finger — which in sign-language\n",
      "means, ‘You are a great big liar and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.’\n",
      "But Xi-feng, who happened to be in the inner room super?vising the laying of the\n",
      "table and had overheard the preceding remarks, now emerged into the outer room\n",
      "to corroborate:\n",
      "‘It’s quite true, what Bao says. I don’t think he is making it up,’ she said. ‘Not so\n",
      "long ago Cousin Xue came to me asking for some pearls, and when I asked him what\n",
      "he wanted them for, he said, “To make medicine with.” Then he started grumbling\n",
      "about the trouble he was having in getting the right ingredients and how he had half\n",
      "a mind not to make this medicine up after all. I said, “What medicine?” and he told\n",
      "me that it was a prescription that Cousin Bao had given him and reeled off a lot of\n",
      "ingredients — I can’t remember them now. “Of course,” he said, “I could easily\n",
      "enough buy a few pearls; only these have to be ones that have been worn. That’s\n",
      "why I’m asking you for them. If you haven’t got any loose ones, he said, “a few pearls\n",
      "broken off a bit of jewellery would do. I’d get you something nice to replace it with.”\n",
      "He was so insistent that in the end I had to break up two of my ornaments for him.\n",
      "Then he wanted a yard of Imperial red gauze. That was to put over the mortar to\n",
      "pound the pearls through. He said they had to be ground until they were as fine as\n",
      "flour.’\n",
      "‘You see!’ ‘You see!’ Bao-yu kept interjecting throughout this recital.\n",
      "‘Incidentally, Mother,’ he said, when it was ended, ‘even that was only a substitute.\n",
      "According to the prescription, the pearls ought really to have come from an ancient\n",
      "grave. They should really have been pearls taken from jewellery on the corpse of a\n",
      "long-buried noblewoman. But as one can’t very well go digging up graves and riding\n",
      "tombs every time one wants to make this medicine, the prescription allows pearls\n",
      "worn by the living as a second-best.’\n",
      "‘Blessed name of the Lord!’ said Lady Wang. ‘What a dread?ful idea! Even if you did\n",
      "\f",
      "get them from a grave, I can’t believe that a medicine made from pearls that had\n",
      "been come by so wickedly — desecrating people’s bones that had been lying\n",
      "peacefully in the ground all those hundreds of years — could possibly do you any\n",
      "good.’\n",
      "Bao-yu turned to Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Did you hear what Feng said?’ he asked her. ‘I hope you’re not going to say that\n",
      "she was lying.’\n",
      "Although the remark was addressed to Dai-yu, he winked at Bao-chai as he made it.\n",
      "Dai-yu clung to Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘Listen to him, Aunt!’ she wailed. ‘Bao-chai won’t be a party to his lies, but he still\n",
      "expects me to be.’\n",
      "‘Bao-yu, you are very unkind to your cousin,’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "Bao-yu only laughed.\n",
      "‘You don’t know the reason, Mother. Bao-chai didn’t know a half of what Cousin\n",
      "Xue got up to, even when she was living with her mother outside; and now that she’s\n",
      "moved into the Garden, she knows even less. When she said she didn’t know, she\n",
      "really didn’t know: she wasn’t giving me the lie. What you don’t realize is that Cousin\n",
      "Lin was all the time sitting behind her making signs to show that she didn’t believe\n",
      "me.’\n",
      "Just then a maid came from Grandmother Jia’s apartment to fetch Bao-yu and Dai-yu\n",
      "to lunch.\n",
      "Without saying a word to Bao-yu, Dai-yu got up and, tak?ing the maid’s hand, began\n",
      "to go. But the maid was reluctant.\n",
      "‘Let’s wait for Master Bao and we can go together.’\n",
      "‘He’s not eating lunch today,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Come on, let’s go!’\n",
      "‘Whether he’s eating lunch or not,’ said the maid, ‘he’d better come with us, so that\n",
      "he can explain to Her Old Lady?ship about it when she asks.’\n",
      "‘All right, you wait for him then,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m going on ahead.’\n",
      "And off she went.\n",
      "‘I think I’d rather eat with you today, Mother,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘No, no, you can’t,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Today is one of my fast-days: I shall only be\n",
      "eating vegetables. You go and have a proper meal with your Grandma.’\n",
      "‘I shall share your vegetables,’ said Bao-yu. Go on, you can go,’ he said, dismissing\n",
      "the maid; and rushing up to the table, he sat himself down at it in readiness.\n",
      "‘You others had better get on with your own lunch,’ Lady Wang said to Bao-chai\n",
      "and the girls. ‘Let him do as he likes.’\n",
      "‘You really ought to go,’ Bao-chai said to Bao-yu. ‘Whether you have lunch there or\n",
      "not, you ought to keep Cousin Lin company. She is very upset, you know. Why don’t\n",
      "\f",
      "you?’\n",
      "‘Oh, leave her alone!’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’ll be all right presently.’\n",
      "Soon they had finished eating, and Bao-yu, afraid that Grandmother Jia might be\n",
      "worrying and at the same time anxious to rejoin Dai-yu, hurriedly demanded tea to\n",
      "rinse his mouth with. Tan-chun and Xi-chun were much amused.\n",
      "‘Why are you always in such a hurry, Bao?’ they asked him. ‘Even your eating and\n",
      "drinking all seems to be done in a rush.’\n",
      "‘You should let him finish quickly, so that he can get back to his Dai-yu,’ said\n",
      "Bao-chai blandly. ‘Don’t make him waste time here with us.’\n",
      "Bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea, and made straight for the west courtyard\n",
      "where his Grandmother Jia’s apartment was. But as he was passing by the gateway of\n",
      "Xi?-feng’s courtyard, it happened that Xi-feng herself was stand?ing in her doorway\n",
      "with one foot on the threshold, grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping\n",
      "a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "‘Ah, just the person I wanted to see!’ she said, as soon as she caught sight of\n",
      "Bao-yu. ‘Come inside. I want you to write something down for me.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was obliged to follow her indoors. Xi-feng called for some paper, an inkstone\n",
      "and a brush, and at once began dictating:\n",
      "‘ Crimson lining-damask forty lengths, dragonet figured satin forty lengths,\n",
      "miscellaneous\n",
      "Imperial gauze one hundred lengths, gold necklets four, —’\n",
      "‘Here, what is this?’ said Bao-yu. ‘It isn’t an invoice and it isn’t a presentation list.\n",
      "How am I supposed to write it?’\n",
      "‘Never you mind about that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘As long as I know what it is, that’s all\n",
      "that matters. Just put it down any?how.’\n",
      "Bao-yu wrote down the four items. As soon as he had done so, Xi-feng took up the\n",
      "paper and folded it away.\n",
      "‘Now,’ she said, smiling pleasantly, ‘there’s something I want to talk to you about. I\n",
      "don’t know whether you’ll agree to this or not, but there’s a girl in your room called\n",
      "“Crimson” whom I’d like to work for me. If I find you someone to re?place her with,\n",
      "will you let me have her?’\n",
      "‘There are so many girls in my room,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Please take any you have a fancy\n",
      "to. You really don’t need to ask me about it.’\n",
      "‘In that case,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll send for her straight away.’\n",
      "‘Please do,’ said Bao-yu, and started to go.\n",
      "‘Hey, come back!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t finished with you yet.’\n",
      "‘I’ve got to see Grandma now,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you’ve got anything else to say, you\n",
      "\f",
      "can tell me on my way back.’\n",
      "When he got to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, they had all just finished lunch.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia asked him if he bad had anything nice to eat with his mother.\n",
      "‘There wasn’t anything nice,’ he said. ‘But I had an extra bowl of rice.’\n",
      "Then, after the briefest pause:\n",
      "‘Where’s Cousin Lin?’\n",
      "‘In the inner room,’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "In the inner room a maid stood below the kang blowing on a flat-iron. Up on the kang\n",
      "two maids were marking some material with a chalked string, while Dai-yu, her head\n",
      "bent low over her work, was engaged in cutting something from it with her shears.\n",
      "‘What are you making?’ he asked her. ‘You’ll give yourself a headache, stooping\n",
      "down like that immediately after your lunch.’\n",
      "Dai-yu took no notice and went on cutting.\n",
      "‘That corner looks a bit creased still,’ said one of the maids. ‘it will have to be\n",
      "ironed again.’\n",
      "‘Leave it alone!’ said Dai-yu, laying down her shears. ‘It will be all right presently.’\n",
      "Bao-yu found her reply puzzling.\n",
      "Bao-chai, Tan-chun and the rest had now arrived in the outer room and were talking\n",
      "to Grandmother Jia. Presently Bao-chai drifted inside and asked Dai-yu what she was\n",
      "doing; then, when she saw that she was cutting material, she ex?claimed admiringly.\n",
      "‘What a lot of things you can do, Dai! Fancy, even dress-making now!’\n",
      "Dai-yu smiled malignantly.\n",
      "‘Oh, it’s all lies, really. I just do it to fool people.’\n",
      "‘I’ve got something to tell you that I think will amuse you, Dai,’ said Bao-chai\n",
      "pleasantly. ‘When our cousin was holding forth about that medicine just now and I\n",
      "said I didn’t know about it, I believe actually he was rather wounded.’\n",
      "‘Oh, leave him alone!’ said Dai-yu. ‘He will be all right presently.’\n",
      "‘Grandma wants someone to play dominoes with,’ said Bao-yu to Bao-chai. ‘Why\n",
      "don’t you go and play dominoes?’\n",
      "‘Oh, is that what I came for?’ said Bao-chai; but she went, notwithstanding.\n",
      "‘Why don’t you go?’ said Dai-yu. ‘There’s a tiger in this room. You might get eaten.’\n",
      "She said this still bending over her cutting, which she con?tinued to work away at\n",
      "without looking up at him.\n",
      "Finding himself once more ignored, Bao-yu nevertheless attempted to remain jovial.\n",
      "‘Why don’t you come out for a bit too? You can do this cutting later.’\n",
      "Dai-yu continued to take no notice.\n",
      "Failing to get a response from her, he tried the maids:\n",
      "‘Who told her to do this dress-making?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Whoever told her to do it,’ said Dai-yu, ‘it has nothing whatever to do with Master\n",
      "Bao.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was about to retort, but just at that moment someone came in to say that he\n",
      "was wanted outside, and he was obliged to hurry off.\n",
      "Dai-yu leaned forward and shouted after him:\n",
      "‘Holy Name! By the time you get back, I shall be dead.’\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside the gateway to the inner quartets Bao-yu found Tea-leaf waiting.\n",
      "‘Mr Feng invites you round to his house,’ said Tealeaf.\n",
      "Bao-yu realized that this must be in connection with the matter Feng Zi-ying had\n",
      "spoken of on the previous day. He told Tealeaf to send for his going-out clothes, and\n",
      "went into his outer study to wait for them.\n",
      "Tealeaf went back to the west inner gate to wait for someone who would carry a\n",
      "message inside to the maids. Presently an old woman came out:\n",
      "‘Excuse me, missus,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Master Bao is waiting in the outer study for his\n",
      "going-out clothes. Could you take a message inside to say that he wants them?’\n",
      "‘— your mother’s twat!’ said the old woman. ‘Master Bao lives in the Garden now.\n",
      "All his maids are in the Garden. What do you want to come running round here for?’\n",
      "Tealeaf laughed at his own mistake.\n",
      "‘You’re quite right. I’m going cuckoo.’\n",
      "He ran round to the gate of the Garden. As luck would have it, the boys on that gate\n",
      "were playing football in the open space below the terraced walk, and when Tealeaf\n",
      "had explained his errand, one of them ran off inside for him. He returned after a very\n",
      "long wait, carrying a large bundle, which he handed to Tealeaf, and which Tealeaf\n",
      "carried back to the outer study.\n",
      "While he was changing, Bao-yu asked for his horse to be saddled, and presently set\n",
      "off, taking only Tealeaf, Ploughboy, Two-times and Oldie as his attendants. When they\n",
      "reached Feng Zi-ying’s gate, someone ran in to announce his arrival, and Feng Zi-ying\n",
      "came out in person to greet him and led him inside to meet the company.\n",
      "This comprised Xue Pan, who had evidently been waiting there for some time, a\n",
      "number of boy singers, a female imper?sonator called Jiang Yu-han and a girl called\n",
      "Nuageuse from the Budding Grove, a high-class establishment specializing in female\n",
      "entertainers. When everyone had been introduced, tea was served.\n",
      "‘Now come on!’ said Bao-yu, as he picked up the proffered cup of tea. ‘What about\n",
      "this “lucky accident” you mentioned yesterday? I’ve been waiting anxiously to hear\n",
      "about it ever since I saw you. That’s why I came so promptly when I got your\n",
      "\f",
      "invitation.’\n",
      "Feng Zi-ying laughed.\n",
      "‘You and your cousin are such simple souls — I find it rahver touchin’! Afraid it was\n",
      "pure invention, what I said yesterday. I said it to make you come, because I fought\n",
      "that if I asked you outright to come and drink wiv me, you’d make excuses. Anyway, it\n",
      "worked.’\n",
      "The company joined in his merriment.\n",
      "Wine was now brought in and everyone sat down in the places assigned to them.\n",
      "Feng Zi-ying first got one of the singing-boys to pour for them; then he called on\n",
      "Nuageuse to drink with each of the guests in turn.\n",
      "Xue Pan, by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him, was already\n",
      "beginning to be obstreperous. He seized Nuageuse by the hand and drew her\n",
      "towards him:\n",
      "‘If you’d sing me a nice new song - one of your specials, I’d drink a whole jarful for\n",
      "you. How about it, eh?’\n",
      "Nuageuse had to oblige him by taking up her lute and sing?ing the following song for\n",
      "him to her own accompaniment:\n",
      "\n",
      "              Two lovely boys\n",
      "              Are both in love with me\n",
      "And I can’t get either from my mind.\n",
      "Both are so beautiful\n",
      "So wonderful\n",
      "So marvellous\n",
      "To give up either one would be unkind.\n",
      "Last night I promised I would go\n",
      "To meet one of them in the garden where the roses grow;\n",
      "The other came to see what he could find.\n",
      "And now that we three are all\n",
      "Here in this tribunal,\n",
      "    There are no words that come into my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There you are!’ she said. ‘Now drink your jarful!’\n",
      "‘That one’s not worth a jarful,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Sing us a better one.’\n",
      "‘Now just a minute,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just guzzling like this will make us drunk in no\n",
      "time without giving us any real enjoyment. I’ve got a good new drinking-game for\n",
      "you. Let me first drink the M.C.’s starting-cup, and I’ll tell you the rules. After that,\n",
      "anyone who doesn’t toe the line will be made to drink ten Sconce-cups straight off as\n",
      "\f",
      "a forfeit, give up his seat at the party, and spend the rest of the time pouring out\n",
      "drinks for the rest of us.’\n",
      "Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han agreed enthusiastically, and Bao-yu picked up one of\n",
      "the extra large cups that had now been provided and drained its contents at a single\n",
      "draught.\n",
      "‘Now,’ he said. ‘We’re going to take four words — let’s say “upset”, “glum”, “blest”\n",
      "and “content”. You have to begin by saying “The girl is —”, and then you say one of\n",
      "the four words. That’s your first line. The next line has to rhyme with the first line and\n",
      "it has to give the reason why the girl is whatever it says — “upset or glum” or “blest”\n",
      "or content. When you’ve done all four, you’re entitled to drink the wine in front of\n",
      "you. Only, before drinking it, you’ve first got to sing some new popular song; and\n",
      "after you’ve drunk it, you’ve got to choose some animal or vegetable object from the\n",
      "things in front of us and recite a line from a well-known poem, or an old couplet, or a\n",
      "quotation from the classics—’\n",
      "Before he could finish, Xue Pan was on his feet, protesting vigorously:\n",
      "‘You can count me out of this. I’m taking no part in this. This is just to make a fool of\n",
      "me, isn’t it?’\n",
      "Nuageuse, too, stood up and attempted to push him back into his seat:\n",
      "‘What are you so afraid of, a practiced drinker like you? You can’t be any worse at\n",
      "this sort of thing than I am, and I’m going to have a go when my turn comes. If you\n",
      "do it all right, you’ve got nothing to worry about, and even if you can’t, you’ll only be\n",
      "made to drink a few cups of wine; whereas if you refuse to follow the rules at the\n",
      "very outset, you’ll have to drink ten sconces straight off in a row and then be thrown\n",
      "out of the party and made to pour drinks for the rest of us.’\n",
      "‘Bravo!’ cried the others, clapping; and Xue Pan, seeing them united against him,\n",
      "subsided.\n",
      "Bao-yu now began his own turn:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ‘The girl’s upset:\n",
      "              The years pass by, but no one’s claimed her yet.\n",
      "The girl looks glum:\n",
      "              Her true-love’s gone to follow ambition’s drum.\n",
      "    The girl feels blest:\n",
      "          The mirror shows her looks are at their best.\n",
      "    The girl’s content:\n",
      "          Long summer days in pleasant pastimes spent.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The others all applauded, except Xue Pan, who shook his head disapprovingly:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘No good, no good!’ he said. ‘Pay the forfeit.’\n",
      "‘Why, what’s wrong with it?’ they asked him.\n",
      "‘I couldn’t understand a word of it.’\n",
      "Nuageuse gave him a pinch:\n",
      "‘Keep quiet and try to think what you’re going to say,’ she advised him; ‘otherwise\n",
      "you’ll have nothing ready when your own turn comes and you’ll have to pay the\n",
      "forfeit yourself.’\n",
      "Thereupon she picked up her lute and accompanied Bao-yu as he sang the following\n",
      "song:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Still weeping tears of blood about our separation:\n",
      "Little red love-beans of my desolation.\n",
      "Still blooming flowers I see outside my window growing.\n",
      "Still awake in the dark I hear the wind a-blowing.\n",
      "Still oh still I can’t forget those old hopes and fears.\n",
      "Still can’t swallow food and drink, ’cos I’m choked with tears.\n",
      "Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me it’s not true:\n",
      "Do I look so thin and pale, do I look so blue?\n",
      "Mirror, mirror, this long night bow shall I get through?\n",
      "Oh—oh—oh!\n",
      "Blue as the mist upon the distant mountains,\n",
      "Blue as the water in the ever-flowing fountains.’\n",
      "\n",
      "General applause — except from Xue Pan, who objected that there was ‘no rhythm’.\n",
      "Bao-yu now drank his well-earned cup — the ‘pass cup’ as they call it — and, picking\n",
      "up a slice of pear from the table, concluded his turn with the following quotation:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Rain whips the pear-tree, shut fast the door.’\n",
      "Now it was Feng Zi-ying’s turn:\n",

      "The gale has turned her room into a slum.\n",
      "The girl feels blest:\n",
      "She’s got twin babies at the breast.\n",
      "The girl’s content:\n",
      "Waiting a certain pleasurable event.’\n",
      "Next, holding up his cupful of wine in readiness to drink, he sang this song:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘You’re so exciting,\n",
      "And so inviting;\n",
      "You’re my Mary Contrary;\n",
      "You’re a crazy, mad thing.\n",
      "You’re my goddess, but oh I you’re deaf to my praying:\n",
      "Why won’t you listen to what I am saying?\n",
      "If you don’t believe me, make a small investigation:\n",
      "You will soon find out the true depth of my admiration.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he drained his bumper and, picking up a piece of chicken from one of the dishes,\n",
      "ended the performance, prior to popping it into his mouth, with a line from Wen\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘From moonlit cot the cry of chanticleer.’\n",

      "‘The girl’s upset—’\n",
      "But nothing followed.\n",
      "‘All night, what’s she upset about then?’ said Feng Zi-ying with a laugh. ‘Buck up!’\n",
      "Xue Pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his\n",
      "eyes seemed about to pop out of his head. After glaring fixedly for an unconscionable\n",
      "time, he said:\n",
      "‘The girl’s upset—’\n",

      "Song. If you can’t be bothered to listen to it, you’ll have to let me off the other thing.\n",
      "I’ll agree not to sing the rest of the song on that condition.’\n",
      "‘Yes, yes, we’ll let you off,’ they said. ‘Just don’t interfere with the rest of us, that’s\n",
      "all we ask.’\n",
      "This meant that it was now Jiang Yu-han’s turn to perform. This is what he said:\n",
      "‘The girl’s upset:\n",
      "Her man’s away, she fears he will forget.\n",
      "The girl looks glum:\n",
      "So short of cash she can’t afford a crumb.\n",
      "The girl feels blest:\n",
      "Her lampwick’s got a lucky crest.\n",
      "The girl’s content:\n",
      "She’s married to a perfect gent.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he sang this song:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A mischievous bundle of charm and love,\n",
      "Or an angel come down from the skies above?\n",
      "Sweet sixteen\n",
      "And so very green,\n",
      "Yet eager to see all there is to be seen.\n",
      "Aie aie aie\n",
      "The galaxy’s high\n",
      "In the roof of the sky,\n",
      "And the drum from the tower\n",
      "Sounds the midnight hour,\n",
      "So trim the lamp, love, and come with me\n",
      "Inside the bed-curtains, and you shall see!’\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised the pass cup to his lips, but before drinking it, smiled round at his auditors\n",
      "\f",
      "and made this little speech:\n",
      "‘I’m afraid my knowledge of poetry is strictly limited. However, I happened to see a\n",
      "couplet on someone’s wall yesterday which has stuck in my mind; and as one line in it\n",
      "is about something I can see here, I shall use it to finish my turn with.’\n",
      "So saying, he drained the cup and then, picking up a spray of cassia, recited the\n",
      "following line:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The others all accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion of the performance. Not so\n",
      "Xue Pan, however, who leaped to his feet and began protesting noisily:\n",
      "‘Terrible! Pay the forfeit. Where’s the little doll? I can’t see any doll on the table.’\n",
      "‘I didn’t say anything about a doll,’ said Jiang Yu-han.\n",
      "    ‘What are you talking about?’\n",
      "‘Come on, don’t try to wriggle out of it!’ said Xue Pan. ‘Say what you said just now\n",
      "again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There you are!’ said Xue Pan.’ “Aroma”. That’s the name of a little doll. Ask him if\n",
      "you don’t believe me.’ He pointed to Bao-yu.\n",
      "Bao-yu looked embarrassed.\n",
      "‘Cousin Xue, this time I think you do have to pay the forfeit.’\n",
      "‘All right, all right!’ said Xue Pan. ‘I’ll drink.’\n",
      "And he picked up the wine in front of him and drained it at a gulp.\n",
      "Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han were still puzzled and asked him what this was all\n",
      "about. But it was Nuageuse who explained. Immediately Jiang Yu-han was on his feet\n",
      "apologiz?ing. The others reassured him.\n",
      "‘It’s not your fault. “Ignorance excuses all”,’ they said.\n",
      "Shortly after this Bao-yu had to take temporary leave of the company to ease his\n",
      "bladder and Jiang Yu-han followed him outside. As the two of them stood side by\n",
      "side under the eaves, Jiang Yu-han once more offered Bao-yu his apologies. Much\n",
      "taken with the actor’s winsome looks and gentleness of man?ner, Bao-yu impulsively\n",
      "took his hand and gave it a squeeze.\n",
      "‘Do come round to our place some time when you are free,’ he said. ‘There’s\n",
      "something I want to ask you about. You have an actor in your company called “Bijou”\n",
      "whom everyone is talking about lately. I should so much like to meet him, but so far I\n",
      "haven’t had an opportunity.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘That’s me!’ said Jiang Yu-han. “Bijou” is my stage name.’\n",
      "Bao-yu stamped with delight.\n",
      "‘But this is wonderful! I must say, you fully deserve your reputation. Oh dear! What\n",
      "am I going to do about a First Meeting present?’\n",
      "He thought for a bit, then took a fan from his sleeve and broke off its jade pendant.\n",
      "‘Here you are,’ he said, handing it to Bijou. ‘It’s not much of a present, I’m afraid,\n",
      "but it will do to remind you of our meeting.’\n",
      "Bijou smiled and accepted it ceremoniously:\n",
      "‘I have done nothing to deserve this favour. It is too great an honour. Well, thank\n",
      "you. There’s rather an unusual thing I’m wearing I put it on today for the first time, so\n",
      "it’s still fairly new: I wonder if you will allow me to give it to you as a token of my\n",
      "warm feelings towards you?’\n",
      "He opened up his gown, undid the crimson cummerbund with which his trousers\n",
      "were fastened, and handed it to Bao?-yu.\n",
      "‘It comes from the tribute sent by the Queen of the Madder Islands. It’s for wearing\n",
      "in summer. It makes you smell nice and it doesn’t show perspiration stains. I was\n",
      "given it yester?day by the Prince of Beijing, and today is the first time it s ever been\n",
      "worn. I wouldn’t give a thing like this to anyone else, but I’d like you to have it. Will\n",
      "you take your own sash off, please, so that I can put it on instead?’\n",
      "Bao-yu received the crimson cummerbund with delight and quickly took off his own\n",
      "viridian-coloured sash to give to Bijou in exchange. They had just finished fastening\n",
      "the sashes on again when Xue Pan jumped out from behind and seized hold of them\n",
      "both.\n",
      "‘What are you two up to, leaving the party and sneaking off like this?’ he said.\n",
      "‘Come on, take ‘em out again and let’s have a look!’\n",
      "It was useless for them to protest that the situation was not what he imagined. Xue\n",
      "Pan continued to force his unwelcome attentions upon them until Feng Zi-ying came\n",
      "out and rescued them. After that they returned to the party and continued drinking\n",
      "until the evening.\n",
      "Back in his own apartment in the Garden, Bao-yu took off his outer clothes and\n",
      "relaxed with a cup of tea. While he did so, Aroma noticed that the pendant of his fan\n",
      "was missing and asked him what had become of it. Bao-yu told her that it had come\n",
      "off while he was riding, and she gave the matter no more thought. But later, when he\n",
      "was going to bed, she saw the magnificent blood-red sash round his waist and began\n",
      "to put two and two together.\n",
      "‘Since you’ve got a better sash now,’ she said, ‘do you think I could have mine back,\n",
      "please?’\n",
      "Bao-yu remembered, too late, that the viridian sash had been Aroma’s and that he\n",
      "\f",
      "ought never to have given it away. He now very much regretted having done so, but\n",
      "instead of apologizing, attempted to pass it off with a laugh.\n",
      "‘I’ll get you another,’ he told her lightly.\n",
      "Aroma shook her head and sighed.\n",
      "‘I knew you still got up to these tricks,’ she said, ‘but at least you might refrain from\n",
      "giving my things to those disgusting creatures. I’m surprised you haven’t got more\n",
      "sense.’\n",
      "She was going to say more, but checked herself for fear of provoking an explosion\n",
      "while he was in his cups. And since there was nothing else she could do, she went to\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "She awoke at first daylight next morning to find Bao-yu smiling down at her:\n",
      "‘We might have been burgled last night for all you’d have known about it — Look at\n",
      "your trousers!’\n",
      "Looking down, Aroma saw the sash that Bao-yu had been wearing yesterday tied\n",
      "round her own waist, and knew that he must have exchanged it for hers during the\n",
      "night. She tore it off impatiently.\n",
      "‘I don’t want the horrible thing. The sooner you take it away the better.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was anxious that she should keep it, and after a great deal of coaxing she\n",
      "consented, very reluctantly, to tie it on again. But she took it off once and for all as\n",
      "soon as he was out of the room and threw it into an empty chest, having first found\n",
      "another one of her own to put on in its place.\n",
      "Bao-yu made no comment on the change when they were together again. He merely\n",
      "inquired whether anything had happened the day before, while he was out.\n",
      "‘Mrs Lian sent someone round to fetch Crimson,’ said Aroma. ‘She wanted to wait\n",
      "for you; but it seemed to me that it wasn’t all that important, so I took it on myself to\n",
      "send her off straight away.’\n",
      "‘Quite right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I already knew about it. There was no need to wait till I\n",
      "got back.’\n",
      "Aroma continued:\n",
      "‘Her Grace sent that Mr Xia of the Imperial Bedchamber yesterday with a hundred\n",
      "and twenty taels of silver to pay for a three-day Pro Viventibus by the Taoists of the\n",
      "Lunar Queen temple starting on the first of next month. There are to be plays\n",
      "performed as part of the Offering; and Mr Zhen and all the other gentlemen are to go\n",
      "there to burn incense. Oh, and Her Grace’s presents for the Double Fifth have\n",
      "arrived.’\n",
      "She ordered a little maid to get out Bao-yu’s share of the things sent. There were two\n",
      "Palace fans of exquisite workmanship, two strings of red musk-scented\n",
      "medicine-beads, two lengths of maidenhair chiffon and a grass-woven ‘lotus’ mat to\n",
      "\f",
      "lie on in the hot weather.\n",
      "‘Did the others all get the same?’ he asked.\n",
      "‘Her Old Ladyship’s presents were the same as yours with the addition of a\n",
      "perfume-sceptre and an agate head-rest, and Sir Zheng’s, Lady Wang’s and Mrs Xue’s\n",
      "were the same as Her Old Ladyship’s but without the head-rest; Miss Bao’s were\n",
      "exactly the same as yours; Miss Lin, Miss Ying-chun, Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xi-chun\n",
      "got only the fans and the beads; and Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian both got two lengths of\n",
      "gauze, two lengths of chiffon, two perfume sachets and two moulded\n",
      "medicine-cakes.’\n",
      "‘Funny!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I wonder why Miss Lin didn’t get the same as me and why\n",
      "only Miss Bao’s and mine were the same. There must have been some mistake,\n",
      "surely?’\n",
      "‘When they unpacked them yesterday, the separate lots were all labelled,’ said\n",
      "Aroma. ‘I don’t see how there could have been any mistake. Your share was in Her\n",
      "Old Ladyship’s room and I went round there to get it for you. Her Old Lady?ship says\n",
      "she wants you to go to Court at four o’clock tomor?row morning to give thanks.’\n",
      "‘Yes, of course,’ said Bao-yu inattentively, and gave Ripple instructions to take his\n",
      "presents round to Dai-yu:\n",
      "‘Tell Miss Lin that I got these things yesterday and that if there’s anything there she\n",
      "fancies, I should like her to keep it.’\n",
      "Ripple went off with the presents. She was back in a very short time, however.\n",
      "‘Miss Lin says she got some yesterday too, and will you please keep these for\n",
      "yourself.’\n",
      "Bao-yu told her to put them away. As soon as he had washed, he left to pay his\n",
      "morning call on Grandmother Jia; but just as he was going out he saw Dai-yu coming\n",
      "towards him and hurried forward to meet her.\n",
      "‘Why didn’t you choose anything from the things I sent you?’\n",
      "Yesterday’s resentments were now quite forgotten; today Dai-yu had fresh matter to\n",
      "occupy her mind.\n",
      "‘I’m not equal to the honour,’ she said. ‘You forget, I’m not in the gold and jade\n",
      "class like you and your Cousin Bao. I’m only a common little wall-flower!’\n",
      "The reference to gold and jade immediately aroused Bao?-yu’s suspicions.\n",
      "‘I don’t know what anyone else may have been saying on the subject,’ he said, ‘but\n",
      "if any such thought ever so much as crossed my mind, may Heaven strike me dead,\n",
      "and may I never be reborn as a human being!’\n",
      "Seeing him genuinely bewildered, Dai-yu smiled in what was meant to be a\n",
      "reassuring manner.\n",
      "‘I wish you wouldn’t make these horrible oaths. It’s so dis?agreeable. Who cares\n",
      "\f",
      "about your silly old “gold and jade”, anyway?’\n",
      "‘It’s hard to make you see what is in my heart,’ said Bao-yu. ‘One day perhaps you\n",
      "will know. But I can tell you this. My heart has room for four people only. Grannie\n",
      "and my parents are three of them and Cousin Dai is the fourth. I swear to you there\n",
      "isn’t a fifth.’\n",
      "‘There’s no need for you to swear,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I know very well that Cousin Dai has\n",
      "a place in your heart. The trouble is that as soon as Cousin Chai comes along, Cousin\n",
      "Dai gets forgotten.’\n",
      "‘You imagine these things,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It really isn’t as you say.’\n",
      "‘Yesterday when Little Miss Bao wouldn’t tell lies for you, why did you turn to me\n",
      "and expect me to? How would you like it if I did that sort of thing to you?’\n",
      "Bao-chai happened to come along while they were still talk?ing and the two of them\n",
      "moved aside to avoid her. Bao-chai saw this clearly, but pretended not to notice and\n",
      "hurried by with lowered eyes. She went and sat with Lady Wang for a while and from\n",
      "there went on to Grandmother Jia’s. Bao-yu was already at his grandmother’s when\n",
      "she got there.\n",
      "Bao-chai had on more than one occasion heard her mother telling Lady Wang and\n",
      "other people that the golden locket she wore had been given her by a monk, who\n",
      "had insisted that when she grew up the person she married must be someone who\n",
      "had ‘a jade to match the gold’. This was one of the reasons why she tended to keep\n",
      "aloof from Bao-yu. The slight embarrassment she always felt as a result of her\n",
      "mother’s chat?ter had yesterday been greatly intensified when Yuan-chun singled her\n",
      "out as the only girl to receive the same selection of presents as Bao-yu. She was\n",
      "relieved to think that Bao-yu, so wrapped up in Dai-yu that his thoughts were only of\n",
      "her, was unaware of her embarrassment.\n",
      "But now here was Bao-yu smiling at her with sudden interest.\n",
      "‘Cousin Bao, may I have a look at your medicine-beads?’\n",
      "She happened to be wearing one of the little chaplets on her left wrist and began to\n",
      "pull it off now in obedience to his re?quest. But Bao-chai was inclined to plumpness\n",
      "and perspired easily, and for a moment or two it would not come off. While she was\n",
      "struggling with it, Bao-yu had ample opportunity to observe her snow-white arm,\n",
      "and a feeling rather warmer than admiration was kindled inside him.\n",
      "‘If that arm were growing on Cousin Lin’s body,’ he specu?lated, ‘I might hope one\n",
      "day to touch it. What a pity it’s hers! Now I shall never have that good fortune.’\n",
      "Suddenly he thought of the curious coincidence of the gold and jade talismans and\n",
      "their matching inscriptions, which Dai-yu’s remark had reminded him of. He looked\n",
      "again at Bao-chai—\n",
      "\f",
      "that face like the full moon’s argent bowl;\n",
      "those eyes like sloes;\n",
      "those lips whose carmine hue no Art contrived;\n",
      "and brows by none but Nature’s pencil lined.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was beauty of quite a different order from Dai-yu’s. Fas?cinated by it, he\n",
      "continued to stare at her with a somewhat dazed expression, so that when she\n",
      "handed him the chaplet, which she had now succeeded in getting off her wrist, he\n",
      "failed to take it from her.\n",
      "Seeing that he had gone off into one of his trances, Bao-chai threw down the chaplet\n",
      "in embarrassment and turned to go. But Dai-yu was standing on the threshold, biting\n",
      "a corner of her handkerchief, convulsed with silent laughter.\n",
      "‘I thought you were so delicate,’ said Bao-chai. ‘What are you standing there in the\n",
      "draught for?’\n",
      "‘I’ve been in the room all the time,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I just this moment went to have a\n",
      "look outside because I heard the sound of something in the sky. It was a gawping\n",
      "goose.’\n",
      "‘Where?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let me have a look.’\n",
      "‘Oh,’ said Dai-yu, ‘as soon as I went outside he flew away with a whir-r-r-’\n",
      "She flicked her long handkerchief as she said this in the direction of Bao-yu’s face.\n",
      "‘Ow!’ he exclaimed — She had flicked him in the eye.\n",
      "The extent of the damage will be examined in the following chapter.\n",
      "\f",
      "CHAPTER 29\n",
      "\n",
      "In which the greatly blessed pray for yet greater blessings\n",
      "And the highly strung rise to new heights of passion\n",
      "\n",
      "WE told in the last chapter how, as Bao-yu was standing lost in one of his trances,\n",
      "Dai-yu flicked her handkerchief at him and made him jump by inadvertently catching\n",
      "him in the eye with it.\n",
      "     ‘Who did that?’ he asked.\n",
      "Dai-yu laughingly shook her head.\n",
      "‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. Bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose, and I\n",
      "accidentally flicked you while I was showing her how it went.’\n",
      "Bao-yu rubbed his eye. He appeared to be about to say something, but then thought\n",
      "better of it.\n",
      "And so the matter passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after this incident Xi-feng arrived and began talking about the arrangements\n",
      "that had been made for the purification ceremonies, due to begin on the first of next\n",
      "month at the Taoist temple of the Lunar Goddess. She invited Bao-?chai, Bao-yu and\n",
      "Dai-yu to go with her there to watch the plays.\n",
      "‘Oh no!’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s too hot. Even if they were to do something we haven’t\n",
      "\f",
      "seen before — which isn’t likely — I think I should still not want to go.’\n",
      "     ‘But it’s cool there,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There are upstairs gal?leries on all three sides\n",
      "that you can watch from in the shade. And if we go, I shall send someone a day or\n",
      "two in advance to turn the Taoists out of that part of the temple and make it nice and\n",
      "clean for us and get them to put up blinds. And I’ll ask them not to let any other\n",
      "visitors in on that day. I’ve already told Lady Wang I’m going, so if you others won’t\n",
      "come with me, I shall go by myself. I’m so bored lately. And it’s such a business when\n",
      "we put on our own plays at home, that I can never enjoy them properly.’\n",
      "‘All right then, I’ll come,’ said Grandmother Jia, who had been listening.\n",
      "‘You’ll come, Grannie? Well that’s splendid, isn’t it! That means it will be just as bad\n",
      "for me as it would be if I were watching here at home.’\n",
      "‘Now look here,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘I shan’t want you to stand and wait on me.\n",
      "Let me take the gallery facing the stage and you can have one of the side galleries all\n",
      "to yourself; then you can sit down and enjoy yourself in comfort.’\n",
      "Xi-feng was touched.\n",
      "‘Do come!’ Grandmother Jia said to Bao-chai. ‘I’ll see that your mother comes too.\n",
      "The days are so long now, and there’s nothing to do at home except go to sleep.’\n",
      "Bao-chai had to promise that she would go.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now sent someone to invite Aunt Xue. The messenger was to call in\n",
      "on the way at Lady Wang’s and ask her if the girls might go as well.\n",
      "Lady Wang had already made it clear that she would not be going herself, partly\n",
      "because she was not feeling very well, and partly because she wanted to be at home\n",
      "in case any further messages arrived from Yuan-chun; but when she learned of\n",
      "Grandmother Jia’s enthusiasm, she had word carried into the Garden that not just\n",
      "the girls but anyone else who wanted to might go along with Grandmother Jia’s party\n",
      "on the first.\n",
      "When this exciting news had been transmitted throughout the Garden, the maids\n",
      "some of whom hardly set foot outside their own courtyards from one year’s end to\n",
      "the next were all dying to go, and those whose mistresses showed a lethargic\n",
      "disinclination to accept employed a hundred different wiles to make sure that they\n",
      "did so. The result was that in the end all the Garden’s inhabitants said that they\n",
      "would be going. Grandmother Jia was quite elated and at once issued orders for the\n",
      "cleaning and preparation of the temple theatre.\n",
      "But these are details with which we need not concern our?selves.\n",
      "On the morning of the first sedans, carriages, horses and people filled all the roadway\n",
      "outside Rong-guo House. The stewards in charge knew that the occasion of this\n",
      "outing was a Pro Viventibus ordered by Her Grace the Imperial Concubine and that\n",
      "Her Old Ladyship was going in person to burn incense — quite apart from the fact\n",
      "\f",
      "that this was the first day of the month and the first day of the Summer Festival;\n",
      "con?sequently the turnout was as splendid as they could make it and far exceeded\n",
      "anything that had been seen on previous occasions.\n",
      "Presently Grandmother Jia appeared, seated, in solitary splendour, in a large\n",
      "palanquin carried by eight bearers. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Aunt Xue followed, each in a\n",
      "palanquin with four bearers. After them came Bao-chai and Dai-yu sharing a carriage\n",
      "with a splendid turquoise-coloured canopy trimmed with pearls. The carriage after\n",
      "them, in which Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat, had vermilion-painted wheels\n",
      "and was shaded with a large embroidered umbrella. After them rode Grandmother\n",
      "Jia’s maids, Faithful, Parrot, Amber and Pearl; after them Lin Dai-yu’s maids,\n",
      "Nightingale, Snowgoose and Delicate; then Bao-chai’s maids, Oriole and Apricot; then\n",
      "Ying-chun’s maids, Chess and Tangerine; then Tan-chun’s maids, Scribe and Ebony;\n",
      "then Xi-chun’s maids, Picture and Landscape; then Aunt Xue’s maids, Providence and\n",

      "Crimson, with two of Lady Wang’s maids, Golden and Suncloud, whom Xi-feng had\n",
      "agreed to take with her, in the carriage behind. In the carriage after them sat another\n",
      "couple of maids and a nurse holding Xi-feng’s little girl. Yet more carriages followed\n",
      "carrying the nannies and old women from the various apart?ments and the women\n",
      "whose duty it was to act as duennas when the ladies of the household went out of\n",
      "doors. The street was packed with carriages as far as the eye could see in either\n",
      "direction, and Grandmother Jia’s palanquin was well on the way to the temple before\n",
      "the last passengers in the rear had finished taking their places. A confused hubbub of\n",
      "laughter and chatter rose from the line of carriages while they were doing so,\n",
      "punctuated by an occasional louder and more dis?tinctly audible protest, such as:\n",
      "‘I’m not sitting next to you!’\n",
      "or,\n",
      "‘You’re squashing the Mistress’s bundle!’\n",
      "or,\n",
      "‘Look, you’ve trodden on my spray!’\n",
      "or,\n",
      "‘You’ve ruined my fan, clumsy!’\n",
      "Zhou Rui’s wife walked up and down calling for some order:\n",
      "‘Girls! Girls! You’re out in the street now, where people can see you. A little\n",
      "behaviour, please!’\n",
      "She had to do this several times before the clamour sub?sided somewhat.\n",
      "The footmen and insignia-bearers at the front of the proces?sion had now reached\n",
      "the temple, and as the files of their column opened out to range themselves on\n",
      "\f",
      "either side of the gateway, the onlookers lining the sides of the street were able to\n",
      "see Bao-yu on a splendidly caparisoned white horse riding at the head of the\n",
      "procession immediately in front of his grandmother’s great palanquin with its eight\n",
      "bearers. As Grandmother Jia and her party approached the temple, there was a crash\n",
      "of drums and cymbals from the roadside. It was the Taoists of the temple come out\n",
      "to welcome them, with old Abbot Zhang at their head, resplendent in cope and\n",
      "vestments and with a burning joss-stick in his hand.\n",
      "The palanquin passed through the gateway and into the first courtyard. From her\n",
      "seat inside it Grandmother Jia could see the terrifying painted images of the temple\n",
      "guardians, one on each side of the inner gate, flanked by that equally ferocious pair,\n",
      "Thousand League Eye with his blue face and Favourable Wind Ear with his green one,\n",
      "and farther on, the benigner forms of the City God and the little Local Gods. She\n",
      "ordered the bearers to halt, and Cousin Zhen at the head of the younger male\n",
      "members of the clan came forward from the inner court?yard to meet her.\n",
      "Xi-feng, whose palanquin was nearest to Grandmother Jia’s, realized that Faithful and\n",
      "the other maids were too far back in the procession to be able to reach the old lady\n",
      "in time to help her out, and hurried forward to perform this service herself.\n",
      "Unfortunately a little eleven- or twelve-year-old acolyte, who had been going round\n",
      "with a pair of snuffers trimming the wicks of the numerous candles that were burning\n",
      "everywhere and whom the arrival of the procession had caught unawares, chose this\n",
      "very moment to attempt a getaway and ran head-on into her. Out flew Xi-feng’s hand\n",
      "and dealt him a resounding smack on the face that sent him flying.\n",
      "‘Clumsy brat!’ she shouted. ‘Look where you’re going!’\n",
      "The little acolyte picked himself up and, leaving his snuffers where they had fallen,\n",
      "darted off in the direction of the gate. But by now Bao-chai and the other young\n",
      "ladies were getting down from their carriages and a phalanx of women-servants\n",
      "clustered all round them, making egress impossible. Seeing a little Taoist running\n",
      "towards them, the women began to scream and shout:\n",
      "‘Catch him! Catch him! Hit him! Hit him!’\n",
      "‘What is it?’ asked Grandmother Jia in alarm, hearing this hubbub behind her, and\n",
      "Cousin Zhen went forward to inves?tigate.\n",
      "‘It’s one of the young acolytes,’ said Xi-feng as she helped the old lady from her\n",
      "conveyance. ‘He was snuffing the candles and didn’t get away in time and now he’s\n",
      "rushing around trying to find a way out.’\n",
      "‘Bring him to me, poor little thing!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And don’t frighten him.\n",
      "These children from poorer families have generally been rather spoiled. You can’t\n",
      "expect them to stand up to great occasions like this. It would be a shame to frighten\n",
      "the poor little thing out of his wits. Think how upset his mother and father would be.\n",
      "\f",
      "Go on!’ she said to Cousin Zhen. ‘Go and fetch him yourself.’\n",
      "Cousin Zhen was obliged to retrieve the little Taoist in per?son and led him by the\n",
      "hand to Grandmother Jia. The boy knelt down in front of her, the snuffers — now\n",
      "restored to him – clutched in one hand, trembling like a leaf. Grandmother Jia asked\n",
      "Cousin Zhen to raise him to his feet.\n",
      "‘Don’t be afraid,’ she told the boy. ‘How old are you?’\n",
      "But the little boy’s mouth was hurting him too badly to speak.\n",
      "‘Poor little thing!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You’d better take him away, Zhen. Give\n",
      "him some money to buy sweeties with and tell the others that they are not to\n",
      "grumble at him.’\n",
      "Cousin Zhen had to promise, and led the boy away, while the old lady led her party\n",
      "inside to begin a systematic tour of the shrines.\n",
      "The pages in the outer courtyard, who had a moment before witnessed Grandmother\n",
      "Jia and her train trooping through the gateway that led into the inner courtyard,\n",
      "were surprised to see Cousin Zhen now emerging from it again with a little Taoist in\n",
      "tow. They heard him say that the boy was to be taken out and given a few hundred\n",
      "cash and that he was to be treated kindly. A few of them came forward and led the\n",
      "child away in obedience to his instructions.\n",
      "Still standing at the top of the steps to the inner gate, Cousin Zhen inquired what had\n",
      "become of the stewards.\n",
      "‘Steward! Steward!’ shouted the pages in unison, and al?most immediately Lin\n",
      "Zhi-xiao came running out from heaven knows where, adjusting his hat with one\n",
      "hand as he ran.\n",
      "‘This is a big place,’ said Cousin Zhen when Lin Zhi-xiao was standing in front of him,\n",
      "‘and we weren’t expecting so many here today. I want you to take all the people you\n",
      "need and stay here in this courtyard with them. Those you don’t need here can wait\n",
      "in the second courtyard. And pick some reliable boys to go on this gate and the two\n",
      "posterns to pass word through to those outside if those inside need anything. Do you\n",
      "understand? All the ladies are here today and I don’t want any outsiders to get in. Is\n",
      "that understood?’\n",
      "‘Yes sir!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘Sir!’\n",
      "‘Well get on with it!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Where’s Rong got to?’\n",
      "The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Jia Rong came bounding out of the\n",
      "bell-tower, buttoning his jacket as he ran.\n",
      "‘Look at him!’ said Cousin Zhen irately. ‘Enjoying him-self in the cool while I am\n",
      "roasting down here! Spit at him, someone.’\n",
      "Long familiarity with Cousin Zhen’s temper had taught the boys that he would brook\n",
      "no opposition when roused. One of them obediently stepped forward and spat in Jia\n",
      "\f",
      "Rong’s face; then, as Cousin. Zhen continued to glare at him, he rebuked Jia Rong for\n",
      "presuming to be cool while his father was still sweating outside in the sun. Jia Rong\n",
      "was obliged to stand with his arms hanging submissively at his sides through?out this\n",
      "public humiliation, not daring to utter a word.\n",
      "The other members of Jia Rong’s generation who were present — Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia\n",
      "Qin and the rest — were greatly alarmed by this outburst; indeed, even the clansmen\n",
      "of Cousin Zhen’s own generation — the Jia Bins and Jia Huangs and Jia Qiongs —\n",
      "were to be seen putting their hats on and slinking out, one by one, from the shadow\n",
      "of the walls.\n",
      "‘What are you standing here for?’ said Cousin Zhen to Jia Rong. ‘Why don’t you get\n",
      "on your horse and go back home and tell your mother and that new wife of yours\n",
      "that Her Old Ladyship is here with all the Rong-guo girls. Tell them they must come\n",
      "here at once to wait on her.’\n",
      "Jia Rong ran outside and began bawling impatiently for his horse. ‘What on earth can\n",
      "have got into him that he should suddenly have picked on me like that?’ he muttered\n",
      "to him?self resentfully; then, as his horse had still not arrived, he shouted angrily at\n",
      "the grooms:\n",
      "‘Come on, bring that horse, damn you! Are your hands tied or something?’\n",
      "He would have liked to send a boy in his place, but was afraid that if he did, his father\n",
      "would find out when he went back later to report; and so, when the horse arrived, he\n",
      "mounted and rode off home.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen was about to turn and go in again when he discovered old Abbot Zhang\n",
      "at his elbow, smiling somewhat unnaturally.\n",
      "‘Perhaps I don’t come in quite the same category as the others,’ said the old Taoist.\n",
      "‘Perhaps I should be allowed in?side to wait on Her Old Ladyship. However. In this\n",
      "inclement heat, and with so many young ladies about, I shouldn’t like to presume. I\n",
      "will do whatever you say. I did just wonder whether Her Old Ladyship might ask for\n",
      "me, or whether she might require a guide to take her round the shrines…How?ever.\n",
      "Perhaps it would be best if I waited here.’\n",
      "Cousin Zhen was aware that, though Abbot Zhang had started life a poor boy and\n",
      "entered the Taoist church as ‘proxy novice of Grandmother Jia’s late husband, a\n",
      "former Emperor had with his own Imperial lips conferred on him the title ‘Doctor\n",
      "Mysticus’, and he now held the seals of the Board of Commissioners of the Taoist\n",
      "Church, had been awarded the title ‘Doctor Serenissimus’ by the reigning sovereign,\n",
      "and was addressed as ‘Holiness’ by princes, dukes and governors of provinces. He\n",
      "was therefore not a man to be trifled with. Moreover he was constantly in and out of\n",
      "the two mansions and on familiar terms with most of the Jia ladies. Cousin Zhen at\n",
      "once became affable.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Oh, you’re one of the family, Papa Zhang, so let’s have no more of that kind of talk,\n",
      "or I’ll take you by that old beard of yours and give it a good pull. Come on, follow\n",
      "me!’\n",
      "Abbot Zhang followed him inside, laughing delightedly.\n",
      "Having found Grandmother Jia, Cousin Zhen ducked and smiled deferentially.\n",
      "‘Papa Zhang has come to pay his respects, Grannie.’\n",
      "‘Help him, then!’ said Grandmother Jia; and Cousin Zhen hurried back to where\n",
      "Abbot Zhang was waiting a few yards behind him and supported him by an elbow\n",
      "into her presence. The abbot prefaced his greeting with a good deal of jovial laughter.\n",
      "‘Blessed Buddha of Boundless Life! And how has Your Old Ladyship been all this\n",
      "while? In rude good health, I trust? And Their Ladyships, and all the younger ladies?\n",
      "— also flourishing? It’s quite a while since I was at the mansion to call on Your Old\n",
      "Ladyship, but I declare you look more blooming than ever!’\n",
      "‘And how are you, old Holy One?’ Grandmother Jia asked him with a pleased smile.\n",
      "‘Thank Your Old Ladyship for asking. I still keep pretty fit. But never mind about\n",
      "that. What I want to know is, how’s our young hero been keeping, eh? We were\n",
      "celebrating the blessed Nativity of the Veiled King here on the twenty-sixth. Very\n",
      "select little gathering. Tasteful offerings. I thought our young friend might have\n",
      "enjoyed it; but when I sent round to invite him, they told me he was out.’\n",
      "‘He really was out,’ said Grandmother Jia, and turned aside to summon the ‘young\n",
      "hero’; but Bao-yu had gone to the lavatory. He came hurrying forward presently.\n",
      "‘Hallo, Papa Zhang! How are you?’\n",
      "The old Taoist embraced him affectionately and returned his greeting.\n",
      "‘He’s beginning to fill out,’ he said, addressing Grand?mother Jia.\n",
      "‘He looks well enough on the outside,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘but underneath he’s\n",
      "delicate. And his Pa doesn’t improve matters by forcing him to study all the time. I’m\n",
      "afraid he’ll end up by making the child ill.’\n",
      "‘Lately I’ve been seeing calligraphy and poems of his in all kinds of places,’ said\n",
      "Abbot Zhang, ‘— all quite remarkably good. I really can’t understand why Sir Zheng is\n",
      "concerned that the boy doesn’t study enough. If you ask me, I think he’s all right as\n",
      "he is.’ He sighed. ‘Of course, you know who this young man reminds me of, don’t you?\n",
      "Whether it’s his looks or the way he talks or the way he moves, to me he’s the spit\n",
      "and image of Old Sir Jia.’\n",
      "The old man’s eyes grew moist, and Grandmother Jia her?self showed a disposition\n",
      "to be tearful.\n",
      "‘It’s quite true,’ she said. ‘None of our children or our children’s children turned out\n",
      "like him, except my Bao. Only my little Jade Boy is like his grandfather.’\n",
      "‘Of course, your generation wouldn’t remember Old Sir Jia,’ Abbot Zhang said,\n",
      "\f",
      "turning to Cousin Zhen. ‘It’s before your time. In fact, I don’t suppose even Sir She\n",
      "and Sir Zheng can have a very clear recollection of what their father was like in his\n",
      "prime.’\n",
      "He brightened as another topic occurred to him and once more quaked with laughter.\n",
      "‘I saw a most attractive young lady when I was out visiting the other day. Fourteen\n",
      "this year. Seeing her put me in mind of our young friend here. It must be about time\n",
      "we started thinking about a match for him, surely? In looks, intelligence, breeding,\n",
      "background this girl was ideally suited. What does Your Old Ladyship feel? I didn’t\n",
      "want to rush matters. I thought I’d better first wait and see what Your Old Ladyship\n",
      "thought before saying anything to the family.’\n",
      "‘A monk who once told the boy’s fortune said that he was not to marry young,’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia; ‘so I think we had better wait until he is a little older before we\n",
      "arrange any?thing definite. But do by all means go on inquiring for us. It doesn’t\n",
      "matter whether the family is wealthy or not; as long as the girl looks all right, you can\n",
      "let me know. Even if it’s a poor family, we can always help out over the expenses.\n",
      "Money is no problem. It’s looks and character that count.’\n",
      "‘Now come on, Papa Zhang!’ said Xi-feng when this exchange had ended. Where’s\n",
      "that new amulet for my little girl? You had the nerve to send someone round the\n",
      "other day for gosling satin, and of course, as we didn’t want to embar?rass the old\n",
      "man by refusing, we had to send you some. So now what about that amulet?’\n",
      "Abbot Zhang once more quaked with laughter.\n",
      "‘Ho! ho! ho! You can tell how bad my eyes are getting; I didn’t even see you there,\n",
      "dear lady, or I should have thanked you for the satin. Yes, the amulet has been ready\n",
      "for some time. I was going to send it to you two days ago, but then Her Grace\n",
      "unexpectedly asked us for this Pro Viventibus and I stupidly forgot all about it. It’s\n",
      "still on the high altar being sanctified. I’ll go and get it for you.’\n",
      "He went off, surprisingly nimbly, to the main hall of the temple and returned after a\n",
      "short while carrying the amulet on a little tea-tray, using a red satin book-wrap as a\n",
      "tray-cloth. Baby’s nurse took the amulet from him, and he was just about to receive\n",
      "the little girl from her arms when he caught sight of Xi-feng laughing at him\n",
      "mockingly.\n",
      "‘Why didn’t you bring it in your hand?’ she asked him.\n",
      "‘The hands get so sweaty in this weather,’ he said. ‘I thought a tray would be more\n",
      "hygienic.’\n",
      "‘You gave me quite a fright when I saw you coming in with that tray,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I\n",
      "thought for one moment you were going to take up a collection!’\n",
      "There was a loud burst of laughter from the assembled company. Even Cousin Zhen\n",
      "was unable to restrain himself.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Monkey! Monkey!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Aren’t you afraid of going to the Hell of\n",
      "Scoffers when you die and hav?ing your tongue cut out?’\n",
      "‘Oh, Papa and I say what we like to each other,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He’s always telling me\n",
      "I must “acquire merit” and threatening me with a short life if I don’t pay up quickly.\n",
      "That’s right, isn’t it Papa?’\n",
      "‘As a matter of fact I did have an ulterior motive in bringing this tray,’ said Abbot\n",
      "Zhang, laughing, ‘but it wasn’t in order to make a collection, I assure you. I wanted to\n",
      "ask this young gentleman here if he would be so very kind as to lend me the famous\n",
      "jade for a few minutes. The tray is for carrying it out?side on, so that my Taoist\n",
      "friends, some of whom have travelled long distances to be here, and my old students,\n",
      "and their students, all of whom are gathered here today, may have the privilege of\n",
      "examining it.’\n",
      "‘My dear good man, in that case let the boy go with it round his neck and show it to\n",
      "them himself!’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘No need for all this running to and fro with\n",
      "trays — at your age, too!’\n",
      "‘Most kind! Most considerate! — But Your Old Ladyship is deceived,’ said the abbot.\n",
      "‘I may look my eighty years, but I’m still hale and hearty. No, the point is that with so\n",
      "many of them here today and the weather so hot, the smell is sure to be somewhat\n",
      "overpowering. Our young friend here is cer?tainly not used to it. We shouldn’t want\n",
      "him to be overcome by the – ah - effluvia, should we?’\n",
      "Hearing this, Grandmother Jia told Bao-yu to take off the Magic Jade and put it on\n",
      "the tray. Abbot Zhang draped the crimson cloth over his hands, grasped the tray\n",
      "between satin-covered thumbs and fingers, and, holding it like a sacred relic at eye\n",
      "level in front of him, conveyed it reverently from the courtyard.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and the others now continued their sight?seeing. They had finished\n",
      "with everything at ground level and were about to mount the stairs into the galleries\n",
      "when Cousin Zhen came up to report that Abbot Zhang had re?turned with the jade.\n",
      "He was followed by the smiling figure of the abbot, holding the tray in the same\n",
      "reverential manner as before.\n",
      "‘Well, they’ve all seen the jade now,’ he said, ‘— and very grateful they were. They\n",
      "agreed that it really is a most remark?able object, and they regretted that they had\n",
      "nothing of value to show their appreciation with. Here you are! — this is the best\n",
      "they could do. These are all little Taoist trinkets they happened to have about them.\n",
      "Nothing very special, I’m afraid; but they’d like our young friend to keep them, either\n",
      "to amuse himself with or to give away to his friends.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia looked at the tray. It was covered with jewellery. There were golden\n",
      "crescents, jade thumb-rings and a lot of ‘motto’ jewellery — a tiny sceptre and\n",
      "persimmons with the rebus-meaning ‘success in all things’, a little quail and a vase\n",
      "\f",
      "with corn-stalks meaning ‘peace throughout the years’, and many other designs — all\n",
      "in gold — or jade — work, and much of it inlaid with pearls and precious stones.\n",
      "Altogether there must have been about forty pieces.\n",
      "‘What have you been up to, you naughty old man?’ she said. ‘Those men are all\n",
      "poor priests - they can’t afford to give things like this away. You really shouldn’t have\n",
      "done this. We can’t possibly accept them.’\n",
      "‘It was their own idea, I do assure you,’ said the abbot. ‘There was nothing I could\n",
      "do to stop them. If you refuse to take these things, I am afraid you will destroy my\n",
      "credit with these people. They will say that I cannot really have the connection with\n",
      "your honoured family that I have always claimed to have.’\n",
      "After this Grandmother Jia could no longer decline. She told one of the servants to\n",
      "receive the tray.\n",
      "‘We obviously can’t refuse, Grannie, after what Papa Zhang has just said,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu; ‘but I really have no use for this stuff. Why not let one of the boys carry it\n",
      "outside for me and I’ll distribute it to the poor?’\n",
      "‘I think that’s a very good idea,’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "But Abbot Zhang thought otherwise and hastily inter?vened:\n",
      "‘I’m sure it does our young friend credit, this charitable impulse. However.\n",
      "Although these things are, as I said, of no especial value, they are — what shall I say\n",
      "— objects of virtù, and if you give them to the poor, in the first place the poor won’t\n",
      "have much use for them, and in the second place the objects themselves will get\n",
      "spoiled. If you want to give something to the poor, a largesse of money would, I\n",
      "suggest, be far more appropriate.’\n",
      "‘Very well, look after this stuff for me, then,’ said Bao-yu to the servant, ‘and this\n",
      "evening you will distribute a largesse.’\n",
      "This being now settled, Abbot Zhang withdrew, and Grandmother Jia and her party\n",
      "went up to the galleries. Grandmother Jia sat with Bao-yu and the girls in the gallery\n",
      "facing the stage and Xi-feng and Li Wan sat in the east gallery. The maids all sat in the\n",
      "west gallery and took it in turns to go off and wait on their mistresses.\n",
      "Not long after they were all seated, Cousin Zhen came up?stairs to say that the gods\n",
      "had now chosen which plays were to be performed — by which was meant, of course,\n",
      "that the names had been shaken from a pot in front of the altar, since this was the\n",
      "only way in which the will of the gods could be known. The first play selected was\n",
      "The White Serpent.\n",
      "‘What’s the story?’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "Cousin Zhen explained that it was about the emperor Gao-?zu, founder of the Han\n",
      "dynasty, who began his rise to great?ness by decapitating a monstrous white snake.\n",
      "The second choice was A Heap of Honours, which shows the sixtieth birthday party\n",
      "\f",
      "of the great Tang general Guo Zi-yi, attended by his seven sons and eight sons-in-law,\n",
      "all of whom held high office, the ‘heap of honours’ of the title being a reference to\n",
      "the table in his reception-hall piled high with their insignia.\n",
      "‘It seems a bit conceited to have this second one played,’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘Still, if that’s what the gods chose, I suppose we’d better have it. What’s the third\n",
      "one going to be?’\n",
      "‘The South Branch,’ said Cousin Zhen.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia was silent. She knew that The South Branch likens the world to an\n",
      "ant-heap and tells a tale of power and glory which turns out in the end to have been\n",
      "a dream.\n",
      "Hearing no reply, Cousin Zhen went off downstairs again to see about the Offertory\n",
      "Scroll, which had to be ceremonially burnt in front of the holy images along with\n",
      "paper money and paper ingots before the theatrical performance could begin.\n",
      "Our record omits any description of that ceremony and moves back to Bao-yu, who\n",
      "was sitting in the central gallery beside his grandmother, and who now called for a\n",
      "maid to bring the tray up so that he could put on his Magic Jade again. When he had\n",
      "done so, he began to pick over the other trinkets with which the tray was covered\n",
      "and to hand them one by one to Grandmother Jia for her inspection. Her atten?tion\n",
      "was taken by a little red-gold kylin with kingfisher-feather inlay. She stretched out her\n",
      "hand to take it.\n",
      "‘Now where have I seen something like this before?’ she said. ‘I feel certain I’ve\n",
      "seen some girl wearing an ornament like this.’\n",
      "‘Cousin Shi’s got one,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s the same as this one only a little smaller.’\n",
      "‘Funny!’ said Bao-yu. ‘All the times she’s been to our house, I don’t remember ever\n",
      "having seen it.’\n",
      "‘Cousin Ban is observant,’ said Tan-chun. ‘No matter what it is, she remembers\n",
      "everything.’\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps not quite everything,’ said Dai-yu wryly. ‘But she’s certainly very\n",
      "observant where things like this are con?cerned.’\n",
      "Bao-chai turned her head away and pretended not to have heard.\n",
      "Now that he knew the kylin on the tray was like one that Shi Xiang-yun wore, Bao-yu\n",
      "hurriedly picked it up and thrust it inside his jacket. But no sooner had he done so\n",
      "than it occurred to him that his action might be misconstrued; so instead of dropping\n",
      "it into his inside pocket, he continued to hold it there, at the same time glancing\n",
      "about him furtively to see if he had been observed. None of the others seemed to\n",
      "have noticed except Dai-yu, who was staring at him fixedly and nodding her head in\n",
      "mock approval.\n",
      "Bao-yu felt suddenly embarrassed. Drawing his hand out again with the ornament\n",
      "\f",
      "still in it, he returned her look and laughed sheepishly:\n",
      "‘It’s rather nice, isn’t it? I thought I’d keep it for you,’ he said. ‘When we get home\n",
      "we can thread it on a ribbon and you’ll be able to wear it.’\n",
      "Dai-yu tossed her head.\n",
      "‘I don’t want it!’\n",
      "‘If you don’t want it, I’ll keep it for myself, then,’ said Bao?-yu, and popped it once\n",
      "more inside his jacket.\n",
      "He was about to add something, but just at that moment Cousin Zhen’s wife, You-shi,\n",
      "and his new daughter-in-law, Hu-shi, arrived and came upstairs to pay their respects\n",
      "to Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘ Now why have you come here? You really shouldn’t have bothered,’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia. ‘We only came to amuse ourselves. It isn’t a formal visit.’\n",
      "No sooner had she said this than it was announced that representatives from General\n",
      "Feng’s household had arrived. It appeared that Feng Zi-ying’s mother, hearing that\n",
      "the Jia ladies were having a Pro Viventibus performed at the Taoist temple, had\n",
      "immediately prepared an offering of pork, mutton, incense, tea and cakes and sent it\n",
      "post-haste to the temple with her compliments. Xi-feng, hearing the announcement,\n",
      "came hurrying round to the central gallery. She clapped her hands and laughed.\n",
      "‘Dear oh dear! This is something I hadn’t bargained for. My idea was a quiet little\n",
      "outing for us girls; but here is everyone sending offerings and behaving as if we’d\n",
      "come here for a high mass or something. It’s all your fault, Grannie! And we haven’t\n",
      "even got any vails ready to give to the beaters.’\n",
      "Even as she said this, two stewardesses from the Feng house?hold were already\n",
      "mounting the stairs. And before ‘hey had gone, other messengers arrived with\n",
      "offerings from Vice-president Zhao’s lady. From then on it was a steady stream:\n",
      "friends, kinsmen, family connections, business associates - all who had heard that the\n",
      "Jia ladies were holding a Pro Viven?tibus sent their representatives along with\n",
      "offerings and com?plimentary messages. Grandmother Jia began to regret that she\n",
      "had ever come.\n",
      "‘It isn’t as if we’d come here for the ceremony,’ she grumb?led. ‘We only wanted to\n",
      "enjoy ourselves. But all we seem to have done is to have stirred up a lot of fuss.’\n",
      "Consequently, although she stayed and watched the plays for that day, she returned\n",
      "home fairly early in the afternoon and next day professed herself too lacking in\n",
      "energy to go again. Xi-feng reacted differently. ‘In for a penny, in for a pound’ was her\n",
      "motto. They had already had the fuss; and since the players were there anyway, they\n",
      "might as well go again today and enjoy themselves in peace.\n",
      "For Bao-yu the whole of the previous day had been spoilt by Abbot Zhang’s proposal\n",
      "to Grandmother Jia to arrange a match for him. He came home in a thoroughly bad\n",
      "\f",
      "temper and kept telling everyone that he would ‘never see Abbot Zhang again as\n",
      "long as he lived’. Not associating his ill-humour with the abbot’s proposal, the others\n",
      "were mystified.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia’s unwillingness was further reinforced by the fact that Dai-yu, since\n",
      "her return home yesterday, had been suffering from mild sunstroke. What with one\n",
      "thing and another, the old lady declined absolutely to go again, and Xi-?feng had to\n",
      "make up her own party and go by herself.\n",
      "But Xi-feng’s play-going does not concern us.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "Bao-yu, believing that Dai-yu’s sunstroke was serious and that she might even be in\n",
      "danger of her life, was so worried that he could not eat, and rushed round in the\n",
      "middle of the lunch-hour to see how she was. He found her neither as ill as he had\n",
      "feared nor as responsive as he might have hoped.\n",
      "‘Why don’t you go and watch your plays?’ she asked him. ‘What are you mooning\n",
      "about at home for?’\n",
      "Abbot Zhang’s recent attempt at match-making had profoundly distressed Bao-yu\n",
      "and he was shocked by her seeming indifference.\n",
      "‘I can forgive the others for not understanding what has upset me,’ he thought; ‘but\n",
      "that she should want to trifle with me at a time like this…!’\n",
      "The sense that she had failed him made the annoyance he now felt with her a\n",
      "hundred times greater than it had been on any previous occasion. Never could any\n",
      "other person have stirred him to such depths of atrabilious rage. Coming from other\n",
      "lips, her words would scarcely have touched him. Com?ing from hers, they put him in\n",
      "a passion. His face darkened.\n",
      "‘It’s all along been a mistake, then,’ he said. ‘You’re not what I took you for.’\n",
      "Dai-yu gave an unnatural little laugh.\n",
      "‘Not what you took me for? That’s hardly surprising, is it? I haven’t got that little\n",
      "something which would have made me worthy of you.’\n",
      "Bao-yu came tight up to her and held his face close to hers:\n",
      "‘You do realize, don’t you, that you are deliberately willing my death?’\n",
      "Dai-yu could not for the moment understand what he was talking about.\n",
      "‘I swore an oath to you yesterday,’ he went on. ‘I said that I hoped Heaven might\n",
      "strike me dead if this “gold and jade” business meant anything to me. Since you have\n",
      "now brought it up again, it’s clear to me that you want me to die. Though what you\n",
      "hope to gain by my death I find it hard to imagine.’\n",
      "Dai-yu now remembered what had passed between them on the previous day. She\n",
      "knew that she was wrong to have spoken as she did, and felt both ashamed and a\n",
      "\f",
      "little frightened. Her shoulders started shaking and she began to cry.\n",
      "‘May Heaven strike me dead if I ever willed your death!’ she said. ‘But I don’t see\n",
      "what you have to get so worked up about. It’s only because of what Abbot Zhang said\n",
      "about arranging a match for you. You’re afraid he might interfere with your precious\n",
      "“gold and jade” plans; and because you’re angry about that, you have to come along\n",
      "and take it out on me — That’s all it is, isn’t it?’\n",
      "Bao-yu had from early childhood manifested a streak of morbid sensibility, which\n",
      "being brought up in close proximity with a nature so closely in harmony with his own\n",
      "had done little to improve. Now that he had reached an age when both his\n",
      "experience and the reading of forbidden books had taught him something about\n",
      "‘worldly matters’, he had begun to take a rather more grown-up interest in girls. But\n",
      "although there were plenty of young ladies of outstanding beauty and breed?ing\n",
      "among the Jia family’s numerous acquaintance, none of them, in his view, could\n",
      "remotely compare with Dai-yu. For some time now his feeling for her had been a\n",
      "very special one; but precisely because of this same morbid sensibility, he had shrunk\n",
      "from telling her about it. Instead, whenever he was feeling particularly happy or\n",
      "particularly cross, he would in?vent all sorts of ways of probing her to find out if this\n",
      "feeling for her was reciprocated. It was unfortunate for him that Dai-yu herself\n",
      "possessed a similar streak of morbid sensibility and disguised her real feelings, as he\n",
      "did his, while attempting to discover what he felt about her.\n",
      "Here was a situation, then, in which both parties concealed their real emotions and\n",
      "assumed counterfeit ones in an en?deavour to find out what the real feelings of the\n",
      "other party were. And because when false meets false the truth will oft-times out,\n",
      "there was the constant possibility that the innumerable little frustrations that were\n",
      "engendered by all this concealment would eventually erupt into a quarrel.\n",
      "Take the present instance. What Bao-yu was actually think?ing at this moment was\n",
      "something like this:\n",
      "‘In my eyes and in my thoughts there is no one else but you. I can forgive the others\n",
      "for not knowing this, but surely you ought to realize? If at a time like this you can’t\n",
      "share my anxiety — if you can think of nothing better to do than provoke me with\n",
      "that sort of silly talk, it shows that the concern I feel for you every waking minute of\n",
      "the day is wasted: that you just don’t care about me at all.’\n",
      "This was what he thought; but of course be didn’t say it. On her side Dai-yu’s\n",
      "thoughts were somewhat as follows:\n",
      "‘I know you must care for me a little bit, and I’m sure you don’t take this ridiculous\n",
      "“gold and jade” talk seriously. But if you cared only for me and had absolutely no\n",
      "inclination at all in another direction, then every time I mentioned “gold and jade”\n",
      "you would behave quite naturally and let it pass almost as if you hadn’t noticed. How\n",
      "\f",
      "is it, then, that when I do refer to it you get so excited? It shows that it must be on\n",
      "your mind. You pretend to be upset in order to allay my suspicions.’\n",
      "Meanwhile a quite different thought was running through Bao-yu’s mind.\n",
      "‘I would do anything — absolutely anything,’ he was think?ing, ‘if only you would\n",
      "be nice to me. If you would be nice to me, I would gladly die for you this moment. It\n",
      "doesn’t really matter whether you know what I feel for you or not. Just be nice to me,\n",
      "then at least we shall be a little closer to each other, instead of so horribly far apart.’\n",
      "At the same time Dai-yu was thinking:\n",
      "‘Never mind me. Just be your own natural self. If yon were all right, I should be all\n",
      "right too. All these manoeuvrings to try and anticipate my feelings don’t bring us any\n",
      "closer to?gether; they merely draw us farther apart.’\n",
      "The percipient reader will no doubt observe that these two young people were\n",
      "already of one mind, but that the com?plicated procedures by which they sought to\n",
      "draw together were in fact having precisely the opposite effect. Complacent reader!\n",
      "Permit us to remind you that your correct under?standing of the situation is due\n",
      "solely to the fact that we have been revealing to you the secret, innermost thoughts\n",
      "of those two young persons, which neither of them had so far ever felt able to\n",
      "express.\n",
      "Let us now return from the contemplation of inner thoughts to the recording of\n",
      "outward appearances.\n",
      "When Dai-yu, far from saying something nice to him, once more made reference to\n",
      "the ‘gold and jade’, Bao-yu became so choked with rage that for a moment he was\n",
      "quite literally bereft of speech. Frenziedly snatching the ‘Magic Jade’ from his neck\n",
      "and holding it by the end of its silken cord he gritted his teeth and dashed it against\n",
      "the floor with all the strength in his body.\n",
      "‘Beastly thing!’ he shouted. ‘I’ll smash you to pieces and put an end to this once\n",
      "and for all.’\n",
      "But the jade, being exceptionally hard and resistant, was not the tiniest bit damaged.\n",
      "Seeing that he had not broken it, Bao-yu began to look around for something to\n",
      "smash it with. Dai-yu, still crying, saw what he was going to do.\n",
      "‘Why smash a dumb, lifeless object?’ she said. ‘If you want to smash something, let\n",
      "it be me.’\n",
      "The sound of their quarrelling brought Nightingale and Snowgoose hurrying in to\n",
      "keep the peace. They found Bao-yu apparently bent on destroying his jade and tried\n",
      "to wrest it from him. Failing to do so, and sensing that the quarrel was of more than\n",
      "usual dimensions, they went off to fetch Aroma. Aroma came back with them as fast\n",
      "as she could run and eventually succeeded in prising the jade from his hand. He\n",
      "glared at her scornfully.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘It’s my own thing I’m smashing,’ he said. ‘What business is it of yours to interfere?’\n",
      "Aroma saw that his face was white with anger and his eyes wild and dangerous.\n",
      "Never had she seen him in so terrible a rage. She took him gently by the hand:\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t smash the jade just because of a disagree?ment with your cousin,’\n",
      "she said. ‘What do you think she would feel like and what sort of position would it\n",
      "put her in if you really were to break it?’\n",
      "Dai-yu heard these words through her sobs. They struck a responsive chord in her\n",
      "breast, and she wept all the harder to think that even Aroma seemed to understand\n",
      "her better than Bao-yu did. So much emotion was too much for her weak stomach.\n",
      "Suddenly there was a horrible retching noise and up came the tisane of elsholtzia\n",
      "leaves she had taken only a short while before. Nightingale quickly held out her\n",
      "handkerchief to receive it and, while Snowgoose rubbed and pounded her back,\n",
      "Dai-yu continued to retch up wave upon wave of watery vomit, until the whole\n",
      "handkerchief was soaked with it.\n",
      "‘However cross you may be, Miss, you ought to have more regard for your health,’\n",
      "said Nightingale. ‘You’d only just taken that medicine and you were beginning to feel\n",
      "a little bit better for it, and now because of your argument with Master Bao you’ve\n",
      "gone and brought it all up again. Suppose you were to be really ill as a consequence.\n",
      "How do you think Master Bao would feel?’\n",
      "When Bao-yu heard these words they struck a responsive chord in his breast, and he\n",
      "reflected bitterly that even Nightin?gale seemed to understand him better than\n",
      "Dai-yu But then he looked again at Dai-yu, who was sobbing and panting by turns,\n",
      "and whose red and swollen face was wet with perspira?tion and tears, and seeing\n",
      "how pitiably frail and ill she looked, his heart misgave him.\n",
      "‘I shouldn’t have taken her up on that “gold and jade” business,’ he thought. ‘I’ve\n",
      "got her into this state and now there’s no way in which I can relieve her by sharing\n",
      "what she suffers.’ As he thought this, he, too, began to cry.\n",
      "Now that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were both crying, Aroma instinctively drew towards her\n",
      "master to comfort him. A pang of pity for him passed through her and she squeezed\n",
      "his hand sympathetically. It was as cold as ice. She would have liked to tell him not to\n",
      "cry but hesitated, partly from the consideration that he might be suffering from some\n",
      "deep-concealed hurt which crying would do something to relieve, and partly from\n",
      "the fear that to do so in Dai-yu’s presence might seem pre?sumptuous. Torn between\n",
      "a desire to speak and fear of the possible consequences of speaking, she did what\n",
      "girls of her type often do when faced with a difficult decision: she avoided the\n",
      "necessity of making one by bursting into tears.\n",
      "As for Nightingale, who had disposed of the handkerchief of vomited tisane and was\n",
      "now gently fanning her mistress with her fan, seeing the other three all standing\n",
      "\f",
      "there as quiet as mice with the tears streaming down their faces, she was so\n",
      "affected by the sight that she too started crying and was obliged to have recourse to\n",
      "a second handkerchief.\n",
      "There the four of them stood, then, facing each other; all of them crying; none of\n",
      "them saying a word. It was Aroma who broke the silence with a strained and nervous\n",
      "laugh.\n",
      "‘You ought not to quarrel with Miss Lin,’ she said to Bao-yu, ‘if only for the sake of\n",
      "this pretty cord she made you.’\n",
      "At these words Dai-yu, ill as she was, darted forward, grabbed the jade from Aroma’s\n",
      "hand, and snatching up a pair of scissors that were lying nearby, began feverishly\n",
      "cutting at its silken cord with them. Before Aroma and Nightingale could stop her, she\n",
      "had already cut it into several pieces.\n",
      "‘It was a waste of time making it,’ she sobbed. ‘He doesn’t really care for it. And\n",
      "there’s someone else who’ll no doubt make him a better one!’\n",
      "‘What a shame!’ said Aroma, retrieving the jade. ‘It’s all my silly fault. I should have\n",
      "kept my mouth shut.’\n",
      "‘Go on! Cut away!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shan’t be wearing the wretched thing again\n",
      "anyway, so it doesn’t matter.’\n",
      "Preoccupied with the quarrel, the four of them had failed to notice several old\n",
      "women, who had been drawn by the sound of it to investigate. Apprehensive, when\n",
      "they saw Dai?-yu hysterically weeping and vomiting and Bao-yu trying to smash his\n",
      "jade, of the dire consequences to be expected from a scene of such desperate\n",
      "passion, they had hurried off in a body to the front of the mansion to report the\n",
      "matter to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, hoping in this way to establish in advance\n",
      "that whatever the consequences might be, they were not responsible for them. From\n",
      "their precipitate entry and the grave tone of their announcement Grandmother Jia\n",
      "and Lady Wang assumed that some major catastrophe had befallen and hurried with\n",
      "them into the Garden to find out what it was.\n",
      "Their arrival filled Aroma with alarm. ‘What did Nightin?gale want to go troubling\n",
      "Their Ladyships for?’ she thought crossly, supposing that the talebearer had been\n",
      "sent to them by Nightingale; while Nightingale for her part was angry with Aroma,\n",
      "thinking that the talebearer must have been one of Aroma’s minions.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang entered the room to find a silent Bao-yu and a silent\n",
      "Dai-yu, neither of whom, when questioned, would admit that anything at all was the\n",
      "matter. They therefore visited their wrath on the beads of the two unfortunate maids,\n",
      "insisting that it was entirely owing to their negligence that matters had got so much\n",
      "out of hand. Unable to defend themselves, the girls were obliged to endure a long\n",
      "and abusive dressing-down, after which Grandmother Jia concluded the affair by\n",
      "\f",
      "carrying Bao-yu off to her own apart?ment.\n",
      "Next day, the third of the fifth month, was Xue Pan’s birthday and there was a family\n",
      "party with plays, to which the Jias were all invited. Bao-yu, who had still not seen\n",
      "Dai-yu since his outburst — which he now deeply regretted — was feeling far too\n",
      "dispirited to care about seeing plays, and declined to go on the ground that he was\n",
      "feeling unwell.\n",
      "Dai-yu, though somewhat overcome on the day previous to this by the sultry weather,\n",
      "had by no means been seriously ill. Arguing that if she was not ill, it was impossible\n",
      "that he should be, she felt sure, when she heard of Bao-yu’s excuse, that it must be a\n",
      "false one.\n",
      "‘He usually enjoys drinking and watching plays,’ she thought. ‘If he’s not going, it\n",
      "must be because he is still angry about yesterday; or if it isn’t that, it must be\n",
      "because he’s heard that I’m not going and doesn’t want to go without me. Oh! I\n",
      "should never have cut that cord! Now he won’t ever wear his jade again - unless I\n",
      "make him another cord to wear it on.’\n",
      "So she, too, regretted the quarrel.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia knew that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were angry with each other, but she\n",
      "had been assuming that they would see each other at the Xues’ party and make it up\n",
      "there. When neither of them turned up at it, she became seriously upset.\n",
      "‘I’m a miserable old sinner,’ she grumbled. It must be my punishment for something\n",
      "I did wrong in a past life to have to live with a pair of such obstinate, addle-headed\n",
      "little geese! I’m sure there isn’t a day goes by without their giving me some fresh\n",
      "cause for anxiety. It must he fate. That’s what it says in the proverb, after all:\n",
      "                       ’Tis Fate brings foes and lo’es tegither.\n",
      "I’ll be glad when I’ve drawn my last breath and closed my old eyes for the last time;\n",
      "then the two of them can snap and snarl at each other to their hearts’ content, for I\n",

      "and tell him so, she continued, both day and night, in a state of un?relieved\n",

      "‘I think the day before yesterday you were too hasty, Miss. We ought to know what\n",

      "had with him in the past on account of that jade!’\n",
      "‘Poh!’ said Dai-yu scornfully. ‘You are trying to make out that it was my fault\n",

      "Nightingale gave her a quizzical smile.\n",
      "‘No? Then why did you cut that cord up? If three parts of the blame was Bao-yu’s,\n",
      "I’m sure at least seven parts of it was yours. From what I’ve seen of it, he’s all right\n",
      "with you when you allow him to be; it’s because you’re so prickly with him and\n",
      "always trying to put him in the wrong that he gets worked up.’\n",

      "She was moving outside, even as she said this, regardless of her mistress’s injunction.\n",

      "This exchange took place as they were crossing the fore?court. He now entered the\n",

      "the bittersweet pang she experienced when she heard his arrival had started the\n",
      "tears rolling. Bao-yu went up to the bed and smiled down at her.\n",
      "‘How are you, coz? Quite better now?’\n",
      "As Dai-yu seemed to be too busy wiping her eyes to make a reply, he sat down close\n",
      "beside her on the edge of the bed:\n",
      "‘I know you’re not really angry with me,’ he said. ‘It’s just that if the others noticed I\n",
      "wasn’t coming here, they would think we had been quarrelling; and if we waited for\n",
      "them to interfere, we should be allowing other people to come be?tween us. It\n",

      "He must have repeated those same two words in the same tone of passionate\n",
      "entreaty upwards of twenty times. Dai-yu had been meaning to ignore him, but what\n",
      "he had just been saying about other people ‘coming between’ them seemed to prove\n",
      "that he must in some way feel closer to her than the rest, and she was unable to\n",
      "maintain her silence.\n",
      "‘You don’t have to treat me like a child,’ she blurted out tearfully. ‘From now on I\n",
      "shall make no further claims on you. You can behave exactly as if I had gone away.’\n",
      "‘Gone away?’ said Bao-yu laughingly. ‘Where would you go to?’\n",
      "‘Back home.’\n",
      "‘I’d follow you.’\n",
      "‘As if I were dead then.’\n",
      "‘If you died,’ he said, ‘I should become a monk.’\n",
      "Dai-yu’s face darkened immediately:\n",
      "‘What an utterly idiotic thing to say! Suppose your own sisters were to die? Just\n",
      "how many times can one person become a monk? I think I had better see what the\n",
      "others think about that remark.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had realized at once that she would be offended; but the words were already\n",
      "out of his mouth before he could stop them. He turned very red and hung his head in\n",
      "silence. It was a good thing that no one else was in the room at that moment to see\n",
      "him. Dai-yu glared at him for some seconds - evidently too enraged to speak, for she\n",
      "made a sound somewhere be?tween a snort and a sigh, but said nothing - then,\n",
      "seeing him almost purple in the face with suppressed emotion, she clenched her\n",
      "teeth, pointed her finger at him, and, with an indignant ‘Hmn!’, stabbed the air quite\n",
      "\f",
      "savagely a few inches away from his forehead:\n",
      "‘You—!’\n",
      "But whatever it was she had been going to call him never got said. She merely gave a\n",
      "sigh and began wiping her eyes again with her handkerchief.\n",
      "Bao-yu had been in a highly emotional state when he came to see Dai-yu and it had\n",
      "further upset him to have inadvertent?ly offended her so soon after his arrival. This\n",
      "angry gesture and the unsuccessful struggle, ending in sighs and tears, to say what\n",
      "she wanted to say now affected him so deeply that he, too, began to weep. In need\n",
      "of a handkerchief but finding that he had come out without one, he wiped his eyes\n",
      "on his sleeve.\n",
      "Although Dai-yu was crying, the spectacle of Bao-yu using the sleeve of his\n",
      "brand-new lilac-coloured summer gown as a handkerchief had not escaped her, and\n",
      "while continuing to wipe her own eyes with one hand, she leaned over and reached\n",
      "with the other for the square of silk that was draped over the head-rest at the end of\n",
      "the bed. She lifted it off and threw it at him — all without uttering a word - then,\n",
      "once more burying her face in her own handkerchief, resumed her weeping. Bao-?yu\n",
      "picked up the handkerchief she had thrown him and hur?riedly wiped his eyes with it.\n",
      "When he had dried them, he drew up close to her again and took one of her hands in\n",
      "his own, smiling at her gently.\n",
      "‘I don’t know why you go on crying,’ he said. ‘I feel as if all my insides were\n",
      "shattered. Come! Let’s go and see Grandmother together.’\n",
      "Dai-yu flung off his hand.\n",
      "‘Take your hands off me! We’re not children any more. You really can’t go on\n",
      "mauling me about like this all the time. Don’t you understand anything —?’\n",
      "‘Bravo!’\n",
      "The shouted interruption startled them both. They spun round to look just as Xi-feng,\n",
      "full of smiles, came bustling into the room.\n",
      "‘Grandmother has been grumbling away something awful,’ she said. ‘She insisted\n",
      "that I should come over and see if you were both all right. “Oh,” I said, “there’s no\n",
      "need to go and look, Grannie; they’ll have made it up by now without any\n",
      "interference from us.” So she told me I was lazy. Well, here I am — and of course it’s\n",
      "exactly as I said it would be. I don’t know. I don’t understand you two. What is it you\n",
      "find to argue about? For every three days that you’re friends you must spend at least\n",
      "two days quarrelling. You really are a couple of babies. And the older you get, the\n",
      "worse you get. Look at you now — holding hands crying! And a couple of days ago\n",
      "you were glaring at each other like fighting-cocks. Come on! Come with me to see\n",
      "Grandmother. Let’s put the old lady’s mind at rest.’\n",
      "As she said this, she seized Dai-yu’s hand and began march?ing off with her. Dai-yu\n",
      "\f",
      "turned back and called for her maids, but there was no response.\n",
      "‘What do you want to call them for?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’ve got me to wait on you,\n",
      "haven’t you?’\n",
      "She continued to walk away, still holding Dai-yu by the hand. Bao-yu followed a little\n",
      "way behind. They went out of the Garden and through into Grandmother Jia’s\n",
      "apartment.\n",
      "‘I told you they could be left to themselves to make it up and that there was no\n",
      "need for you to worry,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when they were all in the old\n",
      "lady’s pre?sence; ‘but you wouldn’t believe me, would you? You insisted on my going\n",
      "there to act the peacemaker. Well, I went there; and what did I find? I found the two\n",
      "of them together apolo?gizing to each other. It was like the kite and the kestrel\n",
      "holding hands: they were positively locked in a clinch! No need of a peacemaker that\n",
      "I could see.’\n",
      "There was a burst of laughter from all present. Bao-chai was among these, but Dai-yu\n",
      "slipped past her without speaking and took a seat next to Grandmother Jia. Bao-yu,\n",
      "rather at a loss for something to say, turned to Bao-chai.\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I’ wasn’t very well on your brother’s birthday; so apart from not giving\n",
      "him a present, I couldn’t even make him a kotow this year. I’m afraid he may not have\n",
      "realized I was ill and thought that I was merely making excuses. If you can spare a\n",
      "moment next time you see him, I do hope you will explain to him for me.’\n",
      "Bao-chai looked amused.\n",
      "‘That seems a trifle excessive. I am sure he would have felt uncomfortable about\n",
      "your kotowing to him, even if you had been able to come; so I’m quite sure he\n",
      "wouldn’t have wanted you to come when you weren’t feeling well. It would be rather\n",
      "unfriendly, surely, if cousins who see each other all the time were to start worrying\n",
      "about trifles like that?’\n",
      "Bao-yu smiled.\n",
      "‘Well, as long as yon understand, that’s all right. But why aren’t you watching the\n",
      "players?’\n",
      "‘I can’t stand the heat,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I did watch a couple of acts of something,\n",
      "but it was so hot that I couldn’t stay any longer. Unfortunately none of the guests\n",
      "showed any sign of going, so I had to pretend I was ill in order to get away.’\n",
      "‘Touché!’ thought Bao-yu; but he hid his embarrassment in a stupid laugh.\n",
      "‘No wonder they compare you to Yang Gui-fei, cousin. You are well-covered like her,\n",
      "and they always say that plump people fear the heat.’\n",
      "The colour flew into Bao-chai’s face. An angry retort was on her lips, but she could\n",
      "hardly make it in front of company. Yet reflection only made her angrier. Eventually,\n",
      "after a scorn?ful sniff or two, she said:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I may be like Yang Gui-fei in some respects, but I don’t think there is much danger\n",
      "of my cousin becoming a Prime Minister.’\n",
      "It happened that just at that moment a very young maid called ‘Prettikins’ jokingly\n",
      "accused Bao-chai of having hid?den a fan she was looking for.\n",
      "‘I know Miss Bao’s hidden it,’ she said, ‘Come on, Miss! Please let me have it.’\n",
      "‘You be careful,’ said Bao-chai, pointing at the girl angrily and speaking with\n",
      "unwonted stridency. ‘When did you last see me playing games of this sort with\n",
      "anyone? If there are other young ladies who are in the habit of romping about with\n",
      "you, you had better ask them.’\n",
      "Prettikins fled.\n",
      "Bao-yu realized that he had once again given offence by speaking thoughtlessly; and\n",
      "as this time it was in front of a lot of people, his embarrassment was correspondingly\n",
      "greater. He turned aside in confusion and began talking nervously to someone else.\n",
      "Bao-yu’s rudeness to Bao-chai had given Dai-yu secret satisfaction. When Prettikins\n",
      "came in looking for her fan, she had been on the point of adding some facetiousness\n",
      "of her own at Bao-chai’s expense; but Bao-chai’s brief explosion caused her to drop\n",
      "the prepared witticism and ask instead what play the two acts were from that\n",
      "Bao-chai said she had just been watching.\n",
      "Bao-chai had observed the smirk on Dai-yu’s face and knew very well that Bao-yu’s\n",
      "rudeness must have pleased her. The smiling answer she gave to Dai-yu’s question\n",
      "was therefore not without a touch of malice.\n",
      "‘The play I saw was Li Kui Abuses Song Jiang and After?wards Has to Say He Is\n",
      "Sorry.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘What a mouthful! Surely, with all your learning, cousin, you must know the proper\n",
      "name of that play? It’s called The Abject Apology.’\n",
      "‘The Abject Apology?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Well, no doubt you clever people know all\n",
      "there is to know about abject apology. I’m afraid it’s something I wouldn’t know\n",
      "about.’\n",
      "Her words touched Bao-yu and Dai-yu on a sensitive spot, and by the time she had\n",
      "finished, they were both blushing hotly with embarrassment.\n",
      "Xi-feng was insufficiently educated to have understood all these nuances, but by\n",
      "studying the speakers’ expressions she had formed a pretty good idea of what they\n",
      "were talking about.\n",
      "‘Rather hot weather to be eating raw ginger, isn’t it?’ she asked.\n",
      "No one present could understand what she meant.\n",
      "‘No one’s been eating raw ginger,’ they said.\n",
      "Xi-feng affected great surprise and rubbed her cheek mean?ingfully with her hand:\n",
      "\f",
      "‘If no one’s been eating raw ginger, then why are they look?ing so hot and\n",
      "bothered?’\n",
      "At this Bao-yu and Dai-yu felt even more uncomfortable. Bao-chai was about to add\n",
      "something, but seeing the abject look on Bao-yu’s face, she laughed and held her\n",
      "tongue. None of the others present had understood what the four of them were\n",
      "talking about and treated these exchanges as a joke.\n",
      "Shortly after this, when Bao-chai and Xi-feng had gone out of the room, Dai-yu said\n",
      "to Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘You see? There are people even more dangerous to trifle with than I. If I weren’t\n",
      "such a tongue-tied, slow-witted creature, you wouldn’t get away with it quite so\n",
      "often, my friend.’\n",
      "Bao-yu was still smarting from Bao-chai’s testiness. To be set upon now by Dai-yu as\n",
      "well seemed positively the last straw. But though he wanted to reply, he knew how\n",
      "easily she would take offence and controlled himself with an effort. Feel?ing in very\n",
      "low spirits, he left the room himself now and went off on his own.\n",
      "It was the hottest part of the day. Lunch had long been over, and in every apartment\n",
      "mistress and maids alike had succumbed to the lassitude of the hour. As he sauntered\n",
      "slow?ly by, hands clasped behind his back, everywhere he went was hushed in the\n",
      "breathless silence of noon. From the back of Grandmother Jia’s quartets he passed\n",
      "eastwards through the gallery that ended near the wall of Xi-feng’s courtyard. He\n",
      "went up to the gate, but it was closed, and remembering that it was her invariable\n",
      "custom when the weather was hot to take two whole hours off in the middle of the\n",
      "day for her siesta, he thought he had better not go in. He continued, instead, through\n",
      "the corner gate that led into his parents’ courtyard.\n",
      "On entering his mother’s apartment, he found several maids dozing over their\n",
      "embroidery. Lady Wang herself was lying on a summer-bed in the inner room,\n",
      "apparently fast asleep. Her maid Golden, who was sitting beside her gently pounding\n",
      "her legs, also seemed half asleep, for her head was nodding and her half-closed eyes\n",
      "were blinking drowsily. Bao-yu tiptoed up to her and tweaked an ear-ring. She\n",
      "opened her eyes wide and saw that it was Bao-yu.\n",
      "He smiled at her and whispered.\n",
      "‘So sleepy?’\n",
      "Golden pursed her lips up in a smile, motioned to him with her hand to go away, and\n",
      "then closed her eyes again. But Bao-yu lingered, fascinated. Silently craning forward\n",
      "to make sure that Lady Wang’s eyes were closed, he took a Fragrant Snow ‘quencher’\n",
      "from the embroidered pouch at his waist and popped it between Golden’s lips.\n",
      "Golden nibbled it dreamily without opening her eyes.\n",
      "‘Shall I ask Her Ladyship to let me have you, so that we can be together?’ he\n",
      "\f",
      "whispered jokingly.\n",
      "Golden made no reply.\n",
      "‘When she wakes up, I’ll talk to her about it,’ he said.\n",
      "Golden opened her eyes wide and gave him a little push.\n",
      "‘What’s the hurry?’ she said playfully. ‘“Yours is yours, wherever it be”, as they said\n",
      "to the lady when she dropped her gold comb in the well. Haven’t you ever heard that\n",
      "saying? — I’ll tell you something to do, if you want a bit of fun. Go into the little east\n",
      "courtyard and you’ll be able to catch Sunset and Huan together.’\n",
      "‘Who cares about them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let’s talk about us.’ At this point Lady Wang\n",
      "sat bolt upright and dealt Golden a slap in the face.\n",
      "‘Shameless little harlot!’ she cried, pointing at bet wrath-fully. ‘It’s you and your like\n",
      "who corrupt our innocent young boys.’\n",
      "Bao-yu had slipped silently away as soon as his mother sat up. Golden, one of whose\n",
      "cheeks was now burning a fiery red, was left without a word to say. The other maids,\n",
      "hearing that their mistress was awake, came hurrying into the room.\n",
      "‘Silver!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Go and fetch your mother. I want her to take your sister\n",
      "Golden away.’\n",
      "Golden threw herself, weeping, upon her knees:\n",
      "‘No, Your Ladyship, please! Beat me and revile me as much as you like, but please,\n",
      "for pity’s sake, don’t send me away. I’ve been with Your Ladyship nigh on ten years\n",
      "now. How can I ever hold up my head again if you dismiss me?’\n",
      "Lady Wang was not naturally unkind. On the contrary, she was an exceptionally\n",
      "lenient mistress. This was, in fact, the first time in her life that she had ever struck a\n",
      "maid. But the kind of ‘shamelessness’ of which — in her view - Golden had just been\n",
      "guilty was the one thing she had always most abhorred. It was the uncontrollable\n",
      "anger of the morally out?raged that had caused her to strike Golden and call her\n",
      "names; and though Golden now begged and pleaded, she refused to retract her\n",
      "dismissal. When Golden’s mother, old Mrs Bai, had eventually been fetched, the\n",
      "wretched girl, utterly crushed by her shame and humiliation, was led away.\n",
      "But of her no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "Embarrassed by his mother’s awakening, Bao-yu had slipped hurriedly into the\n",
      "Garden.\n",
      "The burning sun was now in the height of heaven, the con?tracted shadows were\n",
      "concentrated darkly beneath the trees, and the stillness of noon, filled with the harsh\n",
      "trilling of cicadas, was broken by no human voice; but as he approached the bamboo\n",
      "trellises of the rose-garden, a sound like a suppressed sob seemed to come from\n",

      "inside the pergola. Uncer?tain what it was that he had heard, he stopped to listen.\n",
      "Undoubtedly there was someone there.\n",
      "This was the fifth month of the year, when the rambler roses are in fullest bloom.\n",
      "Peeping through the fragrant panicles with which the pergola was smothered, he saw\n",

      "As he watched, he began to see that what she was doing with the pin was not\n",

      "the combination of shame, anger and pain she now felt on being kicked and shouted\n",
      "at by him in front of so many people was well-nigh insupport?able. Nevertheless she\n",
      "forced herself to bear it, reflecting that to have made an outcry would be like\n",
      "admitting that it was her he had meant to kick, which she knew was almost certainly\n",

      "‘You didn’t; you missed me,’ she said. ‘Come in and get changed.’\n",

      "‘Who said you did?’ said Aroma. ‘It’s the younger ones who normally see to the\n",
      "gate; and they’ve grown so insolent nowadays, it’s enough to put anyone in a rage. If\n",
      "you’d given one of them a few kicks and put the fear of God into them, it would have\n",
      "been a very good thing. No, it was my own silly fault. I should have made them open\n",
      "the gate and not gone to open it myself.’\n",
      "While they were speaking, the rain had stopped and Tresor and Topaze had left. The\n",

      "that’s best, isn’t it?’\n",

      "naming some pills and giving perfunctory instructions for taking them internally and\n",

      "made people feel lonely and feeling lonely made them unhappy, ergo it was better\n",
      "for them not to get together in the first place. In the same way she argued that since\n",

      "and see Her Ladyship about this.’\n",
      "He got up and began to go; but Aroma came in again and barred his way.\n",
      "‘Where are you off to?’ she asked him smilingly.\n",
      "‘To see Her Ladyship.’\n",
      "‘Oh, that’s silly,’ said Aroma. ‘I wonder you’re not ashamed to. Even if Skybright\n",
      "really does want to leave, there will be plenty of time to tell Her Ladyship about it\n",
      "when everyone has cooled down a bit and you are feeling calm and collected. If you\n",
      "go rushing off in your present state, Her Ladyship will suspect something.’\n",
      "‘Her Ladyship won’t suspect anything,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shall tell her quite openly that\n",
      "Skybright has been agitating to leave.’\n",
      "‘When have I ever agitated to leave?’ said Skybright, weeping now in earnest. ‘Even\n",
      "if you’re angry with me, you ought not to twist things round in order to get the better\n",
      "of me. But you go and tell her! I don’t care if I have to beat my own brains out, I’m\n",
      "not going out of that door.’\n",
      "‘Now that’s really strange,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t want to go, yet at the same time\n",
      "you won’t keep quiet. It’s no good; I really can’t stand this quarrelling. I shall really\n",
      "\f",
      "have to see Her Ladyship about this and get it over with.’\n",
      "This time he seemed quite determined to go.\n",
      "Seeing that she was unable to hold him back, Aroma went down on her knees.\n",
      "Emerald, Ripple, Musk and the other maids, aware that a quarrel of more than usual\n",
      "magnitude was going on inside, were waiting together outside in breathless silence.\n",
      "When word reached them that Aroma was now on her knees interceding for\n",
      "Skybright, they came silently troop?ing in to kneel down behind her. Bao-yu raised\n",
      "Aroma to her feet, sighed, sat down on the edge of the bed, and told the other maids\n",
      "to get up.\n",
      "‘What do you want me to do?’ be asked Aroma. ‘My heart is destroyed inside me,\n",
      "but none of you knows or cares.’\n",
      "Tears started from his eyes and rolled down his cheeks un?heeded. Seeing his tears,\n",
      "Aroma too began to cry. Skybright, who stood crying beside them, was about to say\n",
      "something; but just at that moment Dai-yu walked in and she slipped outside.\n",
      "Dai-yu beamed at the weeping pair:\n",
      "‘Crying on a holiday? What’s all this about? Have you been quarrelling over the\n",
      "rice-cakes?’\n",
      "Bao-yu and Aroma both burst out laughing.\n",
      "‘Well, if Cousin Bao won’t tell me,’ she went on, ‘I’m sure that you will. Come!’ she\n",
      "said, slapping Aroma familiarly on the shoulder. ‘Tell sis all about it. It’s obvious that\n",
      "the two of you have been having an argument. Tell me what it’s all about and I’ll\n",
      "make it up between you.’\n",
      "‘Oh, Miss!’ Aroma gave her a push. ‘Don’t carry on so! I’m only a maid; you\n",
      "shouldn’t say such things to me.’\n",
      "‘Only a maid?’ said Dai-yu. I always think of you as my sister-in-law.’\n",
      "‘Don’t you see that you’re simply encouraging people to be nasty to her?’ Bao-yu\n",
      "protested. ‘Even as it is, people already gossip about her. How can she stand up to\n",
      "them if you come along and lend your weight to what they are saying?’\n",
      "‘You don’t know what I feel, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘If I only knew how to stop\n",
      "breathing, I’d gladly die.’\n",
      "Dai-yu smiled.\n",
      "‘If you were to die, I don’t know about anyone else, but I know that I should die of\n",
      "grief.’\n",
      "‘I should become a monk,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Try to be a bit more serious,’ said Aroma. ‘You and Miss Lin are both laughing at\n",
      "me.’\n",
      "Dai-yu held up two fingers and looked at Bao-yu with a quizzical expression.\n",
      "‘That’s twice you’re going to become a monk. From now on I’m keeping the score.’\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu recognized the allusion to what he had said to her the day before. Fortunately\n",
      "he was able to pass it off with a laugh. Shortly after that, Dai-yu left them.\n",
      "No sooner had Dai-yu gone than someone arrived with an invitation from Xue Pan.\n",
      "Bao-yu thought that this time he had better go. It turned out to be only a\n",
      "drinking-party, but Xue Pan refused to release him and kept him there until it was\n",
      "over. He returned home in the evening more than a little drunk.\n",
      "As he came lurching into his courtyard, he saw that some?one in quest of coolness\n",
      "had taken a bed outside and was lying down on it asleep. Assuming that it must be\n",
      "Aroma, he sat down on the edge of it and gave her a push.\n",
      "‘Is the pain any better?’\n",
      "‘Can’t you leave me alone?’ she said, rising up wrathfully. He looked again and saw\n",
      "that it was not Aroma after all but Skybright. Taking her by the hand, he drew her\n",
      "down on the bed beside him.\n",
      "‘You’re getting so self-willed,’ he said laughingly. ‘When you trod on that fan this\n",
      "morning, I only made a harmless little remark, but look how you flew up in the air\n",
      "about it! And then when Aroma, out of the kindness of her heart, tried to reason\n",
      "with you, look how you pitched into her! Seriously, now, don’t you think it was all a\n",
      "bit uncalled-for?’\n",
      "‘I’m so hot,’ said Skybright. ‘Do you have to maul me about like this? Suppose\n",
      "someone were to see us? Anyway, it’s not right for me to be sitting here.’\n",
      "‘If you know it’s not right to be sitting here,’ he said teasingly, ‘what were you doing\n",
      "lying down?’\n",
      "‘Che-e-e!’ Unable at once to reply, she gave a little laugh. Then she said:\n",
      "‘When you are not here it doesn’t matter. It’s your being here that makes it wrong.\n",
      "Anyway, let me get up now, because I want to have a bath. Aroma and Musk have\n",
      "had theirs al?ready. I’ll send them out to you.’\n",
      "‘I’ve just had rather a lot to drink and I could do with a bath myself,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As\n",
      "you haven’t had yours yet, bring the water out here and we’ll have a bath together.’\n",
      "Skybright laughed and declined with a vigorous gesture of her hand.\n",
      "‘Oh no! I daren’t start you off on that caper. I still remember that time you got\n",
      "Emerald to help you bath. You must have been two or three hours in there, so that\n",
      "we began to get quite worried. We didn’t like to go in while you were there, but\n",
      "when we did go in to have a look afterwards, we found water all over the floor, pools\n",
      "of water round the legs of the bed, and even the mat on the bed had water splashed\n",
      "all over it. Heaven only knows what you’d been up to. We laughed about it for days\n",
      "afterwards. I haven’t got time to fetch that amount of water. And in any case, you\n",
      "don’t want to go taking baths with me. As a matter of fact it’s cooler now, so I don’t\n",
      "think I shall have a bath after all. Why don’t you let me fetch you a bowl of water so\n",
      "\f",
      "that you can have a nice wash and comb your hair? Faithful just sent a lot of fruit\n",
      "round and we’ve got it soaking in iced water in the big glass bowl. I’ll tell them to\n",
      "bring some out to you, shall I?’\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you’re not having a bath yourself, I’ll just wash my hands;\n",
      "and you can get me some of that fruit to eat.’\n",
      "Skybright smiled.\n",
      "‘You’ve already told me once today how clumsy I am. I can’t even drop a fan\n",
      "without treading on it. So I’m much too clumsy to get your fruit for you. Suppose I\n",
      "were to break a plate. That would be terrible!’\n",
      "‘If you want to break it, by all means break it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘These things are there\n",
      "for our use. What we use them for is a matter of individual taste. For example, fans\n",
      "are made for fanning with; but if you prefer to tear them up because it gives you\n",
      "pleasure, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t. What you mustn’t do is to use them\n",
      "as objects to vent your anger on. It’s the same with plates and cups. Plates and cups\n",
      "are made to put food and drink in. But if you want to smash them on purpose\n",
      "because you like the noise, it’s perfectly all right to do so. As long as you don’t get\n",
      "into a passion and start taking it out on things — that is the golden rule.’\n",
      "‘All right then,’ said Skybright with a mischievous smile. ‘Give me your fan to tear. I\n",
      "love the sound of a fan being torn.’\n",
      "Bao-yu held it out to her. She took it eagerly and — chah! — promptly tore it in half.\n",
      "And again — chah! chah! chah!—she tore it several more times. Bao-yu, an\n",
      "appreciative onlooker, laughed and encouraged her.\n",
      "‘Well torn! Well torn! Now again - a really loud one!’\n",
      "Just then Musk appeared. She stared at them indignantly.\n",
      "‘Don’t do that!’ she said. ‘It’s wicked to waste things like that.’\n",
      "But Bao-yu leaped up to her, snatched the fan from her hand, and passed it to\n",
      "Skybright, who at once tore it into several pieces. The two of them, Bao-yu and\n",
      "Skybright, then burst into uproarious laughter.\n",
      "‘What do you think you’re doing?’ said Musk. ‘That’s my fan you’ve just ruined.’\n",
      "‘What’s an old fan?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Open up the fan box and get yourself another.’\n",
      "‘If that’s your attitude,’ said Musk, ‘we might as well carry out the whole boxful and\n",
      "let her tear away to her heart’s con?tent.’\n",
      "‘All right. Go and get it,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘And be born a beggar in my next life?’ said Musk. ‘No thank you I She hasn’t\n",
      "broken her arm. Let her go and get it herself.’\n",
      "Skybright stretched back on the bed, smiling complacently. ‘I’m rather tired just now.\n",
      "I think I shall tear some more tomorrow.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘The ancients used to say that for one smile of a beautiful woman a thousand taels\n",
      "are well spent. For a few old fans it’s cheap at the price!’\n",
      "He called to Aroma, who had just finished changing into clean clothes, to come\n",
      "outside and join them. Little Melilot came and cleared away the broken bits of fan,\n",
      "and everyone sat for a while and enjoyed the cool.\n",
      "But our narrative supplies no further details of that evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon next day, while Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the girls were sitting in\n",
      "Grandmother Jia’s room, some?one came in to announce that ‘Miss Shi’ had arrived.\n",
      "Shortly afterwards Shi Xiang-yun appeared in the courtyard, attended by a bevy of\n",
      "matrons and maids. Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the rest hurried out to the foot of the steps\n",
      "to welcome her.\n",
      "For young girls like the cousins a reunion after a mere month’s separation is an\n",
      "occasion for touching demonstrations of affection. After these initial transports,\n",
      "when they were all indoors and the greetings, introductions and salutations had\n",
      "been completed, Grandmother Jia suggested that, as the weather was so hot,\n",
      "Xiang-yun should remove her outer gar?ments. Xiang-yun rose to her feet with\n",
      "alacrity and divested herself of one or two layers. Lady Wang was amused.\n",
      "‘Gracious, child! What a lot you have on! I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone\n",
      "wearing so much.’\n",
      "‘It’s my Aunt Shi who makes me wear it all,’ said Xiang yun. ‘You wouldn’t catch me\n",
      "wearing this stuff if I didn’t have to.’\n",
      "‘You don’t know our Xiang-yun, Aunt,’ Bao-chai inter?posed. ‘She’s really happiest\n",
      "in boy’s clothes. That time she was here in the third or fourth month last year, I\n",
      "remember one day she dressed up in one of Bao-yu’s gowns and put a pair of his\n",
      "boots on and one of his belts round her waist. At first glance she looked exactly like\n",
      "Cousin Bao. It was only the ear-rings that gave her away. When she stood behind that\n",
      "chair over there, Grandmother was completely taken in. She said, “Bao-yu, come\n",
      "over here! You’ll get the dust from that hanging lamp in your eyes if you’re not\n",
      "careful.” But Xiang?-yun just smiled and didn’t move. It was only when everyone\n",
      "couldn’t hold it in any longer and started laughing that Grandmother realized who it\n",
      "was and joined in the laugh. She told her that she made a very good-looking boy.’\n",
      "‘That’s nothing,’ said Dai-yu. ‘What about that time last year when she came to stay\n",
      "for a couple of days with us in the first month and it snowed? Grandma and Auntie\n",
      "Wang had just got back from somewhere — I think it was from visiting the ancestors’\n",
      "portraits — and she saw Grandma’s new scarlet felt rain-cape lying there and put it\n",
      "\f",
      "on when no one was looking. Of course, it was much too big and much too long for\n",
      "her, so she hitched it up and tied it round her waist with a sash and went out like that\n",
      "into the back courtyard to help the maids build a snowman. And then she slipped\n",
      "over in it and got covered all over with mud—’\n",
      "The others all laughed at the recollection.\n",
      "Bao-chai asked Xiang-yun’s nurse, Mrs Zhou, whether Xiang-yun was still as\n",
      "tomboyish as ever. Nurse Zhou laughed but said nothing.\n",
      "‘I don’t mind her being tomboyish,’ said Ying-chun, ‘but I do wish she wasn’t such a\n",
      "chatterbox. You wouldn’t believe it — even when she’s in bed at night it still goes on.\n",
      "Jabber-jabber, jabber-jabber. Then she laughs. Then she talks a bit more. Then she\n",
      "laughs again. And you never heard such a lot of rubbish in your life, I don’t know\n",
      "where she gets it all from.’\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps she’ll have got over that by now,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I hear that\n",
      "someone was round the other day to talk about a betrothal. Now that there’s a\n",
      "future mother-in-law to think about, she can’t be quite as tomboyish as she used to\n",
      "be.’\n",
      "‘Are you staying this time, or do you have to go back to?night?’ asked Grandmother\n",
      "Jia.\n",
      "‘Your Old Ladyship hasn’t seen all the clothes she’s brought,’ said Nurse Zhou.\n",
      "‘She’ll be staying two days here at the very least.’\n",
      "‘Isn’t Bao at home?’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Listen to her!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Bao is the only one she thinks about. He and\n",
      "she get on well together because they are both fond of mischief. You can see she\n",
      "hasn’t really changed.’\n",
      "‘Perhaps now that you’re getting older you had better stop using baby-names,’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, reminded by the talk of betrothal that her babies were rapidly\n",
      "turning into grown-ups.\n",
      "Just then Bao-yu came in.\n",
      "‘Ah! Hallo, Yun! Why didn’t you come when we sent for you the other day?’\n",
      "‘Grandmother has just this moment been saying that it is time you all stopped\n",
      "using baby-names,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I must say, this isn’t a very good beginning.’\n",
      "‘Our cousin has got something nice to give you,’ said Dai?-yu to Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Oh? What is it?’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Don’t believe her,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Goodness! It’s no time since you were here last,\n",
      "but you seem to have grown taller already.’\n",
      "Xiang-yun laughed.\n",
      "‘How’s Aroma?’\n",
      "‘She’s fine. Thank you for asking.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I’ve brought something for her,’ said Xiang-yun. She produced a knotted-up silk\n",
      "handkerchief.\n",
      "‘What treasure have you got wrapped up in there?’ said Bao-yu. ‘The best present\n",
      "you could have brought Aroma would have been a couple of those cheap agate rings\n",
      "like the ones you sent us the other day.’\n",
      "‘What are these, then?’\n",
      "With a triumphant smile she opened her little bundle and revealed four rings, each\n",
      "inset with the veined red agate they had so much admired on a previous occasion.\n",
      "‘What a girl!’ said Dai-yu. ‘These are exactly the same as the ones you sent us the\n",
      "other day by messenger. Why didn’t you get him to bring these too and save yourself\n",
      "some trouble? I thought you must have got some wonderful rarity tied up in that\n",
      "handkerchief, seeing that you’d gone to all the trouble of bringing it here yourself —\n",
      "and all the time it was only a few more of those! You really are rather a silly.’\n",
      "‘Thilly yourthelf!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The others can decide which of us is the silly one\n",
      "when I have explained my reason. If I send things for you and the girls, it’s assumed\n",
      "that they are for you without the messenger even needing to say any?thing; but if I\n",
      "send things for any of the maids, I have to explain very carefully to the messenger\n",
      "which ones I mean. Now if the messenger is someone intelligent, that’s all right; but\n",
      "if it’s someone not so bright who has difficulty in remembering names, they’ll\n",
      "probably make such a mess of it that they’ll get not only the maids’ presents mixed\n",
      "up, but yours as well. Then again, if the messenger is a woman, it’s not so bad; but\n",
      "the other day it was one of the boys - and you know how hopeless they are over girls’\n",
      "names. So you see, I thought it would be simpler if I delivered the maids’ ones myself.\n",
      "There!’— she laid the rings down one after another on the table — ‘One for Aroma;\n",
      "one for Faithful; one for Golden; and one for Patience. Can you imagine one of the\n",
      "boys getting those four names right?’\n",
      "The others laughed.\n",
      "‘Clever! Clever!’ they said.\n",
      "‘You’re always so eloquent,’ said Bao-yu. ‘No one else gets a chance.’\n",
      "‘If she weren’t so eloquent, she wouldn’t be worthy of the gold kylin,’ said Dai-yu\n",
      "huffily, rising from her seat and walk?ing off as she spoke.\n",
      "Fortunately no one heard her but Ban-chai, who made a laughing grimace, and\n",
      "Bao-yu, who immediately regretted having once more spoken out of turn, but who,\n",
      "suddenly catching sight of Bao-chai’s expression, could not help laugh?ing himself.\n",
      "Seeing him laugh, Bao-chai at once rose from her seat and hurried off to joke with\n",
      "Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘When you’ve finished your tea and rested a bit,’ said Grandmother Jia to Xiang-yun,\n",
      "‘you can go and see your married cousins. After that, you can amuse yourself in the\n",
      "\f",
      "Garden with the girls. It’s nice and cool there.’\n",
      "Xiang-yun thanked her grandmother. She wrapped up three of the rings again, and\n",
      "after sitting a little longer, went off, attended by her nannies and maids, to call on\n",
      "Wang Xi-?feng. After chatting a while with her, she went into the Gar?den and called\n",
      "on Li Wan. Then, after sitting a short while with Li Wan, she went off in the direction\n",
      "of Green Delights in quest of Aroma. Before doing so, however, she turned to\n",
      "dis?miss her escort.\n",
      "‘You needn’t stay with me any longer,’ she said. ‘You can go off now and visit your\n",
      "relations. I’ll just keep Fishy to wait on me.\n",
      "The others thanked her and went off to look for various kith and kin, leaving\n",
      "Xiang-yun alone with Kingfisher.\n",
      "‘Why aren’t these water-lilies out yet?’ said Kingfisher.\n",
      "‘It isn’t time for them yet,’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Look, they’re going to be “double-decker” ones, like the ones in our lily-pond at\n",
      "home,’ said Kingfisher.\n",
      "‘Our ones are better,’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘They’ve got a pomegranate-tree here which has four or five lots of flowers growing\n",
      "one above the other on each branch,’ said Kingfisher. ‘That’s a\n",
      "double-double-double?-decker. I wonder what makes them grow like that.’\n",
      "‘Plants are the same as people,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The healthier their constitution is,\n",
      "the better they grow.’\n",
      "‘I don’t believe that,’ said Kingfisher with a toss of her head. ‘If that were so, why\n",
      "don’t we see people walking around with one head growing on top of the other?’\n",
      "Xiang-yun was unable to avoid laughing at the girl’s sim?plicity.\n",
      "‘I’ve told you before, you talk too much,’ she said. ‘Let’s see: how can one answer a\n",
      "question like that? Everything in the world is moulded by the forces of Yin and Yang.\n",
      "That means that, besides the normal, the abnormal, the peculiar, the freakish — in\n",
      "fact all the thousands and thousands of different variations we find in things — are\n",
      "caused by different combina?tions of Yin and Yang. Even if something appears that is\n",
      "so rare that no one has ever seen it before, the principle is still the same.’\n",
      "‘So according to what you say,’ said Kingfisher, ‘all the things that have ever existed,\n",
      "from the time the world began right up to the present moment, have just been a lot\n",
      "of Yins and Yangs.’\n",
      "‘No, stupid!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The more you say, the sil?lier you get. “Just a lot of\n",
      "Yins and Yangs” indeed! In any case, strictly speaking Yin and Yang are not two things\n",
      "but one and the same thing. By the time the Yang has become exhausted, it is Yin;\n",
      "and by the time the Yin has become exhausted, it is Yang. It isn’t a case of one of\n",
      "them coming to an end and then the other one growing out of nothing.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘That’s too deep for me,’ said Kingfisher. ‘What sort of thing is a Yin-yang, I’d like to\n",
      "know? No one’s ever seen one. You just answer that, Miss. What does a Yin-yang look\n",
      "like?’\n",
      "‘Yin-yang is a sort of force,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It’s the force in things that gives them\n",
      "their distinctive forms. For example, the sky is Yang and the earth is Yin; water is Yin\n",
      "and fire is Yang; the sun is Yang and the moon is Yin.’\n",
      "‘Ah yes! Now I understand,’ said Kingfisher happily. ‘That’s why astrologers call the\n",
      "sun the “Yang star” and the moon the “Yin star”.’\n",
      "‘Holy Name!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘She understands.’\n",
      "‘That’s not so difficult,’ said Kingfisher. ‘But what about things like mosquitoes and\n",
      "fleas and midges and plants and flowers and bricks and tiles? Surely you are not\n",
      "going to say that they are all Yin-yang too?’\n",
      "‘Certainly they are!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Take the leaf of a tree, for example. That’s\n",
      "divided into Yin and Yang. The side facing upwards towards the sky is Yang; the\n",
      "underside, facing towards the ground, is Yin.’\n",
      "Kingfisher nodded.\n",
      "‘I see. Yes. I can understand that. But take these fans we are holding. Surely they\n",
      "don’t have Yin and Yang?’\n",
      "‘Yes they do. The front of the fan is Yang; the back of the fan is Yin.’\n",
      "Kingfisher nodded, satisfied. She tried to think of some other object to ask about, but\n",
      "being for the moment unable to, she began looking around her for inspiration. As she\n",
      "did so, her eye chanced to light on the gold kylin fastened in the intricate loopings of\n",
      "her mistress’s girdle.\n",
      "‘Well, Miss,’ she said, pointing triumphantly to the kylin, you’re not going to say\n",
      "that that’s got Yin and Yang?\n",
      "‘Certainly. In the case of birds and beasts the males are Yang and the females are\n",
      "Yin.’\n",
      "‘Is this a daddy one or a mummy one?’ said Kingfisher.\n",
      "‘“A daddy one or a mummy one”! Silly girl!’\n",
      "‘All right, then,’ said Kingfisher. ‘But why is it that everything else has Yin and Yang\n",
      "but we haven’t?’\n",
      "‘Get along with you, naughty girl! What subject will you get on to next?’\n",
      "‘Why? Why can’t you tell me?’ said Kingfisher. ‘Anyway, I know; so there’s no need\n",
      "for you to be so nasty to me.’\n",
      "Xiang-yun suppressed a giggle.\n",
      "‘You’re Yang and I’m Yin,’ said Kingfisher.\n",
      "Xiang-yun held her handkerchief to her mouth and laughed ‘Well, that’s right, isn’t\n",
      "it?’ said Kingfisher. ‘What are you laughing at?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘That’s quite right.’\n",
      "‘That’s what they always say,’ said Kingfisher: ‘the master is Yang and the servant is\n",
      "Yin. Even I can understand that principle.’\n",
      "‘I’m sure you can,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Very good.’\n",
      "While they were talking, a glittering golden object at the foot of the rose pergola\n",
      "caught Xiang-yun’s eye. She pointed it out to Kingfisher.\n",
      "‘Go and see what it is,’\n",
      "Kingfisher bounded over and picked it up.\n",
      "‘Ah ha!’ she said, examining the object in her hand. ‘Now we shall be able to see\n",
      "whether it’s Yin or Yang.’\n",
      "She took hold of the kylin fastened to Xiang-yun’s girdle and held it up to look at it\n",
      "more closely. Xiang-yun wanted to see what it was that she held in her hand, but\n",
      "Kingfisher wouldn’t let her.\n",
      "‘It’s my treasure,’ she said with a laugh. ‘I won’t let you see it, Miss. Funny, though.\n",
      "I wonder where it came from. I’ve never seen anyone here wearing it.’\n",
      "‘Come on! Let me look,’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘There you are, Miss!’ Kingfisher opened her hand.\n",
      "Xiang-yun looked. It was a beautiful, shining gold kylin, both larger and more ornate\n",
      "than the one she was wearing. Reach?ing out and taking it from Kingfisher, she held\n",
      "it on the palm of her hand and contemplated it for some moments in silence.\n",
      "Whatever reverie the contemplation inspired was broken by the sudden arrival of\n",
      "Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘What are you doing, standing out here in the blazing sun?’ he asked her. ‘Why\n",
      "don’t you go and see Aroma?’\n",
      "‘We were on our way,’ said Xiang-yun, hurriedly conceal?ing the gold kylin.\n",
      "The three of them entered the courtyard of Green Delights together.\n",
      "Aroma had gone outside to take the air and was leaning on the verandah railings at\n",
      "the foot of the front door steps. As soon as she caught sight of Xiang-yun, she hurried\n",
      "down into the courtyard to welcome her, and taking her by the hand, led her into the\n",
      "house, animatedly exchanging news with her as they went.\n",
      "‘You should have come sooner,’ said Bao-yu when they were indoors and Aroma\n",
      "had made Xiang-yun take a seat. ‘I’ve got something nice for you here and I’ve been\n",
      "waiting for you to come so that I could give it to you.’\n",
      "He had been hunting through his pockets as he said this. Not finding what he was\n",
      "searching for, he exclaimed in sur?prise.\n",
      "‘Aiyo!’ He turned to Aroma. ‘Have you put it away some?where?’\n",
      "‘Put what away?’\n",
      "‘That little kylin I got the other day.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘You’ve been carrying it around with you everywhere,’ said Aroma. ‘Why ask me\n",
      "about it?’\n",
      "Bao-yu clapped his hands together in vexation.\n",
      "‘Oh, I’ve lost it! Wherever am I going to look for it?’\n",
      "He got up to begin searching.\n",
      "Xiang-yun now realized that it must have been Bao-yu who dropped the kylin she had\n",
      "only a few minutes earlier dis?covered outside.\n",
      "‘Since when have you had a kylin?’ she asked him. ‘Oh, several days now,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu. ‘What a shame! I’ll never get another one like that. And the trouble is, I don’t\n",
      "know when I can have lost it. Oh dear! How stupid of me!’\n",
      "‘It’s only an ornament you’re getting so upset about,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What a good\n",
      "job it wasn’t something more serious!’\n",
      "She opened her hand:\n",
      "‘Look! Is that it?’\n",
      "Bao-yu looked and saw, with extravagant delight, that it was.\n",
      "The remainder of this episode will be told in the following chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 32\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu demonstrates confusion of mind by making his\n",
      "declaration to the wrong person\n",
      "And Golden shows an unconquerable spirit by ending her\n",
      "humiliation in death\n",
      "\n",
      "OUR last chapter told of Bao-yu’s delight at seeing the gold kylin again. He reached\n",
      "out eagerly and took it from Xiang-?yun’s hand.\n",
      "‘Fancy your finding it!’ he said. ‘How did you come to pick it up?’\n",
      "‘It’s a good job it was only this you lost,’ she said. ‘One of these days it will be your\n",
      "seal of office — and then it won’t be quite so funny.’\n",
      "‘Oh, losing one’s seal of office is nothing,’ said Bao-yu. Losing a thing like this is\n",
      "much more serious.’\n",
      "Aroma meanwhile was pouring tea.\n",
      "‘I heard your good news the other day,’ she said, handing Xiang-yun a cup.\n",
      "‘Congratulations!’\n",
      "Xiang-yun bent low over the cup to hide her blushes and made no reply.\n",
      "‘Why so bashful, Miss?’ said Aroma. ‘Have you forgotten the things you used to tell\n",
      "me at night all those years ago, when we used to sleep together in the little\n",
      "closet-bed at Her Old Ladyship’s? You weren’t very bashful then. What makes you so\n",
      "bashful with me now, all of a sudden?’\n",
      "Xiang-yun’s face became even redder. She gave a forced little laugh.\n",
      "‘Who’s talking? That was a time when you and I were very close to each other.\n",
      "Then I had to go back home when my uncle’s first wife died and you were given\n",
      "Cousin Bao to look after, and I don’t know why, but whenever I came back here after\n",
      "that, you seemed somehow changed towards me.’\n",
      "It was now Aroma’s turn to blush and protest.\n",
      "‘When you first came to live here it was “Pearl dear this” and “Pearl dear that” all\n",
      "the time. You were always coaxing me to do things for you — do your hair, wash your\n",
      "face, or I don’t know what. But now that’s all changed. Now you’re the young lady,\n",
      "aren’t you? You can’t act the young lady with me and expect me to stay on the same\n",
      "familiar terms as before.’\n",
      "‘Holy Name!’ said Xiang-yun, now genuinely indignant. ‘That’s tho unfair. I wish I\n",
      "may die if I ever “acted the young lady” with you, as you put it. I come here in this\n",
      "frightful heat, and the very first person I want to see when I get here is you. Ask Fishy\n",
      "if you don’t believe me. She can tell you. At home I’m always going on about you.’\n",
      "Aroma and Bao-yu both laughed.\n",
      "‘Don’t take it to heart so, it was only a joke. You shouldn’t be so excitable.’\n",
      "‘Don’t, whatever you do, admit that what you said was wounding,’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Say I’m “excitable” and put me in the wrong!’\n",
      "While she said this, she was undoing the knotted silk hand-kerchief and extracting\n",
      "one of the three rings from it. She handed it to Aroma. Aroma was greatly touched.\n",
      "‘I’ve got one like this already,’ she said. ‘It was given to me when you sent those\n",
      "ones the other day to the young ladies. But fancy your bringing this one here\n",
      "specially! Now I know you haven’t forgotten me. It’s little things like this that show\n",
      "you what a person really is. The ring itself isn’t worth much, I know. It’s the thought\n",
      "behind it.’\n",
      "‘Who gave you the one you’ve already got?’ said Xiang-?yun.\n",
      "‘Miss Bao,’ said Aroma.\n",
      "‘Ah,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘Miss Bao. And I was thinking it must have been Miss Lin.\n",
      "Often when I’m at home I think to myself that of all my cousins Bao-chai is the one I\n",
      "like best. It’s a pity we couldn’t have been born of the same mother. With her for an\n",
      "elder sister it wouldn’t matter so much being an orphan.’\n",
      "Her eyelids reddened as she said this and she seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n",
      "‘Now, now, now!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t say things like that.’\n",
      "‘And why not?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Oh, I know your trouble. You’re afraid that Cousin\n",
      "Lin might hear and get angry with me again for praising Cousin Bao. That’s what’s\n",
      "worrying you, isn’t it?’\n",
      "Aroma giggled.\n",
      "‘Oh Miss Yun! You’re just as outspoken as you used to be.’\n",
      "‘Well, I’ve said that you lot are difficult to talk to,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and I was certainly\n",
      "right!’\n",
      "‘Don’t make me sick,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘You say what you like to us. It’s with your\n",
      "Cousin Lin that you have to be so careful.’\n",
      "‘Never mind about that,’ said Aroma. ‘Joking apart, now: I want to ask you a favour.’\n",
      "‘What is it?’ said Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘I’ve got a pair of slipper-tops here that I’ve already cut the openwork pattern in,\n",
      "but as I haven’t been very well this last day or two, I haven’t been able to sew them\n",
      "on to the backing material. Do you think you’d have time to do them for me?’\n",
      "‘That’s rather a strange request,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Quite apart from all the clever\n",
      "maids this household employs you have your own full-time tailors and embroiderers.\n",
      "Why ask me to do your sewing? You could give it to anyone here you liked. They\n",
      "could hardly refuse you.’\n",
      "‘You can’t be serious,’ said Aroma. ‘None of the sewing in this room is allowed to go\n",
      "outside. Surely you knew that?’\n",
      "Xiang-yun inferred from this that the slippers in question were for Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Oh well,’ she said, ‘in that case I suppose I’d better do them for you. On one\n",
      "\f",
      "condition, though: I’ll do them if they are for you to wear, but if they are for anyone\n",
      "else, I’m afraid I can’t.’\n",
      "‘Get along with you!’ said Aroma. ‘Ask you to make slippers for me? I wouldn’t have\n",
      "the nerve. No, I’ll be honest with you, they’re not for me. Never mind who they’re for.\n",
      "Just tell yourself that I’m the one you’ll be doing the favour.’\n",
      "‘It isn’t that,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘In the past I’ve done lots of things for you. Surely you\n",
      "must know what makes me un?willing now?’\n",
      "‘I’m sorry, I don’t,’ said Aroma.\n",
      "‘What about the person who got in a temper the other day when that fan-case I\n",
      "made for you was compared with hers and cut it up with a pair of scissors? I heard all\n",
      "about that, so don’t start protesting. If you expect me to do sewing for you after that,\n",
      "you’re just treating me as your drudge.’\n",
      "‘I didn’t know at the time it was you who made it,’ Bao-yu put in hurriedly.\n",
      "‘He really didn’t,’ said Aroma. ‘I pretended there was some?one outside we’d just\n",
      "discovered who could do very fine and original needlework. I told him I’d got them to\n",
      "do that fan?-case for him as a sample. He believed what I said and went around\n",
      "showing it to everyone. Unfortunately while he was doing this he upset you know\n",
      "who and she took a pair of scissors and cut it in pieces. Afterwards he was very\n",
      "anxious to have some more work done by the same person, so I had to tell him who\n",
      "it really was. He was very upset when he heard that it was you.’\n",
      "‘I still think this is a very strange request,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘If Miss Lin can cut things\n",
      "up, she can sew them for him, too. Why not ask her to do them for you?’\n",
      "‘Oh, she wouldn’t want to do them,’ said Aroma. ‘And even if she did, Her Old\n",
      "Ladyship wouldn’t let her, for fear of her tiring herself. The doctors say she needs rest\n",
      "and quiet. I wouldn’t want to trouble her with them. Last year she took practically\n",
      "the whole year embroidering one little purse, and this last six months I don’t think\n",
      "she’s picked up a needle.’\n",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by a servant with a message:\n",
      "‘Mr Jia of Rich Street is here. The Master says will Master Bao receive him, please?’\n",
      "Recognizing the ‘Mr Jia’ of the message as Jia Yu-cun, Bao-yu was more than a little\n",
      "vexed. While Aroma hurried off for his going-out clothes, he sat pulling his boots on\n",
      "and grumbling.\n",
      "‘He’s got Father to talk to, surely that’s enough for him? Why does he always have\n",
      "to see me?’\n",
      "Xiang-yun laughed at his disgruntlement:\n",
      "‘I’m sure you’re very good at entertaining people,’ she said. ‘That’s why Sir Zheng\n",
      "asks you to see him.’\n",
      "‘That message didn’t come from Father,’ said Bao-yu. ‘He’ll have made it up\n",
      "\f",
      "himself.’\n",
      "‘“When the host is refined, the callers are frequent,”’ said Xiang-yun. ‘There must\n",
      "be something about you that has impressed him, otherwise he wouldn’t want to see\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "‘I make no claim to being refined, thanks all the same,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m as common\n",
      "as dirt. And furthermore I have no wish to mix with people of his sort.’\n",
      "‘You’re incorrigible,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Now that you’re older, you ought to be mixing\n",
      "with these officials and ad?ministrators as much as you can. Even if you don’t want to\n",
      "take the Civil Service examinations and become an adminis?trator yourself, you can\n",
      "learn a lot from talking to these people about the way the Empire is governed and\n",
      "the people who govern it that will stand you in good stead later on, when you come\n",
      "to manage your own affairs and take your place in society. You might even pick up\n",
      "one or two decent, respect?able friends that way. You’ll certainly never get anywhere\n",
      "if you spend all your time with us girls.’\n",
      "Bao-yu found such talk highly displeasing.\n",
      "‘I think perhaps you’d better go and sit in someone else’s room,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t\n",
      "want a decent, respectable young lady like you to get contaminated.’\n",
      "‘Don’t try reasoning with him, Miss,’ Aroma put in hur?riedly. ‘Last time Miss Bao\n",
      "tried it, he was just as rude to her. No consideration for her feelings whatever. He just\n",
      "said “Hai!”, picked up his heels, and walked out of the room, leaving her still half-way\n",
      "through her sentence. Poor Miss Bao! She was so embarrassed she turned bright red.\n",
      "She didn’t know what to say. A good job it was her, though, and not Miss Lin. If it had\n",
      "been Miss Lin, there’d have been weeping and carrying on and I don’t know what. I\n",
      "really admire the way Miss Bao behaved on that occasion. She just stood there a\n",
      "while collecting herself and then walked quietly out of the room. Myself, I was quite\n",
      "upset, thinking she must be offended. But not a bit of it. Next time she came round,\n",
      "it was just as if nothing had happened. A real little lady, Miss Bao — and\n",
      "generous-hearted, too. And yet the funny thing is that his lordship seems to have\n",
      "fallen out with her, whereas Miss Lin, who is always getting on her high horse and\n",
      "ignoring him, has him running round and apologizing to her all the time.’\n",
      "‘Have you ever heard Miss Lin talking that sort of stupid rubbish?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’d\n",
      "long since have fallen out with her if she did.’\n",

      "Dai-yu rightly surmised that now Xiang-yun had arrived, Bao-yu would lose no time in\n",
      "\f",
      "telling her about his newly? acquired kylin.\n",
      "Now Dai-yu had observed that in the romances which Bao-yu smuggled in to her and\n",
      "of which she was nowadays an avid consumer, it was always some trinket or small\n",
      "object of clothing or jewellery a pair of lovebirds, a male and female phoenix, a jade\n",
      "ring, a gold buckle, a silken handker?chief, an embroidered belt or what not — that\n",
      "brought the heroes and heroines together. And since the fate and future happiness of\n",
      "those fortunate beings seemed to depend wholly on the instrumentality of such\n",
      "trifling objects, it was natural for her to suppose that Bao-yu’s acquisition of the gold\n",
      "kylin would become the occasion of a dramatic rupture with her and the beginning of\n",
      "an association with Xiang-yun in which he and Xiang-yun would do together all those\n",

      "It was with such apprehensions that she made her way stealthily towards Green\n",

      "telling Xiang-yun that ‘Cousin Lin never talked that sort of rubbish’ and that if she did\n",
      "he would have ‘fallen out with her long ago’. Mingled emotions of happiness, alarm,\n",
      "sorrow and regret assailed her.\n",
      "Happiness:\n",
      "Because after all (she thought) I wasn’t mistaken in my judgement of you. I always\n",
      "thought of you as a true friend, and I was right.\n",
      "Alarm:\n",
      "Because if you praise me so unreservedly in front of other people, your warmth and\n",
      "affection are sure, sooner or later, to excite suspicion and be misunderstood.\n",
      "Regret:\n",
      "Because if you are my true friend, then I am yours and the two of us are a perfect\n",
      "match. But in that case why did there have to be all this talk of ‘the gold and the jade’?\n",
      "Alternatively, if there had to be all this talk of gold and jade, why weren’t we the two\n",
      "to have them? Why did there have to be a Bao-chai with her golden locket?\n",
      "Sorrow:\n",
      "Because though there are things of burning importance to be said, without a father\n",
      "or a mother I have no one to say them for me. And besides, I feel so muzzy lately and\n",
      "I know that my illness is gradually gaining a hold on me. (The doctors say that the\n",
      "weakness and anaemia I suffer from may be the beginnings of a consumption.) So\n",
      "even if I am your true love, I fear I may not be able to wait for you. And even though\n",
      "you are mine, you can do nothing to alter my fate.\n",
      "At that point in her reflections she began to weep; and feel?ing in no fit state to be\n",

      "‘Where are you off to, coz? Are you crying again? Who has upset you this time?’\n",

      "‘The day before yesterday she broke something of mine,’ said Lady Wang, ‘and in a\n",
      "moment of anger I struck her a couple of times and sent her back to her mother’s. I\n",
      "had only been meaning to leave her there a day or two to punish her. After that I\n",
      "would have had her back again. I never dreamed that she would be so angry with me\n",

      "more likely that she was playing about beside the well and slipped in accidentally.\n",
      "While she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for\n",
      "her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside. There’s no\n",
      "earthly reason why she should have felt angry enough with you to drown herself. If\n",

      "‘I’m sure you have no cause, Aunt,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but if you feel very much\n",
      "distressed, I suggest that you simply give her family a little extra for the funeral. In\n",
      "that way you will more than fulfill any moral obligation you may have towards her as\n",
      "a mistress.’\n",
      "‘I have just given her mother fifty taels,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I wanted to give her two\n",

      "Golden was only a servant, she had been with me so long that she had become\n",
      "almost like a daughter to me.’\n",
      "She began to cry again as she said this.\n",
      "‘There’s no need to hurry the tailors about this,’ said Bao-?chai. ‘I’ve got two new\n",
      "outfits that I recently finished making for myself. Why not let her mother have them\n",
      "and save them the trouble? Golden once or twice wore old dresses of mine in the\n",

      "yourself little good by forcing me to mention it in front of your father. You say you\n",
      "don’t know who Bijou is. Very well. Then will you kindly explain how his red\n",
      "cummerbund came to find its way around your waist?’\n",
      "Bao-yu stared at him open-mouthed, too stunned to reply.\n",
      "‘If he knows even a private thing like that,’ he thought, ‘there’s little likelihood of\n",
      "my being able to hoodwink him about anything else. I’d better get rid of him as\n",
      "quickly as possible, before he can say any more.’\n",
      "‘Since you have managed to find out so much about him,’ he said, finding his\n",
      "tongue at last, ‘I’m surprised that so im?portant a thing as buying a house should\n",
      "have escaped you. From what I’ve heard, he recently acquired a little villa and an\n",
      "acre or so of land at Fort Redwood, seven miles east of the walls. I suppose he could\n",
      "be there.’\n",
      "The chamberlain smiled.\n",
      "‘If you say so, then no doubt that is where we shall find him. I shall go and look\n",
      "there immediately. If I do find him there, you will hear no more from me; if not, I\n",
      "shall be back again for further instructions.’\n",
      "So saying, he hurriedly took his leave.\n",
      "Jia Zheng, his eyes glaring and his mouth contorted with rage, went after the\n",
      "chamberlain to see him out. He turned briefly towards Bao-yu as he was leaving the\n",
      "hall.\n",
      "‘You stay where you are. I shall deal with you when I get back.’\n",
      "As he was on his way in again after seeing the chamberlain off the premises, Jia Huan\n",
      "with two or three pages at his heels came stampeding across the courtyard.\n",
      "‘Hit that boy!’ Jia Zheng shouted, outraged. But Jia Huan, reduced to a quivering\n",
      "jelly of fear by the sight of his father, had already jolted to a halt and was standing\n",
      "with bowed head in front of him.\n",
      "‘And what is the meaning of this?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What has become of the people\n",
      "\f",
      "who are supposed to look after you? Why do they allow you to gallop around in this\n",
      "extraordinary fashion?’ His voice rose to a shout: ‘Where are the people responsible\n",
      "for taking this boy to school?’\n",
      "Jia Huan saw in his father’s anger an opportunity of exer?cising his malice.\n",
      "‘I didn’t mean to run, Father, but just as I was going by the well back there I saw the\n",
      "body of a maid who had drowned herself — all swollen up with water, and her head\n",
      "all swollen. It was horrible. I just couldn’t help myself.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng heard him with incredulous horror.\n",
      "‘What are you saying? Who has drowned herself? Such a thing has never before\n",
      "happened in our family. Our family has always been lenient and considerate in its\n",
      "treatment of in?feriors. It is one of our traditions. I suppose it is because I have been\n",
      "too neglectful of household matters during these last few years. Those in charge have\n",
      "felt encouraged to abuse their authority, until finally an appalling thing like this can\n",
      "happen an innocent young life cut off by violence. What a terrible dis?grace to our\n",
      "ancestors if this should get about!’ He turned and shouted a command.\n",
      "‘Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da!’\n",
      "‘Sir!’ chorused the pages, and were on the point of doing so when Jia Huan\n",
      "impulsively stepped forward, threw himself on his knees and clung to his father’s\n",
      "skirts.\n",
      "‘Don’t be angry with me, Father, but apart from the ser?vants in Lady Wang’s room,\n",
      "no one else knows anything about this. I heard my mother say -’\n",
      "He broke off and glanced around behind him. Jia Zheng understood and signaled with\n",
      "his eyes to the pages, who obediently withdrew some distance back to either side of\n",
      "the courtyard. Jia Huan continued in a voice lowered almost to a whisper.\n",
      "‘My mother told me that the day before yesterday, in Lady Wang’s room, my\n",
      "brother Bao-yu tried to rape one of Her Ladyship’s maids called Golden, and when\n",
      "she wouldn’t let him, he gave her a beating; and Golden was so upset that she threw\n",
      "herself in the well and was drowned --’\n",
      "Jia Zheng, whose face had now turned to a ghastly gold-leaf colour, interrupted him\n",
      "with a dreadful cry.\n",
      "‘Fetch Bao-yu!’\n",
      "He began to stride towards his study, shouting to all and sundry as he went.\n",
      "‘If anyone tries to stop me this time, I shall make over my house and property and\n",
      "my post at the Ministry and every?thing else I have to him and Bao-yu. I absolutely\n",
      "refuse to be responsible for the boy any longer. I shall cut off my few remaining hairs\n",
      "(those that worry and wretchedness have left me) and look for some clean and\n",
      "decent spot to end my days in. Perhaps in that way I shall escape the charge of\n",
      "having dis?graced my ancestors by rearing this unnatural monster as my son.’\n",
      "\f",
      "When they saw the state he was in, the literary gentlemen and senior menservants\n",
      "who were waiting for him in the study, guessed that Bao-yu must be the cause of it\n",
      "and, looking at each other with various grimaces, biting their thumbs or sticking their\n",
      "tongues out, hastily retreated from the room. Jia-Zheng entered it alone and sat\n",
      "down, stiffly upright, in a chair. He was breathing heavily and his face was bathed in\n",
      "tears. Presently, when he had regained his breath, he barked out a rapid series of\n",
      "commands:\n",
      "‘Bring Bao-yu here. Get a heavy bamboo. Get some rope to tie him with. Close the\n",
      "courtyard gates. If anyone tries to take word through inside, kill him!’\n",
      "‘Sir! — Sir! — Sir!’ the terrified pages chorused in unison at each of his commands,\n",
      "and some of them went off to look for Bao-yu.\n",
      "Jia Zheng’s ominous ‘Stay where you are’ as he went out with the chamberlain had\n",
      "warned Bao-yu that something dire was imminent — though just how much more\n",
      "dire as a result of Jia Huan’s malicious intervention he could not have foreseen and as\n",
      "he stood where his father had left him, he twisted and turned himself about,\n",
      "anxiously looking for some passer-by who could take a message through to the\n",
      "womenfolk inside. But no one came. Even the omnipresent Tealeaf was on this\n",
      "occasion nowhere to be seen. Then suddenly, in answer to his prayers, an old woman\n",
      "appeared — a darling, precious treasure of an old woman (or so she seemed at that\n",
      "moment) — and he dashed forward and clung to her beseechingly.\n",
      "‘Quickly!’ he said. ‘Go and tell them that Sir Zheng is going to beat me. Quickly!\n",
      "Quickly! Goand tell. GO AND TELL.’\n",
      "Partly because agitation had made him incoherent and partly because, as ill luck\n",
      "would have it, the old woman was deaf, almost everything he said had escaped her\n",
      "except for the ‘Go and tell’, which she misheard as ‘in the well’. She smiled at him\n",
      "reassuringly.\n",
      "‘Let her jump in the well then, young master. Don’t you worry your pretty head\n",
      "about it!’\n",
      "Realizing that he had deafness, too, to contend with, he now became quite frantic.\n",
      "‘GO AND TELL MY PAGES.’\n",
      "‘Her wages?’ the old woman asked in some surprise. ‘Bless you, of course they paid\n",
      "her wages! Her Ladyship gave a whole lot of money towards the funeral as well. And\n",
      "clothes. Paid her wages, indeed!’\n",
      "Bao-yu stamped his feet in a frenzy of impatience. He was still wondering\n",
      "despairingly how to make her understand when Jia Zheng’s pages arrived and forced\n",
      "him to go with them to the study.\n",
      "Jia Zheng turned a pair of wild and bloodshot eyes on him as he entered. Forgetting\n",
      "the ‘riotous and dissipated conduct abroad leading to the unseemly bestowal of\n",
      "\f",
      "impudicities on a theatrical performer’ and the ‘neglect of proper pursuits and\n",
      "studies at home culminating in the attempted violation of a parent’s maidservant’\n",
      "and all the other high-sounding charges he had been preparing to hurl against him,\n",
      "he shouted two brief orders to the pages.\n",
      "‘Gag his mouth. Beat him to death.’\n",
      "The pages were too frightened not to comply. Two held Bao-yu face downwards on a\n",
      "bench while a third lifted up the flattened bamboo sweep and began to strike him\n",
      "with it across the hams. After about a dozen blows Jia Zheng, not satisfied that his\n",
      "executioner was hitting hard enough, kicked him impatiently aside, wrested the\n",
      "bamboo from his grasp, and, gritting his teeth, brought it down with the utmost\n",
      "savagery on the places that had already been beaten.\n",
      "At this point the literary gentlemen, sensing that Bao-yu was in serious danger of life\n",
      "and limb, came in again to remonstrate; but Jia Zheng refused to hear them.\n",
      "‘Ask him what he has done and then tell me if you think I should spare him,’ he said.\n",
      "‘It is the encouragement of people like you that has corrupted him; and now, when\n",
      "things have come to this pass, you intercede for him. I suppose you would like me to\n",
      "wait until he commits parricide, or worse. Would you still intercede for him then?’\n",
      "They could see from this reply that he was beside himself. Wasting no further time\n",
      "on words, they quickly withdrew and looked for someone to take a message through\n",
      "inside.\n",
      "Lady Wang did not stop to tell Grandmother Jia when she received it. She snatched\n",
      "up an outer garment, pulled it about her, and, supported by a single maid, rushed off,\n",
      "not caring what menfolk might see her, to the outer study, bursting into it with such\n",
      "suddenness that the literary gentlemen and other males present were unable to\n",
      "avoid her.\n",
      "Her entry provoked Jia Zheng to fresh transports of fury. Faster and harder fell the\n",
      "bamboo on the prostrate form of Bao-yu, which by now appeared to be unconscious,\n",
      "for when the boys holding it down relaxed their hold and fled from their Mistress’s\n",
      "presence, it had long since ceased even to twitch. Even so Jia Zheng would have\n",
      "continued beating it had not Lady Wang clasped the bamboo to her bosom and\n",
      "prevented him.\n",
      "‘Enough!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Today you are determined, all of you, to drive me insane.’\n",
      "‘No doubt Bao-yu deserved to be beaten,’ said Lady Wang tearfully, ‘but it is bad for\n",
      "you to get over excited. Besides, you ought to have some consideration for Lady Jia.\n",
      "She is not at all well in this frightful heat. It may not seem to you of much\n",
      "consequence to kill Bao-yu, but think what the effect would be on her.’\n",
      "‘Don’t try that sort of talk with me!’ said Jia Zheng bitterly. ‘Merely by fathering a\n",
      "monster like this I have proved myself an unfilial son; yet whenever in the past I have\n",
      "\f",
      "tried to disci?pline him, the rest of you have all conspired against me to protect him.\n",
      "Now that I have the opportunity at last, I may as well finish off what I have begun and\n",
      "put him down, like the vermin he is, before he can do any more damage.’\n",
      "So saying, he took up a rope and would have put his threat into execution, had not\n",
      "Lady Wang held her arms around him to prevent it.\n",
      "‘Of course you should discipline your son,’ she said, weep?ing, ‘but you have a wife\n",
      "too, Sir Zheng, don’t forget. I am nearly fifty now and this wretched boy is the only\n",
      "son I have. If you insist on making an example of him, I dare not do much to dissuade\n",
      "you. But to kill him outright that is deliberately to make me childless. Better strangle\n",
      "me first, if you are going to strangle him. Let the two of us die together. At least I\n",
      "shall have some support then in the world to come, if all support in this world is to\n",
      "be denied me!’\n",
      "With these words she threw herself upon Bao-yu’s body and, lifting up her voice,\n",
      "began weeping with noisy abandon. Jia Zheng, who had heard her with a sigh, sank\n",
      "into a chair and himself broke down in a fit of weeping.\n",
      "Presently Lady Wang began to examine the body she was clasping. Bao-yu’s face was\n",
      "ashen, his breathing was scarcely perceptible, and the trousers of thin green silk\n",
      "which clothed the lower part of his body were so soaked with blood that their colour\n",
      "was no longer recognizable. Feverishly she un?fastened his waistband and drew\n",
      "them back. Everywhere, from the upper part of his buttocks down to his calves, was\n",
      "either raw and bloody or purplish black with bruises. Not an inch of sound flesh was\n",
      "to be seen. The sight made her cry out involuntarily.\n",
      "‘Oh my son! My unfortunate son!’\n",
      "Once more she broke down into uncontrollable weeping.\n",
      "Her own words reminded her of the son she had already lost, and now, with added\n",
      "bitterness, she began to call out his name.\n",
      "‘Oh, Zhu! Zhu! If only you had lived, I shouldn’t have minded losing a hundred other\n",
      "sons!’\n",
      "By this time news of Lady Wang’s démarche had circulated to the other members of\n",
      "the inner mansion and Li Wan, Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had come to\n",
      "join her. The invocation of her dead husband’s name, painful to all of them, was\n",
      "altogether too much for Li Wan, who broke into loud sobs on hearing it. Jia Zheng\n",
      "himself was deeply affected, and tears as round as pumpkins rolled down both his\n",
      "cheeks. It was beginning to look as if they might all go on weeping there indefinitely,\n",
      "since no one would make a move; but just then there was a cry of ‘Her Old\n",
      "Ladyship—!’ from one of the maids, interrupted by a quavering voice outside the\n",
      "window.\n",
      "‘Kill me first! You may as well kill both of us while you are about it!’\n",
      "\f",
      "As much distressed by his mother’s words as he was alarmed by her arrival, Jia Zheng\n",
      "hurried out to meet her. She was leaning on the shoulder of a little maid, her old\n",
      "head swaying from side to side with the effort of running, and pant?ing as she ran.\n",
      "Jia Zheng bowed down before her and his face assumed the semblance of a smile.\n",
      "‘Surely, Mother, in such hot weather as this there is no need for you to come here?\n",
      "If you have any instructions, you should call for me and let me come to you.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia had stopped when she heard this voice and now stood panting for\n",
      "some moments while she regained her breath. When she spoke, her voice had an\n",
      "unnatural shrillness in it.\n",
      "‘Oh! Are you speaking to me? — Yes, as a matter of fact I have got instructions”, as\n",
      "you put it; but as unfortunately I’ve never had a good son who cares for me, there’s\n",
      "no one I can give them to.’\n",
      "Wounded in his most sensitive spot, Jia Zheng fell on his knees before her. The voice\n",
      "in which he replied to her was broken with tears.\n",
      "‘How can I bear it, Mother, if you speak to me like that? What I did to the boy I did\n",
      "for the honour of the family.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia spat contemptuously.\n",
      "‘A single harsh word from me and you start whining that you can’t bear it. How do\n",
      "you think Bao-yu could bear your cruel rod? And you say you’ve been punishing him\n",
      "for the honour of the family, but you just tell me this: did your own father ever\n",
      "punish yon in such a way? I think not.’\n",
      "She was weeping now herself.\n",
      "‘Don’t upset yourself, Mother,’ said Jia Zheng, with the same forced smile. ‘I acted\n",
      "too hastily. From now on I’ll never beat him again, if that’s what you wish.’\n",
      "‘Hoity-toity, keep your temper!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘He’s your son. If you want\n",
      "to beat him, that’s up to you. If we women are in your way, we’ll leave you alone to\n",
      "get on with it.’ She turned to her attendants. ‘Call my carriage. Your Mistress and I\n",
      "and Bao-yu are going back to Nanking. We shall be leaving immediately.’\n",
      "The servants made a show of compliance.\n",
      "‘No need for you to cry,’ she said, turning to Lady Wang. ‘You love Bao-yu now that\n",
      "he’s young, but when he’s grown up and become an important official, he’ll like\n",
      "enough forget that you’re his mother. Much better force yourself not to love him\n",
      "now and save yourself some anguish later on.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng threw himself forward on his face.\n",
      "‘Don’t say that, Mother! Don’t reject your own son!’\n",
      "‘On the contrary,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘it is you who have rejected me’. But don’t\n",
      "worry. When I have gone back to Nanking, there will be no one here to stop you. You\n",
      "can beat away to your heart’s content.’ She turned to the servants.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Come on, hurry up with that packing! And get the carriage and horses ready so\n",
      "that we can be on our way.’\n",
      "Jia Zheng’s kotows were by now describing the whole quarter circle from\n",
      "perpendicular to ground. But the old lady walked on inside, ignoring him.\n",
      "From the sight that met her eyes she could tell that this had been no ordinary\n",
      "beating. It filled her with anguish for the sufferer and fresh anger for the man who\n",
      "had inflicted it, and for a long time she clung to the inert form and wept, only\n",
      "gradually calming down under the combined coaxing of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Li\n",
      "Wan.\n",
      "At this point several of the maids and women servants came forward and attempted\n",
      "to raise Bao-yu to his feet.\n",
      "‘Idiots!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Haven’t you got eyes in your heads? Can’t you see that he’s in\n",
      "no fit state to walk? Go and get that wicker summer-bed from inside and carry him in\n",
      "on that.’\n",
      "The servants rushed out and presently reappeared carrying a long, narrow couch of\n",
      "woven rattan between them, on to which they lifted Bao-yu. Then, with\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest of the womenfolk leading the way, they\n",
      "carried him to Grandmother Jia’s apartment and set him down inside it.\n",
      "Jia Zheng, conscious that his mother’s wrath against him had not abated and\n",
      "unwilling to leave things where they stood, had followed the little procession inside.\n",
      "His eyes travelled from Bao-yu, who, he now saw, really had been beaten very badly,\n",
      "to Lady Wang. She was sobbing bitterly, interspersing her sobs with cries of ‘My\n",
      "child!’ and ‘My son!’. Presently she broke off and began railing at the object of her\n",
      "sorrow: ‘Why couldn’t you have died instead of Zhu? Zhu wouldn’t have made his\n",
      "father angry the way you do and I should have been spared this constant anxiety.\n",
      "What is to become of me if you go away and leave me, too?’ Then, with a cry of ‘Poor,\n",
      "worthless boy!’, she fell once more to weeping. When Jia Zheng heard this, his own\n",
      "heart was softened and he began to wish that he had not beaten the boy quite so\n",
      "savagely. He tried to find words of comfort for his old mother, but she answered him\n",
      "tearfully.\n",
      "‘A father ought to punish his son if he’s done wrong, but not like that! — Why don’t\n",
      "you go now? Won’t you be content until you’ve seen the boy die under your own\n",
      "eyes?’\n",
      "Jia Zheng, with flustered deference, withdrew.\n",
      "By now Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and Shi Xiang-yun were there too. Aroma\n",
      "was deeply distressed, but could not show the extent of her feelings in the presence\n",
      "of so many others. Indeed, Bao-yu was so ringed around with people fanning him or\n",
      "forcing water through his lips that there was nothing she could have done for him if\n",
      "\f",
      "she had tried. Feeling somewhat superfluous, she left the apartment and went out to\n",
      "the inner gate, where she asked the pages to look for Tealeaf, so that she could find\n",
      "out what had hap?pened.\n",
      "‘Why did the Master suddenly beat him like that?’ she asked Tealeaf when he\n",
      "arrived. ‘He hadn’t been doing any?thing. And why couldn’t you have warned us in\n",
      "time?’\n",
      "Tealeaf was indignant.\n",
      "‘I couldn’t help it, I wasn’t there. He was half-way through beating him before I\n",
      "even got to hear about it. I did my best to find out the reason, though. It seems that\n",
      "there were two things the Master was upset about: one was to do with Bijou and the\n",
      "other was to do with Golden.’\n",
      "‘How did the Master get to know about them?’ said Aroma. ‘Well, the Bijou\n",
      "business he probably knew about indirectly through Mr Xue,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Mr Xue\n",
      "had been feeling very jealous, and it looks as though he may have put someone else\n",
      "up to telling the Master about it out of spite. And Golden he probably heard about\n",
      "from Master Huan - leastways, that’s what the Master’s own people told me.’\n",
      "The two reasons Tealeaf had given corresponded well enough with Aroma’s own\n",
      "observations, and she was more than half inclined to believe them. Fairly confident,\n",
      "therefore, that she now knew the cause of what had happened, she re?turned once\n",
      "more to the apartment. The ministrations of those surrounding Bao-yu had by now\n",
      "restored him to fall consciousness, and Grandmother Jia was instructing the\n",
      "ser?vants to carry him back to his own room. There was an answering cry and\n",
      "something of a scramble as many willing hands lifted up the cane bed. Then,\n",
      "preceded as before by Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest, they carried him\n",
      "through into the Garden and back to Green Delights, where they finally got him on to\n",
      "his own bed. After a good deal more bustle they gradually all drifted away and Aroma\n",
      "at last had Bao-yu alone to herself.\n",
      "But in order to know what happened then, you must refer to the following chapter.\n",
      "\f",
      "CHAPTER 34\n",
      "\n",
      "A wordless message meets with silent understanding\n",
      "And a groundless imputation leads to undeserved rebukes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEN she saw that Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest had all gone, Aroma\n",
      "went and sat down at Bao-yu’s bed?side and asked him, with tears in her eyes, the\n",
      "reason why he had been beaten so severely.\n",
      "Bao-yu sighed.\n",
      "‘Oh, the usual things. Need you ask? I wish you’d take a look down below, though,\n",
      "and tell me if anything’s broken. It’s hurting so dreadfully down there.’\n",
      "Very gently Aroma inserted her fingers into the top of his trousers and began to draw\n",
      "them off. She had barely started when he gritted his teeth and let out a cry, and she\n",
      "had to stop immediately. This happened three or four times before she finally\n",
      "succeeded in getting them off. The sight revealed made her grit her own teeth.\n",
      "‘Mother of mine!’ she gasped, ‘he must have hit you savagely. If only you’d listened\n",
      "to me a bit in the past, it would never have come to this. Why, you might have been\n",
      "crippled for life. It doesn’t bear thinking of.’\n",
      "Just then Bad-chai’s arrival was announced by one of the maids. Since putting his\n",
      "trousers on again was out of the question, Aroma snatched up a lightweight coverlet\n",
      "and hur?riedly threw it over him. Bao-chai came in carrying a large tablet of some\n",
      "sort of solid medicine which she instructed Aroma to pound up in wine and apply to\n",
      "Bao-yu’s injuries in the evening.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘This is a decongestant,’ she said, handing it to her. ‘It will take away the\n",
      "inflammation by dispersing the bad blood in his bruises. After that, he should heal\n",
      "quite quickly.’\n",
      "She turned to Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Are you feeling any better now?’\n",
      "Bao-yu thanked her. Yes, he said, he was feeling a little better, and invited her to sit\n",
      "down beside him. Bao-chai was relieved to see him with his eyes open and talking\n",
      "again. She shook her head sadly.\n",
      "‘If you had listened to what one said, this would never have happened. Everyone is\n",
      "so upset now. It isn’t only Grandmother and Lady Wang, you know. Even—’\n",
      "She checked herself abruptly, regretting that she had allowed her feelings to run\n",
      "away with her, and lowered her head, blushing. Bao-yu had sensed hidden depths of\n",
      "feeling in the passionate earnestness of her tone, and when she suddenly faltered\n",
      "and turned red, there was something so touching about the pretty air of confusion\n",
      "with which she dropped her head and played with the ends of her girdle, that his\n",
      "spirits soared and his pain was momentarily forgotten.\n",
      "‘What have I undergone but a few whacks of the bamboo?’ he thought, ‘—yet\n",
      "already they are so sad and concerned about me! What dear, adorable, sweet, noble\n",
      "girls they are! Heaven knows how they would grieve for me if I were actually to die! It\n",
      "would be almost worth dying, just to find out. The loss of a life’s ambitions would be\n",
      "a small price to pay, and I should be a peevish, ungrateful ghost if I did not feel proud\n",
      "and happy when such darling creatures were grieving for me.’\n",
      "He was roused from this reverie by the sound of Bao-chai’s voice asking Aroma what\n",
      "it was that had moved his father to such violent anger against him. Aroma’s low reply,\n",
      "in which she merely repeated what Tealeaf had told her, was his first inkling of the\n",
      "part that Jia Huan had played in his misfortune. Her mention of Xue Pan’s\n",
      "involvement, however, made him apprehensive that Bao-chai might feel embarrassed,\n",
      "and he hastily interrupted Aroma to prevent her from saying more.\n",
      "Old Xue would never do a thing like that,’ he said. ‘It’s silly to make these wild\n",
      "assertions.’\n",
      "Bao-chai knew that it was out of respect for her feelings that he was silencing Aroma,\n",
      "and she wondered at his considerateness.\n",
      "‘What delicacy of feeling!’ she thought, ‘after so terrible a beating and in spite of all\n",
      "the pain, to be still able to worry about the possibility of someone else’s being\n",
      "offended! If only you could apply some of that thoughtfulness to the more important\n",
      "things of life, my friend, you would make my Uncle so happy; and then perhaps these\n",
      "awful things would never happen. And when all’s said and done, this sensibility on\n",
      "my behalf is rather wasted. Do you really think I know my own brother so little that I\n",
      "\f",
      "am unaware of his unruly nature? Nothing has ever been allowed to stand in the way\n",
      "of Pan’s desires. Look at the terrible trouble he made for you that time over Qin\n",
      "Zhong. That was a long time ago, and I am sure he has got much worse since then.’\n",
      "Those were her thoughts, but what she said was:\n",
      "‘There’s really no need to look around for someone to blame. If you ask me, the\n",
      "mere fact that Cousin Bao has been willing to keep such company was in itself quite\n",
      "enough to make Uncle angry. And though my brother can be very tactless and may\n",
      "well have let something out about Cousin Bao in the course of conversation, I’m sure\n",
      "it wouldn’t have been deliberate trouble-making on his part. In the first place, it is,\n",
      "after all, true, what he is supposed to have said: Cousin Bao has been going around\n",
      "with that actor. And in the second place, my brother simply hasn’t got it in him to be\n",
      "discreet. You have lived all your life with sensitive, considerate people like Cousin Bao,\n",
      "my dear Aroma. You have never had to deal with a crude, forthright person like my\n",
      "brother someone who says whatever comes into his head with complete dis?regard\n",
      "for the consequences.’\n",
      "When Bao-yu cut short her remarks about Xue Pan, Aroma had realized at once that\n",
      "she was being tactless and inwardly prayed that Bao-chai had not taken exception to\n",
      "them. To her, therefore, these words of Bao-chai’s were a source of tongue-tied\n",
      "embarrassment. Bao-yu, on the other hand, could see in them only the refusal of a\n",
      "frank and generous nature to admit deviousness in others and a sensibility capable of\n",
      "matching and responding to his own. As a consequence his spirits soared yet higher.\n",
      "He was about to say something, but Bao-chai rose to her feet and anticipated him.\n",
      "‘I’ll come and see you again tomorrow. You must rest now and give yourself a\n",
      "chance to get well. I’ve given Aroma something to make a lotion with. Get her to put\n",
      "it on for you in the evening. I can guarantee that it will hasten your re?covery.’\n",
      "She was moving towards the door as she said this. When she was outside, Aroma\n",
      "hurried after her to see her off and to thank her for her trouble.\n",
      "‘As soon as he’s better,’ she said, ‘Master Bao will come over and thank you himself,\n",
      "Miss.’\n",
      "‘It’s nothing at all,’ said Bao-chai, turning back to her with a smile. ‘Do tell him to\n",
      "rest properly, though, and not to brood. And if there’s anything at all he wants, just\n",
      "quietly come round to my place for it. Don’t go bothering Lady Jia or Lady Wang or\n",
      "any of the others, in case my uncle gets to hear of it. It probably wouldn’t matter at\n",
      "the time, but it might do later on, next time there is any trouble.’\n",
      "With that she left, and Aroma turned back into the court?yard, her heart full of\n",
      "gratitude for Bao-chai’s kindness. Re?entering Bao-yu’s room, she found him lying\n",
      "back quietly, plunged in thought. From the look of it, he was already half asleep.\n",
      "Tiptoeing out again, she went off to wash her hair.\n",
      "\f",
      "But it was difficult for Bao-yu to lie quietly for very long. The pain in his buttocks was\n",
      "like the stabbing and pricking of knives and needles and there was a burning\n",
      "sensation in them as if he were being grilled over a fire, so that the slightest\n",
      "movement made him cry out. Already it was growing late. Aroma appeared to have\n",
      "gone away, but two or three maids were still in attendance. As there was nothing\n",
      "that they could do for him, he told them that they might go off and prepare\n",
      "themselves for the night, provided that they remained within call. The maids\n",
      "accordingly withdrew, leaving him on his own.\n",
      "He had dozed off. The shadowy form of Jiang Yu-han had come in to tell him of his\n",
      "capture by the Prince of Zhong?-shun’s men, followed, shortly after, by Golden, who\n",
      "gave him a tearful account of how she had drowned herself. In his half? dream,\n",
      "half-awake state he was having the greatest difficulty in attending to what they were\n",
      "saying, when suddenly he felt someone pushing him and became dimly aware of a\n",
      "sound of weeping in his ear. He gave a start. Fully awake now, he opened his eyes. It\n",
      "was Lin Dai-yu. Suspecting this, too, to be a dream, he raised his head to look. A pair\n",
      "of eyes swollen like peaches met his own, and a face that was glistening with tears. It\n",
      "was Dai-yu all right, no doubt about that. He would have looked longer, but the strain\n",
      "of raising himself was causing such excruciating pain in his nether parts, that he fell\n",
      "back again with a groan. The groan was followed by a sigh.\n",
      "‘Now what have you come for?’ he said. ‘The sun’s not long set and the ground\n",
      "must still be very hot underfoot. You could still get a heat-stroke at this time of day,\n",
      "and that would he a fine how-do-you-do. Actually, in spite of the beating, I don’t feel\n",
      "very much pain. This fuss I make is put on to fool the others. I’m hoping they’ll\n",
      "spread the word around outside how badly I’ve been hurt, so that Father gets to hear\n",
      "of it. It’s all shamming, really. You mustn’t be taken in by it.’\n",
      "Dai-yu’s sobbing had by this time ceased to be audible; but somehow her strangled,\n",
      "silent weeping was infinitely more pathetic than the most clamorous grief. At that\n",
      "moment volumes would have been inadequate to contain the things she wanted to\n",
      "say to him; yet all she could get out, after struggling for some time with her choking\n",
      "sobs, was\n",
      "‘I suppose you’ll change now.’\n",
      "Bao-yu gave a long sigh.\n",
      "‘Don’t worry, I shan’t change. People like that are worth dying for. I wouldn’t\n",
      "change if he killed me.’\n",
      "The words were scarcely out of his mouth when they heard someone outside in the\n",
      "courtyard saying:\n",
      "‘Mrs Lian has come.’\n",
      "Dai-yu had no wish to see Xi-feng, and rose to her feet hurriedly.\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu seized hold of her hand.\n",
      "‘Now that’s funny. Why should you start being afraid of her all of a sudden?’\n",
      "She stamped with impatience.\n",
      "‘Look at the state my eyes are in I’ she said. ‘I don’t want them all making fun of me\n",
      "again.’\n",
      "At that Bao-yu released her hand and she bounded round to the back of the bed,\n",
      "slipping into the rear courtyard just as Xi-feng was entering the room from the front.\n",
      "‘A bit better now?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is there anything you feel like eating yet? If there is,\n",
      "tell them to come round to my place and get it.’\n",
      "As soon as Xi-feng had gone, Bao-yu was visited by Aunt Xue, and shortly after that\n",
      "by someone whom his grandmother had sent to see how he was getting on. At\n",
      "lighting-up time, after taking a few mouthfuls of soup, he settled down into a fitful\n",
      "sleep.\n",
      "Just then a new group of visitors arrived, consisting of Zhou Rui’s wife, Wu Xin-deng’s\n",
      "wife, Zheng Hao-shi’s wife, and those other members of the mansion’s female staff\n",
      "who had had most to do with Bao-yu in the past and who, having heard of his beating,\n",
      "were anxious to see how he was. Aroma came out smiling on to the verandah to\n",
      "welcome them.\n",
      "‘You’re just too late to see him, ladies,’ she told them in a low voice. ‘He’s just this\n",
      "minute dropped off.’\n",
      "She ushered them into the Outer room, invited them to be seated, and served them\n",
      "with tea. After sitting there very quietly for several minutes, they got up to take their\n",
      "leave, requesting Aroma as they did so that she would inform Bao-yu when he waked\n",
      "that they had been round to ask about him. Aroma promised to do so and showed\n",
      "them out. Just as she was about to go in again, an old woman arrived from Lady\n",
      "Wang’s to say that ‘Her Ladyship would like to see one of Master Bao’s people.’ After\n",
      "reflecting for a moment, Aroma turned to the house and called softly to Skybright,\n",
      "Musk and Ripple inside.\n",
      "‘Her Ladyship wants to see someone, so I’m going over. Stay indoors and keep an\n",
      "eye on things while I’m away. I shan’t be long.’\n",
      "Then she followed the old woman out of the Garden and round to Lady Wang’s\n",
      "apartment in the central courtyard. She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane\n",
      "summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely\n",
      "pleased when she saw that it was Aroma.\n",
      "‘You could have sent one of the others,’ she said. ‘There was no need for you to\n",
      "come and leave him unattended.’\n",
      "Aroma smiled reassuringly.\n",
      "‘Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want\n",
      "\f",
      "anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own.\n",
      "Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send\n",
      "one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was\n",
      "afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted.’\n",
      "‘I have nothing in particular to tell you,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I merely wanted to ask\n",
      "about my son. How is the pain now?’\n",
      "‘Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him,’ said\n",
      "Aroma. ‘It was so bad before that he couldn’t lie still, but now he’s sleeping quite\n",
      "soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was.’\n",
      "‘Has he had anything to eat yet?’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent,’ said Aroma, ‘but that’s all\n",
      "he would take. He kept complain?ing that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum\n",
      "bitters to drink, but of course that’s an astringent, and I thought to myself that as he’\n",
      "d just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and\n",
      "hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and\n",
      "if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious\n",
      "illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose\n",
      "syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him; but after only half a cup of it he said it\n",
      "tasted sickly and he couldn’t get it down.’\n",
      "‘Oh dear, I wish you’d told me sooner,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We were sent some bottles\n",
      "of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was\n",
      "going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably\n",
      "only get wasted, so I didn’t. If he can’t manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a\n",
      "few of them to take back with you. You need only mix a teaspoonful of essence in a\n",
      "cupful of water. The flavours are quite delicious.’ She called Suncloud to her. ‘Fetch\n",
      "me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day.’\n",
      "‘Two will be enough,’ said Aroma, ‘otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run out, I\n",
      "can always come back for more later.’\n",
      "Suncloud was gone for a considerable time. Eventually she returned with two little\n",
      "glass bottles, each about three inches high, which she handed to Aroma. They had\n",
      "screw on silver tops and yellow labels. One of them was labelled ‘Essence of Cassia\n",
      "Flower’ and the other one ‘Essence of Roses’.\n",
      "‘What tiny little bottles!’ said Aroma. ‘They can’t hold very much. I suppose the\n",
      "stuff inside them must be very precious.’\n",
      "‘It was made specially for the Emperor,’ said Lady Wang. ‘That’s what the yellow\n",
      "labels mean. Haven’t you seen labels like that before? Mind you look after them and\n",
      "don’t let the stuff in them get wasted.’\n",
      "Aroma promised to be careful and began to go.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Just a minute!’ said Lady Wang. ‘I’ve thought of some-thing else that I wanted to\n",
      "ask you.’\n",
      "Aroma returned. Lady Wang first glanced about her to make sure that no one else\n",
      "was in the room, then she said:\n",
      "‘I think I heard someone say that Bao-yu’s beating today was because of something\n",
      "that Huan had said to Sir Zheng. I suppose you don’t happen to have heard anything\n",
      "about that?’\n",
      "‘No. I haven’t heard anything about that,’ said Aroma. ‘What I heard was that it was\n",
      "because Master Bao had been going around with one of Prince Somebody or other’s\n",
      "players and the Master was told about it by someone who called.’\n",
      "Lady Wang nodded her head mysteriously.\n",
      "‘Yes, that was one of the reasons. But there was another reason as well.’\n",
      "‘I really know nothing about any other reason, Your Lady?ship,’ said Aroma. She\n",
      "dropped her head and hesitated a moment before going on. ‘I wonder if I might be\n",
      "rather bold and say something very outspoken to Your Ladyship? Really and truly ’\n",
      "She faltered.\n",
      "‘Please go on.’\n",
      "‘I will if Your Ladyship will promise not to he angry with me.’\n",
      "‘That’s all right,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Just tell me what you have to say.’\n",
      "‘Well, really and truly,’ said Aroma, ‘Master Bao needed punishing. If the Master\n",
      "didn’t keep an eye on him, there’s no knowing what he mightn’t get up to.’\n",
      "‘My child,’ said Lady Wang with a warmth rarely seen in her, ‘those are exactly my\n",
      "own sentiments. How clever of you to have understood! Of course, I know perfectly\n",
      "well that Bao-yu is in need of discipline; and anyone who saw how strict I used to be\n",
      "with Mr Zhu would realize that I am capable of exercising it. But I have my reasons. A\n",
      "woman of fifty cannot expect to bear any more children and Bao-yu is now the only\n",
      "son I have. He is not a very strong boy; and his Grannie dotes on him. I daren’t risk\n",
      "being strict. I daren’t risk losing another son. I daren’t risk angering Her Old Ladyship\n",
      "and upsetting the whole household. I do once in a while have it out with him but\n",
      "though I have argued and pleaded and wept, it doesn’t do any good. He seems all\n",
      "right at the time, but he’ll be just the same again a short while afterwards and I\n",
      "always know that I have failed to reach him. Jam afraid he has to suffer before he can\n",
      "learn but suppose it’s too much for him? - suppose he doesn’t get over this beating?\n",
      "What will become of me?’\n",
      "She began to cry.\n",
      "Seeing her mistress so distressed, Aroma herself was affected and began to cry too.\n",
      "‘I can understand Your Ladyship being so upset,’ she said, ‘when he’s your own son.\n",
      "Even we servants that have been with him for a few years get worried about him. The\n",
      "\f",
      "most that we can ever hope for is to do our duty and get by without too much\n",
      "trouble but even that won’t be possible if he goes on the way he has been doing. I’m\n",
      "always telling him to change his ways. Every day every hour I tell him. But it’s no use;\n",
      "he won’t listen. Of course, if these people will make so much fuss of him, you can\n",
      "hardly blame him for going round with them though it does make our job more\n",
      "difficult. But now that Your Ladyship has spoken like this, it puts me in mind of\n",
      "something that’s been worrying me which I should like to have asked Your Ladyship’s\n",
      "advice about, only I was afraid you might take it amiss, and then not only should I\n",
      "have spoken to no purpose, but I should leave myself without even a grave to lie in...’\n",
      "It was evident to Lady Wang that what she was struggling to get out was a matter of\n",
      "some consequence.\n",
      "‘What is it you want to tell me, my child?’ she said kindly. ‘I’ve heard a lot of people\n",
      "praising you recently, and I confess that I assumed it must be because you took\n",
      "special pains in serving Bao-yu or in making yourself agreeable to other people —\n",
      "little things of that sort. But I see that I was wrong. These are not at all little things\n",
      "that you have been talking about. What you have said so far makes very good sense\n",
      "and entirely accords with my own opinion of the matter. So if you have anything to\n",
      "tell me, I should like to hear it. But I must ask you not to discuss it with anyone else.’\n",
      "‘All I really wanted to ask,’ said Aroma, ‘was if Your Lady?ship could advise me how\n",
      "later on we can somehow or other contrive to get Master Bao moved back outside\n",
      "the Garden,’\n",
      "Lady Wang looked startled and clutched Aroma’s hand in some alarm.\n",
      "‘I hope Bao-yu hasn’t been doing something dreadful with one of the girls?’\n",
      "‘Oh no, Your Ladyship, please don’t suspect that!’ said Aroma hurriedly. ‘That\n",
      "wasn’t my meaning at all. It’s just that—if you’ll allow me to say so—Master Bao and\n",
      "the young ladies are beginning to grow up now, and though they are all cousins,\n",
      "there is the difference of sex between them, which makes it very awkward\n",
      "sometimes when they are all living together, especially in the case of Miss Lin and\n",
      "Miss Bao, who aren’t even of the same clan. One can’t help feeling uneasy. Even to\n",
      "outsiders it looks like a very strange sort of family. They say “where nothing happens,\n",
      "imagination is busiest”, and I’m sure lots of unaccountable misfortunes begin when\n",
      "some innocent little thing we did unthinkingly gets mis?construed in someone else’s\n",
      "imagination and reported as something terrible. We just have to be on our guard\n",
      "against that sort of thing happening especially when Master Bao has such a peculiar\n",
      "character, as Your Ladyship knows, and spends all his time with girls. He only has to\n",
      "make the tiniest slip in an unguarded moment, and whether he really did anything or\n",
      "not, with so many people about and some of them no better than they should be\n",
      "there is sure to be scandal. For you know what some of these people are like, Your\n",
      "\f",
      "Ladyship. If they feel well-disposed towards you, they’ll make you out to be a saint;\n",
      "but if they’re not, then Heaven help you! If Master Bao lives to be spoken well of’ we\n",
      "can count ourselves lucky; but the way things are, it only needs someone to breathe\n",
      "a word of scandal and - I say nothing of what will happen to us servants—it’s of no\n",
      "consequence if we’re all chopped up for mincemeat—but what’s more important,\n",
      "Master Bao’s reputa?tion will be destroyed for life and all the care and worry Your\n",
      "Ladyship and Sir Zheng have had on his account will have been wasted. I know Your\n",
      "Ladyship is very busy and can’t be expected to think of everything, and I probably\n",
      "shouldn’t have thought of this myself, but once I had thought of it, it seemed to me\n",
      "that it would be wrong of me not to tell Your Ladyship, and it’s been preying on my\n",
      "mind ever since. The only reason I haven’t mentioned it before is because I was\n",
      "afraid Your Ladyship might be angry with me.’\n",

      "this humble servant-girl who had shown so much solici?tude on her behalf.\n",
      "‘It is very perceptive of you, my dear, to have thought it all out so carefully,’ she said.\n",
      "‘I have, of course, thought about this matter myself’ but other things have put it from\n",
      "my mind, and what you have just said has reminded me. It is most thoughtful of you.\n",
      "You are a very, very good girl — Well, you may go now. I think I now know what to do.\n",
      "There is just one thing before you go, though. Now that you have spoken to me like\n",
      "this, I am going to place Bao-yu entirely in your hands. Be very careful with him,\n",
      "won’t you? Remember that anything you do for him you will be doing also for me.\n",
      "You will find that I am not ungrateful.’\n",
      "Aroma stood for a moment with bowed head, weighing the import of these words.\n",
      "Then she said:\n",
      "‘I will do what Your Ladyship has asked me to the utmost of my ability.’\n",
      "She left the apartment slowly and made her way back to Green Delights, pondering\n",
      "-as she went. When she arrived, Bao-yu had just woken up, so she told him about the\n",
      "flavourings. He was pleased and made her mix some for him straight away. It was\n",
      "quite delicious. He kept thinking about Dai-yu and wanted to send someone over to\n",
      "see her, but he was afraid that Aroma would disapprove, so, as a means of getting\n",
      "her out of the way, he sent her over to Bao-chai’s place to borrow a book. As soon as\n",
      "she had gone, he summoned Skybright.\n",
      "‘I want you to go to Miss Lin’s for me,’ he said. ‘Just see what she’s doing, and if she\n",
      "asks about me, tell her I’m all right.’\n",
      "‘I can’t go rushing in there bald-headed without a reason,’ said Skybright. ‘You’d\n",
      "better give me some kind of a message, just to give me an excuse for going there.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I have none to give,’ said Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘Well, give me something to take, then,’ said Skybright, ‘or think of something I can\n",
      "ask her for. Otherwise it will look so silly.’\n",
      "Bao-yu thought for a bit and then, reaching out and picking up two of his old\n",
      "handkerchiefs, he tossed them towards her with a smile.\n",
      "‘All right. Tell her I said you were to give her these.’\n",
      "‘That’s an odd sort of present!’ said Skybright. ‘What’s she going to do with a pair\n",
      "of your old handkerchiefs? Most likely she’ll think you’re making fun of her and get\n",
      "upset again.’\n",
      "‘No she won’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’ll understand.’\n",
      "Skybright deemed it pointless to argue, so she picked up the handkerchiefs and went\n",
      "off to the Naiad’s House. Little Deli?cate, who was hanging some towels out to dry on\n",
      "the verandah railings, saw her enter the courtyard and attempted to wave her away.\n",
      "‘She’s gone to bed.’\n",
      "Skybright ignored her and went on inside. The lamps had not been lit and the room\n",
      "was in almost total darkness. The voice of Dai-yu, lying awake in bed, spoke to her\n",
      "out of the shadows.\n",
      "‘Who is it?’\n",
      "‘Skybright.’\n",
      "‘What do you want?’\n",
      "‘Master Bao has sent me with some handkerchiefs, Miss?\n",
      "Dai-yu seemed to hesitate. She found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it\n",
      "could mean.\n",
      "‘I suppose they must be very good ones,’ she said. ‘Prob?ably someone gave them\n",
      "to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for\n",
      "them just now myself.’\n",
      "Skybright laughed.\n",
      "‘They’re not new ones, Miss. They’re two of his did, everyday ones.’\n",
      "This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then\n",
      "suddenly, in a flash, she understood.\n",
      "‘Put them down. You may go now.’\n",
      "Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she\n",
      "tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her.\n",
      "Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of\n",
      "conflicting emotions.\n",
      "‘I feel so happy,’ she thought, ‘that in the midst of his own affliction he has been\n",
      "able to grasp the cause of all my trouble.\n",
      "‘And yet at the same time I am sad,’ she thought; ‘because how do I know that my\n",

      "Aunt Xue, seeing her daughter’s tears, could not forbear shedding a few herself,\n",
      "though she did her best to comfort her.\n",
      "‘There, there, my child! Don’t be upset! I’ll deal with that wicked brother of yours,\n",
      "you see if I don’t. I don’t want any?thing to happen to my girlie, do I? If anything\n",
      "were to happen to her, I should have no one to turn to.’\n",
      "Xue Pan, who had overheard, came running into the room at this point. Clasping his\n",
      "hands together, he pumped them up and down, at the same time making sweeping\n",
      "bows to right and left of him, in token of his contrition.\n",
      "‘Forgive me, sis,’ he said. ‘I’d had too much to drink last night. I met a friend on my\n",
      "way home. It was already quite late when I bumped into him, and I still hadn’t\n",
      "sobered up properly when I got back here. I don’t know myself what it was I said, but\n",
      "I know I must have talked a lot of silly non?sense. I’m not surprised you were angry\n",
      "with me.’\n",
      "\f",
      "The clumsiness of his apology rapidly turned Bao-chai’s weeping into laughter. Lifting\n",
      "her face up from the handker?chief in which it had been buried, she made a little\n",
      "grimace of derision.\n",
      "‘There’s no need for you to put on this act,’ she said ‘I understand what your real\n",
      "motive is perfectly well. You don’t like having us womenfolk around you and you are\n",
      "looking for a means of getting rid of us, so that you can have the place here to\n",
      "yourself.’\n",
      "Xue Pan laughed deprecatingly.\n",
      "‘I don’t know where you got that idea from, sis,’ he said. ‘It’s very unlike you to\n",
      "make a snide remark like that.’\n",
      "‘Snide remark?’ said Aunt Xue indignantly. ‘If that’s a “snide remark”, I don’t know\n",
      "what sort of remarks you were making to your sister last night. I think you must have\n",
      "taken leave of your senses!’\n",
      "‘Now Mamma, don’t be angry,’ said Xue Pan, ‘and don’t you be upset, sis. Suppose I\n",
      "were to tell you that from now on I’m going to give up drinking with the others\n",
      "altogether, eh? What would you say to that?’\n",
      "‘I’d say that you had come to your senses at last,’ said Bao?-chai.\n",
      "‘And I’d say that the Heavenly Dragon had laid an egg,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘if you really\n",
      "had the will-power to do it.’\n",
      "‘All right then,’ said Xue Pan. ‘If you ever hear that I’ve been drinking with those\n",
      "others again, sis, you can spit at me and you can call me a beast and a — and a —\n",
      "worthless louse! Dammit, it’s too bad that the two of you should be worried all the\n",
      "time because of me! It’s bad enough that I should make you angry, Mamma; but to\n",
      "have poor little sis, too, worrying her heart out — oh, I really am a louse! I ought to\n",
      "be extra good to you, Mamma, now that Father’s dead, and extra kind to sis; but\n",
      "instead I make my own dear Mother angry and little sis upset. I’m not a beast, I’m\n",
      "worse than a beast!’\n",
      "And the great booby began to cry.\n",
      "At this Aunt Xue, who had not been crying when he started, was herself becoming\n",
      "upset, and Bao-chai was obliged to intervene with a brisk cheerfulness that she was\n",
      "very far from feeling.\n",
      "‘Haven’t you caused enough trouble already without making Mamma cry again?’\n",
      "‘Who says I’ve been making Mamma cry?’ said Xue Pan, restraining his tears and\n",
      "grinning back at her. ‘All right then, all right. Let’s drop the whole subject and say no\n",
      "more about it. We’ll have Caltrop in and get her to pour you a nice cup of tea.’\n",
      "‘I don t want any tea, thank you,’ said Bao-chai. ‘As soon as Mamma has washed, I\n",
      "shall be going back into the Garden with her.’\n",
      "‘Let me look at that-locket of yours,’ said Xue Pan. ‘I think it needs dipping again.’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Whatever for?’ said Bao-chai. ‘The gilding’s as bright as new.’\n",
      "‘Isn’t it time you had a few more clothes?’ said Xue Pan.\n",
      "‘Let me know what colours and what sort of patterns you want.’\n",
      "‘I wouldn’t know what to do with them,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I haven’t yet worn all the\n",
      "things I’ve got.’\n",
      "Shortly after this exchange Aunt Xue re-emerged from changing her clothes and,\n",
      "taking Bao-chai by the hand, went through into the Garden with her, leaving Xue Pan\n",
      "to go off on his own.\n",
      "Once in the Garden, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai made their way straight to Green\n",
      "Delights. From the large number of maids and older women they found when they\n",
      "got there waiting out?side on the verandah or in the ante-room inside, they knew\n",
      "that Grandmother Jia and the other ladies must have arrived there before them.\n",
      "They exchanged greetings with the latter on entering, after which they went over to\n",
      "the couch on which Bao-yu lay, to inquire if he was feeling any better. Seeing Aunt\n",
      "Xue, he attempted to raise himself a little.\n",
      "‘Thank you,’ he said, ‘I am a little better. But what a lot of trouble I am causing! I\n",
      "feel ashamed that you should have come over just to see me.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue made him lie down again.\n",
      "‘If there’s anything you want,’ she said, ‘do please let me know.’\n",
      "‘I certainly shall,’ he said, ‘if I can think of anything.’\n",
      "‘Is there anything you fancy to eat?’ said Lady Wang. ‘We can order it for you when\n",
      "we go back presently.’\n",
      "‘I can’t think of anything,’ said Bao-yu, ‘unless I did quite like that soup we had once\n",
      "with the little lotus-leaves and lotus-pods in it.’\n",
      "Xi-feng, who was standing by listening, gave a crow of laughter.\n",
      "‘Listen to that, now! What low tastes the boy has! Whatever makes you want to eat\n",
      "that leathery old stuff?’\n",
      "‘Have it made, have it made!’ said Grandmother Jia vehemently. ‘Let the boy have\n",
      "it by all means.’\n",
      "‘Don’t be in such a hurry, Grannie!’ said Xi-feng laughing. ‘I’m trying to think who’s\n",
      "got the moulds that they need for making the little shapes with.’\n",
      "She turned and ordered one of the old women in attendance to go and ask the chief\n",
      "cook; but though the old woman was a long time gone, she came back\n",
      "empty-handed.\n",
      "‘Cook says the four moulds for the soup-shapes were handed in some time ago on\n",
      "your instructions.’\n",
      "Xi-feng thought for a bit.\n",
      "‘Yes, I remember now: I did get them back from her. But I can’t remember who I\n",
      "\f",
      "gave them to. I should think the likeliest place for them to be is the tea-room.’\n",
      "She sent someone to the tea-room stewardess; but she hadn’t got them either. In the\n",
      "end they turned out to be with the plate stewardess, who looked after the gold and\n",
      "silver. Aunt Xue was the first to examine them when they arrived.\n",
      "There were four moulds fitted into a single box. They were made of silver, a foot or so\n",
      "long and about an inch wide. Along the face of each mould were rows of very finely\n",
      "cut dies, each about the size of a bean, thirty or forty on each mould. On one of the\n",
      "moulds the dies were in the shape of chrysanthemums, on another of plum-flowers,\n",
      "on the third of lotus pods and leaves, and on the remaining one of caltrops. Aunt Xue\n",
      "turned to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang with amusement.\n",
      "‘You people really do think of everything! All these patterns for a bowl of soup! If\n",
      "you hadn’t told me, I should never have guessed what these things were for.’\n",
      "Xi-feng answered her before either of the older ladies could reply.\n",
      "‘You wouldn’t know about these anyway, Aunt. It’s some?thing they thought up last\n",
      "year for Her Grace’s visit. They cut shapes with these things out of some special\n",
      "dough — I’m not sure exactly what it’s made of — and put them in a clear soup.\n",
      "There’s supposed to be a suggestion of autumn lotuses in the flavour, but it doesn’t\n",
      "taste very much really. It’s certainly not the sort of thing you’d want to eat very often.\n",
      "In fact, I think the only time we ever had it was when they made some for the visit.\n",
      "I’m surprised he can still remember.’\n",
      "She handed the moulds to an attendant woman-servant.\n",
      "‘Tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other in?gredients as they’ll need to\n",
      "make ten bowlfuls with. Say it’s wanted immediately.’\n",
      "‘Why so much?’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘I have my reason,’ said Xi-feng. ‘This isn’t the sort of thing one eats every day, and\n",
      "now that Cousin Bao has men?tioned it, it seems silly to make it just for him and not\n",
      "let you and Grandma and Auntie Xue taste it as well. So while we are about it, we\n",
      "might just as well do enough of it for everyone.’ She smiled mischievously. ‘I might\n",
      "even have a taste of it myself.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia laughed.\n",
      "‘Little monkey! We spoil you! Spending public money on private entertainment,\n",
      "that’s what this is!’\n",
      "The others all laughed. Xi-feng, quite unconcerned, joined in.\n",
      "‘That’s no problem,’ she said. ‘I’m sure I can afford a little treat like this.’ She turned\n",
      "to the waiting woman: ‘Tell the kitchen to use plenty of everything and charge it all\n",
      "up to my account.’\n",
      "The woman murmured a reply and went off to see about the order.\n",
      "Bao-chai had been following these exchanges with amuse?ment.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Cousin Feng may be very artful,’ she said, ‘but I don’t believe that in all the years\n",
      "I’ve been here I have ever seen her get the better of Lady Jia.’\n",
      "‘I’m an old woman, my dear,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘What use would I have for\n",
      "artfulness at my time of life? Mind you, when I was the age that Feng is now, I could\n",
      "have taught her a thing or two. Still, though she may not be as sharp as I was then,\n",
      "she doesn’t do so badly! A deal better than your Aunt Wang here, that’s certain. She\n",
      "can’t talk to save her life, poor soul, no more than a woman of wood! She could\n",
      "never get round me the way your Cousin Feng does. Fengie has the gift of a good\n",
      "tongue, my dear. That’s why your old grannie is so fond of her.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘From what you say, Grandma, it sounds as if the good talkers are the only ones you\n",
      "can be fond of.’\n",
      "‘Oh no,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The silent ones have their merits, just as the good\n",
      "talkers have theirs. Good talkers can be very tiresome at times and then I prefer the\n",
      "silent ones.’\n",
      "‘That’s all right then,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was going to say: my sister-in-law certainly isn’t\n",
      "much of talker, yet I’m sure you are as fond of her as you are of Feng. If being a good\n",
      "talker were the only thing that mattered, I should have thought that Cousin Feng and\n",
      "Cousin Lin would be the only two in the family you would really care about.’\n",
      "‘Well now, if we’re going to start comparing,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘I hope your\n",
      "Aunt Xue won’t think I am only saying this because she is here, but really and truly I\n",
      "do think that of all the girls in this family her Bao-chai is the one that I like the best.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue laughingly demurred.\n",
      "‘You mustn’t say that. I’m sure you can’t really mean it.’\n",
      "‘No, no, I’m sure she does,’ Lady Wang hurriedly interposed. ‘I’ve often heard\n",
      "Mother speak well of Bao-chai when you weren’t around.’\n",
      "Bao-yu’s contribution to the conversation had been made with the intention of\n",
      "encouraging Grandmother Jia to say something nice about Dai-yu. It came to him as a\n",
      "surprise when she started praising Bao-chai instead. He looked at Bao?-chai and\n",
      "grinned; but she turned quickly away and began talk?ing to Aroma.\n",
      "Just then a servant came to say that lunch over at the man?sion was ready, and\n",
      "Grandmother Jia rose to go. Having first exhorted Bao-yu to ‘hurry up and get better’\n",
      "and then ad?monished his maids, she began to move out of the room not without a\n",
      "polite attempt to make Aunt Xue go out ahead of her - leaning on Xi-feng’s arm.\n",
      "‘Is that soup ready yet?’ she inquired when they were out of the room. Then,\n",
      "turning to Aunt Xue, she asked her if there was anything she particularly fancied for\n",
      "her lunch.\n",
      "‘Mind you let me know if there is,’ she said. ‘I have the power to make Fengie treat\n",
      "\f",
      "us to it.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue laughed.\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t tease the poor girl! She’s always getting nice things for you. But\n",
      "you’re not much of an eater at the best of times.’\n",
      "‘Don’t you believe it, Aunt!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Grannie knows how to tuck in. She’d have\n",
      "eaten me by now if she weren’t afraid that she’d find me a bit too vinegary.’\n",
      "This set them all off laughing. Even Bao-yu, in the inner room, had to join in, though\n",
      "it hurt him to do so. Aroma, standing beside him, was helpless with mirth.\n",
      "‘Mrs Lian really is a caution!’\n",
      "Bao-yu took her hand and drew her down beside him.\n",
      "‘Come!’ he said. ‘You must be tired. You’ve been on your feet for hours.’\n",
      "‘Hey, you’ve forgotten!’ said Aroma. ‘While Miss Bao’s still in the courtyard, you\n",
      "ought to ask her if she’ll let Oriole come over to do that knotting for you.’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m glad you reminded me.’ He raised his head and shouted\n",
      "towards the window.\n",
      "‘Cousin Bao! If you can spare her, after you’ve had your lunch, would you mind\n",
      "sending Oriole here to do some knotting for me?’\n",
      "‘Yes, certainly,’ said Bao-chai, turning back to reply. ‘I’ll send her over presently.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and the others had stopped to listen. Not having heard properly, the\n",
      "old lady asked what it was, Bao?-chai explained.\n",
      "‘Oh do, my dear!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Do let him have her to do the knotting I If\n",
      "you need someone in her place, I have plenty of free hands in my apartment. Just\n",
      "pick whichever of my maids you like to wait on you.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were amused.\n",
      "‘Let her go to him by all means,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but there certainly won’t be any\n",
      "need of a stand-in. She has little enough to do but get up to mischief as it is.’\n",
      "They had been walking on as they talked and presently came upon Xiang-yun,\n",
      "Patience and Caltrop picking balsams beside an artificial ‘mountain’ of rock. Seeing\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and the rest coming, they left off their flower gathering and came\n",
      "forward to join them.\n",
      "Soon the little party emerged from the Garden. Fearing that Grandmother Jia might\n",
      "be fatigued, Lady Wang proposed that she should stop on the way back and sit down\n",
      "for a while in her apartment. The old lady’s feet were indeed beginning to trouble\n",
      "her and she nodded in consent. Lady Wang sent a maid on ahead to prepare for her\n",
      "arrival.\n",
      "Aunt Zhao was prudently avoiding Lady Wang for the time being by feigning sick, so\n",
      "of the two concubines it was only Aunt Zhou who came out with the old\n",
      "women-servants and maids of the apartment to welcome Grandmother Jia, holding\n",
      "\f",
      "up the door blind for her to enter and arranging the pillows and back-rest for her on\n",
      "the kang.\n",
      "Moving up to it on Xi-feng’s arm, the old lady installed herself on the right-hand side\n",
      "at the back with Aunt Xue in the guest’s position beside her. Bao-chai and Xiang-yun\n",
      "sat nearer the edge of the kang on either side. Lady Wang served Grand?mother Jia\n",
      "with tea, holding the cup ceremoniously in both her hands, and Li Wan in like\n",
      "manner offered tea to Aunt Xue.\n",
      "‘Let the younger women wait on us,’ said Grandmother Jia to Lady Wang. ‘You sit\n",
      "down over there so that we can talk to you.’\n",
      "Lady Wang obediently took a seat on a stool-chair beside the kang. She instructed\n",
      "Xi-feng to be her deputy.\n",
      "‘You can tell them to serve Grandmother’s lunch in here,’ she said to Xi-feng. ‘You\n",
      "had better get them to add a dish or two.’\n",
      "Having said that she would, Xi-feng went outside and in?structed a servant to take\n",
      "word round to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The old women there passed on the\n",
      "message in their turn, and soon a reinforcement of maids were hurrying on their way\n",
      "to Lady Wang’s.\n",
      "Lady Wang next gave instructions that the rest of the girls should be invited; but after\n",
      "a long wait only Tan-chun and Xi-chun turned up. Ying-chun was unwell and did not\n",
      "feel like eating. Dai-yu abstained so frequently — eating perhaps no more than five\n",
      "meals in every ten — that her absence on this occasion was scarcely noticed.\n",
      "Soon lunch arrived and the servants brought up a low table and set it down on the\n",
      "kang. Xi-feng stood on the floor below, a bundle of ivory chopsticks wrapped up in a\n",
      "tea-towel in her hand.\n",
      "‘Now, Grannie and Auntie,’ she said, ‘I hope you are going to do as you’re told and\n",
      "not stand on ceremony!’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia looked at Aunt Xue and smiled.\n",
      "‘Shall we do as she says and stay put?’\n",
      "‘Yes, certainly,’ said Aunt Xue, smiling back, whereupon Xi-feng proceeded to lay for\n",
      "them where they sat: two pairs of chopsticks on the far side for Grandmother Jia and\n",
      "Aunt Xue, one pair at either end for Bao-chai and Xiang-yun. Lady Wang and Li Wan\n",
      "stood on the floor below and supervised the serv?ing of the dishes, while Xi-feng\n",
      "called for a set of clean things for one more person and went, chopsticks in hand,\n",
      "from dish to dish, making a selection from them for Bao-yu.\n",
      "A few minutes later the lotus-leaf soup arrived and was presented to Grandmother\n",
      "Jia for her inspection. Lady Wang, glancing quickly round her, noticed Silver standing\n",
      "near at hand and ordered her to carry a bowl of it to Bao-yu together with the other\n",
      "things that Xi-feng had just put out for him; but Xi-feng objected that there was too\n",
      "\f",
      "much for one person to carry. Just then Oriole and Providence chanced to enter, and\n",
      "Bao-chai, knowing that they had already had their lunch, suggested that Oriole\n",
      "should help with the carrying.\n",
      "‘Master Bao has been asking if you could go over there to do some knotting for\n",
      "him,’ she told Oriole, ‘You might as well go with her and do it now.’\n",
      "‘Yes, Miss,’ said Oriole, and went off with Silver, carrying her share of the bowls.\n",
      "‘They’re terribly hot,’ she said, when they were alone together. ‘How are we going\n",
      "to carry them so far?’\n",
      "‘Don’t worry!’ said Silver, ‘I know just the answer.’\n",
      "She made one of the old women fetch a covered lacquer carrying-box. The bowls of\n",
      "soup, rice and so forth fitted into it easily. She told the old woman to follow them.\n",
      "She and Oriole then sauntered along empty-handed in the direction of Green\n",
      "Delights, while the old woman trotted along behind them carrying everything. When\n",
      "they reached the gate of the courtyard, Silver took the box from her and the two girls\n",
      "went on into the house alone.\n",
      "They found Aroma, Musk and Ripple in the inner room, enjoying a joke with Bao-yu.\n",
      "The three of them got up, still laughing, when they saw Silver and Oriole enter, and\n",
      "Aroma, supposing that they had come from their respective apart?ments, remarked,\n",
      "as she relieved Silver of the box, on the coincidence of their arriving simultaneously.\n",
      "Having handed over the box, Silver plumped herself down on a stool-chair; but Oriole\n",
      "was less bold; and even when Aroma offered her a foot-stool to sit on, she still\n",
      "refused to be seated.\n",
      "Bao-yu was naturally very pleased to see Oriole; but the sight of Silver, reminding him,\n",
      "with a pang of mingled shame and sorrow, of her sister Golden, impelled him to\n",
      "ignore Oriole and concentrate his attention on the other girl. Aroma noticed this\n",
      "neglect and was afraid that Oriole might be offended. Partly for this reason and\n",
      "partly because Oriole looked so uncomfortable standing up, but was evidently\n",
      "determined not to sit down in Bao-yu’s presence, she took her by the hand and drew\n",
      "her into the adjoining room for a cup of tea and a chat.\n",
      "Meanwhile in the inner room Musk and Ripple had laid out the bowls and chopsticks\n",
      "and were waiting in readiness to serve Bao-yu his lunch; but Bao-yu was still\n",
      "occupied with Silver and seemed in no hurry to begin.\n",
      "‘How is your mother?’ he asked her.\n",
      "The girl sat silent, with a sullen, angry look on her face. When, with a muttered ‘all\n",
      "right’, she did at last answer him, she averted her eyes and would not look at him.\n",
      "Bao-yu was very much put out, but did his best to be pleasant.\n",
      "‘Who told you to bring this for me?’\n",
      "‘Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian. Who do you think?’\n",
      "\f",
      "Bao-yu could see the misery in her face and knew that it was because of Golden that\n",
      "she looked like that. He wished he could humble himself before her, but the presence\n",
      "of the other maids inhibited him. He had to think of some way of getting rid of them.\n",
      "Having succeeded at last in doing so, he began, as soon as they were out of the room,\n",
      "to exercise all his charm upon Silver. At first she tried to ignore the questions with\n",
      "which he plied her; but he was so patient and persistent, meet?ing her unyielding\n",
      "stiffness with such warmth and gentleness, that in the end her heart misgave her and\n",
      "a faintly pleased expression began to steal over her face. Bao-yu judged the time ripe\n",
      "to entreat her smilingly for his lunch.\n",
      "‘Fetch me that soup will you, there’s a dear. I’d like to try it now.’\n",
      "‘I can’t feed other people,’ said Silver. ‘I never could. You’ll have to wait till the\n",

      "finished your errand and get on with your own lunch. I don’t want to keep you from\n",

      "for you!’\n",
      "She broke into a sudden peal of laughter and fetched him the soup.\n",

      "‘Doesn’t taste nice?’ said Silver with an expression of extreme disgust. ‘Holy Name!\n",
      "if that doesn’t taste nice, I’d like to know what does!’\n",
      "‘It’s got no flavour,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Taste it yourself, if you don’t believe me.’\n",

      "Silver realized that he had deliberately tricked her into drinking from the same bowl.\n",

      "‘You wouldn’t drink it a moment ago,’ she said, ‘so now you shan’t have any even if\n",
      "you say you want it.’\n",

      "back and called in the other maids to give him the rest of his meal no sooner had\n",
      "they come in, however, than it was announced that ‘two old nannies from Mr Fu’s’\n",
      "had arrived ‘to call on Master Bao’.\n",
      "Bao-yu knew that the ‘Mr Fu’ referred to must be one Fu Shi, an Assistant\n",
      "Sub-Prefect who had started life as one of Jia Zheng’s protégé’s and made his way up\n",
      "in the world largely by trading on Jia Zheng’s reputation. Jia Zheng thought highly of\n",
      "him, regarding him as the brightest of the various young fellows he had patronized,\n",
      "and Fu Shi for his part was assiduous in sending message and compliments to the\n",
      "man?sion in order to keep up the connection.\n",
      "Now if there were two sorts of people Bao-yu could not at any rice abide they were\n",
      "stupid old women and pushing young men. It may therefore seem strange that these\n",
      "two old nannies sent by the egregious Fu Shi should have been ac?corded instant\n",
      "admission to his sickroom. The reason was that Bao-yu’ had heard that Fu Shi had a\n",
      "younger sister called Fu Qiu-fang, who, though\n",
      "\n",
      "        a virgin-pearl, still chambered from men’s sight,\n",
      "\n",
      "was commonly said to be both beautiful and talented. Bao-yu had not actually seen\n",
      "her; hut he had formed a picture of her in his imagination and worshipped her from\n",
      "afar. And since to have refused entry to the two old women would have been in his\n",
      "eyes tantamount to offering Qiu-fang an affront, he at once gave orders for them to\n",
      "be admitted.\n",
      "Qiu-fang was, as a matter of fact, a girl of passable good looks and more than average\n",
      "intelligence. Her brother had entertained hopes of trading on these assets in order to\n",
      "ally himself matrimonially with some powerful or aristocratic family — an ambition\n",
      "which had hitherto led him to look frowningly on lesser offers, with the result that, at\n",
      "the relatively great age of twenty-two, Qiu-fang remained unbetrothed. For the fact\n",
      "of the matter was that the powerful and aristocratic families with whom he sought\n",
      "alliance looked on Fu Shi as an impoverished pen-pusher deficient in both breeding\n",
      "and refinement and showed not the slightest inclination to want his sister as a\n",
      "daughter-in-law. However, Fu Shi went on cultivating his intimacy with the Jia family\n",
      "and was still not without hopes of realizing his ambition in that direction.\n",
      "It so happened that the two old nannies sent to see Bao-yu on this occasion were\n",
      "exceptionally ignorant old women. Hearing that they were to be admitted, they came\n",
      "into the room, delivered themselves of the sentence or two it took to inquire after\n",
      "\f",
      "his health, and thereafter lapsed into a stupid silence.\n",
      "With the arrival of strangers, Silver had been obliged to drop the bantering tone she\n",
      "had begun to adopt with Bao-yu and stood, holding the soup-bowl in both her hands,\n",
      "listening in silence. It was left to Bao-yu to make what conversation he could with the\n",
      "women as he continued to eat his lunch. While so engaged, he reached out a hand\n",
      "for the soup, and Silver reciprocated mechanically; but as both of them had their\n",
      "eyes on the visitors, their uncoordinated movements resulted in a brief collision. The\n",
      "bowl was upset and hot soup spilled over Bao-yu’s hand. Silver, startled, though\n",
      "herself unhurt, gave a nervous laugh.\n",
      "‘Now look what you’ve done!’\n",
      "The other maids rushed forward to retrieve the bowl. Bao-yu, insensitive to his own\n",

      "‘Where did you scald yourself? Does it hurt?’\n",
      "Silver and the rest all laughed.\n",
      "‘You’re the one who’s been scalded,’ said Silver. ‘Why ask me?’\n",
      "Only then did Bao-yu become conscious that his own hand had been burned. The\n",
      "maids hurriedly mopped up. Not wishing to continue his meal after this, he washed\n",
      "his hands, drank some tea, and spoke a little longer with the old women, who then\n",
      "took their leave and were seen through the Garden as far as the bridge by Skybright\n",
      "and some of the other maids.\n",
      "When they found themselves alone, ‘the two old women began discussing the visit\n",
      "with each other as they went along.\n",
      "‘Well, I’ve heard people say that this Bao-yu is like a bad fruit - good to look at but\n",

      "‘Let’s see,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The brighter colours definitely wouldn’t do. Crimson\n",
      "would clash. Yellow wouldn’t be a sufficient contrast. Black would be too heavy. I’ll\n",
      "tell you what. If you were to take a gold thread and a very fine black bugle-thread\n",
      "and twist them together — that would look nice.’\n",

      "\f",
      "anyone in mind to replace her with? You might let us know if you have, so that we\n",
      "know what to do with next month’s allowance.’\n",
      "Lady Wang thought for a bit.\n",
      "‘Do I have to have four maids or five maids or whatever it is?’ she asked. ‘It seems\n",
      "to me that if the maids I’ve got are adequate, I might as well do without the other\n",
      "one.’\n",
      "Xi-feng smiled.\n",
      "‘In principle, of course, you are right, Aunt; but we have got fixed rules about these\n",
      "things, and when some people at the bottom of the scale are making a great fuss\n",
      "about keeping their number up, it wouldn’t do to have you cutting yours down. In\n",
      "any case, the saving would only be one tael a month: it would hardly be worth\n",
      "making.’\n",
      "Lady Wang again reflected for some moments.\n",
      "‘Very well,’ she said at last, you can go on paying the allowance as before, but you\n",
      "needn’t find me another maid. Silver shall have it. Her sister gave me a lot of service\n",
      "before she was so unfortunate, poor child. I don’t think it would be excessive to give\n",
      "Silver a double allowance, for her sister’s sake.’\n",
      "After promising to see that this was done, Xi-feng turned smilingly to Silver and\n",
      "congratulated her. Silver hurried for?ward and kotowed in gratitude to Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘That reminds me,’ said Lady Wang: ‘what allowance do Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou\n",
      "get each month?’\n",
      "‘The fixed amount is two taels each a month,’ said Xi-feng, but Aunt Zhao gets an\n",
      "additional two taels for Huan, so she really gets four taels. Then on top of that they\n",
      "each get two strings of cash a month for their maids.’\n",
      "‘Do they get the full amount every month?’ said Lady Wang.\n",
      "Xi-feng was somewhat taken aback.\n",
      "‘Of course. Why not?’ she replied, a trifle sharply.\n",
      "‘It’s just that I thought I heard someone the other day com?plaining that they were\n",
      "a string of cash short,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I wonder how that could have happened?’\n",
      "Xi-feng smiled disarmingly.\n",
      "‘The allowance for Aunt Zhao’s and Aunt Zhou’s maids used to be one string each a\n",
      "month, but last year Accounts reduced it by a half to five hundred cash. Aunt Zhao\n",
      "and Aunt Zhou are allowed two maids each, so that means they now get one string a\n",
      "month less than they used to. This is something completely outside my control. I’d be\n",
      "only too happy to pay them more if I could, but the cut was made by Accounts, and\n",
      "all I can do is to hand out what I am given. It’s not my de?cision. In fact, I’ve raised\n",
      "the matter once or twice with them and told them they ought to go back to the\n",
      "original payment, but all they’ll say is that that’s what’s been decided and nothing\n",
      "\f",
      "can be done about it. Actually, now that I do the paying, people do at least get their\n",
      "allowances on time. In the old days, when Accounts made the payments direct, we\n",
      "were always having trouble. Never a month went by without some one getting into\n",
      "debt because they hadn’t been paid on time.’ Another silence followed in which Lady\n",
      "Wang was evi?dently thinking.\n",
      "‘How many of Lady Jia’s maids get one tael a month?’ she asked eventually.\n",
      "‘Seven—well, eight really, if you count Aroma.’\n",
      "‘Yes, I see,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Bao-yu wouldn’t have any tael-a-month maids of his\n",
      "own, of course. Aroma still counts as one of Lady Jia’s maids.’\n",
      "‘Oh yes. Aroma is still Grandma’s maid,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Grandma lets Bao-yu employ\n",
      "her, but her pay still comes out of Grandma’s allowance. It would be quite out of the\n",
      "question to cut her pay simply because she’s working for Bao-yu. If you wanted to do\n",
      "that, you’d first have to find another maid for Grandma. And even then, of course, if\n",
      "you wanted her to be paid as a member of Bao-yu’s establishment, to make it fair\n",
      "you’d really need to give Huan another maid, too. Incidentally, the fact that Bao-yu’s\n",
      "senior maids like Skybright and Musk get a string of cash a month and the juniors like\n",
      "Melilot five hundred is due to Grandma’s own personal instructions; so I don’t think\n",
      "anyone is really in a position to make a fuss about that.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue laughed.\n",
      "‘Listening to Feng is like listening to a load of walnuts being emptied out of a cart -\n",
      "all those facts and figures! And everything accounted for — everything just and fair!’\n",
      "‘I trust none of the facts and figures were wrong, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘No, no, nothing wrong with the facts and figures,’ said Aunt Xue pleasantly. ‘It’s\n",
      "just that you would save yourself some energy by taking them a little more slowly.’\n",
      "Xi-feng seemed about to laugh, but checked herself to hear what her other aunt had\n",
      "to say. Lady Wang, however, de?liberated for some little while longer before making\n",
      "her pro?nouncement.\n",
      "‘Find someone to wait on Lady Jia in place of Aroma,’ she said eventually, ‘and stop\n",
      "paying Aroma out of Lady Jia’s allowance. Instead you can pay her two taels and a\n",
      "string of cash a month out of my personal allowance of twenty taels. And in future,\n",
      "whatever arrangements are made about Aunt Zhao’s and Aunt Zhou’s allowances, I\n",
      "want you to pay Aroma at exactly the same rate only whatever it is, it’s all to come\n",
      "out of my personal allowance. I don’t want Accounts getting mixed up in this.’\n",
      "Having promised to carry out these instructions, Xi-feng turned to Aunt Xue and\n",
      "nudged her playfully.\n",
      "‘There you are! What did I tell you? It’s turned out exactly as I said.’\n",
      "‘And so it should,’ said Aunt Xue warmly. ‘It should have been done long ago. She’s\n",
      "a lovely girl — and it isn’t only her looks I’m referring to, either. She has such a\n",
      "\f",
      "generous, open way of doing things, and she is so polite and friendly to talk to.\n",
      "There’s a strong little will there, though — plenty of deter?mination underneath it\n",
      "all. Oh, I think she’s a real treasure.’\n",
      "‘She is a dear, good child,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t think the rest of you realize just\n",
      "how good she is. Ten times better than my Bao-yu, that’s quite certain. If Bao-yu can\n",
      "keep her with him always, he’ll he a very lucky boy.’\n",
      "‘If you think that, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng, ‘why not have her plucked and painted and\n",
      "make her his chamber-wife openly?’\n",
      "‘No, it wouldn’t do,’ said Lady Wang. ‘First of all he is too young; secondly Sir Zheng\n",
      "would never agree to it; and in the third place, even if we allow a certain amount of\n",
      "freedom between them, as long as he still thinks of her as his maid, there is some\n",
      "chance that he will listen to what she says, but once we make her his chamber-wife,\n",
      "she will feel less free to tell him what she thinks of him when he is being silly. No, I\n",
      "think for the moment at any rate we should leave it a little vague. We can make a\n",
      "more definite arrangement in two or three years’ time.’\n",
      "After pausing long enough to ascertain that Lady Wang had nothing more to say,\n",
      "Xi-feng turned and went. A group of stewards’ wives were waiting for her under the\n",
      "eaves in the narrow alley-way at the back to report to her on various household\n",
      "matters. They smiled at her as she emerged, and one of them chaffed her about the\n",
      "length of her visit.\n",
      "‘You’ve been a long time today, Madam. What can you have been talking about to\n",
      "keep you so long? I hope you haven’t overheated yourself with so much talking!’\n",
      "Xi-feng stood in the doorway in a very unladylike attitude, one foot on the threshold,\n",
      "rolling her sleeves back and smiling at no one in particular.\n",
      "‘There’s a nice little draught out here. I think I’ll stand here for a bit and cool off.’\n",
      "She turned to the women.\n",
      "‘Did you say I’ve been a long time? It’s hardly surprising. Today Her Ladyship has\n",
      "been asking about just about every?thing that’s happened here during the past two\n",
      "hundred years.’ Her voice lost its jocular tone and became suddenly harsher. ‘From\n",
      "now on if I ever feel like doing something really spite?ful, I shall do it. Let her\n",
      "complain to Her Ladyship if she has a mind to, I don’t care. Stupid woman! Stupid,\n",
      "chicken-witted, evil-tongued, snivelling, misbegotten whore! She ought to wake up.\n",
      "One of these days they’ll make a dean sweep and take the whole lot away — then\n",
      "she’ll have something to shout about! Complain about me, would she, because her\n",
      "maid’s allowance has been cut? Who the Holy Name does she think she is? She’s only\n",
      "a bit of bought goods herself. What’s the likes of her doing with maids to wait on her\n",
      "any way?’\n",
      "Leaving the stewardesses to make what they would of this explosion, she strode off\n",
      "\f",
      "to look for someone suitable to take a message in to Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "At which point we leave her.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      "\n",
      "After Aunt Xue and the two girls had finished their water?melon, they sat talking for\n",
      "a few minutes longer with Lady Wang before leaving, Aunt Xue to return to her own\n",
      "apart?ment, Bao-chai and Dai-yu to go back into the Garden. Bao?-chai invited\n",
      "Dai-yu to accompany her to the Lotus Pavilion to pay a call on Xi-chun, but Dai-yu\n",
      "said she was going to have a bath, and presently parted company with Bao-chai,\n",
      "leaving her to continue on her way there alone. Bao-chai’s route took her past the\n",
      "House of Green Delights, and as she drew near it, she thought she would call in to\n",
      "chat for a while with Bao-yu and help him to dispel the sleepiness of the early\n",
      "afternoon.\n",
      "The courtyard was silent as she entered it. Not a bird’s cheep was to be heard. Even\n",
      "the storks were asleep, hunched up in the shadow of the plantains. Keeping to the\n",
      "relative cool?ness of the covered walk, she made her way round to the house. In the\n",
      "outer room maids were lying about in all directions asleep. Slipping behind the tall\n",
      "mirror and through the elaborately carved partition, she passed into the inner room\n",
      "where Bao-yu lay inside his protective summer ‘cabinet’ of net. He, too, was fast\n",
      "asleep. Aroma sat at his bedside sewing, a white horse-hair fly-whisk with a handle of\n",
      "white rhinoceros-horn at her side. Bao-chai entered the ‘cabinet’ and laughed softly\n",
      "at Aroma.\n",
      "‘Aren’t you being rather over-cautious?’ she whispered. ‘What’s the fly-whisk for?\n",
      "Surely no flies or mosquitoes can get in here?’\n",
      "Aroma looked up, startled, hurriedly put down her sewing, and rose to her feet.\n",
      "‘Oh, it’s Miss Bao! I wasn’t expecting you,’ she whispered. ‘You gave me quite a\n",
      "shock - no, we don’t get any flies or mosquitoes in here, but there’s a little tiny insect\n",
      "that finds its way through the holes in the netting. They’re so small, you don’t notice\n",
      "them; but when you’re asleep they can give you a nasty bite - a bit like an ant-bite.’\n",
      "‘That’s not surprising,’ said Bao-chai. ‘You’ve got water behind you here, you see;\n",
      "you’ve also got a lot of sweet?-smelling flowers outside; and indoors is perfumed as\n",
      "well. This kind of insect breeds in the insides of flowers and is attracted towards\n",
      "anything fragrant. That’s why you get them inside the house.’\n",
      "While she was speaking, her eye fell on the sewing that Aroma had just put down. It\n",
      "was a pinafore of the kind children wear, with bib and apron in one. It was of white\n",
      "satin lined with red silk, and the pattern Aroma was em?broidering on it was one of\n",
      "mandarin ducks disporting themselves in a background of lotuses. The ducks were in\n",
      "\f",
      "rainbow colours, and the lotuses had red flowers and green leaves.\n",
      "‘Goodness, how beautiful!’ she exclaimed. ‘Who’s it for? It must be someone very\n",
      "special, to deserve work as fine as this.’\n",
      "Aroma turned her head and shot her lips out in the direction of the figure sleeping on\n",
      "the bed.\n",
      "‘Him? He’s too big to wear that sort of thing, surely?’\n",
      "‘He wouldn’t wear them to start with. That’s why I try to make them so nicely—so\n",
      "that when he sees them he can’t resist putting them on. I try to get him to wear\n",
      "them in this hot weather, so that if he uncovers himself in his sleep, there’s no risk of\n",
      "his getting chilled. If you think there’s a1ot of work in this one, you ought to see the\n",
      "one he’s wearing!’\n",
      "‘I wonder you can have the patience,’ said Bao-chai.\n",
      "‘I’ve done such a lot of work on it today,’ said Aroma, ‘my neck is quite stiff from\n",
      "bending over.’ She smiled at Bao-chai entreatingly: ‘Do us a favour, Miss: sit here a bit\n",
      "in my place, will you, while I go off and stretch my legs? I’ll be back directly.’\n",
      "Saying this, she slipped quietly out, not waiting for a reply. So intent was Bao-chai on\n",
      "the embroidery that she sank down almost without realizing what she was doing into\n",
      "the place that Aroma had just vacated. It really was a most beauti?ful piece of work;\n",
      "in fact, she found it irresistible, and taking up the needle, began sewing it where\n",
      "Aroma had left off.\n",
      "Meanwhile Dai-yu, on her way back to have a bath, had run into Xiang-yun and\n",
      "agreed to the latter’s proposal that they should together call on Aroma to\n",
      "congratulate her on her promotion. They arrived in the courtyard of Green Delights\n",
      "to find everything plunged in silence. Xiang-yun went round to the side to see if\n",
      "Aroma was in any of the maids’ rooms. Dai-yu went up to the main building and\n",
      "peeped through the gauze window into Bao-yu’s bedroom. She saw Bao-yu, clothed\n",
      "in little else but a thin, rose-coloured shirt, sprawled out asleep on the bed and\n",
      "Bao-chai sitting beside him sewing, with a fly-whisk in readiness at her side.\n",
      "For some moments she goggled incredulously at this touch?ing domestic scene, then,\n",
      "fearful of disturbing it, she tore herself away to stifle her mounting giggles. When she\n",
      "had some?what subdued them, she beckoned to Xiang-yun to come over and look.\n",
      "Wondering what extraordinary spectacle could have put her in such a state,\n",
      "Xiang-yun hurried over for a peep. She, too, found the scene inside a comical one\n",
      "and would have burst out laughing; but in her case it was the consideration that\n",
      "Bao-chai had always been so kind to her that caused her to control her mirth. And\n",
      "knowing how merciless Dai-yu could be with her witticisms, she took her by the hand\n",
      "and dragged her away, explaining as she did so that she had just remembered that\n",
      "Aroma had said something about going at noon to wash some clothes in the lake.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘I’m sure that’s where she will be,’ she said to Dai-yu. ‘Let’s go and look for her\n",
      "there.’\n",
      "Dai-yu was not in the least deceived, and showed as much by her sardonic laugh. But\n",
      "she followed her nonetheless.\n",
      "Bao-chai meanwhile continued her sewing undisturbed. She had just completed her\n",
      "second, or maybe it was her third petal, when Bao-yu, who appeared to be dreaming,\n",
      "cried out angrily in his sleep.\n",
      "‘Why should I believe what those old monks and Taoists say? I don’t believe in the\n",
      "marriage of gold and jade. I believe in the marriage of stone and flower.’\n",
      "The words astounded her. She had still not recovered from the shock of hearing them\n",
      "when Aroma returned.\n",
      "‘What, isn’t he awake yet?’\n",
      "Bao-chai shook her head.\n",
      "‘I just now ran into Miss Lin and Miss Shi,’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose they didn’t come\n",
      "in here, did they?’\n",
      "‘Not that I know of,’ said Bao-chai. She glanced up at Aroma with a sly smile: ‘Did\n",
      "they tell you anything?’\n",
      "Aroma coloured.\n",
      "‘Oh, a lot of nonsense - as usual! They were only joking, though.’\n",
      "‘They weren’t joking,’ said Bao-chai, ‘- not this time. I was going to tell you myself,\n",
      "but you went rushing off before I had a chance to.’\n",
      "Just at that moment a maid arrived from Xi-feng summon?ing Aroma to go and see\n",
      "her.\n",
      "‘There you are!’ said Bao-chai. ‘That’ll be what she wants to see you about.’\n",
      "Aroma had to arouse two of the sleeping maids to take her place in the inner room;\n",
      "then she and Bao-chai left Green Delights together. They parted company outside,\n",
      "and Aroma went off to Xi-feng’s place on her own. When she got there she was, as\n",
      "Bao-chai had predicted, formally acquainted with the new arrangements concerning\n",
      "her pay and status that had just been made for her by Lady Wang. She was told that\n",
      "she should go over to Lady Wang’s to kotow her thanks, but that there was no need\n",
      "for her to see Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "She found this interview with Xi-feng acutely embarrassing. By the time she got back\n",
      "from Lady Wang’s, Bao-yu was already awake. She answered him evasively when he\n",
      "asked her where she had been and waited for the silence and darkness of the night\n",
      "to tell him of her unofficial promotion to his bed. Bao-yu was delighted.\n",
      "‘I hope there’ll be no more talk of leaving me now!’ he said, smiling broadly at her.\n",
      "‘Do you remember the time when you got back from visiting your family and tried to\n",
      "frighten me with all that talk about your brother wanting to buy you out of service\n",
      "\f",
      "and how there was no future for you here and no point in your staying permanently,\n",
      "and all those other heartless, unkind things you said? I’d like to see anyone trying to\n",
      "take you away from me now!’\n",
      "‘Huh!’ Aroma sniffed scornfully. ‘That’s not at all the way it is. I belong to Her\n",
      "Ladyship now. Now if I want to leave you, I don’t have to talk to you about it at all. All\n",
      "I have to do is have a word with Her Ladyship, and off I go!’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed.\n",
      "‘Suppose I were at fault and you told Her Ladyship and asked her to let you go;\n",
      "don’t you think you’d feel just a tiny bit uncomfortable afterwards when it got about\n",
      "that you had left me because I wasn’t good enough for you?\n",
      "‘Why ever should I?’ said Aroma. ‘Of course, I wouldn’t go if it meant marrying a\n",
      "thief or a murderer. There’s always another way out. I could always take my own life.\n",
      "We all have to die some time or other; it’s just a question of when. All you’ve got to\n",
      "do is stop breathing, that’s all. After that you hear nothing, see nothing - it’s all over!’\n",
      "‘Stop it, now! Stop it!’ said Bao-yu, covering her mouth with his hand. ‘You don’t\n",
      "have to say things like that.’\n",
      "All too familiar with the peculiarities of this master who condemned flattering\n",
      "‘auspicious’ talk as false and hollow, but was upset and morose if you told him the\n",
      "truth, Aroma regret?ted her blunder in having too openly spoken her mind.\n",
      "Smil?ingly she turned the conversation on to topics which experience taught her\n",
      "were agreeable to him: the beauties of Nature, the beauties of girls, girls. But\n",
      "somehow from there the conversation imperceptibly found its way round to the\n",
      "subject of girls dying. Suddenly realizing this, Aroma — it was she who was talking at\n",
      "the time — broke off in alarm. Bao-yu, who up to that point had been listening to her\n",
      "enthralled, laughed at her sudden silence.\n",
      "‘We all have to die, as you said yourself just now. The prob?lem is how to die well.\n",
      "Those whiskered idiots who take quite literally the old saw that “a scholar dies\n",
      "protesting and a soldier dies fighting” and get themselves killed off on the\n",
      "assumption that those are the only two ways in which a man of spirit can die\n",
      "gloriously, would do better to die in their beds. For when you come to think of it, the\n",
      "only real occasion for protesting is when one’s ruler is misguided, and the only real\n",
      "occasion for fighting is when one’s country is at war. If the scholar is so greedy for\n",
      "martyrdom that he throws away his life at the earliest opportunity, what is to\n",
      "become of the poor misguided ruler in the absence of good advisers? And if the\n",
      "soldier so hankers for a hero’s death that he gets himself killed off in the first\n",
      "encounter, what is to become of his country without soldiers to fight its battles—?’\n",
      "‘But surely,’ Aroma interrupted, ‘those famous men in the olden days laid their lives\n",
      "down because they had to?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Nonsense!’ said Bao-yu. ‘The soldiers among them lacked generalship; as a\n",
      "consequence, they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on. They threw\n",
      "their lives away out of sheer incompetence. Do you call that dying because they had\n",
      "to? And the scholars were even worse. On the strength of having read a couple of\n",
      "books and got up a text or two by heart, they began to cry stinking fish as soon as\n",
      "they found the smallest thing at Court not as they thought it should be, in the hope\n",
      "of winning themselves an imperishable reputation for honesty; then, if the Court\n",
      "didn’t immediately change its policy, they would work themselves into a passion and\n",
      "promptly get themselves killed. You won’t, surely, say that they died because they\n",
      "had to? What you have to remember is that Emperors hold their power from Heaven,\n",
      "and it’s un?thinkable that Heaven should lay the huge responsibility of empire on any\n",
      "but the worthiest shoulders. So you can see that all those death-with-honour\n",
      "characters you have so high an opinion of were thinking only of their own personal\n",
      "fame and glory. They weren’t really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at\n",
      "all.\n",
      "‘Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me;\n",
      "then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away\n",
      "on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently\n",
      "decompose there until the wind had picked my bones clean, and after that never,\n",
      "never to be reborn again as a human being—that would be a really good death.’\n",
      "‘I’m sleepy,’ said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit\n",

      "A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Garden’s possibilities, and\n",
      "its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on\n",
      "his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his\n",
      "appetite for more. Having recently been told that the best singer among the twelve\n",
      "little actresses of Pear Tree Court was the soubrette called Charmante, he resolved,\n",
      "for a change of scene, to go over there and look her up, so that he could ask her to\n",
      "sing him some of the arias from it.\n",
      "The only girls he recognized when he arrived there were Tresor and Topaze, who\n",
      "greeted him with smiles and invited him to be seated. When he asked where\n",
      "Charmante was, the girls all answered him in chorus:\n",
      "‘In her room.’\n",
      "Bao-yu at once went to the room indicated. Charmante was in there on her own. She\n",
      "\f",
      "was lying stretched out on her bed, but made no attempt to get up when she saw\n",
      "him enter. Nothing daunted, he sat himself down beside her and, in the familiar way\n",
      "he habitually adopted with girls, smilingly re?quested her to sing the section from\n",

      "\n",
      "                  In these quiet courts the floating gossamer...\n",
      "\n",
      "But Charmante did not respond in the expected manner. She rose up quickly and\n",
      "drew away from him when he sat down beside her; and in answer to his request to\n",
      "sing, she informed him, with a cold, unsmiling expression, that she was ‘not invoice’.\n",
      "‘I strained my voice the other day at a command perform?ance for Her Grace,’ she\n",
      "said. ‘I am still resting it.’\n",
      "She was sitting opposite him as she said this, so that he had a full view of her face.\n",
      "He remembered now, as he studied it, where he had seen that face before. She was\n",
      "the girl he had seen scratching QIANS on the ground that day under the rose pergola.\n",
      "And now here she was behaving as if his very presence was distasteful to her. Never\n",
      "in his life before had he experienced such instant rejection. Reduced to mumbling\n",
      "incoherence by his embarrassment, he coloured, and — since there was ob?viously\n",
      "no point in staying — left the room.\n",
      "Surprised to see him come out again so soon, the others asked him the reason.\n",
      "Trésor laughed when he told her what had happened.\n",
      "‘Wait until Mr Qiang gets back,’ she said. ‘If he asks her to, she’ll sing for you.’\n",
      "Bao-yu did not know quite what to make of this.\n",
      "‘Qiang?’ he said. ‘Where is he, anyway?’\n",
      "‘He went out only a few minutes ago,’ said Trésor. ‘I expect Charmante said she\n",
      "wanted something and he’s gone out to try and get it for her.’\n",
      "Bao-yu seemed to find this of enormous interest and decided to stay a little longer\n",
      "and see what happened. Sure enough, Jia Qiang presently returned from his\n",
      "expedition. He was carry?ing a bird-cage with a bird inside. The cage had a miniature\n",
      "stage fastened to the top of it. Jia Qiang was on his way inside to look for Charmante,\n",
      "obviously feeling very pleased with himself, when he caught sight of Bao-yu and\n",
      "halted.\n",
      "‘What’s that bird you’ve got there?’ Bao-yu asked him.\n",
      "‘It’s a whitecap,’ said Jia Qiang, smiling proudly. ‘It can hold a flag in its beak and do\n",
      "a little turn on the stage.’\n",
      "‘How much did you pay for it?’\n",
      "‘One tael and sixteen pennyweights of silver.’\n",
      "He invited Bao-yu to be seated while he went into Charmante’s room to show off his\n",
      "\f",
      "purchase; but Bao-yu, whose desire to hear Charmante sing was now quite forgotten\n",
      "in his eagerness to find out exactly how things lay between her and Jia Qiang, joined\n",
      "the girls as they clustered round the door-way to watch.\n",
      "‘Look! Look what I’ve brought for you,’ said Jia Qiang, full of smiles.\n",
      "‘What is it?’\n",
      "Charmante had been lying down again, but sat up when he entered.\n",
      "‘I’ve got a little bird to keep you company, to stop you get?ting so depressed. You\n",
      "watch! I’ll make him perform for you.’\n",
      "He took a few grains from his pocket and coaxed the bird out on to the stage, where\n",
      "it picked up a diminutive mask and flag and hopped and pirouetted about like an\n",
      "actor playing the warrior’s part in a play. The girls all laughed delightedly and said it\n",
      "was ‘sweet’. All except Charmante. She merely gave a scornful ‘huh!’ or two and lay\n",
      "back on the bed again in dis?gust.\n",
      "Jia Qiang smiled — almost beseechingly.\n",
      "‘How do you like it?’\n",
      "‘You and your family!’ said Charmante bitterly. ‘It isn’t enough to take decent girls\n",
      "from their homes and shut them up in this prison to learn beastly opera all day. Now\n",
      "you have to bring a bird along to do it as well. I suppose it’s to keep me reminded of\n",
      "my misery. And you have the audacity to ask me “do I like it?”!’\n",
      "Her words appeared to make Jia Qiang quite frantic, for he uttered a string of the\n",
      "most violent and passionate oaths in reply.\n",
      "‘I’m a stupid fool and I should have known better,’ he said. ‘I spent all that money\n",
      "on the thing because I thought it might cheer you up. It never occurred to me that\n",
      "you might take it like this. Well, let the thing go then! It’s an “act of merit” to free\n",
      "living creatures, so at least you’ll get some good from it. Either it will help you in the\n",
      "next life or free you from sickness in this one.’\n",
      "With that he released the bird, which promptly flew away, and stamped on the cage\n",
      "until it was smashed to pieces.\n",
      "‘Maybe birds aren’t as important as human beings,’ said Charmante, ‘but they have\n",
      "mothers and fathers just the same. Can’t you see how cruel it is to take them away\n",
      "from their nests and make them perform for people’s amusement? I coughed up two\n",
      "mouthfuls of blood today. Her Ladyship sent someone to look for you. She wanted\n",
      "you to get me a doctor so that we could find out what to do, but instead of a doctor\n",
      "you bring this thing back with you, to make a mock of me. It’s just my luck to fall ill\n",
      "when I’ve got no one to care for me or take any notice.’\n",
      "She began to cry.\n",
      "‘But I asked the doctor about you yesterday evening and he said it wasn’t serious,’\n",
      "Jia Qiang protested. ‘He said you were to take a couple of doses of that medicine and\n",
      "\f",
      "he’d come and look at you again in two days’ time. I’d no idea that you’d been\n",
      "spitting blood. Well, I’d better go and get him straight away.’\n",
      "He began to go, but Charmante called him back.\n",
      "‘Stay where you are! Don’t go rushing off in this burning heat. You’re only going to\n",
      "fetch him because you’re in a temper, anyway. I wouldn’t see him now if he came!’\n",
      "Hearing her say this, Jia Qiang halted.\n",
      "Bao-yu had been watching this scene with open-mouthed fascination. At last he\n",
      "understood the real meaning of all those QIANGS. There was obviously no place for\n",
      "him here, so he slipped away. Jia Qiang was so absorbed in his concern for\n",
      "Charmante that he did not even notice him go and it was left to the little actresses to\n",
      "see him out.\n",
      "It was a reflective, self-critical Bao-yu who made his way back to Green Delights, so\n",
      "bemused that he scarcely noticed where he was going. When he arrived, Dai-yu and\n",
      "Aroma were sitting in conversation together. He looked at Aroma and sighed heavily.\n",
      "‘What I told you the other night was wrong,’ he said. ‘I’m not surprised that Father\n",
      "tells me I have a “small capacity but a great self-conceit”. I mean, that stuff about all\n",
      "of you making a river of tears for me when I die: I realize now that it’s not possible. I\n",
      "realize now that we each have our own allotted share of tears and must be content\n",
      "with what we’ve got.’\n",
      "Aroma was surprised to hear him bring this up again. She had assumed that what he\n",
      "said that night was in jest and must long since have been forgotten. She laughed.\n",
      "‘You know, sometimes I think you really are a bit touched!’\n",
      "Bao-yu was silent.\n",
      "From the curious way in which he was behaving Dai-yu could see that something had\n",
      "got into him, but judged it not her business to inquire what. To change the subject\n",
      "she asked him about something of a more practical nature.\n",
      "‘When I was with your Mother just now she told me that it is Mrs Xue’s birthday\n",
      "tomorrow. She told me to ask you whether you intend going or not. When you’ve\n",
      "decided, she’d like you to send someone round and let her know.’\n",
      "‘Well, I didn’t go last time, when it was Uncle She’s birth?day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It will\n",
      "be a bit awkward if I go this time and run into someone from Uncle She’s. I think I’d\n",
      "better stop going to birthdays altogether. In any case, it’s terribly hot, and I should\n",
      "have to dress up for it. And I don’t think Auntie would really mind if I didn’t go.’\n",
      "‘That’s no way to talk!’ said Aroma. ‘There’s no compari?son whatever between Sir\n",
      "She and your Aunt Xue. You’re no distance away from her, for a start. And she is your\n",
      "Mother’s sister. I’m sure if you didn’t go she’d wonder what was the matter. If you’re\n",
      "afraid of the heat, why don’t you go first thing in the morning, when it’s still cool? All\n",
      "you need do is make your kotow and drink a cup of tea, and then you can come back\n",
      "\f",
      "again. Surely that would be more civil?’\n",
      "‘Of course you must go!’ said Dai-yu, before he had time to reply. ‘Surely you owe a\n",
      "visit to the person who saved you from the mosquitoes?’\n",
      "‘What mosquitoes?’ said Bao-yu, mystified. ‘What are you talking about?’\n",
      "Aroma proceeded to tell him how Bao-chai had sat at his bedside with a fly-whisk\n",
      "beside her while he slept.\n",
      "‘How frightful!’ Bao-yu was most upset. ‘However did I come to be asleep when\n",
      "she was there? And I’d got hardly anything on. How disgusting of me!’\n",
      "After that there was no further question, of course. He would definitely be going over\n",
      "for his Aunt Xue’s birthday on the morrow.\n",
      "While the three of them were talking, Xiang-yun came in wearing her going-out\n",
      "clothes and looking very dressed-up. Her uncle the Marquis’s people had arrived to\n",
      "fetch her, and she had come to say good-bye. Bao-yu and Dai-yu both rose and\n",
      "invited her to be seated, but she could not stay, so the two of them accompanied her\n",
      "through to the front.\n",
      "Xiang-yun was struggling to hold back her tears, for she dared not show her distress\n",
      "openly in front of her uncle’s people. The arrival a few moments later of her dear\n",
      "Bao-chai, who had hurried over specially to see her off, made going back seem even\n",
      "more unbearable. Fortunately Bao-chai, always more perceptive than the others,\n",
      "realized that things would become even more difficult for Xiang-yun if the servants\n",
      "who had come to collect her were to tell her aunt when they got back that she had\n",
      "made a fuss, so she did all she could to hasten her departure.\n",
      "The two girls and Bao-yu saw Xiang-yun as far as the inner gate. Bao-yu would have\n",
      "gone further, but Xiang-yun re?strained him. Nevertheless, when she had gone a\n",
      "little way towards her carriage, she changed her mind and, turning back, called him\n",
      "to her so that she could whisper a parting request in his ear.\n",
      "‘Remind Her Old Ladyship of me from time to time, will you, in case she forgets?\n",
      "Then perhaps she’ll send someone to invite me over again.’\n",

      "pen-name, Cousin Tan is therefore offering herself to her fellow-members as venison\n",
      "for them to feast on in their carousals.’\n",
      "‘Oh, all right, Miss Clever！’ said Tan-chun. “   ‘Plantain Lover”, then. You wait! I’\n",
      "ll be even with you yet. I’ve got just the name for her,’ she told the others. ‘When\n",
      "the Emperor Shun died, his two queens are supposed to have gone along the banks\n",
      "of the river Xiang looking for him. According to the legend, the two queens turned\n",
      "into river goddesses and their tears became the spots you find on the bamboos that\n",
      "grow along the banks of the river. That’s why there’s a kind of bamboo called “Naiad’s\n",
      "Tears”. Well now, Cousin Dai lives in the Naiad’s House, and she cries so much that I\n",
      "shouldn’t be at all surprised if one of these days the bamboos in her courtyard all\n",
      "turned out to have spots on them; so I think the best pen-name for her would be\n",
      "“River Queen”.’\n",
      "\f",
      "The others, applauding, agreed that this was exactly the tight name for Dai-yu. Dai-yu\n",
      "herself hung her head and said nothing.\n",
      "‘I’ve thought of one for Bao-chai,’ said Li Wan. ‘Not regal, like Dai-yu’s, but\n",
      "aristocratic, at any rate. What do you all think of “Lady All-spice”?’\n",
      "‘I think the title becomes her very well,’ said Tan-chun.\n",
      "‘What about me?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Isn’t anyone going to think of a name for me?’\n",
      "‘Oh, you!’ said Bao-chai. ‘The obvious one for you is “Busybody” — because you\n",
      "are always so busy doing nothing.’\n",
      "‘Why not stick to your old pen-name, “Lord of the Flowers”?’ said Li Wan.\n",
      "‘Do you have to embarrass me by reminding me of my youthful indiscretions?’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu.\n",
      "‘No, let me choose your name,’ said Bao-chai, ‘Actually I’ve already thought of one.\n",
      "It sounds a bit common, perhaps, but I think it suits you. You are a very lucky person,\n",
      "living in such luxurious and beautiful surroundings and you enjoy an exceptional\n",
      "amount of leisure—in fact, I can’t think of anyone who combines quite so much luck\n",
      "with quite so much leisure—so I suggest “Lucky Lounger” as the most suitable\n",
      "pen-name for you.’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed good-humouredly.\n",
      "‘You are flattering me! I think you’d better all call me by whatever name each of\n",
      "you fancies.’\n",
      "‘No, that won’t do,’ said Dai-yu. ‘As you live in the House of Green Delights, why\n",
      "don’t we simply call you “Green Boy”?’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said the others. ‘Good.’\n",
      "‘Now, what names are we going to have for Cousin Ying and Cousin Xi?’ said Li\n",
      "Wan.\n",
      "‘Neither of us is much good at poetry,’ said Ying-chun. ‘There doesn’t seem much\n",
      "point in having any.’\n",
      "‘No, I think you ought to have pen-names,’ said Tan-chun.\n",
      "‘As Ying-chun lives on Amaryllis Eyot, she could be “Amaryllis Islander”, and as\n",
      "Xi-chun lives by the Lotus Pavilion, she could be “Lotus Dweller”,’ said Bao-chai. ‘That\n",
      "would seem to be the simplest solution.’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Li Wan. ‘Those names will do very nicely. Now, I’m the eldest here, so I’m\n",
      "going to propose some conditions that I’d like you all to agree to. I don’t think you’ll\n",
      "have much difficulty in doing so when you’ve heard what they are. The first one is\n",
      "that as three out of the seven of us founding this club—that’s to say Cousin Ying,\n",
      "Cousin Xi and myself—are no good at writing poetry, I propose that the rest of you\n",
      "should let us off versifying and allow us to act as your officers instead.’\n",
      "‘“Cousin Ying”? “Cousin Xi”?’ said Tan-chun. ‘What’s the good of inventing all these\n",
      "\f",
      "new names if you’re not going to use them? I think that from now on there ought to\n",
      "be a penalty for not using them.’\n",
      "‘First things first,’ said Li Wan. ‘Let’s get the club properly founded, and we can talk\n",
      "about penalties later on. I suggest that the club should hold its meetings at my place,\n",
      "because I’ve got the most room. I can’t write poetry myself, but if you don’t object to\n",
      "having so illiterate a person as your host, I’m sure that as time goes by I shall grow\n",
      "more poetical and re?fined under your influence.\n",
      "‘My next condition is that you should make me your presi?dent. And as I shan’t be\n",
      "able to manage all the official business on my own, I should like to be allowed to\n",
      "co-opt two vice-presidents. I therefore nominate Amaryllis Islander and Lotus\n",
      "Dweller as my assistants, one to set the themes and rhymes in our competitions and\n",
      "the other to act as invigilator and copyist.\n",
      "‘And lastly, although we three officers don’t have to do any versifying, we should\n",
      "not be precluded from trying our hand at it if we want to. So if there is ever a fairly\n",
      "simple subject with easy rhymes and we feel like joining in, we should be allowed to\n",
      "do so. The rest of you, of course, have no option.\n",
      "‘Well, those are my conditions. If you agree to them, I’ll be glad to help you found\n",
      "the club. If not, I don’t think there would really be much point in my tagging along.’\n",
      "The proposed arrangement was highly agreeable to Ying-?chun and Xi-chun, neither\n",
      "of whom had much enthusiasm for writing poetry—least of all in competition with\n",
      "experts like Bao-chai and Dai-yu—and they assented readily. The rest, when they saw\n",
      "how willingly Ying-chun and Xi-chun acquiesced, felt that they could scarcely object\n",
      "themselves and added their assent— though Tan-chun did remark, somewhat\n",
      "ruefully, that it seemed a little hard, when she was the one who had thought of the\n",
      "idea in the first place, that she should now have these other three sitting in\n",
      "judgement over her.\n",
      "‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s all settled. Let’s all move over to Sweet-rice Village,\n",
      "then.’\n",
      "‘You’re always in such a hurry!’ said Li Wan. ‘Today’s meeting is just a preliminary\n",
      "discussion. Now you will have to wait for me to issue an invitation.’\n",
      "‘Before we do anything else,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we had better decide how often we\n",
      "are going to meet.’\n",
      "‘Not too often, I hope,’ said Tan-chun, ‘otherwise it will no longer be a pleasure. I\n",
      "suggest not more than two or three times a month.’\n",
      "‘Twice a month will be quite enough,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Once we’ve decided which\n",
      "two days to meet on, we should under-take always to turn up on those two days, wet\n",
      "or fine. At the same time, we should be allowed to arrange additional meet?ings\n",
      "outside the fixed dates as and when the fancy takes any of us to do so. If we leave it\n",
      "\f",
      "that much flexible, it will be more enjoyable.’\n",
      "The others agreed that this was a good proposal and should be adopted.\n",
      "‘The poetry club was originally my idea,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I hope you will at least\n",
      "allow me the pleasure of being your hostess at its first meeting.’\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Li Wan. ‘We’ll have a meeting tomorrow and you shall entertain us,’\n",
      "Why wait until tomorrow?’ said Tan-chun. ‘There’s no time like the present. You\n",
      "choose a title for us, Amaryllis Islander can set the rhymes, and Lotus Dweller can\n",
      "supervise us while we compose our poems.’\n",
      "‘If you ask me,’ said Ying-chun, ‘I think that rather than always have the same two\n",
      "people to choose the titles and set the rhymes, it would be better to draw lots.’\n",
      "‘As I was on my way here just now,’ said Li Wan, ‘I saw them carrying in two pots of\n",
      "white crab-blossom. It was so pretty. Couldn’t you have white crab-blossom for your\n",
      "sub?ject?’\n",
      "‘We haven’t all seen it yet,’ said Ying-chun. ‘How are they going to write poems\n",
      "about it if they haven’t seen it?’\n",
      "‘We all know what white crab-blossom looks like,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t see why\n",
      "we necessarily have to look at it in order to be able to write a poem about it. The\n",
      "ancients used a poetic theme as a vehicle for whatever feelings they happened to\n",
      "want to express at that particular moment. If they’d waited until they’d seen the\n",
      "objects they were supposed to be writing about, the poems would never have got\n",
      "written!’\n",
      "‘Very well, then, I’ll set your rhymes,’ said Ying-chun.\n",
      "She took a book of verse off the shelf, opened it at random, and held it up for the\n",
      "others to see.\n",
      "‘There you are: an octet in Regulated Verse. That’s the form.’\n",
      "She closed the book again and turned to a little maid who was leaning in the\n",
      "doorway looking on.\n",
      "‘Give us a word,’ she said. ‘Any word.’\n",
      "‘Door,’ said the girl.\n",
      "‘That means the first line must end with “door”,’ said Ying-chun. She turned again\n",
      "to the girl: ‘Another one.’\n",
      "‘Pot,’ said the girl.\n",
      "‘Right, “pot”,’ said Ying-chun, and going over to a little nest of drawers in which\n",
      "rhyme-cards were kept, she pulled out one of them and asked the maid to select two\n",
      "cards from it at random. These turned out to be the cards for ‘not’ and ‘spot’.\n",
      "‘Now,’ she said to the girl, ‘pick any card out of any drawer. Just one.’\n",
      "The girl pulled out another drawer and picked out the card for ‘day’.\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Ying-chun. ‘That means that your first line must end in “door”, your\n",
      "\f",
      "second in “pot”, your fourth in “not”, your sixth in “spot”, and the rhyming couplet in\n",
      "the seventh and eighth lines must end in “day”.’\n",
      "Tan-chun’s maid Scribe laid out four identical sets of brushes and paper for the\n",
      "competitors, who all, except Dai-yu, now began, with quiet concentration, to\n",
      "consider what they were going to write. Dai-yu wandered around outside, playing\n",
      "with the bark of the paulownia trees, admiring the signs of autumn in the garden,\n",
      "occasionally joking with the maids, and in general not giving the slightest indication\n",
      "that she was engaged in the throes of composition. Ying-chun told one of the maids\n",
      "to light a stick of Sweet Dreams—a kind of incense which is only about three inches\n",
      "long and has a very thick wick so that it burns down fairly rapidly - and told the\n",
      "competitors that they had to complete their poems by the time the incense had\n",
      "burned itself out, otherwise they would be penalized.\n",
      "Tan-chun soon had a poem ready. Taking up a brush, she wrote it out and, after going\n",
      "over it and making a few cor?rections, handed it in to Ying-chun. Then she turned to\n",
      "Bao-chai.\n",
      "‘How are you doing, Lady All-spice? Have you thought of a poem yet?’\n",
      "‘Well—yes, I’ve thought of something,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I’m not very happy about\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "Bao-yu, meanwhile, was pacing up and down, hands clasped behind his back, in the\n",
      "loggia outside. Hearing this exchange, he paused to address Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘Do you hear that?’ he said. ‘The other two have nearly finished.’\n",
      "‘Kindly mind your own business, would you?’ said Dai-yu. Bao-yu glanced inside\n",
      "and saw that Bao-chai was busy writ?ing her poem down.\n",
      "‘Lord!’ he said. ‘There’s only an inch left.’ He turned to Dai-yu again: ‘The incense\n",
      "has nearly burned out. What are you still squatting over there on the damp grass\n",
      "for?’\n",
      "Dai-yu ignored him.\n",
      "‘Oh well,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I haven’t got time to worry about you. I’ll have to start\n",
      "writing my own now, whether it’s any good or not.’\n",
      "He went in then, and sat down at the table to write.\n",
      "‘I’m going to start reading the poems now,’ said Li Wan. ‘Anyone who hasn’t handed\n",
      "in by the time I’ve finished read?ing will have to pay a fine.’\n",
      "‘Farmer Sweet-rice may not be much good at writing poetry,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but she\n",
      "is jolly good at reading it. She’s a very fair critic. I’m sure we shall all be willing to\n",
      "accept her judgement.’ The others nodded in agreement. Li Wan picked up\n",
      "Tan-?chun’s draft and the others crowded round to read it with her:\n",

      "All complimented Tan-chun on her poem when they had finished reading it. Then\n",

      "             White Autumn’s sister stands beside the door;\n",
      "             Like summer snow her blossoms till the pot—\n",

      "\n",
      "When they had finished reading, Bao-yu said he liked Tan-?chun’s poem best of the\n",
      "three, but Li Wan insisted that Bao?-chai’s was superior. It had ‘more character’ she\n",
      "said. She was about to press Dai-yu for her contribution when Dai-yu sauntered in of\n",

      "them himself, and go along with them (someone else carrying them, of course) to\n",
      "Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship to give them each a vase. Anyway, the beauty of it\n",
      "was that some of the effects of this rubbed off on the person carrying the\n",
      "vases—which it so happens was me. When Her Old Ladyship saw the flowers, she\n",
      "was so delighted you just can’t imagine. “Oh, look!” she said. “What a good boy he is\n",
      "to me! He can’t even see a flower without thinking of his old grannie! — And people\n",

      "Ladyship normally doesn’t seem to have much use for me—I don’t know what it is,\n",
      "but there’s something about me she doesn’t seem to like—but on this occasion she\n",

      "she was a girl to give to someone — I don’t know who it was. Anyway, when she saw\n",
      "us, she left off to admire the flowers. So of course Mrs Lian has to make the most of it\n",

      "‘Pooh!’ said Skybright. ‘Silly girl! You don’t know much! Those would be two\n",

      "meant offending her. I couldn’t take a thing like that lying down!’\n",

      "kindness, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s all that matters.’\n",

      "“chrysanthemums” was the concrete noun or the object of the verb as the case\n",
      "might be. Then your poem would be both a celebration of chrysanthemums and at\n",
      "the same time a description of some action or situation. Such a treatment of the\n",
      "subject has been tried in the past, but it is a much less hackneyed one. The\n",
      "combining of narrative and lyrical elements in a single treat?ment makes for\n",

      "‘Ye-e-es,’ said Bao-chai, doubtfully. ‘The trouble is, it’s been used before. Still, if we\n",

      "‘What about “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”?’\n",
      "Xiang-yun slapped the table appreciatively.\n",
      "‘That’s a lovely one!’ Presently she added: ‘I’ve thought of another. What do you\n",
      "think of “Seeking the Chrysanthe?mums”?’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘That should be interesting,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let’s start making a list. We’ll write\n",
      "down up to ten titles and then see what we think of them.’\n",
      "The two of them busied themselves for some minutes grinding ink and softening a\n",
      "brush. Xiang-yun then proceeded to write down the titles at Ban-chai’s dictation.\n",
      "Soon they had ten. Xiang-yun read them over.\n",
      "‘Ten doesn’t make a set,’ she said. ‘We need two more to make a round dozen, then\n",
      "we shall have just the right number for a little album.’\n",
      "Ban-chai supplied two more without too much difficulty.\n",
      "‘If we’re thinking in terms of a sequence of poems,’ she said, ‘we may as well, while\n",
      "we’re about it, arrange these titles in some sort of order.’\n",
      "‘ That’s it!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Then they will be all ready for making our\n",
      "“Chrysanthemum Album” with afterwards.’\n",
      "“‘Remembering the Chrysanthemums” should come first,’ said Bao-chai.\n",
      "‘Now, let’s see. When you remember them, you realize you haven’t got any, so you\n",
      "go and look for some. So “Seeking the Chrysanthemums” will be the second title.\n",
      "‘ Well, having found some, you will want to plant them; so “Planting the\n",
      "Chrysanthemums” will be the third title.\n",
      "‘After you’ve planted them and the flowers have come out, you’ll want to stand\n",
      "and look at them; so the fourth title will be “Admiring the Chrysanthemums”.\n",
      "‘You won’t be able to have enough of them by just standing and admiring them, so\n",
      "you’ll naturally want to pick some and arrange them in a vase so that you can enjoy\n",
      "them indoors. That means “Arranging the Chrysanthemums” for Number Five.\n",
      "‘But however much you enjoy them, you will feel that they somehow lack their full\n",
      "lustre without words to grace them, and so you will want to celebrate them in verse.\n",
      "That means “Celebrating the Chrysanthemums” will be the sixth title.\n",
      "‘Well now, let’s suppose you’ve just finished writing some verses about them.\n",
      "You’ve got the ink ready-made and the brush is still in your hand and you feel like\n",
      "paying the chrysanthemums a further tribute. What should you do but paint them?\n",
      "That’s Number Seven. “Painting the Chrysan?themums”.\n",
      "‘Now in spite of these silent tributes, you still don’t know the secret of the\n",
      "chrysanthemums’ mysterious charm and you can’t resist asking them. Which brings\n",
      "us to Number Eight “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”.\n",
      "‘And if the chrysanthemums could really reply, it would be so delightful that you\n",
      "would want to have them near you all the time - and how better than by “Wearing\n",
      "the Chrysanthe?mums”? That’s Number Nine.\n",
      "‘That brings us to the end of the verb-object titles which involve the poet himself as\n",
      "the understood subject of the action. But there remain other kinds of treatment, in\n",
      "which we consider the flowers by themselves without postulating the presence of\n",
      "\f",
      "the poet. So we have “The Shadow of the Chrysanthemums” and “The Dream of the\n",
      "Chrysanthe?mums” as Numbers Ten and Eleven.\n",
      "‘And of course “The Death of the Chrysanthemums” at the end of the album to\n",
      "round off on a suitable note of melan?choly.\n",
      "‘There you are! All three months of autumn condensed into a single sequence of a\n",
      "dozen poems!’\n",
      "Xiang-yun recopied the twelve titles in the order that Bao?-chai had indicated, then,\n",
      "after running her eye rapidly over them, she asked Bao-chai what rhyme-scheme\n",
      "they should set.\n",
      "‘I have always disliked set rhymes,’ said Bao-chai. ‘If you have a good poem in the\n",
      "making, why shackle it with the constraints of an arbitrary rhyme-scheme? Let us\n",
      "leave set rhymes to vulgar pedants; all we need do is give out the titles and let the\n",
      "others choose their own rhyme-schemes for them?selves. After all, the object of the\n",
      "exercise is to give people enjoyment—the enjoyment gained by producing an\n",
      "occasional felicitous line. We aren’t out to make things difficult for them.’\n",
      "‘I entirely agree,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘And I am sure that in this way we shall get better\n",
      "poems. There’s just one thing, though: we have twelve titles now but only five\n",
      "people writing poems. Presumably we aren’t going to ask each of them to produce a\n",
      "poem for every one of the titles?’\n",
      "‘Oh no, that would be much too difficult,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Make a fair copy of the list\n",
      "of titles, merely indicating that the poems are to be octets in Regulated Verse, put it\n",
      "up on the wall where everyone can see it, and then simply let them choose\n",
      "whichever titles they like. If anyone has the energy to do them all, they are welcome\n",
      "to try. If they can’t manage more than one, let them do just one. Skill and speed are\n",
      "what we shall be looking for. As soon as all of the twelve tides have been covered, we\n",
      "shall call a halt, and anyone who goes on writing after that will be made to pay a\n",
      "penalty.’\n",
      "Xiang-yun did not see that this last stipulation was neces?sary, but otherwise agreed\n",
      "with her, and the two girls, having satisfied themselves that their plans for the\n",
      "morrow were now complete, put out the light and composed themselves for sleep.\n",
      "As to the outcome of their plans: that will be told in the following chapter.\n",
      "\f",
      "CHAPTER 38\n",
      "\n",
      "River Queen triumphs in her treatment of chrysanthemum themes\n",
      "And Lady Allspice is satirical on the subject of crabs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE last chapter concluded with Ban-chai and Xiang-yun retiring for the night after\n",
      "their plans for the morrow had been completed. This one begins next morning, when\n",
      "Xiang-yun invited Grandmother Jia and the rest to a cassia-viewing party in the\n",
      "Garden. Touched by her enthusiasm, the grown-ups readily agreed to go.\n",
      "‘She is so excited, bless her!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We ought to let her do this,\n",
      "even though she is our guest.’\n",
      "And having promised, she was as good as her word, and arrived in the Garden at\n",
      "noon, bringing Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and Aunt Xue with her and a number of\n",
      "attendant maids.\n",
      "‘Now where is it going to be?’ she asked them.\n",
      "‘Wherever you like, Mother,’ said Lady Wang dutifully.\n",
      "‘I think they’ve already prepared for us in the Lotus Pavilion,’ said Xi-feng. ‘The\n",
      "blossom on the two cassia-trees is particularly line there this year, and there is that\n",
      "lovely clear, emerald water. When you sit in the little centre pavilion, you have water\n",
      "all round you, which gives you a wonderful feeling of spaciousness. And looking at\n",
      "water is so restful for the eyes.’\n",
      "‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia, and began to lead the way to the Lotus Pavilion.\n",
      "The pavilion was built in the middle of the Garden’s little river at one of the places\n",
      "where it broadened into a wide, deep pool. It had windows all round it and could be\n",
      "approached either circuitously from one side by way of one of the two many-angled\n",
      "covered piers leading to its left and right-hand verandahs, or more directly from the\n",
      "other by means of a bamboo bridge leading to the centre of the verandah at the back.\n",
      "It was towards this bamboo bridge that the party was now making its way. As\n",
      "Grandmother Jia stepped on to it, Xi-feng hurried forward to support her.\n",
      "‘You can put your feet down as hard as you like, Grannie,’ she said. ‘Bamboo\n",
      "bridges always creak like this when you go over them. They are meant to.’\n",
      "The Lotus Pavilion was in reality not one pavilion but two, for the main pavilion\n",
      "\f",
      "properly so called gave on to a smaller pavilion, referred to simply as ‘the water\n",
      "pavilion’ or the centre pavilion’, which was in the very middle of the little lake.\n",
      "When they were all inside the main pavilion, they noticed that two bamboo tables\n",
      "had been set out on the verandah. On one of them were ranged winecups,\n",
      "chopsticks and all things needful for serving wine, and on the other were teacups,\n",
      "tea?pots, tea-whisks, saucers, and various other tea-things. Beside the tea-table two\n",
      "or three maids were busy fanning a little tri?pod stove on which water for tea-making\n",
      "was being boiled, while at the other end of the verandah maids were fanning a stove\n",
      "on which water for warming the wine-kettles was being heated. Grandmother Jia was\n",
      "particularly impressed by the arrangements for tea-making and remarked with\n",
      "pleasure how clean everything looked—including the spot that had been chosen for\n",
      "the party.\n",
      "‘Cousin Bao-chai helped me get it ready,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Well, I’ve always said she\n",
      "was a thoughtful child,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘A lot of thought has certainly gone\n",
      "into these preparations.’\n",
      "As she was speaking, her eye fell on a pair of boards that hung from two of the pillars.\n",
      "The couplet inscribed on them was in mother-o’-pearl inlay on a black lacquer\n",
      "background. She asked Xiang-yun to read it out to her. This is what it said:\n",
      "\n",
      "             Lotus reflections shatter at the dip of a lazy oar-blade\n",
      "             Lotus fragrances float up from the swirl round a bamboo bridge-pile\n",
      "\n",
      "After hearing the couplet, Grandmother Jia glanced up at the horizontal board which\n",
      "bore the name of the pavilion and was in characters large enough for her to read\n",
      "herself. She turned to Aunt Xue, who was standing beside her.\n",
      "‘When I was a girl, there was a pavilion like this one in our garden at home. It was\n",
      "called—let me see—“Above the Clouds” because of the sky reflected in the water\n",
      "below, you see. When I was about the same age as these young people are now, I\n",
      "used to go with the others every day there to play. One day I slipped and fell down\n",
      "into the water. I nearly drowned. They had a terrible job getting me out. And even\n",
      "then I caught my head on one of the wooden pegs on the way up. I’ve still got a place\n",
      "big enough to put the tip of a linger in where it hit me. It’s on the side here, just\n",
      "where the hair begins. Of course, at the time everyone thought it was all up with me.\n",
      "They were sure that after being all that time in the water I’d catch my death of cold.\n",
      "But I got over it.’\n",
      "‘If you hadn’t,’ said Xi-feng before anyone else could speak, ‘what would have\n",
      "happened to all the good fortune you’ve enjoyed, Grannie? It’s obvious you were\n",
      "meant to have it, otherwise why would you have been given that dent in your head?\n",
      "\f",
      "The guardian spirits must have put it there to store your good fortune in. Old\n",
      "Longevity has got a dent in his head, too; only his has got so much good fortune\n",
      "packed into it that it bulges out a bit.’\n",
      "This comical allusion to the God of Longevity’s enormous cranium set all of them\n",
      "laughing — including, of course, the old lady herself.\n",
      "‘Naughty monkey!’ she said. ‘Make fun of me, would you? I’d like to tear that\n",
      "wicked mouth of yours!’\n",
      "‘It’s because I wanted to make you laugh, Grannie. Laugh?ter makes the humours\n",
      "circulate. We’re going to be eating crabs shortly, and I was afraid that the cold of the\n",
      "crab-meat might settle on your heart. If I can make you laugh and stir your humours\n",
      "up, you’ll be able to eat as much crab as you like without taking any harm from it.’\n",
      "‘In that case I shall have to keep you with me all the time, so that I am always\n",
      "laughing,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ll have to stop you going home at night.’\n",
      "‘It’s because you indulge her so much that she is so cheeky, Mother,’ said Lady\n",
      "Wang. ‘By saying things like that to her you will make her even worse.’\n",
      "‘But I like her cheekiness!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘After all, there’s no harm in it.\n",
      "She knows what’s what underneath it all, of course she does. I think it’s nice that the\n",
      "young people should feel free to joke and laugh a bit when we are all on our own\n",
      "together. We don’t want them behaving like a lot of stuffed dummies, surely?’\n",
      "While she was saying this, they all passed into the smaller pavilion, where tea was\n",
      "served, after which Xi-feng came bustling in with winecups and chopsticks and began\n",
      "to lay. Grandmother Jia sat with Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu at a centre\n",
      "table, and Xiang-yun, Lady Wang, Ying?-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at a table on the\n",
      "east side of the room. A little table was laid for Xi-feng and Li Wan on the west side of\n",
      "the doorway, but this was only for form’s sake, since both of them remained on their\n",
      "feet in order to wait on the other two tables.\n",
      "‘We shan’t want all the crabs at once,’ said Xi-feng to the servants bringing them in.\n",
      "‘Ten will be enough to start with. The others can go back into the steamer.’\n",
      "She called for some water, and after washing her hands, stood at the centre table\n",
      "facing Grandmother Jia and began shelling the crabs. She offered the first meat, as a\n",
      "courtesy, to Aunt Xue.\n",
      "‘No thank you,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I don’t need anyone to do it for me. I like doing it\n",
      "myself and getting crabby fingers. I think they taste better when you eat them with\n",
      "your fingers.’\n",
      "Xi-feng gave the crab-meat she had prepared to Grand?mother Jia. The second lot\n",
      "she offered to Bao-yu. Then she called for some ‘really hot wine’. She also sent a little\n",
      "maid to fetch mung-bean flour scented with chrysanthemum leaves and cassia for\n",
      "cleaning the lingers with and removing the smell of crab.\n",
      "\f",
      "Xiang-yun sat with the others at her own table for a while, but as soon as she had\n",
      "finished her first crab, got up to look after her guests. She also went outside and gave\n",
      "orders for a plate of crabs to be taken to Aunt Zhao and another to Aunt Zhou. At\n",
      "once Xi-feng came bearing down on her.\n",
      "‘You’re not used to this. You get on with your eating and leave this to me! I’ll have\n",
      "mine when the rest of you have finished.’\n",
      "But Xiang-yun, refusing to be put off, ordered a long table to be laid on the verandah\n",
      "at the far side of the Lotus Pavilion and invited the maids Faithful, Amber, Sunset,\n",
      "Suncloud and Patience to come and sit at it.\n",
      "Faithful glanced laughingly in Xi-feng direction.\n",
      "‘I can’t very well sit down and eat while Mrs Lian is waiting on everybody.’\n",
      "‘That’s all right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You all go and sit down. I’ll take care of everything.’\n",
      "At that Xiang-yun, too, went back to her seat.\n",
      "Li Wan and Xi-feng now made a brief pretence of joining in the party, but Xi-feng was\n",
      "soon on her feet again minister?ing to the rest. After a few minutes she went out on\n",
      "to the verandah, where Faithful and the other maids were regaling themselves with\n",
      "great gusto. They rose to their feet when they saw her come.\n",
      "‘What have you come out here for, Mrs Lian?’ said Faith?ful. ‘Can’t you leave us\n",
      "alone to enjoy ourselves for a bit?’\n",
      "‘Well, aren’t you disagreeable!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Here am I doing all the work for you,\n",
      "but instead of thanks I get grumbled at! I was hoping you would offer me a drink.’\n",
      "Faithful, laughing, quickly filled a winecup and held it to Xi-feng lips. Tilting her head\n",
      "back, Xi-feng drained it at a gulp. Amber and Sunset followed suit, and two more\n",
      "cupfuls went down in the same way. Meanwhile Patience had been scooping out\n",
      "some ‘yolk’ — the delicious golden crab-spawn — which she now offered to her\n",
      "mistress. Xi-feng told her to put lots of ginger and vinegar on it, then, having quickly\n",
      "disposed of it, ‘You can all sit down now and get on with your party,’ she said. ‘I’m\n",
      "going.’\n",
      "‘What a nerve!’ said Faithful. ‘Scrounging off us like that!’\n",
      "‘You’d better be careful what you say to me, my girl,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I\n",
      "suppose you realize that Mr Lian has taken a fancy to you and is going to ask Her Old\n",
      "Ladyship if he can have you for his Number Two?’\n",
      "Faithful tutted and shook her head. It was easy to see that she was blushing.\n",
      "‘Huh!’ she said. ‘Fancy a lady saying a thing like that! I’m going to wipe my smelly\n",
      "fingers on your face, Mrs Lian, if it’s the last thing I do.’\n",
      "‘No, no! Please! Forgive me!’ said Xi-feng, as Faithful stood up to carry out her\n",
      "threat.\n",
      "‘Even if she does,’ said Amber, laughing, ‘I wouldn’t be too sure that Patience will.\n",
      "\f",
      "Look at her, all of you! She hasn’t eaten two crabs yet, but she’s already finished a\n",
      "saucerful of vinegar!’\n",
      "Patience, who had in her hand a crab richly endowed with ‘yolk’ that she had just\n",
      "finished shelling, held it up when she heard this jibe and advanced on Amber,\n",
      "intending to smear her face with it.\n",
      "‘You nasty, spiteful little creature!’ she said, both laughing and indignant. ‘I’ll—’\n",
      "But Amber dodged aside, and Patience, losing her balance, plastered the crab smack\n",
      "on to her mistress’s cheek. Xi-feng, at that moment still preoccupied with Faithful,\n",
      "was taken completely by surprise. Her startled ‘Aiyo!’ was too much for the maids,\n",
      "who collapsed in uncontrollable laughter. Xi-feng presently joined in, though cursing\n",
      "Patience as she did so.\n",
      "‘Stupid cow! Are you too drunk to see straight? All over my face!’\n",
      "Patience hurriedly wiped it off and fetched water for her to wash with.\n",
      "‘Holy Name!’ said Faithful. ‘That was a judgement, if ever there was one!’\n",
      "Hearing the laughter outside, Grandmother Jia eagerly asked to know its cause.\n",
      "‘What is it? What have you seen that’s so funny? Tell us, so that we can share the\n",
      "joke.’\n",
      "Faithful shouted back, amidst laughter.\n",
      "‘Mrs Lian came over here and stole some of our crab. Patience didn’t like it, so she\n",
      "smeared crab-yolk all over her mistress’s face, and now the two of them are having a\n",
      "fight.’\n",
      "Hoots of laughter from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang.\n",
      "‘Poor Mrs Lian!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You ought to feel sorry for her. Couldn’t you\n",
      "spare her a few of the legs or some of the underneath bits?’\n",
      "There was renewed laughter from the maids. Faithful shouted back again.\n",
      "‘She can have all the crab’s-legs on this table, and very welcome to them!’\n",
      "Xi-feng, taking all in good part, finished washing her face and went back to help\n",
      "Grandmother Jia and the others at the centre table with their crabs.\n",
      "Dai-yu dared not eat very much because of her delicate health, and after consuming\n",
      "a little of the claw-meat, excused herself from the table. Soon Grandmother Jia, too,\n",
      "had finished eating, and everyone washed their hands and broke off for a while to\n",
      "amuse themselves, some going off to admire the flowers, some to drop things in the\n",
      "water and watch the fish rise.\n",
      "‘It’s rather windy for you here, Mother,’ said Lady Wang, ‘— especially after you’ve\n",
      "just been eating crab. Perhaps you ought to go back to your own room now and test.\n",
      "If you have enjoyed it, we could come again tomorrow.’\n",
      "‘Yes, perhaps you are right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I hadn’t been going to leave,\n",
      "because I could see how much they were all enjoying themselves and was afraid of\n",
      "\f",
      "spoiling the fun. But perhaps you and I ought to be getting along now.’\n",
      "As she rose to leave, she turned to address Xiang-yun.\n",
      "‘Don’t let your Cousin Bao-yu eat too much!’\n",
      "‘No, Grandma.’\n",
      "She turned once more as she was leaving, this time including Bao-chai in her\n",
      "admonition.\n",
      "‘And don’t you two eat too much, either. Crab is very good to eat, but it isn’t very\n",
      "good for you. If you eat too much of it, it will give you stomach-ache.’\n",
      "‘Yes, Grandma.’\n",
      "The two girls saw her out of the Garden. When they were back again, they gave\n",
      "orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid; but Bao-yu\n",
      "objected.\n",
      "‘No, don’t lay again,’ he said. ‘We want to get on with the poetry. Put the big round\n",
      "table in the middle with all the food and drink on it so that we can help ourselves\n",
      "when we feel like it and sit where we like. That will be much nicer than having set\n",
      "places.’\n",
      "Bao-chai agreed; but Xiang-yun reminded them that there were others besides\n",
      "themselves to be considered, and having first ordered a separate table to be laid and\n",
      "some good hot crabs to be selected, she invited Aroma, Nightingale, Chess, Scribe,\n",
      "Picture, Oriole and Ebony to come and sit at it. After that she had a couple of carpets\n",
      "spread out on the ground beneath the cassia-trees at the foot of the rockery and\n",
      "made the old nannies and junior maids sit down on them and eat and drink to their\n",
      "hearts’ content, insisting that they need only get up to wait on them if they were\n",
      "specially called for. Then she took the list of poem-titles and pinned it to the inside\n",
      "wall of the pavilion.\n",
      "‘Very original!’ the others commented when they had finished reading the titles,\n",
      "but went on to express the fear that they might find them difficult to write on.\n",
      "Xiang-yun explained what they had decided about rhymes: viz. that there should be\n",
      "no set rhyme-scheme and everyone should be free to choose their own.\n",
      "‘Now that’s what I call sensible!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t stand set rhymes.’\n",
      "Dai-yu had a barrel-shaped porcelain tabouret moved up to the verandah’s edge, and\n",
      "having selected a fishing-rod for herself, sat leaning on the railing, fishing.\n",
      "Bao-chai sat for some time silently contemplating a spray of cassia she had picked,\n",
      "then, leaning over the railings and idly plucking off the flowerets, dropped them one\n",

      "Mr Zhu, I had several maids, too, but — I don’t know why it was, for I’m sure you\n",
      "wouldn’t call me a hard mistress — they were always dissatisfied. So when Mr Zhu\n",

      "glancing round to make sure that no one else was present. ‘Whatever it is, you’ll only\n",
      "have another day or two to wait, I promise you.’\n",
      "Aroma was amused to see her so agitated.\n",
      "‘Why, what’s the matter? Why should you be in such a state about it?’\n",
      "Patience dropped her voice even lower.\n",
      "‘Mrs Lian has already put the money for this month’s allow?ances out at interest.\n",
      "She’s waiting for the interest on some of her other loans to pay your allowances with.\n",
      "It’s all right for me to tell you this, but whatever you do, don’t let anyone else know\n",
      "about it!’\n",
      "Aroma laughed.\n",
      "‘But she’s not short of money, she’s got plenty. What does she want to go giving\n",
      "herself all this extra worry for?’\n",
      "‘She’s certainly not short of money,’ said Patience. ‘Just in the few years since she\n",
      "started doing this, the amount she has got out on loan must have grown to several\n",
      "hundred times the original premium. And she doesn’t spend all of her own\n",
      "allow?ance, either. Whenever she’s got nine or ten taels saved up out of it, she\n",
      "invests them too. Why, just her profits alone after she’s deducted the allowances\n",
      "from the interest must be in the region of a thousand taels a year.’\n",
      "‘You and your mistress are a nice pair, I must say!’ said Aroma. Keeping the rest of\n",
      "us short while you use our money to feather your own nests with!’\n",
      "‘That’s most unfair!’ said Patience indignantly. ‘Any way, I’m sure you can’t really be\n",
      "short of money.’\n",
      "‘Not myself, it’s true’ said Aroma. ‘In any case, I haven’t got anything to spend it on.\n",
      "I was thinking more of my young gentleman. I like to keep some by me in case he\n",
      "ever needs any.’\n",
      "‘Look, if you’re in urgent need of money, I’ve got a few taels put by myself that I can\n",
      "let you have,’ said Patience. ‘You can have them as an advance on this month’s\n",
      "allowance, if you like.’\n",
      "‘I don’t really need any at the moment,’ said Aroma, ‘but may I take you up on your\n",
      "offer if I ever do?’\n",
      "‘Of course,’ said Patience, and left without further cere?mony.\n",
      "Outside the courtyard gate a maid from Xi-feng was look?ing for her.\n",
      "‘The Mistress wants to see you about something.’\n",
      "‘What has she got so urgent that she has to keep pestering me like this?’ said\n",

      "When she got there, however, it was not Xi-feng she found waiting for her, but the\n",
      "old countrywoman she had admitted on a previous occasion as a suppliant, Grannie\n",
      "Liu, with her little grandson Ban-er. They were sitting in the side room on the kang\n",
      "with Zhang Cai’s wife and Zhou Rui’s wife on either side of them, while maids were\n",
      "emptying sacks of jujubes, melons and other farm produce on the floor below. The\n",
      "company rose hurriedly to their feet as Patience entered. Grannie Liu, who\n",
      "recognized her from her last visit, scrambled down from the kang and greeted her at\n",
      "once as ‘Miss Patience’ without any of the previous time’s confusion.\n",
      "‘The family all send their regards, Miss. They’d have come themselves long since to\n",
      "see you and pay their respects to their Aunt Lian, only they’ve been too busy with\n",
      "the farm-work. Anyways, they’ve had a good harvest this year, thanks be, and it’s\n",
      "been a good year for the fruit and vegetables. This here that I’ve brought is the first\n",
      "pickings. We didn’t like to sell them, because we wanted our first-fruits to go to Mrs\n",
      "Lian and the young ladies. We thought that mayhap eating the rarities of earth and\n",
      "sea every day of their lives they might sometimes tire of delicate food and fancy a bit\n",
      "of plain country stuff for a change. Anyway, there you are! It’s a poor gift, but it’s\n",
      "given with a warm heart!’\n",
      "‘It’s very good of you to have brought it,’ said Patience, and begged her to be\n",
      "seated, sitting down herself as she did so. She invited Zhou Rui’s wife and Zhang Cai’s\n",
      "wife to be seated as well, and ordered one of the junior maids to pour tea.\n",
      "Mesdames Zhou and Zhang chaffed her on her appear?ance.\n",
      "‘You’ve got the spring in your face, Miss. Your eyes are all red.’\n",
      "Patience laughed.\n",
      "‘I know. I don’t drink normally, but today Mrs Zhou and the young ladies got hold of\n",
      "me and just forced it down me. I was made to drink, against my will. That’s why my\n",
      "face is so red.’\n",
      "‘Well I don’t know,’ said Zhang Cai’s wife. ‘Here’s me just dying for a drink, but\n",
      "nobody offers me one. Next time anyone invites you, Miss, you must take me with\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "The others laughed.\n",
      "‘I saw those crabs this morning,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Great big things. There\n",
      "couldn’t have been more than two or three to a catty. And I should think altogether\n",
      "there must have been seventy or eighty catties in those hampers. Even so,’ she said\n",
      "reflectively, ‘there probably wouldn’t have been enough for all the staff to have\n",
      "some.’\n",
      "‘Lots of them didn’t,’ said Patience. ‘It was only the top ones that got one or two\n",
      "\f",
      "crabs to themselves. The rest of them only got a taste - some of them not even that.’\n",
      "‘Good crabs like that are selling at a pennyweight a catty this year,’ said Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘If one catty is a pennyweight, fifty catties is two taels ten, and another thirty is one\n",
      "and ten; ten and two is twelve and twice ten is a tael, that’s thirteen, and then\n",
      "there’s the wine and the other dishes. It couldn’t have cost less than twenty taels in\n",
      "all. Bless us and save us that’d keep a farmer and his family for a year!’\n",
      "‘I take it you’ve already seen Mrs Lian,’ said Patience.\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Grannie Lu. ‘She told us to wait.’\n",
      "She glanced through the open window as she said this and noticed that the day was\n",
      "drawing on towards evening.\n",
      "‘It’s getting dark earlier these days,’ she said. ‘We’d better be on our way. We don’t\n",
      "want to find the city gates shut, or we shall be in a proper pickle.’\n",
      "‘Just wait while I slip over and find out what the Mistress is up to,’ said Zhou Rui’s\n",
      "wife. She left the room and was gone for some considerable time. When she\n",
      "eventually returned, she was full of smiles.\n",
      "‘It’s Grannie’s lucky day,’ she said. ‘She’s struck lucky with both of them.’\n",
      "‘How do you mean?’ said Patience.\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Mrs Lian was with Her Old Ladyship when I got there,\n",
      "so I went up to her and told her on the side that Grannie wanted to go now to make\n",
      "sure of getting to the gates in time. “Oh” she said, “she came such a long way with all\n",
      "that stuff. If it’s getting late, she’d better spend the night here and leave tomorrow\n",
      "morning.” Well, that was one piece of luck; but that’s nothing to what fol?lowed,\n",
      "because Her Old Ladyship had overheard this and asked her who this “Grannie Liu”\n",
      "was, and when Mrs Lian told her, she said, “Oh, I’ve been just longing for someone\n",
      "with a bit of age and experience to talk to! Bring her here! Introduce her to me!”\n",
      "Now that really was a stroke of luck!’\n",
      "She urged Grannie Liu to leave her place on the kang and go over to the other\n",
      "apartment; but the old countrywoman was seized with a sudden attack of shyness.\n",
      "‘Look at me! Dear soul, I’m in no fit state to see her now! Tell her I’ve already left!’\n",
      "‘Go on, you go and see her!’ said Patience. ‘It’ll be all right. Our old lady is always\n",
      "very nice to poor or elderly people She’s not the least bit pretentious or stuck-up like\n",
      "some I could mention. If you’re nervous about meeting high-ups, Mrs Zhou and I will\n",
      "go with you to give you confidence.’\n",
      "She proceeded, with Mrs Zhou’s assistance, to conduct the old woman to her\n",
      "interview.\n",
      "When they saw Patience coming out of the courtyard, the pages on duty at the gate\n",
      "stood up, and two of them came run?ning up to her.\n",
      "‘Miss! Miss!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘What’s it this time?’ said Patience.\n",
      "‘I’ve been waiting to catch you for hours, Miss,’ said the first of the boys. ‘My ma’s\n",

      "night off?’\n",
      "‘You’re a nice lot!’ said Patience. ‘It’s my belief that you’ve got it all worked out\n",
      "between you so that one of you gets a holiday every day. And instead of telling the\n",
      "Mistress properly, as you’re supposed to do, you come round to me with these sad\n",
      "stories and make me take the responsibility. When Stoppo did this the other day, the\n",

      "‘All right, then. But mind you’re back first thing tomorrow,’ Patience told the boy.\n",

      "of unfamiliar young ladies, all resplendent in orna?ments of pearl and kingfisher, like\n",
      "a bed of beautiful flowers, none of which she could give a name to. In their midst a\n",
      "venerable old lady reclined on a couch. A young woman, pretty as a picture and\n",
      "dressed in silk and satin from top to toe, sat behind her, gently pounding her legs.\n",
      "Xi-feng, the only person there she could recognize, was standing to one side of her,\n",
      "evidently in the midst of telling her something amusing. Deducing that the old lady\n",
      "on the couch must be Grandmother Jia, Grannie Liu hurried up to her and made her\n",
      "an antique curtsey.\n",
      "‘Your servant, my lady!’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia inclined herself politely from the couch and asked Zhou Rui’s wife to\n",
      "bring up a chair for her to sit on. Ban-er, bashful as ever, would not attempt a\n",
      "greeting.\n",
      "‘Now, old kinswoman,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘and what would your age be?’\n",
      "‘Seventy-five this year,’ said Grannie Liu.\n",
      "\f",
      "Grandmother Jia turned round to the others present.\n",
      "‘That’s several years older than me. Fancy still being so fit and lively Heaven only\n",
      "knows what I shall be like at that age!’\n",
      "Grannie Liu laughed.\n",
      "‘I was born for a hard life, d’ye see, just as Your Ladyship was born for a soft one.\n",
      "We couldn’t all be like Your Ladyship, or there’d be no one to do the farming.’\n",
      "‘Are your eyes and teeth still good?’ Grandmother Jia asked her.\n",
      "‘All bar a back tooth on the left-hand side that’s getting a bit loose this year.’\n",
      "‘There! and I’m already a useless old woman,’ said Grand-mother Jia. ‘Poor eyesight,\n",
      "poor hearing, memory going — I can’t even remember the names of old kinsfolk like\n",
      "yourself any longer. I’m scared to meet them when they come visiting, for fear they\n",
      "might laugh at me. There’s not much I can do nowadays except eat — what I can get\n",
      "my teeth into — and sleep. Apart from that, I share a joke or two with these young\n",
      "people when I need a bit of diversion, and that’s about all.’\n",
      "‘Your Ladyship is lucky,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I couldn’t have such a life if I wanted it.’\n",
      "‘Lucky? No!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’m just an old crock!’\n",
      "The others all laughed.\n",
      "‘Our Feng has been telling me that you’ve brought a lot of fruit and vegetables with\n",
      "you,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve asked the servants to bring them over. I’m so looking\n",
      "forward to some nice, fresh farm vegetables. The stuff we buy outside isn’t as tasty\n",
      "as your home-grown stuff, you know.’\n",
      "‘That’s the countryman’s idea of a treat,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘He can’t afford meat and\n",
      "fish, so when he fancies a little luxury, he likes to eat his food fresh from the ground.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now that you’re one of the family,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘I hope you will stay long\n",
      "enough to enjoy your visit. Don’t go hurrying back again. Stay here a couple of days\n",
      "or so, if you can put up with us. We’ve got a garden too, you know, and we grow a\n",
      "certain amount of fruit in it. Tomorrow you must try some of our stuff and you must\n",
      "take some back home with you when you go. It will seem more like a proper visit to\n",
      "rela?tions if you stay a bit, instead of popping in and popping straight out again.’\n",
      "Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia took pleasure in the old woman’s company\n",
      "and added her own persuasion.\n",
      "‘It’s probably not as roomy here as your farmyard, but I expect we’ll manage to\n",
      "tuck you in somewhere. And you’ll be able to tell our old lady all the village gossip.’\n",
      "‘Feng!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing in spite of herself. ‘Don’t make fun! She’s a\n",
      "simple countrywoman. You can’t expect her to stand up to your teasing in the way\n",
      "that we can.’\n",
      "She gave orders for Ban-er to be given some sweetmeats. He was unwilling to eat in\n",
      "\f",
      "front of so many people, however, so she told them to give him some money instead,\n",
      "and to get some of the younger pages to take him outside to play.\n",
      "After Grannie Liu had taken tea, she regaled Grandmother Jia with some anecdotes\n",
      "of village life, thus further endearing herself to her new acquaintance. She was still\n",
      "holding forth when Xi-feng, who had slipped out some time previously, sent\n",
      "someone round to invite her back for dinner. Grandmother Jia selected some food\n",
      "from her own dishes and sent them to Xi-feng’s place for Grannie Liu to try in\n",
      "addition to what Xi-feng was giving her.\n",
      "Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia had taken a fancy to the old woman, so after\n",
      "dinner she sent her back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. As soon as she arrived,\n",
      "Faithful ordered some of the older domestics to conduct her to a bath. She herself\n",
      "went off to fetch her a change of clothes. She selected two fairly modest items from\n",
      "her own wardrobe and sent them to the bathroom with instructions that Grannie Liu\n",
      "should change into them after her bath. Such goings-on were outside even the old\n",
      "grannie’s extensive experience, but she took them all in good part, and having\n",
      "submitted to the ordeal of the bath, quickly dressed herself in the proffered clothes\n",
      "and went in to take her place once more beside the couch and resume her role of\n",
      "raconteuse. In this she was eminently successful, since Bao-yu and the girls, now\n",
      "seated on all sides around her, found her simple country talk much more fascinating\n",
      "than any of the fictions told by the blind ballad-singers who sometimes visited the\n",
      "house.\n",
      "Indeed, there was more than an element of fiction in what she told them: for\n",
      "Grannie Liu, though born and bred in the country, was a shrewd old soul to whom\n",
      "the years had given a pretty good understanding of human weakness, and when she\n",
      "sensed the old lady’s pleased excitement and the avid atten?tion of her younger\n",
      "listeners, she did her best not to disappoint them by supplying from her own\n",
      "invention whatever memory and experience were inadequate to provide.\n",
      "‘We country-folk working out there on the land — year in, year out, rain or fine,\n",
      "spring, summer, autumn and winter — we never get any time off,’ she told them. ‘If\n",
      "we rest, it’s only as you might say ‘napping in harness’, like the old post-horse in the\n",
      "story. And many a strange happening do we see, out there on the land.\n",
      "‘Take what happened last winter, for instance. It had been snowing for several days\n",
      "without a stop and the snow was two or three feet thick on the ground, and this\n",
      "particular morn?ing I rose up early, and while I was still indoors, I heard the sound of\n",
      "something stirring outside in the woodpile. I thought to myself, “That’ll be someone\n",
      "stealing the firewood.” So I put my eye to the hole in the shutter, and sure enough\n",
      "there was someone there; but it wasn’t anyone from the village.’\n",
      "‘It was probably some traveller,’ Grandmother Jia inter?rupted. ‘He was feeling cold\n",
      "\f",
      "and helped himself to a bit to make a fire with, so that he could get warm.’\n",
      "‘Ah, but it wasn’t a traveller,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘That was the strange thing about it.\n",
      "Now who do you think it was, my old soul? ’Twas a young woman, seventeen or\n",
      "eighteen years of age seemingly, pretty as a picture, and with no more on her but a\n",
      "red dress and a white satin skirt, and the hair on her bare head combed as sleek and\n",
      "shining as black lacquer paint—’\n",
      "At that point her story was interrupted by a confused hub?bub of voices outside. One\n",
      "of them could be heard above the rest saying, ‘It isn’t serious. There’s no point in\n",
      "frightening Her Old Ladyship.’\n",
      "‘What is it?’ the old lady asked in some alarm.\n",
      "‘A fire has broken out in the South Court stables,’ said one of the maids. ‘It isn’t\n",
      "serious, though. They’ve already got it under control.’\n",
      "Always the most timorous of mortals where fire was con?cerned, Grandmother Jia\n",
      "struggled to her feet, and supported by the maids, led the others out onto the loggia\n",
      "to see what was happening. Somewhere beyond the south-east corner of the\n",
      "courtyard the glare of flames was still distinctly visible. Terrified out of her wits, she\n",
      "began calling on the names of the Buddha, and hurriedly sent someone to burn\n",
      "incense before the image of the Fire God.\n",
      "By now Lady Wang had arrived with the younger women, and added her voice to the\n",
      "others’ in assuring the old lady that the fire was well under control and urging her to\n",
      "go indoors; but Grandmother Jia insisted on staying outside until the last of the\n",
      "flames had been extinguished.\n",
      "As soon as they were all inside again, Bao-yu began ques?tioning Grannie Liu about\n",
      "her interrupted story.\n",
      "‘Why was the girl out in all that snow stealing firewood?’ he asked her. ‘She might\n",
      "have caught her death of cold.’\n",
      "‘For goodness’ sake don’t ask about that!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It was talking\n",
      "about firewood that started that fire just now. Think of something else to talk about\n",
      "for goodness’ sake!’\n",
      "Though privately far from satisfied, Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter rest while\n",
      "Grannie turned her inventive faculties in another direction.\n",
      "‘In a farmstead east of ours there was an old dame of more than ninety who had\n",
      "fasted and prayed to the Buddha every day of her life. At last the Blessed Guanyin\n",
      "was moved by her prayers and appeared to her one night in a dream. ‘It was to have\n",
      "been your fate to be cut off without an heir,’ the Blessed Mother told her, ‘but\n",
      "because of your great piety, I have peti?tioned the Jade Emperor to give you a\n",
      "grandson.’\n",
      "‘Now this old dame had an only son, and the son, too, had an only son who in spite\n",
      "\f",
      "of all their care had died when he was only seventeen or eighteen, to their sore and\n",
      "bitter grief. But after she had this dream a second grandson was born. He’d be\n",
      "thirteen or fourteen now — a very handsome lad, with skin as white as snow, and\n",
      "that sharp and clever you’d hardly credit it. So you see there are gods and Buddhas\n",
      "watching over us, whatever folk may say!’\n",
      "The circumstances of this tale so perfectly accorded with the idea they had privately\n",
      "formed of their own situation, that both the senior ladies in her audience — Lady\n",
      "Wang no less than Grandmother Jia — were quite captivated by it. But Bao-yu,\n",
      "whose thoughts were still on the beautiful pilferer of fire?wood, looked glum and\n",
      "preoccupied. His sister Tan-chun observed this and sought to distract him.\n",
      "‘We’ve got to make some sort of return for Cousin Shi’s party, Bao. Why don’t we\n",
      "go back now and discuss when the next poetry meeting is to be? We can have our\n",
      "party for Cousin Shi at the same time, and Grandma will be able to come and look at\n",
      "the chrysanthemums.’\n",
      "‘Grandma’s already promised to give a return party for Cousin Shi herself,’ said\n",
      "Bao-yu, ‘and we are all invited. We’d better wait until that’s over before putting on\n",
      "anything of our own.’\n",
      "‘The longer we delay, the colder the weather will be,’ said Tan-chun. ‘It won’t be\n",
      "much fun for Grandma if it’s too cold.’\n",
      "‘But she loves parties when it’s raining or snowing,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we\n",
      "wait until the first snowfall and have it then? Call it a snow-viewing party. Think how\n",
      "romantic: chanting poems in the falling snow!’\n",
      "‘It would be more romantic still,’ said Dai-yu drily, ‘if instead of chanting poems we\n",
      "had a big bundle of firewood and took it in turns to tiptoe through the snow and pull\n",
      "out sticks from it.’\n",
      "Bao-chai and the other girls all laughed, but Bao-yu stared at Dai-yu rather crossly\n",
      "and said nothing.\n",
      "After the company had dispersed, Bao-yu finally managed to get Grannie Liu into a\n",
      "corner and question her in detail about the mysterious snow maiden. Grannie Liu’s\n",
      "inventive?ness was once more put to the test.\n",
      "‘On the embankment that runs along the north side of our land,’ she said, ‘there is\n",
      "a little shrine. The image inside it is not a god or a Buddha, though. There used at\n",
      "one time to be a gentleman living in our parts—’\n",
      "She broke off at this point and appeared to be trying to remember a name.\n",
      "‘Never mind his name,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t try to remem?ber it. Just tell me what\n",
      "happened.’\n",
      "‘This gentleman had no son, but he had an only daughter called — I think it was\n",
      "Ruo-yu. She could read books as well as any scholar, this Ruo-yu, and the gentleman\n",
      "\f",
      "loved her more than all the treasure in the world. But sad to say, she took sick and\n",
      "died when she was only seventeen years old—‘\n",
      "Bao-yu groaned and stamped his foot.\n",
      "‘So what happened then?’\n",
      "‘Because the gentleman loved her so dearly, he had this shrine built for her out in\n",
      "the fields and had a likeness of her made out of wood and clay to put inside it; and\n",
      "he arranged for someone to burn incense there and always keep a spark of fire going\n",
      "inside the burner. But as the years went by, both the gentleman and the people who\n",
      "used to tend the shrine for him all died, and now the shrine is falling into ruin and\n",
      "the statue has come to life and started haunting people.’\n",
      "‘No, no,’ Bao-yu interrupted hurriedly, ‘that wouldn’t be the statue coming to life.\n",
      "People like that are never really dead, even after they have died.’\n",
      "‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Fancy that now! And me thinking all along it was\n",
      "the statue. Well, whatever it is, every so often it takes on human shape and goes\n",
      "wandering abroad troubling people. And that’s what I saw when I looked out that\n",
      "time and saw someone taking our firewood. The people in our village are talking of\n",
      "breaking up the image and knocking the shrine down so as to put a stop to the\n",
      "haunting.’\n",
      "‘Good gracious! they mustn’t do that!’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s a terrible sin, knocking a\n",
      "temple down!’\n",
      "‘Now I am glad you told me that,’ said Grannie Liu gravely. ‘When I get hack, I shall\n",
      "do my best to stop them.’\n",
      "‘My grandmother and Lady Wang and in fact just about everyone in this family is\n",
      "terribly keen on good works,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There’s nothing they like better than\n",
      "repairing temples and restoring things. Tomorrow I’ll write out an appeal and collect\n",
      "some subscriptions for you. You can be the fund’s Treasurer, and when we’ve got\n",
      "enough money together, you can supervise the restoration, And I’ll get them to send\n",
      "you some money every month for incense, How would that be?’\n",
      "‘Statue or spirit or whatever she is,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘I shall certainly be grateful to\n",
      "her for the money.’\n",
      "Bao-yu pressed her for the names of the nearest farms and villages and the exact\n",
      "location of the shrine in relation to them as well as the distance to it and the general\n",
      "direction in which it lay. Answering all these questions with whatever came first into\n",
      "her head, Grannie Liu supplied a set of fictitious direc?tions which Bao-yu, believing\n",
      "them to be genuine, carefully committed to memory and carried back to his room,\n",
      "where he lay awake half the night planning what he would do for the beautiful\n",
      "wood-thief in the days ahead.\n",
      "He went out of the Garden first thing next morning, and handing Tealeaf a few\n",
      "\f",
      "hundred cash, told him the directions for getting to the shrine as given him by\n",
      "Grannie Liu the night before, and instructed him to follow them, inspect the shrine,\n",
      "and report back on what he saw. He would await Tea-leaf’s report before deciding\n",
      "what to do next.\n",
      "But once Tealeaf had gone he found the waiting very tedious, and as the day wore on\n",
      "and Tealeaf still failed to return, he became as fidgety as a worm on hot earth. He\n",
      "was obliged to wait until sundown before Tealeaf finally came back. When he did,\n",
      "however, he was looking extremely pleased with himself.\n",
      "‘You managed to find it then?’ Bao-yu asked him eagerly. ‘Yes,’ said Tealeaf, smiling\n",
      "broadly, ‘but you couldn’t have heard the directions right. I had a terrible job finding\n",
      "it. The place where it is and the way to it are nothing like you said. That’s why I took\n",
      "so long. I was all day looking for it. In the end I found that there is a ruined temple in\n",
      "that area, but it’s not where you said: it’s at the east end of the north embank?ment,\n",
      "on a corner.’\n",
      "Bao-yu’s face beamed with pleasure.\n",
      "‘ Grannie Liu’s a very old woman,’ he said. ‘It’s quite pos?sible that she\n",
      "misremembered when she gave me those direc?tions. Anyway, tell me what you\n",
      "saw.’\n",
      "‘The temple was south-facing, like you said,’ Tealeaf re?plied, ‘and it was in a very\n",
      "tumble-down condition. I’d been searching neatly all day by then, so of course when I\n",
      "saw that, I was very relieved and hurried straight inside. But oh lot! when I looked at\n",
      "the image, I was so scared I hurried straight out again it was so real!’\n",
      "Bao-yu laughed delightedly.\n",
      "‘Of course. If she’s capable of coming to life, you’d expect a certain liveliness in the\n",
      "Statue.’\n",
      "‘She?’ said Tealeaf. ‘This was no she. It was an ugly great Plague God with a blue\n",
      "face and red hair!’\n",
      "‘Useless dolt!’ said Bao-yu angrily. ‘You can’t even do a simple little errand like this\n",
      "for me.’\n",
      "‘That’s most unfair,’ said Tealeaf in a deeply aggrieved tone of voice. ‘You send me\n",
      "off on a wild-goose chase to look for something you’ve read about in some book or\n",
      "other or heard about in some old-wives’ tale, and then when I can’t find it (because\n",
      "there’s probably no such thing any way) you start abusing me.’\n",
      "Bao-yu saw that he had hurt his feelings, and hastened to comfort him.\n",
      "‘There, there, don’t be upset! Some time when you’re not too busy you shall have\n",
      "another look for it. If the old woman is deceiving us, you naturally won’t be able to\n",
      "find it. But if there really is such a place and you do, then you will have a share in the\n",
      "merit when it’s restored. And of course, I shall give you a very big reward.’\n",
      "\f",
      "While he was talking to Tealeaf, one of the pages from the inner gate came up and\n",

      "come over herself and see to it, but she’s with Her Ladyship at the moment and can t\n",
      "get away, so she says would you mind Opening the store?room for her and getting\n",
      "some of the servants to carry them down?’\n",
      "Li Wan sent Candida to the storeroom with the keys and told one of the old women\n",
      "to go to the inner gate and get some of the pages on duty there to help with the\n",
      "carrying. She herself went and stood in the courtyard behind Prospect Hall and\n",
      "watched from below while the Painted Chamber was opened up and the tables were\n",
      "one by one carried down from it. The team of maids, pages and old nannies worked\n",
      "together with such enthusiasm that soon more than twenty of the little tables had\n",
      "been manhandled downstairs into the courtyard.\n",
      "‘Gently now, gently!’ said Li Wan as they were moving them. ‘No need to go at it as\n",
      "if all the devils in hell were after you! You’ll chip the edges off them if you’re not\n",
      "careful.’\n",
      "She turned to Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Wouldn’t you like to go up and have a look?’\n",
      "The old woman needed no second asking. Holding Ban-er tightly by the hand, she\n",
      "scrambled up the stairway and looked inside. The interior was stacked high with\n",
      "folding screens, tables, chairs, lanterns and furniture of every kind. Much of what she\n",
      "saw she could not identify, but the dull gleam of gold, the rich glow of coloured\n",
      "\f",
      "lacquers, and the artistry and sump?tuousness of the objects drew many a pious\n",
      "ejaculation from her before she descended. The door of the storeroom was then\n",
      "locked and the remaining maids came down.\n",
      "‘I wonder how energetic Lady Jia will be feeling today,’ said Li Wan. ‘Perhaps while\n",
      "you are about it you had better get out the oars and punt-poles and paddles and\n",
      "some boat-awnings as well, in case she decides to go on the water.’\n",
      "‘Yes’m,’ said the maids, and proceeded to unlock the store?room again and carry\n",
      "down the items specified. Li Wan mean?while sent one of the pages to tell the\n",
      "boatwomen that they were to pole a couple of punts out from the boathouse and\n",
      "have them by in readiness.\n",
      "While this activity was still in progress, Grandmother Jia arrived at the head of a\n",
      "troupe of females. Li Wan hurried for?ward to greet her.\n",
      "‘You are very energetic this morning, Grandmother; I didn’t expect you in the\n",
      "Garden so soon. I was hoping that you would still be doing your hair. I’ve picked some\n",
      "chrysan?themums for you to wear and I was just about to send them round to you.’\n",
      "Even as she was saying this, Casta arrived carrying a large dish of peacock-green glaze\n",
      "shaped like a lotus-leaf, in which chrysanthemum-flowers of many different colours\n",
      "were being kept in moisture. Grandmother Jia chose a dark red one to fasten in the\n",
      "side of her hair. As she turned her head to do so, she caught sight of Grannie Liu and\n",
      "smiled at her in welcome.\n",
      "‘Come over here! You must have one too!’\n",
      "Before she had finished, Xi-feng had already seized the old woman by the hand and\n",
      "was dragging her over.\n",
      "‘Come on, let me dress you up properly!’\n",
      "She began sticking the chrysanthemums into her hair, put?ting them in at every angle,\n",
      "and continued until all the flowers in the dish had been used up. The effect was so\n",
      "ludicrous that Grandmother Jia and the rest all burst out laughing. Grannie Liu, not a\n",
      "whit perturbed, good-humouredly joined in the laughter.\n",
      "‘I don’t know what my poor old head can have done to deserve so much honour,’\n",
      "she said.\n",
      "‘You ought to pull them out and throw them in her lace,’ said the others. ‘She’s\n",
      "made you look like an old vamp!’\n",
      "‘I may be getting on now,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘but I used to be a stylish young woman\n",
      "in my time. I loved to have a bit of powder for my cheek and a flower to wear in my\n",
      "hair. ‘Tis no matter: now I shall be a stylish old ‘un.’\n",
      "During this exchange they had been moving towards Drenched Blossoms Pavilion.\n",
      "Maids went on ahead with a rolled-up patterned rug which they spread out on one of\n",
      "the bench-boards that ran along the inner sides of the balustrades. Seating herself on\n",
      "\f",
      "the rug with her back against the railings, Grandmother Jia invited Grannie Liu to sit\n",
      "down beside her and tell her what she thought of the Garden.\n",
      "‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘You know, we country folk like to get a picture at\n",
      "the New Year that we can stick up on the wall. Every year just before New Year the\n",
      "farmers come into town to buy one. Many’s the time of an evening when the day’s\n",
      "work was done we’ve sat and looked at the picture on our wall and wished we could\n",
      "get inside it and walk around, never imagining that such beautiful places could really\n",
      "be. Yet now I look at this Garden here, and it’s ten times better than any picture I\n",
      "ever saw. If only I could get someone to make a painting of it all, just the way it is,\n",
      "that I could take back to show the others, I do believe I should die content!’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia smilingly pointed a linger in Xi-chun direction.\n",
      "‘You see my little great-niece over there? She can paint. Shall we get her to do you\n",
      "a painting of it?’\n",
      "Grannie Liu jumped up and going over to Xi-chun, took her impulsively by the hand.\n",
      "‘Dear Miss!’ she said. ‘To think that one so young and pretty should be so gifted\n",
      "and all! I do believe you must be one of the holy spirits born in a human shape!’\n",
      "The simple earnestness with which this was uttered made the others all laugh. After\n",
      "resting a little longer, Grandmother Jia, who intended to show her guest as much of\n",
      "the Garden as possible, got up again and resumed the tour.\n",
      "The first place they came to was the Naiad’s House. The green bamboos engulfed\n",
      "them as they entered the gate and brilliant green moss carpeted the ground beneath.\n",
      "Through the midst of the bamboos a raised cobbled path wound its way towards the\n",
      "house. Grannie Liu stepped aside to let Grandmother Jia and the rest walk on it while\n",
      "she herself walked on the ground below. Amber held a hand out to draw her up.\n",
      "‘Walk on the path, Grannie! You’ll slip on the moss down there.’\n",
      "‘Don’t you mind me, my dear!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’m used to it. You keep to the\n",
      "path, though, with the rest. You don’t want to muddy those fancy shoes of yours.’\n",
      "Unfortunately the necessity of looking up to talk to some?one who was walking at a\n",
      "higher level had distracted her attention from the ground beneath, and even as she\n",
      "said this, her feet slipped on the treacherous moss, her legs flew out from under her,\n",
      "and she landed on her posterior with a thump. The girls clapped their hands\n",
      "delightedly. Grandmother Jia laughed too, though trying her hardest to sound cross.\n",
      "‘Little monsters!’ she said, ‘Don’t just stand there laughing. Help her up!’\n",
      "But Grannie Liu bad already scrambled up unaided, and was laughing herself.\n",
      "‘It serves me right,’ she said. ‘I shouldn’t have spoken so soon!’\n",
      "‘Are you sure you haven’t hurt your back?’ Grandmother Jia asked her. ‘Let one of\n",
      "the maids massage it for you.’\n",
      "‘God bless my soul!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’m not that deli?cate! I don’t suppose a day\n",
      "\f",
      "goes by but what I take a tumble or two. If I was to have meself massaged every time,\n",
      "it would never\n",
      "Nightingale was already waiting with the bamboo blind raised for them to enter.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia led her party through the doorway and sat down inside. Dai-yu\n",
      "waited on her in person; offering her tea in a covered cup which she carried on a\n",
      "little tray.\n",
      "‘We shan’t be taking tea, niece,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Don’t bother to pour for the rest\n",
      "of us.’\n",
      "Hearing this, Dai-yu ordered one of the maids to fetch the chair by the window that\n",
      "she normally sat on herself and bring it up for her aunt to sit on. Grannie Liu noticed\n",
      "the inkstone and brushes on the table in front of it and all the books on the\n",
      "bookshelves and said that she supposed this must be ‘the young gentleman’s study’.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia smiled and pointed to Dai-yu.\n",
      "‘It belongs to her - my little granddaughter.’\n",
      "As though incredulous, Grannie Liu studied Dai-yu atten?tively for some moments in\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "‘It doesn’t look at all like a young lady’s room,’ she said finally. ‘It looks to me like a\n",
      "very high-class young gentleman’s study.’\n",
      "‘Where is Bao-yu, by the way?’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘He’s on the lake in one of the punts,’ said the maids.\n",
      "‘Oh? Whose idea was it to get the punts out?’ she asked.\n",
      "‘It was my idea,’ said Li Wan hurriedly. ‘It occurred to me just now when we were\n",
      "getting things out of the storeroom that you might perhaps feel like going on the\n",
      "water today.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia was about to make some comment when Aunt Xue’s arrival was\n",
      "announced and she rose up, together with the rest of the company, to welcome her.\n",
      "‘Aren’t you energetic today, Lady Jia!’ said Aunt Xue smilingly when all were seated\n",
      "once more. ‘Here already!’\n",
      "‘We were just discussing what sort of fine to impose on late arrivals,’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia teasingly. ‘We didn’t have you in mind, of course!’\n",
      "A certain amount of good-humoured banter followed. In the course of it\n",
      "Grandmother Jia chanced to notice that the gauze in Dai-yu’s windows was faded,\n",
      "and drew Lady Wang’s attention to it.\n",
      "‘This kind of gauze looks very well on a window when it’s new,’ she said, ‘but after a\n",
      "while it loses its greenness. Green isn’t a suitable colour for the windows here in any\n",
      "case. There are no peach or apricot trees outside to make a contrast when they are in\n",
      "flower, and there is already enough green in all those bamboos. I seem to remember\n",
      "that we used to have four or five different shades of window gauze somewhere or\n",
      "\f",
      "other.\n",
      "You must look some out tomorrow for her and have this changed.’\n",
      "‘The other day when I had to open the silk-store,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I came across a lot\n",
      "of rose-coloured “cicada wing” gauze in a long wooden chest. It was a beautiful fresh\n",
      "colour and the material was beautifully soft and light. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any\n",
      "quite like it before. I’d like to have taken a couple of lengths of it for facing quilts with.\n",
      "I’m sure it would make lovely quilts.’\n",
      "‘Pooh!’ said Grandmother Jia scornfully. ‘I thought you were supposed to be such\n",
      "an authority on materials — and you can’t even name a gauze properly! You’re not as\n",
      "clever as you thought, my girl! You’ll have to watch your tongue a bit in future.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue put in an extenuating word for her niece, while laughing with the rest at\n",
      "her discomfiture.\n",
      "‘However much of an authority she may be, I’m sure she would never presume to\n",
      "compete with you, Lady Jia. If she is wrong about the gauze, you must give her the\n",
      "benefit of your greater experience and put her right. I am sure the rest of us would\n",
      "like to know too.’\n",
      "‘As a matter of fact that gauze is a good deal older than any of you here,’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, ‘so it is not very surpris?ing that Feng mistook it for cicada wing.\n",
      "There is a certain resemblance, and cicada wing is what anyone would most likely\n",
      "take it to be who hadn’t seen it before. The proper name for it, though, is “haze\n",
      "diaphene”.’\n",
      "‘What a pretty name!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I must have seen several hundred different\n",
      "gauzes in my time; but I must con?fess I’ve never heard that name mentioned\n",
      "before.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia laughed.\n",
      "‘And what great age have you now reached, my dear, to be talking so freely about\n",
      "your vast experience? Haze diaphene used to come in four colours: “clear-sky blue”,\n",
      "“russet green”, “pine green” and “old rose”. Hung up as bed-curtains or pasted in\n",
      "windows it looks from a distance like a coloured haze. That’s why they called it “haze\n",
      "diaphene”. The old rose kind is sometimes called “afterglow”. You won’t find fabric\n",
      "made as fine or as soft as that nowadays, not even among the gauzes made for the\n",
      "Imperial Household.’\n",
      "‘Never mind about Feng,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘I’ve never heard about this kind of gauze\n",
      "before either.’\n",
      "While they continued to talk about it, Xi-feng sent someone to fetch a piece from the\n",
      "storeroom.\n",
      "‘That’s right, that’s it!’ said Grandmother Jia when it arrived. ‘When we first had it,\n",
      "we used it only for covering windows with, but later on we began experimenting and\n",
      "\f",
      "found that it made very good quilts and bed-curtains as well. Get a few lengths of it\n",
      "out tomorrow. You can use the “old rose” kind to re-cover these windows with.’\n",
      "Xi-feng promised to see to it. Meanwhile the others were examining the gauze and\n",
      "admiring its quality. Grannie Liu was particularly impressed, uttering a whole series of\n",
      "‘Holy Names’ as she subjected it to close and careful scrutiny. ‘I could never hope to\n",
      "get anything as good as this to make a dress with,’ she said. ‘It seems a terrible waste\n",
      "to use it on windows.’\n",
      "‘Actually it isn’t much good for clothing,’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "‘What about this, then?’ said Xi-feng, pulling out a flap of the quilted crimson gauze\n",
      "dress she was wearing underneath her jacket and holding it up for them to see.\n",
      "‘Yes, very fine,’ said Grandmother Jia, examining it. ‘Ah, yes, now there you are!\n",
      "This is a modern Imperial Household gauze; but you see it’s still not as good as that\n",
      "one there.’\n",
      "‘Well, what do you make of that?’ said Xi-feng. ‘That one there is only an “Official\n",
      "Use” fabric, yet this one I’m wear?ing, which isn’t as good quality, is “Imperial\n",
      "Household” !’\n",
      "‘Anyway, have another look tomorrow,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I think you’ll find\n",
      "that besides the “old rose” pieces you saw in that chest, there’s a lot of “clear-sky\n",
      "blue” somewhere as well. If there is, get it all out; give a length of it to our\n",
      "kins?woman here; I should like two lengths myself for a set of bed-hangings; and any\n",
      "left over can be matched with suitable lining-material and made up into waistcoats\n",
      "for the girls. There’s no point in keeping it until it gets mildewed.’\n",
      "Xi-feng, having first promised that she would do all these things, told the servant who\n",
      "had brought the sample to take it back to the storeroom.\n",
      "‘We’re a bit cramped in here,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s move on to somewhere\n",
      "else now.’\n",
      "‘They say that “great families live in great houses”,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘and truly,\n",
      "when I first went into Your Lady?ship’s apartment yesterday and saw those great\n",
      "chests and cupboards and tables and beds, the size of everything fairly took my\n",
      "breath away. That great wardrobe of yours is higher and wider than one of our rooms\n",
      "back home. I’m not sur?prised you keep a ladder in the back courtyard. When I first\n",
      "saw it, I thought to myself, “Now what can they need a ladder for? They don’t ripen\n",
      "things on the roofs as we do, so it can’t be for that.” And then of course I realized: it\n",
      "must be for getting things out of the compartment on top of that ward-robe of yours,\n",
      "for you could never reach it else. And yet this place here, for all it’s so much smaller,\n",
      "seems to me more per?fect than your big one. The things here are all so pretty. I\n",
      "don’t know what they are, some of them, but the more I look at them, the less I want\n",
      "to leave!’\n",
      "\f",
      "‘There are other pretty places besides this,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We’re taking you to see\n",
      "them all.’\n",
      "As they left the Naiad’s House, they could make out, at some distance from where\n",
      "they stood, a number of people punting on the lake. Remarking that since the boats\n",
      "were al?ready out they might just as well use them, Grandmother Jia conducted her\n",
      "little party in the general direction of Amaryllis Eyot and Flowery Harbour. Before\n",
      "they had reached the water’s edge, however, a number of elderly women\n",
      "ap?proached, each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they\n",
      "make in Soochow, with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately\n",
      "patterned in needle-en?graving of gold, and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in\n",
      "their sides. Seeing them approach, Xi-feng asked Lady Wang where she wanted lunch\n",
      "to be laid.\n",
      "‘Ask Grandmother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Wherever she wants it, of course.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia, who had been moving on, now turned back to tell them.\n",
      "‘Your Cousin Tan’s would be a nice place to have it. You go on ahead and lay it there,\n",
      "and the rest of us will follow by boat.’\n",
      "Xi-feng, accompanied by Li Wan, Tan-chun, Faithful and Amber, led the women with\n",
      "the lunch-boxes by a short cut to the Autumn Studio. They put out a couple of tables\n",
      "there in the Paulownia Room.\n",
      "‘We’re often hearing how the gentlemen at their parties outside have a buffoon to\n",
      "provide them with their laughs,’ said Faithful while they were getting ready. ‘Today\n",
      "we’ve got a buffoon of our own — a female one.’\n",
      "Li Wan, being a good, simple soul, did not understand what she meant; but Xi-feng\n",
      "knew immediately that she was referring to Grannie Liu and gleefully agreeing that\n",
      "they should have some laughs at the old woman’s expense, at once began plotting\n",
      "something with Faithful.\n",
      "‘You two are awful!’ Li Wan protested laughingly. ‘Anyone would think you were a\n",
      "couple of mischievous children. And what will Lady Jia say?’\n",
      "‘Don’t worry, Mrs Zhu!’ said Faithful. ‘You won’t be involved in this one little bit. I\n",
      "promise to keep you out of it.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now arrived with the others, the company sat down informally, and\n",
      "maids went round and served every one with tea. When they had all finished their\n",
      "tea, Xi-feng came in carrying a bundle of silver-tipped and silver-ornamented ebony\n",
      "chopsticks wrapped in a West Ocean linen napkin, and proceeded to lay the places.\n",
      "‘Put that little yellow cedar-wood table next to my place so that Mrs Liu can sit by\n",
      "me,’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "As the maids hastened to comply, Xi-feng tipped a wink at Faithful, who took the\n",
      "opportunity presented by this diver?sion to draw Grannie Lu aside and quietly brief\n",
      "\f",
      "her on the decorums to be observed by anyone eating with the family.\n",
      "‘It’s part of the rules of this household,’ she told tile old woman in conclusion. ‘If\n",
      "you don’t do it properly, they will laugh at you.’\n",
      "The places being now all laid, the company sat down to table, with the exception of\n",
      "Aunt Xue, who had eaten already and continued sitting where she was, drinking tea.\n",
      "Bao-yu, Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-chai sat at one of the two large tables with\n",
      "Grandmother Jia at their head, and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat at the other\n",
      "one, presided over by Lady Wang. Grannie Liu had a little table of her own next to\n",
      "Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "Normally when Grandmother Jia took her meals it was the junior maids who stood\n",
      "with spittoons, fly-whisks and napkins in their hands behind the chairs. Faithful had\n",
      "long since graduated from such menial duties. On this occasion, how?ever, she\n",
      "borrowed a fly-whisk from one of the younger girls and did some whisking herself.\n",
      "This was a signal for the other maids, who knew that something was afoot, to melt\n",
      "discreetly away, leaving the stage clear for Faithful. Fly-whisk in hand, Faithful took\n",
      "up a position on her own and darted a question?ing glance at her victim.\n",
      "‘All right, Miss, don’t worry!’ said Grannie Liu, and hav?ing settled herself in her\n",
      "place, picked up her chopsticks. She found them extremely heavy and unwieldy. They\n",
      "were a pair of old-fashioned, square-handled ivory ones inlaid with gold, which\n",
      "Xi-feng and Faithful had planted on her in furtherance of their plan.\n",
      "‘What’s this you’ve given me?’ said Grannie Liu. ‘A pair of tongs? These are heavier\n",
      "than one of our iron shovels. I shall never be able to manage with these.’\n",
      "The others all laughed.\n",
      "A woman-servant now entered carrying one of the luncheon?boxes and stood in the\n",
      "middle of the room holding it while a maid removed the lid. There were two dishes\n",
      "inside. Li Wan took out one of them and set it down on Grandmother Jia’s table. The\n",
      "second, a bowl of pigeon’s eggs (deliberately chosen for their mirth-provoking\n",
      "possibilities) was taken out by Xi-feng and set down in front of Grannie Liu.\n",
      "‘Please!’ said Grandmother Jia, waving her chopsticks at the food as a polite\n",
      "indication that they should begin. At once Grannie Liu leaped to her feet and, in\n",
      "ringing tones, recited the following grace:\n",
      "     ‘My name it is Liu,\n",
      "     I’m a trencherman true;\n",
      "     I can eat a whole sow\n",
      "     With her little pigs too.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Having concluded, she puffed out both her cheeks and stared in front of her with an\n",
      "expression of great determina?tion.\n",
      "\f",
      "There was a moment of awestruck silence; then, as it dawned on them that they\n",
      "really had heard what they thought they had heard, the whole company, both\n",
      "masters and ser?vants, burst out into roars of laughter.\n",
      "Shi Xiang-yun, unable to contain herself, spat out a whole mouthful of rice.\n",
      "Lin Dai-yu, made breathless by laughter, collapsed on the table, uttering weak ‘Aiyos’.\n",

      "Grandmother Jia, exclaiming helplessly ‘Oh, my heart!’ ‘Oh, my child!’, clung tightly to\n",
      "her heaving grandson.\n",
      "Lady Wang pointed an accusing finger at Xi-feng, but laughter had deprived her of\n",
      "speech.\n",
      "Aunt Xue exploded a mouthful of tea over Tan-chun’s skirt.\n",
      "Tan-chun planted a bowlful of rice on the person of Ying-?chun.\n",
      "Xi-chun got up from the table and going over to her nurse, took her by the hand and\n",
      "asked her to massage her stomach.\n",
      "The servants were all doubled up. Some had to go outside where they could squat\n",
      "down and laugh with abandon. Those who could control themselves sufficiently\n",
      "helped the casual?ties to mop up or change their clothes.\n",
      "Only Xi-feng and Faithful remained straight-faced through?out this outburst, politely\n",
      "urging Grannie Liu to begin. Mani?pulating the unwieldy chopsticks with\n",
      "considerable difficulty, the old woman prepared to do so.\n",
      "‘Even your hens here are special,’ she remarked. ‘Such pretty little eggs they lay! I\n",
      "must see if I can’t get one of these under me belt!’\n",
      "Under the impact of these remarks the company’s composure, which it had only just\n",
      "recovered, once more broke down. Grandmother Jia, abandoning any attempt at\n",
      "self-control, was now actually weeping with laughter. Amber, who feared a seizure,\n",
      "pounded her energetically on the back.\n",
      "‘That wicked devil Feng is behind this,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t believe a thing\n",
      "she tells you!’\n",
      "‘They cost a silver tael apiece,’ said Xi-feng, as Grannie Liu continued to praise the\n",
      "diminutive ‘hen’s’ eggs. ‘You should eat them quickly, while they’re still hot. They\n",
      "won’t be so nice when they’re cold.’\n",
      "Grannie Liu obediently held out her chopsticks and tried to take hold of one, but the\n",
      "egg eluded her. After chasing it several times round the inside of the bowl, she did at\n",
      "last suc?ceed in getting a grip on it. But as she craned forward with open mouth to\n",
      "reach it, it slipped through the chopsticks and rolled on to the floor. At once she laid\n",
      "down the chopsticks, and would have gone down on hands and knees to pick it up,\n",
      "but before she could do so one of the servants had retrieved it and carried it off for\n",
      "disposal.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘That’s a tael of silver gone,’ Grannie Liu said regretfully, ‘and we didn’t even hear\n",
      "the clink!’\n",
      "The others had by now lost all interest in eating, absorbed by the entertaining antics\n",
      "of their guest.\n",
      "‘Who got those chopsticks out?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘They’re not meant for\n",
      "occasions like this; they’re for using at formal banquets. Whoever it was, I expect it\n",
      "was that wicked Feng who put them up to it. Take them away at once and get her\n",
      "another pair!’\n",
      "The servants had in point of fact had nothing to do with the chryselephantine\n",
      "chopsticks, which had been smuggled in at the last moment by Faithful and Xi-feng;\n",
      "nevertheless, on hearing the order, they obediently came forward and replaced them\n",
      "with a silver and ebony pair like those that had been provided for the rest.\n",
      "‘Out goes gold and in comes silver!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But when all’s said and done,\n",
      "our wooden ones at home are han?dier.’\n",
      "‘If there’s any poison in what you are eating,’ said Xi-feng, ‘the silver will tell you by\n",
      "changing colour.’\n",
      "‘If this food is poisoned,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘then what we eat at home must be pure\n",
      "arsenic. Anyway, I intend to eat it all, come what may!’\n",
      "Delighted to have found someone who, besides being so amusing, had so evident a\n",
      "relish for her food, Grandmother Jia insisted on making all her own portion over to\n",
      "Grannie Liu and ordered one of the older women to go round with a pair of\n",
      "chopsticks and a bowl and make a selection from all the dishes to give to little Ban-er.\n",
      "Presently, when they had finished eating, Grandmother Jia and the others moved\n",
      "into Tan-chun’s bedroom for a chat, while in the Paulownia Room the servants\n",
      "cleared away the remains of the meal and hastily relaid a table for Li Wan and Xi-feng.\n",
      "Grannie Liu, who had lingered behind, observed them sitting down at opposite sides\n",
      "of it to begin their meal. She was greatly impressed by this glimpse of the upper-class\n",
      "etiquette which requires young married women to eat on their own when the rest\n",
      "have finished.\n",
      "‘What I like best of all here,’ she said, ‘is your way of doing things. I’m not surprised\n",
      "they say that “good breeding is to be found in great houses”.’\n",
      "The compliment was sincerely meant, but Xi-feng under?stood it in a different sense.\n",
      "‘I do hope we haven’t hurt your feelings,’ she said. ‘It was only a joke, you know.’\n",
      "The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Faithful came hurrying in.\n",
      "‘Please don’t be offended, Mrs Liu. I’ve come in to apolo?gize.’\n",
      "‘Bless you, I’m not offended!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘We were only cheering up Her\n",
      "Ladyship, dear old soul. What should I be offended for? I knew when you told me to\n",
      "say those things it was only for a laugh. If I’d felt offended, I should never have said\n",
      "\f",
      "them.’\n",
      "A chastened Faithful turned angrily on the other servants. ‘Come on! Why aren’t you\n",
      "pouring Mrs Liu some tea?’ ‘That’s all right,’ said Grannie Liu hurriedly. ‘I’ve had some\n",
      "already. I drank the tea that the young woman handed to me a while ago. You get on\n",
      "with your own lunch, Miss. Don’t mind me!’\n",
      "Xi-feng took Faithful by the hand.\n",
      "‘Yes, eat now with us. It’ll keep you out of mischief.’ Faithful sat down and one of\n",
      "the old women laid another bowl for her and another pair of chopsticks. When the\n",
      "three young women had finished, Grannie Liu, who had been watching them,\n",
      "remarked on how little they had eaten.\n",
      "‘None of you here seems to eat more than a bite or two,’ she said. ‘It’s a marvel to\n",
      "me you’re not famished. No wonder you all look as if the wind could blow you over!’\n",
      "‘There is a lot left over today,’ Faithful commented. ‘Where are all the others?’ she\n",
      "asked the old serving-woman.\n",
      "‘They’re still here in waiting, Miss,’ said the old woman. ‘They’re not off duty yet.\n",
      "We can give it to them, if you like, before they go.’\n",
      "‘They’ll never finish all this lot,’ said Faithful. ‘Pick out a couple of bowlfuls and take\n",
      "them to Patience in Mrs Lian’s room.’\n",
      "‘No need,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She’s had her lunch already.’\n",
      "‘If she can’t eat it herself, she can give it to the cat,’ said Faithful.\n",
      "The old woman put the contents of two of the dishes into a box and carried it off to\n",
      "give Patience.\n",
      "‘Where’s Candida?’ said Faithful.\n",
      "‘She’s in there eating with the rest,’ said Li Wan. ‘What do you want her for?’\n",
      "‘It’s all right,’ said Faithful. ‘Nothing.’\n",
      "‘Aroma isn’t here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why don’t you send her a couple of dishes?’\n",
      "Faithful gave orders for this to be done. She inquired of the remaining old women\n",
      "whether the boxes for the drinking party were ready yet.\n",
      "‘I think they’ll be a while yet,’ said one of them.\n",
      "‘Hurry them up a bit, will you?’ said Faithful, and the old woman went off to do her\n",
      "bidding.\n",
      "The young women, accompanied by Grannie Liu, now went into Tan-chun’s room,\n",
      "where Grandmother Jia and the others were chatting and laughing together.\n",
      "This room, a three-frame apartment which Tan-chun, who loved spaciousness, had\n",
      "left undivided, had in the midst of it a large rosewood table with a Yunnanese marble\n",
      "top piled high with specimen-books of calligraphy and littered with several dozen\n",
      "miscellaneous ink-stones and a small forest of writing-brushes standing in\n",
      "brush-holders and brush-stands of every conceivable shape and size. On one side of\n",
      "\f",
      "the table was a bucket-sized ‘pincushion’ flower-vase of Ru ware stuck all over with\n",
      "snow-white pompom chrysanthemums. On the west wall of the room hung a\n",
      "‘Landscape in Mist and Rain’ by Mi Fei, flanked by a pair of scrolls bearing a couplet\n",
      "written by the Tang calligrapher Yan Zhen-qing:\n",
      "\n",
      "   My heart has discovered true ease amidst the clouds and mists of the\n",
      "mountains;\n",
      "   My life has gained a fierce freedom from the rocks and torrents of the fells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against the wall beneath was a long, high table. On it, to?wards the left, stood a large\n",
      "Northern Song porcelain dish heaped with those ornamental citrus fruits they call\n",
      "‘Buddha’s hands’, whose brilliant yellow contrasted agreeably with the greenish blue\n",
      "of the glaze. To the right a white jade chime in the form of a two-headed fish hung in\n",
      "a varnished wooden frame to whose side a tiny hammer was attached. Ban-er, whom\n",
      "growing familiarity was making bolder, was with diffi?culty restrained from\n",
      "unfastening the hammer and striking the fish with it. He then said that he wanted\n",
      "one of the ‘yellow things’ to eat, and Tan-chun selected a Buddha’s hand from the\n",
      "dish and gave it to him.\n",
      "‘There you are,’ she said, ‘but it’s only to play with. It isn’t good to eat.’\n",
      "On the opposite side of the room was a large four-poster bed whose silk gauze\n",
      "hangings had a pattern of bright green plants and insects in reversible embroidery.\n",
      "Ban-er ran over to it and began identifying the insects:\n",
      "‘That’s a cricket. That’s a grasshopper\n",
      "Grannie Liu dealt him a hefty slap:\n",
      "‘Little varmint! Who said you could go running around putting your dirty hands on\n",
      "everything? Just because you’ve been allowed in to have a look, it doesn’t mean you\n",
      "have to start getting above yourself.’\n",
      "The blow had been hard enough to make him cry, and it took the combined efforts of\n",
      "the others present to comfort him.\n",
      "Meanwhile Grandmother Jia had been looking through the gauze-covered windows\n",
      "into the courtyard behind.\n",
      "‘Those paulownias by the verandah eaves are still very fine,’ she remarked. ‘It’s a\n",
      "pity they’ve begun losing their leaves.’\n",
      "A little gust of wind blew across the courtyard as she spoke, bearing on it a faint\n",
      "strain of music from outside.\n",
      "‘That must be a wedding,’ she said. ‘I didn’t realize we were so near to the street\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "‘You could never hear the street from here, Mother,’ said Lady Wang, laughing.\n",
      "\f",
      "‘Those are our twelve little actresses rehearsing.’\n",
      "‘If they’re going to be playing anyway,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘we may as well have\n",
      "them to play in here. It will be entertainment for us and it will make an outing of\n",
      "sorts for them.’\n",
      "Xi-feng at once ordered the troupe to be summoned, and made hurried\n",
      "arrangements for a long table to be brought in, that the actresses could sit down to\n",
      "perform at, and covered with a red rug.\n",
      "‘Much better put them in Xi-chun’s water pavilion,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The\n",
      "music will sound even better coming across the water. Later on when we take our\n",
      "wine we can sit in the downstairs of the Painted Chamber. It’s nice and open there\n",
      "and close enough to the pavilion for listening to the music from.’\n",
      "Everyone agreed that this would be a good idea.\n",
      "Grandmother Jia now turned with a smile to Aunt Xue.\n",
      "‘I think we’d better be on our way now. These young people don’t much like having\n",
      "visitors, you know. They are terrified of getting their rooms dirty. We mustn’t be\n",
      "tactless and overstay our welcome. I think we’d better take another little turn in the\n",
      "boats now, and then it will be just about time to go and have our drinks.’\n",
      "‘How unfair!’ said Tan-chun laughing. ‘When I ask you or Mother or Aunt Xue to\n",
      "come here, you never do.’\n",
      "‘Oh, my little Tan is all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s those two Yus who are so\n",
      "detestable. We shall go and brawl in their rooms later on when we are drunk!’\n",
      "The others (including the detestable Yus) all laughed.\n",
      "Emerging in a single group from the Autumn Studio, they arrived after a short walk at\n",
      "Duckweed Island, where their specially imported Soochow boatwomen were waiting\n",
      "with two elegantly decorated punts. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Grannie\n",
      "Liu, Faithful and Silver were handed one by one aboard the first one. They were\n",
      "joined a little later by Li Wan, and finally by Xi-feng, who stood in the bows and said\n",
      "she was going to punt.\n",
      "‘Feng!’ Grandmother Jia called nervously from inside the cabin. ‘It’s too dangerous\n",
      "to fool about. It isn’t like the open river here, but it’s still quite deep. Come in here\n",
      "with us!’\n",
      "‘It’s all right, Grannie! Don’t be nervous!’ said Xi-feng, laughing, as she shoved off\n",
      "from the bank. But the punt, being somewhat overloaded, was hard to manage, so\n",
      "that by the time they were in midstream she was already in difficulties and had to\n",
      "hand the pole over to one of the boatwomen and sit down rather abruptly on her\n",
      "haunches.\n",
      "When their elders were safely away, Bao-yu and the six girls got into the second punt\n",
      "and were poled along in the wake of the first one. The maids and older women\n",
      "\f",
      "proceeded in the same direction on foot along the shore.\n",
      "These raggedy-looking lotus-leaves everywhere are rather ugly,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t\n",
      "think why they haven’t been cleared away.’\n",
      "‘Now when could they have been?’ said Bao-chai. ‘With parties being held here\n",
      "practically every day this autumn, the Garden has never been free long enough.’\n",
      "‘I can’t abide the poems of Li Shang-yin,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but there is just one line of\n",
      "his that I am rather fond of:\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaves but dead lotus-leaves for the rain to play on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trust you not to “leave the dead lotus-leaves”!’\n",
      "‘It is a good line, I agree,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ll tell them that in future they are not to\n",
      "remove them.’\n",
      "They were drifting into Flowery Harbour now, and the dank chill of its creeper-hung\n",
      "grotto seemed to penetrate their bones. Dead reeds and dying caltrop-leaves added\n",
      "to the autumnal melancholy of the scene. A clean, airy-looking build?ing was visible\n",
      "at some distance beyond the bank above.\n",
      "‘Isn’t that Bao-chai’s place?’ said Grandmother Jia.\n",
      "On being told that it was, she asked the women to moor the boats there, and having\n",
      "disembarked, ascended from the landing-stage by a flight of cloud-shaped stone\n",
      "steps and proceeded, with the rest of the party, to the gateway of Allspice Court.\n",
      "A delectable fragrance assailed their nostrils as they en?tered. Outside the house the\n",
      "leaves of the mysterious, un?namable creepers had turned an even intenser green in\n",
      "the colder weather, and where before there had been flowers, there now hung\n",
      "trusses of the most beautiful coral-red berries. Indoors, however, it was stark and\n",
      "bare. The only decoration in Bao-chai’s room was a vase of the cheaper kind of Ding\n",
      "ware on the table, with a few chrysanthemums in it. Apart from the flowers there\n",
      "were only a few books and some tea?-things on the table. The bed-hangings were of\n",
      "black gauze, and the quilts and covers were of the same forbidding plain?ness as the\n",
      "hangings.\n",
      "‘This child is really too self-effacing!’ Grandmother Jia mut?tered, evidently\n",
      "shocked by what she saw. The tone in which she addressed Bao-chai was a somewhat\n",
      "reproachful one: ‘If you haven’t any things of your own, why ever didn’t you as your\n",
      "Aunt Wang for some? I’m afraid I never thought about it before. Of course. I realize\n",
      "now. You must have left all your stuff behind in Nanking.’\n",
      "She at once ordered Faithful to supply Bao-chai with some Ornaments, and then\n",
      "turned, with some asperity, on Xi-feng.\n",
      "‘Really, Feng! I do think it rather stingy of you! Couldn’t you have spared your\n",
      "\f",
      "cousin a few knick-knacks?’\n",
      "Lady Wang and Xi-feng both laughed.\n",
      "‘She said herself that she didn’t want any. We gave her some things, but she sent\n",
      "them all back again.’\n",
      "Aunt Xue corroborated this.\n",
      "‘She was just the same in Nanking, Lady Jia. She’s never cared much for that sort of\n",
      "thing.’\n",
      "Grandmother Jia shook her head.\n",
      "‘That will never do. It saves trouble, no doubt, to keep one’s room so bare. But\n",
      "what would any of our relations think if they were to come here and see this?\n",
      "Besides, it isn’t natural for a young girl to be so austere. If girls are to live so austerely,\n",
      "what sort of a stable ought an old woman like me to live in? Think of the descriptions\n",
      "of young ladies’ boudoirs you find in plays and romances such exquisite refinement\n",
      "of luxury! I’m not exactly suggesting that you should emulate them — but you\n",
      "shouldn’t fall too far short, all the same. After all, when the things are there for the\n",
      "asking, it seems silly not to use them. Use them sparingly, by all means, if your tastes\n",
      "are on the austere side; but don’t dispense with them alto?gether! I’ve always had\n",
      "rather a flair for decorating interiors. I don’t exercise it much nowadays, because I’m\n",
      "too old; but I think the girls have inherited a little of it from me. The thing one always\n",
      "has to be on one’s guard against is bad taste - which generally means no more than\n",
      "arranging good things in a bad way. I don’t think any of my girls has bad taste. Now\n",
      "why don’t you let me decorate this room for you? I promise you it shall look both\n",
      "dignified and austere. There are still a few things tucked away in my dowry that\n",
      "Bao-yu doesn’t know about. (I wouldn’t let him see them, or they’d have disappeared\n",
      "long ago!).’\n",
      "She called Faithful to her and instructed her what to bring. ‘I want you to fetch that\n",
      "bonseki and the little screen and the little tripod of smoky agate. Those three things\n",
      "arranged on the table here will be enough. There’s also a set of white satin hangings\n",
      "hand-painted in black ink. I’d like you to get them too and put them up in place of\n",
      "these bed-curtains.’\n",
      "‘Yes, madam,’ said Faithful. ‘But these things are all stored in the attic over the east\n",
      "wing and I’m not sure which chests they’re in, so it will take me quite a while to find\n",
      "them. Can’t I leave it until tomorrow?’\n",
      "‘Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is immaterial,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘as long\n",
      "as it gets done.’\n",
      "After sitting for a while longer in Bao-chai’s room, they got up and again moved on to\n",
      "the covered area underneath the Painted Chamber. élégante and the other little\n",
      "actresses came forward to make their curtseys and to inquire what pieces they\n",
      "\f",
      "should play.\n",
      "‘Choose a few of the ones you are most familiar with,’ said Grandmother Jia, and\n",
      "the little actresses went off to the Lotus Pavilion. No further mention of them is\n",
      "made in this part of our narrative.\n",
      "Supervised by Xi-feng, the servants had by now completed the seating arrangements\n",
      "for the drinking-party. Two wooden couches covered with woven grass mats and\n",
      "embroidered cushions had been placed side by side at the head. Each had a pair of\n",
      "carved lacquer tables in front of it. On one of each pair there was an incense set — a\n",
      "miniature metal vase, a miniature cassolette and a miniature tripod, all for burning\n",
      "different kinds of incense in - on the other was a large lacquer box. These two\n",
      "couches with a pair of tables each were for Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue.\n",
      "Of the places ranged below them only one, Lady Wang’s, had a couch and two tables;\n",
      "all the rest had one table and a chair. On the east side, nearest to Grandmother Jia,\n",
      "sat Grannie Liu with Lady Wang below her; on the west side Xiang-yun had been laid\n",
      "first, nearest to Aunt Xue, then Bao-chai, then Dai-yu, then Ying-chun, then Tan-chun,\n",
      "then Xi-chun, with Bao-yu in the very last place of all. A table and chairs had been\n",
      "laid for Li Wan and Xi-feng between the inner and outer mosquito screens which\n",
      "protected those inside the room from the insects of the lake.\n",
      "The little lacquer tables were of many different shapes — some four-lobed like a\n",
      "begonia leaf, some five-lobed like plum-flowers, some shaped like multi-petalled\n",
      "sunflowers, some like lotus leaves, some square, some round - and the lacquer boxes\n",
      "were designed to match the shapes of the tables. Everyone had his own nielloed\n",
      "silver ‘self-service’ wine kettle and a little polychrome cloisonné winecup.\n",
      "‘Well now,’ said Grandmother Jia when they were all seated, ‘let’s have a cup or\n",
      "two to warm up on, and after that I think it would be more fun if we played a\n",
      "drinking game.’\n",
      "‘I am sure you know lots of good ones,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but what about the rest of\n",
      "us? I am afraid this is just a trick to make us all drunk. We might just as well drink the\n",
      "extra cups now, since we’re bound to lose anyway, and forget about the game!’\n",
      "‘ Come, Mrs Xue, you’re being excessively modest all of a sudden!’ said\n",
      "Grandmother Jia. ‘But perhaps you think I’m too old for this sort of thing?’\n",
      "‘No, no, no. And I’m not being modest, either,’ said Aunt Xue, laughing. ‘I am afraid\n",
      "of not being able to give the answers and making a fool of myself.’\n",
      "‘Even if we can’t give the answers,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it only means drinking a few\n",
      "more cups of wine. And if we get drunk, we can go to bed. No one is going to laugh at\n",
      "us, I hope!’\n",
      "Aunt Xue smiled and nodded.\n",
      "‘Very well, I shall do as I am told then. But I think Lady Jia ought to drink a cup first,\n",
      "\f",
      "as proposer of the game.’\n",
      "‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia, and drained off a cup forthwith.\n",
      "Xi-feng stepped forward into their midst to make a proposal:\n",
      "‘If you are going to play a drinking game, may I suggest that you have Faithful as\n",

      "‘If Faithful is going to be our M.C.,’ said Lady Wang, ‘we can’t possibly have her\n",

      "When the chair had been brought, Faithful, offering polite resistance, allowed herself\n",

      "keeping her end up to have noticed.\n",
      "‘A four and a six, the Painted Screen,’ said Faithful.\n",

      "Faithful began to lay.\n",
