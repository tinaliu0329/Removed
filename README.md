# DH100-Individual-Project 

*****
This project is for Digital Humanity 100 course (2021 Summer).
My research builds upon the pre-existing scholarship on the authorship of The Story of the Stone, the most acclaimed long novel in Chinese literary history. Instead of focusing on the various editions of the original texts, I pay attention to Hawkes and Minford’s translation in English in order to investigate the degree of homogeneity achieved by translation and textual manipulation.

This research is going to answer the following questions:
1) How homogeneous Hawkes’ first 80 chapters is? 
2) How does it compare to Chan’s analysis of the original text? 
3) How similar Hawkes’ translation is to Minford’s last 40 chapter?

This repository involves the text folder and the codes.
