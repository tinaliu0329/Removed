CHAPTER 1



Zhen Shi-yin makes the Stone’s
acquaintance in a dream
And Jia Yu-cun finds that poverty is not incompatible
with romantic feelings

GENTLE READER,



What, you may ask, was the origin of this book?
Though the answer to this question may at first seem to border on the absurd,
reflection will show that there is a good deal more in it than meets the eye.
     Long ago, when the goddess Nǚ-wa was repairing the sky, she melted down a
great quantity of rock and, on the Incredible Crags of the Great Fable Mountains,
moulded the amalgam into thirty-six thousand, five hundred and one large building
blocks, each measuring seventy-two feet by a hundred and forty-four feet square.
She used thirty-six thousand five hundred of these blocks in the course of her
building operations, leaving a single odd block unused, which lay, all on its own, at
the foot of Greensickness Peak in the aforementioned mountains.
    Now this block of stone, having undergone the melting and molding of a goddess,
possessed magic powers. It could move about at will and could grow or shrink to any
size it wanted. Observing that all the other blocks had been used for celestial repairs
and that it was the only one to have been rejected as unworthy, it became filled with
shame and resentment and passed its days in sorrow and lamentation.
     One day, in the midst of its lamenting, it saw a monk and a Taoist approaching
from a great distance, each of them remarkable for certain eccentricities of manner
and appearance. When they arrived at the foot of Greensickness Peak, they sat down
on the ground and began to talk. The monk, catching sight of a lustrous, translucent
stone—it was in fact the rejected building block which had now shrunk itself to the
size of a fan-pendant and looked very attractive in its new shape—took it up on the
palm of his hand and addressed it with a smile:
‘Ha, I see you have magical properties! But nothing to recommend you. I shall have
to cut a few words on you so that anyone seeing you will know at once that you are
something special. After that I shall take you to a certain
brilliant
successful
poetical
cultivated
aristocratic
elegant
delectable
luxurious
opulent
locality on a little trip.’
The stone was delighted.
‘What words will you cut? Where is this place you will take me to? I beg to be
enlightened.’
‘Do not ask,’ replied the monk with a laugh. ‘You will know soon enough when the
time comes.’
And with that he slipped the stone into his sleeve and set off at a great pace with the
Taoist. But where they both went to I have no idea.

*

Countless aeons went by and a certain Taoist called Vanitas in quest of the secret of
immortality chanced to be passing below that same Greensickness Peak in the
Incredible Crags of the Great Fable Mountains when he caught sight of a large stone
standing there, on which the characters of a long in?scription were clearly
discernible.
Vanitas read the inscription through from beginning to end and learned that this was
a once lifeless stone block which had been found unworthy to repair the sky, but
which had magi?cally transformed its shape and been taken down by the Buddhist
mahāsattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso into the world of
mortals, where it had lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and
re?turning to the other shore. The inscription named the country where it had been
born, and went into considerable detail about its domestic life, youthful amours, and
even the verses, mottoes and riddles it had written. All it lacked was the
authentication of a dynasty and date. On the back of the stone was inscribed the
following quatrain:
Found unfit to repair the azure sky
Long years a foolish mortal man was I.
My life in both worlds on this stone is writ:
Pray who will copy out and publish it?

From his reading of the inscription Vanitas realized that this was a stone of some
consequence. Accordingly he addressed himself to it in the following manner:
‘Brother Stone, according to what you yourself seem to imply in these verses, this
story of yours contains matter of sufficient interest to merit publication and has been
carved here with that end in view. But as far as I can see (a) it has no discoverable
dynastic period, and (b) it contains no examples of moral grandeur among its
characters—no statesmanship, no social message of any kind. All I can find in it, in
fact, are a number of females, conspicuous, if at all, only for their passion or folly or
for some trifling talent or insignificant virtue. Even if I were to copy all this out, I
cannot see that it would make a very remarkable book.’
‘Come, your reverence,' said the stone (for Vanitas had been correct in assuming
that it could speak) ‘must you be so obtuse? All the romances ever written have an
artificial period setting—Han or Tang for the most part. In refusing to make use of
that stale old convention and telling my Story of the Stone exactly as it occurred, it
seems to me that, far from depriving it of anything, I have given it a freshness these
other books do not have.
‘ Your so-called “historical romances”, consisting, as they do, of scandalous
anecdotes about statesmen and emperors of bygone days and scabrous attacks on
the reputations of long-dead gentlewomen, contain more wickedness and immorality
than I care to mention. Still worse is the “erotic novel”, by whose filthy obscenities
our young folk are all too easily corrupted. And the “boudoir romances”, those dreary
stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their
different characters undistinguishable except by name (all those ideally beautiful
young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors)— even they seem unable to avoid
descending sooner or later into indecency.
“The trouble with this last kind of romance is that it only gets written in the first
place because the author requires a framework in which to show off his love-poems.
He goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically, beginning with the
names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character, a servant or
the like, to make mischief between them, like the chou in a comedy.
‘What makes these romances even more detestable is the stilted, bombastic
language— inanities dressed in pompous rhetoric, remote alike from nature and
common sense and teeming with the grossest absurdities.
    ‘Surely my “number of females”, whom I spent half a lifetime studying with my
own eyes and ears, are preferable to this kind of stuff? I do not claim that they are
better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time; I am only
saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more
effective antidote to boredom and melancholy. And even the inelegant verses with
which my story is interlarded could serve to entertain and amuse on those convivial
occasions when rhymes and riddles are in demand.
     ‘All that my story narrates, the meetings and partings, the joys and sorrows, the
ups and downs of fortune, are recorded exactly as they happened. I have not dared
to add the tiniest bit of touching-up, for fear of losing the true picture.
     ‘My only wish is that men in the world below may some?times pick up this tale
when they are recovering from sleep or drunkenness, or when they wish to escape
from business worries or a fit of the dumps, and in doing so find not only mental
refreshment but even perhaps, if they will heed its lesson and abandon their vain and
frivolous pursuits, some small arrest in the deterioration of their vital forces. What
does your reverence say to that?’
     For a long time Vanitas stood lost in thought, pondering this speech. He then
subjected the Story of the stone to a careful second reading. He could see that its
main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events;
and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore
copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a
publisher.
     As a consequence of all this, Vanitas, starting off in the Void (which is Truth)
came to the contemplation of Form (which is Illusion); and from Form engendered
Passion; and by communicating Passion, entered again into Form; and from Form
awoke to the Void (which is Truth). He therefore changed his name from Vanitas to
Brother Amor, or the Passionate Monk, (because he had approached Truth by way of
Passion), and changed the title of the book from The Story of the S tone to The Tale
of Brother Amor.
     Old Kong Mei-xi from the homeland of Confucius called the book A Mirror for
the Romantic. Wu Yu-feng called it A Dream of Golden Days. Cao Xueqin in his
Nostalgia Studio worked on it for ten years, in the course of which he rewrote it no
less than five times, dividing it into chapters, composing chapter headings, renaming
it The Twelve Beauties of Jinling, and adding an introductory quatrain. Red Inkstone
restored the original title when he recopied the book and added his second set of
annotations to it.
     This, then, is a true account of how The Story of the Stone came to be written.
     Pages full of idle words
     Penned with hot and bitter tears:
     All men call the author fool;
    None his secret message hears.

*

The origin of The Story of the Stone has now been made clear. The same cannot,
however, be said of the characters and events which it recorded. Gentle reader, have
patience! This is how the inscription began:
     Long, long ago the world was tilted downwards towards the south-east; and in
that lower-lying south-easterly part of the earth there is a city called Soochow; and in
Soochow the district around the Chang-men Gate is reckoned one of the two or
three wealthiest and most fashionable quarters in the world of men. Outside the
Chang-men Gate is a wide thorough-fare called Worldly Way; and somewhere off
Worldly Way is an area called Carnal Lane. There is an old temple in the Carnal Lane
area which, because of the way it is bottled up inside a narrow cul-de-sac, is referred
to locally as Bottle-gourd Temple. Next door to Bottle-gourd Temple lived a
gentleman of private means called Zhen Shi-yin and his wife Feng-shi, a kind, good
woman with a profound sense of decency and decorum. The household was not a
particularly wealthy one, but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry
as the leading family in the neighbourhood.
     Zhen Shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totality unambitious person. He
devoted his time to his garden and to the pleasures of wine and poetry. Except for a
single flaw, his existence could, indeed, have been described as an idyllic one. The
flaw was that, although already past fifty, he had no son, only a little girl, just two
years old, whose name was Ying-lian.
     Once, during the tedium of a burning summer's day, Shi-yin was sitting idly in his
study. The book had slipped from his nerveless grasp and his head had nodded down
onto the desk in a doze. While in this drowsy state he seemed to drift off to some
place he could not identify, where he became aware of a monk and a Taoist walking
along and talking as they went.
     ‘Where do you intend to take that thing you are carrying?’ the Taoist was asking.
     ‘Don't you worry about him!’ replied the monk with a laugh. ‘There is a batch of
lovesick souls awaiting incarnation in the world below whose fate is due to be
decided this very day. I intend to take advantage of this opportunity to slip our little
friend in amongst them and let him have a taste of human life along with the rest.’
     ‘Well, well, so another lot of these amorous wretches is about to enter the vale
of tears,’ said the Taoist. ‘How did all this begin? And where are the souls to be
reborn?’
‘You will laugh when I tell you,’ said the monk. 'When this stone was left unused by
the goddess, he found himself at a loose end and took to wandering about all over
the place for want of better to do, until one day his wanderings took him to the place
where the fairy Disenchantment lives.
      ‘Now Disenchantment could tell that there was something unusual about this
stone, so she kept him there in her Sunset Glow Palace and gave him the honorary
title of Divine Luminescent Stone-in-Waiting in the Court of Sunset Glow.
      ‘But most of his time he spent west of Sunset Glow ex?ploring the banks of the
Magic River. There, by the Rock of Rebirth, he found the beautiful Crimson Pearl
Flower, for which he conceived such a fancy that he took to watering her every day
with sweet dew, thereby conferring on her the gift of life.
      ‘Crimson Pearl’s substance was composed of the purest cosmic essences, so she
was already half-divine; and now, thanks to the vitalizing effect of the sweet dew, she
was able to shed her vegetable shape and assume the form of a girl.
      ‘This fairy girl wandered about outside the Realm of Separation, eating the
Secret Passion Fruit when she was hungry and drinking from the Pool of Sadness
when she was thirsty. The consciousness that she owed the stone something for his
kindness in watering her began to prey on her mind and ended by becoming an
obsession.
      ‘ “I have no sweet dew here that I can repay him with,” she would say to herself.
“The only way in which I could perhaps repay him would be with the tears shed
during the whole of a mortal lifetime if he and I were ever to be reborn as humans in
the world below.”
      ‘Because of this strange affair, Disenchantment has got together a group of
amorous young souls, of which Crimson Pearl is one, and intends to send them down
into the world to take part in the great illusion of human life. And as to?day happens
to be the day on which this stone is fated to go into the world too, I am taking him
with me to Disenchant?ment’s tribunal for the purpose of getting him registered and
sent down to earth with the rest of these romantic creatures.’
     ‘How very amusing!’ said the Taoist. ‘I have certainly never heard of a debt of
tears before. Why shouldn’t the two of us take advantage of this opportunity to go
down into the world ourselves and save a few souls? It would be a work of merit.’
     ‘That is exactly what I was thinking,’ said the monk. ‘Come with me to
Disenchantment's palace to get this absurd creature cleared. Then, when this last
batch of romantic idiots goes down, you and I can go down with them. At present
about half have already been born. They await this last batch to make up the
number.’
     ‘Very good, I will go with you then,’ said the Taoist. Shi-yin heard all this
conversation quite clearly, and curiosity impelled him to go forward and greet the
two reverend gentlemen. They returned his greeting and asked him what he wanted.
     ‘It is not often that one has the opportunity of listening to a discussion of the
operations of karma such as the one I have just been privileged to overhear,’said
Shi-yin. ‘Unfortunately I am a man of very limited understanding and have not been
able to derive the full benefit from your conversation. If you would have the very
great kindness to enlighten my be?nighted understanding with a somewhat fuller
account of what you were discussing, I can promise you the most devout attention. I
feel sure that your teaching would have a salutary effect on me and—who
knows—might save me from the pains of hell.’
The reverend gentlemen laughed. ‘These are heavenly mysteries and may not be
divulged. But if you wish to escape from the fiery pit, you have only to remember us
when the time comes, and all will be well.’
     Shi-yin saw that it would be useless to press them. ‘Heavenly mysteries must not,
of course, be revealed. But might one perhaps inquire what the “absurd creature” is
that you were talking about? Is it possible that I might be allowed to see it?’
     ‘Oh, as for that,’said the monk: ‘I think it is on the cards for you to have a look at
him,’and he took the object from his sleeve and handed it to Shi-yin.
     Shi-yin took the object from him and saw that it was a clear, beautiful jade on
one side of which were carved the words ‘Magic Jade’. There were several columns of
smaller charac?ters on the back, which Shi-yin was lust going to examine more
closely when the monk, with a cry of ‘Here we are, at the frontier of Illusion’,
snatched the stone from him and disappeared, with the Taoist, through a big stone
archway above which

THE LAND OF ILLUSION

was written in large characters. A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed
vertically on either side of the arch:

Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true;
Real becomes not-teal where the unreal’s real.

    Shi-yin was on the point of following them through the archway when suddenly
a great clap of thunder seemed to shake the earth to its very foundations, making
him cry out in alarm.
    And there he was sitting in his study, the contents of his dream already half
forgotten, with the sun still blazing on the ever-rustling plantains outside, and the
wet-nurse at the door with his little daughter Ying-lian in her arms. Her delicate little
pink-and-white face seemed dearer to him than ever at that moment, and he
stretched out his arms to take her and hugged her to him.
     After playing with her for a while at his desk, he carried her out to the front of
the house to watch the bustle in the street. He was about to go in again when he saw
a monk and a Taoist approaching, the monk scabby-headed and barefoot, the Taoist
tousle-haired and limping. They were behaving like madmen, shouting with laughter
and gesticulating wildly as they walked along.
     When this strange pair reached Shi-yin’s door and saw him standing there
holding Ying-lian, the monk burst into loud sobs. ‘Patron,’ he said, addressing Shi-yin,
'what are you doing, holding in your arms that ill-fated creature who is destined to
involve both her parents in her own misfortune?'
Shi-yin realized that he was listening to the words of a madman and took no notice.
But the monk persisted:
‘Give her to me! Give her to me!’
Shi-yin was beginning to lose patience and clasping his little girl tightly to him, turned
on his heel and was about to re-enter the house when the monk pointed his finger at
him, roared with laughter, and then proceeded to intone the following verses:


‘Fond man, your pampered child to cherish so—
That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow!
Beware the high feast of the fifteenth day,
When all in smoke and fire shall pass away!’

Shi-yin heard all this quite plainly and was a little worried by it. He was thinking or
asking the monk what lay behind these puzzling words when he heard the Taoist say,
‘We don’t need to stay tether. Why don’t we part company here and each go about
his own business? Three kalpas from now I shall wait far you on Bei-mang Hill. Having
joined forces again there, we can go together to the Land of Illusion to sign off.’
‘Excellent!’said the other. And the two if them went off and soon were both lost to
sight.
'There must have been something behind all this, ‘thought Shi-yin to himself.’1 really
ought to have asked him what he meant, but now it is too late.'
He was still standing outside his door brooding when Jia Yu-cun, the poor student
who lodged at the Bottle-gourd Temple next door, came up to him. Yu-cun was a
native of Hu-zhou and came from a family of scholars and bureaucrats which had,
however, fallen on bad times when Yu-cun was born. The family fortunes on both his
father’s and mother’s side had all been spent, and the members of the family had
themselves gradually died off until only Yu-cun was left There were no prospects for
him in his home town, so he had set off for the capital, in search of fame and fortune.
Unfor?tunately he had got no further than Soochow when his funds ran out, and he
had now been living there in poverty for a year, lodging in this temple and keeping
himself alive by working as a copyist. For this reason Shi-yin saw a great deal of his
company.
     As soon as he caught sight of Shi-yin, Yu-cun clasped his hands in greeting and
smiled ingratiatingly. ‘I could see you standing there gazing, sir. Has anything been
happening in the street?’
     ‘No, no,’ said Shi-yin. ‘It just happened that my little girl was crying, so I brought
her out here to amuse her. Your coming is most opportune, dear boy. I was beginning
to feel most dreadfully bored. Won’t you come into my little den, and we can help
each other to while away this tedious hot day?’
     So saying, he called for a servant to take the child indoors, while he himself took
Yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study, where his boy served them both with
tea. But they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words before one of the servants
rushed in to say that ‘Mr Yan had come to pay a call.’ Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and
excused himself: ‘I seem to have brought you here under false pretences. I do hope
you will forgive me. If you don’t mind sitting on your own here for a moment, I shall
be with you directly.’
     Yu-cun rose to his feet too. ‘Please do not distress yourself on my account, sir. I
am a regular visitor here and can easily wait a bit.’ But by the time he had finished
saying this, Shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guest-room.
     Left to himself, Yu-cun was flicking through some of Shi?-yin’s books of poetry in
order to pass the time, when he heard a woman's cough outside the window.
Immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was. The cough appeared to
have come from a maid who was picking flowers in the garden. She was an unusually
good-looking girl with a rather refined face: not a great beauty, by any means, but
with something striking about her. Yu-cun gazed at her spellbound.
    Having now finished picking her flowers, this anonymous member of the Zhen
household was about to go in again when, on some sudden impulse, she raised her
head and caught sight of a man standing in the window. His hat was frayed and his
clothing threadbare; yet, though obviously poor, he had a fine, manly physique and
handsome, well-proportioned features.
    The maid hastened to remove herself from this male presence; but as she went
she thought to herself, ‘What a fine-looking man! But so shabby! The family hasn’t
got any friends or relations as poor as that. It must be that Jia Yu-cun the master is
always on about. No wonder he says that he won’t stay poor long. I remember
hearing him say that he’s often wanted to help him but hasn’t yet found an
opportunity.’ And thinking these thoughts she could not forbear to turn back for
another peep or two.
     Yu-cun saw her turn back and, at once assuming that she had taken a fancy to
him, was beside himself with delight. What a perceptive young woman she must be,
he thought, to have seen the genius underneath the rags! A real friend in trouble!
     After a while the boy came in again and Yu-cun elicited from him that the visitor
in the front room was now staying to dinner. It was obviously out of the question to
wait much longer, so he slipped down the passage-way at the side of the house and
let himself out by the back gate. Nor did Shi-yin invite him round again when, having
at last seen off his visitor, he learned that Yu-cun had already left.
     But then the Mid Autumn festival arrived and, after the family convivialities were
over, Shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to
invite Yu-cun, walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight.
     Ever since the day the Zhens’ maid had, by looking back twice over her shoulder,
convinced him that she was a friend, Yu-cun had had the girl very much on his mind,
and now that it was festival time, the full moon of Mid Autumn lent an inspiration to
his romantic impulses which finally resulted in the following octet:


‘Ere on ambition's path my feet are set,
Sorrow comes often this poor heart to fret.
Yet, as my brow contracted with new care,
Was there not one who, parting, turned to stare?
Dare I, that grasp at windows in the wind,
Hope, underneath the moon, a friend to find?
Bright orb, if with my plight you sympathize,
Shine first upon the chamber where she lies.’

Having delivered himself of this masterpiece, Yu-cun’s thoughts began to run on his
unrealized ambitions and, after much head-scratching and many heavenward glances
ac?companied by heavy sighs, he produced the following couplet, reciting it in a loud,
ringing voice which caught the ear of Shi-yin, who chanced at that moment to be
arriving:


‘The jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy.
The jade pin in the drawer hides, waiting its time to fly.’

Shi-yin smiled. ‘You are a man of no mean ambition, Yu-cun.’
‘Oh no!’Yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly. ‘You are too flattering. I was merely
reciting at random from the lines of some old poet. But what brings you here, sir?’
‘Tonight is Mid Autumn night,’said Shi-yin. ‘People call it the Festival of Reunion. It
occurred to me that you might be feeling rather lonely here in your monkery, so I
have arranged for the two of us to take a little wine together in my study. I hope you
will not refuse to join me.’
Yu-cun made no polite pretence of declining. ‘Your kind?ness is more than I deserve,’
he said. ‘I accept gratefully.’ And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door.
Soon they had finished their tea. Wine and various choice dishes were brought in
and placed on the table, already laid out with cups, plates, and so forth, and the two
men took their places and began to drink. At first they were rather slow and
ceremonious; but gradually, as the conversation grew more animated, their potations
too became more reckless and un?inhibited. The sounds of music and singing which
could now be heard from every house in the neighbourhood and the full moon which
shone with cold brilliance overhead seemed to increase their elation, so that the
cups were emptied almost as soon as they touched their lips, and Yu-cun, who was
already a sheet or so in the wind, was seized with an irrepressible excitement to
which he presently gave expression in the form of a quatrain, ostensibly on the
subject of the moon, but really about the ambition he had hitherto been at some
pains to conceal:


‘In thrice five nights her perfect O is made,
Whose cold light bathes each marble balustrade.
As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways,
On earth ten thousand heads look up and gaze.’

     ‘Bravo!’said Shi-yin loudly. 'I have always insisted that you were a young fellow
who would go up in the world, and now, in these verses you have just recited, I see
an augury of your ascent. In no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds! This
calls for a drink!' And, saying this, he poured Yu-cun a large cup of wine.
     Yu-cun drained the cup, then, surprisingly, sighed:
     ‘Don't imagine the drink is making me boastful, but I really do believe that if it
were just a question of having the sort of qualifications now in demand, I should
stand as good a chance as any of getting myself on to the list of candidates. The
trouble is that I simply have no means of laying my hands on the money that would
be needed for lodgings and travel expenses. The journey to the capital is a long one,
and the sort of money I can earn from my copying is not enough—’
     ‘Why ever didn't you say this before?’ said Shi-yin inter?rupting him. ‘I have long
wanted to do something about this, but on all the occasions I have met you
previously, the con?versation has never got round to this subject, and I haven't liked
to broach it for fear of offending you. Well, now we know where we are. I am not a
very clever man, but at least I know the right thing to do when I see it. Luckily, the
next Triennial is only a few months ahead. You must go to the capital without delay. A
spring examination triumph will make you feel that all your studying has been worth
while. I shall take care of all your expenses. It is the least return I can make for your
friendship.’ And there and then he instructed his boy to go with all speed and make
up a parcel of fifty tales of the best refined silver and two suits of winter clothes.
     ‘The almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travel?ling,’ he went on,
addressing Yu-cun again. ‘You can set about hiring a boat for the journey straight
away. How de?lightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have
distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates!’
     Yu-cun accepted the silver and the clothes with only the most perfunctory word
of thanks and without, apparently, giving them a further moment’s thought, for he
continued to drink and laugh and talk as if nothing had happened. It was well after
midnight before they broke up.
After seeing Yu-cun off, Shi-yin went to bed and slept without a break until the sun
was high in the sky next morn?ing. When he awoke, his mind was still running on the
con?versation of the previous night. He thought he would write a couple of
introductory letters for Yu-cun to take with him to the capital, and arrange for him to
call on the family of an official he was acquainted with who might be able to put him
up; but when he sent a servant to invite him over, the servant brought back word
from the temple as follows:
'The monk says that Mr Jia set out for the capital at five o'clock this morning, sir. He
says he left a message to pass on to you. He said to tell you, “A scholar should not
concern himself with almanacs, but should act as the situation de?mands,”and he
said there wasn't time to say good-bye.'
So Shi-yin was obliged to let the matter drop.




*

It is a true saying that ‘time in idleness is quickly spent’. In no time at all it was
Fifteenth Night, and Shi-yin sent little Ying-lian out, in the charge of one of the
servants called Calamity, to see the mummers and the coloured lanterns. It was near
midnight when Calamity, feeling an urgent need to relieve his bladder, put Ying-lian
down on someone’s doorstep while he went about his business, only to find, on his
return, that the child was nowhere to be seen. Frantically he searched for her
throughout the rest of the night; but when day dawned and he had still not found her,
he took to his heels, not daring to face his master and mistress, and made off for
another part of the country.
Shi-yin and his wife knew that something must be wrong when their little girl failed
to return home all night. Then a search was made; but all those sent out were
obliged in the end to report that no trace of her could be found.
The shock of so sudden a loss to a middle-aged couple who had only ever had the
one daughter can be imagined. In tears every day and most of the night, they almost
lost the will to go on living, and after about a month like this first Shi-yin and then his
wife fell ill, so that doctors and diviners were in daily attendance on them.
     Then, on the fifteenth of the third month, while frying cakes for an offering, the
monk of Bottle-gourd Temple carelessly allowed the oil to catch alight, which set fire
to the paper window. And, since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and
bamboo fences—though also, doubtless, because they were doomed to destruction
anyway-the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away
like a regular Fiery Mountain; and though the firemen came to put it out, by the time
they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling, and roared away
all night long until it had burnt itself out, rendering heaven knows how many families
homeless in the process.
Poor Zhens! Though they and their handful of domestics escaped unhurt, their house,
which was only next door to the temple, was soon reduced to a heap of rubble, while
Shi-yin stood by helpless, groaning and stamping in despair.
After some discussion with his wife, Shi-yin decided that they should move to their
farm in the country; but a series of crop failures due to flooding and drought had led
to wide?spread brigandage in those parts, and government troops were out
everywhere hunting down the mutinous peasants and making arrests. In such
conditions it was impossible to settle on the farm, so Shi-yin sold the land and, taking
only two of the maids with them, went with his wife to seek refuge with his
father-in-law, Feng Su.
     This Feng Su was a Ru-zhou man who, though only a farmer by calling, had a very
comfortable sufficiency. He was somewhat displeased to see his son-in-law arriving
like a refugee on his doorstep; but fortunately Shi- yin had on him the money he had
realized from the sale of the farm, and this he now entrusted to his father-in-law to
buy for him, as and when he could, a house and land on which he could depend for
his future livelihood. Feng Su embezzled about half of this sum and used the other
half to provide him with a ruinous cottage and some fields of poor, thin soil.
A scholar, with no experience of business or agricultural matters, Shi-yin now found
himself poorer after a year or two of struggle than when he had started. Feng Su
would treat him to a few pearls of rustic wisdom whenever they met, but behind his
back would grumble to all and sundry about 'incompetents' and 'people who liked
their food but were too lazy to work for it', which caused Shi-yin great bitterness
when it came to his ears. The anxieties and injustices which now beset him, coming
on top of the shocks he had suffered a year or two previously, left a man of his years
with little resistance to the joint onslaught of poverty and ill-health, and gradually he
began to betray the unmistakable symptoms of a decline.
One day, wishing to take his mind off his troubles for a bit, he had dragged himself,
stick in hand, to the main road, when it chanced that he suddenly caught sight of a
Taoist with a limp—a crazy, erratic figure in hempen sandals and tattered clothes,
who chanted the following words to himself as he advanced towards him:


‘Men all know that salvation should be won,
But with ambition won't have done, have done.
Where are the famous ones of days gone by?
In grassy graves they lie now, every one.

Men all know that salvation should be won,
But with their riches won't have done, have done.
Each day they grumble they've not made enough.
When they've enough, it's goodnight everyone!

Men all know that salvation should be won,
But with their loving wives they won't have done.
The darlings every day protest their love:
But once you're dead, they're off with another one.

                       Men all know that salvation should be won,
                       But with their children won't have done, have done.
                       Yet though of patents fond there is no lack,
Of grateful children saw I ne’er a one.’

Shi-yin approached the Taoist and questioned him. ‘What is all this you are saying?
All I can make out is a lot of “won” and “done”.’
‘If you can make out “won” and “done”,’ replied the Taoist with a smile, ‘you may
be said to have understood; for in all the affairs of this world what is won is done,
and what is done is won; for whoever has not yet done has not yet won, and in order
to have won, one must first have done. I shall call my song the “Won-Done Song”.’
Shi-yin had always been quick-witted, and on hearing these words a flash of
understanding had illuminated his mind. He therefore smiled back at the Taoist: ‘Wait
a minute! How would you like me to provide your “Won-Done Song” with a
commentary?’
        ‘Please do!’ said the Taoist; and Shi-yin proceeded as follows:
        ‘Mean hovels and abandoned halls
        Where courtiers once paid daily calls:
        Bleak haunts where weeds and willows scarcely thrive
        Were once with mirth and revelry alive.
        Whilst cobwebs shroud the mansion’s gilded beams,
        The cottage casement with choice muslin gleams.
        Would you of perfumed elegance recite?
        Even as you speak, the raven locks turn white.
        Who yesterday her lord’s bones laid in clay,
        On silken bridal-bed shall lie today.
        Coffers with gold and silver filled:
        Now, in a trice, a tramp by all reviled.
        One at some other’s short life gives a sigh,
        Not knowing that he, too, goes home—to die!
        The sheltered and well-educated lad,
        In spite of all your care, may turn out bad;

        And the delicate, fastidious maid
        End in a foul stews, plying a shameful trade.
        The judge whose hat is too small for his head
        Wears, in the end, a convict's cangue instead.
        Who shivering once in rags bemoaned his fate,
        Today finds fault with scarlet robes of state.
        In such commotion does the world’s theatre rage:
        As each one leaves, another takes the stage.
        In vain we roam:
        Each in the end must call a strange land home.
        Each of us with that poor girl may compare
        Who sews a wedding-gown for another bride to wear.'


‘A very accurate commentary!' cried the mad, lame Taoist, clapping his hands
delightedly.
But Shi-yin merely snatched the satchel that hung from the other’s shoulder and
slung it from his own, and with a shout of ‘Let's go!’ and without even waiting to call
back home, he strode off into the wide world in the company of the madman.
This event made a great uproar in the little town, and news of it was relayed from
gossip to gossip until it reached the ears of Mrs Zhen, who cried herself into fits when
she heard it. After consulting her father, she sent men out to inquire everywhere
after her husband; but no news of him was to be had.
It was now imperative that she should move in with her parents and look to them for
support. Fortunately she still had the two maids who had stayed on with her from
the Soochow days, and by sewing and embroidering morning, noon and night, she
and her women were able to make some contribution to her father's income. The
latter still found daily occasion to complain, but there was very little he could do
about it.
One day the elder of the two maids was purchasing some silks at the door when she
heard the criers clearing the street and all the people began to tell each other that
the new man?darin had arrived. She hid in the doorway and watched the guards and
runners marching past two by two. But when the mandarin in his black hat and
scarlet robe of office was borne past in his great chair, she stared for some time as
though puzzled. ‘Where have I seen that mandarin before?’she wondered. ‘His face
looks extraordinarily familiar.’ But presently she went into the house again and gave
the matter no further thought.
That night, just as they were getting ready for bed, there was suddenly a great
commotion at the door and a confused hubbub of voices shouting that someone was
wanted at the yamen for questioning, which so terrified Feng Su that he was
momentarily struck dumb and could only stare.
If you wish to know what further calamity this portended, you will have to read the
following chapter.
CHAPTER 2

A daughter of the Jias ends her days
in Yangchow city
And Leng Zi-xing discourses on the Jias of
Rong-guo House



Hearing the clamour of yamen runners outside, Feng Su hurried to the door, his face
wreathed in smiles, to ask what they wanted. ‘Tell Mr Zhen to step outside,’ they
were shouting. ‘Hurry!’
    Feng Su’s smile became even more ingratiating. ‘My name is Feng, not Zhen. My
son-in-law’s name is Zhen, but he left home to become a Taoist more than a year ago.
Could he be the one you want?’
‘“Feng” or “Zhen”, it’s all the same to us,’ said the runners; ‘but if you’re his
father-in-law you’d better come along with us to see the magistrate.’ And they
hustled him off, leaving the entire household in a state of panic, quite at a loss to
know what the trouble could be.
     It was ten o’clock before Feng Su returned, and everyone pressed him to give a
full account of what had transpired.
     ‘It seems that the new mandarin is a Hu-zhou man called Jia. He used to be an
acquaintance of Shi-yin’s in the old days. He guessed that Shi-yin must have moved to
these parts when he saw our Lucky in the doorway buying silks. That’s why he sent
the runners here. I explained what had happened to Shi-yin, and he seemed very
upset. Then he asked me about Ying-lian, and I said she was lost while out watching
the lanterns. “Never mind,” he said, “wait till I send some people out to look for her.
We shall have her back in no time.” Then we chatted a bit longer, and lust as I was
going, he gave me two taels of silver.’
     Mrs Zhen could not help being affected by this account. But the rest of that night
we pass over in silence.
     Early next day a messenger arrived from Yu-cun bearing two packets of silver and
four bolts of silk brocade for Mrs Zhen as a token of the sender’s gratitude. There was
also a confidential letter for Feng Su commissioning him to ask Mrs Zhen for Lucky’s
hand as Yu-cun’s second wife. En?raptured at the prospect of doing a good turn for a
mandarin, Feng Su hastened to urge upon his daughter the importance of complying
with this request, and that very night Lucky was bundled into a small covered chair
and carried off to the yamen. Yu-cun’s delight goes without saying. Another hundred
taels of silver were despatched to Feng Su, together with a number of good things for
Mrs Zhen, to cheer and sustain her until such time as her daughter’s whereabouts
could be discovered.
Lucky was, of course, the maid who had once turned back to look at Yu-cun when
they were living at the house in Soochow. She could scarcely have foreseen at the
time what singular good fortune that one glance would procure for her. But she was
destined to be doubly fortunate. She had not been with Yu-cun more than a year
when she gave birth to a son; and a mere six months later Yu-cun’s first wife died,
whereupon Lucky was promoted to fill her place and became Her Lady ship. As the
proverb says,

         Sometimes by chance
         A look or a glance
             May one’s fortune advance.

*

When Yu-cun received the gift of money from Zhen Shi-yin he had left for the capital
on the day after the festival. He had done well in the Triennial examination, passing
out as a Palace Graduate, and had been selected for external service. And now he
had been promoted to the magistracy of this district.
But although his intelligence and ability were outstanding, these qualities were
unfortunately offset by a certain cupidity and harshness and a tendency to use his
intelligence in order to outwit his superiors; all of which caused his fellow-officials to
cast envious glances in his direction, with the result that in less than a year an
unfavourable report was sent in by a senior official stating that his ‘seeming ability
was no more than a mask for cunning and duplicity’ and citing one or two instances
in which he had aided and abetted the peculations of his underlings or allied himself
with powerful local interests in order to frustrate the course of justice.
The imperial eye, lighting on this report, kindled with wrath. Yu-cun’s instant
dismissal was commanded. The officials at the Prefecture, when notice that he was
to be cashiered arrived from the Ministry, rejoiced to a man. But Yu-cun, in spite of
all the shame and chagrin that he felt, allowed no glimmer of resentment to appear
on his face. Indeed, he joked and smiled as before, and when the business of handing
over was completed, he took his wife and family and the loot he had accumulated
during his years of office and having settled them all safely in his native Hu-zhou, set
off, free as the air, on an extended tour of some of the more celebrated places of
scenic interest in our mighty empire.
One day Yu-cun chanced to be staying in the Yangchow area when he heard that the
Salt Commissioner for that year was a certain Lin Ru-hai. This Lin Ru-hai had passed
out Florilege, or third in the whole list of successful candidates, in a previous
Triennial, and had lately been promoted to the Censorate. He was a Soochow man
and had not long taken up his duties in Yangchow following his nomination by the
emperor as Visiting Inspector in that area.
Lin Ru-hai came of an aristocratic family and was himself fifth in line since his
ancestor’s ennoblement. The original patent had been inheritable only up to the
third generation, and it was only through the magnanimity of the reigning sovereign
that an exceptional act of grace had extended it for a further generation in the case
of Lin Ru-hai’s father. Lin Ru-hai himself had therefore been obliged to make his way
up through the examination system. It was fortunate for him that, though the family
had up to his time enjoyed hereditary emoluments, it had nevertheless enjoined a
high standard of education on all of its members.
Lin Ru-hai was less fortunate, however, in belonging to a family whose numbers were
dwindling. He could still point to several related households, but they were all on the
distaff side. There was not a single relation in the direct line who bore his name.
Already he was fifty, and his only son had died the year before at the age of three.
And although he kept several concubines, he seemed fated to have no son, and had
all but resigned himself to this melancholy fact.
His chief wife, who had been a Miss Jia, had given him a daughter called Dai-yu. Both
parents doted on her, and because she showed exceptional intelligence, conceived
the idea of giving her a rudimentary education as a substitute for bringing up a son,
hoping in this way somewhat to alleviate the sense of desolation left by the death of
their only heir.
Now Jia Yu-cun had had the misfortune to catch a severe chill while staying in his
lodgings at Yangchow, and after his recovery, found himself somewhat short of cash.
He was therefore already looking around for some more permanent haven where he
could rest and recuperate, when he chanced to run into two old friends who were
acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner and who, knowing that the latter was
looking for a suitable tutor for his daughter, took Yu-cun along to the yamen and
introduced him, with the result that he was given the job.
Since Yu-cun’s pupil was both very young and rather delicate, there were no regular
hours of instruction; and as she had only a couple of little maids studying with her for
company who stayed away when she did, Yu-cun’s employ?ment was far from
arduous and left ample time for convales?cence.
A year or more passed uneventfully and then, quite un?expectedly, Lin Ru-hai’s wife
took ill and died. Yu-cun’s little pupil helped with the nursing throughout her
mother’s last illness and mourned for her bitterly after her death. The extra strain
this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a
recurrent sickness, and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons.
Bored by his enforced idleness, Yu-cun took to going for walks as soon as lunch was
over whenever the weather was warm and sunny.
One day a desire to savour country sights and sounds led him outside the city walls,
and as he walked along with no fixed destination in mind, he presently found himself
in a place ringed with hills and full of murmuring brooks and tall stands of bamboo
where a temple stood half-hidden among the trees. The walled approach to the
gateway had fallen in and parts of the surrounding wall were in ruins. A board above
the gate announced the temple’s name:

THE TEMPLE OF PERFECT KNOWLEDGE

while two cracked and worn uprights at the sides of the gate were inscribed with the
following couplet:
(on the right-hand side)

As long as there is a sufficiency behind you, you press greedily forward.

(on the left-hand side)

It is only when there is no road in front of you that you think of turning back.


‘The wording is commonplace to a degree,’ Yu-cun reflected, ‘yet the sentiment is
quite profound. In all the famous temples and monasteries I have visited, I cannot
recollect having ever seen anything quite like it. I shouldn’t be surprised to find that
some story of spectacular downfall and dramatic conversion lay behind this
inscription. It might be worth going in and inquiring.’
But when he went inside and looked around, he saw only an ancient, wizened monk
cooking some gruel who paid no attention whatsoever to his greetings and who
proved, when Yu-cun went up to him and asked him a few questions, to be both deaf
and partially blind. His toothless replies were all but unintelligible, and in any case
bore no relation to the questions.
Yu-cun walked out again in disgust. He now thought that in order to give the full rural
flavour to his outing he would treat himself to a few cups of wine in a little country
inn and accordingly directed his steps towards the near-by village. He had scarcely
set foot inside the door of the village inn when one of the men drinking at separate
tables inside rose up and advanced to meet him with a broad smile.
‘Fancy meeting you!’
It was an antique dealer called Leng Zi-xing whom Yu-cun had got to know some
years previously when he was staying in the capital. Yu-cun had a great admiration
for Zi-xing as a practical man of business, whilst Zi-xing for his part was tickled to
claim acquaintanceship with a man of Yu-cun’s great learning and culture. On the
basis of this mutual admiration the two of them had got on wonderfully well, and
Yu-cun now returned the other’s greeting with a pleased smile.
‘My dear fellow! How long have you been here? I really had no idea you were in
these parts. It was quite an accident that I came here today at all. What an
extraordinary coincidence!’
‘I went home at the end of last year to spend New Year with the family,’ said Zi-xing.
‘On my way back to the capital I thought I would stop off and have a few words with
a friend of mine who lives hereabouts, and he very kindly invited me to spend a few
days with him. I hadn’t got any urgent business waiting for me, so I thought I might as
well stay on a bit and leave at the middle of the month. I came out here on my own
because my friend has an engagement today. I certainly didn’t expect to run into you
here.’
Zi-xing conducted Yu-cun to his table as he spoke and ordered more wine and some
fresh dishes to be brought. The two men then proceeded, between leisurely sips of
wine, to relate what each had been doing in the years that had elapsed since their
last meeting.
Presently Yu-cun asked Zi-xing if anything of interest had happened recently in the
capital.
‘I can’t think of anything particularly deserving of mention,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Except,
perhaps, for a very small but very unusual event that took place in your own clan
there.’
‘What makes you say that?’ said Yu-cun, ‘I have no family connections in the
capital.’
‘Well, it’s the same name,’ said Zi-xing. ‘They must be the same clan.’
Yu-cun asked him what family he could be referring to.
‘I fancy you wouldn’t disown the Jias of the Rong-guo mansion as unworthy of you.’
‘Oh, you mean them,’ said Yu-cun. ‘There are so many members of my clan, it’s
hard to keep up with them all. Since the time of Jia Fu of the Eastern Han dynasty
there have been branches of the Jia clan in every province of the empire. The
Rong-guo branch is, as a matter of fact, on the same clan register as my own; but
since they are exalted so far above us socially, we don’t normally claim the
connection, and nowa?days we are completely out of touch with them.’
Zi-xing sighed. ‘You shouldn’t speak about them in that way, you know. Nowadays
both the Rong and Ning mansions are in a greatly reduced state compared with what
they used to be.’
‘When I was last that way the Rong and Ning mansions both seemed to be fairly
humming with life. Surely nothing could have happened to reduce their prosperity in
so short a time?’
‘Ah, you may well ask. But it’s a long story.’
‘Last time I was in Jinling,’ went on Yu-cun, ‘I passed by their two houses one day on
my way to Shi-tou-cheng to visit the ruins. The Ning-guo mansion along the eastern
half of the road and the Rong-guo mansion along the western half must between
them have occupied the greater part of the north side frontage of that street. It’s
true that there wasn’t much activity outside the main entrances, but looking up over
the outer walls I had a glimpse of the most magnificent and imposing halls and
pavilions, and even the rocks and trees of the gardens beyond seemed to have a
sleekness and luxuriance that were certainly not suggestive of a family whose
fortunes were in a state of decline.’
‘Well! For a Palace Graduate Second Class, you ought to know better than that!
Haven’t you ever heard the old saying, “The beast with a hundred legs is a long time
dying”? Although I say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past, of
course I don’t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their
circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average
government official. At the moment the numbers of their establishment and the
activities they engage in are, if anything, on the increase. Both masters and servants
all lead lives of luxury and magnificence. And they still have plenty of plans and
projects under way. But they can’t bring themselves to economize or make any
adjustment in their ac?customed style of living. Consequently, though outwardly they
still manage to keep up appearances, inwardly they are beginning to feel the pinch.
But that’s a small matter. There’s something much more seriously wrong with them
than that. They are not able to turn out good sons, those stately houses, for all their
pomp and show. The males in the family get more degenerate from one generation
to the next.’
‘Surely,’ said Yu-cun with surprise, ‘it is inconceivable that such highly cultured
households should not give their children the best education possible? I say nothing
of other families, but the Jias of the Ning and Rong households used to be famous for
the way in which they brought up their sons. How could they come to be as you
describe?’
‘I assure you, it is precisely those families I am speaking of. Let me tell you
something of their history. The Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo were two
brothers by the same mother. Ning-guo was the elder of the two. When he died, his
eldest son, Jia Dai-hua, inherited his post. Dai?hua had two sons. The elder, Jia Fu,
died at the age of eight or nine, leaving only the second son, Jia Jing, to inherit.
Nowadays Jia Jing’s only interest in life is Taoism. He spends all his time over retorts
and crucibles concocting elixirs, and refuses to be bothered with anything else.
‘Fortunately he had already provided himself with a son, Jia Zhen, long before he
took up this hobby. So, having set his mind on turning himself into an immortal, he
has given up his post in favour of this son. And what’s more he refuses outright to
live at home and spends his time fooling around with a pack of Taoists somewhere
outside the city walls.
‘This Jia Zhen has got a son of his own, a lad called Jia Rong, just turned sixteen.
With old Jia Jing out of the way and refusing to exercise any authority, Jia Zhen has
thrown his res[omsiblities to thw winds and given himself up to a life of pleasure. He
has turned that Ning-guo mansion upside down, but there is no one around who
dares gainsay him.
‘Now I come to the Rong household—it was there that this strange event occurred
that I was telling you about. When the old Duke of Rong-guo died, his eldest son, Jia
Dai-shan, inherited his emoluments. He married a girl from a very old Nanking family,
the daughter of Marquis Shi, who bore him two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng.
‘Dai-shan has been dead this many a year, but the old lady is still alive. The elder
son, Jia She, inherited; but he’s only a very middling sort of person and doesn’t play
much part in running the family. The second son, though, Jia Zheng, has been mad
keen on study ever since he was a lad. He is a very upright sort of person, straight as
a die. He was his grand?father’s favourite. He would have sat for the examinations,
but when the emperor saw Dai-shan’s testamentary memorial that he wrote on his
death bed, he was so moved, thinking what a faithful servant the old man had been,
that he not only ordered the elder son to inherit his father’s position, but also gave
instructions that any other sons of his were to be pre?sented to him at once, and on
seeing Jia Zheng he gave him the post of Supernumerary Executive Officer, brevet
rank, with instructions to continue his studies while on the Minis?try’s payroll. From
there he Jias now risen to the post of Under Secretary.
‘Sir Zheng’s lady was formerly a Miss Wang. Her first child was a boy called Jia Zhu.
He was already a Licensed Scholar at the age of fourteen. Then he married and had a
son. But he died of an illness before he was twenty. The second child she bore him
was a little girl, rather remarkable because she was born on New Year’s day. Then
after an interval of twelve years or more she suddenly had another son. He was even
more remarkable, because at the moment of his birth he had a piece of beautiful,
clear, coloured jade in his mouth with a lot of writing on it. They gave him the name
“Bao-yu” as a consequence. Now tell me if you don’t think that is an extraordinary
thing.’
‘It certainly is,’ Yu-cun agreed. ‘I should not be at all surprised to find that there was
something very unusual in the heredity of that child.’
‘Humph,’ said Zi-xing. ‘A great many people have said that. That is the reason why
his old grandmother thinks him such a treasure. But when they celebrated the First
Twelve month and Sir Zheng tested his disposition by putting a lot of objects in front
of him and seeing which he would take hold of, he stretched out his little hand and
started playing with some women’s things –combs, bracelets, pots of rouge and
powder and the like—completely ignoring all the other ob?jects. Sir Zheng was very
displeased. He said he would grow up to be a rake, and ever since then he hasn’t felt
much affection for the child. But to the old lady he’s the very apple of her eye.
‘But there’s more that’s unusual about him than that. He’s now rising ten and
unusually mischievous, yet his mind is as sharp as a needle. You wouldn’t find one in
a hundred to match him. Some of the childish things he says are most extraordinary.
He’ll say, “Girls are made of water and boys are made of mud. When I am with girls I
feel fresh and clean’ but when I am with boys I feel stupid and nasty.” Now isn’t that
priceless! He’ll be a lady-killer when he grows up, no question of that.’
Yu-cun’s face assumed an expression of unwonted severity. ‘Not so. By no means. It is
a pity that none of you seem to understand this child’s heredity. Most likely even my
esteemed kinsman Sir Jia Zheng is mistaken in treating the boy as a future libertine.
This is something that no one but a widely read person, and one moreover
well-versed in moral philosophy and in the subtle arcana of metaphysical science
could possibly understand.’
Observing the weighty tone in which these words were uttered, Zi-xing hurriedly
asked to be instructed, and Yu-cun proceeded as follows:
‘The generative processes operating in the universe provide the great majority of
mankind with natures in which good and evil are commingled in more or less equal
proportions. In?stances of exceptional goodness and exceptional badness are
produced by the operation of beneficent or noxious ethereal influences, of which the
former are symptomatized by the equilibrium of society and the latter by its
disequilib?rium.

—all instances of exceptional badness—were born under the influence of harmful
forces, and all sought to disrupt the societies in which they lived.
‘Now, the good cosmic fluid with which the natures of the exceptionally good are
compounded is a pure, quintessential humour; whilst the evil fluid which infuses the
natures of the exceptionally bad is a cruel, perverse humour.
‘Therefore, our age being one in which beneficent ethereal influences are in the
ascendant, in which the reigning dynasty’ is well-established and society both
peaceful and prosperous, innumerable instances are to be found, from the palace
down to the humblest cottage, of individuals endowed with the pure, quintessential
humour.
‘Moreover, an unused surplus of this pure, quintessential humour, unable to find
corporeal lodgment, circulates freely abroad until it manifests itself in the form of
sweet dews and balmy winds, asperged and effused for the enrichment and
refreshment of all terrestial life.
‘Consequently, the cruel and perverse humours, unable to circulate freely in the air
and sunlight, subside, by a process of incrassation and coagulation, into the bottoms
of ditches and ravines.
Now, should these incrassate humours chance to be stirred or provoked by wind or
weather into a somewhat more volatile and active condition, it sometimes happens
that a stray wisp or errant flocculus may escape from the fissure or concavity in
which they are contained; and if some of the pure, quintessential humour should
chance to be passing overhead at that same moment, the two will become locked in
irreconcilable conflict, the good refusing to yield to the evil, the evil persisting in its
hatred of the good. And just as wind, water, thunder and lightning meeting together
over the earth can neither dissipate nor yield one to another but produce an
explosive shock resulting in the downward emission of rain, so does this clash of
humours result in the forcible downward expulsion of the evil humour, which, being
thus forced down-wards, will find its way into some human creature.
‘Such human recipients, whether they be male or female, since they are already
amply endowed with the benign humour before the evil humour is injected, are
incapable of becoming either greatly good or greatly bad; but place them in the
company of ten thousand others and you will find that they are superior to all the
rest in sharpness and intelligence and inferior to all the rest in perversity,
wrongheadedness and eccentricity. Born into a rich or noble household they are
likely to become great lovers or the occasion of great love in others; in a poor but
well-educated household they will become literary rebels or eccentric aesthetes;
even if they are born in the lowest stratum of society they are likely to become great
actors or famous hetaerae. Under no circumstances will you find them in servile or
menial positions, content to be at the beck and call of mediocrities.

All of these, though their circumstances differed, were essentially the same.’
‘You mean’ Zi-xing interposed,
‘Zhang victorious is a hero,
Zhang beaten is a lousy knave?’


‘Precisely so,’ said Yu-cun. ‘I should have told you that during the two years after I
was cashiered I travelled exten?sively in every province of the empire and saw quite
a few remarkable children in the course of my travels; so that just now when you
mentioned this Bao-yu I felt pretty certain what type of boy he must be. But one
doesn’t need to go very far afield for another example. There is one in the Zhen
family in Nanking—I am referring to the family of the Zhen who is Imperial Deputy
Director-General of the Nanking Secretariat. Perhaps you know who I mean?’
‘Who doesn’t?’ said Zi-xing. ‘There is an old family con?nection between the Zhen
family and the Jias of whom we have just been speaking, and they are still on very
close terms with each other. I’ve done business with them myself for longer than I’d
care to mention.’
‘Last year when I was in Nanking,’ said Yu-cun, smiling at the recollection, ‘I was
recommended for the post of tutor in their household. I could tell at a glance, as
soon as I got inside the place, that for all the ducal splendour this was a family
“though rich yet given to courtesy”, in the words of the Sage, and that it was a rare
piece of luck to have got a place in it. But when I came to teach my pupil, though he
was only at the first year primary stage, he gave me more trouble than an
examination candidate.
‘He was indeed a comedy. He once said, “I must have two girls to do my lessons
with me if I am to remember the words and understand the sense. Otherwise my
mind will simply not work.” And he would often tell the little pages who waited on
him, “The word ‘girl’ is very precious and very pure. It is much more rare and
precious than all the rarest beasts and birds and plants in the world. So it is most
extremely important that you should never, never violate it with your coarse mouths
and stinking breath. Whenever you need to say it, you should first rinse your mouths
out with clean water and scented tea. And if ever I catch you slipping up, I shall have
holes drilled through your teeth and lace them up together.”
‘There was simply no end to his violence and unruliness. Yet as soon as his lessons
were over and he went inside to visit the girls of the family, he became a completely
different person—all gentleness and calm, and as intelligent and well-bred as you
please.
‘His father gave him several severe beatings but it made no difference. Whenever
the pain became too much for him he would start yelling “Girls! girls!” Afterwards,
when the girls in the family got to hear about it, they made fun of him. “Why do you
always call to us when you are hurt? I suppose you think we shall come and plead for
you to be let off. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” But you should have heard
his answer. He said, “Once when the pain was very bad, I thought that perhaps if I
shouted the word ‘girls’ it might help to ease it. Well,” he said, “I just called out once,
and the pain really was quite a bit better. So now that I have found this secret remedy,
I just keep on shouting ‘Girls! girls! girls!’ whenever the pain is at its worst.” I could
not help laughing.
‘But because his grandmother doted on him so much, she was always taking the
child’s part against me and his father. In the end I had to hand in my notice. A boy like
that will never be able to keep up the family traditions or listen to the advice of his
teachers and friends. The pity of it is, though, that the girls in that family are all
exceptionally good.’
‘The three at present in the Jia household are also very fine girls,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Sir
Jia Zheng’s eldest girl, Yuan?chun, was chosen for her exceptional virtue and
cleverness to be a Lady Secretary in the Imperial Palace. The next in age after her and
eldest of the three still at home is called Ying?chun. She is the daughter of Sir Jia She
by one of his secondary wives. After her comes another daughter of Sir Zheng’s, also
a concubine’s child, called Tan-chun. The youngest, Xi-chun, is sister-german to Mr Jia
Zhen of the Ning-guo mansion. Old Lady Jia is very fond of her granddaughters and
keeps them all in her own apartments on the Rong-guo side. They all study together,
and I have been told that they are doing very well.’
‘One of the things I liked about the Zhen family,’ said Yu-cun, ‘was their custom of
giving the girls the same sort of names as the boys, unlike the majority of families
who invariably use fancy words like “chun”, “hong”, “xiang”, “yu”, and so forth. How
comes it that the Jias should have followed the vulgar practice in this respect?’
‘They didn’t,’ said Zi-xing. ‘The eldest girl was called “Yuan-chun” because she was
in fact born on the first day of spring. The others were given names with “chun” in
them to match hers. But if you go back a generation, you will find that among the Jias
too the girls had names exactly like the boys’.
‘I can give you proof. Your present employer’s good lady is sister-german to Sir She
and Sir Zheng of the Rong house?hold. Her name, before she married, was Jia Min. If
you don’t believe me, you make a few inquiries when you get home and you’ll find it
is so.’
Yu-cun clapped his hands with a laugh. ‘Of course! I have often wondered why it is
that my pupil Dai-yu always pronounces “min” as “mi” when she is reading and, if
she has to write it, always makes the character with one or two strokes missing. Now
I understand. No wonder her speech and behaviour are so unlike those of ordinary
children! I always supposed that there must have been something remarkable about
the mother for her to have produced so remarkable a daughter. Now I know that she
was related to the Jias of the Rong household, I am not surprised.
‘By the way, I am sorry to say that last month the mother passed away.’
Zi-xing sighed. ‘Fancy her dying so soon! She was the youngest of the three. And the
generation before them are all gone, every one. We shall have to see what sort of
husbands they manage to find for the younger generation!’
‘Yes, indeed,’ said Yu-cun. ‘Just now you mentioned that Sir Zheng had this boy with
the jade in his mouth and you also mentioned a little grandson left behind by his
elder son. What about old Sir She? Surely he must have a son?’
‘Since Sir Zheng had the boy with the jade, he has had another son by a concubine,’
said Zi-xing, ‘but I couldn’t tell you what he’s like. So at present he has two sons and
one grandson. Of course, we don’t know what the future may bring.
‘But you were asking about Sir She. Yes, he has a son too, called Jia Lian. He’s
already a young man in his early twenties. He married his own kin, the niece of his
Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. He’s been married now ￡or four or five years.
Holds the rank of a Sub-perfect by purchase. He’s another member of the family who
doesn’t find responsibilities congenial. He knows his way around, though, and has a
great gift of the gab, so at present he stays at home with his Uncle Zheng and helps
him manage the family’s affairs. However, ever since he married this young lady I
mentioned, every?one high and low has joined in praising her, and he has been put
into the shade rather. She is not only a very handsome young woman, she also has a
very ready tongue and a very good head – more than a match for most men, I can tell
you.’
‘You see, I was not mistaken,’ said Yu-cun. ‘All these people you and I have been
talking about are probably examples of that mixture of good and evil humours I was
describing to you.’
‘Well, I don’t know about that,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Instead of sitting here setting other
people’s accounts to rights, let’s have another drink!’
‘I am afraid I have drunk quite a lot while we were busy talking,’ said Yu-cun.
Zi-xing laughed. ‘There’s nothing like a good gossip about other people’s affairs for
making the wine go down! I’m sure an extra cup or two won’t do us any harm.’
Yu-cun glanced out of the window. ‘It’s getting late. We must be careful we don’t get
shut out of the city. Why not continue the conversation on our way back? Then we
can take our time.’
The two men accordingly rose from their seats, settled the bill for the wine, and were
just about to start on their way, when a voice from behind called out, ‘Yu-cun,
congratulations! I’ve got some good news for you.’
Yu-cun turned to look.
But if you wish to know who it was, you will have to read the next chapter.
CHAPTER 3

Lin Ru-hai recommends a private tutor
to his brother-in-law
And old Lady Jia extends a compassionate welcome
to the motherless child



When Yu-cun turned to look, he was surprised to see that it was Zhang Ru-gui, a
former colleague who had been cashiered at the same time and for the same reason
as himself. Zhang Ru-gui was a native of these parts, and had been living at home
since his dismissal. Having just wormed out the information that a motion put
forward in the capital for the reinstatement of ex-officials had been approved, he had
been dashing about ever since, pulling strings and soliciting help from potential
backers, and was engaged in this activity when he unexpectedly ran into Yu-cun.
Hence the tone of his greeting.
     As soon as they had finished bowing to each other, Zhang Ru-gui told Yu-cun the
good news, and after further hurried conversation they went their separate ways.
     Leng Zi-xing, who had overheard the news, proposed a plan. Why should not
Yu-cun ask his employer Lin Ru-hai to write to his brother-in-law Jia Zheng in the
capital and enlist his support on his, Yu-cun’s, behalf? Yu-cun agreed to follow this
suggestion, and presently the two friends separated.
     Back in his quarters, Yu-cun quickly hunted out a copy of the Gazette, and having
satisfied himself that the news was authentic, broached the matter next day with Lin
Ru-hai.
     ‘It so happens that an opportunity of helping you has just presented itself,’ said
Ru-hai. ‘Since my poor wife passed on, my mother-in-law in the capital has been
worried about the little girl having no one to look after her, and has already sent
some of her folk here by barge to fetch her away. The only reason she has so far not
gone is that she has not been quite recovered from her illness. I was, however, only
just now thinking that the moment to send her had arrived. And as I have still done
nothing to repay you for your kindness in tutoring her for me, you may be sure that
now this opportunity has presented itself I shall do my very best to help you.
     ‘As a matter of fact, I have already made a few arrangements. I have written this
letter here entrusting my brother-in-law with your affair, explaining my indebtedness
to you and urging him to see it properly settled. I have also made it quite clear in my
letter that any expenses which may be involved are to be taken care of; so you have
nothing to worry about on that account.’
     Yu-cun made an elaborate bow to his patron and thanked him profusely. He then
ventured a question.
     ‘I am afraid I do not know what your relation’s position is at the capital. Might it
not be a little embarrassing for a person in my situation to thrust himself upon him?’
     Ru-hai laughed. ‘You need have no anxiety on that score. My brothers-in-law in
the capital are your own kinsmen. They are grandsons of the former Duke of
Rong-guo. The elder one, Jia She, is an hereditary official of the First Rank and an
honorary colonel; the younger one, Jia Zheng, is an Under Secretary in the Ministry
of Works. He takes very much after his late grandfather: a modest, generous man,
quite without the arrogance of the pampered aristocrat. That is why I have addressed
this letter to him. If I did not have complete con?fidence in his willingness to help you,
I should not have put your honour at risk by soliciting him; nor, for that matter,
should I have taken the trouble to write the letter.’
Yu-cun now knew that what Zi-xing had told him was the truth and he thanked Lin
Ru-hai once again.
‘I have fixed the second day of next month for my little girl’s journey to the capital,’
said Ru-hai. ‘If you cared to travel with her, it would be convenient for both of us.’
     Yu-cun accepted the suggestion with eager deference. Everything, he thought to
himself, was turning out very satis?factorily. Ru-hai for his part set about preparing
presents for his wife’s family and parting gifts for Yu-cun, all of which Yu-cun in due
course took charge of.
     At first his little pupil could not be persuaded to part from her father; but her
grandmother was insistent that she should go, and Ru-hai added his own reasons.
     ‘I’m half a century old now, my dear, and I have no inten?tion of taking a second
wife; so there will be no one here to act as a mother to you. It isn’t, either, as if you
had sisters who could help to take care of you. You know how often you are poorly.
And you are still very young. It would be a great weight off my mind to know that you
had your Grandmother Jia and your uncles’ girls to fall back on. I really think you
ought to go.’
     After this Dai-yu could only take a tearful leave of her father and go down to the
boat with her nurse and the old women from the Rong mansion who had been sent
to fetch her. There was a separate boat for Yu-cun and a couple of servant-boys to
wait on him, and he too now embarked in the capacity of Dai-yu’s escort.
     In due course they arrived in the capital, and Yu-cun, dressed in his best and with
the two servant-boys at his heels, betook himself to the gate of the Rong mansion
and handed in his visiting-card, on which he had been careful to prefix the word
‘kinsman ’ to his own name. By this time Jia Zheng had already seen his
brother-in-law’s letter, and accorded him an interview without delay.
     Yu-cun’s imposing looks and cultivated speech made an excellent impression on
Jia Zheng, who was in any case always well-disposed towards scholars, and preserved
much of his grandfather’s affability with men of letters and readiness to help them in
any sort of trouble or distress. And since his own in?clinations were in this case
reinforced by his brother-in-law’s strong recommendation, the treatment he
extended to Yu-cun was exceptionally favourable. He exerted himself on his behalf to
such good effect that on the very day his petition was presented Yu-cun’s
reinstatement was approved, and before two months were out he was appointed to
the magistracy of Ying-tian-fu in Nanking. Thither, having chosen a suitable day on
which to commence his journey, and having first taken his leave of Jia Zheng, he now
repaired to take up his duties.
    But of him, for the time being, no more.



*



On the day of her arrival in the capital, Dai-yu stepped ashore to find covered chairs
from the Rong mansion for her and her women and a cart for the luggage ready
waiting on the quay.
     She had often heard her mother say that her Grandmother Jia’s home was not
like other people’s houses. The servants she had been in contact with during the past
few days were comparatively low-ranking ones in the domestic hierarchy, yet the
food they ate, the clothes they wore, and everything about them was quite out of
the ordinary. Dai-yu tried to imagine what the people who employed these superior
beings must be like. When she arrived at their house she would have to watch every
step she took and weigh every word she said, for if she put a foot wrong they would
surely laugh her to scorn.
     Dai-yu got into her chair and was soon carried through the city walls. Peeping
through the gauze panel which served as a window, she could see streets and
buildings more rich and elegant and throngs of people more lively and numerous
than she had ever seen in her life before. After being carried for what seemed a very
great length of time, she saw, on the north front of the east-west street through
which they were passing, two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple
gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads. In front of the gateway
ten or so splendidly dressed flunkeys sat in a row. The centre of the three gates was
closed, but people were going in and out of the two side ones. There was a board
above the centre gate on which were written in large characters the words:

NING-GUO HOUSE
Founded and Constructed by
Imperial Command

Dai-yu realized that this must be where the elder branch of her grandmother’s family
lived. The chair proceeded some dis?tance more down the street and presently there
was another triple gate, this time with the legend

RONG-GUO HOUSE
above it.
    Ignoring the central gate, her bearers went in by the western entrance and after
traversing the distance of a bow-shot inside, half turned a corner and set the chair
down. The chairs of her female attendants which were following behind were set
down simultaneously and the old women got out. The places of Dai-yu’s bearers
were taken by four handsome, fresh-faced pages of seventeen or eighteen. They
shouldered her chair and, with the old women now following on foot, carried it as far
as an ornamental inner gate. There they set it down again and then retired in
respectful silence. The old women came forward to the front of the chair, held up the
curtain, and helped Dai-yu to get out.
    Each hand resting on the outstretched hand of an elderly attendant, Dai-yu
passed through the ornamental gate into a courtyard which had balustraded loggias
running along its sides and a covered passage-way through the center. The
fore?ground of the courtyard beyond was partially hidden by a screen of polished
marble set in an elaborate red sandalwood frame. Passing round the screen and
through a small reception hall beyond it, they entered the large courtyard of the
man?sion’s principal apartments. These were housed in an imposing five-frame
building resplendent with carved and painted beams and rafters which faced them
across the courtyard. Running along either side of the courtyard were galleries hung
with cages containing a variety of different-coloured parrots, cockatoos, white-eyes,
and other birds. Some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main
building opposite. At the appearance of the visitors they rose to their feet and came
forward with smiling faces to welcome them.
    ‘You’ve come just at the right time! Lady Jia was only this moment asking about
you.’
    Three or four of them ran to lift up the door-curtain, while another of them
announced in loud tones,
    ‘Miss Lin is here!’
    As Dai-yu entered the room she saw a silver-haired old lady advancing to meet
her, supported on either side by a servant. She knew that this must be her
Grandmother Jia and would have fallen on her knees and made her kotow, but before
she could do so her grandmother had caught her in her arms and pressing her to her
bosom with cries of ‘My pet!’ and ‘My poor lamb!’ burst into loud sobs, while all
those present wept in sympathy, and Dai-yu felt herself crying as though she could
never stop. It was some time before those present succeeded in calming them both
down and Dai-yu was at last able to make her kotow.
Grandmother Jia now introduced those present.
‘This is your elder uncle’s wife, Aunt Xing. This is your Uncle Zheng’s wife, Aunt
Wang. This is Li Wan, the wife of your Cousin Zhu, who died.’
Dai-yu kowtowed to each of them in turn.
‘Call the girls!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them that we have a very special visitor
and that they need not do their lessons today.’
There was a cry of ‘Yes ma’am’ from the assembled maids, and two of them went off
to do her bidding.
Presently three girls arrived, attended by three nurses and five or six maids.
The first girl was of medium height and slightly plumpish, with cheeks as white and
firm as a fresh lychee and a nose as white and shiny as soap made from the white
goose-fat. She had a gentle, sweet, reserved manner. To look at her was to love her.
The second girl was rather tall, with sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She had
an oval face under whose well-formed brows large, expressive eyes shot out glances
that sparkled with animation. To look at her was to forget all that was mean or vulgar.

The third girl was undersized and her looks were still some?what babyish and
unformed.
All three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of
bracelets and hair ornaments.
Dai-yu rose to meet them and exchanged curtseys and intro?ductions. When she was
seated once more, a maid served tea, and a conversation began on the subject of her
mother: how her illness had started, what doctors had been called in, what
medicines prescribed, what arrangements had been made for the funeral, and how
the mourning had been observed. This conversation had the foreseeable effect of
upsetting the old lady all over again.
‘Of all my girls your mother was the one I loved the best,’ she said, ‘and now she’s
been the first to go, and without my even being able to see her again before the end.
I can’t help being upset!’ And holding fast to Dai-yu’s hand, she once more burst into
tears. The rest of the company did their best to comfort her, until at last she had
more or less re?covered
Everyone’s attention now centred on Dai-yu. They ob?served that although she was
still young, her speech and manner already showed unusual refinement. They also
noticed the frail body which seemed scarcely strong enough to bear the weight of its
clothes, but which yet had an inexpressible grace about it, and realizing that she
must be suffering from some deficiency, asked her what medicine she took for it and
why it was still not better.
‘I have always been like this,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have been taking medicine ever since I
could eat and been looked at by ever so many well-known doctors, but it has never
done me any good. Once, when I was only three, I can remember a scabby-headed
old monk came and said he wanted to take me away and have me brought up as a
nun; but of course, Mother and Father wouldn’t hear of it. So he said, “Since you are
not prepared to give her up, I am afraid her illness will never get better as long as she
lives. The only way it might get better would be if she were never to hear the sound
of weeping from this day onwards and never to see any relations other than her own
mother and father. Only in those conditions could she get through her life without
trouble.” Of course, he was quite crazy, and no one took any notice of the things he
said. I’m still taking Ginseng Tonic Pills.’
‘Well, that’s handy,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I take the Pills myself. We can easily tell
them to make up a few more each time.’
She had scarcely finished speaking when someone could be heard talking and
laughing in a very loud voice in the inner courtyard behind them.
‘Oh dear! I’m late,’ said the voice. ‘I’ve missed the arrival of our guest.’
‘Everyone else around here seems to go about with bated breath,’ thought Dai-yu.
‘Who can this new arrival be who is so brash and unmannerly?’
Even as she wondered, a beautiful young woman entered from the room behind the
one they were sitting in, surrounded by a bevy of serving women and maids. She was
dressed quite differently from the others present, gleaming like some fairy princess
with sparkling jewels and gay embroideries.
Her chignon was enclosed in a circlet of gold filigree and clustered pearls. It was
fastened with a pin embellished with flying phoenixes, from whose beaks pearls were
suspended on tiny chains.
Her necklet was of red gold in the form of a coiling dragon. Her dress had a fitted
bodice and was made of dark red silk damask with a pattern of flowers and
butterflies in raised gold thread.
Her jacket was lined with ermine. It was of a slate-blue stuff with woven insets in
coloured silks.
Her under-skirt was of a turquoise-coloured imported silk crêpe embroidered with
flowers.
She had, moreover,
eyes like a painted phoenix,
eyebrows like willow-eaves,
a slender form,
seductive grace;
the ever-smiling summer face
of hidden thunders showed no trace;
the ever-bubbling laughter started
almost before the lips were parted.
‘You don’t know her,’ said Grandmother Jia merrily. ‘She’s a holy terror this one.
What we used to call in Nanking a “peppercorn”. You just call her “Peppercorn Feng”.
She’ll know who you mean!’
Dai-yu was at a loss to know how she was to address this Peppercorn Feng until one
of the cousins whispered that it was ‘Cousin Lian’s wife’, and she remembered having
heard her mother say that her elder uncle, Uncle She, had a son called Jia Lian who
was married to the niece of her Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. She had been
brought up from earliest childhood just like a boy, and had acquired in the
schoolroom the somewhat boyish-sounding name of Wang Xi-feng. Dai-yu
accordingly smiled and curtseyed, greeting her by her correct name as she did so.
Xi-feng took Dai-yu by the hand and for a few moments scrutinized her carefully from
top to toe before conducting her back to her seat beside Grandmother Jia.
‘She’s a beauty, Grannie dear! If I hadn’t set eyes on her today, I shouldn’t have
believed that such a beautiful creature could exist! And everything about her so
distingué!She doesn’t take after your side of the family, Grannie. She’s more like a Jia.
I don’t blame you for having gone on so about her during the past few days—but
poor little thing! What a cruel fate to have lost Auntie like that!’ and she dabbed at
her eyes with a handkerchief.
‘I’ve only just recovered,’ laughed Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t you go trying to start me
off again! Besides, your little cousin is not very strong, and we’ve only just managed
to get her cheered up. So let’s have no more of this!’
In obedience to the command Xi-feng at once exchanged her grief for merriment.
‘Yes，of course. It was just that seeing my little cousin here put everything else out
of my mind. It made me want to laugh and cry all at the same time. I’m afraid I quite
forgot about you, Grannie dear. I deserve to be spanked, don’t I?’
She grabbed Dai-yu by the hand.
‘How old are you dear? Have you begun school yet? You mustn’t feel home sick
here. If there’s anything you want to eat or anything you want to play with, just come
and tell me. And you must tell me if any of the maids or the old nannies are nasty to
you.’

Dai-yu made appropriate responses to all of these questions and injunctions.
Xi-feng turned to the servants.
‘Have Miss Lin’s things been brought in yet? How many people did she bring with
her? You’d better hurry up and get a couple of rooms swept out for them to rest in.’
While Xi-feng was speaking, the servants brought in tea and various plates of food,
the distribution of which she pro?ceeded to supervise in person.
Dai-yu noticed her Aunt Wang questioning Xi-feng on the side:
‘Have this month’s allowances been paid out yet?’
‘Yes. By the way, just now I went with some of the women to the upstairs
storeroom at the back to look for that satin. We looked and looked, but we couldn’t
find any like the one you described yesterday. Perhaps you misremembered.’
‘Oh well, if you can’t find it, it doesn’t really matter,’ said Lady Wang. Then, after a
moment’s reflection, ‘You’d better pick out a couple of lengths presently to have
made up into clothes for your little cousin here. If you think of it, send someone
round in the evening to fetch them!’
‘It’s already been seen to. I knew she was going to arrive within a day or two, so I
had some brought out in readiness. They are waiting back at your place for your
approval. If you think they are all right, they can be sent over straight away.’
Lady Wang merely smiled and nodded her head without saying anything.
The tea things and dishes were now cleared away, and Grandmother Jia ordered two
old nurses to take Dai-yu round to see her uncles; but Uncle She’s wife, Lady Xing,
hurriedly rose to her feet and suggested that it would be more convenient if she
were to take her niece round herself.
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You go now, then. There is no need for you to
come back afterwards.’
So having, together with Lady Wang, who was also return?ing to her quarters, taken
leave of the old lady, Lady Xing went off with Dai-yu, attended across the courtyard
as far as the covered way by the rest of the company.
A carriage painted dark blue and hung with kingfisher-blue curtains had been drawn
up in front of the ornamental gateway by some pages. Into this Aunt Xing ascended
hand in hand with Dai-yu. The old women pulled down the carriage blind and
ordered the pages to take up the shafts, the pages drew the carriage into an open
space and harnessed mules to it, and Dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the
west gate, east?wards past the main gate of the Rong mansion, in again through a big
black-lacquered gate, and up to an inner gate, where they were set down again.
Holding Dai-yu by the hand, Aunt Xing led her into a courtyard in the middle of what
she imagined must once have been part of the mansion’s gardens. This impression
was strengthened when they passed through a third gateway into the quarters
occupied by her uncle and aunt; for here the smaller scale and quiet elegance of the
halls, galleries and loggias were quite unlike the heavy magnificence and impos?ing
grandeur they had just come from, and ornamental trees and artificial rock
formations, all in exquisite taste, were to be seen on every hand.
As they entered the main reception hall, a number of heavily made-up and
expensively dressed maids and concubines, who had been waiting in readiness, came
forward to greet them.
Aunt Xing asked Dai-yu to be seated while she sent a ser?vant to call Uncle She. After
a considerable wait the servant returned with the following message:
‘The Master says he hasn’t been well these last few days, and as it would only upset
them both if he were to see Miss Lin now, he doesn’t feel up to it for the time being.
He says, tell Miss Lin not to grieve and not to feel homesick. She must think of her
grandmother and her aunts as her own family now. He says that her cousins may not
be very clever girls, but at least they should be company for her and help to take her
mind off things. If she finds anything at all here to distress her, she is to speak up at
once. She mustn’t feel like an outsider. She is to make herself completely at home.’
Dai-yu stood up throughout this recital and murmured polite assent whenever assent
seemed indicated. She then sat for about another quarter of an hour before rising to
take her leave. Her Aunt Xing was very pressing that she should have a meal with her
before she went, but Dai-yu smilingly replied that though it was very kind of her aunt
to offer, and though she ought really not to refuse, nevertheless she still had to pay
her respects to her Uncle Zheng, and feared that it would be disrespectful if she were
to arrive late. She hoped that she might accept on another occasion and begged her
aunt to excuse her.
‘In that case, never mind,’ said Lady Xing, and instructed the old nurses to see her
to her Uncle Zheng’s in the same carriage she had come by. Dai-yu formally took her
leave, and Lady Xing saw her as far as the inner gate, where she issued a few more
instructions to the servants and watched her niece’s carriage out of sight before
returning to her rooms.
Presently they re-entered the Rong mansion proper and Dai-yu got down from the
carriage. There was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate,
along which the old nurses now conducted her. Turning right, they led her down a
roofed passage-way along the back of a south-facing hall, then through an inner gate
into a large courtyard.
The big building at the head of the courtyard was connected at each end to galleries
running through the length of the side buildings by means of ‘stag’s head’ roofing
over the corners. The whole formed an architectural unit of greater sumptuous?ness
and magnificence than anything Dai-yu had yet seen that day, from which she
concluded that this must be the main inner hall of the whole mansion.
High overhead on the wall facing her as she entered the hall was a great blue board
framed in gilded dragons, on which was written in large gold characters

THE HALL OF EXALTED FELICITY

with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words ‘....
written for Our beloved Subject, Jia Yuan,.Duke of Rong-guo’, followed by the
Emperor’s private seal, a device containing the words ‘kingly cares’ and ‘royal brush’
in archaic seal-script.
A long, high table of carved red sandalwood, ornamented with dragons, stood
against the wall underneath. In the centre of this was a huge antique bronze ding,
fully a yard high, covered with a green patina. On the wall above the ding hung a long
vertical scroll with an ink-painting of a dragon emerg?ing from clouds and waves, of
the kind often presented to high court officials in token of their office. The ding was
flanked on one side by a smaller antique bronze vessel with a pattern of gold inlay
and on the other by a crystal bowl. At each side of the table stood a row of eight
yellow cedar-wood armchairs with their backs to the wall; and above the chairs hung,
one on each side, a pair of vertical ebony boards inlaid with a couplet in characters of
gold:
  (on the right-hand one)
May the jewel of learning shine in this house more effulgently than the sun and
moon.
  (on the left-hand one)
May the insignia of honour glitter in these halls more brilliantly than the starry sky.

This was followed by a colophon in smaller characters:

With the Respectful Compliments of your Fellow-
Student, Mu Shi, Hereditary Prince of Dong-an.

Lady Wang did not, however, normally spend her leisure hours in this main reception
hall, but in a smaller room on the east side of the same building. Accordingly the
nurses con?ducted Dai-yu through the door into this side apartment.
Here there was a large kang underneath the window, covered with a scarlet Kashmir
rug. In the middle of the kang was a dark-red bolster with a pattern of medallions in
the form of tiny dragons, and a long russet-green seating strip in the same pattern. A
low rose-shaped table of coloured lacquer-work stood at each side. On the left-hand
one was a small, square, four-legged ding, together with a bronze ladle, metal
chop?sticks, and an incense container. On the right-hand one was a narrow-waisted
Ru-ware imitation gu with a spray of freshly cut flowers in it.
In the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the
east wall. All had footstools in front of them and chair-backs and seat-covers in old
rose brocade sprigged with flowers. There were also narrow side-tables on which tea
things and vases of flowers were arranged, besides other furnishings which it would
be superfluous to enumerate.
The old nurses invited Dai-yu to get up on the kang; but guessing that the brocade
cushions arranged one on each side near the edge of it must be her uncle’s and
aunt’s places, she deemed it more proper to sit on one of the chairs against the wall
below. The maids in charge of the apartment served tea, and as she sipped it Dai-yu
observed that their clothing, make?up, and deportment were quite different from
those of the maids she had seen so far in other parts of the mansion.
Before she had time to finish her tea, a smiling maid came in wearing a dress of red
damask and a black silk sleeveless jacket which had scalloped borders of some
coloured material.
‘The Mistress says will Miss Lin come over to the other side, please.’
The old nurses now led Dai-yu down the east gallery to a reception room at the side
of the courtyard. This too had a kang. It was bisected by a long, low table piled with
books and tea things. A much-used black satin back-rest was pushed up against the
east wall. Lady Wang was seated on a black satin cushion and leaning against another
comfortable-looking back-rest of black satin somewhat farther forward on the
opposite side.
Seeing her niece enter, she motioned her to sit opposite her on the kang, but Dai-yu
felt sure that this must be her Uncle Zheng’s place. So, having observed a row of
three chairs near the kang with covers of flower-sprigged brocade which looked as
though they were in fairly constant use, she sat upon one of those instead. Only after
much further pressing from her aunt would she get up on the kang, and even then
she would only sit beside her and not in the position of honour opposite.
‘Your uncle is in retreat today,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He will see you another time.
There is, however, something I have got to talk to you about. The three girls are very
well-behaved children, and in future, when you are studying or sewing together, even
if once in a while they may grow a bit high-spirited, I can depend on them not to go
too far. There is only one thing that worries me. I have a little monster of a son who
tyrannizes over all the rest of this household. He has gone off to the temple today in
fulfillment of a vow and is not yet back; but you will see what I mean this evening.
The thing to do is never to take any notice of him. None of your cousins dare provoke
him.’
Dai-yu had long ago been told by her mother that she had a boy cousin who was
born with a piece of jade in his mouth and who was exceptionally wild and naughty.
He hated study and liked to spend all his time in the women’s apartments with the
girls, but because Grandmother Jia doted on him so much, no one ever dared to
correct him. She realized that it must be this cousin her aunt was now referring to.
‘Do you mean the boy born with the jade, Aunt?’ she asked. ‘Mother often told me
about him at home. She told me that he was one year older than me and that his
name was Bao-yu. But she said that though he was very willful, he always behaved
very nicely to girls. Now that I am here, I suppose I shall be spending all my time with
my girl cousins and not in the same part of the house as the boys. Surely there will be
no danger of my provoking him?’
Lady Wang gave a rueful smile. ‘You little know how things are here! Bao-yu is a law
unto himself. Because your grandmother is so fond of him she has thoroughly spoiled
him. When he was little he lived with the girls, so with the girls he remains now. As
long as they take no notice of him, things run quietly enough. But if they give him the
least encouragement, he at once becomes excitable, and then there is no end to the
mischief he may get up to. That is why I counsel you to ignore him. He can be all
honey-sweet words one minute and ranting and raving like a lunatic the next. So
don’t believe anything he says.’
Dai-yu promised to follow her aunt’s advice.
Just then a maid came in with a message that ‘Lady Jia said it was time for dinner’,
whereupon Lady Wang took Dai-yu by the hand and hurried her out through a back
door. Passing along a verandah which ran beneath the rear eaves of the hall they
came to a corner gate through which they passed into an alley-way running north
and south. At the south end it was traversed by a narrow little building with a short
passage-way running through its middle. At the north end was a white ?painted
screen wall masking a medium-sized gateway leading to a small courtyard in which
stood a very little house.
‘That,’ said Lady Wang, pointing to the little house, ‘is where your Cousin Lian’s
wife, Wang Xi-feng, lives, in case you want to see her later on. She is the person to
talk to if there is anything you need.’
There were a few young pages at the gate of the courtyard who, when they saw Lady
Wang coming, all stood to attention with their hands at their sides.
Lady Wang now led Dai-yu along a gallery, running from east to west, which brought
them out into the courtyard be?hind Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Entering these
by a back entrance, they found a number of servants waiting there who, as soon as
they saw Lady Wang, began to arrange the table and chairs for dinner. The ladies of
the house themselves took part in the service. Li Wan brought in the cups, Xi-feng
laid out the chopsticks, and Lady Wang brought in the soup.
The table at which Grandmother Jia presided, seated alone on a couch, had two
empty chairs on either side. Xi-feng tried to seat Dai-yu in the one on the left nearer
to her grand?mother —an honour which she strenuously resisted until her
grandmother explained that her aunt and her elder cousins’ wives would not be
eating with them, so that, since she was a guest, the place was properly hers. Only
then did she ask per?mission to sit, as etiquette prescribed. Grandmother Jia then
ordered Lady Wang to be seated. This was the cue for the three girls to ask
permission to sit. Ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite Dai-yu,
Tan-chun sat second on the left, and Xi-chun sat second on the right.
While Li Wan and Xi-feng stood by the table helping to distribute food from the
dishes, maids holding fly-whisks, spittoons, and napkins ranged themselves on either
side. In addition to these, there were numerous other maids and serving-women in
attendance in the outer room, yet not so much as a cough was heard throughout the
whole of the meal.
When they had finished eating, a maid served each diner with tea on a little tray.
Dai-yu’s parents had brought their daughter up to believe that good health was
founded on care?ful habits, and in pursuance of this principle, had always in?sisted
that after a meal one should allow a certain interval to elapse before taking tea in
order to avoid indigestion. How?ever, she could see that many of the rules in this
household were different from the ones she had been used to at home; so, being
anxious to conform as much as possible, she accepted the tea. But as she did so,
another maid preferred a spittoon, from which she inferred that the tea was for
rinsing her mouth with. And it was not, in fact, until they had all rinsed out their
mouths and washed their hands that another lot of tea was served, this time for
drinking.
Grandmother Jia now dismissed her lady servers, observing that she wished to enjoy
a little chat with her young grand children without the restraint of their grown-up
presence.
Lady Wang obediently rose to her feet and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, went
out, taking Li Wan and Wang Xi-feng with her.
Grandmother Jia asked Dai-yu what books she was studying.
‘The Four Books,’ said Dai-yu, and inquired in turn what books her cousins were
currently engaged on.
‘Gracious, child, they don’t study books,’ said her grand?mother; ‘they can barely
read and write!’
While they were speaking, a flurry of footsteps could be heard outside and a maid
came in to say that Bao-yu was back.
‘I wonder,’ thought Dai-yu, ‘just what sort of graceless creature this Bao-yu is going
to be!’
The young gentleman who entered in answer to her un?spoken question had a small
jewel-encrusted gold coronet on the top of his head and a golden headband low
down over his brow in the form of two dragons playing with a large pearl.
He was wearing a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of dark red material with a
pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold. It was confined at the waist
with a court girdle of coloured silks braided at regular intervals into elaborate clusters
of knotwork and terminating in long tassels.
Over the upper part of his robe he wore a jacket of slate-blue Japanese silk damask
with a raised pattern of eight large medallions on the front and with tasselled
borders.
On his feet he had half-length dress boots of black satin with thick white soles.
As to his person, he had:
a face like the moon of Mid-Autumn,
a complexion like flowers at dawn,
a hairline straight as a knife-cut,
eyebrows that might have been painted by an artist’s brush,
a shapely nose, and
eyes clear as limpid pools,
that even in anger seemed to smile,
and, as they glared, beamed tenderness the while.
Around his neck he wore a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon and a woven
cord of coloured silks to which the famous jade was attached.
Dai-yu looked at him with astonishment. How strange! How very strange! It was as
though she had seen him somewhere before, he was so extraordinarily familiar.
Bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother, who told him to come
after he had seen his mother, whereupon he turned round and walked straight out
again.
Quite soon he was back once more, this time dressed in a completely different outfit.
The crown and circlet had gone. She could now see that his side hair was dressed in a
number of small braids plaited with red silk, which were drawn round to join the long
hair at the back in a single large queue of glistening jet black, fastened at intervals
from the nape downwards with four enormous pearls and ending in a jewelled gold
clasp. He had changed his robe and jacket for a rather more worn-looking
rose-coloured gown, sprigged with flowers. He wore the gold torque and his jade as
before, and she observed that the collection of objects round his neck had been
further augmented by a padlock-shaped amulet and a lucky charm. A pair of
ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown, thrust
into black and white socks trimmed with brocade. In place of the formal boots he
was wearing thick-soled crimson slippers.
She was even more struck than before by his fresh com?plexion. The cheeks might
have been brushed with powder and the lips touched with rouge, so bright was their
natural colour.
His glance was soulful,
yet from his lips the laughter often leaped;
a world of charm upon that brow was heaped;
a world of feeling from those dark eyes peeped.
In short, his outward appearance was very fine. But appear?ances can be misleading.
A perceptive poet has supplied two sets of verses, to be sung to the tune of Moon On
West River, which contain a more accurate appraisal of our hero than the foregoing
descriptions.

1

        Oft-times he sought out what would make him sad;
        Sometimes an idiot seemed and sometimes mad.
        Though outwardly a handsome sausage-skin,
        He proved to have but sorry meat within.
        A harum-scarum, to all duty blind,
        A doltish mule, to study disinclined;
        His acts outlandish and his nature queer;
        Yet not a whit cared he how folk might jeer!
2
        Prosperous, he could not play his part with grace,
        Nor, poor, bear hardship with a smiling face.
        So shamefully the precious hours he’d waste
        That both indoors and out he was disgraced.
        For uselessness the world’s prize he might bear;
        His gracelessness in history has no peer.
        Let gilded youths who every dainty sample
        Not imitate this rascal’s dire example!


‘Fancy changing your clothes before you have welcomed the visitor!’ Grandmother
Jia chided indulgently on seeing Bao-yu back again. ‘Aren’t you going to pay your
respects to your cousin?’
Bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender, delicate girl whom he surmised to be
his Aunt Lin’s daughter and quickly went over to greet her. Then, returning to his
place and taking a seat, he studied her attentively. How different she seemed from
the other girls he knew!
Her mist-wreathed brows at first seemed to frown, yet were not frowning;
Her passionate eyes at first seemed to smile, yet were not merry.
Habit had given a melancholy cast to her tender face;
Nature had bestowed a sickly constitution on her delicate frame.
Often the eyes swam with glistening tears;
Often the breath came in gentle gasps.
In stillness she made one think of a graceful flower reflected in the water;
In motion she called to mind tender willow shoots caressed by the wind.
She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan;
And suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi.
Having completed his survey, Bao-yu gaved a laugh.
‘I have seen this cousin before.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How could you possibly have done?’
‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but her face seems so familiar that I have the
impression of meeting her again after a long separation.’
‘All the better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That means that you should get on well
together.’
Bao-yu moved over again and, drawing a chair up beside Dai-yu, recommenced his
scrutiny.
Presently: ‘Do you study books yet, cousin?’
‘No,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have only been taking lessons for a year or so. I can barely read
and write.’
‘What’s your name?’
Dai-yu told him.
‘What’s your school-name?’
‘I haven’t got one.’
Bao-yu laughed. ‘I’ll give you one, cousin. I think “Frowner” would suit you perfectly.’
‘Where’s your reference?’ said Tan-chun.
‘In the Encyclopedia of Men and Objects Ancient and Modern it says that
somewhere in the West there is a mineral called “dai” which can be used instead of
eye-black for painting the eye?brows with. She has this “dai” in her name and she
knits her brows together in a little frown. I think it’s a splendid name for her!’
‘I expect you made it up,’ said Tan-chun scornfully.
‘What if I did?’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are lots of made-up things in books—apart from
the Four Books, of course.’
He returned to his interrogation of Dai-yu.
‘Have you got a jade?’
The test of the company were puzzled, hut Dai-yu at once divined that he was asking
her if she too had a jade like the one he was born with.
‘No,’ said Dal-yu. ‘That jade of yours is a very rare object. You can’t expect
everybody to have one.’
This sent Bao-yu off instantly into one of his mad fits. Snatching the jade from his
neck he hurled it violently on the floor as if to smash it and began abusing it
passionately.
‘Rare object! Rare object! What’s so lucky about a stone that can’t even tell which
people are better than others? Beastly thing! I don’t want it!’
The maids all seemed terrified and rushed forward to pick it up, while Grandmother
Jia clung to Bao-yu in alarm.
‘Naughty, naughty boy! Shout at someone or strike them if you like when you are in
a nasty temper, but why go smashing that precious thing that your very life depends
on?’
‘None of the girls has got one,’ said Bao-yu, his face stream?ing with tears and
sobbing hysterically. ‘Only I have got one. It always upsets me. And now this new
cousin comes here who is as beautiful as an angel and she hasn’t got one either; so I
know it can’t be any good.’
‘Your cousin did have a jade once,’ said Grandmother Jia, coaxing him like a little
child, ‘but because when Auntie died she couldn’t bear to leave her little girl behind,
they had to let her take the jade with her instead. In that way your cousin could show
her mamma how much she loved her by letting the jade be buried with her; and at
the same time, whenever Auntie’s spirit looked at the jade, it would be just like
looking at her own little girl again.
‘So when your cousin said she hadn’t got one, it was only because she didn’t want
to boast about the good, kind thing she did when she gave it to her mamma. Now
you put yours on again like a good boy, and mind your mother doesn’t find out how
naughty you have been.’
So saying, she took the jade from the hands of one of the maids and hung it round
his neck for him. And Bao-yu, after reflecting for a moment or two on what she had
said, offered no further resistance.
At this point some of the older women came to inquire what room Dai-yu was to
sleep in.
‘Move Bao-yu into the closet-bed with me,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘and put Miss
Lin for the time being in the green muslin summer-bed. We had better wait until
spring when the last of the cold weather is over before seeing about the rooms for
them and getting them settled permanently.’
‘Dearest Grannie,’ said Bao-yu pleadingly, ‘I should be perfectly all right next to the
summer-bed. There’s no need to move me into your room. I should only keep you
awake.’
Grandmother Jia, after a moment’s reflection, gave her consent. She further gave
instructions that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were each to have one nurse and one maid to
sleep with them. The rest of their servants were to do night duty by rota in the
adjoining room. Xi-feng had already sent across some lilac-coloured hangings,
brocade quilts, satin coverlets and the like for Dai-yu’s bedding.
Dai-yu had brought only two of her own people with her from home. One was her
old wet-nurse Nannie Wang, the other was a little ten-year-old maid called
Snowgoose. Con?sidering Snowgoose too young and irresponsible and Nannie Wang
too old and decrepit to be of much real service, Grand?mother Jia gave Dai-yu one of
her own maids, a body-servant of the second grade called Nightingale. She also gave
orders that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were to be attended in other respects exactly like the
three girls: that is to say, apart from the one wet-nurse, each was to have four other
nurses to act as chaper?ones, two maids as body-servants to attend to their washing,
dressing, and so forth, and four or five maids for dusting and cleaning, running
errands and general duties.
These arrangements completed, Nannie Wang and Night?ingale accompanied Dai-yu
to bed inside the tent-like summer?-bed, while Bao-yu’s wet-nurse Nannie Li and his
chief maid Aroma settled him down for the night in a big bed on the other side of the
canopy.

Like Nightingale, Aroma had previously been one of Grand?mother Jia’s own maids.
Her real name was Pearl. Bao-yu’s grandmother, fearful that the maids who already
waited on her darling boy could not be trusted to look after him properly, had picked
out Pearl as a girl of tried and conspicuous fidelity and put her in charge over them. It
was Bao-yu who was responsible for the curious name ‘Aroma’. Discovering that
Pearl’s surname was Hua, which means ‘Flowers’, and having recently come across
the line

The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days

in a book of poems, he told his grandmother that he wanted to call his new maid
‘Aroma’, so ‘Aroma’ her name thence?forth became.
Aroma had a certain dogged streak in her nature which had made her utterly devoted
to Grandmother Jia as long as she was Grandmother Jia’s servant, but which caused
her to become just as exclusively and single-mindedly devoted to Bao-yu when her
services were transferred to him. Since she found his character strange and
incomprehensible, her simple devotion frequently impelled her to remonstrate with
him, and when, as invariably happened, he took not the least notice of what she said,
she was worried and hurt.
That night, when Bao-yu and Nannie Li were already asleep, Aroma could hear that
Dai-yu and Nightingale on their side of the canopy had still not settled down, so,
when she had finished taking down her hair and making herself ready for bed, she
tiptoed through the muslin curtains and in a friendly way inquired what was the
matter. Dai-yu invited her to sit down, and when she had seated herself on the edge
of the bed, Nightingale proceeded to tell her what was troubling her new mistress.
‘Miss Lin is all upset. She has just been crying her eyes out because she says she
only just arrived here today, and yet already she has started young hopeful off on one
of his turns. She says if that jade had been really smashed, it would have been all her
fault. That’s what she’s so upset about. I’ve had no end of a job trying to comfort her.’
‘You mustn’t take on so, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘You’ll see him do much stranger things
than that before he’s finished. If you allow yourself to feel hurt every time he carries
on like that, he will always be hurting you. Try not to be so sensitive; Miss!’
Dai-yu thanked her and promised to bear in mind what she had said, and after talking
a little longer, they all settled down and went to sleep.

*

Rising early next day, they visited Grandmother Jia to wish her a good morning and
then went over to Lady Wang’s. They found her closeted with Wang Xi-feng, deep in
discus?sion of a letter which had just arrived from Nanking, and attended by two
women who had come with a message from Lady Wang’s elder brother and
sister-in-law. Tan-chun and the girls told Dai-yu, who knew nothing of the matter
under discussion, that they were talking about Xue Pan, the son of their Aunt Xue
who lived in Nanking.
It seemed that Xue Pan, relying on wealth and family pull to protect him from the
consequences, had taken another man’s life. The case was at present under
investigation by the Ying-?tian-fu yamen. Their uncle Wang Zi-teng had been
informed of it, and had sent these messengers to the members of the family in the
Rong mansion to suggest that they should invite Xue Pan to the capital.
But the outcome of this discussion will be dealt with in the following chapter.

When Dai-yu and the girls went to call on Lady Wang, they found her in the midst of
discussing family affairs with the messengers from her elder brother and his wife and
heard talk of their aunt’s family in Nanking being involved in a case of manslaughter.
Since Lady Wang was obviously preoccupied with this matter, the girls went off to call
on Li Wan.
Li Wan’s husband Jia Zhu had died young, but fortunately not without issue. He left
her a son called Jia Lan who was now’ just five years old and had already begun his
schooling. Like most of the Jia women, Li Wan was the daughter of a dis?tinguished
Nanking official. Her father, Li Shou-zhong, had been a Director of Education.
Up to Li Shou-zhong’s time, all members of the clan, in?cluding the women, had been
given a first-class education; but when Li Shou-zhong became head of the family, he
founded his educational policy for girls on the good old maxim ‘a stupid woman is a
virtuous one’ and, when he had a daughter of his own, refused to let her engage in
serious study. She was permitted to work her way through The Four Books for Girls
and Lives of Noble Women, so that she might be able to recog?nize a few characters
and be familiar with some of the models of female virtue of former ages; but
overriding importance was to be attached to spinning and sewing, and even her
name ‘Wan’, which means a kind of silk, was intended to symbolize her dedication to
the needle.
Thanks to her upbringing, this young widow living in the midst of luxury and
self-indulgence was able to keep herself like the ‘withered tree and dead ashes’ of
the philosopher, shutting out everything that did not concern her and attending only
to the duties of serving her husband’s parents and bringing up her child. Whatever
leisure this left her was devoted to her little sister-in-law and cousins, accompanying
them at their embroidery or hearing them recite their lessons.
With such gentle companions to console her, Dai-yu, though a stranger and far from
home, soon had nothing apart from her old father that she need worry about.
*

Let us now turn to the affairs of Jia Yu-cun, newly installed in the yamen at
Ying-tian-fu.
No sooner had he arrived at his new post than a case in?volving manslaughter was
referred to his tribunal. It con?cerned two parties in dispute over the purchase of a
slave-girl. Neither had been willing to give way to the other, and in the ensuing affray
one of the parties had been wounded and had subsequently died. After reading the
papers in the case, Yu-cun summoned the plaintiff for questioning and received from
him the following account of what had happened:
‘The murdered man was my master, Your Honour. Although he did not realize it at
the time, the girl he purchased had been kidnapped by the man who was selling her.
My master paid him in advance, and arranged to receive the girl into his house three
days from the date of purchase, the third day being a lucky day. The kidnapper,
having already pocketed my young master’s money, then quietly went off and sold
her again to Xue. When we found this out, we went along to seize him and to collect
the girl.
‘But unfortunately this Xue turned out to be a powerful Nanking boss, who
evidently thought that by money and influence he could get away with anything. He
set a crowd of his henchmen on to my young master and beat him up so badly that
he died.
‘Xue and his henchmen have now disappeared without trace, leaving only a few
retainers who were not involved in the crime. But though it is a year since I first
brought this charge, no one has yet done anything to help me. I beseech Your Honour
to arrest the criminals and to uphold the course of justice! Both the living and the
dead will be everlastingly grateful to you if you do!’
‘This is monstrous!’ said Yu-cun in a towering rage. ‘Am I to understand that a man
can be beaten to death and the murderer walk off scot-free with nobody lifting a
finger to arrest him?’ and he took up a warrant and was on the point of sending his
runners to seize the murderer’s dependants and bring them to court so that they
might be put to the torture, when he observed one of the ushers signalling to him
with his eyes not to issue the warrant. His resolution somewhat shaken, he put it
down again and adjourned to his private chambers, dismissing everyone except the
usher, whom he ordered to remain behind in attendance.
When they were alone together the usher, with a broad smile on his face, came
forward and touched his hand and knee to the ground in the Manchu salute.
‘Your Honour has gone a long way up in the world during these past eight or nine
years! I don’t expect you would remember me!’
‘Your face is certainly familiar,’ said Yu-cun, ‘but for the moment I simply can’t place
it.’
The usher smiled again. ‘Has Your Honour forgotten the place you started from? Do
you remember nothing of the old times in Bottle-gourd Temple?’
With a start of recognition, Yu-cun remembered. The usher had been a little novice
in the temple where he once lodged
Finding himself homeless after the fire, and bethinking him?self that a post in a
yamen was a fine, gentlemanly way of earn?ing a living, and being furthermore
heartily sick of the rigours of monastic life, the little novice had taken advantage of
his youth to grow his hair again and get himself a post as an usher. Small wonder that
Yu-cun had failed to recognize him!
‘Ah, so it was an old acquaintance!’ said Yu-cun, grasping him warmly by the hand
and urging him to sit down for a chat. But the usher would not be seated.
‘Come,’ said Yu-cun, ‘as a friend of my early, hard-up days you are entitled to. After
all, this is a private room. Why not?’
The usher permitted himself to perch one of his haunches sideways on the edge of a
chair.
‘Tell me,’ said Yu-cun, ‘why did you stop me issuing that warrant just now?’
‘Your Honour is new to this post. Surely you must have provided yourself before
you left with a copy of the Mandarin’s Life-Preserver for this province?’
‘What is the Mandarin’s Lift-Preserver?’ Yu-cun inquired curiously.
‘Nowadays every provincial official carries a private hand-list with the names of all
the richest, most influential people in his area. There is one for every province. They
list those families which are so powerful that if you were ever to run up against one
of them unknowingly, not only your job, but perhaps even your life might be in
danger. That’s why they are called “life-preservers”.
‘Now take this Xue you were dealing with just now. Your Honour couldn’t possibly
try conclusions with him! Why do you suppose this case has remained unsettled for
so long? It’s a straightforward enough case. The reason is simply that none of your
predecessors dared touch it because of the unpleasant?ness and loss of face it would
have caused them.’
While he was speaking he had been fishing for a copy of the Mandarin’s
Lift-Preserver in his pocket. This he now presented to Yu-cun for his inspection. It
contained a set of doggerel verses in which were listed the big families and most
powerful magnates of the area in which he was working. It went some-thing like this:
Shout hip hurrah
For the Nanking Jia!
They weigh their gold out
By the jar.
The Ah-bang Palace
Scrapes the sky,
But it could not house
The Nanking Shi.
The King of the Ocean
Goes along,
When he’s short of gold beds,
To the Nanking Wang.
The Nanking Xue
So rich are they,
To count their money
Would take all day...
Before Yu-cun had time to read further, a warning chime from the inner gate and a
shout outside the door announced the arrival of a Mr Wang on an official call. Yu-cun
hastily donned the hat and robe of office which he had temporarily laid aside and
went out to meet the visitor. About the length of time it would take to eat a meal
elapsed before he returned and re?sumed his conversation with the usher.
‘Those four families,’ said the usher in answer to a question from Yu-cun, ‘are all
closely connected with each other. A loss for one is a loss for all. A gain for one is a
gain for all. The Xue who has been charged with the manslaughter is one of the
“Nanking Xue so rich are they”. Not only can he count on the support of the other
three Nanking families, he also has any number of family friends and connections of
his own both at the capital and in the provinces. Now who are you going to arrest?’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Yu-cun with an uneasy laugh, ‘but how am I going to settle
this case? Incidentally, I assume you know perfectly well where the criminal is
hiding?’
‘I wouldn’t deceive Your Honour,’ replied the usher with a grin, ‘not only do I know
where the criminal has gone but I also know who the kidnapper is and all about the
poor devil who was killed. Let me tell you the whole story.
‘The man who was killed was a poor country squire’s son called Feng Yuan. His
father and mother were both dead and he had no brothers. He lived off the income
of a very small estate. He was eighteen or nineteen when he died. He was a
confirmed queer and not interested in girls. Which shows that the whole business
must have been fated, because no sooner did he set eyes on this girl than he at once
fell in love with her—swore he would never have anything more to do with boys and
never have any other woman but her. That was the idea of this waiting three days
before she came to him. To make it seem more like a wedding and less like a sale.
‘What he couldn’t foresee, of course, was that the kid?napper would use this
interval to resell her on the sly to Xue, hoping to pocket the money from both parties
and then do a flit. Only he didn’t get away with it. The two parties nabbed him before
he could disappear and beat the daylights out of him. Both refused to take back their
money, and both insisted that they wanted the girl. It was at this point that our
young friend Xue called for his roughs to get to work on Feng Yuan. They beat him till
he was hardly recognizable. Then they picked him up and carried him home. He died
three days later.
‘Now long before any of this happened, young Xue had made arrangements for a
journey to the capital. So after killing Feng and carrying off the girl, he set off with his
family, calm as you please, on the appointed day. There was no question of his
running away because of the killing. In his eyes a trifling matter like taking another
man’s life was something for his junior clansmen or the servants to clear up in his
absence.
‘But never mind him. Who do you think the slave-girl is?’
‘How in the world should I know?’ said Yu-cun.
The usher smiled maliciously. ‘You ought to, Your Honour! She is your great
benefactress —Ying-lian, the little daughter of Mr Zhen, who used to live next door
to Bottle-gourd Temple.’
‘Good gracious!’ said Yu-cun in astonishment. ‘I had heard that she was kidnapped
at the age of five. But how did she come to be sold so long after the kidnapping?’
‘This type of kidnapper specializes in kidnapping very young girls and rearing them
until they are twelve or thirteen for sale in other parts of the country. When she was
little we used to play with Ying-lian at the temple nearly every day, so I knew her very
well; and when I saw her again, even though it was after an interval of seven or eight
years, I could tell it was her. She’d grown into a little woman in the meantime, but her
features were still the same; and to confirm it there was a tiny red birthmark right in
the middle of her brow which I remembered.
‘By a strange coincidence the kidnapper had rented one of my rooms, and one day
when he was out I put it to her who she was. But she said she was scared of being
beaten and nothing would induce her to talk. She just kept insisting that the
kidnapper was her real father, selling her because he had no money to pay his debts
with. I kept on at her, cajoling and persuading, and in the end she broke down and
cried. Said she didn’t remember anything about her childhood. But there’s no doubt
in my mind. It’s her, all right.
‘The day young Feng met her and paid out the money for her, the kidnapper got
drunk, and she opened up to me a bit. She was feeling very relieved. She said, “Today
I think my tribulations are at last coming to an end.” But then later, when she heard
that she wasn’t to be installed until after another three days, she began to look
worried and despondent again. I felt truly sorry for her, and sent the wife round to
have a talk with her while the kidnapper was out and give her a bit of
encouragement.
‘The wife said to her, “Mr Feng’s insistence on waiting three days before taking you
in shows that he doesn’t intend to treat you like a servant. Besides,” she said, “he’s a
very nice, handsome gentleman, and quite comfortably off. Normally he doesn’t like
the fair sex, yet here he is spending everything he has on your purchase. You can tell
from that,” she said, “how much he must care for you. You only have to be patient for
another day or two,” she said. “You’ve no cause to be down?cast.”
‘Well, that seemed to cheer her up a bit, and she began to feel that life was going
to be worth living.
‘But only the day after that, by the most accursed stroke of bad luck which no one
could possibly have foreseen, she was sold to Xue. Now if it had been anyone else, it
wouldn’t have mattered so much, but this young Xue, whose nickname is the Oaf
King, is the world’s most bad-tempered bully; and having spent money like water on
buying the girl only to find that she wasn’t willing, he knocked her about until she
was half un?conscious and dragged her off with him more dead than alive. Whether
she’s alive or dead now, I have no idea.
‘And young Feng is really to be pitied! After a brief moment of happiness, before
anything had come his way, he spent all his money and laid down his life for nothing!’
Yu-cun sighed sympathetically. ‘Their meeting cannot have been coincidental. It must
have been the working out of some destiny. An atonement. Otherwise, how is one to
account for Feng Yuan’s sudden affection for that particular girl?
‘And Ying-lian, after all those years of ill-treatment at the hands of her kidnapper,
suddenly seeing a road to freedom opening in front of her—for she was a girl of
feeling, and there is no doubt that they would have made a fine couple if they had
succeeded in coming together—and then for this to have happened!
‘And even though Xue may be far wealthier and better-placed than Feng was, a
man like that is sure to have numbers of concubines and paramours and to be
licentious and de?bauched in his habits—quite incapable of concentrating all his
affections on one girl as Feng Yuan would have done.
‘A real case of an ideal romance on the one hand and a pair of unlucky young
things on the other adding up to make a tragedy!
‘But a truce to this discussion of other people’s affairs! Let us rather consider how
this case is to be settled!’
‘Your Honour used to be decisive enough in the old days,’ said the usher with a
smile. ‘What has become of your old resolution today? Now, I was told that your
promotion to this post was due to the combined influence of the Jias and the Wangs;
and this Xue Pan is related to the Jias by marriage. Why not trim your sails to the
wind in your handling of this case? Why not make a virtue of necessity by doing them
a favour which will stand you in good stead next time you see them?’
‘What you say is, of course, entirely correct,’ said Yu-cun. ‘But there is, after all, a
human life involved in this case; and you have to remember that I have only just been
restored to office by an act of Imperial clemency. I really cannot bring myself to
pervert justice for private ends at the very mo?ment when I ought to be doing my
utmost to show my gratitude.’
The usher smiled coldly. ‘What Your Honour says is no doubt very right and proper,
but it won’t wash. Not the way things are in the world today! Haven’t you heard the
old say?ing “The man of spirit shapes his actions to the passing moment”? And
there’s another old saying: “It is the mark of a gentleman to avoid what is
inauspicious”. If you were to act in accordance with what you have just said, not only
would you not be able to show your gratitude to the Emperor, but also you would
probably put your own life in danger. If I were you, I should think very carefully
before you do any?thing.’
Yu-cun lowered his head in thought. After a very long pause he asked, ‘What do you
think I ought to do?’
‘I’ve thought of a very good solution,’ said the usher. ‘When you open court
tomorrow, you should make a great display of authority. Send out writs, issue
warrants for arrest, and so forth. You won’t, of course, be able to arrest the cul?prits,
and the plaintiffs will certainly not allow the matter to rest there; so what you do
then is to arrest some of Xue’s clans?men and servants for questioning. But in the
meantime I shall have got to work on them on the side and arranged for them to
report that Xue has died of sudden illness. This can be supported by the affidavits of
the whole Xue clan and the people living in the neighbourhood.
‘Then Your Honour has it put about that you have a gift for the planchette. You
have an altar set up in the court and a planchette board installed on it and you issue
an open invita?tion to any members of the public who want to to attend a séance.
Then you say, “The spirit control gives judgment as follows:
‘“The dead man, Feng Yuan, owed a debt of karma to Xue Pan from a former life
and ‘meeting his enemy in a narrow way’, paid for it with his life. The sudden,
unexplained illness which struck down Xue Pan was caused by the vengeful ghost of
Feng Yuan come to claim its own. Since the tragedy was entirely due to the behaviour
of the kidnapper, the kidnapper should be dealt with according to the full rigour of
the law; but apart from him, all other parties are exonerated...” and so on and so
forth.
‘I shall secretly instruct the kidnapper to make a full con?fession, and when the
public see that the judgment given by the planchette tallies with the confession
made by the kidnapper, they will naturally have no suspicions.
‘Then you award the Fengs compensation to cover funeral expenses and so on. And
since the Xues are rolling in money, you can say anything you like. Five hundred, a
thousand—it doesn’t matter. There’s no one of any importance on the Feng side, and
in any case they’re mainly in this for the money. So once they have got their
compensation, they shouldn’t give you any further trouble.
‘What about that for a plan, Your Honour? You just think it over!’
Yu-cun laughed. ‘Too risky! Let me turn it over in my mind a little longer. The main
thing is to think of something that will stop people talking.’
And with this observation the two men concluded their discussion.
At next day’s session a group of well-known associates of the wanted man were
brought in and subjected by Yu-cun to careful questioning. It emerged, as the usher
had said, that the Fengs were few in number and had brought this action solely in the
hope of gaining some compensation, and that it was only because the Xues had, with
the arrogance of the very rich and very powerful, refused to pay a penny, that the
case had been brought to a standstill.
By a judicious bending of the law to suit the circumstances, Yu-cun managed to arrive
at some sort of judgment whereby the plaintiffs received substantial compensation
and went off tolerably well satisfied. He then hurriedly drafted and sent off two
letters, one to Jia Zheng and one to Wang Zi-teng, Commandant, Metropolitan
Barracks, in which he merely stated that their ‘nephew’s affair had been settled and
there was no further cause for concern’.
Fearful that the now usher and quondam novice of Bottle-gourd Temple might talk to
others about the days when he was an obscure and impoverished student, Yu-cun for
some time went about in great discomfort of mind. Finally, how?ever, he managed to
catch him out in some misdemeanour or other and have him drafted for military
service on a frontier outpost, after which he felt able to breathe freely again.



*

But now no more of Yu-cun. Let us turn instead to Young Xue, the man who
purchased Ying-lian and had Feng Yuan beaten to death. He was a native of Nanking
and came of a refined and highly cultivated family, but having lost his father in
infancy and been, as sole remaining scion of the stock, exces?sively indulged by a
doting widowed mother, he had grown up into a useless lout. The family was
immensely wealthy. As one of the official Court Purveyors they received money from
the Privy Purse with which to make purchases for the Imperial Household.
Xue Pan, to give him his full name, was a naturally ex?travagant young man with an
insolent turn of speech. He had been educated after a fashion, but could barely read
and write. He devoted the greater part of his time to cock-fighting, horse-racing, and
outings to places of scenic interest. Though an Imperial Purveyor, he was wholly
innocent of business skill and savoir-faire; and though, for his father’s and
grand?father’s sake, he was allowed to register at the Ministry and receive regular
payments of grain and money, everything else was looked after for him by the clerks
and factors of the family business.
Xue Pan’s widowed mother was a younger half-sister of Wang Zi-teng, at that time
Commandant of the Metropolitan Barracks, and younger sister of Lady Wang, the
wife of Jia Zheng of the Rong mansion. She was now around fifty and had only the
one son. Besides Xue Pan she had a daughter two years his junior called Bao-chai, a
girl of flawless looks and great natural refinement. While her father was still alive she
had been his favourite and had been taught to read and write and construe—all of
which she did ten times better than her oafish brother; but when he died and her
brother proved incapable of offering their mother any comfort, she laid aside her
books and devoted herself to needlework and housewifely duties in order to take
some of the burden off her mother’s shoulders.
The well-known interest always shown by our present sovereign in literature and the
arts, and the widespread re?cruitment of talent that this has stimulated, had recently,
at the time of which we speak, led to an unprecedented act of Imperial grace
whereby daughters of hereditary officials and distinguished families, apart from the
possibility of being recruited to the Imperial seraglio by the customary pro?cedures,
were permitted to have their names sent in to the Ministry for selection as
study-companions, with the rank and title of Maid of Honour or Lady-in-waiting, of
the Imperial princesses and the daughters of princes of the blood.
This circumstance, coupled with the fact that, since the death of his father, the
managers, clerks, and factors of the family business in its various agencies
throughout the pro?vinces had profited from Xue Pan’s youth and ignorance of affairs
to feather their own nests at the firm’s expense, and even the family’s enterprises in
the capital, of which there were several, had shown a gradual falling-off, provided
Xue Pan, who had long heard of the rich pleasures of the metropolis and was agog to
taste them, with excuses for realizing his cherished ambition, viz:
1.They must go to the capital because he had to present his sister to the Ministry for
selection.
2. They must go to the capital to look up their kinsfolk there.
3. They must go to the capital so that he might clear his accounts with the Ministry
and take receipt of a new install?ment of funds.
(Needless to say, the sole substantial reason for going to the capital, Xue Pan’s desire
to see the sights, was unexpressed.)
Accordingly, their baggage had long been packed and souvenirs of Nanking for their
friends and relations in the capital long been selected and a date for their departure
long been decided on, when Xue Pan encountered the kidnapper and Ying-lian and,
as Ying-lian was an uncommonly attractive slave-girl, resolved to purchase her and
make her his concu?bine.
Then Feng and his servants came to seize the girl and Xue Pan, confident in his
superior forces, shouted the command to his attendant roughs which was to have
such fatal con?sequences for poor Feng Yuan.
Entrusting everything to his clansmen and a few old and trusty retainers, he then
proceeded to depart according to schedule, in company with his mother and sister,
on the long journey to the capital, accounting the charge of manslaughter a mere
bagatelle which the expenditure of a certain amount of coin could confidently be
expected to resolve.
Of the journey our story gives no record, except to say that on the last day, when
they were about to enter the capital, they heard news that Xue Pan’s uncle Wang
Zi-teng had just been promoted C.-in-C. Northern Provinces with instructions to leave
the capital on a tour of frontier inspection. The news secretly delighted Xue Pan.
‘Just as I was worrying about Uncle cramping my style when we got to the capital
and preventing me from having a really good fling,’ he reflected, ‘the old boy
obligingly gets himself popped out of the way. Fortune is on my side!’
He then proceeded to reason as follows with his mother:
‘We’ve got several houses in the capital, but it’s all of ten years since anyone has
been to stay in them, so you can bet that the housekeepers will have let all the
rooms out on the sly. We shall have to send someone on ahead to get things
straightened out for us.’
‘Whyever should we go to any such trouble?’ said his mother. ‘I thought the main
purpose of our coming here in the first place was to see our relations. There must be
lots and lots of spare room at your Uncle Wang’s and at your Uncle Jia’s place. Surely
it would be much more sensible to stay with one of them first? There will be plenty
of time to send our people to get a place of our own ready after we are there.’
‘But Uncle’s just been promoted to the Northern Provinces,’ Xue Pan expostulated.
‘They will all be making frantic prepara?tions for him to go. What sort of stupid idiots
shall we look like if we come scooting along with all our bag and baggage just at the
very moment when he wants to leave?’
‘Suppose your Uncle Wang has been promoted to another place,’ said his mother.
‘There is still your Uncle Jia. Besides, Uncle Wang and Auntie Jia have for years been
sending us letters inviting us to come and stay with them. Now that we are here,
even though Uncle Wang is busy getting ready to go, Auntie Jia will probably be only
too glad to have us. I’m sure she would be most offended if we were to go rushing off
to get our own house ready.
‘But I know perfectly well what’s in your mind. You think that if we are staying with
your uncle or aunt you will be too restricted, and that if we were living in our own
place you would be freer to do just as you liked. Very well then. Why don’t you go off
and choose a house for yourself to live in and let me and your sister go to Auntie’s
without you? I haven’t seen her or the girls for years and years, and I intend to spend
a few days with them now we are here.’
Experience taught Xue Pan that his mother was in an obstinate mood and not to be
shaken from her purpose, so he resignedly gave orders to the porters to make
straight for the Rong mansion.

Lady Wang had just breathed a sigh of relief on learning that the affair of Xue Pan’s
manslaughter charge had been retrieved through the good offices of Jia Yu-cun,
when the news that her elder brother had been promoted to a frontier post plunged
her once more in gloom at the prospect of losing her main source of contact with the
members of her own family. Several days passed in despondency, and then suddenly
the servants announced that her sister, bringing her son and daughter and all her
household with her, had arrived in the capital and was at that very moment outside
the gate dismount?ing from her carriage.
Delightedly she hurried with her women to the entrance of the main reception hall
and conducted Aunt Xue and her party inside. The sudden reunion of the two sisters
was, it goes with?out saying, an affecting one in which joy and sorrow mingled. After
an exchange of information about the years of separa?tion, and after they had been
taken to see Grandmother Jia and made their reverence to her, and after the gifts of
Nanking produce had been presented and everyone had been introduced to
everyone else, there was a family party to welcome the new arrivals.
Xue Pan, meanwhile, had paid his respects to Jia Zheng and Jia Lian and been taken
to see Jia She and Cousin Zhen. Jia Zheng now sent a servant round to Lady Wang
with the follow?ing message:
‘Your sister is getting on in years and our nephew is very young and seems rather
inexperienced and, I fear, quite capable of getting into a scrape again if they are going
to live outside. Pear Tree Court in the north-east corner of our property is lying
completely unoccupied at the moment and has quite a sizeable amount of room in it.
Why not invite your sister and her children to move in there?’
Lady Wang had wanted all along to ask her sister to stay. Grandmother Jia had sent
someone round to tell her that she should ‘ask Mrs Xue to stay with us here, so that
we can all be close to one another.’ And Aunt Xue for her own part had been wanting
to stay so that some sort of check could be kept on her son. She was sure that if they
were to be on their own somewhere else in the city his unbridled nature would
precipitate some fresh calamity. She therefore accepted the in?vitation with alacrity,
privately adding the proviso that she could only contemplate a long stay if it was on
the understanding that they were themselves to be responsible for all their expenses.
Lady Wang knew that money was no problem to them, so she readily consented, and
Aunt Xue and her children proceeded there and then to move into Pear Tree Court.
This Pear Tree Court had been the Duke of Rong-guo’s retreat during the last years of
his life. Its buildings totalled not much more than ten frames; but though small and
charm?ing, it was complete in every respect, with a little reception room in the front
and all the usual rooms and offices behind. It had its own outer door on to the street,
through which Xue Pan and the menservants could come and go, and another gate in
the south-west corner giving on to a passage-way which led into the courtyard east
of Lady Wang’s compound.
Through this passage-way Aunt Xue would now daily repair, either after dinner or in
the evening, to gossip with Grandmother Jia or reminisce with her sister, Lady Wang.
Bao-chai for her part spent her time each day in great con?tentment, reading or
playing Go or sewing with Dai-yu and the three girls.
The only dissatisfied member of the party - to begin with, at any rate—was Xue Pan.
He had not wanted to stay in the Jia household, fearing that his uncle’s control would
prevent him from enjoying himself, but what with his mother’s obstinacy and the
insistence of the Jias themselves, he was obliged to acquiesce in settling there for the
time being, contenting himself with sending some of his people to clean up one of
their houses outside so that he would be able to move there later on.
But, to his pleasant surprise, he discovered that the young males of the Jia
establishment, half of whom he was already on familiar terms with before he had
been there a month, were of the same idle, extravagant persuasion as himself and
thought him a capital fellow and boon companion. And so he found himself meeting
them for a drinking-party one day, for theatre-going the next, on a third day perhaps
gambling with them or visiting brothels. For there were no limits to the depravity of
their pleasures, and Xue Pan, who was bad enough to start with, soon became ten
times worse under their expert guidance.
It was not that Jia Zheng was a slack disciplinarian, incapable of keeping his house in
order; but the clan was so numerous that he simply could not keep an eye on
everyone at once. And in any case the nominal head of the family was not Jia Zheng
but Cousin Zhen who, as eldest grandson of the senior, Ning-guo branch, had
inherited the founder’s office and emoluments and was therefore officially in charge
of all the clan’s affairs.
Besides, Jia Zheng was kept busy with public and private business of his own and,
being by nature a quiet, retiring man who attached little importance to mundane
affairs, tended to use whatever leisure time he had for reading and playing Go.
Then again, the Pear Tree Court was two courtyards away from Jia Zheng’s compound
and had its own private door onto the street by which Xue Pan could come and go as
he pleased, so that he and his young cronies could enjoy themselves to their heart’s
content with no one being any the wiser.
Under these agreeable Circumstances Xue Pan gradually abandoned all thought of
moving out.
But as to the outcome of these capers: that will be told in a later chapter.




CHAPTER 5

Jia Bao-yu visits the Land of Illusion
And the fairy Disenchantment performs the
‘Dream of Golden Days’
From the moment Lin Dai-yu entered the Rong mansion, Grandmother Jia’s solicitude
for her had manifested itself in a hundred different ways. The arrangements made for
her meals and accommodation were exactly the same as for Bao-yu. The other three
granddaughters, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi?-chun, were relegated to a secondary
place in the old lady’s affections, and the objects of her partiality themselves began
to feel an affection for each other which far exceeded what they felt for any of the
rest. Sharing each other’s company every minute of the day and sleeping in the same
room at night, they developed an understanding so intense that it was almost as if
they had grown into a single person.
And now suddenly this Xue Bao-chai had appeared on the scene—a young lady who,
though very little older than Dai-yu, possessed a grown-up beauty and aplomb in
which all agreed Dai-yu was her inferior. Moreover, in contrast to Dai-yu with her alt
of lofty self-sufficiency and total obliviousness to all who did not move on the same
exalted level as herself, Bao-chai had a generous, accommodating disposition which
greatly endeared her to subordinates, so that even the tiniest maid looked on Miss
Bao-chai as a familiar friend. Dai-yu could not but feel somewhat put out by this—a
fact of which Bao-chai herself, however, was totally unaware.
As for Bao-yu, he was still only a child—a child, moreover, whom nature had
endowed with the eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. Brothers, sisters, cousins,
were all one to him. In his relationships with people he made no distinction between
one person and another. If his relationship with Dai-yu was exceptional, it was
because greater proximity—since she was living with him in his grandmother’s
quarters—made her more familiar to him than the rest; and greater familiarity bred
greater intimacy.
And of course, with greater intimacy came the occasional tiffs and misunderstandings
that are usual with people who have a great deal to do with each other.
One day the two of them had fallen out over something or other and the argument
had ended with Dai-yu crying alone in her room and Bao-yu feeling remorsefully that
perhaps he had spoken too roughly. Presently he went in to make his peace with her
and gradually, very gradually, Dai-yu’s equani?mity was restored.
The Winter plum in the gardens of the Ning Mansion was now at its best, and this
particular day Cousin Zhen’s wife, You-shi, had some wine taken into the gardens and
came over in person, bringing her son Jia Rong and his young wife with her, to invite
Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing and Lady Wang to a flower-viewing party.
Grandmother Jia and the rest went round as soon as they had finished their breakfast.
The party was in the All-scents Garden. It began with tea and continued with Wine,
and as it was a family gathering confined to the ladies of the Ning and Rong
households, nothing particularly worth recording took place.
At one point in the party Bao-yu was overcome with tiredness and heaviness and
expressed a desire to take an afternoon nap. Grandmother Jia ordered some of the
servants to go back to the house with him and get him comfortably settled, adding
that they might return with him later when he was rested; but Qin-shi, the little wife
of Jia Rong, smilingly proposed an alternative.
‘We have got just the room here for Uncle Bao. Leave him to me, Grannie dear! He
will be quite safe in my hands.’
She turned to address the nurses and maidservants who were in attendance on
Bao-yu.
‘Come, my dears! Tell Uncle Bao to follow me.’
Grandmother Jia had always had a high opinion of Qin-shi’s trustworthiness—she
was such a charming, delightful little creature, the favourite among her
great-granddaughters-in-law—and was quite content to leave the arrangements to
her.
Qin-shi conducted Bao-yu and his little knot of attendants to an inner room in the
main building. As they entered, Bao-yu glanced up and saw a painting hanging above
them on the opposite wall. The figures in it were very finely executed. They
represented Scholarly Diligence in the person of the Han philosopher Liu Xiang at his
book, obligingly illuminated for him by a supernatural being holding a large flaming
torch. Bao-yu found the painting—or rather its subject—distasteful. But the pair of
mottoes which flanked it proved the last straw:
True learning implies a clear insight into human activities.
Genuine culture involves the skilful manipulation of human rela?tionships.
In vain the elegant beauty and splendid furnishings of the room! Qin-shi was given to
understand in no uncertain terms that her uncle Bao-yu wished to be out of it at
once.
‘If this is not good enough for you,’ said Qin-shi with a laugh, ‘where are we going
to put you? — unless you would like to have your rest in my bedroom.’
A little smile played over Bao-yu’s face and he nodded. The nurses were shocked.
‘An uncle sleep in the bedroom of his nephew’s wife! Who ever heard of such a
thing!’
Qin-shi laughed again.
‘He won’t misbehave. Good gracious, he’s only a little boy! We don’t have to worry
about that sort of thing yet! You know my little brother who came last month: he’s
the same age as Uncle Bao, but if you stood them side by side I shouldn’t be a bit
surprised if he wasn’t the taller of the two.’
‘Why haven’t I seen your brother yet?’ Bao-yu demanded. ‘Bring him in and let me
have a look at him!’
The servants all laughed.
‘Bring him in? Why, he’s ten or twenty miles away! But I expect you’ll meet him one
of these days.’
In the course of this exchange the party had made its way to Qin-shi’s bedroom. As
Bao-yu entered, a subtle whiff of the most delicious perfume assailed his nostrils,
making a sweet stickiness inside his drooping eyelids and causing all the joints in his
body to dissolve.
‘What a lovely smell!’
He repeated the words several times over.
Inside the room there was a painting by Tang Yin entitled ‘Spring Slumber’ depicting
a beautiful woman asleep under a crab-apple tree, whose buds had not yet opened.
The painting was flanked on either side by a pair of calligraphic scrolls inscribed with
a couplet from the brush of the Song poet Qin Guan:
(on one side)
The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream;
(on the other side)

The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents.

On a table stood an antique mirror that had once graced the tiring-room of the
lascivious empress Wu Ze-tian. Beside it stood the golden platter on which Flying
Swallow once danced for her emperor’s delight. And on the platter was that very
quince which the villainous An Lu-shan threw at beauti?ful Yang Gui-fei, bruising her
plump white breast. At the far end of the room stood the priceless bed on which
Princess Shou-yang was sleeping out of doors under the eaves of the Han-zhang
Palace when the plum-flower lighted on her fore?head and set a new fashion for
coloured patches. Over it hung a canopy commissioned by Princess Tong-chang
entirely fashioned out of ropes of pearls.
‘I like it here,’ said Bao-yu happily.
‘My room,’ said Qin-shi with a proud smile, ‘is lit for an immortal to sleep in.’ And
she unfolded a quilted coverlet, whose silk had been laundered by the fabulous Xi Shi,
and arranged the double head-rest that Hong-niang once carried for her amorous
mistress,
The nurses now helped Bao-yu into bed and then tiptoed out, leaving him attended
only by his four young maids: Aroma, Skybright, Musk, and Ripple. Qin-shi told them
to go outside and stop the cats from lighting on the eaves.
As soon as Bao-yu closed his eyes he sank into a confused sleep in which Qin-shi was
still there yet at the same time seemed to be drifting along weightlessly in front of
him. He followed her until they came to a place of marble terraces and vermilion
balustrades where there were green trees and crystal streams. Everything in this
place was so clean and so pure that it seemed as if no human foot could ever have
trodden there or floating speck of dust ever blown into it. Bao-yu’s dreaming self
rejoiced. ‘What a delightful place!’ he thought. ‘If only I could spend all my life here!
How much nicer it would be than living under the daily restraint of my parents and
teachers!’
These idle reflections were interrupted by someone singing a song on the other side
of a hill:
‘Spring’s dream-time will like drifting clouds disperse,
Its flowers snatched by a flood none can reverse.
Then tell each nymph and swain
‘Tis folly to invite love’s pain!’

It was the voice of a girl. Before its last echoes had died away, a beautiful woman
appeared in the quarter from which the voice had come, approaching him with a
floating, fluttering motion. She was quite unlike any earthly lady, as the following
poem will make clear:

She has left her willow-tree house, from her blossoming bower stepped out;
For the birds betray where she walks through the trees that cluster about,
And a shadow athwart the winding walk announces that she is near,
And a fragrance of musk and orchid from fluttering fairy sleeves,
And a tinkle of girdle-gems that falls on the ear
At each movement of her dress of lotus leaves.
A peach-tree blossoms in her dimpling cheek;
Her cloud-coiled tresses are halcyon-sleek;
And she reveals, through parted cherry lips,
Teeth like pomegranate pips.
Her slim waist’s sinuous swaying calls to mind
The dance of snowflakes with the waltzing wind;
Hair ornaments of pearl and halcyon blue
Outshine her painted forehead’s golden hue.
Her face, through blossoms fleetingly disclosed,
To mirth or ire seems equally disposed;
And as by the waterside she goes,
Hovering on light-stepping toes,
A half-incipient look of pique
Says she would speak, yet would not speak;
While her feet, with the same irresolution,
Would halt, yet would not interrupt their motion.
I contemplate her rate complexion,
Ice-pure and lade-like in perfection;
I marvel at her glittering dress,
Where art lends grace to sumptuousness;
I wonder at her fine-cut featured—
Marble, which fragrance marks as one with living creatures;
And I admire her queenly gait,
Like stately dance of simurgh with his mate.
Her purity I can best show
In plum-trees flowering in the snow;
Her chastity I shall recall
In orchids white at first frost-fall;
Her tranquil nature will prevail,
Constant as lone pine in an empty vale;
Her loveliness as dazzled make
As sunset gilding a pellucid lake;
Her glittering elegance I can compare
With dragons in an ornamental mere;
Her dreamy soulfulness most seems
Like wintry waters in the moon’s cold beams.
The beauties of days gone by by her beauty are all abashed.
Where was she born, and from whence descended?
Immortal I judge her, fresh come from fairy feastings by the Jasper Pool,
Or from fluting in starry balls, some heavenly concert ended.

Observing delightedly that the lady was a fairy, Bao-yu hurried forward and saluted
her with a smile.
‘Madam Fairy, I don’t know where you have come from or where you are going to,
but as I am quite lost in this place, will you please take me with you and be my
guide?’
‘I am the fairy Disenchantment,’ the fairy woman replied. ‘I live beyond the Realm
of Separation, in the Sea Of Sadness. There is a Mountain of Spring Awakening which
rises from the midst of that sea, and on that mountain is the Paradise of the
Full-blown Flower, and in that paradise is the Land of Illusion, which is my home. My
business is with the romantic passions, love-debts, girlish heartbreaks and male
philanderings of your dust-stained, human world. The reason I have come here today
is that recently there has been a heavy concen?tration of love-karma in this area, and
I hope to be able to find an opportunity of distributing a quantity of a amorous
thoughts by implanting them in the appropriate breasts. My meeting you here today
is no accident but a part of the same project.
‘This place where we are now is not so very far from my home. I have not much to
offer you, but would you like to come back with me and let me try to entertain you? I
have some fairy tea, which I picked myself. You could have a cup of that. And I have a
few jars of choice new wine of my own brewing. I have also been rehearsing a fairy
choir and a troupe of fairy dancers in a twelve-part suite which I recently com?posed
called “2222A Dream of Golden Days”. I could get them to perform it for you. What
do you think?’
Bao-yu was so excited by this invitation that he quite forgot to wonder what had
become of Qin-shi in his eagerness to accompany the fairy. As he followed her, a big
stone arch?way suddenly loomed up in front of them on which

THE LAND OF ILLUSION

was Written in large characters. A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed on
either side of the arch:

        Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true;
        Real becomes not-real when the unreal’s real.

Having negotiated the archway, they presently came to the gateway of a palace. The
following words were inscribed horizontally above the lintel:

SEAS OF PAIN AND SKIES OF PASSION

whilst the following words were inscribed vertically on the two sides:
         Ancient earth and sky
                Marvel that love’s passion should outlast all time.
                   Star-crossed men and maids
                Groan that love’s debts should be so hard to pay.


‘I see,’ said Bao-yu to himself. ‘I wonder what the meaning of “passion that outlasts
all time” can be. And what are “love’s debts”? From now on I must make an effort to
understand these things.’
He could not, of course, have known it, but merely by thinking this he had invited the
attentions of the demon Lust, and at that very moment a little of the demon’s evil
poison had entered Bao-yu’s body and lodged itself in the innermost recesses of his
heart.
Wholly unconscious of his mortal peril, Bao-yu continued to follow the fairy woman.
They passed through a second gateway, and Bao-yu saw a range of palace buildings
ahead of them on either hand. The entrance to each building had a board above it
proclaiming its name, and there were couplets on either side of the doorways.
Bao-yu did not have time to read all of the names, but he managed to make out a few,
viz:

DEPARTMENT OF FOND INFATUATION
DEPARTMENT OF CRUEL REJECTION
DEPARTMENT OF EARLY MORNING WEEPING
DEPARTMENT OP LATE NIGHT SOBBING
DEPARTMENT OF SPRING FEVER
DEPARTMENT OF AUTUMN GRIEF



‘Madam Fairy,’ said Bao-yu, whose interest had been whetted by what he had
managed to read, ‘couldn’t you take me inside these offices to have a look around?’
‘In these offices,’ said the fairy woman, ‘are kept registers in which are recorded the
past, present and future of girls from all over the world. It is not permitted that your
earthly eyes should look on things that are yet to come.’
Bao-yu was most unwilling to accept this answer, and begged and pleaded so
persistently that at last Disenchantment gave in.
‘Very well. You may make a very brief inspection of this office here.’
Delighted beyond measure, Bao-yu raised his head and read the notice above the
doorway:

DEPARTMENT OP THE ILL-FATED FAIR

The couplet inscribed vertically on either side of the doorway was as follows:

        Spring grieves and autumn sorrows were by yourselves provoked.
        Flower faces, moonlike beauty were to what end disclosed?

Bao-yu grasped enough of the meaning to be affected by its melancholy.
Passing inside, he saw a dozen or more large cupboards with paper strips pasted on
their doors on which were written the names of different provinces. He was careful
to look out for the one belonging to his own area and presently found one on which
the paper strip said ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Main Register’. Bao-yu asked
Disenchantment what this meant, and she explained that it was a register of the
twelve most out-standing girls of his home province.
‘People all say what a big place Jinling is,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Surely there should be more
than just twelve names? Why, even in my own home, if you count the servants, there
must be altogether several hundred girls.’
‘Certainly there area great many girls in the whole province,’ said Disenchantment
with a smile, ‘but only the most im?portant ones have been selected for recording in
this register. The registers in the cupboards on either side contain two other
selections from the same area. But of the host of ordinary girls outside those three
dozen we keep no records.’
Bao-yu glanced at the other two cupboards referred to by Disenchantment. One was
labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.1’; the other was
labelled ‘Jinling, Twelve Beauties of; Supplementary Register No.2’. Stretching out his
hand he opened the door of the second one, took out Supplementary Register No.2,
which was like a large album, and opened it at the first page.
It was a picture, but not of a person or a view.⒈The whole page was covered with
dark ink washes representing storm-clouds or fog, followed on the next page by a
few lines of verse:

                 Seldom the moon shines in a cloudless sky,
                 And days of brightness all too soon pass by.
        A noble and aspiring mind
        In a base-born frame confined,
        Your charm and wit did only hatred gain,
        And in the end you were by slanders slain,
        Your gentle lord’s solicitude in vain.

Bao-yu could not make much sense of this, and turned to the next page. It was
another picture, this time of a bunch of fresh flowers and a worn-out mat, again
followed by a few limes of verse.

        What price your kindness and compliance,
                  1.See Appendix, p.527.
        Of sweetest flower the rich perfume?
        You chose the player fortune favoured,
        Unmindful of your master’s doom.

Bao-yu was even more mystified by this than by the first page, and laying the album
aside, opened the door of the cupboard marked ‘Supplementary Register No. I’ and
took out the album from that.
As in the previous album, the first page was a picture. It represented a branch of
cassia with a pool underneath. The water in the pool had dried up and the mud in
the bottom was dry and cracked. Growing from it was a withered and broken lotus
plant. The picture was followed by these lines:

        Your stem grew from a noble lotus root,
        Yet your life passed, poor flower, in low repute.
        The day two earths shall bear a single tree,
        Your soul must fly home to its own country.

Once more failing to make any sense of what he saw, Bao-yu picked up the Main
Register to look at. In this album the picture on the first page represented two dead
trees with a jade belt hanging in their branches and on the ground beneath them a
pile of snow in which a golden hairpin lay half-buried. This was followed by a
quatrain:

        One was a pattern of female virtue,
        One a wit who made other wits seem slow.
              The jade belt in the greenwood hangs,
              The gold pin is buried beneath the snow.
Still Bao-yu was unable to understand the meaning. He would have liked to ask, but
he knew that Disenchantment would be unwilling to divulge the secrets of her
immortal world. Yet though he could make no sense of the book, for some reason he
found himself unable this time to lay it down, and continued to look through it to the
end.
The picture that followed was of a bow with a citron hanging from it, followed by
what looked like the words of a song:

You shall, when twenty years in life’s hard school are done,
In pomegranate-time to palace halls ascend.
Though three springs never could with your first spring compare,
When hare meets tiger your great dream shall end.
Next was a picture of two people flying a kite. There was also a large expanse of sea
with a boat in it and a girl in the boat who had buried her face in her hands and
appeared to be crying. This was followed by a quatrain:

Blessed with a shrewd mind and a noble heart,
    Yet born in time of twilight and decay,
    In spring through tears at river’s bank you gaze,
    Borne by the wind a thousand miles away.
The next picture showed some scudding wisps of cloud and a stretch of running
water followed by these words:

        What shall avail you rank and riches,
        Orphaned while yet in swaddling bands you lay?
        Soon you must mourn your bright sun’s early setting.
        The Xiang flows and the Chu clouds sail away.

Next was a picture showing a beautiful jade which had fallen into the mud, followed
by words of judgement:

        For all your would-be spotlessness
        And vaunted otherworldliness,
        You that look down on common flesh and blood,
        Yourself impure, shall end up in the mud.

Next was a striking picture of a savage wolf pursuing a beautiful girl. He had just
seized her with his jaws and appeared to be about to eat her. Underneath it was
written:

         Paired with a brute like the wolf in the old fable,
         Who on his saviour turned when he was able,
         To cruelty not used, your gentle heart
         Shall, in a twelvemonth only, break apart.
After this was an old temple with a beautiful girl sitting all on her own inside it
reading a Buddhist sutra. The words said:

        When you see through the spring scene’s transient state,
        A nun’s black habit shall replace your own.
        Alas, that daughter of so great a house
        By Buddha’s altar lamp should sleep alone!

Next was an iceberg with a hen phoenix perched on the top of it, and these words:

    This phoenix in a bad time came;
    All praised her great ability.
    ‘Two’ makes my riddle with a man and tree:
    Returning south in tears she met calamity.

Next was a cottage in a deserted village inside which a beautiful girl sat spinning,
followed by these words:

    When power is lost, rank matters not a jot;
    When families fall, kinship must be forgot.
    Through a chance kindness to a country wife
    Deliverance came for your afflicted life.

This was followed by a picture of a vigorously growing orchid in a pot, beside which
stood a lady in full court dress. The words said:

    The plum-tree bore her fruit after the rest,
    Yet, when all’s done, her Orchid was the best.
    Against your ice-pure nature all in vain
    The tongues of envy wagged; you felt no pain.

The picture after that showed an upper room in a tail build?ing in which a beautiful
girl was hanging by her neck from a beam, having apparently taken her own life. The
words said:

    Love was her sea, her sky; in such excess
    Love, meeting with its like, breeds wantonness.
    Say not our troubles all from Rong’s side came;
    For their beginning Ning must take the blame.

Bao-yu would have liked to see some more, but the fairy woman, knowing how
intelligent and sharp-witted he was, began to fear that she was in danger of
becoming responsible for a leakage of celestial secrets, and so, snapping the album
shut, she said with a laugh, ‘Come with me and we will do some more sight-seeing.
Why stay here puzzling your head over these silly riddles?’
Next moment, without quite knowing how it happened, Bao-yu found that he had
left the place of registers behind him and was following Disenchantment through the
rear parts of the palace. Everywhere there were buildings with ornately carved and
painted eaves and rafters, their doorways curtained with strings of pearls and their
interiors draped with em?broidered hangings. The courtyards outside them were full
of deliciously fragrant fairy blooms and rare aromatic herbs.

        Gleam of gold pavement flashed on scarlet doors,
        And in jade walls jewelled casements snow white shone.


‘ Hurry, hurry! Come out and welcome the honoured guest!’ he heard
Disenchantment calling to someone inside, and almost at once a bevy of fairy
maidens came running from the palace, lotus-sleeves fluttering and feather-skirts
billowing, each as enchantingly beautiful as the flowers of spring or the autumn
moon. Seeing Bao-yu, they began to reproach Dis?enchantment angrily.
‘So this is your “honoured guest”! What do you mean by making us hurry out to
meet him? You told us that today at this very hour the dream-soul of our darling
Crimson Pearl was coming to play with us, and we have been waiting I don’t know
how long for her arrival. And now, instead, you have brought this disgusting creature
to pollute our pure, maidenly precincts. What’s the idea ?’
At these words Bao-yu was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of the uncleanness
and impurity of his own body and sought in vain for somewhere to escape to; but
Disenchant?ment held him by the hand and advanced towards the fairy maidens
with a conciliatory smile.
‘Let me tell you the reason for my change of plan. It is true that I set off for the
Rong mansion with the intention of fetch?ing Crimson Pearl, but as I was passing
through the Ning mansion on my way, I happened to run into the Duke of Ning?-guo
and his brother the Duke of Rong-guo and they laid a solemn charge on me which I
found it hard to refuse.
‘“In the hundred years since the foundation of the present dynasty,” they said,
“several generations of our house have distinguished themselves by their services to
the Throne and have covered themselves with riches and honours; but now its stock
of good fortune has run out, and nothing can be done to replenish it. And though our
descendants are many, not one of them is worthy to carry on the line. The only
possible exception, our great-grandson Bao-yu, has inherited a perverse, intractable
nature and is eccentric and emotionally unstable; and although his natural brightness
and intelligence augur well, we fear that owing to the fated eclipse of our family’s
fortunes there will be no one at hand to give the lad proper guidance and to start
him off along the right lines.
‘“May we profit from the fortunate accident of this en?counter, Madam, to entreat
you to take the boy in hand for us? Could you perhaps initiate him in the pleasures of
the flesh and all that sort of thing in such a way as to shock the silli?ness out of him?
In that way he might stand a chance of escaping some of the traps that people fall
into and be able to devote himself single-mindedly to the serious things of life. It
would be such a kindness if you would do this for us.”
‘Hearing the old gentlemen so earnest in their entreaty, I was moved to compassion
and agreed to bring the boy here. I began by letting him have a good look at the
records of the three grades of girls belonging to his own household; but the
experience did not bring any awareness; and so I have brought him to this place for
another attempt. It is my hope that a full exposure to the illusions of feasting,
drinking, music and dancing may succeed in bringing about an awakening in him
some time in the future.’
Having concluded her explanation, she led Bao-yu indoors. At once he became aware
of a faint, subtle scent, the source of which he was quite unable to identify and about
which he felt impelled to question Disenchantment.
‘ How could you possibly know what it was,’ said Dis?enchantment with a
somewhat scornful smile, ‘since this per?fume is not to be found anywhere in your
mortal world? It is made from the essences of rare plants found on famous
mountains and other places of great natural beauty, culled when they are new-grown
and blended with gums from the pearl-laden trees that grow in the jewelled groves
of paradise. It is called “Belles Se Fanent”.’
Bao-yu expressed his admiration.
The company now seated themselves, and some little maids served them with tea.
Bao-yu found its fragrance fresh and clean and its flavour delicious, totally unlike
those of any earthly blend he knew. He asked Disenchantment for the name.
‘The leaves are picked in the Paradise of the Full-blown Flower on the Mountain of
Spring Awakening,’ Disenchant?ment informed him. ‘It is infused in water collected
from the dew that lies on fairy flowers and leaves. The name is “Maiden’s Tears”.’
Bao-yu nodded attentively and commended the tea.
Looking around the room he noticed various musical instruments, antique bronzes,
paintings by old masters, poems by new poets, and other hallmarks of gracious living.
He was particularly delighted to observe some rouge-stained pieces of cotton-wool
lying on the indow-sill—evidently the after?math of some fairy-woman’s toilet. A pair
of calligraphic scrolls hung on the wall, making up the following couplet:
    Earth’s choicest spirits in the dark lie hid:
    Heaven ineluctably enforced their fate.

After reading the scrolls, Bao-yu asked to be introduced to the fairy maidens. They
had a strange assortment of names. One was called Dream-of-bliss, another was
called Loving-heart, a third Ask-for-trouble, a fourth Past-regrets, and the rest all had
names that were equally bizarre.
Presently the little maids came in again and proceeded to arrange some chairs
around a table and to lay it with food and wine for a feast. In the words of the poet,
Celestial nectar filled the crystal cup,
And liquid gold in amber goblets glowed.
The wine’s bouquet was delectable, and once again Bao-yu could not resist asking
about it.
‘This wine,’ said Disenchantment, ‘is made from the petals of hundreds of different
kinds of flowers and extracts from thousands of different sorts of trees. These are
blended and fermented with kylin’s marrow and phoenix milk. Hence its name,
“Lachrymae Rerum”’
Bao-yu praised it enthusiastically.
As they sat drinking wine, a troupe of twelve dancers entered and inquired what
pieces they should perform for the company’s entertainment.
‘You can do the twelve songs of my new song-and-dance suite “A Dream of Golden
Days”,’ said Disenchantment.
At once the sandalwood clappers began, very softly, to beat out a rhythm,
accompanied by the sedate twang of the Zheng’s silver strings and by the voice of a
singer.

    ‘When first the world from chaos rose…’

The singer had got no further than the first line of the first song when
Disenchantment interrupted.
‘This suite,’ she told Bao-yu, ‘is not like the music-dramas of your earthly
composers in which there are always the fixed parts of sheng, dan, jing, mo and so on,
and set tunes in the various Northern and Southern modes. In my suite each song is
an elegy on a single person or event and the tunes are original compositions which
we have orchestrated ourselves. You need to know what the songs are about in order
to appreciate them properly. I should not imagine you are very familiar with this sort
of entertainment; so unless you read the libretto of the songs first before listening to
them, I fear you may find them rather insipid.’
Turning to one of the maids, she ordered her to fetch the manuscript of her libretto
of ‘A Dream of Golden Days’ and gave it to Bao-yu to read, so that he could listen to
the songs with one eye on the text. These were the words in Dis?enchantment’s
manuscript:

    Prelude: A Dream of Go/den Days2

     When first the world from chaos rose,
     Tell me, how did love begin?
     The wind and moonlight first did love compose.
Now woebegone
And quite cast down
In low estate
I would my foolish heart expose,
And so perform
     This Dream of Golden Days,
And all my grief for my lost loves disclose.

First Song: The Mistaken Marriage

Let others all
Commend the marriage rites of gold and jade;
I still recall
The bond of old by stone and flower made;
And while my vacant eyes behold
Crystalline snows of beauty pure and cold,
From my mind can not be banished
That fairy wood forlorn that from the world has vanished.
How true I find
That every good some imperfection bolds!
Even a wife so courteous and so kind
No comfort’ brings to my afflicted mind.

2. See Appedix p.528.
Second Song: Hope Betrayed

One was a flower from paradise,
One a pure jade without spot or stain.
If each for the other one was not intended,
Then why in this life did they meet again?
And yet if fate bad meant them for each other,
Why was their earthly meeting all in vain?
In vain were all her sighs and tears,
In vain were all his anxious fears:
All, insubstantial, doomed to pass,
As moonlight mirrored in the water
Or flowers reflected in a glass.
Row many tears from those poor eyes could flow,
Which every season rained upon her woe?

                       Third Song: Mutability,
In the full flower of her prosperity
Once more came mortal mutability,
Bidding her, with both eyes wide,
All earthly things to cast aside,
And her sweet soul upon the airs to glide.
So far the road back home did seem
     That to her parents in a dream
     Thus she her final duty paid:
     ‘I that now am but a shade,
     Parents dear,
     For your happiness I fear:
    Do not tempt the hand of fate!
    Draw back, draw back, before it is too late!’

  Fourth Song: From Dear Ones Parted

     Sail, boat, a thousand miles through rain and wind,
     Leaving my home and dear ones far behind.
     I fear that my remaining years
     Will waste away in homesick tears.
     Father dear and mother mild,
     Be not troubled for your child!
     From of old our rising, falling
     Was ordained; so now this parting.
       Each in another land must be;
      Each for himself must fend as best he may;
      Now I am gone, oh. do not weep for me!

Fifth Song: Grief Amidst Gladness

While you still in cradle lay,
Both your parents passed away
Though born to silken luxury,
No warmth or kind indulgence came your way.
Yet yours was a generous, open-hearted nature,
And never could be snared or soured
By childish piques and envious passions—
You were a crystal house by wind and moonlight scoured.
Matched to a perfect, gentle husband,
Security of bliss at last it seemed,
And all your childish miseries redeemed.
But soon alas! the clouds of Gao-tang faded,
The waters of the Xiang ran dry.
In our grey world so are things always ordered:
What then avails it to lament and sigh?



Sixth Song: All at Odds

Heaven made you like a flower,
With grace and wit to match the gods,
Adding a strange, contrary nature
That set you with the test at odds.
Nauseous to you the world’s rank diet,
Vulgar its fashion’s gaudy dress:
But the world envies the superior
And hates a too precious daintiness.
Sad it seemed that your life should in dim-lit shrines be wasted,
All the sweets of spring untasted:
Yet, at the last,
Down into mud and shame your hopes were cast,
Like a white, flawless jade dropped in the muck,
Where only wealthy rakes might bless their luck.
Seventh Song: Husband and Enemy

    Zhong-shan wolf,
    Inhuman sot,
    Who for past kindnesses cared not a jot!
    Bully and spendthrift, reckless in debauch,
    For riot or for whoring always hot!
    A delicate young wife of gentle stock
    To you was no more than a lifeless block,
    And bore, when you would rant and rave,
    Treatment fat worse than any slave;
    So that her delicate, sweet soul
    In just a twelvemonth from its body stole.



Eighth Song: The Vanity of Spring

     When triple spring as vanity was seen,
     What use the blushing flowers, the willows green?
     From youth’s extravagance you sought release
     To win chaste quietness and heavenly peace.
     The hymeneal peach-blooms in the sky,
     The flowering almond’s blossoms seen on high
     Dismiss, since none, for sure,
     Can autumn’s blighting frost endure.
     Amidst sad aspens mourners sob and sigh,
     In maple woods the poor ghosts thinly cry,
          And under the dead grasslands lost graves lie.
         Now poor, now rich, men’s lives in toil are passed
         To be, like summer’s pride, cut down at last.
         The doors of life and death all must go through.
         Yet this I know is true:
         In Paradise there grows a precious tree
         Which bears the fruit of immortality.

Ninth Song: Caught By Her Own Cunning
           Too shrewd by half, with such finesse you wrought
           That your own life in your own toils was caught;
           But long before you died your heart was slain,
           And when you died your spirit walked in vain.
    Fall’n the great house once so secure in wealth,
           Each scattered member shifting for himself;
           And half a life-time’s anxious schemes
           Proved no more than the stuff of dreams.
           Like a great building’s tottering crash,
           Like flickering lampwick burned to ash,
           Your scene of happiness concludes in grief:
           For worldly bliss is always insecure and brief.

Tenth Song: The Survivor

            Some good remained,
            Some good remained:
The daughter found a friend in need
            Through her mother’s one good deed.
So let all men the poor and meek sustain,
            And from the example of her cruel kin refrain,
            Who kinship scorned and only thought of gain.
For far above the constellations
            One watches all and makes just calculations.

Eleventh Song: Splendour Come Late

            Favour, a shadow in the glass;
            Fame, a dream that soon would pass:
The blissful flowering-time of youth soon fled,
            Soon, too, the pleasures of the bridal bed.
A pearl-encrusted crown and robes of state
            Could not for death untimely compensate;
And though each man desires
Old age from want made free,
True blessedness requires
A clutch of young heirs at the knee.
Proudly upright
The head with cap and hands of office on,
And gleaming bright
Upon his breast the gold insignia shone.
An awesome sight
To see him so exalted stand! –
Yet the black night
Of death’s dark frontier lay close at hand.
All those whom history calls great
Left only empty names for us to venerate.

Twelfth Song: The Good Things Have An End

Perfumed was the dust that fell
From painted beams where springtime ended.
Her sportive heart
And amorous looks
The ruin of a mighty house portended.
The weakness in the line began with Jing;
The blame for the decline lay first in Ning;
But retribution all was of Love’s fashioning.

Epilogue: The Birds Into The Wood Have Flown

The office jack’s career is blighted,
    The rich man’s fortune now all vanished,
    The kind with life have been requited,
    The cruel exemplarily punished;
    The one who owed a life is dead,
    The tears one owed have all been shed.
    Wrongs suffered have the wrongs done expiated;
    The couplings and the sunderings were fated.
    Untimely death sin in some past life shows,
    But only luck a blest old age bestows.
    The disillusioned to their convents fly,
    The still deluded miserably die.
    Like birds who, having fed, to the woods repair,
    They leave the landscape desolate and bare.
Having reached the end of this suite, the singers showed signs of embarking on
another one. Disenchantment observed with a sigh that Bao-yu was dreadfully
bored.
‘Silly boy! You still don’t understand, do you?,
Bao-yu hurriedly stopped the girls and told them that they need not sing any more.
He felt dizzy and his head was spin?ning. He explained to Disenchantment that he
had drunk too much and would like to lie down.
At once she ordered the remains of the feast to be removed and conducted Bao-yu
to a dainty bedroom. The furnishings and hangings of the bed were more sumptuous
and beautiful than anything he had ever seen. To his intense surprise there was a
fairy girl sitting in the middle of it. Her rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of
Bao-chai, but there was also something about her of Dai-yu’s delicate charm. As he
was pondering the meaning of this apparition, he suddenly became aware that
Disenchantment was addressing him.
‘In the rich and noble households of your mortal world, too many of those bowers
and boudoirs where innocent tenderness and sweet girlish fantasy should reign are
injuriously defiled by coarse young voluptuaries and loose, wanton girls. And what is
even more detestable, there are always any number of worthless philanderers to
protest that it is woman’s beauty alone that inspires them, or loving feelings alone,
unsullied by any taint of lust. They lie in their teeth! To be moved by woman’s beauty
is itself a kind of lust. To experience loving feelings is, even more assuredly, a kind of
lust. Every act of love, every carnal congress of the sexes is brought about precisely
because sensual delight in beauty has kindled the feeling of love.
‘The reason I like you so much is because you are full of lust. You are the most
lustful person I have ever known in the whole world 1’
Bao-yu was scared by the vehemence of her words.
‘Madam Fairy, you are wrong! Because I am lazy over my lessons, Mother and
Father still have to scold me quite often; but surely that doesn’t make me lustful? I’m
still too young to know what they do, the people they use that word about.’
‘Ah, but you are lustful!’ said Disenchantment. ‘In principle, of course, all lust is the
same. But the word has many different meanings. For example, the typically lustful
man in the common sense of the word is a man who likes a pretty face, who is fond
of singing and dancing, who is inordinately given to flirtation; one who makes love in
season and out of season, and who, if he could, would like to have every pretty girl in
the world at his disposal, to gratify his desires whenever he felt like it. Such a person
is a mere brute. His is a shallow, promiscuous kind of lust.
‘But your kind of lust is different. That blind, defenceless love with which nature
has filled your being is what we call here “lust of the mind”. “Lust of the mind”
cannot be ex?plained in words, nor, if it could, would you be able to grasp their
meaning. Either you know what it means or you don’t.
‘Because of this “lust of the mind” women will find you a kind and understanding
friend; but in the eyes of the world I am afraid it is going to make you seem
unpractical and eccentric. It is going to earn you the jeers of many and the angry
looks of many more.
‘Today I received a most touching request on your behalf from your ancestors the
Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo. And as I cannot bear the idea of your
being rejected by the world for the greater glory of us women, I have brought you
here. I have made you drunk with fairy wine. I have drenched you with fairy tea. I
have admonished you with fairy songs. And now I am going to give you my little sister
Two-in-one—”Ke-qing” to her friends—to be your bride.
‘The time is propitious. You may consummate the marriage this very night. My
motive in arranging this is to help you grasp the fact that, ‘since even in these
immortal precincts love is an illusion, the love of your dust-stained, mortal world
must be doubly an illusion. It is my earnest hope that, knowing this, you will
henceforth be able to shake yourself free of its en?tanglements and change your
previous way of thinking, devoting your mind seriously to the teachings of Confucius
and Mencius and your person wholeheartedly to the better?ment of society.’
Disenchantment then proceeded to give him secret instruc?tions in the art of love;
then, pushing him gently inside the room, she closed the door after him and went
away.
Dazed and confused, Bao-yu nevertheless proceeded to follow out the instructions
that Disenchantment had given him, which led him by predictable stages to that act
which boys and girls perform together—and which it is not my inten?tion to give a
full account of here.
Next morning he lay for a long time locked in blissful tenderness with Ke-qing,
murmuring sweet endearments in her ear and unable to tear himself away from her.
Eventually they emerged from the bedroom hand in hand to walk together
out-of-doors.
Their walk seemed to take them quite suddenly to a place where only thorn-trees
grew and wolves and tigers prowled around in pairs. Ahead of them the road ended
at the edge of a dark ravine. No bridge connected it with the other side. As they
hesitated, wondering what to do, they suddenly became aware that Disenchantment
was running up behind them.
‘Stop! Stop!’ she was shouting. ‘Turn back at once! Turn back!’
Bao-yu stood still in alarm and asked her what place this was.
‘This is the Ford of Error,’ said Disenchantment. ‘It is ten thousand fathoms deep
and extends hundreds of miles in either direction. No boat can ever cross it; only a
raft manned by a lay-brother called Numb and an acolyte called Dumb. Numb holds
the steering-paddle and Dumb wields the pole. They won’t ferry anyone across for
money, but only take those who are fated to cross over.
‘If you had gone on walking just now and had fallen in, all the good advice I was at
such pains to give you would have been wasted!’
Even as she spoke there was a rumbling like thunder from inside the abyss and a
multitude of demons and water monsters reached up and clutched at Bao-yu to drag
him down into its depths. In his terror the sweat broke out over his body like rain and
a great cry burst from his lips, ‘Ke-qing! Save me!’
    Aroma and his other maids rushed upstairs in alarm and clung to him.
Don’t be frightened, Bao-yu! We are here!’
But Qin-shi, who was out in the courtyard telling the maids to be sure that the cats
and dogs didn’t fight, marvelled to hear him call her name out in his sleep.
‘“Ke-qing” was the name they called me back at home when I was a little girl.
Nobody here knows it. I wonder how he could have found it out?’
If you have not yet fathomed the answer to her question, you must read the next
chapter.




CHAPTER 6

Jia Bao-yu conducts his first experiment
in the Art of Love
And Grannie Liu makes her first entry into the
Rong-guo mansion
Qin-shi was surprised to hear Bao-yu call out her childhood name in his sleep, but did
not like to pursue the matter. As she stood wondering, Bao-yu, who was still
bemused after his dream and not yet in full possession of his faculties, got out of bed
and began to stretch himself and to adjust his clothes, assisted by Aroma. As she was
doing up his trousers, her hand, chancing to stray over his thigh, came into contact
with some-thing cold and sticky which caused her to draw it back in alarm and ask
him if he was all right. Instead of answering, he merely reddened and gave the hand
a squeeze.
      Aroma had always been an intelligent girl. She was, in any case, a year or two
older than Bao-yu and had recently begun to have some understanding of the facts
of life. Observing the condition that Bao-yu was in, she therefore had more than an
inkling of what had happened. Abandoning her question, she busied herself with his
clothes, her cheeks suffused by a crimson blush of embarrassment. When he was
properly dressed, they went to rejoin Grandmother Jia and the rest. There they
bolted a hurried supper and then slipped back to the other house, where Aroma
profited from the absence of the nurses and the other maids to take out a clean
under?garment for Bao-yu to change into.
      ‘Please, Aroma,’ Bao-yu shamefacedly entreated as she helped him change,
‘please don’t tell anyone !’
Equally ill at ease, Aroma giggled softly.
‘Why did you... ?’ she began to ask. Then, after glancing cautiously around, began
again.
‘Where did that stuff come from?’
     Bao-yu blushed furiously and said nothing. Aroma stared at him curiously and
continued to giggle. After much hesitation he proceeded to give her a detailed
account of his dream. But when he came to the part of it in which he made love to
Two-in-one, Aroma threw herself forward with a shriek of laughter and buried her
face in her hands.
     Bao-yu had long been attracted by Aroma’s somewhat coquettish charms and
tugged at her purposefully, anxious to share with her the lesson he had learned from
Disenchant?ment. Aroma knew that when Grandmother Jia gave her to Bao-yu she
had intended her to belong to him in the fullest possible sense, and so, having no
good reason for refusing him, she allowed him, after a certain amount of coy
resistance, to have his way with her.
    From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before,
whilst Aroma for her part re?doubled the devotion with which she served him. But of
this, for the time being, no more.
*

The inhabitants of the Rong mansion, if we include all of them from the highest to
the humblest in our total, numbered more than three hundred souls, who produced
between them a dozen or more incidents in a single day. Faced with so ex?uberant an
abundance of material, what principle should your chronicler adopt to guide him in
his selection of incidents to record? As we pondered the problem where to begin, it
was suddenly solved for us by the appearance as it were out of nowhere of someone
from a very humble, very insignificant household who, on the strength of a very
tenuous, very remote family connection with the Jias, turned up at the Rong mansion
on the very day of which we are about to write.
     Their name was Wang and they were natives of these parts. A grandfather had
held some very small official post in the capital and had there become acquainted
with Wang Xi-feng’s grandfather, the father of Lady Wang. Conceiving an ad?miration
for the power and prestige of this greater namesake, he had sought to link his family
with the latter’s clan by becoming his adoptive nephew. Only Lady Wang and her
elder brother—Wang Xi-feng’s father—who chanced at that time to be staying with
their parent on his tour of duty at the capital, knew anything about this. The other
members of the clan were unaware that any such relationship existed.
The grandfather had long since died, leaving an only son called Wang Cheng who,
having fallen on hard times, had moved back into the countryside somewhere
outside the capital. Wang Cheng in his turn had died leaving a son called Gou-er, who
had married a girl from a family called Liu and now had two children, a son called
Ban-er and a daughter called Qing-er. The four of them depended on agriculture for
their living, and since, with Gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and his
wife busy about the farm drawing water, pounding grain, and the like, there was no
one to look after Qing-er and her little brother, Gou-er invited his mother-?in-law, old
Grannie Liu, to come and live with them.
This Grannie Liu was an ancient widow-woman, rich in experience of the world, who,
having no son or daughter-in-law to cherish her, eked out her solitary existence by
scratching a livelihood from a miserable half-acre of land. She therefore embraced
her son-in-law’s invitation with alacrity and threw herself enthusiastically into the
business of helping the young couple to make a living.
The season was now at the turn between autumn and winter. The cold weather was
beginning, but none of the preparations for winter had yet been made. By drinking to
allay his anxiety, Gou-er merely put himself more out of temper. He returned home
to vent some of his spleen on his long-suffering wife. Grannie Liu could eventually
stomach no more of his wife-baiting and intervened on her daughter’s behalf.
‘Now look here, son-in-law: probably you will think me an interfering old woman;
but we country folk have to be grate?ful for what is in the pot and cut down our
appetites to the same measure. When you were little your Ma and Pa could afford to
indulge you; so now you’re grown-up you spend all your money as soon as you’ve got
any, without stopping to count the cost; then, when it’s all gone, you start making a
fuss. But what sort of way is that for a grown man to behave?
‘Now where we live may be out in the country, but it’s still “in the Emperor’s
shadow”, as they say. Over there in the city the streets are paved with money just
waiting for someone to go and pick it up. What’s the sense in rampaging around here
at home when you could go out and help your?self?’
‘It’s easy for you to sit on your backside and talk,’ said Gou-er rudely, ‘but what do
you expect me to do? Go out and rob?’
‘No one’s asking you to rob,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But can’t we all sit down peaceably
and think of a way? Because if we don’t, the money isn’t going to come walking in
the door of its own accord.’
Gou-er snorted sarcastically. ‘If there were a way, do you suppose I should have
waited till now before trying it out? There are no tax-collectors in my family and no
mandarins among my friends. What way could there be of laying my hands on some
money? Even if I did have rich friends or relations, I’m not so sure they would want to
be bothered with the likes of us.’
‘I wouldn’t say that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Man proposes, God disposes. It’s up to us to
think of something. We must leave it to the good Lord to decide whether He’ll help
us or not. Who knows, He might give us the opportunity we are looking for.
‘Now I can think of a chance you might try. Your family used to be connected with
the Wang clan of Nanking. Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very
good to you folk. It’s only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to
approach them that they have become more distant with you.
‘I can remember going to their house once with my daughter. The elder Miss Wang
was a very straightforward young lady, very easy to get on with, and not at all high
and mighty. She’s now the wife of the younger of the two Sir Jias in the Rong
mansion. They say that now she’s getting on in years she’s grown even more
charitable and given to good works than she was as a girl. Her brother has been
promoted; but I shouldn’t be surprised if she at least didn’t still remember us. Why
don’t you try your luck with her? You never know, she might do something for you
for the sake of old times. She only has to feel well disposed and a hair off her arm
would be thicker than a man’s waist to poor folks like us’,
     ‘That’s all very well, Mother,’ put in Gou-er’s wife, ‘but just take a look at us!
What sort of state are we in to go calling on great folks like them? I doubt the people
at the door would bother to tell them we were there. Who’s going to all that trouble
just to make a fool of themselves?’
     Gou-er’s cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law,
and his reaction to them was less dis?couraging than his wife’s.
     ‘Well, if it’s as you say, Grannie, and being as you’ve al?ready seen this lady, why
not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?’
     ‘Bless us and save us!’ said Grannie Lin. ‘You know what they say: “A prince’s
door is like the deep sea.” What sort of creature do you take me for? The servants
there don’t know me; it would be a journey wasted.’
     ‘That’s no problem,’ said Gou-er. ‘I’ll tell you what to do. You take young Ban-er
with you and ask for Old Zhou that stayed in service with your lady after she married.
If you tell them you’ve come to see him, it will give you an excuse for the visit Old
Zhou once entrusted a bit of business to my father. He used to be very friendly with
us at one time.’
     ‘I knew all about that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But it’s a long time since you had
anything to do with him and hard to say how he may prove after all these years.
Howsomever. Being a man, you naturally can’t go in your present pickle; and a young
married woman like my daughter can’t go gallivanting around the countryside
showing herself to everybody. But as my old face is tough enough to stand a slap or
two, it’s up to me to go. So be it, then. If any good does come of the visit, we shall all
of us benefit.’
     And so, that very evening, the matter was settled.
     Next day Grannie Liu was up before dawn. As soon as she had washed and done
her hair, she set about teaching Ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great
house—an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough, as would any little boy
of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city. That done, she set
off on her journey, and in due course made her way to Two Dukes Street. There, at
each side of the stone lions which flanked the gates of the Rong Mansion, she saw a
cluster of horses and palanquins. Not daring to go straight up, she first dusted down
her clothes and rehearsed Ban-er’s little repertoire of phrases before sidling up to
one of the side entrances.
A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gate?way sunning their bellies
and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics. Grannie Liu
waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation. After looking her up and
down for a moment or two, they asked her her business. Grannie Liu smiled
ingratiatingly.
     ‘I’ve come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before
she married. Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?’
The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion. After she had
waited there for some considerable time one of them said, ‘If you stand at that gate
along there on the corner, someone from inside the house should be coming out
presently.’
But a more elderly man among them protested that it was ‘a shame to send her on a
fool’s errand’, and turning to Grannie Liu he said, ‘Old Zhou is away in the South at
the moment, but his missus is still at home. She lives round at the back. You’ll have to
go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.’
     Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted off with little Ban-er all the way round to
the rear entrance. There she found a number of sweetmeat vendors and toy-sellers
who had set their wares down outside the gate and were being besieged by a crowd
of some twenty or thirty noisy, yelling children. She grabbed a small urchin from their
midst and drew him towards her.
     ‘Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?’
     The urchin stared back at her impudently.
     ‘Which Mrs Zhou? There are several Mrs Zhous here. What’s her job?’
‘She’s the Mrs Zhou that came here with Her Ladyship when she was married.’
‘That’s easy,’ said the urchin. ‘Follow me!’
He led Grannie Lin into a rear courtyard. ‘That’s where she lives,’ he said, pointing
in the direction of a side wall. Then, bawling over the wall, ‘Mrs Zhou, there’s an
old woman come to see you！’
Zhou Rui’s wife came hurrying out and asked who it was.
‘How are you, my dear?’ said Grannie Liu, advancing with a smile. Zhou Rui’s wife
scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her.
‘Why, it’s Grannie Liu! How are you? It’s so many years since I saw you last, I’d
forgotten all about you! Come in and sit down!’
Grannie Liu followed her cackling.
‘You know what they say: “Important people have short memories.” I wouldn’t
expect you to remember the likes of us!’
When they were indoors, Zhou Rui’s wife ordered her little hired help to pour out
some tea.
‘And hasn’t Ban-er grown a big boy!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife; then, after a few
inquiries about the various things that had happened since they last met, she asked
Grannie Liu about her visit.
‘Were you just passing by, or have you come specially?’
‘Well, of course, first and foremost we came to see you, replied Grannie Liu
mendaciously, ‘but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship. If you
could take us to see her, that would be very nice; but if that’s not possible, perhaps
we could trouble you just to give her our regards.’
From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui’s wife was already able to make a pretty good
guess as to the real purpose of the old woman’s visit; but because some years
previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er’s father in a dispute
over the purchase of some land, she could not very well reject Grannie Iiu now, when
she came to her as a suppliant. She was, in any case, anxious to demonstrate her own
importance in the Jia household; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one.
‘Don’t you worry, Grannie! After you’ve made such a long pilgrimage, we won’t let
you go home without seeing a real Buddha! By rights, of course, Callers and Visitors
has nothing to do with me. You see, we each have our own jobs here. My man’s is
collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn; and when he’s not doing
that, he takes the young masters out when they go on visits. That’s all he ever does.
Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go
out. But being as how you are a relation of Her ladyship, and since you’ve put your
confidence in me and turned to me to help you, I don’t mind breaking the rules for
once and taking in a message.
‘There’s only one thing, though. I don’t expect you know, but things here are very
different from what they were five years ago. Nowadays Her Ladyship doesn’t run
things here any longer. It’s Master Lian’s wife who does all the managing—You’ll
never guess who that is: Her Ladyship’s niece Wang Xi-feng. You know, Her Ladyship’s
eldest brothers daughter, that we used to call “Feng-ge” when she was a child’
‘Bless you, my dear, for being such a help!’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Oh Grannie, how can you say such a thing?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife demurely. ‘You
know what the old saying is, “He who helps others helps himself.” It’s only a question
of saying a few words. No trouble at all.’
So saying, she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady
Jia’s quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet. The little maid departed on her
errand and the two women resumed their conversation.
‘This Mrs Lian,’ said Grannie Liu: ‘she can’t be more than eighteen or nineteen
years old. She must be a very capable young woman. Fancy her being able to run a
great household like this!’
‘Oh Grannie, you have no idea!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Mrs Lian may be young, but
when it comes to doing things, she’s got an older head on her shoulders than any I’ve
ever come across. She’s grown up to be a real beauty too, has Mrs Lian. But sharp!
Well, if it ever comes to a slanging match, she can talk down ten grown men any day
of the week! Wait till you meet her, and you’ll see what I mean. There’s only one
thing, though. She’s a bit too strict with those beneath her.’
As she was speaking, the little maid came back, her errand completed.
‘They’ve finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship’s. Mrs Lian is still there.’
Thou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise.
‘Quick! After she comes out from there she’ll be free for a few minutes while she
has her meal. We must try and catch her then. If we delay a moment longer, people
will start coming in with messages and we shan’t have a chance to speak to her. And
once she goes off for her afternoon nap, we’ve really lost her!’
Grannie Liu got off the kang, adjusted her clothing, con?ducted Ban-er through a
rapid revision of his little stock of phrases and followed Thou Rui’s wife through
various twists and turns to Jia Lian’s quarters. Just before they reached them, Zhou
Rui’s wife planted them both in a covered passage-way while she went on ahead
round the screen wall and into the gate of the courtyard. First ascertaining that Wang
Xi-feng had not yet left Lady Jia’s, she sought out Xi-feng’s chambermaid and
principal confidante, Patience, and primed her with a full account of Grannie Liu’s
antecedents.
‘She has come all this way today to pay her respects,’ she concluded. ‘At one time
Her Ladyship used to see quite a lot of her, which is why I thought it would be in
order for me to bring her in. I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come
back and explain it all to her. I hope she won’t be angry with me for pushing myself
forward.’
Patience at once made up her mind what to do.
‘Let them come in here. They can sit here while they are waiting.’
Zhou Rui’s wife went off again to fetch her charges. As they ascended the steps to the
main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portère
for them to enter. A strange, delicious fragrance seemed to reach forward and enfold
them as they entered, producing in Grannie Liu the momentary sensation that she
had been transported bodily to one of the celestial paradises. Their eyes, too, were
dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room. Temporarily
speechless with wonder, Grannie Liu stood wagging her head, alternating clicks of
admiration with pious ejaculations.
From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in
which Jia Lian’s baby daughter slept. Patience, who was standing by the edge of the
kang, made a rapid assessment of Grannie Liu and judged it sufficient to greet her
with a civil ‘how-do-you-do’ and an invitation to be seated.
Grannie Liu looked at the silks and satins in which Patience was dressed, the gold and
silver ornaments in her hair, her beauty of feature which in every respect
corresponded with what she had been told of Wang Xi-feng, and taking the maid for
the mistress, was on the point of greeting her as ‘Gou-er’s aunt, when Zhou Rui’s wife
introduced her as ‘Miss Patience. Then, when Patience shortly afterwards addressed
Zhou Rui’s wife as ‘Mrs Zhou’, she knew that this was no mistress but a very
high-class maid. So Grannie Liu and Ban-er got up on the kang at one side, while
Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife sat near the edge of it on the other, and a little maid
came in and poured them all some tea.
Grannie Liu’s attention was distracted by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike
the sound made by a flour-bolting machine, and she could not forbear glancing
round her from time to time to see where it came from. Presently she caught sight of
a sort of boxlike object fastened to one of the central pillars of the room, and a thing
like the weight of a steelyard hanging down from it, which swung to and fro in
ceaseless motion and appeared to be the source of the noise which had distracted
her.
‘I wonder what that can be,’ she thought to herself, ‘and what it can be used for?’
As she studied the strange box, it suddenly gave forth a loud dong! like the sound of
a bronze bell or a copper chime, which so startled the old lady that her eyes nearly
popped out of her head. The dong! was followed in rapid succession by eight or nine
others, and Grannie Liu was on the point of asking what it meant, when all the maids
in the house began scurrying about shouting, ‘The mistress! The mistress! She’ll be
coming out now!’ and Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to their feet.
‘Just stay here, Grannie,’ they said. ‘When it is time for you to see her, we shall
come in and fetch you’; and they went off with the other servants to greet their
mistress.
As Grannie Liu sat in silence, waiting with bated breath and head cocked to one side
for her summons, she heard a far-off sound of laughter, followed presently by a
sound of rustling dresses as between ten and twenty women entered the reception
room and passed from it into the room beyond. Then two or three women bearing
large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which
she sat and stood there waiting to be called. A voice in the far room called out, ‘Serve
now, please!’ at which, to judge from the noises, most of the women scuttled off,
leaving only the few who were waiting at table. A long silence ensued in which not so
much as a cheep could be heard; then two women came in bearing a small, low table
which they set down on the kang. It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all
kinds of meat and fish, only one or two of which appeared to have been touched. At
the sight of it Ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and was silenced by Grannie Liu
with a resounding slap.
Just at that moment Zhou Rui’s wife appeared, her face all wreathed in smiles, and
advanced towards Grannie Liu beckoning. Grannie Liu slipped off the kang, lifted
down Ban-er, and exchanged a few hurried whispers with her in the reception room
before waddling into the room beyond.
A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway. Inside, under
the window in the south wall, there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet. At
the east end of the kang, up against the wooden partition wall, were a back?rest and
bolster, both covered in gold brocade, and a large flat cushion for sitting on, also
glittering with gold thread. Beside them stood a silver spittoon.
Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable, which she wore about the house for
warmth, fastened on with a pearl ?studded bandeau. She was dressed in a sprigged
peach-pink gown, with an ermine-lined skirt of dark-red foreign crepe underneath it,
and a cloak of slate-blue silk with woven coloured insets and lining of grey squirrel
around her shoul?ders. Her face was exquisitely made-up. She was sitting on the
edge of the kang, her back straight as a ramrod, with a dimin?utive pair of tongs in
her hand, removing the spent charcoal from a portable hand-warmer. Patience stood
beside her carrying a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray. Xi-feng appeared
not to have noticed her, for she neither reached out for the cup nor raised her head,
but continued picking ab?sorbedly at her hand-warmer. At last she spoke:
‘Why not ask them in, then?’
As she did so, she raised her head and saw Zhou Rui’s wife with her two charges
already standing in front of her. She made a confused movement as if to rise to her
feet, welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence, and almost in
the same breath said rather crossly to Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’
By this time Grannie Liu was already down on her knees and had touched her head
several times to the floor in reverence to her ‘Aunt Feng’.
‘Stop her, Zhou dear!’ said Xi-feng in alarm. ‘She mustn’t do that, I am much too
young! In any case, I don’t know her very well. I don’t know what sort of relations we
are and what I should call her.’
‘This is the Grannie Liu I was just telling you about,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.
Xi-feng nodded, and Grannie Liu sat herself down on the edge of the kang Ban-er at
once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would
induce him to come out and make a bow to his ‘Auntie’.
‘Relations don’t come to see us much nowadays,’ said Xi-feng affably. ‘We’re
getting to be quite strangers with everybody. People who know us realize that it is
because you are tired of us that you don’t visit us oftener; but some spiteful people
who don’t know us so well think it’s our fault, because we have grown too proud.’

Grannie Liu invoked the Lord Buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view.
‘It’s hard times that keeps us away. We can’t afford to visit. We are afraid that if we
came to see you looking the way we are, you would disown us; and even the people
at the gate might think we were tramps!’
‘Now you are really being too hard on us! What if Grand?father did make a little bit
of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment? What does
it all amount to? It’s all empty show, really. You know what they say: “Even the
Emperor has poor relations.” It would be strange indeed if we didn’t have a few!’
She turned to Thou Rui’s wife.
‘Have you told Her Ladyship yet?’
‘No, ma’am. I was waiting for your instructions.’
‘Go and have a look, then. If she has anyone with her, you had better leave it; but if
she is free, tell her about their visit and see what she says.’
Zhou Rui’s wife departed on her errand.
Xi-feng told one of the servants to give Ban-er a handful of sweets, and had just
begun a desultory conversation with Grannie Liu when a number of domestics and
underlings of either sex arrived to report on their duties.
‘I am entertaining a guest,’ said Xi-feng to Patience when she came in to announce
their arrival. ‘Let them leave it until this evening. But if anyone has important
business, bring them in and I will deal with it now.’
Patience went out and returned a minute later to say that she had asked them and
no one had any business of special importance, so she had sent them all away.
Xi-feng nodded.
At this point Zhou Rui’s wife returned with a message for Xi-feng.
‘Her Ladyship says she isn’t free today, but that if you will entertain them for her, it
will be just the same as if she were to receive them herself. She says please thank
them very much for coming. And she says if it’s just an ordinary visit she has nothing
more to add; but if they have anything particular to say, she says tell them that they
can say it to you instead.’
‘I hadn’t anything particular in mind,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Only to look in on Her Ladyship and your mistress. Just a visit to relations.’
‘Well all right then, if you are sure you have nothing to say. But if you have got
anything to say, you really ought to tell the mistress. It will be just the same as if you
were to say it to Her Ladyship.’ Zhou Rui’s wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie
Liu as she said this.
Grannie Liu perfectly well understood the significance of this look, and a blush of
shame overspread her face. Yet if she did not speak up now, what would have been
the purpose of her visit? She forced herself to say something.
‘By rights I ought not to mention it today, seeing that this is our first meeting: but
as I have come such a long way to see you, it seems silly not to speak…’
She had got no further when the pages from the outer gate announced the arrival of
‘the young master from the Ning mansion’ and Xi-feng gestured to her to stop.
‘It’s all right. There is no need to tell me.’ She turned to the pages. ‘Where is Master
Rong, then ?’
A man’s footstep sounded outside and a fresh-faced, willowy youth of seventeen or
eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress came into the room.
Grannie Liu, acutely embarrassed in this male presence, did not know whether to sit
or stand, and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself. Xi-feng laughed
at her discomfiture.
‘Don’t mind him; just stay where you are! It’s only ray nephew.’
With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again, perching herself
obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang.
Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion.
‘My father is entertaining an important visitor tomorrow and he wondered if he
might borrow the little glass screen that your Uncle Wang’s wife gave you, to put on
our kang while he is there. We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone.’
‘You are too late,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I lent it yesterday to someone else.
Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang.
‘If you won’t lend it, my father will say that I didn’t ask properly and I shall get a
beating. Come on, Auntie, be a sport! Just for my sake!’
Xi-feng smiled maliciously.
‘I don’t know what’s so special about my family’s things. Heaven knows, you have
enough stuff of your own over there; yet you have only to set eyes on anything of
ours, and you want it for yourselves.’
Jia Rong’s smile flashed again.
‘Please, Auntie! Be merciful!’
‘If it’s the tiniest bit chipped,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll have the hide off you!’
She ordered Patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable
servants to carry it over. Delighted with his good luck, Jia Rong hurriedly forestalled
her.
‘I’ll get some of my own people to carry it. Don’t put yours to a lot of trouble!’ and
he hurried out.
Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the
window, ‘Rong, come back! ‘
Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, ‘Master Rong, you’re wanted
back again!’
Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with
eyebrows arched inquiringly.
Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying
nothing. Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh:
‘It doesn’t matter. Come back again after supper. I’ve got company now, and
besides, I don’t feel in the mood to tell you.’
‘Yes, Aunt,’ said Jia Rong, and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he
sauntered slowly out of the room.
Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again:
‘The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and
Ma haven’t anything in the house to eat, and the weather is getting colder,
and—and—I thought I’d bring him here to see you ...’ She gave Ban-er a despairing
push. ‘What did your Pa tell you to say when we got here? What was it he sent us for?
Look at you! All you can do is sit there eating sweets!’
It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on,
and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile.
‘It’s quite all right. There is no need to tell me. I quite understand.’ She turned to
Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today ?’
‘We were on our way first thing this morning,’ Grannie Liu chimed in. ‘There was no
time to think about eating.’
Xi-feng gave orders for a meal to be brought in, and Zhou Rui’s wife went out and
presently reappeared with a guest’s portion of various choice dishes on a little table,
which she set down in the east wing, and to which she then conducted Grannie Liu
and Ban-er for their meal.
‘Zhou, dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘will you keep them company and see that they have
enough to eat? I shan’t be able to sit with them myself.’ Then calling her aside for a
moment she asked, ‘What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them
just now?’
‘She said they don’t really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan
years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office. She
said they haven’t been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used
to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed. She said it was nice of them to
come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately. And
she said if they appear to want anything, she would leave it to you to decide what we
should do for them.’
‘No wonder!’ exclaimed Xi-feng when she had heard this account. ‘I couldn’t
understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them.’
While they were talking, Grannie Liu came back from the other room having already
finished eating, smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively, and voicing
her thanks for the repast.
‘Sit down,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I have something to say to you. I quite
understand what you were trying to tell me just now. As we are relations, we ought
by rights not to wait for you to come to our door before helping you when you are in
trouble; but there are so many things to attend to in this family, and now that Her
Ladyship is getting on a bit she doesn’t always remember them all. And since I took
over the management of the household, I find there are quite a lot of relations that I
don’t even know about. And then again, of course, though we may look thriving
enough from the out?side, people don’t realize that being a big establishment like
ours carries its own difficulties. They won’t believe it if you tell them, but it’s true.
However, since you have come such a long way, and since this is the first time you
have ever said a word about needing help, we obviously can’t let you go back
empty-handed. Fortunately it so happens that I still haven’t touched any of the
twenty taels of silver that Her Ladyship gave me the other day to make clothes for
the maids with. If you don’t mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.’
When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about ‘difficulties’ she concluded that there was
no hope. Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she
heard that she was, after all, to be given twenty taels of sliver can be imagined.
‘We knew you had your troubles,’ she said, ‘but as the saying goes, “A starved
camel is bigger than a fat horse.” Say what you like, a hair plucked from your arm is
thicker than a man’s waist to folks like us!’
Horrified by the crudity of these expressions, Zhou Rui’s wife, who was standing by,
was meanwhile signaling fran?tically to the old lady to stop. But Xi-feng laughed
quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string
of cash to go with it. The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu.
‘Here is the twenty taels of silver,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Take this for the time being to make
some winter clothes for the children with. Some time later on, when you have
nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship’s sake. It’s late now, so
I won’t try to keep you. Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered
when you get back!’
She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt ex?pressions of gratitude, picked
up the money and followed Zhou Rui’s wife out of the room.
‘My dear good woman,’ said the latter when they were out of earshot, ‘whatever
came over you? First, when you met her, you couldn’t get a word out; then, when
you did start talking, it was all “your nephew” this and “your nephew” that! I hope
you won’t mind my saying so, but even if the child was a real nephew you would still
need to go a bit easy on the familiarities. Now Master Rong, he is her real nephew.
That’s the sort of person a lady like that calls “nephew”. Where she would come by a
nephew like this one, I just do not know!’
‘My dear,’ replied Grannie Liu with a laugh, ‘when I saw the pretty little darling
sitting there, I took such a liking to her that my heart was too full to speak.’
Back in Zhou Rui’s quarters the two women sat talking for a while. Grannie Liu
wanted to leave a piece of silver to buy something for the Zhou children with, but
Zhou Rui’s wife said she wouldn’t hear of it and refused absolutely to accept anything.
And so, with many expressions of gratitude, the old lady took her leave and set out
once more through the back gate of the mansion.
And if you want to know what happened after she had left, you will have to read the
next chapter.




CHAPTER 7



Zhou Rui’s wife delivers palace flowers and finds Jia
Lian pursuing night sports by day
Jia Bao-yu visits the Ning-guo mansion and has an
agreeable colloquy with Qin-shi’s brother



When Zhou Rui’s wife had finished seeing off Grannie Liu, she went to Lady Wang’s
place to report. Lady Wang, however, was not in her apartment. The maids said that
she had gone off to visit Aunt Xue. Zhou Rui’s wife accordingly went out by the gate
in the east corner of the compound, crossed the eastern courtyard, and made her
way to Pear Tree Court. As she reached the gate of the Court, she came upon Lady
Wang’s maid, Golden, playing on the front steps with a young girl. Golden realized
that Zhou Rui’s wife must have come with a message for Lady Wang and indicated
that her mistress was inside by turning her chin towards the house and shooting out
her lips.
     Zhou Rui’s wife gently raised a side of the portière and entered. She found the
two sisters in the midst of a seemingly interminable discussion of some domestic
odyssey. Not daring to interrupt it, she passed on into the inner room, where Xue
Bao-chai, dressed in workaday clothes, her hair unadorned and twisted in a knot on
top of her head, sat with her maid Oriole over a little table towards the back of the
kang, tracing a pattern for her embroidery. Seeing Zhou Rui’s wife enter, she laid
down her tracing brush, turned towards her with a smile, and invited her to sit with
them.
     ‘How are you, Miss? asked Zhou Rui’s wife, returning her smile and sitting down
on the edge of the kang. ‘I haven’t seen you over our side these last two or three
days. Has Master Bao been upsetting you?’
     ‘Good gracious, no!’ said Bao-chai with a laugh. ‘I’ve had an attack of my old
sickness again and thought I had better rest quietly at home for a day or two. That’s
the only reason.’
     ‘Very sensible!’ said Zhou Ruj’s wife. ‘But what is this sickness of yours, Miss?
Oughtn’t you to call in a doctor and get it properly seen to? It’s no joke when a young
person of your age lets an illness get its grip on them.’
     ‘Oh, don’t talk about my illness I’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t know how many doctors
we must have consulted about it, and how many medicines I must have swallowed,
or how much money we must have spent on it - all without any benefit whatsoever.
In the end we were fortunate enough to hear of a monk who specialized in treating
illnesses that other people couldn’t diagnose and asked him to have a look at me. He
said that I had a congenital tendency to overheatedness, but that fortunately, as my
constitution was a strong one, it wasn’t serious. He said the usual medicines
wouldn’t do it any good, and he gave us a prescription supposed to have been
handed down from the Immortals of the Islands. He also gave us a packet of powder
with a very unusual fragrance which he said was to be used as the base. He said that
if each time I had a turn I took just one of the pills made up from this prescription,
the sickness would go away. And the remarkable thing is that they really have proved
quite effective.’
‘What was this prescription, Miss? If you will tell me, I shall try to remember it so
that I can pass it on to others. If I ever met anyone else who had the same sort of
illness, I could do them a charity, couldn’t I?’
‘You don’t know what you are asking,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s such a finicky prescription,
it would drive anyone mad trying to make it up. It’s not so much the materials. There
is, after all, a limit to the number of drugs from one part of the world or another that
are available. It’s the timing involved that is so difficult.
      ‘You have to take twelve ounces of stamens of the spring-flowering white
tree-peony, twelve ounces of stamens of the summer-flowering white water-lily,
twelve ounces of stamens of the autumn-flowering white lotus, and twelve ounces of
stamens of the winter-flowering white plum and dry them all in the sun on the day of
the spring equinox of the year im?mediately following the year you picked them in.
Then you have to mix them with the powder I told you about and pound them all up
together in a mortar. Then you must take twelve drams of rain water that fell on the
Rain Days in the second month...
Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.
‘Why, that’s already three years it would take! And suppose it didn’t rain that year
on the Rain Days?’
‘Exactly,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Rain is seldom so obliging. You would just have to wait till
the next year. Then you have to collect twelve drams of dew on the day White Dew in
the ninth month, twelve drams of frost at Frost Fall in the tenth, and twelve drams of
snow at Lesser Snow in the last month of the year, stir these four kinds of water into
the mixture, make it up into pills about the size of a longan, and store the pills in an
old porcelain jar. The jar is supposed to be buried in a flower bed and only dug up
when you have an attack of the illness. Then one of the pills is taken out and
swallowed in hot water into which one and a quarter drams of tincture of
phellodendron has been stirred.’
‘God bless my soul!’ Zhou Rui’s wife exclaimed. ‘You would certainly need some
patience! Why, you might wait ten years before getting all those things at the proper
times!’
‘Well,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we were lucky. Within only a year or two of the monk’s visit
we had managed to get all the ingredients together and were able to make up the
pills without trouble. We brought them with us when we came to live here and have
buried them under one of the pear-trees in the garden.’
‘Has this medicine got a name?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked.
‘Yes,’said Bao-chai.‘The monk said the pills are ￡alled“Cold Fragrance Pills”.’
Zhou Rui’s wife nodded appreciatively.
‘Tell me, Miss, what exactly is this illness of yours?’
‘It doesn’t really bother me very much. It makes me cough and wheeze a bit. But as
soon as I have taken one of the pills, it goes away.’
Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask something else when they were interrupted by a
call from Lady Wang:
‘Who have you got in there?’
She hurried back into the outer room to make her report on Grannie Liu. Having
finished it, she waited for some comment from Lady Wang, but finding that none was
forth?coming, was on the point of withdrawing when Aunt Xue smilingly enjoined
her to stay.
‘Just a moment! There is something I should like you to take for me.’
She called to someone outside.
‘Caltrop!’
The rings of the portière rattled and the young girl whom Zhou Rui’s wife had seen a
few minutes before playing on the steps with Golden came into the room.
‘You called, Madam?’
‘Bring me that box with the flowers in!’
Caltrop went into a side room and returned with a small embroidered box.
‘There are twelve artificial flowers in here,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘They were made in the
Imperial Palace, all in the latest fashion. I suddenly thought to myself yesterday what
a pity it was to leave them lying around here doing nothing, and how much nicer it
would be to give them to the girls to wear. I meant to send them round yesterday but
forgot. It’s lucky that you came here today, because you will be able to take them for
me. There are two each for each of the Jia girls. That leaves six. Then two for Miss Lin,
and the remaining four for Mrs Lian.’
‘Keep them for Bao-chai to wear,’ said Lady Wang. ‘What do you want to go
bothering about our girls for?’
‘You don’t know our Bao-chai. She is funny about these things. She has never liked
ornaments or make-up or anything of that sort.’
Zhou Rui’s wife took up the box and went out into the courtyard, where she came
once more upon Golden, sunning herself on the steps.
‘Tell me,’ she asked her, ‘is that little Caltrop the one they are always talking about
who was bought just before they came to the capital? The one they had the murder
trial about?’
‘That’s her,’ said Golden.
At that moment Caltrop herself came skipping up with a sunny smile on her face, and
Zhou Rui’s wife took her by the hand and studied her curiously. Then she turned to
Golden again.
‘You know, there’s something about this child’s face that reminds me of Master
Rong’s wife over at the Ning mansion.’
‘That’s just what I’ve said,’ Golden agreed.
Zhou Rui’s wife asked Caltrop how old she was when she became a slave. Then she
asked her where her parents were, what her age was, and what part of the country
she came from. But to all of these questions Caltrop only shook her head and said
that she didn’t remember.
Zhou Rui’s wife and Golden exchanged glances and sighed sympathetically.
Bearing her box of flowers, Zhou Rui’s wife presently came to the part of the house
behind Lady Wang’s quarters. Grand?mother Jia had recently decided that her
granddaughters were becoming too numerous and declared that she would retain
only Bao-yu and Dai-yu in her own apartments to keep her amused. Ying-chun,
Tan-chun and Xi-chun were to move out into the penthouse behind Lady Wang’s,
with Li Wan to supervise them and keep them company. Thither, accordingly, Zhou
Rui’s wife now directed her steps.
A number of little maids were sitting under the eaves there waiting to be called, and
just as she arrived, Ying-chun’s maid Chess and Tan-chun’s maid Scribe came through
the portière, each carrying a teacup on a tray, from which she deduced that the two
cousins must be inside together.
On entering the room, Zhou’s wife found Ying-chun and Tan-chun sitting by the
window playing Go. She presented the flowers and explained who they were from,
and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks, and gave
orders to the maids to take charge of them.
‘Where is Miss Xi-chun?’ Zhou Rui’s wife inquired.
‘Isn’t she in the next room?’ said the maids; and there in fact she proved to be,
playing with the little nun Sapientia from Water-moon Priory. She asked Zhou Rui’s
wife what she had come for, and when Zhou Rui’s wife took the flowers from the box
and explained, she laughed:
‘I was telling Sapientia that one of these day I am going to have my hair shaved and
go off with her to be a nun, when just at that very moment you came in with these
flowers. What shall I do with flowers when I have no hair to stick them in?’
Further pleasantries followed from the others present.
Xi-chun told one of the maids to take the flowers and look after them.
‘When did you arrive?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked Sapientia. ‘And where’s that precious
Mother Superior of yours gone off to, bald-headed old mischief?’
‘We arrived first thing this morning,’ said Sapientia. ‘Mother Euergesia went off to
visit the Yu mansion after she had seen Her Ladyship. She told me to wait for her
here.’
Have you had this month’s donation yet?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘It was due on the
fifteenth.’
Sapientia said that she didn’t know.
‘Who looks after the monthly donations nowadays?’ asked Xi-chun.
‘Yu Xin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife.
‘That explains it. As soon as Mother Euergesia arrived, Yu Xin’s wife was in here like
a shot and they were chattering together for ages. I expect that’s what it was about.’
After gossiping a bit longer with Sapientia, Zhou Rui’s wife made her way to Xi-feng’s
quarters. To get there she had to go down a passage-way between two walls, under
the windows at the back of Li Wan’s apartments, along the foot of an ornamental
wail, and through a gateway in the western cornet of the compound. When she
entered Xi-feng’s reception room, a maid sitting on the threshold of the inner room
hurriedly waved her away and told her to go across to the other side of the house.
Taking the hint, Zhou Rui’s wife tiptoed quietly into the room opposite, where she
found the baby’s nurse patting her rhythmically to make her sleep.
‘Is the mistress taking her afternoon nap?’ she asked the nurse in a low whisper. ‘I
think you’ll have to wake her, even if she is.’
The nurse smiled, grimaced, and shook her head. Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask
her what she meant when she heard a low laugh in what was unmistakably Jia Lian’s
voice from the room opposite. It was followed almost immediately by the sound of
the door opening, and Patience came out carrying a large copper basin which she
asked one of the maids to fetch water in.
‘Ah, Mrs Zhou!’ she said, catching sight of Zhou Rui’s wife and crossing into the
room opposite ‘What brings you back again?’
         Zhou Rui’s wife hastily rose to her feet and picking up the box, proferred it
to Patience and explained her mission. Patience opened the lid, selected four of the
flowers, and slipped away again for several minutes. She came back with two still in
her hand, which she gave to a little page called Sunshine.
‘Take these to Master Rong’s wife over in the Ning mansion and tell her they are for
her to wear,’ she said. Then turning to Zhou Rui’s wife she asked her to convey
Xi-feng’s thanks to the donor.
Zhou Rui’s wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Just as
she was coming out of the covered passage-way, she ran head-on into her daughter,
all dressed up in her best clothes having just arrived on a visit from her
mother-in-law’s.
‘What’s suddenly brought you here at a time like this ?’ she asked her daughter.
‘How have you been keeping, Mother? I’ve been waiting at your place for hours for
you to come back. What’s been keeping you all this time? I got tired of waiting. I
thought I’d go and say “hullo” to Her Old Ladyship, and now I was just on my way to
see Her Ladyship. Have you still not finished then? What’s that you’ve got in your
hand?’
Zhou Rui’s wife laughed.
‘Today is not my lucky day! First of all someone called Grannie Liu turned up, so like
a fool I spend half the day rushing around with her. Then, as if that wasn’t enough,
Her Ladyships sister sees me and gets me delivering flowers to the young ladies. I
haven’t finished yet. Now what have you come here today for? Something’s gone
wrong, I’ll be bound !’
‘I don’t know how you always manage to guess, Mother, but you’re right: it has. I’ll
be honest with you. My man had a cup too much to drink the other day and got into
a fight with someone, and now, out of spite, they are trying to stir up trouble for him.
They say his papers aren’t in order, and they’ve reported him to the yamen and want
to get him deported back South to his old village. So I thought I’d come and ask your
advice, Mother, and see if you couldn’t get someone here to put in a word for him.
Do you think there’s anyone who would be able to help?’
‘I knew it would be something like this,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Well, cheer up, it’s
not so serious as all that! You just go back and wait while I take these flowers to Miss
Lin. You can’t see Her Ladyship now. She and the young mistress are both busy.’
     The daughter obediently turned back to her mother’s quarters. As she went, she
said pleadingly,
     ‘Be as quick as you can, Mother, won’t you?’
     ‘Yes, yes, yes. I’ll be as quick as I can! You young people take everything so
tragically! Lack of experience, that’s what it is!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, and moved on to
Dai-yu’s room.
     Dai-yu was not in her own room, but with Bao-yu, trying to undo metal puzzles.
     ‘Miss Lin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife with a smile, ‘Mrs Xue asked me to give you these
flowers.’
     ‘What flowers ?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let me see!’
     He stretched out his arm, took the box from Zhou Rui’s wife, and looked. Two
artificial flowers, exquisitely fashioned by Palace craftsmen out of silk gauze, lay
inside it. Dai-yu glanced over his arm into the box.
     ‘Am I the only one getting these, or have the others had some too?’
     ‘All the young ladies are getting them,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘These two are for
you, Miss.’
     ‘I thought as much,’ said Dai-yu sneeringly. ‘I get the leavings when everyone
else has had their pick.’
     Zhou Rui’s wife received this sally in silence, not daring to retort.
     ‘What were you doing at my aunt’s place, Zhou?’ Bao-yu asked.
     ‘Her Ladyship was there, and I had something to tell her.
Then while I was over there, Mrs Xue took the opportunity of giving me these flowers
to deliver for her.’
          Was Miss Bao-chai there?’ Bao-yu asked. ‘Why hasn’t she been round these
last few days?’
‘She’s not very well.’
Bao-yu turned to his maids.
‘Which of you will go and see Miss Bao-chai for me? Say that Miss Lin and I send
our regards to her and her mother, and ask her if her illness is any better and what
she’s taking for it. Say that I really ought to go myself, but that as I’ve just got back
from my lessons and have caught a bit of a cold, I shall be coming round another day.’
Snowpink said that she would go, and she and Zhou Rui’s wife left the room together
and went their separate ways.
This son-in-law of Zhou Rui’s who had got himself into trouble was none other than
Jia Yu-cun’s old friend, Leng Zi-xing. He had recently become involved in a lawsuit
arising out of the sale of some antiques, and had asked his wife to get strings pulled
for him at the mansion. Zhou Rui’s wife made light of the affair, confident of her
employers’ power to in?fluence. A word to Xi-feng in the evening, and it would be as
good as settled.



*

At lighting-up time that evening Xi-feng came in partial négligé(having removed her
ornaments for the night) to report on the day’s affairs to Lady Wang.
‘Today I received the things sent us by the Zhen family. The Zhens have their own
boat delivering seasonal produce for the New Year, so I have given their people our
presents to the Zhens to take back on their return journey.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘I’ve got our birthday presents ready for the Earl of Lin?an’s mother,’ continued
Xi-feng. ‘Who would you like us to send with them ?’
‘Just see which women are free and send four of them,’ replied Lady Wang. ‘You
don’t have to ask me about things like that I’
‘Today Cousin Zhen’s wife invited me to spend tomorrow with them at the other
house,’ Xi-feng continued. ‘Is there anything tomorrow that needs doing here ?’
‘Whether there is or not,’ said Lady Wang, ‘I don’t see that it matters. Generally
when she brings an invitation it is for all of us, and you are naturally too busy to go.
This time the invitation is to you personally, which shows that she had deliberately
arranged this in order to give you a rest. The thought is a kind one, and it would be
ungrateful to refuse. I think you ought to go.’
By now Li Wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty, and when
all had wished Lady Wang good night they departed to their different rooms.
Next day, as soon as Xi-feng had completed her toilet, she first reported to Lady
Wang and then went to take her leave of Grandmother Jia. Hearing that she was
going to the other house, Bao-yu said he wanted to go too, and Xi-feng was obliged
to say that she would take him and to stand waiting for him while he changed his
clothes. The two then got into a mule-cart and were soon inside the Ning-guo
mansion, where Cousin Zhen’s wife You-shi, her son Jia Rong, her little
daughter-in-law Qin-shi, and a large number of women attendants and maids were
standing outside the inner gate ready to welcome them.
You-shi’s encounters with Xi-feng were always the oc?casion of good-humoured
banter. Taking Bao-yu by the hand and chatting to Xi-feng, she conducted them both
into the main reception room, where they all sat down and were served tea by
Qin-shi.
‘Well,’ said Xi-feng, ‘what have you asked me here for? Something nice, I hope! If
it’s a present, you’d better bring it now; I’m a busy woman!’
Before You-shi could think of a suitable retort, one of the women attendants replied
for her:
‘You ought not to have come, Mrs Lian! Now that you’re here, we’ve got you in our
power and you’ll have to do what we say for a change!’
At that moment Jia Rong came in and paid his respects to the visitors. Bao-yu asked
what had happened to Cousin Zhen.
‘He’s gone into the country to see Father,’ said You-shi. Then she added, ‘It’s not
much fun for you sitting here. Why don’t you go off and amuse yourself inside?’
‘You’ve chosen a good day to come, Uncle Bao,’ said little Qin-shi. ‘Last time you
were here you wanted to see my brother. Well, today he’s here. He’s sitting in the
study at this very moment. Why don’t you go in and see him?’
Bao-yu was for rushing off straight away. You-shi hurriedly ordered some servants to
go after him in discreet attendance.
‘Well now, just a minute I’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not ask him in here so that I can see
him too?’
‘Oh dear, I don’t think that would do at all!’ said You-shi. ‘Some people’s children
aren’t used to rackety ways like ours. Some people’s children are quiet and refined. If
they were to meet a termagant like you, they might die of laughing.’
‘He’ll be lucky if I don’t laugh at him,’ said Xi-feng cheer-fully. ‘He’d better not try
laughing at me!’
‘He’s very, very shy, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong. We are afraid that if you saw him it might
only irritate you.’
‘Fiddlestick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t care if he’s a three-faced wonder with eight arms,
I still want to see him. Stop fatting about and bring him in, or I’ll box your ears!’
Jia Rong cringed in mock alarm.
‘Yes, Auntie! No need to get so fierce! We’ll bring him in straight away.’
They both laughed, and Jia Rong disappeared for a while and presently came back
leading a youth who, though some?what thinner than Bao-yu, was mote than his
equal in freshness and liveliness of feature, in delicacy of complexion,
hand?someness of figure, and grace of deportment, but whose painful bashfulness
created a somewhat girlish impression. He approached Xi-feng and made his bow
with a shy con?fusion which delighted her.
‘You’ve met your match!’ she said to Bao-yu with a laugh, nudging him playfully.
Then, leaning forward and gripping the boy’s hand in her own, she drew him down
beside her and proceeded in a very deliberate manner to ask him how old he was,
what books he was reading, and various other matters -among them his name, which
was Qin Zhong.
          When the maids and womenfolk in attendance on Xi-feng realized that she
was about to meet Qin Zhong and that they had come without the requisite material
for a First Meeting present, they had sent some of their number back to consult
Patience in the other house. Patience had, at her own dis?cretion, selected a suitable
length of material and two little ‘Top of the List’ solid gold medallions to give the
mes?sengers. These gifts now arrived for Xi-feng (who thought them somewhat on
the meagre side) to give to Qin Zhong. When he and his sister had formally thanked
her, the company sat down to lunch, after which You-shi, Xi-feng and Qin?-shi settled
down to a game of cards, while Bao-yu and Qin Zhong left the table to converse
elsewhere.
When Bao-yu first set eyes on Qin Zhong it had been as though part of his soul had
left him. For a while he stared blankly, oblivious to all around him, while a stream of
idle fancies passed through his mind.
‘How perfect he is! Who would have believed there could be such perfection? Now
that I have seen him I know that I am just a pig wallowing in the mud, a mangy dog!
Why, why did I have to be born in this pretentious aristocratic household? Why
couldn’t I have been born in the family of some poor scholar or low-grade clerk?
Then I could have been neat him and got to know him, and my life would have been
worth living. Though I am so much richer and more nobly born than he, what use are
my fine clothes but to covet up the dead and rotten wood beneath? What use the
luxuries I eat and drink but to fill the cesspit and swell the stinking sewer of my inside?
O rank and riches! How you poison everything!’
At the same time, Qin Zhong, struck by Bao-yu’s rare good looks and princely bearing
and— even more perhaps—by the golden coronet and embroidered clothing and the
train of pretty maids and handsome pages who attended him, was thinking:
‘No wonder my sister raves about him whenever his name is mentioned! Why did I
have to be born in a poor respectable family? How I should have liked to get to know
him: to have shared moments of warmth and affection with him! But it was not to
be!’
Each, plunged in reverie, for a while said nothing. Then Bao-yu asked Qin Zhong
about his reading, and Qin Zbong replied—a full, frank reply, without the trappings of
polite?ness: and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and
were already like old friends.
After a while tea and various confections were brought in.
‘We two shan’t be drinking any wine,’ Bao-yu said to the ladies. ‘May we have a
plate or two of these things set out on the little kang in the other room? We can talk
in there without disturbing you,’
The two boys moved into the inner room for their tea.
          In between plying Xi-feng with wine and delicacies, Qin?shi slipped in for a
word with Bao-yu.
‘My brother’s quite young, Uncle Bao. Please, for my sake, don’t mind him if he
does anything to offend you! He may be shy, but he’s got quite a nasty temper. He’s
not really easy to get on with at all.
          ‘You go along I’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘We shall be all right!’
          After a few admonitory words to her brother, Qin-shi went back to look
after Xi-feng.
          Some minutes later Xi-feng and You- shi sent a servant in to inquire whether
the boys would like anything else to eat, adding that they had only to ask if they
wanted anything. Bao-yu promised that they would; but his mind was not on eating
and drinking, and he continued to question Qin Zhong about his life at home.
‘My private tutor resigned last year,’ Qin Zhong told him. ‘Father is quite old, and as
his health is not very good and his job keeps him terribly busy, he hasn’t been able to
do any?thing yet about getting me another one. At the moment I am lust going over
old lessons on my own at home. The trouble is, though, that if you want to get on in
a subject, you really need one or two like-minded people to study with you, so that
every so often you can all discuss what you have been reading...’
          ‘Exactly!’ Bao-yu put in eagerly, not waiting for him to finish. ‘We have a
private school in our family to which any members of the clan who can’t manage
private tuition may send their children, and boys from related families who aren’t in
the clan can also be admitted. I have been at a loose end ever since my tutor went
home on leave, and Father would have liked me to go to this school for revision until
he gets back next year and I can be taught privately again. But Grandmother said that
with so many boys in the school I should be sure to get up to mischief, and it would
do me more harm than good. She also said I couldn’t in any case go then, because I’d
only just recovered after several days in bed. And so it got put off.
‘From what you say, your father is worried about the same problem as mine; so
why not tell him about this school when you get back today and ask him if you can
join? I should be there to keep you company, and we could both help each other. I
think it would be a marvellous idea.’
‘The other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up, Father mentioned
this school of yours as a possible alternative,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘He was going to come
over and have a word with my sister’s father-in-law about it and get him to
recommend me; but they were busy here at the time and it didn’t seem the right
moment to bother them with a little thing like this. However, if you are really of the
opinion that I could be of some service to you, even if it’s only grinding your ink or
cleaning your ink-stone, do please arrange it as soon as you can, before we both get
too rusty! We should be relieving our parents of an anxiety and having the pleasure
of each other’s company at one and the same time; so it would be a good
arrangement from every point of view.’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll tell Cousin Lian’s wife presently, when we join the
others. Then when we get back home tonight, you must tell your father and I shall
tell my grandmother. There’s no reason that I can see why this shouldn’t be settled
immediately.’
They had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk, and now moved back into the
lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while. When the latter
had finished and had added up their scores, it appeared that Qin-shi and You-shi had
lost to Xi-feng and owed her a dramatic enter?tainment at which the players and the
drinks were to be provided at their expense. In the course of dinner, which was now
served and at which they were joined by the two boys, it was decided that this
should take place in two days’ time.
As it was now quite dark, You-shi gave her women orders to see that two
menservants were detailed to attend Qin Zhong on his way back home. The women
were gone on their errand an unusually long time and eventually Qin Zhong rose to
take his leave.
‘Who has been chosen to go with him?’ You-shi asked.
‘They have asked Big Jiao,’ said the women, ‘but it seems that he is terribly drunk
and swearing at everybody.’
You-shi and Qin-shi were indignant.
‘Whatever did they want to go and ask him for? Any of the younger ones would
have done. What was the point of provoking him?’
‘I always said you were too soft with people,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You really mustn’t let
servants get away with it like this. I never heard of such a thing !’
‘You don’t know Big Jiao,’ said You-shi. ‘Even Father couldn’t do anything with him,
let alone Zhen. When he was young he went with Grandfather on three or four of his
campaigns and once saved his life by pulling him from under a heap of corpses and
carrying him to safety on his back. He went hungry himself and stole things for his
master to eat; and once when he had managed to get half a cupful of water, he gave
it to his master and drank horse’s urine himself. Because of these one or two acts of
heroism he was always given special treatment during Grandfather’s lifetime; so
naturally we don’t like to upset him now. But since he’s grown old he has let himself
go completely. He drinks all the time, and when he’s drunk he starts abusing
everybody—literally everybody. I’ve repeatedly told the steward not to give him jobs
to do—to behave exactly as though he were dead and ignore him completely. Why
on earth should he have chosen him today?’
     ‘I know this Big Jiao all right,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and I still say that you are too weak.
You ought to send him away. Right away. Send him to live on one of your farms: that
would put a stop to his nonsense!’ She turned to the women and asked if her own
carriage was ready yet. The women replied that it was waiting, and she rose to take
her leave and, taking Bao-yu by the hand, went out on to the steps, attended by
You-shi and the rest.
     In the flickering light of many lanterns the pages stood stiffly to attention on the
pavement below, while Big Jiao, encouraged by Cousin Zhen’s absence to indulge his
talent for drunken abuse, was getting to work on the Chief Steward, Lai Sheng,
accusing him of being unfair, of always dropping on the weakest, and so on and so
forth.
     ‘If there’s a cushy job going you give it to someone else, but when it’s a question
of seeing someone home in pitch bloody darkness, you pick on me. Mean, rotten
bugger! Call yourself a steward? Some steward! Don’t you know who Old Jiao is? I
can lift my foot up higher than your head! Twenty years ago I didn’t give a damn for
anybody, never mind a pack of little misbegotten abortions like you!’
     He was just getting into his stride when Jia Rong came out to see Xi-feng off in
her carriage. The servants shouted to Big Jiao to stop, but without success. Impatient
of the old man’s insolence, Jia Rong cursed him angrily.
     ‘Tie him up,’ he said to the servants. ‘We shall see if he is still so eager for death
tomorrow morning, when he has sobered up a bit.’
     But Big Jiao was not to be intimidated by such as Jia Rong. On the contrary, he
staggered up to him and bel?lowed even louder.
     ‘Oh ho! Little Rong, is it? Don’t you come the Big Master stuff with me, sonny
boy! Never mind a little bit of a kid like you, even your daddy and your granddaddy
don’t dare to try any funny stuff with Old Jiao. If it wasn’t for Old Jiao, where would
you lot all be today, with your rank and your fancy titles and your money and all the
other things you enjoy? It was your great-granddad, whose life I saved when he was
given up for dead, that won all this for you, by the sweat of his brow. And what
reward do I get for saving him? Nothing. Instead you come to me and you put on
your Big Master act. Well, I’ll tell you something. You’d better watch out. Because if
you don’t, you’re going to get a shiny white knife inside you, and it’s going to come
out red!’
     ‘You’d better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business,’
said Xi-feng to Jia Rong from her carriage. ‘It’s positively dangerous to keep a man
like this on the premises. If any of our acquaintance get to know that a family like
ours can’t keep even a semblance of discipline about the place, we shall become a
laughing-stock.’
Jia Rong assented meekly.
     Several of the servants, seeing that Big Jiao had got quite out of hand and that
something had to be done at all costs, rushed up and overpowered him, and
throwing him face downward on the ground, frog-marched him off to the stables. By
now even Cousin Zhen was being included in his mal?edictions, which became wilder
and noisier as he shouted to his captors that he wanted to go to the ancestral temple
and weep before the tablet of his old Master.
    ‘Who would ever have believed the Old Master could spawn this filthy lot of
animals?’ he bawled. ‘Up to their dirty little tricks every day. I know. Father-in-law
pokes in the ashes. Auntie has it off with nevvy. Do you think I don’t know what
you’re all up to? Oh, we “hide our broken arm in our sleeve”; but you don’t fool me.’
    Terrified out of their wits at hearing a fellow-servant utter such enormities, the
grooms and pages tied him up and stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung.
    Big Jiao’s last words had been clearly audible to Xi-feng and Jia Rong, though
they were a considerable distance away, but they both pretended not to have heard.
Bao-yu, sitting in the carriage with Xi-feng, was less inhibited.
    ‘Feng, what did he mean when he said “Father-in-law pokes in the ashes”?’
     ‘Hold your tongue!’ Xi-feng snapped back at him, livid. ‘It’s bad enough for a
person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth, but to go asking
questions about it, really! Just wait till I tell your mother! You’re going to get the
biggest hiding you’ve ever had in your life!’
     Terrified by her vehemence, Bao-yu implored forgiveness. ‘Please, Feng, don’t
tell her! I promise never to say those words again.’
     Xi-feng’s manner at once became soothing and indulgent.
     ‘That’s my good little cuzzy! When we get back I must tell Grandma to make
them explain to the school about Qin Zhong and arrange for him to be admitted
soon.’
     As they talked, the carriage bore them back into Rong-guo House. But what
happened there will be told in the chapter which follows.
CHAPTER 8



Jia Bao-yu is allowed to see the strangely
corresponding golden locket
And Xue Bao-chai has a predestined encounter
with the Magic Jade



When Bao-yu and Xi-feng were back and had seen the others, Bao-yu told
Grandmother Jia of his wish to have Qin Zhong admitted to the clan school. He
pointed out that a congenial study-companion would stimulate him to greater effort
and gave her a glowing account of Qin Zhong’s amiable qualities. Xi-feng was at hand
to lend her support. She told Grandmother Jia that Qin Zhong would be calling on her
within a day or two to pay his respects. Their infectious enthusiasm put the old lady
in a high good humour, which Xi-feng took ad?vantage of to ask if she would
accompany her to the dramatic entertainment which her opponents had promised in
two days’ time.
     In spite of her years Grandmother Jia loved any kind of excitement and when,
two days later, You-shi came to fetch Xi-feng, the old lady did in fact accompany them,
taking Lady Wang, Dai-yu and Bao-yu as well. By about noon, however, she was ready
to go back and rest, and Lady Wang, who disliked noise and excitement, took the
opportunity to leave with her. This left Xi-feng as principal guest, and she moved into
the place of honour and stayed there for the rest of the day, enjoying herself
immensely and not returning until late in the evening.
     After accompanying Grandmother Jia back to her apartment and seeing her
safely settled down for her nap, Bao-yu would have liked to go back and watch some
more plays but was afraid that his presence would be an inconvenience to Qin?shi
and his other ‘juniors’. Remembering that Bao-chai had been at home unwell during
the past few days and that he had still not been to see her, he thought he would go
there instead and pay her a call, but fearing that if he went the quickest way through
the corner gate behind the main hall he might meet with some entanglement on the
way or, worse, run into his father, he decided to go by a more circuitous route.
The maids and nurses who attended him had been expecting him to change into his
everyday clothes, but seeing him go out of the inner gate again without doing so,
followed after him, assuming that he was going back to the other mansion to watch
the plays. To their surprise, however, he turned left when he reached the covered
passage-way instead of going straight on, and made off in a north-easterly direction.
But he was out of luck, for as he did so he found himself facing Zhan Guang and Shan
Ping-ren, two of the literary gentlemen patronized by his father, who were walking
towards him from the opposite direction. They descended on him gleefully, one of
them clasping him round the waist, the other taking him by a hand.
‘Angelic boy! How seldom one has the pleasure! Is it really you, or is this some
delightful dream?’
They prattled on for what seemed an age before finally releasing him. As they were
going, one of the old nurses detained them a moment longer.
‘Have you two gentlemen just come from the Master’s?’
The two gentlemen nodded and smiled conspiratorially:
‘Sir Zheng is in his little study in the Su Dong-po Rooms, having his afternoon nap.
All is well!’
They hurried off. Bao-yu smiled too, relieved that his father was safely out of the way.
Turning once again, this time north-wards, he made his way swiftly towards Pear Tree
Court.
Once more he was unlucky. The Clerk of Stores Wu Xindeng, a man called Dai Liang
who was foreman at the granary, and five other foremen were just at that moment
coming out of the counting-house together and, catching sight of Bao-yu, at once
stood respectfully to attention. One of their number, a buyer called Qian Hua who
had not seen Bao-yu for some considerable time, hurried forward, dropped on his
right knee, and touched his hand to the ground in the Manchu salute. Bao-yu
smilingly extended a hand to raise him up. The men all relaxed in smiles.
‘I saw some of your calligraphy in town the other day, Master Bao,’ said one of
them. ‘It’s getting really good! When are you going to give us a few sheets for
ourselves, to put up on the wall?’
‘Where did you see it?’ Bao-yu asked.
‘Any number of places,’ the men told him. ‘Everyone has been praising it no end.
They even come to us asking for specimens.’
‘You can have some easily enough if you really want to,’ Bao-yu said. ‘You have only
to ask one of my boys.’
He hurried on. The men waited for him to pass before dispersing about their
business.
To omit further details of his progress, Bao-yu came at last to Pear Tree Court, and
going first into Aunt Xue’s room, found her giving instructions to her maids about
some em?broidery. Her response to his greeting was to draw him towards her and
clasp him to her bosom in an affectionate embrace.
‘What a nice, kind boy to think of us on a cold day like this! Come up on the kang
and get warm!’
She ordered a maid to bring him some ‘boiling hot tea’.
Bao-yu inquired whether Cousin Pan was at home. Aunt Xue sighed.
‘Pan is like a riderless horse: always off enjoying himself somewhere or other. He
won’t spend a single day at home if he can help it.’
‘What about Bao-chai? Is she quite better?’
‘Ah yes, of course!’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You sent someone to ask about her the other
day, didn’t you? That was very thoughtful of you. I think she’s inside. Go in and have
a look! It’s warmer in there than here. You go in and sit down, and I’ll be with you in
a moment when I’ve finished tidying up.’
Bao-yu got down from the kang and going to the doorway of the inner room, lifted
up the rather worn-looking red silk curtain which covered it. Bao-chai was sitting on
the kang inside, sewing. Her lustrous black hair was done up in a simple bun without
any kind of ornament. She was wearing a honey-coloured padded gown, a
mulberry-coloured sleeveless jacket with a pattern in gold and silver thread, and a
greenish-yellow padded skirt. All her clothing had the same sensible, rather
well-worn look about it.
    He saw no hint of luxury or show,
    only a chaste, refined sobriety;
       to some her studied taciturnity
       might seem to savour of duplicity;
but she herself saw in conformity
       the means of guarding her simplicity.
‘Have you quite recovered, cousin?’ Bao-yu asked.
Raising her head, Bao-chai saw Bao-yu enter the room. She rose quickly to her feet
and smiled at him.
‘I am quite better now. It was nice of you to think of me.’ She made him sit on the
edge of the kang and ordered Oriole to pour him some tea. Then she proceeded to
ask him first about Grandmother Jia, then about Lady Wang and then about the girls,
while her eye took in the details of his dress.
He had a little jewel-encrusted coronet of gold filigree on the top of his head and a
circlet in the form of two dragons supporting a pearl round his brow. He was dressed
in a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of russet-green material covered with a pattern
of writhing dragons and lined and trimmed with white fox-fur. A
butterfly-embroidered sash with fringed ends was fastened round his waist, and from
his neck hung a padlock-shaped amulet, a lucky charm, and the famous jade said to
have been inside his mouth when he was born.
Bao-chai’s eye came to rest on the jade.
‘I am always hearing about this famous stone of yours,’ she said smilingly, ‘but I
have never yet had a chance of examining it really closely. Today I think I should like
to have a look.’
She moved forward as she spoke, and Bao-yu too leaned towards her, and taking the
stone from his neck, put it into her hand.
Looking at it as it lay on her palm, she saw a stone about the size of a sparrow’s egg,
glowing with the suppressed, milky radiance of a sunlit cloud and veined with
iridescent streaks of colour.
Reader, you will, of course, remember that this jade was a transformation of that
same great stone block which once lay at the foot of Greensickness Peak in the Great
Fable Mountains. A certain jesting poet has written these verses about it:

Nü-wa’s stone-smelting is a tale unfounded:
On such weak fancies our Great Fable’s grounded.
Lost now, alack! and gone my heavenly stone—
Transformed to this vile bag of flesh and bone.
For, in misfortune, gold no longer gleams;
And bright jade, when fate frowns, lack-lustre seems.
Heaped charnel-bones none can identify
Were golden girls and boys in days gone by.

The words which the scabby-headed monk had incised on the stone when he found it
lying in its diminished shape under Greensickness Peak were as follows.

(On the front side)

MAGIC JADE

Mislay me not, forget me not,
And hale old age shall be your lot.

(On the reverse side)
1.Dispels the harms of witchcraft.
2.Cures melancholic distempers.
3.Foretells good and evil fortune.

    When Bao-chai had looked at the stone all over, she turned back to the
inscription on the front and repeated it a couple of times to herself out loud:


‘Mislay me not, forget me not,
And hale old age shall be your lot.’

    ‘Why aren’t you pouring the tea?’ she asked Oriole. ‘What are you standing
there gawping for?’
Oriole laughed.
‘Because those words sounded like a perfect match to the ones on your necklace.’
‘So you have an inscription, too?’ said Bao-yu pricking up his ears. ‘I must have a
look.
‘Don’t take any notice of her!’ said Bao-chai. ‘There is no inscription.’
‘Cousin, cousin,’ said Bao-yu entreatingly, ‘you’ve had a look at mine. Be fair!’
Bao-chai could not escape the logic of this entreaty.
‘There is a motto on it which someone gave us once for luck and which we had
engraved on it,’ she admitted. ‘That’s the only reason I always wear it; otherwise it
would be too tiresome to have a heavy thing like this hanging round one’s neck all
the time.’
As she was speaking she undid the top buttons of her jacket and gown and extracted
the necklace that she was wearing over the dark red shift beneath. Its pendant was a
locket of shining solid gold, bordered with sparkling gems. There was a line of writing
engraved on either side of it which together made up the words of a charm:

Ne’er leave me, ne’er abandon me:
And years of health shall be your fee.

He recited them a couple of times and then recited the word:
of his own Inscription a couple of times.
‘Why, yes!’ he cried delightedly. ‘The two inscriptions are a perfect match!’
‘A scabby-headed old monk gave Miss Bao-chai the words,’ said Oriole. ‘He said
they must be engraved on something made of gold...’
Bao-chai angrily cut her short, telling her to mind her busi?ness and pour the tea. To
change the subject she asked Bao-yu where he had just come from.
Bao-yu was now sitting almost shoulder to shoulder with her and as he did so
became aware of a penetrating fragrance that seemed to emanate from her person.
‘What incense do you use to scent your clothes with, cousin?’ he asked. ‘I have
never smelt such a delicious perfume.’
‘I can’t stand incense perfumes,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I could never see the point of
smoking perfectly good, clean clothes over an incense-pot.’
‘In that case, what is this perfume I can smell?’
Bao-chai thought for a moment.
‘I know! It must be the Cold Fragrance Pill I took this morning.’
‘What’s a Cold Fragrance Pill ?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘Won’t you give me one to
try?’
‘ Now you’re being silly again. Medicine isn’t something to be taken for
amusement.’
Just at that moment the servants outside announced ‘Miss Lin’ and almost
simultaneously Dai-yu came flouncing into the room. Catching sight of Bao-yu she let
out a wail of mock dismay.
‘Oh dear! I have chosen a bad time to come!’
The others rose and invited her to be seated.
‘Why did you say that?’ Bao-chai asked her.
‘If I had known he was coming, I shouldn’t have come myself.’
‘What exactly do you mean by that?’
‘What do I mean by that ?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I mean that if I only come when he does,
then when I don’t come you won’t have any visitors. Whereas if we space ourselves
out so that he comes one day and I come the next, it will never get either too lonely
or too noisy for you. I shouldn’t have thought that needed much explaining.’
Observing that Dai-yu was wearing a greatcoat of red camlet over her dress, Bao-yu
asked whether it was snowing outside.
‘It’s been snowing for some time,’ said one of the old women standing below the
kang.
Bao-yu asked someone to go and fetch his winter cape.
‘You see!’ said Dai-yu. ‘When I come, he has to go!’
‘Who said anything about going?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just want them to have it ready for
me.’
‘It’s no time to go now, while it’s still snowing,’ said Bao-?yu’s old nurse, Nannie Li.
‘Much better stay here and play with your cousins. In any case, I think your Aunt Xue
is getting tea ready for you. I’ll send a maid to fetch your cape. Shall I tell the boys
outside they can go?’
Bao-yu nodded, and Nannie Li went outside and dismissed the pages.
By now Aunt Xue had finished laying tea, which included a number of
delicious-looking things to eat, and invited the cousins to partake. While they were
doing so, Bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by
his Cousin Zhen’s wife that he had eaten at the Ning mansion only two days
previously. Aunt Xue at once hurried out and fetched some of her own for him to try.
‘This really needs to be eaten with wine,’ said Bao-yu.
Aunt Xue gave orders for some of the best wine to be decanted; but Nannie Li
disapproved.
‘He shouldn’t have wine, Mrs Xue.’
‘Oh go on, Nannie I’ Bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly. ‘I shall only drink one cup.’
‘It’s no good!’ said Nannie Li. ‘I don’t mind if you drink a hogshead as long as your
grandmother or your mother is there. But look at the trouble I got into the other day
just because when I had my back turned for a moment some wretched person who
ought to have known better gave you a sip or two to humour you! I didn’t hear the
end of it for days after.
‘You don’t know how wild he can be, Mrs Xue,’ she continued. ‘And he gets even
worse when he’s had something to drink. With Her Old Ladyship you can never tell.
One day when she’s feeling high-spirited she’ll let him drink as much as he likes;
other days she won’t let him touch a drop. But come what may, I’m always the one
that gets into trouble.’
‘Poor old thing!’ said Aunt Xue with a laugh. ‘Have a drink yourself and stop
worrying! I’ll see that he doesn’t drink too much. And if Lady Jia does say anything, I
shall take full responsibility? She turned to one of the maids: ‘Come on’ now! Pour
Nannie a nice warm cup of wine to keep the cold out!’
Nannie Li could scarcely sustain her objection after this and went off with the other
servants to have her drink.
‘Don’t bother to heat the wine for me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I prefer it cold.
‘Good gracious, that will never do! ‘said Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t drink wine cold, or
when you write your hand will shake!’
‘I’m surprised at you, Cousin Bao!’ said Bao-chai with a smile. ‘With all your
enthusiasm for out-of-the-way learning, fancy not knowing a thing like that! Wine
has an exceptionally fiery nature, and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be
quickly digested. If it is drunk cold, it congeals inside the body and harms it by
absorbing heat from the internal organs. From this day on you must reform! No more
cold wine!’
Dai-yu, who sat cracking melon-seeds between her teeth throughout this homily,
smiled ironically. Just at that moment her maid Snowgoose came hurrying in with a
little hand-warmer for her.
‘Who told you to bring this?’ Dai-yu asked her. ‘Very kind of them, I am sure. But I
was not actually freezing to death here.’
‘Nightingale told me to bring it, Miss. She was afraid you might be cold.’
‘I am glad you are so ready to obey her. Generally when 1 tell you to do anything it
goes in one ear and out the other; yet anything she tells you to do is followed out
more promptly than an Imperial Edict!’
Bao-yu knew perfectly well that these words were really intended for him, but made
no reply, beyond laughing good-?humouredly. Bao-chai, long accustomed to Dai-yu’s
peculiar ways, also ignored them. But Aunt Xue protested.
‘You’ve always been rather delicate and you’ve always felt the cold badly. Surely it
was nice of them to think of you?’
‘You don’t understand, Aunt,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t matter here, with you; but
some people might be deeply offended at the sight of one of my maids rushing in
with a hand-warmer. It’s as though I thought my hosts couldn’t supply one
themselves if I needed it. Instead of saying how thoughtful the maid was, they would
put it down to my arrogance and lack of breeding.’
‘You are altogether too sensitive, thinking of things like that,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Such a
thought would never have crossed my mind!’
Bao-yu had soon finished his third cup of wine and Nannie Li once more came
forward to restrain him. But Bao-yu, who was now warm and happy and in the midst
of a hilarious conversation with his cousins, was naturally unwilling to stop, and
pleaded humbly with the old lady for a reprieve.
‘Nannie darling, just two more cups and then I’ll stop!’
‘You’d better look out,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Your father’s at home today. He’ll be asking
you about your lessons before you know where you are.’
At these words all Bao-yu’s happiness drained away. Slowly he set down his cup and
bowed his head in dejection.
‘Don’t spoil everyone’s enjoyment,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Even if Uncle does call for you, you
can always say that Aunt Xue is keeping you. I think that old Nannie of yours has had
a cup too many and is looking for a bit of excitement at our expense. She gave him a
gentle nudge to encourage a more valiant spirit in him, muttering, as she did so,
‘Take no notice of the old fool! Let’s go on enjoying ourselves and not mind about
her!’
Nannie Li knew only too well what Dai-yu was capable of.
‘Now Miss Lin,’ she said, ‘don’t you go taking his part! If you encourage him he’s
only too likely to do what you say!’
Dai-yu smiled dangerously. ‘Take his part? Why should I want to encourage him? You
are over-cautious, my dear Nannie. After all, Lady Jia often lets him drink; why should
it matter if Mrs Xue lets him have a cup or two? I suppose you think he can’t be
trusted to drink here because Mrs Xue is not one of us?’
Nannie Li did not know whether to feel upset or amused. ‘Really, Miss Lin. Some of
the things you say cut sharper than a knife!’
Bao-chai could not suppress a giggle. She pinched Dai-yu’s cheek playfully.
‘Really, Miss Frowner, the things you say! One doesn’t know whether to grind one’s
teeth or laugh!’
Aunt Xue laughed too.
‘Don’t be afraid, my boy! Heaven knows I’ve got little enough to offer you when
you come to see me. You mustn’t get upset over a small thing like this, or I shall feel
quite uncomfortable. Drink as much as you like; I’ll look after you! You may as well
stay to supper, in any case; and even if you do get drunk, you can always spend the
night here.’ She told a maid to heat some more wine. ‘There! Auntie will drink a cup
or two with you, and then we shall have some supper.’
Bao-yu’s spirits began to revive a bit under his aunt’s encouragement.
‘Keep an eye on him,’ said Nannie Li to the maids. ‘I’m lust going back for a few
minutes to change my clothes.’ Then aside to Aunt Xue she said, ‘Don’t let him drink
too much, Mrs Xue!’ and went off home.
Although two or three old women still remained after her departure, none felt very
much concern for Bao-yu, and as soon as Nannie Li was out of the way they quietiy
slipped off about their own concerns, leaving, of the attendants who had come with
him, only two small maids, whose only anxiety was to please their young master by
indulging him as much as possible.
Fortunately Aunt Xue, by exercising great tact and finesse, managed to spirit the wine
away when Bao-yu had drunk only a few more cups, and to replace it with a hot, sour
soup of pickled bamboo-shoots and chicken-skin. He drank several bowls of this with
great relish and then ate half a bowl of green-rice gruel. After that, when Bao-chai
and Dai-yu had finished eating, he drank several cups of very strong tea. At this point
Aunt Xue felt sure that he would be all right.
As Snowgoose and the other maids had now finished supper too and were once
more in attendance, Dai-yu asked Bao-yu if he was ready to go. He looked at her
blearily through tired eyes.
‘If you want to go, I will go with you.’
Dai-yu rose to her feet. ‘We really ought to go. We’ve been here practically all day!’
The two of them began saying their good-byes.
A maid came forward with Bao-yu’s rain-hat and he lowered his head slightly for her
to put it on. Holding the brim of the great saucer-shaped red felt top, she jerked it up
and prepared to bring it down, aiming the inside part at his crown.
‘Stop!’ he cried impatiently.’ You have got to go easy with a great clumsy thing like
that! Haven’t you ever seen anyone putting one of these things on before? You had
better let me do it myself.’
‘Come here!’ said Dai-yu standing on the edge of the kang. ‘I’ll put it on for you!’
Bao-yu went and stood in front of her. Putting her two hands round the inner cap,
Dai-yu eased it gently down until its rim fitted over his golden headband, so that the
walnut-sized red woollen pompom of the headband was left quiver?ing outside the
cap on its flexible golden stem.
‘There!’ she said, after a few further adjustments. ‘Now you can put on your cape.’
Bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself.
‘The nurses who came with you are still not back,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Perhaps you had
better wait a bit.’
‘We wait for them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have got the maids. We shall be all right.’
But Aunt Xue was not satisfied, and ordered two of her own women to see the
cousins home.
As soon as they were back they thanked the women for their trouble and went
straight in to see Grandmother Jia, who had not yet had her supper. She was
delighted to learn that they had been with Aunt Xue, and observing that Bao-yu, had
had more than a little to drink, she told him to go and rest in his room and not come
out again, and instructed the servants to keep a careful watch over him.
Remembering which servants usually attended him, she asked what had become of
Nannie Li. The maids dared not tell her the truth, which was that she had gone
home.
‘I think she must have had something to do,’ said one of them. ‘She came in when
we did just now, but went out again almost immediately.’
‘Why worry about her ?’ said Bao-yu over his shoulder, swaying slightly as he made
his way to the bedroom. ‘She’s better looked after than you are! If it weren’t for her I
might live a few days longer!’
Inside his room he found a writing-brush and ink laid out on the desk. Skybright was
the first to greet him.
‘You’re a nice one!’ she said. ‘You made me mix all this ink for you this morning, sat
down in a state of great en?thusiasm, wrote just three characters, threw down the
brush again, rushed out, and left me waiting here all day for you to come back and
finish. Now you just sit down here and use this ink up, and perhaps I’ll let the matter
pass!’
Skybright’s words awoke in Bao-yu a recollection of the morning’s events.
‘What became of the three characters I wrote?’
Skybright laughed. ‘You’re really drunk, aren’t you! This morning before you went to
the other house you gave careful instructions that they were to be pasted up over
the outside door. I was afraid that someone else might make a mess of it, so I got up
on a ladder and spent half the morning sticking them up myself. My hands are still
numb from doing it.’
‘I’d forgotten.’ Bao-yu smiled. ‘If your hands are cold, I’ll warm them for you.’ He
took both her hands in his own and led her outside to inspect the sheet of calligraphy
newly pasted up over the doorway. Just then Dai-yu arrived.
‘I want you to tell me honestly, cousin,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Which of these three
characters do you think is the best?’
Dai-yu looked up at the three characters above the door:

RED RUE STUDY


‘They are all equally good. I didn’t know you could write so beautifully. You must do
one for me some time!’
‘You’re just saying that to humour me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Where is Aroma?’ he asked
Skybright.
Skybright shot out her lips and indicated the kang inside, on which Aroma, fully
clothed, was lying fast asleep.
‘Just look at that!’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘It’s a bit early for sleep, isn’t it?’
He turned once more to Skybright. ‘When I was having lunch at the other house
today there was a plate of bean-curd dumplings. I remembered how fond you are of
those things and asked Mrs Zhen if I could have some to eat in the evening. She had
them sent over for me. Did you get them all right?’
‘Don’t talk to me about those dumplings!’ said Skybright.
‘As soon as they arrived I realized that they must be for me, but as I’d only just
finished eating, I put them on one side meaning to eat them later. Then after a while
Nannie Li came in and caught sight of them. "I don’t expect Bao-yu will want these,"
she said. “I think I’ll take them for my grand children"; and she had them sent round
to her house.’
While Skybright was talking, Snowpink came in carrying some tea on a tray. Bao-yu
invited Dai-yu to have some, to the great merriment of the maids, who pointed out
that she had slipped away some minutes before.
After drinking about half a cupful, Bao-yu suddenly thought of the tea he had drunk
early that morning.
‘When you made that Fung Loo this morning,’ he said to Snowpink, ‘I remember
telling you that with that particular brand the full flavour doesn’t come out until after
three or four waterings. Why have you given me this other stuff? This would have
been just the time to have the Fung Loo.’
‘I was keeping it for you,’ said Snowpink, ‘but Nannie Li came and drank it all.’
With a flick of the wrist Bao-yu hurled the cup he was holding on to the floor, where
it smashed noisily, breaking into innumerable pieces and showering Snowpink’s skirt
with hot tea. He jumped angrily to his feet.
‘Is she your mistress that you should all treat her with such reverence? Merely
because I drank her milk for a few days when I was a baby she is as spoiled and
pampered as though she were some sort of divinity. Let’s get rid of the old woman
now and have done with it!’
And he strode off without more ado to tell Grandmother Jia that he wanted his old
nurse dismissed.
All this time Aroma had been only pretending to sleep, hoping by this means to
engage Bao-yu’s attention and provoke some coquetry between them. As long as the
talk dwelt on calligraphy and Skybright’s dumplings there seemed no pressing need
for her to get up; but when she heard him break a teacup and grow really angry she
hurriedly rose to her feet and intervened to restrain him.
By this time someone had arrived from Grandmother Jia’s room to inquire what all
the noise was about. Aroma pre?tended that she had smashed the cup herself by
slipping on some snow while fetching tea. Having disposed of the inquirer, she then
proceeded to exhort Bao-yu.
‘Dismiss her by all means, if you really want to! But we could all like to leave with
her; so while you are about it, why not make a clean sweep and dismiss the lot of us?
I am sure you will find plenty of other good servants to replace us with.’
Bao-yu had nothing to say to this, and Aroma and the rest helped him onto the kang
and started undressing him. He kept trying to tell them something as they did so, but
an object seemed to impede his tongue and his eyelids were growing increasingly hot
and heavy. Soon the maids had him lying down between covers. Aroma took off the
‘Magic jade’, wrapped it in a piece of silk, and slipped it under the quilt, so that it
should not be cold on his neck the next morning. By this time Bao-yu was already
asleep, having dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow.
While this was going on, Nannie Li and the other old women had arrived back at last.
Learning that Bao-yu was drunk, they dared not approach him and soon went off
again, having satisfied themselves by whispered exchanges that he was safely asleep.

*

Bao-yu awoke next morning to hear someone announcing that ‘Master Rong from
the other house’ had brought Qin Zhong over to pay his respects. Bao-yu hurried out
to re?ceive them and conducted Qin Zhong into the presence of Grandmother Jia.
Observing that Qin Zhong’s good looks and gentle demeanour admirably qualified
him to become Bao-yu’s study-companion, Grandmother Jia was pleased, and made
him stay for tea and then dinner, after which she sent him to be introduced to Lady
Wang and the rest. Everybody loved Qin-shi and was delighted to meet this charming
younger brother, and there were First Meeting presents from everybody waiting for
him when he left. Grandmother Jia’s was an embroidered purse enclosing a little God
of Literature in solid gold to signify that literary success was in the bag’.
‘Since your home is so far away,’ she said to Qin Zhong as he was leaving, ‘the
weather may sometimes make it incon?venient for you to go back at night. In that
case, do please stay here with us! And mind that you always keep with your Uncle
Bao and don’t go getting into mischief with those young ragamuffins at the school!’
Qin Zhong received these admonitions with deference and then went home to report
on the day’s events to his father.
Qin Zhong’s father, Qin Bang-ye, was one of the Secretaries in the Public Buildings
Department of the Board of Works and a man in his middle sixties. He had lost his
wife early, and finding himself still childless at the age of fifty, had adopted a boy and
a girl from an orphanage. The boy had died, leaving only the girl Ke-er, or ‘Ke-qing’ as
she was more elegantly renamed, who had grown up into an extremely charming and
vivacious young woman and been married into the Jia family, with whom her
adoptive father had long had a con?nection.
Qin Bang-ye fathered Qin Zhong when he was fifty-three and the boy was now
twelve years old. His tutor had returned south the year before, and he had been
revising old lessons at home ever since. Qin Bang-ye had himself been on the point of
speaking to his daughter’s in-laws about the possibility of getting Qin Zhong admitted
into the Jia clan school as an external scholar when the happy accident of Qin
Zhong’s meeting with Bao-yu occurred. Bang-ye knew of Jia Dai-ru, the master in
charge of the school, as one of the leading elder scholars of the day, under whose
tutelage there would be every hope of Qin Zhong’s making rapid strides in his
education and eventually obtaining an advancement. He was therefore delighted that
the matter had been so easily con?cluded.
There was only one difficulty. Knowing the sort of style in which the Jias lived,
Bang-ye realized that he would have to dip deeply into his pocket, and his official
salary left that pocket only meagrely supplied. However, since this was a matter
which concerned the whole future of his son, there was nothing for it but to strain
his credit to the utmost. By borrowing a bit here and a bit there he was able to get
to?gether a sum of twenty-four taels of silver which he made up into a packet and
laid reverently before Jia Dai-ru when he took Qin Zhong to the old teacher’s house
to make his kotow. Nothing now remained but for Bao-yu to choose an aus?picious
day on which the two of them could begin school together.
Their entry into the school was the occasion of a tumultuous incident of which an
account will be given in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 9
A son is admonished and Li Gui receives
an alarming warning
A pupil is abused and Tealeaf throws the
classroom in an uproar



In the last chapter we left Qin Bang-ye and his son waiting for a message from the Jia
household to tell them when Qin Zhong was to begin school. Bao-yu was impatient
to see Qin Zhong again and sent word to say that it was to be the day after next.
When the appointed day arrived, Bao-yu rose in the morning to find that Aroma had
already got his books, brushes and other writing materials ready for him and was
sitting disconsolately on the side of his bed. Seeing him get up, she roused herself
and helped him to do his hair and wash. He asked her the cause of her despondency.
     ‘What’s upset you this time, Aroma? I can’t believe you are worried about being
left alone while I am at school.’
     ‘Of course not!’ said Aroma with a laugh. Learning is a very good thing. Without
it you would fritter all your life away and never get anywhere. I only hope that you’ll
see to it that you are learning when you are meant to be and that, when you are not,
you will be thinking about home and not getting into scrapes with the other boys;
because then you would be in real trouble with your father. And though you talk a lot
about the need for effort and self-improvement, it would really be better to do too
little work than too much. For one thing you don’t want to bite off more than you
can chew; and for another you don’t want your health to suffer. At least, that’s how it
seems to me, so you mustn’t mind my saying so.’
      Each time Aroma paused, Bao-yu answered ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. She continued:
      ‘I have packed your big fur gown for the pages to take. Mind you put it on if you
find it cold at the school. It won’t be like here, where there is always someone else to
think of these things for you. I’ve also given them your foot-warmer and your
hand-warmer. You’ll have to see that they give the charcoal a stir from time to time.
They’re such a lazy pack of good-for-nothings, they’ll be only too pleased to do
nothing if you don’t stand over them. You could freeze to death for all they cared.’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know how to do it myself. And don’t go getting
gloomy, all of you, cooped up here while I am away. Try to spend as much time as you
can with my Cousin Lin.’
His dressing was now completed and Aroma urged him to begin his visits to
Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng and Lady Wang. After a few parting instructions to
Skybright and Musk, he went off to his grandmother’s, where he had to listen to
more admonitions, then on to Lady Wang’s, and then outside to the study to see his
father, Jia Zheng.
Jia Zheng was in conversation with his literary gentlemen when Bao-yu entered the
room and made his salutation. Hear?ing him announce that he was off to school to
resume his studies, Jia Zheng smiled sarcastically.
‘I think you had better not use that word “studies” again in my hearing, unless you
want to make me blush for you. In my opinion you might just as well be left to fool
around as before, since that is all you seem fit for. At all events, I don’t want you here.
I find your presence in a place like this con?taminating.’
The literary gentlemen rose to their feet with nervous laughter.
‘Come, come, Sir Zheng! You are too hard on him! Two or three years from now our
young friend will be carrying all before him! He has left his old, childish ways behind
him now –haven’t you boy? Quite reformed. Come!’—two of the older men took
Bao-yu by the hands and hurried him from the room—’I am sure it must be time now
for your breakfast. To breakfast! To breakfast!’
Jia Zheng asked who was in attendance on Bao-yu. There was a ringing ‘Sir!’ from
outside, and three or four strapping fellows entered the study and saluted Manchu
fashion. Jia Zheng recognized the foremost one as Li Gui, the son of Bao-yu’s old
wet-nurse, Nannie Li, and addressed himself to him.
‘You have attended Bao-yu during all his lessons in the past. What precisely has he
been doing? Stuffing his head with worthless nonsense and acquiring a fine new
stock of knavish tricks, I shouldn’t wonder! Wait until I have a little time to spare: I’ll
have your hide off first and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing son of
mine!’
‘Sir!’
Li Gui sank terrified to his knees, snatched off his cap, and knocked the ground
several times with his forehead.
‘Master Bao has read the first three books of the Poetry Classic, sir, up to the part
that goes

                          Hear the happy bleeding deer
Grousing in the vagrant meads…

That’s the truth, sir. I wouldn’t tell a lie.’
This novel version of the well-known lines provoked a roar of laughter from the
literary gentlemen. Even Jia Zheng could not restrain a smile,
‘If he read thirty books of the Poetry Classic,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘it would still be
tomfoolery. No doubt he hopes to deceive others with this sort of thing, but he does
not deceive me. Give my compliments to the Headmaster and tell him from me that I
want none of this trifling with the Poetry Classic or any other ancient literature. It is
of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly understand and learn by heart
the whole Four Books before he attempts anything else.’
‘Sir!’
Seeing that Jia Zheng had nothing more to say, Li Gui and the other servants rose to
their feet again and withdrew.
All this time Bao-yu had been waiting for them in the courtyard outside, scarcely
daring to breathe. As they came out, dusting their knees, Li Gui said,
‘Did you hear that, young master? “Have my hide off first” he said. Some people’s
servants are respected for their masters sakes, but not us. All we get is beatings and
hard words. So spare a thought for us in future, will you?’
‘Don’t be upset, old chap!’ said Bao-yu. Tomorrow I’ll treat you all.’
‘Little ancestor,’ Li Gui replied, ‘nobody’s looking for treats. All we ask is that once
in a while—just once in a while—you should do what you are told.’
They were now back at Grandmother Jia’s apartment. Qin Zhong had already arrived
and was engaged in conversation with the old lady. As soon as the two friends had
greeted each other they took their leave.
Bao-yu suddenly remembered that he had not yet seen Dai-?yu and hurried to her
room to say good-bye. He found her by the window making herself up at the mirror.
Her answer to his announcement that he was off to begin school was smiling but
perfunctory:
‘Good. I wish you every success. I’m sorry I can’t see you off.’
‘Wait till I get back and have had my supper, cousin,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and I will give
you a hand with that rouge.’
He chatted with her for quite a bit longer before finally tearing himself away. As he
was going she suddenly called after him so that he stopped:
‘Aren’t you going to say good-bye to your cousin Bao-chai?’
Bao-yu smiled but said nothing and went straight off to school with Qin Zhong.



*

The Jia clan school was situated at no great distance from Rong-guo House. It was a
charitable foundation which had been established many years previously by the
founder of the family and was designed for the sons and younger brothers of those
members of the clan who could not afford to pay for private tuition. All members of
the clan holding official posts were expected to contribute towards its expenses and
mem?bers of advanced years and known integrity were chosen to be its masters. As
soon as Bao-yu and Qin Zhong arrived they were introduced to the other students
and then set to work at once on their lessons.
From now on the two friends were inseparable, arriving at school and leaving school
together and sitting beside each other in class. Grandmother Jia herself became very
fond of Qin Zhong. She was always having him to stay for three or four nights at a
time and treated him exactly as if he were one of her own great-grandchildren. And
because she realized that his family was not very well off, she frequently helped out
with clothes and the like. Within a month or two he was a familiar and accepted
member of the Rong household.
Bao-yu had always been impatient of social conventions, preferring to let sentiment
rather than convention dictate the terms of his relationships. It was this which now
prompted him to make Qin Zhong the following proposal:
‘You and I are schoolmates and pretty much the same age. Let us in future forget all
this “uncle” “nephew” business and address each other exactly like friends or
brothers!’
Qin Zhong was at first too timid to comply; but as Bao-yu persisted and went on
calling him ‘brother’ or ‘Jing-qing’ (which was his school-name) whenever he spoke
to him, Qin Zhong himself gradually fell into the habit of addressing Bao-yu as an
equal.
All the pupils at the clan school were either members of the Jia clan or relations by
marriage; but as the proverb rightly says, ‘there are nine kinds of dragon and no two
kinds are alike’. Where many are gathered together the wheat is sure to contain a
certain amount of chaff; and this school was no exception in numbering some very
ill-bred persons among its pupils.
The two new boys, Qin Zhong and Bao-yu, were both as beautiful as flowers; the
other scholars observed how shrinking and gentle Qin Zhong was, blushing almost
before you spoke to him and timid and bashful as a girl; they saw in Bao-yu one
whom nature and habit had made humble and accommodating in spite of his social
position, always willing to defer to others in the interest of harmony; they observed
his affectionate disposition and familiar manner of speech; and they could see that
the two friends were devoted to each other. Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that
these observations should have given rise to certain suspicions in the minds of those
ill-bred persons, and that both in school and out of it all kinds of ugly rumours should
have circulated behind their backs.
When Xue Pan learned, some time after moving into his aunt’s place in the capital,
that the establishment included a clan school plentifully stocked with young males of
a certain age, his old enthusiasm for ‘Lord Long-yang’s vice’ was re?awakened, and
he had hastened to register himself as a pupil. His school-going was, needless to say,
a pretence—‘one day fishing and two days to dry the nets’ as they say—and had
nothing to do with the advancement of learning. Having paid a generous fee to Jia
Dai-ru, he used his membership of the school merely as a means of picking up
‘soul-mates’ from among his fellow-students. It must with regret be recorded that a
surprisingly large number of the latter were deluded into becoming his willing victims
by the prospect of receiving those ample advances of money and goods which he
was in a position to offer.
Among them were two amorous young creatures whose names and parentage
escape us but who, because of their glamorous looks and affected manners, were
universally known by the nicknames of ‘Darling’ and ‘Precious’. Although their
fellow-students much admired them and entertained towards them feelings not at all
conducive to that health of mind which the Young Person should at all times
endeavour to cultivate, they were deterred from meddling with them for fear of what
Xue Pan might do.
When Qin Zhong and Bao-yu joined the school it was only to be expected that they
too should fall under the spell of this charming pair; but like the rest they were
inhibited from overt declaration of their feelings by the knowledge that Xue Pan was
their ‘friend’. Their feelings were reciprocated by Darling and Precious, and a bond of
mutual attraction grew up be?tween the four, which nevertheless remained
unexpressed, except for the significant looks that every day passed between them
across the classroom, or the occasional rather too loud utterance to a neighbour of
some remark really intended for the ears of the opposite pair.
     They were persuaded that these cryptic communications had escaped the notice
of their fellows; but they were wrong. Certain young hooligans among their
classmates had long since discerned the true nature of what was going on, and while
the two handsome couples were engaged in their silent and (as they thought) secret
communion, these others would be winking and leering behind their backs or
becoming suddenly convulsed with paroxysms of artificial coughing.
It happened that one day Jia Dai-ru was called home on business and left the class
with the first half of a fourteen word couplet to complete, telling them that he would
be back on the morrow to take them over the next passage in their reading and
putting his eldest grandson Jia Rui in charge of the school during his absence. Xue
Pan had by now stopped coming in even for roll-call, and so on this occasion he too
was out of the way. The opportunity was too good to miss, and Qin Zhong and
Darling, after a preliminary exchange of glances, both asked to be excused and went
round to the rear courtyard to converse.
‘Does your father mind what friends you have?’ Qin Zhong had got no further than
this question when there was a cough behind them. The two boys spun round and
saw that it came from their classmate ‘Jokey’ Jin. Darling had a somewhat impetuous
nature which now, fired by a mixture of anger and shame, caused him to round
sharply on the intruder.
‘What’s that cough supposed to mean? Aren’t we allowed to talk if we want to?’
Jokey Jin leered: ‘If you’re allowed to talk, aren’t I al?lowed to cough if I want to?
What I’d like to know is, if you’ve got something to say to each other, why can’t you
say it out openly? Why all this guilty secrecy? But what’s the good of pretending? It’s
a fair cop. You let me in on your game and I won’t say anything. Otherwise there’ll be
trouble!’
With furious blushes the other two protested indignantly that they did not know
what he was talking about.
Jokey Jin grinned. ‘Caught you in the act, didn’t I?’ He began to clap his hands and
chant in a loud, guffawing voice,

                          ‘Bum-cake!
                          Bum-cake!
                          Let’s all have a
                          Bit to eat!’

Angry and indignant, Qin Zhong and Darling hurried back into the classroom and
complained to Jia Ruj that Jokey Jin was persecuting them.
This Jia Rui was a spineless, unprincipled character who, as a means of obliging the
boys to treat him, always displayed the most shameless favouritism in his settlement
of class-room disputes. In return for money, drinks, and dinners, he had lately given
Xue Pan a free hand in his nefarious activities—had, indeed, not only refrained from
interfering with him, but even ‘aided the tyrant in his tyranny’.
Now Xue Pan was very inconstant in his affections, always blowing east one day and
west the next. He had recently abandoned Darling and Precious in favour of some
newly discovered sweetheart, just as previously he had abandoned Jokey Jin in
favour of Darling and Precious. It followed that in this present confrontation Jia Rui,
to his chagrin, could not hope to gain any rewards by the exercise of his usual
par?tiality. Instead of blaming this vexatious state of affairs on Xue Pan’s fickleness,
however, he directed all his resentment against Darling and Precious, for whom he
felt the same unreasonable jealousy as motivated Jokey Jin and the rest.
Qin Zhong’s and Darling’s complaint at first put Jia Rui in somewhat of a quandary,
for he dared not openly rebuke Qin Zhong. He could, however, give his resentment
outlet by making an example of Darling; so instead of dealing with his complaint, he
told him that he was a trouble-maker and followed this up with so savage a
dressing-down that even Qin Zhong went back to his seat humiliated and crestfallen.
Jokey Jin, now thoroughly cock-a-hoop, wagged his head and tutted in a most
provoking manner and addressed wound?ing remarks to no one in particular, which
greatly upset Darling and Precious for whose ears they were intended. A furious
muttered altercation broke out between them across the intervening desks. Jokey Jin
insisted that he had caught Qin Zhong and Darling in flag rante delicto.
‘I ran into them in the back courtyard, kissing each other and feeling arses as plain
as anything. I tell you they had it all worked out. They were just measuring
themselves for size before getting down to business.’
Reckless in his hour of triumph, he made these wild al?legations, unmindful of who
might hear them. But one heroic soul was moved to mighty anger by his wanton
words. This was Jia Qiang, a member of the Ning-guo branch of the family of the
same generation as Jia Rong. He had lost both his parents when a small child and
been brought up by Cousin Zhen. At sixteen he was even more handsome and
dashing than Jia Rong and the two youths were inseparable friends.
     Any establishment as large as the Ning household always contains a few
disgruntled domestics who specialize in tra?ducing their masters, and a number of
disagreeable rumours concerning Jia Qiang did in fact begin to circulate among the
servants which seem to have reached the ears of Cousin Zhen, for, partly in
self-defence (since they involved him too), he moved Jia Qiang out of the house and
set him up in a small establishment of his own somewhere in the city.
     Jia Qiang possessed a very shrewd brain under his daz?zlingly handsome exterior
His attendance at the school, however, was no more than a blind to his other
activities, principal among which were cock-fighting, dog-racing, and botanizing
excursions into the Garden of Pleasure; but with a doting Cousin Zhen to protect him
on the one hand and Jia Rong to aid and comfort him on the other, there was no one
in the clan who dared thwart him in anything he did.
Since Qin Zhong was the brother-in-law of his best friend, Jia Qiang was naturally
unwilling to stand by and see him abused in so despiteful a manner without doing
anything to help. On the other hand he reflected that there would be certain
disadvantages in coming forward as his cham?pion.
‘Jokey Jin, Jia Rui, and that lot are all friends of Uncle Xue,’ he thought. ‘For that
matter, I’m a friend of Uncle Xue myself. If I openly stick up for Qin Zhong and they go
and tell old Xue, it’ll make things rather awkward between us. On the other hand, if I
don’t interfere at all, Jokey Jin’s rumours are going to get quite out of hand. This calls
for a stratagem of some kind which will shut the little beast up without causing too
much embarrassment afterwards.’
Having thought of a plan, he pretended that he wanted to be excused, and slipping
round to the back, quietly called over Bao-yu’s little page Tealeaf and whispered a
few inflammatory words in his ear.
Tealeaf was the most willing but also the youngest and least sensible of Bao-yu’s
pages. Jia Qiang told him how Jokey Jin had been bullying Qin Zhong. ‘And even
Bao-yu came in for a share,’ he said. ‘If we don’t take this Jin fellow down a peg, next
time he is going to be quite insufferable.’
Tealeaf never needed any encouragement to pick a fight, and now, inflamed by Jia
Qiang’s message and open incitement to action, he marched straight into the
classroom to look for Jokey Jin. And there was no ‘Master Jin’ when he saw him,
either: it was ‘Jin! Who do you think you are?’
At this point Jia Qiang began to scrape his boots on the floor and make a great
business of straightening his clothes and glancing out of the window at the sky,
muttering to himself as he did so, ‘Ah, yes. Hmn. Must be about time.’ Going up to Jia
Rui, he informed him that he had an engagement which necessitated his leaving early,
and Jia Rui not having the courage to stop him, allowed him to slip away.
Tealeaf had by now singled out Jokey Jin and grabbed him by the front of his jacket.
‘Whether we fuck arseholes or not,’ he said, ‘what fucking business is it of yours?
You should be bloody grateful we haven’t fucked your dad. Come outside and fight it
out with me, if you’ve got any spunk in you!’
‘Tealeaf!’ Jia Rui shouted agitatedly. ‘You are not to use such language in here!’
Jokey Jin’s face turned pale with anger.
‘This is mutiny! I don’t have to take this sort of thing from a slave. I shall see your
master about this’ —and he shook himself free of Tealeaf and made for Bao-yu,
intending to seize and belabour him.
As Qin Zhong turned to watch the onslaught, he heard a rushing noise behind his
head and a square inkstone launched by an unseen hand sailed past it and landed on
the desk oc?cupied by Jia Lan and Jia Jun.
Jia Lan and Jia Jun belonged to the Rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same
generation as the other Jia Lan, the little son of Li Wan and nephew of Bao-yu. Jia Jun
had lost his father in infancy and was doted on by his widowed mother. Jia Lan was
his best friend, which is why they always sat next to each other in school. Though Jia
Jun was among the youngest in the class, his tiny body contained an heroic soul. He
was extremely mischievous and completely fearless. With the impartial interest of an
observer he had watched a friend of Jokey Jin’s slyly aim the inkstone at Tealeaf; but
when it fell short and landed right in front of him on his own desk, smashing a
porcelain water-bottle and showering his books with inky water, his blood was up.
‘Rotten swine!’ he shouted. ‘If this is a free-for-all, here goes!’ and he grabbed at
the inkstone intending to send it sailing back. But Jia Lan was a man of peace and
held it firmly down.
‘Leave it, old chap! It’s none of our business,’ he coun?selled.
Jia Jun was not to be restrained, however. Deprived of the inkstone, he picked up a
satchel full of books and raising it in both hands above his head, hurled it in the
direction of the assailant. Unfortunately his body was too small and his strength too
puny for so great a trajectory, and the satchel fell on the desk occupied by Bao-yu
and Qin Zhong. It landed with a tremendous crash, scattering books, papers,
writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing Bao-yu’s teabowl to
smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about. Nothing daunted, Jia
Jun leaped out and rushed upon the thrower of inkstones to smite him.
Meanwhile Jokey Jin had found a bamboo pole which he flailed around him: a
terrible weapon in so confined and crowded a space. Soon Tealeaf had sustained a
blow from it and was bawling for reinforcements from outside. There were three
other pages in attendance on Bao-yu besides himself, all equally inclined to mischief.
Their names were Sweeper, Ploughboy and Inky. With a great shout of ‘To arms! To
arms! Down with the bastards!’ these three now came rushing like angry hornets
into the classroom, Inky wielding a door-bar which he had picked up and Sweeper
and Ploughboy brandishing horsewhips.
Jia Rui, in a frenzy of outraged authority, hopped from one to the other, alternately
grabbing and cajoling, but none would take the slightest bit of notice. Disorder was
now general. The more mischievous of the scholars mingled glee-fully in the fray, safe,
in the general scrimmage, to land punches at chosen foes without fear of discovery
or reprisal. The more timid crawled into places of safety. Others stood on their desks,
laughing and clapping their hands and cheering on the combatants. The classroom
was like a cauldron of still water that had suddenly come to the boil.
Li Gui and the other older servants, hearing the uproar from outside, now hurried in,
and by concerted shouting eventually managed to call the boys to a halt. Li Gui asked
them what they were fighting about. He was answered by a medley of voices, some
saying one thing and some another. Unable to make sense of what he heard, he
turned his attention to Tealeaf and the other pages, cursing them roundly and
turning them out of the room.
Qin Zhong had fallen an early victim to Jokey Jin’s pole, sustaining a nasty graze on
the head which Bao-yu was at this very moment mopping with the flap of his gown.
Seeing that Li Gui had succeeded in restoring some kind of order, he asked to be
taken away.
‘Pack up my books, Li Gui, and fetch the horse, will you? I am going to tell
Great-uncle Dai-ru about this. We were shamefully insulted, and because we didn’t
want to start a quarrel, we went along in a perfectly polite and reasonable manner
and reported the matter to Cousin Rui. But instead of doing anything about it, he
gave us a telling-off, stood by while someone called us filthy names, and actually
encouraged them to start hitting us. Naturally Tealeaf stuck up for us when he saw
we were being bullied. What would you expect him to do? But they all ganged up on
him and started hitting him, and even Qin Zhong’s head was cut open. We can’t go
on studying here after this.’
Li Gui tried to calm him.
‘Don’t be hasty, young master! Your great-uncle has gone home on business and if
we go running after him to pester him about a little thing like this, he’ll think we
don’t know how to behave. If you want my advice, the proper way to settle this affair
is by dealing with it here, where it started. Not by rushing off and upsetting your poor
old uncle.’ He turned to Jia Rui. ‘This is all your fault, Mr Rui, sir. While your granfer is
away you are the head of the whole school and everyone looks to you to set an
example. If anyone does anything they shouldn’t, it’s up to you to deal with it—give
them a hiding, or whatever it is they need. Not sit by and let matters get out of hand
to this extent.’
‘I did tell them to stop,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but they wouldn’t listen.’
‘If you don’t mind my saying so,’ said Li Gui, ‘it’s because you’ve been to blame
yourself on past occasions that these lads won’t do what you tell them to now. So if
this business today does get to the ears of your grandfather, you’ll be in trouble
yourself, along of all the rest. If I were you, sir, I should think of some way of sorting
this out as quickly as possible.’
‘Sort it out nothing!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m definitely going to report this.’
‘If Jokey Jin stays here,’ wailed Qin Zhong tearfully, ‘I’m not studying in this school
any longer.’
‘There is no earthly reason to talk about leaving this school,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have
as much right to come here as anyone else. When I’ve explained to everyone exactly
what happened, Jokey Jin will be expelled.
‘Who is this Jokey Jin, any way?’ he asked Li Gui.
Li Gui thought for a moment.
‘Better not ask. If I told you, it would only make for more unpleasantness.’
Tealeaf’s voice piped up from outside the window:
‘He’s the nephew of Mrs Huang on the Ning-guo side. Trash like that trying to scare
us! I know your Auntie Huang, Jokey Jin! She’s an old scrounger. I’ve seen her down
on her knees in front of our Mrs Lian, begging for stuff so that she could go out and
pawn it. What an aunt! I’d be ashamed to own an aunt like that!’
Li Gui shouted at him furiously.
‘Detestable little varmint! Trust you to know the answer and spread your poison!’
Bao-yu sniffed contemptuously.
‘So that’s who he is! The nephew of Cousin Huang’s wife. I’ll go and speak to her
about this.’
He wanted to go straight away, and called to Tealeaf to come inside and pack up his
books.
‘No need for you to go, Master Bao,’ said Tealeaf as he swaggered in triumphantly
to do his bidding. ‘Let me go for you and save you the trouble. I’ll just say that Lady
Jia wants a word with her, hire a carriage, and bring her along myself. Then you can
question her in front of Lady Jia.’
Li Gui was furious.
‘Do you want to die? If you’re not careful, my lad, when we get home I’ll first thrash
the living daylights out of you and then tell Sir Zheng and Lady Wang that Master Bao
was put up to all this by your provocation. I’ve had trouble enough as it is trying to
get these lads calmed down a bit without needing any fresh trouble from you. It was
all of your making, this rumpus, in the first place. But instead of thinking about ways
of damping it down, you have to go throwing more fat on the fire.’
After this outburst Tealeaf was at last silent.
Jia Rui was by now terrified lest the matter should go any further and his own far
from clean record be brought to light. Fear made him abject. Addressing Qin Zhong
and Bao-yu in turn, ‘he humbly begged them not to report it. At first they were
adamant. Then Bao-yu made a condition:
‘All right, we won’t tell. But you must make Jokey Jin apologize.’
At first Jokey Jin refused, but Jia Rui was insistent, and Li Gui added his own
persuasion:
‘After all, it started with you, so if you don’t do what they say, how are we ever
going to end it?’
Under their combined pressure Jokey Jin’s resistance at last gave way and he locked
hands and made Qin Zhong a bow. But Bao-yu said this was not enough. He insisted
on a kotow. Jia Rui, whose only concern now was to get the matter over with as
quickly as possible, quietly urged him to comply:
‘You know what the proverb says:
He who can check the moment’s rage
Shall calm and carefree end his days.’
Did Jokey Jin comply? The following chapter will reveal.
CHAPTER 10
Widow Jin’s self-iinterest gets the better of her
righteous indignation
And Doctor Zhang’s diagnosis reveals the origin
of a puzzling disease



Outnumbered, and hard pressed by Jia Rui to apologize, Jokey Jin made a kotow to
Qin Zhong, whereupon Bao-yu agreed to let the matter drop. Back in his own home,
when school was over, he brooded with mounting anger on his humiliation.
‘Qin Zhong is Jia Rong’s brother-in-law: it’s not as if he were one of the Jia clan. He’s
only an external scholar, the same as me; and it’s only because he is friends with
Bao-yu that he can afford to be so high and mighty. Well, in that case he ought to
behave himself, then no one would have any cause to complain. But he’s always
carrying on in such a sneaky, underhand way with Bao-yu, as though he thought the
rest of us were all blind and couldn’t see what he was up to. And now today he’s
started making up to someone else and I happen to have found him out. So what if
there were a row about this? I’ve got nothing to be afraid of.’
His mother, Widow Jin, overheard his muttering.
‘What have you been getting up to this time ?’ she asked. ‘Look at the job we had
getting you into that school. All the talks I had with your aunt and the trouble she
went to to see Mrs Lian about it. Suppose we hadn’t had their help in getting you in
there, we could never have afforded a tutor. What’s more, you get free tea and free
dinners there, don’t you? That has meant a big saving for us during the two years you
have been going there. And you’re glad enough to have some?thing decent to wear
out of the money saved, aren’t you? And another thing. If you hadn’t been going to
that school, how would you ever have met that Mr Xue of yours? Between seventy
and eighty taels of silver we’ve had out of him during this past year. I can tell you this,
my boy. If you get yourself thrown out of there, you needn’t think you can get in
anywhere else, because you could easier fly to the moon than find another place like
that. Now you just play quietly for a bit and then go to bed like a good boy!’
Thus admonished, Jokey Jin swallowed his anger and fell silent. Before long he went
to bed and to sleep, and next day was back at the school again as usual. Of him no
more.



*
Jokey Jin’s aunt was married to one Jia Huang, a member of the Jia clan in the same
generation as Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian. It goes without saying, of course, that not all
members of the clan lived in the sort of style maintained by the Ning and Rong
households. Jia Huang and his wife had only the income from a very small property
to live on, and it was only by dint of frequent visits to the Ning and Rong mansions,
where their flattering attentions on Wang Xi-feng and You-shi earned them an
occasional subsidy, that they were able to make ends meet.
Today the weather was fine and sunny and Mrs Huang had nothing particular to do at
home, so taking an old serving-woman with her, she got into a cab and went off to
pay a call on her sister-in-law and nephew.
In the course of conversation Widow Jin soon got on to the subject of yesterday’s
affair in the schoolroom and launched into a full account, from which no detail was
omitted, of all those happenings. It would have been as well for her if she had not
done so, for the effect was to kindle a dangerous anger in the bosom of her
sister-in-law.
‘That little beast Qin Zhong!’ said Mrs Huang. ‘He may be related to the Jias, by
marriage, but then so is your boy. What business has he to go throwing his weight
about like that, I should like to know? Especially after the disgusting things he had
been doing himself. Considering what he’d been up to, even Bao-yu ought not to
have sided with him to that extent. Let me go and see Mrs Zhen about this. I shall ask
her to let me have it out with Qin Zhong’s sister and see if we can’t get some
satisfaction.’
‘Oh dear, I shouldn’t talk so much! I never meant to tell you this. Please, my dear, I
beg of you not to speak to them about it! Never mind the rights and wrongs of the
case, if this all gets out, they will make it too hot for my boy to stay on at the school;
and if he had to stop going to the school, we should never be able to afford a tutor
for him, quite apart from all the extra expense I should have of feeding him during
the day.’
‘Never mind about all that!’ said Mrs Huang. ‘We’ll worry about that after I’ve
spoken to them and seen what happens.’
Dismissing her sister-in-law’s entreaties, she sent the old servant-woman out for a
cab, and getting inside, drove straight off to the Ning-guo mansion. But by the time
she had reached it, driven in at the east end gate, dismounted from the carriage and
gone in to see You-shi, the edge had already worn off her anger, and it was only after
deferential inquiries about the health and comfort of her hostess and various other
in-consequential matters that she got around to asking what had become of Qin-shi,
who was usually in evidence during her visits.
‘I don’t know what’s the matter with her lately,’ said You?-shi. ‘It’s been more than
two months now since she had a period, yet the doctors say she isn’t pregnant. And
during the last few days she’s been getting so tired and listless in the afternoons:
doesn’t feel like doing anything; doesn’t even feel like talking; all the spirit seems to
have gone out of her. I’ve said to her, “Never mind about wifely duties. Just forget
about the morning and evening visits and concentrate on getting better. Even when
relations call,” I said, “I can see to them myself. And never mind what the older
members of the family might say: I’ll do all the explaining for you.” I’ve spoken to
Rong, as well. “You’re not to tire her out,” I told him, “and you’re not to let her get
upset! She must just rest quietly for a few days and look after herself. And if there’s
anything she fancies to eat, just come to my apartment to get it. Because if anything
should happen to her,” I said, “you wouldn’t find another wife like that, with her
looks and her good nature, if you took a lantern to look for her.” She’s such a sweet
person, there isn’t anyone among our relations or among the older members of the
family who doesn’t love her. I’ve been so worried on her account these last few days.
And just to make matters worse, first thing this morning her young brother comes
along—Silly little boy! he ought to have realized that his sister wasn’t well and not in
a condition to listen to such things, even if he’d suffered ten thousand times the
injustice!—It seems that yesterday there was a fight at the school. One of the
external students—I don’t know which one it was—had been bullying him; and there
were a lot of other very nasty things as well. So he had to go and tell all this to his
sister. Well, you know how sensitive she is, my dear, in spite of the fact that she
always seems so lively and full of fun to talk to. The slightest little thing can upset her
and set her brooding on it for whole days and nights together. In fact, this illness has
been brought on by too much worrying, I’m sure of it. Well, this morning when she
heard that someone had been bullying her brother, it both upset her and at the same
time made her angry. She was upset to think that those horrible boys at the school
should be able to twist things round and say such ter?rible things about him, but she
was also angry with him, because she said he must have been getting into bad ways
and not giving his mind properly to his studies to have got into trouble of this sort in
the first place. So of course, because of this upset she wouldn’t have any breakfast.
I’ve just been round there trying to calm her. I gave her brother a talking-to and sent
him round to see Bao-yu, and I stood over her while she ate half a bowlful of
bird’s-nest soup. I’ve only just this minute got back. Oh, I’m so worried about her, my
dear! We haven’t got a good doctor at the moment, either. It pierces me to the heart
when I think about that child’s illness! I suppose you don’t happen to know of a good
doctor, do you?’
Mrs Huang’s determination to have things out with Qin-shi, of which she had boasted
so valiantly at her sister-in-law’s, had, in the course of this outpouring, fled to the far
kingdom of Java. She hastened to own that she knew of no good doctor.
‘But hearing what you have said about this illness,’ she added, ‘I can’t help
wondering if it may not after all be preg?nancy. You want to be careful they don’t
give her the wrong treatment. If they give her the wrong treatment for that, there
will be real trouble!’
‘I know,’ said You-shi. ‘That’s what I say.’
While they were still talking, Cousin Zhen came in from outside. ‘Isn’t this Cousin
Huang’s wife?’ he asked You-shi, catching sight of the visitor. Mrs Huang dropped him
a curtsey and a ‘how-do-you-do’. ‘You must ask our cousin to dinner,’ he said, going
on into the room beyond.
The original object of Mrs Huang’s visit had of course been to complain to Qin-shi
about Qin Zhong’s treatment of her nephew. Hearing of Qin-shi’s illness she had
abandoned all thought of even mentioning the subject; and now that Cousin Zhen
and You-shi were being so nice to her, her anger grad?ually gave way to pleasure, and
after gossiping a while longer she went off home.
When she had gone, Cousin Zhen came in again and sat down.
‘What did she come about today?’ he asked You-shi.
‘Oh,’ said You-shi, ‘nothing in particular. When she first came in she appeared to be
upset about something or other, then after we’d been talking for some time and I
mentioned that Rong’s wife was ill, she gradually calmed down. When you invited her
to dinner she knew she couldn’t very well stay on with sickness in the house and left
after chatting a few minutes longer. She didn’t ask for anything before she went.
     ‘But let’s talk about that child’s illness. The thing is, you really must find a good
doctor to look at her, before it gets too late. This lot we have around the house at
present are com?pletely useless! Each one of them just listens to what you say and
then gives it back to you with a few learned words thrown in. And they’re so terribly
conscientious about it! We have three or four of them coming by turns every day,
and some?times they’ll take her pulse four or five times in the same day. Then they
have long discussions while they decide on a prescription. None of the medicine does
her any good, and the only consequence of all this is that she is having to change her
clothes four or five times in a day and be constantly getting up and sitting down to
see these doctors, which is no good at all for a person in her condition.’
     ‘Oh, she’s a silly child!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘There’s no need for all this dressing
and undressing. Suppose she caught a chill on top of this other illness, that would be
really frightful. Never mind about the clothes, for goodness’ sake, however good they
are! It’s the child’s health that matters. Who cares if she has to have a completely
new outfit every day? We can afford it.
‘What I was going to tell you is that I’ve just had a visit from Feng Zi-ying. He
noticed that something was bothering me, and when he asked me what it was I
explained that our daughter-in-law isn’t well and told him how worried we are
because we haven’t got a decent doctor who can tell us for sure whether it’s
pregnancy or disease, so that we don’t even know how serious it is. Then Feng
Zi-ying told me about a scholar friend of his called Zhang You-shi. He and Feng were
at school together. He is a man of very wide learning including, apparently, an
excellent knowledge of medicine and the ability to tell with certainty whether a
disease is curable or not. He’s up at the capital this year to purchase a place for his
son and is at present staying in Feng Zi-ying’s house. It looks as if in his hands she
might stand a good chance of getting better. Anyway, I’ve already sent someone
round with my card and and asked him to call. It’s getting a bit late for him to come
today, but he should definitely be round tomorrow. Feng Zi-ying promised to see him
when he got back and put in a word for me to make quite sure that he agrees to
come. So we’ll just have to wait and see what this Dr Zhang says.’
You-shi was delighted with this news.
‘And what are we going to do about Father’s birthday?’ she asked. ‘It’s the day
after tomorrow.’
‘I’ve just been out to see him,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘and I took the opportunity while I
was there of asking him if he would come over on his birthday to receive everyone’s
kowtows, but he refused. He said, “I’ve got used to the peace and quiet of the
monastery and I’m not willing to go back into your quarrelsome world again. If you
insist on celebrating my birthday it would be a hundred times better to have my tract
on Divine Rewards written out by a good calligrapher and cut on blocks for printing
than to drag me back to your house for a lot of senseless head-knocking.” He said, “If
the family turn up tomorrow and the day after for my birthday, you can give them a
party yourself. But don’t go sending me any presents,” he said, “and don’t come
yourself! If it will set your mind at zest you can give me a kotow now and get it over
with. But if you come round here the day after tomorrow with a lot of other people
to pester me, I shall refuse to see you.” Well, after that I obviously can’t go again on
his birthday. We’d better have Lai Sheng in and make arrangements for two days’
entertainment.’
You-shi called in Jia Rong.
‘Tell Lal Sheng to prepare the usual two-day party for Grandfather,’ she said. ‘Say
we want a really good spread. We shall be asking Lady Jia.and Sir Zheng and Lady
Wang and your Auntie Lian from the other house: you can go round yourself to invite
them.
‘And by the way: today your father heard of a good doctor and has already sent
someone to ask him round. He should be coming tomorrow. When he does, you had
better tell him exactly what your wife’s symptoms have been during the past few
days.’
Jia Rong promised to carry out his mother’s instructions and left the room,
encountering, as he did so, the youth who had been sent to Feng Zi-ying’s house to
request a call from the doctor. He had just got back from delivering his message and
reported to Jia Rong as follows:
‘I took the Master’s card to the doctor at Mr Feng’s house and asked him to call. He
said Mr Feng had already spoken to him about it, but he had been out visiting all day
and only just got back and he simply didn’t have the energy to go out any more today.
He said, “Even if I were to go round to your house now I shouldn’t be able to take the
young lady’s pulse. It would take me all night to get my breathing regulated.
However,” he said, “I shall definitely call round tomorrow.” And he said, “My
knowledge of medicine is really too slight for a consultation of this importance, but
as your master and Mr Feng are so pressing, I obviously cannot refuse. But I hope you
will explain this to your master.” And he said, “As for your master’s card, that is an
honour I really cannot accept”; and he made me bring it back. Will you please pass
on this message for me, Master Rong?’
Jia Rong turned and went back into the room to tell his parents. Going out once more,
he summoned Lai Sheng and gave instructions for preparing a two-day birthday party,
which Lai Sheng duly proceeded to put into operation. But of that no more.
About noon next day one of the servants at the gate came in to report:
‘The Dr Zhang you sent for has arrived, sir’.
Cousin Zhen went out to receive the doctor and con?ducted him into the main
reception room, where they both sat down. He waited until the doctor had taken tea
before broaching the subject of his visit.
‘Yesterday Mr Feng was telling me about your great learning,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I
gather that it includes a pro?found knowledge of medicine. I assure you I was very
much impressed.’
‘I am only a very indifferent scholar,’ replied Dr Zhang, ‘and my knowledge is really
extremely superficial. However, Mr Feng was telling me yesterday of the courteous
and con?siderate patronage of scholars which is traditional in your family, so when I
received your summons I felt unable to refuse. I must insist, though, that I am
entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all
too soon become apparent.’
‘My dear sir, you are altogether too modest,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Do you think I
could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-in-law? We are relying on
your superior knowledge to put us out of our uncertainty.’
He left the doctor in the charge of Jia Rong, who conducted him through the inner
part of the house to his own apartment, where Qin-shi was.
‘Is this the lady?’ asked the doctor.
‘Yes, this is my wife,’ Jia Rong replied. ‘Do sit down! I ex?pect you would like me to
describe her symptoms first, before you take the pulse?’
‘If you will permit me, no,’ said the doctor. ‘I think it would be better if I took the
pulse first and asked you about the development of the illness afterwards. This is the
first time .I have been to your house, and as I am not a skilled practitioner and have
only come here at our friend Mr Feng’s insistence, I think I should take the pulse and
give you my diagnosis first. We can go on to talk about her symptoms and discuss a
course of treatment if you are satisfied with the diagnosis. And of course, it will still
be up to you to decide whether or not the treatment I prescribe is to be followed.’
‘You speak with real authority, doctor,’ said Jia Rong. ‘I only wish we had got to hear
of you earlier. Take her pulse now, then, and let us know whether what she has can
be cured, so that my parents may be spared further anxiety.’
At this point Qin-shi’s women carried in a large arm-rest of the kind used in
consultations, propped her forward with her arms across it, and drew back her
sleeves, exposing both arms at the wrist. The doctor stretched out his hand and laid
it on her right wrist, then, having first regulated his own breathing in order to be able
to count the rate, he felt the pulses with great concentration for the space of several
minutes, after which he transferred to the left wrist and spent an equal amount of
time on that. This done, he proposed that they should withdraw to the outside room
to talk.
Jia Rong accompanied him outside and sat with him on the kang. An old woman
served tea, which Jia Rong invited the doctor to take, waiting until he had done so
before asking him for his diagnosis.
‘Tell me, doctor, from your reading of my wife’s pulse, do you think she can be
cured?’
‘Well, the lower left distal pulse is rapid and the lower left median pulse is strong
and full,’ said the doctor. ‘On the right side, the distal pulse is thin and lacks strength
and the median pulse is faint and lacks vitality.
‘Now, a rapid lower left-hand distal pulse means that a malfunction of the
controlling humour of the heart is causing it to generate too much fire; and the
strong lower median pulse means that the liver’s humour is blocked, giving rise to a
deficiency of blood. A thin, weak distal pulse on the right side indicates a gross
deficiency of humour in the lungs; and a faint right median pulse lacking in vitality
shows that the earth of the spleen is being subdued by the woody element of the
liver.
‘If the heart is generating fire, the symptoms should be ir?regularity of the menses
and insomnia. A deficiency of blood and blockage of humour in the liver would result
in pain and congestion under the ribs, delay of the menses beyond their term, and
burning sensations in the heart. A deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise
to sudden attacks of giddiness, sweating at five or six in the morning, and a sinking
feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat. And if the earth of the spleen
is being subdued by the wood of the liver, she would undoubtedly experience loss of
appetite, lassitude, and general enfeeblement of the whole body. If my reading of the
lady’s pulse is correct, she ought to be showing all these symptoms. Some people
would tell you they indicated a pregnancy, but I am afraid I should have to disagree.’
‘You must have second sight, doctor!’ said one of the old women, a body-servant of
Qin-shi’s who was standing by. ‘What you have said exactly describes how it is with
her; there is no need for us to tell you anything more. Of all the doctors we’ve lately
had around here to look at her none has ever spoken as much to the point as this.
Some have said she’s expecting; others have said it’s illness; one says it’s not serious;
another only gives her till the winter solstice; not one of them tells you anything you
can really rely on. Please doctor, you tell us: just how serious is this illness ?’
‘I am afraid my colleagues have allowed your mistress’s condition to deteriorate,’
said the doctor. ‘If she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning, when
she first started her courses, there is every reason to suppose that she would by now
be completely cured. But the illness has been neglected for so long now, this
breakdown was almost bound to happen. I would say that with proper treatment she
has about a one in three chance of recovery. We shall just have to see how she
responds to my medicine. If, after taking it, she can get a good night’s sleep, her
chances will be distinctly better: say fifty?-fifty.
‘From my reading of her pulse, I should expect your mistress to be a very highly
strung, sensitive young woman. Sometimes, when people are over-sensitive, they
find a good deal that is upsetting in what goes on around them; and of course, if
things are upsetting them, they will tend to worry a lot. This illness has been caused
by too much worry affecting the spleen and causing an excess of wood in the liver,
with the result that the menstrual blood has been prevented from flowing at the
proper times. If we were to ask your mistress about the dates of her courses, I am
sure we should find that they tended to be on the late side, isn’t that so?’
‘Absolutely right,’ the old woman replied. ‘Her periods have never been early.
Sometimes two or three days late, sometimes as much as ten days: but in any case,
always late.’
‘You see!’ said the doctor. ‘There is the cause of the trouble. If she could have been
treated in time with something to fortify the heart and stabilize the humours, she
would never have got into this present state. What we have now, I am afraid, is an
advanced case of dehydration. Well, we shall have to see what my medicine can do
for her.’
He wrote out the following prescription and handed it to Jia Rong:

For a decoction to increase the breath, nourish the heart, fortify the spleen and calm
the liver

R
    Ginseng 2 drams
    Atractylis (clay-baked)    2 drams
    Lycoperdon 3 drams
    Nipplewort (processed) 4 drams
    Angelica 2 drams
    White peony root       2 drams
    Hemlock parsley 1? drams
    Yellow vetch root3 drams
    Ground root of nutgrass 2 drams
    Hate’s ear (in vinegar)    ? dram
    Huaiqing yam 2 drams
    Dong E ass’s glue (prepn with powdered oyster-shell)    2 drams
    Corydalis (cooked in wine) 1? drams
    Roast liquorice ? dram
Adjuvant: Excoriate and remove pits from 7 lotus-seeds;
Item 2 large jujubes.
‘Most impressive!’ said Jia Rong, glancing at the pre?scription. ‘Tell me, though,
doctor: just how serious is this illness? Is her life in danger?’
The doctor smiled. ‘You are an intelligent young man, Mr Jia. When an illness has
reached this stage, it is not going to be cured in an afternoon. We must see how she
responds to medication. As I see it, there is no real danger this winter. I should say
that if she can get past the spring equinox, you could look forward to a complete
recovery.’
Jia Rong was intelligent enough to understand the real import of what the doctor was
telling him and did not question him further. Having first seen him out, he went in to
show the prescription and written summary of the diagnosis to Cousin Zhen and gave
both his parents a full account of what the doctor had said.
‘No other doctor has ever spoken so convincingly,’ said You-shi, turning to Cousin
Zhen. ‘I am sure his medicine will do her good.’
Cousin Zhen smiled complacently.
‘This man is no medical hack practising for a living,’ he said. ‘It’s only because Feng
Zi-ying is such a good friend of mine that he could be persuaded to come and see us.
Perhaps with a man like this treating her our daughter-in-law stands some chance of
getting better. I see there is ginseng in that prescription, by the way. You can use
some of that pound of high-grade ginseng we bought the other day.’
     Seeing that they had no more to say, Jia Rong went out and ordered the drugs
for Qin-shi’s medicine to be purchased and prepared. But you will have to read the
next chapter if you want to know what effect the medicine had on her when she had
taken it.
CHAPTER 11

Ning-guo House celebrates the birthday
of an absent member
And Jia Rui conceives an illicit passion
for his attractive cousin

Jia Jing’s birthday had now arrived. Cousin Zhen packed sixteen lacquer gift-boxes
with the rarest and choicest deli?cacies and instructed Jia Rong to take a number of
domestics with him and deliver them to Jia Jing. He was to observe carefully whether
or not his grandfather was pleased, and having made his kotow, was to deliver the
following message:
‘Because of your request, Father has not ventured to visit you himself. Instead he
will place himself at the head of the entire family and lead them in prostrating
themselves in your direction.’
Having received his father’s instructions, Jia Rong mus?tered his band of servants and
set out.
Back at home visitors gradually began to arrive. Jia Lian and Jia Qiang were the first.
Having inspected the various seating arrangements, they inquired whether there was
to be entertainment of some kind.
‘The Master had originally been reckoning on old Sir Jing coming here today,’ said
one of the servants, ‘so he didn’t arrange for any entertainment. But the day before
yesterday he learned that Sir Jing would not be coming, so he asked us to find a
troupe of actors and a band. They are at present on the stage in the garden getting
ready for the performance.’
Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and Bao-yu arrived next and were welcomed
and conducted inside by Cousin Zhen and You-shi. You-shi’s mother was already there.
She was introduced to the new arrivals, who were then invited to sit down and were
served by Cousin Zhen and You-shi with tea.
‘We realize,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘that Lady Jia is a generation older than Father.
Father is only her nephew, of course, and strictly speaking it wasn’t correct form to
invite a person of her age at all. Nevertheless, since the weather is so fresh and nice
just now and the chrysanthemums in the garden at their best, we had rather hoped
that she might enjoy coming over for a bit and having all her children and
grandchildren around her. That was our only motive in asking her. I’m sorry she
decided not to honour us.’
‘Up to yesterday,’ Xi-feng put in hurriedly, not waiting for Lady Wang to reply,
‘Grandmother had been intending to come. Then yesterday evening she saw Bao-yu
eating some peaches and the greedy old thing couldn’t resist trying one herself. She
only ate about two thirds of a peach, but she had to get up twice running in the early
hours, and this morning she still felt rather poorly and told me to tell you that she
definitely wouldn’t be able to come. But she said that if you have any specially nice
things to eat she would like one or two kinds to try; only they must be soft and easy
to digest.’
Cousin Zhen smiled with pleasure.
‘Well, that’s all right then. Knowing how much Grandma enjoys a bit of fun, I
thought it didn’t seem like her not to come today unless she had some good reason
for not coming.’
‘The other day Xi-chun was telling us that Rong’s wife is not very well,’ said Lady
Wang. ‘What exactly is wrong with her?’
‘It’s a very puzzling illness,’ You-shi replied. ‘At Mid-Autumn last month, when she
got back from playing cards half the night with you and Lady Jia, she seemed
perfectly all right. But from the twentieth onwards she seemed to get more and
more tired and listless every day—too tired even to eat. She’s been like that for more
than a fortnight now, and it is two months since she had a period.’
‘Couldn’t she be expecting?’ said Lady Xing.
They were interrupted by a servant from outside:
‘Sir She and Sir Zheng and all the other gentlemen have arrived, sir. They are in the
main reception room.’
Cousin Zhen hurried out.
‘To begin with that’s what some of the doctors told us,’ said You-shi, resuming the
conversation; ‘but yesterday Feng Zi-ying introduced a doctor friend of his to us who
is terribly good, someone he went to school with, and he said that she wasn’t
expecting at all. He said she was suffering from a serious illness. He wrote a
prescription for her yesterday and she has already had one dose of the medicine.
Today her giddiness is a bit better, but everything else is still pretty much the same.’
‘There!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I thought it must be something quite serious to keep her
away, especially on a day like this. I know she would have forced herself to come if
she could have done.’
‘You remember you saw her here on the third,’ said You-shi. ‘She had a terrible
struggle to keep going on that occasion. It was only because the two of you have
always been so close and she didn’t want to miss you that she made the effort.’
Xi-feng’s eyes became moist and for a moment she was too overcome to speak.
‘I know “the weather and human life are both unpredic?table”,’ she said at last,
‘but she’s only a child still. If anything should happen to her as a result of this illness, I
think all the fun would go out of life!’
While she was speaking Jia Rong came in, and having greeted in turn first Lady Xing,
then Lady Wang, and then Xi-feng, he turned to his mother:
‘I’ve just delivered the food to Grandfather, and I told him that Father was
entertaining all the men of the family at home and had not presumed to visit him
because of what he said. Grandfather was very pleased. He said “That is exactly as it
should be.” He said I was to tell you and Father to see that my great-uncles and
great-aunts are properly looked after, and he told me that I was to look after my
uncles and aunts and cousins. He also said he wanted the blocks for Divine Rewards
to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution.
I’ve already given this message to Father. Now I’ve got to hurry off again to look after
the gentlemen while they have their dinner.’
‘Rong, just a moment!’ said Xi-feng as he was going. ‘How is it really with your
wife?’
Jia Rong’s brows contracted in a worried frown.
‘She’s not at all well, Auntie. You’ll know what I mean when you see her presently.’
He left without saying any more.
‘Well, ladies!’ said You-shi. ‘Will you have dinner in here, or shall we eat in the
garden? There are some actors in the garden preparing an entertainment.’
‘In here would be all right, wouldn’t it?’ said Lady Wang with a glance in Lady Xing’s
direction.
You-shi at once gave orders to her women to serve. There was an answering cry from
outside the door and a great flurry of domestics each bustling about her own
contribution to the meal. In no time at all the table was laid and dinner ready. You-shi
made Lady Xing and Lady Wang sit at the head with her mother, while she, Xi-feng
and Bao-yu sat at the two sides.
Lady Xing and Lady Wang politely protested that they had come to offer birthday
felicitations, not to eat a birthday feast.
‘Yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘After all these years of spiritual self-improvement, Uncle must by
now be practically an Immortal. And with Immortals, as we all know, “it’s the thought
that counts and not the ceremony”.’
The others all laughed.
You-shi’s mother, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng, having finished their meal,
rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands, had just announced their intention
of going into the garden, when Jia Rong came in with a message for his mother.
‘My great-uncles and all the other gentlemen have just finished their dinner.
Great-uncle She says he has business at home, and Great-uncle Zheng doesn’t like
plays because he says he can’t stand the noise; but all the others have gone with
Uncle Lian and Cousin Qiang to watch the players.
‘People have come with cards and birthday presents from the Prince of An-nan, the
Prince of Dong-ping, the Prince of Xi-ning, the Prince of Bei-jing, the Duke of
Zhen-guo and five others of the Niu clan and the Marquis of Zhong-jing and seven
others of the Shi clan. The presents have all been received at the counting-house.
They have been entered in the gift-book, and the people who brought them have
been issued with thank-you cards. They have also been tipped the usual amounts and
given a meal before leaving.
‘And Father says will you please bring the great-aunts and Grandmother You and
Auntie Feng to the garden now.’
‘Yes, we’ve finished too,’ said You-shi. We were about to come over when you
arrived.’
‘Aunt Wang,’ said Xi-feng, ‘may I go and see Rong’s wife first? I can go on to the
garden from there.’
‘Certainly. You ought to go,’ said Lady Wang. ‘In fact, we should all like to go with
you, but I am afraid it would be too much excitement for her. Please give her our
love.’
‘My dear,’ said You-shi, ‘I know she will always do any-thing you ask her to. See if
you can talk her into a more cheerful frame of mind. It would be such a relief to me if
you could. But join us in the garden as soon as you can!’
Bao-yu asked if he could go with Xi-feng to see Qin-shi.
‘Yes,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She is your nephew’s wife. I think you should. Just look in for
a moment, though, and then join the rest of us.’
Thereupon You-shi invited Lady Wang, Lady Xing and old Mrs You to accompany her
to the All-scents Garden, while Xi-feng and Bao-yu accompanied Jia Rong to Qin-shi’s
room.
Entering the door of the apartment, they tiptoed softly into the inner room. As soon
as she saw them, Qin-shi attempted to rise, but Xi-feng would not let her.
‘No, no, don’t get up!’ she said. ‘You will make yourself giddy.’
In two rapid strides she was at her side and holding her by the hand.
‘My dearest child! It’s only a few days since last I saw you, but look how thin you
have grown!’
She sat down beside her on the quilt on which she sat propped. Bao-yu, after
greeting her, sat in a chair opposite.
‘Pour out some tea,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Auntie Feng and Uncle Bao didn’t get any after
their dinner.’
Qin-shi grasped Xi-feng’s hand and forced a smile to her wan face.
‘It looks as though I wasn’t meant to be happy, Auntie!’ she said. ‘This is such a
lovely family to have married into. Rong’s parents treat me as if I were their own
daughter. Rong may be young, but he respects me, and I respect him; there has never
been a cross word between us. You, it goes without saying—but not only you, all the
older members of the family—have always been goodness itself to me. I did so want
to he worthy of all this kindness. But now this wretched illness has come along and
taken away the chance. Now I shall never be able to be a good daughter to Rong’s
parents; and however badly I want to, I shall never be able to repay any of the love
you have shown me. I have a feeling inside me, Auntie: I don’t think I am going to last
the year out.’
Bao-yu had been studying the ‘Spring Slumber’ painting on Qin-shi’s wall all this time
and re-reading the couplet by Qin Guan on the scrolls at each side of it:
The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream;
The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents.

As he did so, the memory returned of that earlier afternoon when he had slept in
that very same room and dreamed about the Land of Illusion. He was musing on the
contents of that dream when he suddenly became aware of the words that Qin-shi
was saying. They pierced his heart like the points of a thousand arrows. Great tears
welled up in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks. Xi-feng, seeing him, was herself
deeply affected; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make Qin-shi even more
distressed, whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up, she
rallied him lightly on his tears.
‘Don’t be such a baby, Bao-yu! It’s not really that serious: sick people always say
things like that. Besides, she’s still young, and when you are young you can shake an
illness off in no time at all. --- You mustn’t let yourself think such stupid things,’ she
said, turning to Qin-shi. ‘You’ll make yourself worse.’
‘If only she could get a bit of food inside her.’ said Jia Rong. ‘That’s her real trouble:
she won’t eat anything.’
‘Bao,’ said Xi-feng, ‘your mother told you not to stay long. If you’re going to be like
this, you will only upset her, and in any case I expect your mother is beginning to
wonder about you—You go on ahead with Uncle Bao,’ she said to Jia Rong. ‘I am
going to sit a little longer with your wife.’
     Jia Rong at once led Bao-yu away to join the others in the All-scents Garden,
while Xi-feng addressed some words of encouragement to Qin-shi, after which,
dropping her voice to a murmur, she engaged in a long and intimate conversation
with her, ignoring two or three messages from You-shi urging her to join the party. At
last she felt unable to stay any longer.
‘Look after yourself!’ she said. ‘I shall come again. I feel sure that you are meant to
get better. It can’t have been an accident that they found that doctor the other day;
and now that you’ve got him, there’s really nothing to worry about.’
Qin-shi smiled.
‘Even if he’s a miracle-man, Auntie, “death’s a sickness none can cure”, and I know
that it’s just a question of time now.’
‘If you will go on talking like that, how can you possibly get better?’ said Xi-feng. ‘If
only you would try to look on the bright side. Remember what the doctor said. He
said that if you weren’t being properly treated, next spring would be dangerous for
you. If this were a household which couldn’t afford things like ginseng for your
treatment, you might have something to worry about. But now they know that you
can be cured, there’s nothing Rong’s parents wouldn’t do and nothing they couldn’t
afford to do for you. Never mind two drams of ginseng a day; if you needed two
pounds a day, they would get it for you gladly. So do try and get better! I must go
over to the garden now.’
‘Forgive me for not being able to see you out, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi. ‘Please come
again when you are free. We’ll have a nice talk together, just the two of us.’
There were tears in Xi-feng’s eyes as she promised to come often, whenever she was
free. Then, followed by the women who had accompanied her from the Rong
mansion and a number of female domestics belonging to the Ning household, she
made her way round to one of the side gates leading into the gardens.
        Golden chrysanthemums covered the open spaces;
        Silvery willow-trees bordered the water’s margins.
    The little bridge arched its span over a storied stream;
    The winding path made its way into a fairy hill.
        Crystal rills tinkled amidst the rocks.
        A quickset hedge recalled preautumnal fragrances.
        Crimson leaves fluttered upon the boughs.
        A wintry copse described calligraphic traceries.
        In the cold wind’s more insistent blast
        The oriole’s cry could still be heard.
        In the late sun’s more infrequent warmth
        The cricket’s chirp a while revived.
        At the far south-east end
    Pavilions nestled in artificial mountains.
    On the near north-west side
    Verandahs brooded on circumjacent waters.
    Music of little organs playing in the summer-house
    Increased the melancholy in the air.
    Glimpses of women’s dresses flitting through the little wood
    Enhanced the delicacy of the scene.

Xi-feng was making her way through the garden, admiring the view as she went,
when a figure suddenly stepped out from behind an artificial hill of rock and made its
way towards her:
‘How are you, cousin?’
Xi-feng gave a start of surprise and retreated a step.
‘Isn’t it Cousin Rui?’
‘Don’t you even know who I am, cousin?’
‘It isn’t that I don’t know you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but you did come up rather suddenly
and I wasn’t expecting to see you here.’
‘We must have been fated to meet, cousin,’ said Jia Rui. ‘I had just slipped away
from the party to take a little stroll in these peaceful surroundings. I never expected
to meet my fair cousin here, but lo! So there must be a bond.’
He ogled her as he spoke with a fixed and meaningful stare.
Xi-feng’s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little
game he was playing, and feigning an interest she did not feel, she answered him
with a smile.
‘I can see why Lian is always speaking so highly of you. From seeing you today and
just hearing you speak those few words I can tell at once that you are an intelligent,
good-natured sort of person. At the moment I’m on my way to join my aunts, and I’m
afraid that I can’t stay and talk to you. Perhaps we could meet some other time when
we are both free?’
      ‘I should like to call on you when you are at home,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but I suppose a
young person like your good self is not in a position to receive visitors of the other
sex.’
      Xi-feng feigned a laugh.
      ‘We’re all one family—all one flesh and blood. I don’t see that age comes into it.’
      Jia Rui was secretly delighted by this encouragement.
      ‘I never dreamed today would bring a chance like this my way,’ he thought, and
the goatish eagerness of his expression grew even more repellent.
      ‘You had better hurry back to the party,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If they catch you playing
truant, you will find yourself being sconced!’
      Jia Rui was by now scarcely in command of his own person. Slowly, very slowly
he walked away, frequently turning back to gaze at Xi-feng as he did so. Xi-feng
mischievously pro?voked him by deliberately slowing down the pace of her own
progress through the garden.
     ‘What an odious creature!’ she thought to herself when there was some distance
between them. ‘Appearances certainly are deceptive! Who would have guessed he
was that sort of person? Well, if he is, he had better look out! One of these days I’ll
settle his hash for him; then perhaps he will realize what sort of person he is up
against!’
     Xi-feng had resumed a normal pace and had just skirted the foot of a little hill,
when she saw two or three old serving-women hurrying towards her in a state of
great agitation.
     ‘Oh, Mrs Lian,’ said one of the old women with a smile, when they caught sight
of her, ‘our mistress has been getting into such a state because you didn’t come!
She’s sent us to fetch you.’
    ‘Just like your mistress!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Always in a lather about something or
other!’ and she sauntered on quite un?concernedly, talking to the old woman as she
went.
    ‘How many pieces have they done so far?’
    ‘Eight or nine,’ the old woman replied.
    By this time they had arrived at the rear entrance of the two-storey Celestial
Fragrance Pavilion, where they found Bao-yu playing with a group of maids.
    ‘Mind you don’t make a nuisance of yourself, Bao,’ said Xi-feng.
    ‘Lady Xing and Lady Wang are sitting upstairs watching,’ said one of the maids.
‘You can get up there from this side, madam.’
    Lifting up her skirts, Xi-feng climbed slowly up the stairs. She found You-shi
standing at the top waiting for her.
    ‘You are an affectionate pair!’ said You-shi with a smile. ‘Once the two of you
meet, there’s no separating you. Tomorrow you had better move in with her and set
up house together! Come on, sit down! I’m going to drink a cup of wine with you!’
    Xi-feng asked her two aunts for permission to sit. When she had done so You-shi
held out the playbill and invited her to make a choice.
    ‘It’s not for me to choose when Mother and Aunt Wang are here,’ said Xi-feng.
    ‘Go ahead and choose!’ said Lady Xing. ‘Mrs You and your aunt and I have
already chosen a number of plays. Now you pick out one or two good ones for us!’
    Xi-feng politely rose to thank her, and taking the playbill from You-shi, scanned it
through and picked out two of the items listed: one a scene from The Return of the
Soul and the other ‘Gai-nian Plays His Guitar’ from The Palace of Eternal Youth.
    ‘If they do these two after they have finished singing this scene from Faithful
Bi-lian,’ she said, handing the playbill back to You-shi, ‘I think that will be just about
enough for the day.’
      ‘I’m sure it will,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We ought in any case to break up early, so that
our hosts can get a good night’s rest. They have had a lot on their minds lately.’
      ‘It isn’t often that you both come to see us,’ said You-shi.
      ‘Please stay as long as you can. It will be so much more fun. It’s really quite early
yet.’
‘Where have all the gentlemen gone to?’ inquired Xi-feng, who had got up from her
seat and was peering down into the lower storey.
‘They have gone off to the Frozen Sunlight Gallery to drink,’ said one of the old
women in attendance. ‘They left only a moment ago. They’ve taken the band with
them.’
‘What was wrong with this place?’ said Xi-feng, ‘Heaven knows what they can be
getting up to behind our backs!’
‘We can’t all be as strait-laced as you are,’ said You-shi with a laugh.
As they laughed and chattered together, the actors even?tually finished performing
the second of the two pieces Xi?-feng had selected, whereupon the wine was
removed from the tables and rice served. When they had finished their meal, the
company retired to the main reception room indoors and took tea there, after which
carriages were called for and the other ladies took their leave of old Mrs You. You-shi
stood at the head of all the concubines and female domestics of the Ning household
to see them outside, while Cousin Zhen at the head of the junior male members of
his family stood beside the waiting carriages.
‘You must come again tomorrow, ladies,’ said Cousin Zhen to Lady Xing and Lady
Wang as they emerged from the house.
‘I think not,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We have sat here the whole day being entertained
and we are all rather tired now. I think tomorrow we should like a rest.’
Jia Rui was staring fixedly at Xi-feng throughout this exchange.
After Cousin Zhen had gone indoors again, Li Gui led out a horse and Bao-yu
mounted on its back and rode off behind Lady Wang’s carriage. Cousin Zhen and the
other males then sat down to supper and, when it was over, the party broke up. Next
day there was another day of feasting for the members of the clan, particulars of
which, however, we omit from our record. We shall confine ourselves to observing
that from that day on Xi-feng paid frequent calls on Qin-shi. Sometimes her illness
seemed slightly better for a day or two, sometimes it seemed slightly worse. Cousin
Zhen, You-shi and Jia Rong were acutely worried.

*
Jia Rui made several visits to the Rong mansion, but all his calls seemed to coincide
with Xi-feng’s visits to the Ning mansion to see Qin-shi.
The thirtieth day of the eleventh month, the day of the winter solstice, arrived. It was
the turn of the season, and for several days before it Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang
and Xi-?feng had been sending messengers daily to inquire after Qin shi. Each time
the report they brought back was the same:
‘She hasn’t got any worse these last few days, but she doesn’t seem to be very
much better.’
‘At this time of year,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it’s a hopeful sign if an illness like hers
doesn’t get any worse.’
‘Oh I do hope so!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That sweet child! If anything should
happen to her, it would break my heart.’
A wave of bitterness passed over her.
‘You and she have always been good friends,’ she said turning to Xi-feng.
‘Tomorrow is the “First of the Last”. Go and see her again some time after tomorrow.
Have a very careful look and try to find out exactly how she is. If she seems a bit
better, come and tell me when you get back. And if there is anything the dear child
has ever fancied eating in the past, see that she is kept constantly supplied with it.’
Xi-feng promised to do as she had said, and on the second day of the next month she
went over to the Ning-guo man?sion as soon as she had finished her breakfast.
Qin-shi’s sickness appeared to be no worse than previously, but the flesh on her face
and body was pitifully wasted. Xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her, and once
more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness.
‘We shall know the worst when the spring comes,’ said Qin-shi. ‘At least I’ve got
past the solstice without anything happening, so perhaps I shall get better. Give
Grandma and Auntie Wang my regards, won’t you. I’ve eaten one or two bits of that
yam-cake with the date stuff inside that Grand?ma sent me yesterday. I found it quite
easy to digest.’
‘I’ll send you some more tomorrow,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I must go and see your
mother-in-law, and after that I have to hurry back and give my report on you to
Grandma.’
‘Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my love, Auntie.’
‘I will,’ said Xi-feng, and left her.
She went into You-shi’s reception room and sat down.
‘Tell me honestly,’ said You-shi. ‘What did you think of her?’
Xi-feng sat silent for some time with lowered head.
‘There’s no hope, is there? You’ll have to start getting things ready for the end. Of
course, it’s always possible that doing so may break the bad luck.’
‘I’ve already been quietly making a few preparations on the side,’ said You-shi. ‘The
only thing we haven’t yet got is the right timber {or the you know what. But we’re
looking round all the time.
Xi-feng had some tea and chatted a while longer with You-shi. Then she said:
‘I must hurry back to report to Grandma.’
‘Break it to her gently,’ said You-shi. ‘You don’t want to give her a shock, at her age.’
‘Of course,’ said Xi-feng, and rising to her feet went straight back home and called
on Grandmother Jia.
‘Rong’s wife asked me to give you her regards, Grandma. She sends you a kotow
and she says she feels somewhat better. She begs you not to worry about her. And
she says that when she’s made a bit more progress she’s going to come over to see
you and make you a kotow in person.’
‘How did you think she seemed?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘For the time being there doesn’t seem to be anything much to worry about,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘She seems to be in quite good spirits.’
For a long time the old lady brooded in silence. Then, remembering Xi-feng, she told
her to change her clothes and rest a while.
Xi-feng said yes, she would, and after calling on Lady Wang, went back to her own
apartment, where Patience had warmed her everyday clothes for her to change into.
When she had changed, she sat down and asked Patience if anything had happened
during her absence.
‘Nothing, really,’ said Patience, handing her some tea. ‘Brightie’s wife came with
the interest on the three hundred taels of silver and I received it for you. Oh, and Mr
Rui sent someone to ask if you were in. He wants to pay you a call and talk about
something.’
Xi-feng snorted.
‘Horrible creature! he seems to be looking for trouble. Just let him come, then!’
‘What does Mr Rui want?’ asked Patience. ‘Why does he keep coming like this?’
In reply Xi-feng gave her a full account of her encounter with him in the garden of the
Ning-guo mansion and of the things he had said to her on that occasion,
‘What a nasty, disgusting man!’ said Patience. ‘A case of “the toad on the ground
wanting to eat the goose in the sky”. He’ll come to no good end, getting ideas like
that!’
‘Just wait till he comes! ‘ said Xi-feng. ‘I know how to deal with him.’
But if you wish to know the outcome of Jia Rui’s visit, you will have to read the next
chapter.

CHAPTER 12

Wang Xi-feng sets a trap for her admirer
And Jia Rui looks into the wrong side of the mirror



Jia Rui’s arrival was announced while Xi-feng and Patience were still talking about
him.
     ‘Ask him in,’ said Xi-feng.
     Hearing that he was to be received, Jia Rui rejoiced in?wardly. He came into the
room wreathed in smiles and over?whelmed Xi-feng with civilities. With feigned
solicitude she pressed him to be seated and to take tea. He became quite ecstatic at
the sight of her informal dress.
     ‘Why isn’t Cousin Lian back yet?’ he asked, staring with fascinated eyes.
‘I don’t know what the reason can be,’ said Xi-feng.
     ‘Could it be,’ Jia Rui inquired archly, ‘that Someone has detained him on his way
home and that he can’t tear himself away?’
     ‘Men are all the same!’ said Xi-feng. ‘They have only to set eyes on a woman to
begin another affair.’
     ‘Ah, there you are wrong!’ said Jia Rui. ‘I am not that sort of man.’
     ‘But how many men are there like you?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I doubt you could find one
in ten.’
     At this last remark Jia Rui positively scratched his ears with pleasure.
     ‘You must find it very dull here on your own every day,’ he said.
     ‘Yes, indeed!’ said Xi-feng. ‘If only there were someone who could come and talk
to me and help me to pass the time!’
     ‘Well,’ said Jia Rui, ‘I am always free. How would it be if I were to come every day
to help you pass the time?’
     ‘You must be joking!’ said Xi-feng. ‘What would you want to come here for?’
    ‘I mean every word I say,’ said Jia Rui. ‘May I be struck by lightning if I don’t! True,
there was a time when I should have been scared to come, because people always
told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you; but now
I know that in reality you are all gentleness and fun, there is nothing that could stop
me coming. I would come now if it cost me my life.’
     ‘It’s true then,’ said Xi-feng, smiling delightedly. ‘You really are an understanding
sort of person --- so much more so than Rong or Qiang! I used to think that since they
were such handsome and cultured-looking young men they must be understanding
as well, but they turned out to be stupid brutes without the least consideration for
other people’s feelings.’
    This little speech went straight to Jia Rui’s heart, and un?consciously he began
edging his seat nearer to Xi-feng’s. He peered closely at an embroidered purse that
she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings.
‘Take care!’ said Xi-feng in a low tone. ‘The servants might see you!’
    Obedient to his goddess’s command, Jia Rui quickly drew back again. Xi-feng
laughed.
‘You had better go!’
    ‘Ah no, cruel cousin! Let me stay a little longer!’
    ‘Even if you stay, it’s not very convenient here in broad daylight, with people
coming and going all the time. Go away now and come hack later when it’s dark, at
the beginning of the first watch. You can slip into the gallery west of this apart?ment
and wait for me there.’
    Jia Rui received these words like someone being presented with a rare and costly
jewel.
‘Are you sure you’re not joking ?’he asked hurriedly. ‘A lot of people must go
through that way. How should we avoid being seen?’
     ‘Don’t worry!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll give the watchmen a night off. When the side
gates are closed, no one else can get through.’
     Jia Rui was beside himself with delight and hurriedly took his leave, confident
that the fulfilment of all he wished for was now in sight. Having waited impatiently
for nightfall, he groped his way into the Rong-guo mansion just before they closed
the gates and slipped into the gallery, now totally deserted—as Xi-feng had promised
it would be—and black as pitch.
     The gate at the end of the alley-way opening on to Grand?mother Jia’s quarters
had already been barred on the outer side; only the gate at the east end remained
open. For a long time Jia Rui listened intently, but no one came. Suddenly there was a
loud slam and the gate at the east end, too, banged shut. Alarmed, but not daring to
make a sound, Jia Rui stealthily crept out and tried it. It was locked—as tight as a
bucket. Now even if he wanted to get out he could not, for the walls on either side of
the alley-way were too high to scale. Moreover the gallery was bare and draughty
and this was the midwinter season when the nights are long and the bitter north
wind seems to pierce into the very marrow of the bones. By the end of the night he
was almost dead with cold.
     When at last morning came, Jia Rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old
woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up. Still
hugging himself against the cold, he sprinted out of the other gate while her back
was towards him. Fortunately no one was about at that early hour, and he was able
to slip out of the rear entrance of the mansion and run back home unseen.
     Jia Rui had lost both of his parents in infancy and had been brought up under the
sole guardianship of his grandfather Jia Dai-ru. Obsessed by the fear that once
outside the house his grandson might indulge in drinking and gambling to the
detriment of his studies, Dai-ru had subjected him since early youth to an iron
discipline from which not the slightest deviation was tolerated. Seeing him now
suddenly absent him?self a whole night from home, and being incapable, in his
wildest imaginings, of guessing what had really happened, he took it as a foregone
conclusion that he had been either drink?ing or gaming and had probably passed the
night in some house of prostitution --- a supposition which caused the old gentleman
to spend the whole night in a state of extreme choler.
     The prospect of facing his grandfather on arrival made Jia Rui sweat. A lie of
some sort was indispensable.
     ‘I went to see Uncle yesterday,’ he managed to say, ‘and as it was getting dark, he
asked me to stay the night.’
     ‘I have always told you that you are not to go out of that gate without first
informing me,’ said his grandfather. ‘Why then did you presume to go off on your
own yesterday without saying a word to anybody? That in itself would constitute
sufficient grounds for chastisement. But in addition to that you are lying!’
     Thereupon he, forced him to the ground, and, with the utmost savagery, dealt
him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo, after which he forbade him to eat and
made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared
the equivalent of ten days’ homework.
     The exquisite torments suffered by Jia Rui, as he knelt with an empty stomach in
the draughty courtyard reciting his homework after having already been frozen all
night long and then beaten, can be imagined.
     Yet even now his infatuation remained unaltered. It never entered his mind that
he had been made a fool of. And so two days later, as soon as he had some free time,
he was back once more looking for Xi-feng. She deliberately reproached him for
having failed her, thereby so exasperating him that he swore by the most terrible
oaths that he had been faithful. Seeing him hurl himself so willingly into the net,
Xi-feng decided that a further lesson would be needed to cure him of his folly and
proposed another assignation.
     ‘Only tonight,’ she said, ‘don’t wait for me in that place again. Wait in the empty
room in the little passage-way behind this apartment. But mind you don’t run into
anybody.’
     ‘Do you really mean this?’ said Jia Rui.
     ‘If you don’t believe me, don’t come!’
     ‘I’ll come! I’ll come!’ said Jia Rui. ‘Whatever happens, I shall be there.’
      ‘Now I think you had better go.’
      Confident of seeing her again in the evening, Jia Rui went off uncomplainingly,
leaving Xi-feng time to muster her forces, brief her officers, and prepare the trap in
which the luckless man was to be caught.
      Jia Rui waited for the evening with great impatience. By a stroke of bad luck
some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper. It was already lamplight when
they left, and Jia Rui then had to wait for his grandfather to settle down for the night
before he could scuttle off to the Rong mansion and make his way to the room in the
little passage-way where Xi-feng had told him to go. He waited there for her arrival
with the frenzied agitation of an ant on a hot saucepan. Yet, though he waited and
waited, not a human shape appeared nor a human sound was heard, and he began
to be frightened and a little suspicious:
‘Surely she won’t fail me? Surely I shan’t be made to spend another night in the
cold...?’
As he was in the midst of these gloomy imaginings, a dark figure glided into the room.
Certain that it must be Xi-feng, Jia Rui cast all caution to the winds and, when the
figure approached him, threw himself upon it like a hungry tiger seizing its prey or a
cat pouncing on a harmless mouse.
‘My darling, how I have waited for you!” he exclaimed, enfolding his beloved in his
arms; and carrying her to the kang, he laid her down and began kissing her and
tugging at her trousers, murmuring ‘my sweetest darling’ and ‘my honey love’ and
other such endearments in between kisses. Throughout all of this not a single sound
was uttered by his partner. Jia Rui now tore down his own trousers and prepared to
thrust home his hard and throbbing member. Suddenly a light flashed --- and there
was Jia Qiang holding aloft a candle in a candlestick which he shone around:
‘Who is in this room?’
At this the person on the kang gave a giggle:
‘Uncle Rui is trying to bugger me!’
Horrors! The sight he saw when he looked down made Jia Rui want to sink into the
ground. It was Jia Rong! He turned to bolt, but Jia Qiang held him fast.
‘Oh no you don’t! Auntie Lian has already told Lady Wang that you have been
pestering her. She asked us to keep you here while she went to tell. When Lady Wang
first heard, she was so angry that she fainted, but now she’s come round again and is
asking for you to be brought to her. Come along, then! Off we go!’
At these words Jia Rui’s soul almost left its seat in his body.
‘My dear nephew, just tell her that you didn’t find me here!’ he said. ‘Tomorrow I
will reward you handsomely.’
‘I suppose I could let you go easily enough,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘The question is, how big
would this reward be? In any case, just saying that you will give me a reward is no
good. I should want a written guarantee.’
‘But I can’t put a thing like this down in writing!’
‘No problem there,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Just say that you’ve lost money gambling and
have borrowed such and such an amount to cover your losses. That’s all you need
do.’
‘I could do that, certainly,’ said Jia Rui.
Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a
writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance. Writing at his
dicta?tion Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver
as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once
pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong. But
Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and in?sisted that he would lay
the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done.
Jia Rui became quite frantic and kotowed to him. Finally, under pressure from Jia
Qiang and in return for another IOU for fifty taels of silver made out in his favour, he
allowed his scruples to be overcome.
‘You realize, don’t you,’ said Jia Qiang, ‘that I’m going to get into trouble for this?
Now let’s see. The gate leading to Lady Jia’s courtyard was bolted some time ago, and
Sir Zheng is at the moment in the main reception room looking at some stuff that has
just arrived from Nanking, so you can’t go through that way. The only way left would
be through the back gate. The trouble is, though, that if you leave now, you might
run into someone on the way, and then I should get into even worse trouble. You’d
better let me scout around a bit first and come for you when the coast is clear. In the
meantime you can t hide here, though, because they will shortly be com?ing in to
store the stuff from Nanking here. I’ll find somewhere else for you.’
He took Jia Rui by the arm, and having first blown the candle out, led him into the
courtyard and groped his way round to the underside of the steps which led up to
the terrace of the central building.
‘This hollow under the steps will do. Crouch down there, and don’t make a sound!
You can go when I come for you.
Jia Qiang and Jia Rong then went off leaving him to him?self.
Jia Rui, by now a mere automaton in the hands of his cap?tors, obediently crouched
down beneath the steps and was just beginning a series of calculations respecting his
present financial predicament when a sudden slosh! signalled the dis?charge of a
slop-pail’s stinking contents immediately above his head, drenching him from top to
toe with liquid filth and causing him to cry out in dismay --- but only momentarily, for
the excrement covered his face and head and caused him to close his mouth again in
a hurry and crouch silent and shivering in the icy cold. Just then Jia Qiang came
running up:
     ‘Hurry! hurry! You can go now.’
At the word of command Jia Rui bounded out of his hole and sprinted for dear life
through the rear gate and back to his own home. It was now past midnight, and he
had to shout for someone to let him in. When the servant who answered the gate
saw the state he was in and asked him how it had happened, he had to pretend that
he had been out in the darkness to ease himself and had fallen into the jakes. Then
rushing into his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed, his mind running
all the time on how Xi-feng had tricked him. The thought of her trickery provoked a
surge of hatred in his soul; yet even as he hated her, the vision of her loveliness made
him long to clasp her to his breast. Torn by these violent and con?flicting emotions,
he passed the whole night without a single wink of sleep.
From that time on, though he longed for Xi-feng with un?abated passion, he never
dared to visit the Rong-guo mansion again. Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, on the other hand,
came frequently to his house to ask for their money, so that he was in constant dread
of his grandfather finding out about the IOUs.
Unable, even now, to overcome his longing for Xi-feng, saddled with a heavy burden
of debt, harassed during the day?time by the schoolwork set him by his exacting
grandfather, worn-out during the nights by the excessive hand-pumping inevitable in
an unmarried man of twenty whose mistress was both unattainable and constantly in
his thoughts, twice frozen, tormented and forced to flee --- what constitution could
with?stand so many shocks and strains without succumbing in the end to illness? The
symptoms of Jia Rui’s illness—a palpitation in the heart, a loss of taste in the mouth,
a weakness in the hams, a smarting in the eyes, feverishness by night and lassi?tude
by day, albumen in the urine and blood-flecks in the phlegm—had all manifested
themselves within less than a year. By that time they had produced a complete
breakdown and driven him to his bed, where he lay, with eyes tight shut, babbling
deliriously and inspiring terror in all who saw him. Physicians were called in to treat
him and some bushels of cinnamon bark, autumn root, turtle-shell, black leek and
Solomon’s seal must at one time and another have been in-fused and taken without
the least observable effect.
Winter went and spring came and Jia Rui’s sickness grew even worse. His grandfather
Dai-ru was in despair. Medical advice from every quarter had been taken and none of
it had proved effective. The most recent advice was that the patient should be given
a pure decoction of ginseng without admixture of other ingredients. So costly a
remedy was far beyond Dai?-ru’s resources and he was obliged to go to the Rong-guo
man?sion to beg. Lady Wang ordered Wang Xi-feng to weigh out two ounces for him
from their own supplies.
‘The other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for Grandmother,’ said
Xi-feng, ‘you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you
were sending to General Yang’s wife. I sent her the medicine yesterday, sol am afraid
we haven’t any left.’
‘Well, even if we haven’t got any,’ said Lady Wang, ‘you can send to your
mother-in-law’s for some; and probably they will have some at your Cousin Zhen’s.
Between you you ought somehow or other to be able to raise enough to give him. If
you can save a man’s life by doing so, you will have performed a work of merit.’
But though Xi-feng pretended to do as Lady Wang suggested, in fact she made no
such inquiries. She merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent
them to Dai-ru with a message that ‘Lady Wang had instructed her to send this, and
it was all they had.’ To Lady Wang, however, she reported that she had asked the
others and altogether obtained more than two ounces of ginseng which she had sent
to Dai-ru.
Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swal?lowed every medicine that
they offered him; but all was a waste of money, for nothing seemed to do him any
good. One day a lame Taoist appeared at the door asking for alms and claiming to be
able to cure retributory illnesses. Jia Rui, who chanced to overhear him, called out
from his bed:
‘Quick, tell the holy man to come in and save me!’ and as he called, he kotowed
with his head on the pillow. The servants were obliged to bring the Taoist into the
bedroom. Jia Rui clung to him tenaciously.
‘Holy one, save me!’ he cried out again and again.
The Taoist sighed.
‘No medicine will cure your sickness. However, I have a precious thing here that I
can lend you which, if you will look at it every day, can be guaranteed to save your
life.’
So saying, he took from his satchel a mirror which had reflecting surfaces on both its
sides. The words A MIRROR FOR THE ROMANTIC were inscribed on the back. He
handed it to Jia Rui.
‘This object comes from the Hall of Emptiness in the Land of Illusion. It was
fashioned by the fairy Disenchantment as an antidote to the ill effects of impure
mental activity. It has life-giving and restorative properties and has been brought into
the world for the contemplation of those intelligent and hand?some young
gentlemen whose hearts are too susceptible to the charms of beauty. I lend it to you
on one important condition: you must only look into the back of the mirror. Never,
never under any circumstances look into the front. Three days hence I shall come
again to reclaim it, by which time I guarantee that your illness will have gone.’
With that he left, at a surprising speed, ignoring the earnest entreaties of those
present that he should stay longer.
‘This is intriguing!’ Jia Rui thought to himself when the Taoist gave him the mirror.
‘Let me try looking into it as he says, and holding it up to his face he looked into the
back as instructed and saw a grinning skull, which he covered up hastily with a curse:
‘Silly old fool, to scare me like that! -- But let me see what happens when I look into
the other side!’
He turned the mirror round and looked, and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to
him to enter, and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her. There they
performed the act of love together, after which she saw him out again. But when he
found himself once more back in his bed he stared and cried out in horror: for the
mirror, of its own accord, had turned itself round in his hand and the same grinning
skull faced him that he had seen before. He could feel the sweat trickling all over his
body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated.
Yet still he was not satisfied, and turned the face of the mirror once more towards
him. Xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling, and again he went in after
her. He did this three or four times. But the last time, just as he was going to return
from the mirror, two figures approached him hold?ing iron chains which they
fastened round him and by which they proceeded to drag him away. He cried out as
they dragged him:
‘Wait! Let me take the mirror with me . . .!
Those were the last words he ever uttered.
To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he
appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then
to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from
his grasp, he finally ceased to move.
When they examined him more closely they found that his breathing had already
stopped and that underneath his body there was a large, wet, icy patch of recently
ejaculated semen.
At once they lifted him from the bed and busied themselves with the laying-out,
while old Dai-ru and his wife abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of grief. They
cursed the Taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and
cast the mirror upon the flames. But just at that moment a voice was heard in the air
saying, ‘Who told him to look in the front? It is you who are to blame, for confusing
the unreal with the real! Why then should you burn my mirror?’
Suddenly the mirror was seen to rise up and fly out of the room, and when Dai-ru
went outside to look, there was the lame Taoist asking for it back. He snatched it as it
flew towards him and disappeared before Dai-ru’s very eyes.
Seeing that there was to be no redress, Dai-yu was obliged to set about preparing for
the funeral and began by announc?ing his grandson’s death to everybody concerned.
Reading of the sutras began on the third day and on the seventh the coffin was
drawn in procession to temporary lodging in the Temple of the Iron Threshold to
await future reburial. The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to
offer their condolences. From the Rong-guo side Jia She and Jia Zheng each gave
twenty taels of silver and from the Ning-guo side Cousin Zhen also gave twenty taels.
The other members of the clan gave amounts varying from one to four taels
according to their means. A collection made among the parents of the dead man’s
fellow-students raised an additional twenty or thirty taels. Although Dai-ru’s means
were slender, with so much monetary help coming in he was able to perform the
whole business in considerable style.
*
Towards the end of the year in which Jia Rui’s troubles started Lin Ru-hai fell seriously
ill and wrote a letter asking to see Dai-yu again. Though Grandmother Jia was
plunged into deepest gloom by the letter, she was obliged to prepare with all
possible expedition for her granddaughter’s departure. And Bao-yu, though he too
was distressed at the prospect of Dai-yu’s leaving him, could scarcely seek to
interfere in a matter affecting the natural feelings of a father and his child.
Grandmother Jia insisted that Jia Lian should accompany Dai-yu and see her safely
there and back. The various gifts to be taken and the journey-money were, it goes
without saying, duly prepared. A suitable day on which to commence the journey
was quickly determined and Jia Lian and Dai-yu took leave of all the rest and,
embarking with their attendants, set sail for Yangchow.
If you wish for further details, you may learn them in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 13

Qin-shi posthumously acquires the status
of a Noble Dame
And Xi-feng takes on the management
of a neighbouring establishment



After Jia Lian’s departure for Yangchow Xi-feng felt bored and unhappy, particularly in
the evenings when, apart from chatting with Patience, there seemed little to do but
sleep. On the occasion of which we write she had sat beside the lamp with Patience
until late into the evening; then, the bedding having been well warmed, the two
women had gone to bed, where they lay until after midnight discussing the stages of
Jia Lian’s journey and attempting to calculate what point he was likely to have
reached in it. By this time Patience was fast asleep and Xi-feng herself was on the
point of dropping off when she became dimly aware that Qin-shi had just walked into
the room from outside.
     ‘So fond of sleep, Auntie?’ said Qin-shi with a gentle smile. ‘I shall have to begin
my journey today without you to see me off. But never mind! Since you cannot come
to me, I have come to you instead. We two have always been so close, I could not
have borne to leave you without saying good-bye. Besides, I have a last wish that you
alone must hear, because I cannot trust anyone else with it.’
     ‘What is your wish?’ Xi-feng heard herself asking. ‘You can trust me to carry it
out for you.’
     ‘Tell me, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi, ‘how is it that you who are such a paragon among
women that even strong men find more than their match in you can yet be ignorant
of the simple truths expressed in homely proverbs? Take this one:
The full moon smaller grows,
Full water overflows.

Or this:
The higher the climb, the harder the fall.

Our house has now enjoyed nearly a century of dazzling success. Suppose one day
“joy at its height engenders sorrow”. And suppose that, in the words of another
proverb, “when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter”. Will not our reputation as one of
the great, cultured households of the age then turn into a hollow mockery?’
     Qin-shi’s question made Xi-feng feel uneasy, though at the same time inspiring a
deep respect in her for her niece’s fore?sight.
     ‘You are quite right to show concern,’ she said. ‘Is there any means by which we
can keep permanently out of danger?’
     ‘Now you are being silly, Auntie!’ said Qin-shi somewhat scornfully. ‘“The
extreme of adversity is the beginning of prosperity” --- and the reverse of that saying
is also true. Honour and disgrace follow each other in an unending cycle. No human
power can arrest that cycle and hold it permanently in one position. What you can do,
however, is to plan while we are still prosperous for the kind of heritage that will
stand up to the hard times when they come.
     ‘At the moment everything seems well looked after; but in fact there are still two
matters that have not been properly taken care of. If you will deal with them in the
way that I shall presently suggest, you will be able to face the future without fear of
calamity.’
    ‘What two matters?’ Xi-feng asked her.
    ‘Though the seasonal offerings at the ancestral burial-ground are at present
regularly attended to,’ said Qin-shi, ‘no special income has been set aside to pay for
them. That is the first matter. The second matter concerns the clan school. There
again, there is no fixed source of income. Obviously there will be no lack of funds
either for the seasonal offerings or for the school as long as we enjoy our present
prosperity. But where is the money for them coming from in the future, when the
family has fallen on hard times?
    ‘I am convinced that the only way of dealing with these two matters is to invest
now, while we are still rich and powerful, in as much property as possible—land,
farms, and houses—in the area around the burial-ground, and to pay for the seasonal
offerings and the running of the school entirely out of the income from this property.
Moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it. The whole clan, old and young
alike, should be convened and a set of regulations drawn up whereby each family is
made to administer the estate and look after the financing of the seasonal offerings
and the clan school for one year in turn. By making the responsibility rotate in a fixed
order you will remove the possibility of quarrels about it and also lessen the danger
of the property getting mortgaged or sold.
     ‘Then even if the clan gets into trouble and its possessions are confiscated, this
part of its property, as charitable estate, will escape confiscation; and when the
family’s fortunes are in decline, it will be a place where the young people can go to
farm and study, as well as a means of maintaining the ancestral sacrifices in unbroken
succession. To refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our
present prosperity is going to last for ever would be extremely short-sighted.
     ‘Quite soon a happy event is going to take place in this family, bringing it an even
greater glory than it has enjoyed up to now. But it will be a glory as excessive and as
transitory as a posy of fresh flowers pinned to an embroidered dress or the flare-up
of spilt cooking-oil on a blazing fire. In the midst of that brief moment of happiness
never forget that “even the best party must have an end”. For if you do, and if you fail
to take precautions in good time, you will live to regret it bitterly when it is already
too late.’
     ‘What is this happy event you speak of?’ Xi-feng asked her eagerly.
     ‘That is a secret which may not be revealed to mortal ears. However, for the sake
of our brief friendship on this earth, I leave you these words as my parting gift. Be
sure that you remember them well!

    When the Three Springs have gone, the flowering time will end,
    And each one for himself as best he may must fend.’

Xi-feng was about to ask her another question when she was interrupted by the
sound of the iron chime-bar which hung in the inner gate.
     Four strokes. The signal of death!
     She woke with a start to hear a servant announcing, ‘Mrs Rong of the Ning-guo
mansion is dead.’ A cold sweat broke out over her body and for a while she lay too
stunned to move. Then forcing herself to get up she pulled on her clothes and went
round to Lady Wang’s.
     By this time the entire household had heard the news. All seemed bewildered by
it and all were in one way or another deeply distressed. Those older than Qin-shi
thought of how dutiful she had always been; those in her own generation thought of
her warmth and friendliness; her juniors remem?bered how kindly and lovingly she
had treated them; even the servants, irrespective of sex and age, remembering her
com?passion for the poor and humble and her gentle concern for the old and the
very young, all wept and lamented as loud and bitterly as the rest.
     But we digress.
     During the last few days, since Dai-yu’s return to her father had deprived him of
her companionship, Bao-yu, far from seeking diversion in the company of the others,
had kept to himself, going to bed early every night and sleeping dis?consolately on
his own. The news of Qin-shi’s death came to him in the midst of his dreams, causing
him to start up in bed with a jerk. A sudden stabbing pain shot through his heart. He
retched involuntarily and spat out a mouthful of blood. Aroma and the maids clung
to him, terrified, and asked him what was the matter. They wanted to tell
Grandmother Jia and ask her to send for a doctor; but Bao-yu would not hear of it.
     ‘Don’t worry, it’s of no consequence!’ he told them. ‘Something that happens
when a sudden rush of fire to the heart prevents the blood from getting back into the
right channels.’
     He climbed out of bed as he spoke and told them to bring him some clean
clothes, so that he could see his grandmother and then go straight on to the other
house. Aroma was still concerned for him, but seeing him so determined, allowed
him to have his way.
     Grandmother Jia did not want him to go, either.
     ‘It won’t be clean there,’ she said, ‘with her scarcely yet cold. And besides,
there’s a nasty wind at this time of night. It will be soon enough if you go there first
thing tomorrow.’
     But Bao-yu would not be gainsaid, so she gave instructions for a carriage to be
made ready for him and a numerous retinue of servants to attend him there.
     Arriving in haste at the entrance of the Ning-guo mansion, they found the gates
flung wide open and lanterns on either side turning the night into noonday. Despite
the hour, a multitude of people were hurrying through it in both direc?tions, while
from inside the house issued a sound of lamenta?tion that seemed to shake the very
buildings to their founda?tions.
     Alighting from his carriage, Bao-yu hurried through to the room in which Qin-shi
lay and wept there for a while very bitterly. He then went to call on You-shi, whom he
found ill in bed, struck down by a sudden attack of some gastric trouble from which
she had occasionally suffered in the past. After leaving You-shi, he went to look for
Cousin Zhen.
     By now Jia Dai-ru, Jia Dai-xiu, Jia Chi, Jia Xiao, Jia Dun, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Cong,
Jia Bin, Jia Heng (I), Jia Guang, Jia Chen, Jia Qiong, Jia Lin, Jia Qiang, Jia Chang, Jia Ling,
Jia Yun, Jia Qin, Jia Jin, Jia Ping, Jia Zao, Jia Heng (II), Jia Fen, Jia Fang, Jia Lan, Jia Jun
and Jia Zhi had all arrived, and Bao-yu found Cousin Zhen in their midst addressing
them, though well-nigh choked with tears:
     ‘Everyone, young or old, kinsman or friend, knows that my daughter-in-law was
ten times better than any son. Now that she has been taken from us it’s plain to see
that this senior branch of the family is doomed to extinction!’ and he broke down
once more into incontrollable weeping.
     The men present tried to console him:
     ‘Now that she’s gone, crying isn’t going to bring her back again. The important
thing now is to make your plans for the funeral.’
     ‘Plans? What plans?’ Cousin Zhen cried, somewhat theatrically. ‘Just take
everything I have—everything!’
     As he was speaking Qin Bang-ye and Qin Zhong arrived, and various members of
You-shi’s family, including her two younger sisters. Cousin Zhen deputed Jia Qiong, Jia
Chen, Jia Lin and Jia Qiang from among the younger men present to look after them
and any other guests who might arrive.
     He also instructed someone to invite an expert from the Board of Astronomy to
select dates for the funeral and the ceremonies preceding it. With the approval of
this official it was decided that the lying in state should be for forty-nine days and
that the notification of bereavement indicating the family’s readiness to receive
official visits of condolence should be made in three days’ time. A hundred and eight
Buddhist monks were engaged to perform a Grand Miseri?cordia for the salvation of
all departed souls in the main reception hall of the mansion during these forty-nine
days, while at the same time ninety-nine Taoist priests of the Quan?zhen sect were
to perform ceremonies of purification and absolution at a separate altar in the
Celestial Fragrance pavilion. These arrangements having been made, the body was
moved to a temporary shrine in another pavilion of the All-scents Garden. Fifty
high-ranking Buddhist monks and fifty high-ranking Taoist priests took turns in
chanting and intoning before it on every seventh day.
    Nothing would induce old Jia Jing to return home when he learned of the death
of his grandson’s wife. Immortality was within his grasp and he was not going to
impair his hard-won sanctity with the taint of earthly pollution. Accordingly he left all
these matters to Cousin Zhen to order as he wished.
    Free to indulge his own extravagant tastes, Cousin Zhen had inspected several
sets of deal coffin-boards without finding any to his liking. Xue Pan heard of his
problem when he came round to condole.
    ‘We’ve got a set in our timber-yard,’ he told Cousin Zhen. ‘It’s in a wood
supposed to have come from the Iron Net Mountains. They say that a coffin made
from it will last forever without rotting. It was brought here years ago by my father.
Prince Zhong-yi was going to have it, but when he came unstuck it didn’t get used.
It’s still locked up in store because no one has ever been found who could afford to
buy it. If you are interested, I can have it carried round for you to look at.’
      Cousin Zhen was delighted, and the timber was brought over at once for
everyone to inspect. The planks for the base and sides were at least eight inches thick.
The wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and
sandalwood. When rapped with the knuckles it gave off a hard, ringing sound like
jade or stone. Everyone was impressed and Cousin Zhen eagerly inquired the price.
Xue Pan laughed.
      ‘I doubt you could buy a set like this for a thousand taels of silver cash down,’ he
said. ‘Blow the price! Give the workmen a couple of taels for carrying it here and it’s
yours.’
      Cousin Zhen thanked him profusely and at once gave orders for the planks to be
sawn up and made into a coffin. Jia Zheng doubted the propriety of using such
material for the burial of a person not of royal blood and insisted that it would be
sufficient to use the best quality deal; but Cousin Zhen refused to listen.
      News was suddenly brought that Qin-shi’s little maid Gem, on hearing that her
mistress was dead, had taken her own life by dashing her head against a pillar. Such
rare devotion excited the wondering admiration of the entire clan. Cousin Zhen at
once had her laid out and encoffined with the rites appropriate to a granddaughter
and ordered her coffin to be placed in the Ascension Pavilion of the All-scents Garden
side by side with Qin-shi’s.
      As Qin-shi had died without issue, another of her little maids called Jewel
volunteered to stand in as her daughter and perform the chief mourner’s duties of
smashing the bowl when the bearers came in to take up the coffin and walking in
front of it in the funeral procession. Cousin Zhen was very pleased and gave orders
that thenceforth everyone was to address her as ‘Miss Jewel’ just as if she were
Qin-shi’s real daughter. In the meantime she installed herself by the coffin and,
comporting herself in the manner prescribed for an unmarried daughter, wept and
wailed until she had almost lost her voice.
     Following these preliminaries, the rest of the clan together with the family
servants all proceeded to carry out their mourning duties according to
long-established precedents and in a correct and orderly manner. The family’s
respect for tradition was, however, a source of great unease to Cousin Zhen when he
reflected on Jia Rong’s status: for Jia Rong was only an Imperial College Student --- an
absurdly insignificant title to write on a funeral banner; and the insignia to which
Qin-shi was entitled would make a very poor showing when borne in the funeral
procession.
      By a stroke of luck the fourth day of the first seven-day period—the day on which
official condolences were scheduled to begin --- brought a visit from Dai Quan, the
Eunuch Cham?berlain of the Da-ming Palace. Having sent his representative along
well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit, he presently arrived himself,
seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the
streets before him, to present his offerings in person. Cousin Zhen at once made up
his mind to take advantage of the visit.
      As soon as Dai Quan had made his offering, Cousin Zhen ushered him into the
Honey Bee Gallery, invited him to be seated, and served him with tea. Then, entering
into conversa?tion with his guest, he quickly found occasion to mention the fact that
he was thinking of purchasing a place for his son Jia Rong. The eunuch guessed what
was in his mind, and laughingly inquired whether it was not with a view to adding a
little pomp to the funeral that he had conceived this notion.
      ‘My dear Chamberlain,’ Cousin Zhen readily agreed, you have hit the nail on the
head!’
      ‘Well, by a lucky coincidence,’ said Dai Quan, ‘there is rather a good place going
at this very moment. The Corps of Officers of the Imperial Guard, which has an
establishment of three hundred, has got two vacancies in it. Yesterday Lord
Xiang-yang’s younger brother “Sannikins” begged me for one of them and sent
fifteen hundred taels of silver round to my house to pay for it. He and I have always
been good friends, as you know, and in any case I felt I had to do some?thing, for his
Grandpa’s sake; so I couldn’t very well refuse. “Piggy” Feng, the Military Governor of
Yong-xing, has asked me if he can buy the remaining place for his son, but I haven’t
yet had time to give him a reply. If our young friend here wants it, why not jot down
his particulars and I’ll see what I can do.’
     Cousin Zhen at once ordered someone to write out Jia Rong’s name, age and
lineage on a sheet of red paper. The following description was hurriedly prepared and
handed to Dai Quan for his inspection:

Name: JIA RONG
Place of Origin: (County) Kiangning; (Prefecture) Ying-tian-fu; (Province) Kiangnan.
Status: Imperial College Student
Age:      20
Great-grandfather: General Jia Dai-hua, C.-in-C. Metropolitan Barracks, hereditary
noble of the first rank.
Grandfather:Jia Jing, Palace Graduate of the year 17—.
Father: Hon. Colonel Jia Zhen, third rank (hereditary).
After glancing through it quickly, Dai Quan handed it into the keeping of a young
eunuch secretary at his side.
     ‘When we get back,’ he said to the latter, ‘give this to old Zhao, the President of
the Board of Revenue, with my compli?ments, and ask him if he would kindly make
out a commission for a captain in the Imperial Guard, fifth rank, and also the papers
to go with it with these particulars filled in. Tell him I’ll call round tomorrow to pay in
the money.’
The young eunuch bowed, and Dai Quan rose to go. Seeing that he could no longer
detain him, Cousin Zhen showed him out as far as the main gate. As the eunuch was
getting into his palanquin, Cousin Zhen asked him whether he should take the money
to the Ministry or bring it round to Dai Quan’s own house.
‘Better bring a thousand taels, standard weight, to my house. If you go to the
Ministry, they’re sure to fleece you.’
Cousin Zhen thanked him warmly.
‘When the period of mourning is over,’ he said, ‘I shall bring the young fellow round
to your house to kotow his thanks.’
With that they parted. But no sooner had the eunuch gone than the sound of criers
was once more heard in the street, this time heralding the arrival of the Marchioness
of Zhong?jing, wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, with her little niece Shi
Xing-yun. Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Wang Xi-feng received them in Cousin Zhen’s
drawing-room.
Offerings from the Marquises of Jin-xiang and Chuan-ning and the Earl of Shou-shan
were now on display, and those three gentlemen were shortly to be observed
alighting from their palanquins outside. Cousin Zhen went out to meet them and
conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall.
     From then on there was a continuous stream of arrivals, and throughout the
whole forty-nine-day period the street in front of the Ning-guo mansion was
thronged with family mourners in white and mandarins in their’ colourful robes of
office, milling in and out and to and fro all day long.
     The day after Dai Quan’s visit Cousin Zhen made Jia Rong change out of
mourning into a court dress and go to collect his commission. The furnishings and
insignia in the shrine were all rearranged in a manner befitting a person of the fifth
rank. The wording on the spirit tablet which stood on the table of offerings at the
foot of the coffin now read.

Spirit tablet of the Lady Qin-shi of the Jia family
Gentlewoman of the Fifth Rank by Imperial Patent
The gate of the All-scents Garden opening on to the street was thrown wide open
and booths for musicians were erected on either side of it, in which black-coated
funeral bands played at fixed times throughout the day. To either side of them were
displayed the insignia of rank: glittering rows of axes and halberds arranged in
wooden stands. At each side of the gateway vermilion-painted boards inscribed in
large golden characters boldly announced the status of the bereaved:

Honorary Captain of the Imperial Bodyguard
Inner Palace, Northern Capital Division

Inside the gateway, facing the street, a high staging was con?structed on which
Buddhist monks and Taoist priests sat on opposite sides of an altar intoning their
sacred texts. In front of the staging was a notice on which was written in large
characters:



FUNERAL OBSEQUIES

OF

THE LADY QIN-SHI

Senior great-great-granddaughter-in-law of
Jia Yan, Hereditary Duke of Ning-guo, and
wife of the Right Honourable Jia Rong, Captain
in the Imperial Bodyguard, Inner Palace:

                   WHEREAS
                             in this favoured Country, situate in the centre-
                             most part of the four continents of the earth,
                               on which it has pleased Heaven to bestow the
                               blessings of everlasting prosperity and peace,

WE,
the Very Reverend Wan-xu, Co-President of
the Board of Commissioners having author?ity
over all monks and clergy of the Incorporeal,
EverAranquil Church of the Lord Buddha,

and
the Venerable Ye-sheng, Co-President of the
Board of Commissioners having authority
over all priests and practitioners of the Primordial,
All-unifying Church of the Heavenly Tao,

HAVE,
with all due reverence and care, prepared
offices for the salvation of all departed
souls, supplicating Heaven and calling upon
the Name of the Lord Buddha.

NOW,
earnestly praying and beseeching the Eight?een
Guardians of the Sangha, the Warlike
Guardians of the Law, and the Twelve
Guardians of the Months mercifully to extend
their holy compassion towards us, but
terribly to blaze forth in divine majesty
against the powers of evil, we do solemnly
perform for nine and forty days the Great
Mass for the purification, deliverance and
salvation of all souls on land and on sea...


—and a great deal more on those lines which it would be tedious to repeat.



*
Although Cousin Zhen now had every reason to feel satisfied with his arrangements,
there was still one matter which caused him uneasiness. You-shi’s unfortunate illness
meant that she was unable to discharge any of her social obligations, and he was
mortally afraid that with so many great ladies coming to the house on visits of
condolence, some breach of etiquette might occur which would cause the family to
look ridiculous.
Bao-yu once chanced to be sitting next to him when his mind was dwelling on this
problem, and observing the gloomy and preoccupied expression on his cousin’s face,
asked him why he should still be worried now that everything had been so excellently
taken care of. Cousin Zhen explained that it was the present lack of a responsible
female head of household which was the cause of his concern.
    ‘That’s no problem!’ said Bao-yu encouragingly. ‘I know just the person for this.
Put her in temporary control here for a month, and I guarantee that you will have
nothing further to worry about.’
    ‘Who?’ inquired Cousin Zhen eagerly.
    Bao-yu deemed it imprudent to mention her name out loud in the hearing of so
many friends and relations, so leaning across he whispered it in Cousin Zhen’s ear.
Cousin Zhen’s reaction was ecstatic.
‘Yes, absolutely the right person!’ he cried. ‘Let’s see about it straight away!’
     And seizing Bao-yu by the hand, he excused himself to the company and hurried
round to the reception room in his own apartment.
It so happened that this day was not one of the seven on which masses were said, so
visitors from outside the family were fairly few. In the inner apartments there was
only a hand?ful of lady visitors, all of them close connections of the Jia family, whom
Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and various female members of the clan were
keeping company. When a servant announced ‘The Master is here’, all these females
jumped up with little shrieks of alarm and rushed off to hide themselves—all, that is,
except Xi-feng, who rose slowly to her feet and imperturbably stood her ground.
Cousin Zhen had of late been feeling far from well. The debility his sickness caused
him had been further aggravated by excessive grief and obliged him to support
himself with a staff. Lady Xig was concerned to see the pitiflil figure he presented as
he entered the room.
‘You are not well,’ she said, ‘and you have been doing too much now for days. You
ought to be getting some rest. What do you want to come in here for?’
Clutching his staff in his hand, Cousin Zhen struggled down on to his knees, and
having made his duty to his aunts, began thanking them for all their trouble. Lady
Xing hurriedly ordered Bao-yu to raise him up and commanded a chair to be moved
forward for him to sit on. But Cousin Zhen refused to be seated.
‘I have come to ask you three ladies a favour,’ he said, forcing his woebegone
features into a smile.
    ‘What is it you want?’ Lady Xing asked him.
    ‘As you doubtless know,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘my wife has been ill in bed ever since
our daughter-in-law’s death, and with no one to run her side of the household it has
been getting into a pretty deplorable state. I should like to ask Cousin Feng if she
could possibly see her way to running things here for us during the coming month. It
would be a great relief to me if she could.’
      ‘So that’s what you want!’ said Lady Xing with a smile. ‘Feng is now part of your
Aunt Wang’s establishment. You’d better talk to her about it.’
        ‘She’s only a child yet; you know,’ Lady Wang put in hastily. ‘What experience
has she ever had of this kind of thing? Suppose she proved not quite up to the task.
We should all be made to look ridiculous. I think you had better trouble someone
else.’
      ‘I can easily guess what is in your mind, Aunt,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘You are afraid
we should overwork her. For I assure you there is no question of her not being a good
enough manager. Even in her childhood games, Cousin Feng had the decisiveness of a
little general, and since she’s married and had some experience of running things
next door, she is a thoroughly seasoned campaigner. I’ve thought the matter over
carefully these past few days and am quite convinced that apart from Cousin Feng
there really isn’t anyone else I can ask. If you won’t let her do this for my sake or my
wife’s sake, at least won’t you let her for the sake of the one who has just died?’
And at this point he burst into tears.
Lady Wang’s only concern had been lest Xi-feng, who had had no experience of
large-scale funerals, might find the task too big for her and perhaps end up by
making a fool of herself. But Cousin Zhen’s moving plea caused her attitude to soften
considerably and she eyed Xi-feng thoughtfully as though struggling to make up her
mind. Xi-feng for her part had always loved managing things and enjoyed showing off
her ability to do so. When Cousin Zhen first made his request, her mind had at once
consented; and now, observing that Lady Wang appeared to be already half
persuaded, she hastened to complete the process.
‘Cousin Zhen has spoken su eloquently. Oughtn’t we per?haps to agree, Aunt?’
‘Do you think you can do it?’ Lady Wang asked her in a low aside.
‘I don’t see why not,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Cousin Zhen has already seen to all the outside
arrangements himself. It’s only a question of looking after the domestic side for a bit.
And even if there is anything I don’t know about, I can always ask you.’
This seemed reasonable enough to Lady Wang, so she said nothing. Seeing that
Xi-feng herself appeared to be willing, Cousin Zhen turned to her with a smile.
‘Actually there isn’t so very much to do,’ he said. ‘You really must let us persuade
you to take this on. Let me make you a reverence now, to show my gratitude. Then,
when this is all over, I shall come round to your place to thank you properly.’
So saying, he clasped his hands before him and made her a formal bow. Xi-feng
hurriedly curtseyed back.
Cousin Zhen now ordered someone to fetch the tallies for the entire Ning-guo
household and instructed Bao-yu to hand them to Xi-feng.
‘I want you to manage things whatever way you like,’ he told her. ‘Anything you
want you can get by using one of these. There is no need to ask me for it. I have only
two requests to make of you. First that you should dismiss from your mind any idea
of trying to save me any money. The important thing is to put on a good show: the
expense doesn’t matter. And secondly that you should treat our people here exactly
as you treat the members of your own household. Don’t be afraid of upsetting them.
Provided that you will observe those conditions, I leave everything in your hands
with the utmost confidence.’
Xi-feng watched Lady Wang, not daring to accept the tallies without her approval.
‘You hear what your cousin says,’ said Lady Wang. ‘You bad better do as he asks.
Only do not take too much upon yourself. If there are any decisions to make, be sure
to ask Cousin Zhen or his wife first.’
Bao-yu had already received the tallies from Cousin Zhen and now thrust them at
Xi-feng. For politeness’ sake she feigned a certain amount of reluctance, but was
soon prevailed upon to accept them.
‘Will you stay here with us,’ Cousin Zhen asked her, ‘or will you be coming over
every day from the other house? If you intend to come over from the other house
every day, it will greatly add to your burdens. We have an apartment here with its
own courtyard which we can very quickly place at your disposal. If you would care to
move in for the next week or two, I am sure we could make you comfortable.’
‘Thank you, but it won’t be necessary,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I am needed at
the other house too, so it will be best if I come here every day.’
Having accomplished his mission, Cousin Zhen stayed chatting a little longer and then
left. Presently, when the visiting ladies had dispersed, Lady Wang asked Xi-feng what
her plans were for the rest of the day.
‘Please go on without me, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Before I go back myself I must first
try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail.’
Lady Wang accordingly left without more delay in the company of Lady Xing, and the
two ladies returned to the Rong-guo mansion, where we must now leave them.
Alone at last, Xi-feng wandered into a sort of penthouse building where she sat down
and tried to formulate the task that lay ahead. Five major abuses, long habitual in the
Ning-guo establishment, presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need
of attention, viz:
1.Because it was so large and so motley an establishment, things were always getting
lost.
2.Because there was no rational division of labour, it always seemed to be someone
else’s responsibility whenever a job needed to be done.
      3.Because the household’s expenditure was so lavish, money was always getting
misappropriated or misspent.
        4.Because no distinctions were made between one job and another, the
rewards and hardships were unfairly distributed,
5.Because the servants were so arrogant and undisciplined, those with face’ could
brook no restraint and those without could win no advancement.
If you want to know how Xi-feng dealt with these abuses, you will have to read the
chapter which follows.

CHAPTER 14

Lin Ru-hai is conveyed to his last
resting-place in Soochow
And Jia Bao-yu is presented to the Prince of
Bei-jing at a roadside halt

When Lai Sheng, the Chief Steward of the Ning-guo mansion, learned that Xi-feng
had been invited to take on the manage?ment of the household, he called his cronies
together and addressed them in the following terms:
‘Well lads, it seems that they’ve called in Mrs Lian from the other house to run
things here for a bit; so if she should happen to come round asking for anything or
have occasion to talk to you about anything, be sure to do what she says, won’t you?
During this coming month we shall all have to start work a bit earlier and knock off a
bit later than usual. If you’ll put up with a little extra hardship just for this month, we
can make up for it by taking things easy when it’s over. Anyway, I’m relying on you
not to let me down. She’s well known for a sour-faced, hard-hearted bitch is this one,
and once she’s got her back up, she’ll give no quarter, no matter who you are. So be
careful!’
There was a chorus of agreement from the rest. One of them did observe,
half-jokingly, that ‘by rights they could do with someone like her to straighten things
up a bit, consider?ing the state they had got into’. But just at that moment Brightie’s
wife arrived on a mission from Xi-feng. She was to take receipt of some ledger-paper,
buckram, and book-labels, and had a tally in her hand and a slip of paper specifying
the quantities required. The men pressed round her offering her a place to sit and a
cup of tea to drink while one of them hurried off with the list to fetch the needed
items. Not only that, but, having fetched them, he carried them for her all the way to
the inner gate of the mansion, only handing them to her then so that she could take
them in to Xi-feng by herself. Xi-feng at once ordered Sunshine to make them up into
stout workbooks for use in the office. At the same time she sent for Lai Sheng’s wife
and asked her for the register of the household staff. She also told her to get in touch
with all the married females on the staff and arrange for them to assemble first thing
next morning to be told their new duties. Then, after roughly checking through the
numbers in the ‘establishment’ sheet and questioning Lai Sheng’s wife on a few
points, she got into her carriage and drove back home.
At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion. By this time all
the married women on the staff had been assembled. Not daring to go in, they hung
about outside the window listening to Xi-feng discussing work-plans with Lai Sheng’s
wife inside the office. ‘Now that I’m in charge here’, they heard her telling the latter,
‘I won’t promise to make myself agreeable. I haven’t got a sweet temper like your
mistress, you know. You won’t find me letting you do everything just as it suits you.
So don’t let me hear anyone saying "We don’t do it that way here"! From now on,
whatever it is, you do it the way I tell you to, and anyone who departs by as much as
a hair’s breadth from what I say is for it good and proper, no matter how senior or
how important she thinks she is!’
Having delivered herself of this formidable preliminary she ordered Sunshine to call
the roll. One by one the women stepped into the office to be looked at. When she
had looked at them all, Xi-feng proceeded to make her dispositions.
‘This twenty here. I want you to divide yourselves into two shifts of ten. Your job
every day will be to look after lady visitors and serve them tea. That’s all you have to
do. Nothing else.
‘This twenty here. I want you divided into two shifts like the others. Your job will be
serving tea and meals to the family. Nothing else.
‘These forty. Again, two shifts. Your job is to look after the shrine: lighting fresh
joss-sticks, keeping the lamps in oil, changing the drapes. You will also take turns by
the spirit tablet, making offerings of rice and tea, kotowing when the visitors kotow,
wailing when they wail. That is your job and nothing else besides.
‘You four are to look after the cups and plates and so forth in the ladies’ tea-room.
If anything is missing, you share the responsibility between you and a quarter of the
cost will be stopped out of each of your wages.
‘You four here are to look after the dinner-ware: bowls, wine-cups and the like.
Anything missing will be stopped out of your wages.
‘This eight here. I want you to take charge of all funeral offerings sent in from
outside.
‘This eight. I want you to look after oil, candles, and paper-offerings. I’m going to
put the whole lot in your charge; then whenever any is needed somewhere, you
must go to wherever it is and supply them with whatever amount I tell you to.
‘This twenty here. I want you doing night duty by rota. You are to see that all the
gates are locked and keep a look-out for fires. You’ll also be responsible for keeping
the outside properly swept.
‘The rest of you are to be divided up between the different apartments. Each of you
will be responsible for the things in your own apartment, from furniture and antique
ware down to spittoons and dusters. If the tiniest sliver gets lost or broken, you will
be held responsible and will be expected to make it good.
‘Lai Sheng’s wife will make a general inspection every day, and if she catches
anyone idling or gambling or drinking or fighting or being difficult, she will at once
bring them to me for dealing with. And there will be no favouritism. If I find you’ve
done something wrong, I shan’t care whether you’ve been in service here for three
or four generations, it will make no difference to me.
‘Well, now you all know the rules. From now on whenever any trouble occurs I shall
know exactly who to hold respon?sible.
‘Those who are used to working with me at the other place always have a watch
handy, and everything they do, no matter how small a thing it is, is done at a fixed
time. You may not have watches, but at least there is a clock in your master’s
drawing-room you can look at. So here are the main times to remember. At half past
six I shall come over to hear the roll?call. At ten o’clock I take my lunch. I shall see
people with reports to make or tallies to collect up to, but not after, eleven o’clock. At
seven in the evening, as soon as the paper-offerings have been burnt, I shall make a
personal tour of inspection; and when I get back from it, I shall issue those on night
duty with their keys. Then next day I shall be back here again at half past six.
‘I dare say we are all going to be a bit overworked during the days ahead, but I am
sure your master will want to reward you all for your trouble when this is over.’
Xi-feng now proceeded to supervise the distribution of supplies of tea, oil, candles,
feather-dusters, and brooms to some of her work-parties, and to issue others with
table?cloths, chair-covers, cushions, mats, spittoons, footstools, and other
furnishings, an entry of the amount supplied being made in the book as each
consignment was handed over.
A clear record now existed of what individuals were in charge of which parts of the
household, what items they were responsible for, and what duties they were
expected to per?form. Gone now were the days when everyone picked the easiest
tasks to do first and the less popular ones never got carried out; gone the convenient
disorder in which objects had so easily strayed (no one ever knew how) from the
rooms where they belonged. Even with the greatly increased coming and going
occasioned by the bereavement, it was quieter now than it had been before, when
muddle and confusion still pre?vailed. And the old idling and pilfering appeared to
have been eradicated completely. Secure in her authority, respected and obeyed by
all, Xi-feng might be forgiven for contemplating her achievement with a certain
amount of satisfaction.
Meanwhile You-shi was still unwell and Cousin Zhen too crushed by his somewhat
disproportionate grief to think much about eating and drinking. Xi-feng accordingly
had all sorts of invalid slops for You-shi and tempting little delicacies for Cousin Zhen
prepared in the kitchens of the Rong-guo man?sion and sent over each day to the
prostrate couple. Cousin Zhen reciprocated by instructing his own cooks to prepare
dishes of the very highest quality exclusively for Xi-feng and having them carried
round to her in her little penthouse office.
Xi-feng seemed quite tireless in the discharge of her extra duties. Every morning she
would be over at the appointed the rollcall and would sit there alone in her office,
never once emerging to mix with the young Ning-guo women of her own generation.
Even when lady visitors arrived she remained in the office and took no part in their
reception.
The Thirty-fifth had now arrived—an important day in the penitential cycle of seven
times seven days preceding the funeral—and the monks in the main hall had reached
a particularly dramatic part of their ceremonies. Having opened up a way for the
imprisoned souls, the chief celebrant had succeeded by means of spells and
incantations in breaking open the gates of hell. He had shone his light (a little
hand-mirror) for the souls in darkness. He had confronted Yama, the Judge of the
Dead. He had seized the demon torturers who resisted his progress. He had invoked
Ksitigarbha, the Saviour King, to aid him. He had raised up a golden bridge, and now,
by means of a little flag which he held aloft in one hand, was con?ducting over it
those souls from the very deepest pit of hell who still remained undelivered.
Meanwhile the ninety-nine Taoists in the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion were on their
knees offering up a written petition to the Three Pure Ones and calling on the Jade
Emperor himself in his heavenly palace. Outside, on their high staging, with swinging
of censers and scattering of little cakes for the hungry ghosts to feed on, Zen monks
were performing the great Water Penitential. And in the shrine where the coffin
stood, six young monks and six young nuns, magnificently attired in scarlet slippers
and embroidered copes, sat before the spirit tablet quietly murmuring the dharani
that would assist the soul of the dead woman on the most difficult part of its journey
into the underworld. Everywhere there was a hum of activity.
Knowing that the day would be a busy one bringing a greater than usual number of
visitors, Xi-feng had risen at four o’clock in the morning to begin her toilet. By the
time she had completed it, paid her daily tribute to nature, washed her hands, drunk
a few mouthfuls of milk, and rinsed out her mouth, it was already half past six and
Brightie’s wife, at the head of the other female domestics, had been waiting for some
considerable time in the courtyard outside. At last she emerged and stepped into the
waiting carriage. Two horn lanterns inscribed in large characters with the words

RONG-GUO HOUSE

were borne before her as she went.
     The great gate of the Ning-guo mansion was hung with lanterns and there were
rows of identical standard lanterns on each side of the gateway illuminating the
entrance with the brightness of noonday and eerily emphasizing the whiteness of the
mourning-clothes worn by the menservants lined up to receive the carriage. At their
invitation it was drawn in through the centremost of the three gates. Then the
men-servants retired and Xi-feng’s own women hurried forward and raised the
curtain of the carriage for her to descend. She did so, leaning on the shoulder of her
maid Felicity, and the two women with the lanterns led her in, lighting the way for
her as they went, while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the
Ning-guo household advanced to meet her, curtseyed, and chorused their morning
greetings. Xi-feng walked slowly through the All-scents Garden until she came to the
shrine in the Ascension Pavilion. As soon as she caught sight of the coffin the tears,
like pearls from a broken necklace, rolled in great drops down her cheeks. A number
of pages were standing stiffly in the courtyard outside awaiting the command to set
fire to the paper offerings. Xi-feng gave orders for them to begin and for tea to be
offered up inside the shrine. At once there was a clash of cymbals followed by the
mournful strains of a funeral band. An arm?chair had already been called for and set
down facing the spirit tablet. In this Xi-feng now sat, and raising her voice to a shrill
pitch, wept with abandon, whereupon the entire house?hold, high and low, male and
female, indoors and out, res?ponded by breaking into loud and prolonged
lamentation.
Presently a representative of Cousin Zhen and You-shi arrived and begged Xi-feng to
desist. Brightie’s wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with, and
when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more took
leave of various members of the clan who were present, and went off to her office in
the penthouse.
An inspection of the roster showed that all the members of her work-parties were
present except for one woman belong?ing to the group responsible for the reception
of friends of the family. Someone was sent to fetch her, and presently the woman
arrived, flustered and fearful.
‘So it is you!’ said Xi-feng with a chilling smile. I suppose you thought that because
you have a somewhat more lady-like job than the rest, you could afford to disobey
my orders!’
‘Oh no, madam, indeed not!’ said the woman. ‘I’ve been coming extra early every
day. It’s only today, because I overslept, that I’m a bit late. Please let me off this once,
madam! It really is the first time.’
Just at that moment Xi-feng observed Wang Xing’s wife from the Rong-guo mansion,
peeping round the door as if looking for a chance to speak to her.
‘Yes, what is it?’ she asked, turning away from the offender but giving her no
indication that she might go.
Wang Xing’s wife approached and said that she wanted a tally authorizing the
purchase of silk cord to be made up into carriage trimmings for the funeral. She
handed Xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written. It specified the
number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans, four
small sedans, and four carriages, and the number of pounds of silk cord that would
be required for that amount of network. Xi-feng made Sunshine read it out to her,
and having satisfied herself that the figures were correct, told him to enter them in
his book and to issue Wang Xing’s wife with one of the Rong-guo tallies, whereupon
the latter hurried off to complete her mission.
Xi-feng was about to address the latecomer when four more servants from the
Rong-guo mansion came in asking for tallies. She told them to hand over the
order-slips and made Sunshine read them out to her. Two of them contained errors,
and Xi-feng flung them down and told the bearers to ‘go away and come back when
they had got their figures right’. The two of them went off crestfallen.
     Xi-feng next observed Zhang Cai’s wife hovering about at the edge of the room
and asked her what she wanted.
‘It’s those carriage curtains, ma’am. We want the money for the tailor who made
them up.’ Xi-feng took the bill and told Sunshine to enter the figures from it in his
book. But she would not authorize Zhang Cai’s wife to pay for the tailoring until
Wang Xing’s wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer’s receipt.
There was a second piece of paper which Sunshine now read, requesting permission
to purchase paper for the windows of Bao-yu’s outer study, which had just been
redecorated. This too Xi-feng kept, and made Sunshine enter the amount in his book.
She told Zhang Cai’s wife that the goods must be supplied first before any payment
could be authorized.
‘Tomorrow another one will be late and the day after that it will be someone else,’
said Xi-feng turning to the still waiting offender, ‘and before we know where we are
we shall have no one turning up at all. I should have liked to let you off, but if I’m
lenient with you the first time, it will be that much harder for me to deal with
someone else the second time; so I am obliged to make an example of you.’ Her face
hardened as she pronounced sentence: ‘Take her out and give her twenty strokes of
the bamboo!’
Seeing that Xi-feng was really angry, the servants dared not show themselves slack in
executing her command. The wretched woman was half-dragged from the room and
the flogging administered in full view of the waiting throng, after which they came in
again, the executioners to report that they had discharged their duty and their victim
to thank Xi-feng for her punishment. Xi-feng threw down one of the Ning-guo tallies.
‘Take this to Lai Sheng and tell him to stop a month’s pay from her wages. If anyone
is late tomorrow they will get forty strokes and the day after that it will be sixty. So if
you enjoy being beaten you have only to come late for roll-call. Dismiss.’
The servants, including the shamefaced and silently weeping victim, trooped off to
their various duties.
Now began a steady stream of servants from both house?holds collecting and
returning tallies, each of whom Xi-feng attended to in a brisk and efficient manner.
From that day onwards the staff of the Ning-guo mansion realized just how
formidable Xi-feng could be and went about their duties in fear and trembling, not
daring to idle or delay.

*

    But let us now turn to Bao-yu. On this particular occasion, fearing that with so
great an influx of visitors Qin Zhong might find himself somewhat overwhelmed,
Bao-yu brought him round to Xi-feng’s office for a quiet chat.
‘Did you smell the food?’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. (She was halfway through her
lunch when they entered.) ‘Come up on the kang and have some!’
‘Thank you, but we have already eaten,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Here, or in the other house?’
‘Catch me eating here with those clowns!’ said Bao-yu. ‘No, back at home, with
Grandmother.’
He and Qin Zhong sat down, and presently Xi-feng finished her lunch. Just then a
woman came in asking for a tally with which to obtain a fresh supply of oil for the
altar lamps.
‘I calculated that you would be needing some by now,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I
thought you must have forgotten. If you had forgotten, you’d have had to pay for it
yourself. That would have suited me down to the ground!’
‘Oh no, madam! As you say, I just forgot. I only thought of it a moment ago, and I
realized that if I didn’t hurry I should be too late to get a tally.’
So saying, she took her tally and went. For a short while longer the handing over of
tallies and registering of amounts continued.
‘Both your houses use these tallies for everything,’ said Qin Zhong, who had been
watching these transactions with some interest. ‘Suppose some outsider were to
forge one and use it to get a lot of money with?’
‘Not everyone is as crooked as you are!’ said Xi-feng good? humouredly.
‘How is it that there is no one from our place coming in for tallies?’ Bao-yu asked.
‘At the time when they come,’ Xi-feng replied, ‘you are still fast asleep in bed. Now
let me ask you something. When are you going to begin studying at night?’
‘I should like nothing better than to begin today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But what can I do if
they won’t get on with my study?’
If you were to ask me nicely,’ said Xi-feng jovially, ‘I think I could undertake to hurry
them up for you.’
‘Oh, you’re no good,’ said Bao-yu, ‘no more than any of the rest. They’ll get round
to it in time. It’s just a question of waiting till they do.’
‘Whether they get round to it or not,’ said Xi-feng, ‘they still need materials for the
job, and they can’t get the materials if I don’t choose to give them the tallies—I can
tell you that for sure!’
As soon as he heard this, Bao-yu twined himself round Xi-feng and began coaxing and
wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work
on his study.
‘Stop it! Stop it! ‘ cried Xi-feng. ‘I am so tired that my bones ache. How can I stand
up to being mauled about by a great-ape like you? You needn’t worry. They’ve just
been round to see about paper for the windows. It would look pretty stupid if you
were to send them off for something they have already got.’
Bao-yu refused to believe her until she made Sunshine look up the entry in his book
and show it to him.
While Bao-yu was inspecting the book, a servant announced the arrival of Shiner, one
of the boys who had accompanied Jia Lian to Yangchow. Xi-feng eagerly ordered him
in. Shiner louted to his mistress in the Manchu fashion and hoped that she was well.
‘Why have you come back?’ said Xi-feng.
‘The Master sent me, ma’am. Mr. Lin died on the third at ten in the morning and
the Master and Miss Lin are taking him to Soochow to be buried. They expect to be
home by the end of the spring. The Master told me to bring back the news and to
give everyone his regards, and he said I was to ask Her Old Ladyship for instructions.
He also told me to see if you were getting on all right, ma’am; and he said would I
take some fur-?lined gowns back with me for winter wear.’
‘Have you seen anyone else yet?’ Xi-feng asked him.
‘Yes, everyone,’ said Shiner, and withdrew.
Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu with a smile:
‘It looks now as if your Cousin Lin will be staying with us permanently.’
‘Poor thing!’ said Bao-yu. ‘How she must have cried and cried during this past week
or so!’ The thought of her crying made him knit his brows and sigh.
Now that Shiner was back, Xi-feng was all agog to question him about Jia Lian but
could not do so in any detail in front of the others. She would have liked to follow
him back home, but her duties were by no means over, and she was obliged to hold
out until evening. Then, back in her own apartment, she summoned him to her and
asked him for full particulars of the journey. She looked out all Jia Lian’s furs, and she
and Patience sat up into the night getting them ready and packing them ---together
with anything else which careful thought suggested might be needed—for Shiner to
take back with him to his Master. Xi-feng gave Shiner minute instructions concerning
his conduct towards the latter:
‘Mind you look after your master properly away from home, now. Try not to make
him angry. And do always be on at him not to drink too much. And don’t encourage
him to get mixed up with bad women. If, when you get back, I find out that you have
done, I’ll break your legs!’
Shiner laughingly agreed to abide by all her instructions. By the time they got to bed
it was well past one in the morning. To Xi-feng it seemed as though she had barely
lain down to sleep when it was dawn once more and time to get up again and wash
and dress for another round of duties at Ning-guo House.
The day of the funeral was now approaching and Cousin Zhen took an expert in
geomancy with him in his carriage and drove out to the Temple of the Iron Threshold
to inspect the terrain and personally assist in the selection of a suitable
rest?ing-place for Qin-shi’s coffin. He gave detailed instructions to the
monk-in-charge, Father Sublimitas, for the provision of a completely new set of
hangings and altar furnishings for the funeral, and for the engagement of as many
fashionable monks as he could think of to participate in the ceremony of receiving
the coffin.
Sublimitas hurriedly prepared a vegetarian supper for his visitors; but Cousin Zhen
had little heart for eating, and, as it was by now too late to return to the city,
presently retired to a bed that had been made up for him in the monk’s quarters,
leaving first thing next morning in order to press on with arrangements for the
funeral. On his return he sent some work?men out to the temple to refurbish the
place he had chosen for the coffin. They were instructed to work on the job
through?out the night in order to make sure that it was finished in time. He also sent
out a number of kitchen staff to cater for the funeral party on its arrival.
Xi-feng, too, began to make her own careful preparations as the day of the funeral
drew near. On the one hand she had to select coachmen and bearers from the
Rong-guo staff for the carriages and sedans that Lady Wang and the other Rong-guo
ladies would ride in in the procession. On the other hand, as she fully intended to
take part in it herself, she had to find herself somewhere to stop at on the way as
well as accommodation for the night after the funeral.
The Dowager-duchess of Shan-guo happened to die just about this time and Xi-feng
had to make the arrangements for Lady Xing and Lady Wang when they paid their
visits of condolence and later when they attended the funeral. She had to see about
birthday presents for the Princess of Xi-an. She had to write to her parents and get
things ready to send to them when her elder brother Wang Ren returned with his
wife and children to the South. And when on top of all this Jia Lian’s young sister
Ying-chun fell ill and needed doctors’ visits and medicines every day, it was Xi-feng
who had to puzzle over the diagnostic reports, discuss the patient’s symptoms with
the learned physicians, and decide on the relative merits of rival prescriptions.
Indeed, so multifarious had her activities become that it would be impossible to list
them all. As a consequence she was far too busy to pay much attention to eating and
drinking and could hardly sit or lie down for a moment in peace. When she went to
the Ning-guo mansion she was followed around all the time by people from the
Rong-guo mansion, and when she went back to Rong-guo House, members of the
Ning-guo establishment would trail after her. Yet although she was so busy, a passion
to succeed and a dread of being criticized enabled her to summon up reserves of
energy, and she managed to plan everything with such exemplary thoroughness that
every member of the clan was loud in her praises.
Wake night arrived—the night when no one in the family may go to bed—and
Ning-guo House was crowded with friends and relations. Since You-shi was still
confined to her room, it was left entirely to Xi-feng to do the honours. There were, to
be sure, a number of other young married women in the clan, but all were either
tongue-tied or giddy, or they were so petrified by bashfulness or timidity that the
presence of strangers or persons of higher rank threw them into a state of panic.
Xi-feng’s vivacious charm and social assurance stood out in striking contrast—‘a
touch of scarlet in a field of green’. She was in her element, and if she took any notice
at all of her humbler sisters it was only to throw out an occasional order or to bend
them in some other way to her imperious will.
Throughout the whole of that night the Ning-guo mansion was ablaze with lights.
There was a constant bustle of guests being welcomed or seen off the premises and
all the liveliness and excitement that is customary on occasions of this sort.
With the dawning of the day and the arrival of the hour deemed auspicious for its
departure, sixty-four green-coated bearers arrived for the coffin, preceded by a great
funeral banner bearing the following inscription:
Mortal Remains
of the
Much Lamented
LADY QIN-SHI
of the
House of Jia,
Senior Great-great-granddaughter-in-law
of the
Duke of Ning-guo,
Nobleman of the First Rank by Imperial Patent,
and Wife of the
Right Honourable Jia Rong,
Honorary Captain in the Imperial Bodyguard,
Inner Palace, Northern Capital Division.

The costumes, insignia, and funeral trappings were all glitteringly new, having been
specially made for the occasion.
Jewel, acting in the capacity of unmarried daughter of the deceased, smashed a bowl
on the floor at the foot of the coffin and as they bore it out walked in front with an
impressive display of grief.
Among the distinguished guests taking part in the proces?sion were:
    Niu Ji-zong (earl, hereditary first rank), grandson of Niu Qing, Duke of Zhen-guo,
    Liu Fang (viscount, hereditary first rank), grandson of Liu Biao, Duke of Li-guo,
Chen Rui-wen (Maj.-General), grandson of Chen Yi, Duke of Qi-guo,
    Ma Shang-de (Maj.-General), grandson of Ma Kui, Duke of Zhi-guo,
Hou Xiao-kang (viscount, hereditary first rank), grandson of Hou Xiao-ming, Duke of
Xiu-guo.
The grandfathers of the above, together with the Duke of Shan-guo, whose grandson
Shi Guang-zhu was in mourning for the Dowager-duchess and unable to attend, and
the Dukes of Rong-guo and Ning-guo, had formed the well-known group often
referred to by their contemporaries as the ‘Eight Dukes’.
The other mourners included:

The grandson of H. H. the Prince of Nan-an,
The grandson of H. H. the Prince of Xi-ning,
    Shi Ding, Marquis of Zhong-jing, nephew of old Lady Jia,
Jiang Zi-ning (baron, hereditary second rank), grandson of the Marquis of Ping-yuan,
Xie Kun (baron, hereditary second rank, and lieutenant-colonel, Metropolitan
Barracks), grandson of the Marquis of Ding-cheng,
    Qi Jian-hui (baron, hereditary second rank), grandson of the Marquis of
Xiang-yang,
Qiu Liang (Chief Commissioner of Police, Metropolitan Area), grandson of the
Marquis of Jing-tian.

Also present were the Marquis of Jin-xiang’s son Han Qi, General Feng’s son Feng
Zi-ying, General Chen’s son Chen Ye-jun, General Wei’s son Wei Ruo-An, and a large
number of other young gentlemen of distinguished parentage.
As for lady guests, there were ten or so large and thirty or forty small palanquins,
which together with the palanquins and carriages of the Jia ladies brought the total
number of equipages to at least a hundred and ten. These, with the innumerable
bearers of insignia and other funeral trappings up at the front, formed a procession
altogether more than a mile long.
The procession had not advanced very far when it began to pass the decorated
‘funeral bowers’ and tables of offerings put up along the sides of the street by friends
and well-wishers of the family. From some of them the strains of funeral music struck
up as it approached.
The first of these bowers was the Princess of Dong-ping’s, the second was the Prince
of Nan-an’s, the third was the Prince of Xi-ning’s, and the fourth that of the Prince of
Bei-jing.
Of the original holders of these four titles the Prince of Bei-jing had been highest in
imperial favour by virtue of his great services to the Crown. As a consequence, the
title and the style of ‘prince’ had been retained by his descendants. The present
holder of the title, Shui Rong, was a youth still in his teens ---a young man of great
personal beauty and a modest and unaffected disposition. On receiving the
announcement of the premature demise of the wife of one of the Duke of
Ning-?guo’s descendants, Shui Rong was reminded of the friendship that had
formerly existed between the Duke of Ning-guo and his own ancestor—both having
fought in the same campaigns and shared hardships and triumphs together—and
resolved to lay aside all considerations of rank in demonstrating his sympathy for the
bereaved. Two days previously he had paid a visit of condolence and made inquiries
about the funeral arrangements, and now, today, intending to make a libation to the
coffin as it went by, he had had his booth constructed at the road side and had
instructed a number of his staff to wait there in readiness for his arrival.
At four o’clock that morning the prince had had to be present at the imperial palace
for the early levée; but, as soon as his business there was over, he changed out of
court dress and into mourning and after getting into his great palanquin, was borne
through the streets, preceded by gongs and umbrellas of state, to the place where his
funeral bower had been erected. There his palanquin was set down and the
gentlemen of his household ranged themselves on either side of it. The street was
kept clear of traffic and pedestrians while he waited.
Presently the procession came in sight, advancing from the north end of the street
like a great river, the hearse itself look?ing like some great silver mountain that
crushed the earth beneath it as it moved. In a trice the forerunners had reported
back to Cousin Zhen, who at once gave orders to the insignia bearers to halt, and
hurrying forward with his Uncles Jia She and Jia Zheng, saluted the prince with full
court etiquette. The prince received their prostrations with a gracious smile and a
slight inclination of his person inside the palanquin, and when he spoke to them it
was not as a prince to a subject, but using the form of address he employed when
speaking to family friends.
‘Your Highness, I am quite overwhelmed by the honour you do us in graciously
condescending to be present at the funeral of my daughter-in-law,’ said Cousin Zhen.
‘My dear friend,’ said the Prince of Bei-jing, ‘your excessive modesty does us both
an injustice.’
Thereupon he turned to the chamberlain of his household and ordered him to make
offerings on his behalf. Cousin Zhen and his uncles made the correct ritual responses
while this official performed them, then returned to the palanquin and bowed their
thanks to the prince. The prince received their thanks with a most becoming modesty
and by way of conversa?tion asked Jia Zheng a question about Bao-yu.
‘Which is the boy who was born with a stone in his mouth? I have long looked
forward to the pleasure of meeting him. I am sure he must be here today. Can you
not bring him to see me?’
Jia Zheng at once withdrew to fetch Bao-yu. He made him first change into court
dress before, leading him forward to meet the prince.
Bao-yu had often heard about the Prince of Bei-jing. He had heard that he was very
clever. He had also heard that he was as handsome as he was clever and that he was
a quite jolly, un?conventional sort of person who refused to let either his royal birth
or the conventions of official life constrain him. He had often wanted to meet him,
but had been deterred by his father’s strictness from doing so. And now here was the
Prince of Bei-jing asking to see him! A feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he
hurried forward with his father. He peeped up at the prince as they advanced and
saw that he was, as report had painted him, an extremely good-looking young man.
But if you want to know about his interview with the hand?some prince, you will
have to read about it in the next chapter.

At Water-moon Priory Xi-feng finds how much profit may
procured by the abuse of power
And Qin Zhong discovers the pleasures that are to
be had under the cover of darkness



Looking up, Bao-yu saw that Shui Rong’s princely headgear was embellished by way
of mourning with white bands, a white hatpin, and filigree silver ‘wings’. As a further
token of mourning his robe, though heavily bordered with a ‘tooth and wave’ design
of rainbow-coloured stripes and gold-emblazoned with the royal five-clawed dragon,
was of a white material. It was confined at the waist by a red leather belt, studded
with green jade. The splendid costume, the luminous eyes, the finely chiselled
features really did make him an arrestingly handsome young man. Bao-yu started
forward impulsively to make his salutation, but the prince extended an arm from the
palanquin and prevented him from kneeling.
     Bao-yu was wearing a little silver coronet on the top of his head and a silver
headband round his brow in the form of two dragons emerging from the sea. He had
on a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of white material and a silver belt inlaid with
pearls. After studying these and admiring the flowerlike face and coal-black eyes, the
prince’s face broke into a smile.
         ‘If “Bao-yu” means “precious jade”, you are appropriately named,’ he said.
‘But where is the famous stone you were born with?’
     Bao-yu hurriedly extracted the jade from inside his clothing and taking it off,
handed it to the prince, who scrutinized it carefully, reciting the words of the
inscription as he deciphered them.
     ‘And does it really have these powers?’ he asked.
     ‘It is only alleged to,’ Jia Zheng put in hastily. ‘We have never put them to the
test.’
     The prince pronounced the stone a great wonder and with his own hands
refastened its plaited silken cord round Bao-yu’s neck. Then, taking one of Bao-yu’s
hands in his own, he asked him how old he was, what books he was studying, and
other such questions, to all of which Bao-yu gave prompt replies.
     Delighted that everything Bao-yu said was so clear and to the point, the prince
observed to Jia Zheng that ‘the young phoenix was worthy of his sire.
‘I trust I shall not offend you by saying so to your face,’ he said, ‘but I venture to
prophesy that this fledgling of yours will one day “sing sweeter than the parent bird”.’
Jia Zheng smiled politely.
‘My son is doubtless unworthy of the compliment Your Highness is good enough to
pay him. If; thanks to your en?couragement, he turns out as you say, we shall count
ourselves truly fortunate.’
‘There is only one drawback in possessing such charm,’ said the prince. ‘I am sure it
must make his grandmother dote upon him; and, unfortunately, being the object of
too much affection is very bad for people of our years. It leads us to neglect our
studies. This used at one time to be the case with me, and I suspect is now the case
with your son. If he does find difficulty in working at home, he would be very
welcome to come round to my palace. I do not pretend to be a gifted person myself;
but I am fortunate in counting distinguished writers from all over the empire among
my acquaintances, and my palace is a rendezvous for them when they are in the
capital, so that I never want for intellectual company. By constantly mixing and
conversing with such people at my palace, your son could do much to improve his
education.’
‘Yes.’ Jia Zheng bowed deferentially.
The Prince of Bei-jing removed a rosary from his wrist and handed it to Bao-yu.
‘Today is our first meeting, but as it was an unforeseen one, I have not come
prepared with a suitable gift. All I can offer you is this rosary made of the aromatic
seeds of some Indian plant. It was given me by his Imperial Majesty. I hope you will
accept it as a little token of my esteem.’
Bao-yu took the rosary and turning back offered it respect?fully to Jia Zheng, who
made his son join him in formally thanking the prince for his gift.
At this point Jia She and Cousin Zhen knelt before the prince and invited him to
return.
‘The Departed is now in paradise,’ said the prince. ‘Though I enjoy imperial favour
and princely rank, I would not presume to go past her carriage. Heavenly honours
take precedence over earthly ones!’
When they saw that the prince was adamant, Jia She and the rest bowed their thanks,
then, having ordered the musicians to vail their instruments and march by in silence,
they caused the front part of the procession and the hearse to pass over the junction.
As soon as the hearse had gone over, the prince and his retinue crossed in the other
direction, after which the rear part of the procession moved forward and caught up
with the rest.



*
The liveliness which attended the procession during the whole of its progress
through the city reached a climax as it ap?proached the city gate, for it was along this
last stretch that the colleagues and office juniors of Jia She, Jia Zheng and Cousin
Zhen had arranged their bowers, and it was necessary to stop and thank each one of
them as they made their offerings to the passing hearse. They did at last succeed in
getting out of the city gate, however, after which a clear road lay ahead all the way to
the Temple of the Iron Threshold. Cousin Zhen went round with Jia Rong to the
senior men among the mourners and invited them to proceed from there onwards by
the transport provided. The upshot was that those of Jia She’s generation got into
carriages and sedans, while Cousin Zhen and the younger men mounted on
horseback.
Xi-feng was worried about Bao-yu. Out in the country, she thought, he was liable to
become wild and disobedient. She felt sure that he would get up to some kind of
mischief now that he was removed from Jia Zheng’s restraint. Accordingly she sent
one of her pages to summon him, and presently he rode up to her carriage.
‘Bao dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘a person of your refinement belongs here with us. You
don’t want to go clomping around the countryside like apes on horseback with those
horrid men! Why not get in with me? The two of us will keep each other company.’
Bao-yu at once dismounted and climbed up into the carriage, and the two of them
drove on, laughing and chattering as they went. They had not been driving very long
when two horse?men galloped up beside them, dismounted, and leaning into the
carriage, informed Xi-feng that they were now near her stopping-place, in case she
wished to get out and ‘stretch her legs’. Xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask Lady Xing
and Lady Wang for instructions. The latter sent back word that they had no desire to
stop, themselves, but that Xi-feng was wel?come to do so if she wished. Xi-feng
accordingly gave orders for a short halt. At once the pages led the horses out of the
main stream of traffic and headed northwards down a small side-road.
Bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetch Qin Zhong, who was riding along behind
his father’s sedan. As the page came hurrying up and asked him to stop with Bao-yu
for a little refreshment, he turned round and saw Bao-yu’s horse in the distance,
jogging along in a northerly direction with an empty saddle on its back behind
Xi-feng’s carriage, and he realized that Bao-yu must be inside the carriage with
Xi-feng. Turning his horse’s head about, he hurried after, and followed them into the
gateway of a farm.

Apart from the barns and outhouses, the farmhouse con?sisted of little more than a
single large room, so that there was nowhere the farmer’s womenfolk could go to be
out of the way of the visitors. The sudden appearance in their midst of Xi-feng,
Bao-yu and Qin Zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed
to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one.
As soon as they were inside the thatched central building, Xi-feng asked the boys to
amuse themselves outside. Bao-yu realized that she needed to be alone, and
conducted Qin Zhong and the pages on a tour of the farmyard. He had never in his
life seen any of the farming implements before, and was very curious. One of his
pages who had some experience of country matters was able to name each
implement for him and explain its functions. Bao-yu was impressed.
‘Now I can understand the words of the old poet,’ he said:

‘Each grain of rice we ever ate
Cost someone else a drop of sweat.’

At that moment they came to an outhouse in which was a kang with a
spinning-wheel on it. Bao-yu was even more intrigued.
‘That’s for spinning yarn with to make cloth out of,’ said the pages.
Bao-yu at once got up on the kang and had just started to turn it when a country lass
of seventeen or eighteen summers came running up:
‘Don’t! You’ll spoil it!’
She was shouted at fiercely by the pages, but Bao-yu had already stayed his hand.
‘I’m sorry. I’ve never seen one before. I was just turning it for fun, to see how it
works.’
‘You don’t know how to turn it properly,’ said the girl. Let me show you how ‘tis
done.’
Qin Zhong gave Bao-yu a sly tug:
‘A comely damosel, thinkest thou nottest?’
‘Shut up, or I’ll clout you!’ said Bao-yu, pushing him.
During this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning. She did, indeed, make a
charming picture as she bent over her work. Suddenly an old woman’s voice called
out from the other side of the yard:
‘Ertie! Come here at once my gal.’
The girl jumped up from her spinning and hurried over. Bao-yu’s spirits were quite
dashed by her abrupt departure.
But just then someone came from Xi-feng inviting the boys indoors. They found her
washed and changed. She asked them if they wanted to ‘change’ too, but Bao-yu
replied that they did not. Then a variety of cakes and sweets were brought in by the
servants, and fragrant tea was poured for them to drink. When the three had taken
their fill of these refreshments and everything had been cleared away and re?packed
by the servants, they rose up and got back into their carriage.
Outside in the yard Brightie handed the farmer’s family their payment, which he had
brought with him ready-wrapped in coloured paper, and the womenfolk hurried up
to the carriage to express their thanks. Bao-yu scanned their faces carefully, but could
not see his spinning-girl amongst them. They had not driven far, however, when he
caught sight of her at the end of the village. She was standing watching for him
beside the road, a baby brother in her arms and two little girls at her side. Bao-yu
could not repress a strong emotion on seeing her, but sitting there in the carriage
there was not much he could do but gaze back at her soulfully; and soon, as the
carriage bowled along at a smarter pace, Ertie was lost to sight for ever.
With talk and laughter to beguile them, the journey passed quickly. Soon they had
caught up with the main procession; soon the sound of drums and cymbals was
heard and they could see ahead of them the banners and umbrellas of the monks
from the Temple of the Iron Threshold who had come out in procession and lined
either side of the road to welcome them; and soon they were inside the temple,
where further ceremonies awaited them, a new staging having been erected for this
purpose. The coffin was installed in one of the side-chapels leading off the inner hall,
and Jewel arranged her sleeping-quarters near by to continue her watch over it.
In the outer hall Cousin Zhen was busy attending to his guests, some of whom were
staying on, while others wished to leave immediately. To each he tendered formal
thanks for their trouble in coming. They left in order of seniority; duke’s kin going
first, then those of marquises, then those of earls, then those of viscounts, then
those of barons, and so on down?wards. It was three o’clock by the time the last of
them had gone.
Xi-feng received the lady guests inside. They, too, left in order of precedence and had
not finally dispersed until around two o’clock. Only members of the clan and a few
very close friends stayed behind to see the ceremonies through to their conclusion
two days later.
Lady Xing and Lady Wang were among those who left. They could see that Xi-feng
would be unable to return that day and wanted to take Bao-yu back with them into
town. But Bao-yu, after his first taste of the countryside, was extremely loth to return
and begged to stay with Xi-feng; so Lady Wang went without him, leaving him in
Xi-feng’s charge.
The Temple of the Iron Threshold was a private foundation of the Dukes of Ning-guo
and Rong-guo which still had some land of its own in which members of the clan who
died in the capital could be given temporary burial. The thoughtful Dukes had
provided accommodation not only for the dead but also for the living, in the form of
guest-rooms in which mourners might temporarily reside until their funereal
busi?ness was over What the old gentlemen had not foreseen was that their
multitudinous progeny would come in time to exhibit differences of wealth and
temperament so extreme as often to render their possessors mutually intolerable
and that, whereas the more hard-up members of the clan gladly occupied the
accommodation provided, the more affluent or preten?tious found it ‘inconvenient’
to stay there and preferred to seek alternative accommodation in the farmsteads and
convents round about.
Xi-feng was among those who found the Iron Threshold accommodation
‘inconvenient’. Some time previously she had sent someone to Wheat-cake Priory to
make arrangements on her behalf with the prioress Euergesia, and the old nun had
turned out several rooms in readiness for her arrival. ‘Wheat-cake Priory’ (so-called
because of the excellent steamed wheat bread made in its kitchens) was the popular
name for Water-moon Priory, an offshoot of Water-moon Abbey situated at no great
distance from the Temple of the Iron Threshold.
Presently, when the monks had finished their service and the evening offering of tea
had been made, Cousin Zhen sent Jia Rong in to Xi-feng with a message inviting her
to retire. Having first glanced round to ascertain that a sufficient number of Jia ladies
were present to look after the still remaining guests, Xi-feng bade the company good
night and left for Wheat-cake Priory with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had
attached himself to the other two when his father Qin Bang-ye, unable by reason of
his age and frail state of health to risk a night away from home, had gone back to the
city, leav?ing him to await the conclusion of the requiem services on his own.
They soon arrived at the priory and were met by Euergesia, who had brought her two
little disciples Benevolentia and Sapientia to welcome them. As soon as the first
greetings were over, Xi-feng retired to her room to wash and change. Emerg?ing
refreshed, she observed how much taller Sapientia had grown and how radiantly
good-looking, and inquired of Euergesia why she and her two charges had lately not
been into town to see them.
‘It is on account of Mr. Hu’s good lady,’ said the old nun. ‘She has lately been
brought to bed of a boy, and sent us ten taels of silver for a three-day recital of the
Lake of Blood sutra by some of the sisters to purge the stain of childbirth. We have
been so busy with the arrangements that we haven’t had time to call.’
Let us leave Xi-feng in conversation with the prioress and turn to the other two.
Qin Zhong and Bao-yu were amusing themselves in the main hall of the priory when
Sapientia happened to pass through.
‘Here’s Sappy,’ said Bao-yu with a meaningful smile.
‘Well, what about it?’ said Qin Zhong.
‘Now, now, stop play-acting!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I saw you holding her that day at
Grandma’s when you thought nobody else was about. You needn’t think you can fool
me after that!’
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
‘All right then. Never mind whether you know what I’m talking about or not. Just
ask her to pour me out a cup of tea, will you, and then we’ll let the subject drop.’
‘What sort of joke is this? Why can’t you ask her yourself? She’d pour it out just the
same for you. Why ask me to tell her?’
‘I couldn’t do it with the same feeling as you. There’ll be much more feeling in it if
you ask her.’
He finally prevailed upon Qin Zhong to make the request.
‘Oh, all right! - Sappy, pour us a cup of tea, will you?’
Sapientia had been a regular visitor at the Rong-guo mansion ever since she was a
little girl and was familiar with all its inmates. The innocence of her childish rompings
with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong had latterly, however—now that she had reached
adolescence—given way to a more mature emotion. She had fallen in love with Qin
Zhong, whose every feature and lineament now inspired her with romantic feelings;
and Qin Zhong, captivated by her developing charms, had responded by loving her
back. Although nothing serious had as yet passed between them, in their inclinations
and affections they were already united.
Sapientia hurried out and returned with a cup of tea.
‘Give it to me, Sappy!’ said Qin Zhong.
‘No, give it to me, Sappy I’ said Bao-yu.
She stood between them, pouting prettily, and gave a little laugh:
‘Surely you’re not going to fight over a cup of tea? I must have honey on my hands
I’
Bao-yu snatched the cup before Qin Zhong could do so and began drinking. He was
about to say something when Benevo?lentia came in and fetched Sapientia away to
help her lay the table. She was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and
cakes; but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts, and after
sitting a short while for the sake of politeness, were soon off to amuse themselves
else?where.
Xi-feng, too, soon left, and retired to her private room to rest, Euergesia
accompanying her. By this time the older servants, seeing that there was nothing
further for them to do, had one by one drifted off to bed, leaving only a few personal
maids, all of whom were in Xi-feng’s confidence, in attend?ance. The old nun
deemed it safe to broach a private matter in their hearing.
‘There is something I have been meaning to call at your house and ask Her Ladyship
about, but I should like to have your opinion on it first before I see her.’
‘What do you want to ask her?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Bless his Holy Name!’ the prioress began piously. ‘When I was a nun at the
Treasures in Heaven Convent in Chang-an, one of the convent’s benefactors was a
very wealthy man called Zhang, who had a daughter called Jin-ge. A certain young Mr.
Li, who is brother-in-law to the Governor of Chang-an, met her once when she was
making an incense? offering in our temple and took a violent liking to her. He at once
sent someone to the parents to ask for her hand in marriage, but unfortunately she
was already betrothed to the son of a captain in the Chang-an garrison and the
betrothal-presents had already been accepted. The Zhangs would have liked to
cancel the betrothal but were afraid that the captain would object, so they told Li’s
matchmaker that the girl was already engaged. But oh dear! young Mr. Li wouldn’t
take no for an answer, and the Zhangs were quite at their wit’s end, being now in
trouble with both parties. You see, when the captain got to hear of these goings-on
he was most unreason?able. He came rushing along in a great rage and made a most
terrible scene. ‘Just how many young men is this girl be?trothed to?” he said, and so
on and so forth. He refused out?fight to take back the betrothal-gifts and straightway
began an action for breach of promise. By now the Zhangs were really upset and sent
to the capital for some moral support -- for they are now quite determined to break
off their daughter’s en?gagement, seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable.
‘Well, it occurred to me that the Area Commander for Chang-an, General Yun, is on
very good terms with your husband’s family, and I thought I might try to find some
way of persuading Her Ladyship to talk to Sir Zheng about this and get him to write a
letter to General Yun and ask him to have a word with this captain. It is hardly likely
that he would refuse to obey his commanding officer. The Zhangs would gladly pay
anything—even if it meant bankrupting themselves ---in return for this kindness.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘It doesn’t sound very difficult. The only difficulty is that Lady Wang doesn’t touch
this kind of thing any more.’
‘If Her Ladyship won’t, what about you, Mrs Lian?’
Xi-feng laughed again.
‘I’m not short of money; and besides, I don’t touch that sort of thing either.’
Euergesia’s face assumed an expression of great benignity. After sitting for a while in
silence she sighed.
‘It’s a pity I let the Zhangs know that I was going to talk to you about this,’ she said.
‘Now if you don’t do this favour for them, they will never believe that it is because
you haven’t the time or don’t want the money; they will take it as a sign that you are
not able.’
This put Xi-feng on her mettle.
‘You’ve known me a long time,’ she said. ‘You know that I’ve never believed all that
talk about hell and damnation. If I decide that I want to do something I do it, no
matter what it is. Tell them that if they are prepared to pay out three thousand taels
of silver, I will undertake to relieve them of their trouble.’
The prioress was delighted.
‘They will! They will! No doubt about it!’
‘Mind you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’m not one of your money-grubbing run-of-the-mill
go-betweens. I’m not doing this for the money. Every bit of this three thousand taels
will go into the pockets of my boys or towards their expenses. I shan’t touch a penny
of it. If it was money I wanted, I could lay my hands on thirty thousand taels at this
very moment.’
‘Well, that’s nicely settled!’ said the prioress. ‘So can we lo6k forward to your kind
help in this matter tomorrow? We may as well get it over and done with.’
‘You can see how busy I am and how impossible it is for me to get away,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘I’ve told you I’ll do it, and so I will -- in my own time. Surely that is enough
for you?’
‘A little thing like this might seem a great deal of trouble to some people;’ said the
old nun artfully, ‘but even if it involved more than it does, it would still be nothing to
a capable person like you, Mrs Lian. You know what they say: “The able man gets
little leisure” that’s why Her Ladyship leaves everything to you. She knows how
capable you are. Of course, you have to be careful that you don’t overtax yourself.
Your health is precious!’
Soothed by such flatteries, Xi-feng forgot her weariness, and the conversation
continued with animation.
Meanwhile Qin Zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that there
was no one much about to prosecute his designs on Sapientia. He found her on her
own in one of the rooms at the back of the priory washing up tea-things. Throwing
his arms around her from behind, he gave her a kiss. Sapientia stamped with
vexation:
‘What are you doing? Stop it!’
She was about to call out, but Qin Zhong spoke entreat?ingly:
‘Darling Sappy! I want you so desperately! If you won’t let me, I’ll just lie down and
die!’
‘If you want me,’ said Sapientia, ‘you must first get me out of this hole and away
from these people. Then you can do what you like.’
‘That’s easy,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘But “distant water is no cure for a present thirst” ...’
And with that he blew out the light, plunging the room into inky darkness, and
carried Sapientia on to the kang. She struggled hard to get up—though still not
daring to call out; but soon, almost before she knew it, her breech-clout was off and
the ship was in the harbour.
Suddenly, in less time than it takes to tell, a third person bore down on them from
above and held them fast. The intruder made no sound, and for some moments the
other two lay underneath his weight, half dead with fright. Then there was a splutter
of suppressed laughter and they knew that it was Bao-yu.
‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ said Qin Zhong crossly, as he scrambled to
his feet.
‘If you won’t let me, darling,’ Bao-yu mimicked, ‘I’ll call Out!’
Poor Sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark.
Bao-yu hauled Qin Zhong from the room.
‘Now,’ he said: ‘are you still going to pretend that Sappy means nothing to you?’
‘Look, be a good chap! I’ll do anything you say as long as you promise not to shout.’
‘We won’t say any more about it just now,’ said Bao-yu genially. ‘Wait until we are
both in bed and I’ll settle accounts with you then.’
Bedtime soon came and they partially undressed and settled down for the night,
Xi-feng in an inner room and Bao-yu and Qin Zhong in an outer room adjoining it. As
there were numerous old women on night duty lying about everywhere on the floor
wrapped up in their bedding, Xi-feng was afraid that the ‘Magic Jade’ might
disappear in the course of the night; so as soon as Bao-yu was in bed she sent
someone to fetch it from him, and put it under her own pillow for safety.
As for the ‘settling of accounts’ that Bao-yu had proposed to Qin Zhong, we have
been unable to ascertain exactly what form this took; and as we would not for the
world be guilty of a fabrication, we must allow the matter to remain a mystery.
Next day someone arrived from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to see how Bao-yu
was getting on. He was coun?selled to dress up well against the cold and to come
back home if there was nothing further to do. Bao-yu was most unwilling to return
on his own account, and his unwillingness was re?inforced by the promptings of Qin
Zhong, who was anxious to see more of Sapientia and urged him to ask Xi-feng for
another day.
Xi-feng reflected a little. The main business of the funeral was now over, but a
sufficient number of minor matters still remained to be done to justify their staying
on another day if they wanted to. Three arguments in favour of staying presented
themselves to her mind:
1.It would be a gesture of considerateness to Cousin Zhen which would increase his
indebtedness to her.
     2.It would give her a breathing-space in which to get Euergesia’s business
attended to.
3.It would make Bao-yu happy, which would put her in good odour with
Grandmother Jia.
Having now made her mind up, Xi-feng acceded to Bao-yu’s request in the following
terms:
‘My own business here is all finished now, but if you want to amuse yourselves a bit
longer, I suppose I must resign myself to staying. However, we definitely must go back
tomorrow.’
When Bao-yu heard this it was all ‘dearest Feng’ this and ‘darling Feng’ that, and he
promised faithfully to return on the morrow without demur. Accordingly it was
settled that they should stay for one more night.
Xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain Euergesia’s business to
Brightie. Brightie grasped the situation at once, hurried into town, sought out a
public letter-writer, had a letter written in Jia Lian’s name to the captain’s
commanding officer, and set off for Chang-an over?night bearing the spurious
missive with him.
     Chang-an is only thirty or 50 miles from the capital, so that Brightie could finish
his business and be back again within a couple of days. The general’s name was Yun
Guang. He was indebted to the Jia family for a number of past kindnesses and was
only too ‘pleased to be of service to them in a matter of such trifling importance. He
said as much in the letter of reply which he gave Brightie to carry back with him. But
that part of his mission is omitted from our story.
When their second day at the priory was over, Xi-feng and the boys took leave of
Euergesia, and as she said good-bye, Xi-feng told the prioress to call at the Rong-guo
mansion m two days’ time to hear the news from Chang-an.
This parting was an unbearably painful one for Sapientia and Qin Zhong, and all sorts
of secret vows were exchanged and whispered contracts made before they could tear
them?selves apart. We omit all details of that harrowing scene.
Xi-feng called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on the way back to see that
everything was in order. jewel, it seemed, refused absolutely to go back home, and
Cousin Zhen was obliged to leave a woman or two at the temple to keep her
company.
Their return, and the events which followed it, will be dealt with in the following
chapter.

CHAPTER 16
Jia Yuan-chun is selected for g1orious promotion
to the Imperial Bedchamber
And Qin Zhong is summoned for premature departure
on the journey into Night



Xi-feng, Qin Zhong and Bao-yu, as we have said, called in at the Temple of the Iron
Threshold on their way home. After looking round for a while, the three of them got
back into their carriage and continued their journey into the city. Home once more,
they first called on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then went off to their
several rooms. But of the rest of that day and the night which followed, our story
says nothing.
Next morning Bao-yu found that his outer study had now been finished and was
ready for use. He looked forward to beginning night-work in it with Qin Zhong, in
accordance with a promise they had made each other. But unfortunately Qin Zhong’s
always sickly constitution had been much neglected during their two-day excursion
into the country, and the unwonted exposure to wind and cold and immoderate
indulgence in secret frolic with Sapientia had resulted on his return in a cough and
chill accompanied by total loss of appetite. Altogether he presented so sorry a
spectacle that study was quite out of the question and they were obliged to send him
back home to bed. Although Bao-yu was very dis?appointed, there was nothing at all
he could do but wait for his friend to get better.
Xi-feng had now received Yun Guang’s reply to the bogus letter, expressing his
readiness to comply with her (or, as he supposed, Jia Lian’s) request. Euergesia
communicated this information to the Zhangs; and soon the captain, swallowing his
anger and resentment as best he could, was obliged to receive back the betrothal
gifts he had sent them on behalf of his son. But Jin-ge possessed a far nobler spirit
than might have been expected in the daughter of such mercenary parents. On
learning that her affianced had been sent packing, she quietly went off and hanged
herself in her scarf. The captain’s son, too, turned out to be a young person of
unexpectedly romantic notions, for on hearing that Jin-ge had hanged her?self, he
promptly threw himself into a river and was drowned. The Zhangs and the Lis were
thus left in a very unenviable situation:


‘the maid and eke the money gone’

in the words of the poet. The only gainer was Xi-feng, who now had three thousand
taels of silver to sit back and enjoy at her leisure. Not an inkling of this affair reached
the ears of Lady Wang.
Emboldened by this taste of success, Xi-feng from now on undertook many more
ventures of a similar nature -- far more than we could give an account of in this
history.
*
The day of Jia Zheng’s birthday arrived and all the members of the Ning-guo and
Rong-guo households were gathered together to celebrate it. Just as the festivities
were at their height, one of the janitors from the main gate burst in on the
assembled company:
‘The Master of the Imperial Bedchamber Mr Xia is on his way, sir, with an
announcement from His Majesty the Emperor!’
Jia She, Jia Zheng and the rest were taken completely by surprise, quite unable to
guess what the meaning of this visitation could be. Hurriedly giving orders for the
players to halt their performance and for all traces of the feast to be cleared away,
they caused a table with burning incense (which would be required for the reading of
the Proclamation, if there was one) to beset down in its place. Then, throwing open
the centre of the three main gates, they knelt down in the entrance of the mansion
to receive their visitor.
Soon Xia Bing-zhong, the Eunuch Master of the Bedchamber, arrived on horseback
with a retinue of eunuchs at his back. He appeared to have no Imperial Proclamation
or other document on his person, for instead of dismounting, as etiquette prescribed
that he should if he was carrying a Written Instrument, he rode straight on to the
foot of the main hall. There, with beaming countenance, he got down from his horse,
climbed the steps, faced south and gave utterance to the following announcement:
‘By order of His Imperial Majesty:
Jia Zheng is commanded to present himself at court im?mediately for private
audience with His Imperial Majesty in the Hall of Reverence.’
Having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for
so much as a cup of tea and rode away. Still no wiser, Jia Zheng hurried into his court
dress and hastened to the Palace, leaving Grandmother Jia and the rest in an extreme
state of alarm which they endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to allay by dispatching a
regular stream of mounted couriers post-haste to the Palace to inquire for news.
About four hours later Lai Da, the Chief Steward of the Rong-guo mansion, and three
or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out
congratulations.
‘Master’s orders,’ said Lai Da between breaths: ‘will Her Old Ladyship please bring
Their Ladyships to the Palace to give thanks to His Majesty for the great favour he has
shown us!’
Unable in her agitated state to remain indoors, Grandmother Jia had been waiting
outside in the loggia, whither the others --Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi, Li Wan,
Xi-feng, Aunt Xue and the girls -- had also congregated to await news of Jia Zheng.
Grandmother Jia called Lai Da inside to explain his cryptic message in somewhat
greater detail.
‘We servants were all waiting in an anteroom,’ Lai Da told her, ‘and we had no idea
what was going on inside. Eventually Mr. Xia came out and saw us waiting there.
“Congratulations!” he said. “Your eldest young lady has been appointed Chief
Secretary to the Empress and is to become an Imperial Concubine.” Then after that
Master came out, too, and told us the same thing. “I have to go off to the East Palace
now,” he said, “to see the Prince. But you must hasten back as quick as you can and
tell Their Ladyships to come to the Palace and give thanks.”‘
Lai’s Da information at once dispelled the anxiety that Grandmother Jia and the
others had all this time been feeling, and the worried looks on their faces quickly
gave way to smiles of pleasure. Now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed
herself in the costume appropriate to her rank. Then off they went to the Palace in
four sedans one behind the other: Grand?mother Jia’s at the head, then Lady Xing’s,
then Lady Wang’s, and then You-shi’s. Jia She and Cousin Zhen also changed into
court dress, and taking Jia Rong and Jia Qiang with them, accompanied Grandmother
Jia to the Palace as her male escort.
There was one person who did not share the unbounded delight now general among
the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households—who behaved, indeed,
almost as if he had not heard the news at all. This person was Bao-yu. What was the
reason for his unsociable lack of enthusiasm on this occasion?
A short time previously the little nun Sapientia had ab?sconded from Water-moon
Priory and made her way into the city to look for Qin Zhong. Qin Bang-ye had
discovered her, driven her from the house, and given Qin Zhong a beating. The shock
and anger of the discovery had brought on an attack of the illness from which the old
gentleman was a chronic sufferer, and within only four or five days he had breathed
his last. Qin Zhong had always been of a weak and nervous disposition and had still
not fully recovered from his sickness when these events occurred. The severe beating
followed by the overwhelming grief and remorse attendant on the death of his father
from anger which he had himself provoked led to serious complications in his illness.
This, then, was the reason for Bao-yu’s unseasonable melancholy—a melancholy
which the news of his sister Yuan?-chun’s dazzling promotion was powerless to dispel.
Grand?mother Jia’s visit to the Palace to give thanks, her return home, the visits of
friends and relations to congratulate the family, the unwontedly cheerful bustle of
the Ning and Rong households during the days that followed, the general
satisfac?tion that everyone in those households now seemed to feel—as far as
Bao-yu was concerned these things might just as well not have been: he viewed them
with the eyes of an outsider. The rest of the family merely laughed at him, seeing in
this be?haviour only further confirmation of their belief that he was ‘a bit touched’.
But then there was Jia Lian’s and Dai-yu’s homecoming to look forward to. The
advent of the messenger sent on ahead to announce that they would be arriving next
day produced the first glimmer of cheerfulness that Bao-yu had so far shown. On
being questioned for further details the messenger told them that Jia Yu-cun was also
returning to the capital to have an audience with the Emperor. This was the doing of
Wang Zi-teng, who had recommended him in a report to the throne for promotion to
a metropolitan post. As he was both a cousin (albeit a remote one) of. Jia Lian and
also Dai-yu’s former teacher, it had been resolved that he should travel with them.
Lin Ru-hai having been laid with his ancestors in the family burying-ground and his
obsequies duly concluded, they would, if they had proceeded to the capital by the
usual stages, have been arriving back some time in the following month; but when Jia
Lian heard the news about Yuan-chun’s elevation, they had decided to make greater
speed, travelling by night as well as by day. The journey had been smooth and
uneventful.
Bao-yu merely asked if Dai-yu was all right, and on being assured that she was, paid
no further attention to the man’s news.
Having waited with great impatience until the early afternoon of the following day,
Bao-yu and the rest were rewarded with the announcement ‘Mr Lian and Miss Lin
have just arrived!’ The joy of their reunion was, however, tempered with grief,
because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting, and for a while
there was much loud weeping on either side. Then there were words of comfort and
congratula?tion to exchange and Bao-yu had an opportunity of studying Dai-yu more
carefully. He recognized the same ethereal quality he had always known in her, but it
seemed to have deepened and intensified during her absence.
She had brought a lot of books back with her and was soon busy superintending the
sweeping out of her bedroom to accommodate them and arranging various objets
d’art around it which had also formed part of her luggage. She had salvaged some
paper, writing-brushes and other articles of stationery from her old home which she
distributed as presents to Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Bao-yu and the rest. Bao-yu for his
part hunted up the rosary of fragrant Indian beads given him by the Prince of Bei-jing
and offered it as a gift to Dai-yu; but she flung it back at him disdainfully:
‘What, carry a thing that some coarse man has pawed over? I don’t want it!’
So Bao-yu was compelled to take it back again.
But let us now turn to Jia Lian.
When he had finished seeing everyone in the family, Jia Lian returned at last to his
own apartment. Xi-feng, though still so busy that she had not a moment’s leisure,
had somehow contrived to find time to welcome back her wandering lord.
‘Congratulations, Imperial Kinsman!’ she said with a smile when, except for the
servants, they were at last alone together. ‘You have had a tiring journey, Imperial
Kinsman. Yesterday when the courier gave notice of your arrival, I prepared a humble
entertainment to celebrate your homecoming. Will the Imperial Kinsman graciously
condescend to take a cup of wine with his handmaid?’
Jia Lian replied in the same vein:
‘Madam, you are too kind! I am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant,
ma’am!’
As they joked together, Patience and the other maids came forward to welcome their
Master back, after which they served them both with tea. Jia Lian asked Xi-feng
about the events that had occurred during his absence and thanked her for looking
after things so well while he was away.
‘I am not much of a manager really,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t got the knowledge, and
I’m too poor at expressing myself and too simple-minded --- always inclined to “take
a ramrod for a needle”, as they say. Besides, I’m too soft-hearted for the job. Anyone
who says a few kind words can get the better of me. And my lack of experience
makes me so nervous. Aunt Wang only had to be the slightest bit displeased and I
would get so upset that I couldn’t sleep at night. I begged her not to make me do all
these things, but she insisted. She said I only refused out of laziness and
unwillingness to learn. I don’t think she realizes even now the state I have been in—
too seated to move or even to open my mouth for fear of saying or doing something
wrong. And you know what a difficult lot those old stewardesses are. The tiniest
mistake and they are all laughing at you and making fun; the tiniest hint of
favouritism and they are grumbling and complaining. You know their way of “cursing
the oak-tree when they mean the ash”. Those old women know just how to sit on the
mountain-top and watch the tigers fight; how to murder with a borrowed knife, or
help the wind to fan the fire. They will look on safely from the bank while you are
drowning in the river. And the fallen oil-bottle can drain away: they are not going to
pick it up. On top of that, as I am so young, I haven’t got much authority over them;
so it was all I could do to prevent them from ignoring me altogether. And to crown it
all, when Rong’s wife died Cousin Zhen kept coming round to see Aunt Wang and
begging her on his knees to let me help out for a day or two next door. I said again
and again that I couldn’t do it; but Aunt Wang agreed just to please him, so there was
nothing for it but to do as I was told. I’m afraid I made a terrible mess of it—even
worse than I did here. And now it seems Cousin Zhen is beginning to grumble and
says he wishes he had never asked me. When you see him tomorrow, do please try to
make it up with him. Tell him it’s because I’m young and inexperienced. You might
even hint that it’s his own fault for having asked me in the first place!’
While she was saying this there was a sound of talking in the next room.
‘Who is it?’ said Xi-feng.
Patience came in to reply.
‘Mrs. Xue sent Caltrop over to ask me about something. I’ve already given her an
answer and sent her back.’
‘Ah yes!’ said Jia Lian, apparently pleased by the recollec?tion. ‘When I went to call
on Aunt Xue just now to tell her I was back, I ran into such a pretty young woman! I
couldn’t place her as any of the girls in our household, so in the course of
conversation I asked Aunt Xue who she was. It seems that she’s the little maid they
had that lawsuit about. Cal—something. Caltrop. She’s finally been given as
“chamber-wife” to that idiot Xue, Now that she has been plucked and painted like a
grown-up woman she really does look most attractive! What a waste to throw away a
beautiful girl on that great booby!’
Xi-feng made a little moue.
‘I should have thought that having just got back from Hangchow and Soochow and
seen something of the world, you would have settled down a bit; but I see you are
still the same greedy-guts as ever. Well, if you want her, there’s nothing simpler: I’ll
exchange our Patience for her. You know what Cousin Xue is like: always “one eye on
the dish and the other on the saucepan”. Throughout the whole of this last year
there have been I don’t know how many alarms and excursions between him and
poor Aunt Xue because she wouldn’t let him get his hands on Caltrop. It wasn’t just
her looks that made her concerned for the girl. Everything about her is so unusual.
She is so gentle and so quiet. Even among our own young ladies there is scarcely her
equal. In the end Aunt Xue decided that if she couldn’t stop him having her, at least
she could make sure that the thing was done properly, with a party and invitations
and all the rest of it. So that’s what she did, and made her his chamber wife. But
would you believe it, before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost
interest. . .!’
She was interrupted by an announcement from one of the pages on the inner gate:
‘Mr Zhen wants you, sir. He’s waiting for you in the larger study.’
At once jia Lian did up his gown and hurried out.
‘What on earth did Mrs. Xue want, sending Caltrop here like that?’ Xi-feng asked
Patience as soon as he had gone.
‘It wasn’t Caltrop!’ said Patience. ‘I had to make something up and hers was the
first name that came to mind. That wife of Brightie’s is such a stupid woman! Just
imagine’—she drew closer to Xi-feng’s ear and lowered her voice—‘of all the times
she could have chosen to bring you the interest on that money, she had to pick on
the very moment when the Master has just got home! It’s lucky I was in the outside
room when she came, otherwise she might have come blundering in here and
Master would have heard her message. And we all know what Master is like where
money is concerned: he’d spend the fat in the frying-pan if he could get it out! Once
he found out that you had savings, he’d pluck up courage to spend them in no time.
Anyway, I took the money from her quickly and gave her a piece of my mind -- which
I am afraid you must have heard. That’s why I had to say what I did. I’d never have
men?tioned Caltrop in the Master’s presence otherwise!’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘I was going to say! Why, for no apparent reason, should Mrs. Xue choose a
chamber-wife to send here the moment Master gets back? So it was you up to your
tricks, you little monkey!’
At this point Jia Lian came in again and Xi-feng ordered her maids to serve the wine
and various choice dishes to go with it. Husband and wife sat cross-legged at
opposite sides of the low table on the kang and began their drinking—Xi-feng with
some restraint, although she was normally a fairly hard drinker, in view of the
occasion.
They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Zhao, walked
in. The young couple at once invited her to drink with them and tried to make her
join them on the kang. This last honour she would under no circumstances accept,
and Patience and the girls laid a little table for her at the side of the kang and set a
little stool beside it, on which she sat down very contentedly. Jia Lian made a
selection with his chopsticks from the dishes on the table, and after heaping up two
platefuls, set them down on Nannie Zhao’s own little table for her to eat there by
herself. Xi-feng was critical:
‘Nannie can’t chew stuff like that. She’ll break her teeth on it!’ She turned to
Patience. ‘That piece of boiled gammon in the bowl I said this morning was so tender:
that would be just the thing for Nannie. Why don’t you run round to the kitchen and
ask them to heat it up for her?— Nannie,’ she said, addressing the old woman, ‘you.
must try some of the rice wine your Lian brought back with him from the South!’
‘Ooh yes!’ said Nannie Zhao, ‘I must try some of that! And you must have some too,
Mrs. Lian. Never fear! As long as you don’t drink too much, ’ twill do you good. But I
didn’t come all the way here for vittles and drink, bless you. I came on more serious
business. And you heed my words, Mrs. Lian, and stick up for me; because that
Master Lian of yours he always says he’ll do something, but when you go to see him
later, he’s clean forgot all about it! To think I reared you up on the milk of my own
bosom, Master Lian! And a fine young man you’ve growed into, thanks be! Well, I’m
old and of no account now. But there are these two sons of mine, d’ye see? If only
you would be more like a foster-brother to theta and look after them a bit, no one
would dare say a word agen them. But dearie me! I’ve asked you again and again to
help them, and you always says yes; yet to this very day nothing has ever come of it.
Well, what I thought was this, Mrs Lian. With this great blessing of Heaven that’s
come on the family on account of your eldest young lady, surely, I thought to myself,
there must be jobs in this for someone? I’ll talk to Mrs Lian about it, I said to myself;
because if I rely on Master Lian to help us, we’ll starve to death for certain sure!’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Leave your two boys to me, Nannie. I’ll look after them! You know all about Lian’s
little ways because you nursed him when he was a baby: he’ll give the dearest thing
he has to some nobody he’s picked up outside, yet his own two foster-brothers who
are much nicer young men than any of his favourites he neglects completely. If only
you would take a bit of interest in them, Lian, you wouldn’t hear a word of complaint
from anyone, instead of wasting your kindnesses on those -- those little male misses
of yours! I shouldn’t have called them “misses”, though. You treat the misses as your
missus and give me the miss! ’
There was a loud laugh from everyone present, including Nannie Zhao, who
concluded her cackles with a pious invoca?tion:
‘Bless his Holy Name! Here at last comes a just judge to set all things to rights -- But
oh Mrs Lian, those naughty things you said about “misses”: that’s not my Master Lian.
It’s just that he’s so soft-hearted he can’t bring himself to say “ no” to anyone who
spins him a tale.’
‘Soft-hearted with his boy friends, maybe,’ said Xi-feng with a lubricious smile; ‘but
when he has to do with us women he is hard enough.’
‘Tee, hee, hee, what a one you are, Mrs Lian! I don’t know when I was last so merry.
Come on, let’s have another cup of that good wine! — Now that I’ve got Mrs Lian to
stand up for me I shall have no more worries!’
Jia Lian was by now thoroughly embarrassed and laughed sheepishly.
‘Stop all this nonsense now and serve the rice! I’ve still got to go round to Cousin
Zhen’s after this to discuss things.’
‘Ah yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We mustn’t make you late for that. What did Cousin Zhen
want you for just now?’
‘It was about the visitation business,’ said Jia Lian.
‘Has it been settled, then?’
‘Well, not absolutely. Eight or nine parts settled, you might say.’
‘That’s a great favour of the Emperor’s, isn’t it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Something you don’t
hear of even in plays and stories about the olden days.’
‘Very true!’ chimed in Nannie Zhao. ‘But I must be getting old and stupid, for
everywhere these last few days have been a-buzz with talk of “visitations”, but
blessed if I can make head or tall of it. You tell us now: just what manner of thing is
this “visitation”?’
Jia Lian undertook to do so.
‘Our present Emperor, who has always had a great sym?pathy for the common man,
believes that the filial affection of a child for its parents is the most important thing in
the world, and that family feeling is the same everywhere, irrespective of social rank.
He has found that in his own case, even after see?ing the Ex-Emperor and
Ex-Empress morning, noon and night every day of his life, he is still unable to express
more than a fraction of the devotion he feels for them; and this has led him to think
of all those concubines and maids of honour and other court ladies, taken from their
homes and shut up in the Palace for years and years on end, and to realize how much
they must miss their parents. And from there he got to thinking of the parents
themselves, how they must long for the daughters they can never see again. And
then he thought what a crime against Nature it would be if any of those parents were
to become ill as a result of not seeing their daughters. And so he addressed a
Memorial to the Ex-Emperor and Ex-Empress requesting permission to allow the
families of palace ladies to visit them in the Palace on the twelfth day of every month.
When Their Old Majesties saw this Memorial they were very pleased and praised the
Emperor for his piety and goodness—“doing Heaven’s work among men” they called
it. But they pointed out in their Rescript that when the families of court ladies
entered the Palace on these visits, they would inevitably be hampered by the
restrictions of court etiquette in the ex?pression of their natural feelings. So in the
end, by an act of supreme generosity, the Emperor issued a special decree in which
he said that, apart from allowing the families of court ladies to visit their daughters in
the Palace on the twelfth day of each month, he would allow any family which had a
separate house or annexe capable of being maintained in the degree of security
specified for a temporary Imperial Residence to make written application for
permission to receive a Visitation in their own home, where the pleasures of reunion
could be enjoyed in an atmosphere of intimacy and affection. The proclamation of
this decree has created quite a stir. The Imperial Concubine Lady Zhou’s father
already has the builders at work on a special wing for visitations in his house, and
Lady Wu’s father, Wu Tian-you, has been outside the city looking for a site. So it’s
already eight or nine parts settled, as I said.’
‘Bless my soul!’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘So that’s what it is! Well, I suppose in that case
we shall soon be getting ready to receive our young lady?’
‘Of course,’ said Jia Lian. ‘What else do you think we’re all so busy about?’
‘ If we do receive her,’ said Xi-feng, ‘it should be an ex?perience worth
remembering. I’ve often wished I’d been born twenty or thirty years earlier so that
the old folk wouldn’t be able to look down on me for having missed so much. To hear
them talk about the Emperor Tai-zu’s Southern Progress is better than listening to a
story-teller. How I wish I’d been there to see it all!’
‘Ah, now!’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘That’s the sort of thing that scarce comes once in a
thousand years! I was not so young then that I can’t still remember. The head of the
Jia family in those days was Superintendant of Shipyards and Harbour Maint’nance in
the Soochow-Yangchow area and was chosen to receive the Emperor on one of his
visits. The way they spent silver on that visit, why, it was like pouring out salt sea
water! I call to mind...’
Xi-feng in her eagerness cut her short:
‘We Wangs received the Emperor on one of his visits, too. At that time my
grandfather was in charge of all the foreign tribute and the embassies going up to
Court. Whenever any foreigners arrived, it was always my family that put them up.
All the goods brought by the foreign ships to the seaports in Kwangtung, Fukien,
Yunnan and Chekiang passed through our hands.’
‘Everybody knows that,’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘There’s even a rhyme about it:

The King of the Ocean
Goes along,
When he’s short of gold beds,
To the Nanking Wang.

That’s your family: the “Nanking Wangs”. But then there’s the Zhens, who still live
down that way in Kiangnan. My word! There’s riches for you! That family alone
received the Emperor four times! If I hadn’t seen with my own two eyes, I don’t care
who told me, I wouldn’t have credited it, the sights I saw then! Never mind silver.
Silver was just dirt to them. Every precious thing in the world you can think of they
had there in moun?tains! Words like “save” and “spare” they just didn’t seem to
know the meaning of!’
‘I believe you,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve heard my grandfather talk about it, and he said it
was just like that. But it still amazes me that a single family could have so much
wealth.’
‘I’ll tell you something, Mrs Lian,’ said the knowledgeable Nannie. “Twere no more
than paying for the Emperor’s entertainment with the Emperor’s own silver. No
family that ever lived had money enough of its own to pay for such spectacles of
vanity!’
While they were chatting, Lady Wang sent someone round to see if Xi-feng had
finished her dinner yet. Xi-feng realized that there must be something which
demanded her attention and, finishing hurriedly, rinsed out her mouth and prepared
to go. Before she could leave, however, the pages from the second gate announced
the arrival of Jia Rong and Jia Qiang from the Ning-guo mansion next door. Jia Lian
had just finished rinsing his mouth and was washing his hands in a basin held out for
him by Patience when the two young men came into the room.
‘What is your message?’ he asked them.
Xi-feng, curious, stayed to hear.
‘Father sent us to tell you that the uncles have already reached a decision,’ said Jia
Rong. ‘They have measured off an area just over a quarter of a mile square which
takes in a part of our grounds, including the All-scents Garden, on the east side, and
the north-west corner of your grounds on the west, to be turned into a Separate
Residence for the Visitation. They’ve already commissioned someone to draw a plan,
which should be ready tomorrow. Father says as you’ve just got home he’s sure you
must be tired, so don’t bother to come round tonight. If there’s anything to discuss,
you can tell him about it first thing tomorrow.’
‘Thank your father for me very much,’ said Jia Lian with a grateful smile. ‘It is very
good of him to let me off tonight, and I shall do as he says and not go over until
tomorrow. I think the great advantage of this proposal is that it is so economical and
makes the job of construction so much easier. It would mean very much more
trouble if we were to build on land out?side, yet at the same time we should lose the
convenience this present scheme gives us of a single layout. Tell him when you get
back that I think it is an excellent proposal, and that I leave it to him to protest in any
way he thinks fit if the others show signs of going back on it. The one thing we must
under no circumstances do is to go looking for land outside. Anyway, I shall be round
to see him first thing tomorrow and we can talk about it in detail then.’
Jia Rong promised to retail this message.
Jia Qiang now stepped forward with a message of his own:
‘Uncle Zhen has given me the job of going to Soochow to engage music and drama
teachers and to buy girl players and instruments and costumes so that we can have
our own theatricals for the visitation. I’m to take Lai Sheng’s two sons with me; and
two of Great-uncle Zheng’s gentlemen, Dan Ping-ren and Bu Gu-xiu, are coming as
well. Uncle said I ought to have a word with you about it before I go.’
Jia Lian looked the youth up and down appraisingly and laughed:
‘Do you think you are qualified for the job? It may not be a very big one, but I
should say the pickings would be pretty good for someone who knew the ropes.’
Jia Qiang laughed too.
‘I shall have to learn as I go along!’
Jia Rong, who was standing somewhat away. From the light, availed himself of the
shadow’s concealment to give Xi-feng’s dress a surreptitious tug. She understood
perfectly well what his meaning was, but pretended not to, dismissing him with a
curt wave of the hand and addressing herself instead to Jia Lian:
‘Don’t be so officious, Lian! Cousin Zhen is no less capable of choosing the right
person for the job than we are. What do you mean by asking the boy if he’s qualified?
He’s as much qualified as any of the rest of us. He’s old enough to have seen a pig run,
even if he’s not old enough to have eaten pork! In any case, I’m sure Cousin Zhen
only chose him as a figurehead. You don’t seriously suppose that he’ll be the one to
discuss prices and deal with the business side of the expedition? — I think myself it’s
a very good choice!’
‘Of course it is,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t dispute it. I merely thought we ought to do a
few of his sums for him before he goes. Where is the money for this coming from?’
he asked Jia Qiang.
‘We were discussing that just now,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Gaffer Lai says that there’s no
point in taking money with us from here. He says the Zhens of Kiangnan hold fifty
thousand taels of ours on deposit and he can give us a letter of credit to take to them
when we go. We’ll draw out thirty thousand first and leave the rest to buy lanterns,
lamps, and curtains with later on.’
Jia Lian nodded appreciatively.
‘Good idea.’
‘Well, if that’s all settled,’ Xi-feng put in quickly, ‘I’ve got two very reliable young
men for you to take with you, Qiang. I’m sure you’ll find them extremely useful.’
‘What a coincidence!’ said Jia Qiang. ‘I was just about to ask if you could
recommend a couple of helpers!’
He asked for their names, and Xi-feng turned to Nannie Zhao to supply them. But the
old nurse was so bemused by all this talk of policy and high finance that she
appeared to be in a sort of coma, which it took a sharp nudge from Patience to rouse
her from. When she answered it was in a gabble, to make up for the awkward pause.
‘One of them is called Zhao Tian-liang, the other is called Zhao Tian-dong.’
‘Mind you don’t forget!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I’m off to see to my own affairs.’ And
she left the room.
Jia Rong slipped out after her.
‘If you will make a list of all the things you want,’ he said, smilingly and softly, ‘I’ll
see that he gets them for you, gracious lady.’
‘Gracious arsehole!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you think you can buy my favour with a few
knick-knacks? I don’t like all this whispering in corners.’
She walked away without giving him a chance to reply.
Meanwhile Jia Qiang was making a somewhat similar proposal to Jia Lian.
‘If there’s anything I can get for you while I’m away, Uncle, I shall be glad to wangle
it.’
‘My, my!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Let’s not get carried away, then! I must say, for one who’s
only just started, you certainly haven’t lost much time in picking up the tricks of the
trade! Yes, I dare say I shall write and let you know if I find I’m short of anything.’
With these words he sent the two young men back to the other house. Their
departure was followed by a succession of three or four visits by servants reporting
on household matters, after which he felt so exhausted that he instructed the
servants on the inner gate to refuse admittance to any others and to inform them
that he would deal with their business next day. It was midnight by the time Xi-feng
got back to bed.
But the affairs of that night are no part of our story.
Rising early next morning, Jia Lian first called on his father and uncles and then went
to the Ning-guo mansion, where, with Cousin Zhen, he joined a group consisting of
the older stewards and domestics and a few friends and clients of the family in
making a complete survey of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties with a view to
deciding where the various buildings of the Separate Residence should be sited. He
also helped them interview the craftsmen who would undertake the work.
After the assembling of builders and artisans the assembling of materials began: a
continuous flow of supplies converging on the site from every direction, from
precious consignments of gold, silver, copper and tin, to huge, bulky loads of
builder’s clay, timber, bricks and tiles.
Various walls, including the surrounding walls of the All? scents Garden, and some of
the garden’s pavilions were demolished so that the north-west part of the Ning-guo
property and the large open court on the north-east side of Rong-guo House were
thrown into a single site. A range of servants’ quarters on the east side of the
Rong-guo grounds had already been demolished. The Ning-guo and Rong-guo
properties had previous to this been divided by an alley-way running from north to
south between them, but as it was not a public thoroughfare, no problem as involved
in closing it and incorporating part of it in the rest of the new site.
The All-scents Garden had been watered by a stream led in by a culvert which ran
under a corner of the north wall. Now that the garden was being integrated in the
larger site, it was no longer necessary to lead the water in at this point.
The artificial hills, rocks, trees and shrubs of All-scents Garden were, of course,
insufficient for the whole of the new site; but the area occupied by Jia She was the
original garden of Rong-guo House and plentifully supplied with bamboos, trees,
rocks, pavilions, kiosks and pergolas capable of being moved elsewhere. By pooling
the resources of these two garden—the All-scents Garden of Ning-guo House and the
original Rong-guo garden where Jia She lived— and redistri?buting them over a single
area, it would be possible to make great economies in both labour and materials, and
when the estimates came to be made it was found that the requirements, in terms of
completely new materials, would be comparatively modest.
The conception as a whole and the designs for its execution were alike the work of a
well-known landscape gardener familiar to all and sundry by the sobriquet of
‘Horticultural Hu’.
Jia Zheng was unused to matters of a practical nature and left the management of
men and the control of operations to a consortium consisting of Jia She, Cousin Zhen
and Jia Lian, the stewards Lai Da, Lai Sheng and Lin Zhi-xiao, the Clerk of Stores Wu
Xin-deng, and two of his literary gentlemen, Zhan Guang and Cheng Ri-xing. The
digging of pools, the raising of hills, the sitting and erection of lodges and pavilions,
the planting of bamboos and flowers—in a word, all matters pertaining to the
landscaping and layout of the gardens, were planned and supervised by Horticultural
Hu. Jia Zheng would merely drop in occasionally when he got back from Court and
look around. On any important matters he sought the advice of Jia She and the rest.
Jia She led a life of cultured ease and never did anything. On routine matters of no
great importance Cousin Zhen would either report to him in person or send him a
brief note when the thing was done. If consultation was unavoidable, he would send
along Lai Da or one of the others for a reply.
Jia Rong’s sole task was to supervise the making of objects in gold and silver.
Jia Qiang had already left for Soochow.
Cousin Zhen, Lai Da and the rest were the ones who did most of the real work. It was
they who hired workmen, kept accounts, and supervised and inspected each job as it
was undertaken.
The amount of noise and activity generated by these opera?tions could not be
described in a few words, and for the time being we shall not attempt the task.
The family’s recent preoccupation with these important developments had released
Bao-yu from his father’s periodical quizzing about the progress of his studies.
Unfortunately the relief of mind which this would otherwise have afforded him was
displaced by a grave concern for Qin Zhong, whose sickness seemed to be daily
worsening. Under such circumstances it was impossible for him to feel happy about
anything else.
One morning, just as he had finished washing and dressing and was thinking of going
round to Grandmother Jia to ask if he might pay Qin Zhong another visit, he caught
sight of Tealeaf dodging about behind the screen wall of the inner gate and evidently
trying to catch his attention. Bao-yu hurried over to him.
‘What is it?’
‘Master Qin. He’s dying!’
Bao-yu was stunned.
‘Dying? When I saw him yesterday he seemed quite lucid. How can he be dying so
soon?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Tealeaf. ‘But that’s what the old gaffer said just now who came
round to tell me.’
Bao-yu hurried back and told Grandmother Jia. She in?structed some of the more
reliable servants to go with him and briefly admonished him before he went:
‘When you get there you may stay with him to the end, since you have been such
good friends; but you must come back as soon as it is over. Don’t hang about!’
Bao-yu hurried off to change, only to find, on re-emerging, that the carriage was still
not ready. Anxious lest he should arrive too late, he ran up and down the courtyard in
a frenzy of impatience, imploring the servants to make haste; and when it at last
arrived, he flung himself in it and drove off at great speed, hotly pursued by Li Gui,
Tealeaf and the others attend?ing him.
The house, when they reached it, appeared silent and deserted. Entering together in
a tight little knot, master and servants surged through like swarming bees to the
inner apartment at the back where Qin Zhong lay, causing great consternation among
the two aunts and half-dozen girl cousins who were tending him and who were
unable to con?ceal themselves before the advent of this masculine invasion.
At this stage Qin Zhong had already lost consciousness several times and, in
accordance with the Northern custom which forbids a sick man to breathe his last on
the kang, had some time since been lifted on to a trestle bed to die. Bao-yu gave an
involuntary cry when he saw where he was lying and broke into noisy weeping. He
was quickly restrained by Li Gui:
‘You know how delicate Master Qin is. I expect the kang was too hard for him and
they have put him here so that he can lie a bit more easy. You mustn’t cry like that or
you will make him worse!’
Bao-yu held back his sobs and drew close to his dying friend. Qin Zhong’s face was
waxen. His eyes were closed tight and he seemed to breathe with difficulty, twisting
his head from side to side on the pillow.
‘Jing-qing, old fellow! It’s me! It’s Bao-yu!’—He called him several times, but Qin
Zhong seemed unaware of his presence. Again he called:
‘It’s Bao-yu!’
In point of fact Qin Zhong’s soul had already left his body and the few faint gasps of
breath in his failing lungs were the only life that now remained in it. The ministers of
the under?world, armed with a warrant and chains to bind him with, were at that
very moment confronting him; but his soul was refusing to go quietly. Remembering
that he left no one behind him to look after his family’s affairs, and bethinking him of
poor Sapientia whose whereabouts were still unknown, he entreated them most
piteously to spare him. But the infernal visitants had no ear for his entreaties and
silenced him with angry rebuke:
‘You’re an educated young fellow: haven’t you heard the saying
If Yama calls at midnight hour
      No man can put off death till four—?

We ministers of the nether world, from the highest down to the lowest, all have
unbending iron natures and—unlike the officials of the mortal world, who are always
doing kindnesses and showing favours and inventing little tricks and dodges for
frustrating the course of justice -- we are incapable of showing partiality.’
Suddenly, above their angry shouting, Qin Zhong heard a tiny cry:
‘It’s Bao-yu!’
At once he renewed his entreaties:
‘Good gentlemen, be merciful! Give me just a moment for a few words with a very
dear friend of mine, and I’ll be back directly!’
‘What is it now?’ asked the demons. ‘What friend?’
‘I won’t deceive you, gentlemen. It’s a descendant of the Duke of Rong-guo. His
name is Bao-yu.’
‘What?’ screamed the officer in charge of the party in great alarm. He turned
angrily on his demon minions;
‘I told you we ought to let him go back for a bit, but you wouldn’t listen. Now look
what’s happened! He’s gone and called up a person full of life and health to come
here right in our midst! This is terrible!’
The demons showed signs of disarray on observing their leader to be so affected, and
there was some angry mutter?ing:
‘Yer Honour was putting on a brave enough show a short while ago. Why should
the name “Bao-yu” throw you into such a state of commotion? If you ask us, seeing
that he’s upper world and we’re lower world, there’s nothing to be afraid of. We
might just as well carry this one off now and have done with it.’
The trepidation of their leader, who was perhaps thinking more of Bao-yu’s
demon-repelling talisman than of its wearer, was far from comforted by this
reflection.
‘No! No! No!’ he shouted, and compelled them to let the soul return to its body.
With the return of his soul Qin Zhong regained conscious?ness and opened his eyes.
He could see Bao-yu standing beside him; but his throat was so choked with phlegm
that he was unable to utter a word. He could only fasten his eyes on him and slowly
shake his head. Then there was a rasping sound in his throat and he slid once more
into the dark.
What followed will be told in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 17



The inspection of the new garden becomes
a test of talent
And Rong-guo House makes itself ready for
an important visitor



Now that Qin Zhong was indisputably dead, Bao-yu wept long and bitterly, and it was
some time before Li Gui and the rest could calm him. Even after their return he
continued tearful and distressed. Grandmother Jia contributed thirty or forty taels
towards Qin Zhong’s funeral expenses and made addi?tional provision for offerings
to the dead. Bao-yu condoled and sacrificed, and on the seventh day followed his
friend’s coffin to the grave. He continued in daily grief for Qin Zhong for a very long
time afterwards. But grief cannot mend our losses, and a day did at last arrive when
he hid ceased to mourn.

*

One day Cousin Zhen came to Jia Zheng with his team of helpers to report that work
on the new garden had been completed.
‘Uncle She has already had a look,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Now we are only waiting for
you to look round it to tell us if there is anything you think will need altering and also
to decide what inscriptions ought to be used on the boards everywhere.’
Jia Zheng reflected a while in silence.
‘These inscriptions are going to be difficult,’ he said eventually. ‘By rights, of course,
Her Grace should have the privilege of doing them herself; but she can scarcely be
expected to make them up out of her head without having seen any of the views
which they are to describe. On the other hand, if we wait until she has already visited
the garden before asking her, half the pleasure of the visit will be lost. All those
prospects and pavilions—even the rocks and trees and flowers will seem somehow
incomplete without that touch of poetry which only the written word can lend a
scene.’
‘My dear patron, you are so right,’ said one of the literary gentlemen who sat with
him. ‘But we have had an idea. The inscriptions for the various parts of the garden
obviously cannot be dispensed with; nor, equally obviously, can they be decided in
advance. Our suggestion is that we should compose provisional names and couplets
to suit the places where inscriptions are required, and have them painted on
rectangu?lar paper lanterns which can be hung up temporarily –either horizontally or
vertically as the case may be—when Her Grace comes to visit. We can ask her to
decide on the permanent names after she has inspected the garden. Is not this a
solution of the dilemma?’
‘It is indeed,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘when we look round the garden presently, we must all
try to think of words that can be used. If they seem suitable, we can keep them for
the lanterns. If not, we can call for Yu-cun to come and help us out.’
‘Your own suggestions are sure to be admirable, Sir Zheng,’ said the literary
gentlemen ingratiatingly. ‘There will be no need to call in Yu-cun.’
Jia Zheng smiled deprecatingly.
‘I am afraid it is not as you imagine. In my youth I had at best only indifferent skill in
the art of writing verses about natural objects -- birds and flowers and scenery and
the like; and now that I’m older and have to devote all my energies to official
documents and government papers, I am even more out of touch with this sort of
thing than I was then; so that even if I were to try my hand at it, I fear that my efforts
would be rather dull and pedantic ones. Instead of enhancing the interest and beauty
of the garden, they would probably have a deadening effect upon both.’
‘That doesn’t matter,’ the literary gentlemen replied. ‘We can all try our hands at
composing. If each of us contributes what he is best at, and if we then select the
better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good, we should be able to
manage all right.’
‘That seems to me a very good suggestion,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘As the weather today is
so warm and pleasant, let us all go and take a turn round the garden now!’
So saying he rose to his feet and conducted his little retinue of literary luminaries
towards the garden. Cousin Zhen hurried on ahead to warn those in charge that they
were coming.
As Bao-yu was still in very low spirits these days because of his grief for Qin Zhong,
Grandmother Jia had hit on the idea of sending him into the newly made garden to
play. By un?lucky chance she had selected this very day on which to try out her
antidote. He had in fact only just entered the garden when Cousin Zhen came
hurrying towards him.
‘Better get out of here!’ said Cousin Zhen with an amused smile. ‘Your father will
be here directly!’
Bao-ya streaked back towards the gate, a string of nurses and pages hurrying at his
heels. But he had only just turned the corner on coming out of it when he almost ran
into the arms of Jia Zheng and his party coming from the opposite direction. Escape
was impossible. He simply had to stand meekly to one side and await instructions.
Jia Zheng had recently received a favourable report on Bao-yu from his teacher Jia
Dai-ru in which mention had been made of his skill in composing couplets. Although
the boy showed no aptitude for serious study, Dai-ru had said, he nevertheless
possessed a certain meretricious talent for versi?fication not undeserving of
commendation. Because of this report, Jia Zheng ordered Bao-yu to accompany him
into the garden, intending to put his aptitude to the test. Bao-yu, who knew nothing
either of Dai-ru’s report or of his father’s in?tentions, followed with trepidation.
As soon as they reached the gate they found Cousin Zhen at the head of a group of
overseers waiting to learn Jia Zheng’s wishes.
‘I want you to close the gate,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘so that we can see what it looks like
from outside before we go in.’
Cousin Zhen ordered the gate to be closed, and Jia Zheng stood back and studied it
gravely.
It was a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles. The
wooden lattice-work of the doors and windows was finely carved and ingeniously
patterned. The whole gatehouse was quite unadorned by colour or gild?ing, yet all
was of the most exquisite workmanship. Its walls stood on a terrace of white marble
carved with a pattern of passion-flowers in relief, and the garden’s whitewashed
circumference wall to left and right of it had a footing made of black-and-white
striped stone blocks arranged so that the stripes formed a simple pattern. Jia Zheng
found the unosten?tatious simplicity of this entrance greatly to his liking, and after
ordering the gates to be opened, passed on inside.
A cry of admiration escaped them as they entered, for there, immediately in front of
them, screening everything else from their view, rose a steep, verdure-clad hill.
‘Without this hill,’ Jia Zheng somewhat otiosely observed, ‘the whole garden would
be visible as one entered, and all its mystery would be lost.’
The literary gentlemen concurred. ‘Only a master of the art of landscape could have
conceived so bold a stroke,’ said one of them.
As they gazed at this miniature mountain, they observed a great number of large
white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes, rising course above
course up one of its sides, some recumbent, some upright or leaning at angles, their
surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half concealed by creepers,
and with a narrow, zigzag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between
them.
‘Let us begin our tour by following this path,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If we work our way
round towards the other side of the hill on our way back, we shall have made a
complete circuit of the garden.’
He ordered Cousin Zhen to lead the way, and leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, began the
winding ascent of the little mountain. Suddenly on the mountainside above his head,
he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smoothness and
realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an
inscription.
‘Aha, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng turning back to address the others who were
climbing up behind him. ‘What name are we going to choose for this mountain?’
‘Emerald Heights,’ said one.
‘Embroidery Hill,’ said another.
Another proposed that they should call it ‘Little Censer’ after the famous Censer
Peak in Kiangsi. Another proposed ‘Little Zhong-nan’. Altogether some twenty or
thirty names were suggested -- none of them very seriously, since the literary
gentlemen were aware that Jia Zheng intended to test Bao-yu and were anxious not
to make the boy’s task too difficult. Bao-yu understood and was duly grateful.
When no more names were forthcoming Jia Zheng turned to Bao-yu and asked him
to propose something himself.
‘I remember reading in some old book,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that “to recall old things is
better than to invent new ones; and to re-cut an ancient text is better than to
engrave a modern”. We ought, then, to choose something old. But as this is not the
garden’s principal “mountain” or its chief vista, strictly speak?ing there is no
justification for having an inscription here at all—unless it is to be something which
implies that this is merely a first step towards more important things ahead. I suggest
we should call it “Pathway to Mysteries” after the line in Chang Jian’s poem about
the mountain temple:

A path winds upwards to mysterious places.

A name like that would be more distinguished.’
There was a chorus of praise from the literary gentlemen:
‘Exactly right! Wonderful! Our young friend with his natural talent and youthful
imagination succeeds immediately where we old pedants fail!’
Jia Zheng gave a deprecatory laugh:
‘You mustn’t flatter the boy! People of his age are adept at making a little
knowledge go a long way. I only asked him as a joke, to see what he would say. We
shall have to think of a better name later on.’
As he spoke, they passed through a tunnel of rock in the mountain’s shoulder into an
artificial ravine ablaze with the vari-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of
tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion. Down below, where the trees
were thickest, a clear stream gushed between the rocks. After they had advanced a
few paces in a somewhat northerly direction, the ravine broadened into a little
flat-bottomed valley and the stream widened out to form a pool. Gaily painted and
carved pavilions rose from the slopes on either side, their lower halves concealed
amidst the trees, their tops reaching into the blue. In the midst of the prospect below
them was a handsome bridge:
In a green ravine
A jade stream sped.
A stair of stone
Plunged to the brink.
where the water widened
To a placid pool,
A marble baluster
Ran round about.
A marble bridge crossed it
With triple span,
And a marble lion’s maw
Crowned each of the arches.
Over the centre of the bridge there was a little pavilion, which Jia Zheng and the
others entered and sat down in.
‘Well, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What are we going to call it?’
‘Ou-yang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of “a pavilion poised above
the water”,’ said one of them. ‘what about “Poised Pavilion”?’
‘“Poised Pavilion” is good,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but this pavilion was put here in order to
dominate the water it stands over, and I think there ought to be some reference to
water in its name. I seem to recollect that in that same essay you men?tion Ou-yang
Xiu speaks of the water “gushing between twin peaks”. Could we not use the word
“gushing” in some way?’
‘Yes, yes!’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘“Gushing Jade” would do splendidly.’
Jia Zheng fondled his beard meditatively, then turned to Bao-yu and asked him for his
suggestion.
‘I agreed with what you said just now, Father,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but on second thoughts
it seems to me that though it may have been all right for Ou-yang Xiu to use the word
“gush?ing” in describing the source of the river Rang, it doesn’t really suit the water
round this pavilion. Then again, as this is a Separate Residence specially designed for
the reception of a royal personage, it seems to me that something rather formal is
called for, and that an expression taken from the Drunkard’s Pavilion might seem a bit
improper. I think we should try to find a rather more imaginative, less obvious sort of
name.’
‘I hope you gentlemen are all taking this in!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically, ‘You will
observe that when we suggest something original we are recommended to prefer the
old to the new, but that when we do make use of an old text we are “improper” and
“unimaginative”! -- Well, carry on then! Let’s have your suggestion!’
‘I think “Drenched Blossoms” would be more original and more tasteful than
“Gushing Jade”.’
Jia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently. The literary gentlemen could see
that he was pleased and hastened to commend Bao-yu’s remarkable ability.
‘That’s the two words for the framed board on top,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Not a very
difficult task. But what about the seven-word lines for the sides?’
Bao-yu glanced quickly round, seeking inspiration from the scene, and presently
came up with the following couplet:


‘Three pole-thrust lengths of bankside willows green,
One fragrant breath of bankside flowers sweet.’

Jia Zheng nodded and a barely perceptible smile played over his features. The literary
gentlemen redoubled their praises.
They now left the pavilion and crossed to the other side of the pool. For a while they
walked on, stopping from time to time to admire the various rocks and flowers and
trees which they passed on their way, until suddenly they found them?selves at the
foot of a range of whitewashed walls enclosing a small retreat almost hidden among
the hundreds and hundreds of green bamboos which grew in a dense thicket behind
them. With cries of admiration they went inside. A cloister-like covered walk ran
round the walls from the entrance to the back of the forecourt and a cobbled
pathway up to the steps of the terrace. The house was a tiny three-frame one, two
parts latticed, the third part windowless. The tables, chairs and couches which
furnished it seemed to have been specially made to fit the interior. A door in the rear
wall opened onto a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flowering
pear-tree and overlooked on either side by two diminutive lodges built at right angles
to the back of the house. A stream gushed through an opening at the foot of the
garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran to the foot of the rear terrace
and thence round the side of the house to the front, where it meandered through
the bamboos of the forecourt before finally disappearing through another opening in
the surrounding wall.
‘This must be a pleasant enough place at any time,’ said Jia Zheng with a smile. ‘But
just imagine what it would be like to sit studying beside the window here on a
moonlight night! It is pleasures like that which make a man feel he has not lived in
vain!’
As he spoke, his glance happened to fall on Bao-yu, who instantly became so
embarrassed that he hung his head in shame. He was rescued by the timely
intervention of the literary gentlemen who changed the subject from that of study to
a less dangerous topic. Two of them suggested that the name given to this retreat
should be a four-word one. Jia Zheng asked them what four words they proposed.
‘“Where Bends the Qi”’ said one of them, no doubt hav?ing in mind the song in the
Poetry Classic which begins with the words

See in that nook where bends the Qi,
The green bamboos, how graceful grown!
‘No,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too obvious!’
‘“North of the Sui”,’ said the other, evidently thinking of the ancient Rabbit Garden
of the Prince of Liang in Suiyang—also famous for its bamboos and running water.
‘No,’ said jia Zheng. ‘Still too obvious!’
‘You’d better ask Cousin Bao again,’ said Cousin Zhen, who stood by listening.
‘He always insists on criticizing everyone else’s suggestions before he will deign to
make one of his own,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘He is a worthless creature.’
‘That’s all right,’ said the others. ‘His criticisms are very good ones. He is in no way
to blame for making them.’
‘You shouldn’t let him get away with it!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘All right!’ he went on,
turning to Bao-yu. ‘Today we will indulge you up to the hilt. Let’s have your criticisms,
and after that we’ll hear your own proposal. What about the two suggestions that
have just been made? Do you think either of them could be used?’
‘Neither of them seems quite right to me,’ said Bao-yu in answer to the question.
‘In what way “not quite right”?’ said Jia Zheng with a scornful smile.
‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘This is the first building our visitor will enter when she looks
over the garden, so there ought to be some word of praise for the Emperor at this
point. If we want a classical reference with imperial symbolism, I suggest “The
Phoenix Dance”, alluding to that passage in the History Classic about the male and
female phoenixes alighting “with measured gambollings” in the Emperor’s courtyard.’
‘What about “Bend of the Qi” and “North of the Sui”?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Aren’t they
classical allusions? If not, I should like to know what they are!’
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they are too contrived. “The Phoenix Dance” is more fitting.’
There was a loud murmur of assent from the literary gentlemen. Jia Zhong nodded
and tried not to look pleased.
‘Young idiot!— A “small capacity but a great self-con?ceit”, gentlemen— All right!’
he ordered: ‘now the couplet!’
So Bao-yu recited the following couplet:

    ‘From the empty cauldron the steam still rises after the brewing of tea.
By the darkening window the fingers are still cold after the game of Go.’

Jia Zheng shook his head:
‘Nothing very remarkable about that!’
With this remark he began to move on, but thought of something just as they were
leaving, and stopped to ask Cousin Zhen:
‘I see that the buildings in this garden have their proper complement of chairs and
tables and so forth. What about blinds and curtains and flower-vases and all that sort
of thing? Have they been selected to suit the individual rooms?’
‘As regards ornaments,’ Cousin Zhen replied, ‘we have already got in quite a large
stock, and when the time comes we shall naturally select from it what is suitable for
each individual room. As regards drapes and hangings, Cousin Lian told me yesterday
that there are quite a lot yet to come. what we did was to take the measurements
from the plans drawn up for the carpenters and put the work in hand straight away,
even before the buildings were finished. As far as I know, up to yesterday we had
received about half of what was ordered.’
From the way Cousin Zhen spoke, Jia Zheng gathered that this was not his
responsibility and sent someone to summon Jia Lian. He arrived within moments,
and Jia Zheng ques?tioned him about the types and quantities ordered and the
figures for what had already been received and what was still to come.
In response to his inquiry Jia Lian extracted a wallet from the leg of his boot, and
glancing at a folded schedule inside it summarized its contents as follows:
‘Curtains, large and small, in various silks and satins—flowered, dragon-spot,
sprigged, tapestry, panelled, ink-splash: one hundred and twenty. —Eighty of those
were delivered yesterday. That leaves forty to come. —Blinds: two hundred. —Yes.
They all arrived yesterday. But then there are the special ones. —Blinds, scarlet felt:
two hundred. Speckled bamboo: one hundred. Red lacquered bamboo with gold
fleck: one hundred. Black lacquered bamboo: one hundred. Coloured net: two
hundred. —We now have half of each of those four kinds. The other half is promised
by the end of autumn. —Chair-covers, table-drapes, valances, tablecloths: one
thousand two hundred of each. —Those we already have.’
They had been moving on as he spoke, but were presently brought to a halt by a
steeply sloping hill which rose up in front of them. Having negotiated its foot, they
could see, almost concealed in a fold half-way up the other side of it, a dim-coloured
adobe wall crowned with a coping of rice-straw thatch. Inside it were several
hundred apricot trees, whose flowering tops resembled the billowing rosy clouds of
some vegetable volcano. In their midst stood a little group of reed?-thatched
cottages. Beyond the wall, with a barred gate divid?ing it in the middle, a loose
hedge of irregular shape had been made by weaving together the pliant young
shoots of the mulberry, elm, hibiscus, and silkworm thorn trees which grew outside it.
Between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well,
furnished with both well-sweep and windlass. Below the well, row upon row of
miniature fields full of healthy-looking vegetables and flowers ran down in variegated
strips to the bottom.
‘Ah, now here is a place with a purpose!’ said Jia Zheng with a pleased smile. It may
have been made by human arti?fice, but the sight of it is none the less moving. In me
it awakens the desire to get back to the land, to a life of rural simplicity. Let us go in
and rest a while!’
They were just on the point of entering the gate in the hedge when they observed a
stone at the side of the pathway leading up to it which had evidently been put there
in order that the name of the place might be inscribed upon it.
‘What a brilliant idea!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘If they had put a board
up over the gate, the rustic atmosphere would have been completely destroyed,
whereas this stone actually enhances it. This is a place which calls for the bucolic
talent of a Fan Cheng-da to do it justice!’
‘What shall we call it, then?’ asked Jia Zheng.
‘Just now our young friend was saying that to “recall an bid thing is better than to
invent a new one”,’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘In this case the ancients have
already provided the perfect name: “Apricot Village”.’
Jia Zheng knew that he was referring to the words of the fainting traveller in Du Mu’s
poem:


‘Where’s the tavern?’ I cry, and a lad points the way
To a village far off in the apricot trees.

He turned to Cousin Zhen with a smile:
‘Yes. That reminds me. There’s just one thing missing here: an inn-sign. Tomorrow
you must have one made. Nothing fancy. Just an ordinary inn-sign like the ones you
see in country villages outside. And it should hang from a bamboo pole above the
tree-tops.’
Cousin Zhen promised to see this done and added a sugges?tion of his own:
‘The birds here, too, ought to be ordinary farmyard ones—hens, ducks, geese, and
so on—to be in keeping with the surroundings.’
Jia Zheng and the rest agreed enthusiastically.
‘The only trouble with “Apricot Village”,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘—though it would suit the
place very well—is that it is the name of a real village; so we should have to get
official permission first before we could use it.’
‘Ah, yes,’ said the others. ‘That means we still have to think of something for a
temporary name. Now what shall it be?’
While they were all still thinking, Bao-yu who had already had an idea, was so
bursting with eagerness that he broke in, without waiting to be invited by his father:
‘There is an old poem which has the lines
Above the flowering apricot
A hopeful inn-sign hangs.

For the inscription on the stone we ought to have “The Hopeful Sign”.’
‘“The Hopeful Sign”,’ echoed the literary gentlemen admiringly. ‘Very good! The
hidden allusion to “Apricot Village” is most ingenious!’
‘Oh, as for the name of the village,’ said Bao-yu scornfully, ‘“Apricot Village” is
much too obvious! why not “Sweet-rice Village” from the words of the old poem:

A cottage by the water stands
Where Sweet the young rice smells?’

The literary gentlemen clapped their hands delightedly; but their cries of admiration
were cut short by an angry shout from Jia Zheng:
‘Ignorant young puppy! Just how many “old poets” and “old poems” do you think
you know, that you should pre?sume to show off in front of your elders in this
impertinent manner? We let you have your little say just now in order to test your
intelligence. It was no more than a joke. Do you suppose we are seriously interested
in your opinions?’
They had been moving on meanwhile, and he now led them into the largest of the
little thatched buildings, from whose simple interior with its paper windows and
plain deal furniture all hint of urban refinement had been banished. Jia Zheng was
inwardly pleased. He stared hard at Bao-yu:
‘How do you like this place, then?’
With secret winks and nods the literary gentlemen urged Bao-yu to make a
favourable reply, but he willfully ignored their promptings.
‘Not nearly as much as “The Phoenix Dance”.’
His father snorted disgustedly.
‘Ignoramus! You have eyes only for painted halls and gaudy pavilions—the rubbishy
trappings of wealth. What can you know of the beauty that lies in quietness and
natural simplicity? This is a consequence of your refusal to study properly.’
‘Your rebuke is, of course, justified, Father,’ Bao-yu replied promptly, ‘but then I
have never really understood what it was the ancients meant by “natural”.’
The literary gentlemen, who had observed a vein of mulish?ness in Bao-yu which
boded trouble, were surprised by the seeming na?veté of this reply.
‘Why, fancy not knowing what “natural” means -- you who have such a good
understanding of so much else! “Natural” is that which is of nature, that is to say,
that which is produced by nature as opposed to that which is produced by human
artifice.’
‘There you are, you see!’ said Bao-yu. ‘A farm set down in the middle of a place like
this is obviously the product of human artifice. There are no neighbouring villages, no
distant prospects of city walls; the mountain at the back doesn’t belong to any
system; there is no pagoda rising from some tree-hid monastery in the hills above;
there is no bridge below leading to a near-by market town. It sticks up out of
nowhere, in total isolation from everything else. It isn’t even a par?ticularly
remarkable view—not nearly so “natural” in either form or spirit as those other
places we have seen. The bam?boos in those other places may have been planted by
human hand and the streams diverted out of their natural courses, but there was no
appearance of artifice. That’s why, when the ancients use the term “natural” I have
my doubts about what they really meant. For example, when they speak of a “natural
painting”, I can’t help wondering if they are not referring to precisely that forcible
interference with the landscape to which I object: putting hills where they are not
meant to be, and that sort of thing. However great the skill with which this is done,
the results are never quite …”
His discourse was cut short by an outburst of rage from Jia Zheng.
‘Take that boy out of here!’
Bao-yu fled.
‘Come back!’
He returned.
‘You still have to make a couplet on this place. If it isn’t satisfactory, you will find
yourself reciting it to the tune of a slapped face!’
Bao-yu stood quivering with fright and for some moments was unable to say
anything. At last he recited the following couplet:


‘Emergent buds swell where the washerwoman soaks her cloth.
A fresh tang rises where the cress-gatherer fills his pannier.’

Jia Zheng shook his head:
‘Worse and worse.’
He led them out of the ‘village’ and round the foot of the hill:
through flowers and foliage,
by rock and rivulet,
past rose-crowned pergolas
and rose-twined trellises,
through small pavilions
embowered in peonies,
where scent of sweet-briers stole,
or pliant plantains waved –
until they came to a place where a musical murmur of water issued from a cave in
the rock. The cave was half-veiled by a green curtain of creeper, and the water below
was starred with bobbing blossoms.
‘What a delightful spot!’ the literary gentlemen exclaimed. ‘Very well, gentlemen.
What are you going to call it?’ said Jia Zheng.
Inevitably the literary gentlemen thought of Tao Yuan-?ming’s fisherman of Wu-ling
and his Peach-blossom Stream.
‘“The Wu-ling Stream”,’ said one of them. ‘The name is ready-made for this place.
No need to look further than that.’
Jia Zheng laughed:
‘The same trouble again, I am afraid. It is the name of a real place. In any case, it is
too hackneyed.’
‘All right,’ said the others good-humouredly. ‘In that case simply call it “Refuge of
the Qins”.’ Their minds still ran on the Peach-blossom Stream and its hidden paradise.
‘That’s even more inappropriate!’ said Bao-yu. ‘“Refuge of the Qins” would imply
that the people here were fugitives from tyranny. How can we possibly call it that? I
suggest “Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour”.’
‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. He looked inside the grotto and asked Cousin Zhen if
there were any boats.
‘Four punts for lotus-gathering and one for pleasure are on order,’ said Cousin Zhen,
‘but they haven’t finished making them yet.’
‘What a pity we cannot go through!’ said Jia Zheng.
‘There is a very steep path over the top which would take us there,’ said Cousin
Zhen, and proceeded to lead the way.
The others scrambled up after him, clinging to creepers and leaning on tree-trunks as
they went. When, having descended more, they had regained the stream it was wide
and deep once and distorted by many anfractuosities. The fallen blossoms seemed to
be even more numerous and the waters on whose surface they floated even more
limpid than they had been on the side they had just come from. The weeping willows
which lined both banks were here and there diversified with peach and apricot trees
whose interlacing branches made little worlds of stillness and serenity beneath them.
Suddenly, through the green of the willows, they glimpsed the scarlet balustrade of a
wooden bridge whose sloping ramps led to a flat central span high above the water.
When they had crossed it, they found a choice of paths leading to different parts of
the garden. Ahead was an airy building with roofs of tile, whose elegant surrounding
wall was of grey-plastered brick pierced by ornamental grilles made of semi-circular
tiles laid together in openwork patterns. The wall was so constructed that outcrops
of rock from the garden’s ‘master mountain’ appeared to run through it in several
places into the courtyard inside.
‘This building seems rather out of place here,’ said Jia Zheng.
But as he entered the gate the source of his annoyance dis?appeared; for a miniature
mountain of rock, whose many holes and fissures, worn through it by weathering or
the wash of waters, bestowed on it a misleading appearance of fragile delicacy,
towered up in front of him and combined with the many smaller rocks of various
shapes and sizes which sur?rounded it to efface from their view every vestige of the
build?ing they had just been looking at.
Not a single tree grew in this enclosure, only plants and herbs:
some aspired as vines,
some crept humbly on the ground;
some grew down from the tops of rocks,
some upwards from their feet;
some hung from the eaves in waving trails of green,
some clung to pillars in circling bands of gold;
some had blood-red berries,
some had golden flowers.
And from every flower and every plant and every herb wafted the most exquisite and
incomparable fragrances.
Jia Zheng could not help but admire:
‘Charming! But what are they all?’
‘Wild-fig’ and ‘wistaria’ was all the literary gentlemen would venture.
‘But surely,’ Jia Zheng objected, ‘wild-fig and wisteria do not have this delectable
fragrance?’
‘They certainly don’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There are wild-fig and wisteria among the
plants growing here, but the ones with the fragrance are pollia and birthwort and --
yes, I think those are orchids of some kind. That one over there is probably actinidia.
The red flowers are, of course, rue, the “herb of grace”, and the green ones must be
green-flag. A lot of these rare plants are mentioned in Li sao and Wen xuan,
particularly in the Poetical Descriptions of the Three Capitals by Zuo Si. For example,
in his Description of the Wu Capital he has

agastache, eulalia,
and harsh-smelling ginger-bush,
cord-flower, cable-flower,
centaury and purplestrife,
stone-sail and water-pine
and sweet-scented eglantine...

And then there are

amaranth, xanthoxylon,
anemone, phellopteron...

They come in the Description of the Shu Capital. Of course, after all these centuries
nobody really knows what all those names stand for. They apply them quite
arbitrarily to whatever seem to fit the description, and gradually all of them—’
Once more an angry shout from his father cut him short:
‘Who asked for your opinion?’
Bao-yu shrank back and said no more.
Observing that there were balustraded loggias on either side of the court, Jia Zheng
led his party through one of them towards the building at the rear. It was a cool,
five-frame gallery with a low, roofed verandah running round it on all sides. The
window-lattices were green and tile walls freshly painted. It was a building of quite
another order of elegance from the ones they had so far visited.
‘Anyone who sat sipping tea and playing the qin to himself on this verandah would
have no need to burn incense if he wanted sweet smells for his inspiration,’ said Jia
Zheng dreamily. ‘So unexpectedly beautiful a place calls for a specially beautiful
name to adorn it.’
‘What could be better than “Dewy Orchids”?’ said the literary gentleman.
‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘That would do for the name. Now what about the couplet?’
‘I have thought of a couplet,’ said one of the gentlemen. ‘Tell me all of you what
you think of it:

A musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard.
A sweet aroma of galingale floats over the moonlit island.’


‘Not bad,’ said the others. ‘But why “sunset courtyard”?’
‘I was thinking of that line in the old poem,’ said the man:

‘The garden’s gillyflowers at sunset weep.

After all, you have already got “dewy” in the name. I thought the “sunset weeping”
would go with it rather well.’
‘Feeble! Feeble!’ cried the rest.
‘I’ve thought of a couplet, too,’ said one of the others. ‘Let me have your opinion of
it:

Down garden walks a fragrant breeze caresses beds of melilot.
By courtyard walls a brilliant moon illumines golden orchises.’

Jia Zheng stroked his beard, and his lips were observed to move as though he was on
the point of proposing a couplet of his own. Suddenly, looking up, he caught sight of
Bao-yu skulking behind the others, too scared to speak.
‘What’s the matter with you?’ he bellowed at the unfortu?nate boy. ‘You are ready
enough with your opinions when they are not wanted. Speak up! —Or are you
waiting for a written invitation?’
‘I can see no “musk” or “moonlight” or “islands” in this place,’ said Bao-yu, ‘If we
are to make couplets in this follow-my-leader fashion, we could turn out a couple of
hundred of them and still have more to come.’
‘No one’s twisting your arm,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You don’t have to use those words if
you don’t want to.’
‘In that case,’ said Bao-yu, ‘I suggest “The Garden of Spices” for the name; and for
the couplet:

Composing amidst cardamoms, you shall make verses like flowers.
Slumbering amidst the roses, you shall dream fragrant dreams.’


‘We all know where you got that from,’ said Jia zheng:

‘Composing midst the plantains
Green shall my verses be.

We can’t give you much credit for an imitation.’
‘Not at all!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘There is nothing wrong with imitation
provided it is done well. After all, Li Bo’s poem “On Phoenix Terrace” is entirely based
on Cui Hao’s “Yellow Crane Tower”, yet it is a much better poem. On reflection our
young friend’s couplet seems more poetical and imaginative than the original.’
‘Oh, come now!’ said Jia Zheng. But they could see he was not displeased.
Leaving the place of many fragrances behind them, they had not advanced much
further when they could see ahead of them a building of great magnificence which
Jia Zheng at once identified as the main reception hall of the Residence.
Roof above roof soared,
Eye up-compelling,
Of richly-wrought chambers
And high winding galleries.
Green rafts of dark pine
Brushed the eaves’ edges.
Milky magnolias
Bordered the buildings.
Gold-glinting cat-faces,
Rainbow-hued serpents’ snouts
Peered out or snarled down
From cornice and finial.
‘It is rather a showy building,’ said Jia Zheng. But the literary gentlemen reassured
him:
‘Although Her Grace is a person of simple and abstemious tastes, the exalted
position she now occupies makes it only right and proper that there should be a
certain amount of pomp in her reception. This building is in no way excessive.’
Still advancing in the same direction, they presently found themselves at the foot of
the white marble memorial arch which framed the approach to the hall. The pattern
of writhing dragons protectively crouched over its uppermost horizontal was so
pierced and fretted by the sculptor’s artistry as to resemble lacework rather than
solid stone.
‘What inscription do we want on this arch?’ Jia Zheng inquired.
‘“Peng-lai’s Fairy Precincts” is the only name that would do it justice,’ said the
literary gentlemen.
Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing.
The sight of this building and its arch had inspired a strange and unaccountable stir of
emotion in Bao-yu which on reflec?tion he interpreted as a sign that he must have
known a build?ing somewhat like this before -- though where or when he could not
for the life of him remember. He was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded
him of; when Jia Zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch, and
he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composi?tion. The literary
gentlemen, not knowing the nature of his preoccupation, supposed that his father’s
incessant bullying had worn him out and that he had finally come to the end of his
inspiration. They feared that further bullying might once more bring out the mulish
streak in him, thereby provoking an explosion which would be distasteful for
everybody. Accordingly they urged Jia Zheng to allow him a day’s grace in which to
produce something suitable. Jia Zheng, who was secretly beginning to be
apprehensive about the possible consequences of Grandmother Jia’s anxiety for her
darling grand?son, yielded, albeit with a bad grace:
‘Jackanapes! So even you have your off moments it seems. Well, I’ll give you a day
to do it in. But woe betide you if you can’t produce something tomorrow! And it had
better be something good, too, because this is the most important building in the
garden.’
After they had seen over the building and come out again, they stopped for a while
on the terrace to look at a general view of the whole garden and attempted to make
out the places they had already visited. They were surprised to find that even now
they had covered little more than half of the whole area. Just at that moment a
servant came up to report that someone had arrived with a message from Yu-cun.
‘I can see that we shan’t be able to finish today,’ said Jia Zheng. However, if we go
out by the way I said, we should at least be able to get some idea of the general
layout.’
He conducted them to a large bridge above a crystal curtain of rushing water. It was
the weir through which the water from the little river which fed all the pools and
watercourses of the garden ran into it from outside. Jia Zheng invited them to name
it.


‘This is the source of the “Drenched Blossoms” stream we looked at earlier on,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘We should call it “Drenched Blossoms Weir”.’
‘Rubbish!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You may as well forget about your “Drenched Blossoms”,
because we are not going to use that name!’
Their progress continued past many unexplored features of the garden, viz:
a summer lodge
a straw-thatched cot
a dry-stone wall
a flowering arch
a tiny temple nestling beneath a hill
a nun’s retreat hidden in a little wood
a straight gallery
a crooked cave
a square pavilion
and a round belvedere.
But Jia Zheng hurried past every one of them without enter?ing. However, he had
now been walking for a very long time without a rest and was beginning to feel
somewhat footsore; and so, when the next building appeared through the trees
ahead, he proposed that they should go in and sit down, and led his party towards it
by the quickest route possible. They had to walk round a stand of double-flowering
ornamental peach-trees and through a circular opening in a flower-covered bamboo
trellis. This brought them in sight of the building’s whitewashed enclosing wall and
the contrasting green of the weeping willows which surrounded it. A roofed gallery
ran from each side of the gate round the inner wall of the fore?court, in which a few
rocks were scattered. On one side of it some green plantains were growing and on
the other a weeping variety of Szechwan crab, whose pendant clusters of
double-flowering carmine blossoms hung by stems as delicate as golden wires on the
umbrella-shaped canopy of its boughs.
‘What magnificent blossom!’ exclaimed the literary gentle?men. ‘One has seen
plenty of crab-apple blossom before, but never anything as beautiful as this.’
‘This kind is called “maiden crab”,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It comes from abroad. According
to vulgar belief it originally came from the Land of Maidens, and that is supposed to
be the reason why it blooms so profusely. Needless to say, it is only the ignorant sort
of persons who hold this ridiculous belief.’
‘It certainly has most unusual blossoms,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Who knows,
perhaps there is something in the popular belief.’
‘Surely,’ said Bao-yu, ‘it is much more probable that poets and painters gave it the
name of “maiden crab” because of its rouge-like colour and delicate, drooping shape,
and that the name was misunderstood by ignorant, literal-minded people, who made
up this silly story to account for it.’
‘That must be it!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Most grate?ful for the explanation!’
While they were speaking they were at the same time arranging themselves on some
benches in the gallery.
‘Has anyone an original idea for a name?’ said Jia Zheng when they were all seated.
One of them proposed ‘Storks in the Plantains’. Another suggested ‘Shimmering
Splendour’.
“‘Shimmering Splendour”,’ Jia Zheng and the others repeated, trying out the words.
‘That’s good!’
‘A lovely name!’ said Bao-yu. But a moment later he added: ‘Rather a pity, though.’
‘Why “rather a pity”?’ they asked.
‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘there are both plantains and crab-apple blossom in this
courtyard. Whoever planted them must have been thinking of “the red and the
green”. If our name men?tions only one and leaves out the other, it will seem
somehow inadequate.’
‘What do you suggest, then?’ said Jia Zheng.
       ‘I suggest “Fragrant Red and Lucent Green”,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That takes account
of both of them.’
Jia zheng shook his head:
‘No, that’s no good!’
He led them inside the building. Its interior turned out to be all corridors and alcoves
and galleries, so that properly speaking it could hardly have been said to have rooms
at all. The partition walls which made these divisions were of wooden panelling
exquisitely carved in a wide variety of motifs: bats in clouds, the ‘three friends of
winter’—pine, plum and bamboo, little figures in landscapes, birds and flowers,
scrollwork, antique bronze shapes, ‘good luck’ and ‘long life’ characters, and many
others. The carvings, all of them the work of master craftsmen, were beautified with
inlays of gold, mother-o’-pearl and semi-precious stones. In addition to being
panelled, the partitions were pierced by numerous apertures, some round, some
square, some sun-flower-shaped, some shaped like a fleur-de-lis, some cusped, some
fan-shaped. Shelving was concealed in the double thick?ness of the partition at the
base of these apertures, making it possible to use them for storing books and writing
materials and for the display of antique bronzes, vases of flowers, miniature
tray-gardens and the like. The overall effect was at once richly colourful and, because
of the many apertures, airy and graceful.
The trompe-l’ail effect of these ingenious partitions had been further enhanced by
inserting false windows and doors in them, the former covered in various pastel
shades of gauze, the latter hung with richly-patterned damask portieres. The main
walls were pierced with window-like perforations in the shape of zithers, swords,
vases and other objects of virtù.
The literary gentlemen were rapturous:
‘Exquisite!’ they cried. ‘what marvellous workmanship!’
Jia Zheng, after taking no more than a couple of turns inside this confusing interior,
was already lost. To the left of him was what appeared to be a door. To the right was
a wall with a window in it. But on raising its portiere he discovered the door to be a
bookcase; and when, looking back, he observed— what he had not noticed before—
that the light coming in through the silk gauze of the window illuminated a
passage-way lead?ing to an open doorway, and began walking towards it, a party of
gentlemen similar to his own came advancing to meet him, and he realized that he
was walking towards a large mirror. They were able to circumvent the mirror, but
only to find an even more bewildering choice of doorways on the other side.
‘Come!’ said Cousin Zhen with a laugh. ‘Let me show you the way! If we go out
here we shall be in the back courtyard. We can reach the gate of the garden much
more easily from the back courtyard than from the front.’
He led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed, then through a door into a
garden full of rambler roses. Behind the rose-trellis was a stream running between
green banks. The literary gentlemen were intrigued to know where the water came
from. Cousin Zhen pointed in the direction of the weir they had visited earlier:
‘The water comes in over that weir, then through the grotto, then under the lea of
the north-east “mountain” to the little farm. There a channel is led off it which runs
into the south-east corner of the garden. Then it runs round and rejoins the main
stream here. And from here the water flows out again underneath that wall.’
‘How very ingenious!’
They moved on again, but soon found themselves at the foot of a tall ‘mountain’.
‘Follow me!’ said Cousin Zhen, amused at the bewilder?ment of the others, who
were now completely at sea as to their whereabouts. He led them round the foot of
the ‘mountain’—and there, miraculously, was a broad, flat path and the gate by
which they had entered, rising majestically in front of them.
‘Well!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen. ‘This beats everything! The skill with
which this has all been designed is quite out of this world!’
Whereupon they all went out of the garden.

*

Bao-yu was now longing to get back to the girls, but as no dis?missal was
forthcoming from his father, he followed him along with the others into his study.
Fortunately Jia Zheng suddenly recollected that Bao-yu was still with him:
‘Well, run along then! Your grandmother will be worrying about you. I take it you’re
not still waiting for more?’
At last Bao-yu could withdraw. But as soon as he was in the courtyard outside, he was
waylaid by a group of Jia Zheng’s pages who laid hands on him and prevented him
from going.
‘You’ve done well today, haven’t you, coming out top with all those poems? You
have us to thank for that! Her Old Ladyship sent round several times asking about
you, but because the Master was so pleased with you, we told her not to worry. If we
hadn’t done that, you wouldn’t have had the chance to show off your poems!
Everyone says they were better than all the others. What about sharing your good
luck with us?’
Bao-yu laughed good-naturedly.
‘All right. A string of cash each.’
‘Who wants a measly string of cash? Give us that little purse you’re wearing!’ And
without a ‘by your leave’ they began to despoil him, beginning with the purse and his
fan-case, of all his trinkets, until every one of the objects he carried about him had
been taken from him.
‘Now,’ they said, ‘we’ll see you back in style!’
And closing round him, they marched him back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment in
triumphal procession.
Grandmother Jia had been waiting for him with some anxiety, and was naturally
delighted to see him come in apparently none the worse for his experience.
Soon after, when he was back in his own room, Aroma came in to pour him some tea
and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had
disappeared.
‘Where have the things from your belt gone?’ she said. ‘I suppose those worthless
pages have taken them again.’
Dai-yu overheard her and came up to inspect. Sure enough, not one of the things
was there.
‘So you’ve given away that little purse I gave you? Very well, then. You needn’t
expect me to give you anything in future, however much you want it!’
With these words she went off to her own room in a temper, and taking up a still
unfinished perfume sachet which she was making for him at his own request, she
began to cut it up with her embroidery scissors. Bao-yu, observing that she was angry,
had hurried after her—but it was too late. The sachet was already cut to pieces.
Although it had not been finished, Bao-yu could see that the embroidery was very
fine, and it made him angry to think of the hours and hours of work so wantonly
destroyed. Tearing open his collar he took out the little embroidered purse which had
all along been hanging round his neck and held it out for her to see.
‘Look! What’s that? When have I ever given anything of yours to someone else?’
Dai-yu knew that he must have treasured her gift to have worn it inside his clothing
where there was no risk of its being taken from him. She regretted her over-hasty
destruction of the sachet and hung her head in silence.
‘You needn’t have cut it up,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I know it’s only because you hate giving
things away. Here, you can have this back too since you’re so stingy!’
He tossed the purse into her lap and turned to go. Dai-yu burst into tears of rage, and
picking up the little purse, attacked that too with her scissors. Bao-yu hurried back
and caught her by the wrist.
‘Come, cuzzy dear!’ he said with a laugh. ‘Have mercy on it!’
Dai-yu threw down the scissors and wiped her streaming eyes.
‘You shouldn’t blow hot and cold by turns. If you want to quarrel, let’s quarrel
properly and have nothing to do with each other!’
She got up on the kang in a great huff, and turning her back on him, sobbed into her
handkerchief and affected to ignore his presence. But Bao-yu got up beside her, and
with many soothing words and affectionate endearments humbly en?treated her
forgiveness.
Meanwhile in the front room Grandmother Jia was calling loudly for her beloved
grandson.
‘Master Bao is in the back with Miss Lin,’ they told her.
‘Ah, good!’ said the old lady. ‘Let us leave them alone together, then. it will be a
nice relaxation for him after the strain of being so long with his father -- as long as
they don’t argue.’
‘Yes, milady.’
Finding herself unable to shake off Bao-yu’s attentions, Dai-yu got up from the kang:
‘I can see you are determined not to let me live in peace. I shall just have to go
elsewhere.’ And off she went.
‘Wherever you go, I shall go with you,’ said Bao-yu, taking up the purse and
beginning to fasten it on again. But Dai-yu snatched it away from him.
‘First you say you don’t want it, and now you are trying to put it on again. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself!’
Her anger dissolved in a little explosion of laughter.
‘Dearest cuzzy!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Won’t you please make me another sachet?’
‘That depends on whether I feel in the mood or not,’ said Dai-yu.
Chatting together they went out of the room and round to Lady Wang’s apartment.
Bao-chai was there already. They found everyone there in a state of great excitement
owing to the fact that Jia Qiang had lust arrived back from Soochow with the twelve
child-actresses he had purchased there, to?gether with their instructors and all the
costumes and proper?ties they would use in performing their plays.
Aunt Xue had now moved to a quiet, secluded apartment m the north-east corner of
the mansion, and Pear-tree Court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama
school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges. A number
of female members of the Rong-guo staff who had some previous training in singing
and acting—they were all grey-haired old women by now—were put in charge of the
domestic arrangements. Pay and expenses and the provision of whatever was
needed for the maintenance of the troupe was to remain in the hands of Jia Qiang,
who was also to keep the accounts.
Simultaneously with this arrival, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife had come to announce that the
selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns—twelve Buddhist and twelve
Taoist—had been successfully accomplished. Even the twenty-four little habits they
would wear had now arrived brand-new from the tailor. But that was not all. It
appeared that a young lady who had entered the church under half vows as an
‘unshaved nun’ might be persuaded to loin them.
‘She comes of a highly educated official family from Soo?chow,’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife
told them. ‘As a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of
“proxy novices” in the hope that she would get better; but all was of no avail. In the
end there was nothing for it but for the young lady to take the great step herself --
though as a lay sister, without the shaving of hair. And sure enough her illness got
better immediately. She is now eighteen years of age. Her name in religion is
“Adamantina”. She lost both her parents some time ago and has only two old nurses
and a little maid to look after her. She’s said to be a great clerk and knows all the
classics by heart. What’s more, she is a very handsome young woman. She moved
into this area with her teacher a year ago because of some relic of Guanyin she had
heard about and because there are some old Sanskrit texts here that she wanted to
look at. She has been living ever since in the Sakyamuni Convent outside the west
gate. Her teacher was a great authority on the “Primordial” branch of the Tantra. She
died last winter. As she lay dying she told Adamantina that she was not to go back
home, but to wait here quietly for a call. That is why she stays on here and has never
taken her teacher’s coffin back.’
‘We should certainly take advantage of this to invite her here,’ said Lady Wang.
‘We have tried asking her,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, ‘but the reply she gives is that
noble households are given to trampling on other people’s feelings, and she is not
disposed to be trampled on.’
‘She is bound to be rather a ‘proud young woman, coming from a family of
officials,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t see why we shouldn’t make out a written invitation
and request her formally.’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife promised to see this done and hurried off to ask one of the
professional letter-writers in the family’s employment to make out a formal invitation.
Next day a carriage was sent round to fetch Adamantina to the mansion in a style
befitting a young gentlewoman of tender suscepti?bilities.
But as to what happened thereafter: that will be disclosed in the ensuing chapter.
CHAPTER 18



A brief family reunion is permitted by the
magnanimity of a gracious Emperor
And an Imperial Concubine takes pleasure in the
literary progress of a younger brother



Just at that moment a servant came in to say that the workmen needed some gauze
for pasting on window-lattices and asked Xi-feng if she would unlock the storeroom
for them. Then another servant arrived and asked her to take charge of some gold
and silver plate. Lady Wang and her maids also seemed to be fully occupied.
Thoughtful Bao-chai pointed out to Bao-yu and the rest that they were getting in
everyone’s way, and at her suggestion they all adjourned to Ying-chun’s room.
Lady Wang’s business in fact continued unabated until well into the tenth month. By
then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the various buildings in the
garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques; supplies of
livestock—storks, deer, rabbits, chicken, geese, and so forth--had been purchased
and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared; Jia Qiang’s
young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces;
and the little Buddhist and Taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their
respective liturgies. Jia Zheng could now feel reasonably well satisfied that things
were as they should be, and invited Grandmother Jia into the garden for a final
inspection in which she was to suggest any last-minute alterations that might still be
needed. When not the slightest shadow of an imperfection could any more be found,
he at last sent in his written application for a Visitation. The Gracious Reply arrived
on the very same day:

Her Grace will make a Family Visitation next year on the fif?teenth of the first month,
being the Festival of Lanterns.

The receipt of this reply seemed to throw the Jia family into an even greater frenzy of
preparation than before, so that even its New Year celebrations that year were
somewhat scamped.
In no time at all the Festival of Lanterns seemed to be almost upon them. On the
eighth of the first month a eunuch came from the Palace to inspect the layout of the
Separate Residence and to establish where the Imperial Concubine would ‘change
her clothes’, where she would sit to converse with her family, where she would
receive their obeisances, where she would feast them, and where she would retire to
when she wanted to rest. The eunuch Chief of Security also arrived with his eunuch
minions and supervised a great deal of sealing-up and screening-off everywhere. He
also instructed the members of the household in the regulations for leaving and
entering, serving food and bringing messages, all of which had to be done through
special entrances and exits and by special routes.
Outside the mansion the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and a
gentleman from the Board of Works were busy supervising the sweeping of the
surrounding streets and the chasing away of all idlers, onlookers and other
suspicious-looking characters.
Meanwhile Jia She and the consortium were putting up ornamental lanterns
everywhere in the gardens and fixing fireworks in place for a pyrotechnic display in
honour of the visit. By the fourteenth everything was finally ready. No one in the Jia
household, whether master or servant, had a wink of sleep throughout the whole of
that night.
By five o’clock next morning, when it was still dark night outside, all those in the
family from Grandmother Jia down?wards who held any sort of rank or title were
already dressed in full court rig. In the Separate Residence
    painted phoenix and coiling dragon
         flapped and fluttered on drapes and curtains,
         gold and silver-work gleamed and glinted,
         jewels and gems made a fiery sparkle,
         subtle incenses smouldered in brazen censers,
        ‘everlastings’ blossomed in china vases;
—and all was so silent, that throughout the whole of that great garden not the sound
of a cough was to be heard.
Jia She and the other menfolk drew themselves up outside the west gate.
Grandmother Jia stood outside the main gate with the female members of the family.
They noticed that the ends of the street and the entrances of the side-streets leading
into it had all been screened off.
Just as they were beginning to grow impatient, a eunuch trotted up on horseback
and was stopped and questioned by Jia Zheng
‘Oh, you’re much too early yet!’ said the eunuch. ‘Her Grace won’t be taking her
lunch until one o’clock; then at two she goes to divine service in the Bao-ling chapel.
Five o’clock, when she has an appointment to feast with the Emperor in the Da-ming
Palace and look at the New Year lanterns, is the first opportunity she will have of
asking permission to leave. I should be surprised if she got started much before seven
o’clock this evening!’
‘Well,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when she heard this, ‘you and Aunt Wang
may as well go back to your room. You will be able to come back later on nearer the
time.’
Grandmother Jia and the other ladies took her advice and went off, leaving Xi-feng to
attend to whatever still needed doing in the garden. Under her direction some of the
stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine, while other
servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden’s many
lanterns with.
Suddenly, as afternoon drew towards evening, a clatter of many hooves was heard,
and after a short pause, a group of ten or so eunuchs rushed in out of breath,
clapping their hands as they ran. This was taken by the other eunuchs as a sign that
the Imperial Concubine was on her way, for they at once jumped up and hurried to
their prearranged places. The family, too, took up their positions once more, Jia She
and the menfolk outside the west gate and Grandmother Jia with the ladies outside
the main entrance.
For a long time there was total silence. Then a couple of eunuchs on horseback came
riding very, very slowly up to the west gate. Dismounting, they led their horses out of
sight behind the cloth screens, then returned to take up their stand at the sides of
the road, half-facing towards the west. After a considerable wait, two more eunuchs
arrived and went through the same motions as the first pair. Then another two, and
then another, until in all some ten pairs were standing at the sides of the road, their
faces turned expectantly towards the west.
Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine’s procession
at last came in sight.
First came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners.
Then several more pairs with ceremonial pheasant-feather fans.
Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special ‘palace incense’ was
burning.
Next came a great gold-coloured ‘seven-phoenix’ umbrella of state, hanging from its
curve-topped shaft like a great drooping bell-flower. In its shadow was borne the
Imperial Concubine’s travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes.
Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered
handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items.
Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped palanquin
with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders
of eight eunuch bearers.
As Grandmother Jia and the rest dropped to their knees eunuchs rushed up and
helped them to get up again. The palanquin passed through the great gate and made
for the entrance of a courtyard on the east side of the forecourt. There a eunuch
knelt beside it and invited the Imperial Concubine to descend and ‘change her
clothes’. The bearers carried it through the entrance and set it down just inside the
courtyard. The other eunuchs then withdrew, leaving Yuan-chun’s ladies-in-waiting to
help her from the palanquin.
The courtyard she now stepped out into was brilliant with coloured lanterns of silk
gauze cunningly fashioned in all sorts of curious and beautiful shapes and patterns.
An illuminated sign hung over the entrance of the principal building:

PILLED WITH FAVOURS BATHED IN BLESSINGS

Yuan-chun passed beneath it into the room that had been prepared for her, then,
having ‘changed her clothes’, came out again and stepped back into the palanquin,
which was now borne into the garden.
Her first impression was a confused one of curling drifts of incense smoke and
gleaming colours. There were lanterns everywhere, and soft strains of music. She
seemed to be enter?ing a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and
luxury and delight. Looking at it from the depths of her palanquin she shook her head
a little sadly and sighed:
‘Oh dear, this is all so extravagant!’
At that moment a eunuch knelt beside the palanquin and invited the Imperial
Concubine to proceed by boat. Stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an
expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon. Lanterns of
crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks, their silvery
radiance giving the white marble, in the semi-darkness, the appearance of gleaming
drifts of snow. Because of the season, the willows and apricot trees above them were
bare and leafless; but in place of leaves they were festooned with hundreds of tiny
lanterns, and flowers of gauze, rice-paper and bast had been fastened to the tips of
their branches. Other lanterns made of shells and feathers, in the form of lotuses,
water-lilies, ducks and egrets floated on the surface of the water below. It would
have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the
more brilliant spectacle. Together they combined to make a fairyland of jewelled light.
And to these visual delights were added the many charming miniature gardens on
the barge itself—not to mention its pearl blinds, embroidered curtains, and the
carved and painted oars and paddle with which it was furnished. While Yuan-chun
was still admiring all this, her boat approached a landing-stage in a grotto, above
which hung a lantern-sign inscribed with these words:

SMARTWEED BANK AND FLOWERY HARBOUR

Stone’s Note to Reader:
You may find it surprising that ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’, ‘The Phoenix
Dance’ and those other names, which in the last chapter we showed Bao-yu
inventing in an aptitude test imposed at random by his father, should actually have
been used on the occasion of the Imperial Concubine’s first visit to her family. Surely,
you will say, a household as long established and highly cultivated as the Jias’ must
have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon
for such important purposes as these? These were no wealthy parvenus whose
vulgarity would be satisfied with the effusions of a gifted schoolboy for filling in the
gaps where inscription are felt to be de rigueur.
The answer lies in Yuan-chun’s special relationship with Bao-yu. Before Yuan-chun
entered the Palace, she had been brought up mainly by Grandmother Jia; and when
Bao-yu appeared on the scene (at a time when his mother was already middle-aged
and unlikely to have any more children) she had lavished all her affection on this little
brother who spent all his time with her at their grandmother’s. When he was still a
very little boy of only three or four and had not yet begun his schooling, she had
taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters.
Although they were brother and sister, their relationship was more like that of a
mother and her son; and even after she entered the Palace, she was always writing
letters to her father and her male cousins in which she expressed concern for the
little boy who was so constantly in her thoughts. ‘I beg you to be most careful in your
handling of this child,’ she once wrote. ‘If you are not strict with him, he will never
grow up into a proper man. But if you are too strict, you may endanger his health and
cause Grandmother to be distressed.’
When, some months previously, Jia Zheng received a favourable report from Bao-yu’s
schoolmaster in which his creative ability was commended, he had used the visit to
the garden as a means of trying him out. The results were not, of course, what a
great writer would have produced in similar circumstances, but at least they were not
unworthy of the family’s literary traditions, and Jia Zheng resolved that his daughter
should see them, so that she might know that the progress made by her beloved
younger brother fully came up to the measure of those ardent hopes she had so
often expressed in her letters.
—Incidentally, Bao-yu had, in the intervening time, supplied many more inscriptions
for the places they had been unable to cover on that first occasion.
Stone

When Yuan-chun saw the words ‘Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour’ she
laughed.
‘Surely “Flowery Harbour” is enough by itself? Why “Smartweed Bank” as well?’
At once an attendant eunuch disembarked and rushed like the wind to tell Jia Zheng,
who
immediately gave orders to have the inscription changed.
By this time the barge had drawn alongside the bank and Yuan-chun disembarked
and
stepped once more into her palanquin. Soon she was borne into that part of the
garden where
‘Roof above roof soared
Eye up-compelling ...’
and saw the white marble memorial arch which had so strongly affected Bao-yu
when he first saw it. It now bore a temporary inscription:

PRECINCT OF THE CELESTIAL VISITANT

Yuan-chun gave orders that the words ‘The House of Reunion’ should be substituted.
She now ascended the terraces and entered the open-fronted hall of audience.
From a ring of cressets against the night sky
a fragrant scatter dropped on the flagstones;
and candelabra like fiery fir-trees
gleamed festively in the gilded casements;
         there were blinds looped and fringed like a prawn’s belly,
         there were rugs in rows like an otter’s offering;
         and tripods smoked with perfumes of musk and borneol,
         and behind the throne waved fans of pheasant feathers.
It was a scene no whit less splendid than that fairy palace of which the poet sings:

The abode of the Princess has cassia halls and orchid chambers.


‘How is it that this place has no name?’ asked Yuan-chun.
‘This is the principal hall of the Residence, Your Grace. The family dared not give it a
name without consulting you first.
Her Grace nodded.
A eunuch Master of Ceremonies now requested her to seat herself upon a chair of
state in order to receive the obeisances of her family. Music struck up from a band
stationed at either side of the steps as two eunuchs conducted Jia She and Jia Zheng
onto the terrace beneath. The other male members of the family ranged themselves
behind them and the whole party then began to advance in formation up the steps
into the hall.
‘Excused!’
A lady-in-waiting came forward and uttered this single word as an indication that the
Imperial Concubine wished to absolve them from the ceremonial, and with a slight
bow they with?drew.
It was now the turn of Grandmother Jia (‘the Dowager Lady Jia of Rong-guo’ they
called her) and the ladies of the household to make their obeisance. The eunuchs led
them up the steps at the east side of the terrace on to the platform in front of the
hall, where they ranged themselves in order of precedence.
Once more the lady-in-waiting pronounced the absolving word and they, too,
withdrew.
After tea had been offered three times as etiquette prescribed, the Imperial
Concubine descended from her throne, the music stopped, and she withdrew into a
side room to ‘change her clothes’. A less formal carriage than the imperial palanquin
had been prepared which carried her from the garden to her family’s own quarters.
Inside Grandmother Jia’s apartment Yuan-chun became a grandchild once more and
knelt down to make her kotow. But Grandmother Jia and the rest knelt down too and
prevented her from prostrating herself. She ended up, clinging to Grandmother Jia by
one hand and Lady Wang by the other, while the tears streamed down her face, too
overcome to say anything. All three of them, in fact, though there was so much they
wanted to say, seemed quite incapable of speech and stood there holding each other
and sobbing, apparently un?able to stop. The others present— Lady Xing, Li Wan,
Wang Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun—stood round them weeping silently.
No one spoke a word.
Yuan-chun at last restrained her sobs and forced a smile to her tear-stained face:
‘It hasn’t been easy, winning this chance of coming back among you after all those
years since I was first walled up in That Place. Now that we are seeing each other at
last, we ought to talk and be cheerful, not waste all the time crying! I shall be leaving
again in no time at all, and Heaven only knows when I shall have another chance of
seeing you!’
At this point she broke down once more and had to be comforted by Lady Xing.
When she had composed herself, Grandmother Jia made her sit down while the
members of the family came forward one at a time to greet her and say a few words.
This was an occasion for further tears. Then the senior menservants of both the
Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions assembled in the courtyard outside and paid their
respects. They were followed by the women servants and maids, who were allowed
to come inside the room to make their kotow.
Yuan-chun asked why her Aunt Xue and her cousins Bao-chai and Lin Dai-yu were
missing.
‘Relations outside the Jia family are not allowed to see you without a special
invitation, dear,’ Lady Wang told her.
Yuan-chun asked them to be invited in immediately, and Aunt Xue and the two girls
arrived after a few moments. They would have kotowed to her in accordance with
court etiquette had not Yuan-chun hurriedly excused them from doing so. The three
of them went up to her, and niece and aunt exchanged news of the years that had
elapsed since they last met.
Next Lutany and the other maids who had accompanied Yuan-chun into the Palace
came forward to make their kotows to Grandmother Jia. The old lady at once
motioned to them to rise and gave instructions to her own servants to entertain
them in another room.
The senior eunuchs and the ladies-in-waiting were now led off by members of the
staffs of Jia She’s household and the Ning-guo mansion to be entertained elsewhere,
leaving only three or four very junior eunuchs in attendance. Yuan-chun was at last
free to chat informally with her mother and the other female members of her family
and learned for the first time about many personal and domestic events that had
occurred in the household since she left it.
Then there was her interview with Jia Zheng, which had to take place with her father
standing outside the door-curtain of the room in which she was sitting. Now that she
was the Emperor’s woman, this was the nearest to her he could ever hope to get.
The sense of deprivation struck home to Yuan-?chun as she addressed him through
the curtain.
‘What is the use of all this luxury and splendour,’ she said bitterly, ‘if I am to be
always separated from those I love —denied the tenderness which even the poorest
peasant who seasons his bread with salt and pickles and dresses in hempen
homespun is free to enjoy?’
With tears in his eyes the good man delivered the following little speech to the
daughter he could not see:
‘Madam.
That a poor and undistinguished household such as ours should have produced, as it
were, a phoenix from amidst a flock of crows and pies to bask in the sunshine of
Imperial favour and shed its reflected beams on the departed representatives of our
ancestral line must be attributable to the concentration in your single person of the
quintessences of all that is most admirable in celestial and terrestrial nature and the
accumulated merit of many generations of our forebears, and is an honour and a
blessing in which my wife and I are proud to be participators.
‘Our beloved Emperor, who embodies in his own Sacred Person those life-giving
forces which are always invisibly at work in the natural cosmos, has showered down
upon his grate?ful subjects a gracious kindness unprecedented in the annals of
recorded history—a kindness which even the expenditure of our life’s blood to the
veriest ultimate drop would be wholly inadequate to repay and which only the most
unremitting pains and unswerving loyalty in the discharge of those duties to which it
has pleased him to call us could adequately express.
‘It is our earnest prayer that His Sacred Majesty may con?tinue long to reign over
us, a blessing to all his peoples; and that Your Grace should feel no anxiety
concerning the welfare of my wife and myself during our now declining years, but
should rather cherish and sustain your own precious person, in order to be the better
able to serve His Sacred Majesty with care and diligence, seeking by that service to
be worthy of the tender regard and loving favour which he has been graciously
pleased to bestow upon you.’
To this formal speech the Imperial Concubine made a formal reply:
‘Sir. It is of course desirable that you should exercise the utmost diligence when
engaged upon business of state, but it is to be hoped that you will take sufficient care
of your own well-being whenever not so engaged, and will under no circumstances
vex yourself with anxiety on our behalf.’
‘The inscriptions at present displayed on the pavilions and other buildings in the
garden were composed by Bao-yu,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If there are any places in the
garden which particularly take your fancy, we hope you will name them for us.’
The news that Bao-yu could already compose inscriptions evoked a smile of pleasure.
‘He has made progress, then!’
Jia Zheng withdrew.
‘But why is Bao-yu not with us?’ she added.
‘The menfolk of the family are not supposed to see you without special reason,’
Grandmother Jia explained.
Yuan-hun at once gave orders that he should be summoned, and presently he was
brought in by one of the little eunuchs. When he had completed his kotow she called
him over, and stretching Out her arms, drew him to her bosom where she held him in
a close embrace, stroking his hair and fondling the back of his neck.
‘What a lot you have grown---!’ she began. But the rest was drowned in a flood of
tears.
You-shi and Xi-feng now approached to announce that a feast awaited her in the
Separate Residence. Yuan-chun rose to her feet, and bidding Bao-yu lead the way,
walked with the rest of the company to the gate of the garden. There, in the light of
the innumerable lanterns, all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her
entertainment. The route led through ‘The Phoenix Dance’, ‘Fragrant Red and Lucent
Green’, ‘The Hopeful Sign’, and ‘The Garden of Spices’. This time the inspection was
no perfunctory one. Yuan-chun insisted on looking inside the buildings and climbing
up and down their stairs. She crossed bridges, she walked round each tiny ‘mountain’,
and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view. All the
places she visited were so beautifully furnished and so ingeniously planned, that she
could not conceal her delight. But there was a faint note of censure in her praise
‘You really mustn’t be so extravagant in future. This is far too much!’
They had now come to the main hall. Having first decreed that they should dispense
with court etiquette—which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting
down at all—she took her place at the main table, while Grandmother Jia and the
rest sat at little tables on either side, and You-shi, Li Wan and Xi-feng moved to and
fro, dispensing wine and helping with the service.
While they were still drinking, Yuan-chun sent for writing materials, and taking up a
brush, began in her own hand to write out some names for the parts of the garden
she had liked the best. The name she chose for the garden as a whole was ‘Prospect
Garden’, and she composed the following couplet to go outside the main reception
hall:

For all earth to share, his great compassion has been extended,
that children and humble folk may gratefully rejoice.
For all ages to admire, his noble institutions have been promoted,
that people of every land and clime may joyfully exult.

She altered ‘The Phoenix Dance’ to ‘The Naiad’s House’, and she renamed ‘Fragrant
Red and Lucent Green’ ‘Crimson Joys and Green Delights’ and named the building in
its grounds ‘The House of Green Delights’. The buildings belonging to ‘The Garden of
Spices’ she named ‘All-spice Court’. Those of ‘The Hopeful Sign’ she gave the name
‘Washbrook Farm’. The main hall became ‘Prospect Hall’ with separate names for the
high galleries on either side: ‘The Painted Chamber’ for the one on the east side, ‘The
Fragrance Gallery’ for the one on the west. Among the other names which she
invented for various other parts of the garden were:
‘The Smartweed Loggia’, ‘The Lotus Pavilion’, ‘Amaryllis Eyot’, and ‘Duckweed
Island’. She also composed inscrip?tions for some of its prospects, including
‘Pear-tree blossom in springtime rain’, ‘Paulownia leaves in autumn wind’, and
‘Rushes in the winter snow’. The couplets composed by Bao-yu were to remain
unaltered.
Having finished with the inscriptions, she proceeded to write out the following
quatrain of her own composition:

Embracing hills and streams, with skill they wrought:
Their work at last is to perfection brought.
Earth’s fairest prospects all are here installed,
So ‘Prospect Garden’ let its name be called!


‘There!’ she said with a smile to the girls. ‘I’m no genius, as you all well know, and I
have never been much of a poet. But tonight I thought I really must write something,
for this beautiful garden’s sake. Later on, when I have more time to spare, I intend to
write a Description of Prospect Garden and a set of verses to be entitled The
Visitation in commemoration of this wonderful night. But meanwhile I should like
each of you girls to compose an inscription that could be used somewhere in the
garden, and also a poem to go with it. Just write anything that comes into your heads.
I don’t want you to restrict yourselves by trying to make your poems in any way
relate to my own poor effort. As for Bao-yu: I am very pleased that he is able to
compose verses so well, and I want him to write me an octet for each of the four
places in the garden I like best: the Naiad’s House, All-spice Court - those are my two
favourites—the House of Green Delights, and Washbrook Farm. The couplets he has
already written for them are very good, but these are four such special places, that I
feel they deserve to have something more written about them. And apart from that,
if Bao-yu can show me these four poems while I am here, I shall feel that the efforts I
made at teaching him when he was a little boy were worth while.’
Bao-yu could scarcely refuse, and went off to rack his brains for some good lines.
Tan-chun was by far the most gifted of the Three Springs and joined Bao-chai and
Dai-yu in writing octets. Li Wan, Ying-chun and Xi-chun, none of whom had any talent
for versification, contented themselves with a quatrain apiece, but found even four
lines a considerable effort.
When the girls had all finished, Yuan-chun took up the papers one by one and
examined the results of their labours. Here is what they had written:

Ying-chun: Heart’s Ease

        The garden finished, all its prospects please.
        Bidden to write, I name this spot ‘Heart’s Ease’.
        Who would have thought on earth such scenes to find
        As here refresh the heart and ease the mind?

*

Tan-chun: Brightness and Grace

        Water on hills and hills on waters smile,
        More bright and graceful than the Immortal Isle.
        Midst odorous herbs the singer’s green fan hides;
        Her crimson skirt through falling petals glides.
        A radiant jewel to the world is shown,
        A fairy princess from her tower come down:
        And since her steps the garden’s walks have trod,
        No mortal foot must desecrate its sod.

*

Xi-chun: Art the Creator

        The garden’s landscape far and wide outspreads;
        High in the clouds its buildings raise their heads;
        Serene in moonlight, radiant in the sun—
        Great Nature’s handiwork has been outdone!

Li Wan: All Things Bright and Beautiful

        The finished garden is a wondrous sight.
        Unlettered and unskilled, I blush to write.
        Its marvels are not in one phrase expressed,
        Yet ‘Bright and Beautiful’ I judge the best.

Xue Bao-chai: Auspicious Skies

    West of imperial walls the garden lies;
    The sun beams on it from auspicious skies.
    Its willows orioles from the vale invite;
    Tall bamboos tempt the phoenix to alight.
    Poetic arts this night must celebrate
    Filial affection dressed in robes of state.
    Dare I, who have those jewelled phrases read,
    Add more to what She has already said?

Lin Dai-yu: The Fairy Stream

    To fairy haunts far from the world’s annoy
    A royal visit brings a double joy.
    A thousand borrowed beauties here combined
    In this new setting new enchantment find.
    Its odours sweet a poet’s wine enrich;
    Its flowers a queenly visitor bewitch.
    May she and we this favour hope to gain:
    That oft-times she may pass this way again!

*
As soon as she had finished reading the poems, Yuan-chun praised them all warmly.
‘But Cousin Lin’s and Cousin Xue’s poems are specially good,’ she said. ‘Our Jia girls
are no match for them!’
Dai-yu had confidently expected that this night would give her an opportunity of
deploying her talents to the full and amazing everyone with her genius. It was very
disappointing that no more had been required of her than a single little poem and an
inscription; and though she was obliged to confine her?self to what the Imperial
Concubine had commanded, she had composed her octet without enthusiasm and in
a very per?functory manner.
Meanwhile Bao-yu was far from finished with his consignment. He had finished
composing the poems for the Naiad’s House and All-spice Court and was still in the
middle of a poem on the House of Green Delights. Bao-chai took a peep over his
shoulder and noticed that his draft contained the line

Some wear sheathed skirts of lucent green curled tight.

When no one was looking she gave him a nudge:
‘You can tell Her Grace didn’t like “lucent green” because she only lust now altered
it to something else in your inscrip?tion. If you insist on using it in your poem, it will
look as if you are deliberately flaunting your difference of opinion. There are so many
allusions to plantain leaves you could use, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in
substituting something else.’
‘It’s all very well for you to talk,’ said Bao-yu, mopping the perspiration from his
brow, ‘but at this particular moment I can’t think of any allusion that would do.’
‘Why don’t you put “in spring green waxen sheaths” in place of your “sheathed
skirts of lucent green”?’
‘Where do you get “green waxen” from?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Tut, tut, tut!’ Bao-chai shook her head pityingly. ‘If this is what you are like tonight,
Heaven knows what you’ll be like in a few years’ time when you come to take the
Palace Examina?tion. Probably you’ll find you have forgotten even the Child’s First
Primer of Rhyming Names. It’s from the Tang poet Qian Xu’s poem “Furled Plantains”:

Green waxen candles from which no flames rise.

Do you mean to say you’ve forgotten that?’
The scales fell from Bao-yu’s eyes.
‘Good gracious, how stupid of me! The words are there ready-made and I didn’t
think of them! I shall have to call you my “One Word Teacher”, like the poet in the
story! I shan’t be able to treat you like a sister any more, I shall have to say “sir”
when I speak to you!’
‘Sister!’ said Bao-chai with a little laugh. ‘Stop fooling about and get on with your
poem! That’s your sister, sitting up there in the golden robe. I’m no sister of yours!’
Fearing that he would waste more time if she stayed, she slipped quietly away.
The poem finished, Bao-yu had now completed three out of the four commanded. At
this point Dai-yu, who was still full of dissatisfaction because her talent had been
under?employed, noticed that Bao-yu was struggling and came over to the table at
which he was working. Observing that ‘The Hopeful Sign’ still remained to be done,
she told him to get on with the copying out in fair of the three poems he had already
completed while she thought of something for ‘The Hopeful Sign’. When she had
completed a poem in her head, she scribbled it out on a piece of paper, screwed it
into a little ball, and tossed it in front of him. Bao-yu smoothed it out on the table
and read it through. It seemed to him to be ten times better than the ones he had
written himself. He copied it out in neat kai-shu after the other three and handed the
finished task to Yuan-chun for her inspection.
This is what she read:

The Phoenix Dance

                 Perfected now at last, this place is fit
                 For Bird of Paradise to enter it.
             Bach graceful wand lets fall a dewy tear;
             Each glossy leaf breathes coolness on the air.
             Through narrow-parted blocks the pent stream leaps;
             Through chinks of blind the incense thinly seeps.
             Let none the checkered shade with violence rude
             Disrupting, on the slumberer’s dreams intrude!

*

The Garden of Spices

             Fragrance of flower-drifts in these quiet confines
             Mingles with headier scents of eglantines,
             And summer’s herbs in a soft, spicy bed
             Their aromatic perfumes subtly spread.
             Light mist half screens the winding walks from view,
            Where chilly verdure soaks the clothes with dew.
            Here, slumbering quietly at the fountain’s side,
            The dreaming poet all day long may bide.

*

The House of Green Delight

            In this quiet plot, where peace reigns through the year,
            Bewitching ladies rank on rank appear:
            Some wear in spring green waxen sheaths curled tight,
            Some carmine caps, that are not doffed at night.
            Some from the trellis trail their purple sleeves,
            Some lean on rocks, where thin mists cool their leaves.
            Their Mistress, standing in the soft summer breeze,
            Finds quiet content in everything she sees.

*

The Hopeful Sign

            An inn-sign, through the orchards half-discerned,
            Promises shelter and a drink well-earned.
            Through water-weeds the pond’s geese make their way;
            Midst elms and mulberry-trees the swallows play.
            The garden’s chives are ready to prepare;
            The scent of young rice perfumes all the air.
            When want is banished, as in times like these,
            The spinner and the ploughman take their ease.

Yuan-chun was genuinely delighted.
‘You really have made progress!’ she said. She singled out ‘The Hopeful Sign’ as the
best of the four and changed the name ‘Washbrook Farm’ back to ‘Sweet-rice Village’
by way of acknowledgement. She made Tan-chun copy all ten poems -- Bao-yu’s and
the girls’ -- on to a sheet of fancy paper and sent a eunuch to show it to the
gentlemen outside. Jia Zheng and the others were very complimentary, and Jia Zheng
presented a eulogy of his own composition entitled The Visitation. Yuan-chun also
ordered Bao-yu and Jia Lan to be given presents of junket and mince, both of some
special kind only made in the Imperial kitchens. At this period Jia Lan was still only a
very little boy and did not really know what was going on. He was taken by his
mother Li Wan into Yuan-chun’s presence and stood beside his uncle Bao-yu to make
his little bow of thanks.
All this time Jia Qiang and his troupe of girl players had been waiting impatiently
below for an order to begin their performance. Just as they were reaching a peak of
impatience, a eunuch came running down to them.
‘They’ve finished writing poems,’ he said. ‘Quick, give me a play-bill!’
Jia Qiang hurriedly handed him a list of the pieces they had rehearsed, together with
a brochure containing the stage names of each of the twelve players and some notes
on the parts which each of them played. Four pieces were chosen: ‘Shi-fan
Entertains’ from The Handful of Snow, ‘The Double Seventh’ from The Palace of
Eternal Youth, ‘The Meeting of the Immortals’ from The Han-dan Road and Li-niang’s
death-scene from The Return of the Soul. Jia Qiang supervised the prepara?tions,
and soon the rock-splitting little voices and spell-bind?ing movements of the
actresses had taken over, and the stage was full of passions which were no whit less
overwhelming for being counterfeit.
No sooner had they finished than a eunuch came round, bearing a variety of fancy
cakes and sweetmeats on a gilded salver.
‘Which is “Charmante”?’ he asked, referring to the stage name of the little
soubrette who had played the part of Li?-niang’s maid in The Return of the Soul and
a dashing young huntsman in the ‘play within a play’ in The Handful of Snow.
Jia Qiang realized that the confectionery was a present for the little actress, and
taking the salver from the eunuch, made Mademoiselle Charmante come forward
and kotow her thanks.
‘Her Grace says that she enjoyed Mademoiselle Charmante’s performance the most
and would like to see her in two more pieces,’ said the eunuch. ‘She may choose any
two she likes.’
Having replied to the eunuch, Jia Qiang told Charmante that she ought to play two
more pieces from The Return of the Soul: ‘The Walk in the Garden’ and ‘The Dream’.
But neither had a part suitable for a soubrette in it, and Charmante obdurately
refused. She said she would do ‘The Assignation’ and ‘The Altercation’ from The
Bracelet and the Comb, in which the part of the pert young maidservant would allow
her comic talent a fuller scope. Jia Qiang failed to talk her out of this decision and
had to let her do as she wished. Yuan-chun was delighted, and gave special
instructions that Charmante was to be well treated and to have the best possible
training. She also awarded her, over and above her share of the presents that the
whole troupe would receive in commemoration of her visit, two dress-lengths of
tribute satin, two embroidered purses, and some miniature gold and silver ingots.
The feast was now cleared away and Yuan-chun recom?menced her tour of the
garden, visiting those places which she had not had time to look at before dinner.
When they came to the little convent nestling under its hill, she washed her hands
and entered the shrine-hall to offer incense and pray before the image of the Buddha.
She also wrote an inscription for the board which hung above the image:

THE SHIP OF MERCY ON THE SEA OF SUFFERING

and gave instructions for various extra presents to be bestowed on the little nuns in
addition to those which, along with all the other members of the household, they
were already due to receive in commemoration of her visit.
A list for the latter had already been drawn up and presently it was submitted to
Yuan-chun by a kneeling eunuch for her approval. After reading through it in silence
she approved its contents and asked that they should be distributed forthwith. The
presents distributed were as follows:

To Grandmother Jia:
one golden ru-yi sceptre
one jade ditto
a staff of carved aloeswood
a rosary of putchuk beads
four lengths of ‘Fu Gui Chang Chun’ tribute satin
four lengths of ‘Fu Shou Mian Chang’ tribute silk
ten medallions of red gold with a design showing an
ingot, a writing-brush and a sceptre (which in the
riddling rebus-language used by the makers of
such objects meant ‘All your heart’s desire’)
ten silver medallions with a design showing a stone?-
chime flanked by a pair of little fish (carrying the
rebus-message ‘Blessings in abundance’)

Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Aunt Xue each received the same selection of gifts as
Grandmother Jia with the omission of the sceptres, staff and rosary.

To Jia Jing, Jia She and Jia Zheng (each):
two new books of His Imperial Majesty’s own composition
two boxes of ink-sticks (collector’s pieces)
one solid gold wine-cup
one solid silver ditto
silks and satins as above.

To Bao-yu, Dai-yu, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun (each):
one new book
one inkstone (collector’s piece)
two specially designed medallions in gold
two ditto in silver

To Bao-yu and Jia Lan (each):
one gold necklet
one silver ditto
two gold medallions
two silver ditto

To You-shi, Li Wan and Xi-feng (each):
two gold medallions
two silver ditto
four dress-lengths of tribute silk

(Also twenty-four lengths of silk and one hundred strings of unmixed Imperial Mint
copper cash for the women-servants and maids in attendance on Grandmother Jia,
Lady Wang and the girls)

To Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Huan and Jia Rong (each):
one length of tribute satin
one gold medallion
one silver ditto

There were also a hundred bales of variegated satins, a thousand taels of silver and
an unspecified number of bottles of Palace wine for the senior servants of the Rong
and Ning Mansions and Separate Residence responsible for construction and
maintenance, attendance, theatre management, and light?ing, and an additional five
hundred strings of unmixed Im?perial Mint copper cash for the cooks, entertainers
and Miscellaneous.

When all had expressed their thanks, one of the eunuchs in charge announced that it
was a quarter to three and time for Her Grace to return to the Palace. At once
Yuan-chun’s eyes filled with tears, and even though she forced herself to smile, she
was unable to prevent a few drops from falling. Clinging to Grandmother Jia and Lady
Wang as if she would never let them go, she begged them again and again not to
grieve for her.
‘Now you mustn’t worry about me, my dears: just look after yourselves! Thanks to
the Emperor’s kindness, we are now allowed visits in the Palace once a month: so
you see we can see each other quite easily. It is silly of us to be so upset! And if His
Majesty is gracious enough to permit another Visitation next year you really mustn’t
be so extravagant again on my account!’
Grandmother Jia and the others were now sobbing audibly and were much too
overcome to reply. But Yuan-chun, how?ever hard it was to leave her family, dared
not infringe the regulations of the Imperial Household, and steeled herself to
re-enter the palanquin which was to carry her away. It was all the rest of the family
could do to restrain Grandmother Jia from making a scene, and when she was
somewhat calmed, she and Lady Wang had to be led weeping from the garden in a
state of near-collapse.
What followed will be told in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 19



A very earnest young woman offers
counsel by night
And a very endearing one is found to
be a source of fragrance by day



On the day following the Imperial Concubine’s return to the Palace, she called on the
Emperor to offer thanks and gave him a full account of her Visitation. The Emperor
was visibly pleased by her report and commanded that bounties of gold, silver and
silks should be issued to Jia Zheng and the other fathers of visiting ladies by the Inner
Treasury.
But there is no need for us to pursue these matters in further detail.

The events of the last few days had taxed the energies of all the inmates of the
Ning-guo and Rong-guo mansions to the utmost, and by now all of them were feeling
both physically and mentally exhausted. Even so, Xi-feng forced herself to supervise
the taking down and storing away of all the decora?tions and other movables from
the garden—an operation which took another two or three days to accomplish.
Xi-feng’s duties and responsibilities were so many that she could not evade them and
seek recuperation in rest and quiet as the others did. At the same time, however, the
anxiety to be thought well of and the shrinking fear of criticism that were a part of
her nature made her take pains, even when she was at her busiest, to appear
outwardly as idle and unoccupied as the rest.
Of those idle and unoccupied rest, the idlest and most un?occupied was Bao-yu. On
this particular morning, Aroma’s mother had been round first thing to report to
Grandmother Jia that she was taking her daughter home for a New Year’s party and
would not be bringing her back until late that even?ing. After her departure Bao-yu
played ‘Racing Go’ with the other maids. This was a game in which you moved your
Go-?piece across the board in accordance with the throw of dice, the object being to
reach the opposite side before everyone else and pocket all the stakes.
He was already tired of sitting indoors and was beginning to find the game boring,
when one of the maids told him that someone had just been round from Cousin
Zhen’s inviting him over to the other house to see their New Year lanterns and to join
them in watching some plays. Bao-yu told the maids to fetch his going-out clothes
and help him change. As he was on the point of leaving, someone arrived with a
present of sweetened koumiss from the Imperial Concubine. He re?membered how
much Aroma had enjoyed this drink last time they had had some, and asked them to
put it by for her. Then, having first called on Grandmother Jia to tell her he was
leav?ing, he went over to the other house to watch the players.
The plays they were performing turned out to be very noisy ones: Ding-lang Finds His
Father, Huang Bo-yang and the Ghostly Army, Monkey Makes War in Heaven and The
Investiture of the Gods. All of them, but especially the last two, seemed to involve
much rushing in and out of supernatural beings, and the sound of drums and
cymbals and blood-curdling battle-cries, as they whirled into combat across the stage
with banners flying and weapons flashing or invoked the names of the Buddha with
waving of burning joss-sticks, was positively deafening. It carried into the street
outside, where the passers-by smiled appreciatively and told each other that only a
family like the Jias could afford theatricals that produced so satisfying a volume of
noise.
To Bao-yu, however, a little of this kind of thing was more than enough, and after
sitting for a short while with the rest, he drifted off to seek his amusement elsewhere.
To begin with he went inside and spent some time in bantering conver?sation with
You-shi and the maids and concubines in the women’s quarters. When he went off
once more through the inner gate, the women assumed that he was going back to
the play and made no attempt to detain him. The menfolk —Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian,
Xue Pan and the rest—were engrossed in games of guess-fingers and other convivial
aids to drunkenness, and if they noticed his absence at all, assumed that he was
inside with the ladies and did not comment on it.
As for the pages who had accompanied him: the older ones, estimating that he had
almost certainly come over for the day, gave themselves time off to gamble and drink
with their cronies of to visit friends and relations outside, confident that if they
returned in the evening they would be in time for Bao-yu’s departure. The younger
ones wormed their way into the green-room to watch the excitement and get in the
way of the actors. Bao-yu was left without a single one of them in attendance.
Finding himself alone, he began thinking about a certain painting he remembered
having seen in Cousin Zhen’s ‘smaller study’. It was a very life-like portrait of a
beautiful woman. While everyone was celebrating, he reflected, she was sure to have
been left on her own and would perhaps be feeling lonely. He would go and have a
look at her and cheer her up.
But as he approached the study, he experienced a sudden thrill of fright. A gentle
moaning could be heard coming from inside it.
‘Good gracious!’ he thought. ‘Can the woman in the painting really have come to
life?’
He made a tiny hole in the paper window with his tongue and peeped through. It was
no painted lady he saw, stepped down from her hanging scroll upon the wall, but
Tealeaf, pressed upon the body of a girl and evidently engaged in those exercises in
which Bao-yu had once been instructed by the firry Disenchantment.
‘Good lord!’
He cried out involuntarily, and kicking open the door, strode into the study, so
startling the two inside that they shook in their clothes. Seeing that it was Bao-yu,
Tealeaf at once fell upon his knees and begged for mercy.
‘In broad daylight!’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you think you’re at? If Mr Zhen got to
hear of this, it would be more than your life is worth.’
As he spoke, his eye fell upon the girl. She had a soft, white skin, to whose charms he
could not be insensible. At the moment she was red to the very tips of her ears and
stood there in silence, hanging her head with shame. Bao-yu stamped his foot
impatiently:
‘Why don’t you go?’
The words seemed to bring her to herself, for she turned and fled immediately.
Bao-yu ran after her, shouting.
‘Don’t be afraid! I won’t tell anyone!’
Tealeaf, running out behind him, was frantic:
‘My dear little grandfather, that’s exactly what you are doing!’
‘How old is she?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘Not more than fifteen or so,’ said Tealeaf.
‘You don’t even know her age!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You can do this to her without even
knowing her age! She’s wasted on you, that’s evident. Poor girl! What’s her name?’
‘Ah now, that’s quite a story,’ said Tealeaf with a broad smile. ‘She says that just
before she was born her mother dreamed she saw a beautiful piece of brocade,
woven in all the colours of the rainbow, with a pattern of lucky swastikas all over it.
So when she was born, she gave her the name “Swastika”.’
Bao-yu smiled back.
‘She ought to have a lucky future ahead of her, then. shall I ask them tomorrow if
you can have her for your wife?’
Tealeaf thought this was a huge joke.
‘Why aren’t you watching the plays, Master Bao?’ he asked. ‘They’re ever so good!’
‘I did watch for quite a while,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I got rather deafened and came out
to walk around for a bit. That’s how I found you here. But what are we going to do
now?’
Tealeaf gave a sly little smile:
‘What about going for a ride outside the city? If we slipped off quietly we could get
there and back without anyone knowing.’
‘Too risky,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We might get kidnapped or something. Besides, there
would be terrible trouble if they found out. It’d better be somewhere nearer, so that
we can get back quickly.’
‘Who do we know near here that we could call on?’ said Tealeaf. ‘I can’t think of
anyone.’
‘I know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we go round to the Huas’ house and see what
Aroma is up to?’
‘All right. But I’ve forgotten where they live,’ said Tealeaf untruthfully. ‘And suppose
they do find out you’ve been gadding around outside’ (he added the real reason for
his hesitation) ‘they’ll say I put you up to it, and I shall get a beating.’
‘I’ll see you don’t get into trouble,’ said Bao-yu.
Reassured, Tealeaf fetched the horse, and the two of them slipped out by the back
entrance.
Luckily the Huas’ house was only a few hundred yards from the Ning-guo mansion,
and in no time at all they had reached its gate. Tealeaf entered first and called out the
name of Aroma’s elder brother, Hua Zi-fang.
Aroma’s mother was not long back from collecting the various nieces, on both her
own and her late husband’s side of the family, who had had to be fetched after she
had been to call for Aroma, and the family had only just settled down to their tea
when they heard this voice outside calling for Hua Zi-fang. To the latter’s
considerable surprise and mystification he found, on going outside to look, his
sister’s young master waiting at the gate with a servant. Having first lifted Bao-yu off
his horse, he went back into the courtyard and bawled to the rest inside:
‘It’s Master Bao!’
Aroma was dumbfounded and came running out to discover the cause of this
unaccountable visit. As soon as she saw him she clung to him anxiously:
‘What is it? Are you all right?’
Bao-yu laughed carelessly.
‘I was just feeling bored, so I came over to see what you were up to.’
‘Stupid!’ said Aroma, relieved to find that nothing was amiss. ‘What did you think I
would be up to?’
She turned to Tealeaf.
‘Who else is with you?’
‘Nobody,’ said Tealeaf with a grin. ‘Nobody else knows we’re here.’
At this Aroma became alarmed once more.
‘That’s terrible! Suppose you were to run into someone? Suppose you were to
meet the Master?’ She glanced at Bao-yu fearfully. ‘In any case, the streets are so
crowded now. You could easily get ridden down or something. It would be no joke if
you were to have an accident. You two certainly have a nerve!’ She turned to Tealeaf
again. ‘You put him up to this, didn’t you? Wait till I get back: I’ll tell his nannies
about you. They’ll have you flogged like a felon, see if they don’t!’
Tealeaf pulled a face.
‘Don’t go trying to pin the blame on me! Master Bao was cursing and swearing at
me to make me go with him. I kept telling him not to come. Anyway, we’d better be
going back now, if that’s the way you feel!’
‘You might as well stay, now you’re here,’ said Hua Zi-fang in a conciliatory manner.
‘There’s no point in quarrelling about it. The only trouble is, this is not much of a
place we live in here: poor and cramped and not too clean and that. Hardly a fit place
for the likes of Master Bao, I’m thinking.’
By this time Aroma’s mother had joined them outside to welcome the visitors. Aroma
took Bao-yu by the hand and led him in. He saw four or five girls sitting down inside
who hung their heads and blushed when he entered. Despite their blushes, Hua
Zi-fang and his mother insisted that Bao-yu should get up on the kang with them, as
they were afraid that he would find their house cold. Having installed him on the
kang, they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pour?ing tea.
‘Now don’t you two rush about, Mother,’ said Aroma. ‘I know how to look after him.
There’s no point in your giving him a lot of things he won’t be able to eat.’
As she said this, she took her own cushion that she had been sitting on, put it on top
of a little short-legged kang table, and made Bao-yu sit on it with his feet on her
metal foot-warmer. Then she took a couple of rose-shaped perfume lozenges from a
little purse she was wearing, opened up her hand-warmer, popped the lozenges onto
the burning charcoal, and closing it up again, stuffed it into the front of his gown.
Having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction, she served
him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup.
Hua Zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea. The cakes,
nuts and dried fruits were arranged on their plates, and the plates themselves on the
table, with painstaking attention to symmetry and design. Aroma could tell at a
glance that there was nothing there which Bao-yu could possibly be expected to eat.
But her family must not be offended.
‘Since you’ve decided to come,’ she said to Bao-yu with a smile. ‘we can’t let you go
without having tasted something of ours. You’ll have to try something, just to be able
to say that you have been our guest!’
She took a handful of pine nuts from one of the dishes on the table, and blowing
away the skins, handed them to him on her handkerchief.
Bao-yu noticed that Aroma’s eyes were slightly red and that there were recent
tear-stains on her powdered cheeks.
‘Why have you been crying?’ He spoke the words in an undertone as she handed
him the pine nuts.
‘Who’s been crying?’ said Aroma with a feigned laugh. ‘I’ve lust been rubbing my
eyes.’
Her little fiction was successful, for he made no further comment.
Bao-yu was wearing his dark-red gown with the pattern of golden dragons and white
fox-fur lining, and a sable-lined slate-blue jacket with fringed edges.
‘Fancy!’ said Aroma, ‘you got yourself all dressed up lust to come and see us. Didn’t
anyone ask you where you were going?’
‘No,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Actually I changed because I was going to Cousin Zhen’s. He
invited me over to watch the players.’
Aroma nodded.
‘You’d better go back after you’ve sat a bit longer,’ she said. ‘This is really no place
for you here.’
‘You shouldn’t be too long, either,’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘I’ve got something
nice waiting for you when you get back.’
‘Sh!’ said Aroma. ‘Do you want them all to hear you?’
As she said this, she reached out and took the Magic Jade from his neck.
‘Here’s something that will interest you all,’ she said, holding it out to the others.
‘You know how often you’ve spoken about that wonderful lade of Master Bao’s and
said how much you’d give for a look at it? Well, here it is! Now you can look to your
heart’s content. There you are, that’s all it is! Not so wonderful, really, is it?’
They passed it from hand to hand, and when it had gone full circle and all had
examined it, she hung it once more round his neck.
Aroma told her elder brother to go out and hire the cleanest, smartest-looking cab he
could find to take Bao-yu home in.
‘I can see him safely back,’ said Hua Zi-fang. ‘He won’t come to any harm on
horseback.’
‘It’s not a question of whether he’ll come to any harm or not,’ said Aroma ‘I’m
afraid someone might see him.’
Hua Zi-fang hurried out to hire a cab. The rest of the com?pany, realizing that Bao-yu
had no real business to be there, made no effort to detain him and rose to see him
off. Aroma snatched up a handful of sweetmeats for Tealeaf. She also gave him a few
coppers to buy fireworks with.
‘Mind you don’t tell anyone about this visit!’ she said. ‘You’ll be in trouble yourself
if they find out about it.
She escorted Bao-yu to the gate and saw him into the cab, pulling the blind down on
him as soon as he was inside. Tealeaf and her brother followed behind it with the
horse. When they arrived outside the Ning-guo mansion, Tealeaf told the cabbie to
stop.
‘We’d better go in here for a bit before going home,’ he explained to Aroma’s
brother. ‘Otherwise they might get suspicious.’
Hua Zi-fang acknowledged the sense of this precaution, and lifting Bao-yu from the
cab, helped him up on to his horse.
‘Thank you for your trouble,’ said Bao-yu with a winning smile as he rode into the
rear gate of the Ning-guo mansion.
And there, for the time being, we shall leave him.

*

When Bao-yu left his room for the other mansion, his maids were free to do exactly
as they liked and threw themselves into their amusements with great abandon. Some
played at Racing Go, some at Dice and Dominoes. Everywhere a litter of the spat-out
skins of melon-seeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence.
It was unfortunate that Nannie Li should have chosen such a moment to come
stomping in, stick in hand, to call on Bao-yu and to inquire how he was getting on.
She could see that Bao-yu was out, and the uproar created in his absence by the
maids was deeply offensive to her.
‘Now that I’ve left service and don’t come in very often,’ she said with a sigh, ‘you
girls have got worse than ever. The other nannies can do nothing with you. And as for
Bao-yu: he’s like a six-foot lamp stand that lights up others but stays dark itself; for
he’s always on about how dirty other people are, but look at the mess he allows you
to make of his own room! It’s a disgrace!’
Now the maids all knew that Bao-yu did not care about such matters. They also knew
that Nannie Li was pensioned off now and had no more power over them. They
therefore con?tinued with their fun and took no notice of her. But Nannie Li was not
to be ignored. ‘How is Bao-yu eating nowadays?’ ‘what time does he go to bed?’ She
plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all. One
of them even said, quite audibly and in her hearing, ‘Old nuisance!’
‘What’s in this covered bowl?’ Nannie Li went on. ‘It’s junket, isn’t it? Why don’t
you offer it to me?’ She picked up the gift of koumiss and began to drink it.
‘Don’t you touch that!’ said one of the maids. ‘He was keeping that for Aroma. He’ll
be angry when he gets back and finds out about that. You’d better tell him yourself
you took it. We don’t want you getting us into trouble!’
Nannie Li was angry and embarrassed at one and the same time.
‘I won’t believe it of him,’ she said. ‘I won’t believe he would be so wicked as to
grudge his old Nannie a bowl of milk. Why, he owes it to me. And not only a bowl of
milk, either. Much more precious things than that. Do you mean to tell me that
Aroma counts for more with him than I do? He ought to stop and ask himself how he
grew up to be the big boy he is today. It’s my milk he sucked, that came from my own
heart’s blood: that’s what he grew up on. And you mean to tell me that now, if I drink
one little bowlful of his milk—cow’s milk—he’s going to be angry with me? Well, I will
drink it, so there! He can do what he likes about it. And as for that Aroma. I don’t
know what sort of a wonderful creature you think she is -- a little bit of a girl I picked
out myself and trained with my own hand!’
Defiantly she applied the koumiss once more to her lip and downed it to the last
gulp.
One of the maids, politer than the rest, attempted to placate her:
‘They shouldn’t talk to you like that, Nannie! I’m not surprised you are cross. Of
course Bao-yu isn’t going to upset himself over a little thing like that. He’s much more
likely to send something nice round to you when he hears that you’ve been to see
him.’
‘Don’t you try wheedling me with your airs and graces, young woman!’ said Nannie
Li implacably. ‘You think I don’t know about Snowpink being dismissed that time over
the tea? You needn’t worry. If he makes a fuss about it tomorrow, I shall take the
blame.’
She went off in dudgeon.
Presently Bao-yu returned and sent someone off to fetch Aroma. He noticed
Skybright lying motionless on the daybed.
‘What’s the matter with her?’ he asked. ‘Is she ill? Or has she lost the game?’
‘She was winning,’ said Ripple. ‘Then Nannie Li came along and put her off her
stroke and she started losing. She got so cross that she had to go and lie down.’
‘You shouldn’t all take the old girl so seriously,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just leave her to do as
she likes and take no notice!’
Just at that moment Aroma arrived and said ‘hullo’ to everyone. She asked Bao-yu
where he had eaten and what time he had got back. She also gave her mother’s
regards to the other maids. When she had finished changing out of her holiday attire
and taken the ‘going-out’ ornaments from her hair, Bao-yu asked someone to fetch
the koumiss. There was a chorus of replies from the maids:
‘Nannie Li drank it!’
Bao-yu was about to say something when Aroma cut in with a smile:
‘So that’s what you were saving for me! It was a very kind thought; but last time I
had some of that stuff I took too much, being so fond of it, and gave myself a terrible
stomachache. It didn’t go away until I’d brought it all up again, and it’s put me off it
ever since. It’s a good job really that she did drink it. It would only have got left
around and gone bad. Now what I’d really fancy are some dried chestnuts, if you’d
like to be peeling them for me while I make up your bed on the king.’
Bao-yu was completely taken in by this little ruse, and forgetting all about the
koumiss, went off for some chestnuts and sat down by the lamp to peel them. He
and Aroma were flow alone in the room together. Glancing up with a smile from his
peeling he said,
‘What relation of yours was that girl in the red dress today?’
‘That’s my mother’s sister’s child.’
Bao-yu made appreciative noises.
‘What are you “oo-ing” and “ah-ing” about?’ said Aroma. ‘No, don’t tell me! I know
how your mind works. You think she’s not good enough to wear red.’
‘No. On the contrary,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If she’s not good enough to wear red, I
shouldn’t think anyone is. No, I was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and
how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here.’
‘Because I have the misfortune to be a slave,’ Aroma said bitterly, ‘does that mean
that all my relations ought to be slaves too? I suppose you think every pretty girl you
see is just waiting to be bought so that she can be a servant in your house?hold!’
‘How touchy you are!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Having her to live with us doesn’t have to mean
as a servant, does it? It could mean as a bride.’
‘Thank you, I’m sure!’ said Aroma. ‘But my folk are not quite grand enough for
that!’
Bao-yu was unwilling to pursue a conversation that had become so unpleasant and
went on peeling in silence.
‘Why don’t you say something?’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose I’ve upset you now. Well,
never mind! Tomorrow you can go out and buy the lot of them, just to spite me!’
‘I don’t see what answer I can give when you say things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I
only said what a nice girl she was. I think she is exactly suited to live in a big, wealthy
household like ours. Much more so than some of the lumbering idiots who do live
here.’
‘She may not have that much good fortune,’ said Aroma; ‘but for all that she has
been very delicately brought up -- the apple of my aunt’s and uncle’s eye. She was
seventeen this holidays, and her trousseau is all ready for her to be married next
year.’
‘Hai!’
An involuntary expression of regret broke from him when he heard that the girl in red
was to be married. Already Aroma’s words had made him uneasy; but worse was to
follow.
‘I haven’t been able to see much of my cousins during these last few years,’ she
said with a sigh, ‘and now it looks as if they will all have left home when I do go back.’
There was obviously a good deal more that lay behind this remark. Startled, he threw
down the chestnut he was peeling and asked her:
‘How do you mean, “when you do go back”?’
‘Today I heard my mother discussing it with my elder brother. They want me to
hold out this one year more, then next year they will see about buying me out of
service.,
Bao-yu was becoming more and more alarmed.
‘Why should they want to buy you out of service?’
‘Well upon my word, that’s a funny question to ask!’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not one of
your house-born slaves, my family lives elsewhere. I’m the only member of my family
away from home. There’s no future for me here. Naturally I want to rejoin them.’
‘You can’t if I won’t let you,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I never heard of such a thing!’ said Aroma:

‘Even in palace hall
             Law is the lord of all.

A bond is a bond. When their term of service has ended, you have to let people go.
You can’t force them to stay in service for ever and ever -- especially a household like
yours.’
Bao-yu thought a bit. What she said seemed reasonable enough.
‘But suppose Grandmother won’t let you?’
‘Why shouldn’t she?’ said Aroma. ‘If I were a very excep?tional sort of person, it’s
quite possible that she and Her Ladyship might feel upset at the idea of losing me
and offer my family money to let me stay on. But as it is I’m only a very ordinary sort
of maid. There are any number much better than me. I started off with Her Old
Ladyship and served Miss Shi for a few years. Then I was transferred to you, and I’ve
already been quite a few years with you. They would think it quite natural that my
family should want to buy me out now. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if they let me
go as a kindness without even asking for the money. If you think they wouldn’t let me
go because I’ve served you so well, that’s just ridiculous. Serving you well is no more
nor less than what I’m supposed to do. It’s my job. There’s nothing remarkable about
that. There’ll be plenty of other good ones to take my place when I’m gone. I’m not
irreplaceable.’
Everything Aroma said pointed to the reasonableness of her going and the
unreasonableness of her staying. A kind of desperateness began to seize him.
‘That may be so,’ he said, ‘but if I’m absolutely determined to keep you, I’m sure
Grandmother would speak to your mother about it. If Grandmother had a talk with
your mother and offered her a really large sum of money, surely she wouldn’t
refuse?’
‘I’m sure my mother would never insist,’ said Aroma. ‘And I don’t only mean if you
spoke to her and gave her a lot of money. Even if you didn’t speak to her about it and
didn’t give her any money at all, but simply made up your mind to keep me here
against my will and say nothing, I’m sure she wouldn’t dare object. But your family
has never gone in for throwing its weight about like that in the past, and I don’t
believe it is going to start doing so now. It would be different if I were just an object
you’d taken a fancy to and they could get it for you without any danger of upsetting
the owner by simply offering him ten times the price. But I’m not an object. If you
were to keep me here without rhyme or reason against my will, you’d not only be
doing yourselves no good, you’d be breaking up someone else’s family; and that’s
something I’m quite sure Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship would never be willing
to do.’
For some time Bao-yu reflected in silence. At last he spoke:
‘The long and short of all this is that you are definitely going, is that right?’
‘Definitely.’
‘Who would have believed that so sweet a person could be so faithless and
unfeeling?’ he thought to himself. But all he said was:
‘If I had known all along that in the end you would go away and leave me on my
own, I should never have let you work for me in the first place.’
And with those words he took himself off to bed in a thoroughly bad humour and
composed himself for sleep.
Now Aroma’s mother and elder brother had spoken earlier that day about their
intention of buying her out of service, but Aroma had at once stated that she would
never go back home as long as she lived.
‘When you sold me in the first place,’ she said, ‘it was because you had nothing to
eat and I was the only thing you had left in the house which was worth a bit of
money. I couldn’t have refused to go and watched my own mother and father starve.
But now, fortunately, I’ve got a good situation—one in which I’m not beaten and
sworn at all day long and where I’m fed and clothed as well as the masters
themselves—and the rest of you, inspire of losing Father, have managed to get in the
clear again and are as well off now as you’ve ever been. If you were still hard up and
wanted to buy me out so that you could raise a bit of money by reselling me, there
would be some point in it. But you’re not. What do you want to buy me out for? Why
don’t you just pretend that I’m dead, then you won’t need to think about buying me
out any mote?’
And after that she had had a little cry.
Seeing her so adamant, her mother and brother had natur?ally resigned themselves
to her continuing in service. They did so the more readily as Aroma’s contract was, in
point of fact, for life. In seeking to redeem her they would have had to rely on the
customary generosity of the Jia’s, who, as soon as they were approached on the
subject, would in all probability restore not only the person of Aroma but also the
body-price offered for her, but who were certainly not under any obliga?tion to do
so.
Another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known
fact— already mentioned by Aroma—that the Jia household did not ill-treat its
servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them. Indeed,
the ‘inside maids’—those who, like Aroma, were m personal attendance on members
of the family (and this was true of all of them, no matter in whose apartment they
were employed) were the crême de la crême of the household staff and were even
regarded as a cut above the free daughters of poorer households outside.
Later, when Bao-yu unexpectedly arrived on the scene and they saw how it was
between him and Aroma, the reason for her reluctance to leave service at once
became apparent. It was a factor they had not foreseen; but now they recognized it,
it is a great weight off their minds, and it was not without feel?ings of relief that they
abandoned all further thought of attempting to purchase her freedom.
But to return to our story.
Since early youth Aroma had always been aware that Bao-yu’s character was peculiar.
His naughtiness and intract?ability exceeded those of normal boys, and in addition
he had a number of extraordinary eccentricities of his own which she could scarcely
even have put a name to. Recently he had taken advantage of the comparative
immunity from parental control, afforded him by the all-encompassing protection of
his doting grandmother, to become even more wild and self-indulgent and even
more confirmed in his aversion to serious pursuits than in previous years, and all her
attempts to remonstrate with him met with the same obstinate unwilling?ness to
hear. Today’s talk about buying her out of service turned out to be providential. By
employing only a minimum of deceit, she could use it as a means of ascertaining his
real feelings towards her and of humbling his spirit a little, so that he might be in a
suitably chastened frame of mind for the lecture with which she was preparing to
admonish him. She judged from his going off silently to bed that he was shaken and a
little unsure of himself. Evidently she had succeeded in the first part of her plan.
Aroma had not really wanted the chestnuts. She had pre?tended to do so because
she was afraid that the matter of the koumiss might blow up into an incident like the
earlier one in?volving Snowpink and the tea. By pretending to want chest?nuts she
had deflected him from pursuing it further. She now told the younger maids to take
them away and eat them themselves, while she went over to rouse up Bao-yu. The
face that he lifted from the pillow was wet with tears.
‘Now what do you want to go upsetting yourself like that for?’ she said with a smile.
‘If you really want me to stay, of course I won’t go.’
Bao-yu at once brightened up.
‘Tell me!’ he said. ‘Tell me what I must do to prove to you how much I want you to
stay, since nothing I say myself seems any good!’
‘I know we’re both fond of each other,’ said Aroma. ‘That doesn’t need any proving.
But if you want to be sure of my staying here, it mustn’t only be because of that.
There are three other things I want to talk to you about. If you will promise to obey
me in all of them, I shall know that you really and truly want me to stay; then nothing
- not even a knife at my throat - will ever make me leave you!’
‘Tell me what they are!’ he said impetuously. ‘I promise to obey you. Dearest
Aroma! Sweetest Aroma! Never mind two or three: I would promise if it were two or
three hundred! All I ask is that you shouldn’t leave me. If the day ever comes when
nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash - no, not ash. Ash has form and
substance and perhaps consciousness too. Say smoke. A puff of thin smoke dissolved
upon the wind. When that is all that remains of me, and you can no longer fuss over
me because there is nothing left to fuss over, and I can no longer pay attention to you
because there is nothing left to pay attention with - when that time comes, you may
go or stay as you please!’
‘My dear young gentleman,’ said Aroma exasperatedly, dapping her hand over his
mouth to prevent him saying any more, ‘it’s precisely this way of carrying on that I
was going to talk to you about, and here you go, ranting away worse than ever!’
‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Right. I promise never to talk that way again.’
‘That was the first thing I wanted you to reform.’
‘I’ve reformed already,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I ever talk that way again, you can pinch my
lips! Then what?’
‘The second thing is this,’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t care whether you really like studying
or not, but even if you don’t, I’d like you at least to pretend that you do when you’re
with the Master or any other gentlemen, and not always be making sarcastic remarks
about it. If you could only put on an appear?ance of liking it, he would have less
cause to be angry with you, and could even take a bit of pride in you when he was
talk?ing to his friends. Look at it from his point of view. Every generation of your
family up to now have been scholars. Then suddenly you come along. Not only do
you hate studying --that’s already enough to make him feel angry and upset -- but on
top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it -- and not only
behind his back but even when he’s there. According to you anyone who studies and
tries to im?prove himself is a “career worm”. According to you the Illumi?nation of
Clear Virtue or whatever it’s called is the only genuine book ever written and all the
rest are forgeries. No wonder the Master gets so angry with you. No wonder he’s
every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a
thrashing.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘All right. I won’t say such things any more. In any case, these are all things I used to
say when I was younger and didn’t know any better. I don’t say things like that
nowadays. What else?’
‘You must leave off forever going on about people’s appearance and interfering
with their make-up—and you must give up that filthy habit of stealing people’s
lipstick and eating it on the sly. That’s most important!’
‘I’ll reform! I’ll reform! Is there anything else, now?’
‘Nothing else, really. Just to be a bit more careful about things in general and not
always letting yourself get carried away by your whims and fancies. But if you will
really keep your promise about these three things I’ve mentioned, I will promise
never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry
me away!’
‘Oh, come now! Isn’t that stretching it a bit?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘For eight
bearers and a handsome husband I bet you’d go!’
‘It wouldn’t interest me in the least,’ said Aroma haughtily. ‘“Kind sir, for such
blessing I am not willing.” Even if I did go, I should take no pleasure in it.’
Their dialogue was interrupted by Ripple, who just at that moment entered the
room.
‘It’s nearly midnight, you two. You ought to be in bed. Her Old Ladyship just now
sent one of the nannies round to ask about you and I told her you were asleep.’
Bao-yu asked for his watch and looked. The hand was pointing to half past eleven. He
washed and cleaned his teeth all over again, and taking off his outer clothes, settled
down once more to sleep.

*

When Aroma got up first thing next morning she felt heavy and unwell. Her head
ached, her eyelids were puffy and her whole body was afire. At first she dragged
herself round per?forming her usual tasks, but eventually she could hold out no
longer and had to lie down fully clothed on the kang. Bao-yu at once informed
Grandmother Jia, who called in a doctor. Having taken Aroma’s pulses, the doctor
informed them that she had ‘merely contracted a severe chill and would be all right
after taking a few doses of medicine to relieve the congestion,’ and left after writing a
prescription. Bao-yu sent out for the materials prescribed, and when they had been
duly boiled up and the first draught taken, made her cover herself with a quilt to
bring on a perspiration. Then he went off to see Dai-yu.
Dai-yu was at that moment taking a midday nap. Her maids had all gone off about
their own affairs. Not a sound could be heard from the inside room As Bao-yu lifted
the embroidered door-curtain and entered, he could see her lying asleep inside and
hurried over to rouse her:
‘Sleeping after you’ve just eaten, coz? That’s bad! Wake up!’
His voice woke her. She opened her eyes and saw that it was Bao-yu.
‘Do go away and play for a bit! I’m so dreadfully tired. I didn’t get any sleep last
night and I haven’t been able to rest until now.’
‘Never mind how tired you are,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You’ll do yourself much more harm by
sleeping after a meal. I’ll’ stay and amuse you to keep you awake if you feel sleepy.’
‘I’m not sleepy, I’m tired. I want to rest for a bit. Can’t you go and amuse yourself
somewhere else for a few minutes and come back later?’
Bao-yu gave her another shake.
‘Where else can I go?’ he said. ‘I’m so bored with everyone else.’
‘Chee-ee-ee!’ Dai-yu exploded in a little laugh. ‘All right. I suppose now you are
here you may as well stay. You can sit very, very quietly over there and we will talk.’
‘I should prefer to lie down,’ said Bao-yu.
‘All right, lie down then!’
‘There isn’t a pillow. We shall have to share yours.’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Look at all those pillows in the next room. Why
don’t you get yourself one of them?’
Bao-yu went into the outer room for a look but came back empty-handed.
‘I don’t want any of them,’ he said genially. ‘How do I know some dirty old woman
hasn’t been sleeping on them?’
Dai-yu opened her eyes very wide.
‘You really are the bane of my life!’ she said. ‘Here, take this!’ She pushed the
pillow she had been lying on towards him and got up to fetch another one of her
own to replace it with. The two of them then reclined, facing each other, at opposite
ends of the bed.
Glancing up from her recumbent position, Dai-yu noticed that there was a blood-spot
about the size of a small button on Bao-yu’s left cheek. She bent over him to examine
it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger.
‘Whose nails was it this time?’
Bao-yu lay back to avoid her scrutiny and laughed.
‘It isn’t a scratch. I’ve just been helping them make rouge. A little of it must have
splashed on to my face.’ He rum?maged for a handkerchief to wipe it off with.
Dai-yu wiped it off with her own, clicking her tongue censoriously as she did so.
‘So you’re up to those tricks again? You might at least refrain from advertising the
fact! Even if Uncle doesn’t see you himself, someone else might who thought it an
amusing story to go around gossiping about. He could easily get to hear about it in
that way, and that would make it unpleasant for all of us.’
But her words were lost on Bao-yu. He was preoccupied with a subtle fragrance
which seemed to emanate from Dai-?yu’s sleeve - a fragrance that intoxicated the
senses and caused one to feel rather limp. He seized hold of the sleeve and
demanded to know what perfume she was wearing.
‘Perfume? At this season?’ said Dai-yu with a laugh. ‘I’m not wearing any. “In the
cold winter none smells sweet”!’
‘Well, where does it come from, then?’
‘I don’t know myself where it comes from,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I suppose it might have
come from the wardrobe.’
Bao-yu shook his head.
‘I doubt it. It’s a very unusual scent. Not the kind you would get from a scent-cake
or a perfume-ball or sachet.’
‘I hope you don’t imagine it’s some exotic perfume given me by the Immortals of
the Isles. Even if I had the recipe, I have no kind elder brother to get together all
those flowers and stamens and things and make it up for me. I have got only the
ordinary, vulgar sorts of perfume!’
‘Whatever I say, you are always dragging in things like that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Very well,
You will have to be taught a lesson. From now on, no mercy!’
Half rising, he pretended to spit on his hands, then stretch?ing them out before him,
began to waggle his fingers up and down in the region of her ribs and armpits. Dai-yu
had always been the most ticklish of mortals, and the mere sight of his waggling
fingers sent her off into shrieks of laughter which soon ended in breathlessness:
‘Oh! Oh! Bao-yu! No! Stop! I’ll be angry!’
‘Will you say things like that any more?’
‘No,’ said Dai-yu, laughing weakly, ‘I promise.’
She proceeded to pat her hair into place, smilingly com?placently:
‘So I’ve got an unusual fragrance, have I? Have you got a warm fragrance?’
For the moment Bao-yu was puzzled:
‘Warm fragrance?’
Dai-yu shook her head pityingly.
‘Don’t be so dense! You have your jade. Somebody has a gold thing to match.
Somebody has Cold Fragrance, ergo you must have Warm Fragrance to go with it!’
‘I’ve only just let you off,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and here you go again, worse than ever!’
Once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and Dai-yu again began to shriek.
‘No! Bao-yu! Please! I promise!’
‘All right, I forgive you. But you must let me smell your sleeve.’
He wrapped the free end of that garment over his face and abandoned himself to
long and prodigious sniffs.
Dai-yu jerked away her arm.
‘I really think you ought to go.’
‘Couldn’t go if I wanted to. Let’s lie down very quietly and genteelly and have a
conversation.’ And he stretched himself out again.
Dai-yu lay down too, and covered her face with a handker?chief.
He tried to arouse her interest with desultory chat—talking for the sake of talking.
Dai-yu took no notice. He tried asking questions. How old was she when she first
came to the Capital? What had the scenery been like on the journey? What places of
historical interest were there in Yangchow? What were its inhabitants like? What
were its local customs? Dai-yu made no reply. Still concerned that she might fail
asleep and injure her health, he tried a ruse.
‘Why, yes!’ he said, as if suddenly remembering something. ‘There’s a famous story
that took place near Yangchow. I wonder if you know about it.’
This was delivered with so straight a face and in so serious a tone of voice that Dai-yu
was quite taken in.
‘Oh? What?’
Mastering a strong inclination to laugh, he began to extemporize with whatever
came into his head.
‘Near the city of Yangchow there is a mountain called Mt Yu-dai, in the side of
which is a cavern called the Cave of Lin.’
‘That’s false, for a start,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ve never heard of a mountain of that name.’
‘There are a great many mountains in this world,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You could hardly be
expected to know all of them. Leave your criticisms until I have finished my story.’
‘Carry on,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Now in the Cave of Lin there lived a tribe of magic mice, and one year, on the
seventh day of the last month, the Oldest Mouse climbed up on to his throne and sat
in council with the rest of the tribe.
‘“Tomorrow is Nibbansday,” he said, “and everywhere in the world of men they will
be cooking frumenty. Since our cave is at present short of dry provender, we should
take this opportunity of replenishing our stores by raiding theirs.” He took a
ceremonial arrow from the receptacle in front of him and handing it to an able
younger mouse, instructed him to carry out a reconnaissance. In due course the Able
Younger Mouse came back and reported that, though he had looked positively
everywhere, there were nowhere more plentiful stores to be found than in the
temple at the foot of the mountain.
“‘How many kinds of grain have they got there, and how many sorts of dried
fruits?” the Oldest Mouse asked him.
‘“There is a whole granary full of rice and beans,” replied the Able Younger Mouse,
“but only five kinds of dried fruits:
the first,       red dates
the second,       chestnut
the third,        peanuts
the fourth,       caltrops
the fifth,         sweet potatoes
‘The Oldest Mouse was highly delighted, and picked up another arrow, he said,
“Who will go to steal rice?”
‘A mouse at once took the arrow and went off to steal rice.’
“Who will go to steal beans?” he asked, picking up another arrow.
‘Another mouse took the arrow and went off to steal beans.’ One by one they
departed on their missions until only the sweet potatoes had still to be arranged for.
‘The Oldest Mouse took up another arrow.’
‘“Who will go to steal sweet potatoes?”
‘A little puny, weak mouse replied,
‘ “I will!”

‘Seeing how young and puny he was, the Oldest Mouse and the other members of
the mousey tribe feared that he would be too lacking in training and experience and
too timid and weak to carry out the task, and refused to let him go. But the little
mouse said,
“‘Although I am young in years and weak in body, I am eloquent and resourceful
and possess unlimited magic powers. I can guarantee to carry out this mission even
more ex?peditiously than the rest.”
“‘How will you do that?” asked the other mice.
“‘I shan’t rush at the job head-on like the others,” said the little mouse. “By just
giving my body a couple of shakes I shall change myself into a sweet potato; I shall
roll myself into the pile of sweet potatoes without anyone seeing me; then --very,
very gently I shall roll the sweet potatoes away, one by one, until there aren’t any
more left. Isn’t that a more ex?peditious way of doing it than the crude and headlong
approach which the others have adopted?”
“That’s all very well,” said the other mice, “but what about this transformation
business? Let’s see you do it first!”
‘“Nothing easier!” said the little mouse with a confident smile. “Watch!”
‘He gave his body a couple of shakes.
‘“Hey presto!”
‘And at once he turned into the most exquisitely beautiful young lady.
‘The other mice all laughed.
‘“No, no, no, you’ve made a mistake! That’s not a sweet potato, that’s a young lady
you’ve turned into!”
‘The little mouse resumed his own shape and smiled at them pityingly.
‘“It is you who are mistaken. You have seen too little of the world to understand.
The vegetable tuber is not the only kind of sweet potato. The daughter of our
respected Salt Commis?sioner Lin is also a sweet potato. She is the sweetest sweet
potato of them all.”’
Dai-yu got up on her knees and, crawling over, planted herself on top of Bao-yu.
‘I’ll teach you to make fun of me, you hateful creature! I’ll teach you!’
She seized his lips between thumb and finger and began to pinch and shake them.
‘Help!’ cried Bao-yu. ‘Mercy! I won’t do it again! It was smelling your beautiful
perfume that put me in mind of the allusion.’
‘Allusion?’ said Dai-yu. ‘You vilify someone else and then call it an allusion?’
Just at that moment Bao-chai walked in.
‘Who’s this talking about allusions? I must hear this!’
Dai-yu invited her to sit down.
‘Look! Who else would you expect it to be? He says a lot of horrid things about me
and then tells me it’s an allusion!’
‘Oh,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Bao I’m not surprised, then. He is full of allusions. The
only trouble is that he tends to forget them at the very moment when they are most
needed. If he can remember allusions today, he ought to have been able to
remember that allusion about the plantain the other night. But no, it just wouldn’t
come, and though everyone else was dying of cold, he was perspiring! Yet now his
memory has come back again. Strange!’
‘Now praised be!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have a nice, kind cousin to stick up for me. You’ve
met your match now,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘Now you are going to get as good as you
give! Now we shall see you paid in your own coin!’
Their conversation was interrupted by a burst of angry shouting from the direction of
Bao-yu’s room.
The occasion of it will be discussed in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 20



Wang Xi-feng castigates a jealous attitude
with some forthright speaking
And Lin Dai-yu makes a not unattractive speech
impediment the subject of a jest



We have shown how Bao-yu was in Dai-yu’s room telling her the story of the magic
mice; how Bao-chai burst in on them and twitted Bao-yu with his failure to
remember the ‘green wax’ allusion on the night of the Lantern Festival; and how the
three of them sat teasing each other with good-humoured banter.
Bao-yu had been afraid that by sleeping after her meal Dai-yu would give herself
indigestion or suffer from insomnia through being insufficiently tired when she went
to bed at night, but Bao-chai’s arrival and the lively conversation that followed it
banished all Dai-yu’s desire to sleep and enabled him to lay aside his anxiety on her
behalf.
Just then a sudden commotion arose from the direction of Bao-yu’s room, and the
three of them stopped talking and turned their heads to listen. Dai-yu was the first to
speak:
‘That’s your Nannie quarrelling with Aroma,’ she said. ‘To think how that poor girl
goes out of her way to be nice to the old woman, yet still she manages to find fault
with her! She really must be getting senile.’
Bao-yu was for rushing over straight away, but Bao-chai restrained him:
‘Don’t go quarrelling with your Nannie, whatever you do! She’s only a silly old
woman. You have to indulge her a bit.’
‘Of course,’ said Bao-yu and ran off.
He found Nannie Li leaning on her stick in the middle of the room abusing Aroma.:
‘Ungrateful little baggage! After all I’ve done for you—and now when I come to call
on you, you lie back there on the kang like a young madam and haven’t even the
grace to look up and take notice of me! You and your airs and graces! All you ever
think about is how to win Bao-yu over to you. Thanks to you he won’t listen to me
any more. He only does what you say. To think that a cheap bit of goods like you that
they only paid a few taels of silver for should come along here and turn the whole
place upside down! The best thing they could do with you would be to marry you off
to one of the boys and send you packing. Then we’d see how you managed to play
the siren and lead young gentlemen astray!’
Aroma at first thought that Nannie Li’s anger arose solely on account of her failure to
get up and welcome her, and had started to excuse herself on that supposition:
‘I’m ill, Mrs Li. I’ve just been sweating. I didn’t see you because I had my head
under the clothes.’
But when the old woman proceeded to go on about leading young men astray and
marrying her off to a servant and what not, she felt wronged and humiliated, and in
spite of her efforts to restrain them, burst into tears of sheer helplessness.
Bao-yu had heard all this, and though too embarrassed to argue, could scarcely
refrain from saying a word or two in Aroma’s defence:
‘She’s ill. She’s having to take medicine,’ he said. ‘If you don’t believe me, ask any of
the maids.’
This made the old woman even angrier.
‘Oh yes! You stick up for the little hussies! You don’t care about me any more! And
which of them am I supposed to ask, pray? They will all take your side against me.
You are all under Aroma’s thumb, every one of you. I know what goes on here, don’t
think I don’t! Well, you can come along with me to see Her Old Ladyship and Her
Ladyship about this. Let them heat how you have cast me off—me that reared you at
my own breast—now that you don’t need my milk any more, and how you encourage
a pack of snotty-nosed little maidservants to amuse themselves at my expense!’
She was in tears herself by now, and wept as she cursed.
By this time Dai-yu and Bao-chai had also arrived on the scene and did their best to
calm her:
‘Come, Nannie! Be a bit more forbearing with them! Try to forget about it!’
Nannie Li turned towards this new audience and proceeded to pour out her troubles
in an interminable gabble in which tea and Snowpink and drinking koumiss mingled
incoherently.
Xi-feng happened to be in Grandmother Jia’s room totting up the day’s scores for the
final settlement when she heard this hubbub in the rear apartment. She identified it
immediately as Nannie Li on the rampage once more, taking out on Bao-yu’s
unfortunate maids some of the spleen occasioned by her recent gambling losses. At
once she hurried over, seized Nannie Li by the hand, and admonished her with
smiling briskness:
‘Now, Nannie, we mustn’t lose our tempers! This is the New Year holiday and Her
Old Ladyship has been enjoying herself all day. A person of your years ought to be
stopping other people from quarrelling, not upsetting Her Old Lady?ship by
quarrelling yourself. Surely you know better than that? If anyone has been
misbehaving, you have only to tell me and I’ll have them beaten for you. Now I’ve got
a nice hot pheasant stew in my room. You just come along with me and you shall
have some of that and a drink to go with it!’
She proceeded to haul her off the premises, addressing a few words over her
shoulder to her maid Felicity as she went:
‘Felicity, bring Nannie’s stick for her, there’s a good girl! And for goodness’ sake give
her a handkerchief to wipe her eyes with!’
Unable to hold her ground, the old Nannie was borne off in Xi-feng’s wake, muttering
plaintively as she went:
‘I wish I was dead, I really do! But I’d sooner forget myself and make a scene like I
have today and be shamed in front of you all than put up with the insolence of those
shameless little baggages!’
Watching this sudden exit, Bao-chai and Dai-yu laughed and clapped their hands:
‘How splendid! Just the sort of wind we needed to blow the old woman away!’
But Bao-yu shook his head and sighed:
‘I wonder what had really upset her. Obviously she only picked on Aroma because
she is weak and can’t defend herself. I wonder which of the girls had offended her to
make her so .
He was interrupted by Skybright:
‘Why should any of us want to upset her? Do you think we’re mad? And even if we
had offended her, we should be perfectly capable of owning up to it and not letting
someone else take the blame!’
Aroma grasped Bao-yu’s hand and wept:
‘Because I offended one old nurse, you have to go offending a whole roomful of
people. Don’t you think there’s been enough trouble already without dragging other
people into it?’
Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her
condition, Bao-yu stifled his indig?nation and did his best to comfort her so that she
might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever. Her
skin was burning to the touch. He decided to stay with her for a while, and lying
down beside her, spoke to her soothingly:
‘Just try to get better, now! Never mind all that other nonsense! It’s of no
importance.’
Aroma smiled bitterly.
‘If I had allowed myself to get upset about things like that, I shouldn’t have lasted in
this room for five minutes! Still, if we’re always going to have this sort of trouble, I
think in the long run I just shan’t be able to stand any more. You don’t seem to
realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you’ve forgotten all
about it. But they haven’t. It’s all scored up against me; and as soon as something
goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it
so unpleasant for all of us.’
She cried weakly as she said this, but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting
Bao-yu.
Soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of Aroma’s medicine.
Bao-yu could see that she had started sweating again and told her not to get up,
holding the medicine for her himself and supporting her while she drank it. Then he
told one of the junior maids to make up a bed for her on the kang.
‘Whether you’re going to eat there or not,’ Aroma said to him, ‘you’d better go and
sit with Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship for a bit and play a while with the young
ladies before you come back here again. I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my
own.’
Bao-yu thought he had better do as she said, and after wait?ing until she had taken
off her ornaments and was lying tucked up in bed, he went to the front apartment
and took his dinner with Grandmother Jia.
After dinner Grandmother Jia wanted to go on playing cards with some of the old
stewardesses. Bao-yu, still worrying about Aroma, returned to his own room, where
he found her sleeping fitfully. He thought of going to bed himself, but it was still too
early. Skybright, Mackerel, Ripple and Emerald had gone off in quest of livelier
entertainment, hoping to persuade Grandmother Jia’s maids, Faithful and Amber, to
loin them in a game. Only Musk was left in the outer room, playing Patience under
the lamp with a set of dominoes. Bao-yu smiled at her.
‘Why don’t you go off to loin the others?’
‘I haven’t got any money.’
‘There’s a great pile of money under the bed. Isn’t that enough for you to lose?’
‘If we all went off to play,’ said Musk, ‘who would look after this room? There’s her
sick inside. And lamps and stoves burning everywhere. The old women were
practically dead on their feet after waiting on you all day; I had to let them go and
rest. And the girls have been on duty all day, too. You could scarcely grudge them
some time off now for amusement.—Which leaves only me to look after the place.’
‘Another Aroma,’ thought Bao-yu to himself and gave her another smile.
‘I’ll sit here while you’re away. There’s nothing to worry about here if you’d like to
go.’
‘There’s even less excuse for going if you are here,’ said Musk. ‘Why can’t we both
sit here and talk?’
‘What can we do?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just sitting here talking is going to be rather dull. I
know! You were saying this morning that your head was itchy. As you haven’t got
anything else to do now, I’ll comb it for you.’
‘All right,’ said Musk, and fetching her toilet-box with the mirror on top she
proceeded to take off her ornaments and shake her hair out. Bao-yu took a comb and
began to comb it for her. But he had not drawn it more than four or five times
through her hair, when Skybright came bursting in to get some more money. Seeing
the two of them together, she smiled sarcastically:
‘Fancy! Doing her hair already-- before you’ve even drunk the marriage-cup!’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Come here! I’ll do yours for you too, if you like!’
‘I wouldn’t presume, thanks all the same!’
She took the money, and with a swish of the door-blind was gone.
Bao-yu was standing behind Musk as she sat looking at her?self in the mirror. Their
eyes met in the glass and they both laughed.
‘Of all the girls in this room she has the sharpest tongue,’ said Bao-yu.
Musk signalled to him agitatedly in the glass with her hand. Bao-yu took her meaning;
but it was too late. With another swish of the door-blind, Skybright had already
darted in again.
‘Oh! Sharp-tongued, am I? Perhaps you’d like to say a bit more on that subject?’
‘Get along with you!’ laughed Musk. ‘Don’t go starting any more arguments!’
‘And don’t you go sticking up for him!’ said Skybright gaily. ‘I know what you’re up
to, you two. You don’t deceive me with your goings-on. I’ll have something to say to
you about this when I get back later. Just wait until I’ve won some of my money
back!’
With that she darted off once more.
When Bao-yu had finished combing her hair, he asked Musk to help him get to
bed—very quietly, so as not to disturb Aroma.
And that ends our account of that day.

*

First thing next morning Aroma awoke to find that she had sweated heavily during
the night and that her body felt very much lighter; but she would take only a little
congee for breakfast in order not to tax her system too soon. Bao-yu saw that there
was no further cause for concern, and after his meal drifted off to Aunt Xue’s
apartment in search of amusement.
Now this was the prime of the year, when the schoolroom is closed for the New Year
holiday and the use of the needle is forbidden to maidenly fingers throughout the
whole of the Lucky Month, so that boys and girls alike are all agreeably un?employed,
and Bao-yu’s half-brother Jia Huan, on holiday like all the rest, had also drifted over
to Aunt Xue’s place in search of amusement. He found Bao-chai, Caltrop and Oriole
there playing a game of Racing Go, and after watching them for a bit, wanted to play
too.
Bao-chai had always behaved towards Jia Huan in exactly the same way as she did
towards Bao-yu and made no distinc?tions between them. Consequently, when he
asked to play, she at once made a place for him and invited him to join them on the
kang. They played for stakes of ten cash each a game. Jia Huan won the first game
and felt very pleased. But then, as luck would have it, he lost several times in a row
and began to get somewhat rattled.
It was now his turn to throw the dice. He needed seven to win, and if he threw
anything less than seven, the dice would go next to Oriole, who needed only three.
He hurled them from the pot with all his might. One of them rested at two. The other
continued rather erratically to roll about. ‘Ace! Ace! Ace!’ cried Oriole, clapping her
hands. ‘Six! Seven! Eight!’ shouted Jia Huan glaring at Oriole and commanding the
die to perform the impossible. But the perverse wanderer finally came to rest with
the ace uppermost, making a grand total of three. With the speed of desperation Jia
Huan reached out and snatched it up, claiming, as he did so, that it was a six.
‘It was an ace,’ said Oriole, ‘as plain as anything!’
Bao-chai could see that Jia Huan was rattled, and darting a sharp look at Oriole,
commanded her to yield.
‘You grow more unmannerly every day,’ she told her. ‘Surely you don’t think one of
the masters would cheat you? Come on! Put your money down!’
Oriole smarted with the injustice of this, but her mistress had ordered it, so she had
to pay up without arguing. She could not, however, forbear a few rebellious
mutterings:
‘Huh! One of the masters! Cheating a maid out of a few coppers! Even I should be
ashamed! Look how much money Bao-yu lost when he was playing with us the other
day, yet he didn’t mind. Even when some of the maids took all he had left, he only
laughed...’
She would have gone on, but Bao-chai checked her angrily. ‘How can I hope to
compete with Bao-yu?’ said Jia Huan, beginning to blubber. ‘You’re all afraid of him.
You all take his part against me because I’m only a concubine’s son.’
Bao-chai was shocked:
‘Please don’t say things like that, Cousin! You’ll make your?self ridiculous.’
Once more she rebuked Oriole.
Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in, and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in,
asked him what was the matter. But Jia Huan dared not say anything.
Bao-chai, familiar with the state of affairs, normal in other families, which places the
younger brother in fearful subjec?tion to the elder, assumed that Jia Huan was afraid
of Bao-yu. She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of
him. ‘We are both equally subject to our parents’ control,’ he would say of himself
and Jia Huan. ‘Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control
him myself - especially when I am the wife’s son and he is the concubine’s? People
already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if
I were to start bossing him about.’
But’ there was another, zanier, notion which contributed to this attitude. Let us try to
explain it. Bao-yu had from early youth grown up among girls. There were his sisters
Yuan?-chun and Tan-chun, his cousins of the same surname Ying?-chun and Xi-chun,
and his distaff-cousins Shi Xiang-yun, Lin Dai-yu and Xue Bao-chai. As a result of this
upbringing, he had come to the conclusion that the pure essence of human?ity was
all concentrated in the female of the species and that males were its mere dregs and
off-scourings. To him, there?fore, all members of his own sex without distinction
were brutes who might just as well not have existed. Only in the case of his father,
uncles and brother, where rudeness and dis?obedience were expressly forbidden by
the teachings of Confucius, did he make an exception—and even then the allowances
he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory. It certainly
never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set
an example to the younger males in his clan. The latter—Jia Huan
included—reciprocated with a healthy disrespect only slightly tempered by their fear
of his doting grandmother.
But Bao-chai was ignorant of ail this; and fearing that Bao-yu might embarrass them
all by delivering a big brother’s telling-off, she hastened to Jia Huan’s defence.
‘What are you crying about in the middle of the New Year holidays?’ said Bao-yu to
Jia Huan, ignoring Bao-chai’s excuses. ‘If you don’t like it here, why don’t you go
somewhere else? I think your brains must have been addled by too much study. Can’t
you see that if there is something you don’t like, there must be something else you
do like, and that all you’ve got to do is leave the one and go after the other? Not
hang on to it and cry. Crying won’t make it any better. You came here to enjoy
yourself, didn’t you? And now you’re here you re miserable, right? Then the thing to
do is to go somewhere else, isn’t it?’
In the face of such an argument, Jia Huan could not very well remain
When he got back to his own apartment, his real mother, ‘Aunt’ Zhao (Lady Wang
was his mother only in name) observed the dejected state he was in.
‘Who’s been making a doormat of you this time?’ she asked him, and, obtaining no
immediate reply, asked again.
‘I’ve just been playing at Bao-chai’s. Oriole cheated me and Bao-yu turned me out.’
Aunt Zhao spat contemptuously:
‘Nasty little brat! That’s what comes of getting above yourself. Who asked you to go
playing with that lot? You could have gone anywhere else to play. Asking for trouble!’
Just at that moment Xi-feng happened to be passing by outside, and hearing what
she said, shouted back at her through the window:
‘What sort of language is that to be using in the middle of the New Year holiday?
He’s only a child. He hasn’t done any?thing terrible. What do you want to go carrying
on at him like that for? No matter where he’s been, Sir Zheng and Lady Wang are
quite capable of looking after him themselves. There’s no cause for you to go biting
his head off! After all, he is one of the masters. If he’s misbehaved himself, you
should leave the telling-off to those whose job it is. It’s no business of yours. Huan!
Come out here! Come and play with me!’
Jia Huan had always been afraid of Xi-feng - more even than he was of Lady
Wang—and hearing her call him, came running out immediately. Aunt Zhao dared
not say a word.
‘You’re a poor-spirited creature!’ Xi-feng said to him. ‘How many times have I told
you that you can eat and drink and play with any of the boys and girls you like? But
instead of doing as I say, you hang about with these other people and let them warp
your mind for you and fill it up with mischief. You’ve no self-respect, that’s your
trouble. Can’t keep away from the gutter. You insist on making yourself disagreeable
and then you complain that people are prejudiced against you! Fancy making a fuss
like that about losing a few coppers! How much did you lose?’
‘One or two hundred,’ Jia Huan muttered abjectly.
‘All this fuss about one or two hundred cash! And you one of the masters!’ She
turned to Felicity. ‘Go and get a string of cash for him, Felicity, and take him round to
the back where Miss Ying and the girls are playing! And if I have anymore of this
nonsense from you in future, young man,’ she went on to Jia Huan, ‘I’ll first give you
a good hiding myself and then send someone to tell the school about you and see if
they can knock a bit of sense into you! It sets your Cousin Lan’s teeth on edge to see
you so wanting in self-respect. He’d have dis?-embowelled you by now I shouldn’t
wonder, if I hadn’t kept his hands off you! Now be off with you!’
‘Yes,’ said Jia Huan meekly and went off with Felicity. When he had got his money,
he took himself off to play with Ying-chun and the girls.
And there we must leave him.

*

While Bao-yu was enjoying himself with Bao-chai, a servant announced that Miss Shi
had arrived, and he hurriedly got up to go.
‘Wait!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let’s go and see her together!’ She got down from the kang
as she said this, and accom?panied him round to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. Shi
Xiang-yun was already there, laughing and chattering away nineteen to the dozen,
but rose to greet them as they entered. Dai-yu was there too.
‘Where have you been?’ she asked Bao-yu.
‘Bao-chai’s.’
‘I see’ (very frostily). ‘I thought something must have been detaining you.
Otherwise you would have come flying here long since.’
‘Is one only allowed to play with you,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and keep you amused? I just
happened to be visiting her. Why should you start making remarks like that?’
‘How thoroughly disagreeable you are!’ said Dai-yu. ‘What do I care whether you
go to see her or not? And I’m sure I never asked to be kept amused. From now on
you can ignore me completely, as far as I’m concerned.’
With that she went back to her own room in a temper.
Bao-yu came running after.
‘What on earth are you upset about this time? Even if I’ve said anything wrong, you
ought, out of simple courtesy, to sit and talk with the others for a bit!’
‘Are you telling me how to behave?’
‘Of course not. It’s just that you destroy your health by carrying on in this way.’
‘That’s my affair. If I choose to die, I don’t see that it’s any concern of yours.’
‘Oh, really, really! Here we are in the middle of the New Year holiday, and you have
to start talking about death!’
‘I don’t care. I’ll talk about death if I like. Death! Death! Death! I’m going to die this
minute. If you’re so afraid of death, I wish you long life. A hundred years, will that
satisfy you?’
‘Do you think I’m afraid of dying when all you will do is quarrel? I wish I were dead.
It would be a relief.’
‘Exactly! ‘said Dai-yu. ‘if I were to die, it would be a relief from all this quarrelling!’
‘I said if I were to die,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t twist my words. It isn’t fair.’
Just then Bao-chai came hurrying in.
‘Cousin Shi’s waiting for you!’
She took hold of Bao-yu’s hand and pulled him after her, to the great mortification of
Dai-yu, who sat with her face to the window and shed tears bf pure rage.
After about as long as it would take to drink two cups of tea, Bao-yu came back again.
During his absence Dai-yu’s sobs seemed to have redoubled in intensity. Seeing the
state she was in he realized that it would need careful handling and began turning
over in his mind all kinds of soft and soothing things to coax her with. But before he
could get his mouth open, she had anticipated him:
‘What have you come for this time? Why can’t you just leave me here to die in
peace? After all, you’ve got a new play?mate now - one who can read and write and
compose and laugh and talk to you much better than I can. Oh yes, and drag you off
to be amused if there’s any danger of your getting upset! I really can’t imagine what
you have come back here for!’
‘“Old friends are best friends and close kin are kindest,”’said Bao-yu, coming over
to where she sat and speaking very quietly. ‘You’re too intelligent not to know that.
Even a simpleton like me knows that much! Take kinship first: you are my cousin on
Father’s side; Cousin Bao is only a mother-cousin. That makes you much the closer
kin. And as for length of acquaintance: it was you who came here first. You and I have
practically grown up together—eaten at the same table, even slept in the same bed.
Compared with you she’s practi?cally a new arrival. Why should I ever be any less
dose to you because of her?’
‘Whatever do you take me for? Do you think I want you to be any less close to her
because of me? It’s the way I feel that makes me the way I am.’
‘And it’s the way I feel,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that makes me the way I am! Do you mean to
tell me that you know your own feelings about me but still don’t know what my
feelings are about you?’
Dai-yu lowered her head and made no reply. After a pause she said:
‘You complain that whatever you do people are always getting angry with you. You
don’t seem to realize how much you provoke them by what you do. Take today, for
instance. It’s obviously colder today than it was yesterday. Then why of all days
should you choose today to leave your blue cape off?’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘I didn’t. I was wearing it this morning the same as usual; but when you started
quarrelling just now, I got into such a sweat that I had to take it off.’
‘Next thing you’ll be catching a cold,’ said Dai-yu with a sigh, ‘and then Heaven
knows what grumblings and scoldings there will be!’
Just then Xiang-yun burst in on them and reproved them smilingly for abandoning
her:
‘Couthin Bao, Couthin Lin: you can thee each other every day. It’th not often I get a
chanthe to come here; yet now I have come, you both ignore me!’
Dai-yu burst out laughing:
‘Lisping doesn’t seem to make you any less talkative! Listen to you: “Couthin!”
“Couthin!” Presently, when you’re play?ing Racing Go, you’ll be all “thicktheth” and
“theventh”!’
‘You’d better not imitate her,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’ll get to be a habit. You’ll be lisping
yourself before you know where you are.’
‘How you do pick on one!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Always find?ing fault. Even if you are tho
perfect yourthelf, I don’t thee why you have to go making fun of everyone elthe. But I
can show you thomeone you won’t dare to find fault with. I shall certainly think you a
wonder if you do.’
‘Who’s that?’ said Dai-yu
‘If you can find any shortcomings in Cousin Bao-chai’, said Xiang-yun, ‘you must be
very good indeed.’
‘Oh her,’ said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I wondered whom you could mean. I should never dare
to find fault with her.’
But before she could say any more, Bao-yu cut in and hurriedly changed the subject.
‘I shall never be a match for you as long as I live,’ Xiang?-yun said to Dai-yu with a
disarming smile. ‘All I can thay ith that I hope you marry a lithping huthband, tho that
you have “ithee-withee” “ithee-withee” in your earth every minute of the day. Ah,
Holy Name! I think I can thee that blethed day already before my eyeth!’
Bao-yu could not help laughing; but Xiang-yun had already turned and fled.
If you wish to know the conclusion of this scene, you must read the following
chapter.




CHAPTER 21
Righteous Aroma discovers how to rebuke her
master by saying nothing
And artful Patience is able to rescue hers by being
somewhat less than truthful

As Shi Xiang-yun, fearful that Dai-yu would pursue her, turned and fled, Bao-yu
shouted after her: ‘She’s tripped: you needn’t worry! She’ll never catch up with you
now!’
And when Dai-yu reached the doorway where he was standing, he spread his arms
across it to stop her getting by and laughingly begged an amnesty for Xiang-yun.
‘Never!’ said Dai-yu, endeavouring to tug one of his hands away from the
door-jamb. ‘I’ll get that Yun if it’s the last thing I do!’
With Bao-yu blocking the doorway and Dai-yu evidently unable to get past him,
Xiang-yun deemed it safe to stop running, and turned to plead with her pursuer:
‘Pleathe cousin, just this once — spare me!’
Just then Bao-chai appeared from behind her shoulder — the smiling peacemaker:
‘I advise you two to make it up, for Cousin Bao’s sake.’
‘I won’t!’ said Dai-yu. ‘You’re all in league against me. You have all come here to
make fun of me.’
‘Oh, really!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who would ever have the nerve to make fun of you? Yun
only said what she said because you mimicked her in the first place. She’d never have
dared to otherwise.’
It is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse
had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in
Grandmother Jia’s room. It was already lighting-up time and Lady Wang, Li Wan,
Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had also forgathered for the meal. When
dinner was over, the company conversed for a while and then retired to their various
rooms for the night—Xiang-yun to sleep with Dai-yu in what had once, in the days
when she lived with Grandmother Jia, been her own bedroom. Bao-yu saw the two
of them back to their room and stayed there talking until well after ten, in spite of
frequent summonses by Aroma.
As soon as it was light next morning, Bao-yu was off again to the girls’ room, shuffling
along in his slippers and with a gown thrown loosely round his shoulders. The maids
Night?ingale and Kingfisher were not yet about, and their two young mistresses still
lay fast asleep under the covers. Dai-yu was tightly cocooned in a quilt of
apricot-coloured damask, the picture of tranquil repose Xiang-yun, by contrast, lay
with her hank of jet-black hair tumbled untidily beside the pillow, a white arm with
its two gold bracelets thrown carelessly out?side the bedding and two white
shoulders exposed above the peach-pink coverlet, which barely reached her armpits.
‘A tomboy, even in her sleep!’ Bao-yu muttered ruefully as he gently drew the
bedding up to cover her. ‘She’ll get a draught on those shoulders, and next thing
she’ll be complain?ing of a stiff neck!’
Dai-yu had by now awakened. She sensed that there was someone else in the room,
and guessing that it must be Bao-yu, lifted her head up to look. Sure enough, it was
he.
‘What are you doing here at this early hour?’
‘Early? Get up and have a look and then tell me if you think it’s early!’
‘You’d better go outside a minute if you want us to get up,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-yu went into the outer room. Dai-yu got up as soon as he had gone out and
roused Xiang-yun. When the two girls had slipped into some clothes, Bao-yu came
inside again and sat himself down beside the dressing-table. Presently Night?ingale
and Kingfisher came in to help the girls with their toilet. Xiang-yun finished washing
first. Kingfisher was on her way out to empty the basin, when Bao-yu called her back:
‘Just a moment! While you are about it I may as well wash too and save myself the
trouble of going back to my own room.’
He came over to where she stood, and bending his head down over the basin,
scooped up two handfuls of water and began washing his face. Nightingale handed
him some scented soap.
‘It’s all right,’ he said, ‘there’s lots in here already.’
Then he asked for a towel.
Kingfisher pursed her lips up derisively:
‘You haven’t changed much, have you?’
Ignoring the sarcasm, he demanded crude salt to clean his teeth with, and after
rubbing it all round them vigorously with a finger, he rinsed his mouth out with water.
That part of his toilet completed, he observed that Xiang-yun had just finished doing
her hair and wandered over to where she was sitting.
‘Coz dear, do my hair for me, will you?’
‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Xiang-yun.
Bao-yu smiled coaxingly:
‘Go on, be a dear! You used to do it for me once.’
‘Well, I can’t any longer,’ said Xiang-yun. I’ve forgotten how to.’
‘It doesn’t need very much doing to it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m not going out anywhere
today. Just a few plaits.’
He continued to coax and wheedle until at last she gave in, and taking his head in her
hands, sat him down in her place at the dressing-table and proceeded to comb and
dress his hair.
Bao-yu never wore any head-covering when he was at home. Instead he had his
side-hair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears
and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the
back. It was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular
intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head. As Xiang-yun plaited, she
noticed that a pearl appeared to be missing.
‘What’s happened to this clip?’ she said. ‘I’m sure it used to be the same as the
other three. Where has its pearl gone?’
‘I lost it,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I expect it fell off somewhere outside and somebody picked it up,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Lucky old somebody!’
‘Who knows whether or not he really lost it?’ said Dai-yu scoffingly. ‘For all we
know he may have given it to someone to have remounted as a keepsake!’
Bao-yu made no comment, but sat fiddling with the toilet articles that crowded the
dressing-table on either side of the mirror. He picked up a pot of rouge, almost
without realizing what he was doing, and sat with it poised in his hand, wanting to
put it to his lips for a little taste, but afraid Xiang-yun would rebuke him. While he
hesitated, Xiang-yun leaned forward from where she was sitting and administered a
sharp slap to his hand, causing the rouge-pot to fall from it on to the dressing-table.
‘Nathty habit!’ she said. ‘It’s time you gave it up!’
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Aroma entered. She concluded from
the scene that met her eyes that Bao-yu had already completed his toilet, and went
back again to attend to her own. Soon after this Bao-chai dropped in.
‘Where’s Cousin Bao?’ she asked.
‘ “Cousin Bao” has no time to spend in here nowadays,’ said Aroma bitterly.
Bao-chai immediately understood.
Aroma sighed.
‘I say nothing against being friendly,’ she said. ‘But this hanging around there
morning, noon and night is another matter. However, nothing I say makes any
difference. It’s just a waste of breath.’
Bao-chai was impressed.
‘One mustn’t underestimate this maid,’ she thought to her?self. ‘She is obviously a
girl of some intelligence.’
And she sat down on the kang with her for a chat. In the course of conversation she
inquired casually about her age, family, and various other personal matters, paying
careful attention to her answers and gaining from them and from the tone in which
they were uttered an increasing respect for this uneducated maid.
Presently Bao-yu came in, whereupon Bao-chai got up and left. Bao-yu commented
on her departure:
‘Cousin Bao-chai seemed to be very thick with you just now. Why should she
suddenly rush off when I come into the room?’
There was no reply, so he repeated his question.
‘Are you asking me?’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t know what reasons you all have for your
comings and goings.’
The expression on her face as she uttered these words was angrier than he had ever
seen her look before.
He laughed.
‘Oh dear! Are you in a rage again?’
Aroma laughed mirthlessly.
‘It’s not for the likes of me to get into rages. But I wish that from now on you would
stop coming into this room. After all, you have got people to wait on you elsewhere.
You don’t really need my services. I shall go back to serving Her Old Ladyship, like I
used to before.’
With that she closed her eyes and lay back upon the kang.
Bao-yu was alarmed to see her in such a state and impulsively rushed over to the
kang to soothe her. But Aroma kept her eyes tightly shut and would take no notice.
Bao-yu did not know what to do. Just then Musk chanced to enter and he turned to
her for help:
‘What’s up with Aroma?’
‘How should I know?’ said Musk. ‘You’d do better to ask yourself that question.’
Bao-yu was so taken aback that for a while he said nothing. Then, finding their
combined hostility too much for him, he got up with a sigh from his suppliant
position on the kang.
‘All right, ignore me then! I’m going off to sleep, too.’
And he slid from the kang and went off to his own bed to lie down.
For a long time there was no sound from him except for a gentle snoring. Judging
that he must be really asleep, Aroma rose from the kang and took a large
travelling-cloak to cover him with. A moment later she heard a gentle thud. He had
whipped it from him and thrown it to the floor as soon as her back was turned. But
when she looked, his eyes were closed as before and he was still pretending to be
asleep. The significance of the gesture did not escape her. She nodded slowly and
regarded the feigned sleeper sarcastically:
‘All right, then! There’s no need for you to get angry. From now on I’ll just pretend
I’m dumb. I won’t say another word of criticism. Will that satisfy you?’
This was too much for Bao-yu. He sat bolt upright on his bed.
‘What am I supposed to have done this time? And what’s all this “criticism” you’re
talking about? If you had been criticizing me it wouldn’t be so bad; but when I came
in just now, you didn’t say anything: you simply ignored me. You went and lay down
in a huff without my having the faintest idea what it was all about, and now you
accuse me of behaving unreasonably! I haven’t heard a single peep out of you yet to
explain what it is that you are angry about I’
‘Your own conscience ought to tell you that,’ said Aroma. ‘You don’t need me to tell
you.’
They were still arguing when Grandmother Jia sent a ser?vant round to summon him
to lunch. He went off to the front apartment, but returned almost immediately after
bolting a single bowlful of rice. He found Aroma asleep on the kang and Musk sitting
beside her playing Patience with some dominoes. He had long known that Musk was
a close ally of Aroma’s, so ignoring them both, he marched past them into the inner
room, raising the door-curtain for himself as he passed through. Musk followed him
automatically, but he pushed her out:
‘No, no, I wouldn’t presume to trouble you!’
She laughed and went back to her Patience, having first ordered a couple of the
younger maids to wait on him in her stead.
In the inner room Bao-yu took up a book and reclined on the kang to read. For a
considerable while he remained engrossed in his reading. When eventually he did
look up, intending to ask someone for some tea, he saw two little maids waiting
there in silence, one of whom - evidently the older by a year or two - was an
attractive, intelligent-looking girl. He addressed himself to her:
‘Isn’t your name “Nella” something or other?’
‘Citronella.’
‘Citronella? Who on earth gave you that name?’
‘Aroma, sir. My real name is “Soldanella”, but Miss Aroma altered it to “Citronella”.’
‘I don’t know why she didn’t call you “Citric Acid” and have done with it,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘Citronella! - How many girls are there in your family, Citronella?’
‘Four,’ said Citronella.
‘And which of the four are you?’
‘I’m the youngest.’
‘Right!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In future you will be called Number Four”. We’re not going to
have any more of these floral fragrances around here. It’s an insult to decent scents
and flowers to give their names to you lot!’
Then he asked her to pour him some tea.
Listening attentively in the outer room, ‘Flowers’ Aroma and her Musky ally — for
whose ears this gibe was intended — were nearly bursting themselves in their efforts
not to laugh.
All that day Bao-yu stayed in his own room, seeing no one. It was gloomy on his own,
with nothing but reading and a little writing for amusement, but he refused to make
use of any of his usual attendants and would have only “Number Four” to wait on
him. Though he did not realize it, she was a designing little minx and endeavoured by
every artifice at her command to get her hooks into him while she had the chance.
After dinner Bao-yu came back flushed and slightly tipsy, having taken a few cups of
wine with his meal. Normally this would have been the occasion for an evening of
hilarity with Aroma and the rest, but today he would have to sit by his lamp alone in
cheerless isolation. The prospect was a depressing one. Yet if he were to go running
after her, it would seem too much like a capitulation, and her nagging would
thenceforth become insufferable. On the other hand, to frighten her into some sort
of compliance by asserting his mastery over her would be heartless. There was
nothing else for it: he would just have to grin and bear it.
‘Suppose they were all dead,’ he said to himself. ‘I should have to make do on my
own somehow or other!’
The thought was strangely comforting. He was able to stop worrying. He even began
to feel quite cheerful. Having instructed Number Four to trim up the lamp and brew
him a pot of tea, he settled down to a volume of Zhuang-zi. Presently he came to the
following passage in the chapter called ‘Rifling Trunks’:

Away then with saints and wise men, and the big thieves will cease from despoiling.
Discard your jades, destroy your pearls, and the little thieves will cease from pilfering.
Burn your tallies, smash your seals, and the common people will revert to their
natural integrity. Break all the bushels and snap all the steelyards, and they will have
no further grounds for dispute. Obliterate those ‘sacred laws’ by which the world is
governed, and you will find yourself at last able to reason with them. If you confuse
the pitch? pipes, break up the organs, unstring the zithers and stop up Shi Kuang’s
ears, people will begin to make proper use of their own hearing. If you abolish all
intricacy of design and brilliancy of colouring and glue up Li Zhu’s eyes, people will
begin to make proper use of their own eyesight. And if you destroy your arcs and
lines, throw away your compasses and set-squares and break the fingers of Chui the
Cunning, people will begin to make proper use of their own skill…

The words wonderfully suited his present mood. He read no further. Impulsively
picking up a writing-brush, and with the inspiration lent him by his tipsiness, he
added the following lines in the margin:

Away then with Musk and Aroma, and the female tongue will cease from nagging.
Discard Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty, destroy Dai-yu’s divine intelligence, utterly
abolish all tender feelings, and the female heart will cease from envy. If the female
tongue ceases from nagging there will be no further fear of quarrels and
estrangements; if Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty is discarded there will be no further
grounds for tender admiration; and if Dai-yu’s divine intelligence is des?troyed there
will be no further cause for romantic imaginings. These Bao-chais, Dai-yus, Aromas
and Musks spread their nets and dig their pits, and all the world are bewitched and
ensnared by them.

Having written these lines, he threw down the brush and went straight to bed.
He was asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow and remained dead to
the world throughout the whole of that night. Waking with the first light next
morning, he sat up in bed to find Aroma lying fully clothed beside him outside the
covers. He roused her with a gentle shake, all yesterday’s un?pleasantness now quite
forgotten:
‘Go to bed properly! You’ll get cold, sleeping like that!’
Aroma had not, on the day previous to this, openly criticized Bao-yu for disporting
himself at all hours of the day and night with his girl cousins because she knew from
experience that criticism was powerless to change him. To alert him to the error of
his ways she had instead adopted a more passive approach. She had confidently
expected this new method to produce a speedy repentance, followed by a swift
return to normal relations; so that when, contrary to her expectation, a whole day
went by without his having manifested the looked-for change of heart, she was left
with no further resources, and as a consequence had been too worried to sleep
properly for the greater part of that night.
But now here he was addressing her normally once more. He must have undergone a
change of heart during the night. She forced herself to ignore him still, in order to
drive the lesson home.
Meeting with no response, Bao-yu reached out his hand to help her get undressed;
but he had got no further than undo?ing the first button when she pushed his hand
away and did it up again. He was at a loss to know what to do with her. With a gentle
smile he took her by the hand:
‘Now - what’s the matter?’
He had to repeat the question several times. She fixed her eyes on him angrily:
‘Nothing’s the matter. But now you’re awake, hadn’t you better hurry over to the
other place to get washed? If you delay much longer, you might not be in time.’
‘What other place?’ said Bao-yu.
Aroma smiled coldly.
‘Why ask me? How should I know? Go wherever you like for your toilet! Let’s make
a clean break from now on, you and I, and perhaps we’ll have a bit less of all this
bickering and making ourselves ridiculous in front of the others. I mean to say, even if
you get tired of going there, you’ve always got your Number Fours and Number Fives
back here to wait on you. But as for the rest of us: even our names are “an insult to
decent scents and flowers”!’
Bao-yu laughed:
‘Do you still remember that?’
‘I’ll remember that if I live to be a hundred I’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not like you: treating
everything I say like so much wind and forgetting in the morning what you said
yourself the night before!’
There was something about her pretty face suffused with anger that Bao-yu found
infinitely touching. He snatched up a jade hairpin that was lying beside the pillow and
snapped it in two.
‘So be it with me if I ever fail to listen to you again!’ he said.
‘What a way to carry on at this hour of the morning!’ said Aroma, hurriedly picking
up the pieces. ‘Whether you listen to me or not is up to you. There’s no need to get
into such a state about it!’
‘You don’t know how worried you make me,’ said Bao-yu.
‘So you feel worried, do you?’ said’ Aroma smiling. ‘Now perhaps you’ll have some
idea what I feel like most 6f the time! – Come on, let’s get washed!’
With that the two of them got up and began their toilet.
Later, after Bao-yu had gone off to the front apartment, Dai-yu looked in
unexpectedly, and not finding Bao-yu in, began idly turning over the books that were
lying on his desk. Chancing to light on the volume of Zhuang-zi that he had been
reading the night before, her eye was drawn to the lines he had written in the margin.
They both vexed and amused her, and she could not resist picking up a writing-brush
and adding the following quatrain on the remaining blank space:

What wretch would here, with scurrile pen,
The text of Zhuang-zi plagiarize,
And, heedless of his own great faults,
Fright others with his wicked lies?

That done, she went to the front apartment to see Grand?mother Jia, and from there
on to Lady Wang’s.
*
She found everyone at Lady Wang’s in a great to-do. Xi-feng’s baby daughter was ill.
The doctor had been called and had just finished taking her pulses.
‘Convey my congratulations to Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian’— the doctor’s diagnosis
was couched in the strange language which custom decrees in such cases — ‘I am
happy to inform them that the little girl’s sickness is the small-pox!’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng at once sent back to inquire whether the child was in any
danger. The doctor made the following reply:
‘Variola is, of course, a dangerous disease, but provided there are no complications,
most cases of it are recuperable. Let the ladies lay in a plentiful supply of sanguis
caudae, or pig’s tail blood, and plenty of essence of mulberry-worm. Applied
externally these will ensure a satisfactory development of the pustules.’
Xi-feng immediately became very busy. A room had to be swept out and prepared for
the worship of the Smallpox Goddess. Orders had to be given to the servants to avoid
the use of all fried and sautéed cookery. Patience had to be told to move Jia Lian’s
clothes and bedding to a room outside - for sexual abstinence, too, was enjoined on
the parents of the sufferer. A length of dark-red cloth had to be procured and made
up into a dress for the child by the combined labours of the nurses, maids and female
relations most closely associated with it. Finally, a ritually purified room had to be
made ready for the two doctors who would take it in turns to examine the little
patient and make up her medicines, and who would not be permitted to return to
their own homes until the customary period of twelve days had elapsed. These
arrangements having been completed, Jia Lian went off to the outer study which was
from now on to be his bedroom, while Xi-feng and Patience joined Lady Wang in the
daily worship and propitiation of the Smallpox Goddess.
Jia Lian was the sort of man who will begin getting up to mischief the moment he
takes leave of his wife. After only a couple of nights sleeping on his own he began to
find abstin?ence extremely irksome and was reduced to slaking his fires on the more
presentable of his pages. But other relief was at hand.
Among the domestic staff at the Rong-guo mansion was a certain drunken,
dilapidated cook, by surname Duo, who, because of his weakness of character and
general uselessness, had acquired the nickname of ‘Droopy Duo’. Two years previous
to this date Droopy’s father had provided him with a wife. She was now just turned
twenty, a fine, good-looking young wanton, always eager to throw herself at
whatever partners opportunity might place in her way. Droopy Duo raised no
objection to her infidelities. As long as he had meat to eat and wine to drink and
money in his pocket he saw no reason to concern himself about anything else.
Consequently there was scarcely an able-bodied male in the Ning-guo and Rong-guo
mansions who had not at one time or another sampled her wares. Because of her
pneumatic charms and omnivorous promiscuity this voluptuous young limmer was
referred to by all and sundry as ‘the Mattress’.
Jia Lian, now separated from the wife of his bosom and fairly frying with unsatisfied
desires, had for some time past been aware of the Mattress’s charms; but though his
mouth had long watered to enjoy them, what with fear of his jealous young wife on
the one hand and fear of his fancy boys on the other, he had so far found no
opportunity of approaching her.
The Mattress, too, had for some time past had her eye on Jia Lian, and it was a
source of regret to her that he had so far proved unapproachable. Learning that he
had now moved to his study outside, she managed to find excuses for passing by that
way three or four times in a day, provoking Jia Lian to a pitch of frantic eagerness
only to be compared with that of a starving rat confronted by some food. He was
obliged to seek the advice of his pages and to promise them rich rewards if they
could procure her for his pleasure. The pages were ready enough to oblige — the
more so as they were themselves old customers of hers - and the request for an
assignation was no sooner made than granted.
At about ten o’clock that night, when all were abed and Droopy Duo lay collapsed on
the kang in drunken slumbers, Jia Lian slipped noiselessly into the room for his
pre-arranged meeting with the Mattress. The mere sight of her proved so potent a
stimulant that without wasting any time on tender preliminaries, he took down his
trousers and set to work at once.
Now this wife of Duo’s had a physical peculiarity which was that as soon as the man’s
body came into contact with her own she felt a delicious melting sensation invading
her limbs, rendering her body soft and yielding to that of her partner, so that he had
the impression of lying on a heap of down; and in addition to this natural
endowment she knew more tricks of posture and more ways of exciting a man with
murmured lewdnesses and amorous cries than a professional prostitute.
As Jia Lian lay on top of her, wishing he could melt into her body from sheer excess of
pleasure, she began to exercise this last accomplishment.
‘Your little girl’s got the smallpox,’ she murmured. ‘While they’re worshipping the
Goddess, you are supposed to keep yourself pure. Naughty man! You’re making
yourself unclean because of me. You must leave me! Go away!’
Jia Lian’s movements became more violent.
‘You are my only goddess!’ he said, panting heavily. ‘I care for no other goddess but
you!’
At this the Mattress began to grow even more reckless in her incitements and Jia Lian
to reveal the more disgusting of his sexual accomplishments.
They lay a long time together when it was over, exchanging oaths and promises,
unable to break apart. From that day on?wards there was a secret understanding
between them.
A day arrived when the smallpox poison had spent itself and Baby’s pustules showed
signs of drying up. After the twelfth day the Smallpox Goddess was ceremoniously
ushered off the premises, the entire family joined in a service of thanks?giving to
Heaven and the ancestors, and there was much burn?ing of incense in discharge of
vows made on the child’s behalf by various of its members, and much exchanging of
congratulations and paying out of rewards. When all this was over, Jia Lian returned
once more to the matrimonial couch. ‘A night after absence is better than a wedding
night’ as the proverb crudely puts it, and certainly the affection shown that night by
Jia Lian for his lady was of more than usual intensity.
Early next morning, when Xi-feng had gone off to Grandmother Jia’s, Patience began
putting away the clothes and bedding that had been brought in from the outer study.
To her surprise she felt something strange in the cover of Jia Lian’s head-rest, and
after groping inside it, fished out a black, silky tress of woman’s hair. Quick to
understand its significance, she hid it in her sleeve and going across to the other
room, showed it to Jia Lian and asked him what it was.
As soon as he saw the hair, Jia Lian rushed forward to snatch it from her. She darted
away, but he seized hold of her, and forcing her on to the kang, attempted to wrest it
from her grasp.
‘Mean thing!’ said Patience. ‘After I’ve gone to the trouble of asking you about it
behind her back, you have to start being rough!’
Just at that moment they heard Xi-feng coming. Jia Lian didn’t know whether to let
go of Patience or make a final effort to obtain the hair. Finally, with a muttered
entreaty, he re?leased her:
‘Angel! Don’t let her know!’
Patience managed to get up just as Xi-feng was entering.
‘Quick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Open up the chest and find that pattern for Her Ladyship!’
‘Yes madam,’ said Patience.
While Patience was looking for the pattern, Xi-feng caught sight of Jia Lian and
suddenly thought of something else.
‘Have we got the things back from the outer study yet?’
‘Yes,’ said Patience.
‘Was there anything missing?’
‘No,’ said Patience. ‘I went through them very carefully, but there was nothing
missing.’
‘Was there anything there that shouldn’t have been?’
Patience laughed.
‘Isn’t it enough that there was nothing missing? Why should there be anything
extra?’
Xi-feng laughed, too.
‘He was nearly a fortnight outside. I wouldn’t bank on his having kept himself clean
all that time. There might have been something left behind by one of his little friends:
a ring or a sash or something.’
Jia Lian turned pale with fright. He grimaced piteously at Patience from behind
Xi-feng’s back, and drawing a finger across his throat, silently entreated her to keep
her discovery hidden.
Patience affected not to notice him.
‘It’s funny you should say that, Mrs Lian. Exactly the same thought occurred to me;
but though I went through his things very carefully, I didn’t find anything suspicious.
If you don’t believe me, you can have a look yourself.’
‘Silly girl!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you imagine that if there were really anything there he
would let us look?’
And taking the pattern from her she went out again. Patience pointed a finger at her
own nose and wagged her head from side to side.
‘How are you going to thank me for that?’
‘You’re a sweet little darling!’
He beamed delightedly and lunged forward to embrace her. Patience dangled the
hair in front of him:
‘You’ll have to watch your step from now on,’ she said. ‘Now I’ve got something to
keep you in order with. If you misbehave...!’
‘All right, you look after it, then. But’ - his tone became entreating - ‘don’t,
whatever you do, let her find out!’
He said this to put her off her guard. As soon as her defences were relaxed he made a
quick grab and snatched it from her.
‘Perhaps you’d better not have it, after all,’ he said with a grin of triumph. ‘If I have
it I can burn it, and then it’s all over and done with.’
He stowed the hair in the side of his boot as he said this. Patience clenched her teeth
in anger.
‘You’re mean! Burn the bridge when you’re safely over the river - that’s your way,
isn’t it? All right then, you needn’t expect me to tell lies for you in future!’
In Jia Lian’s lascivious eyes her anger made her adorable. He felt himself becoming
excited, and throwing his arms round her, he asked her to let him take her. But
Patience struggled free and ran from the room, leaving him doubled up in a fury of
frustrated desire.
‘Little cock-teaser!’ he shouted after her. ‘You deliberately provoked me, and now
you run away!’
‘Who provoked you?’ Patience giggled from outside the window. ‘You shouldn’t be
so randy! Do you expect me to make the Mistress hate me just for the sake of making
you feel comfortable?’
‘You needn’t worry about her,’ said Jia Lian. ‘One of these days when I get my
temper up I’m going to lay into that jealous whore and break every bone in her body.
Then perhaps she’ll know who’s master round here. She watches me like a bloody
thief. She can talk to men when she likes, but I’m not supposed to talk to women, oh
no! If I’m talking to a woman and just happen to get a bit close, she immediately
starts suspecting something. But if she wants to go chattering and larking around
with Bao or Rong or any other bloody male on the premises, that’s supposed to be all
right! You wait! One of these days I’ll stop her seeing anyone at all!’
‘She’s every right to watch you,’ said Patience, ‘and you’ve no right at all to be
jealous of her. She’s always been perfectly straight and above board where men are
concerned; but you — whatever you do you’ve got something nasty in mind! You
make even me worried, never mind about her!’
‘Oh, shut up! ‘ said Jia Lian. ‘You’re all perfect, aren’t you? It’s just me that’s always
up to something nasty! One of these days I’ll make a clean sweep of the lot of you!’
Just at that moment Xi-feng stepped into the courtyard and saw Patience standing
outside the window.
‘If you want to talk,’ she said, ‘why not talk inside the room? What’s the idea of
running outside and bawling through the window?’
‘Don’t ask her!’ said Jia Lian’s voice from inside. ‘She thinks there’s a tiger in the
room and she’s afraid of being eaten!’
‘He’s in there on his own,’ said Patience. ‘What should I be doing in there with
him?’
‘All the more reason for being in there, I should have thought, if he’s on his own,’
said Xi-feng, smiling rather spite?fully.
‘Is that remark intended for me?’ said Patience.
‘Who else?’ said Xi-feng.
‘You’ll make me say something I shall feel sorry for in a minute,’ said Patience; and
instead of standing aside and raising the door-blind for her mistress, she entered
ahead of her, dropped it rudely in her face, and marched angrily through the
sitting-room to one of the rooms at the back.
‘What’s the matter with Patience? The girl’s gone mad!’ said Xi-feng when she had
raised the blind again and let her?self in. ‘I really do believe she is trying to displace
me. You’d better look out, my friend: I’ll have the hide off you!’
‘Bravo! Good for Patience!’ said Jia Lian, who had re?treated on to the kang and
was applauding the comedy from that safer eminence. ‘I didn’t know she had it in her.
In future I shall take that girl more seriously.’
‘It’s you who’ve let her get above herself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I hold you directly
responsible for this!’
‘Oh no!’ said Jia Lian. ‘If you two want to quarrel, I’m not going to stand between
you and take all the knocks, I’m getting out of here!’
‘I’m sure I don’t know where you think you’ll go to,’ said Xi-feng.
‘Don’t you worry, I’ve got somewhere to go to,’ said Jia Lian, and he began to go;
but Xi-feng stopped him.
‘No, don’t go! There’s something else I want to talk to you about.’
But if you want to know what it was, you will have to wait for the next chapter.




CHAPTER 22

Bao-yu finds Zen enlightenment
in an operatic aria
And Jia Zheng sees portents of doom in
lantern riddles

Hearing that Xi-feng wanted to consult him about something, Jia Lian halted and
asked her what it was.
‘It’s Bao-chai’s birthday on the twenty-first,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What do you think we
ought to do about it?’
‘How should I know?’ said Jia Lian. ‘You’ve managed plenty of big birthday
celebrations before in your time. Why have you become so helpless all of a sudden?’
‘There are fixed rules for everything when you are planning a big grown-up
celebration,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but in Bao-chai’s case she’s neither exactly grown-up nor
exactly a child any longer. That’s why I wanted your advice.’
Jia Lian lowered his head and thought for a moment.
‘Why, you’re being stupid!’ he said presently. ‘There’s a precedent right in front of
you. What about Dai-yu? All you’ve got to do is find what arrangements you made in
the past for her and do exactly the same for Bao-chai now.’
‘Do you suppose I didn’t think of that?’ said Xi-feng with scorn. ‘I’m not that stupid!
The point is that yesterday, be?cause of something Grandma said, I started asking
them all their birthdays and ages, and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the
twenty-first Bao-chai is going to be fifteen. Now that doesn’t qualify for a full-scale
celebration, but it is a sort of coming-of-age, and when Grandma heard about it she
said she wanted to sponsor something for it herself. So obviously, whatever we do, it
can’t be quite the same as what we’ve done in the past for Dai-yu.’
‘Well in that case,’ said Jia Lian, ‘take what you did for Dai-yu as a basis and just add
on a bit.’
‘That’s what I’d thought of doing,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but I wanted to see what you
thought before doing anything definite, because I didn’t want to go adding extras on
my own initiative and then have you complaining that you hadn’t been properly
consulted.’
‘You can cut that out!’ said Jia Lian — though not ill-?humouredly. ‘You know you
don’t really mean a word of it! Just stop snooping on me all the time, that’s all I ask.
You won’t hear any complaints from me then about not being consulted!’
With that he walked off: but whither, or to whom, our narrative does not disclose.
It tells us instead that Shi Xiang-yun, having spent a con?siderable part of the New
Year holiday with the Jias, was now on the point of returning home, but was urged by
Grand?mother Jia to wait for Bao-chai’s birthday and not go back until she had seen
the plays. Xiang-yun agreed to stay and sent someone home with instructions to tell
them that she would be returning a little later than planned and to fetch a couple of
pieces of her own embroidery that she could give to Bao-chai as a birthday-present.
Ever since Bao-chai’s first arrival, Grandmother Jia had been pleasurably impressed
by her placid and dependable disposition, and now that she was about to spend her
first ‘big’ birthday in the Jia household, the old lady resolved to make it a memorable
one. Taking twenty taels of silver from her private store, she summoned Xi-feng and
directed her to spend it on providing wine and plays for a celebration. Xi-feng made
this the occasion for a little raillery.
‘If the old lady says she wants her grandchild’s birthday celebrated,’ she said, ‘then
celebrated it must be, and we must all jump to it without arguing! But if she’s going
to start asking for plays as well, all I can say to that is that if she’s in the mood for a
bit of fun, I’m afraid she’s going to have to pay for it. She’s going to have to cough up
something out of those private savings of hers she’s been hoarding all these years -
not wait until the last minute and then fish out a measly little twenty taels to pay for
the party: that’s just another way of telling us we’ve got to pay for it ourselves. I
mean, if you were really hard up, it would be another matter: but you’ve got boxes
and boxes of boodle — the bottoms are dropping out of them, they’re so full! It’s
pure meanness, that’s what it is! You forget, Grannie, when you go to heaven young
Bao-yu won’t be the only one who’ll walk ahead of the hearse. You’ve got other
grandchildren too, don’t forget! You don’t have to leave everything to him. The rest
of us may not be much use, but you mustn’t be too hard on us. Twenty taels! Do you
really think that’s enough to pay for a party and plays?’
At this point the entire company burst into laughter, which Grandmother Jia joined in
herself.
‘Just listen to her!’ she said. ‘I thought I had a fairly sharp tongue, but I’m no match
for this one: “Clack-clack, clack-clack” — it’s worse than a pair of wooden clappers!
Even your mother-in-law daren’t argue with me, my dear! Don’t pick on me!’
‘Mother-in-law is just as soppy about Bao-yu as you are,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve got no
one to tell my troubles to. And you say I’m sharp-tongued!’
Xi-feng’s mock-lugubriousness set the old lady off in another squall of laughter. She
loved to be teased, and Xi-feng’s bantering put her in great good humour.
That night, when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were
standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own
apartments, Grandmother Jia asked Bao-chai what sort of plays she liked best and
what her favourite dishes were. Bao-chai was well aware that her grandmother, like
most old women, enjoyed the livelier, more rackety sort of plays and liked sweet and
pappy things to eat, so she framed her answers entirely in terms of these preferences.
The old lady was delighted.
Next day presents of clothing and various other objects, to which Lady Wang, Xi-feng,
Dai-yu and the rest had all contributed, were sent round to Bao-chai’s. Our narrative
supplies no details.
At last the twenty-first arrived. A dear little stage had been erected in the courtyard
outside Grandmother Jia’s apartment and a newly trained troupe of child actors able
to perform both Kun-qu and the noisier Yi-qiang type of plays had been en?gaged. In
the apartment’s main sitting-room a semicircle of little tables were arranged facing
outwards towards the stage and laid in preparation for a feast. No outsiders were
invited. The guests of honour were Aunt Xue, Shi Xiang-yun and Bao-?chai herself. All
the others invited were members of the family.
Early that morning Bao-yu, not seeing Dai-yu around, went to look for her in her
room and found her still reclining on the kang.
‘Get up and have something to eat!’ he said. ‘The players will be starting shortly.
Tell me some play you like so that I shall know which one to choose!’
‘If you’re so anxious to please me,’ said Dai-yu coldly, ‘you ought to hire a troupe
specially and put on all my favourites. It’s a cheap sort of kindness to treat me at
someone else’s expense!’
‘Never mind!’ said Bao-yu. ‘When we hire a troupe for you, you’ll be able to return
the compliment.’
He hauled her up from the kang, and the two of them went off hand in hand
together.
As soon as they had eaten, it was time to talk about choosing the plays and
Grandmother Jia called on Bao-chai to begin. Bao-chai made a show of declining; but
it was her birthday, and in the end she gave in and selected a piece about Monkey
from The Journey to the West. Grandmother Jia was pleased.
Aunt Xue was now invited to pick a play, but as her own daughter had just chosen,
she refused. Grandmother Jia did not press her and passed on to Xi-feng. Xi-feng
would nor?mally have refused to take precedence over her aunt and mother-in-law,
who were both present, but Grandmother had commanded and must be obeyed. As
she happened to know that the old lady’s partiality for lively plays was particularly
strong in the case of those which had lots of jokes and clowning in them, she selected
a piece entitled Liu Er Pawns His Clothes in order to make sure that this element was
not lacking from the programme. As she had anticipated, Grand?mother Jia was even
more delighted by this second choice.
Next Dai-yu was asked to choose. She deferred to Aunt Xing and Aunt Wang; but
Grandmother Jia was insistent:
‘I’ve brought you young people here today for some fun,’ she said. ‘I want you to
enjoy yourselves. Never mind about them! I didn’t go to all this trouble just for their
sakes! They are lucky to be here at all, having all this good food and enter?tainment
for nothing: you surely don’t think that on top of that I’m going to let them choose
the plays?’
The others all laughed, and Dai-yu chose a play. Then Bao-yu, Shi Xiang-yun,
Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Li Wan each chose a play in turn, after which the
little players proceeded to perform them in the order in which they had been
selected.
When the time came to bring in the wine and begin the feast, Grandmother Jia
invited Bao-chai to choose again. This time she asked for Zhi-shen at the Monastery
Gate.
‘Why do you keep choosing plays like that?’ said Bao-yu.
‘To hear you talk, it doesn’t sound as if all your years of play-going have taught you
much,’ said Bao-chai. ‘This is an excellent play, both from the point of view of the
music and of the words.’
‘I can’t stand noisy plays,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I never could.’
‘If you call this a noisy play,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it proves that you don’t know what
you’re talking about. Come over here and I’ll explain. This Zhi-shen at the Monastery
Gate is a “Ruby Lips” sequence in the Northern mode. That means, musically
speaking, that it is in a vigorous, somewhat staccato style. In fact the musical
excellence of this piece goes without saying. But apart from that, the libretto is good,
too. The words of Zhi-shen’s “Clinging Vine” aria, which is the last but one in the
sequence, are particularly fine.’
Bao-yu was interested, drew his chair closer, and begged her to let him hear them.
Lowering her voice so as not to dis?turb the others, she half-sang, half-recited them
for his benefit:

        ‘I dash aside the manly tear
        And take leave of my monkish home.
        A word of thanks to you, my Master dear,
        Who tonsured me before the Lotus Throne:
        ‘T was not my luck to stay with you,
        And in a short while I must say adieu,
        Naked and friendless through the world to roam.
        I ask no goods, no gear to take away,
        Only straw sandals and a broken bowl,
        To beg from place to place as best I may.’

Bao-yu listened enthralled tapping his knee and nodding his head in time to her
singing. When she had done, he agreed enthusiastically about the excellence of the
words and congratulated her on the extraordinary breadth of her know?ledge.
‘Sh!’ said Dai-yu, looking round crossly in Bao-yu’s direction. ‘Can’t you be a bit
quieter and attend to the play? This is Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate we’re
supposed to be listening to, not Jing-de Acts the Madman!’
Xiang-yun found this very funny.
They continued to watch plays until the evening. Grand?mother Jia had taken a
particular fancy to the little player who had acted the heroine’s parts and the one
who had played the clown, and when the last performance was over, she asked for
them to be brought in to see her. She found them very ‘sweet’ - even more so on a
closer inspection - and asked them their ages. The leading lady turned out to be
eleven and the clown only nine! There were murmurs and exclamations from all
present when they heard this, and Grandmother Jia told someone to give them
delicacies from the table and a present of money each, in addition to what they
would receive as members of the troupe.
Meanwhile Xi-feng appeared to be very much amused about something.
‘The way that child there is made-up makes him look so like someone we know,’
she said. ‘Haven’t any of you noticed?’
Bao-chai knew whom she was referring to, but merely nodded her head slightly
without replying. Bao-yu, too, nodded, but did not dare to reply. Only Xiang-yun was
tactless enough to say anything:
‘Oh, I know!’ she blurted out. ‘Like Cousin Lin, you mean?’
Bao-yu shot a quick glance in her direction; but it was too late. Xiang-yun’s reply had
prompted the others to look more carefully, with the result that they all
instantaneously burst out laughing, so striking was the resemblance. Shortly after
this the party broke up.
During the evening Xiang-yun ordered Kingfisher to start packing. Kingfisher
remonstrated:
‘What’s the hurry? Why not wait till we’re going? There’ll be plenty of time before
we go.’
‘We’re going first thing tomorrow,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What’s the point of staying any
longer? You can see from the looks on their faces that we are not welcome here.’
Bao-yu chanced to overhear this remark and hurried in to her:
‘You’re wrong to be offended with me, coz. The others all know how sensitive
Cousin Lin is, and they wouldn’t answer because they were afraid of upsetting her.
When you sud?denly spoke up without realizing, I knew she was bound to be upset,
and that’s the reason why I looked at you like that. I was worried for your sake,
because I was afraid she would be offended with you. That you should now get angry
with me is really rather unfair. If it had been anyone else but you, I shouldn’t have
minded whether they offended her or not. I shouldn’t have felt that much concern
about them.’
Xiang-yun silenced him with an imperious wave of her hand:
‘You can save your fine speeches for someone else. They’re wasted on me.
Obviously I’m not in the same class as your Cousin Lin. It’s all right for other people
to laugh at her; but as soon as I say anything about her, I’m at once in the wrong. I’m
not really worthy to speak about her at all. She’s the young lady of the house. I’m
only a little nobody!’
‘I was only thinking of you,’ said Bao-yu in great agitation, ‘yet now you put me in
the wrong. May I straightway turn into dust and be trodden beneath ten thousand
feet if I had any but the kindest intentions!’
‘You are too glib with your ridiculous oaths,’ said Xiang-?yun. ‘This is no time for
swearing. You can keep that kind of talk for that sensitive, easily upset person you
were talking about. She knows how to handle you. Don’t try it on me: it makes me
thick!’
With these words she walked off into the inner room of Grandmother Jia’s apartment
and lay down on the kang in a rage.
Very much out of countenance, Bao-yu went off to look for Dai-yu. She must have
been waiting for him, for just as he was entering the room, she pushed him out again
and shut the door. Totally at a loss to understand her behaviour, he called to her
softly through the window:
‘Dai, dear! Dai!’
But she took no notice.
Bao-yu stood there disconsolately, hanging his head in silence. Nightingale knew
what was happening, but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene; so he
continued to stand there like an idiot, until at last Dai-yu thought he must have gone
back to his own room, and opened the door again. When she saw him still standing
there, she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time, and allowed him
to follow her back into the room.
‘There’s always a reason for everything,’ he said. ‘If you tell people what it is, they
don’t feel so bad about it. You can’t suddenly get angry with me for no reason
whatever. What is all this about?’
‘Don’t ask me! said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I don’t know. I’m only a figure of fun - the sort of
person you might compare with a child actor in order to get a good laugh from the
others.’
‘I never made the comparison,’ said Bao-yu hotly, ‘and I never laughed at you. Why
should you be angry with me?’
‘You would like to have made the comparison; you would like to have laughed,’ said
Dai-yu. “To me your way of not comparing and not laughing was worse than the
others’ laughing and comparing!’
Bao-yu found this unanswerable.
‘However,’ Dai-yu went on, ‘that I could forgive. But what about that look you gave
Yun? Just what did you mean by that? I think I know what you meant. You meant to
warn her that she would cheapen herself by joking with me as an equal. Because
she’s an Honourable and her uncle’s a marquis and I’m only the daughter of a
commoner, she mustn’t risk joking with me, because it would be so degrading for her
if I were to answer back. That’s what you meant, isn’t it? Oh yes, you had the kindest
intentions. Only unfortunately she didn’t want your kind intentions and got angry
with you in spite of them. So you tried to make it up with her at my expense, by
telling her how touchy I am and how easily I get upset. You were afraid she might
offend me, were you? As if it were any busi?ness of yours whether she offended me
or not, or whether or not I got angry with her!’
When Bao-yu heard her say this, he knew she must have overheard every word of his
conversation with Xiang-yun. He reflected that he had only acted in the first place
from a desire to keep the peace between them: yet the only outcome of his good
intentions had been a telling-off by either party. It put him in mind of something he
had read a day or two previously in Zhuang-zi:

        The cunning waste their pains;
        The wise men vex their brains;
        But the simpleton, who seeks no gains,
        With belly full, he wanders free
        As drifting boat upon the sea.

and of another passage from the same book about timber trees inviting the axe and
sweet springs being the cause of their own contamination. The more he thought
about it, the more dejected he became.
‘If I can’t even get on with the few people I live with now,’ he asked himself, ‘how
am I going to manage later on...?’
At that point in his reflections it seemed to him that there was no further point in
arguing, and he turned to go back to his room.
Dai-yu realized that he must have thought of something upsetting to go off like this.
But not to be answered was al?together too provoking. She felt the anger mounting
inside her.
‘All right, go!’ she shouted after him. ‘And don’t ever come back! And don’t ever
speak to me again!’
Bao-yu ignored her. He went straight back to his own room, threw himself on the bed,
and lay staring at the ceiling. Aroma knew what the trouble was but dared not, for
the time being at any rate, refer to it. She tried distracting him with talk of other
matters.
‘I suppose there’ll be more plays after today, won’t there? Miss Bao is sure to give a
return party, isn’t she?’
‘Whether she does or not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘what concern is it of mine?’
This was certainly not the sort of answer Aroma was used to getting. She tried again,
smiling breezily:
‘That’s no way of looking at it! This is the New Year holi?days, when their ladyships
and the young ladies are all en?joying themselves. We can’t have you mooning
around like this!’
‘Whether their ladyships and the young ladies are enjoying themselves or not,’ said
Bao-yu, ‘what concern is it of mine?’
Aroma laughed.
‘Seeing that they’re all doing their best to be agreeable, couldn’t you try to do
likewise? Surely it’s much better ail round if everyone will give and take a bit?’
‘What do you mean, “give and take a bit”?’ said Bao-yu in the same lack-lustre
voice as before. ‘They can give and take a bit if they like. My destiny is a different
one:
naked and friendless through the world to roam.’
A tear stole down his cheek as he recalled the line from the aria.
He continued to ponder its words and to savour their mean?ing, and ended up by
bursting into tears and crying outright. Jumping up from the bed, he went over to his
desk, took up a writing-brush, and wrote down the following lines in imitation of a
Buddhist gāthā:
         I swear, you swear,
         With heart and mind declare;
         But our protest
         Is no true test.
          It would be best
          Words unexpressed
          To understand,
          And on that ground
          To take our stand.
After writing it, he was still not satisfied. Though now enlightened himself, he feared
that someone reading his gāthā might not be able to share his enlightenment.
Accordingly, with the words of the ‘Clinging Vine’ aria still running in his head, he
added another set of verses after it to explain his point. That done, he read the whole
through to himself out loud, then, with a wonderful feeling of liberation, went to bed
and fell fast asleep.
Curious to know the sequel to Bao-yu’s departure, Dai?-yu, on the pretext of wanting
to see Aroma about something, eventually came round herself to have a look. Aroma
told her that Bao-yu was already in bed asleep. She was on the point of going back
again when Aroma smilingly detained her:
‘Just a moment, Miss! There’s a note here. Would you like to see what it says?’
She handed her the sheet of paper containing Bao-yu’s gāthā and the ‘Clinging Vine’
poem. Dai-yu could see that they must have been written under the influence of
their recent quarrel and could not help feeling both amused by them and a little
sorry. But all she said to Aroma was:
‘It’s only a joke. Nothing of any consequence.’
She took it with her back to her own room and showed it to Xiang-yun. Next day she
showed it to Bao-chai as well. Bao-chai glanced at the second poem. This is what
Bao-yu had written:
              You would have been at fault, if not for me;
              But why should I care if they disagree?
              Free come, free go, let nothing bar or hold me!
              No more I’ll sink and soar between gloom and elation,
              Or endlessly debate the depth of our relation.
              What was the point of all of that past pother?
              When I look back on it, it seems scarce worth the bother.

Then she read the gāthā. She laughed.
‘I’m afraid this is all my fault. It must have been that aria I told him about yesterday
which started it all. Those Taoist writings and Zen paradoxes can so easily lead people
astray if they do not understand them properly. I shall never forgive myself if he is
going to start taking this sort of nonsense seriously and getting it fixed in his head. It
will all be because of that aria!’
She tore the paper into tiny pieces and gave them to one of the maids:
‘Here, burn this - straight away!’
Dai-yu laughed at her.
‘You needn’t have torn it up. If you will both come with me and wait while I put a
question to him, I can guarantee to drive this nonsense from his mind once and for
all.’
The three girls went round to Bao-yu’s room together.
‘Bao-yu,’ said Dai-yu, addressing him in a heavily mock-?serious manner, ‘I wish to
propound a question to you: “Bao” is that which is of all things the most precious and
“yu” is that which is of all things the most hard. Wherein lies your preciousness and
wherein lies your hardness?’
Bao-yu was unable to think of an answer. The girls all laughed and clapped their
hands.
‘Ha, ha, ha! He can’t reply. For a student of Zen he does seem remarkably obtuse!’
‘You say in your gāthā,’ Dai-yu continued,
‘ “... It would be best
Words unexpressed
To understand,
And on that ground
To take our stand.”

Now that’s all right as far as it goes, but it doesn’t go far enough. I should like to add
a few lines to it. Like this:

But, I perpend,
To have no ground
On which to stand
Were yet more sound.
And there’s an end!’


‘Ah, that’s better!’ said Bao-chai. ‘That sounds like a real “insight”. When the Sixth
Patriarch Hui-neng first came to Shao-zhou looking for a teacher, he heard that the
Fifth Patriarch Hong-ren was living at the monastery on Yellow?-plum Mountain, so
he found employment there in the monas?tery kitchen. When the Fifth Patriarch
wanted to choose a successor, he ordered each of the monks to compose a gāthā;
The Elder Shen-xiu recited this one:

    “Our body like the Bo-tree is,
    Our mind’s a mirror bright.
    Then keep it clean and free from dust,
    So it reflects the light!”

Hui-neng happened to be hulling rice in the kitchen at the time, and he shouted out,
“That’s not bad, but it’s still not quite right.” Then he recited this gāthāof his own:

    “No teal Bo-tree the body is,
    The mind no mirror bright.
    Since of the pair none’s really there,
    On what could dust alight?”

The Fifth Patriarch at once handed him his robe and bowl as a sign that he was to
succeed him. Your improvement on Cousin Bao’s gāthāis on very much the same lines,
Dai. There’s just one thing, though: what about that “koan” of yours he couldn’t
answer? Surely you’re not going to let him get away with it?’
‘Failure to answer means defeat,’ said Dai-yu. ‘In any case, if he were to answer
now, it would hardly count. The only condition I impose as victor is that he should
henceforth be forbidden to talk any more about Zen. You see,’ she told Bao-yu, ‘even
Bao-chai and I know more about it than you do. It’s too ridiculous that you should set
yourself up as a Zen authority!’
Bao-yu had in fact believed that he had attained an En?lightenment; but now
suddenly here was Dai-yu propounding koans he couldn’t answer and Bao-chai
quoting with easy familiarity from the Saying of the Patriarchs — though neither had
shown any evidence of these accomplishments in the past. It was clear that their
understanding of these matters was far in advance of his own. He consoled himself
with the reflection that if they, whose understanding was so superior, were
mani?festly still so far from Enlightenment, it was obviously a waste of time for him
to go on pursuing it. Having reached this comfortable conclusion, he accepted
Dai-yu’s condition with a laugh:
‘Who wants to be an authority on Zen? It was only a joke, any way!’

*

Just then it was announced that the Imperial Concubine had sent someone round
from the Palace with a lantern-riddle which they were to try and guess. After they
had guessed the answer, they were each to make up a riddle of their own and send it
back to her.
As soon as they heard this, the four of them hurried to the reception room in
Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where they found a young eunuch with a square,
flat-topped lantern of white gauze specially made for hanging riddles on. There was
one hanging on it already which they crowded round to read while the eunuch gave
them their instructions:
‘When the young ladies have guessed, will they please not tell anyone the answer,
but write it down secretly. The answers will be collected and taken back to the Palace
in a sealed en?velope so that Her Grace can see for herself who has guessed
correctly.’
Bao-chai went up to the lantern and looked at the riddle, which was in the form of a
quatrain. It was not a particularly ingenious one, but she felt obliged to praise it, and
therefore remarked that it was ‘hard to guess’ and pretended to have to think about
the answer, though in truth it had been obvious to her at a glance. Bao-yu, Dai-yu,
Xiang-yun and Tan-chun had also guessed the answer and were busy writing it down.
Presently Jia Huan and Jia Lan were summoned, and they too wrote something down
after a good deal of puzzling. After that everyone made up a riddle about some
object of their choice, wrote it out in the best kai-shu on a slip of paper, and hung it
on the lantern, which was then taken away by the eunuch.
Towards evening the eunuch returned and reported what the Imperial Concubine
had had to say about the results:
‘Her Grace’s own riddle was correctly guessed by everyone except Miss Ying and
Master Huan. Her Grace has thought of answers to all the riddles sent her by the
young ladies and gentlemen, but she does not know whether or not they are correct.’
He showed them the answers written down. Some were right and some were wrong,
but even those whose riddles had been incorrectly answered deemed it prudent to
pretend that the answers they had received were the right ones.
The eunuch proceeded to distribute prizes for answering the Imperial Concubine’s
riddle. Everyone who had guessed correctly received an ivory note-case made by
Palace craftsmen and a bamboo tea-whisk. Ying-chun and Jia Huan were the only
ones who did not receive anything. Ying-chun treated the matter as a joke and
rapidly dismissed it from her mind, but Jia Huan was very much put out. To make
matters worse, the eunuch went on to query Jia Huan’s own riddle:
‘Her Grace says that she has not answered Master Huan’s riddle because she could
not make any sense of it. She told me to bring it back and ask him what it means.’
Intrigued, the others crowded round to look. This is what Jia Huan had written:

         ‘Big brother with eight sits all day on the bed;
Little brother with two sits on the roof’s head.’.

There was a loud laugh when they had finished reading it. Jia Huan told the eunuch
the answer: a head-rest and a ridge-end. The eunuch made a note of it and, after
taking tea, departed once more.
Fired with enthusiasm by Yuan-chun’s example, old Lady Jia decided to hold a riddle
party. A very elegant lantern in the form of a three-leaved screen was hurriedly
constructed on her orders and set up in the hall. When that had been done, she told
all the boys and girls to make up a riddle - being careful to keep the answers to
themselves - write it on a slip of paper, and stick it on her lantern-screen. Then,
having pre?pared the best fragrant tea to drink, a variety of good things to eat, and
lots of little gifts to serve as prizes, she was ready to begin. Jia Zheng observed the
old lady’s excitement when he got back from Court and came along himself in the
evening to join in the fun.
There were three tables. Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng, Bao-yu and Jia Huan sat at the
table on the kang, while below, Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Xiang-yun sat at one
table and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at another. The floor below the kang was
thronged with old women and maids in attendance. Li Wan and Xi-feng had a table to
them?selves in an inner room.
‘Where’s my little Lan?’ said Jia Zheng, not seeing Jia Lan at any of the tables.
One of the serving-women went into the inner room to ask Li Wan. She rose to reply
out of respect for her father-in-law:
‘He refuses to come because he says his Grandpa Zheng hasn’t invited him.’
The others were much amused when the woman relayed this answer back to Jia
Zheng.
‘He’s a stubborn little chap when he’s made his mind up!’ they said. But they
thought none the worse of him for that.
Jia Zheng quickly sent Jia Huan with two of the old women to fetch him. When he
arrived, Grandmother Jia made him squeeze up beside her on her side of the table
and gave him a handful of nuts and dried fruits to eat. The little boy’s presence
provided the company with something to laugh and talk about. But not for long.
Bao-yu, who normally did most of the talking on occasions like this, was today
reduced by his father’s presence to saying no more than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to remarks
made by other people. As for the rest: Xiang-yun, in spite of her sheltered upbringing,
was normally an animated, not to say indefatigable talker, but this evening she too
seemed to have been afflicted with dumbness by Jia Zheng’s presence; Dai-yu was at
the best of times unwilling to say very much in company from a sort of aristocratic
lethargy which was a part of her nature; and Bao-chai, whose punctilious correctness
made her always sparing in the use of words, even though on this occasion she was
probably the least uncomfortable of those present, said little to advance the
conversation. As a consequence, what should have been a jolly, intimate family party
was painfully unnatural and restrained.
Grandmother Jia knew as well as everyone else that this state of affairs was entirely
owing to Jia Zheng’s presence, and after the wine had gone round for the third time,
she attempted to drive him off to bed. Jia Zheng, for his part, was perfectly well
aware that he was being driven away so that the younger people could feel freer to
enjoy themselves and, smiling forcedly, appealed against his banishment:
‘When they told me earlier today that you were planning to give a riddle party, I
specially prepared a contribution to the feast so that I might come and join you. You
have so much affection for your grandchildren, Mama. Can you not spare just a tiny
bit for your son?’
Grandmother Jia laughed:
‘They can’t talk naturally while you are here. All you are doing is making it gloomy
for me. I can’t abide it. Well, if you’ve come to answer riddles, I’ll give you a riddle.
But if you can’t guess the answer, you will have to pay me a for?feit.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Jia Zheng eagerly. ‘And if I guess right, I shall expect to be given
a prize.’
‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The monkey’s tail reaches from tree-top to
ground. It’s the name of a fruit.’
Jia Zheng knew that the answer to this hoary old chestnut was ‘a longan’ (long ‘un),
but pretended not to, and made all kinds of absurd guesses, each time incurring the
obligation to pay his mother a forfeit, before finally giving the right answer and
receiving the old lady’s prize. Then he propounded a riddle of his own for her:


‘My body’s square,
Iron-hard am I.
I speak no word,
But words supply.


—It’s a useful object.’
He whispered the answer to Bao-yu, who, readily understand?ing what was expected
of him, surreptitiously passed it on to Grandmother Jia. The old lady, having thought
for a bit and decided that it sounded all right, said:
‘An inkstone.’
‘Bravo, Mamma! Right first time!’ said Jia Zheng, and turn?ing round to address the
servants, he asked them to bring in the presents for Lady Jia. There was an answering
call from the women below, and presently a number of them came for?ward bearing
trays and boxes of various shapes and sizes which they handed up onto the kang.
Grandmother Jia examined them one by one. They all contained traditional Lantern
Festival presents, but in new and exquisite designs and of the very highest quality.
The old lady was obviously pleased.
‘Come, children!’ she commanded jovially. ‘Give the Master a drink!’
Bao-yu stood up and poured wine from the wine-kettle into a little cup and Ying-chun
handed it ceremoniously to her uncle.
‘Have a look at the riddles on the screen,’ said Grandmother Jia when Jia Zheng,
with equal ceremony, had drained the cup. ‘They were all made up by the children.
See if you can tell me the answers.’
Jia Zheng rose from his seat and went up to the lantern-screen. The first riddle he
saw was Yuan-chun’s:

At my coming the devils turn pallid with wonder.
My body’s all folds and my voice is like thunder.
 When, alarmed by the sound of my thunderous crash,
       You look round, I have already turned into ash.
                               An object of amusement.


‘Would that be a firework?’ said Jia Zheng.
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu.
Jia Zheng looked again, this time at Ying-chun’s:

         Man’s works and heaven’s laws I execute.
Without heaven’s laws, my workings bear no fruit.
Why am I agitated all day long?
For fear my calculations may be wrong.
A useful object.
          ‘An abacus?’
          There was a laugh from Ying-chun:
      ‘Yes.’
     The next riddle was Tan-chun’s:

In spring the little boys look up and stare
To see me ride so proudly in the air.
My strength all goes when once the bond is parted,
And on the wind I drift off broken-hearted.
An object of amusement.


‘It looks as if that ought to be a kite’, said Jia Zheng.
‘Yes,’ said Tan-chun.
The next riddle he looked at was Dai-yu’s:

At court levée my smoke is in your sleeve:
             Music and beds to other sorts I leave.
             With me, at dawn you need no watchman’s cry,
             At night no maid to bring a fresh supply.
             My head burns through the night and through the day,
             And year by year my heart consumes away.
The precious moments I would have you spare:
But come fair, foul, or fine, I do not care.
            A useful object.
‘That must be an incense-clock.’
Bao-yu answered for her:
‘Yes.’
   Jia Zheng looked at the next riddle:

Southward you stare,
He’ll northward glare.
Grieve, and he’s sad.
Laugh, and he’s glad.
A useful object.


‘Very good!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If the answer is “a mirror”, it is a very good riddle.’
Bao-yu laughed:
‘That is the answer.’
‘Who is it by?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘There is no name on it.’
‘I expect that one is by Bao-yu,’ said Grandmother Jia.
Jia Zheng said nothing and passed on to the next one in silence. It was by Bao-chai:

    My ‘eyes’ cannot see and I’m hollow inside.
    When the lotuses surface, I’ll be by your side.
    When the autumn leaves fall I shall bid you adieu,
    For our marriage must end when the summer is through.
        A useful object.

Jia Zheng knew that the answer must be ‘a bamboo wife’, as they call those
wickerwork cylinders which are put between the bedclothes in summertime to make
them cooler; but a growing awareness that all the girls’ verses contained images of
grief and loss was by now so much affecting him that he felt quite unable to go on.
‘Enough is enough!’ he thought. ‘What can it be that makes these innocent young
creatures all produce language that is so tragic and inauspicious? It is almost as if
they were all destined to be unfortunate and short-lived and were un?consciously
foretelling their destiny.’
The gloom into which this reflection plunged him was evident in the melancholy
expression on his face and in his bowed and dejected stance. Grandmother Jia
noticed it but attributed it to fatigue. She feared that in this melancholy mood his
continued presence would place an even greater restraint on the young folk’s gaiety.
‘I think you really oughtn’t to stay,’ she said. ‘Why don’t you go and lie down? The
rest of us will sit up for a bit, but I don’t expect we shall go on very much longer.’
‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng, roused from his reverie by her voice. ‘Yes, of course.’
But he forced himself to resume his former jovial manner and to drink another cup or
two of wine with her before finally retiring. Back in his own apartment, he became
lost in reverie once more; but whichever direction his thoughts took him in, he
remained melancholy and troubled.
Meanwhile the party he had just left was proceeding some?what differently.
‘Now, my dears, you can enjoy yourselves!’ Grandmother Jia said as soon as he had
left the room; and the words were no sooner out of her mouth than Bao-yu leaped
up from his seat and over to the screen and began criticizing the riddles on it - this
one had a line wrong here — that one’s words didn’t suit the subject — pointing with
his finger and capering about for all the world like a captive monkey that had just
been let off its chain.
‘Can’t we sit down and enjoy ourselves quietly, as we were doing just now,’ said
Dai-yu, ‘instead of all this prancing about?’
Xi-feng put in a word too, emerging from the inner room to say it:
‘You ought to have Uncle Zheng with you every day and never budge an inch from
his side!’ She turned to the others: ‘What a pity I didn’t think of it at the time: we
ought to have got Uncle to make him compose some more riddles for us. Then we
should have seen him sweat!’
Bao-yu was greatly exasperated by this remark and tried to seize hold of her. Xi-feng
tried to ward him off, and the result was that the two of them became locked in a
sort of playful wrestling-match.
Grandmother Jia continued for a while to laugh and joke with Li Wan and the girls,
but soon began to feel tired and sleepy. The night-drum was sounding, and when
they stopped to listen they found it was already the beginning of the fourth watch.
She ordered the food to be cleared away, telling the servants that they might have
what was left over for them?selves.
‘Time for bed, children!’ she said, rising to her feet. ‘We can do this again tomorrow,
if you like; but now we must have some sleep.’
With that the party gradually broke up and they all dis?persed to their rooms.
What happened thereafter will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 23

Words from the ‘Western Chamber’ supply
a joke that offends
And songs from the ‘Soul’s Return’ move a
tender heart to anguish

Some time after her return from the Visitation the Imperial Concubine commissioned
Tan-chun to make her a copy of all the poems about Prospect Garden that had been
written during her visit, and having rearranged them in what she considered to be
their order of merit, further instructed that they should be engraved on stone in the
Prospect Garden itself — a lasting memorial to the precocious talent of her gifted
family. In pursuance of these instructions, Jia Zheng ordered his people to look out
the best craftsmen available to prepare and engrave the stone and delegated Cousin
Zhen to supervise the work with Jia Rong and Jia Qiang as his lieutenants. As Jia
Qiang proved to be fully occupied with his twelve young actresses — not to mention
their costumes, pro?perties and other paraphernalia — three other junior members
of the clan, Jia Chang, Jia Ling and Jia Ping, were called in to supervise the labour in
his stead. In due course the preliminary stages of waxing, scratching and ‘redding in’
had commenced, and work on the memorial proceeded according to plan. We pass
from this to other matters.
The twenty-four little Buddhist and Taoist nuns having now been moved out of the
two miniature temples in the garden, Jia Zheng had been thinking of dispersing them
among various temples and convents about the city, when a certain Zhou-shi, the
widow of a poor relation of the Rong-guo Jias who lived near by in North Dukes
Street, chanced to get wind of this matter and saw in it the possibility of some
employment.
Zhou-shi had for some time past been meaning to ask Jia Zheng if he would find her
boy Jia Qin a job — no matter how small a job as long as it would bring them in a
little income — and now, hearing this news about the nuns, she drove incontinent
forth to Xi-feng as fast as cab could carry her and besought her to use her influence
on the boy’s behalf.
Xi-feng had always found Zhou-shi a pleasant, unassuming sort of body and was
disposed to help her. Having agreed to do so, and having rehearsed her line of
approach, she went in to Lady Wang and broached the matter with her in the
follow?ing manner.
‘These little Buddhist and Taoist nuns,’ she said, ‘— we definitely ought not to send
them away. We shall need them again if Her Grace ever comes on another visit, and
it will be a terrible job getting them together again if they have all been dispersed. If
you ask me, the best thing would be to move them to the Temple of the Iron
Threshold where they would still be under our control. It would only be a question of
sending someone out there every month with a bit of money to pay for their
housekeeping; then if there is ever any question of needing them again, we have only
to say the word and they can be with us immediately without any trouble.’
The suggestion pleased Jia Zheng when it was in due course relayed to him by Lady
Wang.
‘Of course. That is just what we should do. I am glad you reminded me.’
From Jia Zheng a summons arrived for Jia Lian while he and Xi-feng were at dinner.
He laid down his chopsticks and rose to go, but Xi-feng put a hand out and detained
him:
‘Not so fast! Listen to me! If it’s anything else, never mind; but if it’s about those
little nuns...’ — and she went on to tell him exactly what he should say in that event
and to impress on him how important it was that he should say it.
Jia Lian smiled and shook his head:
‘Sorry, nothing doing! You’ll have to ask him yourself - if you think you know how
to!’
Xi-feng’s back stiffened. She laid down her chopsticks and looked at Jia Lian. There
was a glint in her eye and a dangerous little smile on her face when she spoke:
‘Do you mean that, or are you joking ?’
‘That boy of my cousin’s widow who lives in West Lane, Jia Yun, has been on at me
two or three times about getting him a job, and I promised to do something for him if
he would wait. Now here at last a job comes along and, as usual, you want to snap it
up yourself.’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Xi-feng consolingly. ‘Her Grace has mentioned that she wants a
lot of planting done - pines and cypresses - in the north-east section of the garden,
and she has also asked for more shrubs and flowers to be planted round the foot of
the main hall. I promise you that as soon as that job comes up your Jia Yun shall be
placed in charge of it.’
‘Oh well, in that case all right,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Just one thing, though’ — he dropped
his voice and smiled at her slily — ‘Why did you keep pushing me off like that last
night? I only wanted to try a change of position.’
A quick flush overspread Xi-feng’s face and she exploded in a little laugh. Then with a
‘pshaw!’ in his direction, she lowered her head again and went back to her meal.
Jia Lian laughed and slipped away. On entering Jia Zheng’s presence he found that
the subject was, as Xi-feng had antici?pated, the arrangements for accommodating
the little nuns, and he replied as Xi-feng had instructed him:
‘Jia Qin is a promising young fellow. I think he could be entrusted with the job. In
any case, he would be drawing the allowance from Accounts each month when all
the other pay?ments are made, so we should be able to keep an eye on him.’
Jia Zheng never took much interest in these trivial domestic matters and agreed
readily enough to Jia Lian’s suggestion. The latter returned to his apartment and
reported to Xi-feng. Xi-feng sent someone to inform Zhou-shi; and soon Jia Qin
himself had arrived and was pouring out his gratitude to the two benefactors. With a
show of conferring further favours, Xi-feng ‘begged’ Jia Lian to allow Jia Qin three
months’ payment in advance. A receipt was written for this amount and Jia Lian’s seal
affixed to it, and there and then Jia Qin was issued with a tally and sent to the
counting-house to collect the money.
When the three hundred taels of shining silver had been weighed and counted and
handed over, Jia Qin picked up a piece at random and tossed it to the cashiers to ‘buy
themselves a cup of tea with’. He had a boy to carry the money back home for him,
and after taking counsel with his mother he hired a stout little donkey for himself to
ride on and four or five covered mule-carts for the nuns, and conducting the carts
round to the side gate of the Rong-guo mansion, he called forth the twenty-four little
nuns and packed them all inside. Then off they set, with Jia Qin on his donkey at the
head of the procession, to the Temple of the Iron Threshold outside the city. And
there we leave them.

*

Yuan-chun’s editing of the Prospect Garden poems had given her a vivid recollection
of the garden’s beauties. She was sure that her father, out of a zealous reverence for
the Emperor and herself, would have kept it all locked and closed since her visit and
would have allowed no one else to enter, and she felt this to be a waste and a shame
— the more so when her family contained so many poetical young ladies who would
have found inspiration in its scenery — not to mention the benefit their presence
would have bestowed on the garden itself: for, as is well-known,

             When lovely woman smiles not,
             All Nature’s charms are dead.
Assuredly, the girls must be allowed into the garden. It should become their home.
And if the girls, why not Bao-yu? He had grown up in their midst. He was different
from other boys. If he were not allowed into the garden as well, he would consider
himself left out in the cold, and his distress would cause Lady Wang and
Grandmother Jia to feel unhappy too. Unquestionably she should ask for him to be
admitted along with the girls. Having reached this decision, she summoned the
eunuch Xia Bing-zhong and ordered him to convey the following Edict to Rong-guo
House:

Bao-chai and the other young ladies of the household are to reside in the Garden.
The Garden is not to be kept closed. Bao-yu is to accompany the young ladies into
the Garden and to continue his studies there.

The Edict was received by Jia Zheng and Lady Wang. When Xia Bing-zhong had gone,
they reported it at once to Grandmother Jia and sent servants into the garden to
sweep and prepare its buildings and rehang the blinds, portières and bed-curtains in
readiness for occupation.
No one was more excited by the prospect of this move than Bao-yu. He was
discussing it animatedly with Grandmother Jia (it was a discussion in which the words
‘I want’ recurred rather frequently) when suddenly a maid came in and an?nounced
that he was wanted by his father. At this bolt from the blue his countenance fell and
all his animation drained away. Clinging to his grandmother with the gluey
persistence of a toffee twist, he made it abundantly plain to her that he had no wish
to obey. The old lady did her best to comfort him:
‘There, there, my lamb! You’d better go and see him. Grannie will see to it that he
doesn’t hurt you. He wouldn’t dare. Besides, look at all those lovely poems you wrote:
I expect that’s why Her Grace is letting you inside the garden. I’m sure that’s all he
wants to see you about. Probably he just wants to warn you against getting up to
mischief after you have moved in. You only have to answer nicely and promise to do
as he says. You’ll be all right.’
To make sure, she sent a couple of old nannies along as well with strict instructions to
watch over him:
‘See that his Pa doesn’t frighten him!’ she told them, and the old women promised
their protection.
Obliged to go, yet still reluctant, Bao-yu contrived to do so at so dawdling a pace that
each step can have advanced him only a few inches upon his way. It so happened
that Jia Zheng had gone for the purpose of discussing these matters into Lady Wang’s
room and Lady Wang’s maids Golden, Suncloud, Sunset, Avis and Avocet were
standing outside under the eaves. Their amusement when they caught sight of
Bao-yu advancing at this snail’s pace into the courtyard was evident from the
expression on their faces. Golden seized him by the hand, and thrusting out a pair of
heavily carmined lips, she said to him in a whisper:
‘Look at that byootiful lipstick! I’ve only just put it on. Wouldn’t you like a taste of
it?’
Suncloud, with a suppressed giggle, pushed her off him:
‘Can’t you see how scared he is? It’s mean of you to tease him at a time like this!
He’s in a good mood,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘You’d better go in straight away, while it
lasts!’
Bao-yu entered in a sort of sideways crouch, the picture of a submissive son - a
gesture that was wasted, however, since his father and mother were in the inner
room at the back. Aunt Zhao raised the inner room’s portière to admit him. He
bowed to her and entered. Jia Zheng and Lady Wang sat facing each other on the
kang talking. Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Jia Huan were sitting on a row of
chairs below. Ying-chun remained seated at his entrance, but the other three rose to
their feet.
Jia Zheng glanced up and saw Bao-yu standing before him. The lively intelligence that
shone in the boy’s every feature, his almost breath-taking beauty of countenance
contrasted strikingly with Jia Huan’s cringing, hang-dog looks and loutish demeanour,
and Jia Zheng thought suddenly of his other son, Jia Zhu, his Firstborn, whom he had
lost. He glanced at Lady Wang. Of the children she had borne him Bao-yu was now
the only surviving son. He knew how much the boy meant to her. He thought of
himself, too: ageing now, his beard already grey. And as he thought, much of his
customary dislike of Bao-yu slipped away, so that for the time being perhaps only ten
or twenty per cent of it still remained. After what seemed to Bao-yu a very long time,
he said:
‘Her Grace has expressed a fear that by spending your time in constant amusement
outside you may become an idler and a dullard, and she has directed that you and
the girls should be moved into the garden so that you may be kept more closely at
your books. See to it that you work hard and diligently! If I detect any signs of your
former unruliness and disobedience, you will be in for trouble!’
Bao-yu assented meekly. Lady Wang took his hand and drew him up beside her on
the kang. Now that he was seated, Jia Huan and the other two sat down once more
in their chairs. Lady Wang stroked Bao-yu’s neck affectionately:
‘Have you finished those pills I sent you the other day yet?’
‘There’s still one left,’ said Bao-yu.
‘You must come for some more tomorrow. I’ll give you another ten. You must get
Aroma to give you one every night before you go to sleep.’
‘Yes. You told Aroma, Mother. She’s been giving me one every night, as you said.’
‘Who is this “Aroma”?’ asked Jia Zheng sharply.
‘A maid,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I suppose there are no limits to what a maid may be called,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but
who would have picked an outlandish name like that to give her?’
Lady Wang could see that he was displeased and did her best to cover up for Bao-yu:
‘I think it was Lady Jia who gave her the name.’
‘Mother would never think of a name like that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It must have been
Bao-yu.’
Bao-yu saw that a frank avowal was now unavoidable and rose to his feet:
‘This maid has a surname which means “Flowers”. There is a line in an old poem I
happened to remember

The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days

and so I named her after that.’
‘When you get back you must change the name at once,’ said Lady Wang hurriedly
to Bao-yu. ‘Come, Sir Zheng’ - this to her husband - ‘you aren’t going to get angry
about a little thing like that?’
‘It doesn’t really matter,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘and there is no need for him to change the
name; but it demonstrates what I have always said about the boy: he is
fundamentally incapable of caring about serious matters and preoccupies himself
with poetic frivolities and other such airy-fairy nonsense as a substitute for solid
learning. Wretched fellow!’ he shouted at Bao-yu. ‘What are you waiting for?’
‘Go now, go now I’ said Lady Wang in a flutter. ‘Grandma is probably waiting to
begin her dinner.’
Bao-yu murmured a reply and retired, rather more slowly than was necessary.
Emerging from the outer door, he grinned and stuck his tongue out at Golden, then
shot off like a puff of smoke, the two old nannies hurrying after him. Arriving at the
entrance of the covered passage-way he came upon Aroma leaning in the doorway.
Her face lit up when she saw him returning unscathed and she asked him what his
father had wanted to see him about.
‘Oh, nothing much,’ said Bao-yu. ‘He just wanted to say a few words about not
getting up to mischief after we’ve moved into the garden.’
Having answered Aroma, he went in to see his grandmother and told her about the
interview. He found Dai-yu with her and asked her which part of the garden she
planned to live in. It appeared that she had just been considering this question
herself, for her answer was a prompt one:
‘I’ve been thinking how nice it would be in the Naiad’s House. I love all those
bamboos and the little winding, half-hidden walk. It is so quiet and peaceful there.’
Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly:
‘Just what I would have chosen for you! I was hoping you would want to live there,
because I want to live in the House of Green Delights — which means that we should
be neigh?bours. And both places are quiet and tucked away.’
They were still discussing their plans when a servant arrived from Jia Zheng with a
message
for Grandmother Jia. It was to say that the twenty-second of the second month being
a Lucky Day was the date on which Bao-yu and the girls were to move into the
garden. Servants were to be allowed inside in the interim in order to make the rooms
ready for them. It was finally settled that Bao-chai should have All-spice Court, Dai-yu
the Naiad’s House, Ying-chun the building on Amaryllis Eyot, Tan-chun the Autumn
Studio, Xi-chun the Lotus Pavilion, Li Wan Sweet-rice Village, and Bao-yu the House
of Green Delights. Each set of rooms was allotted two old women and four maids in
addition to the occupant’s existing maids and nannies, and there were other servants
whose sole duty was sweeping and cleaning. On the twenty-second of the second
month everyone moved in. The silent, deserted garden suddenly came to life —
Live flowers on silk-embroidered flowers up-glanced,
And unguent scents the scents of spring enhanced
as the bevy of gaily-dressed, chattering girls spread themselves through its quiet
walks.



*
But to return to our hero.
Life for Bao-yu after his removal into the garden became utterly and completely
satisfying. Every day was spent in the company of his maids and cousins in the most
amiable and delightful occupations, such as
reading,
practising calligraphy,
strumming on the qin,
playing Go,
painting,
composing verses,
embroidering in coloured silks,
competitive flower-collecting,
making flower-sprays,
singing,
word games and
guess-fingers.
In a word, he was blissfully happy.
One product of this period was a set of four Garden Nights poems which, though
they have little claim to poetic merit, give a fairly accurate impression of the mood
and setting of those carefree days:

I. Spring

Behind silk hangings, in warm quilts cocooned,
His ears half doubt the frogs’ first muted sound.
Rain at his window strikes, the pillow’s cold;
Yet to the sleeper’s eyes spring dreams unfold.
Why does the candle shed its waxen tear?
Why on each flower do angry drops appear?
By uncouth din of giggling maids distressed
He burrows deeper in his silken nest.

II. Summer

A tired maid sleeps at her embroidery.
A parrot in its gilt cage calls for tea.
Pale moonbeams on an opened mirror fall,
And burning sandal makes a fragrant pall.
From amber cups thirst-quenching nectar flows.
A willow-breeze through crystal curtains blows.
In pool-side kiosks light-clad maidens flit,
Or, dressed for bed, by open casements sit.

III. Autumn

In Red Rue Study, far from worldly din,
Through rosy gauze moonlight comes flooding in.
Outside, a stork sleeps on moss-wrinkled rocks,
And dew from well-side trees the crow’s wings soaks.
A maid the great quilt’s golden bird has spread;
Her languid master droops his raven head.
Wine-parched and sleepless, in the still night he cries
For tea, and soon thick smoke and steam arise.

IV. Winter

Midnight and winter: plum with bamboo sleeps,
While one midst Indian rugs his vigil keeps.
Only a stork outside is to be found –
No orioles now, though white flowers mask the ground.
Chill strikes the maid’s bones through her garments fine;
Her fur-clad master’s somewhat worse for wine;
But, in tea-making mysteries deep-skilled,
She has with new-swept snow the kettle filled.

The indifferent quality of these poems did not prevent members of that class of
worldlings who see merit in a name and excellence in a title from copying them out
and proclaiming them everywhere as miracles of precocious talent when they
discovered that their author was the thirteen-year-old heir apparent of Sir Jia of
Rong-guo House. There were also a number of bright young things who professed an
extravagant liking for the deliciousness of the poems, and who copied them on to
fans and wall-spaces and recited them on the least provocation (or none at all) at
social gatherings. Soon Bao-yu was being besieged with requests for more poems, for
speci?mens of his calligraphy, for paintings, for inscriptions. He began to feel himself
a lion and was kept constantly busy with these dilettantish ‘duties’.
Then, quite suddenly, in the midst of this placid, agreeable existence, he was
discontented. He got up one day feeling out of sorts. Nothing he did brought any
relief. Whether he stayed indoors or went out into the garden, he remained bored
and miserable. The garden’s female population were mostly still in that age of
innocence when freedom from inhibition is the fruit of ignorance. Waking and
sleeping they surrounded him, and their mindless giggling was constantly in his ears.
How could they understand the restless feelings that now consumed him? In his
present mood of discontent he was bored with the garden and its inmates; yet his
attempts to find distraction outside it ended in the same emptiness and ennui.
Tealeaf saw how it was with him and racked his brains for a remedy. Unfortunately all
the things he could think of seemed to be things that Bao-yu had already tried and
grown tired of. But no, there was something he had not yet tried. As soon as Tealeaf
thought of it, he set off to the book-stalls and bought a pile of books — books of a
kind Bao-yu had never heard about - to give as a present to his young master. His
purchases included
Old Inklubber’s Stories Old and New
The Secret History of Flying Swallow
Sister of Flying Swallow
The Infamous Loves of Empress Wu
The Jade Ring Concubine, or Peeps in the Inner Palace
and a heap of playbooks — mostly romantic comedies and the like.
Bao-yu took one look at this gift and was enraptured; but Tealeaf uttered a warning:
‘Don’t take these into the garden! If you do, and anyone finds out about them, I’ll
be in real trouble — more than just a bellyful!’
The injunction was one with which Bao-yu was most un?willing to comply. After a
good deal of hesitation he picked out a few of the chaster volumes to keep by his bed
and read when no one was about, and left the cruder, more forthright ones behind,
hidden somewhere in his outer study.
One day after lunch — it was round about the Midwash of the third month, as our
forefathers, who measured the passage of time by their infrequent ablutions, were
wont to say - Bao-yu set off for Drenched Blossoms Weir with the volumes of
Western Chamber under his arm, and sitting down on a rock underneath the
peach-tree which grew there beside the bridge, he took up the first volume and
began, very attentively, to read the play. He had just reached the line

The red flowers in their hosts are falling

when a little gust of wind blew over and a shower of petals suddenly rained down
from the tree above, covering his clothes, his book and all the ground about him. He
did not like to shake them off for fear they got trodden underfoot, so collecting as
many of them as he could in the lap of his gown, he carried them to the water’s edge
and shook them in. The petals bobbed and circled for a while on the surface of the
water before finally disappearing over the weir. When he got back he found that a lot
more of them had fallen while he was away. As he hesitated, a voice behind him said,
‘What are you doing here?’
He looked round and saw that it was Dai-yu. She was carrying a garden hoe with a
muslin bag hanging from the end of it on her shoulder and a garden broom in her
hand.
‘You’ve come just at the right moment,’ said Bao-yu, smiling at her. ‘Here, sweep
these petals up and tip them in the water for me! I’ve just tipped one lot in myself.’
‘It isn’t a good idea to tip them in the water,’ said Dai-yu. ‘The water you see here is
clean, but farther on beyond the weir, where it flows past people’s houses, there are
all sorts of muck and impurity, and in the end they get spoiled just the same. In that
corner over there I’ve got a grave for the flowers, and what I’m doing now is
sweeping them up and putting them in this silk bag to bury them there, so that they
can gradu?ally turn back into earth. Isn’t that a cleaner way of disposing of them?’
Bao-yu was full of admiration for this idea.
‘Just let me put this book somewhere and I’ll give you a hand.’
‘What book?’ said Dai-yu.
‘Oh... The Doctrine of the Mean and The Greater Learning,’ he said, hastily
concealing it.
‘Don’t try to fool me!’ said Dai-yu. ‘You would have done much better to let me
look at it in the first place, instead of hiding it so guiltily.’
‘In your case, coz, I have nothing to be afraid of,’ said Bao-yu; ‘but if I do let you
look, you must promise not to tell anyone. It’s marvellous stuff. Once you start
reading it, you’ll even stop wanting to eat!’
He handed the book to her, and Dai-yu put down her things and looked. The more
she read, the more she liked it, and before very long she had read several acts. She
felt the power of the words and their lingering fragrance. Long after she had finished
reading, when she had laid down the book and was sitting there rapt and silent, the
lines continued to ring on in her head.
‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘is it good?’
Dai-yu smiled and nodded.
Bao-yu laughed:


‘How can I, full of sickness and of woe,
Withstand that face which kingdoms could o’erthrow?’

Dai-yu reddened to the tips of her ears. The eyebrows that seemed to frown yet
somehow didn’t were raised now in anger and the lovely eyes flashed. There was
rage in her crimson cheeks and resentment in all her looks.
‘You’re hateful!’ - she pointed a finger at him in angry accusal — ‘deliberately using
that horrid play to take advantage of me. I’m going straight off to tell Uncle and
Aunt!’
At the words ‘take advantage of me’ her eyes filled with tears, and as she finished
speaking she turned from him and began to go. Bao-yu rushed after her and held her
back:
‘Please, please forgive me! Dearest coz! If I had the slightest intention of taking
advantage of you, may I fall into the water and be eaten up by an old bald-headed
turtle! When you have become a great lady and gone at last to your final
resting-place, I shall become the stone turtle that stands in front of your grave and
spend the rest of eternity carrying your tombstone on my back as a punishment!’
His ridiculous declamation provoked a sudden explosion of mirth. She laughed and
simultaneously wiped the tears away with her knuckles:
‘Look at you - the same as ever! Scared as anything, but you still have to go on
talking nonsense. Well, I know you now for what you are:


“Of silver spear the leaden counterfeit”!’

‘Well! You can talk!’ said Bao-yu laughing. ‘Listen to you! Now I’m going off to tell
on you!’
‘You needn’t imagine you’re the only one with a good memory,’ said Dai-yu
haughtily. ‘I suppose I’m allowed to remember lines too if I like.’
Bao-yu took back the book from her with a good-natured laugh:
‘Never mind about all that now! Let’s get on with this flower-burying!’
And the two of them set about sweeping together the fallen flower-petals and
putting them into the bag. They had just finished burying it when Aroma came
hurrying up to them:
‘So there you are! I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Your Uncle She isn’t well
and the young ladies have all gone over to visit him. Her Old Ladyship says you are to
go as well. You’d better come back straight away and get changed!’
Bao-yu picked up his book, took leave of Dai-yu, and ac?companied Aroma back to
his room.
And there, for the moment, we shall leave him.

*
With Bao-yu gone and the girls evidently all out, Dai-yu began to feel lonely and
depressed. She was on her way back to her own room and was just passing by the
corner of Pear Tree Court when she heard the languorous meanderings of a flute and
the sweet modulation of a girlish voice coming from the other side of the wall, and
knew that the twelve little actresses were at their rehearsal inside. Although she was
paying no particular attention to the singing, a snatch of it chanced suddenly to fall
with very great clarity on her ear, so that she was able to make out quite distinctly
the words of two whole lines of the aria being sung:


‘Here multiflorate splendour blooms forlorn
Midst broken fountains, mouldering walls –’

They moved her strangely, and she stopped to listen. The voice went on:


‘And the bright air, the brilliant morn
Feed my despair.
Joy and gladness have withdrawn
To other gardens, other halls -’

At this point the listener unconsciously nodded her head and sighed.
‘It’s true,’ she thought, ‘there is good poetry even in plays. What a pity most people
think of them only as entertainment. A lot of the real beauty in them must go
unappreciated.’
She suddenly became aware that her mind was wandering and regretted that her
inattention had caused her to miss some of the singing. She listened again. This time
it was another voice:


‘Because for you, my flowerlike fair,
The swift years like the waters flow—’

The words moved her to the depth of her being.


‘I have sought you everywhere,
And at last I find you here,
In a dark room full of woe—’

It was like intoxication, a sort of delirium. Her legs would no longer support her. She
collapsed on to a near-by rockery and crouched there, the words turning over and
over in her mind:

Because for you, my flowerlike fair,
The swift years like the waters flow …

Suddenly she thought of a line from an old poem she had read quite recently:

Relentlessly the waters flow, the flowers fade.

From that her mind turned to those famous lines written in his captivity by the tragic
poet-emperor of Later Tang:

The blossoms fall, the water flows,
The glory of the spring is gone
In nature’s world as in the human one —

and to some lines from The Western Chamber which she had just been reading:

As flowers fall and the flowing stream runs red,
A thousand sickly fancies crowd the mind.

All these different lines and verses combined into a single overpowering impression,
riving her soul with a pang of such keen anguish that the tears started from her eyes.
She might have remained there indefinitely, weeping and comfortless, had not
someone just at that moment come up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder.
She turned to look and saw that it was—
But if you wish to know who it was, you must read the next chapter!
CHAPTER 24

The Drunken Diamond shows nobility of character
in handling his money
And the Quiet-voiced Girl provides material for
fantasy by losing her handkerchief

As Dai-yu continued to crouch there, a prisoner of her own sorrowful thoughts and
emotions, someone suddenly came up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder:
‘What are you doing here all on your own?’
She looked round with a start. It was Caltrop.
‘You silly girl!’ said Dai-yu. ‘You gave me quite a shock, creeping up on me like that.
Where have you just come from?’
Caltrop laughed mischievously:
‘I’ve been looking for our young lady, but I can’t find her anywhere. Your
Nightingale is looking for you too, by the way. She says Mrs Lian has sent you - I think
it’s some kind of tea. Shall I go with you?’
She took her by the hand and accompanied her back to the Naiad’s House. The
present from Xi-feng she had mentioned was waiting there when they arrived: two
little cylindrical containers of a new tea supplied to the Palace for the Emperor’s own
use. The two girls sat down and discussed the relative merits of various pieces of
embroidery, played a little Go, and looked at one or two books. Then Caltrop went off
again.
Our narrative leaves them at this point and passes to other matters.

*

Recalled to his own apartment by Aroma, Bao1u arrived back to find his
grandmother’s maid Faithful reclining on the couch examining Aroma’s needlework.
‘Where have you been?’ she said, as soon as she saw him enter. ‘Her Old Ladyship
is waiting for you. She wants you to go next door to see how your Uncle She is
getting on. You’d better hurry up and get changed!’
Aroma went into the next room to get his clothes. Bao-yu sat on the edge of the
couch and kicked his shoes off. While he was waiting for his boots to come, he turned
and scrutinized Faithful. She was wearing a pale strawberry-coloured dress of silk
damask, a sleeveless black satin jacket, stockings of eggshell blue, and dark-red
embroidered slippers. Her neck, which was towards him as she bent down once more
to inspect the needlework, was encircled at its base by a reddish-purple silk scarf. A
fascinating neck. He bent down over it to sniff its perfume and stroked it softly with
his hand. It was as smooth and white as Aroma’s. With an impish chuckle he threw
himself upon her and clung like sticky toffee about her person:
‘Come on, Faithful darling, give us a taste of your lipstick!’
Faithful called out to Aroma in the next room:
‘Aroma, come in and look at this! All the years you’ve been with him now —
haven’t you managed to cure him yet?’
Aroma came in with her arms full of clothes.
‘I don’t know what’s the matter with you,’ she said to Bao-?yu. ‘Heaven knows, I’ve
tried hard enough to cure you! If you go on much longer like this, you’re just going to
make it impossible to go on living here any longer.’
She hurried him on with his dressing. When he was ready, he accompanied Faithful to
the front apartment to see Grandmother Jia. Going outside again, he found horse
and servants ready waiting and was about to get into the saddle, when he noticed Jia
Lian dismounting opposite, having just returned from his visit. The two cousins went
up to each other and exchanged a few words. Just at that moment a figure emerged
from the side of the courtyard and greeted Bao-yu:
‘Uncle Bao! How are you?’
Bao-yu turned. It was a tall, thin youth of eighteen or nineteen who had spoken, with
a thin, handsome face and an air of great natural refinement. Although his face was
familiar, Bao-yu could not for the moment remember his name or which part of the
clan he belonged to.
‘You look very puzzled!’ said Jia Lian amusedly. ‘Surely you know who this is? This is
Jia Yun - Cousin Bu-shi’s boy, who lives in West Lane.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t think what made me forget! — How’s your
mother?’ he asked Jia Yun. ‘What business brings you here today?’
Jia Yun pointed to Jia Lian:
‘I came here to have a word with Uncle Lian.’
‘You’ve grown very good-looking since I saw you last,’ said Bao-yu with a grin. ‘You
could almost be my son.’
‘You’ve got a nerve!’ said Jia Lian laughing. ‘Your son? He’s five or six years older
than you.’
‘How old are you then?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘Eighteen.’
Being a sharp-witted young man who knew how to make the most of an opportunity,
Jia Yun was quick to turn Bao?-yu’s jest to good account.
‘There’s a saying about “grandsires in cradles and babbies with beards”, you know;
and even if I am older than you, “the highest mountain can’t shut out the sun”! I’ve
had no one to care for me during these last few years since my father died, and if you
don’t mind having so stupid a person for your son, I should certainty be very happy
to have you for a father.’
‘You hear that?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Now you’ve got yourself a son! You’ll find that
parenthood is no laughing matter, I can tell you!’
He left them and went inside, chuckling to himself.
Bao-yu smiled at his new ‘son’:
‘Next time you’re free, come and see me. Don’t waste your time trying to join in
their little intrigues! I’m afraid I’m not free at the moment, but if you will come round
to my study tomorrow, we can spend all day together, and I shall be able to show you
round the garden.’
With these words he mounted his horse and set off, his pages at his back, for Jia
She’s.
Bao-yu found that his uncle was suffering from nothing more serious than a chill. He
delivered his grandmother’s message first and then asked after his uncle on his own
behalf. Jia She stood up to hear what his mother had to say, and when Bao-yu had
finished, ordered a servant to take him to his Aunt Xing’s room. Bao-yu withdrew and
followed the servant through the back and across the courtyard to the main
reception room. Seeing him enter, Lady Xing rose to her feet to ask after
Grandmother Jia, then sat down again to be asked after in turn by Bao-yu. Then she
drew him up to sit beside her on the kang and asked him about the others, at the
same time giving orders for tea to be served.
While they were still sipping the tea, little Jia Cong, the son of one of Jia She’s
concubines, came in to say ‘hullo’ to his Cousin Bao.
‘Where did this little ragamuffin come from?’ Lady Xing scolded. ‘I don’t know what
that Nannie of yours can be thinking of to let you get in such a state! I declare, your
face is as black as a crow! No one would ever think to look at you that you were an
educated little boy and came from a good family!’
While she scolded, Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived, their duty call on Jia She evidently
just completed. Lady Xing made them sit on chairs below the kang. Seeing Bao-yu up
on the kang with Lady Xing and sharing her cushion, and observing how she fondled
and petted him, Jia Huan soon began to feel uncomfortable and made a sign to Jia
Lan indi?cating that they should go. As Jia Huan was his uncle, Jia Lan had to do as he
said, so the little boy and the big one rose together to take their leave. Bao-yu said
he would go with them, but Lady Xing stopped him with a gracious smile:
‘You sit where you are! I’ve got something else to say to you.’
He was obliged to stay. Lady Xing turned to the other two:
‘When you get back, do each of you give my regards to your mothers. I won’t ask
you to stay to dinner because I’ve already got the girls here and they are making so
much rumpus that it’s given me a headache.’
Jia Huan and Jia Lan promised to convey her greetings and went out.
‘Where are the girls, then?’ Bao-yu asked after they had gone. ‘I haven’t seen
them.’
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Lady Xing nonchalantly. ‘They only sat here for a few
moments, then they went round to the back. They’re round the back somewhere or
other.’
‘You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about, Aunt. What was it
you wanted to tell me?’
‘Oh, nothing at all!’ said Lady Xing gaily. ‘I only said that because I wanted you to
stay and have dinner here with me and the girls. And I’ve got something nice for you
to take back with you afterwards.’
Bao-yu and his aunt chatted away, and before long it was time for dinner and the
three girls were called in. A table and chairs were arranged, the table was laid, and
Lady Xing, her daughter Ying-chun, her two nieces and her nephew sat down to their
meal. When it was over, Bao-yu went in to take his leave of Jia She, after which he
and the girls returned to their own side of the mansion. There they first went in to
see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then returned to their own apartments for
the night.
So much for Bao-yu and the girls.
Let us return to Jia Yun who, after his encounter with Bao-?yu, had gone in to see Jia
Lian and ask him if there was any prospect of a job.
‘A job turned up only the other day,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but unfortunately your Aunt
Feng was very anxious that I should give it to Jia Qin and I’m afraid I let him have it.
However, she did mention that there will soon be a lot of planting to do in the garden,
and she promised that as soon as that work turns up we shall definitely hand it over
to you.’
Jia Yun was silent for some moments, then he said:
‘All right. I’ll just have to go on waiting, then. But would you mind not mentioning
this visit to Auntie? I can tell her about it myself, if need be, next time I see her.’
‘I shan’t mention it,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I’ve got better things to do with my time than go
running after her to talk about things like this! Tomorrow I have to go to Xing-yi, by
the way. I have to get back on the same day — but perhaps you’d better wait until
the day after tomorrow before coming round again. In fact, you’d better wait until
the evening of the day after tomorrow - some time after the beginning of the first
watch. Any time before that I shall be busy.’
He terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes.
Jia Yun went out of the Rong-guo mansion and set off for home, ruminating as he
went. A plan at last formed in his mind. Instead of returning home, he struck off for
the house of his maternal uncle.
His uncle’s name was Bu Shi-ren. He was the proprietor of a perfumery, and when Jia
Yun arrived had only just got back from the shop. Seeing his nephew enter, he asked
him what he had come about.
‘I’m on to something which needs your help,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Please Uncle, could you
possibly let me have four ounces of Barus camphor and four ounces of musk on
credit? I promise faithfully that you shall have the money by Autumn Quarter-day.’
Bu Shi-ren ‘humph-ed’ scornfully:
‘Don’t talk to me about credit! A while ago we let one of the assistants have several
taels’ worth of goods on credit for one of his relations, and we haven’t seen the
money for it yet. We had to share the loss between us. We’ve got a written
agreement now that in future if any of us gives credit to a friend or relation, he is
liable to a fine of twenty taels of silver to be shared out among the rest.
‘In any case, we’re short of stock on those two items. I doubt we’ve got that much
in the shop, even if you could pay cash down for it. We’d have to try to raise it for you
else?where.
‘And for another thing: what do you want it for, anyway? I don’t expect it’s for any
serious purpose. Even if I let you have it on credit, I expect it would only get thrown
away on some foolishness or other.
‘And don’t you go saying that your Uncle’s always on at you when you come to see
him! You young people just don’t know what’s good for you. If only you could pull
yourself together and earn a bit of money, no one would be happier for you than I
should.’
Jia Yun smiled:
‘What you say is no doubt perfectly true, Uncle. But when Father died I was too
little to understand what was going on, and according to what Mother has since told
me, it was you who stepped in and took care of everything. Now you know as well as
I do that it wasn’t I who spent all the money that came from selling off our little bit of
property, and I don’t see what I am supposed to do without any capital. Even the
cleverest housewife can’t make bread without flour! You’re lucky you’ve only got me
to contend with. Anyone else in my position would be pestering the life out of you.
They’d be round here scrounging all the time: a pound of rice one day, a quart of
beans the next. Then you would have something to grumble about!’
‘My dear boy,’ said Bu Shi-ren, ‘if I had it to give, you should have it and welcome!
Your trouble is, though, as I’m always telling your Aunt, you won’t think ahead. If only
you’d pull yourself together and go and have a word with your Father’s folk at the big
house - or if you can’t get to see them, put your pride in your pocket and make
yourself agreeable to some of the stewards there — get yourself a job of some kind!
When I was on my way out of the city the other day, I ran into that cousin of yours
from North Street riding on a donkey with four or five carriages behind him and fifty
or sixty nuns on his way to your family temple out in the country. Now that’s a
shrewd young fellow! You can’t tell me he got that job by doing nothing!’
Exasperated by his uncle’s nagging, Jia Yun got up to go. ‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bu
Shi-ren. ‘You can have something to eat before you go -’
‘Are you crazy?’ his wife’s voice cut in from the kitchen. ‘I told you we haven’t got
any rice in the house. I’ve just bought this half a pound of noodles that I’m cooking
for you now. I don’t know what you’re acting so lordly about, asking people to dinner.
The boy’ll only go hungry if he stays!’
‘Buy another half a pound, woman, and put it in with the rest!’ said Bu Shi-ren.
‘Goldie!’ Mrs Bu shouted to her daughter. ‘Go over to Mrs Wang’s house across the
road and ask if she can lend us a few cash. Tell her we can pay her back tomorrow!’
But before she had finished, Jia Yun, with a muttered ‘Don’t bother!’ had slipped
quietly away.
Angrily leaving his uncle’s house behind him, he was on his way back home, eyes
fixed on the ground as he brooded miserably on his affairs, when he walked head-on
into drunkard. The man seized hold of him with a curse:
‘You sodding blind, bumping into me like that?’
The voice was a familiar one. Looking closer he saw that it was his neighbour Ni Er, a
racketeer who made most of his money from high-interest loans supplemented by
what he took off other players in the gambling dens. He drank too much and was
always getting into fights. At this particular moment he was on his way back from
paying a little ‘call’ on one of his debtors — evidently a lucrative one, for he was
already half-seas-over. He did not take kindly to being bumped into, and it would
have gone badly with Jia Yun if he had not immediately identified himself:
‘Ni, old chap, don’t strike! It’s me! I wasn’t looking where I was going.’
Hearing the voice, Ni Er opened his bleary eyes a little wider, saw that it was Jia Yun,
released him - lurching heavily as he did so — and gave a crapulous laugh:
‘Oh,’ he said, ‘young Mist’ Jia. Parm me. Wherra you jus’ come from?’
‘Don’t ask me!’ said Jia Yun bitterly. ‘I’ve just been given the bird!’
‘Nemmind!’ said Ni Er. ‘Anyone been bothering you, Mist’ Jia, jus’ tell me and I’ll
settle accounts with him for you! You know me. Ni Er. The Drunken Diamond. Old
Dime’ll look after you. Anyone this part of the town troubling neighbour of Dime’s,
don’t care who he is, guarantee put him out of business.’
‘Look, Diamond, if you’ll promise not to get angry, I’ll tell you what happened,’ said
Jia Yun, and proceeded to give him an account of his interview with Bu Shi-ren. Ni Er
was hugely incensed:
‘Damn fella! Give the damn fella piece of my mind if he wasn’t a relation of yours.
Make my blood boil. Damn fella! Nemmind. Dome be downhearted. Got a few taels
of silver here. If you can use it, help yourself! Good neighbour of Dime’s. Here y’are.
Interest-free loan.’
‘This man’s a racketeer,’ Jia Yun thought to himself, ‘but he’s been known to do a
good turn before now — in fact, he’s got quite a reputation in some quarters as a
champion of the poor. If I don’t accept his offer, he may turn nasty and I shall be in
trouble. Better accept the money and pay back double the amount when I can.’
Having made the decision, he thanked Ni Er with a smile:
‘You’re a real sport, Diamond! Since you’ve been kind enough to make the offer
then, I won’t refuse. I’ll make you out a proper IOU for it when I get home.’
Ni Er roared with laughter:
‘There’s only fifteen taels and six pennyweights of silver here. If you’re going to go
writing IOUs, I won’t lend it to you!’
Jia Yun laughed too and took the money from him:
‘All right, Diamond, anything you say! Let’s not fall out about it!’
‘That’s more like it!’ said Ni Er. ‘Getting dark now. Won’t keep you for a drink. Still
got a little business to do. You go on home. Like you to give a message to my old
woman, be so kind. Not going home tonight. If there’s anything to tell me about, she
can send my daughter round first thing tomorrow. Find me at Bandy Wang, the
horse-dealer’s.’
With these words he went on his way, lurching horribly.
The encounter left Jia Yun somewhat bemused.
‘That Ni Er’s certainly a character!’ he thought. ‘The trouble is, it may only have
been the drink that made him generous. Perhaps when he’s sobered up tomorrow
he’ll want his money back with a hundred per cent interest. What am I going to do
then?’
Then he suddenly remembered what the money would enable him to do:
‘Of course! It doesn’t matter! If I get the job, I can pay back the loan and a hundred
per cent interest easily.’
With that thought uppermost in his mind he went into a money-changer’s to have
the silver weighed. To his great delight it turned out to be exactly the amount Ni Er
had said, not a pennyweight less. Then he went home, calling at Ni Er’s house on the
way to give the message to his wife. En?tering his own house he found his mother on
the kang spin?ning. She looked up as he entered:
‘Where have you been all day?’
He did not like to mention that he had been to see her brother in case she was angry.
He only said:
‘Been at Rong-guo House waiting for Uncle Lian. Have you had supper yet?’
‘Yes, I’ve had mine. I put something aside for you.’
She called to their little slavey to fetch it for him. Except for her work-lamp it was
already dark indoors, so after finishing his supper he got himself ready for the night,
unrolled his bedding, and settled down to sleep.
Rising early next morning, he went off as soon as he had washed to the shops in
Central Street outside the south gate of the Inner City and bought camphor and musk
at a perfu?mer’s. From there he went to Rong-guo House, and having first
ascertained at the gate that Jia Lian was out for the day, he made his way to the
Lians’ apartment at the back. Outside the gateway leading to their courtyard a
number of page boys were sweeping the ground with long-handled brooms.
Sud?denly Zhou Rui’s wife came out and addressed them:
‘Stop sweeping now! The Mistress is coming.’
Jia Yun hurried up to her with a smile of greeting:
‘Where is Aunt Lian off to, then?’
‘Her Old Ladyship wants her,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I think it’s to see about some
tailoring.’
As she spoke, the subject of his inquiry emerged from the gateway, surrounded by a
bevy of attendants. Jia Yun was well aware that she had a weakness for flattery and
the showier forms of deference. Bringing his hands together in an exag?gerated
salute and stepping briskly forward, he made her a tremendous bow and wished her
in good health.
Xi-feng continued to walk on and, without actually looking at him or turning her head,
inquired after his mother’s health and asked why she never came to visit.
‘She’s not been very well, Auntie. She’s always thinking about you and meaning to
pay a call, but when it’s come to it, she just hasn’t been able to get out.’
‘You’re a wonderful liar!’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. ‘I don’t suppose she’s ever
thought about me until this moment!’
‘I’m too much afraid of lightning to lie to my superiors,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Mother was
talking about you only last night, as a matter of fact. She said, “Your Auntie Lian is
only a single weak woman, yet she has all those responsibilities. It’s a good thing she
has the will-power to keep everything running so smoothly, because if that should go,
she’d be worn out in no tine.”‘
Xi-feng was now all smiles, and halted in spite of herself to hear more.
‘And why should you and your mother be chewing over my affairs behind my back,
pray?’
‘That’s a long story,’ said Jia Yun. ‘A very good friend of mine who runs a perfumery
and had quite a bit put by in savings decided to invest his money in a government
post and bought himself the place of an Assistant Sub-Prefect. Well, a few days ago
his posting came and it turns out to be for somewhere down in Yunnan. He’s taking
his family with him, so of course he won’t be able to keep on the shop, and he’s been
going over all his stock deciding what to give away and what to put in his clearance
sale. He decided to give the more valuable stuff to friends and relations. My share
was a whole quarter of a pound of Borneo camphor and another quarter of musk,
and I was discussing with Mother last night what we ought to do with it. We don’t
know anyone who could afford to buy it; and it seems a shame to sell it at less than
the price; and even if we gave it away, we couldn’t think of anyone who would want
so much. But then I suddenly thought of you and the packets of money you’ve spent
on this kind of thing in years past, and I thought to myself that this year, what with
Her Grace in the Palace and the Double Fifth already not far off, you’re sure to be
using ten or twelve times the usual amount. So, to cut a long story short, we decided
to make a present of it to you. There you are, Auntie - a little token of my esteem!’
As he spoke, he took out a small brocade-covered box and respectfully raised it in
both hands to offer her.
Now Xi-feng was just beginning to think about the problem of purchasing aromatics
for the Double Fifth festival, and it pleased her very much to be relieved of the
trouble of doing so — especially when it was in so agreeable a manner. She smiled at
him graciously before turning to her maid:
‘Felicity, take my nephew’s present and give it to Patience to take care of!’
The smile was directed once more on Jia Yun:
‘You are very thoughtful. I’m not surprised your Uncle speaks so highly of you. He’s
often told me what a well-spoken, sensible young man you are.’
They seemed to be sailing into harbour. Jia Yun took a step closer:
‘Has Uncle been talking to you about me then?’ — The tone in which he asked the
question was deliberately meaningful.
Xi-feng was on the point of telling him that he would get the tree-planting job when
she reflected that by doing so she would be cheapening herself in his estimation. He
would almost certainly suppose that she was promising it in return for the perfume.
In replying to his question she therefore confined herself to a few insipid civilities,
avoiding all mention of jobs and trees, and presently continued on her way to
Grandmother Jia’s.
Obviously Jia Yun was in no position to raise the subject if his aunt was not willing, so
he was obliged to return in the same uncertainty in which he had come. Back home
he remembered Bao-yu’s invitation of the previous day, and as soon as he had
finished his meal, he returned once more to Rong-guo House and made his way to
Sunset Studio outside the gateway leading to Lady Jia’s quarters. He found the pages
Tealeaf and Ploughboy sitting over a game of chess and arguing about a piece that
one of them had just taken. Other pages — Trickles, Sweeper, Cloudy and Storky —
were up on the roof looking for fledgelings. Jia Yun entered the court?yard and
stamped his foot:
‘Come on, you young rapscallions! Can’t you see you’ve got a visitor?’
The pages, except Tealeaf, melted away. Jia Yun went into the study and sat down in a
chair.
‘Has Master Bao been here yet?’
‘He hasn’t been here yet today,’ said Tealeaf. ‘If you want to talk to him, I’ll have a
look and see if he’s about.’
With that he, too, vanished.
For about the time it would take to eat a meal, Jia Yun gazed at the paintings,
calligraphic scrolls and antiques which adorned the room. At the end of that time, as
there was still no sign of Tealeaf, he took a look outside to see if there were any other
pages whom he could ask to take a message; but they had all gone off to play
elsewhere. Dejectedly he went back once more to wait.
‘Tealeaf!’
A soft and thrilling voice was calling from outside. Craning out to look he saw a
fifteen-or sixteen-year-old maid standing near the entrance to the study. She was a
neat, pleasant-looking girl with a pair of limpid, intelligent eyes. Seeing a strange man
in the room, she quickly shrank back out of his line of vision. At that very moment
Tealeaf walked back into the courtyard.
‘Ah, good!’ he said, catching sight of the maid. ‘I was beginning to wonder how I’d
ever get a message to him.’
Jia Yun ran out to question him:
‘Well?’
‘Waited for ages,’ said Tealeaf, ‘but no one came by. She’s from his room, though.’ -
he indicated the soft-voiced maid – ‘Listen, dear,’ he said addressing her. ‘Can you
take a message for us? Tell him that Mr Jia from West Lane is here.’
On learning that the visitor was a member of the clan, the maid became less
concerned about concealment and engaged the limpid eyes in bolder scrutiny of his
features. The object of her scrutiny now addressed her:
‘Don’t bother about the “West Lane” stuff! Just say that “Yun” has called!’
The girl reflected for some moments, then, with a half-smile, she said:
‘If I were you, Mr Jia, I’d go home now and come again tomorrow. I’ll try to get a
message through to him this evening if I get the chance.’
‘What’s the idea?’ said Tealeaf.
‘He didn’t have his nap today,’ said the maid. ‘That means he’ll be having dinner
early. Then suppose he doesn’t go out after dinner: are you going to let Mr Jia wait
here all day without eating? It would be much better if he went home now and came
again tomorrow. Even if I succeed in getting word through to him as soon as I get
back, he’ll probably only send an answer to the message. I don’t expect he’ll actually
come over.’
Her words were sensible and to the point and were spoken in the same thrilling tone
that had first attracted him. Jia Yun would have liked to ask her name, but etiquette
forbade that he should do so now that he knew she was one of Bao-yu’s maids. He
just said:
‘I’m sure you’re right. I’ll come again tomorrow, then.’
He turned to go.
‘I’ll get some tea for you, Mr Jia,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Have a cup of tea before you go.’
‘No thanks,’ said Jia Yun, looking back over his shoulder but continuing to go. ‘I’ve
got other business.’
The words were for Tealeaf, but the look which accom?panied them was directed at
the soft-voiced maid, who was still standing there.
Jia Yun went back home and returned next day as she had advised. On his way in he
ran into Xi-feng outside the main gate. She was about to visit Jia Lian’s parents next
door and had just got into her carriage. Seeing Jia Yun, she made her attendants call
to him to stop.
‘Yun!’ She smiled at him through the window of the carriage. ‘You’ve got a nerve,
my lad, playing a trick like that on me! I see now why you gave me that present. It’s a
job you were after. Your Uncle told me yesterday. Apparently you’ve been on to him
about it already.’
Jia Yun smiled back ruefully:
‘I’d rather we didn’t go into my dealings with Uncle, if you don’t mind! I’m
beginning to wish I’d never spoken to him about it. If I’d realized earlier what the
situation was, I should have gone straight to you in the first place. I’m sure if I had, it
would all have been settled long ago. I’m afraid Uncle has let me down.’
‘Humph!’ said Xi-feng. ‘So that’s why you came to me yesterday, is it? You’d had no
success with the husband so you thought you’d try your luck with the wife!’
‘That’s most unfair, Auntie!’ Jia Yun protested. ‘It was a purely disinterested present.
I wasn’t thinking at all about a job when I gave it to you. If I had been, why do you
suppose I didn’t take the opportunity of asking you about it at the time? However,
since you do now know that I’m looking for one, I’d like to forget about Uncle and
throw myself on your kindness instead.’
‘You have a very devious way of going about things,’ said Xi-feng with a hint of
malice in her smile. ‘Why couldn’t you have spoken up sooner? A little thing like this
is hardly worth so much delay. We still need some more trees and shrubs planted in
the garden, and I’ve been trying to think of someone to do the job. If you’d spoken
up earlier, it could all have been done by now.’
‘You can set me to work tomorrow, Auntie. I’ll be ready.’
Xi-feng thought for a while.
‘I don’t know that it’s a very suitable job for you. Perhaps we’d better wait until
next New Year and put you in charge of lanterns and fireworks. That’s a much bigger
job.’
‘Look, Auntie: you give me this planting job now, then; if you’re satisfied with the
way I do it, you can give me the other job later on.’
Xi-feng laughed:
‘You certainly know how to fish with a long line! — All right, then! It’s not really my
affair, but I suppose as your Uncle has mentioned it to me — I’m only going next door
now and I shall be back again after lunch. Come round a little after midday to get the
money and you shall start your planting the day after tomorrow.’
She told the servants to harness the carriage and drove off to make her call.
Beside himself with joy, Jia Yun now continued on his way to Sunset Studio to look for
Bao-yu. In point of fact Bao-yu had gone off first thing that morning to call on the
Prince of Bei-jing; but no one seemed to know about this, and Jia Yun sat waiting
expectantly throughout the whole of the morning. Having waited until noon, he
inquired whether Xi-feng was back yet, and being informed that she was, he wrote
out a form of receipt, took it round to the Lians’ apartment, and sent in word that he
had called for his tally. Sunshine came out in response to his message and asked him
for the receipt, which he took indoors. Presently he reappeared and handed it back
to Jia Yun with the date and amount filled in in the blanks he had left for this purpose,
together with the precious tally which would enable him to draw the money.
Glancing at the receipt as he took it from him, Jia Yun was delighted to observe that
the figures entered were for a payment of two hundred taels of silver. He hurried off
to the counting-house to collect it, then home once more to share the joyful news
with his mother.
Next day he was off long before daylight to look up Ni Er and pay him back the loan.
That done, he took another fifty taels of the silver with him and called on a
nurseryman outside the West Gate called Fang Chun, from whom he bought a large
number of trees.
At this point our narrative abandons Jia Yun’s affairs and returns to Bao-yu.
When Bao-yu, in the course of his meeting with Jia Yun, had invited Jia Yun to drop in
and spend the following day with him, the invitation was of the careless, half-serious
kind that is unfortunately typical of young gentlemen of his class. As he had made no
real effort to remember it at the time, it naturally slipped his memory the following
day. Returning now, two evenings later, from the palace of the Prince of Bei-jing
where he had been all day, he called first on his grandmother and his mother and
then returned to his own rooms in the garden and changed back into his everyday
clothes.
He decided to take a bath; and since Aroma was out, having been ‘borrowed’ by
Bao-chai to make braid buttons on a dress, Ripple and Emerald had gone off to see
about the water. Of the other senior maids, Skybright had been fetched home for her
cousin’s birthday and Musk was away ill; and the few heavy-work maids left in
attendance had all assumed that their services would not be required and had gone
off in search of their gossips. For a quarter of an hour Bao-yu was left entirely on his
own. It chanced that precisely at this mo?ment he wanted someone to get him some
tea. He had already called a couple of times without response and at his third call
two or three old charwomen came hurrying in to see what was the matter.
‘No, no: I don’t need you!’ - he waved them away im?patiently. The old women
retired, baffled.
Since there were no maids, Bao-yu saw that he would have to serve himself. He
found himself a cup and was about to take up the pot to pour himself some tea when
a voice started speaking right behind him:
‘Let me, Master Bao! You might scald yourself.’
Bao-yu jumped. The owner of the voice hurriedly relieved him of the cup.
‘Where have you been all this time?’ he said. ‘You gave me quite a start, coming up
suddenly like that!’
She handed him his tea with a smile:
‘I was in the back courtyard. I came in through the courtyard door at the back.
Didn’t you hear me coming?’
Bao-yu sipped his tea and observed her carefully. Her dress, though not shabby, was
far from new. By contrast she had a magnificent head of raven-black hair which was
done up in a simple bun. The face was rather long and thin; the build slender; the
overall impression that of a tidy, clean, graceful person.
‘Do you belong here then?’ he asked her.
‘Yes.’ She seemed amused.
‘If you do, how is it that I’ve never seen you before?’
She replied with some bitterness:
‘There are quite a few of us you’ve never seen. I’m not the only one, by any means.
How could you have seen me? I’ve never been allowed to wait on you or show myself
in your presence.’
‘Why not?’
‘I don’t think it’s for me to say. — Oh, there’s something I do have to tell you,
though. Yesterday a gentleman calling himself “Yun” came to see you. I thought you
probably wouldn’t be able to see him at the time, so I told Tealeaf to ask him round
this morning. Unfortunately by the time he came, you’d already gone off to see the
Prince—’
Their conversation was interrupted by the giggles of Ripple and Emerald who had just
entered the courtyard with a large bucket of water. Each of them held the bucket by
one hand and lifted her skirts up with the other. They were staggering under the
unaccustomed weight and slopping a good deal of the water about as they went. The
maid hurried out to relieve them. By now the giggles had given way to
recriminations:
‘Look, you’ve soaked my dress!’
‘You trod on my toe!’
They stopped to look at this person who had just issued from the young Master’s
room and saw with some surprise that it was Crimson. Putting down the water, they
hurried indoors to look. Bao-yu was there on his own. The girls were indignant. As
soon as they had prepared the bath and seen him undressed, they shut the door
after them and hurried to the other side of the building to find Crimson.
‘What were you doing in his room just now?’ they asked her accusingly.
‘I wasn’t doing anything,’ said Crimson. ‘I couldn’t find my handkerchief, so I went
to look for it round the back. He was calling for some tea and none of you happened
to be about, so I ran in and poured it out for him. And just at that moment you came
back.’
Ripple spat in her face:
‘Nasty, shameless little slut! When we asked you to fetch the water for us you said
you were busy and made us go ourselves. You didn’t waste much time, having got
him to yourself, did you? You think you’re on the way up, don’t you? Step by step.
Well, we can catch up with you, my fine lady! Why don’t you take a look at yourself in
the mirror and then ask yourself if you’re a fit person to go serving tea to the
Masters?’
‘We’d better warn the others that when he asks for tea or anything in future they
must stay where they are and let her go and get it!’
‘In that case,’ said Ripple, ‘the rest of us may as well clear off and let her have him
all to herself!’
They were still at their antiphonal taunting when an old woman arrived with a
message from Xi-feng:
‘Someone is bringing some workmen in tomorrow to plant trees, so you have all
got to be extra careful. No hanging clothes out to dry all over the place! There will be
screens put up along the line of the embankment and you are not to go running
around outside.’
‘Who’s the person in charge of the workmen?’ asked Ripple.
‘A young chap called “Yun” from up the Lane,’ said the old woman.
The name meant nothing to Ripple and Emerald, who went on to ask about other
matters; but Crimson knew it must be the young man she had met the day before in
the outer study.
Crimson’s surname was ‘Lin’. Her family had been retainers in the Jia family for
generations. Nowadays her father worked as a farm-bailiff on the family’s estates.
She was sixteen. Along with many other servants, she had originally entered the
Prospect Garden to carry out caretaking duties in the period when it was still
unoccupied. The part of it she was assigned to was the House of Green Delights. She
found it a very beautiful place to live in — very quiet and secluded. But this had
changed when Bao-yu and the girls were commanded to move in and Bao-yu had
chosen the House of Green Delights as his own residence.
Although Crimson was a very inexperienced maid, she had a measure of good looks
and a determination to better herself. She was therefore constantly on the look-out
for an opportunity of making herself known to Bao-yu and showing off her ability to
serve him. Unfortunately the little group of body-servants who had accompanied him
into the garden guarded their privileges with tooth and claw and were careful to
allow no toehold to an ambitious outsider. Today she had at last found an opening,
only to have her hopes immediately dashed by Ripple’s malice. She felt very
discouraged.
Still smarting with resentment, she heard the old woman say that Jia Yun was coming
next day into the garden. The name provoked a momentary flutter in her breast; but
she returned to her room with the same feeling of resentment bottled up inside her
and went to bed to ponder moodily on the events of the day. As the thoughts
pursued themselves round and round in her mind without object or conclusion, she
suddenly heard her name being called very softly outside her window:
‘Crimson! Crim! I’ve found your handkerchief!’ She quickly got up and went outside
to look. To her sur?prise it was Jia Yun. A maidenly confusion mantled her comely
cheek.
‘Where did you find it?’ she asked timidly.
Jia Yun laughed:
‘Come over here and I’ll show you!’
He took hold of her dress to pull her to him. Overcome with shame, she turned and
fled, but her foot caught on the thresh?old and she fell on her face.
The conclusion of this adventure will be revealed in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 25

Two cousins are subjected by witchcraft to
the assaults of demons
And the Magic Jade meets an old acquaintance while
rather the worse for wear

We have seen how Crimson, after lying a long time a prey to confused and troubled
thoughts, at last dozed off to sleep; and how later, when Jia Yun grabbed at her, she
turned and fled, only to stumble and fall on the threshold of her room. At that point
she woke in bed and discovered that she had been dreaming. She did not get to sleep
again after that, but lay tossing restlessly throughout the night.
When daylight came at last, she got up, and shortly after was joined by the other
maids who shared with her the early morning duties of sweeping the rooms and
courtyards and fetching water for the others’ washing.
Crimson’s own toilet was a simple one: a brief look in the mirror while she coiled her
hair, a quick wash, and she was ready to join the others in their sweeping.
Her encounter with Bao-yu had made a stronger impression on that impressionable
young man than she realized. He had even thought of asking for her by name to wait
upon him, but hesitated, partly from fear of offending Aroma and the rest, and partly
because he did not know what she was really like and dreaded the unpleasantness of
sending her away again if she proved unsatisfactory. The question still preoccupied
him when he woke that morning. He rose quite early and sat musing silently on his
own, making no effort to begin his toilet.
In a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see
clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside. He could
see several girls there sweeping, all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and
ornaments in their hair, but no sign of the quiet, neat girl of the day before. He went
outside in his slippers to look around, pretending that he had gone out to inspect the
flowers. He could see someone leaning on the balustrade in the south-west corner of
the cloister-like covered walk, but she was half hidden by the crab-apple tree and he
could not make out who it was. He approached and looked more closely. It was she,
yesterday’s girl, standing there on her own, apparently lost in thought. He was a little
shy of addressing her at that particular moment and was still hesi?tating when
Emerald came up and asked him to come in and wash. He had to go in again without
having spoken to her.
While Crimson stood there musing, she suddenly became aware that Aroma was
beckoning to her, and hurried up to see what she wanted.
‘Our spittoon is broken,’ Aroma said. ‘Can you go to Miss Lin’s and ask them if they
will lend us one until we can get a replacement?’
Crimson hurried off in the direction of the Naiad’s House. When she got to Green
Haze Bridge, she stopped a moment to look around. She noticed that cloth screens
had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill, and remembered that this was
the day on which the workmen were coming into the garden to plant trees. She could
just make out a knot of workmen digging a hole in the distance and Jia Yun sitting on
some rocks supervising them. She would have liked to go over, but did not quite dare,
and having collected the spit?toon, returned, in very low spirits, and lay down in her
own room to brood. The others all assumed that she must be feeling unwell and took
no notice.

*

Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-teng’s lady. A mes?sage had already been
received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day
with her. Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the
invitation was from her brother’s wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia
did not want to. Wang Zi-teng’s other sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with
his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until
the evening.
Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave
him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious
prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate
Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wang’s kang, called for a candle to be lit, and,
with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for
Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and
shortly after that informing Golden that she was standing in his light. The maids all
hated Jia Huan and took no notice — all, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a
soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was
engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly
counselled some restraint:
‘Try not to throw your weight about so!’ she said. ‘It’s silly to put people’s backs
up.’
Jia Huan scowled angrily:
‘I know what I’m doing,’ he said. ‘Don’t talk to me like a child! You’re friends with
Bao-yu nowadays, aren’t you? You don’t like me any more. I know. I’ve watched you
both.’
Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger:
‘You ungrateful thing! You’re like the dog that bit Lü Dong-bin: you don’t know a
friend when you see one.’
They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the
birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been
invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had
to eat and drink.
In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few re?spectful words to his mother,
asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with
his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mother’s bosom to be fondled
and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her
neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the day’s events.
‘You’ve been drinking again, child,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Your face is burning. All this
romping about will make you sick. Lie down quietly for a while over there!’
She made them bring him a head-rest, and he lay down behind her, towards the back
of the kang. Sunset was in?structed to massage him by gently patting his legs.
He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him, but she barely acknowledged his
questions and answered frigidly, directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia
Huan. Bao-yu seized her hand:
‘Come, my dear! You must take notice of me if I speak to you!’
He tugged at her hand as he spoke, but she snatched it from his grasp.
‘If you do that again,’ she said, ‘I shall call out!’
Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange. He had always hated Bao-yu, and this
flirting with Sunset — his Sunset — was the last straw. He must be revenged or burst.
A moment’s reflection suggested the means. He had only to feign a slight clumsiness
of the hand and it was done. The candle, brimming with molten wax, toppled straight
on to Bao-yu’s face. There was a piercing cry, which made everyone else in the room
jump. Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below. By their light
Bao-yu’s face was seen to be covered all over in wax. Torn between anguish for him
and anger with Jia Huan, Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as
possible, while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness. Xi-feng
scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants, grumbling at Jia Huan as she did
so:
‘Huan, you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met! You are simply not
fit for decent company. I don’t know why Aunt Zhao hasn’t taught you better.’
Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the
servants. She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and, summoning Aunt Zhao, directed
all her wrath upon that luckless concubine:
‘This is a fine son you bore us, I must say! He is a black-?hearted little monster! You
might at least try to teach him better. But no. Time and again I have overlooked this
sort of thing, but instead of feeling sorry, you glory in it. You think that when I do
nothing, you have got the better of me.’
Aunt Zhao was obliged to swallow her anger and endure these taunts in silence. She
climbed up onto the kang and made a show of helping the others with the injured
boy. She looked at his face. The whole left side of it was badly blistered. It was a
wonder that the eye had not been damaged. When Lady Wang saw it, she was both
full of anguish for her son and at the same time, when she thought of the
questioning to which she would inevitably be subjected by Grandmother Jia and
wondered what she would say, terrified on her own account. To relieve her fear she
turned once more on Aunt Zhao. Then, after tongue-lashing the concubine, she
comforted her beloved son and applied Antiphlogistic Ointment to the blistered part
of his face.
‘It does hurt a bit,’ said Bao-yu when she asked him, ‘but nothing very terrible.
When Grandma asks about it, we had better tell her that I did it.’
‘She’ll blame the rest of us for not looking after you properly, even if you say you
did it yourself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There’ll be a row, whatever you say.’
Lady Wang told them to see him back to his room. It was a great shock to Aroma and
the other maids when they saw him.
Dai-yu had had a dull time of it with Bao-yu away all day, and in the course of the
evening sent several times round to his room to inquire whether he was back yet. It
was in this way that she heard about his scalding. She hurried round immediately to
see for herself how he was.
She found him with a mirror in his hand, examining the extent of the damage. The
entire left side of his face was thickly plastered with ointment, from which she
deduced that the injury must be a serious one. But when she approached him to look
closer, he averted his head and waved her away. He knew how squeamish she was,
and feared that the sight of it would upset her. Dai-yu for her part was sufficiently
aware of her own weakness not to insist on looking. She merely asked him ‘whether
it hurt very badly’.
‘Not so bad as all that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘A couple of days and it will probably be all
right again.’
Dai-yu sat with him a little longer and then went back to her room.
Next day Bao-yu had to see Grandmother Jia. Although he told her that he had
burned himself through his own carelessness, the old lady, as had been predicted,
berated his attendants for having allowed the accident to happen.
Another day went by, and Bao-yu’s godmother, old Mother Ma, called round. Mother
Ma was a Wise Woman. Her special relationship with Bao-yu had been arranged in
his infancy to ensure him the protection of her powers. She was shocked by her
godson’s appearance and, on being informed of the cause, shook her head and
tutted sympathetically. She made a few signs over his face with her fingers, muttering
some gibberish as she did so, after which she assured them that he would soon be
better the malignant aura that had caused the accident was of a transitory,
impermanent nature. She turned to Grand?mother Jia:
‘Bless you, my lucky lady! Bless you dearie! You don’t know a half of the unseen
harms and dangers the Scripture tells us of. All the sons of princes and great folks the
moment they begin to grow up are followed round everywhere they go by troops of
invisible little imps—spiteful little creatures who nip them and pinch them whenever
they can. Sometimes they knock the rice bowl from their hands when they’re eating.
Sometimes they push them over when they are walking. It’s on account of these
creatures that so many young gentlemen of good family don’t live to make old
bones.’
Grandmother Jia was anxious to know if the afflicted person could be freed from
these unwelcome attentions.
‘Easily,’ said Mother Ma. ‘By doing good works. Giving a bit more to charity on the
young person’s behalf. There is another way, though. According to what the Scripture
says, there’s a Bodhisattva of Universal Light living in the Para?dise of the West who
spends his time lighting up the dark places where these evil spirits lurk, and if any
believer, male or female, will make offerings to that Bodhisattva in a proper spirit of
devoutness, he will grant their children and grandchildren his holy peace and protect
them from possession by devils and from the powers of darkness.’
‘What sort of offerings do you make to this Bodhisattva?’ Grandmother Jia asked
her.
‘Nothing very special. Apart from the usual incense offerings, we take a few pounds
of sesame oil each day and make what we call a “sea of light” by burning wicks in it.
We believe that this sea of light is the trans-substantial body of the Bodhisattva. It
has to be kept burning night and day and never allowed to go out.’
‘How much oil does it take to keep it burning for one whole day and night?’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘I should like to do this for the boy.’
‘There’s no fixed amount,’ said Mother Ma. ‘We leave it to our clients to decide
how much they want to give. There are several members of the aristocracy among
those I do this service for. Let’s see … There’s the Prince of An-nan’s lady. She’s my
biggest subscriber. Her subscription is for forty-eight pounds of oil and a pound of
lampwicks a day. Her sea of light is pretty nearly as big as a cistern. Then there’s the
Marquis of Jin-xiang’s lady: twenty pounds of oil a day. Oh, and there’s some pays for
ten pounds a day, some for eight pounds, three pounds, five pounds - all sorts. All of
them I keep their seas of light burning for them, back at my house.’
Grandmother Jia nodded thoughtfully.
‘One thing I should mention,’ said Mother Ma (observing the thoughtfulness): ‘if
the offering is for an older person — a mother or father, say — it doesn’t matter how
much you subscribe; but if it’s an older person making it for a younger one, like as it
may be Your Ladyship for Bao-yu, you don’t want to subscribe too much, or it would
overload his luck and have the opposite effect. In the case of Your Ladyship
subscribing for Bao-yu, I should suggest between five and seven pounds a day.’
‘Make it five pounds a day, then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We’ll work out the total
and send you a month’s supply every month.’
‘Amitabha, Merciful Buddha! Bless His Holy Name!’ said Mother Ma.
As a further precaution Grandmother Jia called in some of Bao-yu’s maids and told
them that in future whenever Bao-yu went out anywhere his pages were to be
provided with several strings of cash to give as alms to any itinerant monks or priests
or any poor or afflicted persons they might meet upon the way.
After seeing Grandmother Jia, Mother Ma drifted round the mansion calling at
various other apartments. Presently she came to Aunt Zhao’s room. After they had
exchanged greetings, Aunt Zhao told her little servant to pour the old woman a cup
of tea. Aunt Zhao was pasting pieces of cloth together for soling shoes with, and
Mother Ma observed that the kang around her was piled with miscellaneous
remnants of material.
‘I’m looking for something to make a pair of uppers out of, dearie,’ said Mother Ma.
‘I suppose you haven’t got an old bit of silk or an old bit of satin that would do? It
doesn’t matter about the colour.’
Aunt Zhao heaved a long-suffering sigh:
‘Take a look at this lot! You won’t find anything much worth having here. Nothing
worth having in this family ever comes my way. But you’re welcome to pick out a
couple of pieces if you don’t mind the poor quality.’
Mother Ma rummaged around in the heap, and having picked out several pieces,
stuffed them into her sleeve.
‘I sent someone round to you the other day with five hundred cash to pay for an
offering to the Medicine Bud?dha,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘Have you managed to make it
yet?’
‘Oh yes. That was done days ago.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’d do it oftener if things were a bit easier; but you
know the saying: “my heart is willing but my purse is lean”.’
‘Don’t you worry about that!’ said Mother Ma. ‘You only have to hold out a few
more years. When your Huan has grown up and got himself a job in the Service,
you’ll be able to afford all the good works you want.’
Aunt Zhao made a scornful sound in her nose:
‘Hfn! Let’s not talk about it! It’ll be no different then from what it is now: Huan and
I will never be able to compete with the Other One. It’s like the Heavenly Dragon
appearing when he comes on the scene. Mind you, I don’t hold it against the child.
He’s a good-looking boy, is Bao-yu, and you can understand the grown-ups being silly
about him. No, this is the one I can’t stand.’
As she uttered the word ‘this’, she held up two fingers. Mother Ma guessed her
meaning: ‘Number Two’ — the youn?ger of the Rong mansion’s two
daughters-in-law.
‘You mean Mrs Lian?’ she said.
Aunt Zhao’s face assumed an expression of terror. Motion?ing agitatedly to the other
to remain silent, she got up, went to the door, raised the door-blind, looked around,
and having satisfied herself that there were no eavesdroppers, came back and sat
down again, her face close to Mother Ma’s.
‘She’s a dreadful person — dreadful! If that woman doesn’t end up by carrying off
every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with, my name’s
not Zhao!’
Mother Ma sensed interesting possibilities in this conver?sation, and was quick to
explore them:
‘It doesn’t need you to tell me that,’ she said. ‘You surely don’t think I haven’t
noticed that? I’ve often wondered why you all let her get away with it — though I
suppose it’s probably just as well you do.’
‘My dear good woman,’ said Aunt Zhao, ‘we’ve no choice but to let her get away
with it. Who would ever have the nerve to stand up to her?
‘Well,’ said Mother Ma, ‘I don’t want to seem a trouble-maker, but if you don’t
mind my saying so, you do all seem to have acted a hit helpless about her — not that
I’m blaming you, mind. But I mean to say, even if you daren’t stand up to her openly,
there are things you could do in secret. I’m surprised you haven’t thought of it
before.’
To Aunt Zhao the words seemed to contain a hidden promise. She concealed her
pleasure.
‘What do you mean: “things we could do in secret”?’ she said. ‘I’m willing enough
to do them: it’s just that I’ve never met anyone who could tell me how. If you would
show me the way, I’d pay you. I’d pay a lot.’
Mother Ma could see that they understood each other, but she was taking no
chances.
‘Holy Name! Don’t ask me about things like that! I don’t touch that kind of business.
No, no, no. That’s wicked.’
There you are!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘That’s all the help I ever get. And I thought you were
such a kind person, always helping those in trouble. Are you prepared to stand by
and watch me and my Huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman? I
suppose it’s because you think I wouldn’t pay you.’
‘If you was to say that I am too tender-hearted to stand by and watch you and your
boy being wronged,’ said Mother Ma, ‘you would be saying no more nor less than the
truth. But I don’t know what you mean about pay. What have you got that you could
tempt me with, dearie, even if I was willing to do it for pay?’
Aunt Zhao observed that her opposition to the very idea of helping her in the desired
way had considerably weakened.
‘For someone so clever,’ she said, ‘aren’t you being rather stupid? If you help me
and it works, with the two of them safely out of the way, everything in this
household will be ours. You’ll be able to ask for what you like. Fancy not thinking of
that!’
Mother Ma lowered her head and reflected for a while in silence.
‘When that time comes and you’re safely landed,’ she said eventually, ‘you won’t
want to have anything more to do with me, dearie — not when I’ve got no proof to
show what I done for you.’
‘That’s no problem,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’ve got a few taels put by of my own savings,
and I’ve got some dresses, and there’s my jewellery. You can take some of each to be
getting on with and I can give you an IOU promising to pay you so much later on. We
can have a witness too, if you like.’
‘Are you sure?’
‘Why should I tell a lie?’ said Aunt Zhao, and summoned a trusted crone into whose
ear she whispered instructions:
‘Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps.’
The old crone nodded and went out, returning after a few minutes with a promissory
note for five hundred taels of silver. Aunt Zhao made her mark on it and then went to
the wardrobe to get out her savings. The white shine of silver and the signed and
sealed IOU dispelled whatever residual doubts the Wise Woman may have
entertained, for she seized and pocketed both with alacrity, giving hearty assurances
of her aid as she did so; then, after rummaging for some time in the capacious
waistband of her trousers, she fished out twelve little paper cut-out figures — ten of
them demons with green faces and red hair and two of them plain human figures —
and handed them to Aunt Zhao. Dropping her voice to a whisper, she instructed her
to write the eight symbols of her victims’ nativity — two for the year, two for the
month, two for the day and two for the hour — on each of the human figures, wrap
five of the demons round each of them, and slip them some?where under her
victims’ beds.
‘That’s all you have to do,’ she said. ‘I shall be doing other things at home to help
you. It’s sure to work - no question of that. But you must be very, very careful. And
you mustn’t be afraid.’
While she was still talking, one of Lady Wang’s maids came in looking for her.
‘Oh, here you are! Her Ladyship is waiting for you.’ Mother Ma went off in the
company of the maid.
And there we leave her.

*

Because of the injury to his face, Bao-yu had stopped going out of doors since his
accident and Dai-yu spent a good deal of time in his apartment talking to him.
One morning after lunch she had settled down to read, but after a couple of chapters
grew bored with the book and did some sewing instead with the maids Nightingale
and Snowgoose. When that, too, became boring, she stood for a while leaning
against the doorway, vacantly looking out. The young bamboo shoots were just
breaking through in the forecourt, and after inspecting them, she drifted out into the
Garden. Everywhere the flowers were blooming, the birds were singing, and the
water splashed and tinkled, but not a human soul was to be seen. Almost without
thinking where she was going, she made her way to the House of Green Delights. A
group of maids had fetched some water from the well and were watching the
white-eyes in the gallery giving themselves a bath. A sound of laughter came from
inside the house. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-chai were there already. Their friendly
laughter greeted Dai-yu as she entered:
‘Another one! Come in! Come in!’
‘What is this?’ said Dai-yu, joining in the good humour. ‘A party?’
‘I sent someone round to you the other day with two caddies-full of tea,’ said
Xi-feng, ‘but you were out.’
‘Yes,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m sorry: I forgot to thank you.’
‘Have you tried it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘What did you think of it?’
‘I wouldn’t ask, if I were you,’ said Bao-yu, chipping in. ‘I thought it was rotten. I
don’t know what the rest of you thought about it.’
‘I thought the flavour was all right,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The colour wasn’t up to much.’
‘That was tribute tea from Siam,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I didn’t like it at all. I thought it
wasn’t as nice as the tea we drink every day.’
‘Oh, I quite liked it,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Your palates must be more sensitive than mine.’
‘If you really like it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you’re welcome to have mine.’
‘I’ve still got quite a bit left,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If you really like it, you can have it all.’
‘Thank you very much,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll send someone round to fetch it.’
‘No, don’t do that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll send it round to you. There’s something I want
you to do for me. The person I send round about it can bring the tea as well.’
Dai-yu laughed mockingly:
‘Do you hear that, everybody? Because she’s given me a hit of her old tea, I have to
start doing odd jobs for her.’
‘That’s fair enough,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You know the rule:
“drink the family’s tea, the family’s bride-to-be”.’
Everyone laughed at this except Dai-yu, who turned her head away, blushing furiously,
and said nothing.
‘Cousin Feng will have her little joke,’ Li Wan observed to Bao-chai with a smile.
‘Do you call that a joke?’ said Dai-yu. ‘It was a silly, idle remark, and very irritating.’
She gave a snort of disgust by way of reinforcement.
Xi-feng laughed:
‘What’s so irritating about it? Look at him!’ — She pointed at Bao-yu - ‘Isn’t he
good enough for you? Good looks, good family, good income. There are no snags
that I can see. It’s a perfect match!’
Dai-yu rose and fled.
‘Oh, Frowner’s in a rage! Come back Frowner!’ Bao-chai called out after her. ‘If you
go, it will spoil all the fun.’
She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back. At the doorway they ran into Jia
Zheng’s two concubines, Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou, come to see Bao-yu. Li Wan,
Bao-chai and Bao-yu made them welcome and invited them to sit down and talk, but
Xi-feng and Dai-yu conversed with each other and rather pointedly ignored them.
Bao-chai was in the middle of saying something to the rest of the group when a maid
arrived from Lady Wang’s to say that Wang Zi-teng’s wife had come and the presence
of the young ladies was requested. Li Wan and Xi-feng rose to go. Aunt Zhao and
Aunt Zhou hurriedly took their leave.
‘I can’t go out,’ said Bao-yu. ‘For heaven’s sake don’t let Aunt Wang come over here!
- Cousin Lin!’ he called to Dai-yu. ‘Stay here a bit! There’s something I want to say to
you.’
Hearing him, Xi-feng turned back to address Dai-yu:
‘Do you hear that? Someone wants a word with you. You’d better go back and see
what he wants to say!’
She gave her a push in the direction of the house; then she and Li Wan went off, both
laughing.
When they were alone together, Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand. He smiled and
smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away.
‘Aiyo!’ he said. ‘My head!’
‘Good!’ said Dai-yu. ‘It serves you right!’
Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, jumped two or three feet into the air, and began
to shout and babble deliriously. Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell
Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-teng’s lady was with them and hurried
over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several
times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother
were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling.
Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried out to him piteously between their sobs:
‘my son!’, ‘my child!’, ‘my darling!’
Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the
household next door and Jia She, Lady Xing, Cousin Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong,
Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue and Xue Pan — not to mention Zhou Rui’s wife and a great
bevy of domestics both high and low — came hurrying into the garden, adding
numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators.
While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu, Xi-feng appeared,
brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path.
She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now, seeing people
ahead, glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou
Rui’s wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while
the others looked on helplessly, clasped her about the arms and body, wrested the
knife from her hand, and carried her off to her room. Patience and Felicity wept
piteously to see their mistress in such a state.
On this occasion even Jia Zheng’s customary impassivity seemed to have deserted
him, as he turned this way and that, uncertain on whom to direct his attention. And if
Jia Zheng was distraught, the state of the others can be imagined. Most remarkable,
perhaps, was the. spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk, one moment
afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush, the next that Bao-chai might be
ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male. Cousin Zhen, he knew for a fact,
was a notorious womanizer. Then he caught sight of Dai-yu (whom he had never seen
before) and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty.
Although no one knew what to do themselves, there were a great many opinions
about what ought to be done. Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the
malignant spirits, some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out, some
offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master
and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff; yet in spite of prayers, incantations,
divin?ation, and all the expedients that faith and physic could pro?vide, there was no
visible improvement in the condition of the patients. At sundown Wang Zi-teng’s lady
took her leave and went home.
Next day she made another visit to inquire after them. This was followed by visits
from the wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew the Marquis, from Lady Xing’s brothers’
wives, and from the wives of other marriage connections of the family. Bottled
charm-water, wonder-working monks and Taoists and highly recommended
physicians were also sent round to the mansion by various friends and relations.
But the cousins continued delirious and lay on their beds burning with fever and
babbling incomprehensibly. At nightfall they became even worse, so that the maids
and even the older women no longer dared go near them. The two of them had to be
carried into Lady Wang’s room on their beds and set down there side by side so that
Jia Yun and a group of pages could watch over them in shifts throughout the night.
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Aunt Xue stayed near at hand, refusing
to budge, though unable to do anything but sit by and weep. Jia She and Jia Zheng,
afraid that their mother’s health would suffer, displayed their con?cern by keeping
themselves and everyone else up throughout most of the night. There were lights
burning everywhere and hardly anyone slept at all.
Jia She continued to hunt everywhere for monks and ex?orcists reputed able to cure
diseases of the mind. Finally, Jia Zheng, who saw that their methods were all useless,
lost patience with him and tried to make him stop:
‘Young people will die if they must. Nothing can alter fate. And that they are fated
to die would appear from the fact that all efforts to cure them have been unavailing. I
think we should allow them to die in peace.’
But Jia She took no notice, and the commotion continued as before.
By the third day the patients were so weakened that they lay on their beds
motionless and their breathing was scarcely perceptible. The whole family had by
now abandoned hope and were already making preparations for their laying-out.
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Jia Lian, Patience and Aroma had cried themselves into
a state bordering on prostration. Only Aunt Zhao was cheerful — though she did her
best to look miserable.
Early on the fourth day Bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to
Grandmother Jia:
‘From now on I can no longer stay in this family. You must get my things ready and
let me go.’
To the old lady the words were a tearing of heart from body; but Aunt Zhao, who also
heard them, had the temerity to urge their acceptance:
‘Your Ladyship shouldn’t take it so hard. It’s already all up with the boy. We should
be getting his grave clothes ready so that he can go in peace. It will be better that
way. If we won’t let him go now, when he’s ready, it will only make more suffering for
him in the world to come…’
She would have gone on, but Grandmother Jia spat in her face. No empty gesture: it
was a full gob of spittle.
‘Evil woman! May your tongue rot! How do you know it’s all up with him? You want
him to die, don’t you? But if you think you will gain by his death, you must be
dreaming; because if he does die, I shall hold you responsible. It’s your spiteful
meddling that has forced him to do all this studying. You have reduced the poor child
to such a state that the mere sight of his father makes him more scared than a mouse
with the cat after it. You have done this, you and the others of your kind. And now I
suppose, if you succeed in murdering him, you will be satisfied. But don’t imagine
you will escape me — any of you!’
She railed and wept. Jia Zheng was close at hand while she was saying all this and
was deeply distressed by it. Per?emptorily dismissing the concubine, he tried to calm
his mother and reasoned against the injustice of her charges.
It was unfortunate that just at that moment a servant should have come in to
announce that ‘the two coffins that had been ordered were now ready’. The words
were as oil upon fire. The old lady blazed.
‘Who gave orders for those coffins to be made? Where is the man who made them?
Go and get the man who made those coffins! Flog him to death!’
Suddenly, as she raged and stormed, the faint tock tock of a holy man’s wooden fish
was heard upon the air and a high monotone chant that kept time with the beat:
‘Na-mah A-mi-ta-bha Bo-dhi-satt-va!
Mer-ci-ful de-li-ve-rer!
All a-fflic-ted and tor-men-ted,
               All a-ttacked by e-vil spi-rits,
        All de-mo-ni-ac po-sse-ssion,
        I cure,
        I cure,
        I cure.’

Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang at once sent someone into the street to see who it
was. The source of the chanting proved to be a disreputable-looking Buddhist monk.
Stone describes him in the following quatrain:

A bottle nose he had and shaggy brows,
Through which peeped eyes that twinkled like bright Stats.
His robe was patched and torn, his feet straw-shod,
His unclean pate blotched with unsightly scars.

He was accompanied by a lame Taoist, for whom a similar quatrain has been supplied
by our poetical Stone:

Up, down he hopped on his unequal legs,
From mud and puddle not a stitch left dry.
Yet, if you asked him where his dwelling was,
‘Westward of Paradise’ he would reply.

Jia Zheng had them invited in and asked them what monas?tery they were from. The
monk was genially dismissive:
‘There is no need for Your Worship to waste time on formalities. Suffice it to say
that I heard you had sickness in this house and have come to cure it.
‘Two members of this family have, indeed, fallen victims to some kind of
witchcraft,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Might one inquire what charm you intend to cure them
with?’
‘Charm?’ The monk laughed. ‘You already possess in your own house a precious
object capable of curing them. What other charm is necessary?’
Jia Zheng gave a start.
‘To be sure. My son was born with a piece of jade whose inscription makes some
such claim - “Dispels the harms of witchcraft”. But as you see, it does not appear to
possess the power it lays claim to.’
‘That is because the world and its temptations have confused it,’ said the monk. ‘It
certainly used to have the power. If you will have the goodness to fetch it for me and
allow me to hold it in my hand and say a wee prayer over it, I think I can undertake to
bring the power back again.’
Jia Zheng took the Magic Jade from Bao-yu’s neck and handed it to the monk, who
held it on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a sigh:
‘Thirteen years, old friend, since we first met under Green-sickness Peak! Time
certainly flies. But you have not finished with this world yet, you know. Dear, dear,
dear! You aren’t the Stone you were, are you?


—Time was you lived in perfect liberty,
Your heart alike from joy and sorrow free,
Till, by the smelter’s alchemy transformed,
Into the world you came to purchase misery.

By the bye, I am sorry you have been having such a disagree?able experience these
last few days.


—Vain sensual joys the jade’s sheen have besmirched;
The poor bird droops, in its close prison perched.
From drunken dreaming one day you’ll recover:
Then, when all debts are paid, the play will soon be over.’

When the monk had finished apostrophizing the stone, he rubbed it and polished it
between his hands and muttered some strange-sounding words over it.
‘There! Its power has now been restored.’ He handed it back to Jia Zheng. ‘But you
must be careful that it does not become contaminated again. Hang it above the
threshold of the bedroom and let no women apart from the patient’s own mother
and grandmother go inside. If you will do that, I can guarantee a complete recovery
in thirty-three days.’
Jia Zheng would have liked to detain the monk for tea and offer him some
remuneration, but he and the Taoist slipped quietly away and could not be traced.
The monk’s directions were scrupulously followed. Lady Wang guarded the doorway
in person and prevented any unauthorized person from getting into the bedroom. By
evening the sufferers had regained consciousness and said they were hungry. This
news, so precious to the ears of Lady Jia and Lady Wang, who at once had rice gruel
brought in to feed them with, was relayed to the girls in the outer room.
‘Bless His Holy Name!’ Dai-yu murmured fervently.
Bao-chai laughed, but said nothing. The others were mystified.
‘Why do you laugh, Cousin Bao?’ Xi-chun asked her.
‘I was thinking how busy He of the Holy Name must be,’ Bao-chai said. ‘Apart from
working for the salvation of all sentient beings, He has to protect the sick and hasten
their recovery — not to mention watching over plighted couples to make sure that
they marry and live happily ever after. What a lot He has to keep Him busy! Don’t you
find the thought rather amusing?’
Dai-yu affected scorn, but was blushing hotly.
‘You are all horrid. Instead of following good examples, you all imitate Feng and
make nasty, cheap jokes all the time.’
She raised the portiere and went out.
But if you wish to know more, you will have to wait for the next chapter.




CHAPTER 26

A conversation on Wasp Waist Bridge is a cover for
communication of a different kind
And a soliloquy overhead in the Naiad’s House reveals
unsuspected depths of feeling

By the time the thirty-three days’ convalescence had ended, not only were Bao-yu’s
health and strength completely restored, but even the burn-marks on his face had
vanished, and he was allowed to move back into the Garden.
It may be recalled that when Bao-yu’s sickness was at its height, it had been found
necessary to call in Jia Yun with a number of pages under his command to take turns
in watch?ing over him. Crimson was there too at that time, having been brought in
with the other maids from his apartment. During those few days she and Jia Yun
therefore had ample opportunity of seeing each other, and a certain familiarity
began to grow up between them.
Crimson noticed that Jia Yun was often to be seen sporting a handkerchief very much
like the one she had lost. She nearly asked him about it, but in the end was too shy.
Then, after the monk’s visit, the presence of the menfolk was no longer required and
Jia Yun went back to his tree-planting. Though Crimson could still not dismiss the
matter entirely from her mind, she did not ask anyone about it for fear of arousing
their suspicions.
A day or two after their return to Green Delights, Crimson was sitting in her room,
still brooding over this handkerchief business, when a voice outside the window
inquired whether she was in. Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she
recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself.
‘Yes, I’m in,’ she said. ‘Come inside!’
Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle.
‘I’m in luck!’ she said. ‘I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked
for some tea to be taken round to Miss Lin’s for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job
of taking it. When I got there, Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old
Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids, so when she saw me she just said
“Here you are!” and gave me two big handfuls of it. I’ve no idea how much it is. Will
you look after it for me, please?’
She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins. Crimson carefully
counted them for her and put them away in a safe place.
‘What’s been the matter with you lately?’ said Melilot. ‘If you ask me, I think you
ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some
medicine.’
‘Silly!’ said Crimson. ‘I’m perfectly all right. What should I want to go home for?’
‘I know what, then,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Lin’s very weakly. She’s always taking
medicine. Why don’t you ask her to give you some of hers? It would probably do just
as well.’
‘Oh, nonsense!’ said Crimson. ‘You can’t take other peo?ple’s medicines just like
that!’
‘Well, you can’t go on in this way,’ said Melilot, ‘never eating or drinking properly.
What will become of you?
‘Who cares?’ said Crimson. ‘The sooner I’m dead the better!’
‘You shouldn’t say such things,’ said Melilot, ‘It isn’t right.’
‘Why not?’ said Crimson. ‘How do you know what is on my mind?
Melilot shook her head sympathetically.
‘I can’t say I really blame you,’ she said. ‘Things are very difficult here at times. Take
yesterday, for example. Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and
there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery, all those who had the trouble of
nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades. Well
now, I can understand the very young ones like me not being included, but why
should they leave you out? I felt really sorry for you when I heard that they’d left you
out. Aroma, of course, you’d expect to get more than anyone else. I don’t blame her
at all. In fact, I think it’s owing to her. Let’s be honest: none of us can compare with
Aroma. I mean, even if she didn’t always take so much trouble over everything, no
one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share. What makes me so angry
is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when every?one
knows they’re only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu. Doesn’t it make you
angry?’
‘I don’t see much point in getting angry,’ said Crimson. ‘You know what they said
about the mile-wide marquee: “Even the longest party must have an end”? Well,
none of us is here for ever, you know. Another four or five years from now when
we’ve each gone our different ways it won’t matter any longer what all the rest of us
are doing.’
Little Melilot found this talk of parting and impermanence vaguely affecting and a
slight moisture was to be observed about her eyes. She thought shame to cry
without good cause, however, and masked her emotion with a smile:
‘That’s perfectly true. Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things he’s
going to do to his rooms and the clothes he’s going to have made and everything, just
as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in.’
Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilot’s simplicity or at Bao-yu’s
improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came
running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl’s horns. She was
carrying some patterns and sheets of paper.
‘You’re to copy out these two patterns.’
She threw them in Crimson’s direction and straightway darted out again. Crimson
shouted after her:
‘Who are they for, then? You might at least finish your message before rushing off.
What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for
you and you’re afraid they’ll get cold?’
‘They’re for Mackerel.’ The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer
through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam,
plim-plam, plim-plam, as fast as she had come.
Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a
brush to trace them with. After rummaging for several minutes she had only
succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use.
‘Funny!’ she said. ‘I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day ...’
She thought a bit, then laughed at herself as she remembered:
‘Of course. Oriole took it, the evening before last.’ She turned to Melilot. ‘Would
you go and get it for me, then?’
‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Aroma’s waiting for me to fetch some boxes
for her. You’ll have to get it yourself.’
‘If Aroma’s waiting for you, why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time?’
said Crimson. ‘If I hadn’t asked you to go and get it, she wouldn’t have been waiting,
would she? Lazy little beast!’
She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of
Bao-chai’s courtyard. She was just passing by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when she
caught sight of Bao-yu’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Li, coming from the opposite direction
and stood respectfully aside to wait for her.
‘Where have you been, Mrs Li?’ she asked her. ‘I didn’t expect to see you here.’
Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand:
‘What do you think, my dear: His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who
does the tree-planting — “Yin” or “Yun” or whatever his name is — so Nannie has to
go and ask him in. Let’s hope Their Ladyships don’t find out about it. There’ll be
trouble if they do.’
‘Are you really going to ask him in?’
‘Yes. Why?’
Crimson laughed:
‘If your Mr Yun knows what’s good for him, he won’t agree to come.’
‘He’s no fool,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Why shouldn’t he?’
‘Any way, if he does come in,’ said Crimson, ignoring her question, ‘you can’t just
bring him in and then leave him, Mrs Li. You’ll have to take him back again yourself
afterwards. You don’t want him wandering off on his own. There’s no knowing who
he might bump into.’
(Crimson herself, was the secret hope.)
‘Gracious me! I haven’t got that much spare time,’ said Nannie Li. ‘All I’ve done is
just to tell him that he’s got to come. I’ll send someone else to fetch him in when I
get back presently - one of the girls, or one of the older women, maybe.’
She hobbled off on her stick, leaving Crimson standing there in a muse, her mission
to fetch the tracing-brush mo?mentarily forgotten. She was still standing there a
minute or two later when a little maid came along, who, seeing that it was Crimson,
asked her what she was doing there. Crimson looked up. It was Trinket, another of
the maids from Green Delights.
‘Where are you going?’ Crimson asked her.
‘I’ve been sent to fetch Mr Yun,’ said Trinket. ‘I have to bring him inside to meet
Master Bao.’
She ran off on her way.
At the gate to Wasp Waist Bridge Crimson ran into Trinket again, this time with Jia
Yun in tow. His eyes sought Crim?son’s; and hers, as she made pretence of conversing
with Trinket, sought his. Their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished; then
Crimson felt herself blushing, and turning away abruptly, she made off for Allspice
Court.

*
Our narrative now follows Jia Yun and Trinket along the winding pathway to the
House of Green Delights. Soon they were at the courtyard gate and Jia Yun waited
outside while she went in to announce his arrival. She returned presently to lead him
inside.
There were a few scattered rocks in the courtyard and some clumps of jade-green
plantain. Two storks stood in the shadow of a pine-tree, preening themselves with
their long bills. The gallery surrounding the courtyard was hung with cages of unusual
design in which perched or fluttered a wide variety of birds, some of them
gay-plumaged exotic ones. Above the steps was a little five-frame penthouse building
with a glimpse of delicately-carved partitions visible through the open doorway,
above which a horizontal board hung, inscribed with the words

CRIMSON JOYS AND GREEN DELIGHTS


‘So that’s why it’s called “The House of Green Delights”’ Jia Yun told himself. ‘The
name is taken from the inscription.’
A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements:
‘Come on in! It must be two or three months since I first forgot our appointment!’
Jia Yun recognized the voice as Bao-yu’s and hurried up the steps inside. He looked
about him, dazzled by the bril?liance of gold and semi-precious inlay-work and the
richness of the ornaments and furnishings, but unable to see Bao-yu in the midst of it
all. To the left of him was a full-length mirror from behind which two girls now
emerged, both about fifteen or sixteen years old and of much the same build and
height. They addressed him by name and asked him to come inside. Slightly
overawed, he muttered something in reply and hurried after them, not daring to take
more than a furtive glance at them from the corner of his eye. They ushered him into
a tent-like summer ‘cabinet’ of green net, whose principal furniture was a tiny
lacquered bed with crimson hangings heavily patterned in gold. On this Bao-yu,
wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers, was reclining, book in hand.
He threw the book down as Jia Yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming
smile. Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting. Bidden to sit, he
modestly placed himself on a bedside chair.
‘After I invited you round to my study that day,’ said Bao-yu, ‘a whole lot of things
seemed to happen one after the other, and I’m afraid I quite forgot about your visit.’
Jia Yun returned his smile:
‘Let’s just say that it wasn’t my luck to see you then. But you have been ill since
then, Uncle Bao. Are you quite better now?’
‘Quite better, thank you. I hear you’ve been very busy these last few days.’
‘That’s as it should be,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But I’m glad you are better, Uncle. That’s a
piece of good fortune for all of us.’
As they chatted, a maid came in with some tea. Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she
approached, but his eyes were on her. She was tall and rather thin with a long oval
face, and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt
and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress.
In the course of his brief sojourn among them in the early days of Bao-yu’s illness, Jia
Yun had got by heart the names of most of the principal females of Bao-yu’s
establishment. He knew at a glance that the maid now serving him tea was Aroma.
He was also aware that she was in some way more important than the other maids
and that to be waited on by her in the seated presence of her master was an honour.
Jumping hastily to his feet he addressed her with a modest smile:
‘You shouldn’t pour tea for me, Miss! I’m not like a visitor here. You should let me
pour for myself!’
‘Oh do sit down!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t have to be like that in front of the maids!’
‘I know,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But a body-servant! I don’t like to presume.’
He sat down, nevertheless, and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a
number of unimportant topics. He told him which household kept the best troupe of
players, which had the finest gardens, whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the
best parties, and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets. Jia
Yun did his best to keep up with him. After a while Bao-yu showed signs of flagging,
and when Jia Yun, observing what appeared to be fatigue, rose to take his leave, he
did not very strongly press him to stay.
‘You must come again when you can spare the time,’ said Bao-yu, and ordered
Trinket to see him out of the Garden.
Once outside the gateway of Green Delights, Jia Yun looked around him on all sides,
and having ascertained that there was no one else about, slowed down to a more
dawdling pace so that he could ask Trinket a few questions. Indeed, the little maid
was subjected to quite a catechism: How old was she? What was her name? What
did her father and mother do? How many years had she been working for his Uncle
Bao? How much pay did she get a month? How many girls were there working for
him altogether? Trinket seemed to have no objection, however, and answered each
question as it came.
‘That girl you were talking to on the way in,’ he said, ‘isn’t her name “Crimson”?’
Trinket laughed:
‘Yes. Why do you ask?’
‘I heard her asking you about a handkerchief. Only it just so happens that I picked
one up.’
Trinket showed interest.
‘She’s asked me about that handkerchief of hers a number of times. I told her, I’ve
got better things to do with my time than go looking for people’s handkerchiefs. But
when she asked me about it again today, she said that if I could find it for her, she’d
give me a reward. Come to think of it, you were there when she said that, weren’t
you? It was when we were outside the gate of Allspice Court. So you can bear me out.
Oh Mr Jia, please let me have it if you’ve picked it up and I’ll be able to see what she
will give me for it!’
Jia Yun had picked up a silk handkerchief a month pre?viously at the time when his
tree-planting activities had just started. He knew that it must have been dropped by
one or another of the female inmates of the Garden, but not knowing which, had not
so far ventured to do anything about his dis?covery. When earlier on he had heard
Crimson question Trinket about her loss, he had realized, with a thrill of pleasure,
that the handkerchief he had picked up must have been hers. Trinket’s request now
gave him just the opening he required. He drew a handkerchief of his own from
inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile:
‘I’ll give it to you on one condition. If she lets you have this reward you were
speaking of; you’ve got to let me know. No cheating, mind!’
Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed
of the outcome, and having seen him out of the Garden, went back again to look for
Crimson.

*

Our narrative returns now to Bao-yu.
After disposing of Jia Yun, Bao-yu continued to feel ex?tremely lethargic and lay back
on the bed with every appear?ance of being about to doze off to sleep. Aroma
hurried over to him and, sitting on the edge of the bed, roused him with a shake:
‘Come on! Surely you are not going to sleep again? You need some fresh air. Why
don’t you go outside and walk around for a bit?’
Bao-yu took her by the hand and smiled at her.
‘I’d like to go,’ he said, ‘but I don’t want to leave you.’
‘Silly!’ said Aroma with a laugh. ‘Don’t say what you don’t mean!’
She hoicked him to his feet.
‘Well, where am I going to go then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just feel so bored.’
‘Never mind where, just go out!’ said Aroma. ‘If you stay moping indoors like this,
you’ll get even more bored.’
Bao-yu followed her advice, albeit half-heartedly, and went out into the courtyard.
After visiting the cages in the gallery and playing for a bit with the birds, he ambled
out of the courtyard into the Garden and along the batik of Drenched Blossoms
Stream, pausing for a while to look at the goldfish in the water. As he did so, a pair of
fawns came running like the wind from the hillside opposite. Bao-yu was puzzled.
There seemed to be no reason for their mysterious terror. But just then little Jia Lan
came running down the same slope after them, a tiny bow clutched in his hand.
Seeing his uncle ahead of him, he stood politely to attention and greeted him
cheerfully:
‘Hello, Uncle. I didn’t know you were at home. I thought you’d gone out.’
‘Mischievous little blighter, aren’t you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you want to go
shooting them for, poor little things?’
‘I’ve got no reading to do today,’ said Jia Lan, ‘and I don’t like to hang about doing
nothing, so I thought I’d practise my archery and equitation.’
‘Goodness! You’d better not waste time jawing, then,’ said Bao-yu, and left the
young toxophilite to his pursuits.
Moving on, without much thinking where he was going, he came presently to the
gate of a courtyard.
Denser than feathers on the phoenix’ tail
The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragon’s moan.
The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet
had, without conscious direction, carried him to the Naiad’s House. Of their own
accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard.
The House seemed silent and deserted, its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to
the ground; but as he approached the window, he detected a faint sweetness in the
air, traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green
gauze of the casement. He pressed his face to the gauze; but before his eyes could
distinguish anything, his ear became aware of a long, languorous sigh and the sound
of a voice speaking:
‘Each day in a drowsy waking dream of love.’
Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker. He could see her now. It was Dai-yu, of
course, lying on her bed, stretching herself and yawning luxuriously.
He laughed:
‘Why “each day in a drowsy waking dream of love”?’ he asked through the window
(the words were from his beloved Western Chamber); then going to the doorway he
lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room.
Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face
with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu
went over intending to turn her back again, but just at that moment Dai-yu’s old
wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels:
‘Miss Lin’s asleep, sir. Would you mind coming back again after she’s woken up?’
Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh:
‘Who’s asleep?’
The three old women laughed apologetically.
‘Sorry, miss. We thought you were asleep. Nightingale! Come inside now! Your
mistress is awake.’
Having shouted for Nightingale, the three guardians of morality retired.
‘What do you mean by coming into people’s rooms when they’re asleep?’ said
Dai-yu, smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the bed’s edge patting her hair into shape.
At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little
misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him. He sank into a chair and
smiled back at her:
‘What was that you were saying just now before I came in?’
‘I didn’t say anything,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her:
‘Put that on your tongue, girl! I heard you say it.’ While they were talking to one
another, Nightingale came in.
‘Nightingale,’ said Bao-yu, ‘what about a cup of that excellent tea of yours?’
‘Excellent tea?’ said Nightingale. ‘There’s nothing very special about the tea we
drink here. If nothing but the best will do, you’d better wait for Aroma to come.’
‘Never mind about him!’ said Dai-yu. ‘First go and get me some water!’
‘He is our guest,’ said Nightingale. ‘I can’t fetch you any water until I’ve given him
his tea.’ And she went to pour him a cup.
‘Good girl!’ said Bao-yu.

‘If with your amorous mistress I should wed,
‘Tis you, sweet maid, must make our bridal bed.’

The words, like Dai-yu’s languorous line, were from Western Chamber, but in
somewhat dubious taste. Dai-yu was dreadfully offended by them. In an instant the
smile had vanished from her face.
‘What was that you said?’ He laughed:
‘I didn’t say anything.’ Dai-yu began to cry.
‘This is your latest amusement, I suppose. Every time you hear some coarse
expression outside or read some crude, disgusting book, you have to come back here
and give me the benefit of it. I am to become a source of entertainment for the
menfolk now, it seems.’
She rose, weeping, from the bed and went outside. Bao-yu followed her in alarm.
‘Dearest coz, it was very wrong of me to say that, but it just slipped out without
thinking. Please don’t go and tell! I promise never to say anything like that again.
May my mouth rot and my tongue decay if I do!’
Just at that moment Aroma came hurrying up:
‘Quick!’ she said. ‘You must come back and change. The Master wants to see you.’
The descent of this thunderbolt drove all else from his mind and he rushed off in a
panic. As soon as he had changed, he hurried out of the Garden. Tealeaf was waiting
for him outside the inner gate.
‘I suppose you don’t know what he wants to see me about?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘I should hurry up, if I were you,’ said Tealeaf. ‘All I know is that he wants to see you.
You’ll find out why soon enough when you get there.’
He hustled him along as he spoke.
They had passed round the main hall, Bao-yu still in a state of fluttering
apprehensiveness when there was a loud guffaw from a corner of the wall. It was Xue
Pan, clapping his hands and stamping his feet in mirth.
‘Ho! Ho! Ho! You’d never have come this quickly if you hadn’t been told that Uncle
wanted you!’
Tealeaf, also laughing, fell on his knees. Bao-yu stood there looking puzzled. It was
some moments before it dawned on him that he had been hoaxed. Xue Pan was by
this time being apologetic — bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how
sorry he was:
‘Don’t blame the lad!’ he said. ‘It wasn’t his fault. I talked him into it.’
Bao-yu saw that he could do nothing, and might as well accept with a good grace.
‘I don’t mind being made a fool of,’ he said, ‘but I think it was going a bit far to
bring my father into it. I think perhaps I’d better tell Aunt Xue and see what she
thinks about it all.’
‘Now look here, old chap,’ said Xue Pan, getting agitated, ‘it was only because I
wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker. I admit it was very wrong of me to make free
with your Parent, but after all, you’ve only got to mention my father next time you
want to fool me and we’ll be quits!’
‘Aiyo!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Worse and worse!’ He turned to Tealeaf: ‘Treacherous little
beast! What are you still kneeling for?’
Tealeaf kotowed and rose to his feet.
‘Look,’ said Xue Pan. ‘I wouldn’t have troubled you other?wise, only it’s my birthday
on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others, I
don’t know where they got them from but they’ve given me:
a piece of fresh lotus root, ever so crisp and crunchy, as thick as that, look, and as
long as that;
a huge great melon, look, as big as that;
a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that;
and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute
from Siam.
Don’t you think it was clever of them to get me those things? Maybe not so much the
sturgeon and the sucking-pig. They’re just expensive. But where would you go to get
a piece of lotus root or a melon like that? However did they get them to grow so big?
I’ve given some of the stuff to Mother, and while I was about it I sent some round to
your grandmother and Auntie Wang, but I’ve still got a lot left over. I can’t eat it all
myself: it would be unlucky. But apart from me, the only person I can think of who is
worthy to eat a present like this is you. That’s why I came over specially to invite you.
And we’re lucky, because we’ve got a little chap who sings coming round as well. So
you and I will be able to sit down and make a day of it, eh? Really enjoy ourselves.’
Xue Pan, still talking, conducted Bao-yu to his ‘study’, where Zhan Guang, Cheng
Ri-xing, Hu Si-lai and Dan Ping-ren (the four donors of the feast) and the young singer
he had mentioned were already waiting. They rose to welcome Bao-yu as he entered.
When the bowings and courtesies were over and tea had been taken, Xue Pan called
for his servants to lay. A tremendous bustle ensued, which seemed to go on for quite
a long time before everything was finally ready and the diners were able to take their
places at the table.
Bao-yu noticed sliced melon and lotus root among the dishes, both of unusual quality
and size.
‘It seems wrong to be sharing your presents with you before I have given you
anything myself,’ he said jokingly.
‘Yes,’ said Xue Pan. ‘What are you planning to give me for my birthday next month?
Something new and out of the ordinary, I hope.’
‘I haven’t really got anything much to give you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Things like money and
food and clothing I don’t want for, but they’re not really mine to give. The only way I
could give you something that would really be mine would be by doing some
calligraphy or painting a picture for you.’
‘Talking of pictures,’ said Xue Pan genially, ‘that’s reminded me. I saw a set of dirty
pictures in someone’s house the other day. They were real beauties. There was a lot
of writing on top that I didn’t pay much attention to, but I did notice the signature. I
think it was “Geng Huang”, the man who painted them. They were really good!’
Bao-yu was puzzled. His knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both
past and present was not inconsiderable, but he had never in all his experience come
across a ‘Geng Huang’. After racking his brains for some moments he suddenly began
to chuckle and called for a writing-brush. A writing-brush having been produced by
one of the servants, he wrote two characters with it in the palm of his hand.
‘Are you quite sure the signature you saw was “Geng Huang”?’ he asked Xue Pan.
‘What do you mean?’ said Xue Pan. ‘Of course I’m sure.’
Bao-yu opened his hand and held it up for Xue Pan to see:
‘You sure it wasn’t these two characters? They are quite similar.’
The others crowded round to look. They all laughed when they saw what he had
written:
‘Yes, it must have been “Tang Yin”. Mr Xue couldn’t have been seeing straight that
day. Ha! Ha! Ha!’
Xue Pan realized that he had made a fool of himself, but passed it off with an
embarrassed laugh:
‘Oh, Tankin’ or wankin’,’ he said, ‘what difference does it make, anyway?’
Just then ‘Mr Feng’ was announced by one of the servants, which Bao-yu knew could
only mean General Feng Tang’s son, Feng Zi-ying. Xue Pan and the rest told the boy
to bring him in immediately, but Feng Zi-ying was already striding in, talking and
laughing as he went. The others hurriedly rose and invited him to take a seat.
‘Ha!’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘No need to go out then. Enjoyin’ yourselves at home, eh?
Very nice too!’
‘It’s a long time since we’ve seen you around,’ said Bao-yu. ‘How’s the General?’
‘Fahver’s in good health, thank you very much,’ said Feng Zi-ying, ‘but Muvver
hasn’t been too well lately. Caught a chill or somethin’.’
Observing with glee that Feng Zi-ying was sporting a black eye, Xue Pan asked him
how he had come by it:
‘Been having a dust-up, then? Who was it this time? Looks as if he left his
signature!’
Feng Zi-ying laughed:
‘Don’t use the mitts any more nowadays — not since that time I laid into Colonel
Chou’s son and did him an injury. That was a lesson to me. I’ve learned to keep my
temper since then. No, this happened the other day durin’ a huntin’ ex?pedition in
the Iron Net Mountains. I got flicked by a gos?hawk’s wing.’
‘When was this?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘We left on the twenty-eighth of last month,’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘Didn’t get back till a
few days ago.’
‘Ah, that explains why I didn’t see you at Shen’s party earlier this month,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘I meant at the time to ask why you weren’t there, but I forgot. Did you go
alone on this expedition or was the General there with you?’
‘Fahver most certainly was there,’ said Feng Zi-ying. ‘I was practically dragged along
in tow. Do you think I’m mad enough to go rushin’ off in pursuit of hideous hardships
when I could be sittin’ comfortably at home eatin’ good food and drinkin’ good wine
and listenin’ to the odd song or two? Still, some good came of it. It was a lucky
accident.’
As he had now finished his tea, Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them
his story at leisure, but Feng Zi-?ying rose to his feet again and declined.
‘I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you,’ he said, ‘but there’s
somethin’ very important I’ve got to see Fahver about now, so I’m afraid I really must
refuse.’
But Xue Pan, Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with
this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table.
‘Now look here, this is too bad!’ Feng Zi-ying good-hum?ouredly protested. ‘All the
years we’ve been knockin’ around togevver we’ve never before insisted that a fellow
should have to stay if he don’t want to. The fact is, I really can’t. Oh well, if I must
have a drink, fetch some decent-sized cups and I’ll just put down a couple of quick
ones!’
This was dearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced. Two
sconce-cups were brought and ceremoniously filled, Bao-yu holding the cups and Xue
Pan pouring from the wine-kettle. Feng Zi-ying drank them standing, one after the
other, each in a single breath.
‘Now come on,’ said Bao-yu, ‘let’s hear about this “lucky accident” before you go!’
Feng Zi-ying laughed:
‘Couldn’t tell it properly just now,’ he said. ‘It’s somethin’ that needs a special party
all to itself. I’ll invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the
details then. There’s a favour I want to ask too, by the bye, so we’ll be able to talk
about that then as well.’
He made a determined movement towards the door.
‘Now you’ve got us all peeing ourselves with curiosity!’ said Xue Pan. ‘You might at
least tell us when this party is going to be, to put us out of our suspense.’
‘Not more than ten days’ time and not less than eight,’ said Feng Zi-ying; and going
out into the courtyard, he jumped on his horse and clattered away.
Having seen him off, the others went in again, reseated themselves at table, and
resumed their potations. When the party finally broke up, Bao-yu returned to the
Garden in a state of cheerful inebriation. Aroma, who had had no idea what the
summons from Jia Zheng might portend and was still wondering anxiously what had
become of him, at once demanded to know the cause of his condition. He gave her a
full account of what had happened.
‘Well really!’ said Aroma. ‘Here were we practically beside ourselves with anxiety,
and all the time you were there enjoying yourself! You might at least have sent word
to let us know you were all right.’
‘I was going to send word,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Of course I was. But then old Feng arrived
and it put it out of my mind,’
At that moment Bao-chai walked in, all smiles.
‘I hear you’ve made a start on the famous present,’ she said.
‘But surely you and your family must have had some al?ready ?’ said Bao-yu.
Bao-chai shook her head:
‘Pan was very pressing that I should have some, but I refused. I told him to save it
for other people. I know I’m not really the right sort of person for such superior
delicacies. If I were to eat any, I should be afraid of some frightful nemesis overtaking
me.’
A maid poured tea for her as she spoke, and conversation of a desultory kind
proceeded between sips.

*
Our narrative returns now to Dai-yu.
Having been present when Bao-yu received his summons, Dai-yu, too, was greatly
worried about him - the more so as the day advanced and he had still not returned.
Then in the evening, some time after dinner, she heard that he had just got back and
resolved to go over and ask him exactly what had happened. She was sauntering
along on the way there when she caught sight of Bao-chai some distance ahead of
her, just entering Bao-yu’s courtyard. Continuing to amble on, she came presently to
Drenched Blossoms Bridge, from which a large number of different kinds of fish were
to be seen swimming about in the water below. Dai-yu did not know what kinds of
fish they were, but they were so beautiful that she had to stop and admire them, and
by the time she reached the House of Green Delights, the courtyard gate had been
shut for the night and she was obliged to knock for ad?mittance.
Now it so happened that Skybright had just been having a quarrel with Emerald, and
being thoroughly out of temper, was venting some of her ill-humour on the lately
arrived Bao-chai, complaining sotto voce behind her back about ‘people who were
always inventing excuses to come dropping in and who kept other people staying up
half the night when they would like to be in bed’. A knock at the gate coming in the
midst of these resentful mutterings was enough to make her really angry.
‘They’ve all gone to bed,’ she shouted, not even bothering to inquire who the caller
was. ‘Come again tomorrow!’
Dai-yu was aware that Bao-yu’s maids often played tricks on one another, and it
occurred to her that the girl in the courtyard, not recognizing her voice, might have
mistaken her for another maid and be keeping her locked out for a joke. She
therefore called out again, this time somewhat louder than before:
‘Come on! Open up, please! It’s me.’
Unfortunately Skybright had still not recognized the voice.
‘I don’t care who you are,’ she replied bad-temperedly. ‘Master Bao’s orders are
that I’m not to let anyone in.’
Dumbfounded by her insolence, Dai-yu stood outside the gate in silence. She could
not, however much she felt like it, give vent to her anger in noisy expostulation.
‘Although they are always telling me to treat my Uncle’s house as my own,’ she
reflected, ‘I am still really an outsider. And now that Mother and Father are both
dead and I am on my own, to make a fuss about a thing like this when I am living in
some?one else’s house could only lead to further unpleasantness.’
A big tear coursed, unregarded, down her cheek.
She was still standing there irresolute, unable to decide whether to go or stay, when
a sudden volley of talk and laughter reached her from inside. It resolved itself, as she
listened attentively, into the voices of Bao-yu and Bao-chai. An even bitterer sense of
chagrin took possession of her. Suddenly, as she hunted in her mind for some
possible reason for her exclusion, she remembered the events of the morning and
concluded that Bao-yu must think she had told on him to his parents and was
punishing her for her betrayal.
‘But I would never betray you!’ she expostulated with him in her mind. ‘Why
couldn’t you have asked first, before letting your resentment carry you to such
lengths? If you won’t see me today, does that mean that from now on we are going
to stop seeing each other altogether?’
The more she thought about it the more distressed she became.

Chill was the green moss pearled with dew
And chill was the wind in the avenue;

but Dai-yu, all unmindful of the unwholesome damp, had withdrawn into the shadow
of a flowering fruit-tree by the corner of the wall, and grieving now in real earnest,
began to cry as though her heart would break. And as if Nature herself were affected
by the grief of so beautiful a creature, the crows who had been roosting in the trees
round about flew up with a great commotion and removed themselves to another
part of the Garden, unable to endure the sorrow of her weeping.

Teats filled each flower and grief their hearts perturbed,
And silly birds were from their nests disturbed.

The author of the preceding couplet has given us a quatrain in much the same vein:

Few in this world fair Frowner’s looks surpassed,
None matched her store of sweetness unexpressed.
The first sob scarcely from her lips had passed
When blossoms fell and birds flew off distressed.

As Dai-yu continued weeping there alone, the courtyard door suddenly opened with
a loud creak and someone came out.
But in order to find out who it was, you will have to wait for the next volume.

TO CONTINUE OUR STORY,

As Dai-yu stood there weeping, there was a sudden creak of the courtyard gate and
Bao-chai walked out, accompanied by Bao-yu with Aroma and a bevy of other maids
who had come out to see her off. Dai-yu was on the point of stepping forward to
question Bao-yu, but shrank from embarrassing him in front of so many people.
Instead she slipped back into the shadows to let Bao-chai pass, emerging only when
Bao-yu and the rest were back inside and the gate was once more barred. She stood
for a while facing it, and shed a few silent tears; then, realizing that it was pointless
to remain standing there, she turned and went back to her room and began, in a
listless, mechanical manner, to take off her ornaments and prepare herself for the
night.
Nightingale and Snowgoose had long since become habitu?ated to Dai-yu’s moody
temperament; they were used to her unaccountable fits of depression, when she
would sit, the picture of misery, in gloomy silence broken only by an occasional gusty
sigh, and to her mysterious, perpetual weeping, that was occasioned by no
observable cause. At first they had tried to reason with her, or, imagining that she
must be grieving for her parents or that she was feeling homesick or had been upset
by some unkindness, they would do their best to comfort her. But as the months
lengthened into years and she still continued exactly the same as before, they
gradually became accustomed and no longer sought reasons for her behaviour. That
was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery,
remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves
with their own affairs.
She sat, motionless as a statue, leaning against the back of the bed, her hands
clasped about her knees, her eyes full of tears. It had already been dark for some
hours when she finally lay down to sleep.
Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence.

*

Next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month, the day on which, this year, the
festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall. To be precise, the festival’s official
commencement was on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month at two o’clock in
the afternoon. It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to
the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer; it is
about this time that the blossom begins to fail; and tradition has it that the
flower-spirits, their work now completed, go away on this day and do not return until
the following year. The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party
for the flowers.
This charming custom of ‘speeding the fairies’ is a special favourite with the fair sex,
and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches
and palan?quins out of willow-twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants
from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find, which they
fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs. Soon
every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering
sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers. Moving about in the
midst of it all, the girls in their brilliant summer dresses, beside which the most vivid
hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy, added the final touch of
brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour.
All the young people — Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi?chun, Li Wan, Xi-feng and
her little girl and Caltrop, and all the maids from all the different apartments — were
outside in the Garden enjoying themselves — all, that is, except Dai-yi, whose
absence, beginning to be noticed, was first commented on by Ying-chun:
‘What’s happened to Cousin Lin? Lazy girl! Surely she can’t still be in bed at this
hour?’
Bao-chai volunteered to go and fetch her:
‘The rest of you wait here; I’ll go and rout her out for you,’ she said; and breaking
away from the others, she made off in the direction of the Naiad’s House.
While she was on her way, she caught sight of élégante and the eleven other little
actresses, evidently on their way to join in the fun. They came up and greeted her,
and for a while she stood and chatted with them. As she was leaving them, she
turned back and pointed in the direction from which she had just come:
‘You’ll find the others somewhere over there,’ she said. ‘I’m on my way to get Miss
Lin. I’ll join the rest of you presently.’
She continued, by the circuitous route that the garden’s con?tours obliged her to take,
on her way to the Naiad’s House. Raising her eyes as she approached it, she suddenly
became aware that the figure ahead of her just disappearing inside it was Bao-yu.
She stopped and lowered her eyes pensively again to the ground.
‘Bao-yu and Dai-yu have known each other since they were little,’ she reflected.
‘They are used to behaving uninhibitedly when they are alone together. They don’t
seem to care what they say to one another; and one is never quite sure what sort of
mood one is going to find them in. And Dai-yu, at the best of times, is always so
touchy and suspicious. If I go in now after him, he is sure to feel embarrassed and she
is sure to start imagining things. It would be better to go back without seeing her.’
Her mind made up, she turned round and began to retrace her steps, intending to go
back to the other girls; but just at that moment she noticed two enormous
turquoise-coloured butterflies a little way ahead of her, each as large as a child’s fan,
fluttering and dancing on the breeze. She watched them fascinated and thought she
would like to play a game with them. Taking a fan from inside her sleeve and holding
it outspread of her, she followed them off the path and into the grass.
To and fro fluttered the pair of butterflies, sometimes alight?ing for a moment, but
always flying off again before she could reach them. Once they seemed on the point
of flying across the little river that flowed through the midst of the garden and
Bao-chai had to stalk them with bated breath for fear of start?ling them out on to the
water. By the time she had reached the Raindrop Pavilion she was perspiring freely
and her interest in the butterflies was beginning to evaporate. She was about to turn
back when she became aware of a low murmur of voices coming from inside the
pavilion.
Raindrop Pavilion was built in such a way that it projected into the middle of the pool
into which the little watercourse widened out at this point, so that on three of its
sides it looked out on to the water. It was surrounded by a verandah, whose railing
followed the many angles formed by the bays and projections of the base. In each of
its wooden walls there was a large paper-covered casement of elegantly patterned
lattice-work.
Hearing voices inside the pavilion, Bao-chai halted and in?clined her ear to listen.
‘Are you sure this is your handkerchief?’ one of the voices was saying. ‘If it is, take it;
but if it isn’t, I must return it to Mr Yun.’
‘Of course it’s mine,’ said the second voice. ‘Come on, let me have it!’
‘Are you going to give me a reward? I hope I haven’t taken all this trouble for
nothing.’
‘I promised you I would give you a reward, and so I shall. Surely you don’t think I
was deceiving you?’
‘All right, I get a reward for bringing it to you. But what about the person who
picked it up? Doesn’t he get anything?’
‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said the second voice. ‘He’s one of the masters. A master
picking up something belonging to one of us should give it back as a matter of course.
How can there be any question of rewarding him?’
‘If you don’t intend to reward him, what am I supposed to tell him when I see him?
He was most insistent that I wasn’t to give you the handkerchief unless you gave him
a reward.’ There was a long pause, after which the second voice re?plied:
‘Oh, all right. Let him have this other handkerchief of mine then. That will have to
do as his reward - But you must swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone else about
this.’
‘May my mouth rot and may I die a horrible death if I ever tell anyone else about
this, amen!’ said the first voice.
‘Goodness!’ said the second voice again. ‘Here we are talk?ing away, and all the
time someone could be creeping up out?side and listening to every word we say. We
had better open these casements; then even if anyone outside sees us, they’ll think
we are having an ordinary conversation; and we shall be able to see them and know
in time when to stop.’
Bao-chai, listening outside, gave a start.
‘No wonder they say “venery and thievery sharpen the wits”,’ she thought. ‘If they
open those windows and see me here, they are going to feel terribly embarrassed.
And one of those voices sounds like that proud, peculiar girl Crimson who works in
Bao-yu’s room. If a girl like that knows that I have overheard her doing something she
shouldn’t be doing, it will be a case of “the desperate dog will jump a wall, the
desperate man will hazard all”: there’ll be a great deal of trouble and I shall be
involved in it. There isn’t time to hide. I shall have to do as the cicada does when he
jumps out of his skin: give them something to put them off the scent—’
There was a loud creak as the casement yielded. Bao-chai advanced with deliberately
noisy tread.
‘Frowner!’ she called out gaily. ‘I know where you’re hid?ing.’
Inside the pavilion Crimson and Trinket, who heard her say this and saw her
advancing towards them just as they were opening the casement, were speechless
with amazement; but Bao-chai ignored their confusion and addressed them genially:
‘Have you two got Miss Lin hidden away in there?’
‘I haven’t seen Miss Lin,’ said Trinket.
‘I saw her just now from the river-bank,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She was squatting down
over here playing with something in the water. I was going to creep up and surprise
her, but she spotted me before I could get up to her and disappeared round this
corner. Are you sure she’s not hiding in there?’
She made a point of going inside the pavilion and searching; then, coming out again,
she said in a voice loud enough for them to hear:
‘If she’s not in the pavilion, she must have crept into that grotto. Oh well, if she’s
not afraid of being bitten by a snake — !’
As she walked away she laughed inwardly at the ease with which she had extricated
herself from a difficult situation.
‘I think I’m fairly safely out of that one,’ she thought. ‘I wonder what those two will
make of it.’
What indeed! Crimson believed every word that Bao-chai had said, and as soon as
the latter was at a distance, she seized hold of Trinket in alarm:
‘Oh, how terrible! If Miss Lin was squatting there, she must have heard what we
said before she went away.’
Her companion was silent.
‘Oh dear! What do you think she’ll do?’ said Crimson.
‘Well, suppose she did hear,’ said Trinket, ‘it’s not her backache. If we mind our
business and she minds hers, there’s no reason why anything should come of it.’
‘If it were Miss Bao that had heard us, I don’t suppose anything would,’ said
Crimson; ‘but Miss Lin is so critical and so intolerant. If she heard it and it gets about
— oh dear!’
But just at that moment Caltrop, Advent, Chess and Scribe were seen approaching
the pavilion, and Crimson and Trinket had to drop the subject in a hurry and join in a
general conversation. Crimson noticed Xi-feng standing half-way up the rockery
above the little grotto, beckoning. Breaking away from the others, she bounded up to
her with a smiling face:
‘What can I do for you, madam?’
Xi-feng ran an appraising eye over her. A neat, pretty, pleasantly-spoken girl, she
decided, and smiled at her graciously:
‘I have come here without my maids and need someone to a message back to my
apartment. I wonder if you are clever enough to get it right.’
‘Tell me the message, madam. If I don’t get it right and make a mess of it, it will be
up to you to punish me.’
‘Which of the young ladies do you work for?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’d better know, so that I
can explain to her if she asks for you while you are doing my errand.’
‘I work for Master Bao,’ said Crimson.
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Ah ha! You work for Master Bao. No wonder. Very well, then, if he asks for you
while you are away, I shall explain. I want you to go to my apartment and tell
Patience that there is a roll of money under the stand of the Ru-ware dish on the
table in the outside room. There are a hundred and twenty taels of silver in it to pay
the embroiderers with. Tell her that when Zhang Cai’s wife comes for it, she is to
weigh it out in front of her before handing it over. And there’s one other thing.
There’s a little purse at the head of the bed in my inside room. I want you to bring it
to me.’
‘Yes madam,’ said Crimson, and hurried off.
Returning shortly afterwards, she found that Xi-feng was no longer on the rockery;
but Chess had just emerged from the little grotto beneath it and was standing there
doing up her sash. Crimson ran down to speak to her:
‘Excuse me, did you see where Mrs Lian went to?’
‘’Fraid I didn’t notice,’ said Chess.
Crimson looked around her. Bao-chai and Tan-chun were standing at the edge of the
pool looking at the fish. She went up to them:
‘Excuse me, does either of you young ladies happen to know where Mrs Lian went
to just now, please?’
‘Try Mrs Zhu’s place,’ said Tan-chun.
Crimson hurried off in the direction of Sweet-rice Village. On her way she ran
head-on into a party of maids consisting of Skybright, Mackerel, Emerald, Ripple,
Musk, Scribe, Pic?ture and Oriole.
‘Here, what are you gadding about like this for?’ said Sky?bright as soon as she saw
who it was. ‘The flowers want watering; the birds need feeding; the stove for the
tea-water needs seeing to. You’ve no business to go wandering around outside!’
‘Master Bao gave orders yesterday that the flowers were only to be watered every
other day,’ said Crimson. ‘I fed the birds when you were still fast asleep in bed.’
‘What about the stove?’ said Emerald.
‘It isn’t my day for the stove,’ said Crimson. ‘The tea-water today has nothing to do
with me.’
‘Listen to Miss Pert!’ said Mackerel. ‘I wouldn’t bother about her, if I were you —
just leave her to wander about as she pleases.’
‘I’m not “wandering about”, if you really want to know,’ said Crimson. ‘If you really
want to know, Mrs Lian sent me outside to take a message and to fetch something
for her.’
She held up the purse for them to see; at which they were silent. But when they had
passed each other, Skybright laughed sneeringly:
‘You can see why she’s so uppity. She’s on the climb again. Look at her — all
cock-a-hoop because someone’s given her a little message to carry! And she probably
doesn’t even know who it’s about. Well, one little message isn’t going to get her very
far. It’s what happens in the long run that counts. Now if she were clever enough to
climb her way right out of this Garden and stay there, that would be really
something!’
These words were spoken for Crimson to hear, but in such a way that she was unable
to answer them. She had to swallow her anger and hurry on to look for Xi-feng.
Xi-feng was in Li Wan’s room, as Tan-chun had predicted, and Crimson found the two
of them in conversation. She went up to Xi-feng and delivered her message:
‘Patience says that she found the silver just after you had gone and took care of it;
and she says that when Zhang Cai’s wife came for it she did weigh it out in front of
her before giving it to her to take away.’
Crimson now produced the purse and handed it to Xi-feng.
Then she added:
‘Patience told me to tell you that Brightie has just been in to inquire what your
instructions were for his visit, and she said that she gave him a message to take
based on the things she thought you would want him to say.’
‘Oh?’ said Xi-feng, amused. ‘And what was this message “based on the things she
thought I would want him to say”?’
‘She said he was to tell them: “Our lady hopes your lady is well and she says that
the Master is away at present and may not be back for another day or two, but your
lady is not to worry; and when the lady from West Lane is better, our lady will come
with their lady to see your lady. And our lady says that the lady from West Lane sent
someone the other day with a message from the elder Lady Wang saying that she
hopes our lady is well and will she please see if our Lady Wang can let her have a few
of her Golden Myriad Macrobiotic Pills; and if she can, will our lady please send
someone with them to her, because someone will be going from there to the elder
Lady Wang’s in a few days’ time and they will be able to take them for her — ”’
Crimson was still in full spate when Li Wan interrupted her with a laugh:
‘What an extraordinary number of “ladies”! I hope you can understand what it’s all
about, Feng. I’m sure I can’t!’
‘I’m not surprised,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There are four or five different households
involved in that message.’ She smiled graciously at Crimson. ‘You’re a clever girl, my
dear, to have got it all right — not like the simpering little ninnies I usually have to
put up with. You have no idea, cousin,’ she said, turn?ing to Li Wan again. ‘Apart from
the one or two girls and one or two older women that I always keep about me, I just
dread talking to servants nowadays. They take such an inter?minable time to tell you
anything — so long-winded! And the airs and graces they give themselves! and the
simpering! and the urn-ing and ah-ing! If they only knew how it makes me fume! Our
Patience used to be like that when she first came to me. I used to say to her, “Do you
think it makes you seem glamorous, all that affected humming? — like a little gnat!” I
had to talk to her several times about it before she would mend her ways.’
Li Wan laughed.
‘I suppose if they were all peppercorns like you, it would be all right.’
‘This girl’s all right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Those two messages she gave me just now may
not have been very long ones, but you could see how clear-cut her delivery of them
was.’
She smiled at Crimson again.
‘How would you like to come and work for me and be my god-daughter? With a
little grooming from me you could go far.’
Crimson suppressed a giggle.
‘Why do you laugh?’ said Xi-feng. ‘I suppose you think I’m too young to be your
god-mother. You’re very silly if you think that. You just ask around a bit: there are
plenty much older than you who’d give their ears to be my god-daughter. What I’m
offering you is a very special favour.’
Crimson smiled.
‘I wasn’t laughing because of that, madam. I was laughing because you had got the
generation wrong. My mother is your god-daughter already. If you made me your
god-daughter too, I should be my own mother’s sister!’
‘Who is your mother?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Do you mean to say that you don’t know who this girl is that you’ve been talking to
all this time?’ said Li Wan. ‘This is Lin Zhi-xiao’s daughter.’
Xi-feng registered surprise:
‘You mean to tell me that this is the Lins’ daughter?’ She laughed. ‘That couple of
old sticks? I can never get a peep out of either of them. I’ve always maintained that
Lin Zhi-xiao and his wife were the perfect match: one hears nothing and the other
says nothing. Well! To think they should have produced a bright little thing like this
between them! — How old are you?’ she asked Crimson.
‘Sixteen.’
‘And what’s your name?’
‘“Crimson”, madam. I used to be called “Jade”, but they made me change it on
account of Master Bao.’
Xi-feng looked away with a frown of displeasure.
‘I should think so too,’ she muttered. ‘Odious people! One can hear them saying it:
“We’ve got a ‘Jade’ in our family the same as you”, or some such impertinence.’
She turned to Li Wan again:
‘I don’t think you know, Wan, but I told this girl’s mother that as Lai Da’s wife is so
busy nowadays that she doesn’t even know who half the girls in the household are
any longer, I wanted her to pick out a couple of likely-looking girls to work under me.
Now she promised that she would do this; but you see, not only has she not done so,
but she’s actually gone and sent her own daughter to work for someone else. Do you
suppose she really thinks her girl would have had such a ter?rible time with me?’
‘Don’t be so touchy,’ said Li Wan. ‘Her mother is not to blame. The girl had already
started service in the Garden before you ever spoke to her about it.’
‘Oh well, in that case,’ said Xi-feng, recovering her good humour, ‘I’ll have a word
with Bao-yu about it tomorrow. I’ll tell him to find someone else and let me have this
girl to work under me. Still — ’ she turned to Crimson, ‘perhaps we ought to ask the
party most concerned if she is willing.’
Crimson smiled.
‘As to being willing or not, madam, I don’t think it’s my place to say. But I do know
this: that if I was to work for you, I should get to know what’s what and all the inside
and out?side of household management. I’m sure it would be wonder?ful
experience.’
Just then a maid arrived from Lady Wang’s asking for Xi?-feng, who promptly excused
herself to Li Wan and left. Crimson returned to Green Delights — where our story
now leaves her.

*

We now return to Dai-yu, who, having slept so little the night before, was very late
getting up on the morning of the festival. Hearing that the other girls were all out in
the garden ‘speeding the fairies’ and fearing to be teased by them for her lazy habits,
she hurried over her toilet and went out as soon as it was completed. A smiling
Bao-yu appeared in the gateway as she was stepping down into the courtyard.
‘Well, coz,’ he said, ‘I hope you didn’t tell on me yesterday. You had me worrying
about it all last night.’
Dai-yu turned back, ignoring him, to address Nightingale inside:
‘When you do the room, leave one of the casements open so that the parent
swallows can get in. And put the lion door?stop on the bottom of the blind to stop it
flapping. And don’t forget to put the cover back on the burner after you’ve lighted
the incense.’
She made her way across the courtyard, still ignoring him. Bao-yu, who knew nothing
of the little drama that had taken place outside his gate the night before, assumed
that she was still angry about his unfortunate lapse earlier on that same day, when
he had offended her susceptibilities with a some?what risqué quotation from The
Western Chamber. He offered her now, with energetic bowing and hand-pumping,
the apologies that the previous day’s emergency had caused him to neglect. But
Dai-yu walked straight past him and out of the gate, not deigning so much as a glance
in his direction, and stalked off in search of the others.
Bao-yu was nonplussed. He began to suspect that something more than he had first
imagined must be wrong.
‘Surely it can’t only be because of yesterday lunchtime that she’s carrying on in this
fashion? There must be something else. On the other hand, I didn’t get back until
late and I didn’t see her again last night, so how could I have offended her?’
Preoccupied with these reflections, he followed her at some distance behind.
Not far ahead Bao-chai and Tan-chun were watching the ungainly courtship dance of
some storks. When they saw Dai?-yu coming, they invited her to join them, and the
three girls stood together and chatted. Then Bao-yu arrived. Tan-chun greeted him
with sisterly concern:
‘How have you been keeping, Bao? It’s three whole days since I saw you last.’
Bao-yu smiled back at her.
‘How have you been keeping, sis? I was asking Cousin Wan about you the day
before yesterday.’
‘Come over here a minute,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I want to talk to you.’
He followed her into the shade of a pomegranate tree a little way apart from the
other two.
‘Has Father asked to see you at all during this last day or two?’ Tan-chun began.
‘No.’
‘I thought I heard someone say yesterday that he had been asking for you.’
‘No,’ said Bao-yu, smiling at her concern. ‘Whoever it was was mistaken. He
certainly hasn’t asked for me.’
Tan-chun smiled and changed the subject.
‘During the past few months,’ she said, ‘I’ve managed to save up another ten
strings or so of cash. I’d like you to take it again like you did last time, and next time
you go out, if you see a nice painting or calligraphic scroll or some amusing little
thing that would do for my room, I’d like you to buy it for me.’
‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘In the trips I make to bazaars and temple fairs,
whether it’s inside the city or round about, I can’t say that I ever see anything really
nice or out of the ordinary. It’s all bronzes and jades and porcelain and that sort of
stuff. Apart from that it’s mostly dress-making materials and clothes and things to
eat.’
‘Now what would I want things like that for?’ said Tan?-chun. ‘No, I mean
something like that little wickerwork basket you bought me last time, or the little box
carved out of bamboo root, or the little clay burner. I thought they were sweet.
Unfortunately the others took such a fancy to them that they carried them off as loot
and wouldn’t give them back to me again.’
‘Oh, if those are the sort of things you want,’ said Bao-yu laughing, ‘it’s very simple.
Just give a few strings of cash to one of the boys and he’ll bring you back a whole
cartload of them.’
‘What do the boys know about it?’ said Tan-chun. ‘I need someone who can pick
out the interesting things and the ones that are in good taste. You get me lots of nice
little things, and I’ll embroider a pair of slippers for you like the ones I made for you
last time — only this time I’ll do them more carefully.’
‘Talking of those slippers reminds me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I happened to run into Father
once when I was wearing them. He was Most Displeased. When he asked me who
made them, I naturally didn’t dare to tell him that you had, so I said that Aunt Wang
had given them to me as a birthday present a few days before. There wasn’t much he
could do about it when he heard that they came from Aunt Wang; so after a very
long pause he just said, “What a pointless waste of human effort and valuable
material, to produce things like that!” I told this to Aroma when I got back, and she
said, “Oh, that’s nothing! You should have heard your Aunt Zhao complaining about
those slippers. She was furious when she heard about them:
‘Her own natural brother so down at heel he scarcely dares show his face to people,
and she spends her time making things like that!’”’
Tan-chun’s smile had vanished:
‘How can she talk such nonsense? Why should I be the one to make shoes for him?
Huan gets a clothing allowance, doesn’t he? He gets his clothing and footwear
provided for the same as all the test of us. And fancy saying a thing like that in front
of a roomful of servants! For whose benefit was this remark made, I wonder? I make
an occasional pair of slippers just for something to do in my spare time; and if I give a
pair to someone I particularly like, that’s my own affair. Surely no one else has any
business to start telling me who I should give them to? Oh, she’s so petty!’
Bao-yu shook his head:
‘Perhaps you’re being a bit hard on her. She’s probably got her reasons.’
This made Tan-chun really angry. Her chin went up de?fiantly:
‘Now you’re being as stupid as her. Of course she’s got her reasons; but they are
ignorant, stupid reasons. But she can think what she likes: as far as I am concerned,
Sir Jia is my father and Lady Wang is my mother, and who was born in whose room
doesn’t interest me — the way I choose my friends inside the family has nothing to
do with that. Oh, I know I shouldn’t talk about her like this; but she is so idiotic about
these things. As a matter of fact I can give you an even better example than your
story of the slippers. That last time I gave you my savings to get something for me,
she saw me a few days afterwards and started telling me how short of money she
was and how difficult things were for her. I took no notice, of course. But later, when
the maids were out of the room, she began attacking me for giving the money I’d
saved to other people instead of giving it to Huan. Really! I didn’t know whether to
laugh or get angry with her. In the end I just walked out of the room and went round
to see Mother.’
There was an amused interruption at this point from Bao-chai, who was still standing
where they had left her a few minutes before:
‘Do finish your talking and come back soon! It’s easy to see that you two are
brother and sister. As soon as you see each other, you get into a huddle and start
talking about family secrets. Would it really be such a disaster if anything you are
saying were to be overheard?’
Tan-chun and Bao-yu rejoined her, laughing.
Not seeing Dai-yu, Bao-yu realized that she must have slipped off elsewhere while be
was talking.
‘Better leave it a day or two,’ he told himself on reflection. ‘Wait until her anger has
calmed down a bit.’
While he was looking downwards and meditating, he noticed that the ground where
they were standing was car?peted with a bright profusion of wind-blown flowers —
pome?granate and balsam for the most part.
‘You can see she’s upset,’ he thought ruefully. ‘She’s neg?lecting her flowers. I’ll
bury this lot for her and remind her about it next time I see her.’
He became aware that Bao-chai was arranging for him and Tan-chun to go with her
outside.
‘I’ll join you two presently,’ he said, and waited until they were a little way off
before stooping down to gather the fallen blossoms into the skirt of his gown. It was
quite a way from where he was to the place where Dai-yu had buried the
peach-blossom on that previous occasion, but he made his way towards it, over rocks
and bridges and through plantations of trees and flowers. When he had almost
reached his destination and there was only the spur of a miniature ‘mountain’
be?tween him and the burial-place of the flowers, he heard the sound of a voice,
coming from the other side of the rock, whose continuous, gentle chiding was
occasionally broken by the most pitiable and heart-rending sobs.
‘It must be a maid from one of the apartments,’ thought Bao-yu. ‘Someone has
been ill-treating her, and she has run here to cry on her own.’
He stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying. She
appeared to be reciting something:

The blossoms fade and falling fill the air,
Of fragrance and bright hues bereft and bare.
Floss drifts and flutters round the Maiden’s bower,
Or softly strikes against her curtained door.

The Maid, grieved by these signs of spring’s decease,
Seeking some means her sorrow to express,
Has rake in hand into the garden gone,
Before the fallen flowers are trampled on.

Elm-pods and willow-floss are fragrant too;
Why care, Maid, where the fallen flowers blew?
Next year, when peach and plum-tree bloom again,
Which of your sweet companions will remain?

This spring the heartless swallow built his nest
Beneath the eaves of mud with flowers compressed.
Next year the flowers will blossom as before,
But swallow, nest, and Maid will be no more.

Three hundred and three-score the year’s full tale:
From swords of frost and from the slaughtering gale
How can the lovely flowers long stay intact,
Or, once loosed, from their drifting fate draw back?
Blooming so steadfast, fallen so hard to find!
Beside the flowers’ grave, with sorrowing mind,
The solitary Maid sheds many a tear,
Which on the boughs as bloody drops appear.

At twilight, when the cuckoo sings no more,
The Maiden with her rake goes in at door
And lays her down between the lamplit walls,
While a chill rain against the window falls.

I know not why my heart’s so strangely sad,
Half grieving for the spring and yet half glad:
Glad that it came, grieved it so soon was spent.
So soft it came, so silently it went!

Last night, outside, a mournful sound was heard:
The spirits of the flowers and of the bird.
But neither bird nor flowers would long delay,
Bird lacking speech, and flowers too shy to stay.

And then I wished that I had wings to fly
After the drifting flowers across the sky:
Across the sky to the world’s farthest end,
The flowers’ last fragrant resting-place to find.

But better their remains in silk to lay
And bury underneath the wholesome clay,
Pure substances the pure earth to enrich,
Than leave to soak and stink in some foul ditch.

Can I, that these flowers’ obsequies attend,
Divine how soon or late my life will end?
Let others laugh flower-burial to see:
Another year who will be burying me?

As petals drop and spring begins to fail,
The bloom of youth, too, sickens and turns pale.
One day, when spring has gone and youth has fled.
The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead.

All this was uttered in a voice half-choked with sobs; for the words recited seemed
only to inflame the grief of the reciter — indeed, Bao-yu, listening on the other side
of the rock, was so overcome by them that he had already flung himself weeping
upon the ground.
But the sequel to this painful scene will be told in the follow?ing chapter.




CHAPTER 28

A crimson cummerbund becomes a pledge of friendship
And a chaplet of medicine-beads becomes a source of
embarrassment

ON the night before the festival, it may be remembered, Lin Dai-yu had mistakenly
supposed Bao-yu responsible for Sky-bright’s refusal to open the gate for her. The
ceremonial fare?well to the flowers of the following morning had transformed her
pent-up and still smouldering resentment into a more generalized and seasonable
sorrow. This had finally found its expression in a violent outburst of grief as she was
burying the latest collection of fallen blossoms in her flower-grave. Meditation on the
fate of flowers had led her to a contempla?tion of her own sad and orphaned lot; she
had burst into tears, and soon. after had begun a recitation of the poem whose
words we recorded in the preceding chapter.
Unknown to her, Bao-yu was listening to this recitation from the slope of the near-by
rockery. At first he merely nod?ded and sighed sympathetically; but when he heard
the words

             ‘Can I, that these flowers’ obsequies attend,
               Divine how soon or late my life will end?’

and, a little later,


‘One day when spring has gone and youth has fled,
The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead.’

he flung himself on the ground in a fit of weeping, scattering the earth all about him
with the flowers he had been carrying in the skirt of his gown.
Lin Dai-yu dead! A world from which that delicate, flower?like countenance had
irrevocably departed! It was unutterable anguish to think of it. Yet his sensitized
imagination did now consider it — went on, indeed, to consider a world from which
the others, too — Bao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and the rest — had also irrevocably
departed. Where would he be then? What would have become of him? And what of
the Garden, the rocks, the flowers, the trees? To whom would they belong when he
and the girls were no longer there to enjoy them? Passing from loss to loss in his
imagination, he plunged deeper and deeper into a grief that seemed inconsolable. As
the poet says:

          Flowers in my eyes and bird-song in my ears
          Augment my loss and mock my bitter tears.

Dai-yu, then, as she stood plunged in her own private sor?rowing, suddenly heard
the sound of another person crying bitterly on the rocks above her.
‘The others are always telling me I’m a “case”,’ she thought. Surely there can’t be
another “case” up there?’
But on looking up she saw that it was Bao-yu.
‘Pshaw!’ she said crossly to herself. ‘I thought it was another girl, but all the time it
was that cruel, hate—’
‘Hateful’ she had been going to say, but clapped her mouth shut before uttering it.
She sighed instead and began to walk away.
By the time Bao-yu’s weeping was over, Dai-yu was no longer there. He realized that
she must have seen him and have gone away in order to avoid him. Feeling suddenly
rather foolish, he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes. Then he
descended from the rockery and began to retrace his steps in the direction of Green
Delights. Quite by coincidence Dai-yu was walking along the same path a little way
ahead.
‘Stop a minute!’ he cried, hurrying forward to catch up with her. ‘I know you are
not taking any notice of me, but I only want to ask you one simple question, and then
you need never have anything more to do with me.’
Dai-yu had turned back to see who it was. When she saw that it was Bao-yu still, she
was going to ignore him again; but hearing him say that he only wanted to ask her
one ques?tion, she told him that he might do so.
Bao-yu could not resist teasing her a little.
‘How about two questions? Would you wait for two?’
Dai-yu set her face forwards and began walking on again.
Bao-yu sighed.
‘If it has to be like this now,’ he said, as if to himself; ‘it’s a pity it was ever like it
was in the beginning.’
Dai-yu’s curiosity got the better of her. She stopped walk?ing and turned once more
towards him.
‘Like what in the beginning?’ she asked. ‘And like what now?’
‘Oh, the beginning!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In the beginning, when you first came here, I was
your faithful companion in all your games. Anything I had, even the thing most dear
to me, was yours for the asking. If there was something to eat that I specially liked, I
had only to hear that you were fond of it too and I would religiously hoard it away to
share with you when you got back, not daring even to touch it until you came. We
ate at the same table. We slept in the same bed. I used to think that because we
were so close then, there would be something special about our relationship when
we grew up — that even if we weren’t particularly affectionate, we should at least
have more understanding and forbearance for each other than the rest. But how
wrong I was! Now that you have grown up, you seem only to have grown more
touchy. You don’t seem to care about me any more at all. You spend all your time
brood?ing about outsiders like Peng and Chai. I haven’t got any real brothers and
sisters left here now. There are Huan and Tan, of course; but as you know, they’re
only my half-brother and half-sister: they aren’t my mother’s children. I’m on my own,
like you. I should have thought we had so much in common - But what’s the use? I try
and try, but it gets me nowhere; and nobody knows or cares.’
At this point — in spite of himself — he burst into tears.
The palpable evidence of her own eyes and ears had by now wrought a considerable
softening on Dai-yu’s heart. A sym?pathetic tear stole down her own cheek, and she
hung her head and said nothing. Bao-yu could see that he had moved her.
‘I know I’m not much use nowadays,’ he continued, ‘but however bad you may
think me, I would never wittingly do anything in your presence to offend you. If I do
ever slip up in some way, you ought to tell me off about it and warn me not to do it
again, or shout at me — hit me, even, if you feel like it; I shouldn’t mind. But you
don’t do that. You just ignore me. You leave me utterly at a loss to know what I’m
supposed to have done wrong, so that I’m driven half frantic wondering what I ought
to do to make up for it. If I were to die now, I should die with a grievance, and all the
masses and exorcisms in the world wouldn’t lay my ghost. Only when you explained
what your reason was for ignoring me should I cease from haunting you and be
reborn into another life.’
Dai-yu’s resentment for the gate incident had by now com?pletely evaporated. She
merely said:
‘Oh well, in that case why did you tell your maids not to let me in when I came to
call on you?’
‘I honestly don’t know what you are referring to,’ said Bao-yu in surprise. ‘Strike me
dead if I ever did any such thing!’
‘Hush!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Talking about death at this time of the morning! You should be
more careful what you say. If you did, you did. If you didn’t, you didn’t. There’s no
need for these horrible oaths.’
‘I really and truly didn’t know you had called,’ said Bao-yu. Cousin Bao came and sat
with me a few minutes last night and then went away again. That’s the only call I
know about.’
Dai-yu reflected for a moment or two, then smiled.
‘ Yes, it must have been the maids being lazy. Certainly they can be very
disagreeable at such times.’
‘Yes, I’m sure that’s what it was,’ said Bao-yu. ‘When I get back, I’ll find out who it
was and give her a good talking-to.’
‘I think some of your young ladies could do with a good talking-to,’ said Dai-yu, ‘—
though it’s not really for me to say so. It’s a good job it was only me they were rude
to. If Miss Bao or Miss Cow were to call and they behaved like that to her, that would
be really serious.’
She giggled mischievously. Bao-yu didn’t know whether to laugh with her or grind his
teeth. But just at that moment a maid came up to ask them both to lunch and the
two of them went together out of the Garden and through into the front part of the
mansion, calling in at Lady Wang’s on the way.
‘How did you get on with that medicine of Dr Bao’s,’ Lady Wang asked Dai-yu as
soon as she saw her, ‘— the Court Physician? Do you think you are any better for it?’
‘It didn’t seem to make very much difference,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Grandmother has put
me back on Dr Wang’s prescription.’
‘Cousin Lin has got a naturally weak constitution, Mother,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She takes
cold very easily. These strong decoc?tions are all very well provided she only takes
one or two to dispel the cold. For regular treatment it’s probably best if she sticks to
pills.’
‘The doctor was telling me about some pills for her the other day,’ said Lady Wang,
‘but I just can’t remember the name.’
‘I know the names of most of those pills,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I expect he wanted her to
take Ginseng Tonic Pills.’
‘No, that wasn’t it,’ said Lady Wang.
‘Eight Gem Motherwort Pills?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Zhang’s Dextrals? Zhang’s Sinistrals? If
it wasn’t any of them, it was probably Dr Cui’s Adenophora Kidney Pills.’
‘No,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it was none of those. All I can remember is that there was a
“Vajra” in it.
Bao-yu gave a hoot and clapped his hands:
‘I’ve never heard of “Vajra Pills”. If there are “Vajra Pills”, I suppose there must be
“Buddha Boluses ”!’
The others all laughed. Bao-chai looked at him mockingly. ‘I should think it was
probably “The Deva-king Cardiac Elixir Pills”,’ she said.
‘Yes, yes, that’s it!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Of course! How stupid of me!’
‘No, Mother, not stupid,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s the strain. All those Vajra-kings and
Bodhisattvas have been overworking you!’
‘You’re a naughty boy to make fun of your poor mother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘A good
whipping from your Pa is what you need.’
‘Oh, Father doesn’t whip me for that sort of thing now?adays,’ said Bao-yu.
Now that we know the name of the pills, we must get them to buy some for your
Cousin Lin,’ said Lady Wang.
‘None of those things are any good,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You give me three hundred and
sixty taels of silver and I’ll make up some pills for Cousin Lin that I guarantee will have
her com?pletely cured before she has finished the first boxful.’
‘Stuff!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Whoever heard of a medicine that cost so much?’
‘No, honestly!’ said Bao-yu. ‘This prescription is a very unusual one with very
special ingredients. I can’t remember all of them, but I know they include

the caul of a first-born child;
a ginseng root shaped like a man, with the leaves still on it;
               a turtle-sized polygonum root;
and
     lycoperdon from the stump of a thousand-year-old pine-tree.


— Actually, though, there’s nothing so very special about those ingredients. They’re
all in the standard pharmacopoeia. For “sovereign remedies” they use ingredients
that would really make you jump. I once gave the prescription for one to Cousin Xue.
He was more than a year begging me for it before I would give it to him, and it took
him another two or three years and nearly a thousand taels of silver to get all the
ingredients to?gether. Ask Bao-chai if you don’t believe me, Mother.’
‘I know nothing about it,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve never heard it mentioned. It’s no good
telling Aunt to ask me.’
‘You see! Bao-chai is a good girl. She doesn’t tell lies,’ said Lady Wang.
Bao-yu was standing in the middle of the floor below the kang. He clapped his hands
at this and turned to the others appealingly.
‘But it’s the truth I’m telling you. This is no lie.’
As he turned, he happened to catch sight of Dai-yu, who was sitting behind Bao-chai,
smiling mockingly and stroking her cheek with her finger — which in sign-language
means, ‘You are a great big liar and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.’
But Xi-feng, who happened to be in the inner room super?vising the laying of the
table and had overheard the preceding remarks, now emerged into the outer room
to corroborate:
‘It’s quite true, what Bao says. I don’t think he is making it up,’ she said. ‘Not so
long ago Cousin Xue came to me asking for some pearls, and when I asked him what
he wanted them for, he said, “To make medicine with.” Then he started grumbling
about the trouble he was having in getting the right ingredients and how he had half
a mind not to make this medicine up after all. I said, “What medicine?” and he told
me that it was a prescription that Cousin Bao had given him and reeled off a lot of
ingredients — I can’t remember them now. “Of course,” he said, “I could easily
enough buy a few pearls; only these have to be ones that have been worn. That’s
why I’m asking you for them. If you haven’t got any loose ones, he said, “a few pearls
broken off a bit of jewellery would do. I’d get you something nice to replace it with.”
He was so insistent that in the end I had to break up two of my ornaments for him.
Then he wanted a yard of Imperial red gauze. That was to put over the mortar to
pound the pearls through. He said they had to be ground until they were as fine as
flour.’
‘You see!’ ‘You see!’ Bao-yu kept interjecting throughout this recital.
‘Incidentally, Mother,’ he said, when it was ended, ‘even that was only a substitute.
According to the prescription, the pearls ought really to have come from an ancient
grave. They should really have been pearls taken from jewellery on the corpse of a
long-buried noblewoman. But as one can’t very well go digging up graves and riding
tombs every time one wants to make this medicine, the prescription allows pearls
worn by the living as a second-best.’
‘Blessed name of the Lord!’ said Lady Wang. ‘What a dread?ful idea! Even if you did
get them from a grave, I can’t believe that a medicine made from pearls that had
been come by so wickedly — desecrating people’s bones that had been lying
peacefully in the ground all those hundreds of years — could possibly do you any
good.’
Bao-yu turned to Dai-yu.
‘Did you hear what Feng said?’ he asked her. ‘I hope you’re not going to say that
she was lying.’
Although the remark was addressed to Dai-yu, he winked at Bao-chai as he made it.
Dai-yu clung to Lady Wang.
‘Listen to him, Aunt!’ she wailed. ‘Bao-chai won’t be a party to his lies, but he still
expects me to be.’
‘Bao-yu, you are very unkind to your cousin,’ said Lady Wang.
Bao-yu only laughed.
‘You don’t know the reason, Mother. Bao-chai didn’t know a half of what Cousin
Xue got up to, even when she was living with her mother outside; and now that she’s
moved into the Garden, she knows even less. When she said she didn’t know, she
really didn’t know: she wasn’t giving me the lie. What you don’t realize is that Cousin
Lin was all the time sitting behind her making signs to show that she didn’t believe
me.’
Just then a maid came from Grandmother Jia’s apartment to fetch Bao-yu and Dai-yu
to lunch.
Without saying a word to Bao-yu, Dai-yu got up and, tak?ing the maid’s hand, began
to go. But the maid was reluctant.
‘Let’s wait for Master Bao and we can go together.’
‘He’s not eating lunch today,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Come on, let’s go!’
‘Whether he’s eating lunch or not,’ said the maid, ‘he’d better come with us, so that
he can explain to Her Old Lady?ship about it when she asks.’
‘All right, you wait for him then,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m going on ahead.’
And off she went.
‘I think I’d rather eat with you today, Mother,’ said Bao-yu.
‘No, no, you can’t,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Today is one of my fast-days: I shall only be
eating vegetables. You go and have a proper meal with your Grandma.’
‘I shall share your vegetables,’ said Bao-yu. Go on, you can go,’ he said, dismissing
the maid; and rushing up to the table, he sat himself down at it in readiness.
‘You others had better get on with your own lunch,’ Lady Wang said to Bao-chai
and the girls. ‘Let him do as he likes.’
‘You really ought to go,’ Bao-chai said to Bao-yu. ‘Whether you have lunch there or
not, you ought to keep Cousin Lin company. She is very upset, you know. Why don’t
you?’
‘Oh, leave her alone!’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’ll be all right presently.’
Soon they had finished eating, and Bao-yu, afraid that Grandmother Jia might be
worrying and at the same time anxious to rejoin Dai-yu, hurriedly demanded tea to
rinse his mouth with. Tan-chun and Xi-chun were much amused.
‘Why are you always in such a hurry, Bao?’ they asked him. ‘Even your eating and
drinking all seems to be done in a rush.’
‘You should let him finish quickly, so that he can get back to his Dai-yu,’ said
Bao-chai blandly. ‘Don’t make him waste time here with us.’
Bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea, and made straight for the west courtyard
where his Grandmother Jia’s apartment was. But as he was passing by the gateway of
Xi?-feng’s courtyard, it happened that Xi-feng herself was stand?ing in her doorway
with one foot on the threshold, grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping
a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her
direction.
‘Ah, just the person I wanted to see!’ she said, as soon as she caught sight of
Bao-yu. ‘Come inside. I want you to write something down for me.’
Bao-yu was obliged to follow her indoors. Xi-feng called for some paper, an inkstone
and a brush, and at once began dictating:
‘ Crimson lining-damask forty lengths, dragonet figured satin forty lengths,
miscellaneous
Imperial gauze one hundred lengths, gold necklets four, —’
‘Here, what is this?’ said Bao-yu. ‘It isn’t an invoice and it isn’t a presentation list.
How am I supposed to write it?’
‘Never you mind about that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘As long as I know what it is, that’s all
that matters. Just put it down any?how.’
Bao-yu wrote down the four items. As soon as he had done so, Xi-feng took up the
paper and folded it away.
‘Now,’ she said, smiling pleasantly, ‘there’s something I want to talk to you about. I
don’t know whether you’ll agree to this or not, but there’s a girl in your room called
“Crimson” whom I’d like to work for me. If I find you someone to re?place her with,
will you let me have her?’
‘There are so many girls in my room,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Please take any you have a fancy
to. You really don’t need to ask me about it.’
‘In that case,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’ll send for her straight away.’
‘Please do,’ said Bao-yu, and started to go.
‘Hey, come back!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t finished with you yet.’
‘I’ve got to see Grandma now,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you’ve got anything else to say, you
can tell me on my way back.’
When he got to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, they had all just finished lunch.
Grandmother Jia asked him if he bad had anything nice to eat with his mother.
‘There wasn’t anything nice,’ he said. ‘But I had an extra bowl of rice.’
Then, after the briefest pause:
‘Where’s Cousin Lin?’
‘In the inner room,’ said Grandmother Jia.
In the inner room a maid stood below the kang blowing on a flat-iron. Up on the kang
two maids were marking some material with a chalked string, while Dai-yu, her head
bent low over her work, was engaged in cutting something from it with her shears.
‘What are you making?’ he asked her. ‘You’ll give yourself a headache, stooping
down like that immediately after your lunch.’
Dai-yu took no notice and went on cutting.
‘That corner looks a bit creased still,’ said one of the maids. ‘it will have to be
ironed again.’
‘Leave it alone!’ said Dai-yu, laying down her shears. ‘It will be all right presently.’
Bao-yu found her reply puzzling.
Bao-chai, Tan-chun and the rest had now arrived in the outer room and were talking
to Grandmother Jia. Presently Bao-chai drifted inside and asked Dai-yu what she was
doing; then, when she saw that she was cutting material, she ex?claimed admiringly.
‘What a lot of things you can do, Dai! Fancy, even dress-making now!’
Dai-yu smiled malignantly.
‘Oh, it’s all lies, really. I just do it to fool people.’
‘I’ve got something to tell you that I think will amuse you, Dai,’ said Bao-chai
pleasantly. ‘When our cousin was holding forth about that medicine just now and I
said I didn’t know about it, I believe actually he was rather wounded.’
‘Oh, leave him alone!’ said Dai-yu. ‘He will be all right presently.’
‘Grandma wants someone to play dominoes with,’ said Bao-yu to Bao-chai. ‘Why
don’t you go and play dominoes?’
‘Oh, is that what I came for?’ said Bao-chai; but she went, notwithstanding.
‘Why don’t you go?’ said Dai-yu. ‘There’s a tiger in this room. You might get eaten.’
She said this still bending over her cutting, which she con?tinued to work away at
without looking up at him.
Finding himself once more ignored, Bao-yu nevertheless attempted to remain jovial.
‘Why don’t you come out for a bit too? You can do this cutting later.’
Dai-yu continued to take no notice.
Failing to get a response from her, he tried the maids:
‘Who told her to do this dress-making?’
‘Whoever told her to do it,’ said Dai-yu, ‘it has nothing whatever to do with Master
Bao.’
Bao-yu was about to retort, but just at that moment someone came in to say that he
was wanted outside, and he was obliged to hurry off.
Dai-yu leaned forward and shouted after him:
‘Holy Name! By the time you get back, I shall be dead.’

*

Outside the gateway to the inner quartets Bao-yu found Tea-leaf waiting.
‘Mr Feng invites you round to his house,’ said Tealeaf.
Bao-yu realized that this must be in connection with the matter Feng Zi-ying had
spoken of on the previous day. He told Tealeaf to send for his going-out clothes, and
went into his outer study to wait for them.
Tealeaf went back to the west inner gate to wait for someone who would carry a
message inside to the maids. Presently an old woman came out:
‘Excuse me, missus,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Master Bao is waiting in the outer study for his
going-out clothes. Could you take a message inside to say that he wants them?’
‘— your mother’s twat!’ said the old woman. ‘Master Bao lives in the Garden now.
All his maids are in the Garden. What do you want to come running round here for?’
Tealeaf laughed at his own mistake.
‘You’re quite right. I’m going cuckoo.’
He ran round to the gate of the Garden. As luck would have it, the boys on that gate
were playing football in the open space below the terraced walk, and when Tealeaf
had explained his errand, one of them ran off inside for him. He returned after a very
long wait, carrying a large bundle, which he handed to Tealeaf, and which Tealeaf
carried back to the outer study.
While he was changing, Bao-yu asked for his horse to be saddled, and presently set
off, taking only Tealeaf, Ploughboy, Two-times and Oldie as his attendants. When they
reached Feng Zi-ying’s gate, someone ran in to announce his arrival, and Feng Zi-ying
came out in person to greet him and led him inside to meet the company.
This comprised Xue Pan, who had evidently been waiting there for some time, a
number of boy singers, a female imper?sonator called Jiang Yu-han and a girl called
Nuageuse from the Budding Grove, a high-class establishment specializing in female
entertainers. When everyone had been introduced, tea was served.
‘Now come on!’ said Bao-yu, as he picked up the proffered cup of tea. ‘What about
this “lucky accident” you mentioned yesterday? I’ve been waiting anxiously to hear
about it ever since I saw you. That’s why I came so promptly when I got your
invitation.’
Feng Zi-ying laughed.
‘You and your cousin are such simple souls — I find it rahver touchin’! Afraid it was
pure invention, what I said yesterday. I said it to make you come, because I fought
that if I asked you outright to come and drink wiv me, you’d make excuses. Anyway, it
worked.’
The company joined in his merriment.
Wine was now brought in and everyone sat down in the places assigned to them.
Feng Zi-ying first got one of the singing-boys to pour for them; then he called on
Nuageuse to drink with each of the guests in turn.
Xue Pan, by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him, was already
beginning to be obstreperous. He seized Nuageuse by the hand and drew her
towards him:
‘If you’d sing me a nice new song - one of your specials, I’d drink a whole jarful for
you. How about it, eh?’
Nuageuse had to oblige him by taking up her lute and sing?ing the following song for
him to her own accompaniment:

              Two lovely boys
              Are both in love with me
And I can’t get either from my mind.
Both are so beautiful
So wonderful
So marvellous
To give up either one would be unkind.
Last night I promised I would go
To meet one of them in the garden where the roses grow;
The other came to see what he could find.
And now that we three are all
Here in this tribunal,
    There are no words that come into my mind.


‘There you are!’ she said. ‘Now drink your jarful!’
‘That one’s not worth a jarful,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Sing us a better one.’
‘Now just a minute,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just guzzling like this will make us drunk in no
time without giving us any real enjoyment. I’ve got a good new drinking-game for
you. Let me first drink the M.C.’s starting-cup, and I’ll tell you the rules. After that,
anyone who doesn’t toe the line will be made to drink ten Sconce-cups straight off as
a forfeit, give up his seat at the party, and spend the rest of the time pouring out
drinks for the rest of us.’
Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han agreed enthusiastically, and Bao-yu picked up one of
the extra large cups that had now been provided and drained its contents at a single
draught.
‘Now,’ he said. ‘We’re going to take four words — let’s say “upset”, “glum”, “blest”
and “content”. You have to begin by saying “The girl is —”, and then you say one of
the four words. That’s your first line. The next line has to rhyme with the first line and
it has to give the reason why the girl is whatever it says — “upset or glum” or “blest”
or content. When you’ve done all four, you’re entitled to drink the wine in front of
you. Only, before drinking it, you’ve first got to sing some new popular song; and
after you’ve drunk it, you’ve got to choose some animal or vegetable object from the
things in front of us and recite a line from a well-known poem, or an old couplet, or a
quotation from the classics—’
Before he could finish, Xue Pan was on his feet, protesting vigorously:
‘You can count me out of this. I’m taking no part in this. This is just to make a fool of
me, isn’t it?’
Nuageuse, too, stood up and attempted to push him back into his seat:
‘What are you so afraid of, a practiced drinker like you? You can’t be any worse at
this sort of thing than I am, and I’m going to have a go when my turn comes. If you
do it all right, you’ve got nothing to worry about, and even if you can’t, you’ll only be
made to drink a few cups of wine; whereas if you refuse to follow the rules at the
very outset, you’ll have to drink ten sconces straight off in a row and then be thrown
out of the party and made to pour drinks for the rest of us.’
‘Bravo!’ cried the others, clapping; and Xue Pan, seeing them united against him,
subsided.
Bao-yu now began his own turn:

    ‘The girl’s upset:
              The years pass by, but no one’s claimed her yet.
The girl looks glum:
              Her true-love’s gone to follow ambition’s drum.
    The girl feels blest:
          The mirror shows her looks are at their best.
    The girl’s content:
          Long summer days in pleasant pastimes spent.’

The others all applauded, except Xue Pan, who shook his head disapprovingly:
‘No good, no good!’ he said. ‘Pay the forfeit.’
‘Why, what’s wrong with it?’ they asked him.
‘I couldn’t understand a word of it.’
Nuageuse gave him a pinch:
‘Keep quiet and try to think what you’re going to say,’ she advised him; ‘otherwise
you’ll have nothing ready when your own turn comes and you’ll have to pay the
forfeit yourself.’
Thereupon she picked up her lute and accompanied Bao-yu as he sang the following
song:


‘Still weeping tears of blood about our separation:
Little red love-beans of my desolation.
Still blooming flowers I see outside my window growing.
Still awake in the dark I hear the wind a-blowing.
Still oh still I can’t forget those old hopes and fears.
Still can’t swallow food and drink, ’cos I’m choked with tears.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me it’s not true:
Do I look so thin and pale, do I look so blue?
Mirror, mirror, this long night bow shall I get through?
Oh—oh—oh!
Blue as the mist upon the distant mountains,
Blue as the water in the ever-flowing fountains.’

General applause — except from Xue Pan, who objected that there was ‘no rhythm’.
Bao-yu now drank his well-earned cup — the ‘pass cup’ as they call it — and, picking
up a slice of pear from the table, concluded his turn with the following quotation:


‘Rain whips the pear-tree, shut fast the door.’
Now it was Feng Zi-ying’s turn:
‘The girl’s upset:
Her husband’s ill and she’s in debt.
The girl looks glum:
The gale has turned her room into a slum.
The girl feels blest:
She’s got twin babies at the breast.
The girl’s content:
Waiting a certain pleasurable event.’
Next, holding up his cupful of wine in readiness to drink, he sang this song:
‘You’re so exciting,
And so inviting;
You’re my Mary Contrary;
You’re a crazy, mad thing.
You’re my goddess, but oh I you’re deaf to my praying:
Why won’t you listen to what I am saying?
If you don’t believe me, make a small investigation:
You will soon find out the true depth of my admiration.’

Then he drained his bumper and, picking up a piece of chicken from one of the dishes,
ended the performance, prior to popping it into his mouth, with a line from Wen
Ting-yun:


‘From moonlit cot the cry of chanticleer.’
Next it was the turn of Nuageuse:
‘The girl’s upset:’
she began,
‘Not knowing how the future’s to be met—’

Xue Pan laughed noisily.
‘That’s all right, my darling, don’t you worry! Your Uncle Xue will take care of you.’
‘Shush!’ said the others. ‘Don’t confuse her.’
She continued:


‘The girl looks glum:
Nothing but blows and hard words from her Mum— ’


‘I saw that Mum of yours the other day,’ said Xue Pan, ‘and I particularly told her
that she wasn’t to beat you.’
‘Another word from you,’ said the others, ‘and you’ll be made to drink ten cups as a
punishment.’
Xue Pan gave his own face a slap.
‘Sorry! I forgot. Won’t do it again.’

‘The girl feels blest:’
said Nuageuse,
‘Her young man’s rich and beautifully dressed.
The girl’s content:
She’s been performing in a big event.’

Next Nuageuse sang her song:


‘A flower began to open in the month of May.
Along came a honey-bee to sport and play.
He pushed and he squeezed to get inside,
But he couldn’t get in however hard he tried.
       So on the flower’s lip he just hung around,
A-playing the see-saw up and down.
Oh my honey-sweet,
Oh my sweets of sin,
If I don’t open up,
How will you get in?’

After drinking her ‘pass cup’; she picked up a peach:


‘So bonny blooms the peach-tree-o?’

It was now Xue Pan’s turn.
‘Ah yes, now, let’s see! I have to say something now, don’t I?’
‘The girl’s upset—’
But nothing followed.
‘All night, what’s she upset about then?’ said Feng Zi-ying with a laugh. ‘Buck up!’
Xue Pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his
eyes seemed about to pop out of his head. After glaring fixedly for an unconscionable
time, he said:
‘The girl’s upset—’
He coughed a couple of times. Then at last it came:


‘The girl’s upset:
She’s married to a marmoset.’

The others greeted this with a roar of laughter.
‘What are you laughing at?’ said Xue Pan. ‘That’s perfectly reasonable, isn’t it? If a
girl was expecting a proper husband and he turned out to be one of them, she’d have
cause to be upset, wouldn’t she?’
His audience were by now doubled up.
‘That’s perfectly true,’ they conceded. ‘Very good. Now what about the next bit?’
Xue Pan glared a while very concentratedly, then:


‘The girl looks glum—’

But after that was silence.
‘Come on!’ said the others. ‘Why was she glum?’

‘His dad’s a baboon with a big red bum.’

‘Ho! Ho! Ho! Pay the forfeit,’ they cried. ‘The first one was bad enough. We really
can’t let this one go.’
The more officious of them even began filling the sconce-cups for him. But Bao-yu
allowed the line.
‘As long as it rhymes,’ he said, ‘we’ll let it pass.’
‘There you are! ‘ said Xue Pan. ‘The M.C. says it’s all right. What are the rest of you
making such a fuss about?’
At this the others desisted.
‘The next two are even harder,’ said Nuageuse. ‘Shall I do them for you, dear?’
‘Piss off!’ said Xue Pan. ‘D’you think I haven’t got any good lines of my own? Listen
to this:

The girl feels blest:
In bridal bower she takes her rest.’

The others stared at him in amazement:
‘I say, old chap, that’s a bit poetical for you, isn’t it?’ Xue Pan continued
unconcernedly:


‘The girls content:
She’s got a big prick up her vent.’

The others looked away with expressions of disgust.
‘Oh dear, oh dear! Hurry up and get on with the song, then.’

‘One little gnat went hum hum hum,’

Xue Pan began tunelessly. The others looked at him open-mouthed:
‘What sort of song is that?’
Xue Pan droned on, ignoring the question:


‘Two little flies went bum bum bum,
Three little —’

Stop!’ shouted the others.
‘Sod you lot!’ said Xue Pan. ‘This is the very latest new hit. It’s called the Hum-bum
Song. If you can’t be bothered to listen to it, you’ll have to let me off the other thing.
I’ll agree not to sing the rest of the song on that condition.’
‘Yes, yes, we’ll let you off,’ they said. ‘Just don’t interfere with the rest of us, that’s
all we ask.’
This meant that it was now Jiang Yu-han’s turn to perform. This is what he said:
‘The girl’s upset:
Her man’s away, she fears he will forget.
The girl looks glum:
So short of cash she can’t afford a crumb.
The girl feels blest:
Her lampwick’s got a lucky crest.
The girl’s content:
She’s married to a perfect gent.’

Then he sang this song:


‘A mischievous bundle of charm and love,
Or an angel come down from the skies above?
Sweet sixteen
And so very green,
Yet eager to see all there is to be seen.
Aie aie aie
The galaxy’s high
In the roof of the sky,
And the drum from the tower
Sounds the midnight hour,
So trim the lamp, love, and come with me
Inside the bed-curtains, and you shall see!’

He raised the pass cup to his lips, but before drinking it, smiled round at his auditors
and made this little speech:
‘I’m afraid my knowledge of poetry is strictly limited. However, I happened to see a
couplet on someone’s wall yesterday which has stuck in my mind; and as one line in it
is about something I can see here, I shall use it to finish my turn with.’
So saying, he drained the cup and then, picking up a spray of cassia, recited the
following line:


‘The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days.’

The others all accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion of the performance. Not so
Xue Pan, however, who leaped to his feet and began protesting noisily:
‘Terrible! Pay the forfeit. Where’s the little doll? I can’t see any doll on the table.’
‘I didn’t say anything about a doll,’ said Jiang Yu-han.
    ‘What are you talking about?’
‘Come on, don’t try to wriggle out of it!’ said Xue Pan. ‘Say what you said just now
again.’


‘The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days.’

‘There you are!’ said Xue Pan.’ “Aroma”. That’s the name of a little doll. Ask him if
you don’t believe me.’ He pointed to Bao-yu.
Bao-yu looked embarrassed.
‘Cousin Xue, this time I think you do have to pay the forfeit.’
‘All right, all right!’ said Xue Pan. ‘I’ll drink.’
And he picked up the wine in front of him and drained it at a gulp.
Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han were still puzzled and asked him what this was all
about. But it was Nuageuse who explained. Immediately Jiang Yu-han was on his feet
apologiz?ing. The others reassured him.
‘It’s not your fault. “Ignorance excuses all”,’ they said.
Shortly after this Bao-yu had to take temporary leave of the company to ease his
bladder and Jiang Yu-han followed him outside. As the two of them stood side by
side under the eaves, Jiang Yu-han once more offered Bao-yu his apologies. Much
taken with the actor’s winsome looks and gentleness of man?ner, Bao-yu impulsively
took his hand and gave it a squeeze.
‘Do come round to our place some time when you are free,’ he said. ‘There’s
something I want to ask you about. You have an actor in your company called “Bijou”
whom everyone is talking about lately. I should so much like to meet him, but so far I
haven’t had an opportunity.’
‘That’s me!’ said Jiang Yu-han. “Bijou” is my stage name.’
Bao-yu stamped with delight.
‘But this is wonderful! I must say, you fully deserve your reputation. Oh dear! What
am I going to do about a First Meeting present?’
He thought for a bit, then took a fan from his sleeve and broke off its jade pendant.
‘Here you are,’ he said, handing it to Bijou. ‘It’s not much of a present, I’m afraid,
but it will do to remind you of our meeting.’
Bijou smiled and accepted it ceremoniously:
‘I have done nothing to deserve this favour. It is too great an honour. Well, thank
you. There’s rather an unusual thing I’m wearing I put it on today for the first time, so
it’s still fairly new: I wonder if you will allow me to give it to you as a token of my
warm feelings towards you?’
He opened up his gown, undid the crimson cummerbund with which his trousers
were fastened, and handed it to Bao?-yu.
‘It comes from the tribute sent by the Queen of the Madder Islands. It’s for wearing
in summer. It makes you smell nice and it doesn’t show perspiration stains. I was
given it yester?day by the Prince of Beijing, and today is the first time it s ever been
worn. I wouldn’t give a thing like this to anyone else, but I’d like you to have it. Will
you take your own sash off, please, so that I can put it on instead?’
Bao-yu received the crimson cummerbund with delight and quickly took off his own
viridian-coloured sash to give to Bijou in exchange. They had just finished fastening
the sashes on again when Xue Pan jumped out from behind and seized hold of them
both.
‘What are you two up to, leaving the party and sneaking off like this?’ he said.
‘Come on, take ‘em out again and let’s have a look!’
It was useless for them to protest that the situation was not what he imagined. Xue
Pan continued to force his unwelcome attentions upon them until Feng Zi-ying came
out and rescued them. After that they returned to the party and continued drinking
until the evening.
Back in his own apartment in the Garden, Bao-yu took off his outer clothes and
relaxed with a cup of tea. While he did so, Aroma noticed that the pendant of his fan
was missing and asked him what had become of it. Bao-yu told her that it had come
off while he was riding, and she gave the matter no more thought. But later, when he
was going to bed, she saw the magnificent blood-red sash round his waist and began
to put two and two together.
‘Since you’ve got a better sash now,’ she said, ‘do you think I could have mine back,
please?’
Bao-yu remembered, too late, that the viridian sash had been Aroma’s and that he
ought never to have given it away. He now very much regretted having done so, but
instead of apologizing, attempted to pass it off with a laugh.
‘I’ll get you another,’ he told her lightly.
Aroma shook her head and sighed.
‘I knew you still got up to these tricks,’ she said, ‘but at least you might refrain from
giving my things to those disgusting creatures. I’m surprised you haven’t got more
sense.’
She was going to say more, but checked herself for fear of provoking an explosion
while he was in his cups. And since there was nothing else she could do, she went to
bed.
She awoke at first daylight next morning to find Bao-yu smiling down at her:
‘We might have been burgled last night for all you’d have known about it — Look at
your trousers!’
Looking down, Aroma saw the sash that Bao-yu had been wearing yesterday tied
round her own waist, and knew that he must have exchanged it for hers during the
night. She tore it off impatiently.
‘I don’t want the horrible thing. The sooner you take it away the better.’
Bao-yu was anxious that she should keep it, and after a great deal of coaxing she
consented, very reluctantly, to tie it on again. But she took it off once and for all as
soon as he was out of the room and threw it into an empty chest, having first found
another one of her own to put on in its place.
Bao-yu made no comment on the change when they were together again. He merely
inquired whether anything had happened the day before, while he was out.
‘Mrs Lian sent someone round to fetch Crimson,’ said Aroma. ‘She wanted to wait
for you; but it seemed to me that it wasn’t all that important, so I took it on myself to
send her off straight away.’
‘Quite right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I already knew about it. There was no need to wait till I
got back.’
Aroma continued:
‘Her Grace sent that Mr Xia of the Imperial Bedchamber yesterday with a hundred
and twenty taels of silver to pay for a three-day Pro Viventibus by the Taoists of the
Lunar Queen temple starting on the first of next month. There are to be plays
performed as part of the Offering; and Mr Zhen and all the other gentlemen are to go
there to burn incense. Oh, and Her Grace’s presents for the Double Fifth have
arrived.’
She ordered a little maid to get out Bao-yu’s share of the things sent. There were two
Palace fans of exquisite workmanship, two strings of red musk-scented
medicine-beads, two lengths of maidenhair chiffon and a grass-woven ‘lotus’ mat to
lie on in the hot weather.
‘Did the others all get the same?’ he asked.
‘Her Old Ladyship’s presents were the same as yours with the addition of a
perfume-sceptre and an agate head-rest, and Sir Zheng’s, Lady Wang’s and Mrs Xue’s
were the same as Her Old Ladyship’s but without the head-rest; Miss Bao’s were
exactly the same as yours; Miss Lin, Miss Ying-chun, Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xi-chun
got only the fans and the beads; and Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian both got two lengths of
gauze, two lengths of chiffon, two perfume sachets and two moulded
medicine-cakes.’
‘Funny!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I wonder why Miss Lin didn’t get the same as me and why
only Miss Bao’s and mine were the same. There must have been some mistake,
surely?’
‘When they unpacked them yesterday, the separate lots were all labelled,’ said
Aroma. ‘I don’t see how there could have been any mistake. Your share was in Her
Old Ladyship’s room and I went round there to get it for you. Her Old Lady?ship says
she wants you to go to Court at four o’clock tomor?row morning to give thanks.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Bao-yu inattentively, and gave Ripple instructions to take his
presents round to Dai-yu:
‘Tell Miss Lin that I got these things yesterday and that if there’s anything there she
fancies, I should like her to keep it.’
Ripple went off with the presents. She was back in a very short time, however.
‘Miss Lin says she got some yesterday too, and will you please keep these for
yourself.’
Bao-yu told her to put them away. As soon as he had washed, he left to pay his
morning call on Grandmother Jia; but just as he was going out he saw Dai-yu coming
towards him and hurried forward to meet her.
‘Why didn’t you choose anything from the things I sent you?’
Yesterday’s resentments were now quite forgotten; today Dai-yu had fresh matter to
occupy her mind.
‘I’m not equal to the honour,’ she said. ‘You forget, I’m not in the gold and jade
class like you and your Cousin Bao. I’m only a common little wall-flower!’
The reference to gold and jade immediately aroused Bao?-yu’s suspicions.
‘I don’t know what anyone else may have been saying on the subject,’ he said, ‘but
if any such thought ever so much as crossed my mind, may Heaven strike me dead,
and may I never be reborn as a human being!’
Seeing him genuinely bewildered, Dai-yu smiled in what was meant to be a
reassuring manner.
‘I wish you wouldn’t make these horrible oaths. It’s so dis?agreeable. Who cares
about your silly old “gold and jade”, anyway?’
‘It’s hard to make you see what is in my heart,’ said Bao-yu. ‘One day perhaps you
will know. But I can tell you this. My heart has room for four people only. Grannie
and my parents are three of them and Cousin Dai is the fourth. I swear to you there
isn’t a fifth.’
‘There’s no need for you to swear,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I know very well that Cousin Dai has
a place in your heart. The trouble is that as soon as Cousin Chai comes along, Cousin
Dai gets forgotten.’
‘You imagine these things,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It really isn’t as you say.’
‘Yesterday when Little Miss Bao wouldn’t tell lies for you, why did you turn to me
and expect me to? How would you like it if I did that sort of thing to you?’
Bao-chai happened to come along while they were still talk?ing and the two of them
moved aside to avoid her. Bao-chai saw this clearly, but pretended not to notice and
hurried by with lowered eyes. She went and sat with Lady Wang for a while and from
there went on to Grandmother Jia’s. Bao-yu was already at his grandmother’s when
she got there.
Bao-chai had on more than one occasion heard her mother telling Lady Wang and
other people that the golden locket she wore had been given her by a monk, who
had insisted that when she grew up the person she married must be someone who
had ‘a jade to match the gold’. This was one of the reasons why she tended to keep
aloof from Bao-yu. The slight embarrassment she always felt as a result of her
mother’s chat?ter had yesterday been greatly intensified when Yuan-chun singled her
out as the only girl to receive the same selection of presents as Bao-yu. She was
relieved to think that Bao-yu, so wrapped up in Dai-yu that his thoughts were only of
her, was unaware of her embarrassment.
But now here was Bao-yu smiling at her with sudden interest.
‘Cousin Bao, may I have a look at your medicine-beads?’
She happened to be wearing one of the little chaplets on her left wrist and began to
pull it off now in obedience to his re?quest. But Bao-chai was inclined to plumpness
and perspired easily, and for a moment or two it would not come off. While she was
struggling with it, Bao-yu had ample opportunity to observe her snow-white arm,
and a feeling rather warmer than admiration was kindled inside him.
‘If that arm were growing on Cousin Lin’s body,’ he specu?lated, ‘I might hope one
day to touch it. What a pity it’s hers! Now I shall never have that good fortune.’
Suddenly he thought of the curious coincidence of the gold and jade talismans and
their matching inscriptions, which Dai-yu’s remark had reminded him of. He looked
again at Bao-chai—
that face like the full moon’s argent bowl;
those eyes like sloes;
those lips whose carmine hue no Art contrived;
and brows by none but Nature’s pencil lined.

This was beauty of quite a different order from Dai-yu’s. Fas?cinated by it, he
continued to stare at her with a somewhat dazed expression, so that when she
handed him the chaplet, which she had now succeeded in getting off her wrist, he
failed to take it from her.
Seeing that he had gone off into one of his trances, Bao-chai threw down the chaplet
in embarrassment and turned to go. But Dai-yu was standing on the threshold, biting
a corner of her handkerchief, convulsed with silent laughter.
‘I thought you were so delicate,’ said Bao-chai. ‘What are you standing there in the
draught for?’
‘I’ve been in the room all the time,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I just this moment went to have a
look outside because I heard the sound of something in the sky. It was a gawping
goose.’
‘Where?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let me have a look.’
‘Oh,’ said Dai-yu, ‘as soon as I went outside he flew away with a whir-r-r-’
She flicked her long handkerchief as she said this in the direction of Bao-yu’s face.
‘Ow!’ he exclaimed — She had flicked him in the eye.
The extent of the damage will be examined in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 29

In which the greatly blessed pray for yet greater blessings
And the highly strung rise to new heights of passion

WE told in the last chapter how, as Bao-yu was standing lost in one of his trances,
Dai-yu flicked her handkerchief at him and made him jump by inadvertently catching
him in the eye with it.
     ‘Who did that?’ he asked.
Dai-yu laughingly shook her head.
‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. Bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose, and I
accidentally flicked you while I was showing her how it went.’
Bao-yu rubbed his eye. He appeared to be about to say something, but then thought
better of it.
And so the matter passed.

*

Shortly after this incident Xi-feng arrived and began talking about the arrangements
that had been made for the purification ceremonies, due to begin on the first of next
month at the Taoist temple of the Lunar Goddess. She invited Bao-?chai, Bao-yu and
Dai-yu to go with her there to watch the plays.
‘Oh no!’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s too hot. Even if they were to do something we haven’t
seen before — which isn’t likely — I think I should still not want to go.’
     ‘But it’s cool there,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There are upstairs gal?leries on all three sides
that you can watch from in the shade. And if we go, I shall send someone a day or
two in advance to turn the Taoists out of that part of the temple and make it nice and
clean for us and get them to put up blinds. And I’ll ask them not to let any other
visitors in on that day. I’ve already told Lady Wang I’m going, so if you others won’t
come with me, I shall go by myself. I’m so bored lately. And it’s such a business when
we put on our own plays at home, that I can never enjoy them properly.’
‘All right then, I’ll come,’ said Grandmother Jia, who had been listening.
‘You’ll come, Grannie? Well that’s splendid, isn’t it! That means it will be just as bad
for me as it would be if I were watching here at home.’
‘Now look here,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘I shan’t want you to stand and wait on me.
Let me take the gallery facing the stage and you can have one of the side galleries all
to yourself; then you can sit down and enjoy yourself in comfort.’
Xi-feng was touched.
‘Do come!’ Grandmother Jia said to Bao-chai. ‘I’ll see that your mother comes too.
The days are so long now, and there’s nothing to do at home except go to sleep.’
Bao-chai had to promise that she would go.
Grandmother Jia now sent someone to invite Aunt Xue. The messenger was to call in
on the way at Lady Wang’s and ask her if the girls might go as well.
Lady Wang had already made it clear that she would not be going herself, partly
because she was not feeling very well, and partly because she wanted to be at home
in case any further messages arrived from Yuan-chun; but when she learned of
Grandmother Jia’s enthusiasm, she had word carried into the Garden that not just
the girls but anyone else who wanted to might go along with Grandmother Jia’s party
on the first.
When this exciting news had been transmitted throughout the Garden, the maids
some of whom hardly set foot outside their own courtyards from one year’s end to
the next were all dying to go, and those whose mistresses showed a lethargic
disinclination to accept employed a hundred different wiles to make sure that they
did so. The result was that in the end all the Garden’s inhabitants said that they
would be going. Grandmother Jia was quite elated and at once issued orders for the
cleaning and preparation of the temple theatre.
But these are details with which we need not concern our?selves.
On the morning of the first sedans, carriages, horses and people filled all the roadway
outside Rong-guo House. The stewards in charge knew that the occasion of this
outing was a Pro Viventibus ordered by Her Grace the Imperial Concubine and that
Her Old Ladyship was going in person to burn incense — quite apart from the fact
that this was the first day of the month and the first day of the Summer Festival;
con?sequently the turnout was as splendid as they could make it and far exceeded
anything that had been seen on previous occasions.
Presently Grandmother Jia appeared, seated, in solitary splendour, in a large
palanquin carried by eight bearers. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Aunt Xue followed, each in a
palanquin with four bearers. After them came Bao-chai and Dai-yu sharing a carriage
with a splendid turquoise-coloured canopy trimmed with pearls. The carriage after
them, in which Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat, had vermilion-painted wheels
and was shaded with a large embroidered umbrella. After them rode Grandmother
Jia’s maids, Faithful, Parrot, Amber and Pearl; after them Lin Dai-yu’s maids,
Nightingale, Snowgoose and Delicate; then Bao-chai’s maids, Oriole and Apricot; then
Ying-chun’s maids, Chess and Tangerine; then Tan-chun’s maids, Scribe and Ebony;
then Xi-chun’s maids, Picture and Landscape; then Aunt Xue’s maids, Providence and
Prosper, sharing a carriage with Caltrop and Caltrop’s own maid, Advent; then Li
Wan’s maids, Candida and Casta; then Xi-feng’s own maids, Patience, Felicity and
Crimson, with two of Lady Wang’s maids, Golden and Suncloud, whom Xi-feng had
agreed to take with her, in the carriage behind. In the carriage after them sat another
couple of maids and a nurse holding Xi-feng’s little girl. Yet more carriages followed
carrying the nannies and old women from the various apart?ments and the women
whose duty it was to act as duennas when the ladies of the household went out of
doors. The street was packed with carriages as far as the eye could see in either
direction, and Grandmother Jia’s palanquin was well on the way to the temple before
the last passengers in the rear had finished taking their places. A confused hubbub of
laughter and chatter rose from the line of carriages while they were doing so,
punctuated by an occasional louder and more dis?tinctly audible protest, such as:
‘I’m not sitting next to you!’
or,
‘You’re squashing the Mistress’s bundle!’
or,
‘Look, you’ve trodden on my spray!’
or,
‘You’ve ruined my fan, clumsy!’
Zhou Rui’s wife walked up and down calling for some order:
‘Girls! Girls! You’re out in the street now, where people can see you. A little
behaviour, please!’
She had to do this several times before the clamour sub?sided somewhat.
The footmen and insignia-bearers at the front of the proces?sion had now reached
the temple, and as the files of their column opened out to range themselves on
either side of the gateway, the onlookers lining the sides of the street were able to
see Bao-yu on a splendidly caparisoned white horse riding at the head of the
procession immediately in front of his grandmother’s great palanquin with its eight
bearers. As Grandmother Jia and her party approached the temple, there was a crash
of drums and cymbals from the roadside. It was the Taoists of the temple come out
to welcome them, with old Abbot Zhang at their head, resplendent in cope and
vestments and with a burning joss-stick in his hand.
The palanquin passed through the gateway and into the first courtyard. From her
seat inside it Grandmother Jia could see the terrifying painted images of the temple
guardians, one on each side of the inner gate, flanked by that equally ferocious pair,
Thousand League Eye with his blue face and Favourable Wind Ear with his green one,
and farther on, the benigner forms of the City God and the little Local Gods. She
ordered the bearers to halt, and Cousin Zhen at the head of the younger male
members of the clan came forward from the inner court?yard to meet her.
Xi-feng, whose palanquin was nearest to Grandmother Jia’s, realized that Faithful and
the other maids were too far back in the procession to be able to reach the old lady
in time to help her out, and hurried forward to perform this service herself.
Unfortunately a little eleven- or twelve-year-old acolyte, who had been going round
with a pair of snuffers trimming the wicks of the numerous candles that were burning
everywhere and whom the arrival of the procession had caught unawares, chose this
very moment to attempt a getaway and ran head-on into her. Out flew Xi-feng’s hand
and dealt him a resounding smack on the face that sent him flying.
‘Clumsy brat!’ she shouted. ‘Look where you’re going!’
The little acolyte picked himself up and, leaving his snuffers where they had fallen,
darted off in the direction of the gate. But by now Bao-chai and the other young
ladies were getting down from their carriages and a phalanx of women-servants
clustered all round them, making egress impossible. Seeing a little Taoist running
towards them, the women began to scream and shout:
‘Catch him! Catch him! Hit him! Hit him!’
‘What is it?’ asked Grandmother Jia in alarm, hearing this hubbub behind her, and
Cousin Zhen went forward to inves?tigate.
‘It’s one of the young acolytes,’ said Xi-feng as she helped the old lady from her
conveyance. ‘He was snuffing the candles and didn’t get away in time and now he’s
rushing around trying to find a way out.’
‘Bring him to me, poor little thing!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And don’t frighten him.
These children from poorer families have generally been rather spoiled. You can’t
expect them to stand up to great occasions like this. It would be a shame to frighten
the poor little thing out of his wits. Think how upset his mother and father would be.
Go on!’ she said to Cousin Zhen. ‘Go and fetch him yourself.’
Cousin Zhen was obliged to retrieve the little Taoist in per?son and led him by the
hand to Grandmother Jia. The boy knelt down in front of her, the snuffers — now
restored to him – clutched in one hand, trembling like a leaf. Grandmother Jia asked
Cousin Zhen to raise him to his feet.
‘Don’t be afraid,’ she told the boy. ‘How old are you?’
But the little boy’s mouth was hurting him too badly to speak.
‘Poor little thing!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You’d better take him away, Zhen. Give
him some money to buy sweeties with and tell the others that they are not to
grumble at him.’
Cousin Zhen had to promise, and led the boy away, while the old lady led her party
inside to begin a systematic tour of the shrines.
The pages in the outer courtyard, who had a moment before witnessed Grandmother
Jia and her train trooping through the gateway that led into the inner courtyard,
were surprised to see Cousin Zhen now emerging from it again with a little Taoist in
tow. They heard him say that the boy was to be taken out and given a few hundred
cash and that he was to be treated kindly. A few of them came forward and led the
child away in obedience to his instructions.
Still standing at the top of the steps to the inner gate, Cousin Zhen inquired what had
become of the stewards.
‘Steward! Steward!’ shouted the pages in unison, and al?most immediately Lin
Zhi-xiao came running out from heaven knows where, adjusting his hat with one
hand as he ran.
‘This is a big place,’ said Cousin Zhen when Lin Zhi-xiao was standing in front of him,
‘and we weren’t expecting so many here today. I want you to take all the people you
need and stay here in this courtyard with them. Those you don’t need here can wait
in the second courtyard. And pick some reliable boys to go on this gate and the two
posterns to pass word through to those outside if those inside need anything. Do you
understand? All the ladies are here today and I don’t want any outsiders to get in. Is
that understood?’
‘Yes sir!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘Sir!’
‘Well get on with it!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Where’s Rong got to?’
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Jia Rong came bounding out of the
bell-tower, buttoning his jacket as he ran.
‘Look at him!’ said Cousin Zhen irately. ‘Enjoying him-self in the cool while I am
roasting down here! Spit at him, someone.’
Long familiarity with Cousin Zhen’s temper had taught the boys that he would brook
no opposition when roused. One of them obediently stepped forward and spat in Jia
Rong’s face; then, as Cousin. Zhen continued to glare at him, he rebuked Jia Rong for
presuming to be cool while his father was still sweating outside in the sun. Jia Rong
was obliged to stand with his arms hanging submissively at his sides through?out this
public humiliation, not daring to utter a word.
The other members of Jia Rong’s generation who were present — Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia
Qin and the rest — were greatly alarmed by this outburst; indeed, even the clansmen
of Cousin Zhen’s own generation — the Jia Bins and Jia Huangs and Jia Qiongs —
were to be seen putting their hats on and slinking out, one by one, from the shadow
of the walls.
‘What are you standing here for?’ said Cousin Zhen to Jia Rong. ‘Why don’t you get
on your horse and go back home and tell your mother and that new wife of yours
that Her Old Ladyship is here with all the Rong-guo girls. Tell them they must come
here at once to wait on her.’
Jia Rong ran outside and began bawling impatiently for his horse. ‘What on earth can
have got into him that he should suddenly have picked on me like that?’ he muttered
to him?self resentfully; then, as his horse had still not arrived, he shouted angrily at
the grooms:
‘Come on, bring that horse, damn you! Are your hands tied or something?’
He would have liked to send a boy in his place, but was afraid that if he did, his father
would find out when he went back later to report; and so, when the horse arrived, he
mounted and rode off home.
Cousin Zhen was about to turn and go in again when he discovered old Abbot Zhang
at his elbow, smiling somewhat unnaturally.
‘Perhaps I don’t come in quite the same category as the others,’ said the old Taoist.
‘Perhaps I should be allowed in?side to wait on Her Old Ladyship. However. In this
inclement heat, and with so many young ladies about, I shouldn’t like to presume. I
will do whatever you say. I did just wonder whether Her Old Ladyship might ask for
me, or whether she might require a guide to take her round the shrines…How?ever.
Perhaps it would be best if I waited here.’
Cousin Zhen was aware that, though Abbot Zhang had started life a poor boy and
entered the Taoist church as ‘proxy novice of Grandmother Jia’s late husband, a
former Emperor had with his own Imperial lips conferred on him the title ‘Doctor
Mysticus’, and he now held the seals of the Board of Commissioners of the Taoist
Church, had been awarded the title ‘Doctor Serenissimus’ by the reigning sovereign,
and was addressed as ‘Holiness’ by princes, dukes and governors of provinces. He
was therefore not a man to be trifled with. Moreover he was constantly in and out of
the two mansions and on familiar terms with most of the Jia ladies. Cousin Zhen at
once became affable.
‘Oh, you’re one of the family, Papa Zhang, so let’s have no more of that kind of talk,
or I’ll take you by that old beard of yours and give it a good pull. Come on, follow
me!’
Abbot Zhang followed him inside, laughing delightedly.
Having found Grandmother Jia, Cousin Zhen ducked and smiled deferentially.
‘Papa Zhang has come to pay his respects, Grannie.’
‘Help him, then!’ said Grandmother Jia; and Cousin Zhen hurried back to where
Abbot Zhang was waiting a few yards behind him and supported him by an elbow
into her presence. The abbot prefaced his greeting with a good deal of jovial laughter.
‘Blessed Buddha of Boundless Life! And how has Your Old Ladyship been all this
while? In rude good health, I trust? And Their Ladyships, and all the younger ladies?
— also flourishing? It’s quite a while since I was at the mansion to call on Your Old
Ladyship, but I declare you look more blooming than ever!’
‘And how are you, old Holy One?’ Grandmother Jia asked him with a pleased smile.
‘Thank Your Old Ladyship for asking. I still keep pretty fit. But never mind about
that. What I want to know is, how’s our young hero been keeping, eh? We were
celebrating the blessed Nativity of the Veiled King here on the twenty-sixth. Very
select little gathering. Tasteful offerings. I thought our young friend might have
enjoyed it; but when I sent round to invite him, they told me he was out.’
‘He really was out,’ said Grandmother Jia, and turned aside to summon the ‘young
hero’; but Bao-yu had gone to the lavatory. He came hurrying forward presently.
‘Hallo, Papa Zhang! How are you?’
The old Taoist embraced him affectionately and returned his greeting.
‘He’s beginning to fill out,’ he said, addressing Grand?mother Jia.
‘He looks well enough on the outside,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘but underneath he’s
delicate. And his Pa doesn’t improve matters by forcing him to study all the time. I’m
afraid he’ll end up by making the child ill.’
‘Lately I’ve been seeing calligraphy and poems of his in all kinds of places,’ said
Abbot Zhang, ‘— all quite remarkably good. I really can’t understand why Sir Zheng is
concerned that the boy doesn’t study enough. If you ask me, I think he’s all right as
he is.’ He sighed. ‘Of course, you know who this young man reminds me of, don’t you?
Whether it’s his looks or the way he talks or the way he moves, to me he’s the spit
and image of Old Sir Jia.’
The old man’s eyes grew moist, and Grandmother Jia her?self showed a disposition
to be tearful.
‘It’s quite true,’ she said. ‘None of our children or our children’s children turned out
like him, except my Bao. Only my little Jade Boy is like his grandfather.’
‘Of course, your generation wouldn’t remember Old Sir Jia,’ Abbot Zhang said,
turning to Cousin Zhen. ‘It’s before your time. In fact, I don’t suppose even Sir She
and Sir Zheng can have a very clear recollection of what their father was like in his
prime.’
He brightened as another topic occurred to him and once more quaked with laughter.
‘I saw a most attractive young lady when I was out visiting the other day. Fourteen
this year. Seeing her put me in mind of our young friend here. It must be about time
we started thinking about a match for him, surely? In looks, intelligence, breeding,
background this girl was ideally suited. What does Your Old Ladyship feel? I didn’t
want to rush matters. I thought I’d better first wait and see what Your Old Ladyship
thought before saying anything to the family.’
‘A monk who once told the boy’s fortune said that he was not to marry young,’ said
Grandmother Jia; ‘so I think we had better wait until he is a little older before we
arrange any?thing definite. But do by all means go on inquiring for us. It doesn’t
matter whether the family is wealthy or not; as long as the girl looks all right, you can
let me know. Even if it’s a poor family, we can always help out over the expenses.
Money is no problem. It’s looks and character that count.’
‘Now come on, Papa Zhang!’ said Xi-feng when this exchange had ended. Where’s
that new amulet for my little girl? You had the nerve to send someone round the
other day for gosling satin, and of course, as we didn’t want to embar?rass the old
man by refusing, we had to send you some. So now what about that amulet?’
Abbot Zhang once more quaked with laughter.
‘Ho! ho! ho! You can tell how bad my eyes are getting; I didn’t even see you there,
dear lady, or I should have thanked you for the satin. Yes, the amulet has been ready
for some time. I was going to send it to you two days ago, but then Her Grace
unexpectedly asked us for this Pro Viventibus and I stupidly forgot all about it. It’s
still on the high altar being sanctified. I’ll go and get it for you.’
He went off, surprisingly nimbly, to the main hall of the temple and returned after a
short while carrying the amulet on a little tea-tray, using a red satin book-wrap as a
tray-cloth. Baby’s nurse took the amulet from him, and he was just about to receive
the little girl from her arms when he caught sight of Xi-feng laughing at him
mockingly.
‘Why didn’t you bring it in your hand?’ she asked him.
‘The hands get so sweaty in this weather,’ he said. ‘I thought a tray would be more
hygienic.’
‘You gave me quite a fright when I saw you coming in with that tray,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I
thought for one moment you were going to take up a collection!’
There was a loud burst of laughter from the assembled company. Even Cousin Zhen
was unable to restrain himself.
‘Monkey! Monkey!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Aren’t you afraid of going to the Hell of
Scoffers when you die and hav?ing your tongue cut out?’
‘Oh, Papa and I say what we like to each other,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He’s always telling me
I must “acquire merit” and threatening me with a short life if I don’t pay up quickly.
That’s right, isn’t it Papa?’
‘As a matter of fact I did have an ulterior motive in bringing this tray,’ said Abbot
Zhang, laughing, ‘but it wasn’t in order to make a collection, I assure you. I wanted to
ask this young gentleman here if he would be so very kind as to lend me the famous
jade for a few minutes. The tray is for carrying it out?side on, so that my Taoist
friends, some of whom have travelled long distances to be here, and my old students,
and their students, all of whom are gathered here today, may have the privilege of
examining it.’
‘My dear good man, in that case let the boy go with it round his neck and show it to
them himself!’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘No need for all this running to and fro with
trays — at your age, too!’
‘Most kind! Most considerate! — But Your Old Ladyship is deceived,’ said the abbot.
‘I may look my eighty years, but I’m still hale and hearty. No, the point is that with so
many of them here today and the weather so hot, the smell is sure to be somewhat
overpowering. Our young friend here is cer?tainly not used to it. We shouldn’t want
him to be overcome by the – ah - effluvia, should we?’
Hearing this, Grandmother Jia told Bao-yu to take off the Magic Jade and put it on
the tray. Abbot Zhang draped the crimson cloth over his hands, grasped the tray
between satin-covered thumbs and fingers, and, holding it like a sacred relic at eye
level in front of him, conveyed it reverently from the courtyard.
Grandmother Jia and the others now continued their sight?seeing. They had finished
with everything at ground level and were about to mount the stairs into the galleries
when Cousin Zhen came up to report that Abbot Zhang had re?turned with the jade.
He was followed by the smiling figure of the abbot, holding the tray in the same
reverential manner as before.
‘Well, they’ve all seen the jade now,’ he said, ‘— and very grateful they were. They
agreed that it really is a most remark?able object, and they regretted that they had
nothing of value to show their appreciation with. Here you are! — this is the best
they could do. These are all little Taoist trinkets they happened to have about them.
Nothing very special, I’m afraid; but they’d like our young friend to keep them, either
to amuse himself with or to give away to his friends.’
Grandmother Jia looked at the tray. It was covered with jewellery. There were golden
crescents, jade thumb-rings and a lot of ‘motto’ jewellery — a tiny sceptre and
persimmons with the rebus-meaning ‘success in all things’, a little quail and a vase
with corn-stalks meaning ‘peace throughout the years’, and many other designs — all
in gold — or jade — work, and much of it inlaid with pearls and precious stones.
Altogether there must have been about forty pieces.
‘What have you been up to, you naughty old man?’ she said. ‘Those men are all
poor priests - they can’t afford to give things like this away. You really shouldn’t have
done this. We can’t possibly accept them.’
‘It was their own idea, I do assure you,’ said the abbot. ‘There was nothing I could
do to stop them. If you refuse to take these things, I am afraid you will destroy my
credit with these people. They will say that I cannot really have the connection with
your honoured family that I have always claimed to have.’
After this Grandmother Jia could no longer decline. She told one of the servants to
receive the tray.
‘We obviously can’t refuse, Grannie, after what Papa Zhang has just said,’ said
Bao-yu; ‘but I really have no use for this stuff. Why not let one of the boys carry it
outside for me and I’ll distribute it to the poor?’
‘I think that’s a very good idea,’ said Grandmother Jia.
But Abbot Zhang thought otherwise and hastily inter?vened:
‘I’m sure it does our young friend credit, this charitable impulse. However.
Although these things are, as I said, of no especial value, they are — what shall I say
— objects of virtù, and if you give them to the poor, in the first place the poor won’t
have much use for them, and in the second place the objects themselves will get
spoiled. If you want to give something to the poor, a largesse of money would, I
suggest, be far more appropriate.’
‘Very well, look after this stuff for me, then,’ said Bao-yu to the servant, ‘and this
evening you will distribute a largesse.’
This being now settled, Abbot Zhang withdrew, and Grandmother Jia and her party
went up to the galleries. Grandmother Jia sat with Bao-yu and the girls in the gallery
facing the stage and Xi-feng and Li Wan sat in the east gallery. The maids all sat in the
west gallery and took it in turns to go off and wait on their mistresses.
Not long after they were all seated, Cousin Zhen came up?stairs to say that the gods
had now chosen which plays were to be performed — by which was meant, of course,
that the names had been shaken from a pot in front of the altar, since this was the
only way in which the will of the gods could be known. The first play selected was
The White Serpent.
‘What’s the story?’ said Grandmother Jia.
Cousin Zhen explained that it was about the emperor Gao-?zu, founder of the Han
dynasty, who began his rise to great?ness by decapitating a monstrous white snake.
The second choice was A Heap of Honours, which shows the sixtieth birthday party
of the great Tang general Guo Zi-yi, attended by his seven sons and eight sons-in-law,
all of whom held high office, the ‘heap of honours’ of the title being a reference to
the table in his reception-hall piled high with their insignia.
‘It seems a bit conceited to have this second one played,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Still, if that’s what the gods chose, I suppose we’d better have it. What’s the third
one going to be?’
‘The South Branch,’ said Cousin Zhen.
Grandmother Jia was silent. She knew that The South Branch likens the world to an
ant-heap and tells a tale of power and glory which turns out in the end to have been
a dream.
Hearing no reply, Cousin Zhen went off downstairs again to see about the Offertory
Scroll, which had to be ceremonially burnt in front of the holy images along with
paper money and paper ingots before the theatrical performance could begin.
Our record omits any description of that ceremony and moves back to Bao-yu, who
was sitting in the central gallery beside his grandmother, and who now called for a
maid to bring the tray up so that he could put on his Magic Jade again. When he had
done so, he began to pick over the other trinkets with which the tray was covered
and to hand them one by one to Grandmother Jia for her inspection. Her atten?tion
was taken by a little red-gold kylin with kingfisher-feather inlay. She stretched out her
hand to take it.
‘Now where have I seen something like this before?’ she said. ‘I feel certain I’ve
seen some girl wearing an ornament like this.’
‘Cousin Shi’s got one,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s the same as this one only a little smaller.’
‘Funny!’ said Bao-yu. ‘All the times she’s been to our house, I don’t remember ever
having seen it.’
‘Cousin Ban is observant,’ said Tan-chun. ‘No matter what it is, she remembers
everything.’
‘Well, perhaps not quite everything,’ said Dai-yu wryly. ‘But she’s certainly very
observant where things like this are con?cerned.’
Bao-chai turned her head away and pretended not to have heard.
Now that he knew the kylin on the tray was like one that Shi Xiang-yun wore, Bao-yu
hurriedly picked it up and thrust it inside his jacket. But no sooner had he done so
than it occurred to him that his action might be misconstrued; so instead of dropping
it into his inside pocket, he continued to hold it there, at the same time glancing
about him furtively to see if he had been observed. None of the others seemed to
have noticed except Dai-yu, who was staring at him fixedly and nodding her head in
mock approval.
Bao-yu felt suddenly embarrassed. Drawing his hand out again with the ornament
still in it, he returned her look and laughed sheepishly:
‘It’s rather nice, isn’t it? I thought I’d keep it for you,’ he said. ‘When we get home
we can thread it on a ribbon and you’ll be able to wear it.’
Dai-yu tossed her head.
‘I don’t want it!’
‘If you don’t want it, I’ll keep it for myself, then,’ said Bao?-yu, and popped it once
more inside his jacket.
He was about to add something, but just at that moment Cousin Zhen’s wife, You-shi,
and his new daughter-in-law, Hu-shi, arrived and came upstairs to pay their respects
to Grandmother Jia.
‘ Now why have you come here? You really shouldn’t have bothered,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘We only came to amuse ourselves. It isn’t a formal visit.’
No sooner had she said this than it was announced that representatives from General
Feng’s household had arrived. It appeared that Feng Zi-ying’s mother, hearing that
the Jia ladies were having a Pro Viventibus performed at the Taoist temple, had
immediately prepared an offering of pork, mutton, incense, tea and cakes and sent it
post-haste to the temple with her compliments. Xi-feng, hearing the announcement,
came hurrying round to the central gallery. She clapped her hands and laughed.
‘Dear oh dear! This is something I hadn’t bargained for. My idea was a quiet little
outing for us girls; but here is everyone sending offerings and behaving as if we’d
come here for a high mass or something. It’s all your fault, Grannie! And we haven’t
even got any vails ready to give to the beaters.’
Even as she said this, two stewardesses from the Feng house?hold were already
mounting the stairs. And before ‘hey had gone, other messengers arrived with
offerings from Vice-president Zhao’s lady. From then on it was a steady stream:
friends, kinsmen, family connections, business associates - all who had heard that the
Jia ladies were holding a Pro Viven?tibus sent their representatives along with
offerings and com?plimentary messages. Grandmother Jia began to regret that she
had ever come.
‘It isn’t as if we’d come here for the ceremony,’ she grumb?led. ‘We only wanted to
enjoy ourselves. But all we seem to have done is to have stirred up a lot of fuss.’
Consequently, although she stayed and watched the plays for that day, she returned
home fairly early in the afternoon and next day professed herself too lacking in
energy to go again. Xi-feng reacted differently. ‘In for a penny, in for a pound’ was her
motto. They had already had the fuss; and since the players were there anyway, they
might as well go again today and enjoy themselves in peace.
For Bao-yu the whole of the previous day had been spoilt by Abbot Zhang’s proposal
to Grandmother Jia to arrange a match for him. He came home in a thoroughly bad
temper and kept telling everyone that he would ‘never see Abbot Zhang again as
long as he lived’. Not associating his ill-humour with the abbot’s proposal, the others
were mystified.
Grandmother Jia’s unwillingness was further reinforced by the fact that Dai-yu, since
her return home yesterday, had been suffering from mild sunstroke. What with one
thing and another, the old lady declined absolutely to go again, and Xi-?feng had to
make up her own party and go by herself.
But Xi-feng’s play-going does not concern us.

*
Bao-yu, believing that Dai-yu’s sunstroke was serious and that she might even be in
danger of her life, was so worried that he could not eat, and rushed round in the
middle of the lunch-hour to see how she was. He found her neither as ill as he had
feared nor as responsive as he might have hoped.
‘Why don’t you go and watch your plays?’ she asked him. ‘What are you mooning
about at home for?’
Abbot Zhang’s recent attempt at match-making had profoundly distressed Bao-yu
and he was shocked by her seeming indifference.
‘I can forgive the others for not understanding what has upset me,’ he thought; ‘but
that she should want to trifle with me at a time like this…!’
The sense that she had failed him made the annoyance he now felt with her a
hundred times greater than it had been on any previous occasion. Never could any
other person have stirred him to such depths of atrabilious rage. Coming from other
lips, her words would scarcely have touched him. Com?ing from hers, they put him in
a passion. His face darkened.
‘It’s all along been a mistake, then,’ he said. ‘You’re not what I took you for.’
Dai-yu gave an unnatural little laugh.
‘Not what you took me for? That’s hardly surprising, is it? I haven’t got that little
something which would have made me worthy of you.’
Bao-yu came tight up to her and held his face close to hers:
‘You do realize, don’t you, that you are deliberately willing my death?’
Dai-yu could not for the moment understand what he was talking about.
‘I swore an oath to you yesterday,’ he went on. ‘I said that I hoped Heaven might
strike me dead if this “gold and jade” business meant anything to me. Since you have
now brought it up again, it’s clear to me that you want me to die. Though what you
hope to gain by my death I find it hard to imagine.’
Dai-yu now remembered what had passed between them on the previous day. She
knew that she was wrong to have spoken as she did, and felt both ashamed and a
little frightened. Her shoulders started shaking and she began to cry.
‘May Heaven strike me dead if I ever willed your death!’ she said. ‘But I don’t see
what you have to get so worked up about. It’s only because of what Abbot Zhang said
about arranging a match for you. You’re afraid he might interfere with your precious
“gold and jade” plans; and because you’re angry about that, you have to come along
and take it out on me — That’s all it is, isn’t it?’
Bao-yu had from early childhood manifested a streak of morbid sensibility, which
being brought up in close proximity with a nature so closely in harmony with his own
had done little to improve. Now that he had reached an age when both his
experience and the reading of forbidden books had taught him something about
‘worldly matters’, he had begun to take a rather more grown-up interest in girls. But
although there were plenty of young ladies of outstanding beauty and breed?ing
among the Jia family’s numerous acquaintance, none of them, in his view, could
remotely compare with Dai-yu. For some time now his feeling for her had been a
very special one; but precisely because of this same morbid sensibility, he had shrunk
from telling her about it. Instead, whenever he was feeling particularly happy or
particularly cross, he would in?vent all sorts of ways of probing her to find out if this
feeling for her was reciprocated. It was unfortunate for him that Dai-yu herself
possessed a similar streak of morbid sensibility and disguised her real feelings, as he
did his, while attempting to discover what he felt about her.
Here was a situation, then, in which both parties concealed their real emotions and
assumed counterfeit ones in an en?deavour to find out what the real feelings of the
other party were. And because when false meets false the truth will oft-times out,
there was the constant possibility that the innumerable little frustrations that were
engendered by all this concealment would eventually erupt into a quarrel.
Take the present instance. What Bao-yu was actually think?ing at this moment was
something like this:
‘In my eyes and in my thoughts there is no one else but you. I can forgive the others
for not knowing this, but surely you ought to realize? If at a time like this you can’t
share my anxiety — if you can think of nothing better to do than provoke me with
that sort of silly talk, it shows that the concern I feel for you every waking minute of
the day is wasted: that you just don’t care about me at all.’
This was what he thought; but of course be didn’t say it. On her side Dai-yu’s
thoughts were somewhat as follows:
‘I know you must care for me a little bit, and I’m sure you don’t take this ridiculous
“gold and jade” talk seriously. But if you cared only for me and had absolutely no
inclination at all in another direction, then every time I mentioned “gold and jade”
you would behave quite naturally and let it pass almost as if you hadn’t noticed. How
is it, then, that when I do refer to it you get so excited? It shows that it must be on
your mind. You pretend to be upset in order to allay my suspicions.’
Meanwhile a quite different thought was running through Bao-yu’s mind.
‘I would do anything — absolutely anything,’ he was think?ing, ‘if only you would
be nice to me. If you would be nice to me, I would gladly die for you this moment. It
doesn’t really matter whether you know what I feel for you or not. Just be nice to me,
then at least we shall be a little closer to each other, instead of so horribly far apart.’
At the same time Dai-yu was thinking:
‘Never mind me. Just be your own natural self. If yon were all right, I should be all
right too. All these manoeuvrings to try and anticipate my feelings don’t bring us any
closer to?gether; they merely draw us farther apart.’
The percipient reader will no doubt observe that these two young people were
already of one mind, but that the com?plicated procedures by which they sought to
draw together were in fact having precisely the opposite effect. Complacent reader!
Permit us to remind you that your correct under?standing of the situation is due
solely to the fact that we have been revealing to you the secret, innermost thoughts
of those two young persons, which neither of them had so far ever felt able to
express.
Let us now return from the contemplation of inner thoughts to the recording of
outward appearances.
When Dai-yu, far from saying something nice to him, once more made reference to
the ‘gold and jade’, Bao-yu became so choked with rage that for a moment he was
quite literally bereft of speech. Frenziedly snatching the ‘Magic Jade’ from his neck
and holding it by the end of its silken cord he gritted his teeth and dashed it against
the floor with all the strength in his body.
‘Beastly thing!’ he shouted. ‘I’ll smash you to pieces and put an end to this once
and for all.’
But the jade, being exceptionally hard and resistant, was not the tiniest bit damaged.
Seeing that he had not broken it, Bao-yu began to look around for something to
smash it with. Dai-yu, still crying, saw what he was going to do.
‘Why smash a dumb, lifeless object?’ she said. ‘If you want to smash something, let
it be me.’
The sound of their quarrelling brought Nightingale and Snowgoose hurrying in to
keep the peace. They found Bao-yu apparently bent on destroying his jade and tried
to wrest it from him. Failing to do so, and sensing that the quarrel was of more than
usual dimensions, they went off to fetch Aroma. Aroma came back with them as fast
as she could run and eventually succeeded in prising the jade from his hand. He
glared at her scornfully.
‘It’s my own thing I’m smashing,’ he said. ‘What business is it of yours to interfere?’
Aroma saw that his face was white with anger and his eyes wild and dangerous.
Never had she seen him in so terrible a rage. She took him gently by the hand:
‘You shouldn’t smash the jade just because of a disagree?ment with your cousin,’
she said. ‘What do you think she would feel like and what sort of position would it
put her in if you really were to break it?’
Dai-yu heard these words through her sobs. They struck a responsive chord in her
breast, and she wept all the harder to think that even Aroma seemed to understand
her better than Bao-yu did. So much emotion was too much for her weak stomach.
Suddenly there was a horrible retching noise and up came the tisane of elsholtzia
leaves she had taken only a short while before. Nightingale quickly held out her
handkerchief to receive it and, while Snowgoose rubbed and pounded her back,
Dai-yu continued to retch up wave upon wave of watery vomit, until the whole
handkerchief was soaked with it.
‘However cross you may be, Miss, you ought to have more regard for your health,’
said Nightingale. ‘You’d only just taken that medicine and you were beginning to feel
a little bit better for it, and now because of your argument with Master Bao you’ve
gone and brought it all up again. Suppose you were to be really ill as a consequence.
How do you think Master Bao would feel?’
When Bao-yu heard these words they struck a responsive chord in his breast, and he
reflected bitterly that even Nightin?gale seemed to understand him better than
Dai-yu But then he looked again at Dai-yu, who was sobbing and panting by turns,
and whose red and swollen face was wet with perspira?tion and tears, and seeing
how pitiably frail and ill she looked, his heart misgave him.
‘I shouldn’t have taken her up on that “gold and jade” business,’ he thought. ‘I’ve
got her into this state and now there’s no way in which I can relieve her by sharing
what she suffers.’ As he thought this, he, too, began to cry.
Now that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were both crying, Aroma instinctively drew towards her
master to comfort him. A pang of pity for him passed through her and she squeezed
his hand sympathetically. It was as cold as ice. She would have liked to tell him not to
cry but hesitated, partly from the consideration that he might be suffering from some
deep-concealed hurt which crying would do something to relieve, and partly from
the fear that to do so in Dai-yu’s presence might seem pre?sumptuous. Torn between
a desire to speak and fear of the possible consequences of speaking, she did what
girls of her type often do when faced with a difficult decision: she avoided the
necessity of making one by bursting into tears.
As for Nightingale, who had disposed of the handkerchief of vomited tisane and was
now gently fanning her mistress with her fan, seeing the other three all standing
there as quiet as mice with the tears streaming down their faces, she was so
affected by the sight that she too started crying and was obliged to have recourse to
a second handkerchief.
There the four of them stood, then, facing each other; all of them crying; none of
them saying a word. It was Aroma who broke the silence with a strained and nervous
laugh.
‘You ought not to quarrel with Miss Lin,’ she said to Bao-yu, ‘if only for the sake of
this pretty cord she made you.’
At these words Dai-yu, ill as she was, darted forward, grabbed the jade from Aroma’s
hand, and snatching up a pair of scissors that were lying nearby, began feverishly
cutting at its silken cord with them. Before Aroma and Nightingale could stop her, she
had already cut it into several pieces.
‘It was a waste of time making it,’ she sobbed. ‘He doesn’t really care for it. And
there’s someone else who’ll no doubt make him a better one!’
‘What a shame!’ said Aroma, retrieving the jade. ‘It’s all my silly fault. I should have
kept my mouth shut.’
‘Go on! Cut away!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shan’t be wearing the wretched thing again
anyway, so it doesn’t matter.’
Preoccupied with the quarrel, the four of them had failed to notice several old
women, who had been drawn by the sound of it to investigate. Apprehensive, when
they saw Dai?-yu hysterically weeping and vomiting and Bao-yu trying to smash his
jade, of the dire consequences to be expected from a scene of such desperate
passion, they had hurried off in a body to the front of the mansion to report the
matter to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, hoping in this way to establish in advance
that whatever the consequences might be, they were not responsible for them. From
their precipitate entry and the grave tone of their announcement Grandmother Jia
and Lady Wang assumed that some major catastrophe had befallen and hurried with
them into the Garden to find out what it was.
Their arrival filled Aroma with alarm. ‘What did Nightin?gale want to go troubling
Their Ladyships for?’ she thought crossly, supposing that the talebearer had been
sent to them by Nightingale; while Nightingale for her part was angry with Aroma,
thinking that the talebearer must have been one of Aroma’s minions.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang entered the room to find a silent Bao-yu and a silent
Dai-yu, neither of whom, when questioned, would admit that anything at all was the
matter. They therefore visited their wrath on the beads of the two unfortunate maids,
insisting that it was entirely owing to their negligence that matters had got so much
out of hand. Unable to defend themselves, the girls were obliged to endure a long
and abusive dressing-down, after which Grandmother Jia concluded the affair by
carrying Bao-yu off to her own apart?ment.
Next day, the third of the fifth month, was Xue Pan’s birthday and there was a family
party with plays, to which the Jias were all invited. Bao-yu, who had still not seen
Dai-yu since his outburst — which he now deeply regretted — was feeling far too
dispirited to care about seeing plays, and declined to go on the ground that he was
feeling unwell.
Dai-yu, though somewhat overcome on the day previous to this by the sultry weather,
had by no means been seriously ill. Arguing that if she was not ill, it was impossible
that he should be, she felt sure, when she heard of Bao-yu’s excuse, that it must be a
false one.
‘He usually enjoys drinking and watching plays,’ she thought. ‘If he’s not going, it
must be because he is still angry about yesterday; or if it isn’t that, it must be
because he’s heard that I’m not going and doesn’t want to go without me. Oh! I
should never have cut that cord! Now he won’t ever wear his jade again - unless I
make him another cord to wear it on.’
So she, too, regretted the quarrel.
Grandmother Jia knew that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were angry with each other, but she
had been assuming that they would see each other at the Xues’ party and make it up
there. When neither of them turned up at it, she became seriously upset.
‘I’m a miserable old sinner,’ she grumbled. It must be my punishment for something
I did wrong in a past life to have to live with a pair of such obstinate, addle-headed
little geese! I’m sure there isn’t a day goes by without their giving me some fresh
cause for anxiety. It must he fate. That’s what it says in the proverb, after all:
                       ’Tis Fate brings foes and lo’es tegither.
I’ll be glad when I’ve drawn my last breath and closed my old eyes for the last time;
then the two of them can snap and snarl at each other to their hearts’ content, for I
shan’t be there to see it, and “what the eye doesn’t see, the heart doesn’t grieve”.
The Lord knows, it’s not my wish to drag on this wearisome life any longer!’
Amidst these muttered grumblings the old lady began to cry.
In due course her words were transmitted to Bao-yu and Dai-yu. It happened that
neither of them had ever heard the saying
                       ’Tis Fate brings foes and lo’es tegither,

and its impact on them, hearing it for the first time, was like that of a Zen
‘perception’ something to be meditated on with bowed head and savoured with a
gush of tears. Though they had still not made it up since their quarrel, the difference
between them had now vanished completely:
                In Naiad’s House one to the wind made moan,
                In Green Delights one to the moon complained,
to parody the well-known lines. Or, in homelier verses:

                 Though each was in a different place,
                 Their hearts in friendship beat as one.

On the second day after their quarrel Aroma deemed that the time was now ripe for
urging a settlement.
‘Whatever the rights and wrongs of all this may be,’ she said to Bao-yu, ‘you are
certainly the one who is most to blame. Whenever in the past you’ve heard about a
quarrel between one of the pages and one of the girls, you’ve always said that the
boy was a brute for not understanding the girl’s feelings better — yet here you are
behaving in exactly the same way yourself! Tomorrow will be the Double Fifth. Her
Old Ladyship will be really angry if the two of you are still at daggers drawn on the
day of the festival, and that will make life difficult for all of us. Why not put your
pride in your pocket and go and say you are sorry, so that we can all get back to
normal again?’
But as to whether or not Bao-yu followed her advice, or, if he did so, what the effect
of following it was - those ques?tions will be dealt with in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 30

Bao-chai speaks of a fan and castigates her deriders
Charmante scratches a ‘qiang’ and mystifies a beholder

Dai-yu, as we have shown, regretted her quarrel with Bao-yu almost as soon as it was
over; but since there were no con?ceivable grounds on which she could run after him
and tell him so, she continued, both day and night, in a state of un?relieved
depression that made her feel almost as if a part of her was lost. Nightingale had a
shrewd idea how it was with her and resolved at last to tackle her:
‘I think the day before yesterday you were too hasty, Miss. We ought to know what
things Master Bao is touchy about, if no one else does. Look at all the quarrels we’ve
had with him in the past on account of that jade!’
‘Poh!’ said Dai-yu scornfully. ‘You are trying to make out that it was my fault
because you have taken his side against me. Of course I wasn’t too hasty.’
Nightingale gave her a quizzical smile.
‘No? Then why did you cut that cord up? If three parts of the blame was Bao-yu’s,
I’m sure at least seven parts of it was yours. From what I’ve seen of it, he’s all right
with you when you allow him to be; it’s because you’re so prickly with him and
always trying to put him in the wrong that he gets worked up.’
Dai-yu was about to retort when they heard someone at the courtyard gate calling to
be let in. Nightingale turned to listen:
‘That’s Bao-yu’s voice,’ she said. ‘I expect he has come to apologize.’
‘I forbid you to let him in,’ said Dai-yu.
‘There you go again!’ said Nightingale. ‘You’re going to keep him standing outside in
the blazing sun on a day like this. Surely that’s wrong, if nothing else is?’
She was moving outside, even as she said this, regardless of her mistress’s injunction.
Sure enough, it was Bao-yu. She un?fastened the gate and welcomed him in with a
friendly smile.
‘Master Bao! I was beginning to think you weren’t coming to see us any more, I
certainly didn’t expect to see you here again so soon.’
‘Oh, you’ve been making a mountain out of a molehill,’ said Bao-yu, returning her
smile. ‘Why ever shouldn’t I come? Even if I died, my ghost would be round here a
hundred times a day. How is my cousin? Quite better now?’
‘Physically she’s better,’ said Nightingale, ‘but she’s still in very poor spirits.’
‘Ah yes — I know she’s upset.’
This exchange took place as they were crossing the fore?court. He now entered the
room. Dai-yu was sitting on the bed crying. She had not been crying to start with, but
the bittersweet pang she experienced when she heard his arrival had started the
tears rolling. Bao-yu went up to the bed and smiled down at her.
‘How are you, coz? Quite better now?’
As Dai-yu seemed to be too busy wiping her eyes to make a reply, he sat down close
beside her on the edge of the bed:
‘I know you’re not really angry with me,’ he said. ‘It’s just that if the others noticed I
wasn’t coming here, they would think we had been quarrelling; and if we waited for
them to interfere, we should be allowing other people to come be?tween us. It
would be better to hit me and shout at me now and get it over with, if you still bear
any hard feelings, than to go on ignoring me. Coz dear! Coz dear! -’
He must have repeated those same two words in the same tone of passionate
entreaty upwards of twenty times. Dai-yu had been meaning to ignore him, but what
he had just been saying about other people ‘coming between’ them seemed to prove
that he must in some way feel closer to her than the rest, and she was unable to
maintain her silence.
‘You don’t have to treat me like a child,’ she blurted out tearfully. ‘From now on I
shall make no further claims on you. You can behave exactly as if I had gone away.’
‘Gone away?’ said Bao-yu laughingly. ‘Where would you go to?’
‘Back home.’
‘I’d follow you.’
‘As if I were dead then.’
‘If you died,’ he said, ‘I should become a monk.’
Dai-yu’s face darkened immediately:
‘What an utterly idiotic thing to say! Suppose your own sisters were to die? Just
how many times can one person become a monk? I think I had better see what the
others think about that remark.’
Bao-yu had realized at once that she would be offended; but the words were already
out of his mouth before he could stop them. He turned very red and hung his head in
silence. It was a good thing that no one else was in the room at that moment to see
him. Dai-yu glared at him for some seconds - evidently too enraged to speak, for she
made a sound somewhere be?tween a snort and a sigh, but said nothing - then,
seeing him almost purple in the face with suppressed emotion, she clenched her
teeth, pointed her finger at him, and, with an indignant ‘Hmn!’, stabbed the air quite
savagely a few inches away from his forehead:
‘You—!’
But whatever it was she had been going to call him never got said. She merely gave a
sigh and began wiping her eyes again with her handkerchief.
Bao-yu had been in a highly emotional state when he came to see Dai-yu and it had
further upset him to have inadvertent?ly offended her so soon after his arrival. This
angry gesture and the unsuccessful struggle, ending in sighs and tears, to say what
she wanted to say now affected him so deeply that he, too, began to weep. In need
of a handkerchief but finding that he had come out without one, he wiped his eyes
on his sleeve.
Although Dai-yu was crying, the spectacle of Bao-yu using the sleeve of his
brand-new lilac-coloured summer gown as a handkerchief had not escaped her, and
while continuing to wipe her own eyes with one hand, she leaned over and reached
with the other for the square of silk that was draped over the head-rest at the end of
the bed. She lifted it off and threw it at him — all without uttering a word - then,
once more burying her face in her own handkerchief, resumed her weeping. Bao-?yu
picked up the handkerchief she had thrown him and hur?riedly wiped his eyes with it.
When he had dried them, he drew up close to her again and took one of her hands in
his own, smiling at her gently.
‘I don’t know why you go on crying,’ he said. ‘I feel as if all my insides were
shattered. Come! Let’s go and see Grandmother together.’
Dai-yu flung off his hand.
‘Take your hands off me! We’re not children any more. You really can’t go on
mauling me about like this all the time. Don’t you understand anything —?’
‘Bravo!’
The shouted interruption startled them both. They spun round to look just as Xi-feng,
full of smiles, came bustling into the room.
‘Grandmother has been grumbling away something awful,’ she said. ‘She insisted
that I should come over and see if you were both all right. “Oh,” I said, “there’s no
need to go and look, Grannie; they’ll have made it up by now without any
interference from us.” So she told me I was lazy. Well, here I am — and of course it’s
exactly as I said it would be. I don’t know. I don’t understand you two. What is it you
find to argue about? For every three days that you’re friends you must spend at least
two days quarrelling. You really are a couple of babies. And the older you get, the
worse you get. Look at you now — holding hands crying! And a couple of days ago
you were glaring at each other like fighting-cocks. Come on! Come with me to see
Grandmother. Let’s put the old lady’s mind at rest.’
As she said this, she seized Dai-yu’s hand and began march?ing off with her. Dai-yu
turned back and called for her maids, but there was no response.
‘What do you want to call them for?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’ve got me to wait on you,
haven’t you?’
She continued to walk away, still holding Dai-yu by the hand. Bao-yu followed a little
way behind. They went out of the Garden and through into Grandmother Jia’s
apartment.
‘I told you they could be left to themselves to make it up and that there was no
need for you to worry,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when they were all in the old
lady’s pre?sence; ‘but you wouldn’t believe me, would you? You insisted on my going
there to act the peacemaker. Well, I went there; and what did I find? I found the two
of them together apolo?gizing to each other. It was like the kite and the kestrel
holding hands: they were positively locked in a clinch! No need of a peacemaker that
I could see.’
There was a burst of laughter from all present. Bao-chai was among these, but Dai-yu
slipped past her without speaking and took a seat next to Grandmother Jia. Bao-yu,
rather at a loss for something to say, turned to Bao-chai.
‘I’m afraid I’ wasn’t very well on your brother’s birthday; so apart from not giving
him a present, I couldn’t even make him a kotow this year. I’m afraid he may not have
realized I was ill and thought that I was merely making excuses. If you can spare a
moment next time you see him, I do hope you will explain to him for me.’
Bao-chai looked amused.
‘That seems a trifle excessive. I am sure he would have felt uncomfortable about
your kotowing to him, even if you had been able to come; so I’m quite sure he
wouldn’t have wanted you to come when you weren’t feeling well. It would be rather
unfriendly, surely, if cousins who see each other all the time were to start worrying
about trifles like that?’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘Well, as long as yon understand, that’s all right. But why aren’t you watching the
players?’
‘I can’t stand the heat,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I did watch a couple of acts of something,
but it was so hot that I couldn’t stay any longer. Unfortunately none of the guests
showed any sign of going, so I had to pretend I was ill in order to get away.’
‘Touché!’ thought Bao-yu; but he hid his embarrassment in a stupid laugh.
‘No wonder they compare you to Yang Gui-fei, cousin. You are well-covered like her,
and they always say that plump people fear the heat.’
The colour flew into Bao-chai’s face. An angry retort was on her lips, but she could
hardly make it in front of company. Yet reflection only made her angrier. Eventually,
after a scorn?ful sniff or two, she said:
‘I may be like Yang Gui-fei in some respects, but I don’t think there is much danger
of my cousin becoming a Prime Minister.’
It happened that just at that moment a very young maid called ‘Prettikins’ jokingly
accused Bao-chai of having hid?den a fan she was looking for.
‘I know Miss Bao’s hidden it,’ she said, ‘Come on, Miss! Please let me have it.’
‘You be careful,’ said Bao-chai, pointing at the girl angrily and speaking with
unwonted stridency. ‘When did you last see me playing games of this sort with
anyone? If there are other young ladies who are in the habit of romping about with
you, you had better ask them.’
Prettikins fled.
Bao-yu realized that he had once again given offence by speaking thoughtlessly; and
as this time it was in front of a lot of people, his embarrassment was correspondingly
greater. He turned aside in confusion and began talking nervously to someone else.
Bao-yu’s rudeness to Bao-chai had given Dai-yu secret satisfaction. When Prettikins
came in looking for her fan, she had been on the point of adding some facetiousness
of her own at Bao-chai’s expense; but Bao-chai’s brief explosion caused her to drop
the prepared witticism and ask instead what play the two acts were from that
Bao-chai said she had just been watching.
Bao-chai had observed the smirk on Dai-yu’s face and knew very well that Bao-yu’s
rudeness must have pleased her. The smiling answer she gave to Dai-yu’s question
was therefore not without a touch of malice.
‘The play I saw was Li Kui Abuses Song Jiang and After?wards Has to Say He Is
Sorry.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘What a mouthful! Surely, with all your learning, cousin, you must know the proper
name of that play? It’s called The Abject Apology.’
‘The Abject Apology?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Well, no doubt you clever people know all
there is to know about abject apology. I’m afraid it’s something I wouldn’t know
about.’
Her words touched Bao-yu and Dai-yu on a sensitive spot, and by the time she had
finished, they were both blushing hotly with embarrassment.
Xi-feng was insufficiently educated to have understood all these nuances, but by
studying the speakers’ expressions she had formed a pretty good idea of what they
were talking about.
‘Rather hot weather to be eating raw ginger, isn’t it?’ she asked.
No one present could understand what she meant.
‘No one’s been eating raw ginger,’ they said.
Xi-feng affected great surprise and rubbed her cheek mean?ingfully with her hand:
‘If no one’s been eating raw ginger, then why are they look?ing so hot and
bothered?’
At this Bao-yu and Dai-yu felt even more uncomfortable. Bao-chai was about to add
something, but seeing the abject look on Bao-yu’s face, she laughed and held her
tongue. None of the others present had understood what the four of them were
talking about and treated these exchanges as a joke.
Shortly after this, when Bao-chai and Xi-feng had gone out of the room, Dai-yu said
to Bao-yu.
‘You see? There are people even more dangerous to trifle with than I. If I weren’t
such a tongue-tied, slow-witted creature, you wouldn’t get away with it quite so
often, my friend.’
Bao-yu was still smarting from Bao-chai’s testiness. To be set upon now by Dai-yu as
well seemed positively the last straw. But though he wanted to reply, he knew how
easily she would take offence and controlled himself with an effort. Feel?ing in very
low spirits, he left the room himself now and went off on his own.
It was the hottest part of the day. Lunch had long been over, and in every apartment
mistress and maids alike had succumbed to the lassitude of the hour. As he sauntered
slow?ly by, hands clasped behind his back, everywhere he went was hushed in the
breathless silence of noon. From the back of Grandmother Jia’s quartets he passed
eastwards through the gallery that ended near the wall of Xi-feng’s courtyard. He
went up to the gate, but it was closed, and remembering that it was her invariable
custom when the weather was hot to take two whole hours off in the middle of the
day for her siesta, he thought he had better not go in. He continued, instead, through
the corner gate that led into his parents’ courtyard.
On entering his mother’s apartment, he found several maids dozing over their
embroidery. Lady Wang herself was lying on a summer-bed in the inner room,
apparently fast asleep. Her maid Golden, who was sitting beside her gently pounding
her legs, also seemed half asleep, for her head was nodding and her half-closed eyes
were blinking drowsily. Bao-yu tiptoed up to her and tweaked an ear-ring. She
opened her eyes wide and saw that it was Bao-yu.
He smiled at her and whispered.
‘So sleepy?’
Golden pursed her lips up in a smile, motioned to him with her hand to go away, and
then closed her eyes again. But Bao-yu lingered, fascinated. Silently craning forward
to make sure that Lady Wang’s eyes were closed, he took a Fragrant Snow ‘quencher’
from the embroidered pouch at his waist and popped it between Golden’s lips.
Golden nibbled it dreamily without opening her eyes.
‘Shall I ask Her Ladyship to let me have you, so that we can be together?’ he
whispered jokingly.
Golden made no reply.
‘When she wakes up, I’ll talk to her about it,’ he said.
Golden opened her eyes wide and gave him a little push.
‘What’s the hurry?’ she said playfully. ‘“Yours is yours, wherever it be”, as they said
to the lady when she dropped her gold comb in the well. Haven’t you ever heard that
saying? — I’ll tell you something to do, if you want a bit of fun. Go into the little east
courtyard and you’ll be able to catch Sunset and Huan together.’
‘Who cares about them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let’s talk about us.’ At this point Lady Wang
sat bolt upright and dealt Golden a slap in the face.
‘Shameless little harlot!’ she cried, pointing at bet wrath-fully. ‘It’s you and your like
who corrupt our innocent young boys.’
Bao-yu had slipped silently away as soon as his mother sat up. Golden, one of whose
cheeks was now burning a fiery red, was left without a word to say. The other maids,
hearing that their mistress was awake, came hurrying into the room.
‘Silver!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Go and fetch your mother. I want her to take your sister
Golden away.’
Golden threw herself, weeping, upon her knees:
‘No, Your Ladyship, please! Beat me and revile me as much as you like, but please,
for pity’s sake, don’t send me away. I’ve been with Your Ladyship nigh on ten years
now. How can I ever hold up my head again if you dismiss me?’
Lady Wang was not naturally unkind. On the contrary, she was an exceptionally
lenient mistress. This was, in fact, the first time in her life that she had ever struck a
maid. But the kind of ‘shamelessness’ of which — in her view - Golden had just been
guilty was the one thing she had always most abhorred. It was the uncontrollable
anger of the morally out?raged that had caused her to strike Golden and call her
names; and though Golden now begged and pleaded, she refused to retract her
dismissal. When Golden’s mother, old Mrs Bai, had eventually been fetched, the
wretched girl, utterly crushed by her shame and humiliation, was led away.
But of her no more.

*
Embarrassed by his mother’s awakening, Bao-yu had slipped hurriedly into the
Garden.
The burning sun was now in the height of heaven, the con?tracted shadows were
concentrated darkly beneath the trees, and the stillness of noon, filled with the harsh
trilling of cicadas, was broken by no human voice; but as he approached the bamboo
trellises of the rose-garden, a sound like a suppressed sob seemed to come from
inside the pergola. Uncer?tain what it was that he had heard, he stopped to listen.
Undoubtedly there was someone there.
This was the fifth month of the year, when the rambler roses are in fullest bloom.
Peeping through the fragrant panicles with which the pergola was smothered, he saw
a girl crouching down on the other side of the trellis, scratching at the ground with
one of those long, blunt pins that girls use for fastening their back hair with.
‘Can this be some silly maid come here to bury flowers like Frowner?’ he
wondered.
He was reminded of Zhuang-zi’s story of the beautiful Xi-?shi’s ugly neighbour, whose
endeavours to imitate the little frown that made Xi-shi captivating produced an
aspect so hideous that people ran from her in terror. The recollection of it made him
smile.
‘This is “imitating the Frowner” with a vengeance,’ he thought, ‘- if that is really
what she is doing. Not merely un?original, but downright disgusting!”
‘Don’t imitate Miss Lin,’ he was about to shout; but a glimpse of the girl’s face
revealed to him just in time that this was no maid, but one of the twelve little
actresses from Pear?-tree Court – though which of them, since he had seen them
only in their make-up on the stage, he was unable to make out. He stuck out his
tongue in a grimace and clapped a hand to his mouth.
‘Good job I didn’t speak too soon,’ he thought. ‘I’ve been in trouble twice already
today for doing that, once with Frowner and once with Chai. It only needs me to go
and upset these twelve actresses as well and I shall be well and truly in the cart!’
His efforts to identify the girl made him study her more closely. It was curious that he
should have thought her an imitator of Dai-yu, for she had much of Dai-yu’s ethereal
grace in her looks: the same delicate face and frail, slender body; the same
... brows like hills in spring,
And eyes like autumn’s limpid pools;


— even the same little frown that had often made him compare Dai-yu with Xi-shi of
the legend.
It was now quite impossible for him to tear himself away. He watched her fascinated.
As he watched, he began to see that what she was doing with the pin was not
scratching a hole to bury flowers in, but writing. He followed the movements of her
hand, and each vertical and horizontal stroke, each dot and hook that she made he
copied with a finger on the palm of his hand. Altogether there were eighteen strokes.
He thought for a moment. The character he had just written in his hand was QIANG.
The name of the roses which covered the pergola contained the same character:
‘Qiang-wei’.
‘The sight of the roses has inspired her to write a poem,’ he thought. ‘Probably
she’s just thought of a good couplet and wants to write it down before she forgets it;
or perhaps she has already composed several lines and wants to work on them a bit.
Let’s see what she writes next.’
The girl went on writing, and he followed the movements of her hand as before. It
was another QIANG. Again she wrote, and again he followed, and again it was a
QIANG. It was as though she were under some sort of spell. As soon as she had
finished writing one QIANG she began writing another.

QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG…

He must have watched her write several dozen QIANG’s in succession. He seemed to
be as much affected by the spell on his side of the pergola as the girl herself was on
hers, for his eyeballs continued to follow her pin long after he bad learned to
anticipate its movements.
‘This girl must have something on her mind that she cannot tell anyone about to
make her behave in this way,’ he thought. ‘One can see from her outward behaviour
how much she must be suffering inwardly. And she looks so frail. Too frail for
suffering. I wish I could bear some of it for you, my dear!’
In the stifling dog-days of summer the transition from clear to overcast is often
sudden, and a little cloudlet can some?times be the harbinger of a heavy shower. As
Bao-yu watched the girl, a sudden gust of cool wind blew by, followed, within
moments, by the hissing downpour of rain. He could see the water running off her
head in streams and soaking into her clothes.
‘Oh, it’s raining! With her delicate constitution she ought not to be outside in a
downpour like this.’
In his anxiety he cried out to her involuntarily:
‘Don’t write any more. Look! You’re getting soaked.’
The girl looked up, startled, when she heard the voice. She could see someone
amidst the roses saying ‘Don’t write’; but partly because of Bao-yu’s almost girlishly
beautiful features, and partly because she could in any case only see about half of his
face, everything above and below being hidden by flowers and foliage, she took him
for a maid; so instead of rushing from his presence as she would have done if she had
known that it was Bao-yu, she smiled up at him gratefully:
‘Thank you for reminding me. But what about you? You must be getting wet too,
surely?’
‘Aiyo!’— her words made him suddenly aware that the whole of his body was icy
cold, and when he looked down, he saw that he was soaked.
‘Oh lord!’
He rushed off in the direction of Green Delights; but all the time he was worrying
about the girl, who had nowhere where she could shelter from the rain.

*

As this was the day before the Double Fifth festival, élégante and the other little
actresses — including the one whom Bao-yu had just been watching - had already
started their holiday and had gone into the Garden to amuse themselves. Two of
them, Trésor — one of the two members of the company who played Principal Boy
parts — and Topaze — one of the company’s two soubrettes — happened to be in
the House of Green Delights playing with Aroma when the rain started and prevented
their leaving. They and the maids amused themselves by blocking up the gutters and
letting the water collect in the courtyard. When it was nicely flooded, they rounded
up a number of mallards, sheldrakes, mandarin ducks and other waterfowl, tied their
wings together, and having first closed the courtyard gate, set them down in the
water to swim about. Aroma and the girls were all in the outside gallery enjoying this
spectacle when Bao-yu arrived at the gate. Finding it shut, he knocked on it for
someone to come and open up for him. But there was little chance of a knock being
heard above the excited laughter of the maids. He had to shout for some minutes
and pound the gate till it shook before anyone heard him inside.
Aroma was not expecting him back so soon.
‘I wonder who it can be at this time,’ she said. ‘Won’t someone go and answer it?’
‘It’s me!’ shouted Bao-yu.
‘That’s Miss Bao’s voice,’ said Musk.
‘Nonsense!’ said Skybright. ‘What would she be doing visiting us at this time of
day?’
‘Let me just take a peep through the crack,’ said Aroma. ‘If I think it’s all right, I’ll let
them in. We don’t want to turn anyone away in the pouring rain.’
Keeping under cover of the gallery, she made her way round to the gate and peered
through the chink between the double doors. The sight of Bao-yu standing there like
a bedraggled hen with the water running off him in streamlets was both alarming
and —she could not help but feel very funny. She opened the gate as quickly as she
could, then, when she saw him fully, clapped her hands and doubled up with
laughter.
‘Master Bao! I never thought it would be you. What did you want to come running
back in the pouring rain for?’
Bao-yu was by now in a thoroughly evil temper and had fully resolved to give
whoever opened the gate a few kicks. As soon as it was open, therefore, he lashed
out with his foot, not bothering to see who it was — for he assumed that the per?son
answering it would be one of the younger maids — and dealt Aroma a mighty kick in
the ribs that caused her to cry out in pain.
‘Worthless lot!’ he shouted. Because I always treat you decently, you think you can
get away with anything. I’m just your laughing-stock.’
It was not until he looked down and saw Aroma crying that he realized he had kicked
the wrong person.
‘Aiyo! It’s you! Where did I kick you?’
Up to this moment Aroma had never had so much as a harsh word from Bao-yu, and
the combination of shame, anger and pain she now felt on being kicked and shouted
at by him in front of so many people was well-nigh insupport?able. Nevertheless she
forced herself to bear it, reflecting that to have made an outcry would be like
admitting that it was her he had meant to kick, which she knew was almost certainly
not the case.
‘You didn’t; you missed me,’ she said. ‘Come in and get changed.’
When Bao-yu had gone indoors and was changing his clothes, he said to her jokingly:
‘In all these years this is the first time I’ve ever struck any?one in anger. Too bad
that yon should have been the one to get in the way of the blow!’
In spite of the pain, which it cost her some effort to master, Aroma was helping him
with his changing. She smiled when he said this.
‘I’m the person you always begin things with,’ she said. ‘Whether it’s big things or
little things or pleasant ones or unpleasant ones, it’s only natural that you should try
them out first on me. Only in this instance I hope that now you’ve hit me you won’t
from now on go around hitting other people.’
‘I didn’t mean to kick you, you know,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Who said you did?’ said Aroma. ‘It’s the younger ones who normally see to the
gate; and they’ve grown so insolent nowadays, it’s enough to put anyone in a rage. If
you’d given one of them a few kicks and put the fear of God into them, it would have
been a very good thing. No, it was my own silly fault. I should have made them open
the gate and not gone to open it myself.’
While they were speaking, the rain had stopped and Tresor and Topaze had left. The
pain in Aroma’s side was such that it was giving her a feeling of nausea and she could
eat no din?ner. At bedtime, when she took off her clothes, she saw a great black
bruise the size of a rice-bowl spreading over the side of her chest. The extent of it
frightened her, but she for?bore to cry out, Nevertheless even her dreams that night
were full of pain and she several times uttered an ‘Aiyo’ in the midst of her sleep.
Although it was understood that he had not kicked her deliberately, Bao-yu had felt a
little uneasy when he saw how sluggish Aroma seemed in her movements; and when,
during the night, he heard her groaning in her sleep, he knew that he must have
kicked her really hard. Getting out of bed, he picked up a lamp and tiptoed over to
have a look. Just as he reached the foot of her bed, he heard her cough a couple of
times and spit out a mouthful of something.
‘Aiyo!’
She opened her eyes wide and saw Bao-yu. Startled, she asked him what he was
doing there.
‘You’ve been groaning in your sleep,’ he said. ‘I must have hurt you badly. Let me
have a look.’
‘My head feels giddy,’ said Aroma, ‘and I’ve got a sweet, sickly taste in my throat.
Have a look on the floor.’
Bao-yu shone his lamp on the floor. Beside the bed, where she had spat, there was a
mouthful of bright red blood. He was horrified.
‘Oh, help!’
Aroma looked too, and felt the grip of fear on her heart.
The outcome will be told in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 31

A torn fan is the price of silver laughter
And a lost kylin is the clue to a happy marriage

A cold feat came over Aroma when she saw the fresh blood on the floor. She had
often heard people say that if you spat blood when you were young, you would die
early, or at the very least be an invalid all your life; and remembering this now, she
felt all her bright, ambitious hopes for the future turn into dust and ashes. Tears of
misery ran down her cheeks. The sight of them made Bao-yu, too, distressed.
‘What is it?’ he asked her.
‘It’s nothing.’ She forced herself to smile. ‘I’m all right.’
Bao-yu was all for calling one of the maids and getting her to heat some rice wine, so
that Aroma could be given hot wine and Hainan kid’s-blood pills; but Aroma, smiling
through her tears, caught at his hand to restrain him.
‘It’s all right for you to make a fuss,’ she said; ‘but if you go involving the others,
they are sure to accuse me of putting on airs. And besides, it will do neither of us any
good to draw attention to ourselves — especially when so far no one seems to have
noticed anything. The sensible thing would be for you to send one of the boys round
tomorrow to Dr Wang’s and get me some medicine to take. I shall probably be all
right again after a few doses, without a single soul knowing anything about it. Surely
that’s best, isn’t it?’
Bao-yu knew that she was right and abandoned his inten?tion of rousing the others.
Instead he poured her a cup of tea from a pot on the table and gave it to her to rinse
her mouth with. Aroma was uneasy about being waited on by her master; but fearing
that if she refused his services he would insist on disturbing everybody, she lay back
and allowed him to fuss over her.
As soon as it was daylight, Bao-yu threw on his clothes and, without even waiting to
wash or comb, went out of the Gar?den to his study in the front part of the mansion,
whither he summoned the doctor Wang Ji-ren for detailed questioning. When this
worthy had elicited the information that the hae?morrhage inquired about had been
caused by a blow, he seemed less disposed to take a serious view of the case, merely
naming some pills and giving perfunctory instructions for taking them internally and
for applying them in solution as a poultice. Bao-yu made a note of these instructions
and went back into the Garden to carry them out.
But that is no part of our story.

*

It was now the festival of the Double Fifth. Sprays of calamus and artemisia crowned
the doorways and everyone wore tiger amulets fastened on their clothing at the back.
At noon Lady Wang gave a little party at which Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were the
guests.

Bao-yu, finding Bao-chai somewhat glacial in her manner and evidently unwilling to
talk to him, knew that it must be because of his rudeness to her of the day before.
Lady Wang, observing Bao-yu’s dejected appearance, attri?buted it to
embarrassment about yesterday’s episode with Golden and ignored him even more
pointedly than Bao-chai.
Dai-yu, seeing how morose Bao-yu looked assumed that it was because Bao-chai was
offended with him and, feeling resent?ful that he should care, at once became as
morose as he was.
Xi-feng, having been told all about Bao-yu and Golden the night before by Lady Wang,
could scarcely be her usual laughing and joking self when she knew of her aunt’s
displeasure and, taking her cue from the latter, was if anything even more glacial
than the others.
And Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun, seeing everyone else so uncomfortable, soon
began to feel just as uncomfort?able themselves.
The result was that after sitting for only a very short time, the party broke up.
Dai-yu had a natural aversion to gatherings, which she rationalized by saying that
since the inevitable consequence of getting together was parting, and since parting
made people feel lonely and feeling lonely made them unhappy, ergo it was better
for them not to get together in the first place. In the same way she argued that since
the flowers, which give us so much pleasure when they open, only cause us a lot of
extra sadness when they die, it would be better if they didn’t come out at all.
Bao-yu was just the opposite. He always wanted the party to go on for ever and
flowers to be in perpetual bloom; and when at last the party did end and the flowers
did wither well, it was infinitely sad and distressing, but it couldn’t be helped.
And so today, while everyone else left the party with feel?ings of gloom, Dai-yu alone
was completely unaffected. Bao-?yu, on the other hand, returned to his room in a
mood of black despondency, sighing and muttering as he went.
Unfortunately it was the sharp-tongued Skybright who came forward to help him
change his clothes. With provok?ing carelessness she dropped a fan while she was
doing so and snapped the bone fan-sticks by accidentally treading on it.
‘Clumsy!’ said Bao-yu reproachfully. ‘You won’t be so careless with things when you
have a household of your own.’
Skybright gave a sardonic sniff.
‘You’re getting quite a temper lately, Master Bao. Almost every time we move
nowadays we get a nasty look from you. Yesterday even Aroma caught it. Today
you’re finding fault with me, so I suppose I can expect a few kicks too. Well, kick away.
But I must say, I shouldn’t have thought treading on a fan was such a very terrible
thing to do. In the past any num?ber of glass bowls and agate cups have got broken
without your turning a hair. Why this fuss about a fan, then? If you’re not satisfied
with my service, you ought to dismiss me and get someone better. Easy come, easy
go. No need for beating about the bush.’
By the time she had finished, Bao-yu was so angry that he was shaking all over.
‘You’ll go soon enough, don’t you worry!’ he said.
Aroma had heard all this from the adjoining room and now came hurrying in.
‘Now what’s all this about?’ she said, addressing herself to Bao-yu. ‘Didn’t I tell you?
As soon as I turn my back there’s trouble.’
‘If you knew that already,’ said Skybright, ‘it’s a pity you couldn’t have come in a bit
sooner and saved me from provok?ing him. Of course, we all know that you’re the
only one who knows how to serve him properly. None of the rest of us knows how
it’s done. I suppose it’s because you serve him so well that he gave you a kick in the
ribs yesterday. Heaven knows what he’s got in store for me for having served him so
badly!’
Angry, and at the same time ashamed, Aroma was about to retort; but the sight of
Bao-yu’s face, now white with anger, made her restrain herself.
‘Be a good girl - just go away and play for a bit. It’s we who are in the wrong.’
Skybright naturally assumed that ‘we’ meant Aroma and Bao-yu. Her jealousy was
further inflamed.
‘What do you mean, “we”?’ she said, ‘You two make me feel ashamed for you, you
really do — because you needn’t think you deceive me. I know what goes on
between you when you think no one is looking. But when all’s said and done, in
actual fact, when you come down to it, you’re not even a “Miss” by rights. By rights
you’re no better than any of the rest of us. I don’t know where you get this “we”
from.’
Aroma blushed and blushed with shame, until her face had become a dusky red
colour. Too late she realized her slip. By ‘we’ she had meant no more than ‘you and I’;
not ‘Bao-yu and I’ as Skybright imagined. But the pronoun had invited
misunderstanding.
It was Bao-yu who retorted, however.
‘I’ll make her a “Miss” then; I’ll make her my chamber-?wife tomorrow, if that’s all
that’s worrying you. You can spare your jealousy on that account.’
Aroma seized his hand impulsively.
‘Don’t argue with her, she’s only a silly girl. In any case, you’ve put up with much
worse than this in the past; why be so touchy today?’
Skybright gave a harsh little laugh.
‘Oh, yes. I’m too stupid to talk to. I’m only a slave.’
‘Are you arguing with me, Miss, or with Master Bao?’ said Aroma. ‘If it’s me you’ve
got it in for, you’d better address your remarks to me elsewhere. There’s no cause to
go quarrel?ling with me in front of Master Bao. But if it’s Master Bao you want to
quarrel with, then at least you might do it a bit more quietly and not let everyone
else know about it. When I came in just now, it was for everyone’s sake, so that we
could have a bit of peace and quiet. I don’t know why you had to turn on me and
start picking on my shortcomings. It seems as if you can’t make up your mind
whether you’re angry with me or with Master Bao. Slipping in a dig here and a dig
there. I don’t know what you think you’re up to. Anyway, I shan’t say any more; I’ll
just leave you here to get on with it.’
She walked out.
‘There’s no need for you to be so angry,’ Bao-yu said to Skybright. ‘I can guess what
it is that’s bothering you. I shall go and tell Her Ladyship that you’re old enough to
leave us now and ask her to send you away. That’s what you really want, isn’t it?’


‘I don’t want to go away. Why should I want to go away?’ said Skybright with tears
in her eyes now more upset than ever, ‘You’re inventing this as a means of getting rid
of me, aren’t you, because I’m in your way? But you won’t get away with it.’
‘Look, I’ve never had to put up with scenes like this before,’ said Bao-yu. ‘What
other reason can there be but that you want to leave? I really think I had better go
and see Her Ladyship about this.’
He got up and began to go; but Aroma came in again and barred his way.
‘Where are you off to?’ she asked him smilingly.
‘To see Her Ladyship.’
‘Oh, that’s silly,’ said Aroma. ‘I wonder you’re not ashamed to. Even if Skybright
really does want to leave, there will be plenty of time to tell Her Ladyship about it
when everyone has cooled down a bit and you are feeling calm and collected. If you
go rushing off in your present state, Her Ladyship will suspect something.’
‘Her Ladyship won’t suspect anything,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shall tell her quite openly that
Skybright has been agitating to leave.’
‘When have I ever agitated to leave?’ said Skybright, weeping now in earnest. ‘Even
if you’re angry with me, you ought not to twist things round in order to get the better
of me. But you go and tell her! I don’t care if I have to beat my own brains out, I’m
not going out of that door.’
‘Now that’s really strange,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t want to go, yet at the same time
you won’t keep quiet. It’s no good; I really can’t stand this quarrelling. I shall really
have to see Her Ladyship about this and get it over with.’
This time he seemed quite determined to go.
Seeing that she was unable to hold him back, Aroma went down on her knees.
Emerald, Ripple, Musk and the other maids, aware that a quarrel of more than usual
magnitude was going on inside, were waiting together outside in breathless silence.
When word reached them that Aroma was now on her knees interceding for
Skybright, they came silently troop?ing in to kneel down behind her. Bao-yu raised
Aroma to her feet, sighed, sat down on the edge of the bed, and told the other maids
to get up.
‘What do you want me to do?’ be asked Aroma. ‘My heart is destroyed inside me,
but none of you knows or cares.’
Tears started from his eyes and rolled down his cheeks un?heeded. Seeing his tears,
Aroma too began to cry. Skybright, who stood crying beside them, was about to say
something; but just at that moment Dai-yu walked in and she slipped outside.
Dai-yu beamed at the weeping pair:
‘Crying on a holiday? What’s all this about? Have you been quarrelling over the
rice-cakes?’
Bao-yu and Aroma both burst out laughing.
‘Well, if Cousin Bao won’t tell me,’ she went on, ‘I’m sure that you will. Come!’ she
said, slapping Aroma familiarly on the shoulder. ‘Tell sis all about it. It’s obvious that
the two of you have been having an argument. Tell me what it’s all about and I’ll
make it up between you.’
‘Oh, Miss!’ Aroma gave her a push. ‘Don’t carry on so! I’m only a maid; you
shouldn’t say such things to me.’
‘Only a maid?’ said Dai-yu. I always think of you as my sister-in-law.’
‘Don’t you see that you’re simply encouraging people to be nasty to her?’ Bao-yu
protested. ‘Even as it is, people already gossip about her. How can she stand up to
them if you come along and lend your weight to what they are saying?’
‘You don’t know what I feel, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘If I only knew how to stop
breathing, I’d gladly die.’
Dai-yu smiled.
‘If you were to die, I don’t know about anyone else, but I know that I should die of
grief.’
‘I should become a monk,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Try to be a bit more serious,’ said Aroma. ‘You and Miss Lin are both laughing at
me.’
Dai-yu held up two fingers and looked at Bao-yu with a quizzical expression.
‘That’s twice you’re going to become a monk. From now on I’m keeping the score.’
Bao-yu recognized the allusion to what he had said to her the day before. Fortunately
he was able to pass it off with a laugh. Shortly after that, Dai-yu left them.
No sooner had Dai-yu gone than someone arrived with an invitation from Xue Pan.
Bao-yu thought that this time he had better go. It turned out to be only a
drinking-party, but Xue Pan refused to release him and kept him there until it was
over. He returned home in the evening more than a little drunk.
As he came lurching into his courtyard, he saw that some?one in quest of coolness
had taken a bed outside and was lying down on it asleep. Assuming that it must be
Aroma, he sat down on the edge of it and gave her a push.
‘Is the pain any better?’
‘Can’t you leave me alone?’ she said, rising up wrathfully. He looked again and saw
that it was not Aroma after all but Skybright. Taking her by the hand, he drew her
down on the bed beside him.
‘You’re getting so self-willed,’ he said laughingly. ‘When you trod on that fan this
morning, I only made a harmless little remark, but look how you flew up in the air
about it! And then when Aroma, out of the kindness of her heart, tried to reason
with you, look how you pitched into her! Seriously, now, don’t you think it was all a
bit uncalled-for?’
‘I’m so hot,’ said Skybright. ‘Do you have to maul me about like this? Suppose
someone were to see us? Anyway, it’s not right for me to be sitting here.’
‘If you know it’s not right to be sitting here,’ he said teasingly, ‘what were you doing
lying down?’
‘Che-e-e!’ Unable at once to reply, she gave a little laugh. Then she said:
‘When you are not here it doesn’t matter. It’s your being here that makes it wrong.
Anyway, let me get up now, because I want to have a bath. Aroma and Musk have
had theirs al?ready. I’ll send them out to you.’
‘I’ve just had rather a lot to drink and I could do with a bath myself,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As
you haven’t had yours yet, bring the water out here and we’ll have a bath together.’
Skybright laughed and declined with a vigorous gesture of her hand.
‘Oh no! I daren’t start you off on that caper. I still remember that time you got
Emerald to help you bath. You must have been two or three hours in there, so that
we began to get quite worried. We didn’t like to go in while you were there, but
when we did go in to have a look afterwards, we found water all over the floor, pools
of water round the legs of the bed, and even the mat on the bed had water splashed
all over it. Heaven only knows what you’d been up to. We laughed about it for days
afterwards. I haven’t got time to fetch that amount of water. And in any case, you
don’t want to go taking baths with me. As a matter of fact it’s cooler now, so I don’t
think I shall have a bath after all. Why don’t you let me fetch you a bowl of water so
that you can have a nice wash and comb your hair? Faithful just sent a lot of fruit
round and we’ve got it soaking in iced water in the big glass bowl. I’ll tell them to
bring some out to you, shall I?’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you’re not having a bath yourself, I’ll just wash my hands;
and you can get me some of that fruit to eat.’
Skybright smiled.
‘You’ve already told me once today how clumsy I am. I can’t even drop a fan
without treading on it. So I’m much too clumsy to get your fruit for you. Suppose I
were to break a plate. That would be terrible!’
‘If you want to break it, by all means break it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘These things are there
for our use. What we use them for is a matter of individual taste. For example, fans
are made for fanning with; but if you prefer to tear them up because it gives you
pleasure, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t. What you mustn’t do is to use them
as objects to vent your anger on. It’s the same with plates and cups. Plates and cups
are made to put food and drink in. But if you want to smash them on purpose
because you like the noise, it’s perfectly all right to do so. As long as you don’t get
into a passion and start taking it out on things — that is the golden rule.’
‘All right then,’ said Skybright with a mischievous smile. ‘Give me your fan to tear. I
love the sound of a fan being torn.’
Bao-yu held it out to her. She took it eagerly and — chah! — promptly tore it in half.
And again — chah! chah! chah!—she tore it several more times. Bao-yu, an
appreciative onlooker, laughed and encouraged her.
‘Well torn! Well torn! Now again - a really loud one!’
Just then Musk appeared. She stared at them indignantly.
‘Don’t do that!’ she said. ‘It’s wicked to waste things like that.’
But Bao-yu leaped up to her, snatched the fan from her hand, and passed it to
Skybright, who at once tore it into several pieces. The two of them, Bao-yu and
Skybright, then burst into uproarious laughter.
‘What do you think you’re doing?’ said Musk. ‘That’s my fan you’ve just ruined.’
‘What’s an old fan?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Open up the fan box and get yourself another.’
‘If that’s your attitude,’ said Musk, ‘we might as well carry out the whole boxful and
let her tear away to her heart’s con?tent.’
‘All right. Go and get it,’ said Bao-yu.
‘And be born a beggar in my next life?’ said Musk. ‘No thank you I She hasn’t
broken her arm. Let her go and get it herself.’
Skybright stretched back on the bed, smiling complacently. ‘I’m rather tired just now.
I think I shall tear some more tomorrow.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘The ancients used to say that for one smile of a beautiful woman a thousand taels
are well spent. For a few old fans it’s cheap at the price!’
He called to Aroma, who had just finished changing into clean clothes, to come
outside and join them. Little Melilot came and cleared away the broken bits of fan,
and everyone sat for a while and enjoyed the cool.
But our narrative supplies no further details of that evening.

*

About noon next day, while Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the girls were sitting in
Grandmother Jia’s room, some?one came in to announce that ‘Miss Shi’ had arrived.
Shortly afterwards Shi Xiang-yun appeared in the courtyard, attended by a bevy of
matrons and maids. Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the rest hurried out to the foot of the steps
to welcome her.
For young girls like the cousins a reunion after a mere month’s separation is an
occasion for touching demonstrations of affection. After these initial transports,
when they were all indoors and the greetings, introductions and salutations had
been completed, Grandmother Jia suggested that, as the weather was so hot,
Xiang-yun should remove her outer gar?ments. Xiang-yun rose to her feet with
alacrity and divested herself of one or two layers. Lady Wang was amused.
‘Gracious, child! What a lot you have on! I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone
wearing so much.’
‘It’s my Aunt Shi who makes me wear it all,’ said Xiang yun. ‘You wouldn’t catch me
wearing this stuff if I didn’t have to.’
‘You don’t know our Xiang-yun, Aunt,’ Bao-chai inter?posed. ‘She’s really happiest
in boy’s clothes. That time she was here in the third or fourth month last year, I
remember one day she dressed up in one of Bao-yu’s gowns and put a pair of his
boots on and one of his belts round her waist. At first glance she looked exactly like
Cousin Bao. It was only the ear-rings that gave her away. When she stood behind that
chair over there, Grandmother was completely taken in. She said, “Bao-yu, come
over here! You’ll get the dust from that hanging lamp in your eyes if you’re not
careful.” But Xiang?-yun just smiled and didn’t move. It was only when everyone
couldn’t hold it in any longer and started laughing that Grandmother realized who it
was and joined in the laugh. She told her that she made a very good-looking boy.’
‘That’s nothing,’ said Dai-yu. ‘What about that time last year when she came to stay
for a couple of days with us in the first month and it snowed? Grandma and Auntie
Wang had just got back from somewhere — I think it was from visiting the ancestors’
portraits — and she saw Grandma’s new scarlet felt rain-cape lying there and put it
on when no one was looking. Of course, it was much too big and much too long for
her, so she hitched it up and tied it round her waist with a sash and went out like that
into the back courtyard to help the maids build a snowman. And then she slipped
over in it and got covered all over with mud—’
The others all laughed at the recollection.
Bao-chai asked Xiang-yun’s nurse, Mrs Zhou, whether Xiang-yun was still as
tomboyish as ever. Nurse Zhou laughed but said nothing.
‘I don’t mind her being tomboyish,’ said Ying-chun, ‘but I do wish she wasn’t such a
chatterbox. You wouldn’t believe it — even when she’s in bed at night it still goes on.
Jabber-jabber, jabber-jabber. Then she laughs. Then she talks a bit more. Then she
laughs again. And you never heard such a lot of rubbish in your life, I don’t know
where she gets it all from.’
‘Well, perhaps she’ll have got over that by now,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I hear that
someone was round the other day to talk about a betrothal. Now that there’s a
future mother-in-law to think about, she can’t be quite as tomboyish as she used to
be.’
‘Are you staying this time, or do you have to go back to?night?’ asked Grandmother
Jia.
‘Your Old Ladyship hasn’t seen all the clothes she’s brought,’ said Nurse Zhou.
‘She’ll be staying two days here at the very least.’
‘Isn’t Bao at home?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Listen to her!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Bao is the only one she thinks about. He and
she get on well together because they are both fond of mischief. You can see she
hasn’t really changed.’
‘Perhaps now that you’re getting older you had better stop using baby-names,’ said
Grandmother Jia, reminded by the talk of betrothal that her babies were rapidly
turning into grown-ups.
Just then Bao-yu came in.
‘Ah! Hallo, Yun! Why didn’t you come when we sent for you the other day?’
‘Grandmother has just this moment been saying that it is time you all stopped
using baby-names,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I must say, this isn’t a very good beginning.’
‘Our cousin has got something nice to give you,’ said Dai?-yu to Xiang-yun.
‘Oh? What is it?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Don’t believe her,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Goodness! It’s no time since you were here last,
but you seem to have grown taller already.’
Xiang-yun laughed.
‘How’s Aroma?’
‘She’s fine. Thank you for asking.’
‘I’ve brought something for her,’ said Xiang-yun. She produced a knotted-up silk
handkerchief.
‘What treasure have you got wrapped up in there?’ said Bao-yu. ‘The best present
you could have brought Aroma would have been a couple of those cheap agate rings
like the ones you sent us the other day.’
‘What are these, then?’
With a triumphant smile she opened her little bundle and revealed four rings, each
inset with the veined red agate they had so much admired on a previous occasion.
‘What a girl!’ said Dai-yu. ‘These are exactly the same as the ones you sent us the
other day by messenger. Why didn’t you get him to bring these too and save yourself
some trouble? I thought you must have got some wonderful rarity tied up in that
handkerchief, seeing that you’d gone to all the trouble of bringing it here yourself —
and all the time it was only a few more of those! You really are rather a silly.’
‘Thilly yourthelf!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The others can decide which of us is the silly one
when I have explained my reason. If I send things for you and the girls, it’s assumed
that they are for you without the messenger even needing to say any?thing; but if I
send things for any of the maids, I have to explain very carefully to the messenger
which ones I mean. Now if the messenger is someone intelligent, that’s all right; but
if it’s someone not so bright who has difficulty in remembering names, they’ll
probably make such a mess of it that they’ll get not only the maids’ presents mixed
up, but yours as well. Then again, if the messenger is a woman, it’s not so bad; but
the other day it was one of the boys - and you know how hopeless they are over girls’
names. So you see, I thought it would be simpler if I delivered the maids’ ones myself.
There!’— she laid the rings down one after another on the table — ‘One for Aroma;
one for Faithful; one for Golden; and one for Patience. Can you imagine one of the
boys getting those four names right?’
The others laughed.
‘Clever! Clever!’ they said.
‘You’re always so eloquent,’ said Bao-yu. ‘No one else gets a chance.’
‘If she weren’t so eloquent, she wouldn’t be worthy of the gold kylin,’ said Dai-yu
huffily, rising from her seat and walk?ing off as she spoke.
Fortunately no one heard her but Ban-chai, who made a laughing grimace, and
Bao-yu, who immediately regretted having once more spoken out of turn, but who,
suddenly catching sight of Bao-chai’s expression, could not help laugh?ing himself.
Seeing him laugh, Bao-chai at once rose from her seat and hurried off to joke with
Dai-yu.
‘When you’ve finished your tea and rested a bit,’ said Grandmother Jia to Xiang-yun,
‘you can go and see your married cousins. After that, you can amuse yourself in the
Garden with the girls. It’s nice and cool there.’
Xiang-yun thanked her grandmother. She wrapped up three of the rings again, and
after sitting a little longer, went off, attended by her nannies and maids, to call on
Wang Xi-?feng. After chatting a while with her, she went into the Gar?den and called
on Li Wan. Then, after sitting a short while with Li Wan, she went off in the direction
of Green Delights in quest of Aroma. Before doing so, however, she turned to
dis?miss her escort.
‘You needn’t stay with me any longer,’ she said. ‘You can go off now and visit your
relations. I’ll just keep Fishy to wait on me.
The others thanked her and went off to look for various kith and kin, leaving
Xiang-yun alone with Kingfisher.
‘Why aren’t these water-lilies out yet?’ said Kingfisher.
‘It isn’t time for them yet,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Look, they’re going to be “double-decker” ones, like the ones in our lily-pond at
home,’ said Kingfisher.
‘Our ones are better,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘They’ve got a pomegranate-tree here which has four or five lots of flowers growing
one above the other on each branch,’ said Kingfisher. ‘That’s a
double-double-double?-decker. I wonder what makes them grow like that.’
‘Plants are the same as people,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The healthier their constitution is,
the better they grow.’
‘I don’t believe that,’ said Kingfisher with a toss of her head. ‘If that were so, why
don’t we see people walking around with one head growing on top of the other?’
Xiang-yun was unable to avoid laughing at the girl’s sim?plicity.
‘I’ve told you before, you talk too much,’ she said. ‘Let’s see: how can one answer a
question like that? Everything in the world is moulded by the forces of Yin and Yang.
That means that, besides the normal, the abnormal, the peculiar, the freakish — in
fact all the thousands and thousands of different variations we find in things — are
caused by different combina?tions of Yin and Yang. Even if something appears that is
so rare that no one has ever seen it before, the principle is still the same.’
‘So according to what you say,’ said Kingfisher, ‘all the things that have ever existed,
from the time the world began right up to the present moment, have just been a lot
of Yins and Yangs.’
‘No, stupid!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘The more you say, the sil?lier you get. “Just a lot of
Yins and Yangs” indeed! In any case, strictly speaking Yin and Yang are not two things
but one and the same thing. By the time the Yang has become exhausted, it is Yin;
and by the time the Yin has become exhausted, it is Yang. It isn’t a case of one of
them coming to an end and then the other one growing out of nothing.’
‘That’s too deep for me,’ said Kingfisher. ‘What sort of thing is a Yin-yang, I’d like to
know? No one’s ever seen one. You just answer that, Miss. What does a Yin-yang look
like?’
‘Yin-yang is a sort of force,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It’s the force in things that gives them
their distinctive forms. For example, the sky is Yang and the earth is Yin; water is Yin
and fire is Yang; the sun is Yang and the moon is Yin.’
‘Ah yes! Now I understand,’ said Kingfisher happily. ‘That’s why astrologers call the
sun the “Yang star” and the moon the “Yin star”.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘She understands.’
‘That’s not so difficult,’ said Kingfisher. ‘But what about things like mosquitoes and
fleas and midges and plants and flowers and bricks and tiles? Surely you are not
going to say that they are all Yin-yang too?’
‘Certainly they are!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Take the leaf of a tree, for example. That’s
divided into Yin and Yang. The side facing upwards towards the sky is Yang; the
underside, facing towards the ground, is Yin.’
Kingfisher nodded.
‘I see. Yes. I can understand that. But take these fans we are holding. Surely they
don’t have Yin and Yang?’
‘Yes they do. The front of the fan is Yang; the back of the fan is Yin.’
Kingfisher nodded, satisfied. She tried to think of some other object to ask about, but
being for the moment unable to, she began looking around her for inspiration. As she
did so, her eye chanced to light on the gold kylin fastened in the intricate loopings of
her mistress’s girdle.
‘Well, Miss,’ she said, pointing triumphantly to the kylin, you’re not going to say
that that’s got Yin and Yang?
‘Certainly. In the case of birds and beasts the males are Yang and the females are
Yin.’
‘Is this a daddy one or a mummy one?’ said Kingfisher.
‘“A daddy one or a mummy one”! Silly girl!’
‘All right, then,’ said Kingfisher. ‘But why is it that everything else has Yin and Yang
but we haven’t?’
‘Get along with you, naughty girl! What subject will you get on to next?’
‘Why? Why can’t you tell me?’ said Kingfisher. ‘Anyway, I know; so there’s no need
for you to be so nasty to me.’
Xiang-yun suppressed a giggle.
‘You’re Yang and I’m Yin,’ said Kingfisher.
Xiang-yun held her handkerchief to her mouth and laughed ‘Well, that’s right, isn’t
it?’ said Kingfisher. ‘What are you laughing at?’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘That’s quite right.’
‘That’s what they always say,’ said Kingfisher: ‘the master is Yang and the servant is
Yin. Even I can understand that principle.’
‘I’m sure you can,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Very good.’
While they were talking, a glittering golden object at the foot of the rose pergola
caught Xiang-yun’s eye. She pointed it out to Kingfisher.
‘Go and see what it is,’
Kingfisher bounded over and picked it up.
‘Ah ha!’ she said, examining the object in her hand. ‘Now we shall be able to see
whether it’s Yin or Yang.’
She took hold of the kylin fastened to Xiang-yun’s girdle and held it up to look at it
more closely. Xiang-yun wanted to see what it was that she held in her hand, but
Kingfisher wouldn’t let her.
‘It’s my treasure,’ she said with a laugh. ‘I won’t let you see it, Miss. Funny, though.
I wonder where it came from. I’ve never seen anyone here wearing it.’
‘Come on! Let me look,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘There you are, Miss!’ Kingfisher opened her hand.
Xiang-yun looked. It was a beautiful, shining gold kylin, both larger and more ornate
than the one she was wearing. Reach?ing out and taking it from Kingfisher, she held
it on the palm of her hand and contemplated it for some moments in silence.
Whatever reverie the contemplation inspired was broken by the sudden arrival of
Bao-yu.
‘What are you doing, standing out here in the blazing sun?’ he asked her. ‘Why
don’t you go and see Aroma?’
‘We were on our way,’ said Xiang-yun, hurriedly conceal?ing the gold kylin.
The three of them entered the courtyard of Green Delights together.
Aroma had gone outside to take the air and was leaning on the verandah railings at
the foot of the front door steps. As soon as she caught sight of Xiang-yun, she hurried
down into the courtyard to welcome her, and taking her by the hand, led her into the
house, animatedly exchanging news with her as they went.
‘You should have come sooner,’ said Bao-yu when they were indoors and Aroma
had made Xiang-yun take a seat. ‘I’ve got something nice for you here and I’ve been
waiting for you to come so that I could give it to you.’
He had been hunting through his pockets as he said this. Not finding what he was
searching for, he exclaimed in sur?prise.
‘Aiyo!’ He turned to Aroma. ‘Have you put it away some?where?’
‘Put what away?’
‘That little kylin I got the other day.’
‘You’ve been carrying it around with you everywhere,’ said Aroma. ‘Why ask me
about it?’
Bao-yu clapped his hands together in vexation.
‘Oh, I’ve lost it! Wherever am I going to look for it?’
He got up to begin searching.
Xiang-yun now realized that it must have been Bao-yu who dropped the kylin she had
only a few minutes earlier dis?covered outside.
‘Since when have you had a kylin?’ she asked him. ‘Oh, several days now,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘What a shame! I’ll never get another one like that. And the trouble is, I don’t
know when I can have lost it. Oh dear! How stupid of me!’
‘It’s only an ornament you’re getting so upset about,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What a good
job it wasn’t something more serious!’
She opened her hand:
‘Look! Is that it?’
Bao-yu looked and saw, with extravagant delight, that it was.
The remainder of this episode will be told in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 32
Bao-yu demonstrates confusion of mind by making his
declaration to the wrong person
And Golden shows an unconquerable spirit by ending her
humiliation in death

OUR last chapter told of Bao-yu’s delight at seeing the gold kylin again. He reached
out eagerly and took it from Xiang-?yun’s hand.
‘Fancy your finding it!’ he said. ‘How did you come to pick it up?’
‘It’s a good job it was only this you lost,’ she said. ‘One of these days it will be your
seal of office — and then it won’t be quite so funny.’
‘Oh, losing one’s seal of office is nothing,’ said Bao-yu. Losing a thing like this is
much more serious.’
Aroma meanwhile was pouring tea.
‘I heard your good news the other day,’ she said, handing Xiang-yun a cup.
‘Congratulations!’
Xiang-yun bent low over the cup to hide her blushes and made no reply.
‘Why so bashful, Miss?’ said Aroma. ‘Have you forgotten the things you used to tell
me at night all those years ago, when we used to sleep together in the little
closet-bed at Her Old Ladyship’s? You weren’t very bashful then. What makes you so
bashful with me now, all of a sudden?’
Xiang-yun’s face became even redder. She gave a forced little laugh.
‘Who’s talking? That was a time when you and I were very close to each other.
Then I had to go back home when my uncle’s first wife died and you were given
Cousin Bao to look after, and I don’t know why, but whenever I came back here after
that, you seemed somehow changed towards me.’
It was now Aroma’s turn to blush and protest.
‘When you first came to live here it was “Pearl dear this” and “Pearl dear that” all
the time. You were always coaxing me to do things for you — do your hair, wash your
face, or I don’t know what. But now that’s all changed. Now you’re the young lady,
aren’t you? You can’t act the young lady with me and expect me to stay on the same
familiar terms as before.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Xiang-yun, now genuinely indignant. ‘That’s tho unfair. I wish I
may die if I ever “acted the young lady” with you, as you put it. I come here in this
frightful heat, and the very first person I want to see when I get here is you. Ask Fishy
if you don’t believe me. She can tell you. At home I’m always going on about you.’
Aroma and Bao-yu both laughed.
‘Don’t take it to heart so, it was only a joke. You shouldn’t be so excitable.’
‘Don’t, whatever you do, admit that what you said was wounding,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Say I’m “excitable” and put me in the wrong!’
While she said this, she was undoing the knotted silk hand-kerchief and extracting
one of the three rings from it. She handed it to Aroma. Aroma was greatly touched.
‘I’ve got one like this already,’ she said. ‘It was given to me when you sent those
ones the other day to the young ladies. But fancy your bringing this one here
specially! Now I know you haven’t forgotten me. It’s little things like this that show
you what a person really is. The ring itself isn’t worth much, I know. It’s the thought
behind it.’
‘Who gave you the one you’ve already got?’ said Xiang-?yun.
‘Miss Bao,’ said Aroma.
‘Ah,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘Miss Bao. And I was thinking it must have been Miss Lin.
Often when I’m at home I think to myself that of all my cousins Bao-chai is the one I
like best. It’s a pity we couldn’t have been born of the same mother. With her for an
elder sister it wouldn’t matter so much being an orphan.’
Her eyelids reddened as she said this and she seemed to be on the verge of tears.
‘Now, now, now!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t say things like that.’
‘And why not?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Oh, I know your trouble. You’re afraid that Cousin
Lin might hear and get angry with me again for praising Cousin Bao. That’s what’s
worrying you, isn’t it?’
Aroma giggled.
‘Oh Miss Yun! You’re just as outspoken as you used to be.’
‘Well, I’ve said that you lot are difficult to talk to,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and I was certainly
right!’
‘Don’t make me sick,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘You say what you like to us. It’s with your
Cousin Lin that you have to be so careful.’
‘Never mind about that,’ said Aroma. ‘Joking apart, now: I want to ask you a favour.’
‘What is it?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘I’ve got a pair of slipper-tops here that I’ve already cut the openwork pattern in,
but as I haven’t been very well this last day or two, I haven’t been able to sew them
on to the backing material. Do you think you’d have time to do them for me?’
‘That’s rather a strange request,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Quite apart from all the clever
maids this household employs you have your own full-time tailors and embroiderers.
Why ask me to do your sewing? You could give it to anyone here you liked. They
could hardly refuse you.’
‘You can’t be serious,’ said Aroma. ‘None of the sewing in this room is allowed to go
outside. Surely you knew that?’
Xiang-yun inferred from this that the slippers in question were for Bao-yu.
‘Oh well,’ she said, ‘in that case I suppose I’d better do them for you. On one
condition, though: I’ll do them if they are for you to wear, but if they are for anyone
else, I’m afraid I can’t.’
‘Get along with you!’ said Aroma. ‘Ask you to make slippers for me? I wouldn’t have
the nerve. No, I’ll be honest with you, they’re not for me. Never mind who they’re for.
Just tell yourself that I’m the one you’ll be doing the favour.’
‘It isn’t that,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘In the past I’ve done lots of things for you. Surely you
must know what makes me un?willing now?’
‘I’m sorry, I don’t,’ said Aroma.
‘What about the person who got in a temper the other day when that fan-case I
made for you was compared with hers and cut it up with a pair of scissors? I heard all
about that, so don’t start protesting. If you expect me to do sewing for you after that,
you’re just treating me as your drudge.’
‘I didn’t know at the time it was you who made it,’ Bao-yu put in hurriedly.
‘He really didn’t,’ said Aroma. ‘I pretended there was some?one outside we’d just
discovered who could do very fine and original needlework. I told him I’d got them to
do that fan?-case for him as a sample. He believed what I said and went around
showing it to everyone. Unfortunately while he was doing this he upset you know
who and she took a pair of scissors and cut it in pieces. Afterwards he was very
anxious to have some more work done by the same person, so I had to tell him who
it really was. He was very upset when he heard that it was you.’
‘I still think this is a very strange request,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘If Miss Lin can cut things
up, she can sew them for him, too. Why not ask her to do them for you?’
‘Oh, she wouldn’t want to do them,’ said Aroma. ‘And even if she did, Her Old
Ladyship wouldn’t let her, for fear of her tiring herself. The doctors say she needs rest
and quiet. I wouldn’t want to trouble her with them. Last year she took practically
the whole year embroidering one little purse, and this last six months I don’t think
she’s picked up a needle.’
Their conversation was interrupted by a servant with a message:
‘Mr Jia of Rich Street is here. The Master says will Master Bao receive him, please?’
Recognizing the ‘Mr Jia’ of the message as Jia Yu-cun, Bao-yu was more than a little
vexed. While Aroma hurried off for his going-out clothes, he sat pulling his boots on
and grumbling.
‘He’s got Father to talk to, surely that’s enough for him? Why does he always have
to see me?’
Xiang-yun laughed at his disgruntlement:
‘I’m sure you’re very good at entertaining people,’ she said. ‘That’s why Sir Zheng
asks you to see him.’
‘That message didn’t come from Father,’ said Bao-yu. ‘He’ll have made it up
himself.’
‘“When the host is refined, the callers are frequent,”’ said Xiang-yun. ‘There must
be something about you that has impressed him, otherwise he wouldn’t want to see
you.’
‘I make no claim to being refined, thanks all the same,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m as common
as dirt. And furthermore I have no wish to mix with people of his sort.’
‘You’re incorrigible,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Now that you’re older, you ought to be mixing
with these officials and ad?ministrators as much as you can. Even if you don’t want to
take the Civil Service examinations and become an adminis?trator yourself, you can
learn a lot from talking to these people about the way the Empire is governed and
the people who govern it that will stand you in good stead later on, when you come
to manage your own affairs and take your place in society. You might even pick up
one or two decent, respect?able friends that way. You’ll certainly never get anywhere
if you spend all your time with us girls.’
Bao-yu found such talk highly displeasing.
‘I think perhaps you’d better go and sit in someone else’s room,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t
want a decent, respectable young lady like you to get contaminated.’
‘Don’t try reasoning with him, Miss,’ Aroma put in hur?riedly. ‘Last time Miss Bao
tried it, he was just as rude to her. No consideration for her feelings whatever. He just
said “Hai!”, picked up his heels, and walked out of the room, leaving her still half-way
through her sentence. Poor Miss Bao! She was so embarrassed she turned bright red.
She didn’t know what to say. A good job it was her, though, and not Miss Lin. If it had
been Miss Lin, there’d have been weeping and carrying on and I don’t know what. I
really admire the way Miss Bao behaved on that occasion. She just stood there a
while collecting herself and then walked quietly out of the room. Myself, I was quite
upset, thinking she must be offended. But not a bit of it. Next time she came round,
it was just as if nothing had happened. A real little lady, Miss Bao — and
generous-hearted, too. And yet the funny thing is that his lordship seems to have
fallen out with her, whereas Miss Lin, who is always getting on her high horse and
ignoring him, has him running round and apologizing to her all the time.’
‘Have you ever heard Miss Lin talking that sort of stupid rubbish?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’d
long since have fallen out with her if she did.’
Aroma and Xiang-yun shook their heads pityingly.
‘So that’s “stupid rubbish”, is it?’ they said, laughing.

*

Dai-yu rightly surmised that now Xiang-yun had arrived, Bao-yu would lose no time in
telling her about his newly? acquired kylin.
Now Dai-yu had observed that in the romances which Bao-yu smuggled in to her and
of which she was nowadays an avid consumer, it was always some trinket or small
object of clothing or jewellery a pair of lovebirds, a male and female phoenix, a jade
ring, a gold buckle, a silken handker?chief, an embroidered belt or what not — that
brought the heroes and heroines together. And since the fate and future happiness of
those fortunate beings seemed to depend wholly on the instrumentality of such
trifling objects, it was natural for her to suppose that Bao-yu’s acquisition of the gold
kylin would become the occasion of a dramatic rupture with her and the beginning of
an association with Xiang-yun in which he and Xiang-yun would do together all those
delightful things that she had read about in the romances.
It was with such apprehensions that she made her way stealthily towards Green
Delights, her intention being to observe how the two of them were behaving and
shape her own actions accordingly. Imagine her surprise when, just as she was about
to enter, she heard Xiang-yun lecturing Bao-yu on his social obligations and Bao-yu
telling Xiang-yun that ‘Cousin Lin never talked that sort of rubbish’ and that if she did
he would have ‘fallen out with her long ago’. Mingled emotions of happiness, alarm,
sorrow and regret assailed her.
Happiness:
Because after all (she thought) I wasn’t mistaken in my judgement of you. I always
thought of you as a true friend, and I was right.
Alarm:
Because if you praise me so unreservedly in front of other people, your warmth and
affection are sure, sooner or later, to excite suspicion and be misunderstood.
Regret:
Because if you are my true friend, then I am yours and the two of us are a perfect
match. But in that case why did there have to be all this talk of ‘the gold and the jade’?
Alternatively, if there had to be all this talk of gold and jade, why weren’t we the two
to have them? Why did there have to be a Bao-chai with her golden locket?
Sorrow:
Because though there are things of burning importance to be said, without a father
or a mother I have no one to say them for me. And besides, I feel so muzzy lately and
I know that my illness is gradually gaining a hold on me. (The doctors say that the
weakness and anaemia I suffer from may be the beginnings of a consumption.) So
even if I am your true love, I fear I may not be able to wait for you. And even though
you are mine, you can do nothing to alter my fate.
At that point in her reflections she began to weep; and feel?ing in no fit state to be
seen, she turned away from the door and began to make her way back again.
Bao-yu had finished his hasty dressing and now came out of the house. He saw
Dai-yu slowly walking on ahead of him and, judging by her appearance from behind,
wiping her eyes. He hurried forward to catch up with her.
‘Where are you off to, coz? Are you crying again? Who has upset you this time?’
Dai-yu turned and saw that it was Bao-yu.
‘I’m perfectly all right,’ she said, forcing a smile. ‘What would I be crying for?’
‘Look at you! The tears are still wet on your face. How can you tell such fibs?’
Impulsively he stretched out his hand to wipe them. Dai-yu recoiled several paces:
‘You’ll get your head chopped off!’ she said. ‘You really must keep your hands to
yourself.’
‘I’m sorry. My feelings got the better of me. I’m afraid I wasn’t thinking about my
head.’
‘No, I forgot,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Losing your head is nothing, is it? It’s losing your
kylin—the famous gold kylin - that is really serious!’
Her words immediately put Bao-yu in a passion. He came up to her and held his face
close to hers.
‘Do you say these things to put a curse on me? or is it merely to make me angry
that you say them ?’
Remembering their recent quarrel, Dai-yu regretted her careless reintroduction of its
theme and hastened to make amends:
‘Now don’t get excited. I shouldn’t have said that - oh come now, it really isn’t that
important! Look at you! The veins are standing out on your forehead and your face is
all covered with sweat.’
She moved forward and wiped the perspiration from his brow. For some moments he
stood there motionless, staring at her. Then he said:
‘Don’t worry!’
Hearing this, Dai-yu herself was silent for some moments.
‘Why should I worry?’ she said eventually. ‘I don’t under?stand you. Would you
mind telling me what you are talking about?’
Bao-yu sighed.
‘Do you really not understand? Can I really have been all this time mistaken in my
feelings towards you? If you don’t even know your own mind, it’s small wonder that
you’re always getting angry on my account.’
‘I really don’t understand what you mean about not worry?ing,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-yu sighed again and shook his head.
‘My dear coz, don’t think you can fool me. If you don’t understand what I’ve just
said, then not only have feelings towards you been all along mistaken, but all that
yon have ever felt for me has been wasted, too. It’s because you worry so much that
you’ve made yourself ill. If only you could take things a bit easier, your illness
wouldn’t go on getting more and more serious all the time.’
Dai-yu was thunderstruck. He had read her mind - had seen inside her more clearly
than if she had plucked out her entrails and held them out for his inspection. And
now there were a thousand things that she wanted to tell him; yet though she was
dying to speak, she was unable to utter a single syllable and stood there like a
simpleton, gazing at him in silence.
Bao-yu, too, had a thousand things to say, but he, too, stood mutely gazing at her, not
knowing where to begin.
After the two of them had stared at each other for some considerable time in silence,
Dai-yu heaved a deep sigh. The tears gushed from her eyes and she turned and
walked away. Bao-yu hurried after her and caught at her dress.
‘Coz dear, stop a moment! Just let me say one word.’
As she wiped her eyes with one hand, Dai-yu pushed him away from her with the
other.
‘There’s nothing to say. I already know what you want to tell me.’
She said this without turning back her head, and having said it, passed swiftly on her
way. Bao-yu remained where he was standing, gazing after her in silent stupefaction.
Now Bao-yu had left the apartment in such haste that he had forgotten to take his
fan with him. Fearing that he would be very hot without it, Aroma hurried outside to
give it to him, but when she noticed him standing some way ahead of her talking to
Dai-yu, she halted. After a little while she saw Dai-yu walk away and Bao-yu continue
standing motionless where he was. She chose this moment to go up and speak to
him.
‘You’ve gone out without your fan,’ she said. ‘It’s a good job I noticed. Here you are.
I ran out to give it to you.’
Bao-yu, still in a muse, saw Aroma there talking to him, yet without clearly perceiving
who it was. With the same glazed look in his eyes, he began to speak.
‘Dearest coz! I’ve never before dared to tell you what I felt for you. Now at last I’m
going to pluck -up courage and tell you, and after that I don’t care what becomes of
me. Because of you I, too, have made myself ill — only I haven’t dared tell anyone
about it and have had to bear it all in silence. And the day that your illness is cured, I
do believe that mine, too, will get better. Night and day, coz, sleeping and dreaming,
you are never out of my mind.’
Aroma listened to this declaration aghast.
‘Holy saints preserve us!’ she exclaimed. ‘He’ll be the death of me.’
She gave him a shake.
‘What are you talking about? Are you bewitched? You’d better hurry.’
Bao-yu seemed suddenly to waken from his trance and recognized the person he had
been speaking to as Aroma. His face turned a deep red with embarrassment and he
snatched the fan from her and fled.

*

After he had gone, Aroma began thinking about the words he had just said and
realized that they must have been intended for Dai-yu. She reflected with some
alarm that if things be?tween them were as his words seemed to indicate, there was
every likelihood of an ugly scandal developing, and wondered how she could arrange
matters to prevent it. Preoccupied with these reflections, she stood as motionless
and unseeing as her master had done a few moments before. Bao-chai found her in
this state on her way back from the house.
‘What are you brooding on, out in the burning sun?’ she asked her, laughing.
Aroma laughed back.
‘There were two little sparrows here having a fight. They were so funny, I had to
stand and watch them.’
‘Where was Cousin Bao rushing off to just now, all dressed up for going out?’ said
Bao-chai. ‘I was going to call out and ask him, but he is getting so crotchety lately
that I thought I had better not.’
‘The Master sent for him,’ said Aroma.
‘Oh dear!’ said Bao-chai. ‘I wonder why he should send for him in heat like this? I
hope he hasn’t thought of something to be angry about and called him over to be
punished.’
‘No, it isn’t that,’ said Aroma. ‘I think it’s to receive a visitor.’
‘It must be a very tiresome visitor,’ said Bao-chai, ‘to go around bothering people
on a boiling day like this instead of staying at home and trying to keep cool.’
‘You can say that again!’ said Aroma.
‘What’s young Xiang-yun been doing at your place?’ said Bao-chai, changing the
subject.
‘We were having a chat,’ said Aroma, ‘and after that she had a look at some
slipper-tops that I’ve got ready pasted and have asked her to sew for me.’
‘You’re an intelligent young woman,’ said Bao-chai, having first looked to right and
left of her to make sure that no one else was about, ‘I should have thought you’d
have sense enough to leave her a few moments in peace. I’ve been watch?ing our
Yun lately, and from what I’ve observed of her and various stray remarks I’ve heard, I
get the impression that back at home she can barely call her soul her own. I know for
a fact that they are too mean to pay for professional seam?stresses and that nearly
all the sewing has to be done by the women of the household, and I’m pretty sure
that’s why, whenever she’s found herself alone with me on these last few visits, she’s
told me how tired she gets at home. When I press her for details, her eyes fill with
tears and she answers evasively, as though she’d like to tell me but daren’t. It must
be very hard for her, losing both her parents when she was so young. It quite wrings
my heart to see her so exploited.’
Aroma smote her hands together as understanding dawned.
‘Yes, I see. I see now why she was so slow with those ten butterfly bows I asked her
to sew for me last month. It was ages before she sent them, and even then there was
a message to say that she’d only been able to do them roughly. She told me I’d better
use them on something else. “If you want nice, even ones,” she said, “you’ll have to
wait until next time I come to stay with you.” Now I can see why. She didn’t like to
refuse when I asked her, but I suppose she had to sit up till midnight doing them,
poor thing. Oh, how stupid of me! I’d never have asked her if I’d realized.’
‘Last time she was here, she told me that it’s quite normal for her to sit up sewing
until midnight,’ said Bao-chai; ‘and if her aunt or the other women catch her doing
the slightest bit of work for anyone else, they are angry with her.’
‘It’s all the fault of that pig-headed young master of mine,’ said Aroma. ‘He refuses
to let any of his sewing be done by the seamstresses outside. Every bit of work, large
or small, has to be done in his room and I just can’t manage it all on my own.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘Why do you take any notice of him? Why not simply give it to the seamstresses
without telling him?’
‘He’s not so easy to fool,’ said Aroma. ‘He can tell the difference. I’m afraid there’s
nothing for it. I shall just have to work through it all gradually on my own.’
‘Now just a minute!’ said Bao-chai. ‘We’ll think of a way round this. Suppose I were
to do some of it for you?’
‘Would you really?’ said Aroma. ‘I’d be so grateful if you would. I’ll come over with
some this evening then.’
She had barely finished saying this when an old woman came rushing up to them in a
state of great agitation.
‘Isn’t it dreadful? Miss Golden has drowned herself in the well.’
‘Which Golden? said Aroma, startled.
‘Which Golden?’ said the old woman. ‘There aren’t two Goldens that I know of.
Golden from Her Ladyship’s room, of course, that was dismissed the day before
yesterday. She’d been crying and carrying on at home ever since, but nobody paid
much attention to her. Then suddenly, when they went to look for her, she wasn’t
there, and just now someone going to fetch water from the well by the south-east
corner found a body in it and rushed inside for help, and when they fished it out,
they found that it was Golden. They did all they could to revive her, but it was too
late. She was dead.’
‘How strange!’ said Bao-chai.
Aroma shook her head wonderingly and a tear or two stole down her cheek. She and
Golden had been like sisters to each other.
Bao-chai hurried off to Lady Wang’s to offer her sympathy. Aroma went back to
Green Delights.

When Bao-chai arrived at Lady Wang’s apartment she found the whole place hushed
and still and Lady Wang sitting in the inner room on her own, crying. Deeming it an
unsuitable moment to raise the subject of her visit, Bao-chai sat down beside her in
silence.
‘Where have you just come from?’ Lady Wang asked her.
‘The Garden.’
‘The Garden,’ Lady Wang echoed. ‘Did you by any chance see your cousin Bao-yu
there?’
‘I saw him going out just now wearing his outdoor clothes, but I don’t know where
he was going to.’
Lady Wang nodded and gave a sigh.
‘I don’t know if you’ve heard. Something very strange has happened. Golden has
drowned herself in a well.’
‘That is strange,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Why ever did she do that?’
‘The day before yesterday she broke something of mine,’ said Lady Wang, ‘and in a
moment of anger I struck her a couple of times and sent her back to her mother’s. I
had only been meaning to leave her there a day or two to punish her. After that I
would have had her back again. I never dreamed that she would be so angry with me
as to drown herself. Now that she has, I feel that it is all my fault.’
‘It’s only natural that a kind person like you should see it in that way,’ said Bao-chai,
‘but in my opinion Golden would never have drowned herself in anger. It’s much
more likely that she was playing about beside the well and slipped in accidentally.
While she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for
her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside. There’s no
earthly reason why she should have felt angry enough with you to drown herself. If
she did, all I can say is that she was a stupid person and not worth feeling sorry for!’
Lady Wang sighed and shook her head doubtfully.
‘Well, it may be as you say, but I still feel very uneasy in my mind.’
‘I’m sure you have no cause, Aunt,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but if you feel very much
distressed, I suggest that you simply give her family a little extra for the funeral. In
that way you will more than fulfill any moral obligation you may have towards her as
a mistress.’
‘I have just given her mother fifty taels,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I wanted to give her two
new outfits as well from one of the girls’ wardrobes, but it just so happens that at the
moment none of them apart from your Cousin Lin has got anything new that would
do. Your Cousin Lin has got two sets that we had made for her next birthday, but she
is such a sensitive child and has had so much sickness and misfortune in her life that
I’m afraid she would almost certainly feel superstitious about the clothes made for
her birthday being used for dress?ing a corpse with, so I’ve had to ask the tailors to
make up a couple in a hurry. Of course, if it were any other maid, I should have given
the mother a few taels and that would have been the end of the matter. But though
Golden was only a servant, she had been with me so long that she had become
almost like a daughter to me.’
She began to cry again as she said this.
‘There’s no need to hurry the tailors about this,’ said Bao-?chai. ‘I’ve got two new
outfits that I recently finished making for myself. Why not let her mother have them
and save them the trouble? Golden once or twice wore old dresses of mine in the
past, so I know they will fit her.’
‘That’s very kind of you, but aren’t you superstitious?’ said Lady Wang.
Bao-chai laughed.
‘Don’t worry about that, Aunt. That sort of thing has never bothered me.’
At that she rose and went off to fetch them. Lady Wang hurriedly ordered two of the
servants to go after her.
When Bao-chai returned with the clothes, she found Bao-yu sitting beside his mother
in tears. Lady Wang was evidently in the midst of rebuking him about something, but
as soon as she caught sight of Bao-chai, she closed her mouth and fell silent. From
the scene before her eyes and the word or two she had overheard, Bao-chai was able
to form a pretty good idea of what had been happening. She handed the clothes over
to Lady Wang and Lady Wang summoned Golden’s mother to come and fetch them.
What happened after that will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 33

An envious younger brother puts in a malicious word or two
And a scapegrace elder brother receives a terrible chastisement

OUR story last told how Golden’s mother was summoned to take away the clothing
that Bao-chai had brought for Golden’s laying-out. When she arrived, Lady Wang
called her inside, and after making her an additional present of some jewellery,
advised her to procure the services of some Buddhist monks to recite a sūtra for the
salvation of the dead girl’s soul. Golden’s mother kotowed her thanks and departed
with the clothes and jewellery.

The news that Golden’s disgrace had driven her to take her own life had reached
Bao-yu as he was returning from his interview with Jia Yu-cun, and he was already in
a state of shock when he went in to see his mother, only to be subjected by her to a
string of accusations and reproaches, to which he was unable to reply. He availed
himself of the opportunity presented by Bao-chai’s arrival to slip quietly out again,
and wandered along, scarcely knowing where he was going, still in a state of shock,
hands clasped behind him, head down low, and sighing as he went.
Without realizing it he was drifting towards the main re?ception hall, and was in fact
just emerging from behind the screen-wall that masked the gateway leading from the
inner to the outer part of the mansion, when he walked head-on into someone
coming from the opposite direction.
‘Stand where you are!’ said this person in a harsh voice.
Bao-yu looked up with a start and saw that it was his father. He gave an involuntary
gasp of fear and, dropping his hands to his sides, hastily assumed a more deferential
posture.
‘Now,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘will you kindly explain the meaning of these sighs and of this
moping, hang-dog appearance? You took your time coming when Yu-cun called for
you just now, and I gather that when you did eventually vouchsafe your presence, he
found you dull and listless and without a lively word to say for yourself. And look at
you now — sullenness and secret depravity written all over your face! What are
these sighings and groanings supposed to indicate? What have you got to he
discontented or displeased about? Come, sit! What is the meaning of this?’
Bao-yu was normally ready enough with his tongue, but on this occasion grief for
Golden so occupied his mind (at that moment he would very willingly have changed
places with her) that though he heard the words addressed to him by his father, he
failed to take in their meaning and merely stared back at him stupidly.
Seeing him too hypnotized by fear — or so it appeared — to answer with his usual
promptness, Jia Zheng, who had not been angry to start with, was now well on the
way to becoming so; but the irate comment he was about to make was checked
when a servant from the outer gate announced that a representative of ‘His Highness
the Prince of Zhong-shun’ had arrived.
Jia Zheng was puzzled.
‘The Prince of Zhong-shun?’ he thought. ‘I have never had any dealings with the
Prince of Zhong-shun. I wonder why he should suddenly send someone to see
me ...?’
‘He told the man to invite the prince’s messenger to sit in the hall, while he himself
hurried inside and changed into court dress. On entering the hall to receive his visitor,
he found that it was the Prince of Zhong-shun’s chamberlain who had come to see
him. After an exchange of bows and verbal salutations, the two men sat down and
tea was served. The chamberlain cut short the customary civilities by coming straight
to the point.
‘It would have been temerity on my part to have intruded on the leisure of an
illustrious scholar in the privacy of his home, but in fact it is not for the purpose of
paying a social call that I am here, but on orders from His Highness. His Highness has
a small request to make of you. If you will be so good as to oblige hint, not only will
His Highness be extremely grateful himself, but I and my colleagues will also be very
much beholden to you.’
Jia Zheng was totally at a loss to imagine what the purpose of the man’s visit might
be; nevertheless he rose to his feet out of respect for the prince and smiled politely.
‘You have orders from His Highness for me? I shall be happy to perform them if you
will have the goodness to instruct me.’
‘I don’t think any performing will be necessary,’ said the chamberlain drily. ‘All we
want from you is a few words. A young actor called Bijou — a female impersonator —
has gone missing from the palace. He hasn’t been back now for four or five days; and
though we have looked everywhere we can think of, we can’t make out where he can
have got to. How?ever, in the course of the very extensive inquiries we have made
both inside and outside the city, eight out of ten of the people we have spoken to say
that he has recently been very thick with the young gentleman who was born with
the jade in his mouth. Well, obviously we couldn’t come inside here and search as we
would have done if this had been anyone else’s house, so we had to go back and
report the matter to His Highness; and His Highness says that though he could view
the loss of a hundred ordinary actors with equanimity, this Bijou is so skilled in
anticipating his wishes and so essential to his peace of mind that it would be utterly
im?possible for him to dispense with his services. I have therefore come here to
request you to ask your son if he will be good enough to let Bijou come back again.
By doing so he will not only earn the undying gratitude of the Prince, but will also
save me and my colleagues a great deal of tiring and disagreeable searching.’
The chamberlain concluded with a sweeping bow.
Surprised and angered by what he had heard, Jia Zheng immediately sent for Bao-yu,
who presently came hurrying in, ignorant of what the reason for his summons might
be.
‘Miserable scum!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It is not enough, apparently, that you should
neglect your studies when you are at home. It seems that you must needs go
perpetrating enor?mities outside. This Bijou I have been hearing about is under the
patronage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Zhong-shun. How could you have the
unspeakable effrontery to commit an act of enticement on his person — involving
me, incidentally, in the consequences of your wrong-doing?’
The question made Bao-yu start.
‘I honestly know nothing about this,’ he said. ‘I don’t even know who or what
“Bijou” is, let alone what you mean by “enticement”’.
Jia Zheng was about to exclaim, but the chamberlain fore?stalled him.
‘There is really no point in concealment, young gentleman,’ he said coldly. ‘Even if
you are not hiding him here, we are sure that you know where he is. In either case
you had much better say straight out and save us a lot of trouble. I’d be greatly
obliged if you would.’
‘I really don’t know,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You must have been misinformed.’
The chamberlain gave a sardonic laugh.
‘I have, of course, got evidence for what I am saying and I’m afraid you are doing
yourself little good by forcing me to mention it in front of your father. You say you
don’t know who Bijou is. Very well. Then will you kindly explain how his red
cummerbund came to find its way around your waist?’
Bao-yu stared at him open-mouthed, too stunned to reply.
‘If he knows even a private thing like that,’ he thought, ‘there’s little likelihood of
my being able to hoodwink him about anything else. I’d better get rid of him as
quickly as possible, before he can say any more.’
‘Since you have managed to find out so much about him,’ he said, finding his
tongue at last, ‘I’m surprised that so im?portant a thing as buying a house should
have escaped you. From what I’ve heard, he recently acquired a little villa and an
acre or so of land at Fort Redwood, seven miles east of the walls. I suppose he could
be there.’
The chamberlain smiled.
‘If you say so, then no doubt that is where we shall find him. I shall go and look
there immediately. If I do find him there, you will hear no more from me; if not, I
shall be back again for further instructions.’
So saying, he hurriedly took his leave.
Jia Zheng, his eyes glaring and his mouth contorted with rage, went after the
chamberlain to see him out. He turned briefly towards Bao-yu as he was leaving the
hall.
‘You stay where you are. I shall deal with you when I get back.’
As he was on his way in again after seeing the chamberlain off the premises, Jia Huan
with two or three pages at his heels came stampeding across the courtyard.
‘Hit that boy!’ Jia Zheng shouted, outraged. But Jia Huan, reduced to a quivering
jelly of fear by the sight of his father, had already jolted to a halt and was standing
with bowed head in front of him.
‘And what is the meaning of this?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What has become of the people
who are supposed to look after you? Why do they allow you to gallop around in this
extraordinary fashion?’ His voice rose to a shout: ‘Where are the people responsible
for taking this boy to school?’
Jia Huan saw in his father’s anger an opportunity of exer?cising his malice.
‘I didn’t mean to run, Father, but just as I was going by the well back there I saw the
body of a maid who had drowned herself — all swollen up with water, and her head
all swollen. It was horrible. I just couldn’t help myself.’
Jia Zheng heard him with incredulous horror.
‘What are you saying? Who has drowned herself? Such a thing has never before
happened in our family. Our family has always been lenient and considerate in its
treatment of in?feriors. It is one of our traditions. I suppose it is because I have been
too neglectful of household matters during these last few years. Those in charge have
felt encouraged to abuse their authority, until finally an appalling thing like this can
happen an innocent young life cut off by violence. What a terrible dis?grace to our
ancestors if this should get about!’ He turned and shouted a command.
‘Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da!’
‘Sir!’ chorused the pages, and were on the point of doing so when Jia Huan
impulsively stepped forward, threw himself on his knees and clung to his father’s
skirts.
‘Don’t be angry with me, Father, but apart from the ser?vants in Lady Wang’s room,
no one else knows anything about this. I heard my mother say -’
He broke off and glanced around behind him. Jia Zheng understood and signaled with
his eyes to the pages, who obediently withdrew some distance back to either side of
the courtyard. Jia Huan continued in a voice lowered almost to a whisper.
‘My mother told me that the day before yesterday, in Lady Wang’s room, my
brother Bao-yu tried to rape one of Her Ladyship’s maids called Golden, and when
she wouldn’t let him, he gave her a beating; and Golden was so upset that she threw
herself in the well and was drowned --’
Jia Zheng, whose face had now turned to a ghastly gold-leaf colour, interrupted him
with a dreadful cry.
‘Fetch Bao-yu!’
He began to stride towards his study, shouting to all and sundry as he went.
‘If anyone tries to stop me this time, I shall make over my house and property and
my post at the Ministry and every?thing else I have to him and Bao-yu. I absolutely
refuse to be responsible for the boy any longer. I shall cut off my few remaining hairs
(those that worry and wretchedness have left me) and look for some clean and
decent spot to end my days in. Perhaps in that way I shall escape the charge of
having dis?graced my ancestors by rearing this unnatural monster as my son.’
When they saw the state he was in, the literary gentlemen and senior menservants
who were waiting for him in the study, guessed that Bao-yu must be the cause of it
and, looking at each other with various grimaces, biting their thumbs or sticking their
tongues out, hastily retreated from the room. Jia-Zheng entered it alone and sat
down, stiffly upright, in a chair. He was breathing heavily and his face was bathed in
tears. Presently, when he had regained his breath, he barked out a rapid series of
commands:
‘Bring Bao-yu here. Get a heavy bamboo. Get some rope to tie him with. Close the
courtyard gates. If anyone tries to take word through inside, kill him!’
‘Sir! — Sir! — Sir!’ the terrified pages chorused in unison at each of his commands,
and some of them went off to look for Bao-yu.
Jia Zheng’s ominous ‘Stay where you are’ as he went out with the chamberlain had
warned Bao-yu that something dire was imminent — though just how much more
dire as a result of Jia Huan’s malicious intervention he could not have foreseen and as
he stood where his father had left him, he twisted and turned himself about,
anxiously looking for some passer-by who could take a message through to the
womenfolk inside. But no one came. Even the omnipresent Tealeaf was on this
occasion nowhere to be seen. Then suddenly, in answer to his prayers, an old woman
appeared — a darling, precious treasure of an old woman (or so she seemed at that
moment) — and he dashed forward and clung to her beseechingly.
‘Quickly!’ he said. ‘Go and tell them that Sir Zheng is going to beat me. Quickly!
Quickly! Goand tell. GO AND TELL.’
Partly because agitation had made him incoherent and partly because, as ill luck
would have it, the old woman was deaf, almost everything he said had escaped her
except for the ‘Go and tell’, which she misheard as ‘in the well’. She smiled at him
reassuringly.
‘Let her jump in the well then, young master. Don’t you worry your pretty head
about it!’
Realizing that he had deafness, too, to contend with, he now became quite frantic.
‘GO AND TELL MY PAGES.’
‘Her wages?’ the old woman asked in some surprise. ‘Bless you, of course they paid
her wages! Her Ladyship gave a whole lot of money towards the funeral as well. And
clothes. Paid her wages, indeed!’
Bao-yu stamped his feet in a frenzy of impatience. He was still wondering
despairingly how to make her understand when Jia Zheng’s pages arrived and forced
him to go with them to the study.
Jia Zheng turned a pair of wild and bloodshot eyes on him as he entered. Forgetting
the ‘riotous and dissipated conduct abroad leading to the unseemly bestowal of
impudicities on a theatrical performer’ and the ‘neglect of proper pursuits and
studies at home culminating in the attempted violation of a parent’s maidservant’
and all the other high-sounding charges he had been preparing to hurl against him,
he shouted two brief orders to the pages.
‘Gag his mouth. Beat him to death.’
The pages were too frightened not to comply. Two held Bao-yu face downwards on a
bench while a third lifted up the flattened bamboo sweep and began to strike him
with it across the hams. After about a dozen blows Jia Zheng, not satisfied that his
executioner was hitting hard enough, kicked him impatiently aside, wrested the
bamboo from his grasp, and, gritting his teeth, brought it down with the utmost
savagery on the places that had already been beaten.
At this point the literary gentlemen, sensing that Bao-yu was in serious danger of life
and limb, came in again to remonstrate; but Jia Zheng refused to hear them.
‘Ask him what he has done and then tell me if you think I should spare him,’ he said.
‘It is the encouragement of people like you that has corrupted him; and now, when
things have come to this pass, you intercede for him. I suppose you would like me to
wait until he commits parricide, or worse. Would you still intercede for him then?’
They could see from this reply that he was beside himself. Wasting no further time
on words, they quickly withdrew and looked for someone to take a message through
inside.
Lady Wang did not stop to tell Grandmother Jia when she received it. She snatched
up an outer garment, pulled it about her, and, supported by a single maid, rushed off,
not caring what menfolk might see her, to the outer study, bursting into it with such
suddenness that the literary gentlemen and other males present were unable to
avoid her.
Her entry provoked Jia Zheng to fresh transports of fury. Faster and harder fell the
bamboo on the prostrate form of Bao-yu, which by now appeared to be unconscious,
for when the boys holding it down relaxed their hold and fled from their Mistress’s
presence, it had long since ceased even to twitch. Even so Jia Zheng would have
continued beating it had not Lady Wang clasped the bamboo to her bosom and
prevented him.
‘Enough!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Today you are determined, all of you, to drive me insane.’
‘No doubt Bao-yu deserved to be beaten,’ said Lady Wang tearfully, ‘but it is bad for
you to get over excited. Besides, you ought to have some consideration for Lady Jia.
She is not at all well in this frightful heat. It may not seem to you of much
consequence to kill Bao-yu, but think what the effect would be on her.’
‘Don’t try that sort of talk with me!’ said Jia Zheng bitterly. ‘Merely by fathering a
monster like this I have proved myself an unfilial son; yet whenever in the past I have
tried to disci?pline him, the rest of you have all conspired against me to protect him.
Now that I have the opportunity at last, I may as well finish off what I have begun and
put him down, like the vermin he is, before he can do any more damage.’
So saying, he took up a rope and would have put his threat into execution, had not
Lady Wang held her arms around him to prevent it.
‘Of course you should discipline your son,’ she said, weep?ing, ‘but you have a wife
too, Sir Zheng, don’t forget. I am nearly fifty now and this wretched boy is the only
son I have. If you insist on making an example of him, I dare not do much to dissuade
you. But to kill him outright that is deliberately to make me childless. Better strangle
me first, if you are going to strangle him. Let the two of us die together. At least I
shall have some support then in the world to come, if all support in this world is to
be denied me!’
With these words she threw herself upon Bao-yu’s body and, lifting up her voice,
began weeping with noisy abandon. Jia Zheng, who had heard her with a sigh, sank
into a chair and himself broke down in a fit of weeping.
Presently Lady Wang began to examine the body she was clasping. Bao-yu’s face was
ashen, his breathing was scarcely perceptible, and the trousers of thin green silk
which clothed the lower part of his body were so soaked with blood that their colour
was no longer recognizable. Feverishly she un?fastened his waistband and drew
them back. Everywhere, from the upper part of his buttocks down to his calves, was
either raw and bloody or purplish black with bruises. Not an inch of sound flesh was
to be seen. The sight made her cry out involuntarily.
‘Oh my son! My unfortunate son!’
Once more she broke down into uncontrollable weeping.
Her own words reminded her of the son she had already lost, and now, with added
bitterness, she began to call out his name.
‘Oh, Zhu! Zhu! If only you had lived, I shouldn’t have minded losing a hundred other
sons!’
By this time news of Lady Wang’s démarche had circulated to the other members of
the inner mansion and Li Wan, Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had come to
join her. The invocation of her dead husband’s name, painful to all of them, was
altogether too much for Li Wan, who broke into loud sobs on hearing it. Jia Zheng
himself was deeply affected, and tears as round as pumpkins rolled down both his
cheeks. It was beginning to look as if they might all go on weeping there indefinitely,
since no one would make a move; but just then there was a cry of ‘Her Old
Ladyship—!’ from one of the maids, interrupted by a quavering voice outside the
window.
‘Kill me first! You may as well kill both of us while you are about it!’
As much distressed by his mother’s words as he was alarmed by her arrival, Jia Zheng
hurried out to meet her. She was leaning on the shoulder of a little maid, her old
head swaying from side to side with the effort of running, and pant?ing as she ran.
Jia Zheng bowed down before her and his face assumed the semblance of a smile.
‘Surely, Mother, in such hot weather as this there is no need for you to come here?
If you have any instructions, you should call for me and let me come to you.’
Grandmother Jia had stopped when she heard this voice and now stood panting for
some moments while she regained her breath. When she spoke, her voice had an
unnatural shrillness in it.
‘Oh! Are you speaking to me? — Yes, as a matter of fact I have got instructions”, as
you put it; but as unfortunately I’ve never had a good son who cares for me, there’s
no one I can give them to.’
Wounded in his most sensitive spot, Jia Zheng fell on his knees before her. The voice
in which he replied to her was broken with tears.
‘How can I bear it, Mother, if you speak to me like that? What I did to the boy I did
for the honour of the family.’
Grandmother Jia spat contemptuously.
‘A single harsh word from me and you start whining that you can’t bear it. How do
you think Bao-yu could bear your cruel rod? And you say you’ve been punishing him
for the honour of the family, but you just tell me this: did your own father ever
punish yon in such a way? I think not.’
She was weeping now herself.
‘Don’t upset yourself, Mother,’ said Jia Zheng, with the same forced smile. ‘I acted
too hastily. From now on I’ll never beat him again, if that’s what you wish.’
‘Hoity-toity, keep your temper!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘He’s your son. If you want
to beat him, that’s up to you. If we women are in your way, we’ll leave you alone to
get on with it.’ She turned to her attendants. ‘Call my carriage. Your Mistress and I
and Bao-yu are going back to Nanking. We shall be leaving immediately.’
The servants made a show of compliance.
‘No need for you to cry,’ she said, turning to Lady Wang. ‘You love Bao-yu now that
he’s young, but when he’s grown up and become an important official, he’ll like
enough forget that you’re his mother. Much better force yourself not to love him
now and save yourself some anguish later on.’
Jia Zheng threw himself forward on his face.
‘Don’t say that, Mother! Don’t reject your own son!’
‘On the contrary,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘it is you who have rejected me’. But don’t
worry. When I have gone back to Nanking, there will be no one here to stop you. You
can beat away to your heart’s content.’ She turned to the servants.
‘Come on, hurry up with that packing! And get the carriage and horses ready so
that we can be on our way.’
Jia Zheng’s kotows were by now describing the whole quarter circle from
perpendicular to ground. But the old lady walked on inside, ignoring him.
From the sight that met her eyes she could tell that this had been no ordinary
beating. It filled her with anguish for the sufferer and fresh anger for the man who
had inflicted it, and for a long time she clung to the inert form and wept, only
gradually calming down under the combined coaxing of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Li
Wan.
At this point several of the maids and women servants came forward and attempted
to raise Bao-yu to his feet.
‘Idiots!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Haven’t you got eyes in your heads? Can’t you see that he’s in
no fit state to walk? Go and get that wicker summer-bed from inside and carry him in
on that.’
The servants rushed out and presently reappeared carrying a long, narrow couch of
woven rattan between them, on to which they lifted Bao-yu. Then, with
Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest of the womenfolk leading the way, they
carried him to Grandmother Jia’s apartment and set him down inside it.
Jia Zheng, conscious that his mother’s wrath against him had not abated and
unwilling to leave things where they stood, had followed the little procession inside.
His eyes travelled from Bao-yu, who, he now saw, really had been beaten very badly,
to Lady Wang. She was sobbing bitterly, interspersing her sobs with cries of ‘My
child!’ and ‘My son!’. Presently she broke off and began railing at the object of her
sorrow: ‘Why couldn’t you have died instead of Zhu? Zhu wouldn’t have made his
father angry the way you do and I should have been spared this constant anxiety.
What is to become of me if you go away and leave me, too?’ Then, with a cry of ‘Poor,
worthless boy!’, she fell once more to weeping. When Jia Zheng heard this, his own
heart was softened and he began to wish that he had not beaten the boy quite so
savagely. He tried to find words of comfort for his old mother, but she answered him
tearfully.
‘A father ought to punish his son if he’s done wrong, but not like that! — Why don’t
you go now? Won’t you be content until you’ve seen the boy die under your own
eyes?’
Jia Zheng, with flustered deference, withdrew.
By now Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and Shi Xiang-yun were there too. Aroma
was deeply distressed, but could not show the extent of her feelings in the presence
of so many others. Indeed, Bao-yu was so ringed around with people fanning him or
forcing water through his lips that there was nothing she could have done for him if
she had tried. Feeling somewhat superfluous, she left the apartment and went out to
the inner gate, where she asked the pages to look for Tealeaf, so that she could find
out what had hap?pened.
‘Why did the Master suddenly beat him like that?’ she asked Tealeaf when he
arrived. ‘He hadn’t been doing any?thing. And why couldn’t you have warned us in
time?’
Tealeaf was indignant.
‘I couldn’t help it, I wasn’t there. He was half-way through beating him before I
even got to hear about it. I did my best to find out the reason, though. It seems that
there were two things the Master was upset about: one was to do with Bijou and the
other was to do with Golden.’
‘How did the Master get to know about them?’ said Aroma. ‘Well, the Bijou
business he probably knew about indirectly through Mr Xue,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Mr Xue
had been feeling very jealous, and it looks as though he may have put someone else
up to telling the Master about it out of spite. And Golden he probably heard about
from Master Huan - leastways, that’s what the Master’s own people told me.’
The two reasons Tealeaf had given corresponded well enough with Aroma’s own
observations, and she was more than half inclined to believe them. Fairly confident,
therefore, that she now knew the cause of what had happened, she re?turned once
more to the apartment. The ministrations of those surrounding Bao-yu had by now
restored him to fall consciousness, and Grandmother Jia was instructing the
ser?vants to carry him back to his own room. There was an answering cry and
something of a scramble as many willing hands lifted up the cane bed. Then,
preceded as before by Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest, they carried him
through into the Garden and back to Green Delights, where they finally got him on to
his own bed. After a good deal more bustle they gradually all drifted away and Aroma
at last had Bao-yu alone to herself.
But in order to know what happened then, you must refer to the following chapter.
CHAPTER 34

A wordless message meets with silent understanding
And a groundless imputation leads to undeserved rebukes



WHEN she saw that Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest had all gone, Aroma
went and sat down at Bao-yu’s bed?side and asked him, with tears in her eyes, the
reason why he had been beaten so severely.
Bao-yu sighed.
‘Oh, the usual things. Need you ask? I wish you’d take a look down below, though,
and tell me if anything’s broken. It’s hurting so dreadfully down there.’
Very gently Aroma inserted her fingers into the top of his trousers and began to draw
them off. She had barely started when he gritted his teeth and let out a cry, and she
had to stop immediately. This happened three or four times before she finally
succeeded in getting them off. The sight revealed made her grit her own teeth.
‘Mother of mine!’ she gasped, ‘he must have hit you savagely. If only you’d listened
to me a bit in the past, it would never have come to this. Why, you might have been
crippled for life. It doesn’t bear thinking of.’
Just then Bad-chai’s arrival was announced by one of the maids. Since putting his
trousers on again was out of the question, Aroma snatched up a lightweight coverlet
and hur?riedly threw it over him. Bao-chai came in carrying a large tablet of some
sort of solid medicine which she instructed Aroma to pound up in wine and apply to
Bao-yu’s injuries in the evening.
‘This is a decongestant,’ she said, handing it to her. ‘It will take away the
inflammation by dispersing the bad blood in his bruises. After that, he should heal
quite quickly.’
She turned to Bao-yu.
‘Are you feeling any better now?’
Bao-yu thanked her. Yes, he said, he was feeling a little better, and invited her to sit
down beside him. Bao-chai was relieved to see him with his eyes open and talking
again. She shook her head sadly.
‘If you had listened to what one said, this would never have happened. Everyone is
so upset now. It isn’t only Grandmother and Lady Wang, you know. Even—’
She checked herself abruptly, regretting that she had allowed her feelings to run
away with her, and lowered her head, blushing. Bao-yu had sensed hidden depths of
feeling in the passionate earnestness of her tone, and when she suddenly faltered
and turned red, there was something so touching about the pretty air of confusion
with which she dropped her head and played with the ends of her girdle, that his
spirits soared and his pain was momentarily forgotten.
‘What have I undergone but a few whacks of the bamboo?’ he thought, ‘—yet
already they are so sad and concerned about me! What dear, adorable, sweet, noble
girls they are! Heaven knows how they would grieve for me if I were actually to die! It
would be almost worth dying, just to find out. The loss of a life’s ambitions would be
a small price to pay, and I should be a peevish, ungrateful ghost if I did not feel proud
and happy when such darling creatures were grieving for me.’
He was roused from this reverie by the sound of Bao-chai’s voice asking Aroma what
it was that had moved his father to such violent anger against him. Aroma’s low reply,
in which she merely repeated what Tealeaf had told her, was his first inkling of the
part that Jia Huan had played in his misfortune. Her mention of Xue Pan’s
involvement, however, made him apprehensive that Bao-chai might feel embarrassed,
and he hastily interrupted Aroma to prevent her from saying more.
Old Xue would never do a thing like that,’ he said. ‘It’s silly to make these wild
assertions.’
Bao-chai knew that it was out of respect for her feelings that he was silencing Aroma,
and she wondered at his considerateness.
‘What delicacy of feeling!’ she thought, ‘after so terrible a beating and in spite of all
the pain, to be still able to worry about the possibility of someone else’s being
offended! If only you could apply some of that thoughtfulness to the more important
things of life, my friend, you would make my Uncle so happy; and then perhaps these
awful things would never happen. And when all’s said and done, this sensibility on
my behalf is rather wasted. Do you really think I know my own brother so little that I
am unaware of his unruly nature? Nothing has ever been allowed to stand in the way
of Pan’s desires. Look at the terrible trouble he made for you that time over Qin
Zhong. That was a long time ago, and I am sure he has got much worse since then.’
Those were her thoughts, but what she said was:
‘There’s really no need to look around for someone to blame. If you ask me, the
mere fact that Cousin Bao has been willing to keep such company was in itself quite
enough to make Uncle angry. And though my brother can be very tactless and may
well have let something out about Cousin Bao in the course of conversation, I’m sure
it wouldn’t have been deliberate trouble-making on his part. In the first place, it is,
after all, true, what he is supposed to have said: Cousin Bao has been going around
with that actor. And in the second place, my brother simply hasn’t got it in him to be
discreet. You have lived all your life with sensitive, considerate people like Cousin Bao,
my dear Aroma. You have never had to deal with a crude, forthright person like my
brother someone who says whatever comes into his head with complete dis?regard
for the consequences.’
When Bao-yu cut short her remarks about Xue Pan, Aroma had realized at once that
she was being tactless and inwardly prayed that Bao-chai had not taken exception to
them. To her, therefore, these words of Bao-chai’s were a source of tongue-tied
embarrassment. Bao-yu, on the other hand, could see in them only the refusal of a
frank and generous nature to admit deviousness in others and a sensibility capable of
matching and responding to his own. As a consequence his spirits soared yet higher.
He was about to say something, but Bao-chai rose to her feet and anticipated him.
‘I’ll come and see you again tomorrow. You must rest now and give yourself a
chance to get well. I’ve given Aroma something to make a lotion with. Get her to put
it on for you in the evening. I can guarantee that it will hasten your re?covery.’
She was moving towards the door as she said this. When she was outside, Aroma
hurried after her to see her off and to thank her for her trouble.
‘As soon as he’s better,’ she said, ‘Master Bao will come over and thank you himself,
Miss.’
‘It’s nothing at all,’ said Bao-chai, turning back to her with a smile. ‘Do tell him to
rest properly, though, and not to brood. And if there’s anything at all he wants, just
quietly come round to my place for it. Don’t go bothering Lady Jia or Lady Wang or
any of the others, in case my uncle gets to hear of it. It probably wouldn’t matter at
the time, but it might do later on, next time there is any trouble.’
With that she left, and Aroma turned back into the court?yard, her heart full of
gratitude for Bao-chai’s kindness. Re?entering Bao-yu’s room, she found him lying
back quietly, plunged in thought. From the look of it, he was already half asleep.
Tiptoeing out again, she went off to wash her hair.
But it was difficult for Bao-yu to lie quietly for very long. The pain in his buttocks was
like the stabbing and pricking of knives and needles and there was a burning
sensation in them as if he were being grilled over a fire, so that the slightest
movement made him cry out. Already it was growing late. Aroma appeared to have
gone away, but two or three maids were still in attendance. As there was nothing
that they could do for him, he told them that they might go off and prepare
themselves for the night, provided that they remained within call. The maids
accordingly withdrew, leaving him on his own.
He had dozed off. The shadowy form of Jiang Yu-han had come in to tell him of his
capture by the Prince of Zhong?-shun’s men, followed, shortly after, by Golden, who
gave him a tearful account of how she had drowned herself. In his half? dream,
half-awake state he was having the greatest difficulty in attending to what they were
saying, when suddenly he felt someone pushing him and became dimly aware of a
sound of weeping in his ear. He gave a start. Fully awake now, he opened his eyes. It
was Lin Dai-yu. Suspecting this, too, to be a dream, he raised his head to look. A pair
of eyes swollen like peaches met his own, and a face that was glistening with tears. It
was Dai-yu all right, no doubt about that. He would have looked longer, but the strain
of raising himself was causing such excruciating pain in his nether parts, that he fell
back again with a groan. The groan was followed by a sigh.
‘Now what have you come for?’ he said. ‘The sun’s not long set and the ground
must still be very hot underfoot. You could still get a heat-stroke at this time of day,
and that would he a fine how-do-you-do. Actually, in spite of the beating, I don’t feel
very much pain. This fuss I make is put on to fool the others. I’m hoping they’ll
spread the word around outside how badly I’ve been hurt, so that Father gets to hear
of it. It’s all shamming, really. You mustn’t be taken in by it.’
Dai-yu’s sobbing had by this time ceased to be audible; but somehow her strangled,
silent weeping was infinitely more pathetic than the most clamorous grief. At that
moment volumes would have been inadequate to contain the things she wanted to
say to him; yet all she could get out, after struggling for some time with her choking
sobs, was
‘I suppose you’ll change now.’
Bao-yu gave a long sigh.
‘Don’t worry, I shan’t change. People like that are worth dying for. I wouldn’t
change if he killed me.’
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when they heard someone outside in the
courtyard saying:
‘Mrs Lian has come.’
Dai-yu had no wish to see Xi-feng, and rose to her feet hurriedly.
Bao-yu seized hold of her hand.
‘Now that’s funny. Why should you start being afraid of her all of a sudden?’
She stamped with impatience.
‘Look at the state my eyes are in I’ she said. ‘I don’t want them all making fun of me
again.’
At that Bao-yu released her hand and she bounded round to the back of the bed,
slipping into the rear courtyard just as Xi-feng was entering the room from the front.
‘A bit better now?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is there anything you feel like eating yet? If there is,
tell them to come round to my place and get it.’
As soon as Xi-feng had gone, Bao-yu was visited by Aunt Xue, and shortly after that
by someone whom his grandmother had sent to see how he was getting on. At
lighting-up time, after taking a few mouthfuls of soup, he settled down into a fitful
sleep.
Just then a new group of visitors arrived, consisting of Zhou Rui’s wife, Wu Xin-deng’s
wife, Zheng Hao-shi’s wife, and those other members of the mansion’s female staff
who had had most to do with Bao-yu in the past and who, having heard of his beating,
were anxious to see how he was. Aroma came out smiling on to the verandah to
welcome them.
‘You’re just too late to see him, ladies,’ she told them in a low voice. ‘He’s just this
minute dropped off.’
She ushered them into the Outer room, invited them to be seated, and served them
with tea. After sitting there very quietly for several minutes, they got up to take their
leave, requesting Aroma as they did so that she would inform Bao-yu when he waked
that they had been round to ask about him. Aroma promised to do so and showed
them out. Just as she was about to go in again, an old woman arrived from Lady
Wang’s to say that ‘Her Ladyship would like to see one of Master Bao’s people.’ After
reflecting for a moment, Aroma turned to the house and called softly to Skybright,
Musk and Ripple inside.
‘Her Ladyship wants to see someone, so I’m going over. Stay indoors and keep an
eye on things while I’m away. I shan’t be long.’
Then she followed the old woman out of the Garden and round to Lady Wang’s
apartment in the central courtyard. She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane
summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely
pleased when she saw that it was Aroma.
‘You could have sent one of the others,’ she said. ‘There was no need for you to
come and leave him unattended.’
Aroma smiled reassuringly.
‘Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want
anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own.
Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send
one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was
afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted.’
‘I have nothing in particular to tell you,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I merely wanted to ask
about my son. How is the pain now?’
‘Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him,’ said
Aroma. ‘It was so bad before that he couldn’t lie still, but now he’s sleeping quite
soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was.’
‘Has he had anything to eat yet?’ said Lady Wang.
‘He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent,’ said Aroma, ‘but that’s all
he would take. He kept complain?ing that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum
bitters to drink, but of course that’s an astringent, and I thought to myself that as he’
d just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and
hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and
if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious
illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose
syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him; but after only half a cup of it he said it
tasted sickly and he couldn’t get it down.’
‘Oh dear, I wish you’d told me sooner,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We were sent some bottles
of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was
going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably
only get wasted, so I didn’t. If he can’t manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a
few of them to take back with you. You need only mix a teaspoonful of essence in a
cupful of water. The flavours are quite delicious.’ She called Suncloud to her. ‘Fetch
me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day.’
‘Two will be enough,’ said Aroma, ‘otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run out, I
can always come back for more later.’
Suncloud was gone for a considerable time. Eventually she returned with two little
glass bottles, each about three inches high, which she handed to Aroma. They had
screw on silver tops and yellow labels. One of them was labelled ‘Essence of Cassia
Flower’ and the other one ‘Essence of Roses’.
‘What tiny little bottles!’ said Aroma. ‘They can’t hold very much. I suppose the
stuff inside them must be very precious.’
‘It was made specially for the Emperor,’ said Lady Wang. ‘That’s what the yellow
labels mean. Haven’t you seen labels like that before? Mind you look after them and
don’t let the stuff in them get wasted.’
Aroma promised to be careful and began to go.
‘Just a minute!’ said Lady Wang. ‘I’ve thought of some-thing else that I wanted to
ask you.’
Aroma returned. Lady Wang first glanced about her to make sure that no one else
was in the room, then she said:
‘I think I heard someone say that Bao-yu’s beating today was because of something
that Huan had said to Sir Zheng. I suppose you don’t happen to have heard anything
about that?’
‘No. I haven’t heard anything about that,’ said Aroma. ‘What I heard was that it was
because Master Bao had been going around with one of Prince Somebody or other’s
players and the Master was told about it by someone who called.’
Lady Wang nodded her head mysteriously.
‘Yes, that was one of the reasons. But there was another reason as well.’
‘I really know nothing about any other reason, Your Lady?ship,’ said Aroma. She
dropped her head and hesitated a moment before going on. ‘I wonder if I might be
rather bold and say something very outspoken to Your Ladyship? Really and truly ’
She faltered.
‘Please go on.’
‘I will if Your Ladyship will promise not to he angry with me.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Just tell me what you have to say.’
‘Well, really and truly,’ said Aroma, ‘Master Bao needed punishing. If the Master
didn’t keep an eye on him, there’s no knowing what he mightn’t get up to.’
‘My child,’ said Lady Wang with a warmth rarely seen in her, ‘those are exactly my
own sentiments. How clever of you to have understood! Of course, I know perfectly
well that Bao-yu is in need of discipline; and anyone who saw how strict I used to be
with Mr Zhu would realize that I am capable of exercising it. But I have my reasons. A
woman of fifty cannot expect to bear any more children and Bao-yu is now the only
son I have. He is not a very strong boy; and his Grannie dotes on him. I daren’t risk
being strict. I daren’t risk losing another son. I daren’t risk angering Her Old Ladyship
and upsetting the whole household. I do once in a while have it out with him but
though I have argued and pleaded and wept, it doesn’t do any good. He seems all
right at the time, but he’ll be just the same again a short while afterwards and I
always know that I have failed to reach him. Jam afraid he has to suffer before he can
learn but suppose it’s too much for him? - suppose he doesn’t get over this beating?
What will become of me?’
She began to cry.
Seeing her mistress so distressed, Aroma herself was affected and began to cry too.
‘I can understand Your Ladyship being so upset,’ she said, ‘when he’s your own son.
Even we servants that have been with him for a few years get worried about him. The
most that we can ever hope for is to do our duty and get by without too much
trouble but even that won’t be possible if he goes on the way he has been doing. I’m
always telling him to change his ways. Every day every hour I tell him. But it’s no use;
he won’t listen. Of course, if these people will make so much fuss of him, you can
hardly blame him for going round with them though it does make our job more
difficult. But now that Your Ladyship has spoken like this, it puts me in mind of
something that’s been worrying me which I should like to have asked Your Ladyship’s
advice about, only I was afraid you might take it amiss, and then not only should I
have spoken to no purpose, but I should leave myself without even a grave to lie in...’
It was evident to Lady Wang that what she was struggling to get out was a matter of
some consequence.
‘What is it you want to tell me, my child?’ she said kindly. ‘I’ve heard a lot of people
praising you recently, and I confess that I assumed it must be because you took
special pains in serving Bao-yu or in making yourself agreeable to other people —
little things of that sort. But I see that I was wrong. These are not at all little things
that you have been talking about. What you have said so far makes very good sense
and entirely accords with my own opinion of the matter. So if you have anything to
tell me, I should like to hear it. But I must ask you not to discuss it with anyone else.’
‘All I really wanted to ask,’ said Aroma, ‘was if Your Lady?ship could advise me how
later on we can somehow or other contrive to get Master Bao moved back outside
the Garden,’
Lady Wang looked startled and clutched Aroma’s hand in some alarm.
‘I hope Bao-yu hasn’t been doing something dreadful with one of the girls?’
‘Oh no, Your Ladyship, please don’t suspect that!’ said Aroma hurriedly. ‘That
wasn’t my meaning at all. It’s just that—if you’ll allow me to say so—Master Bao and
the young ladies are beginning to grow up now, and though they are all cousins,
there is the difference of sex between them, which makes it very awkward
sometimes when they are all living together, especially in the case of Miss Lin and
Miss Bao, who aren’t even of the same clan. One can’t help feeling uneasy. Even to
outsiders it looks like a very strange sort of family. They say “where nothing happens,
imagination is busiest”, and I’m sure lots of unaccountable misfortunes begin when
some innocent little thing we did unthinkingly gets mis?construed in someone else’s
imagination and reported as something terrible. We just have to be on our guard
against that sort of thing happening especially when Master Bao has such a peculiar
character, as Your Ladyship knows, and spends all his time with girls. He only has to
make the tiniest slip in an unguarded moment, and whether he really did anything or
not, with so many people about and some of them no better than they should be
there is sure to be scandal. For you know what some of these people are like, Your
Ladyship. If they feel well-disposed towards you, they’ll make you out to be a saint;
but if they’re not, then Heaven help you! If Master Bao lives to be spoken well of’ we
can count ourselves lucky; but the way things are, it only needs someone to breathe
a word of scandal and - I say nothing of what will happen to us servants—it’s of no
consequence if we’re all chopped up for mincemeat—but what’s more important,
Master Bao’s reputa?tion will be destroyed for life and all the care and worry Your
Ladyship and Sir Zheng have had on his account will have been wasted. I know Your
Ladyship is very busy and can’t be expected to think of everything, and I probably
shouldn’t have thought of this myself, but once I had thought of it, it seemed to me
that it would be wrong of me not to tell Your Ladyship, and it’s been preying on my
mind ever since. The only reason I haven’t mentioned it before is because I was
afraid Your Ladyship might be angry with me.’
What Aroma had just been saying about misconstructions and scandals so exactly
fitted what had in fact happened in the case of Golden that for a moment Lady Wang
was quite taken aback. But on reflection she felt nothing but love and gratitude for
this humble servant-girl who had shown so much solici?tude on her behalf.
‘It is very perceptive of you, my dear, to have thought it all out so carefully,’ she said.
‘I have, of course, thought about this matter myself’ but other things have put it from
my mind, and what you have just said has reminded me. It is most thoughtful of you.
You are a very, very good girl — Well, you may go now. I think I now know what to do.
There is just one thing before you go, though. Now that you have spoken to me like
this, I am going to place Bao-yu entirely in your hands. Be very careful with him,
won’t you? Remember that anything you do for him you will be doing also for me.
You will find that I am not ungrateful.’
Aroma stood for a moment with bowed head, weighing the import of these words.
Then she said:
‘I will do what Your Ladyship has asked me to the utmost of my ability.’
She left the apartment slowly and made her way back to Green Delights, pondering
-as she went. When she arrived, Bao-yu had just woken up, so she told him about the
flavourings. He was pleased and made her mix some for him straight away. It was
quite delicious. He kept thinking about Dai-yu and wanted to send someone over to
see her, but he was afraid that Aroma would disapprove, so, as a means of getting
her out of the way, he sent her over to Bao-chai’s place to borrow a book. As soon as
she had gone, he summoned Skybright.
‘I want you to go to Miss Lin’s for me,’ he said. ‘Just see what she’s doing, and if she
asks about me, tell her I’m all right.’
‘I can’t go rushing in there bald-headed without a reason,’ said Skybright. ‘You’d
better give me some kind of a message, just to give me an excuse for going there.’
‘I have none to give,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Well, give me something to take, then,’ said Skybright, ‘or think of something I can
ask her for. Otherwise it will look so silly.’
Bao-yu thought for a bit and then, reaching out and picking up two of his old
handkerchiefs, he tossed them towards her with a smile.
‘All right. Tell her I said you were to give her these.’
‘That’s an odd sort of present!’ said Skybright. ‘What’s she going to do with a pair
of your old handkerchiefs? Most likely she’ll think you’re making fun of her and get
upset again.’
‘No she won’t,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’ll understand.’
Skybright deemed it pointless to argue, so she picked up the handkerchiefs and went
off to the Naiad’s House. Little Deli?cate, who was hanging some towels out to dry on
the verandah railings, saw her enter the courtyard and attempted to wave her away.
‘She’s gone to bed.’
Skybright ignored her and went on inside. The lamps had not been lit and the room
was in almost total darkness. The voice of Dai-yu, lying awake in bed, spoke to her
out of the shadows.
‘Who is it?’
‘Skybright.’
‘What do you want?’
‘Master Bao has sent me with some handkerchiefs, Miss?
Dai-yu seemed to hesitate. She found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it
could mean.
‘I suppose they must be very good ones,’ she said. ‘Prob?ably someone gave them
to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for
them just now myself.’
Skybright laughed.
‘They’re not new ones, Miss. They’re two of his did, everyday ones.’
This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then
suddenly, in a flash, she understood.
‘Put them down. You may go now.’
Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she
tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her.
Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of
conflicting emotions.
‘I feel so happy,’ she thought, ‘that in the midst of his own affliction he has been
able to grasp the cause of all my trouble.
‘And yet at the same time I am sad,’ she thought; ‘because how do I know that my
trouble will end in the way I want it to?
‘Actually, I feel rather amused,’ she thought. ‘Fancy his sending a pair of old
handkerchiefs like that! Suppose I hadn’t understood what he was getting at?
‘But I feel alarmed that he should be sending presents to me in secret.
‘Oh, and I feel so ashamed when I think how I am forever crying and quarrelling,’
she thought, ‘and all the time he has understood! …’
And her thoughts carried her this way and that, until the ferment of excitement
within her cried out to be expressed. Careless of what the maids might think, she
called for a lamp, sat herself down at her desk, ground some ink, softened her brush,
and proceeded to compose the following quatrains, using the handkerchiefs
themselves to write on:

1
                  Seeing my idle teats, you ask me why
                  These foolish drops fall from my teeming eye:
                  Then know, your gift, being by the merfolk made,
                  In merman’s currency must be repaid.

2
                  Jewelled drops by day in secret sorrow shed
                  Or, in the night-time, in my wakeful bed,
                  Lest sleeve or pillow they should spot or stain,
                       Shall on these gifts shower down their salty rain.

3
                 Yet silk preserves but ill the Naiad’s tears:
                       Each salty trace of them fast disappears.
             Only the speckled bamboo stems that grow
                 Outside the window still her tear marks show.

She had only half-filled the second handkerchief and was pre?paring to write another
quatrain, when she became aware that her whole body was burning hot all over and
her cheeks were afire. Going over to the dressing table, she removed the brocade
cover from the mirror and peered into it.
‘Hmn! “Brighter than the peach-flower’s hue”,’ she mur?mured complacently to the
flushed face that stared out at her from the glass, and, little imagining that what she
had been witnessing was the first symptom of a serious illness, went back to bed, her
mind full of handkerchiefs.
*

From Dai-yu and her handkerchiefs let us return to Aroma, who, it will be
remembered, bad been sent off to Bao-chai’s for a book. When she got there, she
found that Bao-chai was not in the Garden, having gone round to her mother’s place
outside. Not liking to return empty-handed, she waited for Bao-chai to return. It was
already the beginning of the first watch when she did so.
Knowing her brother as she did, Bao-chai had already, even before hearing anything
to that effect, suspected that he was in some way responsible for Bao-yu’s
misfortune. What Aroma had earlier on told her had therefore been no more than
con?firmation of an already existing suspicion. Yet Aroma had only been echoing
what Tealeaf had told her; and what Tealeaf had told her was pure guesswork
without a shred of evidence to support it. Thus what started in everyone’s mind as a
sus?picion, repetition very soon compounded into a certainty. Yet the ironical fact
was that he who by his past behaviour had so richly merited the reputation which
had caused them to sus?pect him was totally innocent on the one occasion when
every?one was most unshakeably convinced of his guilt.
The object of this misunderstanding had on this particular evening returned home
having had a good deal to drink out?side. He greeted his mother and then, observing
that his sister, too, was sitting there, addressed a few desultory remarks to her.
Suddenly he seemed to remember something.
‘I hear young Bao-yu’s been in trouble,’ he said. ‘What was it about?’
This was too much for Aunt Xue, who had been seething inwardly and now broke out
in a fury.
‘Shameless villain! How can you have the face to ask such a question? You know
very well it was all your doing?
Xue Pan stared at her in astonishment.
‘What do you mean, “all my doing”?’
‘Don’t act the injured innocent with me!’ said his mother. ‘Everyone knows it was
you who told.’
‘Oh, and I suppose if everyone said I’d killed somebody, you’d believe that too!’
‘Even your sister knows it was you. I suppose you’re not going to call her a liar?’
Bao-chai hurriedly intervened.
‘Don’t shout so, both of you! If you’d be a bit more -calm and collected, you might
have some chance of getting at the truth.’ She turned to Xue Pan: ‘Anyway, whether it
was you or wasn’t you, the damage is done now. There doesn’t seem much point in
raking it over or making an issue of it. My advice to you is to keep out of mischief
from now on and stop interfering in other people’s affairs. When you spend day after
day fooling around outside, sooner or later something is bound to happen; and you
are such a thoughtless creature, that when it does, people naturally suspect that you
are the one to blame, even if you aren’t. I know I do!’
Xue Pan, for all his faults, was a forthright, outspoken sort of fellow, unused to such
ostrich-like avoidance of the issue. Bao-chai’s strictures about ‘fooling around’ and
his mother’s insistence that he had brought about Bao-yu’s beating by means of a
deliberate indiscretion had exasperated him beyond endurance. He jumped about
excitedly, protesting with the most solemn and desperate oaths that he was
innocent.
‘I’d like to find the comedian who’s been making up these stories about me,’ he
shouted, turning in anger upon the domestics. ‘I’ll smash his rotten face in if I do. Of
course, I know what this is all about: you all want to show how con?cerned you are
for poor, darling Bao-yu, so you’ve decided to do it at my expense. What is he,
anyway? a Deva King? Every time his dad gives him a few whacks on the bum, the
whole household is in a state of uproar about it for days on end. I remember that
time Uncle Zheng beat him for doing something he shouldn’t have and old Lady Jia
decided that Cousin Zhen was at the bottom of it. She had the poor so-and-so hauled
up in front of her and there was hell to pay. Now, this time, you want to drag me into
it. All right then I don’t care. A life for a life. I’ll go in there and kill the little blighter
then you can all do what you like to me.’
In the midst of this bawling he had picked up a door bar and was evidently going off
to execute his threat; but his dis?traught mother clung to him and prevented him
from going.
‘You stupid creature!’ she said. ‘Who do you think you’re going to hit with that? If
you’re going to hit anyone, you’d better begin with me!’
Xue Pan’s exasperation had now reached such a pitch that his eyes stood out in his
head like a pair of copper bells.
‘This is rich!’ he shouted. ‘You won’t let me go and finish him off, yet you won’t
stop provoking me by making up all these lies. Every day that fellow stays alive means
one more day of nagging and lies for me to put up with. We’d much better die, the
pair of us, and make an end of it!’
‘Have a little self-control!’ said Bao-chai, joining in her mother’s efforts to restrain
him. ‘Can’t you see how upset poor Mamma is? You ought to be trying to calm her,
not making things worse with this uproar.’
‘Oh yes! you can say that now,’ said Xue Pan, ‘but it was you who started all this by
telling her about me, wasn’t it?’
‘It’s all very well to blame me for telling Mamma,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Why don’t you
blame yourself for being so careless, you great blabber-mouth ?’
‘Me careless?’ said Xue Pan. ‘What about the way Bao-yu stirs up trouble for
himself then? Let me just give you an example. Let me tell you what happened
between him and Bijou the other day. I’d met Bijou ten times, near enough, and
never had so much as a kind word out of him, yet Bao-yu, that didn’t even know him
by sight, meets him for the first time the other day, and before you know where you
are, he’s given him his sash! I hope you’re not going to say that that got about
because of me?’
His mother and sister were indignant.
‘That’s a fine example, isn’t it? It’s precisely because of that that he was beaten.
Now we know it must have been you who told.’
‘This is enough to drive a fellow mad!’ said Xue Pan, ‘It’s not so much the lies you
keep telling about me. What really gets my goat is the almighty fuss you make about
this fellow Bao-yu.’
‘Almighty fuss?’ said Bao-chai. ‘You’ve just been waving a door-bar at us, and you
say that we have been making a fuss?’
Xue Pan could see that Bao-chai had reason on her side and that she was much
harder to argue with than his mother. He was therefore eager to find something that
would stop her mouth, so that he could say what he wanted to without contradiction.
This, coupled with the fact that be was by now far too angry to weigh the seriousness
of what he was saying, was responsible for the unpardonable innuendo that
followed.
‘All right, sis,’ he said, ‘you don’t need to quarrel with me. I know what your trouble
is. Mamma told me long ago that Mr Right would be someone with a jade to match
your locket, so naturally, now you’ve seen that blasted thing that Bao-yu wears round
his neck, you do all you can to stick up for him.’
Anger at first made Bao-chai speechless; then, clinging to Aunt Xue, she burst into
tears.
‘Mamma, listen to what Pan is saying to me!’
Realizing, when he saw his sister’s tears, that he had gone too far, Xue Pan retired
sulkily to his own room and went to bed; Bao-chai was left bursting with injury and
outrage which she dared not express for fear of further upsetting her mother. She
was obliged to bid the latter a tearful goodnight and go back to her own room in the
Garden, where she spent the rest of the night weeping.
She was up early next morning. Too dispirited to make a proper toilet, she stopped
only to tidy herself a little before setting off for her mother’s. On the way she met, of
all people, Dai-yu, standing on her own beneath a flowering tree.
‘Where are you going?’ said Dai-yu.
‘To my mother’s.’ She answered without stopping.
Dai-yu noticed how dispirited she looked and saw that her eyes were swollen as if
she had been weeping.
‘Don’t make yourself ill, coz,’ she called out, almost glee?fully, to the retreating
back. ‘Even a cistern full of tears won’t heal the smart of a beating!’
The nature of Bao-chai’s reply will be revealed in the fol?lowing chapter.




CHAPTER 35

Sulky Silver tastes some lotus-leaf soup
And Golden Oriole knots a flower-patterned fringe

BAO-CHAI heard Dai-yu’s sarcasm quite clearly, but her mind was too taken up with
her own family affairs to pay much attention, and she continued on her way without
looking back.
As Dai-yu gazed towards the House of Green Delights, which was at some distance
from the flowering tree in whose shade she was standing, she presently observed Li
Wan, Ying-?chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun, attended by numerous maids, going into the
gate of its courtyard. Then, as she continued to watch, she saw them one by one
come out again and go their separate ways. It struck her that Xi-feng had not been
with them, and she wondered why.
‘It’s not like her not to visit him,’ she thought. ‘Even if she’s otherwise engaged,
you’d expect her to find some means of getting over and doing her little turn, if only
to keep in with Grandma and Auntie Wang. There must be some very press?ing
reason to keep her away.’
She lowered her head to reflect. Raising it again and looking once more in the
direction of Green Delights, she observed a colourful throng of females just about to
enter, and when she looked a little harder, she could make out Wang Xi-feng with
Grandmother Jia leaning on her arm. Lady Wang and Lady Xing walked behind them,
followed by Aunt Zhou and a large bevy of maids and women servants. As the last of
these disappeared inside the gate, Dai-yu nodded wistfully, thinking how good it
must be to have a family, and soon her face was once more wet with tears. Presently
she saw Aunt Xue and Bao-chai arrive. Not long after she had watched them enter
the gate, Nightingale suddenly walked up behind her.
‘Come and have your medicine, Miss,’ she said. ‘It’s cool enough to drink now.’
‘What’s the matter with you?’ said Dai-yu. ‘Always fussing! What does it matter to
you whether I take my medicine or not?’
Nightingale laughed good-humouredly.
‘Your cough’s only just beginning to get better, and already you want to stop taking
your medicine! It may be the fifth month and the weather may be hot, but all the
same, you still need to be careful. Come on, you’ve been standing quite long enough
in this early morning damp. You ought to come in now and rest a bit.’
Now that Nightingale’s words had recalled her attention to herself, Dai-yu became
aware that her legs were in fact rather tired. For a moment or two she appeared
rather bewildered, then, taking Nightingale’s arm, she slowly made her way back to
the Naiad’s House.
As they entered the courtyard, the chequered shadows of the bamboos and the
dew-pearled moss reminded her of two lines she had read in The Western Chamber:

             A place remote, where footsteps seldom pass,
             And dew still glistens on the untrodden grass.


‘It’s all very well,’ she thought, as she reflected oh the heroine of that play,
‘Ying-ying may have been unfortunate, but at least she had a widowed mother and a
little brother. I have no one.’
She was about to shed tears once more; but just then her parrot, which had been
perched aloft under the verandah eaves, seeing that his mistress had returned, flew
down with a sudden squawk that made her jump.
‘Wicked Polly!’ she said. ‘You’ve shaken dust all over my head!’
The parrot flew on to its perch.
‘Snowgoose!’ it called. ‘Raise the blind! Miss Lin is back!’
Dai-yu stooped in front of it and tapped its perch.
‘Did they remember your food and water, Polly?’
The parrot heaved a long sigh, uncannily like the ones that Dai-yu was wont to utter,
and recited, in its parroty voice:
             Let others laugh flower-burial to see:
             Another year who will be burying me?’

Dai-yu and Nightingale both burst out laughing.
‘It’s what you’re always reciting yourself, Miss,’ said Nightingale. ‘Fancy Polly being
able to remember it!’
Dai-yu made her take the perch down and hang it up outside the round
‘moon-window’ of her study.
Going indoors she sat down by the moon-window to take her medicine. Light
reflected from the bamboos outside passed through the gauze of the window to
make a green gloom within, lending a cold, aquarian look to the floor and the
surfaces of the furniture. To keep her spirits up in these somewhat cheerless
surroundings she spoke teasingly to the parrot hanging on the other side of the gauze
until he jumped and squawked on his perch, after which she taught him a few
snatches of her favourite poems.
At this point our narrative leaves her and returns to Bao-?chai.

*

When Bao-chai arrived at her mother’s apartment that morn?ing, she found her
mother still doing her hair. Aunt Xue greeted her daughter with a smile of surprise.
‘You’re very early this morning, my dear.’
‘I wanted to know how you were, Mamma. Did he come in again and give any more
trouble after I had left you last night?’
She sat down beside her mother and, in spite of herself, began to cry.
Aunt Xue, seeing her daughter’s tears, could not forbear shedding a few herself,
though she did her best to comfort her.
‘There, there, my child! Don’t be upset! I’ll deal with that wicked brother of yours,
you see if I don’t. I don’t want any?thing to happen to my girlie, do I? If anything
were to happen to her, I should have no one to turn to.’
Xue Pan, who had overheard, came running into the room at this point. Clasping his
hands together, he pumped them up and down, at the same time making sweeping
bows to right and left of him, in token of his contrition.
‘Forgive me, sis,’ he said. ‘I’d had too much to drink last night. I met a friend on my
way home. It was already quite late when I bumped into him, and I still hadn’t
sobered up properly when I got back here. I don’t know myself what it was I said, but
I know I must have talked a lot of silly non?sense. I’m not surprised you were angry
with me.’
The clumsiness of his apology rapidly turned Bao-chai’s weeping into laughter. Lifting
her face up from the handker?chief in which it had been buried, she made a little
grimace of derision.
‘There’s no need for you to put on this act,’ she said ‘I understand what your real
motive is perfectly well. You don’t like having us womenfolk around you and you are
looking for a means of getting rid of us, so that you can have the place here to
yourself.’
Xue Pan laughed deprecatingly.
‘I don’t know where you got that idea from, sis,’ he said. ‘It’s very unlike you to
make a snide remark like that.’
‘Snide remark?’ said Aunt Xue indignantly. ‘If that’s a “snide remark”, I don’t know
what sort of remarks you were making to your sister last night. I think you must have
taken leave of your senses!’
‘Now Mamma, don’t be angry,’ said Xue Pan, ‘and don’t you be upset, sis. Suppose I
were to tell you that from now on I’m going to give up drinking with the others
altogether, eh? What would you say to that?’
‘I’d say that you had come to your senses at last,’ said Bao?-chai.
‘And I’d say that the Heavenly Dragon had laid an egg,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘if you really
had the will-power to do it.’
‘All right then,’ said Xue Pan. ‘If you ever hear that I’ve been drinking with those
others again, sis, you can spit at me and you can call me a beast and a — and a —
worthless louse! Dammit, it’s too bad that the two of you should be worried all the
time because of me! It’s bad enough that I should make you angry, Mamma; but to
have poor little sis, too, worrying her heart out — oh, I really am a louse! I ought to
be extra good to you, Mamma, now that Father’s dead, and extra kind to sis; but
instead I make my own dear Mother angry and little sis upset. I’m not a beast, I’m
worse than a beast!’
And the great booby began to cry.
At this Aunt Xue, who had not been crying when he started, was herself becoming
upset, and Bao-chai was obliged to intervene with a brisk cheerfulness that she was
very far from feeling.
‘Haven’t you caused enough trouble already without making Mamma cry again?’
‘Who says I’ve been making Mamma cry?’ said Xue Pan, restraining his tears and
grinning back at her. ‘All right then, all right. Let’s drop the whole subject and say no
more about it. We’ll have Caltrop in and get her to pour you a nice cup of tea.’
‘I don t want any tea, thank you,’ said Bao-chai. ‘As soon as Mamma has washed, I
shall be going back into the Garden with her.’
‘Let me look at that-locket of yours,’ said Xue Pan. ‘I think it needs dipping again.’
‘Whatever for?’ said Bao-chai. ‘The gilding’s as bright as new.’
‘Isn’t it time you had a few more clothes?’ said Xue Pan.
‘Let me know what colours and what sort of patterns you want.’
‘I wouldn’t know what to do with them,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I haven’t yet worn all the
things I’ve got.’
Shortly after this exchange Aunt Xue re-emerged from changing her clothes and,
taking Bao-chai by the hand, went through into the Garden with her, leaving Xue Pan
to go off on his own.
Once in the Garden, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai made their way straight to Green
Delights. From the large number of maids and older women they found when they
got there waiting out?side on the verandah or in the ante-room inside, they knew
that Grandmother Jia and the other ladies must have arrived there before them.
They exchanged greetings with the latter on entering, after which they went over to
the couch on which Bao-yu lay, to inquire if he was feeling any better. Seeing Aunt
Xue, he attempted to raise himself a little.
‘Thank you,’ he said, ‘I am a little better. But what a lot of trouble I am causing! I
feel ashamed that you should have come over just to see me.’
Aunt Xue made him lie down again.
‘If there’s anything you want,’ she said, ‘do please let me know.’
‘I certainly shall,’ he said, ‘if I can think of anything.’
‘Is there anything you fancy to eat?’ said Lady Wang. ‘We can order it for you when
we go back presently.’
‘I can’t think of anything,’ said Bao-yu, ‘unless I did quite like that soup we had once
with the little lotus-leaves and lotus-pods in it.’
Xi-feng, who was standing by listening, gave a crow of laughter.
‘Listen to that, now! What low tastes the boy has! Whatever makes you want to eat
that leathery old stuff?’
‘Have it made, have it made!’ said Grandmother Jia vehemently. ‘Let the boy have
it by all means.’
‘Don’t be in such a hurry, Grannie!’ said Xi-feng laughing. ‘I’m trying to think who’s
got the moulds that they need for making the little shapes with.’
She turned and ordered one of the old women in attendance to go and ask the chief
cook; but though the old woman was a long time gone, she came back
empty-handed.
‘Cook says the four moulds for the soup-shapes were handed in some time ago on
your instructions.’
Xi-feng thought for a bit.
‘Yes, I remember now: I did get them back from her. But I can’t remember who I
gave them to. I should think the likeliest place for them to be is the tea-room.’
She sent someone to the tea-room stewardess; but she hadn’t got them either. In the
end they turned out to be with the plate stewardess, who looked after the gold and
silver. Aunt Xue was the first to examine them when they arrived.
There were four moulds fitted into a single box. They were made of silver, a foot or so
long and about an inch wide. Along the face of each mould were rows of very finely
cut dies, each about the size of a bean, thirty or forty on each mould. On one of the
moulds the dies were in the shape of chrysanthemums, on another of plum-flowers,
on the third of lotus pods and leaves, and on the remaining one of caltrops. Aunt Xue
turned to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang with amusement.
‘You people really do think of everything! All these patterns for a bowl of soup! If
you hadn’t told me, I should never have guessed what these things were for.’
Xi-feng answered her before either of the older ladies could reply.
‘You wouldn’t know about these anyway, Aunt. It’s some?thing they thought up last
year for Her Grace’s visit. They cut shapes with these things out of some special
dough — I’m not sure exactly what it’s made of — and put them in a clear soup.
There’s supposed to be a suggestion of autumn lotuses in the flavour, but it doesn’t
taste very much really. It’s certainly not the sort of thing you’d want to eat very often.
In fact, I think the only time we ever had it was when they made some for the visit.
I’m surprised he can still remember.’
She handed the moulds to an attendant woman-servant.
‘Tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other in?gredients as they’ll need to
make ten bowlfuls with. Say it’s wanted immediately.’
‘Why so much?’ said Lady Wang.
‘I have my reason,’ said Xi-feng. ‘This isn’t the sort of thing one eats every day, and
now that Cousin Bao has men?tioned it, it seems silly to make it just for him and not
let you and Grandma and Auntie Xue taste it as well. So while we are about it, we
might just as well do enough of it for everyone.’ She smiled mischievously. ‘I might
even have a taste of it myself.’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘Little monkey! We spoil you! Spending public money on private entertainment,
that’s what this is!’
The others all laughed. Xi-feng, quite unconcerned, joined in.
‘That’s no problem,’ she said. ‘I’m sure I can afford a little treat like this.’ She turned
to the waiting woman: ‘Tell the kitchen to use plenty of everything and charge it all
up to my account.’
The woman murmured a reply and went off to see about the order.
Bao-chai had been following these exchanges with amuse?ment.
‘Cousin Feng may be very artful,’ she said, ‘but I don’t believe that in all the years
I’ve been here I have ever seen her get the better of Lady Jia.’
‘I’m an old woman, my dear,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘What use would I have for
artfulness at my time of life? Mind you, when I was the age that Feng is now, I could
have taught her a thing or two. Still, though she may not be as sharp as I was then,
she doesn’t do so badly! A deal better than your Aunt Wang here, that’s certain. She
can’t talk to save her life, poor soul, no more than a woman of wood! She could
never get round me the way your Cousin Feng does. Fengie has the gift of a good
tongue, my dear. That’s why your old grannie is so fond of her.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘From what you say, Grandma, it sounds as if the good talkers are the only ones you
can be fond of.’
‘Oh no,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The silent ones have their merits, just as the good
talkers have theirs. Good talkers can be very tiresome at times and then I prefer the
silent ones.’
‘That’s all right then,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was going to say: my sister-in-law certainly isn’t
much of talker, yet I’m sure you are as fond of her as you are of Feng. If being a good
talker were the only thing that mattered, I should have thought that Cousin Feng and
Cousin Lin would be the only two in the family you would really care about.’
‘Well now, if we’re going to start comparing,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘I hope your
Aunt Xue won’t think I am only saying this because she is here, but really and truly I
do think that of all the girls in this family her Bao-chai is the one that I like the best.’
Aunt Xue laughingly demurred.
‘You mustn’t say that. I’m sure you can’t really mean it.’
‘No, no, I’m sure she does,’ Lady Wang hurriedly interposed. ‘I’ve often heard
Mother speak well of Bao-chai when you weren’t around.’
Bao-yu’s contribution to the conversation had been made with the intention of
encouraging Grandmother Jia to say something nice about Dai-yu. It came to him as a
surprise when she started praising Bao-chai instead. He looked at Bao?-chai and
grinned; but she turned quickly away and began talk?ing to Aroma.
Just then a servant came to say that lunch over at the man?sion was ready, and
Grandmother Jia rose to go. Having first exhorted Bao-yu to ‘hurry up and get better’
and then ad?monished his maids, she began to move out of the room not without a
polite attempt to make Aunt Xue go out ahead of her - leaning on Xi-feng’s arm.
‘Is that soup ready yet?’ she inquired when they were out of the room. Then,
turning to Aunt Xue, she asked her if there was anything she particularly fancied for
her lunch.
‘Mind you let me know if there is,’ she said. ‘I have the power to make Fengie treat
us to it.’
Aunt Xue laughed.
‘You shouldn’t tease the poor girl! She’s always getting nice things for you. But
you’re not much of an eater at the best of times.’
‘Don’t you believe it, Aunt!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Grannie knows how to tuck in. She’d have
eaten me by now if she weren’t afraid that she’d find me a bit too vinegary.’
This set them all off laughing. Even Bao-yu, in the inner room, had to join in, though
it hurt him to do so. Aroma, standing beside him, was helpless with mirth.
‘Mrs Lian really is a caution!’
Bao-yu took her hand and drew her down beside him.
‘Come!’ he said. ‘You must be tired. You’ve been on your feet for hours.’
‘Hey, you’ve forgotten!’ said Aroma. ‘While Miss Bao’s still in the courtyard, you
ought to ask her if she’ll let Oriole come over to do that knotting for you.’
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m glad you reminded me.’ He raised his head and shouted
towards the window.
‘Cousin Bao! If you can spare her, after you’ve had your lunch, would you mind
sending Oriole here to do some knotting for me?’
‘Yes, certainly,’ said Bao-chai, turning back to reply. ‘I’ll send her over presently.’
Grandmother Jia and the others had stopped to listen. Not having heard properly, the
old lady asked what it was, Bao?-chai explained.
‘Oh do, my dear!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Do let him have her to do the knotting I If
you need someone in her place, I have plenty of free hands in my apartment. Just
pick whichever of my maids you like to wait on you.’
Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were amused.
‘Let her go to him by all means,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but there certainly won’t be any
need of a stand-in. She has little enough to do but get up to mischief as it is.’
They had been walking on as they talked and presently came upon Xiang-yun,
Patience and Caltrop picking balsams beside an artificial ‘mountain’ of rock. Seeing
Grandmother Jia and the rest coming, they left off their flower gathering and came
forward to join them.
Soon the little party emerged from the Garden. Fearing that Grandmother Jia might
be fatigued, Lady Wang proposed that she should stop on the way back and sit down
for a while in her apartment. The old lady’s feet were indeed beginning to trouble
her and she nodded in consent. Lady Wang sent a maid on ahead to prepare for her
arrival.
Aunt Zhao was prudently avoiding Lady Wang for the time being by feigning sick, so
of the two concubines it was only Aunt Zhou who came out with the old
women-servants and maids of the apartment to welcome Grandmother Jia, holding
up the door blind for her to enter and arranging the pillows and back-rest for her on
the kang.
Moving up to it on Xi-feng’s arm, the old lady installed herself on the right-hand side
at the back with Aunt Xue in the guest’s position beside her. Bao-chai and Xiang-yun
sat nearer the edge of the kang on either side. Lady Wang served Grand?mother Jia
with tea, holding the cup ceremoniously in both her hands, and Li Wan in like
manner offered tea to Aunt Xue.
‘Let the younger women wait on us,’ said Grandmother Jia to Lady Wang. ‘You sit
down over there so that we can talk to you.’
Lady Wang obediently took a seat on a stool-chair beside the kang. She instructed
Xi-feng to be her deputy.
‘You can tell them to serve Grandmother’s lunch in here,’ she said to Xi-feng. ‘You
had better get them to add a dish or two.’
Having said that she would, Xi-feng went outside and in?structed a servant to take
word round to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The old women there passed on the
message in their turn, and soon a reinforcement of maids were hurrying on their way
to Lady Wang’s.
Lady Wang next gave instructions that the rest of the girls should be invited; but after
a long wait only Tan-chun and Xi-chun turned up. Ying-chun was unwell and did not
feel like eating. Dai-yu abstained so frequently — eating perhaps no more than five
meals in every ten — that her absence on this occasion was scarcely noticed.
Soon lunch arrived and the servants brought up a low table and set it down on the
kang. Xi-feng stood on the floor below, a bundle of ivory chopsticks wrapped up in a
tea-towel in her hand.
‘Now, Grannie and Auntie,’ she said, ‘I hope you are going to do as you’re told and
not stand on ceremony!’
Grandmother Jia looked at Aunt Xue and smiled.
‘Shall we do as she says and stay put?’
‘Yes, certainly,’ said Aunt Xue, smiling back, whereupon Xi-feng proceeded to lay for
them where they sat: two pairs of chopsticks on the far side for Grandmother Jia and
Aunt Xue, one pair at either end for Bao-chai and Xiang-yun. Lady Wang and Li Wan
stood on the floor below and supervised the serv?ing of the dishes, while Xi-feng
called for a set of clean things for one more person and went, chopsticks in hand,
from dish to dish, making a selection from them for Bao-yu.
A few minutes later the lotus-leaf soup arrived and was presented to Grandmother
Jia for her inspection. Lady Wang, glancing quickly round her, noticed Silver standing
near at hand and ordered her to carry a bowl of it to Bao-yu together with the other
things that Xi-feng had just put out for him; but Xi-feng objected that there was too
much for one person to carry. Just then Oriole and Providence chanced to enter, and
Bao-chai, knowing that they had already had their lunch, suggested that Oriole
should help with the carrying.
‘Master Bao has been asking if you could go over there to do some knotting for
him,’ she told Oriole, ‘You might as well go with her and do it now.’
‘Yes, Miss,’ said Oriole, and went off with Silver, carrying her share of the bowls.
‘They’re terribly hot,’ she said, when they were alone together. ‘How are we going
to carry them so far?’
‘Don’t worry!’ said Silver, ‘I know just the answer.’
She made one of the old women fetch a covered lacquer carrying-box. The bowls of
soup, rice and so forth fitted into it easily. She told the old woman to follow them.
She and Oriole then sauntered along empty-handed in the direction of Green
Delights, while the old woman trotted along behind them carrying everything. When
they reached the gate of the courtyard, Silver took the box from her and the two girls
went on into the house alone.
They found Aroma, Musk and Ripple in the inner room, enjoying a joke with Bao-yu.
The three of them got up, still laughing, when they saw Silver and Oriole enter, and
Aroma, supposing that they had come from their respective apart?ments, remarked,
as she relieved Silver of the box, on the coincidence of their arriving simultaneously.
Having handed over the box, Silver plumped herself down on a stool-chair; but Oriole
was less bold; and even when Aroma offered her a foot-stool to sit on, she still
refused to be seated.
Bao-yu was naturally very pleased to see Oriole; but the sight of Silver, reminding him,
with a pang of mingled shame and sorrow, of her sister Golden, impelled him to
ignore Oriole and concentrate his attention on the other girl. Aroma noticed this
neglect and was afraid that Oriole might be offended. Partly for this reason and
partly because Oriole looked so uncomfortable standing up, but was evidently
determined not to sit down in Bao-yu’s presence, she took her by the hand and drew
her into the adjoining room for a cup of tea and a chat.
Meanwhile in the inner room Musk and Ripple had laid out the bowls and chopsticks
and were waiting in readiness to serve Bao-yu his lunch; but Bao-yu was still
occupied with Silver and seemed in no hurry to begin.
‘How is your mother?’ he asked her.
The girl sat silent, with a sullen, angry look on her face. When, with a muttered ‘all
right’, she did at last answer him, she averted her eyes and would not look at him.
Bao-yu was very much put out, but did his best to be pleasant.
‘Who told you to bring this for me?’
‘Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian. Who do you think?’
Bao-yu could see the misery in her face and knew that it was because of Golden that
she looked like that. He wished he could humble himself before her, but the presence
of the other maids inhibited him. He had to think of some way of getting rid of them.
Having succeeded at last in doing so, he began, as soon as they were out of the room,
to exercise all his charm upon Silver. At first she tried to ignore the questions with
which he plied her; but he was so patient and persistent, meet?ing her unyielding
stiffness with such warmth and gentleness, that in the end her heart misgave her and
a faintly pleased expression began to steal over her face. Bao-yu judged the time ripe
to entreat her smilingly for his lunch.
‘Fetch me that soup will you, there’s a dear. I’d like to try it now.’
‘I can’t feed other people,’ said Silver. ‘I never could. You’ll have to wait till the
others come back.’
‘I’m not asking you to feed me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m just asking you to get it for me
because I can’t walk. Once you’ve done that you can go back and tell them you’ve
finished your errand and get on with your own lunch. I don’t want to keep you from
your food: you’re probably starving. However, if you don’t even feel up to passing me
a bowl of soup, I’ll just have to put up with the pain and get it myself.’
He tried to rise from his bed, but the effort cost him a cry of pain. Unable to hold out
any longer when she saw the state he was in, Silver jumped to her feet.
‘All right. Lie down, lie down!’ she said. ‘ “Past sin, present suffering.” You’ve got
your retribution without having to wait for it, so you needn’t expect me to feel sorry
for you!’
She broke into a sudden peal of laughter and fetched him the soup.
‘Silver dear,’ said Bao-yu, ‘if you still feel angry with me, get it over with now. Try to
look pleasanter when you are with Their Ladyships. You mustn’t look angry all the
time when you are with them, or you’ll be getting yourself into trouble.’
‘Go on, get on with your soup!’ said Silver. ‘Keep the sugary stuff for other people. I
know all about it!’
Bao-yu drank a couple of mouthfuls of the soup at her in?sistence, but artfully
pretended not to like it.
‘It doesn’t taste nice.’
‘Doesn’t taste nice?’ said Silver with an expression of extreme disgust. ‘Holy Name!
if that doesn’t taste nice, I’d like to know what does!’
‘It’s got no flavour,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Taste it yourself, if you don’t believe me.’
Silver to prove him wrong indignantly raised the spoon to her lips and tasted.
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Ah, now it’ll taste all right!’
Silver realized that he had deliberately tricked her into drinking from the same bowl.
‘You wouldn’t drink it a moment ago,’ she said, ‘so now you shan’t have any even if
you say you want it.’
And though Bao-yu laughingly begged and pleaded, she refused to let him have it
back and called in the other maids to give him the rest of his meal no sooner had
they come in, however, than it was announced that ‘two old nannies from Mr Fu’s’
had arrived ‘to call on Master Bao’.
Bao-yu knew that the ‘Mr Fu’ referred to must be one Fu Shi, an Assistant
Sub-Prefect who had started life as one of Jia Zheng’s protégé’s and made his way up
in the world largely by trading on Jia Zheng’s reputation. Jia Zheng thought highly of
him, regarding him as the brightest of the various young fellows he had patronized,
and Fu Shi for his part was assiduous in sending message and compliments to the
man?sion in order to keep up the connection.
Now if there were two sorts of people Bao-yu could not at any rice abide they were
stupid old women and pushing young men. It may therefore seem strange that these
two old nannies sent by the egregious Fu Shi should have been ac?corded instant
admission to his sickroom. The reason was that Bao-yu’ had heard that Fu Shi had a
younger sister called Fu Qiu-fang, who, though

        a virgin-pearl, still chambered from men’s sight,

was commonly said to be both beautiful and talented. Bao-yu had not actually seen
her; hut he had formed a picture of her in his imagination and worshipped her from
afar. And since to have refused entry to the two old women would have been in his
eyes tantamount to offering Qiu-fang an affront, he at once gave orders for them to
be admitted.
Qiu-fang was, as a matter of fact, a girl of passable good looks and more than average
intelligence. Her brother had entertained hopes of trading on these assets in order to
ally himself matrimonially with some powerful or aristocratic family — an ambition
which had hitherto led him to look frowningly on lesser offers, with the result that, at
the relatively great age of twenty-two, Qiu-fang remained unbetrothed. For the fact
of the matter was that the powerful and aristocratic families with whom he sought
alliance looked on Fu Shi as an impoverished pen-pusher deficient in both breeding
and refinement and showed not the slightest inclination to want his sister as a
daughter-in-law. However, Fu Shi went on cultivating his intimacy with the Jia family
and was still not without hopes of realizing his ambition in that direction.
It so happened that the two old nannies sent to see Bao-yu on this occasion were
exceptionally ignorant old women. Hearing that they were to be admitted, they came
into the room, delivered themselves of the sentence or two it took to inquire after
his health, and thereafter lapsed into a stupid silence.
With the arrival of strangers, Silver had been obliged to drop the bantering tone she
had begun to adopt with Bao-yu and stood, holding the soup-bowl in both her hands,
listening in silence. It was left to Bao-yu to make what conversation he could with the
women as he continued to eat his lunch. While so engaged, he reached out a hand
for the soup, and Silver reciprocated mechanically; but as both of them had their
eyes on the visitors, their uncoordinated movements resulted in a brief collision. The
bowl was upset and hot soup spilled over Bao-yu’s hand. Silver, startled, though
herself unhurt, gave a nervous laugh.
‘Now look what you’ve done!’
The other maids rushed forward to retrieve the bowl. Bao-yu, insensitive to his own
pain, inquired anxiously after Silver.
‘Where did you scald yourself? Does it hurt?’
Silver and the rest all laughed.
‘You’re the one who’s been scalded,’ said Silver. ‘Why ask me?’
Only then did Bao-yu become conscious that his own hand had been burned. The
maids hurriedly mopped up. Not wishing to continue his meal after this, he washed
his hands, drank some tea, and spoke a little longer with the old women, who then
took their leave and were seen through the Garden as far as the bridge by Skybright
and some of the other maids.
When they found themselves alone, ‘the two old women began discussing the visit
with each other as they went along.
‘Well, I’ve heard people say that this Bao-yu is like a bad fruit - good to look at but
rotten inside,’ said one of them, ‘and I must say I’m not surprised. He certainly does
seem a bit simple. Fancy scalding his own hand and then asking someone else where
it hurt! He must be a simpleton! Heh! heh! heh!’
‘He really and truly is a bit simple,’ said the other one. ‘A number of them told me
about it when I came here last. Once when he was out in the pouring rain and
himself as wet as a drowned chicken, he says to someone, “It’s raining,” he says, “run
inside and get out of the rain.” What a laugh! Heh! heh! heh! And he often cries or
laughs when no one else is by. They say that when he sees a swallow he talks to the
swallow, and when he sees a fish in the river he talks to the fish, and when he sees
the stars or the moon, he sighs and groans and mutters away to himself like a crazy
thing. And he’s as soft as a baby. Even the little maids can do what they like with him.
If he’s in the mood for saving, he’ll make a fuss over a piece of thread; but other
times they an smash things worth a fortune and he won’t mind a bit.’
Still talking, they passed out of the gate of the Garden, at which point our narrative
leaves them.
*

Back at Green Delights, Aroma, seeing that the others had now gone, led Oriole into
Bao-yu’s room to ask what it was that he wanted done. Bao-yu gave Oriole a smile.
‘I’m sorry, I was busy talking just now,’ he said. ‘I’m afraid I neglected you. The
reason I’ve dragged you here is because I want you to do some knotting for me.’
‘What’s it for?’ said Oriole.
‘Never mind that,’ said Bao-yu airily. ‘Do me some of every kind.’
Oriole clapped her hands and laughed.
‘Goodness me! That would take me about ten year!’
‘My dear young lady,’ said Bao-yu pleasantly, ‘you have all the time in the world at
your disposal. I’m sure you could manage in less time than that.’
‘Not in one sitting, at all events,’ said Aroma. ‘Better choose two or three of the
main types and let her do one of each.’
‘If you’re talking about types,’ said Oriole, ‘there are really only three: fan tassels,
rosary-nets and net-and-tassel fringes for sashes.’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu, ‘a sash-fringe.’
‘What colour’s the sash?’ said Oriole.
‘Crimson.’
‘Black or navy-blue would go well with crimson,’ said Oriole. ‘With anything lighter
the crimson would be too overpowering.’
‘What goes with viridian?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Peach pink.’
‘Mm. That sounds very colourful, certainly. What about something colourful but a
bit more on the quiet side?’
‘What about leek-green and greenish-yellow?’ said Oriole. ‘That’s a very tasteful
combination.’
‘All right, you make me those three then one black, one peach-pink and one
leek-green.’
‘What pattern do you want for the netting?’ said Oriole.
‘What patterns are there?’ said Bao-yu.
‘There’s stick-pattern, ladder-pattern, diamond, double diamond, linked rings,
flower-pattern, willow-leaf...’
‘What was the pattern of that netting you did the other day for Tan-chun?’
‘Ah, that was a flower-pattern with filled-in centres.’
‘I’d like it in that pattern.’
Aroma had meanwhile left them to fetch the silks. As she came back with them, an
old woman called through the win?dow to say that her lunch was ready.
‘Off with you then,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and come back as soon as you have finished.’
‘How can I possibly leave with a guest here in the room said Aroma.
‘Don’t be ridiculous! ’ said Oriole. ‘You go and have your lunch.’
Aroma smiled at that and tripped off, leaving the two of them alone together, except
for two very junior maids who were to remain at hand in case they were wanted.
Bao-yu lay and watched Oriole knotting, chatting to her in a desultory way as he
watched.
‘How old are you?’ he asked her.
Oriole replied without raising her head from her work.
‘Fourteen.’
‘What’s your surname?’
‘Huang.’
‘Huang? That means “yellow”. It goes well with your name. They say “yellow oriole”,
don’t they? — “yellow oriole”, “golden oriole”.’
‘My name was “Golden Oriole” originally,’ said Oriole, ‘but Miss Bao found it too
much of a mouthful, so she called me just “Oriole” for short, and now everyone else
does.’
‘Miss Bao must be very fond of you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I expect later on when she gets
married she’ll want to take you with her.’
Oriole pulled a face and laughed.
‘I’ve often said to Aroma,’ Bao-yu went on, ‘whoever gets you and your mistress
will be a lucky man.’
‘She’s a good person, is our Miss Bao,’ said Oriole, ‘much more than you realize.
There are things about her you don’t find in many people in this world — more
important things than good looks — though she’s good-looking too, of course.’
Oriole’s mellifluous, lilting voice and the simple, artless way in which she talked and
laughed had powerfully affected Bao-yu. It increased his pleasure to hear her
speaking in this way now about her mistress.
‘What things?’ he asked her eagerly. ‘Tell me about them.’
‘If I do,’ said Oriole, ‘you mustn’t let her know that I to you.’
‘Of course not.’
They were interrupted at this point by a voice from the outer room.
‘You’re very quiet in there!’
As the two of them simultaneously turned to look, it was Bao-chai herself who
stepped into the room. Bao-yu at once invited her to take a seat. When she had done
so, she inquired what Oriole was making and leaned forward to inspect it. The first of
the three sash-ends was already half completed.
‘What do you want to make a thing like that for?’ she asked. ‘Why don’t you make
him a necklet to wear with his jade?’
Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly. He had intended to ask Oriole to do this for
him in the first place, but had for?gotten.
‘Clever coz! What a good thing you mentioned it! I’d quite forgotten. But what
would be the right colour for it?’
‘Let’s see,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The brighter colours definitely wouldn’t do. Crimson
would clash. Yellow wouldn’t be a sufficient contrast. Black would be too heavy. I’ll
tell you what. If you were to take a gold thread and a very fine black bugle-thread
and twist them together — that would look nice.’
Bao-yu was delighted with the suggestion, and shouted several times for Aroma to
fetch the gold thread. She came in while he was still shouting for her, carrying two
plates of food and looking puzzled.
‘I can’t understand it,’ she said. ‘Someone’s just brought me these from Her
Ladyship.’
‘Oh, I expect they had more than they wanted there, so she’s sent you this to share
with the others,’ said Bao-yu.
‘No,’ said Aroma. ‘They said it was for me personally; but I’m not to go over and
kotow for it. I don’t know what to make of it.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘If it’s for you to eat, I should go ahead and eat it! Never mind the whys and
wherefores!’
‘But it never happened before,’ said Aroma. ‘I feel so embarrassed.’
Bao-chai’s lips puckered up mockingly.
‘Embarrassed? Before very long you’re going to have much more than this to feel
embarrassed about!’
Aroma sensed something behind this remark. She knew Bao-chai too well to suppose
that any such remark of hers would be made triflingly. Remembering what Lady
Wang had seemed to hint at in her interview of the previous day, she dropped the
subject.
‘I’ll have these now then,’ she said, holding the dishes out for Bao-yu to inspect,
‘and as soon as I’ve washed, I shall bring you your gold thread.’
With that she hurried out again.
When she returned later, after having lunched and washed her hands, bringing the
gold thread for Oriole’s knotting, Bao-chai was no longer there, since she had been
called away by Xue Pan’s messenger.
Bao-yu once more lay back and watched Oriole knotting; but soon they were
interrupted once more, this time by a couple of maids from Lady Xing’s. They brought
two sorts of fruit and a message for him from their mistress.
‘Her Ladyship says are you able to walk? She says if you are, she’d like you to come
over some time and amuse your?self. She says tell him I’m thinking of him.’
‘Tell her,’ Bao-yu replied politely, ‘that as soon as I can walk, I shall certainly be
round to pay my respects. Tell her that the pain is a little better than it was and that
she is not to worry.’
Asking the two girls to be seated, he called Ripple to him and asked her to take half of
the fruit they had brought and offer it to Dai-yu; but just as she was about to go,
Dai-yu could be heard talking in the courtyard. He told Ripple to hurry outside and
invite her in.

CHAPTER 36

Bao-chai visits Green Delights and hears strange words from
a sleeper
Bao-yu visits Pear-tree Court and learns hard facts from
a performer
WHEN Grandmother Jia got back to her own apartment after lunching with Lady
Wang, she was naturally very pleased to have seen Bao-yu making such rapid
progress; but her pleasure soon gave way to worry when she began wondering what
would happen when he was well enough for Jia Zheng to start asking for him again.
To guard against that contin?gency she had Jia Zheng’s Head Boy brought before her
to receive instructions direct from her own mouth.
‘In future,’ she told him, ‘whenever the Master is entertain?ing guests or seeing
anybody and asks for Bao-yu, you are to say, straight away, without needing to see
me about it, first of all that Master Bao was very seriously injured by his beating and
will need several months’ complete rest before he can walk properly; and secondly
that he has just made an offering to his star-guardian because of an unlucky
conjunction in his horo?scope and isn’t allowed to see outsiders or go outside the
inner gate until the beginning of the eighth month.’
She called Nannie Li and Aroma to her as soon as the Head Boy had gone and
instructed them to tell Bao-yu this, so that no worries should retard the progress of
his recovery.
Bao-yu had always hated meeting or making conversation with senior males of the
scholar-official class and detested all occasions which involved dressing up, such as
visits of congratulation and condolence and the various other formal ex?changes to
which members of that class devote so great a part of their time. His grandmother’s
dispensation was therefore particularly gratifying to him, and he used it as an excuse
for cutting himself off from all contact with visiting relations and friends. He even
pleased himself about whether or not he made the customary morning and evening
duty-calls on the senior members of the household. Each day was spent playing or
resting in the Garden, and during the whole of the day, except for the brief period in
the early morning when he went outside to visit his mother and grandmother, he
was the will?ing captive of his maids and did for them whatever little ser?vices it
pleased them to command. In such enjoyable indolence several weeks slipped
agreeably by. From time to time, as opportunity presented itself, someone like
Bao-chai would attempt to remonstrate with him; but her remonstrances would be
indignantly rejected.
‘Why should a pure, sweet girl like you want to go imitating that ghastly crew of
thievish, place-hunting career worms,’ he would say, ‘bothering her head about
“fame” and “reputa?tion” and all that sort of rubbish? All these notions you are
parroting were dreamed up by meddlesome old men in days gone by for the express
purpose of leading astray the whis?kered idiots who came after them. I really think
it’s too bad that I should have to live in an age when the minds of nice, sensible girls
are contaminated by such idiocies. It’s a tank abuse of the intellectual gifts that you
were born with!’
Hearing him talk so wildly, the remonstrators concluded that he was slightly mad,
and eventually gave up trying to be serious with him. The exception was Dai-yu, who,
ever since they were little children together, had never once spoken to him about the
need to ‘get on in the world’ or ‘make a name for oneself’. This was one of the
reasons why he so much respected her.

*

But to return to our narrative.
Some time after Golden’s death, Xi-feng began receiving presents and courtesy calls
from various senior members of the domestic staff. Though she could not for the
moment guess what lay behind these flattering attentions, her sus?picions were
aroused, and one day, in the course of which she had once more received presents
from these people, she laugh?ingly questioned Patience on the subject when they
were alone together in the evening.
‘I’m surprised you haven’t guessed that!’ said Patience a little scornfully. ‘I think, if
you were to look into it, you’d find that all of these people had daughters working for
Her Lady?ship. There are four senior maids on Her Ladyship’s establish?ment who
each get one tael a month, the rest only get a few hundred cash each; and now that
Golden’s dead, one of the tael-a-month places is vacant. I expect these people are
trying to get it for their own daughters.’
‘Of course!’ said Xi-feng, much amused. ‘Of course! I’m sure you are right. Well, I do
think it rather greedy of them. They earn quite good money as it is, they don’t have
any really hard work to do, and they’ve got daughters to bring them in a little extra
income. I think for them to want to get this plum for themselves as well is really a bit
too much. I wouldn’t have thought they could afford to keep sending me presents
like this. Still, that’s their concern! If they want to go on giving me presents, I shall go
on taking them. But I shall still do what I was going to do anyway. It won’t make any
difference to me.’
In pursuance of this policy she kept the servants waiting for a decision and watched
the presents accumulate; then, when no more seemed to be forthcoming, she
availed herself of the first opportunity to raise the matter with Lady Wang. This
occurred one day about noon when Aunt Xue, Bao-chai and Dai-yu were in Lady
Wang’s apartment sharing a water-melon with her. Xi-feng tackled Lady Wang while
they sat eating the melon.
‘You’ve been short of a maid, Aunt, since Silver’s sister died,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Have you
anyone in mind to replace her with? You might let us know if you have, so that we
know what to do with next month’s allowance.’
Lady Wang thought for a bit.
‘Do I have to have four maids or five maids or whatever it is?’ she asked. ‘It seems
to me that if the maids I’ve got are adequate, I might as well do without the other
one.’
Xi-feng smiled.
‘In principle, of course, you are right, Aunt; but we have got fixed rules about these
things, and when some people at the bottom of the scale are making a great fuss
about keeping their number up, it wouldn’t do to have you cutting yours down. In
any case, the saving would only be one tael a month: it would hardly be worth
making.’
Lady Wang again reflected for some moments.
‘Very well,’ she said at last, you can go on paying the allowance as before, but you
needn’t find me another maid. Silver shall have it. Her sister gave me a lot of service
before she was so unfortunate, poor child. I don’t think it would be excessive to give
Silver a double allowance, for her sister’s sake.’
After promising to see that this was done, Xi-feng turned smilingly to Silver and
congratulated her. Silver hurried for?ward and kotowed in gratitude to Lady Wang.
‘That reminds me,’ said Lady Wang: ‘what allowance do Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou
get each month?’
‘The fixed amount is two taels each a month,’ said Xi-feng, but Aunt Zhao gets an
additional two taels for Huan, so she really gets four taels. Then on top of that they
each get two strings of cash a month for their maids.’
‘Do they get the full amount every month?’ said Lady Wang.
Xi-feng was somewhat taken aback.
‘Of course. Why not?’ she replied, a trifle sharply.
‘It’s just that I thought I heard someone the other day com?plaining that they were
a string of cash short,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I wonder how that could have happened?’
Xi-feng smiled disarmingly.
‘The allowance for Aunt Zhao’s and Aunt Zhou’s maids used to be one string each a
month, but last year Accounts reduced it by a half to five hundred cash. Aunt Zhao
and Aunt Zhou are allowed two maids each, so that means they now get one string a
month less than they used to. This is something completely outside my control. I’d be
only too happy to pay them more if I could, but the cut was made by Accounts, and
all I can do is to hand out what I am given. It’s not my de?cision. In fact, I’ve raised
the matter once or twice with them and told them they ought to go back to the
original payment, but all they’ll say is that that’s what’s been decided and nothing
can be done about it. Actually, now that I do the paying, people do at least get their
allowances on time. In the old days, when Accounts made the payments direct, we
were always having trouble. Never a month went by without some one getting into
debt because they hadn’t been paid on time.’ Another silence followed in which Lady
Wang was evi?dently thinking.
‘How many of Lady Jia’s maids get one tael a month?’ she asked eventually.
‘Seven—well, eight really, if you count Aroma.’
‘Yes, I see,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Bao-yu wouldn’t have any tael-a-month maids of his
own, of course. Aroma still counts as one of Lady Jia’s maids.’
‘Oh yes. Aroma is still Grandma’s maid,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Grandma lets Bao-yu employ
her, but her pay still comes out of Grandma’s allowance. It would be quite out of the
question to cut her pay simply because she’s working for Bao-yu. If you wanted to do
that, you’d first have to find another maid for Grandma. And even then, of course, if
you wanted her to be paid as a member of Bao-yu’s establishment, to make it fair
you’d really need to give Huan another maid, too. Incidentally, the fact that Bao-yu’s
senior maids like Skybright and Musk get a string of cash a month and the juniors like
Melilot five hundred is due to Grandma’s own personal instructions; so I don’t think
anyone is really in a position to make a fuss about that.’
Aunt Xue laughed.
‘Listening to Feng is like listening to a load of walnuts being emptied out of a cart -
all those facts and figures! And everything accounted for — everything just and fair!’
‘I trust none of the facts and figures were wrong, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng.
‘No, no, nothing wrong with the facts and figures,’ said Aunt Xue pleasantly. ‘It’s
just that you would save yourself some energy by taking them a little more slowly.’
Xi-feng seemed about to laugh, but checked herself to hear what her other aunt had
to say. Lady Wang, however, de?liberated for some little while longer before making
her pro?nouncement.
‘Find someone to wait on Lady Jia in place of Aroma,’ she said eventually, ‘and stop
paying Aroma out of Lady Jia’s allowance. Instead you can pay her two taels and a
string of cash a month out of my personal allowance of twenty taels. And in future,
whatever arrangements are made about Aunt Zhao’s and Aunt Zhou’s allowances, I
want you to pay Aroma at exactly the same rate only whatever it is, it’s all to come
out of my personal allowance. I don’t want Accounts getting mixed up in this.’
Having promised to carry out these instructions, Xi-feng turned to Aunt Xue and
nudged her playfully.
‘There you are! What did I tell you? It’s turned out exactly as I said.’
‘And so it should,’ said Aunt Xue warmly. ‘It should have been done long ago. She’s
a lovely girl — and it isn’t only her looks I’m referring to, either. She has such a
generous, open way of doing things, and she is so polite and friendly to talk to.
There’s a strong little will there, though — plenty of deter?mination underneath it
all. Oh, I think she’s a real treasure.’
‘She is a dear, good child,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I don’t think the rest of you realize just
how good she is. Ten times better than my Bao-yu, that’s quite certain. If Bao-yu can
keep her with him always, he’ll he a very lucky boy.’
‘If you think that, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng, ‘why not have her plucked and painted and
make her his chamber-wife openly?’
‘No, it wouldn’t do,’ said Lady Wang. ‘First of all he is too young; secondly Sir Zheng
would never agree to it; and in the third place, even if we allow a certain amount of
freedom between them, as long as he still thinks of her as his maid, there is some
chance that he will listen to what she says, but once we make her his chamber-wife,
she will feel less free to tell him what she thinks of him when he is being silly. No, I
think for the moment at any rate we should leave it a little vague. We can make a
more definite arrangement in two or three years’ time.’
After pausing long enough to ascertain that Lady Wang had nothing more to say,
Xi-feng turned and went. A group of stewards’ wives were waiting for her under the
eaves in the narrow alley-way at the back to report to her on various household
matters. They smiled at her as she emerged, and one of them chaffed her about the
length of her visit.
‘You’ve been a long time today, Madam. What can you have been talking about to
keep you so long? I hope you haven’t overheated yourself with so much talking!’
Xi-feng stood in the doorway in a very unladylike attitude, one foot on the threshold,
rolling her sleeves back and smiling at no one in particular.
‘There’s a nice little draught out here. I think I’ll stand here for a bit and cool off.’
She turned to the women.
‘Did you say I’ve been a long time? It’s hardly surprising. Today Her Ladyship has
been asking about just about every?thing that’s happened here during the past two
hundred years.’ Her voice lost its jocular tone and became suddenly harsher. ‘From
now on if I ever feel like doing something really spite?ful, I shall do it. Let her
complain to Her Ladyship if she has a mind to, I don’t care. Stupid woman! Stupid,
chicken-witted, evil-tongued, snivelling, misbegotten whore! She ought to wake up.
One of these days they’ll make a dean sweep and take the whole lot away — then
she’ll have something to shout about! Complain about me, would she, because her
maid’s allowance has been cut? Who the Holy Name does she think she is? She’s only
a bit of bought goods herself. What’s the likes of her doing with maids to wait on her
any way?’
Leaving the stewardesses to make what they would of this explosion, she strode off
to look for someone suitable to take a message in to Grandmother Jia.
At which point we leave her.

*

After Aunt Xue and the two girls had finished their water?melon, they sat talking for
a few minutes longer with Lady Wang before leaving, Aunt Xue to return to her own
apart?ment, Bao-chai and Dai-yu to go back into the Garden. Bao?-chai invited
Dai-yu to accompany her to the Lotus Pavilion to pay a call on Xi-chun, but Dai-yu
said she was going to have a bath, and presently parted company with Bao-chai,
leaving her to continue on her way there alone. Bao-chai’s route took her past the
House of Green Delights, and as she drew near it, she thought she would call in to
chat for a while with Bao-yu and help him to dispel the sleepiness of the early
afternoon.
The courtyard was silent as she entered it. Not a bird’s cheep was to be heard. Even
the storks were asleep, hunched up in the shadow of the plantains. Keeping to the
relative cool?ness of the covered walk, she made her way round to the house. In the
outer room maids were lying about in all directions asleep. Slipping behind the tall
mirror and through the elaborately carved partition, she passed into the inner room
where Bao-yu lay inside his protective summer ‘cabinet’ of net. He, too, was fast
asleep. Aroma sat at his bedside sewing, a white horse-hair fly-whisk with a handle of
white rhinoceros-horn at her side. Bao-chai entered the ‘cabinet’ and laughed softly
at Aroma.
‘Aren’t you being rather over-cautious?’ she whispered. ‘What’s the fly-whisk for?
Surely no flies or mosquitoes can get in here?’
Aroma looked up, startled, hurriedly put down her sewing, and rose to her feet.
‘Oh, it’s Miss Bao! I wasn’t expecting you,’ she whispered. ‘You gave me quite a
shock - no, we don’t get any flies or mosquitoes in here, but there’s a little tiny insect
that finds its way through the holes in the netting. They’re so small, you don’t notice
them; but when you’re asleep they can give you a nasty bite - a bit like an ant-bite.’
‘That’s not surprising,’ said Bao-chai. ‘You’ve got water behind you here, you see;
you’ve also got a lot of sweet?-smelling flowers outside; and indoors is perfumed as
well. This kind of insect breeds in the insides of flowers and is attracted towards
anything fragrant. That’s why you get them inside the house.’
While she was speaking, her eye fell on the sewing that Aroma had just put down. It
was a pinafore of the kind children wear, with bib and apron in one. It was of white
satin lined with red silk, and the pattern Aroma was em?broidering on it was one of
mandarin ducks disporting themselves in a background of lotuses. The ducks were in
rainbow colours, and the lotuses had red flowers and green leaves.
‘Goodness, how beautiful!’ she exclaimed. ‘Who’s it for? It must be someone very
special, to deserve work as fine as this.’
Aroma turned her head and shot her lips out in the direction of the figure sleeping on
the bed.
‘Him? He’s too big to wear that sort of thing, surely?’
‘He wouldn’t wear them to start with. That’s why I try to make them so nicely—so
that when he sees them he can’t resist putting them on. I try to get him to wear
them in this hot weather, so that if he uncovers himself in his sleep, there’s no risk of
his getting chilled. If you think there’s a1ot of work in this one, you ought to see the
one he’s wearing!’
‘I wonder you can have the patience,’ said Bao-chai.
‘I’ve done such a lot of work on it today,’ said Aroma, ‘my neck is quite stiff from
bending over.’ She smiled at Bao-chai entreatingly: ‘Do us a favour, Miss: sit here a bit
in my place, will you, while I go off and stretch my legs? I’ll be back directly.’
Saying this, she slipped quietly out, not waiting for a reply. So intent was Bao-chai on
the embroidery that she sank down almost without realizing what she was doing into
the place that Aroma had just vacated. It really was a most beauti?ful piece of work;
in fact, she found it irresistible, and taking up the needle, began sewing it where
Aroma had left off.
Meanwhile Dai-yu, on her way back to have a bath, had run into Xiang-yun and
agreed to the latter’s proposal that they should together call on Aroma to
congratulate her on her promotion. They arrived in the courtyard of Green Delights
to find everything plunged in silence. Xiang-yun went round to the side to see if
Aroma was in any of the maids’ rooms. Dai-yu went up to the main building and
peeped through the gauze window into Bao-yu’s bedroom. She saw Bao-yu, clothed
in little else but a thin, rose-coloured shirt, sprawled out asleep on the bed and
Bao-chai sitting beside him sewing, with a fly-whisk in readiness at her side.
For some moments she goggled incredulously at this touch?ing domestic scene, then,
fearful of disturbing it, she tore herself away to stifle her mounting giggles. When she
had some?what subdued them, she beckoned to Xiang-yun to come over and look.
Wondering what extraordinary spectacle could have put her in such a state,
Xiang-yun hurried over for a peep. She, too, found the scene inside a comical one
and would have burst out laughing; but in her case it was the consideration that
Bao-chai had always been so kind to her that caused her to control her mirth. And
knowing how merciless Dai-yu could be with her witticisms, she took her by the hand
and dragged her away, explaining as she did so that she had just remembered that
Aroma had said something about going at noon to wash some clothes in the lake.
‘I’m sure that’s where she will be,’ she said to Dai-yu. ‘Let’s go and look for her
there.’
Dai-yu was not in the least deceived, and showed as much by her sardonic laugh. But
she followed her nonetheless.
Bao-chai meanwhile continued her sewing undisturbed. She had just completed her
second, or maybe it was her third petal, when Bao-yu, who appeared to be dreaming,
cried out angrily in his sleep.
‘Why should I believe what those old monks and Taoists say? I don’t believe in the
marriage of gold and jade. I believe in the marriage of stone and flower.’
The words astounded her. She had still not recovered from the shock of hearing them
when Aroma returned.
‘What, isn’t he awake yet?’
Bao-chai shook her head.
‘I just now ran into Miss Lin and Miss Shi,’ said Aroma. ‘I suppose they didn’t come
in here, did they?’
‘Not that I know of,’ said Bao-chai. She glanced up at Aroma with a sly smile: ‘Did
they tell you anything?’
Aroma coloured.
‘Oh, a lot of nonsense - as usual! They were only joking, though.’
‘They weren’t joking,’ said Bao-chai, ‘- not this time. I was going to tell you myself,
but you went rushing off before I had a chance to.’
Just at that moment a maid arrived from Xi-feng summon?ing Aroma to go and see
her.
‘There you are!’ said Bao-chai. ‘That’ll be what she wants to see you about.’
Aroma had to arouse two of the sleeping maids to take her place in the inner room;
then she and Bao-chai left Green Delights together. They parted company outside,
and Aroma went off to Xi-feng’s place on her own. When she got there she was, as
Bao-chai had predicted, formally acquainted with the new arrangements concerning
her pay and status that had just been made for her by Lady Wang. She was told that
she should go over to Lady Wang’s to kotow her thanks, but that there was no need
for her to see Grandmother Jia.
She found this interview with Xi-feng acutely embarrassing. By the time she got back
from Lady Wang’s, Bao-yu was already awake. She answered him evasively when he
asked her where she had been and waited for the silence and darkness of the night
to tell him of her unofficial promotion to his bed. Bao-yu was delighted.
‘I hope there’ll be no more talk of leaving me now!’ he said, smiling broadly at her.
‘Do you remember the time when you got back from visiting your family and tried to
frighten me with all that talk about your brother wanting to buy you out of service
and how there was no future for you here and no point in your staying permanently,
and all those other heartless, unkind things you said? I’d like to see anyone trying to
take you away from me now!’
‘Huh!’ Aroma sniffed scornfully. ‘That’s not at all the way it is. I belong to Her
Ladyship now. Now if I want to leave you, I don’t have to talk to you about it at all. All
I have to do is have a word with Her Ladyship, and off I go!’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Suppose I were at fault and you told Her Ladyship and asked her to let you go;
don’t you think you’d feel just a tiny bit uncomfortable afterwards when it got about
that you had left me because I wasn’t good enough for you?
‘Why ever should I?’ said Aroma. ‘Of course, I wouldn’t go if it meant marrying a
thief or a murderer. There’s always another way out. I could always take my own life.
We all have to die some time or other; it’s just a question of when. All you’ve got to
do is stop breathing, that’s all. After that you hear nothing, see nothing - it’s all over!’
‘Stop it, now! Stop it!’ said Bao-yu, covering her mouth with his hand. ‘You don’t
have to say things like that.’
All too familiar with the peculiarities of this master who condemned flattering
‘auspicious’ talk as false and hollow, but was upset and morose if you told him the
truth, Aroma regret?ted her blunder in having too openly spoken her mind.
Smil?ingly she turned the conversation on to topics which experience taught her
were agreeable to him: the beauties of Nature, the beauties of girls, girls. But
somehow from there the conversation imperceptibly found its way round to the
subject of girls dying. Suddenly realizing this, Aroma — it was she who was talking at
the time — broke off in alarm. Bao-yu, who up to that point had been listening to her
enthralled, laughed at her sudden silence.
‘We all have to die, as you said yourself just now. The prob?lem is how to die well.
Those whiskered idiots who take quite literally the old saw that “a scholar dies
protesting and a soldier dies fighting” and get themselves killed off on the
assumption that those are the only two ways in which a man of spirit can die
gloriously, would do better to die in their beds. For when you come to think of it, the
only real occasion for protesting is when one’s ruler is misguided, and the only real
occasion for fighting is when one’s country is at war. If the scholar is so greedy for
martyrdom that he throws away his life at the earliest opportunity, what is to
become of the poor misguided ruler in the absence of good advisers? And if the
soldier so hankers for a hero’s death that he gets himself killed off in the first
encounter, what is to become of his country without soldiers to fight its battles—?’
‘But surely,’ Aroma interrupted, ‘those famous men in the olden days laid their lives
down because they had to?’
‘Nonsense!’ said Bao-yu. ‘The soldiers among them lacked generalship; as a
consequence, they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on. They threw
their lives away out of sheer incompetence. Do you call that dying because they had
to? And the scholars were even worse. On the strength of having read a couple of
books and got up a text or two by heart, they began to cry stinking fish as soon as
they found the smallest thing at Court not as they thought it should be, in the hope
of winning themselves an imperishable reputation for honesty; then, if the Court
didn’t immediately change its policy, they would work themselves into a passion and
promptly get themselves killed. You won’t, surely, say that they died because they
had to? What you have to remember is that Emperors hold their power from Heaven,
and it’s un?thinkable that Heaven should lay the huge responsibility of empire on any
but the worthiest shoulders. So you can see that all those death-with-honour
characters you have so high an opinion of were thinking only of their own personal
fame and glory. They weren’t really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at
all.
‘Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me;
then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away
on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently
decompose there until the wind had picked my bones clean, and after that never,
never to be reborn again as a human being—that would be a really good death.’
‘I’m sleepy,’ said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit
was on him again. And Bao-yu at once closed his eyes and fell fast asleep.
By next morning the subject appeared to have been quite forgotten.

*

A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Garden’s possibilities, and
its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on
his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his
appetite for more. Having recently been told that the best singer among the twelve
little actresses of Pear Tree Court was the soubrette called Charmante, he resolved,
for a change of scene, to go over there and look her up, so that he could ask her to
sing him some of the arias from it.
The only girls he recognized when he arrived there were Tresor and Topaze, who
greeted him with smiles and invited him to be seated. When he asked where
Charmante was, the girls all answered him in chorus:
‘In her room.’
Bao-yu at once went to the room indicated. Charmante was in there on her own. She
was lying stretched out on her bed, but made no attempt to get up when she saw
him enter. Nothing daunted, he sat himself down beside her and, in the familiar way
he habitually adopted with girls, smilingly re?quested her to sing the section from
the Return that begins with the words

                  In these quiet courts the floating gossamer...

But Charmante did not respond in the expected manner. She rose up quickly and
drew away from him when he sat down beside her; and in answer to his request to
sing, she informed him, with a cold, unsmiling expression, that she was ‘not invoice’.
‘I strained my voice the other day at a command perform?ance for Her Grace,’ she
said. ‘I am still resting it.’
She was sitting opposite him as she said this, so that he had a full view of her face.
He remembered now, as he studied it, where he had seen that face before. She was
the girl he had seen scratching QIANS on the ground that day under the rose pergola.
And now here she was behaving as if his very presence was distasteful to her. Never
in his life before had he experienced such instant rejection. Reduced to mumbling
incoherence by his embarrassment, he coloured, and — since there was ob?viously
no point in staying — left the room.
Surprised to see him come out again so soon, the others asked him the reason.
Trésor laughed when he told her what had happened.
‘Wait until Mr Qiang gets back,’ she said. ‘If he asks her to, she’ll sing for you.’
Bao-yu did not know quite what to make of this.
‘Qiang?’ he said. ‘Where is he, anyway?’
‘He went out only a few minutes ago,’ said Trésor. ‘I expect Charmante said she
wanted something and he’s gone out to try and get it for her.’
Bao-yu seemed to find this of enormous interest and decided to stay a little longer
and see what happened. Sure enough, Jia Qiang presently returned from his
expedition. He was carry?ing a bird-cage with a bird inside. The cage had a miniature
stage fastened to the top of it. Jia Qiang was on his way inside to look for Charmante,
obviously feeling very pleased with himself, when he caught sight of Bao-yu and
halted.
‘What’s that bird you’ve got there?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘It’s a whitecap,’ said Jia Qiang, smiling proudly. ‘It can hold a flag in its beak and do
a little turn on the stage.’
‘How much did you pay for it?’
‘One tael and sixteen pennyweights of silver.’
He invited Bao-yu to be seated while he went into Charmante’s room to show off his
purchase; but Bao-yu, whose desire to hear Charmante sing was now quite forgotten
in his eagerness to find out exactly how things lay between her and Jia Qiang, joined
the girls as they clustered round the door-way to watch.
‘Look! Look what I’ve brought for you,’ said Jia Qiang, full of smiles.
‘What is it?’
Charmante had been lying down again, but sat up when he entered.
‘I’ve got a little bird to keep you company, to stop you get?ting so depressed. You
watch! I’ll make him perform for you.’
He took a few grains from his pocket and coaxed the bird out on to the stage, where
it picked up a diminutive mask and flag and hopped and pirouetted about like an
actor playing the warrior’s part in a play. The girls all laughed delightedly and said it
was ‘sweet’. All except Charmante. She merely gave a scornful ‘huh!’ or two and lay
back on the bed again in dis?gust.
Jia Qiang smiled — almost beseechingly.
‘How do you like it?’
‘You and your family!’ said Charmante bitterly. ‘It isn’t enough to take decent girls
from their homes and shut them up in this prison to learn beastly opera all day. Now
you have to bring a bird along to do it as well. I suppose it’s to keep me reminded of
my misery. And you have the audacity to ask me “do I like it?”!’
Her words appeared to make Jia Qiang quite frantic, for he uttered a string of the
most violent and passionate oaths in reply.
‘I’m a stupid fool and I should have known better,’ he said. ‘I spent all that money
on the thing because I thought it might cheer you up. It never occurred to me that
you might take it like this. Well, let the thing go then! It’s an “act of merit” to free
living creatures, so at least you’ll get some good from it. Either it will help you in the
next life or free you from sickness in this one.’
With that he released the bird, which promptly flew away, and stamped on the cage
until it was smashed to pieces.
‘Maybe birds aren’t as important as human beings,’ said Charmante, ‘but they have
mothers and fathers just the same. Can’t you see how cruel it is to take them away
from their nests and make them perform for people’s amusement? I coughed up two
mouthfuls of blood today. Her Ladyship sent someone to look for you. She wanted
you to get me a doctor so that we could find out what to do, but instead of a doctor
you bring this thing back with you, to make a mock of me. It’s just my luck to fall ill
when I’ve got no one to care for me or take any notice.’
She began to cry.
‘But I asked the doctor about you yesterday evening and he said it wasn’t serious,’
Jia Qiang protested. ‘He said you were to take a couple of doses of that medicine and
he’d come and look at you again in two days’ time. I’d no idea that you’d been
spitting blood. Well, I’d better go and get him straight away.’
He began to go, but Charmante called him back.
‘Stay where you are! Don’t go rushing off in this burning heat. You’re only going to
fetch him because you’re in a temper, anyway. I wouldn’t see him now if he came!’
Hearing her say this, Jia Qiang halted.
Bao-yu had been watching this scene with open-mouthed fascination. At last he
understood the real meaning of all those QIANGS. There was obviously no place for
him here, so he slipped away. Jia Qiang was so absorbed in his concern for
Charmante that he did not even notice him go and it was left to the little actresses to
see him out.
It was a reflective, self-critical Bao-yu who made his way back to Green Delights, so
bemused that he scarcely noticed where he was going. When he arrived, Dai-yu and
Aroma were sitting in conversation together. He looked at Aroma and sighed heavily.
‘What I told you the other night was wrong,’ he said. ‘I’m not surprised that Father
tells me I have a “small capacity but a great self-conceit”. I mean, that stuff about all
of you making a river of tears for me when I die: I realize now that it’s not possible. I
realize now that we each have our own allotted share of tears and must be content
with what we’ve got.’
Aroma was surprised to hear him bring this up again. She had assumed that what he
said that night was in jest and must long since have been forgotten. She laughed.
‘You know, sometimes I think you really are a bit touched!’
Bao-yu was silent.
From the curious way in which he was behaving Dai-yu could see that something had
got into him, but judged it not her business to inquire what. To change the subject
she asked him about something of a more practical nature.
‘When I was with your Mother just now she told me that it is Mrs Xue’s birthday
tomorrow. She told me to ask you whether you intend going or not. When you’ve
decided, she’d like you to send someone round and let her know.’
‘Well, I didn’t go last time, when it was Uncle She’s birth?day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It will
be a bit awkward if I go this time and run into someone from Uncle She’s. I think I’d
better stop going to birthdays altogether. In any case, it’s terribly hot, and I should
have to dress up for it. And I don’t think Auntie would really mind if I didn’t go.’
‘That’s no way to talk!’ said Aroma. ‘There’s no compari?son whatever between Sir
She and your Aunt Xue. You’re no distance away from her, for a start. And she is your
Mother’s sister. I’m sure if you didn’t go she’d wonder what was the matter. If you’re
afraid of the heat, why don’t you go first thing in the morning, when it’s still cool? All
you need do is make your kotow and drink a cup of tea, and then you can come back
again. Surely that would be more civil?’
‘Of course you must go!’ said Dai-yu, before he had time to reply. ‘Surely you owe a
visit to the person who saved you from the mosquitoes?’
‘What mosquitoes?’ said Bao-yu, mystified. ‘What are you talking about?’
Aroma proceeded to tell him how Bao-chai had sat at his bedside with a fly-whisk
beside her while he slept.
‘How frightful!’ Bao-yu was most upset. ‘However did I come to be asleep when
she was there? And I’d got hardly anything on. How disgusting of me!’
After that there was no further question, of course. He would definitely be going over
for his Aunt Xue’s birthday on the morrow.
While the three of them were talking, Xiang-yun came in wearing her going-out
clothes and looking very dressed-up. Her uncle the Marquis’s people had arrived to
fetch her, and she had come to say good-bye. Bao-yu and Dai-yu both rose and
invited her to be seated, but she could not stay, so the two of them accompanied her
through to the front.
Xiang-yun was struggling to hold back her tears, for she dared not show her distress
openly in front of her uncle’s people. The arrival a few moments later of her dear
Bao-chai, who had hurried over specially to see her off, made going back seem even
more unbearable. Fortunately Bao-chai, always more perceptive than the others,
realized that things would become even more difficult for Xiang-yun if the servants
who had come to collect her were to tell her aunt when they got back that she had
made a fuss, so she did all she could to hasten her departure.
The two girls and Bao-yu saw Xiang-yun as far as the inner gate. Bao-yu would have
gone further, but Xiang-yun re?strained him. Nevertheless, when she had gone a
little way towards her carriage, she changed her mind and, turning back, called him
to her so that she could whisper a parting request in his ear.
‘Remind Her Old Ladyship of me from time to time, will you, in case she forgets?
Then perhaps she’ll send someone to invite me over again.’
Bao-yu gave vigorous assurances that he would do this for her, then, when they had
seen her get into her carriage, they all turned and went in again.
As to what followed, that must be looked for in the follow?ing chapter.
CHAPTER 37

A happy inspiration prompts Tan-chun to found the
Crab-flower Club
And an ingenious arrangement enables Bao-chai to settle the
chrysanthemum poem titles



THIS year Jia Zheng was appointed Commissioner for Edu?cation in one of the
provinces, with instructions to leave for his tour of duty on the twentieth of the
eighth month. When the day for his departure arrived, he took leave of his ancestors
in the family shrine, kotowed to his mother, and was seen on his way as far as the
hostelry of the ‘Tearful Parting’ (the first post-halt on his journey) by Bao-yu and
other junior male members of the clan.
Jia Zheng’s doings after his departure are not recorded in this history; we merely
observe that the departure left Bao-yu free to play and idle in the Garden to his
heart’s content witout the least fear of restraint or reprisal.

The days in idleness passed by
To swell the tale of wasted years

On the day of which we write Bao-yu was feeling very bored. He had returned from
perfunctory morning calls on his mother and grandmother and had just finished
changing back into his everyday clothes, when Tan-chun’s maid Ebony arrived
carrying a carefully-folded letter from her mistress.
‘I’m glad you’ve come,’ said Bao-yu, as she handed him the letter. ‘I’d been meaning
to see your mistress this morning, but I forgot. How is she? Is she any better?’
‘She’s quite better, thank you,’ said Ebony. ‘She’s stopped taking her medicine today.
It was only a slight chill that she was suffering from.’
Bao-yu unfolded the elegant patterned notepaper and glanced at the contents:
Dear Brother,
Some nights ago, when the moon came out in a sky freshly clear after the rain, the
garden seemed veritably awash with moonlight, and sleep in the face of so rare a
spectacle was unthinkable. Thrice the clepsydra had been turned, and still I lingered
beneath the tall paulownias, reluctant to go in. But in the end the treacherous night
air betrayed me, and by morning I was lamentably indisposed.
How kind of you to have visited me in my sickroom! and how exquisitely thoughtful
to have sent your maid-servant shortly after?wards with solicitous inquiries and with
those delicious lychees and the calligraphy by Yan Zhen-qing!
While I have been lying here quietly on my own, I have been thinking how in the
olden days even men whose lives were spent amidst the burly-burly of public affairs
would keep some quiet retreat for themselves with its tiny corner of mountain and
trickle of running water; and how they would seek, by whatever arts and
blandishments they knew of, to assemble there a little group of kindred spirits to
share in their enjoyment of it; and how, on the basis of such leisure-time associations,
rhymers’ guilds and poetry clubs were then founded, so that the fleeting inspirations
of an idle hour might often be perpetuated in imperishable masterpieces of verse.
Now although I am no poet myself, I am privileged to live ‘midst rocks and streams’
and in the company of such gifted practitioners of the poetic art as Xue and Lin; and
it seems to me a great pity that the romantic courts and pavilions of our Garden
should not echo with the jocund carousal of assembled bards, and its flowering
groves and blossoming banksides not become places of wine and song. Why should
the founding of poetry clubs be the sole preroga?tive of the whiskered male, and
female versificators allowed a voice in the tunable concert of the muses only when
some enlightened patriarch sees fit to invite them?
Will you come, then, and rhyme with us? The pathway to my door is swept to receive
you and your arrival is eagerly awaited by
                                                         Your affectionate Sister,
                                                                        Tan-chun

When Bao-yu had finished reading, he clapped his hands delightedly.
‘Dear Tan-chun! Bless her poetic soul! I must go and dis?cuss this with her straight
away.’
He strode off immediately, with Ebony following at his heels. But he had got no
further than Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when he saw one of the old nannies on
duty at the back gate of the Garden hurrying from the opposite direction with a note
in her hand. She came up to him when she saw who he was and handed him the
note.
‘From Mr Yun, sir. He’s waiting at the back gate. He sends his compliments and says
would I please give you this.’
Bao-yu opened it and read.

Dear Father,
I have the Honour to present my Humble Duty and hope this finds you as it leaves me
in the Best of health, ever since you did me the great Kindness to recognize me as
your Son I have been looking for some means of showing my appreciation of your
great kindness but so far no opportunity has presented itself, to date. However,
thanks to your esteemed Advice I have got to know several Nur?serymen also a
number of famous gardens and now through this contacts I have come across a very
rare Variety of autumn crab flower (Pure White) only very little to be had, but using
every means possible I have got two pots of it I hope you will think of me as a real
Son and not refuse to keep them for your enjoyment. However, owing to the present
Hot Weather I did not like to call in Person as the Young Ladies are outside in the
Garden a lot owing to the heat, and not wishing to give Inconvenience
I remain,
       Honoured Father,
Your Dutifully and Affected Son,
                          Jia Yun

Bao-yu laughed when he had finished reading it.
‘Is he alone?’ he asked the old woman, ‘or is there someone with him?’
‘He’s got a couple of young chaps with him carrying potted plants.’
‘I see. Well go back and thank him for me. Tell him it’s very kind of him and I very
much appreciate it. And have the pots taken to my room.’
When he had given these instructions, he continued with Ebony on his way to
Autumn Studio. He arrived to find that Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Ying-chun and Xi-chun had
all got there before him. They laughed excitedly when they saw him enter.
‘Here comes another one!’
‘I hadn’t realized that I was so popular!’ said Tan-chun. ‘I wrote to you all more or
less on the spur of the moment. It was no more than a tentative suggestion. I had no
idea it would meet with this instant response from everybody.’
‘It’s a pity you didn’t think of it earlier,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We ought to have started a
club long ago.’
‘Well I don’t think it’s a pity,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Do, by all means, have a poetry club if
you’re all so keen to, only count me out of it, please. I don’t feel up to it.’
Ying-chun laughed.
‘If you’re not, then what about the rest of us?’
‘This is no time for false modesty,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Here is a serious proposition and
one which we are obviously all enthu?siastic about. What we need are some ideas
that we can all discuss. Come on, Chai! Let’s hear what you have got to say first, then
perhaps we can hear from Cousin Lin.’
‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bao-chai. ‘We’re not even all here yet.’
Just as she was saying that, Li Wan arrived. She smiled at them all as she entered.
‘My! What a poetic lot we are! If you are going to have a poetry club, may I
propose myself for president? The idea of having one did in fact occur to me earlier
in the year, but I thought that as I can’t write poetry myself, a proposal coming from
me might seem a bit presumptuous, and I did nothing about it. Now that my poetical
sister-in-law has had the same idea, I should like to do what I can to help her get it
started.’
‘If we are definitely going to have a poetry club,’ said Dai-yu, ‘then as members of
the club we are all equals and fellow-poets. We can’t go on calling ourselves “cousin”
and “sister-in-law” all the time;’
‘I quite agree,’ said Li Wan. ‘We ought to choose pen?names to sign our poems
with, then we can use them for addressing each other by as well. I shall call myself
“Farmer Sweet-rice”. I don’t suppose anyone else will want that title.’
‘I shall call myself “Autumn Studio”,’ said Tan-chun.
‘That’s pretty unoriginal!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Can’t you do any better than that? You’ve
got all those paulownias and plantain-trees around your place: can’t you make a
name out of them?’
‘All right,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I’m very fond of my plantains. I shall call myself “Under
the Plantains”.’
‘That’s very original,’ said the others admiringly. But Dai-yu laughed.
‘Come on, everybody!’ she said. ‘Pop her in the stew-pot! We’ll have a nice piece of
venison with our wine.’
As no one could understand this recondite joke, Dai-yu undertook to explain it for
them.
“Under the plantains” is where the woodcutter in the old Taoist parable hid the
deer he had killed; so the allusion means “a deer”. In calling herself by that
pen-name, Cousin Tan is therefore offering herself to her fellow-members as venison
for them to feast on in their carousals.’
‘Oh, all right, Miss Clever！’ said Tan-chun. “   ‘Plantain Lover”, then. You wait! I’
ll be even with you yet. I’ve got just the name for her,’ she told the others. ‘When
the Emperor Shun died, his two queens are supposed to have gone along the banks
of the river Xiang looking for him. According to the legend, the two queens turned
into river goddesses and their tears became the spots you find on the bamboos that
grow along the banks of the river. That’s why there’s a kind of bamboo called “Naiad’s
Tears”. Well now, Cousin Dai lives in the Naiad’s House, and she cries so much that I
shouldn’t be at all surprised if one of these days the bamboos in her courtyard all
turned out to have spots on them; so I think the best pen-name for her would be
“River Queen”.’
The others, applauding, agreed that this was exactly the tight name for Dai-yu. Dai-yu
herself hung her head and said nothing.
‘I’ve thought of one for Bao-chai,’ said Li Wan. ‘Not regal, like Dai-yu’s, but
aristocratic, at any rate. What do you all think of “Lady All-spice”?’
‘I think the title becomes her very well,’ said Tan-chun.
‘What about me?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Isn’t anyone going to think of a name for me?’
‘Oh, you!’ said Bao-chai. ‘The obvious one for you is “Busybody” — because you
are always so busy doing nothing.’
‘Why not stick to your old pen-name, “Lord of the Flowers”?’ said Li Wan.
‘Do you have to embarrass me by reminding me of my youthful indiscretions?’ said
Bao-yu.
‘No, let me choose your name,’ said Bao-chai, ‘Actually I’ve already thought of one.
It sounds a bit common, perhaps, but I think it suits you. You are a very lucky person,
living in such luxurious and beautiful surroundings and you enjoy an exceptional
amount of leisure—in fact, I can’t think of anyone who combines quite so much luck
with quite so much leisure—so I suggest “Lucky Lounger” as the most suitable
pen-name for you.’
Bao-yu laughed good-humouredly.
‘You are flattering me! I think you’d better all call me by whatever name each of
you fancies.’
‘No, that won’t do,’ said Dai-yu. ‘As you live in the House of Green Delights, why
don’t we simply call you “Green Boy”?’
‘Yes,’ said the others. ‘Good.’
‘Now, what names are we going to have for Cousin Ying and Cousin Xi?’ said Li
Wan.
‘Neither of us is much good at poetry,’ said Ying-chun. ‘There doesn’t seem much
point in having any.’
‘No, I think you ought to have pen-names,’ said Tan-chun.
‘As Ying-chun lives on Amaryllis Eyot, she could be “Amaryllis Islander”, and as
Xi-chun lives by the Lotus Pavilion, she could be “Lotus Dweller”,’ said Bao-chai. ‘That
would seem to be the simplest solution.’
‘Yes,’ said Li Wan. ‘Those names will do very nicely. Now, I’m the eldest here, so I’m
going to propose some conditions that I’d like you all to agree to. I don’t think you’ll
have much difficulty in doing so when you’ve heard what they are. The first one is
that as three out of the seven of us founding this club—that’s to say Cousin Ying,
Cousin Xi and myself—are no good at writing poetry, I propose that the rest of you
should let us off versifying and allow us to act as your officers instead.’
‘“Cousin Ying”? “Cousin Xi”?’ said Tan-chun. ‘What’s the good of inventing all these
new names if you’re not going to use them? I think that from now on there ought to
be a penalty for not using them.’
‘First things first,’ said Li Wan. ‘Let’s get the club properly founded, and we can talk
about penalties later on. I suggest that the club should hold its meetings at my place,
because I’ve got the most room. I can’t write poetry myself, but if you don’t object to
having so illiterate a person as your host, I’m sure that as time goes by I shall grow
more poetical and re?fined under your influence.
‘My next condition is that you should make me your presi?dent. And as I shan’t be
able to manage all the official business on my own, I should like to be allowed to
co-opt two vice-presidents. I therefore nominate Amaryllis Islander and Lotus
Dweller as my assistants, one to set the themes and rhymes in our competitions and
the other to act as invigilator and copyist.
‘And lastly, although we three officers don’t have to do any versifying, we should
not be precluded from trying our hand at it if we want to. So if there is ever a fairly
simple subject with easy rhymes and we feel like joining in, we should be allowed to
do so. The rest of you, of course, have no option.
‘Well, those are my conditions. If you agree to them, I’ll be glad to help you found
the club. If not, I don’t think there would really be much point in my tagging along.’
The proposed arrangement was highly agreeable to Ying-?chun and Xi-chun, neither
of whom had much enthusiasm for writing poetry—least of all in competition with
experts like Bao-chai and Dai-yu—and they assented readily. The rest, when they saw
how willingly Ying-chun and Xi-chun acquiesced, felt that they could scarcely object
themselves and added their assent— though Tan-chun did remark, somewhat
ruefully, that it seemed a little hard, when she was the one who had thought of the
idea in the first place, that she should now have these other three sitting in
judgement over her.
‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s all settled. Let’s all move over to Sweet-rice Village,
then.’
‘You’re always in such a hurry!’ said Li Wan. ‘Today’s meeting is just a preliminary
discussion. Now you will have to wait for me to issue an invitation.’
‘Before we do anything else,’ said Bao-chai, ‘we had better decide how often we
are going to meet.’
‘Not too often, I hope,’ said Tan-chun, ‘otherwise it will no longer be a pleasure. I
suggest not more than two or three times a month.’
‘Twice a month will be quite enough,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Once we’ve decided which
two days to meet on, we should under-take always to turn up on those two days, wet
or fine. At the same time, we should be allowed to arrange additional meet?ings
outside the fixed dates as and when the fancy takes any of us to do so. If we leave it
that much flexible, it will be more enjoyable.’
The others agreed that this was a good proposal and should be adopted.
‘The poetry club was originally my idea,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I hope you will at least
allow me the pleasure of being your hostess at its first meeting.’
‘All right,’ said Li Wan. ‘We’ll have a meeting tomorrow and you shall entertain us,’
Why wait until tomorrow?’ said Tan-chun. ‘There’s no time like the present. You
choose a title for us, Amaryllis Islander can set the rhymes, and Lotus Dweller can
supervise us while we compose our poems.’
‘If you ask me,’ said Ying-chun, ‘I think that rather than always have the same two
people to choose the titles and set the rhymes, it would be better to draw lots.’
‘As I was on my way here just now,’ said Li Wan, ‘I saw them carrying in two pots of
white crab-blossom. It was so pretty. Couldn’t you have white crab-blossom for your
sub?ject?’
‘We haven’t all seen it yet,’ said Ying-chun. ‘How are they going to write poems
about it if they haven’t seen it?’
‘We all know what white crab-blossom looks like,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t see why
we necessarily have to look at it in order to be able to write a poem about it. The
ancients used a poetic theme as a vehicle for whatever feelings they happened to
want to express at that particular moment. If they’d waited until they’d seen the
objects they were supposed to be writing about, the poems would never have got
written!’
‘Very well, then, I’ll set your rhymes,’ said Ying-chun.
She took a book of verse off the shelf, opened it at random, and held it up for the
others to see.
‘There you are: an octet in Regulated Verse. That’s the form.’
She closed the book again and turned to a little maid who was leaning in the
doorway looking on.
‘Give us a word,’ she said. ‘Any word.’
‘Door,’ said the girl.
‘That means the first line must end with “door”,’ said Ying-chun. She turned again
to the girl: ‘Another one.’
‘Pot,’ said the girl.
‘Right, “pot”,’ said Ying-chun, and going over to a little nest of drawers in which
rhyme-cards were kept, she pulled out one of them and asked the maid to select two
cards from it at random. These turned out to be the cards for ‘not’ and ‘spot’.
‘Now,’ she said to the girl, ‘pick any card out of any drawer. Just one.’
The girl pulled out another drawer and picked out the card for ‘day’.
‘All right,’ said Ying-chun. ‘That means that your first line must end in “door”, your
second in “pot”, your fourth in “not”, your sixth in “spot”, and the rhyming couplet in
the seventh and eighth lines must end in “day”.’
Tan-chun’s maid Scribe laid out four identical sets of brushes and paper for the
competitors, who all, except Dai-yu, now began, with quiet concentration, to
consider what they were going to write. Dai-yu wandered around outside, playing
with the bark of the paulownia trees, admiring the signs of autumn in the garden,
occasionally joking with the maids, and in general not giving the slightest indication
that she was engaged in the throes of composition. Ying-chun told one of the maids
to light a stick of Sweet Dreams—a kind of incense which is only about three inches
long and has a very thick wick so that it burns down fairly rapidly - and told the
competitors that they had to complete their poems by the time the incense had
burned itself out, otherwise they would be penalized.
Tan-chun soon had a poem ready. Taking up a brush, she wrote it out and, after going
over it and making a few cor?rections, handed it in to Ying-chun. Then she turned to
Bao-chai.
‘How are you doing, Lady All-spice? Have you thought of a poem yet?’
‘Well—yes, I’ve thought of something,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I’m not very happy about
it.’
Bao-yu, meanwhile, was pacing up and down, hands clasped behind his back, in the
loggia outside. Hearing this exchange, he paused to address Dai-yu.
‘Do you hear that?’ he said. ‘The other two have nearly finished.’
‘Kindly mind your own business, would you?’ said Dai-yu. Bao-yu glanced inside
and saw that Bao-chai was busy writ?ing her poem down.
‘Lord!’ he said. ‘There’s only an inch left.’ He turned to Dai-yu again: ‘The incense
has nearly burned out. What are you still squatting over there on the damp grass
for?’
Dai-yu ignored him.
‘Oh well,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I haven’t got time to worry about you. I’ll have to start
writing my own now, whether it’s any good or not.’
He went in then, and sat down at the table to write.
‘I’m going to start reading the poems now,’ said Li Wan. ‘Anyone who hasn’t handed
in by the time I’ve finished read?ing will have to pay a fine.’
‘Farmer Sweet-rice may not be much good at writing poetry,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but she
is jolly good at reading it. She’s a very fair critic. I’m sure we shall all be willing to
accept her judgement.’ The others nodded in agreement. Li Wan picked up
Tan-?chun’s draft and the others crowded round to read it with her:

             A wintry sunset gilds the vine-wreathed door
             Where stands, mossed by old rains, the flower-pot.
             Its snowy blooms, as snow impermanent,
             Are pure as pure white jade that alters not.
             O fragrant frailty, that so fears the wind!
             Most radiant whiteness! Pull moon without spot!
             White flower-sprite, shake your silken wings! Away!
             And join with me to hymn the dying day!

All complimented Tan-chun on her poem when they had finished reading it. Then
they looked at Bao-chai’s:

             Guard the sweet scent behind closed courtyard door,
             And with prompt waterings dew the mossy pot!
             The carmine hue their summer sisters wore
             These snowy autumn blossoms envy not—
             Pot beauty in plain whiteness best appears,
             And only in white jade is found no spot.
             Chaste, lovely flowers! Silent, they seem to pray
             To autumn’s White God at the close of day.

Li Wan smiled.
‘That has the All-spice touch all right!’ Next they looked at Bao-yu’s poem.

             White Autumn’s sister stands beside the door;
             Like summer snow her blossoms till the pot—
             A Yang-fei rising naked from the bath,
             With a cool, chaste allure that she had not.
             The dawn wind could not dry those pearly tears
             With which night’s rain each floweret’s eye did spot.
             Pensive and grave, her blossoms gently sway,
             While a sad flute laments the dying day!

When they had finished reading, Bao-yu said he liked Tan-?chun’s poem best of the
three, but Li Wan insisted that Bao?-chai’s was superior. It had ‘more character’ she
said. She was about to press Dai-yu for her contribution when Dai-yu sauntered in of
her own volition.
‘Oh! have you all finished?’
She picked up a brush and proceeded, writing rapidly and without a pause, to set
down the poem that was already com?pleted in her mind. She wrote on the first
sheet of paper that came to hand and, having finished, threw it nonchalantly across
the table for the others to inspect.

             Beside the half-raised blind, the half-closed door,
             Crushed ice for earth and white jade for the pot,

They had got no further than the first couplet, when Bao-yu broke out into praises.
‘Clever! How do you get these ideas?’

             Three parts of whiteness from the pear-tree stolen,
             One part from plum for scent (which pear has not)—

All of them were impressed by this second couplet.
‘This is good. Original. It’s quite different from the other three.’
            Moon-maidens stitched them with white silken thread,
            And virgins’ tears the new-made flowers did spot,
            Which now, like bashful maids that no word say,
            Lean languid on the breeze at close of day.


‘Yes, this is the best,’ they said. ‘This is the best of the four.’
‘For elegance and originally, yes,’ said Li Wan; ‘but for character and depth I prefer
Lady All-spice’s.’
‘I think that’s a fair judgement,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I think River Queen’s has to take
second place.’
‘At all events,’ said Li Wan, ‘Green Boy’s is bottom. Do you accept that judgement,
Green Boy?’
‘Oh yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s a perfectly fair one. Mine is just not a good poem. But’ —
he smiled hopefully —‘I think we ought to reconsider the placing of All-spice’s and
River Queen’s contributions.’
‘You agreed to abide by my decisions,’ said Li Wan. ‘I don’t think the rest of you
have any say in the matter. If anyone questions a decision of mine in future, he will
have to pay a penalty.’
Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter drop.
‘I propose that our two meetings should be on the second and sixteenth of each
month,’ said Li Wan. ‘On those occasions I shall be responsible for choosing the
subjects and the rhymes. If any of you ever feels like having an extra meeting in
be?tween those dates, there’s nothing to stop you. In fact, there’s nothing to stop
you having a meeting every day, if you feel like it. But that’s entirely up to you. On
the second and six?teenth you must all come round to my place, and the meetings
on those two days are my responsibility.’
‘We really ought to have a name for the club,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We don’t want anything
banal,’ said Tan-chun; ‘on the other hand we don’t want anything too weird and
wonderful. As we started off with a poem about white crab-blossom, why don’t we
simply call ourselves “The Crab-flower Club”? That might have seemed a somewhat
banal title other things being equal, but in our case it wouldn’t be because it would
com?memorate our founding meeting.’
Tan-chun’s proposal was followed by general discussion. After partaking of the liquid
and other refreshment which she provided, the party then broke up, some returning
to their own apartments in the Garden, some going on to Grand?mother Jia’s or Lady
Wang’s apartments outside. Our record leaves them at this point and does not
specify.

*

Aroma had been present when Bao-yu received Tan-chun’s letter and had seen him
rush off excitedly with Ebony as soon as he had finished reading it, but without
having any idea what the cause of his excitement might be. Shortly after he left, two
of the old women from the back gate arrived carrying pots of white-flowering
autumn crab. Aroma asked them who the flowers were from, and when the old
women had explained, showed them where she wanted them put, after which she
took them into the servants’ quartets and made them sit down while she went off to
Bao-yu’s room to fetch some money. She weighed out twelve penny-weights of silver
and made it into a little parcel, then, taking out an additional three hundred copper
cash, hurried back to the old women.
‘The silver is to pay the beaters with,’ she told them as she handed them the money.
‘The cash is for you to buy yourselves a drink with.’
The old women stood up, beaming all over their faces. How kind, how very kind, they
said, they couldn’t possibly take it. But as Aroma insisted, they allowed themselves to
be persuaded.
‘Are there any boys on duty outside the gate?’ Aroma asked them.
‘Oh yes, there are always four there,’ said the old women, ‘to do any errands you
young ladies in the Garden happen to want done outside. If there’s anything you
want done, Miss, just let us know and we’ll get them to do it for you.’
‘It isn’t for me,’ said Aroma smiling. ‘I wouldn’t presume. It’s Master Bao. He wants
someone to go to the Marquis of Zhong-jing’s place to deliver some things to Miss
Shi. I thought that now you’re here I might as well ask you if you wouldn’t mind when
you get back telling the boys on the gate to go out and order a cab for me. Only if
they do, will you come to me for the fare, please. Don’t go bothering them in the
front about it.’
The old women departed, promising to do as she asked, while Aroma went back into
the main apartment for a saucer to put some of the things on that she was planning
to send to Xiang-yun. But when she looked on the dresser she found that the saucer
shelf was completely empty. She glanced back to where Skybright, Ripple and Musk
sat sewing together.
‘What happened to that white onyx saucer that used to be here ’ she asked them.
The girls looked at each other blankly, trying to remember. After some moments,
Skybright’s face broke into a smile.
‘I remember. I took it to Miss Tan’s with those lychees on. It’s still there.’
‘Whatever did you take that one for, when there are so many other things you
could have used?’
‘Well, yes, that’s what I said. But the dark brown lychees and the white-and-browny
onyx did go very well together. Even Miss Tan said how pretty they looked. She made
me leave the dish there, where she could look at it. That’s why I didn’t bring it back
with me. By the way, that pair of identical vases that used to be on the very top of
the dresser isn’t back yet, either.’
‘You’ll laugh if I tell you about them,’ said Ripple. ‘You know how Master Bao never
does anything by halves. Well, the other day he had a sudden rush of dutiful feelings
come over him. He’d just picked a couple of sprays of cassia and was going to put
them in a vase, when suddenly he said, “Oh! these are the first cassia flowers I’ve
picked this year. I mustn’t keep them for my own enjoyment.” So what does he do
but fetch down those two vases, put the water in them and arrange the flowers in
them himself, and go along with them (someone else carrying them, of course) to
Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship to give them each a vase. Anyway, the beauty of it
was that some of the effects of this rubbed off on the person carrying the
vases—which it so happens was me. When Her Old Ladyship saw the flowers, she
was so delighted you just can’t imagine. “Oh, look!” she said. “What a good boy he is
to me! He can’t even see a flower without thinking of his old grannie! — And people
grumble at me for being too fond of him!” Well, as I expect you know, Her Old
Ladyship normally doesn’t seem to have much use for me—I don’t know what it is,
but there’s something about me she doesn’t seem to like—but on this occasion she
gave me a hundred cash. And she called me a “poor little thing”. “Poor little thing!”
she said. “She looks so sickly! “ I can tell you, I never expected a piece of luck like that!
I mean, a hundred cash is nothing, but the honour! - in front of all those people!
Then when we got to Her Ladyship’s, Her Ladyship was with Mrs Lian and Mrs Zhao
going through her chests and looking out some of the things she used to wear when
she was a girl to give to someone — I don’t know who it was. Anyway, when she saw
us, she left off to admire the flowers. So of course Mrs Lian has to make the most of it
by putting in her pennyworth going on about how dutiful Master Bao is and how
thoughtful and how this that and the other I can’t remember a half of what she said,
there was a whole cartload of it - but whatever it was it gave Her Ladyship a lot of
face, hearing him praised like that in front of everybody, and You Know Who not
being able to say a word against him, so of course she was very pleased. And what do
you think? She gave me two dresses! Admittedly, we get new dresses every year, so
in itself being given two dresses may not seem so wonderful. But the honour!’
‘Pooh!’ said Skybright. ‘Silly girl! You don’t know much! Those would be two
dresses that she thought weren’t good enough to give to the other person. I can’t see
much honour in that!’
‘I don’t care,’ said Ripple. ‘It was still very kind of Her Ladyship, for all that.’
‘If it had been me, I shouldn’t have wanted them,’ said Skybright. ‘What? take
someone else’s old left-overs? All of us here are only maids; none of us is supposed
to be any higher than the rest, you know. Why should she give someone else the best
and give me the left-overs? No, I’m sorry. I should have had to refuse, even if it
meant offending her. I couldn’t take a thing like that lying down!’
‘Which of us was it that she gave those other dresses to?’ said Ripple, curious. ‘I’ve
been home ill these last few days. I must have been away when it happened. Be a
sport, Skyey — tell us who it was!’
‘Why, if I tell you, will you give those dresses back again?’
‘Of course not, silly! I’d just like to know,’ said Ripple. ‘I don’t care if it was Master
Bao’s little puppy-dog she gave them to, I still think Her Ladyship meant to do me a
kindness, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s all that matters.’
The other maids laughed.
‘You’d better watch what you say! That’s just who she did give them to: Master
Bao’s little dog, Flower.’
‘Wicked girls!’ said ‘Flowers’ Aroma, laughing in spite of herself, ‘taking my name in
vain! Whenever you’ve got a few moments to spare you are making fun of me.
There’s not one of you that will come to a good end!’
‘Oh, it was you,’ said Ripple. ‘I’m go sorry, I didn’t realize. Oh, I do apologize.’
‘All right, that’s enough fooling for now,’ said Aroma. ‘The question is, which of you
is going to get that saucer?’
‘Better get the vases back too, while we’re about it,’ said Musk. ‘The one in Her Old
Ladyship’s room should be safe enough, but I wouldn’t be too sure about the one at
Her Ladyship’s. There are so many people in and out of that place - especially You
Know Who and her lot. If they see anything from our room in there, they’re sure to
find some way of breaking it accidentally-on-purpose, if they get half a chance. Her
Ladyship won’t stop them. She never notices. We ought to get that one back, at least,
as soon as we can.’
‘You’re right,’ said Skybright, laying down her sewing. ‘I’ll go and get it now.’
‘No, I’ll go for that,’ said Ripple. ‘You go and get your saucer.’
‘I’m going for the vase,’ said Skybright. ‘Why should you have all the windfalls? You
others have all had a go. Now it’s my turn.’
‘You do exaggerate,’ said Musk. ‘It’s only Ripple who’s had the luck. And it was only
because of the coincidence that Her Ladyship happened to be going through her
dresses when she arrived. Do you suppose she’ll be going through them again if you
go there now?’
‘Maybe not,’ said Skybright, with a tinge of malice. ‘On the other hand maybe she’ll
notice how conscientious I am and pay me two taels a month out of her allowance.
You see’ — she paused to add this on her way out of the room —‘I know what goes
on in here. There’s no need for the play-acting.’
She ran off with a mocking laugh.
Ripple went, too, and fetched the onyx saucer from Tan-?chun’s room, after which
Aroma made ready the things that were to go to Xiang-yun, and called in old Mamma
Song - one of the nannies attached to Green Delights — to give her in?structions for
their delivery.
‘Get yourself smartened up and change into your best things,’ she said. ‘I want you
to go out presently and take some things for me to Miss Shi’s.’
‘You can give them to me now, Miss — and any message that you want me to
deliver,’ said Mamma Song; ‘then I can go off straight away, as soon as I’ve got myself
ready.’
Aroma fetched two little boxes of lacquer and bamboo basketwork and taking the
tops off them, put foxnuts and caltrops in one and a saucerful of chestnut fudge
(made of chestnut puree steam-cooked with cassia-flavored sugar) in the other.
‘These are all our own things or made from our own things freshly gathered in the
Garden that Master Bao is sending Miss Shi a taste of,’ she said. ‘Tell her the onyx
saucer the fudge is on is the one she was admiring last time she was here and she is
to keep it. This silk bag has got the sewing in that she asked me to do for her. Tell her
the needlework’s a bit on the rough side, but I’m sure she’ll understand. And say
Master Bao sends his regards. And of course I present my compliments. I think that’s
all.’
‘Isn’t there any message from Master Bao?’ said Mamma Song. ‘Perhaps you’d
better ask him, Miss, just in case. We don’t want him saying afterwards that we’ve
forgotten some?thing.’
‘Didn’t he go round just now to Miss Tan’s place?’ Aroma asked Ripple.
‘Yes,’ said Ripple. ‘They’re all round there. They were having a discussion about
setting up a poetry club, what?ever that might be, and they were writing poems,
some of them.’ She turned to Mamma Song. ‘I shouldn’t think he’d have anything to
say. I should just push on, if I were you.’
Mamma Song took up the boxes and went off to get herself ready.
‘When you are ready, go out by the back gate,’ said Aroma as she was leaving.
‘You’ll find some of the boys there and a cab waiting for you.’
Mamma Song then left. The details of her expedition are unrecorded.

*

Some time after this Bao-yu got back. The first thing he did on arrival was to go and
look at the autumn crab-flowers. When he had finished admiring them, he went into
the house and told Aroma all about the poetry club, after which Aroma told him how
she had sent Mamma Song to Shi Xiang-yun’s with a present of things from the
Garden. Bao-yu smote his palms together in vexation.
‘Oh, we forgot about her! I knew there was something we ought to have done and
hadn’t, but I couldn’t think what it was. I’m glad you’ve reminded me. We must invite
her over at once, of course. The poetry club will be nothing without her in it.’
‘I don’t think I’d be in such a hurry to, if I were you,’ said Aroma. ‘It’s only an
amusement, this poetry thing, and Miss Shi doesn’t have the time for amusement
that the rest of you do. It isn’t as if she were her own mistress, you know. Even if you
tell her about this and she wants to come, it doesn’t follow that they’ll let her.
Suppose they don’t. She’ll only fret about it; and then all you’ll have done will be to
have made her feel miserable for nothing.’
‘That’s no problem,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shall ask Her Old Ladyship to have her fetched.’
Just then Mamma Song got back, mission completed, bear?ing Xiang-yun’s thanks to
Aroma for the things.
‘She asked me what Master Bao was doing,’ said the nannie, ‘so I told her that he
and the young ladies were starting a poetry club or some such. She was very upset.
“Oh!” she said, “are they writing poetry? I wish they’d have told me about it!”’
Bao-yu waited to hear no more. Dashing round to his grandmother’s, he insisted that
she should send instantly to have Xiang-yun fetched.
‘It’s too late now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We’ll send for her first thing tomorrow.’
Bao-yu had to be content with that, and went back to his room much downcast. He
was round at Grandmother Jia’s first thing next morning again, pestering; but it was
not until the early afternoon that Xiang-yun eventually arrived and his equanimity
was restored.
As soon as they were all together, Bao-yu began to tell Xiang-yun how the club had
come to be founded and what they had done at its first meeting. He was about to
show her the poems that they had written, but Li Wan prevented him.
‘Don’t let her see them yet,’ she said. ‘Just tell her the rhymes. As she missed our
first meeting, her penalty shall be to make up another poem now, using the same
rhymes that we did. If it’s all right, we shall invite her to join the club straight away. If
not, she must first entertain us all at our next meeting as a further penalty.’
‘I like that!’ said Xiang-yun, laughing. ‘You should be the ones to pay a penalty, for
having forgotten to invite me. Well, show me the rhymes, then. I’m not much good at
this sort of thing, but I don’t mind making a fool of myself. As long as you’ll let me
join your club, I don’t mind what I have to do sweep the floor and light the incense
for you, if you like!’
Delighted to see her so enthusiastic, and still reproaching themselves for having
forgotten about her at their inaugural meeting, the rest of them made haste to give
her the rhyme-words so that she could begin.
Xiang-yun was much too excited for careful composition. Having, even while they
were all talking, concocted a number of verses in her head, she took up a brush and
proceeded to write them down, without a single pause for correction, on the first
piece of paper that came to hand.
‘There you are!’ she said, handing it to the others. ‘I’ve written two poems using
the rhymes you gave me. I don’t know whether they’re any good or not, but at least I
have done what was told!’
‘We thought our four had just about scraped the barrel,’ they told her. ‘We couldn’t
have written one more poem on the subject, let alone two! Whatever can you have
found to say in them? I bet they just repeat what we said in ours.’
But when they looked at the poems, this is what they read.

                  Of late a goddess came down to my door
                  And planted seeds of white jade in a pot,
                  From which a wondrous white Frost Maiden grew,
                  Who, loving cold, all other things loves not.
                  Last night a cloud passed by, whose autumn shower
                  Her cold, unweeping eyes with tears did spot;
                 Since when, the poet here takes up his stay,
                 To praise her loveliness by night and day.

                 Where flower-fringed steps approach the ivied door,
                 At the wall’s foot or in a graceful pot—
                 What flowers do more sad autumn-thoughts inspire
                 Than these, whose pureness others rival not?
                 Wax teats their petals seem, by wind congealed,
                 Or filtered moonlight, flecked with many a spot.
                 Weep they because the shadows stole away
                 Their goddess-queen, who now makes dark night day?

The reading of these poems was punctuated at the end of each line with expressions
of admiration and surprise, and when they had got to the end, all of them agreed
that these two poems had made the exercise a worth-while one and fully justified
their naming the new society ‘The Crab-flower Club’.
‘You must let me provide the refreshments tomorrow as my penalty,’ said
Xiang-yun. ‘I hope you will all consent to be my guests.’
‘Splendid!’ they said; and proceeded to show her the poems they had written the
day before, and to discuss them with her.

*

That evening Bao-chai, who had invited Xiang-yun to spend the night with her at
Allspice Court, sat with her guest under the lamplight while the latter discussed
themes for the mor?row’s meeting and plans for the projected entertainment. As it
became increasingly apparent that her ideas on the subject were quite impracticable,
Bao-chai presently interrupted the flow.
‘The club has only just been founded and this will be its first entertainment,’ she
said. ‘Although it’s all only a game, you are setting a precedent, so you need to think
about it rather carefully. If the entertainment is to be equally enjoyable for everyone,
you don’t want it to be too much of a burden on you; but on the other hand you
don’t want the others to feel that they are being given short commons. Now, you are
not your own mistress, and the few strings of cash they give you a month at home
are not even enough for your own needs. And if your Aunt got to hear that you were
spending money on a frivolous thing like this, she would have still more to grumble
about than usual. In any case, even if you spent all you’d got, it still wouldn’t be
enough to provide an entertainment for several people. So what are you going to do?
You obviously can’t send home for money. Are you going to ask them here for some?’
Xiang-yun, brought back to the realities of her situation, was very much dashed.
While she hesitated, Bao-chai went on.
‘Actually I’ve thought of a way out of this. An assistant in one of our pawnshops
comes from a place where they have very good crabs. Now nearly everyone here
from Lady Jia and Aunt Wang downwards is fond of crabs and only the other day
Aunt Wang was saying that we ought to have a crab and cassia-viewing party for Lady
Jia. It’s only because she has been otherwise occupied that she hasn’t done anything
about it. Why not issue a general invitation, making no mention of the poetry club —
we can write all the poems we want to after the rest of them have gone — and I shall
ask my brother to let us have a few baskets of the biggest, fattest-looking crabs and
tell him to get us a few jars of good wine and side-dishes for four or five tables from
the shop? That should save a lot of trouble for you and make more of an occasion of
it for every?body else.’
Xiang-yun felt deeply grateful to Bao-chai and praised her warmly for her
thoughtfulness. Bao-chai smiled deprecatingly.
‘Now you mustn’t go imagining things and feel that you are being treated like a
poor relation! It’s only because I am so fond of you that I have ventured to make this
proposal. If you promise you won’t take it amiss, I can get them to arrange it for us
straight away.’
‘My dearest girl!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Of course I shan’t take it amiss! How can you
suggest such a thing? If you do so again, I shall begin to think that you aren’t really
fond of me at all! I may be a silly goose, but there are some things I understand! Do
you think that if I didn’t look on you as my own true sister I should ever have told you
last time I was here about all those tiresome things I have to put up with at home?’
Reassured, Bao-chai called in an old woman to take a mes?sage outside to her
brother.
‘Tell Mr Pan to get us a few baskets of crabs like the ones we had the other day. It’s
for after lunch tomorrow. We’re having a cassia-viewing party in the Garden for Their
Ladyships. Tell him please not to forget, because I’ve already invited all the guests.’
The old woman went off to deliver her message. In due course she reported back
again — but these are details omitted from our story.
Bao-chai resumed her conversation with Xiang-yun.
‘About the theme for tomorrow’s poems,’ she said. ‘We don’t want anything too
outlandish. If you look at the works of the great poets, you find that they didn’t go in
for the weird and wonderful titles and “daring” rhymes that people now?adays are
so fond of. Outlandish themes and daring rhymes do not produce good poetry. They
merely show up the poverty of the writer’s ideas. Certainly one wants to avoid
clichés; but one can easily go too far in the pursuit of novelty. The im?portant thing is
to have fresh ideas. If one has fresh ideas, one does not need to worry about clichés:
the words take care of themselves. But what am I saying all this for? Spinning and
sewing is the proper occupation for girls like us. Any time we have left over from that
should be spent in reading a few pages of some improving book — not on this sort of
thing!’
‘Yes,’ said Xiang-yun, without much conviction; but presently smiled as a new idea
occurred to her.
‘I’ve just thought of something. Yesterday’s theme was “White Crab-blossom”. The
flower I’d like to write about is the chrysanthemum. Couldn’t we have
“Chrysanthemums” as our theme for tomorrow?’
‘It is certainly a very seasonable one,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The trouble is that so many
people have written about it before.’
‘Yes,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘I suppose it is rather a hackneyed one.’
Bao-chai thought for a bit.
‘Unless of course you somehow involved the poet in the theme,’ she said. ‘You
could do that by making up verb-object or concrete-abstract tides in which
“chrysanthemums” was the concrete noun or the object of the verb as the case
might be. Then your poem would be both a celebration of chrysanthemums and at
the same time a description of some action or situation. Such a treatment of the
subject has been tried in the past, but it is a much less hackneyed one. The
combining of narrative and lyrical elements in a single treat?ment makes for
freshness and greater freedom.’
‘It sounds a splendid idea,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘But what sort of verbs or abstract nouns
had you in mind? Can you give me an example?’
Bao-chai thought for a bit.
‘What about “The Dream of the Chrysanthemums”?’
‘Yes, that’s a good one,’ said xiang-yun. ‘I’ve thought of one too. Couldn’t we have
“The Shadow of the Chrysanthe?mums”?’
‘Ye-e-es,’ said Bao-chai, doubtfully. ‘The trouble is, it’s been used before. Still, if we
had a lot of titles we could probably slip it in. I’ve thought of another.’
‘Well, come on then!’ said Xiang-yun.
‘What about “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”?’
Xiang-yun slapped the table appreciatively.
‘That’s a lovely one!’ Presently she added: ‘I’ve thought of another. What do you
think of “Seeking the Chrysanthe?mums”?’
‘That should be interesting,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Let’s start making a list. We’ll write
down up to ten titles and then see what we think of them.’
The two of them busied themselves for some minutes grinding ink and softening a
brush. Xiang-yun then proceeded to write down the titles at Ban-chai’s dictation.
Soon they had ten. Xiang-yun read them over.
‘Ten doesn’t make a set,’ she said. ‘We need two more to make a round dozen, then
we shall have just the right number for a little album.’
Ban-chai supplied two more without too much difficulty.
‘If we’re thinking in terms of a sequence of poems,’ she said, ‘we may as well, while
we’re about it, arrange these titles in some sort of order.’
‘ That’s it!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Then they will be all ready for making our
“Chrysanthemum Album” with afterwards.’
“‘Remembering the Chrysanthemums” should come first,’ said Bao-chai.
‘Now, let’s see. When you remember them, you realize you haven’t got any, so you
go and look for some. So “Seeking the Chrysanthemums” will be the second title.
‘ Well, having found some, you will want to plant them; so “Planting the
Chrysanthemums” will be the third title.
‘After you’ve planted them and the flowers have come out, you’ll want to stand
and look at them; so the fourth title will be “Admiring the Chrysanthemums”.
‘You won’t be able to have enough of them by just standing and admiring them, so
you’ll naturally want to pick some and arrange them in a vase so that you can enjoy
them indoors. That means “Arranging the Chrysanthemums” for Number Five.
‘But however much you enjoy them, you will feel that they somehow lack their full
lustre without words to grace them, and so you will want to celebrate them in verse.
That means “Celebrating the Chrysanthemums” will be the sixth title.
‘Well now, let’s suppose you’ve just finished writing some verses about them.
You’ve got the ink ready-made and the brush is still in your hand and you feel like
paying the chrysanthemums a further tribute. What should you do but paint them?
That’s Number Seven. “Painting the Chrysan?themums”.
‘Now in spite of these silent tributes, you still don’t know the secret of the
chrysanthemums’ mysterious charm and you can’t resist asking them. Which brings
us to Number Eight “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”.
‘And if the chrysanthemums could really reply, it would be so delightful that you
would want to have them near you all the time - and how better than by “Wearing
the Chrysanthe?mums”? That’s Number Nine.
‘That brings us to the end of the verb-object titles which involve the poet himself as
the understood subject of the action. But there remain other kinds of treatment, in
which we consider the flowers by themselves without postulating the presence of
the poet. So we have “The Shadow of the Chrysanthemums” and “The Dream of the
Chrysanthe?mums” as Numbers Ten and Eleven.
‘And of course “The Death of the Chrysanthemums” at the end of the album to
round off on a suitable note of melan?choly.
‘There you are! All three months of autumn condensed into a single sequence of a
dozen poems!’
Xiang-yun recopied the twelve titles in the order that Bao?-chai had indicated, then,
after running her eye rapidly over them, she asked Bao-chai what rhyme-scheme
they should set.
‘I have always disliked set rhymes,’ said Bao-chai. ‘If you have a good poem in the
making, why shackle it with the constraints of an arbitrary rhyme-scheme? Let us
leave set rhymes to vulgar pedants; all we need do is give out the titles and let the
others choose their own rhyme-schemes for them?selves. After all, the object of the
exercise is to give people enjoyment—the enjoyment gained by producing an
occasional felicitous line. We aren’t out to make things difficult for them.’
‘I entirely agree,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘And I am sure that in this way we shall get better
poems. There’s just one thing, though: we have twelve titles now but only five
people writing poems. Presumably we aren’t going to ask each of them to produce a
poem for every one of the titles?’
‘Oh no, that would be much too difficult,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Make a fair copy of the list
of titles, merely indicating that the poems are to be octets in Regulated Verse, put it
up on the wall where everyone can see it, and then simply let them choose
whichever titles they like. If anyone has the energy to do them all, they are welcome
to try. If they can’t manage more than one, let them do just one. Skill and speed are
what we shall be looking for. As soon as all of the twelve tides have been covered, we
shall call a halt, and anyone who goes on writing after that will be made to pay a
penalty.’
Xiang-yun did not see that this last stipulation was neces?sary, but otherwise agreed
with her, and the two girls, having satisfied themselves that their plans for the
morrow were now complete, put out the light and composed themselves for sleep.
As to the outcome of their plans: that will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 38

River Queen triumphs in her treatment of chrysanthemum themes
And Lady Allspice is satirical on the subject of crabs



THE last chapter concluded with Ban-chai and Xiang-yun retiring for the night after
their plans for the morrow had been completed. This one begins next morning, when
Xiang-yun invited Grandmother Jia and the rest to a cassia-viewing party in the
Garden. Touched by her enthusiasm, the grown-ups readily agreed to go.
‘She is so excited, bless her!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We ought to let her do this,
even though she is our guest.’
And having promised, she was as good as her word, and arrived in the Garden at
noon, bringing Lady Wang, Wang Xi-feng and Aunt Xue with her and a number of
attendant maids.
‘Now where is it going to be?’ she asked them.
‘Wherever you like, Mother,’ said Lady Wang dutifully.
‘I think they’ve already prepared for us in the Lotus Pavilion,’ said Xi-feng. ‘The
blossom on the two cassia-trees is particularly line there this year, and there is that
lovely clear, emerald water. When you sit in the little centre pavilion, you have water
all round you, which gives you a wonderful feeling of spaciousness. And looking at
water is so restful for the eyes.’
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia, and began to lead the way to the Lotus Pavilion.
The pavilion was built in the middle of the Garden’s little river at one of the places
where it broadened into a wide, deep pool. It had windows all round it and could be
approached either circuitously from one side by way of one of the two many-angled
covered piers leading to its left and right-hand verandahs, or more directly from the
other by means of a bamboo bridge leading to the centre of the verandah at the back.
It was towards this bamboo bridge that the party was now making its way. As
Grandmother Jia stepped on to it, Xi-feng hurried forward to support her.
‘You can put your feet down as hard as you like, Grannie,’ she said. ‘Bamboo
bridges always creak like this when you go over them. They are meant to.’
The Lotus Pavilion was in reality not one pavilion but two, for the main pavilion
properly so called gave on to a smaller pavilion, referred to simply as ‘the water
pavilion’ or the centre pavilion’, which was in the very middle of the little lake.
When they were all inside the main pavilion, they noticed that two bamboo tables
had been set out on the verandah. On one of them were ranged winecups,
chopsticks and all things needful for serving wine, and on the other were teacups,
tea?pots, tea-whisks, saucers, and various other tea-things. Beside the tea-table two
or three maids were busy fanning a little tri?pod stove on which water for tea-making
was being boiled, while at the other end of the verandah maids were fanning a stove
on which water for warming the wine-kettles was being heated. Grandmother Jia was
particularly impressed by the arrangements for tea-making and remarked with
pleasure how clean everything looked—including the spot that had been chosen for
the party.
‘Cousin Bao-chai helped me get it ready,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Well, I’ve always said she
was a thoughtful child,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘A lot of thought has certainly gone
into these preparations.’
As she was speaking, her eye fell on a pair of boards that hung from two of the pillars.
The couplet inscribed on them was in mother-o’-pearl inlay on a black lacquer
background. She asked Xiang-yun to read it out to her. This is what it said:

             Lotus reflections shatter at the dip of a lazy oar-blade
             Lotus fragrances float up from the swirl round a bamboo bridge-pile

After hearing the couplet, Grandmother Jia glanced up at the horizontal board which
bore the name of the pavilion and was in characters large enough for her to read
herself. She turned to Aunt Xue, who was standing beside her.
‘When I was a girl, there was a pavilion like this one in our garden at home. It was
called—let me see—“Above the Clouds” because of the sky reflected in the water
below, you see. When I was about the same age as these young people are now, I
used to go with the others every day there to play. One day I slipped and fell down
into the water. I nearly drowned. They had a terrible job getting me out. And even
then I caught my head on one of the wooden pegs on the way up. I’ve still got a place
big enough to put the tip of a linger in where it hit me. It’s on the side here, just
where the hair begins. Of course, at the time everyone thought it was all up with me.
They were sure that after being all that time in the water I’d catch my death of cold.
But I got over it.’
‘If you hadn’t,’ said Xi-feng before anyone else could speak, ‘what would have
happened to all the good fortune you’ve enjoyed, Grannie? It’s obvious you were
meant to have it, otherwise why would you have been given that dent in your head?
The guardian spirits must have put it there to store your good fortune in. Old
Longevity has got a dent in his head, too; only his has got so much good fortune
packed into it that it bulges out a bit.’
This comical allusion to the God of Longevity’s enormous cranium set all of them
laughing — including, of course, the old lady herself.
‘Naughty monkey!’ she said. ‘Make fun of me, would you? I’d like to tear that
wicked mouth of yours!’
‘It’s because I wanted to make you laugh, Grannie. Laugh?ter makes the humours
circulate. We’re going to be eating crabs shortly, and I was afraid that the cold of the
crab-meat might settle on your heart. If I can make you laugh and stir your humours
up, you’ll be able to eat as much crab as you like without taking any harm from it.’
‘In that case I shall have to keep you with me all the time, so that I am always
laughing,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ll have to stop you going home at night.’
‘It’s because you indulge her so much that she is so cheeky, Mother,’ said Lady
Wang. ‘By saying things like that to her you will make her even worse.’
‘But I like her cheekiness!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘After all, there’s no harm in it.
She knows what’s what underneath it all, of course she does. I think it’s nice that the
young people should feel free to joke and laugh a bit when we are all on our own
together. We don’t want them behaving like a lot of stuffed dummies, surely?’
While she was saying this, they all passed into the smaller pavilion, where tea was
served, after which Xi-feng came bustling in with winecups and chopsticks and began
to lay. Grandmother Jia sat with Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu at a centre
table, and Xiang-yun, Lady Wang, Ying?-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at a table on the
east side of the room. A little table was laid for Xi-feng and Li Wan on the west side of
the doorway, but this was only for form’s sake, since both of them remained on their
feet in order to wait on the other two tables.
‘We shan’t want all the crabs at once,’ said Xi-feng to the servants bringing them in.
‘Ten will be enough to start with. The others can go back into the steamer.’
She called for some water, and after washing her hands, stood at the centre table
facing Grandmother Jia and began shelling the crabs. She offered the first meat, as a
courtesy, to Aunt Xue.
‘No thank you,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I don’t need anyone to do it for me. I like doing it
myself and getting crabby fingers. I think they taste better when you eat them with
your fingers.’
Xi-feng gave the crab-meat she had prepared to Grand?mother Jia. The second lot
she offered to Bao-yu. Then she called for some ‘really hot wine’. She also sent a little
maid to fetch mung-bean flour scented with chrysanthemum leaves and cassia for
cleaning the lingers with and removing the smell of crab.
Xiang-yun sat with the others at her own table for a while, but as soon as she had
finished her first crab, got up to look after her guests. She also went outside and gave
orders for a plate of crabs to be taken to Aunt Zhao and another to Aunt Zhou. At
once Xi-feng came bearing down on her.
‘You’re not used to this. You get on with your eating and leave this to me! I’ll have
mine when the rest of you have finished.’
But Xiang-yun, refusing to be put off, ordered a long table to be laid on the verandah
at the far side of the Lotus Pavilion and invited the maids Faithful, Amber, Sunset,
Suncloud and Patience to come and sit at it.
Faithful glanced laughingly in Xi-feng direction.
‘I can’t very well sit down and eat while Mrs Lian is waiting on everybody.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You all go and sit down. I’ll take care of everything.’
At that Xiang-yun, too, went back to her seat.
Li Wan and Xi-feng now made a brief pretence of joining in the party, but Xi-feng was
soon on her feet again minister?ing to the rest. After a few minutes she went out on
to the verandah, where Faithful and the other maids were regaling themselves with
great gusto. They rose to their feet when they saw her come.
‘What have you come out here for, Mrs Lian?’ said Faith?ful. ‘Can’t you leave us
alone to enjoy ourselves for a bit?’
‘Well, aren’t you disagreeable!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Here am I doing all the work for you,
but instead of thanks I get grumbled at! I was hoping you would offer me a drink.’
Faithful, laughing, quickly filled a winecup and held it to Xi-feng lips. Tilting her head
back, Xi-feng drained it at a gulp. Amber and Sunset followed suit, and two more
cupfuls went down in the same way. Meanwhile Patience had been scooping out
some ‘yolk’ — the delicious golden crab-spawn — which she now offered to her
mistress. Xi-feng told her to put lots of ginger and vinegar on it, then, having quickly
disposed of it, ‘You can all sit down now and get on with your party,’ she said. ‘I’m
going.’
‘What a nerve!’ said Faithful. ‘Scrounging off us like that!’
‘You’d better be careful what you say to me, my girl,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I
suppose you realize that Mr Lian has taken a fancy to you and is going to ask Her Old
Ladyship if he can have you for his Number Two?’
Faithful tutted and shook her head. It was easy to see that she was blushing.
‘Huh!’ she said. ‘Fancy a lady saying a thing like that! I’m going to wipe my smelly
fingers on your face, Mrs Lian, if it’s the last thing I do.’
‘No, no! Please! Forgive me!’ said Xi-feng, as Faithful stood up to carry out her
threat.
‘Even if she does,’ said Amber, laughing, ‘I wouldn’t be too sure that Patience will.
Look at her, all of you! She hasn’t eaten two crabs yet, but she’s already finished a
saucerful of vinegar!’
Patience, who had in her hand a crab richly endowed with ‘yolk’ that she had just
finished shelling, held it up when she heard this jibe and advanced on Amber,
intending to smear her face with it.
‘You nasty, spiteful little creature!’ she said, both laughing and indignant. ‘I’ll—’
But Amber dodged aside, and Patience, losing her balance, plastered the crab smack
on to her mistress’s cheek. Xi-feng, at that moment still preoccupied with Faithful,
was taken completely by surprise. Her startled ‘Aiyo!’ was too much for the maids,
who collapsed in uncontrollable laughter. Xi-feng presently joined in, though cursing
Patience as she did so.
‘Stupid cow! Are you too drunk to see straight? All over my face!’
Patience hurriedly wiped it off and fetched water for her to wash with.
‘Holy Name!’ said Faithful. ‘That was a judgement, if ever there was one!’
Hearing the laughter outside, Grandmother Jia eagerly asked to know its cause.
‘What is it? What have you seen that’s so funny? Tell us, so that we can share the
joke.’
Faithful shouted back, amidst laughter.
‘Mrs Lian came over here and stole some of our crab. Patience didn’t like it, so she
smeared crab-yolk all over her mistress’s face, and now the two of them are having a
fight.’
Hoots of laughter from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang.
‘Poor Mrs Lian!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You ought to feel sorry for her. Couldn’t you
spare her a few of the legs or some of the underneath bits?’
There was renewed laughter from the maids. Faithful shouted back again.
‘She can have all the crab’s-legs on this table, and very welcome to them!’
Xi-feng, taking all in good part, finished washing her face and went back to help
Grandmother Jia and the others at the centre table with their crabs.
Dai-yu dared not eat very much because of her delicate health, and after consuming
a little of the claw-meat, excused herself from the table. Soon Grandmother Jia, too,
had finished eating, and everyone washed their hands and broke off for a while to
amuse themselves, some going off to admire the flowers, some to drop things in the
water and watch the fish rise.
‘It’s rather windy for you here, Mother,’ said Lady Wang, ‘— especially after you’ve
just been eating crab. Perhaps you ought to go back to your own room now and test.
If you have enjoyed it, we could come again tomorrow.’
‘Yes, perhaps you are right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I hadn’t been going to leave,
because I could see how much they were all enjoying themselves and was afraid of
spoiling the fun. But perhaps you and I ought to be getting along now.’
As she rose to leave, she turned to address Xiang-yun.
‘Don’t let your Cousin Bao-yu eat too much!’
‘No, Grandma.’
She turned once more as she was leaving, this time including Bao-chai in her
admonition.
‘And don’t you two eat too much, either. Crab is very good to eat, but it isn’t very
good for you. If you eat too much of it, it will give you stomach-ache.’
‘Yes, Grandma.’
The two girls saw her out of the Garden. When they were back again, they gave
orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid; but Bao-yu
objected.
‘No, don’t lay again,’ he said. ‘We want to get on with the poetry. Put the big round
table in the middle with all the food and drink on it so that we can help ourselves
when we feel like it and sit where we like. That will be much nicer than having set
places.’
Bao-chai agreed; but Xiang-yun reminded them that there were others besides
themselves to be considered, and having first ordered a separate table to be laid and
some good hot crabs to be selected, she invited Aroma, Nightingale, Chess, Scribe,
Picture, Oriole and Ebony to come and sit at it. After that she had a couple of carpets
spread out on the ground beneath the cassia-trees at the foot of the rockery and
made the old nannies and junior maids sit down on them and eat and drink to their
hearts’ content, insisting that they need only get up to wait on them if they were
specially called for. Then she took the list of poem-titles and pinned it to the inside
wall of the pavilion.
‘Very original!’ the others commented when they had finished reading the titles,
but went on to express the fear that they might find them difficult to write on.
Xiang-yun explained what they had decided about rhymes: viz. that there should be
no set rhyme-scheme and everyone should be free to choose their own.
‘Now that’s what I call sensible!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t stand set rhymes.’
Dai-yu had a barrel-shaped porcelain tabouret moved up to the verandah’s edge, and
having selected a fishing-rod for herself, sat leaning on the railing, fishing.
Bao-chai sat for some time silently contemplating a spray of cassia she had picked,
then, leaning over the railings and idly plucking off the flowerets, dropped them one
by one into the water and watched the fish swim up from below and nibble at them
with plopping noises as they floated on the surface.
Xiang-yun for the most part sat quietly musing, occasion?ally getting up to look after
Aroma and the other maids at the table outside, or to make sure that the people
sitting on the carpets were getting enough to eat and drink.
Tan-chun stood with Li Wan and Xi-chun in the shade of a weeping willow, watching
the water-fowl.
Ying-chun sat apart from the rest beneath a flowering tree, stringing jasmine
blossoms into a flower-chain with a needle and thread.
Bao-yu watched Dai-yu fishing for a bit, then went over and leaned on the railings
and talked with Bao-chai for a bit, and finally, after watching Aroma and the other
maids eating and drinking at their table, ended up by drinking with them himself
while Aroma shelled a crab for him.
Presently Dai-yu put down her fishing-rod, went over to the central table, took up a
silver ‘self-service’ wine-kettle whose surface was carved with a nielloed plum-flower
pattern, and, having selected a little shallow, rose-quartz winecup, was just about to
pour herself a drink, when a maid observed her and came hurrying up to do it for her.
‘No, let me pour it myself,’ said Dai-yu. ‘That is half the fun. You get on with your
party.’
So saying, she proceeded to half-fill the tiny receptacle with liquor from the silver
kettle. But it proved to be yellow rice-wine, whereas what she wanted was spirits.
‘I only ate a small amount of crab,’ she said, ‘but it has given me a slight heart-burn.
What I really need is some very hot samshoo.’
‘ We have some,’ said Bao-yu, and quickly ordered a kettle of special
mimosa-flavoured samshoo to be heated for her. Dai-yu took only a sip of it before
putting the winecup down again.
Presently Bao-chai strolled up and helped herself to the samshoo. She, too, put her
cup down after taking only a tiny mouthful of it. Then she moistened a brush with ink,
and going over to the list of titles, put a tick over the first one, ‘Remembering the
Chrysanthemums’, and wrote the word ‘Allspice’ underneath it.
‘Please leave Number Two for me, Chai,’ said Bao-yu anxiously. ‘I’ve already
thought of four lines for it.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘I’ve had a hard enough job thinking of lines for this first one. You’ve nothing to
worry about as far as I’m con?cerned.’
Dai-yu, without saying a word, quietly relieved Bao-chai of the brush, ticked first
‘Questioning the Chrysanthemums’ and then the eleventh title, ‘The Dream of the
Chrysanthemums’, and wrote ‘River’ underneath each of them.
After her, Bao-yu took up the brush and ticked ‘Seeking the Chrysanthemums’. He
signed himself ‘Green’.
Tan-chun now drifted over and looked at the list.
‘Oh, hasn’t anyone chosen “Wearing the Chrysanthemums” yet?’ she said. ‘Let me
do that one.’
She turned, smilingly, to Bao-yu and pointed a warning finger at him.
‘We’ve just made a new rule, by the way. No naked ladies this time, please. You
have been warned!’
Xiang-yun strolled up while she was saying this and ticked Numbers Four and Five —
‘Admiring the Chrysanthemums’ and ‘Arranging the Chrysanthemums’ — in rapid
succession. She signed herself ‘Xiang’ underneath them.
‘You ought to have a pen-name like the test of us,’ said Tan-chun.
‘There are various pavilions and studios at home, of course,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘but I
don’t live in any of them. It would be rather pointless to call myself after a building
like the rest of you.’
‘What about that water pavilion “Above the Clouds” that Lady Jia was telling us
about?’ said Bao-chai. ‘You could call that yours. Even if it doesn’t exist any more,
you can pretend that it would have been yours. You should call yourself “Cloud
Maiden”.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said the others; and before Xiang-yun herself could do anything, Bao-yu
had crossed out the ‘Xiang’ and substituted the word ‘Cloud’ beneath it.
In less time than it would take to eat a meal, poems had been completed for each of
the twelve titles. The young poets then wrote out their poems and handed them in
to Ying-chun, who copied them out, each with the full pen-name of its author, on to
the finest Snow Wave notepaper.
Li Wan then read them all through, the others overlooking her.

Remembering the Chrysanthemums
by Lady Allspice
The autumn wind that through the knotgrass blows
Blurs the sad gazer’s eye with unshed tears;
But autumn’s guest, who last year graced this plot,
Only, as yet, in dreams of night appears.
                           The wild geese from the North are now returning;
                           The dhobi’s thump at evening fills my ears.
                     Those golden flowers for which you see me pine
                     I’ll meet once more at this year’s Double Nine.

Seeking the Chrysanthemum
by Green Boy
                 The crisp day bids us go on an excursion—
                 Resistant to the wineshop door’s temptation—
                 Some garden, where, before the frosts, was planted
                 The glory of autumn, being our destination:
                 Which after weary walk having found, we’ll sing
                          An autumn song with unsubdued elation.
                          And you, gold flowers, if all the poet told
                          You understood, would not refuse his gold!

Planting the Chrysanthemums
by Green Boy
             Brought from their nursery and, with loving hands,
                   Planted along the fence and by the door —
         A shower last night their wilting leaves revived,
                  Opening the morning-buds all silver-hoar.
                   Sweet flowers! a thousand autumn songs I’ll sing
         To praise your beauty, and libations pour,
                  And water you, and ridge with earth around.
                   No dust on my wet well-path shall be found!

Admiring the Chrysanthemums

            Transplanted treasures, dear to me as gold—
            Both the pale clumps and those of darker hue!
            Rare-headed by your wintry bed I sit
            And, musing, hug my knees and sing to you.
        None more than you the villain world disdains;
            None understands your proud heart as I do.
        The precious hours of autumn I’ll not waste,
            But bide with you and savour their full taste.

Arranging the Chrysanthemums

             What greater pleasure than the lute to strum

             To hold the garden’s fragrance in one vase,
                   And see all autumn in a single spray?
             On frosty nights I’ll dream you back again,
             Brave in your garden bed at close of day.
             Since with your shy disdain I sympathize,
    ’Tis you, not summer’s gaudy blooms I prize.

Celebrating the Chrysanthemums
by River Queen
                   Down garden walks, in search of inspiration,
         A restless demon drives me all the time;
             Then brush blooms into praises, and the mouth
             Grows scud-sweet, hymning those scents sublime.
             Yet easier ’twere a world of grief to tell
             Than to lock autumn’s secret in one rhyme.
             That miracle old Tao did once attain;
             Since when a thousand bards have tried in vain

             When cunning black-ink blots the flowers’ leaves make,
             And white the petals, silvered o’er with frost.
             Fresh scents of autumn from the paper rise,
             And shapes unmoving by the wind are tossed.
             No need at Double Ninth live flowers to pluck:
                       These living seem, upon a fine screen stuck!

            Of all the flowers why do yours bloom so late?
                       The garden silent lies in frosty dew;
            The geese return; the cricket mourns his fate.

Wearing the Chrysanthemums
by Plantain Lover
                       Just to admire and not for our adornment
             Were these reared and arranged with so much care;
                       Yet young Sir Fop, with whom flowers are a passion,
             And drunk old Tao both dote on flowers to wear.
                       One’s head-cloth reeks of autumn’s acrid perfume;
             Chill dew of autumn pearls the other’s hair
             The vulgar crowd, which nothing understands,
             Stops in the street and, jeering, claps its hands.

The Shadow of the Chrysanthemums

                     The autumn moonlight through the garden steals,
      Filtered in patches variously bright.
           Flowers by the house as silhouettes appear;
           Flowers by the fence are flecked with coins of light.
                In the flowers’ wintry scent their souls reside,
                Not in those frost-forms, than a dream more slight.
                     Even the gross vandal, squinting through drunken eyes,
                     Can, by their scents, the crushed flowers recognize.

The Dream of the Chrysanthemums

                 Light-headed in my autumn bed I lie
                And seem to chase the moon across the sky.
                Well, if immortal, I’ll go seek old Tao,
                Not imitate Zhuang’s flittering butterfly!
                Following the wild goose, into sleep I slid;
                From which now, startled by the cricket’s cry,
                Midst cold and fog and dying leaves I wake,
                With no one by to tell of my heart’s ache.

The Death of the Chrysanthemums
by Plantain Lover
                The feasting over and the first snow fallen,
                The flowers frost-stricken lie or sideways lean,
                Their perfume lingering, but their gold hue dimmed
                And few poor, tattered leaves bereft of green.
                Now under moonlit bench the cricket shrills,
                And weary goose-files in the cold sky are seen.
                Yet of your passing let me not complain:
                 Next autumn equinox we’ll meet again!

*

Each poem was praised in turn, and the reading of the whole twelve concluded
amidst cries of mutual admiration.
‘Now just a moment!’ said Li Wan, interrupting their encomiums. ‘Let me first try to
give you an impartial judge?ment. I think there were good lines in all of the poems,
but comparing one with another, it seems to be that one is bound to place
“Celebrating the Chrysanthemums” first, with “Questioning the Chrysanthemums”
second and “The Dream of the Chrysanthemums” third. The titles themselves were
original, and - particularly in their treatment of the subject these are three highly
original poems. So I think that today the first place must undoubtedly go to River
Queen. After those first three I would place “Wearing the Chrysan?themums”,
“Admiring the Chrysanthemums”, “Arranging the Chrysanthemums”, “Painting the
Chrysanthemums” and “Remembering the Chrysanthemums” in that order.’
Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly.
‘Absolutely right! A very fair judgement!’
‘I’m afraid mine aren’t really all that good,’ said Dai-yu. ‘They are a bit too
contrived.’
‘There’s nothing wrong with a bit of contrivance,’ said Li Wan. ‘One doesn’t want
the structure of a poem to stand out too ruggedly.’
‘I very much like that couplet of Cloud Maiden’s,’ said Dai-yu:

         ‘On frosty nights I’ll dream you back again,
         Brave in your garden bed at close of day.

It’s a technique that painters call “white-backing”. That mar?vellous couplet that
comes before it:

         To hold the garden’s fragrance in a vase,
         And see all autumn in a single spray

already sums up all there is to be said on the subject of flower? arrangement. You
feel that she’s left herself nothing else to say. So what does she do? She goes back to
the time before the flowers were arranged — before they were picked, even. That
going back in her “frosty nights’ couplet is a very subtle way of throwing the main
theme into relief, just as the artist’s white-backing sharpens the highlights on the
other side of the painting.’
Li Wan smiled.
‘That may be so; but your own “acrid-sweet” couplet is more than a match for it.’
‘I think Lady Allspice dealt with her subject most effect?ively,’ said Tan-chun. ‘That
couplet of hers:

             But autumn’s guest, who last year graced this plot,
             Only as yet in dreams of night appears

seems to bring out the idea of remembering so vividly.’
‘Well, your “head-cloth reeking of autumn’s acrid perfume” and “chill dew of
autumn pearling the hair” give a pretty vivid image of wearing chrysanthemums,’
said Bao-chai with a laugh.
‘And River Queen’s “who shares your hiding place?” “why do you bloom so late?”,’
said Xiang-yun, smiling mis?chievously, ‘make so thorough a job of questioning them,
that one feels the poor things must have been quite tongue-tied!’
‘For that matter,’ said Li Wan, entering into the spirit of the thing, ‘your persistent
haunting of the chrysanthemums — “sitting bare-headed by their wintry bed” and
“hugging your knees and singing to them”—makes one suspect that if the
chrysanthemums really had consciousness, they might, in the end, have grown just a
tiny bit tired of your company!’
The others all laughed.
‘I seem to be bottom again,’ said Bao-yu ruefully. ‘Though I must say I should have
thought that

        … to go on an excursion—
        Some garden where. . . was planted
                           The glory of autumn being our destination

and so forth was a perfectly satisfactory exposition of “seeking the chrysanthemums”;
and that

             A shower last night the wilting leaves revived,
             Opening the morning-buds all silver-hoar

dealt with the theme of transplanting chrysanthemums rather successfully. Heigh-ho!
I suppose it’s just that I couldn’t produce anything quite as good as River Queen’s
“acrid-sweet” line, or Cloud Maiden’s “bare-headed by your wintry bed”, or Plaintain
lover’s “reeking head-cloth” or “few poor, tattered leaves”, or Lady Allspice’s “autumn
guest in dreams of night appears”.
‘Well, never mind,’ he went on, after a moment’s reflection. ‘Perhaps tomorrow or
the day after, if I’ve got the time, I’ll try to do all twelve of them again on my own.’
‘Your poems were perfectly all right,’ said Li Wan consol?ingly. ‘It’s simply as you
yourself have just said that they didn’t have anything quite as good as the lines you
have men?tioned.’
Discussion of the poems continued a little longer, after which they called for another
lot of hot crabs and sat down at the large round table to eat them.
‘Eating crab-and admiring the cassia like this is itself a good theme for a poem, said
Bao-yu. ‘I’ve already thought of one. Is anyone else game to have a try?’
He quickly washed his hands and taking up a brush, wrote down the poem he had
thought of. The others then read what he had written:
            How delightful to sit and a crab’s claw to chew
            In the cassia shade — with some ginger-sauce, too
    Old Grim-chops wants wine, though he’s got no inside,
    And he walks never forwards, but all to one side.
            The ‘yolks’ are so tasty, who cares if we’re ill!
            Though our fingers we’ve washed, they are crab-scented still.
                 ‘O crabs,’ Dong-po said (and his words I repeat)
                 ‘You have not lived in vain if you’re so good to eat!’


‘One could churn out that sort of poem by the dozen,’ said Dai-yu.
‘You’ve used up all your inspiration,’ said Bao-yu; ‘but instead of admitting that you
can’t write any more, you make rude remarks about my poem!’
Dai-yu made no reply, but tilted her head back, lifted up her eyes, and for some
minutes could be observed muttering softly to herself; then, picking a brush up, she
wrote out the follow?ing poem rapidly and without hesitation:

             In arms and in armour they met their sad fate.
             How tempting they look now, piled up on a plate!
             The white flesh is tasty, the pink flesh as well—
             Both the white in the claws and the pink in the shell;
             And we’re glad he’s an eight- not a four-legged beast
             When there’s plenty of wine to enliven the feast.
             So with crab let us honour the Double Ninth Day,
             While chrysanthemums bloom ’neath the cassia’s spray.

Bao-yu had read this and was just beginning to say how good he thought it was when
Dai-yu impetuously tore it up and told one of the servants to take away the pieces
and burn them.
‘It’s not as good as yours,’ she said. ‘It deserves to be burnt. Actually yours is very
good — better even than the chrysanthe?mum ones. You ought to keep it to show
people.’
‘I’ve thought of one too,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It was rather a struggle, so I’m afraid it
won’t be very good; but I’ll write it down anyway for a laugh.’
Then she wrote down her poem, and the others read it.

             With winecups in hand, as the autumn day ends,
             And with watering mouths, we await our small friends.
             A straightforward breed you are certainly not,
             And the goodness inside you has all gone to pot—

There were cries of admiration at this point.
‘That’s a very neat bit of invective!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can see I shall have to burn my
poem now!’
They read on.

                  For your cold humours, ginger; to cut out your smell
                  We’ve got wine and chrysanthemum petals as well.
                  As you hiss in your pot, crabs, d’ye look back with pain
                  On that calm moonlit cove and the fields of fat grain?

When they had finished reading, all agreed that this was the definitive poem on the
subject of eating crabs.
‘It’s the sign of a real talent,’ they said, ‘to be able to see a deeper, allegorical
meaning in a frivolous subject — though the social satire is a trifle on the harsh side!’
Just then Patience arrived back in the Garden.
But what then ensued will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 39

An inventive old county woman tells a story of somewhat
questionable veracity
And an impressionable young listener insists on getting to
the bottom of the matter

PATIENCE, you will recall, had just returned to the party.
‘What’s happened to your mistress?’ the others asked her.
‘Why doesn’t she come back and join us?’
‘She hasn’t got time,’ said Patience, laughing. ‘She’s sent me to ask if you’ve got any
crabs left. She says she didn’t get a proper chance to eat any earlier on, and as she
hasn’t got time to come here herself, would I ask you, if you’ve still got any, to let me
take a few back for her.’
‘We’ve got plenty left,’ said Xiang-yun, and gave orders for ten of the largest to be
put in a box for her to take.
‘Pick as many as you can with the round “navels”,’ said Patience to the old servant
who was departing to do Xiang?-yun’s bidding.
Li Wan tried to make Patience sit down with them, but she refused.
‘You shall sit down!’ said Li Wan, eyeing her skittishly; and taking her by the hand,
she drew her down beside her and held a cup of wine up to her lips so that she was
forced to drink. Patience gulped down a mouthful of it and then rose again to go.
‘I won’t let you go!’ said Li Wan. ‘The only person you ever take any notice of is that
precious Feng of yours; you think you don’t need to obey me; but you shall.’ She
turned to the old woman, now waiting in readiness with the box of crabs, and told
her to go on ahead with them and tell Xi-feng that Patience was being detained. The
old woman went away.
She returned a short while after, still carrying the box, with a message.
‘Mrs Lian says thank you very much, and she hopes you didn’t think her greedy for
asking. She’s put some caltrop?-cakes and some chicken-fat rolls in the box, that have
just been sent her by the elder Lady Wang. She thought you and the young ladies
might like to try them.’
There was a further message for Patience:
‘Mrs Lian says she thought she sent you to fetch something for her, not to stay here
and amuse yourself. Anyway, she says, tell her not to drink too much.’
‘Oh,’ said Patience, laughing, ‘and what will happen to me if I do?’
As if in defiance of her mistress’s instructions, she fell to eating and drinking with
great gusto. Li Wan meanwhile encircled her waist in an affectionate embrace.
‘What a pity that so distinguished-looking a young woman should have been born
to so humble a fate!’ said Li Wan. ‘It’s you who should have been the mistress. You
would have made such a good lady. No one who didn’t know would ever take you for
a maid.’
Patience, who had continued eating and drinking with Bao-chai and Xiang-yun while
Li Wan was saying this, now turned round and looked at her with a giggle.
‘Stop it, Mrs Zhu! You’re tickling me!’
‘Aiyo!’ said Li Wan. ‘What’s this great hard thing here?’
‘Keys,’ said Patience.
‘Keys?’ said Li Wan. ‘What has your mistress got so pre?cious that you need to
carry keys round all the time? Do you know what I tell people about you? I tell them:
Just as you can’t imagine a Tripitaka going off to India to fetch the scriptures without
his white horse or a Liu Zhi-yuan conquer?ing the Empire without a Spirit of the
Melon Fields to give him his armour, so you can’t imagine a Wang Xi-feng without a
Patience alongside helping her. You are your mistress’s master-key. What does she
need to make you carry these things around with you for?’
Patience laughed embarrassedly.
‘You are making fun of me, Mrs Zhu. I’m afraid you’ve had too much to drink.’
‘No, it’s true,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Whenever we start gossiping about personalities, we
nearly always end up by agreeing what exceptional people you and the other chief
maids are. And all exceptional in your own different ways, too— that’s what’s so
interesting.’
‘It’s almost as though Nature had in each case designed the mistress and the maid
to suit each other,’ said Li Wan. ‘Take Grandmother and Faithful, for example.
Grandmother would be completely lost without Faithful. Who in the family from Lady
Wang downwards would ever dare answer Grandmother back? Yet Faithful does. And
what’s more, Grandmother will listen to her. And look at all the things that
Grandmother has. No one else could ever remember them the way that Faithful can.
Just think how Grandmother would be plundered and cheated if Faithful weren’t
there to look after them. And on top of it all, she’s a very fair person. She’ll often put
in a good word for someone. And though she has so much influence with
Grandmother, she never, never uses it to do anyone else down.’
Xi-chun smiled.
‘Yesterday when Grannie was talking about Faithful she said, “She’s better than all
you grandchildren!”’
‘Faithful’s a good sort,’ said Patience. ‘I don’t consider my?self in her class at all.’
‘Mother’s Suncloud is a good, honest soul,’ said Bao-yu.
‘She certainly is,’ said Tan-chun. ‘She’s got a mind of her own, though. You know
what a Holy Buddha Mother is: she doesn’t notice a half of what goes on around her.
But Sun-cloud does. And she is the one who always has to remind Mother about
everything. She even knows about outside mat?ters. When Father is at home, it’s
Suncloud who has to remind Mother about them when she forgets.’
‘I don’t know about Mother and Suncloud,’ said Li Wan, ‘but what about this young
gentleman here?’ She pointed to Bao-yu. ‘Can you imagine the sort of state he would
be in if he hadn’t got his Aroma to look after him? And Feng too. Even though she’s a
regular Tyrant King, she still needs her Patience in order to be so efficient, just as
much as the real Tyrant King needed his two strong arms in order to be able to lift up
those hundredweight tripods.’
‘There were four of us when I first came here with Mrs Lian,’ said Patience, ‘but the
others all either died or left. I’m the only one who’s stayed with her all along.’
‘You’re lucky then,’ said Li Wan. ‘And Feng is lucky, too. When I first came here to
Mr Zhu, I had several maids, too, but — I don’t know why it was, for I’m sure you
wouldn’t call me a hard mistress — they were always dissatisfied. So when Mr Zhu
died, I took advantage of their being still young to get rid of them all. If only I’d had a
dependable girl like you that I could have kept on with me, I shouldn’t feel quite so
helpless now.’
Her eyes began to redden as she said this, and she seemed about to cry.
‘Oh, come now!’ said the others. ‘There’s no need to upset yourself. If you’re going
to be like this, we might just as well break up the party.’
They did in fact begin washing their hands then and pre?sently decided to go off in a
body to pay their duty calls on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang. Meanwhile the old
women and maids busied themselves with sweeping out the pavilion and stacking
and washing up the cups and dishes.
Aroma left in the company of Patience. On the way back she asked Patience into
Green Delights. She made her sit down and invited her to take tea, but Patience
declined, saying that she would drop in another time, and rose to go. Aroma had
something to ask her, however, and called after her as she was going.
‘What’s happened to this month’s allowances?’ she said. ‘Even Her Old Ladyship’s
and Her Ladyship’s people haven’t had theirs yet.’
Patience spun round when she heard this and came back again.
‘Don’t ask me about that, please!’ she said in a low, agit?ated voice, after first
glancing round to make sure that no one else was present. ‘Whatever it is, you’ll only
have another day or two to wait, I promise you.’
Aroma was amused to see her so agitated.
‘Why, what’s the matter? Why should you be in such a state about it?’
Patience dropped her voice even lower.
‘Mrs Lian has already put the money for this month’s allow?ances out at interest.
She’s waiting for the interest on some of her other loans to pay your allowances with.
It’s all right for me to tell you this, but whatever you do, don’t let anyone else know
about it!’
Aroma laughed.
‘But she’s not short of money, she’s got plenty. What does she want to go giving
herself all this extra worry for?’
‘She’s certainly not short of money,’ said Patience. ‘Just in the few years since she
started doing this, the amount she has got out on loan must have grown to several
hundred times the original premium. And she doesn’t spend all of her own
allow?ance, either. Whenever she’s got nine or ten taels saved up out of it, she
invests them too. Why, just her profits alone after she’s deducted the allowances
from the interest must be in the region of a thousand taels a year.’
‘You and your mistress are a nice pair, I must say!’ said Aroma. Keeping the rest of
us short while you use our money to feather your own nests with!’
‘That’s most unfair!’ said Patience indignantly. ‘Any way, I’m sure you can’t really be
short of money.’
‘Not myself, it’s true’ said Aroma. ‘In any case, I haven’t got anything to spend it on.
I was thinking more of my young gentleman. I like to keep some by me in case he
ever needs any.’
‘Look, if you’re in urgent need of money, I’ve got a few taels put by myself that I can
let you have,’ said Patience. ‘You can have them as an advance on this month’s
allowance, if you like.’
‘I don’t really need any at the moment,’ said Aroma, ‘but may I take you up on your
offer if I ever do?’
‘Of course,’ said Patience, and left without further cere?mony.
Outside the courtyard gate a maid from Xi-feng was look?ing for her.
‘The Mistress wants to see you about something.’
‘What has she got so urgent that she has to keep pestering me like this?’ said
Patience. ‘I’ve just had Mrs Zhu all over me to make me stay and talk to her. It’s not
as if I’d run away.’
‘Better ask her yourself,’ said the girl. ‘It wasn’t my idea to fetch you.’
‘Cheeky devil!’ said Patience, and continued on her way.
When she got there, however, it was not Xi-feng she found waiting for her, but the
old countrywoman she had admitted on a previous occasion as a suppliant, Grannie
Liu, with her little grandson Ban-er. They were sitting in the side room on the kang
with Zhang Cai’s wife and Zhou Rui’s wife on either side of them, while maids were
emptying sacks of jujubes, melons and other farm produce on the floor below. The
company rose hurriedly to their feet as Patience entered. Grannie Liu, who
recognized her from her last visit, scrambled down from the kang and greeted her at
once as ‘Miss Patience’ without any of the previous time’s confusion.
‘The family all send their regards, Miss. They’d have come themselves long since to
see you and pay their respects to their Aunt Lian, only they’ve been too busy with
the farm-work. Anyways, they’ve had a good harvest this year, thanks be, and it’s
been a good year for the fruit and vegetables. This here that I’ve brought is the first
pickings. We didn’t like to sell them, because we wanted our first-fruits to go to Mrs
Lian and the young ladies. We thought that mayhap eating the rarities of earth and
sea every day of their lives they might sometimes tire of delicate food and fancy a bit
of plain country stuff for a change. Anyway, there you are! It’s a poor gift, but it’s
given with a warm heart!’
‘It’s very good of you to have brought it,’ said Patience, and begged her to be
seated, sitting down herself as she did so. She invited Zhou Rui’s wife and Zhang Cai’s
wife to be seated as well, and ordered one of the junior maids to pour tea.
Mesdames Zhou and Zhang chaffed her on her appear?ance.
‘You’ve got the spring in your face, Miss. Your eyes are all red.’
Patience laughed.
‘I know. I don’t drink normally, but today Mrs Zhou and the young ladies got hold of
me and just forced it down me. I was made to drink, against my will. That’s why my
face is so red.’
‘Well I don’t know,’ said Zhang Cai’s wife. ‘Here’s me just dying for a drink, but
nobody offers me one. Next time anyone invites you, Miss, you must take me with
you.’
The others laughed.
‘I saw those crabs this morning,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Great big things. There
couldn’t have been more than two or three to a catty. And I should think altogether
there must have been seventy or eighty catties in those hampers. Even so,’ she said
reflectively, ‘there probably wouldn’t have been enough for all the staff to have
some.’
‘Lots of them didn’t,’ said Patience. ‘It was only the top ones that got one or two
crabs to themselves. The rest of them only got a taste - some of them not even that.’
‘Good crabs like that are selling at a pennyweight a catty this year,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘If one catty is a pennyweight, fifty catties is two taels ten, and another thirty is one
and ten; ten and two is twelve and twice ten is a tael, that’s thirteen, and then
there’s the wine and the other dishes. It couldn’t have cost less than twenty taels in
all. Bless us and save us that’d keep a farmer and his family for a year!’
‘I take it you’ve already seen Mrs Lian,’ said Patience.
‘Yes,’ said Grannie Lu. ‘She told us to wait.’
She glanced through the open window as she said this and noticed that the day was
drawing on towards evening.
‘It’s getting dark earlier these days,’ she said. ‘We’d better be on our way. We don’t
want to find the city gates shut, or we shall be in a proper pickle.’
‘Just wait while I slip over and find out what the Mistress is up to,’ said Zhou Rui’s
wife. She left the room and was gone for some considerable time. When she
eventually returned, she was full of smiles.
‘It’s Grannie’s lucky day,’ she said. ‘She’s struck lucky with both of them.’
‘How do you mean?’ said Patience.
‘Well,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, ‘Mrs Lian was with Her Old Ladyship when I got there,
so I went up to her and told her on the side that Grannie wanted to go now to make
sure of getting to the gates in time. “Oh” she said, “she came such a long way with all
that stuff. If it’s getting late, she’d better spend the night here and leave tomorrow
morning.” Well, that was one piece of luck; but that’s nothing to what fol?lowed,
because Her Old Ladyship had overheard this and asked her who this “Grannie Liu”
was, and when Mrs Lian told her, she said, “Oh, I’ve been just longing for someone
with a bit of age and experience to talk to! Bring her here! Introduce her to me!”
Now that really was a stroke of luck!’
She urged Grannie Liu to leave her place on the kang and go over to the other
apartment; but the old countrywoman was seized with a sudden attack of shyness.
‘Look at me! Dear soul, I’m in no fit state to see her now! Tell her I’ve already left!’
‘Go on, you go and see her!’ said Patience. ‘It’ll be all right. Our old lady is always
very nice to poor or elderly people She’s not the least bit pretentious or stuck-up like
some I could mention. If you’re nervous about meeting high-ups, Mrs Zhou and I will
go with you to give you confidence.’
She proceeded, with Mrs Zhou’s assistance, to conduct the old woman to her
interview.
When they saw Patience coming out of the courtyard, the pages on duty at the gate
stood up, and two of them came run?ning up to her.
‘Miss! Miss!’
‘What’s it this time?’ said Patience.
‘I’ve been waiting to catch you for hours, Miss,’ said the first of the boys. ‘My ma’s
took ill and I’ve got to go and fetch the doctor for her. Will it be all right if I take the
night off?’
‘You’re a nice lot!’ said Patience. ‘It’s my belief that you’ve got it all worked out
between you so that one of you gets a holiday every day. And instead of telling the
Mistress properly, as you’re supposed to do, you come round to me with these sad
stories and make me take the responsibility. When Stoppo did this the other day, the
Master called for him while he was still away and I got into trouble by speaking jip for
him. The Master accused me of doing favours. And now you want to do the same
thing.’
‘His ma really is ill, Miss,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I’m sure it would be in order for you
to let him go.’
‘All right, then. But mind you’re back first thing tomorrow,’ Patience told the boy.
‘Now you heard that, didn’t you? First thing. Because I’ve got work for you to do. No
lying in bed until you can feel the sun on your backside! And I want you to take a
message to Brightie for me on the way. Tell him the Mistress says that if he hasn’t
handed in the test of that interest by tomorrow, she won’t ask him for it again,
because she’ll know that he’s keeping it for himself.’
The boy promised to deliver the message and scampered off, delighted to be
released.
By the time Patience and her charges arrived at Grand?mother Jia’s apartment, all
the young denizens of Prospect Garden had for some time been assembled there in
attendance, so that as Grannie Liu entered the room, she was confronted by a bevy
of unfamiliar young ladies, all resplendent in orna?ments of pearl and kingfisher, like
a bed of beautiful flowers, none of which she could give a name to. In their midst a
venerable old lady reclined on a couch. A young woman, pretty as a picture and
dressed in silk and satin from top to toe, sat behind her, gently pounding her legs.
Xi-feng, the only person there she could recognize, was standing to one side of her,
evidently in the midst of telling her something amusing. Deducing that the old lady
on the couch must be Grandmother Jia, Grannie Liu hurried up to her and made her
an antique curtsey.
‘Your servant, my lady!’
Grandmother Jia inclined herself politely from the couch and asked Zhou Rui’s wife to
bring up a chair for her to sit on. Ban-er, bashful as ever, would not attempt a
greeting.
‘Now, old kinswoman,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘and what would your age be?’
‘Seventy-five this year,’ said Grannie Liu.
Grandmother Jia turned round to the others present.
‘That’s several years older than me. Fancy still being so fit and lively Heaven only
knows what I shall be like at that age!’
Grannie Liu laughed.
‘I was born for a hard life, d’ye see, just as Your Ladyship was born for a soft one.
We couldn’t all be like Your Ladyship, or there’d be no one to do the farming.’
‘Are your eyes and teeth still good?’ Grandmother Jia asked her.
‘All bar a back tooth on the left-hand side that’s getting a bit loose this year.’
‘There! and I’m already a useless old woman,’ said Grand-mother Jia. ‘Poor eyesight,
poor hearing, memory going — I can’t even remember the names of old kinsfolk like
yourself any longer. I’m scared to meet them when they come visiting, for fear they
might laugh at me. There’s not much I can do nowadays except eat — what I can get
my teeth into — and sleep. Apart from that, I share a joke or two with these young
people when I need a bit of diversion, and that’s about all.’
‘Your Ladyship is lucky,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I couldn’t have such a life if I wanted it.’
‘Lucky? No!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’m just an old crock!’
The others all laughed.
‘Our Feng has been telling me that you’ve brought a lot of fruit and vegetables with
you,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve asked the servants to bring them over. I’m so looking
forward to some nice, fresh farm vegetables. The stuff we buy outside isn’t as tasty
as your home-grown stuff, you know.’
‘That’s the countryman’s idea of a treat,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘He can’t afford meat and
fish, so when he fancies a little luxury, he likes to eat his food fresh from the ground.’


‘Now that you’re one of the family,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘I hope you will stay long
enough to enjoy your visit. Don’t go hurrying back again. Stay here a couple of days
or so, if you can put up with us. We’ve got a garden too, you know, and we grow a
certain amount of fruit in it. Tomorrow you must try some of our stuff and you must
take some back home with you when you go. It will seem more like a proper visit to
rela?tions if you stay a bit, instead of popping in and popping straight out again.’
Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia took pleasure in the old woman’s company
and added her own persuasion.
‘It’s probably not as roomy here as your farmyard, but I expect we’ll manage to
tuck you in somewhere. And you’ll be able to tell our old lady all the village gossip.’
‘Feng!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing in spite of herself. ‘Don’t make fun! She’s a
simple countrywoman. You can’t expect her to stand up to your teasing in the way
that we can.’
She gave orders for Ban-er to be given some sweetmeats. He was unwilling to eat in
front of so many people, however, so she told them to give him some money instead,
and to get some of the younger pages to take him outside to play.
After Grannie Liu had taken tea, she regaled Grandmother Jia with some anecdotes
of village life, thus further endearing herself to her new acquaintance. She was still
holding forth when Xi-feng, who had slipped out some time previously, sent
someone round to invite her back for dinner. Grandmother Jia selected some food
from her own dishes and sent them to Xi-feng’s place for Grannie Liu to try in
addition to what Xi-feng was giving her.
Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia had taken a fancy to the old woman, so after
dinner she sent her back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment. As soon as she arrived,
Faithful ordered some of the older domestics to conduct her to a bath. She herself
went off to fetch her a change of clothes. She selected two fairly modest items from
her own wardrobe and sent them to the bathroom with instructions that Grannie Liu
should change into them after her bath. Such goings-on were outside even the old
grannie’s extensive experience, but she took them all in good part, and having
submitted to the ordeal of the bath, quickly dressed herself in the proffered clothes
and went in to take her place once more beside the couch and resume her role of
raconteuse. In this she was eminently successful, since Bao-yu and the girls, now
seated on all sides around her, found her simple country talk much more fascinating
than any of the fictions told by the blind ballad-singers who sometimes visited the
house.
Indeed, there was more than an element of fiction in what she told them: for
Grannie Liu, though born and bred in the country, was a shrewd old soul to whom
the years had given a pretty good understanding of human weakness, and when she
sensed the old lady’s pleased excitement and the avid atten?tion of her younger
listeners, she did her best not to disappoint them by supplying from her own
invention whatever memory and experience were inadequate to provide.
‘We country-folk working out there on the land — year in, year out, rain or fine,
spring, summer, autumn and winter — we never get any time off,’ she told them. ‘If
we rest, it’s only as you might say ‘napping in harness’, like the old post-horse in the
story. And many a strange happening do we see, out there on the land.
‘Take what happened last winter, for instance. It had been snowing for several days
without a stop and the snow was two or three feet thick on the ground, and this
particular morn?ing I rose up early, and while I was still indoors, I heard the sound of
something stirring outside in the woodpile. I thought to myself, “That’ll be someone
stealing the firewood.” So I put my eye to the hole in the shutter, and sure enough
there was someone there; but it wasn’t anyone from the village.’
‘It was probably some traveller,’ Grandmother Jia inter?rupted. ‘He was feeling cold
and helped himself to a bit to make a fire with, so that he could get warm.’
‘Ah, but it wasn’t a traveller,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘That was the strange thing about it.
Now who do you think it was, my old soul? ’Twas a young woman, seventeen or
eighteen years of age seemingly, pretty as a picture, and with no more on her but a
red dress and a white satin skirt, and the hair on her bare head combed as sleek and
shining as black lacquer paint—’
At that point her story was interrupted by a confused hub?bub of voices outside. One
of them could be heard above the rest saying, ‘It isn’t serious. There’s no point in
frightening Her Old Ladyship.’
‘What is it?’ the old lady asked in some alarm.
‘A fire has broken out in the South Court stables,’ said one of the maids. ‘It isn’t
serious, though. They’ve already got it under control.’
Always the most timorous of mortals where fire was con?cerned, Grandmother Jia
struggled to her feet, and supported by the maids, led the others out onto the loggia
to see what was happening. Somewhere beyond the south-east corner of the
courtyard the glare of flames was still distinctly visible. Terrified out of her wits, she
began calling on the names of the Buddha, and hurriedly sent someone to burn
incense before the image of the Fire God.
By now Lady Wang had arrived with the younger women, and added her voice to the
others’ in assuring the old lady that the fire was well under control and urging her to
go indoors; but Grandmother Jia insisted on staying outside until the last of the
flames had been extinguished.
As soon as they were all inside again, Bao-yu began ques?tioning Grannie Liu about
her interrupted story.
‘Why was the girl out in all that snow stealing firewood?’ he asked her. ‘She might
have caught her death of cold.’
‘For goodness’ sake don’t ask about that!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It was talking
about firewood that started that fire just now. Think of something else to talk about
for goodness’ sake!’
Though privately far from satisfied, Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter rest while
Grannie turned her inventive faculties in another direction.
‘In a farmstead east of ours there was an old dame of more than ninety who had
fasted and prayed to the Buddha every day of her life. At last the Blessed Guanyin
was moved by her prayers and appeared to her one night in a dream. ‘It was to have
been your fate to be cut off without an heir,’ the Blessed Mother told her, ‘but
because of your great piety, I have peti?tioned the Jade Emperor to give you a
grandson.’
‘Now this old dame had an only son, and the son, too, had an only son who in spite
of all their care had died when he was only seventeen or eighteen, to their sore and
bitter grief. But after she had this dream a second grandson was born. He’d be
thirteen or fourteen now — a very handsome lad, with skin as white as snow, and
that sharp and clever you’d hardly credit it. So you see there are gods and Buddhas
watching over us, whatever folk may say!’
The circumstances of this tale so perfectly accorded with the idea they had privately
formed of their own situation, that both the senior ladies in her audience — Lady
Wang no less than Grandmother Jia — were quite captivated by it. But Bao-yu,
whose thoughts were still on the beautiful pilferer of fire?wood, looked glum and
preoccupied. His sister Tan-chun observed this and sought to distract him.
‘We’ve got to make some sort of return for Cousin Shi’s party, Bao. Why don’t we
go back now and discuss when the next poetry meeting is to be? We can have our
party for Cousin Shi at the same time, and Grandma will be able to come and look at
the chrysanthemums.’
‘Grandma’s already promised to give a return party for Cousin Shi herself,’ said
Bao-yu, ‘and we are all invited. We’d better wait until that’s over before putting on
anything of our own.’
‘The longer we delay, the colder the weather will be,’ said Tan-chun. ‘It won’t be
much fun for Grandma if it’s too cold.’
‘But she loves parties when it’s raining or snowing,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t we
wait until the first snowfall and have it then? Call it a snow-viewing party. Think how
romantic: chanting poems in the falling snow!’
‘It would be more romantic still,’ said Dai-yu drily, ‘if instead of chanting poems we
had a big bundle of firewood and took it in turns to tiptoe through the snow and pull
out sticks from it.’
Bao-chai and the other girls all laughed, but Bao-yu stared at Dai-yu rather crossly
and said nothing.
After the company had dispersed, Bao-yu finally managed to get Grannie Liu into a
corner and question her in detail about the mysterious snow maiden. Grannie Liu’s
inventive?ness was once more put to the test.
‘On the embankment that runs along the north side of our land,’ she said, ‘there is
a little shrine. The image inside it is not a god or a Buddha, though. There used at
one time to be a gentleman living in our parts—’
She broke off at this point and appeared to be trying to remember a name.
‘Never mind his name,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Don’t try to remem?ber it. Just tell me what
happened.’
‘This gentleman had no son, but he had an only daughter called — I think it was
Ruo-yu. She could read books as well as any scholar, this Ruo-yu, and the gentleman
loved her more than all the treasure in the world. But sad to say, she took sick and
died when she was only seventeen years old—‘
Bao-yu groaned and stamped his foot.
‘So what happened then?’
‘Because the gentleman loved her so dearly, he had this shrine built for her out in
the fields and had a likeness of her made out of wood and clay to put inside it; and
he arranged for someone to burn incense there and always keep a spark of fire going
inside the burner. But as the years went by, both the gentleman and the people who
used to tend the shrine for him all died, and now the shrine is falling into ruin and
the statue has come to life and started haunting people.’
‘No, no,’ Bao-yu interrupted hurriedly, ‘that wouldn’t be the statue coming to life.
People like that are never really dead, even after they have died.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Fancy that now! And me thinking all along it was
the statue. Well, whatever it is, every so often it takes on human shape and goes
wandering abroad troubling people. And that’s what I saw when I looked out that
time and saw someone taking our firewood. The people in our village are talking of
breaking up the image and knocking the shrine down so as to put a stop to the
haunting.’
‘Good gracious! they mustn’t do that!’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s a terrible sin, knocking a
temple down!’
‘Now I am glad you told me that,’ said Grannie Liu gravely. ‘When I get hack, I shall
do my best to stop them.’
‘My grandmother and Lady Wang and in fact just about everyone in this family is
terribly keen on good works,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There’s nothing they like better than
repairing temples and restoring things. Tomorrow I’ll write out an appeal and collect
some subscriptions for you. You can be the fund’s Treasurer, and when we’ve got
enough money together, you can supervise the restoration, And I’ll get them to send
you some money every month for incense, How would that be?’
‘Statue or spirit or whatever she is,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘I shall certainly be grateful to
her for the money.’
Bao-yu pressed her for the names of the nearest farms and villages and the exact
location of the shrine in relation to them as well as the distance to it and the general
direction in which it lay. Answering all these questions with whatever came first into
her head, Grannie Liu supplied a set of fictitious direc?tions which Bao-yu, believing
them to be genuine, carefully committed to memory and carried back to his room,
where he lay awake half the night planning what he would do for the beautiful
wood-thief in the days ahead.
He went out of the Garden first thing next morning, and handing Tealeaf a few
hundred cash, told him the directions for getting to the shrine as given him by
Grannie Liu the night before, and instructed him to follow them, inspect the shrine,
and report back on what he saw. He would await Tea-leaf’s report before deciding
what to do next.
But once Tealeaf had gone he found the waiting very tedious, and as the day wore on
and Tealeaf still failed to return, he became as fidgety as a worm on hot earth. He
was obliged to wait until sundown before Tealeaf finally came back. When he did,
however, he was looking extremely pleased with himself.
‘You managed to find it then?’ Bao-yu asked him eagerly. ‘Yes,’ said Tealeaf, smiling
broadly, ‘but you couldn’t have heard the directions right. I had a terrible job finding
it. The place where it is and the way to it are nothing like you said. That’s why I took
so long. I was all day looking for it. In the end I found that there is a ruined temple in
that area, but it’s not where you said: it’s at the east end of the north embank?ment,
on a corner.’
Bao-yu’s face beamed with pleasure.
‘ Grannie Liu’s a very old woman,’ he said. ‘It’s quite pos?sible that she
misremembered when she gave me those direc?tions. Anyway, tell me what you
saw.’
‘The temple was south-facing, like you said,’ Tealeaf re?plied, ‘and it was in a very
tumble-down condition. I’d been searching neatly all day by then, so of course when I
saw that, I was very relieved and hurried straight inside. But oh lot! when I looked at
the image, I was so scared I hurried straight out again it was so real!’
Bao-yu laughed delightedly.
‘Of course. If she’s capable of coming to life, you’d expect a certain liveliness in the
Statue.’
‘She?’ said Tealeaf. ‘This was no she. It was an ugly great Plague God with a blue
face and red hair!’
‘Useless dolt!’ said Bao-yu angrily. ‘You can’t even do a simple little errand like this
for me.’
‘That’s most unfair,’ said Tealeaf in a deeply aggrieved tone of voice. ‘You send me
off on a wild-goose chase to look for something you’ve read about in some book or
other or heard about in some old-wives’ tale, and then when I can’t find it (because
there’s probably no such thing any way) you start abusing me.’
Bao-yu saw that he had hurt his feelings, and hastened to comfort him.
‘There, there, don’t be upset! Some time when you’re not too busy you shall have
another look for it. If the old woman is deceiving us, you naturally won’t be able to
find it. But if there really is such a place and you do, then you will have a share in the
merit when it’s restored. And of course, I shall give you a very big reward.’
While he was talking to Tealeaf, one of the pages from the inner gate came up and
said that ‘one of the young ladies from Her Old Ladyship’s room’ was at the gate
asking for Master Bao.
Who it was and what she wanted will be revealed in the fol?lowing chapter.




CHAPTER 40

Lady Jia holds two feasts in one day in the Prospect Garden
And Faithful makes four calls on three dominoes in the
Painted Chamber



HEARING that he was wanted, Bao-yu hurried to the gate of the inner mansion.
Amber was standing in front of the screen-wall waiting for him.
‘Hurry! You’re holding everyone up. There’s something they want to talk to you
about,’ she said.
In fact, when he arrived at his grandmother’s room, she and his mother and the girls
were already discussing it ‘it’ being the question of what arrangements they should
make for the return party for Shi Xiang-yun.
‘I’ll tell you what to do,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Since there won’t be any outsiders at this
party, instead of having a fixed menu and formally-laid tables, why not get them to
do one or two of everyone’s favourite dishes, put them in those lacquer food-boxes
that have different compartments for the different dishes, and serve them on little
individual tables with a “self-service” wine-kettle each, so that everyone can pour
their own wine? I’m sure that would be jollier than a formal party.’
Grandmother Jia was much taken with this proposal and at once sent orders to the
kitchen to do as he had suggested.
‘Tell them that tomorrow we want them to choose some of the things they know
we like and put them in boxes - one box for each of us. And tell them that we shall
want lunch served in the Garden tomorrow as well.’
The lamps had by now been lit. Of the night which followed our record gives no
account.
Rising early next morning, they were delighted to observe that it was going to be a
beautiful clear, autumn day. Li Wan was among the earliest up, and at once began to
supervise the older women and maids in sweeping up fallen leaves, polish?ing chairs
and tables, and getting ready the sets of teacups, winecups and so forth that would
be needed for the party. Xi-feng’s maid Felicity, accompanied by Grannie Lin and little
Ban-er, arrived while they were in the midst of this activity.
‘You are very busy, Mrs Zhu,’ said Grannie Liu.
Li Wan smiled.
‘I told you you’d never get away! You kept saying yesterday that you had to go, but I
knew they wouldn’t let you.’
‘It was Her Old Ladyship that kept me,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘She said she wanted me to
enjoy meself for a day or two be?fore I went back.’
Felicity produced several large keys.
‘Mrs Lian says the little tables already in use may not he enough and we’d better
open the upstairs storeroom and get some more out, just for today. She meant to
come over herself and see to it, but she’s with Her Ladyship at the moment and can t
get away, so she says would you mind Opening the store?room for her and getting
some of the servants to carry them down?’
Li Wan sent Candida to the storeroom with the keys and told one of the old women
to go to the inner gate and get some of the pages on duty there to help with the
carrying. She herself went and stood in the courtyard behind Prospect Hall and
watched from below while the Painted Chamber was opened up and the tables were
one by one carried down from it. The team of maids, pages and old nannies worked
together with such enthusiasm that soon more than twenty of the little tables had
been manhandled downstairs into the courtyard.
‘Gently now, gently!’ said Li Wan as they were moving them. ‘No need to go at it as
if all the devils in hell were after you! You’ll chip the edges off them if you’re not
careful.’
She turned to Grannie Liu.
‘Wouldn’t you like to go up and have a look?’
The old woman needed no second asking. Holding Ban-er tightly by the hand, she
scrambled up the stairway and looked inside. The interior was stacked high with
folding screens, tables, chairs, lanterns and furniture of every kind. Much of what she
saw she could not identify, but the dull gleam of gold, the rich glow of coloured
lacquers, and the artistry and sump?tuousness of the objects drew many a pious
ejaculation from her before she descended. The door of the storeroom was then
locked and the remaining maids came down.
‘I wonder how energetic Lady Jia will be feeling today,’ said Li Wan. ‘Perhaps while
you are about it you had better get out the oars and punt-poles and paddles and
some boat-awnings as well, in case she decides to go on the water.’
‘Yes’m,’ said the maids, and proceeded to unlock the store?room again and carry
down the items specified. Li Wan mean?while sent one of the pages to tell the
boatwomen that they were to pole a couple of punts out from the boathouse and
have them by in readiness.
While this activity was still in progress, Grandmother Jia arrived at the head of a
troupe of females. Li Wan hurried for?ward to greet her.
‘You are very energetic this morning, Grandmother; I didn’t expect you in the
Garden so soon. I was hoping that you would still be doing your hair. I’ve picked some
chrysan?themums for you to wear and I was just about to send them round to you.’
Even as she was saying this, Casta arrived carrying a large dish of peacock-green glaze
shaped like a lotus-leaf, in which chrysanthemum-flowers of many different colours
were being kept in moisture. Grandmother Jia chose a dark red one to fasten in the
side of her hair. As she turned her head to do so, she caught sight of Grannie Liu and
smiled at her in welcome.
‘Come over here! You must have one too!’
Before she had finished, Xi-feng had already seized the old woman by the hand and
was dragging her over.
‘Come on, let me dress you up properly!’
She began sticking the chrysanthemums into her hair, put?ting them in at every angle,
and continued until all the flowers in the dish had been used up. The effect was so
ludicrous that Grandmother Jia and the rest all burst out laughing. Grannie Liu, not a
whit perturbed, good-humouredly joined in the laughter.
‘I don’t know what my poor old head can have done to deserve so much honour,’
she said.
‘You ought to pull them out and throw them in her lace,’ said the others. ‘She’s
made you look like an old vamp!’
‘I may be getting on now,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘but I used to be a stylish young woman
in my time. I loved to have a bit of powder for my cheek and a flower to wear in my
hair. ‘Tis no matter: now I shall be a stylish old ‘un.’
During this exchange they had been moving towards Drenched Blossoms Pavilion.
Maids went on ahead with a rolled-up patterned rug which they spread out on one of
the bench-boards that ran along the inner sides of the balustrades. Seating herself on
the rug with her back against the railings, Grandmother Jia invited Grannie Liu to sit
down beside her and tell her what she thought of the Garden.
‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘You know, we country folk like to get a picture at
the New Year that we can stick up on the wall. Every year just before New Year the
farmers come into town to buy one. Many’s the time of an evening when the day’s
work was done we’ve sat and looked at the picture on our wall and wished we could
get inside it and walk around, never imagining that such beautiful places could really
be. Yet now I look at this Garden here, and it’s ten times better than any picture I
ever saw. If only I could get someone to make a painting of it all, just the way it is,
that I could take back to show the others, I do believe I should die content!’
Grandmother Jia smilingly pointed a linger in Xi-chun direction.
‘You see my little great-niece over there? She can paint. Shall we get her to do you
a painting of it?’
Grannie Liu jumped up and going over to Xi-chun, took her impulsively by the hand.
‘Dear Miss!’ she said. ‘To think that one so young and pretty should be so gifted
and all! I do believe you must be one of the holy spirits born in a human shape!’
The simple earnestness with which this was uttered made the others all laugh. After
resting a little longer, Grandmother Jia, who intended to show her guest as much of
the Garden as possible, got up again and resumed the tour.
The first place they came to was the Naiad’s House. The green bamboos engulfed
them as they entered the gate and brilliant green moss carpeted the ground beneath.
Through the midst of the bamboos a raised cobbled path wound its way towards the
house. Grannie Liu stepped aside to let Grandmother Jia and the rest walk on it while
she herself walked on the ground below. Amber held a hand out to draw her up.
‘Walk on the path, Grannie! You’ll slip on the moss down there.’
‘Don’t you mind me, my dear!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’m used to it. You keep to the
path, though, with the rest. You don’t want to muddy those fancy shoes of yours.’
Unfortunately the necessity of looking up to talk to some?one who was walking at a
higher level had distracted her attention from the ground beneath, and even as she
said this, her feet slipped on the treacherous moss, her legs flew out from under her,
and she landed on her posterior with a thump. The girls clapped their hands
delightedly. Grandmother Jia laughed too, though trying her hardest to sound cross.
‘Little monsters!’ she said, ‘Don’t just stand there laughing. Help her up!’
But Grannie Liu bad already scrambled up unaided, and was laughing herself.
‘It serves me right,’ she said. ‘I shouldn’t have spoken so soon!’
‘Are you sure you haven’t hurt your back?’ Grandmother Jia asked her. ‘Let one of
the maids massage it for you.’
‘God bless my soul!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’m not that deli?cate! I don’t suppose a day
goes by but what I take a tumble or two. If I was to have meself massaged every time,
it would never
Nightingale was already waiting with the bamboo blind raised for them to enter.
Grandmother Jia led her party through the doorway and sat down inside. Dai-yu
waited on her in person; offering her tea in a covered cup which she carried on a
little tray.
‘We shan’t be taking tea, niece,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Don’t bother to pour for the rest
of us.’
Hearing this, Dai-yu ordered one of the maids to fetch the chair by the window that
she normally sat on herself and bring it up for her aunt to sit on. Grannie Liu noticed
the inkstone and brushes on the table in front of it and all the books on the
bookshelves and said that she supposed this must be ‘the young gentleman’s study’.
Grandmother Jia smiled and pointed to Dai-yu.
‘It belongs to her - my little granddaughter.’
As though incredulous, Grannie Liu studied Dai-yu atten?tively for some moments in
silence.
‘It doesn’t look at all like a young lady’s room,’ she said finally. ‘It looks to me like a
very high-class young gentleman’s study.’
‘Where is Bao-yu, by the way?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘He’s on the lake in one of the punts,’ said the maids.
‘Oh? Whose idea was it to get the punts out?’ she asked.
‘It was my idea,’ said Li Wan hurriedly. ‘It occurred to me just now when we were
getting things out of the storeroom that you might perhaps feel like going on the
water today.’
Grandmother Jia was about to make some comment when Aunt Xue’s arrival was
announced and she rose up, together with the rest of the company, to welcome her.
‘Aren’t you energetic today, Lady Jia!’ said Aunt Xue smilingly when all were seated
once more. ‘Here already!’
‘We were just discussing what sort of fine to impose on late arrivals,’ said
Grandmother Jia teasingly. ‘We didn’t have you in mind, of course!’
A certain amount of good-humoured banter followed. In the course of it
Grandmother Jia chanced to notice that the gauze in Dai-yu’s windows was faded,
and drew Lady Wang’s attention to it.
‘This kind of gauze looks very well on a window when it’s new,’ she said, ‘but after a
while it loses its greenness. Green isn’t a suitable colour for the windows here in any
case. There are no peach or apricot trees outside to make a contrast when they are in
flower, and there is already enough green in all those bamboos. I seem to remember
that we used to have four or five different shades of window gauze somewhere or
other.
You must look some out tomorrow for her and have this changed.’
‘The other day when I had to open the silk-store,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I came across a lot
of rose-coloured “cicada wing” gauze in a long wooden chest. It was a beautiful fresh
colour and the material was beautifully soft and light. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any
quite like it before. I’d like to have taken a couple of lengths of it for facing quilts with.
I’m sure it would make lovely quilts.’
‘Pooh!’ said Grandmother Jia scornfully. ‘I thought you were supposed to be such
an authority on materials — and you can’t even name a gauze properly! You’re not as
clever as you thought, my girl! You’ll have to watch your tongue a bit in future.’
Aunt Xue put in an extenuating word for her niece, while laughing with the rest at
her discomfiture.
‘However much of an authority she may be, I’m sure she would never presume to
compete with you, Lady Jia. If she is wrong about the gauze, you must give her the
benefit of your greater experience and put her right. I am sure the rest of us would
like to know too.’
‘As a matter of fact that gauze is a good deal older than any of you here,’ said
Grandmother Jia, ‘so it is not very surpris?ing that Feng mistook it for cicada wing.
There is a certain resemblance, and cicada wing is what anyone would most likely
take it to be who hadn’t seen it before. The proper name for it, though, is “haze
diaphene”.’
‘What a pretty name!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I must have seen several hundred different
gauzes in my time; but I must con?fess I’ve never heard that name mentioned
before.’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘And what great age have you now reached, my dear, to be talking so freely about
your vast experience? Haze diaphene used to come in four colours: “clear-sky blue”,
“russet green”, “pine green” and “old rose”. Hung up as bed-curtains or pasted in
windows it looks from a distance like a coloured haze. That’s why they called it “haze
diaphene”. The old rose kind is sometimes called “afterglow”. You won’t find fabric
made as fine or as soft as that nowadays, not even among the gauzes made for the
Imperial Household.’
‘Never mind about Feng,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘I’ve never heard about this kind of gauze
before either.’
While they continued to talk about it, Xi-feng sent someone to fetch a piece from the
storeroom.
‘That’s right, that’s it!’ said Grandmother Jia when it arrived. ‘When we first had it,
we used it only for covering windows with, but later on we began experimenting and
found that it made very good quilts and bed-curtains as well. Get a few lengths of it
out tomorrow. You can use the “old rose” kind to re-cover these windows with.’
Xi-feng promised to see to it. Meanwhile the others were examining the gauze and
admiring its quality. Grannie Liu was particularly impressed, uttering a whole series of
‘Holy Names’ as she subjected it to close and careful scrutiny. ‘I could never hope to
get anything as good as this to make a dress with,’ she said. ‘It seems a terrible waste
to use it on windows.’
‘Actually it isn’t much good for clothing,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘What about this, then?’ said Xi-feng, pulling out a flap of the quilted crimson gauze
dress she was wearing underneath her jacket and holding it up for them to see.
‘Yes, very fine,’ said Grandmother Jia, examining it. ‘Ah, yes, now there you are!
This is a modern Imperial Household gauze; but you see it’s still not as good as that
one there.’
‘Well, what do you make of that?’ said Xi-feng. ‘That one there is only an “Official
Use” fabric, yet this one I’m wear?ing, which isn’t as good quality, is “Imperial
Household” !’
‘Anyway, have another look tomorrow,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I think you’ll find
that besides the “old rose” pieces you saw in that chest, there’s a lot of “clear-sky
blue” somewhere as well. If there is, get it all out; give a length of it to our
kins?woman here; I should like two lengths myself for a set of bed-hangings; and any
left over can be matched with suitable lining-material and made up into waistcoats
for the girls. There’s no point in keeping it until it gets mildewed.’
Xi-feng, having first promised that she would do all these things, told the servant who
had brought the sample to take it back to the storeroom.
‘We’re a bit cramped in here,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s move on to somewhere
else now.’
‘They say that “great families live in great houses”,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘and truly,
when I first went into Your Lady?ship’s apartment yesterday and saw those great
chests and cupboards and tables and beds, the size of everything fairly took my
breath away. That great wardrobe of yours is higher and wider than one of our rooms
back home. I’m not sur?prised you keep a ladder in the back courtyard. When I first
saw it, I thought to myself, “Now what can they need a ladder for? They don’t ripen
things on the roofs as we do, so it can’t be for that.” And then of course I realized: it
must be for getting things out of the compartment on top of that ward-robe of yours,
for you could never reach it else. And yet this place here, for all it’s so much smaller,
seems to me more per?fect than your big one. The things here are all so pretty. I
don’t know what they are, some of them, but the more I look at them, the less I want
to leave!’
‘There are other pretty places besides this,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We’re taking you to see
them all.’
As they left the Naiad’s House, they could make out, at some distance from where
they stood, a number of people punting on the lake. Remarking that since the boats
were al?ready out they might just as well use them, Grandmother Jia conducted her
little party in the general direction of Amaryllis Eyot and Flowery Harbour. Before
they had reached the water’s edge, however, a number of elderly women
ap?proached, each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they
make in Soochow, with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately
patterned in needle-en?graving of gold, and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in
their sides. Seeing them approach, Xi-feng asked Lady Wang where she wanted lunch
to be laid.
‘Ask Grandmother,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Wherever she wants it, of course.’
Grandmother Jia, who had been moving on, now turned back to tell them.
‘Your Cousin Tan’s would be a nice place to have it. You go on ahead and lay it there,
and the rest of us will follow by boat.’
Xi-feng, accompanied by Li Wan, Tan-chun, Faithful and Amber, led the women with
the lunch-boxes by a short cut to the Autumn Studio. They put out a couple of tables
there in the Paulownia Room.
‘We’re often hearing how the gentlemen at their parties outside have a buffoon to
provide them with their laughs,’ said Faithful while they were getting ready. ‘Today
we’ve got a buffoon of our own — a female one.’
Li Wan, being a good, simple soul, did not understand what she meant; but Xi-feng
knew immediately that she was referring to Grannie Liu and gleefully agreeing that
they should have some laughs at the old woman’s expense, at once began plotting
something with Faithful.
‘You two are awful!’ Li Wan protested laughingly. ‘Anyone would think you were a
couple of mischievous children. And what will Lady Jia say?’
‘Don’t worry, Mrs Zhu!’ said Faithful. ‘You won’t be involved in this one little bit. I
promise to keep you out of it.’
Grandmother Jia now arrived with the others, the company sat down informally, and
maids went round and served every one with tea. When they had all finished their
tea, Xi-feng came in carrying a bundle of silver-tipped and silver-ornamented ebony
chopsticks wrapped in a West Ocean linen napkin, and proceeded to lay the places.
‘Put that little yellow cedar-wood table next to my place so that Mrs Liu can sit by
me,’ said Grandmother Jia.
As the maids hastened to comply, Xi-feng tipped a wink at Faithful, who took the
opportunity presented by this diver?sion to draw Grannie Lu aside and quietly brief
her on the decorums to be observed by anyone eating with the family.
‘It’s part of the rules of this household,’ she told tile old woman in conclusion. ‘If
you don’t do it properly, they will laugh at you.’
The places being now all laid, the company sat down to table, with the exception of
Aunt Xue, who had eaten already and continued sitting where she was, drinking tea.
Bao-yu, Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-chai sat at one of the two large tables with
Grandmother Jia at their head, and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat at the other
one, presided over by Lady Wang. Grannie Liu had a little table of her own next to
Grandmother Jia.
Normally when Grandmother Jia took her meals it was the junior maids who stood
with spittoons, fly-whisks and napkins in their hands behind the chairs. Faithful had
long since graduated from such menial duties. On this occasion, how?ever, she
borrowed a fly-whisk from one of the younger girls and did some whisking herself.
This was a signal for the other maids, who knew that something was afoot, to melt
discreetly away, leaving the stage clear for Faithful. Fly-whisk in hand, Faithful took
up a position on her own and darted a question?ing glance at her victim.
‘All right, Miss, don’t worry!’ said Grannie Liu, and hav?ing settled herself in her
place, picked up her chopsticks. She found them extremely heavy and unwieldy. They
were a pair of old-fashioned, square-handled ivory ones inlaid with gold, which
Xi-feng and Faithful had planted on her in furtherance of their plan.
‘What’s this you’ve given me?’ said Grannie Liu. ‘A pair of tongs? These are heavier
than one of our iron shovels. I shall never be able to manage with these.’
The others all laughed.
A woman-servant now entered carrying one of the luncheon?boxes and stood in the
middle of the room holding it while a maid removed the lid. There were two dishes
inside. Li Wan took out one of them and set it down on Grandmother Jia’s table. The
second, a bowl of pigeon’s eggs (deliberately chosen for their mirth-provoking
possibilities) was taken out by Xi-feng and set down in front of Grannie Liu.
‘Please!’ said Grandmother Jia, waving her chopsticks at the food as a polite
indication that they should begin. At once Grannie Liu leaped to her feet and, in
ringing tones, recited the following grace:
     ‘My name it is Liu,
     I’m a trencherman true;
     I can eat a whole sow
     With her little pigs too.’

Having concluded, she puffed out both her cheeks and stared in front of her with an
expression of great determina?tion.
There was a moment of awestruck silence; then, as it dawned on them that they
really had heard what they thought they had heard, the whole company, both
masters and ser?vants, burst out into roars of laughter.
Shi Xiang-yun, unable to contain herself, spat out a whole mouthful of rice.
Lin Dai-yu, made breathless by laughter, collapsed on the table, uttering weak ‘Aiyos’.
Bao-yu rolled over, convulsed, on to his grandmother’s bosom.
Grandmother Jia, exclaiming helplessly ‘Oh, my heart!’ ‘Oh, my child!’, clung tightly to
her heaving grandson.
Lady Wang pointed an accusing finger at Xi-feng, but laughter had deprived her of
speech.
Aunt Xue exploded a mouthful of tea over Tan-chun’s skirt.
Tan-chun planted a bowlful of rice on the person of Ying-?chun.
Xi-chun got up from the table and going over to her nurse, took her by the hand and
asked her to massage her stomach.
The servants were all doubled up. Some had to go outside where they could squat
down and laugh with abandon. Those who could control themselves sufficiently
helped the casual?ties to mop up or change their clothes.
Only Xi-feng and Faithful remained straight-faced through?out this outburst, politely
urging Grannie Liu to begin. Mani?pulating the unwieldy chopsticks with
considerable difficulty, the old woman prepared to do so.
‘Even your hens here are special,’ she remarked. ‘Such pretty little eggs they lay! I
must see if I can’t get one of these under me belt!’
Under the impact of these remarks the company’s composure, which it had only just
recovered, once more broke down. Grandmother Jia, abandoning any attempt at
self-control, was now actually weeping with laughter. Amber, who feared a seizure,
pounded her energetically on the back.
‘That wicked devil Feng is behind this,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t believe a thing
she tells you!’
‘They cost a silver tael apiece,’ said Xi-feng, as Grannie Liu continued to praise the
diminutive ‘hen’s’ eggs. ‘You should eat them quickly, while they’re still hot. They
won’t be so nice when they’re cold.’
Grannie Liu obediently held out her chopsticks and tried to take hold of one, but the
egg eluded her. After chasing it several times round the inside of the bowl, she did at
last suc?ceed in getting a grip on it. But as she craned forward with open mouth to
reach it, it slipped through the chopsticks and rolled on to the floor. At once she laid
down the chopsticks, and would have gone down on hands and knees to pick it up,
but before she could do so one of the servants had retrieved it and carried it off for
disposal.
‘That’s a tael of silver gone,’ Grannie Liu said regretfully, ‘and we didn’t even hear
the clink!’
The others had by now lost all interest in eating, absorbed by the entertaining antics
of their guest.
‘Who got those chopsticks out?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘They’re not meant for
occasions like this; they’re for using at formal banquets. Whoever it was, I expect it
was that wicked Feng who put them up to it. Take them away at once and get her
another pair!’
The servants had in point of fact had nothing to do with the chryselephantine
chopsticks, which had been smuggled in at the last moment by Faithful and Xi-feng;
nevertheless, on hearing the order, they obediently came forward and replaced them
with a silver and ebony pair like those that had been provided for the rest.
‘Out goes gold and in comes silver!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But when all’s said and done,
our wooden ones at home are han?dier.’
‘If there’s any poison in what you are eating,’ said Xi-feng, ‘the silver will tell you by
changing colour.’
‘If this food is poisoned,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘then what we eat at home must be pure
arsenic. Anyway, I intend to eat it all, come what may!’
Delighted to have found someone who, besides being so amusing, had so evident a
relish for her food, Grandmother Jia insisted on making all her own portion over to
Grannie Liu and ordered one of the older women to go round with a pair of
chopsticks and a bowl and make a selection from all the dishes to give to little Ban-er.
Presently, when they had finished eating, Grandmother Jia and the others moved
into Tan-chun’s bedroom for a chat, while in the Paulownia Room the servants
cleared away the remains of the meal and hastily relaid a table for Li Wan and Xi-feng.
Grannie Liu, who had lingered behind, observed them sitting down at opposite sides
of it to begin their meal. She was greatly impressed by this glimpse of the upper-class
etiquette which requires young married women to eat on their own when the rest
have finished.
‘What I like best of all here,’ she said, ‘is your way of doing things. I’m not surprised
they say that “good breeding is to be found in great houses”.’
The compliment was sincerely meant, but Xi-feng under?stood it in a different sense.
‘I do hope we haven’t hurt your feelings,’ she said. ‘It was only a joke, you know.’
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Faithful came hurrying in.
‘Please don’t be offended, Mrs Liu. I’ve come in to apolo?gize.’
‘Bless you, I’m not offended!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘We were only cheering up Her
Ladyship, dear old soul. What should I be offended for? I knew when you told me to
say those things it was only for a laugh. If I’d felt offended, I should never have said
them.’
A chastened Faithful turned angrily on the other servants. ‘Come on! Why aren’t you
pouring Mrs Liu some tea?’ ‘That’s all right,’ said Grannie Liu hurriedly. ‘I’ve had some
already. I drank the tea that the young woman handed to me a while ago. You get on
with your own lunch, Miss. Don’t mind me!’
Xi-feng took Faithful by the hand.
‘Yes, eat now with us. It’ll keep you out of mischief.’ Faithful sat down and one of
the old women laid another bowl for her and another pair of chopsticks. When the
three young women had finished, Grannie Liu, who had been watching them,
remarked on how little they had eaten.
‘None of you here seems to eat more than a bite or two,’ she said. ‘It’s a marvel to
me you’re not famished. No wonder you all look as if the wind could blow you over!’
‘There is a lot left over today,’ Faithful commented. ‘Where are all the others?’ she
asked the old serving-woman.
‘They’re still here in waiting, Miss,’ said the old woman. ‘They’re not off duty yet.
We can give it to them, if you like, before they go.’
‘They’ll never finish all this lot,’ said Faithful. ‘Pick out a couple of bowlfuls and take
them to Patience in Mrs Lian’s room.’
‘No need,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She’s had her lunch already.’
‘If she can’t eat it herself, she can give it to the cat,’ said Faithful.
The old woman put the contents of two of the dishes into a box and carried it off to
give Patience.
‘Where’s Candida?’ said Faithful.
‘She’s in there eating with the rest,’ said Li Wan. ‘What do you want her for?’
‘It’s all right,’ said Faithful. ‘Nothing.’
‘Aroma isn’t here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why don’t you send her a couple of dishes?’
Faithful gave orders for this to be done. She inquired of the remaining old women
whether the boxes for the drinking party were ready yet.
‘I think they’ll be a while yet,’ said one of them.
‘Hurry them up a bit, will you?’ said Faithful, and the old woman went off to do her
bidding.
The young women, accompanied by Grannie Liu, now went into Tan-chun’s room,
where Grandmother Jia and the others were chatting and laughing together.
This room, a three-frame apartment which Tan-chun, who loved spaciousness, had
left undivided, had in the midst of it a large rosewood table with a Yunnanese marble
top piled high with specimen-books of calligraphy and littered with several dozen
miscellaneous ink-stones and a small forest of writing-brushes standing in
brush-holders and brush-stands of every conceivable shape and size. On one side of
the table was a bucket-sized ‘pincushion’ flower-vase of Ru ware stuck all over with
snow-white pompom chrysanthemums. On the west wall of the room hung a
‘Landscape in Mist and Rain’ by Mi Fei, flanked by a pair of scrolls bearing a couplet
written by the Tang calligrapher Yan Zhen-qing:

   My heart has discovered true ease amidst the clouds and mists of the
mountains;
   My life has gained a fierce freedom from the rocks and torrents of the fells.

Against the wall beneath was a long, high table. On it, to?wards the left, stood a large
Northern Song porcelain dish heaped with those ornamental citrus fruits they call
‘Buddha’s hands’, whose brilliant yellow contrasted agreeably with the greenish blue
of the glaze. To the right a white jade chime in the form of a two-headed fish hung in
a varnished wooden frame to whose side a tiny hammer was attached. Ban-er, whom
growing familiarity was making bolder, was with diffi?culty restrained from
unfastening the hammer and striking the fish with it. He then said that he wanted
one of the ‘yellow things’ to eat, and Tan-chun selected a Buddha’s hand from the
dish and gave it to him.
‘There you are,’ she said, ‘but it’s only to play with. It isn’t good to eat.’
On the opposite side of the room was a large four-poster bed whose silk gauze
hangings had a pattern of bright green plants and insects in reversible embroidery.
Ban-er ran over to it and began identifying the insects:
‘That’s a cricket. That’s a grasshopper
Grannie Liu dealt him a hefty slap:
‘Little varmint! Who said you could go running around putting your dirty hands on
everything? Just because you’ve been allowed in to have a look, it doesn’t mean you
have to start getting above yourself.’
The blow had been hard enough to make him cry, and it took the combined efforts of
the others present to comfort him.
Meanwhile Grandmother Jia had been looking through the gauze-covered windows
into the courtyard behind.
‘Those paulownias by the verandah eaves are still very fine,’ she remarked. ‘It’s a
pity they’ve begun losing their leaves.’
A little gust of wind blew across the courtyard as she spoke, bearing on it a faint
strain of music from outside.
‘That must be a wedding,’ she said. ‘I didn’t realize we were so near to the street
here.’
‘You could never hear the street from here, Mother,’ said Lady Wang, laughing.
‘Those are our twelve little actresses rehearsing.’
‘If they’re going to be playing anyway,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘we may as well have
them to play in here. It will be entertainment for us and it will make an outing of
sorts for them.’
Xi-feng at once ordered the troupe to be summoned, and made hurried
arrangements for a long table to be brought in, that the actresses could sit down to
perform at, and covered with a red rug.
‘Much better put them in Xi-chun’s water pavilion,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The
music will sound even better coming across the water. Later on when we take our
wine we can sit in the downstairs of the Painted Chamber. It’s nice and open there
and close enough to the pavilion for listening to the music from.’
Everyone agreed that this would be a good idea.
Grandmother Jia now turned with a smile to Aunt Xue.
‘I think we’d better be on our way now. These young people don’t much like having
visitors, you know. They are terrified of getting their rooms dirty. We mustn’t be
tactless and overstay our welcome. I think we’d better take another little turn in the
boats now, and then it will be just about time to go and have our drinks.’
‘How unfair!’ said Tan-chun laughing. ‘When I ask you or Mother or Aunt Xue to
come here, you never do.’
‘Oh, my little Tan is all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s those two Yus who are so
detestable. We shall go and brawl in their rooms later on when we are drunk!’
The others (including the detestable Yus) all laughed.
Emerging in a single group from the Autumn Studio, they arrived after a short walk at
Duckweed Island, where their specially imported Soochow boatwomen were waiting
with two elegantly decorated punts. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Grannie
Liu, Faithful and Silver were handed one by one aboard the first one. They were
joined a little later by Li Wan, and finally by Xi-feng, who stood in the bows and said
she was going to punt.
‘Feng!’ Grandmother Jia called nervously from inside the cabin. ‘It’s too dangerous
to fool about. It isn’t like the open river here, but it’s still quite deep. Come in here
with us!’
‘It’s all right, Grannie! Don’t be nervous!’ said Xi-feng, laughing, as she shoved off
from the bank. But the punt, being somewhat overloaded, was hard to manage, so
that by the time they were in midstream she was already in difficulties and had to
hand the pole over to one of the boatwomen and sit down rather abruptly on her
haunches.
When their elders were safely away, Bao-yu and the six girls got into the second punt
and were poled along in the wake of the first one. The maids and older women
proceeded in the same direction on foot along the shore.
These raggedy-looking lotus-leaves everywhere are rather ugly,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t
think why they haven’t been cleared away.’
‘Now when could they have been?’ said Bao-chai. ‘With parties being held here
practically every day this autumn, the Garden has never been free long enough.’
‘I can’t abide the poems of Li Shang-yin,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but there is just one line of
his that I am rather fond of:

Leaves but dead lotus-leaves for the rain to play on.

Trust you not to “leave the dead lotus-leaves”!’
‘It is a good line, I agree,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ll tell them that in future they are not to
remove them.’
They were drifting into Flowery Harbour now, and the dank chill of its creeper-hung
grotto seemed to penetrate their bones. Dead reeds and dying caltrop-leaves added
to the autumnal melancholy of the scene. A clean, airy-looking build?ing was visible
at some distance beyond the bank above.
‘Isn’t that Bao-chai’s place?’ said Grandmother Jia.
On being told that it was, she asked the women to moor the boats there, and having
disembarked, ascended from the landing-stage by a flight of cloud-shaped stone
steps and proceeded, with the rest of the party, to the gateway of Allspice Court.
A delectable fragrance assailed their nostrils as they en?tered. Outside the house the
leaves of the mysterious, un?namable creepers had turned an even intenser green in
the colder weather, and where before there had been flowers, there now hung
trusses of the most beautiful coral-red berries. Indoors, however, it was stark and
bare. The only decoration in Bao-chai’s room was a vase of the cheaper kind of Ding
ware on the table, with a few chrysanthemums in it. Apart from the flowers there
were only a few books and some tea?-things on the table. The bed-hangings were of
black gauze, and the quilts and covers were of the same forbidding plain?ness as the
hangings.
‘This child is really too self-effacing!’ Grandmother Jia mut?tered, evidently
shocked by what she saw. The tone in which she addressed Bao-chai was a somewhat
reproachful one: ‘If you haven’t any things of your own, why ever didn’t you as your
Aunt Wang for some? I’m afraid I never thought about it before. Of course. I realize
now. You must have left all your stuff behind in Nanking.’
She at once ordered Faithful to supply Bao-chai with some Ornaments, and then
turned, with some asperity, on Xi-feng.
‘Really, Feng! I do think it rather stingy of you! Couldn’t you have spared your
cousin a few knick-knacks?’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng both laughed.
‘She said herself that she didn’t want any. We gave her some things, but she sent
them all back again.’
Aunt Xue corroborated this.
‘She was just the same in Nanking, Lady Jia. She’s never cared much for that sort of
thing.’
Grandmother Jia shook her head.
‘That will never do. It saves trouble, no doubt, to keep one’s room so bare. But
what would any of our relations think if they were to come here and see this?
Besides, it isn’t natural for a young girl to be so austere. If girls are to live so austerely,
what sort of a stable ought an old woman like me to live in? Think of the descriptions
of young ladies’ boudoirs you find in plays and romances such exquisite refinement
of luxury! I’m not exactly suggesting that you should emulate them — but you
shouldn’t fall too far short, all the same. After all, when the things are there for the
asking, it seems silly not to use them. Use them sparingly, by all means, if your tastes
are on the austere side; but don’t dispense with them alto?gether! I’ve always had
rather a flair for decorating interiors. I don’t exercise it much nowadays, because I’m
too old; but I think the girls have inherited a little of it from me. The thing one always
has to be on one’s guard against is bad taste - which generally means no more than
arranging good things in a bad way. I don’t think any of my girls has bad taste. Now
why don’t you let me decorate this room for you? I promise you it shall look both
dignified and austere. There are still a few things tucked away in my dowry that
Bao-yu doesn’t know about. (I wouldn’t let him see them, or they’d have disappeared
long ago!).’
She called Faithful to her and instructed her what to bring. ‘I want you to fetch that
bonseki and the little screen and the little tripod of smoky agate. Those three things
arranged on the table here will be enough. There’s also a set of white satin hangings
hand-painted in black ink. I’d like you to get them too and put them up in place of
these bed-curtains.’
‘Yes, madam,’ said Faithful. ‘But these things are all stored in the attic over the east
wing and I’m not sure which chests they’re in, so it will take me quite a while to find
them. Can’t I leave it until tomorrow?’
‘Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is immaterial,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘as long
as it gets done.’
After sitting for a while longer in Bao-chai’s room, they got up and again moved on to
the covered area underneath the Painted Chamber. élégante and the other little
actresses came forward to make their curtseys and to inquire what pieces they
should play.
‘Choose a few of the ones you are most familiar with,’ said Grandmother Jia, and
the little actresses went off to the Lotus Pavilion. No further mention of them is
made in this part of our narrative.
Supervised by Xi-feng, the servants had by now completed the seating arrangements
for the drinking-party. Two wooden couches covered with woven grass mats and
embroidered cushions had been placed side by side at the head. Each had a pair of
carved lacquer tables in front of it. On one of each pair there was an incense set — a
miniature metal vase, a miniature cassolette and a miniature tripod, all for burning
different kinds of incense in - on the other was a large lacquer box. These two
couches with a pair of tables each were for Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue.
Of the places ranged below them only one, Lady Wang’s, had a couch and two tables;
all the rest had one table and a chair. On the east side, nearest to Grandmother Jia,
sat Grannie Liu with Lady Wang below her; on the west side Xiang-yun had been laid
first, nearest to Aunt Xue, then Bao-chai, then Dai-yu, then Ying-chun, then Tan-chun,
then Xi-chun, with Bao-yu in the very last place of all. A table and chairs had been
laid for Li Wan and Xi-feng between the inner and outer mosquito screens which
protected those inside the room from the insects of the lake.
The little lacquer tables were of many different shapes — some four-lobed like a
begonia leaf, some five-lobed like plum-flowers, some shaped like multi-petalled
sunflowers, some like lotus leaves, some square, some round - and the lacquer boxes
were designed to match the shapes of the tables. Everyone had his own nielloed
silver ‘self-service’ wine kettle and a little polychrome cloisonné winecup.
‘Well now,’ said Grandmother Jia when they were all seated, ‘let’s have a cup or
two to warm up on, and after that I think it would be more fun if we played a
drinking game.’
‘I am sure you know lots of good ones,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but what about the rest of
us? I am afraid this is just a trick to make us all drunk. We might just as well drink the
extra cups now, since we’re bound to lose anyway, and forget about the game!’
‘ Come, Mrs Xue, you’re being excessively modest all of a sudden!’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘But perhaps you think I’m too old for this sort of thing?’
‘No, no, no. And I’m not being modest, either,’ said Aunt Xue, laughing. ‘I am afraid
of not being able to give the answers and making a fool of myself.’
‘Even if we can’t give the answers,’ said Lady Wang, ‘it only means drinking a few
more cups of wine. And if we get drunk, we can go to bed. No one is going to laugh at
us, I hope!’
Aunt Xue smiled and nodded.
‘Very well, I shall do as I am told then. But I think Lady Jia ought to drink a cup first,
as proposer of the game.’
‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia, and drained off a cup forthwith.
Xi-feng stepped forward into their midst to make a proposal:
‘If you are going to play a drinking game, may I suggest that you have Faithful as
your M. C.?’
The others, knowing that when Grandmother Jia played drinking games it was
generally Faithful who helped her out, agreed readily to this proposal, whereupon
Xi-feng went to fetch Faithful and drew her into their midst.
‘If Faithful is going to be our M.C.,’ said Lady Wang, ‘we can’t possibly have her
standing up all the time.’ She turned to one of the little maids behind her: ‘Put a chair
for her over there, will you, where Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian are sitting.’
When the chair had been brought, Faithful, offering polite resistance, allowed herself
to be propelled towards it, and having first apologized for the liberty of doing so, sat
down. At once she established her authority by drinking a bumper-cup.
‘Right,’ she said. ‘The rules of drinking are as strict as the rules of war. Now that
you’ve made me your M. C., any of you who doesn’t do exactly as I say, no matter
who it is, has to pay a forfeit.’
‘Agreed, agreed,’ said the others. ‘Hurry up and tell us what the game is.’
Before she could do so, Grannie Liu, waving her hand in protest, got up and began to
go.
‘’Tisn’t right to make sport of folks like this. I’m going home!’
‘No, no, we can’t have that!’ said the others, laughing.
‘Back to the chair with her!’ Faithful shouted to the younger maids. They complied
gleefully, seizing the old woman on either side and marching her back to her seat.
‘Let me off this game!’ she pleaded, as they forced her into it; but Faithful was
adamant.
‘Another word from you,’ she said, ‘and you’ll be made to drink a whole kettleful as
a punishment.’
Grannie Liu’s protests then ceased.
‘What I’m going to do,’ said Faithful, ‘is to call threesomes with the dominoes,
starting from Her Old Ladyship, going round in an anti-clockwise direction, and
ending up with Mrs Liu. First I shall make a separate call for each of the three
dominoes and after that I shall make a call for the whole three?some, so you’ll get
four calls each. Every time I call, you’ve got to answer with something that rhymes
and that has some connection with the call. It can be something from a poem or
song or ballad, or it can be a proverb or some well-known expression anything you
like as long as there is a connection and it rhymes.’
‘Good!’ said the others approvingly. ‘That’s a good game. Let’s have a call then.’
‘Right,’ said Faithful. ‘Here comes the first one.’ She laid down a double six. ‘On my
left the bright blue sky.’
‘The Lord looks down from heaven on high,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Bravo!’ said the others.
The second domino was a five-six.
‘Five and six together meet,’ said Faithful.
‘By Six Bay Bridge the flowers smell sweet.’
‘Leaves six and ace upon the right.’
‘The red sun in the sky so bright,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Altogether that makes: “A shock-headed devil with hair like tow”,’ said Faithful.
‘The devil shouts, “Zhong Kui, let me go!”,’ said Grand?mother Jia.
Amidst laughter, and applause for the successful completion of her turn, she picked
up and drained her winecup.
‘Here comes the next one,’ said Faithful, laying down a double five. ‘On my left all
the fives I find.’
‘Plum-blossoms dancing in the wind,’ said Aunt Xue.
‘On my right all the fives again,’ said Faithful.
‘Plum-blossoms in the tenth month’s rain,’ said Aunt Xue.
‘Between them, two and five make seven.’
‘On Seventh Night the lovers meet in heaven.’
‘Together that gives: “The Second Prince plays in the Five Holy Hills”.’
‘The immortals dwell far off from mortal ills.’
Again there was applause, and Aunt Xue drank her wine.
‘Next threesome coming up,’ said Faithful. ‘All the aces, one and one.’
‘Two lamps for earth, the moon and sun,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘On my right once more aces all.’
‘And flowers to earth in silence fall,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Between them, ace again with four.’
‘Apricot trees make the sun’s red-petalled floor,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Together that makes nine ripe cherries.’
‘Winged thieves have stripped the Emperor’s trees of ber?ries,’ said Xiang-yun, and
drank her wine.
‘A pair on the left then, three and three,’ said Faithful.
‘Swallows in pairs round the old roof-tree,’ said Bao-chai.
‘A pair of threes upon the right,’ said Faithful.
‘Green duckweed-trails on the water bright.’
‘A three and six between them lie.’
‘Three peaks upon the rim of sky,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Together that gives “The lone
boat tied with an iron chain”,’ said Faithful.
‘The waves on every hand and the heart’s pain,’ said Bao-chai, and drank what
remained in her winecup.
‘Sky on the left, the good fresh air,’ said Faithful, putting down a double six.
‘Bright air and brilliant morn feed my despair,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-chai, recognizing the quotation, turned and stared; but Dai-yu was too intent on
keeping her end up to have noticed.
‘A four and a six, the Painted Screen,’ said Faithful.
‘No Reddie at the window seen,’ said Dai-yu, desperately dredging up a line this
time from The Western Chamber to meet the emergency.
‘A two and a six, four twos make eight.’
‘In twos walk backwards from the Hall of State,’ said Dai?-yu, on safer ground with
a line from Du Fu.
‘Together makes: “A basket for the flowers you pick”,’ said Faithful.
‘A basket of peonies slung from his stick,’ Dai-yu con?cluded, and took a sip of her
wine.
‘Four and five, the Flowery Nine,’ said Faithful.
‘The flowering peach-tree drenched with rain,’ said Ying-chun.
‘Forfeit! Forfeit!’ said the others, laughing. ‘It doesn’t rhyme; and besides, the
words don’t fit.’
Ying-chun laughed and sipped her wine. As a matter of fact her failure was
intentional. Eager for more laughs, Xi-feng and Faithful had secretly intimated to the
four remaining cousins that they should give the wrong answers on purpose, in order
to come the more quickly to Grannie Liu. Accordingly Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Bao-yu,
all deliberately fell down on their first calls as well, leaving only Lady Wang to dispose
of, which Faithful accomplished by the simple expedient of sup?plying the answers
for her herself. It was now Grannie Liu’s turn.
‘We often play a game like this ourselves back home when we get together of an
evening,’ said Grannie Liu, ‘only the way we do it, it doesn’t sound so pretty as this.
Howsomever. I don’t mind having a try.’
‘It’s easy, really,’ said the others. ‘Don’t worry about what it sounds like. Just say
what comes naturally.’
Faithful began to lay.
‘A pair of fours on the left, the Man.’
Grannie Liu was a good long while puzzling over this. Finally she said.
‘Is it a farmer?’
The others roared with laughter.
‘That’s all right,’ said Grandmother Jia reassuringly. ‘That answer will do very well.’
‘You young people shouldn’t laugh at me,’ said Grannie Liu to the others. ‘I’m a
countrywoman born and I can’t help my country talk.’
‘Green three, red four, contrasting colours,’ called Faithful.
‘The fire burns up the caterpillars,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Why, so it might,’ said the others. ‘Stick to your “country talk”, Grannie, you’re
doing fine!’
‘Red four on the right and the ace is red,’ said Faithful.
‘A turnip and a garlic-head.’
More laughter.
‘ “That Flower” those three together show,’ said Faithful.
‘This flower will to a pumpkin grow,’ said the flower-bedecked ancient, gesturing
with her hands to demonstrate the size of the imagined pumpkin.
The following chapter will show how the party progressed.




CHAPTER 41

Jia Bao-yu tastes some superior tea at Green Bower Hermitage
And Grannie Liu samples the sleeping accommodation at
Green Delights



‘THIS flower will to a pumpkin grow.’
As Grannie Liu of the flower-studded hair said this, gestur?ing with her hands to
suggest the size of the full-grown pump-kin, a shout of laughter rose from all those
present.
She drank the ‘pass’ cup.
‘To be truthful,’ she said, aiming for another laugh, ‘I’m but a clumsy body at the
best of times, and having drunk so much, I’m scared of breaking this pretty cup
you’ve given me. You should have given me a wooden one; then if I dropped it, it
wouldn’t matter.’
The others laughed; but Xi-feng pretended to take her seriously:
‘If you really want a wooden cup to drink out of, I can find you one. But I’d better
warn you. The wooden ones aren’t like these porcelain ones; they come in sets of
different sizes, and if we get them out for you, you’ll have to drink out of every one in
the set.’
Grannie Liu calculated.
‘I was only joking,’ she thought. ‘I didn’t think they’d really have any. When I’ve
dined with the gentry back home, I’ve seen many a gold and silver cup in their
houses, but never a wooden one. I expect these will be wooden bowls that the
children use. It’s a trick to make me drink a lot. Well, never mind. This stuff’s not
much more than sugared water anyway. It can do me no harm if I drink a bit extra.’
Having so reflected, she made reply
‘Very well. Let’s see them first though.’
‘Go to the inner room of the front apartment,’ Xi-feng told Felicity, ‘and fetch me
that set of ten winecups on the bookcase—the ones carved Out of bamboo root.’
          But before Felicity could go on her errand, Faithful made a
counter-proposal:
‘I know that set of yours they’re not very big cups, and in any case, you promised
her wooden ones and yours are only made of bamboo. Much better give her ten
boxwood ones and make her drink out of Them.’
‘All right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Better still.’ So Faithful sent someone to fetch them.
The sight of these cups when they arrived both alarmed and delighted Grannie Liu.
What alarmed her was their size. The largest was as big as a small hand-basin and
even the smallest one was twice as big as the cup she held in her hand. What
de?lighted her was the consummate artistry of the carving. On each of the ten cups,
in smaller and smaller replicas, was the same landscape with little trees and human
figures in it and even some lines of minute ‘grass character’ writing and a tiny carved
representation of an artist’s seal.
‘I’ll take the smallest one,’ she said hurriedly.
‘Oh no!’ said Xi-feng, smiling. ‘These cups have never been used before, because
up to now we’ve never found any?one with a big enough capacity to drink from them.
Now that you’ve asked for them and we’ve been to the trouble of get?ting them out
for you, we must insist on your drinking from every one of them.’
‘I couldn’t,’ said Grannie Lin in a panic. ‘Please, Mrs Lian, don’t make me!’
Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue and Lady Wang all realized that a person of Grannie Liu’s
advanced years could not possibly be expected to imbibe so huge a quantity of liquor
with?out the direst consequences, and laughingly pleaded for her.
‘Come now, a joke is a joke. You mustn’t make her drink too much. Let her just
drink from the largest one.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Can’t I just drink from the smallest one, like I said? I
can take the largest one home with me and drink it up by degrees.’
The others laughed. Faithful, obliged to relent, ordered one of the larger, but not the
largest cup to be filled, and Grannie Liu, holding it in both her hands, began to drink.
‘Drink it slowly, now,’ Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue counselled her. ‘Don’t make
yourself choke.’
Aunt Xue told Xi-feng to offer the old woman something to eat with her bowlful.
‘What would you like, Grannie?’ said Xi-feng. Just name it and I’ll feed you some.’
‘I don’t know the names of any of these dishes,’ said Gran?nie Lin. ‘Anything you
like. They all taste good to me.’
‘Give her some of the dried aubergine,’ said Grandmother Jia.
Xi-feng collected some between her chopsticks and held it up to Grannie Liu’s mouth.
‘There. I expect at home you eat aubergines every day. Try some of ours and see
what you think of it.’
‘You’re having me on,’ said Grannie Liu, when she had eaten the proffered mouthful.
‘No aubergine ever had a flavour like that. If it did, we’d give up growing other crops
and grow nothing but aubergines!’
‘It really is aubergine,’ the others laughingly assured her. ‘This time we’re not
having you on.’
‘Really?’ said Grannie Liu in some surprise. ‘Well, I couldn’t have had my mind on it
properly while I was eating it. Give me a bit more, Mrs Lian, and this time I’ll chew it
more carefully.’
Xi-feng took up some more from the dish in her chopsticks and popped it into
Grannie Liu’s mouth. After prolonged, reflective mastication Grannie Liu agreed that
there was indeed a slight hint of aubergine in the flavour.
‘But I still say this isn’t really like aubergine,’ she said. ‘Tell me the recipe, so that I
can make it for myself.’
‘It’s simple,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You pick the aubergines in the fourth or fifth month when
they’re just ripe, skin them, re?move the pulp and pips and cut into thread-fine strips
which you dry in the sun. Then you take the stock from one whole fat boiling-fowl,
put the dried aubergine-strips into a steamer and steam them over the chicken stock
until it’s nearly all boiled away. Then you take them out and dry them in the sun
again. You do that, steaming and drying, steaming and drying by turns, altogether
nine times. And it has to be dried until it’s quite brittle. Then you store in a
tightly-sealed jar, and when you want to eat some, you take out about a saucerful
and mix it with fried slivers of chicken leg-meat before serving.’
Xi-feng’s ‘simple recipe’ caused Grannie Liu to stick her tongue out and shake her
head in wonderment.
‘Lord Buddha!’ she exclaimed. ‘That’s ten chicken gone into the making of it. No
wonder it tastes so good!’
And having laughed a while over the recipe, she applied herself once more to the
wine and slowly drank it down. She continued to toy with the cup after she had
finished drinking, as though loth to put it down.
‘I do believe you haven’t had enough,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Have another cupful.’
‘Gracious goodness, that would be the death of me!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘No, I was
just admiring the carving on it. Beautiful. How could they do it so fine?’
‘Now that you’ve finished drinking from it,’ said Faithful, ‘why not tell us what
wood it’s made of?’
‘Ah now, that question doesn’t surprise me,’ said Grannie Liu. You young ladies
living in the lap of luxury wouldn’t know much about wood; but people like us that
live all our lives with the woods for neighbours, that lie on wood when we re tired
and sit on it when we’re weary and even have to eat it sometimes in years of famine:
seeing it and hearing it and talking about it every day of our lives, we naturally get to
know its different qualities and can tell the genuine from the imitation. Well now, let
me see.’
She turned the cup round a good while in her hands and contemplated it with great
attention before pronouncing:
‘A household like yours wouldn’t have anything cheap in it,’ she said, ‘so anything
wooden you’ve got would be made from a wood that’s not very easy to come by. And
this is a heavy wood, so it’s definitely not willow. I should say, with?out much doubt,
this is red pine.’
The loud laughter which greeted this pronouncement was interrupted by the arrival
of an old woman who reported to Grandmother Jia that the young actresses were in
the Lotus Pavilion awaiting instructions. Were they to perform now, or should they
go on waiting a little longer?
‘Bless me! I had completely forgotten about them,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Yes, tell
them to begin straight away.’
The old woman departed, and presently, in the cold, clear air of autumn, the
ululation of flutes rising above a drone of pipes and organs came stealing through the
trees and across the water, ravishing the hearts and minds of those who heard it.
Bao-yu, the first to be affected, seized his wine-kettle, poured himself a cupful of
wine, and drained it in a single gulp. He then poured himself a second cup; but just as
he was about to drink it, he noticed that his mother had evidently been affected in
the same way, for she was just at that moment giving orders to a servant to fetch her
a supply of freshly-heated wine. At once he crossed over to where she was sitting and
held his cup to her mouth for her to drink from.
Soon the newly-heated wine arrived and Bao-yu went back to his seat. Lady Wang
rose from hers and picked up the wine-kettle that had just been brought, intending
to pour some for Grandmother Jia. This was a signal for the others present, including
Aunt Xue, to rise from their seats as well; but Grandmother Jia hurriedly gave orders
for Li Wan and Xi-feng to take over.
‘Let your Aunt sit down, so that the others can be at their ease,’ she said to Xi-feng,
whereupon Lady Wang relinquished the wine-kettle and went back to her seat.
‘We’re having such fun today,’ said Grandmother Jia when Xi-feng had poured for
her. ‘All of you must drink!’
She raised her cup to Aunt Xue, then, reaching beyond her, to Xiang-yun and
Bao-chai.
‘Come on, you two! You must have a cup too. And your Cousin Lin - we’re not
letting her off. I know she can’t drink very much, but today is an exception.’
She drained her cup, and Xiang-yun, Bao-chai and Dai-yu drank something from
theirs.
Grannie Liu, meanwhile, who had seldom before heard such fine music and was
more than a little drunk, was showing bet appreciation of it with vigorous
movements of hands and feet. Bao-yu, catching sight of her, slipped from his seat to
whisper in Dai-yu’s ear.
‘Look at the old grannie!’
‘It reminds me of the passage in the History Classic about the animals dancing to
the music of Shun,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Only in this case it’s just one old cow!’
The other girls, overhearing this, all laughed.
After a little while the music stopped and Aunt Xue sugges?ted that as everyone
appeared to have had about as much to drink as was good for them, perhaps it
would be a good idea to break up and walk around for a bit. At this Grandmother Jia,
who was herself beginning to feel like some exercise, rose to her feet. The others
rose too and followed her outside.
Anxious to keep Grannie Liu with her as a source of diver?sion, Grandmother Jia took
her by the hand to walk with her among the trees at the foot of the rockery. She
spent a goodish while circumambulating this area with her, explaining what the
various trees, rocks and flowers were called. Grannie Liu listened very attentively.
‘Seems that in the city it isn’t only the folks that are gran?der,’ she remarked. ‘The
creatures too seem to be grander than what they are outside. Even the birds here are
prettier, and they can talk.’
‘What birds?’ they asked her, curious.
‘I know the one on the golden perch on the verandah—him with the green feathers
and red beak is—a polly parrot,’ she said defensively, ‘but that old black crow in the
cage he’s grown a thingummy on his head and learned to talk, as well.’
The ‘crow’ that she was referring to was a mynah. The others laughed at her mistake.
A little after this some maids came up and invited them to take a snack.
‘After drinking all that wine, I don’t feel hungry,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Still, bring it
here anyway, and those who want to can help themselves.’
The maids went off and returned carrying two small tables. A couple of food-boxes
followed. Each, when its cover was removed, was found to contain two different
kinds of delicacy. In the first box there were two kinds of steamed things: marzipan
cakes made of ground lotus-root and sugared cassia?-flowers, and pine-nut and
goose-fat rolls, The second box contained two sorts of fried things, one of them a
heap of tiny jiao-zi only about one inch long
‘What have they got inside them?’ Grandmother Jia asked.
‘Crab-meat, said one of the old women who had brought the boxes.
Grandmother Jia frowned.
‘I shouldn’t think anyone would feel like eating that now,’ she said. ‘Much too rich.’
The other type of fried confection consisted of a wide variety of little pastry-shapes
deep-fried in butter. These, too, met with the old lady’s disapproval. She invited Aunt
Xue to choose first. Aunt Xue selected one of the little cakes of lotus-root marzipan.
Grandmother Jia chose a goose-fat and pine-nut roll, but after merely tasting it,
handed the uneaten half to a maid.
Grannie Liu was fascinated by the delicately fashioned pas?tries. They had been
looped or perforated or criss-crossed in every conceivable shape and the soft dough
instantaneously hardened in boiling butter-fat. The one she had selected was shaped
like a peony.
‘The cleverest girl in our village couldn’t make a paper cut?out as fine as that,’ she
said, holding it up for the others to see. ‘It seems almost a shame to eat it. I’d like to
wrap up a few of these and take them home with me to use as patterns!’
The others laughed.
‘I’ll give you a jarful to take back with you when you go,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Eat
these ones now, while they’re still hot.’
The others contented themselves with nibbling only one or two of whichever
delicacies in the boxes took their fancy, but Grannie Liu and Ban-er, partly because of
the novelty (neither of them having eaten such things before), and partly because
the little pastry-shapes really were very pretty and, being heaped promiscuously
together, tempted you to go on eating them to discover what new shapes were lying
underneath, went on munching away until they had tried several of every shape, by
which time about half the pile had vanished. Xi-feng had what was left on the four
dishes heaped together onto two of them and put into a single box, and sent it over
to the Lotus Pavilion for élégante and the eleven other little actresses to eat.
Just then the nurse appeared carrying Xi-feng’s little girl, who at once became the
main focus of their attention. She was clutching a large grapefruit, but as soon as she
caught sight of the Buddha’s hand that Ban-er was holding, she decided that she
wanted that, and let up a wail when the maids who were attempting to coax it from
Ban-er could not procure it for her quickly enough. A resourceful cousin saved the
situation by hurriedly taking the grapefruit and inducing Ban-?er to make an
exchange. Ban-er had by this time been playing with the Buddha’s hand for quite a
long while and had more or less exhausted its possibilities; moreover at the moment
he had his hands full of fried pastry-shapes; and the grapefruit not only smelled good
but, being round, made an excellent football. For these three reasons he concluded
that it was an altogether more satisfactory fruit than the Buddha’s hand and
abandoned all interest in the latter.

*

When everyone had taken tea, Grandmother Jia, with the rest of the party following,
conducted Grannie Lin to Green Bower Hermitage, where they were met at the gate
by the nun Adamantina. Inside the courtyard the trees and shrubs had a thriving,
well-cared-for look.
‘Monks and nuns always have the best-kept gardens,’ said Grandmother Jia, in
smiling approval of what she saw. ‘They have nothing else to do with their time.’
They were walking towards the meditation hall on the east side of the courtyard. As
they seemed to hesitate in the outer foyer, Adamantina invited them to go on inside,
but Grand?mother Jia declined.
‘No, we won’t go inside just now. We’ve all recently taken wine and meat, and as
you’ve got the Bodhisattva in there, it would be sacrilege. We can sit out here, where
we are. Bring us some of your nice tea. We’ll just drink one cup and then go out
again.’
Adamantina hurried off to make tea.
Having heard a good deal about her, Bao-yu studied her very attentively, when she
arrived back presently with the tray. It was a little cinque-lobed lacquer tea-tray
decorated with a gold-infilled engraving of a cloud dragon coiled round the character
for ‘longevity’. On it stood a little covered tea?cup of Cheng Hua enamelled
porcelain. Holding the tray out respectfully in both her hands, she offered the cup to
Grand?mother Jia.
‘I don’t drink Lu-an tea,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘I know you don’t,’ said Adainantina with a smile. ‘This is Old Man’s Eyebrows.’
Grandmother Jia took the tea and inquired what sort of water it had been made
with.
‘Last year’s rain-water,’ said Adamantina.
After drinking half’ Grandmother Jia handed the cup to Grannie Liu.
‘Try it,’ she said. ‘See what you think of it.’
Grannie Liu gulped down the remaining half.
‘Hmn. All right. A bit on the weak side, though. It would be better if it were brewed
a little longer.’
Grandmother Jia and the rest seemed to derive much amuse?ment from these
comments.
The others were now served tea in covered cups of ‘sweet-white’ eggshell china—all,
that is, except Bao-chai and Dai-yu, whom Adamantina tugged by the sleeve as an
indication that they should follow her inside. Bao-yu stealthily slipped out after them
and saw Adamantina usher them into a side-room leading off the foyer. This was
Adamantina’s own room. Inside it Bao-chai seated herself on the couch and Dai-yu
sat on Adamantina’s meditation mat. Adamantina busied herself at the stove, fanning
the charcoal until the water was boiling vigorously and brewing them a fresh pot of
tea. Bao-yu stepped softly into the room and made his presence known to the two
cousins.
‘So you get the hostess’s special brew?’
‘Yes,’ they said laughing. ‘And it’s no good your gate-crashing in here after us,
because there’s none for you.’
Just as Adamantina was about to fetch cups for the girls, an old lay-sister appeared at
the door carrying the empties she had been collecting in the foyer.
‘Don’t bring that Cheng Hua cup in here,’ said Adamantina. ‘Leave it outside.’
Bao-yu understood immediately. It was because Grannie Liu had drunk from it. In
Adamantina’s eyes the cup was now contaminated. He watched her as she got cups
out for the girls. One of them, a cup with a handle, had
THE PUMPKIN CUP

carved in li-shu characters on one side and

             Wang Kai his Treasure

in little autograph characters. on the back, followed by another column of tiny
characters:

             Examined by Su Dong-po in the Inner Treasury
             Fourth month Yuan-feng era anno 50

When she had poured tea into this cup she handed it to Bao-chai.
The other cup was shaped like a miniature begging-bowl and was inscribed with the
words

THE HORN LINK GOBLET

in ‘pearl-drop’ seal script. Adamantina filled it and handed it to Dai-yu.
She poured tea for Bao-yu in the green jade mug that she normally drank from
herself, Bao-yu commented jokingly on the choice:
‘I thought you religious were supposed to treat all earthly creatures alike. How
comes it that the other two get priceless heirlooms to drink out of but I only get a
common old thing like this?’
‘I have no wish to boast,’ said Adamantina, ‘but this “com?mon old thing” as you
call it may well be more valuable than anything you could find in your own
household.’
‘In the world’s eyes, yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But “other coun?tries, other ways”, you
know. When I enter your domain, I naturally adopt your standards and look on gold,
jewels and jade as common, vulgar things.’
Adamantina glowed with pleasure. In place of the jade mug she hunted out a large
drinking-bowl for him to drink out of. It was carved from a gnarled and ancient
bamboo root in the likeness of a coiled-up dragon with horns like antlers.
‘There, that’s the only thing I’ve got left. Do you think you can drink so much?’
Delightedly he assured her that he could.
‘Yes, I dare say you could too,’ said Adamantina. ‘But I’m not sure that I’m prepared
to waste so much of my best tea on you. You know what they say “One cup for a
connoisseur, two for a rustic, and three for a thirsty mule”. What sort of creature
does that make you if you drink this bowlful?’
Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu all three laughed at this. Adamantina poured the
equivalent of about a cupful into the bamboo-root bowl. Savouring it carefully in
little sips, Bao-yu found it of incomparable freshness and lightness and praised it
enthusiastically.
‘You realize, of course,’ said Adamantina seriously, ‘that it is only because of the
other two that you are drinking this. If you had come here alone, I should not have
given you any.
Bao-yu laughed.
‘I fully realize that, and I don’t feel in the least indebted to you. I shall offer my
thanks to them.’
Adamantina pondered this statement with unsmiling gravity.
‘Yes. I think that would be sensible.’
‘Is this tea made with last year’s rain-water too?’ Dai-yu asked her.
Adamantina looked scornful.
‘Oh! can you really not tell the difference? I am quite disap?pointed in you. This is
melted snow that I collected from the branches of winter-flowering plum-trees five
years ago, when I was living at the Coiled Incense temple on Mt Xuan-mu. I managed
to fill the whole of that demon-green glaze water-jar with it. For years I couldn’t bring
myself to start it; then this summer I opened it for the first time Today is only the
second time I have ever used any. I am mod surprised that you cannot tell the
difference. When did stored rain-water have such buoyant lightness? How could one
possibly use it for a tea like this?’
Dai-yu was too well aware of Adamantina’s eccentricity to attempt a reply; and since
it felt awkward to sit there saying nothing, she signalled to Bao-chai that they should
go. While the three of them were leaving, Bao-yu stopped to have a word with
Adamantina.
‘That cup that the old woman drank out of: of course, I realize that you can’t
possibly use it any more, but it seems a shame to throw it on one side. Couldn’t you
give it to the old woman? She’s very poor, and if she sold it, she could probably live
for quite a long while on the proceeds. What do you think?’
Adamantina reflected for some moments and then nodded.
Yes, I suppose so. Fortunately I have never drunk out of that cup myself. If I had, I
should have smashed it to pieces rather than give it to her. If you want her to have it,
though, you must give it to her yourself. I will have no part in it. And you must take it
away immediately.’
‘But of course,’ said Bao-yu. ‘No one would expect you to speak to her. That would
be an even greater pollution. Just give the cup to me and I shall see to the rest.’
Adamantina ordered the cup to be brought in and handed over to Bao-yu. As he took
it, Bao-yu said
‘After we’ve gone, shall I get my boys to bring a few buckets of water from the lake
and clean the floor for you ?’
Adamantina smiled graciously.
‘That would be very nice. But tell them to bring the water only as far as the gate.
They can leave it there at the foot of the outer wall. Tell them not to come inside.’
‘Of course,’ said Bao1u, putting the cup into his sleeve as they went into the foyer.
He found a junior maid of Grand?mother Jia’s there and entrusted it to her.
‘When Grannie Liu goes, see that she takes this Cup with her, will you?’
By the time he had done this, Grandmother Jia was already outside in the courtyard
expressing a desire to get back. Ada?mantina made no serious effort to detain her,
and after seeing her guests out of the Hermitage, went in again and closed the gate
after her.

*

Back at the scene of the party, Grandmother Jia, who was feeling somewhat
exhausted, told Lady Wang and the girls to act as hostesses to Aunt Xue while she
herself went off to Sweet-rice Village for a rest. Xi-feng ordered the servants to fetch
a little bamboo carrying-chair, which Grandmother Jia got into. Two old women lifted
it up, and then off they all went, Xi-feng and Li Wan one on either side of it and a
little cohort of maids and older servants bringing up the rear.
As soon as Grandmother Jia had gone, Aunt Xue excused herself and left, Lady Wang,
having dismissed the young actresses and given orders for the left-over food in the
lacquer boxes to be distributed among the maids, also availed herself of the
opportunity of taking a rest. Putting her feet up on the couch lately occupied by
Grandmother Jia, she first caused the blinds to be let down, then, instructing one of
the junior maids to massage her legs, and murmuring something about ‘calling her if
anyone came from Her Old Ladyship’, she settled her-self down for a nap.
Bao-yu and the girls watched the maids take the food-boxes out onto the rockery.
Some sat there on the rocks for their picnic; others spread out over the grass below
or sat under the trees or down at the water’s edge. Although so dispersed, they
managed to create a considerable hubbub.
After a little while Faithful arrived with instructions to show Grannie Liu some more
of the Garden. The cousins, hoping for more laughs, went along with them.
A short walk took them to the monumental stone arch at the entrance to the
Reunion Palace.
‘Goodness me!’ said the old woman. ‘You even have a temple here!’
She fell down on her knees and kotowed, causing her young companions to double
up with laughter.
‘Why do you laugh?’ she said. ‘Do you think I don’t know what the words say? We
have quite a few temples where I come from and they all have arches like this. The
writing on the arch is the name of the temple.’
‘All right. What’s the name of this temple then?’ they asked her.
Grannie Liu pointed upwards at the characters inscribed overhead.
‘“Temple of the Jade Emperor”. That’s what it says, doesn’t it?’
This produced an ecstasy of merriment in the young people. No doubt they would
have gone on teasing her, but just at that moment there was an alarming rumble
from her bowels and she clutched the hand of one of the little maidservants standing
by and begged her for the favour of a couple of sheets of paper, while with the other
hand she began undoing the buttons of her dress.
The others, still laughing, shouted at her to stop
‘No, no! Not here! Not here!’
They told one of the older women to escort her to a place beyond the north-east
corner of the precincts where there was a privy. Having led Grannie Liu to within
sight of it and pointed it out to her, the old servant deemed this an excellent
opportunity of taking some time off, and went away, leaving Grannie Liu to make her
way back alone.
Now Grannie Liu had drunk quantities of yellow rice-wine, which did not in fact agree
with her; on top of that she had eaten a lot of rich, fatty food; and as the food had
made her thirsty, she had concluded by drinking an excessive amount of tea. The
upset stomach which was the inevitable consequence of so much indulgence kept
her a wearisome long time in the privy before her business there was completed.
When she at last emerged, the colder air outside drove the wine fumes up into her
head, increasing the dizziness, which might be thought normal in a woman of her
years who has suddenly got up after squatting for a long time on her heels, to such
an extent that she was quite Unable to make out the route that she had come by.
Everywhere she looked there were buildings, rocks and trees. Unable to decide which
of them lay in the right direction, she made for the nearest paved path and, with slow
and deliberate steps, followed it to see where it would take her.
It took her in time to the courtyard wall of a house, but she could find no gate in it,
and after wandering round a long while looking for one, she came upon a bamboo
trellis, which she contemplated with some astonishment.
‘Hmn. Bean-sticks. What are they doing here?’
The ‘bean-sticks’ resolved themselves into a rose-covered pergola. After walking
alongside it for a while, she came to a round ‘moon-gate’, which she entered. Ahead
of her was a channel of crystal-clear water, five or six feet wide. Its banks were
reinforced with stone, and a large, flat slab of white stone had been laid across it to
make a bridge. After she had crossed the bridge there was a raised cobbled path
which, after a couple of right-angled bends, brought her up to the door of the house.
The first thing she saw on entering it was a young woman smiling at her in welcome.
Grannie Liu smiled back.
‘I’m lost, miss. The young ladies have left me to find my own way and I’ve
wandered in here by mistake.’
Surprised that the girl did not reply, Grannie Thu stepped forward to take her hand
and—bang!—hit her head a most painful thump on the wooden wall. The girl was a
painting, as she found on closer inspection.
‘Strange!’ she thought. ‘How can they paint a picture so that it sticks out like that?’
Grannie Liu was ignorant of the foreign mode of light-and-?shadow painting and was
sorely puzzled to discover, on touch?ing the picture, that it did not in fact ‘stick out’
but was flat all over. Turning from it with a sigh and a shake of her head, she moved
on to a little doorway in the wooden partition-wall, over which hung a green,
flower-patterned portière. She raised the portiere and went inside.
In the room she now entered everything, from the top of the surrounding walls,
delicately incised with shapes of swords, vases, musical instruments, incense-burners
and the like, to the lavish furnishing below, in which

                 The weaver’s glowing art combined
                 With gleam of gold and. orient pearl,

and thence down to the very floor of brilliantly patterned green glazed tiles beneath
her feet, was such as to make even more dazzled the eyes of an already intoxicated
old woman.
She looked for the way out - but where was it? To the left of her there was a
bookcase, to the right a screen. She tried behind the screen. Ah, yes! There was the
door. But there too, to her intense surprise, approaching her from the opposite
direction and causing her a momentary palpitation of the heart, was another old
woman, whom she took to be her old gossip from the village.
‘What? are you here too?’ she asked her, ‘I suppose you were wondering what had
become of me these last few days. Well, it was neighbourly to come and look for me.
Which of the young women brought you in?’
She noticed, with much amusement, that her old neigh?bour’s head was covered all
over with flowers.
‘Hoo! You’ll catch it! Picking the flowers from their garden to put in your own hair.
Well I never!’
The other merely grinned back at her and said nothing. Grannie Liu stretched out a
hand to give her the touch of shame. The other old woman stretched her hand out
too to stop her. After a. brief’ soundless skirmish, Grannie Liu managed to get her
finger onto the other one’s face. But no sooner had she done so than she recoiled in
horror, for the cheek she touched was as cold and hard as a block of ice. Suddenly
the truth dawned on her:
‘I’ve heard of rich folks having what they call “dressing mirrors ‘in their houses.
Mayhap I’m standing in front of one of them and it’s myself I’m looking at.’
She stretched out her hand again to feel and closely examined the surface. Yes, no
doubt of it: it was a mirror, let into the carved surface of the wooden partition. She
laughed at her own error.
‘Yes, but how do I get out of here?’ she thought, as she continued to finger the
mirror’s carved surround.
Suddenly there was a loud clunk! which so frightened the old woman that for some
moments she rolled her eyes in ter?ror. The mirror was in fact a kind of door. It had a
West Ocean mechanism by which it could be opened or closed, and Gran?nie Liu, in
feeling around it, had accidentally touched the spring which had made the mirror
slide back into the panel?ling, revealing the doorway underneath.
Pleasantly surprised, she passed through the doorway into a room whose main
feature was a rich and elegantly patterned bed. Now Grannie Liu was seven or eight
parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking. Seeing a bed in front of
her, she sat down on it gratefully, to rest her feet. But though she intended no more
than a few moments’ rest, as soon as she had sat down, her weariness overcame her.
Her head went down and her feet went up as though she was no longer in possession
of them; a darkness closed over her eyes, and she sank back on the bed, fast asleep.
Outside in the Garden meanwhile, the cousins were begin?ning to wonder what had
become of her, and Ban-er, missing his grandmother, became panicky and began to
cry.
‘Perhaps she’s fallen into the privy,’ one of the young people suggested cheerfully.
‘We’d better send someone to have a look.’
Two old women were sent to the privy to investigate. When they reported back ‘hat
she was not there, the others were at a loss to think where she could have got to. It
was Aroma who hit on the correct hypothesis.
‘She must have missed the way back because she was drunk. If she followed the
path in the wrong direction, it will have taken her to our back Courtyard. Now if she
went through the pergola and then on into the house through the back door, she’ll
probably have been seen by one of the maids. If she didn’t go in through the pergola
but went on walking in a south-westerly direction, Heaven only knows where she’ll
end up! I think I’d better go and have a look.
She hurried back to Green Delights, intending to ask the junior maids if they had seen
her; but the place was deserted; they had all sneaked off elsewhere to play. Entering
the main building by way of the front door, she made her way through the
complicated carved partition. A thunderous snoring could be heard coming from the
bedroom at the back. She hurried through. As she entered the bedroom, a heavy
stink, com?pounded of farts and wine-fumes, assailed her nostrils. Her eyes travelled
to the bed, from which the sounds were coming, and saw Grannie Liu, spreadeagled
on her back and fast asleep.
As soon as she had overcome her shock, she rushed up to the bed and shook her
relentlessly until she woke. Grannie Liu opened her eyes wide and saw Aroma
standing over her.
‘Oh, miss!’ She scrambled hurriedly to her feet. C Oh, I am sorry! Anyway—praise
be!— I haven’t dirtied the bed.’
She felt it nervously, to make sure.
Aroma, mortally afraid that someone would overhear and Bao-yu get to know of
what had happened, gestured to her violently not to speak. Hurriedly she threw
three or four whole handfuls of Hundred Blend aromatic onto the incense burner
that stood always smouldering beside the bed and re?placed its cover.
‘At least it’s a mercy she wasn’t sick,’ she thought to her?self.
Speaking to her in an urgent whisper, she nevertheless con?trived to smile at her
reassuringly:
‘It’s all right. I’ll look after this. Just follow me.’
Grannie Liu nodded gratefully and followed her to the junior maids’ quarters outside,
where Aroma made her sit down.
  ‘If they ask what happened, just say that you passed Out and had a little nap on
the rockery.’
Grannie Liu willingly agreed, and Aroma gave her some tea. By the end of the second
cup she had sobered up com?pletely and was able to converse.
‘Which of the young ladies does the bedroom belong to?’ she asked Aroma. ‘It’s the
most beautiful I ever saw. I thought I was in paradise.’
Aroma gave a wry little smile.
‘It’s—actually it’s Master Bao’s bedroom.’
Grannie Liu fell silent, horrified by the enormity of her trespass. Seeing that she had
now recovered, Aroma led her out through the front courtyard and back to where
the others were waiting.
‘I found her asleep on the grass,’ she said when she saw them, ‘so I’ve brought her
back for you.’
The others seemed satisfied with this explanation, for no further mention was made
of it.
Shortly after this Grandmother Jia woke up and dinner was laid for her in Sweet-rice
Village; but she felt too exhausted to eat anything, and getting into the bamboo
carrying-chair again, had herself carried back to her own apartment to rest. When
she was back, she told Xi-feng and the rest of the young folk who had escorted her to
go and have their dinner, and the cousins went back into the Garden
Ensuing events will be dealt with in the following Chapter.
CHAPTER 42

Lady Allspice wins over a suspicious nature with some
well-intentioned advice
And River Queen enhances her reputation as a wit with
some amusing sarcasms



The last chapter showed how Grandmother Jia, escorted by all the others, returned
from Sweet-rice Village to her own apartment. As soon as she arrived, she insisted
that the young people should go off and have their dinner. The young people
accordingly went back into the Garden, and when they had eaten, the party finally
broke up.
Returning from the Garden with little Ban-er, Grannie Liu first called on Xi-feng to
announce her intention of leaving for home early next morning.
‘We’ve only been here two or three days,’ she said, ‘but in these two or three days
we’ve seen and heard and eaten and drunk more things than we ever dreamed of.
I’m truly grateful to you and Her Old Ladyship and the young gentlewomen and the
young ladies working in the different apartments for treating an old countrywoman
with so much kindness. I don’t know what I can do in return. All I can think of is to
buy some sticks of best incense when I get back so that I can offer some every day to
the Lord Buddha and pray him to give you long life. Leastways it would show my
gratitude.’
‘It’s a bit early yet for rejoicing,’ said Xi-feng drily. ‘Thanks to you, Her Old Ladyship
seems to have caught a chill and is at this very moment lying on her back
complaining how bad she feels; and my little girl has caught a cold, too, and is lying in
there with a fever.’
Grannie Liu murmured sympathetically.
‘Her Old Ladyship’s feeling her age, poor soul,’ she said. And she isn’t used to the
exercise.’
‘I’ve never seen her more lively than she was today,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Generally when
she goes into the Garden, she’ll visit just one or two places, sit there for a little while,
and then come back again. But today, because you were there and she wanted to
show you everything, she must have covered the greater part of the Garden. It was
also because of you that I wasn’t on hand when Lady Wang gave my little girl that
piece of cake. I’m sure it was eating out in the cold that has made her feverish.’
‘I suppose your little lass doesn’t go into the Garden very much,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Not like our young ones, off to play in the grave-garths almost as soon as they can
walk. She may have caught a cold from the wind as you say. On the other hand,
children of her age, being pure of body, often have the second sight. It could have
been brought on by seeing a spirit. If I was you, I’d have a look in the Almanac, just in
case. You never know, the child might have been pixified.’
Wondering why she had not thought of this herself, Xi-feng at once ordered Patience
to fetch down the Jade Casket. Sun?shine was summoned to look up the relevant
passage and read it out to them. This, after some preliminary hunting, he pro?ceeded
to do:

EIGHTH MONTH. TWENTY-FIFTH DAY: Sicknesses Occurring on this day have a
south-easterly origin. Possible causes Encounter with spirit of hanged person or
flower spirit. Recommended action Maxi?mum benefit may be obtained by procuring
voluntary departure of spirit. To do this, take forty pieces of coloured paper spirit
money’ and walk forty paces in a south-easterly direction offering one of the pieces
at every step.

    ‘There you are!’ said Xi-feng. ‘That must be it. The Garden is just where you’d
expect to run into a flower spirit. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if that doesn’t account
for Her Old Lady?ship’s trouble as well.’
She sent someone forthwith to obtain two lots of spirit money and got two of the
servants to carry out the exorcism, one on Grandmother Jia’s behalf and the other on
behalf of her little girl. As soon as it was over, she and Grannie Liu went in to see how
Baby was getting on. They found her sleeping peacefully.
‘There!’ said Xi-feng delightedly. ‘It takes an old, ex?perienced person like yourself
to know these things. Perhaps you could also tell me why she’s such a sickly little girl.
She’s always going down with something or other.’
‘There’s nothing unusual about that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Children of well-to-do folks
are brought up so delicate, their bodies can’t stand any hardship. And for another
thing, when young folks are cherished too much, it overloads their luck. It might be
better for her if in future you tried not to make quite so much of her.’
‘You may be right,’ said Xi-feng without much conviction. ‘It’s just occurred to me:
as we haven’t named the child yet, I wonder if you’d like to name her for us? For one
thing, being named by someone so old will help her to live longer; and for another—I
hope you won t mind my saying this, but you country people do have quite a lot of
poverty and hardship to contend with—being named by a poor person like yourself
may help to balance her luck.’
Grannie Liu thought for a bit.
‘When was she born?’
‘Ah, that’s just the trouble,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She was born on Qiao-jie—the Seventh of
the Seventh—a very unlucky date.’
‘No matter,’ said Grannie Lin. ‘Call her “Qiao-jie” then. That’s what the doctors
mean when they talk about “fighting poison with poison and fire with fire”. You call
her “Qiao?-jie” like I say, and I guarantee that she’ll live to a ripe old age. I prophesy
for this child that when she’s a big girl and the others are all going off to get married,
she may for a time find that things are not going her way; but thanks to this name, all
her misfortunes will turn into blessings, and what at first looked like bad luck will turn
out to be good luck in the end.’
Xi-feng was of course delighted with these ‘auspicious words’ and thanked her
warmly.
‘May it turn out for her as you say!’
She summoned Patience.
‘We’re going to be busy tomorrow and may not have the time then. As you’ve got
nothing to do at the moment, why don’t you get the things for Grannie together, so
that every?thing will be ready for her to start first thing tomorrow?’
‘Please don’t go giving me a lot of things,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’ve already put you to
so much inconvenience these last few days, I should feel even more uncomfortable
carrying a lot of things back with me.’
‘These are only very ordinary things,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Noth?ing special. Just a few
things for you to take back with you and show off to the neighbours. Just so as to be
able to say that you’ve been to town.’
‘Come over here, Grannie, and have a look,’ said Patience. Grannie Lu followed her
into the next room. A full half of the kang was occupied by her piled-up presents.
Patience picked them up one by one and explained them to her.
‘This sky-blue material is the gauze you said you wanted. The pale-blue gauze in a
closer weave is a present from the Mistress to line it with. These are two lengths of
wild-silk pongee. You can use it to make either a dress or a skirt with; it would do
equally well for either. In this wrapping here there are two lengths of silk for making
up into a New Year outfit. This is a box of various kinds of cakes and pastries made in
the Imperial kitchens. There are some kinds that you’ve al?ready eaten and some
that you haven’t. You want to put them out on plates when you’re having someone
to tea: you’ll find they’re a bit better than the ones you can buy in the shops. These
two sacks are the ones you brought the vegetables in when you came. This one has
got two bushels of pink ‘Em?peror’ rice in it. It makes a really delicious congee. This
one has got fruit and nuts and other things from the Garden in it. And this packet
here has got eight taels of silver in it. Every?thing up to here is from the Mistress.
Now these two packets here have each got fifty taels of silver in them - a hundred
taels in all. They’re a present from Her Ladyship, for starting a little business or
buying some land with when you get back, so that you can be self-sufficient in future
and not have to keep falling back on your friends. The two jackets’—here Patience
smiled somewhat embarrassedly—‘the two jackets and the two skirts and the four
head-scarves and the packet of embroidery silks are a present from me. The clothes
have only been worn a very little but they aren’t new: so if you decide to throw them
back at me, I shan’t complain.’
Grannie Liu had been exclaiming rapturously as each item was shown to her and
must have uttered several dozen ‘Holy Names’ by the time Patience came to her own
gift.
‘Throw them back at you, Miss?’ she said warmly, touched by the maid’s kindness
and humility. ‘How can you say such a thing? Fine clothes like these? I shouldn’t
know where to buy them if I had the money! You make me feel ashamed. I don’t like
to take them off you; yet if I don’t, you will think me un?grateful.’
‘Get away with you!’ said Patience. ‘That sort of talk is for strangers, and you are
one of us. If I didn’t think of you so, I’d never have dared make the offer. You just take
them and stop worrying. In any case, there’s something I want from you in return.
Next New Year, bring us some of your home-dried mixed vegetables: pigweed and
cowpeas and kidney beans and dried aubergines and dried gourd-shavings. Everyone
here loves them. You just bring us some of them. We don’t want anything else from
you, mind, so don’t go wondering what else to bring. Just bring some of them, and
we’ll be quits.’
Grannie Liu thanked her warmly and promised to remem?ber the dried vegetables.
‘Now off to bed with you!’ said Patience. ‘I’ll look after this lot for you. You can
leave it here tonight, and tomorrow we’ll send the boys out for a cab and get them to
load it for you. So you’ve got nothing to worry about.’
Overwhelmed by so much kindness, Grannie Liu went back into the other room to
take her leave of Xi-feng, and after thanking her many times over, went off to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment to spend the night.
She was up betimes next morning and would like to have said good-bye to
Grandmother Jia as soon as she had com?pleted her toilet, and made an early start;
but the family fore?stalled her. Knowing that the old lady was indisposed, they had
trooped in first thing to inquire how she was and had already sent outside for a
doctor. The latter’s arrival at the mansion was shortly after announced by an old
woman? servant, whereupon the old women in attendance on Grand mother Jia
urged her to conceal herself behind the curtains of the summer-bed. But
Grandmother Jia refused to budge.
‘I’m old, too, woman—old enough to be his mother, I shouldn’t wonder. What have
I got to fear from him at my age? I’m not going behind any curtains. Let him examine
me where I am.’
Seeing that she was resolved to stay, the old women brought up a little table and put
a small pillow on it for her to rest her arm on. These preparations completed, they
gave orders for the doctor to be admitted.
Dr Wang was shortly to be observed crossing the courtyard below, conducted by
Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong. Modestly declining to walk up the central ramp,
he followed Cousin Zhen up the right-hand side steps onto the terrace, where two
old women, one on either side of the doorway, were holding up the door-blind in
readiness. Bao-yu came for?ward to welcome the doctor as the two old women were
conducting him through the outer room, and led him, still accompanied by the other
gentlemen, to his grandmother inside.
The old lady was sitting up very stiffly on a couch. She was wearing a black crepe
jacket lined with pearly-haired baby lamb’s skin. Four little maids, their hair still done
up in childish ‘horns’, stood two on either side of her, holding fly whisks and
spittoons, and five or six old serving-women were fanned out in a sort of bodyguard
behind her. Vaguely dis?cernible glimpses of brightly-coloured dresses and golden
hair-ornaments betrayed the presence of numerous younger women behind the
green muslin curtains at the back. Not daring to raise his head in so much female
company, Dr Wang advanced and saluted his patient. Observing that he was dressed
in the uniform of a mandarin of the sixth rank, Grand?mother Jia deduced that he
must be a Court Physician, and in returning his salutation was careful to address him
with the ‘Worshipful’ to which his appointment entitled him.
‘And what is the Worshipful’s name?’ she asked Cousin Zhen.
‘Wang.’
‘When I was a young woman, the President of the Imperial College of Physicians
was a Wang,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Wang Jun-xiao. Famous for his diagnoses.’
The doctor bowed.
‘He was my great-uncle,’ he said, smiling demurely, but still not daring to raise his
head.
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘That makes you a friend of the family.’
She stretched out an arm and slowly arranged it for him on the pillow. The old
women brought up a large stool which they set down in front of her table and slightly
to one side. Dr Wang knelt on it, squatting on his heel with one haunch so that he
was half-sitting on the edge of the stool, and in that polite but uncomfortable
posture proceeded at great length to take the old lady’s pulses, first in one arm and
then in the other. After that he made another bow and retired, eyes still on the floor,
as they had been throughout the consultation.
‘Thank you,’ said Grandmother Jia as he was leaving. ‘See him out, will you, Zhen?
And see that he gets. some tea.’
Murmuring a reply, Cousin Zhen himself withdrew, fol?lowed by Jia Lian and Jia Rong,
and conducted Dr Wang back to one of the gentlemen’s rooms in the front part of
the mansion.
‘There’s nothing seriously wrong with Lady Jia,’ said Dr Wang when they were
seated. ‘She has a slight chill. There is no need for her to take any medicine. A light,
simple diet for a day or two and see that she keeps warm. That should be enough. I’ll
write Out a prescription that you can have made up if she feels like taking something.
If not, I should just for?get about it.’
He drank his tea and wrote out the prescription. Just as he was about to leave, the
nurse came hurrying in with Xi-feng’s little girl in her arms.
‘Doctor, have a look at us too, will you?’
The doctor went over, took one of the child’s hands and supported it on his own left
hand while he felt her pulse. Then he felt her forehead and inspected her tongue.
‘I’m afraid the young lady is not going to be very pleased with my advice,’ he said
with a smile. ‘A good, cleansing hunger is what she needs. Let her miss a couple of
meals. No need for a prescription. I shall send you some pills that you can dissolve in
hot ginger-water and give her to drink at bed?time. That should help do the trick.’
With that he took his leave once more and departed.
Cousin Zhen and the other two went back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment with the
prescription and reported what the doctor had said. Then they laid the prescription
on the table and withdrew.
Lady Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-chai and the rest came out from behind the curtain
as soon as the doctor had gone. Lady. Wang sat with Grandmother Jia for a while
before re?turning to her own apartment.
The coast was now at last clear for Grannie Liu to come forward and take her leave.
‘You must come again when you have the time,’ said Grand?mother Jia. She
ordered Faithful to see her off. ‘I can’t see you off myself,’ she said. ‘I’m not feeling
too well today.’
Grannie Liu, having thanked her and said good-bye, fol?lowed Faithful out of the
room and into a room at the side of the courtyard. Faithful pointed to a large bundle
on the kang.
‘These are dresses given to Her Old Ladyship by various people over the years as
birthday or festival presents, but as she refuses to wear any clothes made by
outsiders, they’ve none of them ever been worn. It’s a shame to keep them, really.
She told me yesterday to pick out a few for you to take back with you, either to give
away as presents or to wear yourself about the house. In this box here you’ll find
those pastries you wanted. This parcel has got the medicines in you were talking
about the other day: the Red Flower Poison Dis?pellers, the Old Gold Anti-Fever
Pastilles, the Blood Renewing Elixir Pills and the Easy Birth Pills. You’ll find each kind
wrapped up separately inside its own prescription. These two little silk purses are to
wear.’ Faithful undid the draw-strings and extracted from each purse a golden
‘Heart’s Desire’ medallion with a device showing an ingot, a writing-brush and a
sceptre. She smiled at Grannie Liu mischievously:
‘You give me these and keep the purses.’
Grannie Liu, surprised and delighted (as she showed by her many pious ejaculations)
to be receiving these further presents in addition to what Patience had shown her
the night before, seemed eager to accede to this request.
‘Yes, yes, Miss. You keep them by all means.’
Faithful, who had not intended to be taken seriously, re?placed the medallions in
their. purses and did them up again.
‘I was only pulling your leg. I’ve got lots of these things already. Keep them to give
the children at New Year.
While she was speaking, a little maid came in carrying a Cheng Hua enamelled
porcelain cup, which she handed to Grannie Liu.
‘Master Bao said I was to give you this.’
‘Well!’ said Grannie Liu as she took the cup from her. ‘Now what do you make of
that? Reckon it must be some?thing I did for him in a past life.’
‘Those clothes I gave you to change into the other day when you had your bath
were mine,’ said Faithful. ‘If you don’t mind taking them off me, I’ve got some more
like them that I’d like to make you a present of.’
As Grannie Liu made no objection, Faithful got out several more sets of clothing and
wrapped them up for her.
Grannie Lin wanted to go into the Garden to thank Bao-yu and the girls and say
good-bye to them; she also wanted to take her leave of Lady Wang; but Faithful
prevented her.
‘It isn’t necessary. In any case, they won’t be seeing anyone at this hour. I can thank
them for you when I see them later. Well, good-bye then. Come again when you can.’
She ordered an old servant-woman to fetch two pages from the inner gate to help
Grannie Liu out with her things. The old servant undertook to do this and also went
with Grannie Liu to collect the things from Xi-feng’s apartment. When they had got
them all together, she fetched the boys from the out?side corner gate who carried
them out to the street for her and loaded them into a waiting cab. Grannie Liu and
Ban-er then got in themselves and Set off without more ado on their journey back
home.
At this point they pass also out of our narrative, which turns now to other matters.
*

After they had eaten their lunch, Bao-chai and the test of the young people called
once more on Grandmother Jia, to see how she was progressing. On their way back,
as they reached that point in the Garden where their paths separated, Bao-chai
called Dai-yu over to her.
‘Frowner, come with me. There’s something I want to talk to you about.’
Dai-yu followed her to Allspice Court. When they were in?side her room, Bao-chai sat
down.
‘Well?’ she said to Dai-yu. ‘Aren’t you going to kneel down? I am about to
interrogate you.’
Dai-yu was mystified.
‘Poor Bao-chai!’ she said, laughing. ‘The girl’s gone off her head. Interrogate me
about what ?’
‘My dear, well-bred young lady!’ said Bao-chai. ‘My dear, sheltered young innocent!
What were those things I heard you saying yesterday? Come now, the truth!’
Dai-yu, still mystified, continued to laugh. She was begin?ning to feel somewhat
uneasy, though she would not admit it.
‘What awful thing am I supposed to have said? I expect you’re making it up, but
you may as well tell me.’
‘Still acting the innocent?’ said Bao-chai. ‘What were those things you said
yesterday when we were laying that drinking game? I couldn’t think where you could
have got them from.’
Dai-yu cast her mind back and remembered, blushing, that the day before, when
stumped for an answer, she had got through her turn by citing passages from The
Return of the Soul and The Western Chamber. She hugged Bao-chai imploringly.
‘Dear coz! I really don’t know. I just said them without thinking. If you tell me not to,
I promise not to say them again.’
‘I really don’t know either,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I just thought they sounded rather
interesting. I thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were.’
‘Dear coz! Please don’t tell anyone about this. I promise not to repeat such things
again.’
Moved by the scarlet, shame-filled face and pitifully entreating voice, Bao-chai
relented and did not pursue her questioning. Having first drawn her down into a seat
and handed her some tea, she began, very gently, to address her in the following
manner:
‘What do you take me for? I’m just as bad. At seven or eight I used to be a real little
terror. Ours was reckoned to be rather a literary family. My grandfather was a
bibliophile, so the house we lived in was full of books. We were a big family in those
days. All my boy cousins and girl cousins on my father’s side lived with us in the same
house. All of us younger people hated serious books but liked reading poetry and
plays. The boys had got lots and lots of plays: The Western Chamber, The Lute-player,
A Hundred Yuan Plays—just about everything you could think of. They used to read
them behind our backs, and we girls used to read them behind theirs. Eventually the
grown-ups got to know about it and then there were beatings and lectures and
burning of books—and that was the end of that.
‘So, you see, in the case of us girls it would probably be better for us if we never
learned to read in the first place. Even boys, if they gain no understanding from their
reading, would do better not to read at all; and if that is true of boys, it certainly
holds good for girls like you and me. The little poetry-writing and calligraphy we
indulge in is not really our proper business. Come to that, it isn’t a boy’s proper
business either. A boy’s proper business is to read books in order to gain an
understanding of things, so that when he grows up he can play his part in governing
the country.
‘Not that one hears of that happening much nowadays. Nowadays their reading
seems to make them even worse than they were to start with. And unfortunately it
isn’t merely a case of their being led astray by what they read. The books, too, are
spoiled, by the false interpretations they put upon them. They would do better to
leave books alone and take up business or agriculture. At least they wouldn’t do so
much damage.
‘As for girls like you and me: spinning and sewing are our proper business. What do
we need to be able to read for? But since we can read, let us confine ourselves to
good, im?proving books; let us avoid like the plague those pernicious works of fiction,
which so undermine the character that in the end it is past reclaiming.’
This lengthy homily had so chastened Dai-yu that she sat with head bowed low over
her teacup and, though her heart consented, could only manage a weak little ‘yes’ by
way of reply.
At that moment Candida came into the room:
‘Mrs Zhu says will you please come over to discuss an important matter with her?
Miss Ying and Miss Tan and Miss Xi and Miss Shi and Master Bao are there already,
waiting for you.’
‘I wonder what it is this time,’ said Bao-chai.
‘We shall soon find out if we go,’ said Dai-yu.
So off she went, and Bao-chai with her, to Sweet-rice Vil?lage. They found everyone
else there, as Candida had said. Li Wan greeted them with a smile.
‘We’ve only just got our poetry club started, and already someone is trying to
wriggle out of it. It’s Xi-chun. She’s ask?ing for a year’s leave of absence.’
‘I can guess why that is,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s because of what Grandmother said about
painting the Garden. She’s decided to use that as an excuse.’
‘I don’t think you should blame Grandmother,’ said Tan-?chun. ‘It’s what Grannie
Liu said that started it.’
‘Grannie Liu, yes, that’s right,’ Dai-yu hurriedly corrected herself. ‘Whose ‘grannie’
is she anyway, I’d like to know? ‘Old Mother Locust’ we ought to call her, not ‘Grannie
Liu’.’
This set them all laughing.
‘If one wants to hear the demotic at its most forceful,’ said Bao-chai, ‘one has to
listen to Cousin Feng. Fortunately for us she can’t read, so her jokes are somewhat
lacking in finesse and the language she uses can never rise above the level at which it
is commonly spoken. The secret of Frowner’s sar?castic tongue is that she uses the
method adopted by Confu?cius when he edited the Spring and Autumn Anna/s, that
is to say, she extracts the essentials from vulgar speech and polishes and refines
them, so that when she uses them to illustrate a point, each word or phrase is given
its maximum possible effectiveness. The mere name ‘Old Mother Locust,’, for
example, is sufficient to evoke the whole scene of yesterday’s party and everything
that happened at it. What’s more, she is able to do this sort of thing almost without
thinking.’
The others, still laughing, assured Bao-chai that she excelled as a commentator no
less than Dai-yu and Xi-feng, in their different ways, as wits.
‘The reason I asked you all here is because I wanted your advice on how long we
ought to give her,’ said Li Wan. ‘I said a month, but she says that’s much too short.
What do you all think?
‘Logically a year wouldn’t be at all too long,’ said Dai-yu. ‘If it took a whole year to
build the Garden, she would natural?ly require about two years in which to paint it.
First she’s got to grind her ink, then she’s got to soften her brushes, then she’s got to
fix the paper, then she’s got to find her colours, and then -,
The others realized that this was a joke at Xi-chun’s expense.
‘Yes?’ they said, playing up to her. ‘What then?’
Dai-yu, unable to maintain a straight face, was beginning to giggle.
‘—and then proceed in like manner, by gradual degrees, to paint it.’
Prolonged hilarity and clapping of hands.
‘In like manner, by gradual degrees’,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I like that. The telling phrase at
the end. The trouble with all those jokes we were laughing at yesterday is that they
were funny enough at the time, but on recollection they seem rather stupid. Dai-yu’s
jokes on the other hand, though the words at first appear colourless, are richly
humorous to remember. They certainly make me laugh a lot.’
‘You shouldn’t flatter her, Cousin Chai,’ said Xi-chun plaintively. ‘It encourages her
to show off. It’s because you complimented her on her joke about Grannie Liu that
she’s started making fun of me.’
‘Tell me now,’ said Dai-yu, taking Xi-chun’s hand in her own, ‘is it to be a picture of
the Garden alone, or are we to be in it as well?’
‘It was originally to have been of the Garden alone,’ said Xi-chun, ‘but afterwards
Grandmother said that that would make it look too much like an architect’s drawing
and told me to put in some people. She said what we wanted was something like one
of those paintings of ‘Scholars Enjoying Themselves in a Landscape’. The trouble is, I
don’t know how to do buildings in the Elaborate style, and I’m no good at human
figures; but as I was too scared to refuse, I’ve got myself into a mess.’
‘Human figures are no problem,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s the insect-painting that’s going to
give you the trouble.’
‘Now you’re talking nonsense,’ said Li Wan. ‘What need will there be of insects in a
painting of the Garden? A few animals and birds dotted here and there maybe, but
no insects, surely?’
‘If she has no other insects in it, she’s got to have Old Mother Locust,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Without her the painting would be incomplete.’
The others all laughed. Dai-yu continued, laughing so much herself that she had to
clutch her chest with both hands:
‘You must hurry up and get on with the painting. I’ve al?ready thought of a title to
inscribe on it when it’s finished. You must call it ‘With Locust to the Chew’.’
The others threw back their heads and roared. Their laughter ended abruptly,
however, when a loud crash caused them to look anxiously around them to see what
had fallen.
It turned out to have been Xiang-yun’s chair. It had been a somewhat rickety one to
start with, and in laughing she had thrown herself back against it so violently that the
two joints connecting the chairback with the seat had sprung, causing her to sink
backwards and sideways, still sitting in the disin?tegrating chair. Fortunately she was
saved by the room’s wooden partition from falling onto the floor. The undignified
spectacle of her descent provoked fresh shouts of mirth which only gradually
subsided when Bao-yu hurried over and helped her to her feet.
As he passed Dai-yu he signalled to her with his eyes. Understanding that something
must be wrong with her appearance, she slipped into Li Wan’s bedroom and took the
cover off the mirror to have a look. It was the hair above her brows that was coming
loose. She pulled out the drawer in Li Wan’s dressing-box, took out two little
vanity-brushes, primmed her hair at the mirror, then, hurriedly replacing everything,
went back into the outer room, where the others were still laughing. She pointed a
finger accusingly at Li Wan.
‘So this is your idea of ‘supervision in needlework and moral instruction’—inviting
us over here for jokes and horse?play!’
‘Did you hear that, all of you?’ said Li Wan. ‘This is the ringleader who sets
everyone else laughing and misbehaving, yet she has the effrontery to blame me for
starting it all! Oh, I could - ! Well, all I can say is that I hope when you marry you have
a real Tartar for a mother-in-law and lots of nasty sisters-in-law with tongues as sharp
as yours. It will serve you right!’
Dai-yu, blushing, clung to Bao-chai’s hand.
‘Let’s give her a year’s leave, shall we?’
‘Let me suggest what I think is a fair compromise and see what the rest of you think
of it,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s true that Lotus Dweller can paint, but ‘painting’ in her case
means no more than an occasional sketch in the Impressionistic style. Now of course,
you couldn’t paint this Garden in the first place if you didn’t have impressions of it;
but the trouble is that the Garden itself was designed rather like a painting, with
every rock, every tree, every building in it carefully and pre?cisely placed in order to
produce a particular scenic effect; and if you tried to get your impressions of all of
these different scenes onto paper exactly as they are, they simply wouldn’t make a
picture. The shape of the paper imposes its own per?spectives. You have to make
them into a composition. You have to decide which to bring into the foreground and
which to push into the background, which to leave out altogether and which to show
only in glimpses. When you’ve done that, you can make your rough draft. And even
then, it’s only when you’ve studied the draft for a long time and corrected it until
you’re satisfied that you can go ahead with your transfer.
‘One of your difficulties is going to be the ruler-work. With all those buildings
you’re going to have to do the straight lines with a ruler, and in ruler-work if you’re
not very careful it’s easy to make the most terrible mistakes - railings that slant to
one side, leaning pillars, windows on the skew or steps drawn Out of line. Sometimes
careless ruling can produce even more grotesque results, like a table squashed into a
wall or a flower?pot apparently testing on the side of a curtain. Any one of these
things is enough to make a painting look ridiculous.
‘Putting in the human figures is going to be another prob?lem. First of all you have
to be very careful that you have got them in the right perspective. Then again, in
painting figures the clothes and the position of the hands and feet are of great
importance. A careless slip of the brush can mean a mon?strously swollen hand or a
crippled leg. Compared with these, little mishaps like the colour of the face running
into the hair are of minor importance.
‘In my opinion this painting is going to be very, very diffi?cult. And since a year is
thought to be too long and a month too short, the compromise I suggest is that she
should be allowed half a year to do it in, but that Cousin Bao should be appointed to
help her. My reason is not that I think he knows mote about painting than she does
and can tell her how to do it—I am sure that if he tried, it would only make matters
worse—but because whenever there is anything she doesn’t know about or has
difficulty in putting in, he will be able to take the painting to one or another of his
men friends outside who know about these matters and ask for their advice.’
Bao-yu was enthusiastic.
‘That’s a splendid idea. Zhan Guang can do Elaborate style buildings and Cheng
Ri-xing is very good at women. I’ll go and have a word with them now.’
‘Didn’t I tell you you ought to be called ‘Busybody’?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Just because
I’ve mentioned the possibility, you don’t have to go rushing off straight away. Wait
until we’ve finished discussing what needs to be done, then you can go and see them.
The question now is, what is she going to do this painting on?’
‘We’ve got some. Snow Wave paper still,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It comes in large enough
pieces and it holds the ink well.’
‘Oh, you’re just hopeless I’ said Bao-chai. ‘Snow Wave is a good, ink-receptive
paper for doing calligraphy or Impres?sionist style paintings on, and it will stand up to
the wrinkle-and-wipe work in a Southern School landscape; but it is quite unsuitable
for a painting like this one involving detailed colouring and layer upon layer of graded
washes. You’d merely ruin the picture and waste the paper.
‘Now I’ll tell you what to do. Before they started on the construction of this Garden,
they made a very detailed draw?ing of the layout. It was only an artist’s impression,
but the measurements shown on it were all accurate. Why don’t you ask Lady Wang
for that drawing and then ask Cousin Feng to give you a piece of heavyweight pongee
of the same dimen?sions? Cousin Bao can get Uncle Zheng’s gentlemen to size it for
you, and they can make you a draft by adapting the archi?tect’s drawing and putting
in the human figures. He could even get them to touch in some of the
blue-and-green background for you and indicate where the outlines will need
reinforcing with milk gold or milk silver.
‘Meanwhile you must get hold of a portable stove that you can use for melting and
extracting your glue on and for heat?ing the water to wash your brushes with. You’ll
also need a long distemperer’s table, and a blanket to cover it, for resting your
painting on. And I don’t suppose your present supply of paint-saucers and brushes is
likely to be adequate. You’d better start from scratch and get yourself a completely
new outfit.’
‘I haven’t got any equipment to speak of,’ said Xi-chun. ‘I just use my ordinary
writing-brushes when I want to paint. As for colours: red ochre, Canton indigo,
gamboge and safflower red are the only four I’ve got. Apart from that, all I have is a
couple of colouring brushes.’
‘Why ever didn’t you tell me before?’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve still got lots of these
things. The only thing is, if I give them to you before you actually need them, they
will only be lying around doing nothing in your room the same as they now are in
mine. On second thoughts I think I’ll hang on to them for the time being. We can say
that I am keeping them for you. But I can let you have any of them you want as soon
as the need arises. I’d rather you used my stuff for painting fans with and that sort of
thing, though. It would be a waste to use it on this great big painting of the Garden.
What I’ll do for you now is to make out a list of materials you can ask Lady Jia for. You
may not know about some of these things, so perhaps it would be a good idea if
Cousin Bao were to take them down at my dictation.’
Bao-yu had brush and ink already prepared. He had been intending in any case to
take notes, in order to have his own record of what she said, and had merely to pick
up his brush and wait for her to begin.
Here is the list she dictated:

large size raft brushes              4
No.2 size raft brushes          4
No.3 size raft brushes          4
large wash layers               4
medium wash layer                    4
small wash layers                    4
large Southern crab’s claws         10
small Southern crab’s claws         10
whisker brushes                     10
large colouring brushes             20
small colouring brushes             20
face liners                           10
willow-slip brushes                 20
arrow-shaped cinnabar               4 oz.
Southern red ochre                  4 oz.
orpiment                               4 oz.
azurite                         4 oz.
malachite                             4 oz.
brush-stick gamboge                 4 oz.
     Canton indigo                        8 oz.
    oyster-shell white                   4 boxes
    safflower red                        10 sheets
    red powder-gold                 200 leaves
gold foil                        200 leaves
    quality Canton glue                  4 oz.
    clear alum                           4 oz.


‘That doesn’t allow for the alum and glue that will be needed for the sizing,’ said
Bao-chai. ‘You can leave that to the menfolk.
By the time these colours have been washed and ground and emulsified and graded,
you should have enough there to last you a lifetime—messing about and
practice-work in?cluded.’
She continued with her list:



superfine silk strainers         4
coarse silk strainers            2
strainer-brushes            4
mortars, various sizes      4
coarse howls                     20
5-in. saucers               10
3 in. porcelain ditto            20
portable stoves             2
casseroles, various sizes        4
new porcelain water-jars    2
new water-buckets           2
1-ft white linen bags    4
light charcoal             20 catties
willow-wood charcoal        1 catty
3-drawer chest of drawers   1
gauze, close-woven          1 ell
raw ginger                  2 oz.
soy sauce                   1/2 catty


‘—a cooking-pot and a frying-slice,’ Dai-yu added hurriedly.
‘What are they for?’ said Bao-chai.
‘To use with the ginger and soy sauce,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Then she’ll be able to cook the
colours and eat them.’
The others laughed, including Bao-chai herself.
‘Frowner! Frowner!’ she said. ‘What do you know about it? If you didn’t first
season the new saucers by rubbing ginger-juice and sauce on the bottom and
burning them in, they would crack when you put them on the heat.’
The others assured Dai-yu that this was so. Dai-yu, mean?while, was reading through
the list.
‘Just look!’ she said, laying a hand on Tan-chun’s arm and speaking to her in an
undertone. ‘All those water-jars and chests of drawers and things to paint a picture! I
think she must have got confused at this point and started making a list for her
trousseau.’
This set Tan-chun off into a fit of the giggles. ‘Pinch her lips, Chai!’ she said. ‘You
should hear what she’s been saying about you.’
‘I don’t need to,’ said Bao-chai. ‘One doesn’t expect ivory from a dog’s mouth!’
Bearing down on Dai-yu as she said this, she forced her back, laughing and protesting,
upon the kang and made as if she would pinch her face.
‘Oh, please coz, forgive me!’ Dai-yu pleaded. ‘Little Frowner is younger than you
and doesn’t know any better. You should teach me how to be good. If you won’t be
nice to me, who else can I turn to?’
The others, not knowing what lay behind these words, were greatly amused.
‘Do forgive her!’ they said, laughing. ‘How pitifully she pleads! Even we are melted.’
But Bao-chai knew she was referring to their recent confrontation on the subject of
forbidden books, and feeling rather embarrassed to have this dragged up in the midst
of a playful tussle, hurriedly released her. Dai-yu rose to her feet laughing.
‘That’s my good coz. If it had been me, I should never have let you off!’
Bao-chai pointed her finger at Dai-yu and smiled at her in?dulgently.
‘I’m not surprised that Lady Jia is so fond of you or that the others find you so
amusing. I can’t help being fond of you too, little coz. Come here and let me do your
hair for you.’
Dai-yu turned her head obediently while Bao-chai re?fastened her back hair. Bao-yu,
watching from where he sat, thought how much better it looked for Bao-chai’s
attention, and wished that he had not told Dai-yu earlier to tidy the hair above her
brows, for then Bao-chai could have done that for her too. His agreeable musings on
the subject were interrupted by Bao-chai’s voice:
‘Have you finished writing the list? Perhaps you’d better be the one to see Lady Jia
about it. If they’ve got those things here already, so much the better. If not, you’ll
have to get some money to buy them with. In that case I might be able to advise you
on where to go for them.’
Bao-yu folded up the list and stowed it away inside his jacket. They continued to sit a
while longer, chatting about this and that.
After dinner they went to call on Grandmother Jia to see how she was. She had been
suffering from nothing more serious than a slight chill aggravated by fatigue, and by
the evening, after a day’s cosseting and two doses of the mild sudorific prescribed by
Dr Wang, she was almost better.
If you want to know what the next day held in store, you will have to read the
following chapter.

CHAPTER 43

An old woman’s whim is the occasion of a birthday collection
And a young man’s remorse finds solace in a simple ceremony



Our story recommences in Lady Wang’s apartment next day. On the previous
evening’s visit she had found Grandmother Jia almost completely recovered after
only two doses of the medicine prescribed for her that same morning by the doctor.
Satisfied that it was only a mild chill, contracted during her day in Prospect Garden,
and not anything more serious that the old lady had been suffering from, and
deeming it unneces?sary to make an early call again this morning, Lady Wang
summoned Wang Xi-feng to her own apartment to discuss the getting together of
some things to send to her husband, Jia Zheng. A summons from Grandmother Jia
arrived neverthe?less, and Lady Wang hurried over, taking Xi-feng with her, to see
what was the matter.
‘Are you still feeling better today, Mother?’ she asked her when they arrived.
‘I’m quite recovered now, thank you,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve had a sip or two of
the pheasant stew you sent me. It was very tasty I ate some of the meat in it and
enjoyed it very much.’
You have Feng to thank for that,’ said Lady Wang with a smile. ‘See how dutiful she is
to you! It shows that your kind?ness is not wasted on her.’
Grandmother Jia returned the smile and nodded affably.
‘It was good of her to think of me. If there’s any of the meat still left, I’d rather like a
few pieces of it fried. It has a pleasant, salty tang that goes well with the rice-gruel I
am taking The stew is very nice, but stew and gruel don’t go very well to?gether.’
Xi-feng at once sent orders to the main kitchen to have the pheasant-meat prepared.
‘Well, it wasn’t really my diet that I wanted to talk about,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘The reason I’ve sent for you is because the second of the ninth month is Feng’s
birthday. In previous years, though I’ve always meant to do something about it,
something or other has always cropped up which has pre?vented me from
celebrating it properly. As we’re all of us here together this year and it doesn’t look as
if there are likely to be any distractions, I propose that we should get together and
make a day of it.’
‘I was thinking just the same thing,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Since you feel in such good
spirits, Mother, why not settle now what we should do?
‘Well now, this is what I have been thinking,’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘In other years,
no matter whose birthday it’s been, we’ve each of us given our individual presents.
Now that’s so dull, and what’s more, I think it’s a rather unsociable way of
celebrating a birthday. I’ve thought of a new way which will be much more sociable
and also lots of fun.’
‘Whatever it is, I’m sure that’s what we ought to do,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I think we ought to imitate what they do in poorer fami?lies,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Everyone subscribes something towards a common pool, then, when it’s all been
collected, you spend it all on some treat or other, depending on how much you have.
What do you think of the idea?’
‘It sounds a very good one,’ said Lady Wang. ‘But how do we go about collecting
the subscriptions ?’
At this Grandmother Jia became still more animated. Let Aunt Xue and Lady Xing be
invited without delay, she told them. Let Bao-yu and the girls be sent for. And You-shi
from the other mansion. And why not Lai Da’s wife and some of the more respected
older members of the female staff? In?fected by her enthusiasm, the maids and older
women-servants went scurrying off in all directions to summon or invite.
In less time than it would take to eat a meal, all those invited, young and old,
mistress and servant, had been assembled, and the room was packed. Aunt Xue and
Grandmother Jia sat on their own facing the multitude, Lady Xing and Lady Wang on
chairs at the opposite side of the room beside the door. Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun
and the Three Springs sat in a row at the back of the kang behind Grandmother Jia
and Aunt Xue. Bao-yu half reclined in his grandmother’s lap. All the rest stood,
shoulder to shoulder, on the floor below.
As soon as she saw that they were all assembled, Grand?mother Jia gave orders for
stools to be brought so that Lai Da’s mother and various other of the more aged and
respected servants present might sit down. It was customary in the Jia household to
treat the older generation of servants those who had served the parents of the
present masters—with even greater respect than the younger generation of masters,
so that in this instance it was not thought at all surprising that You-shi, Xi-feng and Li
Wan should remain standing while old Mrs Lai and three or four other old nannies
(though not without first apologizing for the liberty) seated themselves on the stools.
Grandmother Jia now smilingly announced the proposal that she had already
outlined to Lady Wang. All present, it need hardly be said, were willing to fall in with
it—some because they were on good terms with Xi-feng and were genuinely happy
to give her pleasure, some because they were afraid of her and welcomed this as an
opportunity of getting themselves into her good books, and all because in any case
they could afford to do so. Accordingly, as soon as Grandmother Jia had finished
speaking, they all enthusiastically and with one voice agreed.
Grandmother Jia opened the list with her own subscription:
‘I’ll give twenty taels.’
‘I’ll follow Lady Jia,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Twenty taels.’
Lady Xing and Lady Wang called next:
‘We obviously can’t put ourselves on a level with Lady Jia. Sixteen taels.’
You-shi and Li Wan, decreasing their call by a like amount, came next:
‘Twelve taels.’
‘We can’t have you paying out that sort of money,’ Grand?mother Jia said to Li Wan,
‘—a young widow with no mean of her own. I’ll pay yours for you.’
‘Now don’t get carried away, Grandma! ‘said xi-feng. ‘You ought to do your sums
first before you start interfering. Don’t forget you’ve already got two of the young
folk, Bao-yu and Cousin Lin, to pay for besides your own contribution. It’s all very well
promising to pay these additional twelve taels for Li Wan in the heat of the moment,
but later on you’ll be wish?ing you hadn’t. You’ll probably end up by saying that it
was all because of that wretched Feng that you had to pay out so much money and
think of some trick for getting it back from me three or four times over. I know. Don’t
tell me I’m imagin?ing this.’
This made everyone laugh.
‘All right,’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing herself. ‘Then what do you propose?’
‘Well now, it isn’t even my birthday yet, but already I’m feeling uncomfortable
because so much is being done for me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It seems unlucky—so many
people being put to so much expense on my account while I don’t pay a penny myself.
Pd feel a lot easier if you’d let me pay this contribution for Li Wan; then, when the
day comes, I shall be able to eat and drink as much as I like without any fear of
spoiling my luck.’
Grandmother Jia hesitated, but consented when Lady Xing and Lady Wang both
insisted that this was the best solution.
‘I’ve got another suggestion to make,’ said xi-feng. ‘Your own contribution Is twenty
taels, Grandma, and on top of that you’re going to be paying contributions for
Bao-chai and Cousin Lin. It’s true that Aunt Xue will be paying Cousin Chai’s
contribution on top of her twenty taels, but that doesn’t seem quite so unfair. What
does seem unfair to me is that Mother and Aunt Wang should be paying only sixteen
taels each for themselves, yet paying no extras at all for any of the young people. I
think you’re getting the worst of this arrange?ment, Grannie.’
‘See what a good girl my Feng is to me!’ said Grandmother Jia delightedly. ‘You’re
quite right, my dear. If you hadn’t mentioned it, I should have let them get away with
it—as usual!’
‘All you need do, Grannie, is to make the two young people their responsibility. Let
each pay for one of them.’
‘That’s fair,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Yes, that’s what I’ll do.’
Lai Da’s old mother rose up from her stool in mock indig?nation.
‘But this is rank mutiny! It makes me feel really angry on Their Ladyships’ behalf.
What, side with Her Old Ladyship against your husband’s mother and your own
father’s sister? That’s a arrant breach of the laws o’ consanguinity!’
This sally was greeted with a burst of laughter from Grand?mother Jia and all the
others present. Old Mrs Lai remained standing until it had subsided and then made
her own offer.
‘If Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian are each contributing twelve taels, I suppose we’d better
go a step lower?’
‘Oh no, that won’t do at all!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You may be a step below them
in rank, but you’re all wealthy women. I know you’ve got lots more money than they
have. You can’t give more, of course, but at least you should give as much.’
The old women, led by Mrs Lai, willingly agreed.
‘The girls’ contribution will be only for form’s sake, any?way,’ said Grandmother Jia
in reference to the row of figures sitting silently behind her on the kang. ‘I should
think about the equivalent of a month’s allowance would be the right amount?
She turned to Faithful.
‘Come on, now I We’re not leaving you out! Go and get some of the other girls
together and decide how much you are going to give.’
Faithful slipped out and presently returned with Patience, Aroma, Suncloud and one
or two other of the senior maids. Some said they would give one tael, others two.
Grandmother Jia noticed that Patience was one of them.
‘Surely you’ll be doing something for your mistress at home?’ she said. ‘You don’t
need to contribute to this fund as well.’
‘Yes, ma’am, I shall be doing something at home,’ said Patience, ‘but that’s private.
This is a public thing, so I shall contribute to this along with the rest.’
Grandmother Jia smiled at her graciously and commended her public spirit.
‘Well,’ said Xi-feng genially, ‘now just about everyone seems to have been roped in
except Aunt Zhou and Aunt Zhao. Wouldn’t it be a politeness to ask them if they
would like to contribute as well? They might take it as a slight if we left them out.’
‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Whatever made me forget about them? They
probably won’t be free to come over, though. One of the maids had better go and ask
them.’
One of the maids had gone off on this mission almost before she had finished
speaking. She returned, after a long interval, to say that the concubines would
contribute two taels each.
‘Good!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Now take a brush and ink, someone, and calculate
how much we shall have altogether.’
In the interval thus created, You-shi addressed Xi-feng in a scornful whisper.
‘What a mean, grasping young woman you are! Your aunt and your mother-in-law
and all these other people forking out for your birthday, yet you still have to go
squeezing more out of two poor, dried-up old gourds like Zhou and Zhao!’
Xi-feng laughed silently.
‘Don’t talk nonsense!’ she whispered back. ‘I’ll settle accounts with you presently,
when we get out of here. Any?way, what do you mean, “poor”? Whenever they’ve
got any money they only pass it straight on to other people. We might just as well
intercept it before it gets into the hands of their creditors and get a bit of pleasure
out of it!’
By the time this whispered exchange was over, the calcula?tions had been completed
and it was announced that the amounts promised totalled a round sum of one
hundred and fifty taels with a few taels left over.
‘That’s more than we could possibly spend on plays and wine in one day,’ said
Grandmother Jia.
‘As we’re not inviting anyone from outside,’ said You-shi, ‘it won’t be a very big
party, either. There should be enough for two or three days. The big saving, of course,
is that now you’ve got your own troupe of players, you can have first-class
entertainment for nothing.’
‘Feng shall have whatever troupe she prefers,’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘That’s for
her to decide.’
‘We’ve heard our own troupe so often,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I think we should spend a bit
of money and get in a troupe from outside.’
‘Well, I propose to leave all the arrangements for this in the hands of Cousin Zhen’s
wife,’ said Grandmother Jia, then Feng will have nothing at all to worry about -
except how to get the greatest possible enjoyment out of her birthday!’
You-shi agreed to be organizer, after which she and the others stayed charting for a
few minutes with Grandmother Jia. Then, realizing that the old lady’s stock of energy
was ex?hausted, they gradually dispersed.
After the three younger women had seen Lady Xing and Lady Wang a part of their
way home, You-shi accompanied Xi-feng to the latter’s apartment to discuss with her
what arrangements she should make for the party.
‘Don’t ask me,’ said Xi-feng when You-shi questioned her. ‘You want to study
Grandmother and just do whatever seems to please her.’
‘You really are the limit, you know,’ said You-shi. ‘For?tune’s darling! I thought just
now that I was being called over about something serious, but it turned out to be just
for this! And then, if you please, quite apart from being asked to pay out money, I am
to have all the worry of arranging everything for you as well. What are you going to
do in return for all this, to show me your gratitude?’
‘What am I going to do in return?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You must be joking. I didn’t call you
over. If you’re afraid of the trouble, you’d better go back to Grandmother and tell her
to give the job to somebody else.’
‘Just look at her I’ said You-shi. ‘Really full of yourself today, aren’t you? I should
hold it in a bit, if I were you, my dear, or it might start running overt’
The two of them conversed for some minutes longer before finally separating.

*

When the first contributions arrived at Ning-guo House next morning, You-shi had
only just got up and was about to begin her toilet. She asked who had brought the
money, and on being informed that it was Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, sent the maid back to
fetch her in from the servants’ quarters, where she was waiting. When she arrived,
You-shi asked for a stool to be brought so that the old woman could sit and talk to
her while she continued with her toilet.
‘How many of the contributions have you got in this packet?’ You-shi asked her.
‘These are the ones from us servants,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘As they were all
ready, I thought I might as well bring them over straight away. The contributions from
Her Old Ladyship and the other ladies are still to come.’
Just then one of the maids came in to announce another arrival
‘The subscriptions from Mrs Xue and Lady Xing have arrived, ma’am.’
‘Subscriptions!’ said You-shi scornfully. ‘How eagerly you fasten on the ridiculous
word! It was only a passing fancy of Her Old Ladyship’s yesterday that we should
imitate what they do in poorer households. She used the word then as a joke; but
now, I suppose, we shall have every witless maid solemnly talking about
“subscriptions” all the time! Well, go and get the money and bring it in then. And
see that who?ever it is has some tea before they go.’
The girl went out and returned with the two packets of money that the messenger
had brought, one from Aunt Xue, including a contribution for Bao-chai, and one,
including Dai-yu’s contribution, from Lady Xing.
‘Who does that leave now?’ said You-shi.
‘That leaves Her Old Ladyship, Her Ladyship, the young ladies and the maids,’ said
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife.
‘What about Mrs Zhu’s?’ said You-shi.
Mrs Lian will be paying Out the money for all the others,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, ‘so
you’ll be able to get Mrs Zhu’s from her too when you see her about the rest.’
You-shi, having completed her toilet, now called for her carriage. As soon as it was
ready, she drove round to the Rong-guo mansion and went straight in to see Xi-feng.
She found her with the money already packeted and on the point of bringing it round
to her.
‘Is it all here?’ You-shi asked her.
‘All there,’ said Xi-feng gaily. ‘Hurry up and take it away. I don’t want to he
responsible for it if it gets lost.’
‘I don’t think I altogether trust you,’ said You-shi, return?ing her smile. ‘I think I’d
like to check it first in your presence.’
She opened up the packet and counted the money contained in it. The contribution
for Li Wan appeared to be missing.
‘I thought you were up to something,’ she said. ‘Why isn’t the money for Wan
here?’
Xi-feng smiled disarmingly.
‘Isn’t what you’ve already got there enough? Surely her little bit isn’t going to make
all that much difference? Why not wait and see what you need? If you find you
haven’t got enough, I’ll give the money for Wan to you later.’
‘I’m not letting you get away with this,’ said You-shi, ‘—playing the Lady Bountiful
yesterday in front of all those others and then going back on it now, when the two of
us are alone together. I shall have to go and ask Lady Jia for the money.’
‘You’re a hard woman!’ said Xi-feng. ‘One of these days when I have you at a
disadvantage, you mustn’t complain if you find me just as much of a stickler.’
‘Threats?’ said You-shi. ‘I think you are the one who should feel afraid. Do you think
if it weren’t for the things you have done for me in the past I would let you off now?
Here, Patience!’—She took Patience’s contribution from the pile and held it out to
her ‘Take this back. If later on I find that I need it, I’ll make it good with my own
money.’
Patience immediately understood what she was getting at and answered in the same
vein.
‘No, Mrs Zhen, you keep it. If you find you have any left over, you can give it back to
me afterwards.’
‘Take it,’ said You-shi. ‘Is your mistress the only one who’s allowed to break the
rules? Mayn’t I do favours too, if I want to?’
Patience was obliged to take the money from her.
‘Seeing your mistress so tight-fisted,’ said You-shi, ‘I often wonder what she’s going
to do with all this money she saves. Take it with her in her coffin?’
With that parting shot she went off to see Grandmother Jia. After greeting the old
lady and exchanging a few generalities, she went into Faithful’s room for a more
serious discussion of arrangements for the birthday party. The ‘discussion’ con?sisted
quite simply in finding out what would give Grand?mother Jia most pleasure and
deciding that that was what they should do. When all had been settled between
them and You?-shi was rising to go, she took out the two taels that Faithful had
contributed and handed them back to her.
‘Here you are. We shan’t be needing this.’
From Grandmother Jia’s apartment she went over to have a few words with Lady
Wang. When Lady Wang presently left her to go into her Buddhist chapel, You-shi
took advant?age of her absence to return Suncloud’s contribution; then, since xi-feng
was safely out of the way, she offered Aunt Zhou and Aunt Zhao their contributions
as well. But the con?cubines were too scared to take them.
‘Go on I’ said You-shi encouragingly. ‘I know how hard-up you are. You can’t afford
to give away money like this. If Feng finds Out, I shall take full responsibility myself.’
They took the money then, voluble in their gratitude.

*

In a twinkling the second of the ninth was upon them. The denizens of the Garden
had been informed that You-shi was planning an impressive variety of entertainment:
not only the customary plays, but also juggling, acrobatics, story-telling by blind
ballad-singers—in short, everything one could possibly think of that might contribute
to the success of the occasion and the pleasure of the participants.
Li Wan reminded the cousins that the second of the month was also one of the
regular meeting-days of the poetry club. Xi-chun was, of course, excused.
‘But why hasn’t Bao-yu turned up?’ she asked. ‘I suppose he’s so intent on enjoying
the film that he has forgotten his former enthusiasm for these more civilized
amusements!—Go and see what he’s doing,’ she said to one of the maids, ‘and tell
him to come here immediately.’
The maid was a long time gone.
‘Miss Aroma says he went out first thing this morning,’ she reported when she
eventually returned.
The others were incredulous.
‘That’s ridiculous. How could he possibly have gone out? The girl must have got the
message wrong.’
They sent Ebony over to ask again; but Ebony only confirmed what the first maid had
said.
‘Yes, lie really has gone out. It seems that one of his friends has died and he’s had
to go out to condole.’
‘That’s absolutely absurd,’ said Tan-chun. ‘Whatever the reason, he can’t possibly
have gone out today. Fetch Aroma here and I’ll speak to her myself.’
As if anticipating a summons, Aroma herself walked in while she was saying this. Li
Wan tackled her at once.
‘There’s absolutely no justification for his going out today, whatever the reason,’
she said. ‘In the first place it’s Mrs Lian’s birthday and Her Old Ladyship was
particularly anxious that we should all join in celebrating it this year: it’s monstrous
that he should go off on his own like this when everyone else from both houses is
here for the celebration. And in the second place this is the first regular meeting of
our poetry club and he hasn’t even asked leave to stay away.’
Aroma sighed miserably.
‘Last night he told me that he had some important business to attend to first thing
this morning. He said he had to go to the Prince of Beijing’s palace, but that he would
be back again as soon as possible. I told him not to go, but he insisted. When he got
up first thing this morning, he asked for a suit of mourning to wear. It looks as if some
important person in the Prince of Beijing’s household must have died.’
‘If that’s really so,’ said Li Wan, ‘then he ought to have gone. But then, on the other
hand, he ought to have got back by now.’
After a brief discussion the cousins decided to proceed without him and to punish
him in some way when he returned. Before they could begin, however, a summons
arrived from Grandmother Jia to join her in the mansion. As soon as they had done
so, Aroma reported Bao-yu’s absence. The old lady was displeased and sent someone
to fetch him back.
Bao-yu, evidently with some secret business on his mind, had spoken the day before
to Tealeaf about this excursion,
‘I have to go out first thing tomorrow,’ he told him. ‘I want you to be waiting for me
outside the back gate with two horses ready saddled. No one else is to accompany
me but you. Tell Li Gui that I am going to the Prince of Beijing’s, and that he must
stop anyone going out to look for me. He can tell them that the Prince is detaining
me and that I shall come back as soon as I can get away.’
Though somewhat mystified by these orders, Tealeaf felt he had no choice but to
follow them out, and before dawn next morning was waiting with two horses ready
saddled outside the tear gate of the Garden. As soon as it was light, Bao-yu, dressed
in heavy mourning, emerged from the postern, leaped onto one of the waiting horses,
and crouching down over the reins, set off at a brisk trot down the street—all
without utter?ing a single word.
Tealeaf leaped onto the second horse, gave it the whip, and did his best to catch up
with Bao-yu, at the same time shouting after him to inquire where they were going.
‘Where does this road lead to?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘This is the main road to the North Gate,’ said Tealeaf. Outside the city it’s pretty
deserted in that direction. You won’t find much to amuse you there.’
Good,’ said Bao-yu. The more deserted the better.’
And by applying the whip he made his horse shoot on ahead, and presently, after a
couple of turns, had left the city gate behind him.
Tealeaf, more mystified than ever, followed him as closely as he could. When they
had galloped without stopping for two or three miles, in the course of which the
signs of human habitation had gradually grown more and more sparse, Bao-yu finally
reined to a halt and turned back to ask Tealeaf if there was anywhere where they
could purchase some incense.
‘I dare say we could find somewhere,’ said Tealeaf without much conviction. ‘It
depends what kind of incense you want.’
Bao-yu reflected for some moments.
‘Honeybush, sandal and lakawood,’ he said. ‘It has to be those three.’
‘I doubt if you’ll be able to get them,’ said Tealeaf, smiling at the na?veté of one
who could expect to make such purchases in such a place. But when he saw that
Bao-yu was genuinely distressed, he added: What’s it for? I’ve noticed that you often
carry powdered incense in that sachet you wear. Why not see if you’ve got any in
that?’
Bao-yu, glad to be reminded, extracted the silk purse that he wore suspended from
his neck underneath the front fold of his gown, felt inside it with his fingers, and was
delighted to find that there was still a pinch or two of powdered agalloch in the
bottom.
‘Seems a bit lacking in respect to use this though,’ he thought.
‘Still, it’s more respectful to use something I’ve carried all the way here myself than
it would be to use something I’d just bought in a shop.’
Having decided that the powdered incense would do, he asked Tealeaf where he
could get hold of an incense-burner and some fire.
‘Now those we can’t get,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Where could we, out here in the middle of
the wilds? If you knew you were going to need them, why didn’t you tell me
beforehand, and we could have brought them with us?’
‘Stupid idiot I’ said Bao-yu. ‘Do you honestly think we could have ridden out at this
break-neck pace if we’d been carrying an incense-burner full of hot coals with us?’
Tealeaf, after some moments of reflection, smiled uncertainly:
‘I know what we could do, Master, though I don’t know what you’ll think of the
idea. There’s little enough hope of our getting the things you’ve just asked for round
here, and the chances are that even if we could, you’d only start thinking of
something else you needed that was even harder to get. Now if we were to go on for
about another two thirds of a mile in this direction, we should come to the Temple of
the Water Spirit Bao-yu pricked up his ears.
‘The Temple of the Water Spirit? Is that near here? Good. That will do even better.
Let’s go there then.’
With a touch of the whip he was away once more, still talk?ing to Tealeaf over his
shoulder as he rode ahead.
‘The nun at the Water Spirit is one of our regular callers. If I see her when we get
there and tell her we want to use one of her burners, she’s sure to let us.’
‘Even if this wasn’t one of the temples we subscribe to,’ said Tealeaf, ‘I’m sure they
wouldn’t dare refuse if you asked them. But why is it that today you are so willing to
go to the Temple of the Water Spirit when normally you can scarcely abide to hear it
mentioned?’
‘The reason I normally feel that way about it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘is because I hate the
silly, senseless way in which vulgar people offer worship and build temples to gods
they know nothing about. Ignorant old men and women with too much money to
spend hear the name of some god or other—they’ve no idea who it is, but the mere
fact that they’ve heard it from the lips of some ballad-singer or story-teller seems to
them incontrovertible proof of the god’s existence—and go found?ing temples in
which these fictitious deities can he worshipped.
‘Take this Temple of the Water Spirit. The reason it’s called that is because the
divinity worshipped in it is supposed to be the goddess of the river Luo. Now in point
of fact no Goddess of the Luo ever existed. She was an invention of the poet Cao Zhi.
But that didn’t stop a lot of people making an image of her and worshipping it.
‘The only reason I feel differently about this temple today is because the idea of a
water-goddess just happens to fit in with the thing that is at the moment uppermost
in my mind; so I’m glad to make use of it for my own purpose.’
By this time they had reached the gate of the temple. The old nun who kept it, hardly
less surprised to hear of Bao-yu’s arrival than she would have been if she had been
told that a dragon had just fallen, alive and kicking, out of the sky, hur?ried out to
greet him, and ordered the old temple-servant who did duty as a porter to take care
of the horses.
Bao-yu went on inside. Instead of bowing down before the image, however, he stood
and contemplated it appraisingly. Though the goddess was only a thing of wood and
plaster and paint, the sculptor who made her had succeeded in capturing some of
the spirit of Cao Zhi’s famous description. To Bao?-yu’s gazing eyes she did indeed
appear as the poet portrayed her:

             Fluttering like the wing-beats of a startled swan,
             Swaying with the lissome curves of a water-dragon...

Cao Zhi’s beautiful images came crowding into his mind:

             Like a lotus flower emerging from the green water,
             Like the morning sun rising above the mist-bank...

And as he gazed and remembered, the tears coursed down his cheeks.
The old nun now appeared with some tea. While he sipped it, Bao-yu took the
opportunity of asking her if he might borrow an incense-burner. At this she
disappeared once more, to reappear, after considerable delay, carrying not only a
burner but also a whole portion of incense and a set of garishly printed
‘picture-offerings’. Refusing all but the burner, Bao-yu made Tealeaf carry it outside
into the rear courtyard of the temple, where he set about choosing a suitably dean
spot on
which to make his offering. Nowhere would do, however, until Tealeaf suggested
placing the burner on the stone plat?form of the well. To this suggestion Bao-yu
assented with a nod, and when Tealeaf had set down the burner and retired to a
respectful distance, he took out his pinch of agalloch and dropped it on the burning
charcoal; then, with tears in his eyes, he knelt down and made, not a kotow, but the
sort of half-obeisance one makes to the spirit of a junior or a servant.
Having concluded his little ceremony, Bao-yu got up and ordered Tealeaf to take the
burner back into the temple. But Tealeaf, though saying that he would, did nothing of
the kind. Instead he threw himself on his knees, kotowed several times, and began
praying aloud in the direction of the well
‘O spirit, in all the years I have served Master Bao this is the first time he has ever
kept anything from me. But though I don’t know who you are, O spirit, and don’t like
to ask, one thing I do know, and that is that you are sure to be some won?drously
beautiful, clever, refined young female. And since Master Bao isn’t able to tell you
Out loud what he wants of you, I, Tealeaf, am praying to you on his behalf.
‘I beseech you, if you still have feelings as you used to when you were on earth,
watch over my master from time to time, O spirit. I know you belong to a different
world now, but being as it’s for a special friend of yours that I’m asking this, please do
it if you can, spirit, for old time’s sake.
‘And please use what influence you can to see that Master Bao is reborn in his next
life as a girl, so that he can spend all his time with you; and don’t let him be reborn as
one of those horrible Whiskered Males he is always on about.’
At this point he knocked his head several more times on the ground. Bao-yu, who
had been listening, could no longer hold back his laughter. Observing that Tealeaf had
raised him?self once more on all fours and appeared to be about to go on, he kicked
him and told him to get up.
‘Stop this nonsense! If anyone hears you, I shall become a laughing-stock.’
Tealeaf scrambled to his feet, picked up the burner and fol?lowed Bao-yu inside.
‘I’ve already spoken to the nun about getting you some food,’ he told Bao-yu as
they were going in together. ‘I told her you hadn’t eaten yet. You ought to get
something inside you. I realize that you came out here because there’s a big party
and lots of racket at home today and you wanted some?where peaceful where you
could do this. But I think just stay?ing out here in the quiet all day is showing all the
respect you need to this person you’ve just made the offering to. You don’t need to
fast all day as well. That’s out of the question.’
‘That seems reasonable,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As I’m missing the patty all the time that I’m
here, I am in a way abstaining al?ready; so I suppose there can be no harm in my
taking a bit of vegetarian stuff.’
‘I’m glad to hear you say so,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Of course, there is another way of
looking at it. Your going off like this is sure to cause others at home to worry. Now if
no one at home was likely to worry, there’d be no harm in our not going back until
evening. But since they are going to worry, I really think you ought to be getting back
soon. For one thing it will set Their Ladyships’ minds at rest, and for another, it will, in
the long run, be more respectful to this person you’ve just made the offering to.
Because if you go home, even if you drink and watch plays, it won’t be because you
want to, but out of duty to Their Ladyships. Whereas if you stay out here thinking
only about the spirit and not caring how worried you make Their Ladyships, you’ll in
fact be making the spirit herself uneasy to think of all the anxiety that’s being caused
on her behalf. Think it over, Master Bao, and see if you don’t agree with me.’
‘I can see what’s on your mind without much difficulty,’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
‘You’re afraid that as you are the only one who came out here with me, you will bear
all the blame for this outing when we get back. That’s the real reason why I’m being
treated to all this high-minded advice, isn’t it? Well, don’t worry! It was all along my
intention to go back to the party when I had made the offering. I never said anything
about staying out here all day. I’ve discharged my vow. If I hurry home now so that
the others aren’t too worried, it seems to me that my obligations to the dead and the
living swill both be met.’
Tealeaf expressed his relief. Still talking, they made their way to the old nun’s parlour,
or hall of meditation’, where they found she had set out a very presentable (though,
of course, vegetarian) repast for them. After briefly sampling it, the two of them
mounted and set off again along the road by which they had come Bao-yu at such a
pace that Tealeaf was obliged to call out after him to slacken it.
‘Go easy on that horse, Master Bad! He hasn’t been ridden very much; you need to
keep a pretty tight rein on him.’
Soon they had entered the city gate, and not long after-wards might have been seen
slipping into the back gate of the Garden. Bao-yu hurried straight to Green Delights,
which he found deserted except for a few old nannies left behind as care-takers.
‘Holy Name!’ they said, their old faces lighting up with pleasure when they saw
who it was. ‘You’ve come at last! You’ve had Miss Aroma nigh out of her mind with
worry. They’re sitting at table in the front now, Master. Better hurry up and join
them.’
Bao-yu quickly took off his mourning clothes and went off to look for something
more colourful to change into.
‘Where is the party?’ he asked the old women as soon as he had dressed.
‘In the new reception room.’
He hurried, by the shortest route, towards the faint sounds of fluting and singing that
could soon be heard coming from the so-called ‘new’ reception hall that the old
women had referred to. As he approached the gallery through which he must pass to
reach it, he came upon Silver, sitting under the eaves of the covered way and crying.
She left off hurriedly when she saw him coming.
‘Here comes the phoenix at last!’ she said sarcastically. ‘Hurry up and go inside. If
you stay away much longer, there’ll be a riot!’
Bao-yu smiled at her sympathetically.
‘Guess where I’ve been.’
She ignored his question and turned away from him to wipe her eyes. He hurried on,
dejected because of his inability to comfort her. When he entered the hall were the
others were assembled and went up to greet his grandmother and his mother, it
really was as if a phoenix had appeared. Hurriedly he made his birthday kotow to
Xi-feng.
‘What do you mean by going off on your own like that?’ Grandmother Jia grumbled.
‘I never heard of such a thing. If this happens again, I shall tell your father when he
comes back and get him to give you another beating.’
Bao-yu’s pages came in next for her censure.
‘Why do they listen to him - rushing off like that whenever he tells them to? They
should tell us first. Where have you been, anyway?’ she asked him. ‘Have you had
anything to eat? Has anything happened to give you a fright?’
‘The Prince of Beijing’s favourite concubine died yester?day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I went to
condole with him. He was in such a state when I got there that I didn’t like to leave
im?mediately. That’s why I’ve been so long.’
‘If you sneak out again without first telling us,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘I really shall
tell your Pa to beat you.’
Though Bao-yu promised to obey, she still wanted to have his pages whipped; but the
others all begged for a reprieve:
‘Don’t take it to heart, Grandmother! He’s already said he won’t do it again. And
anyway, he’s back now, so we can for?get our worries and concentrate on enjoying
ourselves’
Grandmother Jia had in fact been extremely worried and her anxiety had made her
vengeful. Now that Bao-yu was back and she was no longer worried, her vengeful
feelings evapor?ated and the subject of beatings was quickly dropped. Her concern
now was lest Bao-yu should have been unduly dis?tressed by his visit, or have failed
to eat enough while he was away, or have been involved in some accident on the way
there or back. While she continued to fuss over him, Aroma took her place at his side
to wait upon him, and the rest of the company resumed the play-watching which his
arrival had interrupted.
The play being performed on this occasion was The Wooden Hairpin. Grandmother
Jia and the other ladies found it greatly affecting, shedding copious teats in the
course of it and sighing or cursing in the appropriate places.
The events that ensued will be told in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 44

Xi-feng’s jealousy is the object of an unexpected provocation
And Patience’s toilet is a source of unexpected delight



BAO-YU having now taken his place amongst the girls, they and the rest of the
company were once more able to give their undivided attention to the players.
The play being performed on this occasion was, as we noted at the end of the
previous chapter, The Wooden Hairpin, and it chanced that they had reached that
section of it popularly re?ferred to as ‘The Husband’s Offering’, in which the hero
Wang Shi-peng, believing that his wife has drowned herself, goes with his aged
mother to the river Ou-jiang to make offerings to her soul. At this point Dai-yu, who
was able to guess what the real purpose of Bao-yu’s early-morning excursion had
been, turned to Bao-chai and remarked, in a voice loud enough for Bao-yu to
overhear, that she thought Wang Shi-peng a ‘very silly sort of fellow
‘He could have made his offering anywhere. Why was it necessary for him to go
rushing off to the riverside to make it? They say that “objects aid recall”: well, since
all the water in the world comes ultimately from a single source, a bowlful of it
scooped up anywhere should have sufficed. His feelings could have been just as
effectively relieved by weeping over a bowlful of water as by rushing off to the banks
of the river.’
Bao-chai made no reply. Bao-yu, who had certainly heard her, turned away and called
for hot wine to drink Xi-feng’s health with.
Grandmother Jia was determined that this should be a day like no other and that
Xi-feng should derive the greatest possible enjoyment from it. Not feeling sufficiently
energetic to sit with the rest, however, she had retired to the inner room with Aunt
Xue, reclining on a couch there in a position from which it was still possible to watch
the players. A small selection from the dishes which had covered the two tables laid
for her outside had been set down within easy reach where she could pick at them
while conversing with Aunt Xue. The remainder she had made over to the maids and
older women on duty who had not been catered for, bidding them take their banquet
outside on to the verandah where they could sit down and enjoy themselves without
restraint.
Lady Wang and Lady Xing also sat in this inner room, not on the kang, where
Grandmother Jia’s couch had been placed, but at a high-topped table on the floor
below. The young people sat at a number of tables in the outer room. From time to
time Grandmother Jia would give orders to You-shi to make sure that Xi-feng was
enjoying herself.
‘Make her sit at the head. Why isn’t she sitting at the head? It’s up to you to act as
hostess on my behalf,’ she told You?-shi. ‘The poor child is run off her feet all the rest
of the year. Today I want her to be made a fuss of.’
You-shi went off to do her bidding, but shortly afterwards returned, a smile on her
face, to announce that Xi-feng was being difficult.
‘She says she’s not used to sitting at the head. She says it makes her uncomfortable.
And she refuses to drink anything.’
‘If you can’t make her, I shall have to come out and deal with her myself,’ said
Grandmother Jia, laughing.
This brought Xi-feng herself running up. She spoke to Grandmother Jia from behind
You-shi’s shoulder.
‘Don’t believe her, Grannie. I’ve had lots and lots to drink.’
‘Now look here,’ said Grandmother Jia to You-shi, ‘I want you to march this young
woman back to her seat and force her to sit down in it. Then I want every one of you
here to drink with her in turn. If she still refuses, I really and truly shall come out and
deal with her myself.’
You-shi hauled Xi-feng out again, cal1ed for larger cups to be brought, and poured
her out some wine.
There you are, my darling! In token of my appreciation of the noble way in which you
have served Lady Jia and Lady Wang and me during the past year, please accept this
cup of wine that I have poured out for you with my own fair hand!’
‘If you are really serious about wanting to show me your appreciation,’ said Xi-feng,
‘you ought to offer it to me kneel?ing down.’
‘Just listen to that!’ said You-shi. ‘I’ll tell you something, my girl you just don’t
realize how lucky you are. For all you know, things may never be as good as this for
you again. If I were you, I’d have a good booze-up while you can. Come on, two cups!’
You-shi was so insistent that in the end Xi-feng had to drink two whole cupfuls from
the larger cups. After that the cousins came up one by one to drink with her, which
meant that she had to take at least a sip or two with each of them. Then old Mrs Lai,
observing with what high spirits Grand-mother Jia was watching these antics,
determined to join in the fun too, and came over, with the other old nannies, to drink
Xi-feng’s health along with all the rest. Because of the seniority of this group, it
would have been difficult for Xi-eng to refuse them, so with each of them too she
had to take a couple of sips. But when Faithful and the maids came trooping up, it
was more than flesh and blood could bear and she begged to be excused.
Really, my dears, I couldn’t. Let me put it off until to?morrow.’
Faithful pretended to take umbrage.
‘I call that most insulting! Even Her Ladyship treats me with more consideration. I
used to think that I counted for something round here, but now, after being put in my
place in front of all these others, I can see that I did wrong to come. Well, if you
won’t drink, I’m going!’
She turned away and began marching out, but Xi-feng ran after and detained her.
‘No, please! I’ll drink,’
She fetched the wine herself, filled a cup to the brim with it’ and drank it down to the
last drop, up-ending it afterwards to show that it was dry. At that Faithful laughed
and went away content.
As soon as she had resumed her seat, Xi-feng knew that she had drunk too much. Her
heart was pounding in her throat and she felt an overwhelming desire to go back
home and lie down. But the leader of the jugglers was bearing down on her.
‘Give this man his money,’ she said, turning to You-shi, ‘I have to go home to wash.’
You-shi nodded, and Xi-feng, choosing a moment when no one was looking, slipped
outside and made her way along the outside of the hall under the shadow of the
eaves. Patience, who had seen her go and was concerned about her, hurried after
and gave her some support.
As they approached the passage-way which led from Grand?mother Jia’s rear
courtyard to the gallery in the midst of the little enclosure surrounded by wails and
buildings which had once been the scene of Jia Rui’s night-long sufferings, they
recognized one of the junior maids from their own apartment standing there, who, as
soon as she caught sight of them, turned tail and ran, Xi-feng at once became
suspicious and called out after her. The little maid at first pretended not to hear, but
when the shouting behind her continued, could no longer keep up the pretence and
had to turn about and face them.
Xi-feng’s suspicions were now thoroughly aroused. Ad?vancing into the gallery and
calling the maid back into it, she first made Patience close the partitions, so that they
were com?pletely cut off from the outside, then, seating herself on the gallery’s
stone plinth and ordering the maid to kneel down in front of her, she told Patience in
a fierce, loud voice to fetch two pages from the inner gate with a rope and whips to
‘flog to a jelly’ this abominable creature who had so little regard for the presence of
her mistress. The wretched girl, already half-dead with fright, now wept for terror
and knocked her head repeatedly on the ground, entreating Xi-feng for mercy.
‘I’m not a ghost,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’re supposed to stand still and wait when you see
me coming. What do you mean by running away from me like that?’
‘I didn’t see you at first, ma’am,’ said the little girl tearfully. ‘I was running because
I’d just remembered that there was no one at home to look after things.’
‘If there’s no one at home, you had no business to go out in the first place,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘And even if you didn’t see me, you must have heard me calling you. Patience
and I shouted to you at the tops of our voices ten or a dozen times, but you only ran
the faster. We weren’t all that far away from you, either, and you certainly aren’t deaf.
How dare you lie to me!’
She raised her hand and dealt the girl a slap on the cheek that made her reel, quickly
followed by a second slap on the other cheek. An angry red patch swelled up
instantly on either side of the girl’s face.
‘Don’t, madam. You’ll hurt your hand,’ Patience pleaded.
‘Hit her for me, then,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and ask her why she ran away. If she still won’t
talk, tear her lips!’
At first the maid tried sticking to her story, but when she heard that Xi-feng was going
to heat an iron red-hot and burn her mouth with it, she broke down and tearfully
confessed that Jia Lian was at home and had stationed her in the passage-way to look
out for her mistress and give him warning of her coming; hut as Xi-feng had left the
party so much earlier than expected, she had been taken unawares.
This seemed to Xi-feng to have the ring of truth about it.
‘Why did he ask you to look out for me?’ she asked. ‘Surely I’m allowed to go back
to my own room? There must have been a reason. Tell me. If you do, from now on I
shall love you and be your friend. But if you don’t, I shall take a knife and cut your
flesh with it!’
To reinforce her threat, she plucked a formidable hairpin from her hair and jabbed it
violently in the neighbourhood of the girl’s mouth, causing her to dodge this way and
that from it in terror.
‘I’ll tell, madam, I’ll tell. Only please don’t let him know that it was me that told
you,’ she wept and implored.
Patience begged Xi-feng not to hurt the girl, at the same time urging the girl to make
a clean breast of what she had to say. The story then came out.
‘Mr Lian came in a while ago and had a bit of a nap. When he woke up, he sent
someone to see what you were doing. They brought word back that your birthday
party had only just started and you wouldn’t be back for ages, so he opened the
chest and took out two pieces of silver and two hairpins and two lengths of satin and
told me to go and give them in secret to Bao Er’s missus and tell her to come over. So
then she came over to our room and Mr Lian made me go and wait in the passage
here and look out for you. And that’s really all I know.’
Xi-feng was by now shaking all over with anger. She pulled herself to her feet
notwithstanding and strode off swiftly towards the house. As she approached the
gateway of the court?yard, another little maid popped her head out but quickly drew
it in again and ran when she saw that it was Xi-feng. When Xi-feng called to her by
name, however, this maid, being more quick-witted than the other one, neither went
on retreating nor stood still, but simply turned about and came running up to Xi-feng
outside, an obsequious little smile upon her face.
‘Oh madam, I was just going over to tell you when I saw you coming here yourself.’
‘Tell me what?’ said Xi-feng.
The girl then proceeded to relate voluntarily what the other girl had just told under
duress.
Xi-feng spat contemptuously.
‘You’ve left it a bit late, haven’t you—waiting until you see me and then trying to
act the innocent?’
She raised her hand and struck the girl a blow that sent her staggering, then,
tiptoeing across the courtyard, applied her ear to the window to hear what was going
on inside.
The first thing she heard was a laugh and a woman’s voice.
‘The best thing that could happen to you,’ it was saying, ‘would be if that hell-cat
wife of yours was to die.’
‘Suppose she did,’ Jia Lian’s voice said in answer, ‘and I married another one who
turned out to be just as bad?’
‘If she was to die,’ said the first voice, ‘you ought to make Patience your Number
One. I’m sure she’d be better than this one.’
‘Patience won’t let me come near her nowadays,’ said Jia Lian. ‘She has a lot to put
up with, the same as me, that she doesn’t dare talk about. I don’t know, I reckon I
must have been born under a hen-pecked husbands’ star!’
Xi-feng heard this shaking with fury. The couple’s praise of Patience made her at once
suspect that Patience had been com?plaining about her behind her back. The fumes
of wine mounted up inside her, clouding her judgement. Without pausing to reflect,
she turned and struck Patience twice before kicking open the door and striding into
the room. There, without more ado, she proceeded to seize hold of Bao Er’s wife and
belabour her, breaking off only to block the doorway with her body in case Jia Lian
might think of escaping.
‘Filthy whore!’ she shouted. ‘Stealing a husband isn’t enough for you, it seems. You
have to murder his wife as well!’ She turned to Patience: ‘Go on, Patience, your place
is over there with them—with that whoremaster of yours and his other whore!
You’re all three in this together. You hate me just as much as they do under that
smarmy outside of yours I’
This was followed by several blows.
Poor Patience, overwhelmed by so much injustice, had only Bao Er’s wife on whom
she could vent her feelings.
‘If you have to do these shameful things,’ she said, ‘you might at least leave me out
of it.’ And she began to pummel the woman in her turn.
Now Jia Lian had had a good deal to drink that day, and because of the euphoric state
he was in, had taken insufficient precautions against surprise. Xi-feng’s unexpected
arrival had therefore left him completely at a loss. But Patience’s outburst was
another matter. The wine he had drunk rekindled his for?gotten valour; and whereas
the anger and shame he felt at seeing Xi-feng beat Bao Er’s wife had rendered him
speech?less, the sight of Patience doing the same thing so roused his valiancy that he
shouted at her and gave her a kick.
‘Little whore! You want to join in too, do you?’
Patience, whose gentle nature was easily overawed, at once left off, tearfully
protesting that it was cruel of them to speak about her in such a way behind her
back.
Xi-feng, furious that Patience should be afraid of Jia Lian, rushed over and began
striking her again, insisting that she should go on beating Bao Er’s wife and take no
notice of him. Finding herself thus attacked on both sides simultaneously by the pair
of them, Patience became so desperate that she dashed from the room, vowing that
she would find a knife and kill herself, and would undoubtedly have done herself an
injury if the maids and nannies from outside had not seized her and gradually talked
her out of it.
Xi-feng’s reaction when Patience dashed off threatening suicide was to ram her head
into Jia Lian’s chest and shout hysterically.
‘You’re all in league against me, and now you’re trying to frighten me because I
overheard you. I don’t care. Kill me! Strangle me!’
Jia Lian, in a fury, snatched a sword down from the wall and drew it from its
scabbard.
‘There’s no need for any of you to talk about suicide. I’m desperate too. I’ll kill the
lot of you and swing for it. That’ll make a clean end of the business!’
Just as the rumpus was at its height, You-shi arrived with a crowd of others.
‘What on earth is happening? A moment ago everyone was enjoying themselves,
and now here you all are shouting at each other!’
With the arrival of this audience Jia Lian pretended to be even drunker than he really
was, striking a fiercely threatening attitude and behaving as if he was seriously
intending to kill Xi-feng with his sword. Xi-feng, on the other hand, dropped me
shrewishness she had up to then been showing as soon as she saw them come and,
breaking quickly away, ran weeping to Grandmother Jia.
The play had already ended when Xi-feng burst in upon the aged matriarch and flung
herself trembling upon her bosom.
‘Save me, Grannie, save me! Mr Lian is going to kill me!’
‘What?’ cried Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing and Lady Wang in startled simultaneity.
‘When I went home just now to change my clothes,’ Xi-feng tearfully related, ‘I was
surprised to hear Mr Lian indoors talking to somebody. I was scared to go in straight
away, thinking it must be a guest, so I listened for a while outside the window. Then I
found that it wasn’t a guest that he was with but Bao Er’s wife, and they were saying
what a tyrant I was and planning to poison me so that he could marry Patience. I
became very angry then; but I didn’t want to make a scene with him. I struck
Patience a couple of times. All I did to him was ask him why he should want to kill me,
but he was so much put out by that that be tried to murder me on the spot.’
Grandmother Jia, believing this farrago to be true, was naturally appalled.
‘How dreadful! Bring the wretch here at once!’
But before the words were out of her mouth, Jia Lian him-self came running in,
sword in hand, with a crowd pursuing at his heels.
Grandmother Jia had always treated Jia Lian and Xi-feng with indulgence, and on this
occasion Jia Lian seemed to think that he could presume on this to riot in her
presence with impunity, totally disregarding the fact that his mother and aunt were
there as well. This deliberate flouting of their authority by a licensed favourite greatly
incensed the two ladies. They seized hold of him with angry scoldings, one on either
side.
‘Disgusting creature! Have you no sense of decency left whatever? Can’t you see
that Grandmother is here?’
‘It’s because Grandmother spoils her so much that she has become the way she is,’
said Jia Lian, leering at them through bloodshot eyes.
Lady Xing, having at last succeeded in wresting the sw6rd from his grasp, shouted at
him fiercely.
‘Get out of here at once!’
But Jia Lian remained where he was and went on talking and talking in the same
leering, disgusting manner, like a little boy who expects his naughtiness to be
admired. Grand?mother Jia, in a voice which shook with anger, uttered the only
threat that she knew would shift him.
‘I realize that we count for nothing with you. Fetch his father, some one, and see if
he’ll go then.’
At that Jia Lian finally shambled out. Sulkily avoiding the conjugal apartment, he took
himself off to his study outside.
After he had gone, Lady Xing and Lady Wang turned on Xi-feng and began scolding
her; but Grandmother Jia did what she could to comfort her by dismissing the
incident as unimportant.
‘Young men of his age are like hungry pussy-cats, my dear. There’s simply no way of
holding them. This sort of thing has always happened in big families like
ours—certainly ever since I can remember. It’s all my fault, anyway. I shouldn’t have
made you drink so much wine. It’s all turned to vinegar inside you.’
This made everyone laugh.
‘Don’t worry,’ she went on.’ I’ll see that he apologizes to you tomorrow. Just for
tonight, though, so as not to put him too much out of countenance, I think you had
better stay away from him.’
Her voice became harsher when she remembered Patience.
‘Little wretch! I always thought she seemed such a nice girl. To think that
underneath it all she should have been so wicked!’
You-shi laughed.
‘There’s nothing wrong with Patience. She just happened to be the person nearest
at hand for Feng to work off her spleen on. When Feng and Lian are angry with one
another, they both take it out on Patience. The poor girl is terribly unjustly treated.
Don’t you go taking sides against her as well!’
‘Oh well, that’s all right;’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I must say, she never struck me as
a wily seductress. In that case, of course, I’m sorry for the poor child—bearing the
brunt of it all when she is the innocent party.’
She called Amber to her.
‘Amber, I want you to take a message to Patience for me. Tell her—and I want you
to make it quite clear that the mes?sage comes from me personally—that I know she
has been unjustly treated and I shall make her mistress apologize to her tomorrow.
Only tell her not to make a fuss about it today, because it is her mistress’s birthday.’
*

Patience was at this time in Prospect Garden, whither she had been carried off at the
earliest opportunity by Li Wan and where, as soon as they were indoors, she had
collapse in a sobbing heap, resisting all attempts at lifting her. Bao-chai tried
reasoning with her.
‘Come, Patience, you are an intelligent girl. Think how well your mistress treats you
normally. Just because she’s got a bit drunk today and taken it out on you—why, it
shows how close you are to each other! You wouldn’t want her to take it out on
anyone else, would you? Everyone else is laughing at her for being such a drunken
silly. If you alone insist on—taking it so tragically, it will begin to look as if your
reputation for good sense was undeserved.’
Just then Amber came in with the message from Grand?mother Jia, and Patience,
conscious of the aura of prestige it gave her, began gradually to perk up a bit. She
remained in the Garden, however, and made no attempt to return to her mistress.
After she had sat with Patience and rested for a while, Li Wan, together with Bao-chai
and the rest of the girls, went back to see Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng, whereupon
Bao-yu invited Patience over to Green Delights. Aroma gave her an enthusiastic
welcome.
‘I’d like to have asked you here in the first place, but I saw that Mrs Zhu and the
young ladies were taking care of you, so I didn’t like to interfere.’
Patience’s face was smiling as she thanked her, but fell again almost immediately.
‘I can’t understand it, I really can’t. I’d done absolutely nothing to deserve such
treatment.’
‘Oh, it was a passing fit of anger,’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t suppose Mrs Lian knew what
she was doing. Look how well she treats you normally.’
‘I wasn’t thinking so much of Mrs Lian,’ said Patience. ‘It’s what that hateful woman
said. Why should she want to amuse herself at my expense? And then for that stupid
master of mine to go and beat me—!’
Once more the sense of injustice overcame her and she could not restrain her tears.
‘Don’t be upset, Patience!’ said Bao-yu consolingly. ‘I offer you an apology on their
behalf’
Patience laughed.
‘It has nothing to do with you.’
‘We’re all cousins,’ said Bao-yu. ‘What one of us does concerns all the others. If
they have done you an injury, it’s up to me to apologize.’
He turned his attention to her appearance.
‘What a pity! You’ve made your new dress all damp. Aroma’s dresses are in here.
Why don’t you change into one of hers, then you can spray some samshoo on this
one and iron it? You’ll need to do your hair again as well.’
He called to the junior maids to fetch water for washing and heat a flat-iron.
Up to this moment Patience had known only by hearsay of the remarkable
understanding shown by Bao-yu in his deal?ings with girls. He had deliberately kept
away from her in the past, knowing her to be Xi-feng’s confidante and (he sup?posed)
Jia Lian’s cherished concubine. It had indeed been a source of frequent regret to him
that he had been unable to show her how much he admired her. Seeing him like this
for the first time, Patience reflected on the truth of what she bad heard.
‘He really has thought of everything,’ she told herself, as she watched Aroma open
up a large chest—specially for her and select two scarcely worn garments from it for
her to change into. Then, since the water had already arrived, she took off her own
dress and skirt and quickly washed her face. Bao-yu, who stood by smiling while she
washed, now urged her to put on some make-up.
‘If you don’t, it will look as if you are sulking,’ he said ‘After all, it is Feng’s birthday,
and Grandma did specially send someone to cheer you up.’
Inwardly acknowledging the reasonableness of this advice, Patience looked round her
for some powder, but could not see any, whereupon Bao-yu darted over to the
dressing-table and removed the lid from a box of Early Ming blue-and-white
porcelain in which reposed the head of a white day my with five compact, stick like
buds on either side of the stem. Pinch?ing off one of these novel powder-containers,
he handed it to Patience.
‘There you are. This isn’t ceruse, it’s a powder made by crushing the seeds of
garden-jalap and mixing them with per?fume.’
Patience emptied the contents of the tiny phial on to her palm. All the qualities
required by the most expert perfumers were there: lightness, whiteness with just the
faintest tinge of rosiness, and fragrance. It spread smoothly and cleanly on the skin,
imparting to it a soft bloom -that was quite unlike the harsh and somewhat livid
whiteness associated with lead-based powders.
Then the rouge, too, was different—not in the usual sheets or tissues, but a tiny
white-jade box filled with a crimson substance that looked like comfiture of roses.
‘This is made from safflower, the same as ordinary rouge,’ Bao-yu explained to her,
‘only the stuff they sell in the shops is impure and its colour is inferior. This is made
by squeezing the juice from the best quality safflower, carefully extracting all the
impurities, mixing it with rose water, and then further purifying it by distillation. It’s
so concentrated that you need only a dab of it on the end of a hairpin to do your lips
with and still have enough left over to dilute with water in the palms of your hands
for using on your cheeks.’
Following his directions, Patience found that her com?plexion had acquired a radiant
freshness that she had never seen in it before. At the same time her whole face
seemed to be bathed in the most delectable perfume.
Using a pair of bamboo scissors, Bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of
an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in Patience’s
hair.
At that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to Li Wan’s place and she
had to leave him in a hurry.
Never before had Bao-yu been able to have Patience actually with him so that he
could do things for her. She was such a superior sort of girl, so handsome, so
intelligent, so different from the average run of common, insensitive creatures. His
previous inability to serve her had been a source of deep regret.
Today was—or would have been if -she had lived—Golden’s birthday, and for this
reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning. The row which bad broken
out later in the day between Xi-feng and Jia Lian had proved a godsend. It had at last
given him an opportunity of showing Patience something of what he felt for her. This
was an unlooked-for happiness he might otherwise have waited a lifetime for in vain.
He stretched himself out on his bed in a pleasurable glow of satisfaction.
These pleasant feelings were soon marred by the reflection that a coarse sensualist
like Jia Lian who never considered anything but his own pleasure would certainly
know nothing about the scientific preparation of cosmetics. He thought of Patience
serving that precious couple, alone in the world without parents or brothers and
sisters to defend her, some?how contriving to steer an even course between Jia Lian’s
boorishness on the one hand and Xi-feng’s vindictiveness on the other, yet today, in
spite of all her efforts, falling a victim to their cruelty. Truly her lot was an unhappy
one -mote unhappy even than Dai-yu’s!
At this point in his reflections he became so upset that he began to shed tears, not
bothering on this occasion to restrain them, because Aroma was not there to
disapprove. Getting up from his bed, he went over to inspect Patience’s dress. The
samshoo that had been sprayed on it was now neatly dry. He picked up the iron,
ironed the dress for her, and neatly folded it. Then he noticed that she had left her
handkerchief behind. As it was still marked with tear-stains, he washed it out in the
water she had used for her face and hung it up to dry. Feeling a strange sensation in
which sadness and happiness commingled, he mused for some minutes in silence
before going over to Sweet-rice Village to join the others. He remained there a long
while talking. The lamps had already been lit when he returned.

*

As Patience spent that night at Li Wan’s place and Xi-feng slept with Grandmother Jia,
Jia Lian returned to his room in the evening to find it gloomy and deserted. Not
caring to call for anyone, however, he managed for himself as hest he could and
spent the night there alone. On waking next morning he felt nothing but revulsion
and remorse when he remembered what had happened. His mother, Lady Xing, still
worrying about the drunken exhibition he had made of himself the day before, came
hurrying over first thing to urge him to go with her to see Grandmother Jia. This,
despite the most acute feelings of shame and embarrassment, he now had to do.
‘Well?’ the old lady asked him, when he knelt before her.
‘I had too much to drink yesterday, Grandmother, and I’m afraid I broke in on you
and made a scene. I’ve come here now to apologize.’
Grandmother Jia snorted.
‘Disgusting wretch! If you must go filling yourself with liquor, why can’t you lie
down quietly and sleep it off like a good, sensible creature? Fancy knocking your own
wife about! Feng can normally hold her own against anyone—she’s a regular little
Tyrant King as a rule—but yesterday you’d reduced the poor child to a state of terror.
Suppose I hadn’t been here to protect her and you really had done her an injury,
what would you have had to say for yourself then, I wonder?’
Though smarting under the ludicrous injustice of what she had just said, Jia Lian
knew that he was in no position to argue, and humbly acknowledged his guilt.
‘I should have thought that a couple of beauties like Feng and Patience would have
been enough for you,’ she went on. ‘Why you should need to be forever sniffing after
other skirts and bringing all this disgusting rag-tag and bob-tail back to your own
room, I just do not understand. Fancy beating your own wife and your chamber-wife
for a creature like that! And you a gentleman and member of a distinguished family!
You ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourself. if you have any consideration for my
feelings at all, you’ll get up off the floor now— because you are forgiven as far as I
am concerned—and you’ll apologize handsomely to that poor wife of yours and take
her back home with you. Otherwise you can just take yourself off, for I shan’t accept
your kotow!’
Jia Lian turned and looked at Xi-feng, standing at his grandmother’s side. She was
wearing none of her finery today, her eyes were swollen with weeping, and her face,
pinched and yellow without its make-up, was pathetic and somehow more appealing
than usual.
‘I suppose I’d better apologize,’ .he thought. ‘It will help to patch things up between
us; and it will please the old lady.’
Having so resolved, he looked up at Grandmother Jia with a smile.
‘If that’s what you want, Grandmother, I daren’t disobey you. But it’s going to make
her even more willful than before.’
‘Nonsense I’ said Grandmother Jia, though not ill-humoredly. ‘I know for a fact that
she is a model of wifely behaviour. I am sure she would be quite incapable of
deliber?ately giving offence. If she does ever give you any trouble, I shall see to it
myself that she submits to your authority.’
Jia Lian got to his feet then, and clasping his hands in front of him, made a low bow
to his wife.
‘It was all my fault, Mrs Lian. Please forgive me.’
This was said in so droll a manner that everyone burst out laughing.
‘Now you’re not to be angry any more, Feng,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘or I shall be
angry with you!’
She ordered someone to fetch Patience, and told Jia Lian and Xi-feng that she would
now expect them to make it up with her.
When Jia Lian saw Patience, he was even more ready to pocket his pride for her than
he had been for Xi-feng.

                      There’s no wife like a chamber-wife

as the saying goes, and before anyone else could say a word, he had bounded up to
her and began apologizing.
‘You were very badly treated yesterday, Patience. It was all my fault. It was because
of me that Mrs Lian was so beastly to you. Apart from offering you my own apology,
I’d like to apologize on her behalf as well.’
He clasped his hands again and bowed, once more provok?ing Grandmother Jia to
laughter. This time Xi-feng laughed, too.
Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng that it was now her turn; but before she could do
anything, Patience rushed up to her, threw herself at her feet and kotowed.
‘I made you angry on your birthday, madam. I shall never forgive myself.’
Xi-feng was already feeling remorseful that in her previous day’s drunkenness she
had so far forgotten herself as to humiliate Patience, in spite of all they had always
meant to each other, because of a mere chance-heard remark. Seeing her now so
generous and so lacking in resentment, she was both ashamed and deeply touched.
There were tears on her cheeks as she bent down and raised the girl to her feet.
‘In all the years I’ve served you,’ said Patience, ‘you’ve never laid so much as a
finger on me before. I bear you ‘no grudge for striking me yesterday, madam. It was
all that wicked woman’s doing. I don’t blame you in the least for losing your temper.’
She, too, was crying while she said this.
‘See the three of them back to their room now,’ said Grandmother Jia to her
women. ‘And if you hear another’ word about this, let me know straight away who
said it. I don’t care who it is, I shall take a stick to them myself!’
The three of them now kotowed to Grandmother Jia, to Lady Xing and to Lady Wang;
then the old nannies, bidden once mote to escort them, stepped forward with cries
of obedience and conducted them back to their room.
As soon as the three of them were alone together, Xi-feng started on Jia Lian.
‘Am I really such a hell-cat? Are you really so terribly hen?pecked? When that
woman wished me dead, you agreed with her. Surely I can’t be all that bad? Surely I
must have some good days, even if it’s only one in a thousand? You’ve made it seem
as if I’m worse even than that worthless whore. How can I have the face to go on
living now?’
She began to cry again.
‘Aren’t you satisfied yet?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Just think a bit: who was most to blame
yesterday? Yet today I was the one who had to kneel down in front of everyone and
apologize. You’ve come out of this pretty well. So what are you yammering at me
now for? Do you want me to kneel down again? Here? It doesn’t do to be too greedy,
you know.’
Xi-feng, unable to think of a reply to this, fell silent. Patience giggled.
‘There, it’s all over!’ said Jia Lian, laughing himself. ‘It’s no good. I just can’t help
myself.’
Just then a woman came to the door to report.
‘Bao Er’s wife has hanged herself.’
Jia Lian and Xi-feng were both profoundly shocked; but the look of fear on Xi-feng’s
face was of only momentary duration.
‘Well,’ she said harshly, ‘what of it? Why make such a fuss about it?’
Shortly after this Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife came in and spoke to Xi-feng on the side.
‘Bao Er’s -wife has hanged herself. Her family are talking about taking it to court.’
Xi-feng laughed scornfully.
‘Good! I was thinking of doing the same thing myself.’
‘I’ve just been trying to talk them out of it,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘I tried
frightening them a bit to start with, then I promised them some money if they would
drop it. They seemed to be willing.’
‘I’ve got no money to give them,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and I wouldn’t give it to them if I had.
Let them go ahead and sue. I don’t want you to talk them out of it, or to try
frightening them out of it either. Just let them go ahead and sue. If they lose their
case, I shall bring a suit against them for ex morte blackmail!’
As she stood there in some perplexity to know what to do, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife noticed
that Jia Lian was signaling to her with his eyes. She understood his meaning and went
off to wait for him outside.
Jia Lian followed soon after.
‘I’m just going out to have a look—see what’s going on,’ he said on his way out.
‘You’re not to give them any money I’ Xi-feng shouted after him.
Jia Lian went straight off to discuss the matter with Lin Zhi-xiao himself. As a result of
their discussion, someone was sent to haggle -with the family and promise whatever
seemed necessary, and the family eventually agreed to keep quiet in return for a
payment of two hundred taels ‘towards funeral expenses’. Terrified that they might
change their minds, Jia Lian sent someone to talk to the local magistrate and invited
the police inspector and two or three of the constables in to ‘help with the funeral’.
Seeing the way things were, the family now dared not pursue the matter any further
even if they wanted to, and were obliged to digest in silence whatever they might
feel of grief or anger.
Jia Lian told Lin Zhi-xiao to account for the two hundred taels by adding a bit here
and a bit there on to various items in the Current Expenses account. He also slipped
Bao Er some money of his own and consoled him with a promise that he would pick a
good wife for him at the earliest opportunity to replace the one he had just lost.
Flattered by all the attention he was receiving and grateful for the money, Bao Er was
only too willing to do as he was told and continued to serve Jia Lian with no less
devotion than before. But that is no part of our story.
Whatever internal uneasiness Xi-feng may have felt about these developments,
outwardly she affected complete in?difference. Finding herself alone with Patience
when Jia Lian had gone, she smilingly inquired after her injuries.
I was terribly drunk yesterday,’ she said. ‘I hope you won’t hold it against me, what I
did then. Where did I hit you? Let me have a look.’
‘You didn’t hit me very hard,’ said Patience.
Just at that moment they were interrupted by an announcement from outside.
‘Mrs Zhu and the young ladies are here.’
If you want to know what they had come for, you will have to read the following
chapter.

CHAPTER.45

Sisterly understanding finds expression in words of
sisterly frankness
And autumnal pluviousness is celebrated in verses of
autumnal melancholy



As we were saying at the end of the last chapter, Xi-feng had just begun expressing
her concern for Patience when Li Wan and the cousins walked in. She broke off and
invited them to be seated, and Patience went round and served them all with tea.
‘What a crowd!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Anyone would think I’d sent out an invitation for
something I’
‘There are two things we wanted to see you about,’ said Tan-chun. ‘One is my affair;
the other concerns Xi-chun but also includes instructions from Grandmother.’
‘They must be very important things for a turn-out like this,’ said Xi-feng.
‘We started a poetry club recently,’ said Tan-chun, ‘and the very first time we had a
regular meeting, somebody didn’t turn up. As the rest of us are too soft to apply the
rules our?selves, we want to invite you, as someone we could trust to apply them for
us with iron impartiality, to be our Disciplinary Officer. That’s the first thing. The
second thing concerns this painting of the Garden that Xi-chun has been asked to do.
There are all sorts of things she’ll need for it that she hasn’t got. We spoke to
Grandmother about it and she said that there might still be some things that would
do in the downstairs store-room at the back. She said we ought to have a look, and if
there are, we can use them. Otherwise, anything we haven’t got ourselves we should
send outside for and buy.’
‘I know nothing about poetry,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I couldn’t compose a poem to save my
life. I could come along to eat and drink with you if you like.’
‘You wouldn’t have to compose poems,’ said Tan-chum ‘That’s not what we want
you for. All you have to do is keep an eye on the rest of us, and if you find anyone
slacking or playing truant, decide how they ought to be punished.’
‘Don’t try to fool me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve already guessed. It’s not iron impartiality
you’re after, it’s financial backing. If you’ve got a club, you’re sure to have some
arrangement for taking it in turns to pay the bill, and as you’re short of money,
you’ve thought of this as a means of roping me in so that you can get some out of me.
That’s the real reason for your invita?tion, isn’t it?’
The others laughed.
‘Too bad! You’ve guessed.’
‘You’re like the original Crystal Man, Feng,’ said Li Wan.

                 ‘A heart of crystal in a body of glass.
You can see through everything!’
‘Fancy!’ said Xi-feng, mockingly. ‘The respected elder sister-in-law! The one who’s
put in charge of these young ladies to guide their studies and teach them needlework
and good manners! You encourage them to start a poetry dub, but as soon as the
question of money arises (and incidentally, how much money is involved?—it can’t
surely be very much), you’re not interested: it has nothing to do with you! Now, you
have a monthly allowance of ten taels. Excluding Grand?mother and Aunt Wang -
and they are, after all, ladies of rank and title—that’s twice as much as any of the rest
of us gets. Yet Grandma and Auntie go on about how poor you are: “poor young
widow I” “no means of her own!,’ Oh yes, and be-cause you’ve got a son, you get
another ten taels a month on top of that, which actually makes you equal with
Grandma and Auntie Wang. And you’ve got your land in the Garden, the best plot
there. It’s down in the tithe-book for the highest tithing. And you haven’t got a big
establishment. I doubt there are ten of you there altogether, counting you and Lan
and all the servants, so your outgoings can’t come to very much. And in any case
your food and clothing is all found out of common funds. If one were to add it all up
together, I think your real income must be somewhere in the region of four or five
hundred taels a year. Even if you were to spend one or two hundred a year out of
that on amusements for the girls like this poetry thing, it wouldn’t be for many years.
Another year or two from now and they’ll all be getting mar?ried. And it’s not as if
you were saving up for their dowries, either. That’s hardly likely to be your
responsibility. No, you’re frightened of spending that money of yours, that’s why
you’ve set these girls on to me. I’m supposed to go along like an innocent and eat
and drink myself silly so that next day I can be made to foot the bill. That’s your little
game, isn’t it?’
‘Listen to her, all of you!’ said Li Wan, laughing. ‘I make a single, inoffensive remark
to her, and in return I get this cart-load of ill-bred’ abuse! Really, Feng, what a
mercenary creature you are! You’re just like one of those muddy-legged wretches
who stand haggling in the market-place with a little abacus up one sleeve to do their
calculations on. It’s a good job you were born a girl and brought up in an educated,
upper-class family and that you married into a family of the same sort. If you’d been
born a boy and your family had been poor and un?educated people, I dread to think
what sort of a calculating monster you would have grown up into! Everyone in the
world has to become the object of your calculations. Yester?day it was Patience’s
turn. It’s a wonder you have arms to strike her with, for I’m sure it was a dog’s
stomach you poured all that wine into. None but a dog would have turned on
Patience the way you did. I tell you, I was so angry, I felt like coming straight over and
giving you a piece of my mind. Then I thought it over for a bit and decided not to.
After all, it was your birthday, and as we know, “every dog must have his day”. Also I
was afraid that if I made a fuss I might upset Grandmother. And because I didn’t have
it out with you yesterday, I was still feeling angry about it when I came here to see
you just now. Yet you have the gall to start on me—you who aren’t worthy to pick up
Patience’s shoes! You ought to change places, you two. I’m sure Patience would make
the better mistress.’

It made the girls laugh to hear Li Wan speaking with such unaccustomed heat.
‘Oh, now I understand!’ said Xi-feng, joining in their laughter. ‘It wasn’t about
poetry or painting that you came to see me: it was revenge for Patience you were
after. I didn’t realize that she had so powerful a protector. Now that I do, I shall never
dare to strike her again—not if all the devils in hell are tugging at my elbow! Here,
Patience! Miss Patience! Let me apologize to you in front of Mrs Zhu and the young
ladies. I “did evil in my cups”. Please forgive me.’
The others laughed.
‘There you are!’ said Li Wan to Patience. ‘I told you I’d stick up for you, didn’t I?’
‘It’s all very well for you ladies to joke about it,’ said Patience, ‘but you make me
feel very. uncomfortable.’
‘You’ve no cause to feel uncomfortable,’ said Li Wan. ‘I’ll look after you. You just get
that key and tell your mistress to unlock the store-room and find those things for us.’
‘My dear good Wan, please take these girls back to the Garden,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve
got the rice accounts to go over; I’ve got to see Lady Xing about something (1 don’t
know what, but she’s just sent over to say that she wants me); and I’ve got the New
Year’s clothes to see about. I have to find out what everyone wants and get the
orders placed—’
‘I don’t care in the least about these things,’ said Li Wan airily. ‘You just settle my
business first so that I can go back home and rest and not have these girls pestering
me any more.’
‘Give me a little time!’ said Xi-feng pleadingly. ‘You’re so considerate towards me as
a rule; I don’t know why I’m so Out of favour with you today. I suppose it must be
because of Patience. Often in the past you’ve said to me, “Now I know how busy you
are, Feng, but your health is important: you ought to find means somehow or other
of taking a rest.” That’s what you would normally say in a situation like this; but today
you seem more intent on driving me into an early grave! Incidentally, you may not
think it matters very much if the arrangements for other people’s winter clothing get
put off, but what about the clothing for the girls? Strictly speak?ing that’s your
responsibility. Don’t you think Grandmother would feel that you were taking
non-interference just a little far if she discovered that the girls were going without
winter clothes simply for want of a word from you? You know, of course, that I would
rather get into trouble myself than involve you in trouble...’
‘Listen to her, all of you,’ said Li Wan. ‘Marvellous, isn’t it? I’d like to get hold of that
clever tongue of yours, Feng, and—! Just tell me this one thing, then: are you going
to keep an eye on our poetry club for us or aren’t you?’
‘What a question!’ said Xi-feng. ‘If I refused to join your club and spend my money
in it, I should be declaring myself in open rebellion against the Prospect Garden
Residents’ Association, and heaven help me then!—my life wouldn’t be worth living!
I shall be round first thing tomorrow to report for duty, and the first thing I shall do
will he to pay down fifty taels to be spent as and when you wish on the club’s
entertain?ment. I can t write poetry—or anything else, for that matter—and I’m a
very common, ignorant sort of person to be joining a poetry club; and as for taking
on this disciplinary business: well, whether I do or whether I don’t, I don’t suppose
there’ll be much danger of your expelling me once you’ve seen the colour of my
money.’
The others laughed.
‘I’ll open the store-room presently,’ she continued, ‘and I’ll get them to put out
anything that looks as if it might be of use for you to have a look at. If you can use it,
keep it. Anything you’re still short of after that, I’ll tell them to buy for you outside. I
can get the pongee cut for you straight away. The architect’s drawing isn’t at Lady
Wang’s, by the way; it’s at Cousin Zhen’s place. I’m telling you this to save you a
wasted journey. I can get it for you, if you like; then I can have it taken with the
pongee to Sir Zheng’s gentlemen and ask them to do the sizing for you.’
Li Wan nodded approvingly.
‘That would be very kind. If you’ll really do all that for us, we shall have nothing
more to say. Come on then, everybody I Let’s go home and see what happens. If she
doesn’t send the stuff we can come back and deal with her later.’
She began to leave the room as she said this, the cousins following in her wake.
‘I know of only one person who could have stirred all this up,’ said Xi-feng as they
were going, ‘and that’s Bao-yu.’
The mention of his name stopped Li Wan in her tracks. She came back into the room.
‘I’d completely forgotten: it was Bao-yu that I came about in the first place. He was
the one who failed to turn up at our first meeting. We’re all too soft to know what to
do with him. How do you think we ought to punish him?’
Xi-feng thought for a bit.
‘The only thing I can suggest is that you should make him go round to each of your
apartments in turn and sweep the floors for you.
‘Yes, yes,’ said the others, laughing. ‘The very thing!’
They were just about to leave for the second time when Lai Da’s mother, old Mrs Lai,
came in, leaning on the shoulder of a little maid. Xi-feng and the rest rose to greet
her. They begged her to be seated and offered her their congratulations. The old
woman sat down on the edge of the kang and smiled round at them with pleasure.
‘The way I see it, since you are our employers, our good fortune is really yours. If it
weren’t for your family, how would the likes of us ever have come by a piece of good
fortune like this in the first place? Yesterday when you sent young Sun?shine round
with those presents, my grandson “kotowed up?wards”. in the doorway to show his
gratitude.’
‘When will he be leaving to take up his post?’ said Li Wan. Old Mrs Lai sighed, as
though the thought made her melan?choly.
‘Oh, I don’t concern myself with their affairs. I just let them get on with it. When he
came round to me to kotow the other day, I didn’t have a good word for him. I said to
him, “Young man, don’t tell me you’re a mandarin now, because it’s just plain
ridiculous. Thirty years it is since you were born,” I said, “and all that time, in actual
fact, you’ve :been a bondservant. Yet through the kindness of our Masters you were
set apart from the moment you came out of your mother’s womb. Thanks to the
Masters and your parents,” I said, “you were taught to read and write like a
gentleman’s son and fussed over by a parcel of maids and nannies and wet-nurses as
if you was some sort of young phoenix. I doubt you know how the word
‘bondservant’ is written. You’ve known nothing but soft living since you were born,” I
said. “You don’t know the bitterness your father and your grandfather had to go
through. You don’t appreciate the generations of hardship that went into the making
of a fine gentleman like you. And the money they spent on you,” I said’ “nursing you
through all the fevers and calamities of youth (for you were a sickly, ailing child): it
would have been enough to have made you anew out of silver Then, when you were
twenty, the Master, out of the kindness of his heart, undertook to buy you a place in
the Service, so that your future would be assured. Think how many freeborn
members of the clan go hungry,” I said, “yet be did this fox you, that was born a slave.
Such great fortune should make you fearful. And now, after ten years of fooling
around, you’ve talked the Master—by what jiggery-pokery I do not know -into getting
you selected for a posting. A district magistrate may not be very high in the scale,” I
said, “but the mandarin who goes to a district to be its magistrate is supposed to be
the father and mother of all the people who live there. So mind you don’t go getting
above yourself,” I said. “Do all in your power to show that you are worthy of the trust.
And always let the Master see how much you appreciate what he has done for you.
Otherwise Heaven will surely cast you off.’
Li Wan and Xi-feng both laughed.
‘You worry too much, Mrs Lai,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He’s all right. It’s true we don’t see
much of him nowadays. He used to come in once in a while, but these last few years
all we’ve seen of him has been his visiting-card at New Years and birthdays. He did
come in the other day, however, to kotow to Her Old Ladyship and Lady Wang. We
saw him in Her Old Ladyship’s courtyard, dressed in his new uniform. He looked very
imposing. A little bit fatter than he used to be. You ought to be happy now that he’s a
mandarin, not making yourself miserable with all this worrying about him. Even if he
doesn’t behave himself, I should leave his parents to do the worrying. All you have to
do now is sit back and enjoy your-self. If ever you’re at a loose end, you can always
jump in your chair and have yourself carried round here for a game of cards and a
chat with Her Old Ladyship. I’m sure no one here would dream of making you feel
uncomfortable. After all, you’ve got upstairs and downstairs and halls and
reception-rooms back home just the same as we have. You’re as good as any lady in
the land now, you know. I’m sure you will be respected as such.’
Mrs Lai hurriedly rose to her feet as Patience came up to pour tea for her.
‘You shouldn’t do that, miss. You should let one of the younger ones do it. ’Tain’t
right you should pour for me.’
Sitting down again she continued to hold forth between sips.
‘You don’t know that boy, Mrs Lian. He’s like all young people: you have to be strict
with them all the time. Even then if you’re not careful they’ll somehow find a way to
raise the devil and grieve their parents’ hearts. This young chap of ours now: those
that know him realize it’s just the mischief coming out, but those who don’t are liable
to think that he’s taking advantage of the fact that he’s got more money and
influence than other people to throw his weight about; and that reflects badly on the
Master’s reputation as well. Oh, I get so angry about it sometimes, I don’t know what
to do with myself. I have to call his Dad in and give him a good talking-to and then I
feels a bit better. I hope you won’t mind my saying this’—she pointed a finger at
Bao-yu - ‘but I wouldn’t have thought that your father was strict enough with you.
Look at the way Her Old Ladyship was out in front the moment he started when he
gave you that beating a while ago. You should have seen the way your grandfather
used to lay into him when he was a lad. And your father wasn’t the scapegrace that
you are, either. Then there was your father’s elder brother, Master She. Now he was
mischievous—though even so, he didn’t turn the whole household upsy-downsy the
way you seem to. He was always getting beaten. Oh, and the way your Cousin
Zhen’s grandfather over at the Ning-guo used to lay into his son! Oh, he had a fiery
temper! Once it was up—well, you’d never have thought it was his son he was
beating. Looked more like he was torturing a bandit. From what I’ve seen and beard, I
should imagine that the way your Cousin Zhen at the Ning-guo disciplines his son is in
his grandfather’s tradition. Only trouble is, he’s a bit too erratic. Can’t control himself,
that’s his trouble. I don’t blame the young ones for not respecting him. If you’re
sensible, young man, you’ll be glad to hear me say this; otherwise, though you may
be too polite to say so, I expect you’ll think I’m an interfering old woman.’
Just then Lai Da’s wife came in, followed almost im?mediately by the wives of Zhou
Rui and Zhang Cai. The latter two had come to report to Xi-feng on various domestic
matters. Xi-feng smilingly inquired of Lai Da’s wife whether she had come to collect
her mother-in-law.
‘Well, no, madam, not exactly,’ said Lai Da’s wife. ‘I really came to find out whether
you and the young ladies will be favouring us with your presence or not.’
‘Oh, how silly of me!’ said old Mrs Lai when she heard this. ‘Here have I been
talking a load of stale old sesame and all the time forgetting the one thing I came
here to ask you about! On account of our young chap’s posting, all our friends and
relations want to get together and celebrate, so we thought we’d better have a
reception. Well, the way I saw it, if we only held it for one day, it would mean inviting
some people and leaving out others, and that wouldn’t seem right. So I thought
about it for a bit, and I thought to myself, well, it’s thanks to the Masters that this
great honour has come our way, so we must do what we can to show our
appreciation. Even if it means spending every penny we’ve got, we ought to be glad
to do it. So I told the boy’s father to arrange a reception for three days running. On
the first day we’ll have some tables and a stage in our little bit of garden at the back
to entertain Her Old Ladyship and Their Ladyships and your good selves and the
young ladies, and some more tables and a stage with another lot of players in the
reception room at the front where we can entertain the gentlemen. The second day
will be a reception for relations and friends of the family, and the third day will be for
colleagues on the staffs of the two mansions. I do hope you will honour us with a
visit. It will be the high?light of our celebrations.’
Li Wan and Xi-feng asked her when the reception would be, assuring her that they
fully intended to come.
‘I’m sure Lady Jia would love to come too,’ they said, ‘but I wouldn’t bank on her
being able to.’
‘The date we’ve chosen is the fourteenth,’ said Lai Da’s wife hurriedly, before her
mother-in-law had a chance to get under way again. ‘We do hope you’ll come, for
Mother’s sake.’
‘I can’t answer for the others,’ said Xi-feng amiably, ‘but I shall definitely be coming.
I’d better warn you, though: I haven’t got any present to bring, and you mustn’t
expect me to offer largesse—I wouldn’t know how to go about it. You mustn’t laugh
if I just eat up and go.’
‘Get along with you, madam!’ said Lai Da’s wife, laughing. ‘If you feel like bringing a
largesse, twenty or thirty thousand taels would do very nicely!’
Old Mrs Lai laughed.
‘I been to see Her Old Ladyship already and she says she’ll come. Reckon I ought to
feel pretty pleased with myself.’
After further exhortations to attend the party and various other admonishments, the
old woman was at last getting up to go when her eye chanced to fall on Zhou Rui’s
wife and she seemed to remember something.
‘There’s something else I wanted to ask you about, Mrs Lian. What’s all this about
Zhou’s boy being dismissed? What did he do wrong?’
‘Ah yes, I’ve been meaning to speak to your daughter-in-?law about it,’ said Xi-feng,
‘but there were so many other things to think about that they drove it from my mind.
Lai, dear,’—she turned to Lai Da’s wife—‘when you get back, will you tell your
husband that neither of our households will be employing Zhou Rui’s son any longer
and that he is to send him packing?’
Lai Da’s wife could only agree, but the unhappy mother fell on her knees in
supplication.
‘What did he do?’ old Mrs Lai repeated. ‘Tell me what he did, and I’ll be judge for
you.’
‘Yesterday on my birthday,’ said Xi-feng, ‘before the rest of us had even started
drinking, he was already drunk, and when my grandmother sent her women round
with some presents, instead of going out and being nice to them, he sat where he
was swearing at everybody and made no attempt to receive the presents or take
them inside. Eventually the two women came in by themselves and he did at last go
with a couple of the pages to take in what they had brought. But though the pages
made no trouble, this young Zhou dropped the box he was carrying and scattered
wheat-cakes all over the courtyard. After the women had gone, I sent Sunshine out to
give him a talking-to, but it ended up with him shouting and swearing at Sunshine.
Faced with a young hooligan like that who is so utterly and completely uncontrollable,
I don’t see that one has any choice but to dismiss him.’
‘Is that all it was?’ said Grannie Lai. ‘And I was thinking it must have been
something serious! Take my advice, Mrs Lian. If that boy’s done wrong, beat him and
curse him and tell him to mend his ways, but dismiss him?—no, that would never do.
He’s not like one of your house-born servants. The Zhous came with Her Ladyship
from her old home when she was married. If you insist on dismissing him, it will look
like an affront to Her Ladyship. Give him a few whacks to learn him and tell him not
to do it again; but keep him on, whatever you do. If you won’t do it for his ma’s sake,
do it for Her Lady?ship’s.’
Xi-feng turned to Lai Da’s wife.
‘Very well then. Let him be called for tomorrow and given forty strokes with the
heavy bamboo. And tell him he’s not to drink any more.’
Lai Da’s wife said she would see that done. After that Zhou Rui’s wife kotowed to
Xi-feng in gratitude. She wanted to kotow to Mrs Lai as well, but the old woman
reached forward and prevented her. The four women then left, and Li Wan and the
girls went back into the Garden.
Towards evening Xi-feng sent someone to the store-room, as promised, to hunt out
any old painting gear that had been stored there and take it round for Bao-chai and
the others to look over. On doing so the girls found only about half the things they
wanted, and made a list of the other half which they gave to Xi-feng to have bought.
But these are matters about which it is not necessary to go into detail.
Suffice it to say that the freshly-sized pongee arrived back from outside in due course
together with a rough draft of the projected painting, and that Bao-yu began to
spend a part of each. day at Xi-chun’s place helping her. Tan-chun, Li Wan, Ying-chun
and Bao-chai developed the habit of dropping into sit with them while they worked,
partly to watch the painting and partly because it made a convenient rendezvous.
Reminded by the first nip in the air that the hours of dark?ness were gradually
lengthening, Bao-chai went round for a long consultation with her mother from
which she came away with quantities of extra sewing to occupy herself with in the
evenings; but since, when making her morning and evening calls on Lady Wang and
Grandmother Jia, she would often, if they seemed desirous of her company, spend a
considerable while sitting and talking with them, and since she was also in the habit
of dropping in from time to time to gossip with one or another of her cousins in the
Garden, she had very little leisure for sewing in the daytime and as a consequence
was invariably plying her needle under the lamp until eleven or twelve o’clock at
night.

*

As for Dai-yu, twice every year, following the spring and autumn equinoxes, she
suffered from a recurrence of her old sickness. This autumn the repeated junketings
occasioned by Grandmother Jia’s enthusiastic excursions into the Garden had drained
her of energy. Recently she had begun coughing again; and as this year it seemed to
be considerably worse than usual, she had stopped going out altogether and stayed
at home nursing herself in her room. Sometimes when she was feeling depressed she
would long for a visit from one of the girls and the distraction of someone to talk to.
But when Bao-chai or one of the others did in fact look in to ask how she was, she
would grow fidgety after only a few sentences had been exchanged between them
and begin to wish that they would go. The others realized that it was being ill that
made her like this; and knowing from past experience how hyper?sensitive she was,
they were never sharp with her, even if she was somewhat remiss as a hostess and
often lacking in courtesy.
Once when Bao-chai called in to see her, the nature of her illness became the subject
of their conversation.
‘I suppose the doctors in attendance on this family aren’t too bad as doctors go,’
said Bao-chai, ‘but the medicines they prescribe for you don’t seem to make you any
better. Don’t you think it’s time they called in someone really first-rate who could
cure this sickness once and for all? Every year all through the spring and summer you
have this trouble; yet you’re not an old lady, and you’re not a little girl any longer. You
can’t go on in this way indefinitely.’
‘It’s no good,’ said Dai-yu. ‘This illness will never go away completely. Look what I’m
like ordinarily, even when I’m not ill.’
Bao-chai nodded.
‘Exactly I You know the old saying: “He that eats shall live”? What you ordinarily eat,
when you’re not ill, doesn’t seem to nourish you or build up your resistance. That’s
one of your troubles.’
Dai-yu sighed.

         ‘Life and death are as Heaven decrees; and rank
         and riches are as Heaven bestows them.

These things are not in human power to command. I seem to be worse this year than
I have been in previous years.’
She coughed several times while she was saying this.
‘I was looking the other day it that prescription of yours,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I should
have said myself that there was too much cinnamon and ginseng in it. I know they
are supposed to build you up; but you don’t want to go overheating yourself. If you
ask me, I think the first, most important thing to do is to calm your liver and
strengthen your stomach a bit. If you could reduce the inflamed, over-active state of
your liver so that it was no longer harming the earthy humour of your spleen, your
stomach would begin functioning normally again and then the food you ate could
begin to nourish you properly. First thing every morning you ought to take an ounce
of the best quality bird’s nest and five drams of sugar-candy and heat them up in a
silver skillet until they make a sort of syrup. If you were to take that regularly, it
would do you more good than medicine. There’s nothing like it for building you up if
you have low vitality.’
Dai-yu sighed again.
‘You’re such a kind person,’ she said, ‘but I’ve got such a suspicious nature that in
the past I always suspected that your kindness was a cloak for something and
rejected it. It wasn’t until the other day, when you told me off for reading for?bidden
books and offered me all that good advice, that I ever felt really grateful to you. I
realized then that I had all along been wrong about you— right from the very start. I
suddenly realized: I’m fifteen this year and have no brothers or sisters: ever since my
m6ther died there has been no one—literally no one - who has ever spoken to me in
that sort of way. I’m not surprised Cousin Yun speaks so highly of you. I used to hate
it when I heard her praise your kindness, but since experienc?ing it myself, I know
what she means. If it had been you who’d said those things in the drinking game, I
should have been quite merciless. I should never have kept quiet about it at the time
and gently remonstrated about it later, when we were alone together, as you did I
knew from that that I had been wrong about you, and that you must really care for
me. If my eyes hadn’t been opened for me then, I should never be talking to you like
this today.
‘Now about this bird’s nest syrup you want me to take. I know bird’s nest is fairly
easy to come by, but this illness of mine is something I suffer from every year
because of my weak constitution. There’s nothing particularly serious about it, it’s
just something that I always get. Yet already everyone’s put to a huge amount of
inconvenience because of it, fetching doctors, brewing medicines, buying ginseng for
me and Saigon cinnamon. If I now come up with some fancy new idea like asking to
have bird’s nest syrup made for me every day, then even though Grandmother and
Aunt Wang and Cousin Feng may not say anything, the old nannies and maids on the
staff are sure to resent the extra work. Cousin Bao and Cousin Feng are Grandma’s
favourites, yet you should see the looks these people give them sometimes and you
should hear the things they say about them behind their backs! So you can imagine
what they must be like about me. I’m not even a proper member of the family: I’m
just a refugee, with no family of my own, living here as a hanger-on. That in itself is
enough to make them resent me. It’s difficult enough for? me as it is, without
deliberately thinking up new ways to make them hate me.’
‘I’m just as much an outsider as you are,’ said Bao-chai.
‘There’s no comparison between us;’ said Dai-yu. ‘You’ve got your mother and your
brother for a start. You’ve got property and businesses. You’ve still got land and a
home of your own back in Nanking. It’s true that as marriage-relations they allow you
to live here free of charge, but you provide everything for yourselves apart from the
accommodation. You don’t cost them a penny. And anytime you feel like it, you can
just get up and go. I’ve got nothing at all of my own, absolutely nothing. Yet
everything they give me—food. cloth?ing, pocket-money, even the flowers and trees
in my garden -are the same as they give their own gifts. Can you wonder that the
servants are so resentful ?’
‘Your being here only means one more dowry for them to find,’ said Bao-chai.
‘Surely so small an extra expense as that is hardly going to bother them?’
Dai-yu coloured.
‘I’ve been telling you my troubles because I thought you really cared, but you turn
them into a joke.’
‘Perhaps,’ said Bao-chai, smiling. ‘But it’s true, all the same. However, don’t you
worry: as long as I’m here, I promise to do my best to make it easier for you. If you
will promise always to let me know when anything is bothering you, I will promise to
deal with it if it is in my power to do so. I have a brother, it’s true; but you know as
well as I do what he’s like. It’s really only in having a mother that I can count myself a
bit luckier than you. In other respects we have enough in com?mon to think of
ourselves as fellow-sufferers. If you can see this—as with your intelligence I am sure
you must—you have no cause to go echoing Si-ma Niu’s complaint: “All men have
brothers, only I have none.’ Now, you have suggested that “the less trouble the
better” ought to be your motto here, and I take your point. I shall have a word with
Mother next time I see her about this. I’ll be surprised if we haven’t got some bird’s
nest of our own at home. If we have, I shall tell them to send you a few ounces, so
that you can get your own maids to prepare it for you every morning. That way will
be handier for you and will also avoid the risk of any alarms and excursions with the
staff.’
Dai-yu smiled at her gratefully.
It may be only a little thing, but it is very kind indeed of you to have thought of it.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s not worth speaking of. I’m only afraid that by
spending so much time with other people I may have been neglecting you rather.
Well, I’d better be going now. I’m afraid I’m tiring you.’
‘Come again this evening and talk to me for a bit,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-chai promised to do so and departed.
And at this point she departs for a little while from our narrative.

*

Left alone, Dai-yu ate a few mouthfuls of congee and then lay down on her bed.
Towards sundown a change of weather came, bringing the whisper and rustle of rain.
It was the pulsing, steady rain of autumn, so constant that you sometimes wonder if
it has stopped. The afternoon slid imperceptibly into a somber evening, blackened by
lowering rain clouds and made yet more melancholy for Dai-yu by the persistent drip
of the rain on her bamboos. Reflecting that Bao-chai would now be unable to come,
she picked up a book at random to read beneath the lamp.
It was a volume of The Lyric Miscellany consisting largely of songs of sorrow and
separation: ‘The Autumn Bride’, ‘The Grief of Parting’ and suchlike. Moved by what
she read, she was inevitably drawn to give outlet to her feelings in com?position and
had soon completed a ‘song of separation ‘of her own. As she had modelled it on
Zhang Ruo-xu’s famous poem ‘Spring River: A Night of Flowers and Moonlight’, she
decided to call it ‘Autumn Window: A Night of Wind and Rain’. This is how it went:

Autumn Window: A Night of Wind and Rain

             The autumn flowers are dead, the leaves are sere;
             Lamp-light comes soon, the nights grow long again.
             Outside my window autumn’s signs appear
             More dismal in the wind and rustling rain.

             The rustling rain came in such swift downpour
             It startled me from autumn-dream-filled sleep.
             Now, in a muse, unable to sleep more,
             I watch the candle at my bedside weep.

           The candle weeps down to its socket low,
    And my heart weeps and desolation feels.
           Yet the same wind in other courts must blow;
             The sound of rain through other windows steals.

             The wind’s chill strikes through quilt and counterpane,
             The rain drums like a mad clock in my ears,
             All night, in whispering, monotone refrain,
             Companion to my own swift-coursing tears.

             The courtyard now with mist begins to fill,
             The bamboo’s drip persists without a pause.
             When will the wind cease and the rain be still,
             That with its weeping soaks my window’s gauze?

Having read it over to herself out loud, she laid down the writing-brush and was
about to go back to bed and settle down for the night when one of her maids
announced the arrival of Master Bao’. Almost simultaneously with this
an?nouncement, Bao-yu himself burst in wearing a rain-cape and an enormous
rain-hat of woven bamboo. Dai-ya laughed at the spectacle he presented.
‘The Old Fisherman! Where have you just sprung from?’
‘How are you today?’ Bao-yu asked her anxiously. ‘Have you had your medicine?
How much have you managed to eat today?’
He was divesting himself of the rain-clothes while he asked these questions. When he
had disposed of them, he picked up the lamp from the table and, shielding it with
one hand to throw the light on her scrutinized her face. He appeared to be satisfied
with what he saw.
You’ve got a better colour today.’
Now that he had taken off the rain-clothes, Dai-yu could see what he was wearing
underneath. He had on a somewhat worn-looking tunic of red silk damask tied with a
green sash at the waist, and trousers of sprigged green silk. The ends of his trousers
were stuffed into socks extravagantly patterned with a design of flowers picked out in
gold, and there were flowers and butterflies embroidered on his satin slippers.
‘The top part of you seems to have been pretty well pro?tected against the rain,’
said Dai-yu, ‘but what about the bottom part? Still, you appear to have kept your feet
dry.’
‘This is a complete outfit I’ve been wearing,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There is a pair of
pear-wood patterns that go with it as well, but I left them outside on your verandah.’
Dai-yu looked again at the cape and rain-hat. Both were exquisitely made—quite
unlike those that are sold in the market.
‘What sort of straw is this cape made of?’ she asked him. ‘It’s so fine. I can see now
why you didn’t look like a hedge?hog in it as people usually do in these things.’
‘The whole outfit was given to me by the Prince of Bei?jing;’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s
exactly like the one he wears himself at home when it rains. If you like it, I’ll get-you
one the same. There’s nothing so very special about it really. The hat’s rather fun.
The centre part is detachable. If you want to wear it in winter when it’s snowing, you
undo this little bamboo fastener and the whole top comes out, leaving you with just
the brim. So when it snows, it can be worn by a woman just as-well as by a man. I’ll
get you a hat like this to wear in winter when it snows.’
‘I don’t want one, thank you,’ said Dai-yu laughing. ‘If I were to wear one of those, I
should look like one of those old fisherwomen you see in plays and paintings.’
Immediately after saying this she realized that she had virtually been offering herself
as a fishwife to Bao-yu’s old fisherman and wished the -remark unsaid. She blushed
with embarrassment and leaned forwards, racked with coughing, over the table. But
Bao-yu appeared not to have noticed. What drew his attention was the poem be had
just spotted which lay on the table beside her. He picked it up and read it. A murmur
of praise which escaped involuntarily from his lips at once brought Dai-yu to her feet.
She snatched the paper from him and burned it over the lamp. But Bao-yu only
laughed.
‘Too late! I’ve already memorized it.’
‘I want to, go to bed now,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Please go now. Come again tomorrow.’
Hearing her speak of bed, Bao-yu felt inside his tunic and pulled out a gold watch
about the size of a walnut which he proceeded to inspect. The hand was pointing
exactly midway between the sign of the Dog and the sign of the Pig: nine o’clock at
night.
‘Yes,’ he said, stuffing the watch hurriedly back into his tunic. ‘Time for bed. I’ve
tired you long enough.’
He put on his cape and his rain hat and went out, but was back again almost
immediately.
‘Is there anything you fancy to eat? Let me know if there is, and I’ll tell
Grandmother first thing tomorrow. It will be safer to tell me than trying to explain
what you want to the old women.’
Dai-yu smiled.
‘I’ll-think about it during the night and let you know first thing tomorrow. Listen: it’s
raining harder. You’d better go quickly. Have you got anyone with you?’
‘Yes,’ one of the did women standing outside on the veran?dah called into her.
‘We’re waiting with our umbrellas up and we’ve got the lantern ready.’
‘Lantern?’ said Dai-yu. ‘In this weather?’
‘The rain makes no difference,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s a horn lantern. They’re not
affected by rain.’
Dai-yu reached out and took down a lamp with a balloon ?shaped glass shade from
the top of her bookcase. She ordered one of the maids to light a little candle in it and
offered it to Bao-yu.
‘Take this. It’s brighter than a horn one, and it’s specially made for going out in the
rain with.’
‘I’ve got one like that myself,’ said Bao-yu, ‘hut I didn’t bring it because I was afraid
they might trip over and break it.’
‘Which is worse,’ said Dai-yu, ‘a broken lamp or a broken leg? You’re not used to
wearing patterns, so it’s important to see where you’re going. The others can carry
the horn lantern in front of you, and you can carry this glass lamp, which is handier
and brighter and specially made for going out in the rain with, yourself. There. You
can send it back to me to?morrow. And if you should break it well, it won’t be the
end of the world. What has made you of all people so parsimonious about things all
of a sudden? You’re as bad as the Persian with his pearl!’
Thus persuaded, Bao-yu took the lamp from her and set off, two old nannies with
umbrellas and a horn lantern in front of him and two little maids with umbrellas
bringing up the rear. He made one of the little maids hold the glass lamp Dai-yu had
given him and leaned on her shoulder until they were back home.
The departure of Bao-yu and his party was immediately fol?lowed by the arrival of
two old women from Allspice Court, also carrying lanterns and umbrellas, with a
large packet of bird’s nest and another packet containing little frosty star?-shapes of
dazzling white imported sugar.
You’ll find these a hit better than the stuff you can buy in the shops,’ they told Dai-yu.
‘Our young lady says this is to be getting on with and when you’ve finished it she’ll
send you some more.’
‘That’s very kind,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Won’t you sit outside with the girls and let them
give you some tea?’
‘We won’t, miss, thank you all the same,’ they said. ‘We’ve got other things to do.’
‘Ah yes, you’re busy,’ said Dai-yu, smiling. ‘I should have remembered. Now that it’s
getting colder and the nights are longer, I expect you will have started your
card-school again. Nothing like a little gambling to pass the long night hours I’
The women laughed good-humouredly.
‘I won’t deceive you, miss,’ said one of them, evidently the chief organizer. ‘I’ve got
a really nice little school going this year. There are always a few of us on night-duty,
you see, and we don’t like to risk falling asleep and missing our watch, so we find our
little card-school the best answer. It keeps us awake and, as you say, miss, it helps to
pass the time. Tonight it’s my turn to be banker. The Garden gate has been closed
now, so it’s time we got started.’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘Well, all I can say is that it’s very nice of you to have taken time off when you could
have been winning money, to go out in the rain and bring me these things.’ She
turned to one of her maids: ‘Give them a few hundred cash so that they can buy
some wine to warm themselves up with after the rain.’
The women thanked her delightedly, and having kotowed, hurried outside to collect
the money, after which they put up their umbrellas again and departed.
Nightingale first put away the bird’s nest and sugar and then, having moved the lamp
over to the bedside and let-down the blinds, helped Dai-yu into bed.
As she lay there alone, Dai-yu’s thoughts turned to Bao?-chai, at first with gratitude,
because of her kindness, but after?wards a trifle enviously, because Bao-chai had a
mother and brother and she had none. Then she began thinking about Bao-yu and
herself: how they had been such good friends to start with, but how later on
suspicion and misunderstanding had grown up between them. Then she listened to
the insistent rustle of the rain on the bamboos and plantains outside her window.
The coldness penetrated the curtains of her bed. Almost without noticing it she had
begun to cry. It was nearly three in the morning before she was properly asleep.
We leave her now, to continue our story in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 46

An awkward person is given an awkward mission
And a faithful maid vows faithfulness unto death



IT was not, we observed in the last chapter, until nearly three o’clock in the morning
that Dai-yu finally dropped off to sleep. We leave her at this point in our narrative
and return to Xi-feng, who, it will be remembered, had been summoned on business
of an unspecified nature by Lady Xing.
When the others had left, Xi-feng hurriedly changed into her going out apparel, got
into her carriage, and drove round to the establishment next door.
The air of mystery surrounding this summons persisted after her arrival. Lady Xing
dismissed the others who had been present and addressed her daughter-in-law
conspiratorially.
‘The reason I have sent for you is that Sir She has entrusted me with a matter of
some delicacy which I hardly know how to go about and I thought I had better
discuss it first with you. He has taken a fancy to Lady Jia’s maid Faithful and wants her
for his concubine; and he has given me the job of asking Lady Jia for her. As I see it,
there is nothing very unusual in such a request, but I am rather afraid that Lady Jia
may refuse and wondered if you had any bright ideas on how one ought to go about
this business.’
Xi-feng put on what she hoped was a disarming smile.
‘I don’t think it’s worth trying. I think it would be merely asking for trouble.
Without Faithful, Grandma would be completely lost; she’d never consent to give her
up. In any case, she’s often remarked, in private conversation about Father, that she
can’t understand why at his age he continues to sur?round himself with young
girls—“wasting their young lives” she calls it. She says it’s not good for his health, and
that he ought to save up his energies for his job and not fritter them away on
“drinking all day with his fancy women”. You wouldn’t derive much pleasure from
hearing this sort of thing said to your face, Mother, and I am very sure that Father
wouldn’t. Yet if you insist on approaching Grandma about this, I’m afraid that that’s
what will happen. It will be like poking a straw up a tiger’s nostril. I hope you won’t
be offended, but I’m afraid I daren’t approach her about this. I should only be
demonstrating my own powerlessness to help and making a lot of unpleasantness for
myself into the bargain. Father is inclined to be a bit ga-ga at times nowadays. It’s up
to you to talk him out of it, Mother. This sort of thing is all very well in a younger man,
but in someone of Father’s years, with children and grandchildren of his own, it is
really too shaming I’
Lady Xing sniffed.
‘Lots of men in well-to-do families like ours have troops of concubines. Why should
it be so shameful only in our case? Anyway, I don’t know what makes you think he’d
listen to me, even if I did try to talk him out of it. And even if Lady Jia is so attached to
Faithful, she may not find it all that easy to refuse when the person asking is an
eldest son with a grey beard who has held a position in the Government.
Incident?ally, I only asked you over here for your opinion. I don’t see why you should
have to start reading me a lecture. There was never any question of asking you to
approach Lady Jia for me: I shall naturally undertake that task myself. And as for
com?plaining that I haven’t tried talking Father out of this obviously you have no
conception of what his temper can be like. I did try to dissuade him, but he started
hollering at me almost before the words were out of my mouth.’
Xi-feng knew that her mother-in-law was a weak and silly woman, always willing, for
the sake of a quiet life, to fall in with her husband’s wishes. Apart from pleasing her
husband, her principal aim in life was to see how much she could squeeze out of the
domestic economy and diver? into her personal savings. Decisions both great and
small she left to him; but all household monies passed through her hands, and she
saw to it that they suffered a considerable diminution in the process. The reason she
gave for this pillage was Jia She’s extravagance. ‘I have to economize,’ she would say,
‘to make up for what Sir She wastes.’ Among the children and servants of the
household there was not one whom she trusted or whose advice she would listen to.
From the tone of what she had just heard, Xi-feng knew that her mother-in-law’s
obstinate streak had been aroused and that it would now be quite useless to reason
with her. She therefore smiled even more disarmingly and promptly changed her
tack.
‘Of course. You are right, Mother. I haven’t had enough experience to be able to
judge these matters. But now I come to think of it, it’s only natural that a mother
should give what she treasures to her own son. Who else would Grandma give her
favourite maid—or any other precious thing—to if not to Father? One shouldn’t
believe everything that people say about other people behind their backs. No, I can
see that now. I have been too credulous. One has only to think how you and Father
are with Lian. Many a time when Lian has done some?thing he shouldn’t have done,
you and Father have spoken as if you could hardly wait to lay your hands on him, but
when he eventually turned up, you have forgiven everything and ended up by giving
him some treasured possession. I’ve no doubt that in this case it will turn out in
exactly the same sort of way with Grandma and Father. As a matter of fact, Grandma
is in rather a good mood today, so if you are going to ask her, it would probably be
best to do so straight away. Let me go over first to keep her sweet for you. I’ll find
some excuse for leaving and taking the others with me when you arrive. That will
give you a good opportunity for raising this matter. If she says yes, that will, of course,
be splendid. But even if she doesn’t, no great harm will have been done, be?cause no
one else will know about it.’
Hearing what she wanted to hear, Lady Xing’s good humour returned and she
proceeded to tell Xi-feng what she had already decided to do.
‘Actually my idea is not to mention this to Lady Jia at first. I think I shall begin by
having a quiet word with Faithful her?self. Though she may be bashful, as long as she
doesn’t say anything against it when I’ve explained it all to her, I shall
know that as far as she is concerned it is all right. If I talk to Lady Jia then, though she
may be unwilling to part with her, she won’t be able to get over the fact that Faithful
herself is willing to leave. “There’s no holding someone who has a mind to go,” as
they say. I think there should be no difficulty.’
‘Trust you for sound planning, Mother!’ said Xi-feng. ‘That way sounds fool-proof.
After all, every one of these girls is ambitious—they all want to improve their
position and get on in the world—and it’s unthinkable that she should throw away
this chance of becoming almost a mistress in order to remain a maid and end up
marrying one of the grooms.
‘Exactly!’ said Lady Xing. ‘That’s exactly what I thought. Any of these senior maids
would give her ears for a chance like this. Anyway, you go over now—only don’t
breathe a word of this to anyone else!—and I’ll follow later on, when I’ve had my
dinner.’
Xi-feng reflected.
‘Faithful’s no fool,’ she thought. ‘Whatever Mother says, it’s far from certain that
she’ll accept. Suppose I do go first and Mother follows later. If Faithful says yes, all
well and good; but if she doesn’t, Mother has such a suspicious nature that she’s sure
to think it’s because I’ve blabbed and been encouraging the girl to play hard to get. It
will be humiliating for her to discover that my prediction was right, and that will
make her angry; and then she’ll take it out on me—which won’t be very amusing. It
would be better if we went over together; then, whether Faithful accepts or not, no
suspicion can possibly fall on me.’
‘Just now as I was on the point of coming over,’ she said, bringing these reflections
to a rapid conclusion, ‘two crates of quails arrived from my aunt’s. I told the servants
to fry them, intending to send them over later for your dinner. Then, on my way in
through your gate, I met some of the boys from here with your carriage. They said it
had something wrong with it and they were taking it outside to be mended. Why not
make use of my carriage instead? We can go over together in it now, and you can
dine at my place afterwards on the quails.’
Finding this proposal acceptable, Lady Xing called in her maids to help her change;
then, supported by her ever-solicitous daughter-in-law, she got into the latter’s
carriage and drove with her to the establishment next door. On their way Xi-feng
pointed out that if they arrived at Grandmother Jia’s place together, the old lady
might notice her outdoor clothes and ask her where she had been.
‘It would be better if you went in there alone, while I slip back to my own place to
change,’ she said. ‘I’ll join you later, as soon as I’ve got into my everyday clothes.’
Lady Xing thought that this sounded reasonable and went in on her own to see
Grandmother Jia. After chatting with her for a few minutes about nothing in
particular, she left on the pretext of visiting Lady Wang. This meant that she went out
through the rear of the apartment, so that her way took her past Faithful’s room and
she was able to look in casually in passing to see if she was there.
Faithful was sitting in her room sewing, but stood up as Lady Xing entered.
‘What’s that you’re embroidering?’ Lady Xing asked her. ‘Let me look.’
She took the embroidery from her hand and inspected it.
‘You are getting very good,’ she said, laying it down again, and proceeded to
scrutinize the girl carefully, from head to foot.
Faithful had on an almost new lilac-coloured dress of silk damask over which she
wore a dag-edged sleeveless black satin jacket. Her skirt was a pale eau de Nil. Lady
Xing observed the slender waist and elegantly sloping shoulders, the oval face, the
lustrous, raven-black hair, the slightly aquiline nose, the cheeks slightly spotted with
a few tiny moles. Faithful grew embarrassed and apprehensive beneath this scrutiny.
‘What brings Your Ladyship here at this hour?’ she asked. ‘You don’t often come
over in the afternoon.’
Lady Xing made a sign to the maids who had accompanied her to leave the room,
then, seating herself in Faithful’s place, she took the maid by the hand and smiled at
her graciously.
‘I’ve come to wish you joy, my dear.’
Hearing this, Faithful was able to guess, more or less, what her visitor had come
about. She coloured and hung her head in silence while Lady Xing continued.
‘You see, Sir She has no one nowadays he feels he can really rely on. He was
thinking of buying someone; but you know, you can never trust those girls you get
from the dealers. You don’t know how clean they are, and often you don’t find out
what the snags are until it is too late. They seem all right when you buy them, but
two or three days later you find them get?ting up to the most frightful antics. Well,
then he thought he’d pick someone from among our house-born servants, but he lust
couldn’t seem to find anyone good enough. Either they weren’t good-looking enough,
or their looks were all right hut their characters wouldn’t do, or whatever it was
there was always something wrong with them. Anyway—to cut a long story
short—after half a year’s careful study, he has finally decided that you are the cream
of the cream. In looks, in character, in behaviour he finds you perfect: gentle,
reliable—in fact, all the things he is looking for in a girl. So he’s decided to ask Lady
Jia if he can have you for his concubine. Of course, you would get much better
treatment than a newly bought girl from outside could expect. In your case we
should put your hair back straight away and treat you as a proper chamber-wife. You
would be ‘Auntie’ to the children and ‘Mrs’ to the maids. In fact, you would have
practically the status of a mistress. Now I know you are an ambitious young woman.
You know what they say: “True gold will find its price.” In your case it’s proved by the
fact that Sir She has taken this fancy to you. Here is a chance of doing all those things
you ever set your heart on doing. And if you have any enemies, you will be in a
position now to make them look very silly. Now—come along with me and tell Her
Old Ladyship all about it.,
She took Faithful’s hand and made as if to go, but Faithful reddened and snatched her
hand away. Lady Xing assumed that she did so from bashfulness.
‘Come,’ she said, ‘there’s no need to be bashful. You don’t have to say anything
yourself if you don’t want to. just come with me and let me do the talking.’
But Faithful still hung her head and did not move.
‘Surely,’ said Lady Xing, when it became evident that Faithful was determined not
to accompany her, ‘surely you can’t mean to refuse this offer? I must say, you’ll be a
very silly girl if you do. What, throw away the chance of becoming a lady in order to
go on being a maid? if you do, then in two or three years time when they marry you
off, it will only be to one of the boys, you know. You’ll still be a slave just the same.
Whereas if you come to live with us—well, you know my nature: I’m not a difficult
person to get on with; and Sir She always treats his girls very nicely. And after you’ve
been with him for a year or two, if you can bear him a child, you’ll be on the same
level as me: everyone in the household will have to jump to it when you give them
orders. If you throw away an opportunity like this, you’ll certainly live to regret it.”
Faithful continued to hang her head and say nothing.
‘You’re such a lively person as a rule,’ said Lady Xing.
‘ What’s got hold of your tongue? is there any particular thing about this
arrangement that doesn’t suit you? Please let me know if there is, and I promise that
it shall be altered.’
But Faithful still said nothing.
‘Oh, I know what it is,’ said Lady Xing. ‘I expect you’ve got parents and don’t like to
say anything until you’ve heard from them. Why yes, very right and proper. I shall get
in touch with your parents and no doubt you will be hearing from them in due course.
Then anything you want to say, you will be able to say to them.’
With that she left, and went round to Xi-feng’s apartment. Xi-feng had long since
changed back into her ordinary clothes. As no one else was about, she had taken the
oppor?tunity of telling Patience about her interview with Lady Xing. Patience was
amused, but shook her head doubtfully at Lady Xing’s optimism.
‘If you ask me, I think it’s very uncertain. From the way she’s always spoken in the
past when we’ve been alone together, I should think she’ll-refuse. Anyway, we’ll just
have to wait and see.’
‘Lady Xing is sure to come here afterwards to talk about what happened,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘If Faithful has accepted, it will be all right; but if Faithful hasn’t accepted,
she’s not going to be in a very good mood, and it would embarrass her to have you
here while she was telling me about it. You’d better order them to prepare some of
those quails and a few other dishes to go with them so that I can offer her dinner
when she arrives; but after you’ve done that, you’d better take yourself off for a bit
and don’t come hack until you think she’s gone.’
Patience gave Xi-feng’s instructions to the cook and then went off to enjoy herself in
the Garden.
*

When Lady Xing left, Faithful felt sure that she would go straight to Xi-feng’s for
consultation and that soon after that someone else would arrive and put the same
question to her again. it seemed to her that the best way of avoiding this would be to
decamp. She sought out Amber in order to give some cover to her exit.
‘If Her Old Ladyship should ask for me, tell her that I’m not feeling well and couldn’t
eat any lunch today. Say I’ve gone to walk in the Garden for a bit and shall be back
again shortly.’
Amber agreed to do this and Faithful went off to wander about in the Garden. While
she -was doing so, she came by coincidence upon Patience doing exactly the same
thing.
Seeing no one else but the two of them around, Patience felt no compunction in
revealing her newly acquired knowledge.
‘Look who’s here! she called out teasingly. Mrs Faithful!’
Faithful blushed bright red.
‘I suppose you’re in the plot against me too. Well, never mind. I’ll be having it out
with your mistress presently.’
Patience could see that Faithful was really angry, and regret?ted her foolish jibe.
Taking her by the hand, she led her to some rocks beneath a stand of maple trees
where they could sit down together, and proceeded to tell her all that Xi-feng had a
few minutes earlier told her.
‘Thank you,’ said Faithful when she had finished. ‘You and I at least are still friends.
When I think of our set how many were we?—Aroma, Amber, Candida, Nightingale,
Suncloud, Silver, Musk, Ebony, Kingfisher—she left to go with Miss Shi—Charmer and
Golden—they both died—Snowpink that was dismissed—you and me—there must
have been a dozen of us altogether: when we were young we always told each other
everything and shared everything together; but now that we are older, the others all
seem to go their different ways and just aren’t interested. Not me, though: I haven’t
changed. I’m just the same as I always was. I don’t have any secrets from any of you.
Now listen: I’m telling you this now for you to remember—only don’t go passing it on
to your Mrs Lian. It’s not just a question of not wanting to be his concubine. I
wouldn’t go to Sir She, not if Lady Xing had died and he sent matchmakers and
witnesses and asked me to be his proper wife!’
Patience was about to answer when there was a laugh from behind the rocks on
which they were sitting and a voice called out.
‘What’s this shameless boasting I hear? It’s enough to set one’s teeth on edge!’
Startled, the two of them rose to their feet and went to look behind the rockery to
find out who it was. Aroma emerged, laughing, as they did so.
‘What’s all this about? Tell me about it too.
The three of them sat down on the rocks together and Patience retold all that she
had just told Faithful.
‘Well!’ said Aroma when Patience had finished. ‘I suppose it’s not for someone in
my place to say so, but what a nasty old man! Unless they’re downright misshapen,
just about no one is safe from him.’
‘I can tell you a way out of this if you want to refuse,’ said Patience.
‘What?’ said Faithful.
‘Have a word with Her Old Ladyship and get her to tell him that she’s already given
you to Mr Lian. That’ll cool his ardour.’
‘You too now?’ said Faithful angrily. ‘You’re a nice lot, I must say! It was your
mistress who suggested that the other day. I thought we hadn’t heard the last of
that.’
‘If you don’t want either of them,’ said Aroma, ‘then if you ask me I think your best
plan would be to get her to tell him that she’s promised you to Master Bao. That
would put him off right away!’
Both embarrassed and-exasperated by these taunts, Faithful rounded on her
tormentors with some heat.
‘You’re rotten, both of you, and I hope you both come to bad ends! I thought you
were decent sorts who might try to comfort me in my trouble. But even if you don’t
care, you might at least refrain from treating it as a joke. I suppose you think you
don’t have to worry about me because your own futures are assured and each of you
will end up as chamber wife to the person of your choice. Well, as I see it, things in
this world don’t always turn out the way you want them to. I wouldn’t be quite so
cock-a-hoop if I were you. You might be in for some nasty shocks yourselves.’
The others saw that they had really rattled her and laughingly did their best to calm
her down.
‘Now, now, Faithful, don’t take it so much to heart. We three have been like sisters
ever since we were little girls. We were only teasing you a bit because there’s no one
else around. Tell us what plan you’ve decided on, so that we shan’t be so worried
about you;’
‘Plan?’ said Faithful. ‘I’ve got no plan. I just shan’t go to him and that’ll be the end
of it.’
Patience shook her head.
‘I very much doubt if it will. You know what Sir She’s temper is like. It’s true that he
can’t touch you as long as you’re with Her Old Ladyship; but you’re not going to be
with her all your life, are you? You’ll have to leave in the end, and if you fall into his
clutches then, you’ll be in real trouble.’
Faithful smiled grimly.
‘As long as Her Old Ladyship lives, I shall stay with Her Old Ladyship. And when all’s
said and done, even when the old dear goes to her rest, there are still the years of
mourning. There would be no question of his taking a concubine with his mother just
dead. And by the time the period of mourning is over—well, anything might have
happened. I’ll just have to wait and see. If I get really desperate, I can -always shave
my hair off and become a nun; or failing that, there’s always suicide. I don’t mind
going through life without a man. Glad to keep myself clean?
The other two tittered protestingly.
‘The things you say, Faithful! Have you no shame?’
‘There’s not much room left for shame when things have come to this pass,’ said
Faithful. ‘Anyway, if you don’t believe me, just wait and see. Lady Xing said just now
that she was going to see my parents about this. I wonder if she will. She’ll have to go
all the way to Nanking if she does!’
‘Your parents are looking after the house in Nanking and can’t be fetched,’ said
Patience, ‘but they can be got in touch with eventually. And in any case, your elder
brother and his wife are here. It’s a pity you’re a house-born servant and not on your
own here like me and Aroma.’
‘It makes no odds,’ said Faithful. ‘ “You can take an ox to the water, but you can’t
make him drink.” Just because I refuse him, he’s not going to kill my parents!’
While she was talking, her sister-in-law appeared some distance from where they
were sitting, walking in their direction.
‘There you are!’ said Aroma. ‘They’ve evidently found that they can’t get in touch
with your parents, so they’ve already had a word with your sister-in-law.’
‘That cow!’ said Faithful. ‘She’s a regular camel-dealer, that one. She’d just jump at
a thing like this!’
The ‘cow’ was already upon them, smiling all over her face.
‘Ah, here you are, miss! I’ve looked for you everywhere. Come with me. I’ve got
something to tell you.’
Patience and Aroma fussed round her, inviting her to sit with them on the rock.
‘No, you young ladies sit down;’ said the woman. ‘I’ve got to have a word with our
Faithful.’
‘Is it really very urgent?’ they asked her innocently. ‘We’ve been playing “I spy”.
Can’t it wait until we’ve finished guessing?’
‘What is it?’ said Faithful. ‘Why not just tell me?’
‘Come with me,’ said her sister-in-law. ‘I’ll tell you over there. It’s good news,
anyway.’
‘Oh, is it by any chance the thing Lady Xing was talking about?’ said Faithful.
‘There!’ said her sister-in-law. ‘You knew about it all the time! What were you
having me on for? Now come on, hurry, and I’ll tell you all the details. It’s a
wonderful, wonderful piece of news!’
Faithful stood up and spat hard and deliberately in her sister-in-law’s face.
‘Why don’t you take your bloody trap out of here?’ she shouted, pointing at her
angrily. ‘ “Wonderful news” indeed! I suppose you’ve been studying the way families
of maids who’ve become concubines can throw their weight about, so you just can’t
wait to push me into that fire. If I find favour, then of course you’ll be the great lady
and be able -to put on airs and throw your weight about too. If I don’t, if I’m a
failure—oh, you’ll just draw your tortoise-head back into your tortoise-shell and
leave me to get on with it. Whether I live or die, it will be all the same to you.
She began crying hysterically and had to be restrained and comforted by Patience
and Aroma.
‘Huh!’ said her sister-in-law in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve her ruffled
dignity. ‘Whether you’re willing or not, you might at least be civil. Anyway, I don’t see
why you need drag other people into it. “One doesn’t discuss short legs in front of a
dwarf,” they say. I make no comment on the nasty things you said about me, but
what about these young ladies? They’ve done nothing to provoke you. This talk
about concu?bines is not very nice for them.’
‘Oh no!’ said the two young ladies in question. ‘She wasn’t referring to us when she
said -that. It’s you who are dragging in other people. What makes you think that
either of us has been chosen as a concubine? By whom? Even if we had been, neither
of us has any family in this household to throw their weight about, so she can say
what she likes on the subject:
there’s no occasion for us to get worked up about it.’
‘It’s because I made her look silly,’ said Faithful. ‘She’s trying to cover up by setting
you two against me. Fortunately you are too intelligent to be taken in. I lost my
temper just now and I’m afraid I didn’t choose my words very carefully. She evidently
thought she could take advantage of that.’
Faithful’s sister-in-law was by now finding her situation so disagreeable that she
removed herself from it by walking away in a huff. Faithful herself was still extremely
angry and for some time continued to hurl invectives at her retreating back; but
Patience and Aroma reasoned with her, and gradually she began to calm down.
‘Why were you hiding there just now?’ Patience asked Aroma when Faithful’s
composure had been restored. ‘It’s funny that we didn’t see you.’
‘I’d been over to Miss Xi-chun’s to see Master Bao,’ said Aroma, ‘but I got there a
moment too late. They said he had just that minute left for home. I couldn’t
understand why in that case I hadn’t run into him on the way, so I thought per?haps
he might have gone to Miss Lin’s; but just as I was going there to look for him, I met
one of Miss Lin’s people who said that he wasn’t with her, so I began wondering if he
might have gone out of the Garden altogether. Then just at that moment you came
along from the direction I was looking in, so I slipped behind a tree and hid. When
Faithful came, I slipped out from behind my tree and hid behind this rock. I could see
you both sitting there talking, but your two pairs of eyes couldn’t see me.
‘And your three pairs of eyes couldn’t see me!’ said a mock?ing voice behind them.
The three girls jumped in surprise. When they turned to look, it was Bao-yu himself
who walked out from behind the rock.
Aroma was the first to recover her voice.
You led me a nice dance!’ she said. ‘Where have you been all this time?’
‘As I came out of Xi-chun’s place, I could see you coming towards me,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I knew it must be me you had come for, so I hid myself to give you a surprise. I
watched you as you walked by with your head in the air. Then I watched you go into
Xi-chun’s courtyard. Then I saw you come out again. Then I saw you stop and ask
someone something. It was terribly funny. I was hoping that you would eventually
come by the place where I was hiding, so that I could pop out and make you jump.
But then you started dodging around, and I could see that you were hiding from
someone else and evidently planning to play the same trick on them. So I peeped out
to see who it was and found that it was these two. Then I began gradually working
my way round behind you, and when you stepped out and showed yourself, I slipped
forward and hid in the place where you had been biding.’
‘We’d better go behind and have another look,’ said Patience. ‘We’ll probably find
two more people hidden back there!’
‘No, I think there really are no more now,-’ said Bao-yu.
When she realized that Bao-yu must have heard everything that had been said,
Faithful lay face downwards on the rock and pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu laughed
at her and gave her a little prod.
‘It’s damp on that stone. Much better come indoors if you want to lie down.’
He tried to pull her up, at the same time inviting Patience to accompany them back
home for some tea. When Patience and Aroma added their own coaxing to his,
Faithful finally rose to her feet and the four of them went together to Green Delights.
Bao-yu had, indeed, heard everything from his hiding-place, and his concern for
Faithful made him very unhappy. When they were back, he lay back silent on his bed
worrying about it while the three girls laughed and chattered in the adjoining room.
*

When Lady Xing asked Xi-feng about Faithful’s parents, she learned that her father’s
name was Jin Cai and that he and her mother lived as caretakers at the Jia family
mansion in Nanking and seldom came up to the capital.
‘But she has an elder brother Jin Wen-xiang, who is one of Grandmother’s buyers,’
said Xi-feng, ‘and her sister-in-law is Grandmother’s chief laundress.’
The laundress was duly summoned and Lady Xing carefully explained what was
required of her. The woman was naturally delighted and went off in a great bustle of
self-importance to look for Faithful, confident that she had only to state her mission
for the matter to be successfully concluded. Ill pre?pared, therefore, for Faithful’s
acrimonious rebuff or the strictures of Patience and Aroma which followed it, she
re-turned to Lady Xing to make her report in a state of angry mortification.
‘It’s no good, I’m afraid. She just swore at me.’ Since Xi-feng was present, the
woman dared not mention Patience, ‘That Aroma was there, too, helping her. Some
of the things she said to me—well, I wouldn’t offend Your Ladyship’s ears by
repeating them. I think you and Sir She would be well advised to buy a girl elsewhere.
That little fool Faithful evi?dently wasn’t meant for such great fortune—nor we to
share it, seemingly.’
‘Whatever has this got to do with Aroma?’ said Lady Xing. ‘I wonder how she got to
know about it.’ She paused for a moment. ‘Was there anyone else there?’
‘Miss Patience was there,’ said the woman.
‘I wish you’d given her a box on the ears then and told her to come home,’ Xi-feng
put in hurriedly. ‘She went oft wandering somewhere or other as soon as I left the
house and there wasn’t a sign of her when I got back. If she was there, she’ll have put
in her pennyworth too, I suppose.’
‘Well, she wasn’t exactly there,’ said the woman, ‘she was quite a way off. I couldn’t
see her very clearly. Maybe it wasn’t her, I could have been mistaken.’
‘Go and find her at once,’ Xi-feng said to the servants. ‘Tell her I’m back and Lady
Xing is here and she is to come home immediately.’
Felicity hurried forward to report:
‘Miss Lin sent round three to four times to ask if Patience would go over to her
place, -so Patience went to see what she wanted. I went there to call her back when
you came in just now, but Miss Lin said would I please tell you that she wants
Patience a bit longer to do something for her.’
‘She’s always asking Patience to do things for her,’ said Xi-feng, with pretended
annoyance. ‘I wonder what it is this time.
Resourceless, now that her plan had misfired, Lady Xing returned home as soon as
she had eaten dinner and in the evening informed Jia She of what had happened.
After reflecting for some moments, Jia She ordered Jia Lian to be summoned
immediately.
‘Jin Cai and his wife aren’t the only couple looking after our Nanking property,’ he
began as soon as Jia Lian arrived. ‘Have him recalled immediately.’
‘Last time we had a letter from Nanking,’ said Jia Lian, ‘it said that Jin Cai was in a
delirium and they’d already issued the money to buy his coffin. He may well be dead
by now; and even if he isn’t, he’s probably unconscious and wouldn’t be much use to
us back here. And his old woman is as deaf as a post.
‘Villain! Parricide!’ Jia She shouted, in instant fury. ‘Trust you to know that! Get out
of my sight!’
Startled by his father’s unaccountable anger, Jia Lian retreated in a hurry. Shortly
after he had done so, Jin Wen-xiang was sent for.
Jia Lian, not daring either to go back home or to go in again to his father, stayed near
at hand in his outer study, waiting to see what happened. After a while Jin Wen-xiang
arrived, and Jia Lian watched him being conducted through the inner gate by the
pages. After a lapse of time in which he could comfort?ably (had he been so minded)
have eaten four or five meals, he saw Jin Wen-xiang come out again, but was still too
scared to make inquiries. He did not do so until be had allowed what he thought was
a safe interval to elapse after Jin Wen-xiang’s departure, and was then informed that
his father had gone to bed. Only then did he dare to go back home; and it was not
until Xi-feng informed him that night that he understood what it was all about.

*

That night Faithful was unable to sleep. Her brother came next morning to ask
Grandmother Jia if he could take his sister back home for the day. His request was
granted, and Grandmother Jia ordered Faithful to get ready. Faithful did not want to
go, but overcame her reluctance because she did not want the old lady to suspect
that anything was amiss.
When they were -home, her brother told her all that Jia She had said, promising that
if she accepted, her position would be an honoured one: she would become ‘Mrs Jin’,
and all the household would look up to her. But no matter what he said, Faithful set
her face firmly against it all and obstinately con?tinued to say ‘no’. In the end her
brother had no alternative but to go back to Jia She and tell him that his sister was
un?willing. Jia She was greatly incensed.
‘Now look here,’ he said, ‘you go back and get your wife to tell her this: Sir She says:
             The moon ever loved a young man.

He knows all about that saying. No doubt she thinks him too old for her and has set
her heart on one of the younger ones Bao-yu, probably, or my son Lian. Tell her, if she
has, the sooner she abandons hope in that direction the better, because if I can’t
have her, she may be very sure that no one else in this family will dare to. That’s one
thing. And here’s another. She may think that because she’s Lady Jia’s favourite, she
can look forward to marrying outside one day and becoming someone’s regular wife.
Well if so, just let her get this firmly into her mind: whoever or wherever she marries,
she needn’t think she will ever escape me. If she dies or is prepared to live all her life
an old maid, I might admit myself beaten; but otherwise, never. So unless she
proposes to choose one of those alternatives, she’d better hurry up and change her
mind. It will be a great deal easier for her if she does.’
Each sentence of the above had been punctuated by a nervous ‘Yessir’ from Jin
Wen-xiang. Jia She continued.
‘Now don’t think you can fool me over this in the hope of getting better terms.
Tomorrow I shall send Lady Xing over to have a word with Faithful herself. If Faithful
still refuses after your wife has spoken to her, then that is no fault of yours and I
shan’t hold it against you. But woe betide you if when Lady Xing talks to her she finds
that she is willing!’
After a good many more ‘Yessirs’ Jin Wen-xiang withdrew and went back home.
When he got back, he did not even wait to transmit Jia She’s message through his
wife, but went straight in and told it all to Faithful himself It made Faithful so angry
that for some time afterwards she was unable to speak. Finally, after some inward
calculation, she answered him as follows.
‘Even if I am willing, you’ll have to take me back first, so that I can have a word
about it with Her Old Ladyship.’
Supposing this to mean that she had changed her mind, her brother and his wife
were overjoyed, and the latter at once undertook to go with her to see Grandmother
Jia.
It so happened that when they arrived, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-yu
and the girls, and some of the senior stewardesses from outside were all - there with
the old lady sharing a joke. Faithful led her sister-in-law through their midst, knelt
down at her mistress’s feet, and with tears stream?ing down her face, proceeded to
tell her what Lady Xing had said to her the day before, what her sister-in-law had said
to her in the Garden, and what her elder brother had told her that morning.
‘When I refused, Sir She said it was because I fancied Master Bao, or else because I
was saving myself to marry someone outside. He said that even if I were to fly to the
world’s end, I should never as long as I live escape out of his clutches: sooner or later
he’d have his revenge. But I’ve made my mind up, and I’m telling Your Ladyship here,
in front of all these witnesses. I don’t care whether it’s Master Bao or Prince Bao or
the Emperor Bao, I don’t ever want to marry anyone. Even if Your Ladyship herself
were to try and force me to, I’d rather cut my own throat than marry. I’ll serve Your
Ladyship until you leave this world for the next one; and when that day comes, I
shan’t go back to my brother and his wife; I shall either take my own life or I shall cut
my hair off arid become a nun. And in case anyone should think I don’t really mean
this and am only saying it to get myself out of a corner, I call on heaven and earth and
all the gods and the sun and moon to be my witness: if I don’t honestly and sincerely
mean every word I say, may I be struck with a quinsy this very moment and matter
burst out of my mouth!’
She had hidden a pair of scissors up her sleeve before she came, and as she uttered
this oath, she undid her hair with her left hand and began hacking away at it with the
scissors in her tight. The servants rushed forward to stop her, but before they could
lay hands on her, she had already cut off a large hank. It was fortunate that her hair
was so thick and strong. Observing with relief that she had not succeeded in cutting
through all of it, the servants wound up what remained and refastened it on her
head.
By the time Faithful had finished speaking, Grandmother Jia was trembling all over
with rage.
‘I have only this one girl left that I can rely on,’ she said, speaking half to herself,
‘and now they are plotting to take her away from me.’
As she looked at those standing around her, her eye fastened upon Lady Wang.
‘You deceive me, all of you. You who are outwardly so dutiful: you are secretly
plotting against me like all the rest. Whenever I have any good thing you come and
ask me for it. All my best people you take away from me. Now I have only this one
poor girl left to me; and because you see that I am nice to her, it infuriates you—you
can’t bear it! And now you’ve found this means of getting her away from me, so that
you can have me at your mercy.’
Lady Wang had risen to her feet as soon as Grandmother Jia addressed her, but dared
not defend herself; Aunt Xue could not very well intervene when the object of these
stric?tures was her elder sister; and Li Wan had hustled her young charges from the
room at the first hint of impropriety when Faithful began her complaint.
Tan-chun, always one of the more thoughtful members of the family, realized that
however unjust the accusation, Lady Wang was in no position to answer back. She
realized that Aunt Xue could not speak up for her own sister or Bao-chai say anything
when her mother was silent and that Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-yu were even more
disqualified from coming to the rescue. This was exactly the sort of situation in which
a young unmarried granddaughter could be useful. And since Ying-chun was too
docile and Xi-chun too childish, Tan-chun herself, after listening for a while at the
window, boldly stepped into the room and faced her grandmother with an intrepid
smile.
‘How can this matter have anything to do with Mother, Grandma? Can you think of
any reason why a younger brother’s wife should be consulted about her
brother-in-law’s private business?’
Grandmother Jia was at once all smiles.
‘Of course not, my dear. I am a silly old woman! Mrs Xue, you must try not to laugh
at me. Your sister is a most dutiful daughter-in-law: not like She’s wife, who is so
scared of her husband that she has no time for me - beyond what she does for form’s
sake. I have done your sister a very grave injustice.’
Aunt Xue murmured something in reply, afterwards adding as a politeness:
‘The younger son’s wife is often the more favoured one. Perhaps you are biased,
Lady Jia.’
‘No,’ said Grandmother Jia firmly, ‘I am not biased. Bao-yu,’ she said, turning to her
grandson, ‘why didn’t you speak up when I falsely accused your mother? How could
you stand by like that and watch her being treated unjustly?’
‘How could I take Mother’s side against Uncle and Aunt?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Obviously
someone was to blame; but if it wasn’t Mother, who was I to say that it was? I could
hardly have said that it was me. Somehow I don’t think you would have believed
me!’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘Yes, I suppose you are right. Go and kneel down to your mother, then, Bao-yu. Tell
her that I’m getting old and that she is not to be upset by what I said to her. Ask her
to forgive me for your sake.’
Bao-yu quickly went over and knelt before Lady Wang. But before he could relay his
grandmother’s message, his mother had laughingly prevented him.
‘Get up at once and don’t be ridiculous, Bao-yu I How can you possibly apologize
for Grandma to me ?’
Bao-yu hurriedly got up to his feet.
‘What about you, Feng?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Why didn’t you try to stop me?’
‘I’ve been trying to restrain myself from blaming you for what’s happened,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘I don’t know why you should pick on me.’
Grandmother Jia’s laughter was echoed by the others present.
‘Oh? Now this is interesting. I should like to know why you think I’m to blame for
what has happened.’
‘You shouldn’t be so good at training your girls,’ said Xi-feng. ‘When you’ve brought
up a beautiful young bulrush like Faithful, can you blame other people for wanting
her? It’s a good job I’m only your granddaughter-in-law. If I’d been your grandson, I
should have asked you for her for myself a long time ago. I shouldn’t have waited till
now, I can tell you!’
‘Oh,’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing.’ So it’s all my fault, is it?’
‘Of course it’s your fault,’ said Xi-feng.
‘In that case I won’t try to keep her,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You can take her back
with you.’
‘Not just now;’ said Xi-feng. ‘In my next life, perhaps. If a good girl in this life, I
might be reborn as a man, and I can ask you for her then!’
‘Go on, take her with you!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You can give her to your Lian.
See if that shameless father-in-law of yours still wants her then!’
‘Lian doesn’t deserve her,’ said Xi-feng. ‘All he’s fit for is a couple of sad old
dumplings like me and Patience!’
This set everyone laughing.
A maid came in to announce someone.
‘Lady Xing, ma’am.’
Lady Wang hurried out to meet her.
What followed will be revealed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 47

In pursuit of love the Oaf King takes a fearful beating
And from fear of reprisal the Reluctant Playboy makes a
hasty getaway



HEARING that Lady Xing had arrived, Lady Wang at once hurried out to meet her.
Lady Xing had come over to see if there had been any change in Faithful’s attitude.
She was ignorant of the fact that the secret was now out and that Grandmother Jia
knew everything. The first she heard of it was when quietly informed by some of
Grandmother Jia’s women as she entered the old lady’s courtyard. She would have
liked to turn back, but by then it was already too late: she had already been seen and
announced by the servants inside, and when her sister-in-law Lady Wang came out to
meet her, she was obliged to go in with her and pay her respects to Grandmother Jia.
Finding that her greetings were received by the old lady in stony silence, she was
covered with shame and confusion.
By this time Xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and Faithful had
gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone. Fearing that their presence
might add to Lady Xing’s embarrassment, Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the rest also, one
after another, withdrew. When she saw that she and Lady Xing were alone together,
Grandmother Jia at last broke her silence.
‘I hear you have been playing the matchmaker for your husband,’ she said. ‘I must
congratulate you on your wifely virtue though I must say, I think that in this case you
are carrying wifeliness a little far. You have children and grand-children of your own
now: why should you be frightened of his temper still at your age? Yet they tell me
that you positively encourage his excesses.
Lady Xing blushed crimson with embarrassment.
‘I have tried several times to dissuade him, without suc?cess. I am sure you must
realize that I have acted against my will in this matter.’
‘You did what you were told, all the same,’ said Grandmother Jia sharply. ‘Would
you do what you were told if he asked you to kill someone? Just reflect for a moment.
There is only your sister-in-law, poor, simple soul—she is always ailing from
something or other—to worry about the responsi?bilities of this household. It’s true
that she has Lian’s wife to help her, hut she has so much to do that she hardly knows
which way to turn—always “putting the rake down to pick up the broom”. And I have
to cut down on all my activities nowadays. So if there is ever anything that your
sister-in-law and Feng have overlooked, Faithful is the only one left to make sure that
my needs are attended to. She is a child who notices things. If she sees that I lack
something, she will either ask for it herself or have a word with one of the other two
and make sure that I get it. Think of all the hundreds and thousands of things there
are to be done in this household. If I hadn’t got Faithful, how could the other two
avoid overlooking some?thing once in a while? So what would you have me do then?
Would you expect me to start worrying about all these things myself? Should I have
to start calculating what I needed every day and go running off to the other two to
ask them for it? Of all the girls I’ve ever had, Faithful is the only one left me now who
is a bit older and more responsible than the rest—who understands my little ways
and knows how I like things done. There’s a genuine bond between us—for example,
she would never take advantage of our relationship, as some girls would, to ask other
people for clothes or money for herself. One consequence 6f this is that not only
Feng and your sister-in-law, but everyone else in the household, from the highest
down to the lowest, is able to trust her. It means that quite apart from the fact that I
have someone I can rely on, Feng and -your sister-in-law are saved a great deal of
worry; because with a girl like that to look after me, I don’t suffer when they
occasionally forget something, and that keeps me in a good temper. If Faithful were
to leave me now, who would you get for me to put in her place? And even if you
could find such a jewel, she’d need to have a tongue in her head too. She’d be no use
to me if she didn’t have my Faithful’s gift for expressing herself. As a matter of fact
I’ve been think?ing of sending someone round to your husband to tell him that if he
would care to buy himself a girl, he’d be very welcome to do it with my money. I
don’t mind if it costs me eight thousand—ten thousand even—but if it’s this girl of
mine he wants, I’m afraid he can’t have her. Tell him that if he wants to be a dutiful
son, he’ll be doing more for me by leaving me my Faithful, to serve me during the
few years that yet remain, than if he were to come over and wait on me in person,
morn?ing, noon and night. It’s turned out very conveniently, your coming over just
now: you’ll be able to take this message back to him yourself and I can be sure of its
being properly delivered.’
She called for the servants.
‘What’s happened to everybody? We were just in the middle of a nice chat when
suddenly everyone went away.’
The maids, with answering cries, went off to look for the others. Soon all had been
reassembled except Aunt Xue, who showed some resistance to the summons.
‘I’ve only just got back,’ she said. ‘What’s the point of going out again?’
‘Have a heart, Mrs Xue I’ said the maid. ‘Her Old Ladyship is in a passion. If you
don’t come, no one else will ever shift her out of it. If it’s the walking that bothers
you, I’ll carry you there on my back I’
‘Get along with you, little monkey I’ said Aunt Xue, laugh?ing. ‘A few hard words
won’t hurt you.’
She went with the maid nevertheless. On her arrival she was cordially welcomed by
Grandmother Jia.
‘What shall we do?’ said the old lady. ‘Shall we play cards? Come and sit by me,
Mrs Xue. You haven’t had much practice. If the two of us sit together, there will be
less chance of Feng confusing us.’
‘Yes,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You will have to keep an eye on my hand and help me out a bit.
Is it to be just the four of us, or shall we have one or two more?’
‘Just us four, surely?’ said Lady Wang.
‘No, let’s have one mote,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It will make it more interesting.’
‘Go and call Faithful, someone,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘She can sit below me. Mrs
Xue’s eyesight isn’t too good. Faithful will be able to keep an eye on both our hands.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘I know you can read and write,’ she said to Tan-chun. ‘I suppose you haven’t
learned how to tell fortunes too, by any chance ?’
‘What a strange question!’ said Tan-chun. ‘You should be concentrating all your
energies on winning some of Grandma’s money, not thinking about having your
fortune told.’
-’I thought you -might be able to tell me how much I’m going to lose today,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘No question of winning anything. Look how Grandma’s got me ambushed on
every side before we’ve even started playing!’
Presently Faithful arrived and sat in the place below Grandmother Jia. Xi-feng sat
below Faithful. A red blanket was spread over the table, the cards were shuffled, the
players cut for deal, and the game began.
After they had been playing for some minutes, Faithful noticed that Grandmother Jia
had a nearly full hand and only needed a Two of Coins to go out. She made a sign to
Xi-feng, whose turn it was to discard. Xi-feng pretended to be in great doubt as to
what she ought to play.
‘I’m sure Aunt Xue is hanging on to the card I want. I’d better let her have this one,
and then perhaps she’ll part with it.
‘I’m sure I haven’t got anything you want,’ said Aunt Xue,
‘I’d need to look at your hand before I believed that,’ said Xi-feng.
‘You’re very welcome to,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘Come on, now! Put that card down and
let’s see what it is.’
Xi-feng laid the card down in front of Aunt Xue: Two of Coins.
‘It’s no good to me,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but I’ve an idea your grandmother may be
going out now.’
‘Oh, no I’ cried Xi-feng in mock dismay. ‘It’s a mistake. I didn’t mean to discard that
one.’
But Grandmother Jia, with a crow of triumph, had already thrown down her cards.
‘You dare take that back! You shouldn’t make mistakes!’
‘I told you I needed a fortune-teller,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Well, I played the card, so I
suppose I’ve no one but myself to blame.’
‘I should think so too!’ said Grandmother Jia. Give yourself a good hard slap on the
face if you want to know where the fault lies!’ She turned to Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t
think
I’m grasping, Mrs Xue. I don’t play for -the money; but I do so enjoy winning!’
‘Of course,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘No one would be so idiotic as to suppose that you
played for the money. Hearing this, Xi-feng, who had meanwhile been counting out
the money she had lost, abruptly stopped, and threaded the coins back onto the
string.
‘Right!’ she said, speaking to the others present. ‘That settles it! She doesn’t play
for the money, she just enjoys winning. Well I am mean and grasping, I’m afraid, and
when I lose, I like to know how much. But if that’s the way she feels, back it all goes
again!’
When Grandmother Jia played cards it was her unvarying custom to let Faithful
shuffle for her. She had been talking to Aunt Xue throughout Xi-feng’s bit of by play,
but broke off when he became aware that Faithful had made no move. ‘Come child,’
she said. ‘You’re not too upset to shuffle for me, are you?’
Faithful took up the cards with a laugh. ‘No, only Mrs Lian hasn’t paid up yet.’
‘Oh, hasn’t she? ‘said Grandmother Jia. ‘She’ll be lucky if she gets away with that!’
She called one of the junior maids to her. ‘Take that string of cash from in front of
Mrs Lian and bring it here.’
The little maid did as she was bid -and laid the money on the table beside
Grandmother Jia.
‘Please let me have it back,’ Xi-feng pleaded, ‘—so that I can give you the right
amount.’ ‘Feng really is rather mean,’ said Aunt Xue jokingly. ‘It’s only a game, after
all.’
Xi-feng stood up and, laying a hand on Aunt Xue’s arm, pointed out to her the
wooden chest in which Grandmother Jia kept her money.
‘You see that, Aunt? I don’t know how much of my money has at one time or
another found its way in there. Before I’ve been playing half an hour, my money in
the chest begins calling to my money on the table to come and join it. All I have to do
now is wait until it’s called it all in, then the game will be over and Grannie will be in
a good temper again and I shall be able to go and get on with my work.’
By the time she had finished -saying this, Grandmother Jia and all the others present
were laughing. They were still laughing when Patience, fearing that her mistress
might have insufficient money by her, came in bringing another string of cash.
‘Don’t put it down in front of me,’ Xi-feng told her. ‘Put it down beside Her Old
Ladyship, so that all my money can go into the chest together. We don’t want the
money in the chest to have to go through the -business of calling for it all over again.’
This made Grandmother Jia laugh so much that she scat?tered the cards she was
holding all over the table.
‘Tear her mouth!’ she said to Faithful, giving her a playful push.
Patience laid the money down as she was bidden, and after laughing a while with the
others, went out again. On her way out of the courtyard she ran into Jia Lian, who
was just about to enter the gate.
‘Where’s Lady Xing?’ he asked her. ‘Sir She has sent me to look for her.’
‘She’s been standing in there with Her Old Ladyship for the last half hour,’ said
Patience. She hasn’t dared to move yet, but I dare say she’ll get away as soon as she
can. Her Old Ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning, but thanks to the
Mistress, who’s been all this time humouring her, she’s gradually beginning to calm
down a bit.’
 ‘Oh well, when I go in I shall say that I’ve come to find out if Her Old Ladyship is
going to Lai Da’s place on the four?teenth, so that I know whether or not to have the
carriages ready,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I can mention that Lady Xing is wanted as an
afterthought. And after that perhaps I shall stay on and chaff the old lady a bit for a
few minutes. That should he all right, shouldn’t it?’
‘If you’re asking my opinion, I think you’d do much better not to go in at all,’ said
Patience. ‘Everyone’s been in trouble with her today even Her Ladyship and Bao-yu. If
you go in now, you’ll walk straight into it.’
‘Oh, surely it’s all over now, isn’t it?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Surely she’s not going to start all
over again? It’s nothing to do with me, in any case. And Sir She did ask me to go and
fetch Mother myself. If he finds that I’ve sent someone else to do it, he’s in such a
bad temper already, that he’ll probably use that as an excuse to take it out on me.’
He began to go in, and Patience, to whom this sounded reasonable enough, turned
back and followed him in across the courtyard. Entering Grandmother Jia’s outer
door, Jia Lian crossed the reception room on tiptoe and peered into the inner room
at the back. He could see his mother standing there.
Xi-feng, who had sharper eyes than the rest, spotted him at once and made a sign to
him not to enter and another sign to Lady Xing indicating that she was wanted
outside. Lady Xing could not simply walk out, so she filled a cup with some tea and
set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. This caused the old lady to turn round; and
as Jia Lian chanced at that very moment to be looking in at the doorway and was
unable to withdraw his head in time, she caught a momentary
glimpse of him before he disappeared.
‘Who’s that outside?’ she said. ‘It looked like one of the boys peeping in there just
now.’
‘Yes’ said Xi-feng, quickly rising to her feet and going over to the doorway, ‘I
thought I saw someone’s shadow there just now.’
Jia Lian walked smiling into the room.
‘I’ve come to ask if you are going on the fourteenth, Grandma, so, that I shall know
whether to get the carriages ready or not.
‘In that case why didn’t you come in straight away,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘instead
of lurking around outside?’
‘I could see that you were playing cards,’ said Jia Lian with a somewhat artificial
smile. ‘I didn’t like to interrupt you. I was hoping to get my wife to come out so that I
could ask her.’
‘And what is there so extraordinarily urgent about this that you needed to ask her
now?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘If you’d waited until she got home, you could have
asked her all you wanted to then. Why this extraordinary conscientiousness all of a
sudden? Eavesdropping is what you were up to more likely, or spying for somebody
else. Whatever it was, you gave me a nasty turn, creeping around in that sneaky,
under?hand way. Disgusting creature! Your wife will be with me a long time yet
playing cards. Better get back to that Zhao Er woman while you have the chance and
carry on where you left off with your plans- for poisoning her!’
The others all laughed.
‘It was Bao Er’s wife, my old love, not Zhao Er’s,’ said Faithful, laughing.
‘That’s what I said, didn’t I?’ Grandmother Jia snapped. ‘Well, “Zhao” or “Bao” or
brown cow how can !be expected to remember such things? The very mention of
them makes me feel angry. There were three generations of the family above me
when I came to this household as a young bride, and now there are three
generations below me, and I’ve seen many shocking and many wicked and many
peculiar things during the fifty-four years since first I came here, but this sort of thing
is simply outside my experience. Now be off with you!’
Jia Lian bolted, not daring to say a word. Patience, who had been standing
meanwhile outside the window, quietly mocked him as he came out:
‘I told you so, but you wouldn’t listen. You walked straight into the net, didn’t you?’
Just at that moment Lady Xing came out.
‘This is all Father’s doing,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Now we have to face the consequences.’
‘Unfilial wretch!’ said Lady Xing. ‘Some people would die for their fathers, but
you—a few harmless words and you are already whining and complaining. What’s
the matter with you? You haven’t been hurt yet—though I should look out, if I were
you: Father’s been pretty angry these last few days.’
‘Come on, you must hurry back, Mother,’ said Jia Lian. ‘He sent me to fetch you a
long time ago.’
He saw his mother out of the main part of the mansion and round to Jia She’s
quarters next door. Lady Xing then gave her husband, in briefest possible outline, a
report of what had happened; and since it was now evident that nothing more could
be done about Faithful, Jia She had to put up with his mortification as best he could.
He did, however, from that day onwards, discontinue all duty calls on his mother on
the pretext of being ill. Lady Xing and Jia Lian were sent to make the mandatory calls
on her in his stead.
Meanwhile his agents scoured the market for likely girls. A suitable one was
eventually purchased for the sum of five hundred taels a seventeen-year-old girl
called Carmine, who was duly installed in his room. But that is another part of our
story.
The card-game continued until dinner-time, and it was not until after dinner that the
company finally broke up.
Of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record.

*

The fourteenth came. Before it was yet daylight, Lai Da’s wife came round once more
to renew her invitation. Grand?mother Jia responded enthusiastically and, taking
Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the young people along with her, spent a considerable part
of the day in the Lai family’s private garden.
Lai Da’s garden was not, of course, to be compared with Prospect Garden;
nevertheless it was spacious and well-made and among its pools, rocks, trees and
pavilions were to be found several features of striking interest or beauty.
The menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or ‘outer’ part of
the establishment included Xue Pan, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong and a number of
the more closely related members of the Jia clan outside the immediate family. Jia
She was conspicuously absent. Young Lai had also invited some of his office holding
colleagues and a few young men of good family as congenial company for the Jias.
One of these last was a young gentleman called Liu Xiang?lian whom Xue Pan had
met on some previous occasion and hankeringly remembered ever since. The
discovery that he was a keen amateur actor one, moreover, who specialized in
romantic roles had led Xue Pan to jump to the wrong conclusion and assume that he
must share the same ‘wind and moonlight’ proclivities as himself. Eager to make his
closer acquaintance but hitherto denied any opportunity of doing so, he was
overjoyed at finding him among the company on this occasion and consequently in a
state of excitement which rendered his behaviour extremely unpredictable.
Cousin Zhen had also heard of Liu Xiang-lian and admired him. Today, under pretext
of being a little drunk, he had taken the liberty of asking him to perform for them,
and Liu Xiang-lian, supported by the hired professional players, had obliged by
appearing on the stage in two operatic num?bers. When he rejoined the company,
Xue Pan took the oppor?tunity of moving over to his table and began plying him with
all sorts of questions and insinuations.
Liu Xiang-lian was a young man of excellent family who, having lost both his parents
in early youth, had failed to complete his education. He was of a dashing, impulsive
nature, impatient of niceties. His chief pleasures were exercising with spear or sabre,
drinking, and gambling; but he was not averse to gentler pastimes: he frequented the
budding groves and could play on both the flute and the zither. Because he was so
young and handsome, many who did not know him mistakenly supposed that, being
an actor, he must have the usual actor’s propensities. Lai Da’s son Lai Shang-rong had
been a good friend of his for years and it was only natural that he should invite him
on this occasion to help him enter?tain his guests. Under these circumstances Lin
Xiang-lian was prepared to put up with a certain amount of drunken horse-play; but
Xue Pan was too much for him, and soon his atten?tions were becoming so
distasteful that Xiang-lian resolved to leave at the earliest opportunity in -order to
escape from them. Before he could break away, however, Lai Shang-rong detained
him.
‘Bao-yu gave me a message for you just now. He said that though he saw you
briefly when he arrived, with so many other people around, be didn’t have a chance
of talking to you properly. He’s most anxious that you should stay on so that he can
talk to you afterwards. If you are really set on going, wait while I call him out and you
can have a word with him now. What you do after that is your own affair: I certainly
shan’t try to detain you.’ He called a waiter to him: ‘Look inside and get hold of one
of the old women. Tell her to have a quiet word with Master Bao to say that he’s
wanted here outside.’
After about the time it would take to drink a cup of tea in, Bao-yu appeared.
‘Here you are, Uncle Bao!’ said Lai Shang-rong when he had joined them. ‘I leave
Xiang-lian in your bands, I’ve got to go and look after my guests now.’
With that he left them.
Taking Xiang-lian by the hand, Bao-yu led him into a study at the side of the hall
where they sat down together.
‘Have you visited Qin Zhong’s grave recently?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Certainly I have,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘The other day I was out hawking with a few of
the others and happened to notice that we were only half a mile or so away from it.
It occurred to me that it might not have stood up to all that heavy rain we had in the
summer, so I left the others and went off to have a look. As a matter of fact it had
been washed away a bit; so the day after I got back I scraped a few hundred cash
together, went back first thing next morning, hired a couple of labourers, and got it
patched up again.’
‘That explains it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Last month, when the pods were beginning to form
on the lotuses in Prospect Garden, I picked ten of them and sent Tealeaf to offer
them at his grave. When he got back, I asked him if the rains had damaged it at all,
and he told me that not only had it not been damaged, but that it was in even better
condition than it had been the time before. I knew from that that some friend must
have been there recently and restored it. I wish I weren’t so cooped up all the time at
home. I can never do anything I want to by myself. The slightest move I make is sure
to be seen and reported, and either I’m physically prevented from going where I
want to or else lectured at until I promise not to go. It’s useless for me ever to say
that I’m going to do anything, because I know that I shan’t be allowed to. I can’t even
spend my own money in the way I want.’
‘This thing at least is something you don’t need to worry about,’ said Xiang-lian,
‘with me outside to look after it for you. Anyway, it’s the thought that counts. It’s
enough to know that you would do it yourself if you could. I’ve already put aside the
money for his anniversary on the first of next month. You know how broke I always
-am. I never have any savings because as soon as I’ve got any money I spend it all.
Well, this time I thought I’d better not take any chances, so I put some by well in
advance, so-as not to have to stretch my hands out helplessly when the time conies.’
‘I was going to send Tealeaf round to see you about that,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but you
never seem to be at home; and you’re such a rolling stone that no one ever knows
where to look for you.’
‘Don’t bother to try,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘This is a matter in which each of us does what
he can. Anyway, I shall be going away quite soon. It will probably be three or four
years before I come back again.’
‘Why?’ said Bao-yu in some agitation.
‘That’s something you’ll know -soon enough when the time comes. I must be going
now.’
‘Must you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I so seldom get a chance of seeing you. Can’t we leave
together in the evening?’
‘I’m afraid it’s that cousin of yours,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘The usual problem. If I stay any
longer, there’s sure to be some kind of trouble. I’d much better go now and avoid it.’
Bao-yu reflected for some moments.
‘Yes, I suppose in that case you’d better. Only, if you really and truly are going away
for a long time, do please let me know before you start. Please don’t just slip away
without telling me.’
His eyes brimmed over with tears.
‘Of course I’ll come and say good-bye to you,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘As long as you
promise not to tell anyone.’ He stood up to go. ‘You go in again now. Don’t try to see
me out.’
He left the study and made his way to the main gate: but there, unfortunately, was
the very person he was trying to avoid.
‘Who’s let my little Liu get away?’ Xue Pan bawled.
Xiang-lian’s eyes flashed angrily. In other circumstances he would have laid him out
there and then with a single blow of his fist; but reflecting that to do so now would
be inter?preted by the others as drunken brawling and would moreover be
embarrassing to his host, he restrained himself with some effort
Xue Pan, in whose besotted eyes he appeared as a coveted treasure that was moving
at last within his grasp, lurched towards him, smiling happily, and gripped him firmly
by the arm.
‘Where are you off to little pal?’
‘Just-going out for a stroll,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘I’ll be back again directly.’
‘It won’t be any more fun here without you,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Do stay a bit
longer—just to show me that you care for me, eh? If it’s business that’s taking you
away, don’t worry, leave it to me! I don’t care how important it is whether it’s a
career you’re after or making a pile—with me for a pal you’ll have no more to worry
about!’
Angered and revolted by his odious intimacy, Xiang-lian quickly thought of a plan for
disposing of him. Drawing him aside to a spot where they could not be overheard, he
pre?tended to question his sincerity.
‘Are you really so fond of me, or are you just pretending?’ Xue Pan was almost
beside himself. His eyes became tiny slits of pleasure:
‘How can you ask such a question, my dear? Pretending? May I die this instant if I
am!’
‘Good. This place here is not convenient. We’d better go in again now and sit with
the others for a bit. Then I’ll leave, and you can leave a bit after me and follow me
back to my place. We’ll make a night of it. I’ve got a couple of very nice little boys
there who’ve never been “out” before; so you needn’t bring anyone with you: all the
service we’ll need is there already.’
Xue Pan was by now so delighted that his drunkenness had already half left him.
‘Do you mean this?’
‘What a person!’ said Xiang-lian. ‘One opens one’s heart to you and you don’t trust
them.’
‘No, no, no,’ said Xue Pan hurriedly. ‘I trust you. I’m no fool. There’s only one thing,
though: I don’t know where you live. If you leave before I do, where am I to look for
you?’
‘My place is outside the North Gate,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘Do you think you can tear
yourself from home and spend a whole night outside the city?’
‘What do I need a home for if I’ve got you?’ said Xue Pan. ‘All right,’ said Xiang-lian.
‘I’ll wait for you on the bridge then, outside the North Gate. We’d better get back to
the party now. Don’t forget: wait a bit after I’ve gone before going yourself; then -no
one should suspect anything.’
‘Yes,’ said Xue Pan, ‘yes.’
The two of them then went in again and resumed their places. Xue Pan found waiting
difficult and kept his eyes constantly on Xiang-lian, watching for him to go. At the
same time he began, in joyous anticipation of the pleasures in store, to drink with
greater and greater abandon, not waiting for the wine to be offered, but stretching
out rudely to left and right of him and plying himself from the wine-kettles of his
neighbours. Soon he was very drunk indeed.
Xiang-lian now rose to go and succeeded in slipping out of the main gate unobserved.
First he gave an order to his page Almond, who was waiting there:
‘You go home now. I have some business outside the city to attend to. I’ll be back
later.’
Then he vaulted into the saddle and rode off until he came to the North Gate of the
city. Passing through, he rode on till he came to the bridge, where he halted and took
up his-station-to wait for Xue Pan’s arrival.
After the time it would take to eat a meal, he caught sight of Xue Pan hurrying along
in the distance. His mouth was open, his eyes were staring, and his head turned from
side to side as he looked anxiously about him, for all the world like one of those little
clapper drums that children twirl upon a stick. So intent was he on scanning the
remoter parts of the landscape that he failed to take note of what was nearer at hand
and rode right past Xiang-lian without seeing him. Xiang-lian, who for all his loathing
could not but laugh at this, gave his horse rein and followed after. Presently Xue Pan
began to notice that he was getting into the open country and brought his horse
round about. As he did so, he found himself almost face to face with Xiang-lian.
‘I knew you wouldn’t fall me,’ he cried delightedly.
Xiang-lian smiled back.
‘Let’s go on a bit further—just in case anyone is tracking us.’
He trotted on ahead and Xue Pan followed, keeping as close to him as he could.
Presently, having satisfied himself that the country ahead was quite deserted,
Xiang-lian dis?mounted near the edge of a reed-filled dyke and tied his horse up to a
tree.
‘You get down too,’ he called pleasantly to Xue Pan. ‘Let’s first swear an oath that if
either of us is unfaithful to the other or betrays our secret to anyone, it shall happen
to him as the oath shall say.’
‘Yes,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Good ideal’ He dismounted eagerly tied his horse to another
tree, and straightway knelt down and began his oath:
‘If ever, in the days to come, I prove unfaithful or betray this secret to another, may
Heaven and Earth destroy.’
He got no further. At that point there was a great thump and the sensation of being
hit on the back of the neck by an object like a large iron hammer. Everything became
suddenly black, except that the darkness was filled with a confusion of flying stars,
and he collapsed forwards helplessly upon the ground.
Xiang-lian stepped up and surveyed him from above. Someone not used to taking
punishment, he concluded. It would be unwise to use too much force on him.
Turning him over, he performed, with a few deft flicks over Xue Pan’s face, the
operation which is described in the profession as ‘opening up the fruits hop’.
At first Xue Pan struggled to get up, but Xiang-lian lashed out with his foot and sent
him sprawling once more upon his back.
‘You were willing, just as much as I was,’ Xue Pan muttered plaintively. ‘You had
only to say so if you weren’t. Why fool me into coming out here with you and then
beat me up?’
He began cursing him obscenely.
‘You blind iniquity!’ said Liu Xiang-lian. ‘You don’t know who you’re dealing with.
You should be begging for mercy right now, not swearing at me. You’re not worth
killing, though. I’ll just give you a little lesson.’
He picked up his horsewhip and turning Xue Pan on his face once more, proceeded to
deal him thirty or forty cuts along the length of-his body, from his shoulders down to
his calves. Xue Pan was by now half sober, and finding the pain un?bearable, began
to roar.
‘Look at you!’ said Xiang-lian contemptuously. ‘I should have thought you could
take your medicine a bit better than that.’
He took him by the left leg and dragged him a few steps to where the reeds began, in
the stagnant ooze of the dyke, so that he was coated from head to foot with the
liquid mud.
‘Now,’ he said, ‘do you know who I am?’
As Xue Pan merely lay in the mud whimpering and made no reply, he threw away his
whip and gave him a few thumps with his fist. Xue Pan rolled about and bellowed:
‘You’ve broken my ribs. I know you’re straight. It was the others who told me you
weren’t. I shouldn’t have listened to them.’
 ‘Leave the others out of this,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘I’m talking about now.’
‘Now?’ said Xue Pan. ‘Now I know you’re straight. I kn6w I was wrong. What more
can I say?’
‘You’ll have to talk a bit prettier than that before I’ve finished with you,’ said
Xiang-lian.
‘Old pal—’ Xue Pan began, whimpering.
Xiang-lian dealt him another thump with his fist.
‘Ow! Ow! Chap—’
Two thumps this time.
‘Ow! Ow! Sir, then. Please sir, forgive me for being so blind. From now on I shall
honour you and fear you.’
Now drink some of this water,’ said Xiang-lian. Xue Pan knitted his brows with
disgust:
‘But this water is really filthy. I couldn’t get it down.’
Xiang-lian raised his list threateningly. ‘I’ll drink,’ said Xue Pan hurriedly. ‘I’ll drink.’
He bent down and drank a mouthful of the water at the base of the reeds; but before
he could swallow it, there was a great retching noise and he vomited up all that he
had recently eaten and drunk.
‘Filthy pig!’ said Xiang-lian. ‘Now eat that up and I let you off’
Xue Pan began kotowing to him.
‘Please, for your soul’s sake, earn a bit of merit: don’t try to make me do that! I
couldn’t do that if you -killed me.’
‘This stench is poisoning me;’ said Xiang-lian; and leaving Xue Pan, he unfastened
his horse, led it off a few paces, vaulted into the saddle, and galloped away.
Observing with relief that Xiang-lian had really gone, Xue Pan, cursing his folly for
having been so egregiously mistaken in his man, attempted to struggle to his feet;
but every part of him was hurting so much that it was impossible for him to rise.

*

Meanwhile, back at the party, Cousin Zhen and the others, suddenly noticing that the
two of them were missing, sought them for a while without success. Someone did
say that they thought they might have gone out of the North Gate; but Xue Pan had
told his pages not to follow him, and they were all in such dread of their master that
none of them dared go out there to look. In the end Cousin Zhen became so uneasy
that he sent Jia Rong with some of the boys to track them down.
Their trail led them through the North Gate and about two thirds of a mile along the
road which crosses the bridge outside it. There, suddenly, they caught sight of Xue
Pan’s horse, tied up to one of the trees at the side of a reed-filled dyke.
‘Good!’ they said. ‘Where the horse is, the rider must be.’ And all of them went
over to where the horse was standing.
As they did so, they heard someone groaning among the rushes; and there, when
they went to look, was Xue Pan, his clothes torn, his face cut and swollen almost
beyond recognition, and so besmirched with mud from head to foot that he had
more the appearance of an old wallowing sow than of a human being.
Jia Rong had little difficulty in guessing what had happened. Slipping from his horse,
he ordered the servants to help Xue Pan to his feet.
‘Tireless in the pursuit of love, Uncle I’ he said cheerfully, while they struggled to
do his bidding. ‘This time it’s led you into the reeds of the marshes. I suppose the
Dragon King must have taken a fancy to you and carried you off to be his son-in-law.
To judge from appearances, I should say that you -must have got caught up on his
horn!’
Xue Pan wished that the earth would open and swallow up his shame.
As there was clearly no question of getting him onto his horse, Jia Rong told one of
the boys to hurry back to the street outside the North Gate and hire a carrying chair.
When Xue Pan had been helped into this, they had him carried into the city,
themselves accompanying him on horseback. Jia Rong mischievously proposed that
they should take him back to the Lais’ house to rejoin the party: but Xue Pan
entreated so piteously and begged him so earnestly not to tell anyone of his plight,
that Jia Rong relented and allowed him to go back home alone.
Jia Rong himself returned to the party to report back to his father. From his account
of the state Xue Pan had been in when they found him Cousin Zhen deduced that he
must have been beaten up by Liu Xiang-lian but appeared remarkably unconcerned,
for he merely laughed and observed that ‘he could do with the lesson’. It is true that
he went to inquire after him in the evening, when he got back home from the party;
but Xue Pan was by that time nursing his injuries in bed and declined to see him on
the grounds that he was feeling too ill.
When Grandmother Jia and her party had got back to their several apartments, Aunt
Xue and Bao-chai found Caltrop with her eyes all swollen from weeping. On
discovering the cause, they rushed in to look at Xue Pan. Fortunately he appeared to
have no bones broken, but his face and body had taken a terrible battering. Torn
between maternal anguish at his plight and anger at the folly which had occasioned it,
Aunt Xue inveighed against Xue Pan and Xiang-lian by turns. She wanted to tell Lady
Wang and get her to have Xiang-lian arrested, but was dissuaded from doing so by
Bao-chai.
‘It’s not important enough for that, Mamma. The two of them had been drinking
and fell out over their cups, that’s all there was to it. Whenever that happens, it’s
always the drunker of the two who gets the worst of it. Besides, every?one knows
what a lawless, ungovernable creature Pan is. It’s only because you’re his mother
that you feel differently. If it’s satisfaction you want, that can easily be arranged. Just
wait a few days until Pan is better and can get about again. I’m sure Mr Zhen and Mr
Lian and the other menfolk will be unwilling to pass over this in silence. Probably
they will get up a little party and ask this person to it and make him apolo?gize to Pan
in front of everyone and admit that he was to blame. But if you insist on making an
issue of it now and telling Aunt about it, you will make it appear that you are so blind
to Pan’s faults that you allow him to go around provoking other people, but that as
soon as someone stands up to him, you fly up in arms and use our relations’
influence to oppress them.’
Aunt Xue at once saw the force of this.
‘You are quite right, my child. I was being silly.’
‘Dear Mamma! But now you are being sensible. He doesn’t fear you, and he won’t
listen to anyone else. He just goes on getting worse and worse. One or two good,
sharp shocks like this might bring him to his senses.’
Meanwhile Xue Pan lay on the kang in his bedroom, cursing Xiang-lian by every name
he could think of and calling on his boys to smash up his house, to beat him to death,
to have the law on him. Aunt Xue shouted to them that they were to do no such
thing. To Xue Pan she explained that Xiang-lian was in any case beyond the reach of
his vengeance.
‘Xiang-lian behaved very bad because he was drunk. When he came to himself
afterwards he was very sorry; and now, because he is afraid of the consequences, he
has fled the coun?try.’
When Xue Pan heard that, he—
But you shall learn that (if you wish) in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 48

The Love Deluded One turns his thoughts to trade and travel
And the Poetry Enthusiast applies herself to making verses



XUE PAN gradually calmed down when his mother told him that Xiang-lian had fled.
After four or five days the pain of his injuries had subsided, but not the bumps and
bruises; and as, while these still dis?figured him, he was unwilling to meet any of his
acquaintance, he kept to his room on the pretext that he was still too ill to go out.
The tenth month soon came. Several of the employees work?ing in Xue Pan’s shops
in the capital wanted to go back home for the annual settling of accounts and Xue
Pan found himself giving a farewell party for them in his room. Among those present
was one Zhang De-hui, the sixty-year-old manager of his largest pawnshop. He had
worked with the family since he was a lad and now had a household of his own and
an income of two or three thousand taels. He was planning to leave with the others
but not return until half way through the following year, as he explained to Xue Pan
on this occasion.
‘There’s a great shortage of stationery and perfumed goods just now,’ he said.
‘These things are sure to fetch high prices next year. I’m proposing to send my eldest
boy here after New Year to look after the shop, so that I can travel back later. I shall
buy up supplies of stationery and sandalwood fans on my way, aiming to get back
here in time for the Double Fifth. I reckon it should be possible to make several
hundred percent profit, even after the excise and all the other expenses have been
deducted.’
This gave Xue Pan an idea.
‘I haven’t felt like seeing anyone since that beating,’ he thought, ‘and some excuse
for getting away from every?body for a year or so is just what I’ve been looking for.
Obviously I can’t go on staying indoors and pretending I’m ill indefinitely. And for
another thing, I haven’t done very much with my life to date: I’m neither a scholar
nor a soldier, and though I call myself a merchant, I’ve never handled a pair of scales
or an abacus in my life, not to mention the fact that I know nothing about the places
and peoples of the Empire or its roads and waterways. Why don’t I get a bit of capital
together and spend a year or so travelling around with Zhang De-hui? It won’t matter
much whether I make any money or not; the main thing is that it will get me away
from my disgrace; and there is the added advantage that I shall be able to put in a bit
of sight-seeing as well.’
Having so decided, he waited until the other guests had gone and then, making
himself as agreeable as he knew how, informed Zhang De-hui of his decision and
asked him to delay his departure by a few days so that he would have time to
prepare.
That evening he told his mother.
Aunt Xue’s initial reaction was one of pleasure, but this quickly gave way to
misgivings. It was not that she attached much importance to the loss of a little capital;
she was con?cerned about the scrapes he might get into away from home. And so
she ended up by refusing.
‘I think you’d better stay here with me. I should worry less. After all, you don’t need
to make this money. It isn’t as if you haven’t got enough to spend.’
But Xue Pan had made his mind up and was not to be put off.
‘You’re always telling me how inexperienced I am and how ignorant and how
unwilling to learn; yet now that I’m making a real effort to turn over a new leaf by
standing on my own feet at last and learning a bit about the business, you won’t let
me. What do you want me to do? I’m not a girl, to be shut up at home all the time:
you’ll have to let me out some time or other. Besides, Zhang De-hui is an old,
experienced person and he’s worked for our family all his life. If I’m with him, I don’t
see how anything can go wrong. Even if I did ever slip up, I’m sure he’d soon tell me
off about it and put me right. And as he knows all there is to know about prices and
so forth, I should naturally always consult him on business matters. You couldn’t ask
for better conditions; yet you won’t let me go. Very well, I’ll get ready in secret and
leave without telling you. You’ll see me when I come back next year, after making a
fortune! I’ll show you!’
With that he went off to bed in a huff.
Aunt Xue discussed the matter with Bao-chai after he had gone.
‘It’s good that he should want to occupy himself with something serious at last,’
said Bao-chai. ‘The trouble is, of course, that however fair-sounding his intentions
may be now, once he’s outside he may succumb to his old weaknesses again, and
then it will be that much more difficult to control him. However, I suppose that is a
risk one has to take. If he is really going to reform, then this experience may prove a
life-long blessing. If he is not, I don’t see that there is very much left that you can do.
After all, there is only so much one can do for another person: the rest must be left
to Heaven. Pan is a grown man now, Mamma. If you maintain that he is too ignorant
of the world to be allowed out into it, you are not going to make him any less
ignorant by keeping him shut up indoors. And since he is being so reasonable for
once, I should make up your mind that you are going to lose eight or nine hundred
taels and hand it over to him to see how he manages. After all, he will have someone
from our own business helping him and they may well feel some compunc?tion
about cheating him; so it’ s by no means a foregone conclusion that he will lose it all.
And for another thing, away from home there won’t be those worthless companions
of his to egg him on; nor, on the other hand, will he have anyone to fall back on if he
gets into trouble. He will have to fend for himself: eat when he can and go hungry
when he can’t. And when it dawns on him that he is on his own and has no one he
can lean on, he may begin to behave a bit better. Surely it’s worth trying?’
Aunt Xue pondered her daughter’s words for some minutes.
‘I think you are probably right,’ she said eventually. ‘I certainly don’t mind using
up some of our money on the experiment. If he can learn a bit of sense from it, it will
have been money well-spent.’
Having thus concluded their discussion, the two of them went to bed.
Next day Aunt Xue had Zhang De-hui invited round once more, and while he was
being entertained by Xue Pan in the study, stationed herself in the loggia at the back
and, address?ing him through the window from this hidden vantage point, entrusted
her boy, with many a fond and careful instruction, to his care. Zhang De-hui gave
vigorous assurances of good intent, and having finished his meal, stood up and took
his leave, stopping on his way out to add a few words to Xue Pan about arrangements
for their departure:
‘The almanac says the fourteenth is the best day for travel?ling. I should start
packing and hiring mules straight away if I were you, Mr Xue, so that we can make a
start first thing on the fourteenth.’
Xue Pan, delighted at the prospect of getting away so soon, hastened to relay this to
his mother.
Assisted by Bao-chai, Caltrop and a couple of old nannies, Aunt Xue devoted the
whole of the next few days to packing. She selected five male members of the
domestic staff to ac?company Xue Pan on his travels: the husband of his o1d wet
nurse, two experienced older servants who had been in service with his father, and
two of the pages who normally waited on him. Three heavy carts were hired for the
luggage and four travelling mules. Xue Pan himself planned to ride on a mule from his
own stables—a large, sturdy animal with an iron-grey coat. He also planned to take a
saddle-horse of his own as an alternative mount. When all other preparations had
been completed, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai devoted the remaining evenings to
exhortation and admonishment of the prospective traveller.
On the thirteenth Xue Pan went to take leave of his Uncle Wang’s family in the city,
after which he went round the two mansions saying his good-byes to the Jias. There
was some talk of Cousin Zhen and one or two of the others seeing him off next day
for a parting cup on the road; but whether or not anything came of it our narrative
does not disclose.
Early on the morning of the fourteenth Aunt Xue and Bao-chai accompanied him to
the outer threshold of the inner gate and watched him with tearful eyes until they
could see him no more.

*

When Aunt Xue moved from Nanking to the capital, she had brought only four or five
couples with her in addition to the handful of old nannies and young unmarried
maids of her immediate household. Now that five of the menfolk had gone off to
accompany Xue Pan on his travels, only one or two male servants were left. The very
day that Xue Pan started on his journey, Aunt Xue went into his study, had all the
small fur?niture, blinds, curtains and other movables carried out and stored in her
own apartment, and ordered the wives of the absent menservants to move in with
her to sleep. She also ordered Caltrop to tidy up Xue Pan’s sleeping quarters, lock the
door, and move - into her apartment with the rest.
‘But Mamma,’ Bao-chai protested, ‘you’ve already got all those others to keep you
company. Why not let Caltrop move in with me? It gets lonely in the Garden now that
the nights are longer: another companion to sit with me in the evenings when I am
sewing would be very welcome.’
‘Of course,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I was forgetting. I should have thought of it myself. I was
telling Pan only the other day: Apricot is so young and scatter-brained and Oriole on
her own really isn’t enough for you. We really ought to buy you another girl.’
‘Buying is all very well if you know what the girl is going to be like,’ said Bao-chai;
‘but if you make a bad choice, then not only have you wasted your money—that’s a
small consideration—but you have a very great deal of trouble on your hands. If we
are going to buy a girl, it would be much better to take our time over the inquiries
and not get one until we are quite sure about her background.
She told Caltrop to get her bedding and toilet things to?gether and ordered Advent
and one of the old nannies to carry them for her to Allspice Court. Then she and
Caltrop went into the Garden together.
‘I was dying to ask the Mistress if she would let me move in with you after Mr Xue
had gone,’ said Caltrop, ‘but I was afraid she might think I only wanted to get into the
Garden to play. How wonderful that you should have asked her for me!’
‘I knew you’d had your heart set on this Garden for some time past,’ said Bao-chai
with a smile, ‘but you haven’t really been free till now. Dashing in and out for a few
minutes each day wouldn’t have given you time to enjoy it properly. That’s why I
have waited for this opportunity before asking. Now you will be able to settle in and
spend a whole year here. You get your wish, you see, and I gain a companion!’
‘Dear Miss!’ said Caltrop ‘Now that there is the time and the opportunity, will you
teach me how to write poetry, please?’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘You’re like the -famous general: “one conquest breeds appetite for another”. I
advise you to take things more gently. Today is your first day in the Garden. If I were
you, I should go out of that corner gate and, beginning with Lady Jia’s, call in at all the
different apartments and pay your respects to everybody. You needn’t go Out of your
way to tell them that you have moved into the Garden; but if the subject should
happen to arise, tell them that I have brought you in as my companion. After that,
when you get back into the Garden, you ought to go round and call on all the young
ladies.’
Caltrop was just going oft to do as Bao-chai advised, when Patience came hurrying in.
She was in a state of some agita?tion, which she smilingly masked, however, in
response to Caltrop’s eager greetings.
‘I’m bringing her in here to live with me as my companion,’ Bao-chai explained. ‘I
was just about to report the matter to your mistress.’
‘You don’t need to do that, Miss!’ said Patience. ‘What?ever next?’
‘On the contrary,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s the correct thing to do. “Every inn has its
landlord and every temple its priest,” as they say. Even though it is not a very
important matter, I think I should report it, if only so that the women on night watch
may know that there are two more girls—her and Advent—living in the Garden now,
and make no difficulties about letting them in and out. Anyway, if you will tell your
mistress when you get back, I won’t bother to send anyone about it myself.’
Patience promised that she would.
‘Now you’re here,’ she said to Caltrop, ‘you ought -to go and introduce yourself to
your new neighbours.’
‘I was just sending her off to do that when you came,’ said Bao-chai.
‘Well, you can leave nr out,’ Patience told Caltrop. ‘Mr Lian is ill at home in bed.’
Caltrop murmured a reply and went off to make her calls, beginning with
Grandmother Jia.
As soon as she had gone, Patience -seized Bao-chai’s hand and asked her, in a low
and urgent voice, whether she had heard ‘their’ news.
‘No,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve been so busy these last few days helping to get Pan off that
I haven’t heard anyone’s news. I haven’t even seen any of the girls during the past
day or two.’
‘Sir She has beaten Mr Lian so badly that he can hardly move. Do you mean to say
you haven’t even heard that?’
‘I heard something to that effect,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I didn’t know whether to
believe it or not. I’d been thinking of going to ask your mistress about it when you
came in just now. What did he beat him for?’
‘It was that toad Jia Yu-cun’s doing,’ said Patience bitterly. ‘Horrible man! It was a
bad day for this family when they got to know him. I don’ t know how much trouble
he hasn’t stirred up in the few years since first he came here. Last spring Sir She saw
some antique fans somewhere which so impressed him that when he got home and
looked at his own collection he decided that they were all no good and at once sent
every?one scouring around for some mote. Now there was a certain poor, unlucky
devil they call “Stony”—that’s a nickname, of course: I don’t know what his real
name is—so hard up that he never had enough to eat but who, it go happened, was
the owner of a collection of twenty antique fans that he guarded very closely, not
even allowing them to be taken out of his door. Mr Lian had a terrible job even
getting to see this man. In the end he did though, and eventually, after a great deal of
persuasion, managed to get himself invited into the house to have a look at the fans.
Mr Lian said he was only allowed a glimpse of them even then, but he said you could
see at once that they were the kind of fans that simply can’t be had anywhere today.
The fansticks were made of very special kinds of bamboo—naiad’s tears, black
bamboo, fawnskin and jadewood—and the paintings on them were all by old masters.
When he told Sir She about them, Sir She said at once that come what may he must
have them and that Stony could name his price. But Stony didn’t want a price not if
they offered him a thousand taels a fan, he said. He said he would rather die of
hunger and cold than sell them. There was nothing Sir She could do about that, of
course, except swear all the -time at Mr Lian for being “incompetent”. But I ask you,
Miss: Mr Lian had already promised five hundred taels cash down and still old Stony
had refused, so what more was there he could do? The matter might have rested
there if that black-hearted villain Jia Yu-cun hadn’t got to hear about it. He soon
thought of a way. He made out that Stony owed the government some money, had
him hauled off to the yamen, and when he got there, told him they would have to
detrain on his property to pay off the debt. Then he sent his officers round to Stony’s
house, seized the fans, valued them at a government price, and sent them to Sir She
as a present. Poor old Stony! I don’t know whether he’s alive now or dead. What I do
know is that when Sir She was telling Mr Lian how he had come by the fans at last,
Mr Lian couldn’t help remarking that he didn’t see anything very “competent” about
ruining a man and stripping him of all he possessed for so trifling a reason. That
made Sir She very angry, because of course he assumed that Mr Lian was really
getting at him. That was the main reason for the beating; but then there were a
number of smaller things a few days later—I don’t even remember now what they
were. They seem to have brought things to a head, because he suddenly went for
him. He didn’t pull him down and beat him with a flat-stick or a cudgel in the normal
way either: he just picked up the first thing that came to hand—I don’t know what it
was—and started hitting him with it where he stood. He cut his face open in two
places. We heard that Mrs Xue has got some kind of lotion for injur?ies of this sort
and I wondered if you’d mind letting me have a tablet.’
Bao-chai at once sent Oriole for the tablets and told her to bring two of them.
‘I won’t go and see your mistress now, under the circum?stances,’ she said, when
she handed them to Patience. ‘Give her my regards, though, won’t you?’
Patience thanked her and left.

*

Our story returns now to Caltrop. After dinner, by which time she had finished
making her calls, while Bao-chai went to join Bao-yu and the others in Grandmother
Jia’s apartment, Caltrop went off on her own to visit the Naiad’s House.
Dai-yu was by this time well on the way to recovery. She seemed so delighted to hear
that Caltrop had moved into the Garden, that Caltrop felt emboldened to make her a
request:
‘Now that I’m here and have got more time to spare, do you think you could teach
me .to write poetry? It would be such a piece of luck for me if you would.’
‘You can make your kotow and become my pupil if you like;’ said Dai-yu
goodnaturedly. ‘I’m no expert myself, but I dare say I could teach you the rudiments.’
Would you really?’ said Caltrop. ‘Then I’ll be your dis?ciple. But you must promise
not to get impatient with me.’
‘There’s nothing in it really,’ said Dai-yu ‘There’s really hardly anything to learn. In
Regulated Verse there are always four couplets: the “opening couplet”, the
“developing couplet”, the “turning couplet” and the “concluding couplet”. In the two
middle couplets, the “developing” and “turning” ones, you have to have
tone-contrast and parallel?ism. That’s to say, in each of those couplets the even
tones of one line have to contrast with oblique tones in the other, and vice versa, and
the substantives and non-substantives have to balance each other though if you’ve
got a really good, ori?ginal line, it doesn’t matter all that much even if the
tone-contrast and parallelism are wrong.’
‘Ah, that explains it I’ said Caltrop, pleased. ‘I’ve got an old poetry-book that I look
at once in a while when I can find the time, and I long ago noticed that in some of the
poems the tone-contrast is very strict, while in others it’s not. Someone told me the
rhyme:
         For one, three and five
         You need not strive;
         But two, four and six
         You must firmly fix.
and at first that seemed to explain the exceptions. But then I found that in some old
poems even the second, fourth and sixth syllables seemed to have -the wrong tones,
and I’ve been puzzling about it ever since. Now, from what you’ve just said, it sounds
as if these rules really aren’t important after all—that the most important thing is
that the language should be original.’
‘You’ve hit it exactly 1’ said Dai-yu. ‘As a matter of fact even the language isn’t of
primary importance. The really important things are the ideas that lie behind it. If the
ideas behind it are genuine, there’s no need to embellish the language for the poem
to be a good one. That’s what they mean when they talk about “not letting the words
harm the meaning
‘I love that couplet by Lu You,’ said Caltrop:
‘Behind snug curtained doors the incense lingers;
The well-worn concave patch the ground ink settles.
That’s genuine, isn’t it? So vivid.’
‘Good gracious! You mustn’t go reading that sort of stuff!’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s only
because of your lack of experience that you can think shallow -stuff like that any
good. Once you get stuck into that rut, you’ll never get out of it. You do as I tell you.
I’ve got the Collected Works of Wang Wei here. You take a hundred of Wang Wei’s
pentasyllabic poems in Regulated Verse and read and re-read them, carefully
pondering what you read, until you are thoroughly familiar with them all. After that
read a hundred or two of Du Fu’s Regulated Verse heptasyllabics and a hundred or
two of Li Bo’s heptasyllabic quatrains; then, with a firm foundation of those three
poets inside you, if you go on to look at some of the earlier poets like Tao Yuan-ming,
Xie Ling-yun, Ruan ji, Yu Xin and Bao Zhao, with your quickness and intelligence you
should have no difficulty in turning yourself into a fully-fledged bard within less than
a twelvemonth.’
‘In that case,’ said Caltrop excitedly, ‘dear Miss Lin, would you please lend me that
book you mentioned, so that I can take it back with me and study it before I go to
bed?’
Dai-yu told Nightingale to fetch down the volume of Regular Pentasyllabics from the
Collected Works of Wang Wei.
‘Read the ones I’ve marked with red circles,’ she said, handing the book to Caltrop.
‘They are my own selection. Just work your way through them gradually, taking each
one as it comes. If you have any difficulties, you can either ask Miss Bao about them
or else get me to explain them to you next time you see me.’
Caltrop carried the book back with her to Allspice Court, and sitting down under the
lamp, began reading -the poems, oblivious to all around her. Bao-chai made several
attempts at making her go to bed, but in the end, impressed by such total absorption,
gave up and left her alone.

*

Next morning, just as Dai-yu had completed her toilet, a smiling Caltrop walked in,
holding out the volume of Wang Wei and asking to exchange it for a volume of Du
Fu’s hepta?syllabics.
‘How many of them do you think you can remember? Dai-yu asked her.
‘I’ve been through all the ones marked with red circles,’ said Caltrop.
‘And do you think you have ‘learnt anything from them?’ ‘I think so,’ said Caltrop.
‘Though I can-’t be sure. Perhaps you can tell me.’
‘Certainly,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Discussion is what I was hoping for. it is the only way of
making progress. Tell me what you think they have taught you.’
‘Well,’ said Caltrop, ‘as I see it, poetry is very good at saying things which you can’t
exactly explain but which leave a very vivid impression in your mind; also it often says
things which at first seem illogical but are quite logical and natural when you stop to
think about them.’
‘That sounds very perceptive,’ said Dai-yu. ‘What about giving an example or two of
what you mean?’
‘Take that third couplet from his poem “On the Frontier”,’ said Caltrop:

        ‘Over a lone fire the straight smoke hangs;
        In the long river the round sun sets.

Now how can smoke really be “straight”? And why “the round sun”? Of course the
sun is round! Yet when you close the book and start thinking about those lines, the
scene they de scribe is so vivid that it’s almost as though you had been there. And if
you ask yourself what other two words be could have used instead of “straight” and
“round”, you realize that there aren’t any. Then again, in a couplet from another of
his poems:
         When the sun sets, the water whitens;
         When the tide rises, all the world is green.


“Whitens” and “green” at first seem like nonsense; but when you start thinking
about it, you realize that he had to use those two words in order to describe the
scene exactly as it was. When you read those lines out loud, the flavour of them is so
concentrated that it’s as though you had an olive weigh?ing several -thousand catties
inside your mouth! And there’s another couplet of his:

        Down by the ford the late sun lingers;
        Over the village a smoke-thread climbs.


“Lingers” and “climbs”: so simple, but so clever! I remember that year we came up
to the capital we moored the boat one evening towards dusk in a very lonely stretch
of country with only a few trees on the bank and a few houses far away in the
distance from which the blue smoke of peasants cook?ing their evening meal was
rising high, high into the clouds. When I read this couplet last night, it suddenly took
me back to that very spot.’
Bao-yu and Tan-chun had come in while she was talking and quietly sat down to
listen. Bao-yu was impressed.
‘To judge by what you’ve just said, you don’t need to read any more poetry. The
Emperor Jian-wen once remarked that “appreciation needs not to seek far afield”.
From your dis?cussion of that last couplet, I should say that you have already reached
the samādhi!’
‘Actually, although you won’t know this yet,’ said Dai-yu, ‘that “smoke-thread
climbs” line you admire so much is based on a line written by an earlier poet. If I
show it to you, I think you will agree that it is even more austerely effective than
Wang Wei’s line.’
She took down a copy of Tao Yuan-ming’s Works, hunted out the couplet she had in
mind, and handed it to her to look at:

         Half-lost in haze the distant haunts of men,
         Whose dawdling smoke the unseen hamlet marks.

Caltrop read it and nodded approvingly:
Yes, I see. He got the idea for “climbs” from the “dawd?ling” of this earlier line.’
Bao-yu laughed delightedly.
‘Perfect! You must end your discussion there. If you go on any longer, you’ll begin
unlearning what you’ve already dis?covered. You can start writing poetry yourself
now, straight away. It’s sure to be good.’
‘I can see I shall soon be writing an invitation asking you to join our poetry club,’
said Tan-chun smilingly.
Don’t make fun of me, Miss Tan,’ said Caltrop. ‘Writing poetry is something I’ve
always wanted to do, and now I’ve got the chance, I’m learning for the fun of it. I
don’t expect I shall ever be any good.’
‘Good heavens! we only write for the fun of it ourselves,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You surely
don’t imagine that what we write is good poetry? If we set ourselves up to be real
poets, people outside this Garden who got to hear of it would laugh so loud that
their teeth would drop out!’
‘That’s what Mencius calls “throwing yourself away”,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You shouldn’t
do that. The other day, when I was discussing Xi-chun’s painting with some of
Father’s gentlemen, they told me they had heard about our poetry club and asked if
they could see some of our poems, so I wrote a few out for them from memory. I
assure you, they were genuinely impressed. In fact, they have calligraphed them for
blocks to have them printed.’
‘Is this really true?’ Tan-chun and Dai-yu asked incredu?lously.
‘If anyone’s telling lies, it must be the parrot;’ said Bao-yu.
The two girls were aghast.
‘You really are the limit! Quite apart from the fact that the poems aren’t good
enough, you have no business to go showing our stuff to people outside.’
‘What’s the harm?’ said Bao-yu. ‘If those famous poems written by poetesses in
days gone by had never been -taken outside -the women’s quarters, we shouldn’t
know about them today.’
Just then Xi-chun’s maid Picture arrived and called Bao-?yu away to her mistress.
Caltrop pressed Dai-yu to lend her the volume of Du Fu; she also begged Dai-yu and
Tan-chun to set her a subject for a poem.
‘Let me try my hand at writing one myself,’ she said, ‘-and you can correct it for
me.’
‘Last night there was a very fine moon,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ve been thinking of writing a
poem about it myself, but haven’t yet got round to it. Why don’t you write a poem
about the moon? You can use “sky” and “light” as your rhymes; but I won’t set the
other rhyme words for you, you can use whichever ones you like.’
Clutching the volume of poems, Caltrop returned in great glee and at once began
thinking about her composition. After working out the first line or two, she could not
resist peeping at the Du Fu and reading a couple of poems. And in this way she
continued, alternately reading and composing by fits and starts, too excited to think
about eating or drinking or to sit still in the same place for two or three minutes
together.
‘Why give yourself so much trouble when you don’t have to?’ Bao-chai asked her.
‘It’s all that Frowner’s fault. I shall have to go and have it out with her. You are
inclined to be a dreamer at the best of times, but now you are becoming a real case I’
‘Please, Miss Bao I’ said Caltrop. ‘You are putting me off.’ She was writing while she
said this. Soon she had com?pleted the draft of a poem and handed it to Bao-chai to
look at. Bao-chai read it and laughed.
‘No, this is no good. This isn’t the way to write poetry. Still, don’t be disheartened. I
should take it to her just the same and see what she says.’
Caltrop followed her advice and went off to look for Dai?-yu. Dai-yu took the poem
and looked at it. This is what Caltrop had written:

       A chilly radiance bright, a fair round shape,
       The cold white moon hangs in the middle sky.
       The poet for inspiration seeks her oft;
       The homesick traveller from her turns his eye.
       Like a jade mirror hanging on azure wall,
       Like disc of jade suspended from on high.
       No need for lamps on such a glorious night,
    When every beam and post is bathed in light.

Dai-vu smiled.
‘You’ve certainly got some ideas there, but the words you’ve expressed them in
some-how don’t hang together properly. It’s because you haven’t read enough
poetry yet. It looks to me as if you’ve got rather stuck with this poem. If I were you,
I’d abandon it altogether and begin another one. Let yourself go a bit more this time.’
Caltrop returned in silence. This time she did not even go indoors but remained
outside among the trees at the water’s edge—to the considerable mystification of
those who passed by and saw her—sitting on a rock meditating, or squatting on her
heels in order to scratch characters on the ground.
Li Wan, Bao-chai, Tan-chun and Bao-yu, hearing of this interesting sight, stood on a
little hillock some distance away from her and watched with amusement. Bao-chai
insisted that Caltrop had gone mad.
‘You should have heard her last night. She was muttering away to herself until four
or five in the morning. And she can’t have slept for more than half an hour, for as
soon as it was daylight, I could hear her getting up again. She rushed through her
toilet and then rushed off to see Frowner. Pre?sently she came back again, and after
mooning around for half the day, she produced a poem; and as that was no good, I
assume she is now trying to write another one.’
‘“The genius of the place brings out the excellence of the person”,’ said Bao-yu,
misquoting slightly. ‘The -lord above doesn’t give us our talents for nothing. We
always used to say what a pity it was that a person of her qualities should lack
refinement—but look at her now! It proves there is some justice in the world.’
‘If only you had her powers of concentration,’ said Bao-chai, ‘you might study to
some purpose.’
Bao-yu did not reply.
Just then a very pleased-looking Caltrop was to be seen hurrying off in the direction
of the Naiad’s House.
‘Let’s go after her and see if it’s any better this time,’ said Tan-chun.
When the three of them arrived, Dai-yu had the poem in her hand and was already
discussing it.
‘What’s it like?’ they asked her.
‘Well, for a beginner, of course, it’s very good,’ said Dai-yu; ‘but it isn’t really right
yet. It’s too laboured. She’ll have to try again.’
The others asked if they might have a look. This is what they read:

                 Silver or water on the casement cold?
                 See its round source in yon clear midnight sky.
                 Blanched ghostly white, plum-blossoms spread their scent,
                 And dew on willow-slips begins to dry.
                 Is it white powder on the paving spilled?
                 Or grains of frost that on the railings lie?
                 I wake to find no other soul in sight
                 But that still face which through the blind sheds light.
‘It’s not much like a poem about the moon,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but if you altered the
title to “Moonlight”, it would fit rather well. Look at these lines: each of them is not
about the moon, it’s about moonlight. Well, all poetry is only a lot of nonsense! I
should leave it for a few days, Caltrop, if I were you. There’s no hurry.’
But Caltrop, though she had truly believed that this second poem was a minor
masterpiece and was extremely dashed by its rejection, was most unwilling to give
up. She wanted to begin thinking about her next poem straight away; and as she
found the talk and laughter of the cousins distracting, she went out to where the
bamboos began, at the foot of the terrace. There she gave herself up to cogitation of
such fierce intensity that she became totally obvious to all sights and sounds around
her, and when Tan-chun jokingly called to her through the window to ‘call it a day’,
she merely looked up with a somewhat dazed expression and replied that ‘“day”
didn’t rhyme: the rhyme word she was using was “sky”’. The others, hearing this, all
burst out laughing.
‘The girl’s got poetry mania!’ said Bao-chai. ‘This is all Frowner’s doing.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Dai-yu. ‘The Sage tells us that we should be “tireless in teaching
others”, She came and asked me for help. How could I possibly refuse her?’
‘Let’s take her to Xi-chun’s place and get her to look at the painting,’ said Li Wan.
‘Perhaps it will take her mind off poetry for a bit.’
She went outside, the others following, and taking Caltrop by the hand, led her to the
Spring In Winter room of Lotus Pavilion, where they found Xi-chun, fatigued by her
labours, lying on the couch taking an afternoon nap. The painting was on the wall,
masked by a covering of gauze. The cousins woke up Xi-chun and removed the cover
from the painting. Barely three-tenths of it had been completed. Several female
figures were to be seen scattered about here and there in the landscape.
‘Look,’ they said, pointing them out to Caltrop, ‘anyone who can write poetry gets
put into the picture. You must hurry up and learn, so that she can put you in too!’
After chatting and joking for a while, they broke up and went off to their several
apartments.
Caltrop could think of nothing else but her poem. in the evening she sat by the lamp
thinking about it, and it was after midnight when she went to bed. Even in bed she
lay with her eyes wide open, continuing to think about it; and it was not until three
or four in the morning that she gradually dropped off to sleep.
At daybreak Bao-chai woke up and listened: Caltrop ap?peared to be fast asleep.
‘She was tossing about all night,’ thought Bao-chai. ‘I wonder if she managed to
finish her poem. I won’t call her now; she must be exhausted.’
Just then she heard Caltrop laugh and call out in her sleep:
‘Ha! Got it! Let her try saying that this one isn’t any good!’
Bao-chai was both touched and amused.
‘What have you got?’ she asked, quickly waking her. ‘This poetry business is
becoming positively unnatural! I don’t know about learning how to write poetry:
what you’ll likelier get, if you go on much longer in this fashion, is a serious illness!’
The intensity of Caltrop’s application had, in fact, induced a concentration of the vital
fluids which, finding no outlet during the daytime, had resulted in her being able to
produce a whole eight-line poem in her sleep. She wrote it down as soon as she had
combed and washed, and then went out to look for the others.
At Drenched Blossoms, in the little pavilion on the bridge, she came upon Li Wan and
the cousins on the way back from their morning duty-call on Lady Wang. Bao-chai
was just telling them how Caltrop had composed a poem while she was dreaming
and how she had cried out in her sleep, and the others were laughing as they listened.
When they looked up and saw Caltrop herself approaching them, they eagerly asked
her if they might see her poem.
For further details, please see the following chapter.

CHAPTER 49



Red flowers bloom brighter in dazzling snow
And venison reeks strangely on rosebud lips



WHEN Caltrop saw the cousins talking and laughing about her, she came forward,
smiling herself, and handed the poem she was carrying to Dai-yu.
‘See what you think of this one,’ she said. ‘If this one is all tight, I shall go on
learning; if it’s still no good, I shall just have to give up the whole idea.’
The others clustered round Dai-yu to look. This is what they read:

             Ethereal splendour no cloud can blot out!
             Chaste lovely presence of the cold night sky!
             From a white world the washer’s dull thud sounds,
             Till in the last watch cocks begin to cry,
             While, by a fisherman’s sad flute entranced,
             A lady leans out from her casement high;
             And you, White Goddess, lulled in sweet delight,
             Wish every night could be a fifteenth night.
There were exclamations from all of them when they had finished reading it.
‘But this is not just “all right”,’ they said, ‘this is a good and highly original poem. It
shows the truth of the proverb: “Nothing is too difficult for one who has a mind to do
it.” We shall definitely be inviting you now to join our poetry club.’
Caltrop, supposing that they were only saying this to humour her, could not quite
believe them and continued to press Dai-yu and Bao-chai for the truth.
Just at that moment a number of maids and old serving women came hurrying
towards them in a state of great ex?citement:
‘Mrs Zhu! Young ladies! Come and meet you relations! A whole lot of young ladies
and other people we’ve never seen before have just arrived.’
Li Wan laughed.
‘What are you talking about? Whose relations have just arrived?’
There are two young cousins of yours, Mrs Zhu,’ they said, ‘and there’s a young lady
who says she’s Miss Bao’s cousin, and a young gentleman that’s cousin to Mr Xue.
We’re on our way now to fetch Mrs Xue. Why don’t you and the young ladies go on
ahead and meet them?’
They hurried off to complete their mission.
‘It sounds as if my cousin Xue Ke and his sister must have come,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Can
it be them, though?’
‘And it sounds as if my Aunt Li must have decided to bring her two daughters to the
capital,’ said Li Wan. ‘But how strange that they should have arrived together I’
When she and the cousins entered Lady Wang’s main recep?tion room, they found it
packed with people. Apart from the ones whom the servants had mentioned, they
found Lady Xing’s brother’s wife with her daughter Xing Xiu-yan. The three of them,
Lady Xing’s brother and his wife and daughter, had come up to the capital to put
themselves under the protec?tion of Lady Xing. By a coincidence Xi-feng’s brother
Wang Ren was starting out for the capital just as they were plan?ning to set out
themselves, so, on the strength of the marriage connection (Wang Ren being the
brother of Lady Xing’s daughter-in-law), they had elected to travel in his company.
While stopping at one of the canal ports half-way along their route, they had made
the acquaintance of Li Wan’s widowed aunt and her two daughters, Li Wen and Li Qi,
also on their way to the capital, and when it emerged that all of them were
marriage-relations of the Jia family, these three, too, had joined the party. A little
after this, Xue Pan’s cousin Xue Ke had decided to bring his sister Bao-qin to the
capital to attend to the formalities of her betrothal, Some years previously her father,
while temporarily residing in the capital, had prom?ised her to the son of a certain
Academician Mei, but had died before the betrothal could be made formal. Hearing
that his aunt’s kinsman Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, Xue Ke and his
sister had pushed on ahead to -join him. Thus it was that today all these people
presented themselves simultaneously at the Rong mansion lo6lting for their various
relations.
When at last the introductions and courtesies were over, it became clear that
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang were delighted with the new arrivals.
I knew something nice was going to happen from the way the lampwick was
behaving last night,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It kept flaring up and then forming into
little balls at the top. You see, I was tight!’
A general exchange of family talk ensued, and the handling over by the visitors of the
presents they had brought with them. After that Grandmother Jia invited them all to
take lunch with her, with wine to celebrate.
Xi-feng, it goes without saying, was now busier than ever. Li Wan and Bao-chai, who
had a great deal of catching up on family news to do, were also kept busy exchanging
informa?tion with their relations about all the things that had hap?pened during the
years since they last met. Dai-yu, observing them, at first shared in their happiness,
but when she began to reflect on the contrast with her own solitary and orphaned
state, she was obliged to go away in order to hide her tears. Bao-yu, well aware of
the reason for her sudden disappearance, went after her, and with a good deal of
coaxing, succeeded at last in comforting her.
As soon as Dai-yu had dried her tears, Bao-yu hurried back to Green Delights to tell
Aroma, Musk and Skybright about the visitors.
‘You ought to go and have a look,’ he told them. ‘This nephew of my Aunt Xue’s is
completely different from Cousin Pan. From his looks and behaviour you’d think he
was Bao-chai’s brother. He’s certainly more like her than Pan is. And as for the
sister—you’re always saying what a beauty Cousin Chai is, but wait till you’ve seen
her! And then there are my sister-in-law’s two cousins—well, words just fail-me!
Heavenly lord, what a store of beauty you must have at your disposal to be able to
produce such paragons! I’ve been like the frog living at the bottom of the well who
thought the world was a little round pool of water. Up to now I’ve always believed
that the girls in this household were without equals anywhere; but now, even
without my needing to go outside, here they come, each one more beautiful than the
last! Today has been an education for me. Don’t tell me there are any more like this:
the shock would be too great!’
He laughed excitedly. Aroma saw that he was in one of his crazy moods and refused
to go and look. But Skybright and the others were more curious and at once hurried
over for a peep. They returned soon after, full of smiles, to report on what they had
seen.
‘Do go and look!’ they urged Aroma. ‘There’s Lady Xing’s niece and this cousin of
Miss Bao’s and Mrs Zhu’s two cousins: it’s not often you get a chance to see four such
beautiful bul?rushes together!’
Scarcely had these words been uttered when a smiling Tan-chun came in looking for
Bao-yu.
‘Our poetry club is in luck,’ she said, finding him indoors with the maids. ‘Think of
all those new members!’
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘What a happy inspiration of yours it was to start it! It’s almost as
though providence had sent these people here to make it prosper. But are you sure
they can all write poetry?’
‘I’ve already asked them,’ said Tan-chun. ‘They are too modest to say outright, of
course, but from what I can judge I’m pretty sure that either they all can, or even if
they can’t, would learn very quickly. Look how quick Caltrop has been.’
‘Which of the four do you think is the prettiest, Miss?’ said Skybright. ‘I say Miss
Bao’s cousin.’
‘Yes, I think I agree,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I think even Bao-chai is not quite as beautiful as
her.’
Aroma had been listening to all this with growing curiosity. ‘This is certainly news to
me!’ she said. ‘I shouldn’t have thought it possible to find anyone more beautiful
than Miss Bao. I must go and have a look.’
‘Grandmother was completely captivated as soon as she set eyes on her,’ said
Tan-chun. ‘She’s already insisted that Mother should become her godmother, and it’s
decided that Grandmother shall bring her up as her own grandchild.’
‘Really?’ Bao-yu seemed delighted.
‘When have I ever told you a lie?’ said Tan-chun. There was a glint of mischief in
her eye: ‘Now that she’s got such a beautiful granddaughter, she’ll probably lose
interest in her darling grandson.’
‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Bao-yu unconcernedly. ‘She ought to give preference to
girls. That’s as it should be. By the way, it’s the sixteenth today. It’s the day for our
poetry dub meeting.’
‘Cousin Lin has only recently got up, and Ying-chun is ill again,’ said Tan-chun.
‘We’re not really in any shape for a meeting at the moment.’
‘Ying-chun doesn’t care much about writing poetry any?way,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Surely
we can manage without her?’
‘Yes, but I think we ought to wait a few days, even so” said Tan-chun. ‘Why don’t
we wait until we’ve got to know the newcomers a bit better and then invite them to
join us? I shouldn’t think sister-in-law or Cousin Chai can either of them be much in
the mood for writing poetry at the moment. And Xiang-yun isn’t here. And Frowner
has only just recovered. No one is really up to it yet. We ought to wait until Yun
arrives and the new lot have settled in; then, when Frowner is completely better and
sister-in-law and Cousin Chai are a bit less preoccupied and Caltrop has made some
more progress, we can invite everyone to a plenary session. What you and I ought to
do now is go round to Grandma’s and see what arrangements are being made about
these people’s accom?modation. We know that Chai’s cousin is staying here,
be?cause Grandma has adopted her; but we don’t know yet about the others. If
there are no plans for them to stay here, we must ask Grandma to invite them. If
possible we should get her to let them live in the Garden. It would be fun to have
some more neighbours.’
Bao-yu grew quite radiant at the thought.
‘How clever you are, Tan!’ he told his sister admiringly.
‘I’m such a stupid ass. I get so carried away that I don’t think about the important
things like you do.’
Brother and sister then went together to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where they
found the old lady in wonderful high spirits following Lady Wang’s recognition of Xue
Bao-quin as her god-daughter. She considered that this entitled her to treat the girl
as her grandchild, which she had begun doing by insisting that she end the nights
with her in her apartment and not in the Garden with Bao-chai. Xue Ke would
naturally stay with his aunt and occupy the study that Xue Pan had vacated.
‘ This niece of yours surely doesn’t need to go back to her parents yet?’
Grandmother Jia said to Lady Xing. ‘Let her stay in the Garden for a few days and
enjoy herself.’
Lady Xing’s brother and sister-in-law had been living in extremely straitened
circumstances, and now that they had come up to the capital, were relying on her to
provide them with accommodation and financial assistance. She was natur?ally only
too delighted to have one less person to her charge, and promptly handed Xiu-yan
over to Xi-feng to dispose of.
Bearing in mind the varied, somewhat peculiar, tempera?ments of the Garden’s
inhabitants, Xi-feng doubted the wis?dom of putting Xiu-yan in with one of the
others; on the other hand she foresaw disadvantages in opening up a separate
establishment for her. In the end she put her in with Ying chun, reflecting that if the
girl did experience any difficulties in -living with Ying-chun, then even if Lady Xing got
to hear of it, she, Xi-feng, could not be held responsible, since Ying-?chun was Lady
Xing’s own half-daughter.
From this time onwards, not counting the time she spent at home with her parents,
Xiu-yan received, for every whole month that she lived with Ying-chun in Prospect
Garden, an allowance from Xi-feng of exactly the same amount as -the monthly
allowance that was paid to Ying-chun herself.
To Xi-feng’s dispassionate eye it soon became apparent that in both temperament
and behaviour Xiu-yan was quite unlike Lady Xing and her parents that she was in
fact an extremely sweet and lovable person. Sorry that so gentle a soul should be so
poor and unfortunate, Xi-feng treated her with a tact and considerateness that she
did not always show the others. Lady Xing, on the other hand, seemed -scarcely
aware of her niece’s existence.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang esteemed Li Wan as a good and virtuous young
woman who, having lost her hus?band at an early age, bore widowhood with
fortitude and restraint. Now that this widowed aunt had arrived, they re?fused to
bear of her taking lodgings outside, and though the good lady made many polite
efforts to decline, insisted that she and her two daughters, Li Wen and Li Qi, should
move into Sweet-rice Village and stay there with Li Wan at the family’s expense.
No sooner had the new arrivals begun settling in than news came that Grandmother
Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, the Marquis of Zhong-jing, was being transferred to an
important position in one of the outer provinces and would shortly be leaving for his
new post, taking his family with him. Grandmother Jia could not bear the idea of a
permanent separation from her great-niece, and so it was agreed that Xiang-yun, too,
should move into residence with the Jias. It was Grandmother Jia’s original intention
that Xi-feng should set up a separate establishment for her in the Garden; but as
Xiang-yun herself rigorously opposed this idea and insisted on living with her beloved
Bao-chai, she was allowed to have her way.
The Garden’s society was now larger and livelier than it bad ever been before. With Li
Wan as its doyenne it numbered if you counted Xi-feng as an honorary member
thirteen people: Li Wan, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun, Li
Wen, Li Qi, Bao-qin, Xing Xiu-yan, Bao-yu and Xi-feng. Apart from the two young
married women, the rest were all fifteen, sixteen or seventeen years old. Most of
them were in fact born in the same year, several of them in the same month or even
on the same day. Not only Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and the servants, even
the young people themselves had difficulty in remembering who was senior to whom,
and soon gave up trying, and abandoned any attempt at observing the usual
formalities of address.
Caltrop could now think of nothing else all day long but writing poetry. Up to now
she had refrained from importun?ing Bao-chai too persistently for advice, but with
the arrival of an unwearying talker like Shi Xiang-yun upon the scene she was in her
element. Xiang-yun was only too willing to accede to her requests for instruction, and
morning, noon and night the two of them were to be found together, always in
ani?mated discussion.
‘You two are deafening me with your perpetual chatter,’ Bao-chai complained.
‘Imagine how ridiculous and un?maidenly it would seem to a man of letters if he
heard that girls were treating poetry as a serious occupation! Caltrop on her own was
bad enough, but with a chatterbox like you on top of it, Yun, I’m finding it a bit too
much. Everywhere I go it’s “the profundity of Du Fu”, or “Wei Ying-wu of Soochow’s
limpidity”, or “the somewhat meretricious charm of Wen Ting-yun”, or “Li Shang-yin’s
obscurity”. Still, there are two important living poets I’ve so far heard no men?tion
of.’
‘Oh?’ said Xiang-yun, all agog. ‘Which two?’
‘I’ve heard no mention of Crazy Caltrop’s prodigious pertinacity or the linguipotent
loquacity of Shi Xiang-yun,’ said Bao-chai.
The other two burst out laughing.
At that moment Bao-qin arrived. She was wearing a magni?ficent rain-cape that
glittered as she moved with gold and greenish lights. Bao-chai asked her where she
had got it from.
‘Lady Jia gave me it,’ said Bao-qin. ‘She looked it out for me because it was
beginning to sleet.’
Caltrop examined it curiously.
‘No wonder it looks so beautiful: this is woven out of peacock’s down.’
‘ That’s not peacock’s down,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It’s made from mallard’s
head-feathers.’ She smiled at Bao-qin teasingly:
‘One can see how fond of you she must be. She’s fond of Bao-yu, but she’s never let
him wear this.’
Bao-chai laughed:


‘To each a different fortune meted—

that’s certainly a true saying. I never dreamt that she would be coming here—much
less that when she did, Lady Jia would immediately fail for her like this!’
‘Apart from the time you spend with Her Old Ladyship,’ Xiang-yun advised Bao-qin,
‘I should stick to the Garden as much as possible if I were you. In these two places
you can eat and drink and play anywhere you please. But be careful of Lady Wang’s
place. If she’s in when you go there, then you can sit and talk with her as long as you
like; but if she’s not, it’s best not to go inside. There are a lot of nasty people in there
who like to do us harm.’
This highly indiscreet warning was uttered so matter-of-?factly that Bao-chai, Bao-qin,
Caltrop and Oriole were com?pelled to laugh.
‘I won’t say you are thoughtless,’ said Bao-chai, because you obviously mean well;
but you really are a bit too out?spoken. You and Qin ought to be -sisters, since you
are so concerned about her.’
Xiang-yun looked at Bao-qin appraisingly.
‘She is the only one of us who could wear this cape,’ she said. ‘Anyone else would
look wrong in it.’
Just then Amber walked in with a message from Grand?mother Jia:
‘Her Old Ladyship says please Miss Bao don’t be too strict with Miss Qin; she’s still
only little and should he allowed to have her own way. And she says if there’s
anything Miss Qin wants, she shouldn’t be afraid to ask for it.’
Bao-chai stood up politely to acknowledge the message. Afterwards she nudged
Bao-qin playfully.
‘I don’t know! Some people have all the luck. You’d better leave us, hadn’t you,
before we start maltreating you? It beats me. What have you got that I haven’t got?’
She was still teasing Bao-qin when Bao-yu and Dai-yu arrived. ‘You say that in jest,
Chai,’ said Xiang-yun, noting their entry, but I know someone who really thinks that
way.
‘If anyone’s really upset, it must be him,’ said Amber, pointing her finger at Bao-yu.
Xiang-yun laughed at her simple-mindedness:
‘No, he’s not that sort of person..’
‘Then if it’s not him you mean, it must be her,’ said Amber, pointing now at Dai--yu.
Xiang7yun fell silent. This time it was Bao-chai who spoke:
‘Wrong again. She feels the same way about my cousin as I do. in fact, I believe if
anything she’s even fonder of her; so how could she be upset? Don’t be taken in by
Miss Shi’s nonsense, my dear Amber. When did you ever hear Miss Shi say anything
serious?’
From past experience Bao-yu—who still knew nothing of Dai-yu and Bao-chai’s
recent rapprochement was too fami?liar with Dai-yu’s jealous disposition not to feel
appre?hensive that Grandmother Jia’s new partiality for Bao-qin might upset her. He
was puzzled, therefore, by Bao-chai’s rejoinder, and even more puzzled when he
studied the ex?pression on Dai-yu’s face and found that, far from showing any trace
of the resentment he would have expected, it exactly tallied with what Bao-chai had
said.
‘Those two used not to be like this,’ he thought. ‘Yet to judge from appearances,
they are ten times friendlier towards each other now than they are towards anyone
else.’
Shortly after this he heard Dai-yu calling Bao-qin ‘dear’ and fussing over her as if she
were Bao-qin’s elder sister.
Bao-qin was a young, warm-hearted creature; she was, moreover, highly intelligent
and had been taught her letters from an early age. By the time she had been a couple
of days in the ha household, she had already formed some impression of its members,
Finding that her cousins were quite different from the vapid, giggling creatures to be
found in the women’s quarters of so many houses, she was soon on friendly terms
with all of them and was careful not to show off; but in Dai-yu she recognized a
superior intelligence, and consequently felt even more affection and respect for her
than she did for any of the others. Hence the intimacy which Bao-yu had just
witnessed. He studied the pair of them curiously and marveled in silence.
Shortly after this, when Bao-chai and Bao-qin had gone off to Aunt Xue’s place and
Xiang-yun had gone to see Grand?mother Jia and Dai-yu had gone back to her own
room to rest, Bao-Yu went after Dai-yu to question her.
‘I’ve read The Western Chamber,’ he said, ‘and understood it well enough to have
offended you on more than one occa?sion by quoting it at you; yet there’s one line in
it I still don’t understand. Do you think, if I told you it, you could explain it-to me?’
Dai-yu realized that something must lie behind this request, nevertheless she
smilingly promised that she would do her best.
‘It comes in the section called “Ying-ying’s Reply”,’ said Bao-yu:
            ‘Since when did Meng Guang accept Lang Hong’s tray?

The question seems rather an apposite one. Those two little words “since when”
particularly intrigue me. Kindly ex?pound them for me, will you? Since when did
Meng Guang accept Liang Hong’s tray?
Dai-yu could not but be amused by the droll way in which he had gone about making
his inquiry.
‘That’s a good question,’ she said. ‘It was a good question when Reddie asked it in
the play, and it’s a good question when you ask it now.’
‘There was a time, not so long past, when you might have been deeply offended by
it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘yet now you say nothing.’
‘It’s because now I know she’s a very good person,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Before I used to
think she was two-faced.’
She proceeded to tell him, at some length, about the motherly talking to Bao-chai
had given her after her lapses in the drinking game and about the gift of bird’s nest
and sugar and the long talk Bao-chai had had with her when she was ill.
‘I see,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I needn’t have been so puzzled then. It seems that the
question

             Since when did Meng Guang accept Liang Hong’s tray?
could have been answered with another line from the same act of the same play. It
was since you spoke

    Like a child whose unbridled tongue knows no concealment!

Dai-yu went on to talk about Bao-qin, whom she evidently looked on as a younger
sister. Alas, this only reminded her that she had no real sister of her own and she
began to cry. Bao-yu would have none of this.
‘Now come on, Dai! You’re making yourself upset. Look at you! You’re thinner than
ever this year. It’s because you won’t take care of yourself. You positively look for
ways of making yourself miserable. It’s almost as though you felt you hadn’t spent
the day properly unless you’d had at least one good cry in it!’
‘No,’ said Dai-yu as she wiped her eyes. ‘I feel very low these days, but I don’t think
cry as much as I used to.’
‘I’m sure you do,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s just that it’s become so much a habit with you
that you no longer know whether you’re crying or not. I’m sure you cry just as much
as you always did.’
Just then one of the maids from his room arrived carrying his scarlet felt rain-cape.
‘Mrs Zhu has just sent someone round with a message for you, Master Bao,’ said
the maid.’ She says it’s starting to snow now and she wants to discuss with you about
inviting people for the poetry meeting.’
She had barely finished speaking when Li Wan’s emissary arrived to deliver the same
message to Dai-yu. Bao-yu sug?gested that they should go to Sweet-rice Village
together and waited while she put on a pair of little red-leather boots which had a
gilded cloud pattern cut into their surface, a pelisse of heavy, dark-red bombasine
lined with white fox-fur, a complicated woven belt made out of silvery green shot silk,
and a snow-hat. The two of them then set off together through the snow.
They arrived to find that nearly all the others were there already, mostly in red felt or
camlet snow-cloaks. The exceptions were Li Wan, who wore a simple greatcoat of
plain woollen material buttoned down the front, Xue Bao-chai in a pelisse of
ivy-green whorl-patterned brocade trimmed with some sort of exotic lamb’s wool,
and Xing Xiu-yan, who had no protection against the snow of any kind beyond the
every day clothes she was wearing.
Presently Xiang-yun arrived. She was wearing an enormous fur coat that
Grandmother Jia had given her. The outside was made up of sables’ heads and the
inside lined with long-haired black squirrel. On her head was a dark-red camlet
‘Princess’ hood lined with yellow figured velvet, whose cut-out cloud shapes were
bordered with gold, and round her neck, muffling her up to the nose, was a large
sable tippet.
‘Look, Monkey!’ said Dai-yu, laughing at this furry appari?tion. ‘Trust Yun to turn
the need for wearing snow-clothes into an excuse for dressing up! She looks just like
a Tartar groom!’
‘You haven’t seen what I am wearing underneath yet,’ said Xiang-yun, and opened
out the fur coat to show them.
She had on a short, narrow-sleeved, ermine-lined tunic jacket of russet green,
edge-fastened down the centre front, purfled at neck and cuffs with a triple band of
braiding in contrasting colours, and patterned all over with dragon-roundels
embroidered in gold thread and coloured silks. Under this she was wearing a short
riding-skirt of pale-red satin damask lined with white fox belly-fur. A court girdle of
different-coloured silks braided into butterfly knots and ending in long silken tassels
was tied tightly round her waist. Her boots were of deerskin. The whole ensemble
greatly enhanced the somewhat masculine appearance of her figure with its graceful,
athletic bearing.
The others laughed:
‘She loves dressing up as a boy. Actually she looks even more fetching in boy’s
clothes than she does as a girl.’
‘Let’s get down to business,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What I want to know is, who’s paying
for the entertainment this time?’
‘Well, this is what I thought,’ said Li Wan. ‘We’ve already passed the date for our
regular meeting, and we don’t want to wait until the next one comes round, because
it’s too far ahead. As it’s snowing, I thought it would be rather nice if we clubbed
together for a little snow-party in honour of the newcomers and used it as an
occasion for doing some poetry-making as well. What do the rest of you think?’
‘I think that’s exactly what we should do,’ said Bao-yu. ‘The only thing is, it’s a bit
late for a party today, but if we wait until tomorrow, the snow may have stopped by
then and it won’t be so much fun.’
‘It’s very unlikely to,’ said the others. ‘And even if it has stopped by tomorrow
morning, it will surely be snowing still tonight, so it should be well worth looking at in
the morning.’
‘This place here is all right, of course,’ said Li Wan, ‘but I thought that for this
occasion it would be nicer if we met in Snowy Rushes Retreat. I’ve already told them
to light the stove there and get the underground heating system started. I don’t think
Grandma would much like the idea of our sitting round the stove making verses, so,
as it’s only a very little party, I propose that we don’t tell her about it. As long as we
let Feng know, it should be sufficient. As regards contributions: if each of you will
bring one tael to me here, it ought to be enough. Not you five;’ she pointed to
Caltrop, Bao-qin, Li Wen, Li Qi and Xiu-yan—‘And Ying-chun and Xi-chun won’t be
contributing either. Ying-chun is ill and Xi-chun is on leave of absence. That leaves
only Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun and Dai-yu. If you four will contribute one tael each,
I will undertake to contribute five or six taels myself. Together that should be ample.’
Bao-chai and the other three promised to bring her their contributions later and
went on to ask what titles and rhymes should be set for the poetry-making.
‘I’ve already decided that,’ said Li Wan. ‘Let it be a surprise for you when you
come.’
Arrangements for the party having now been settled, the cousins chatted together
for a while longer before going off in a body to visit Grandmother Jia.
That concludes the narrative for that day,

*

At first light next morning Bao-yu, who in excited anticipa?tion of the day ahead had
barely slept all night, crawled from the covers and lifted up a corner of the
bed-curtain to inspect the weather. Although the doors and windows were still
fastened, there was an ominous brightness about the latter which led him to
conclude inwardly groaning with dis?appointment that the snow must have cleared
and the sun be shining. Jumping out of bed, he opened one of the inner casements
and looked through the glass. It was not the sun after all, he found, but the white
gleam of snow. It had been snowing all night; there was a good foot of snow on the
ground and it was still coming down in great, soft flakes, I like the flock from a
torn-up quilt.
Overjoyed to find that he had been wrong, he at once began shouting for his maids,
and as soon as he had finished washing and dressed himself in an aubergine-coloured
gown lined with fox, a jacket with a sealskin shoulder-cape, and a belt round his waist
for warmth, he donned his elegant rain-bat and cape (the Prince of Bei-jing’s present
that Dai-yu had so much admired), stepped into his pear wood patterns, and set off
for Snowy Rushes Retreat.
Once outside tile courtyard gate, the Garden stretched out on every hand in uniform
whiteness, uninterrupted except for the dark green of a pine-tree or the lighter green
of some bamboos here and there in the distance. He felt as if he was standing in the
middle of a great glittering crystal bowl. Proceeding on his way, he had just turned a
spur in the miniature mountain whose foot he was skirting, when his senses were
suddenly ravished by a delicate cold fragrance. On looking around him, he found it to
be coming from the dozen or so trees of winter-flowering red plum growing inside
the walls of Green Bower Hermitage where the nun Adamantina lived. The brilliance
of their carmine hue against the white background and the bravura of their
blossoming amidst the snow so enchanted him that he stopped for some minutes to
admire them.
As he moved on again, he saw someone carrying a green oiled-silk umbrella crossing
over Wasp Waist Bridge. It was one of Li Wan’s servants on her way to invite Xi-feng
to the party.
Arriving at Snowy Rushes Retreat, be found several women-servants outside,
sweeping a pathway up to the door.
Snowy Rushes Retreat was built at the water’s margin in the shelter of a little hill. It
had a thatched roof and adobe walls and a post-and-bar fence round it and
bamboo-barred windows, just like a farmhouse or a peasant’s cottage. By merely
opening a casement and leaning out, it was possible to fish in the lake from its rear
windows. Reeds and rushes grew all around it. A meandering pathway through them
led to the bamboo bridge by which Lotus Pavilion could be approached from the
back.
When the snow-sweepers caught sight of Bao-yu in his rain hat and cape, they
paused from their labours and laughed.
‘We were just saying a moment ago that all we need now is an old fisherman, and
here he comes! You’re too impatient, Master: the young ladies won’t be coming until
they’ve eaten.’
Hearing that, there was nothing for Bao-yu to do but go back again.
Looking out from Drenched Blossoms Pavilion while he was crossing over the bridge,
he caught sight of his sister Tan-chun emerging from Autumn Studio. She was
wearing a dark-red camlet cloak and Guanyin hood and leaning on the arm of a little
maid. A woman-servant walked behind her carrying a green oiled-silk umbrella.
Realizing that she must be on her way to see Grandmother Jia, Bao-yu waited by the
pavilion for her to catch up with him and accompanied her out of the Garden.
When they arrived, Bao-qin was still at her toilet in the inner room. The other cousins
joined them shortly after. Bao-yu kept telling everyone how hungry he felt and
grumbling because the servants were so long in serving. When the food at last
arrived, the first dish to be put on the table was unborn lamb stewed in milk.
‘That’s a health food,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s for old folk like me. I’m afraid you
young people couldn’t eat it. It’s a creature that’s never seen the light. There’s some
fresh venison today, though. Why don’t you wait and have some of that?’
The others agreed to wait, but Bao-yu professed himself unable to hold out, and
helping himself to a bowl of plain boiled rice, poured a little tea over it and shovelled
it straight from the bowl into his mouth with one or two collops of pickled
pheasant-meat to help it down.
‘I know you’ve got something on today,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That’s why you’ve
no time to eat properly.’ She turned to the servants. ‘Save some of the venison for
them to eat in the evening.’
‘There’s plenty more,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve already spoken to them about it.’
Xiang-yun had a brief consultation on the subject with Bao-yu:
‘If they’ve got fresh venison, why don’t we ask for a piece and cook it ourselves in
the Garden? That would be fun.’
Bao-yu eagerly took up her suggestion and begged a piece from Xi-feng. He got one
of the women to take it into the Garden for them.
Presently, when they had all left Grandmother Jia’s place and reassembled in Snowy
Rushes Retreat an-d were waiting to hear what themes and rhymes Li Wan had
decided on, they noticed that Xiang-yun and Bao-yu were missing.
‘Those two should never be allowed together,’ said Dai-yu. ‘As soon as ever they get
together there is some kind of mischief afoot. No doubt the reason they’ve gone off
this time is because they have designs on that deer’s meat.’
Just then Li Wan’s aunt, Mrs Li, came in, drawn by the noise and numbers to see
what was happening.
‘That boy with the jade and the girl with the gold kylin,’ she said to Li Wan anxiously,
‘they both seem such clean, well-bred children, and they look as if they had enough
to eat, yet just now the two of them were discussing how to eat a piece of raw
venison. They seemed to he quite serious about it, too. Can one eat venison raw? I
find it hard to believe that it can be very good for you.’
‘Shocking I’ exclaimed the others. ‘Better go out and stop them.’
‘Yun is at the bottom of this,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Mark my words!’
Li Wan hurried off to find the culprits.
‘If you are proposing to eat raw meat,’ she said when she had found them, ‘I shall
have to send you back to Grandma’s to do it there. You can take a whole deer and
stuff yourselves sick on it as long as it’s not my responsibility. Come on, now! Come
back and make verses with the rest of us. Out in all this snow—it’s much too cold!’
‘You’re absolutely mistaken,’ said Bao-yu, laughing. ‘We’re planning to roast it.’
‘Oh well’ said Li Wan, ‘that’s different.’
Some old women arrived just then, carrying an iron stove, some metal skewers and a
grill.
‘Now be careful about cutting that meat,’ said Li Wan. ‘If you cut your fingers, you’ll
have nobody to blame but yourselves I’
Having uttered that warning, she went indoors again.
Not long after she had gone in, Patience came by on her way to the Retreat. Xi-feng
had sent her, in response to Li Wan’s invitation, to explain that she was unable to join
them because she was busy seeing to the various annual payments that fall due at
this time of year. Xiang-yun stopped her to exchange greetings, and having once
stopped her, was unwill?ing to let her go again. Patience was by nature a fun-loving
girl and she knew that Xi-feng would generally let her do as she liked. Considering the
idea of cooking outdoors a great lark, she entered into the spirit of the thing, and
taking off her bracelets, joined the other two round the brazier and asked for three of
the cut-up pieces of venison to roast.
Bao-chai and Dai-yu had seen this kind of thing before and were not particularly
interested, but it was a novelty to Mrs Li and Bao-qin and the newcomers, and they
were greatly intrigued.
‘What a lovely smell!’ said Tan-chun, when she and Li Wan had finished discussing
the theme for the verse-making. ‘You can smell it from here. I’m going outside to
have some.’
She went out to join the three around the brazier. Li Wan followed her.
‘Everyone’s ready and waiting,’ said Li Wan. ‘Haven’t you two finished eating yet?’
‘I need wine to inspire my verse,’ said Xiang-yun, speaking with a mouth full of
venison, ‘and eating roast venison gives me a thirst for wine. So if I didn’t eat this
venison, I shouldn’t be able to write any poetry for you.’
She caught sight of Bao-qin, in the beautiful drake’s head cloak that Caltrop had
thought was made of peacock’s feathers, hanging back somewhat from the rest and
smiling wistfully.
‘Thoppy!’ she called out to her. ‘Come and try thome!’
‘Too dirty!’ said Bao-qin.
‘Go and try some,’ Bao-chai urged her. ‘It’s very good. The only reason your Cousin
Lin isn’t having any is because she’s delicate and can’t digest it. If it weren’t for that,
she would love to have some herself.’
Hearing this, Bao-qin went over and nibbled a bit, and finding it good, began to tuck
in with as much gusto as the rest.
Presently a little maid arrived from Xi-feng summoning Patience to return; but
Patience told the girl to go back without her and tell her mistress that she was being
detained by Miss Shi. Shortly after the maid’s departure Xi-feng herself arrived, with
a rain-cape over her shoulders.
‘This looks good,’ she said jovially. ‘You might have told me!’
With that she joined the other five in their alfresco feast round the brazier
‘You look like a party of down-and-outs,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Oh dear, oh dear! Poor Snowy
Rushes Retreat, polluted by Butcher Yun and her reeking carnivores! I weep for you!’
‘What do you know about it?’ said Xiang-yun scornfully. ‘“True wits make elegant
whate’er they touch.” Yours is a false purity. Odious purity! Now we may reek and
raven; but presently you will see us with the pure spirit of poetry in our breasts and
the most delicate, silken phrases On our lips!’
‘You’d better see to it that the verses you make are good ones,’ said Bao-chai,
laughing, ‘otherwise we shall make you expiate the pollution by plucking the venison
from your in?sides and stuffing you with snowy rushes!’
They had now made an end of eating, and washed their hands. In putting on her
bracelets again, Patience noticed that one of them was missing; but though she and
the others looked all around them, they were unable to find it. They were still
puzzling over its disappearance when Xi-feng smilingly put an end to the search:
‘I know where the bracelet’s gone. You others go in and get on with your poetry.’
‘There’s no need to look for it any longer,’ she told Patience. ‘You will have to go
home without it; but I promise that within three days from now you shall have it
back again.’
‘What are your poems to be about this time ?’ she asked the cousins. ‘Grandma
says that as it’s getting near the end of the year, we shall soon be needing some First
Month lantern riddles.’
‘Ah yes, of course!’ they said. ‘We’d quite forgotten, We’d better make some good
ones up in advance to have ready for the festival.’
During this exchange they had been trooping into the room in the Retreat which had
the under-floor heating. Wine-cups and prepared dishes had been laid there in
readiness by the servants. A paper stuck to the wall announced the theme, form and
rhyme for the forthcoming poetry contest. Bao-yu and Xiang-yun, who had not yet
seen it, quickly went over to look. This is what it said:

             Theme: The Snow
             Form:  Linked Pentameters
             Rhyme: Eyes

No order of composition had been indicated.
‘I’m not much good at poetry myself,’ said Li Wan, ‘so I shall merely start you off by
giving you the first three lines. After that, whoever is the first to think of a good
following line can carry on.’
‘I think we ought to have a fixed order,’ said Bao-chai. As to whether or not her
advice was taken, that will be made clear in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 50

Linked verses in Snowy Rushes Retreat
And lantern riddles in the Spring In Winter Room



‘I THINK We ought to have a fixed order,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Just let me write the names
down and we can decide what it is to be by lot.’
When she had written down their names and torn up the paper, the slips were drawn
and she copied them down in the order in which they came out. Li Wan, by
coincidence, re?tained the first place.
‘If this is what you are doing,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I may as well contribute a line of my
own to start you off with.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said the others. ‘Please do!’
Bao-chai added the name ‘ Feng’ to the list, above that of ‘Farmer Sweet-rice’, while
Li Wan explained what the subject was and what sort of line it had to be. Xi-feng
listened attentively and thought for some moments before speaking.
‘You mustn’t laugh if this sounds a bit unpolished,’ she said at last, ‘but at least I
think it’s the right length. Mind you, I’ve no idea how it could go on.’
‘Never mind how unpolished it is,’ they said. ‘just tell us what it is; then you can
leave, if you want to, and get on with your own work.’
‘Well, when it snows, there’s always a north wind,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and last night I
could hear the north wind blowing all night long; so I’ve made a line up about that:

             Last night the north wind blew the whole night through.

There you are—take it or leave it!’
The others ‘looked at each other in pleased surprise.
‘Even if the language of this line is a bit unpolished and you can’t see what’s going
to follow it, it’s exactly the kind of line that a skilled poet would begin with. Not only
is the line good in itself, but it leaves so many possibilities open to the person who
follows. Put that down for our first line then, Sweet-rice, and you can finish the
couplet.’
Before they proceeded any further, however, Xi-feng, Mrs Li and Patience drank two
cups of wine with them, after which they left. As soon as they had gone, Li Wan
wrote out the line that Xi-feng had given them, adding a line of her own to make it
into a couplet and a third line after that to make the beginning of a second couplet.
Thereafter, as each of them in turn completed the couplet started by the previous
person and then added the first line of another couplet, she continued to write down
the lines at their dictation:
XI-FENG:
Last night the north wind blew the whole night through—
LI WAN:
Today outside my door the snow still flies.
On mud and dirt its pure white flakes fall down—
CALTROP:
And powdered jade the whole earth beautifies.
Flakes on the dead plants weave a winter dress—
TAN-CHUN:
And on dry grasses gemlike crystallize.
Now will the farmer’s brew a good puce fetch—
LI QI
His full barn to a good year testifies.
The ash-filled gauge shows winter’s solstice near—
LI WEN:
And the Wain turns as Yang revivifies.
Snow robs the cold bills of their emerald hue—
XIU-YAN:
And frost the river’s motion petrifies.
Snow settles thickly on sparse willow boughs—
XIANG-YUN:
But on dead plantain-leaves less easy lies.
Now perfumed coals in precious braziers burn—
BAO-QIN:
And heavy furs the girls’ slim shapes disguise.
Firelight the mirror by the window catches—
DAI-YU:
And burning nard the chamber purifies.
Still sobbing through the night the mournful wind—
BAO-YU:
Each sleeper’s dreams with sadness sanctifies.
Somewhere a melancholy flute is playing—
BAO-CHAI:
Whose sad notes with the wind’s plaint harmonize.
With groans the Earth Turtle sideways shifts his load—

At this point Li Wan laid down her brush and rose to her feet.
‘I think I’ll just slip out and see about getting some more wine heated. Someone
else can take my place.’
Ban-chai took up the writing-brush and called on Bao-qin to complete the couplet;
but before she could do so, Xiang-?yun had leapt to her feet with two lines of her
own:

XIANG-YUN:
As dragons brawl, the cloud-wrack liquefies.
A lone boat from the lonely shore puts out—
Nothing daunted, Bao-qin completed that couplet instead:

DAO-QIN:
While from the bridge a horseman waves good-byes.
Now warm clothes to the frontier are dispatched—
Xiang-yun would yield to no one; and her invention was so much quicker than
anyone else’s, that they were content to let her break the order, and watched with
amusement as she returned now, exulting, to the attack:

XIANG-YUN:
And wives to distant dear ones send supplies.
On still untrodden ways masked pitfalls threaten—
‘That’s a good line!’ said Bao-chai admiringly as she wrote down what Xiang-yun
had recited; and she followed with two lines of her own:

BAO-CHAI:
In snowbound woods a bough’s creak terrifies.
The wind-blown snow around the traveller whirls—
Dai-yu hurriedly followed:

DAI-YU:
And clouds of powdery snow at each step rise.
Steamed taros makes a good snow-party fare—
She nudged Bao-yu to follow: but Bao-yu was so absorbed in watching the contest
that seemed to be developing between Xiang-yun on the one hand and Bao-qin,
Bao-chai and Dai-yu on the other, that he was failing to think up lines of his own to
follow their half-couplets with. He did the best he could, how?ever, in response to
Dai-yu’s nudge:

BAO--YU:
The guests on ‘scattered salt’ themes improvise.
Now is the woodman’s axe no longer heard—
Clear off, you—you’re no good!’ said Xiang-yun, laugh?ing. ‘All you’re doing is getting
in other people’s way!’
Her pausing to say this gave Bao-qin an opportunity of cut?ting in:

BAO-QIN:
Yet still his rod the straw-clad fisher plies.
Mountains like sleeping elephants appear—

Xiang-yun hurried back into the fray:

XIANG-YUN:
A snake-like path the climber’s skill defies.
After long cold the trees strange frost-fruits bear—

This evoked admiring murmurs from Bao-chai and the rest.
Tan-chun managed to get in a contribution at this point:

TAN-HUN:
Which, bold in beauty, winter’s blasts despise.
The hushed yard startles to a cold chough’s chatter—

Xiang-yun was ready at once with two lines to follow, but as she was feeling thirsty,
she first stopped to gulp down some tea. In doing so, she lost her turn to Xiu-yan:

XIU-YAN:
An old owl wakes the vale with mournful cries.
The driving flakes make angles disappear—

Xiang-yun put down her teacup in a hurry, before more ground could be lost:

XIAN-G-YUN:
But dimples on -the water’s face incise.
In the clear morn how radiant gleams the snow!—

Dai-yu followed:
DAI-YU:
How ghostly, as the too short daylight dies!
Its cold the Chengs’ disciples could withstand—

Xiang-yun laughed excitedly as she hurried to complete the couplet:

XIANG-YUN:
Its promise can a king’s cares exorcise.
Who’d lie abed all stiff with cold indoors—

Bao-qin laughed, too, as she followed:

BAO-QIN:
When friends invite to red-cheeked exercise?
Who o’er the land the menfolk’s silk unrolls—?

Xiang-yun quickly capped this:

XIANG-YUN:
Who the white weft from Heaven’s loom unties?

But before she could begin another couplet, Dai-yu slipped in a line of her own:

DAI-YU:
Tall tiled pavilions cold and-empty stand—

Xiang-yun capped it:

XIANG-YUN:
Snug thatch more favour finds in poor men’s eyes.

Bao-qin, concluding that this was now a free-for-all, -cut in with the next half couplet:

BAO-QIN:
Ice lumps we thaw and boil to make our tea Xiang-yun, having evidently thought of
something amus?ing, began to giggle:

XIANG-YUN:
The fuel being damp, they greatly tantalize.

Dai-yu began to giggle too:

DAI-Y-U:
The Zen recluse with non-broom sweeps the ground—

The infection of giggles had now reached Bao-qin:

BAO-QIN:
His stringless lute-play still more mystifies.

Xiang-yun was by now so doubled up with laughter that the others could not make
out the words of her next line.
‘What? ‘they asked her. ‘What was that you said?’ Xiang-yun had to repeat it:

XIANG-YUN:
On the stone tower a stork unwatchful sleeps—

Dai-yu was laughing so much that -she had to clutch painfully at her chest and the
words she recited came out in a laughing shout:

DAI-YU:
On the warm mat a cat contented sighs.

All the lines that followed were uttered in rapid succession and to the
accompaniment of much laughter.

BAO-QIN:
In moonlit caves the silvery water laps—

XIANG-YUN:
And red flags flutter against sunset skies.

DAI-YU:
Soaked winter plums make the breath fresh and sweet—


‘That’s a good line,’ said Bao-chai. She capped it herself:
BAO-CHAI:
And melted snow the wine-fumes neutralize.

BAO-QIN:
The stiffened aigrette gradually thaws—

XIANG-YUN:
The snow-soaked silken girdle slowly dries.

DAI-YU:
The wind has dropped, but snow still wetly falls—

Bao-qin capped this, laughing:

BAO-QIN:
And frequent drips the passer-by baptize.

Xiang-yun had collapsed, weak with laughing, upon Bao-chai’s shoulder. The others
had long since given up trying to participate and become mere laughing spectators of
the three-cornered contest between Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-qin. Dai-yu urged
Xiang-yun to go on.
‘Don’t tell me you’ve run out of inspiration—! Surely your famous gift of the gab is
still good for a few more lines?’
Bao-chai prodded Xiang-yun, who was now laughing help?lessly upon her lap.
‘See if you can exhaust the rhyme, Yun. If you can do that, I shall be really
impressed.’
‘This isn’t verse-making,’ said Xiang-yun, raising her head from Bao-chai’s lap, it’s
more like a duel to the death!’
‘Well, whose fault is that?’ they asked her, laughing.
Tan-chun, having decided that she would be unlikely to make any further
contributions herself had some time before this taken over the task of amanuensis
from Bao-chai. She now pointed out -that the poem needed finishing off. Li Wan,
who had just arrived back, took the paper from her and embarked on a suitable
finishing couplet:

LI WAN:
Our verses shall this happy day record—
Her cousin Li Qi completed it:

LI QI
And a wise Emperor loyally eulogize.


‘Now that’s enough;’ said Li Wan. ‘We still haven’t exhausted the rhyme, but if we
go on any longer, we shall be tying ourselves up in knots trying to use words that
aren’t really suitable.’
They now went over the whole poem from beginning to end and discussed it all in
detail. It appeared that Xiang-yun had contributed far mote lines than anyone else.
The others laughed.
‘It’s because of all that venison you ate!’
‘ If we consider quality rather than quantity,’ said Li Wan, ‘I think all the
contributions are of about equal merit. Except Bao-yu’s, of course. He goes to the
bottom of the list, as usual.’
‘I can’t do Linked Verses, anyway,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You have to make allowances for
me.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Li Wan, smiling, ‘but we can’t make allowances for you at
every single meeting. One time you’re in trouble because we have fixed rhymes,
another time you fail to turn up altogether, and this time you tell us you “can’t do
Linked Verses “I think this time there really has to be a penalty. I noticed just now
that the red plum in Green Bower Hermitage is very fine. I’d like to have broken off a
branch to put in a vase, but I find Adamantina such a difficult person that I prefer not
to have anything to do with her. The first part of your punishment shall be to get us a
branch of that red plum and put it in a vase here where all of us can admire it.’
‘What a delightful penalty!’ said the others. ‘How civil?ized!’
Bao-yu, too, was delighted with the penalty, but just as he was setting off to perform
it, Xiang-yun and Dai-yu simul?taneously rose to their feet and detained him.
‘It’s very, very cold outside. Have a cup of hot wine before you go.’
Xiang-yun already had the wine-kettle in her hand. Dai-yu found an extra large cup
for her to pour the wine in.
‘There!’ said Xiang-yun, filling it up to the brim. ‘If you come back empty-handed
now, after drinking our wine, we shall double the rest of your penalty when you get
back!’
Bao-yu quickly drank down the proffered cup of freshly heated wine and walked out
into the snow. Li Wan wanted to send a servant out after him, but Dai-yu intervened.
‘I wouldn’t, if I were you. If he has anyone else with him, he won’t be able to get
any.’
Knowing Adamantina, Li Wan reflected that this was probably true and nodded. She
sent the maids to fetch a large mei?ping vase with wide shoulders and a very narrow
neck to put the plum-blossom in when it arrived.
‘When he comes back, we must compose some red plum poems,’ she said.
‘I can do one now,’ said Bao-qin.
‘Oh no!’ said Bao-chai. ‘We’re not letting yon do any more. You’ve already hogged
enough turns for today. It’s no fun for the others if they are left with nothing to do.
No, it’s Bao-yu’s penalty we’ve got to think about, He said just now that he can’t do
Linked Verses. When he comes back we ought to make him do some other kind of
verses for us by himself.’
‘Good ideal’ said Dai-yu. ‘And I’ve got another idea. Several people didn’t get
sufficient opportunity in the Linked Verses of showing what they can do. I propose
that those who contributed least in the Linked Verses should be given the red plum
poems to do?
‘Yes, I agree,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Xing, Cousin Wen and Cousin Qi were
practically crowded out altogether—and they are, after all, our guests. Qin and Yun
and you, Frowner, hogged nearly all the turns. This time the rest of us ought to keep
out of it and let Cousin Xing and Cousin Wen and Cousin Qi have the floor to
themselves.’
‘Qi isn’t very good at making verses,’ said Li Wan. ‘I think you’d better give her place
to your cousin Bao-qin.’
This was scarcely what Bao-chai had intended, but she felt herself in no position to
dissent.
‘Why don’t we use the words “red plum flower” as rhymes?’ she suggested. ‘Each
of the three can do an octet on “Red Plum Flower”, but Cousin Xing can use “red” for
her rhyme, Cousin Wen can use “plum” for hers, and Qin can use flower”.’
‘We seem to be letting off Bao-yu,’ said Li Wan. ‘I can’t agree to that.’
‘Give him a separate theme,’ Xiang-yun suggested.
‘What theme shall we give him?’ the others asked.
‘What about “On Visiting the Nun Adamantina with a Request for Red Plum
blossom”?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘That might be interesting.’
‘Oh yes!’ said the others. ‘That would do splendidly.’
At that very moment the object of their discussion walked in, smiling triumphantly,
with a flowering plum-branch in his hand. The maids at once relieved him of it and
put it in the waiting vase, while the cousins crowded round them to admire it.
‘I hope you enjoy it, all -of you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It took me enough trouble to get!’
Tan-chun handed him a cup of hot wine to revive him; but first the maids removed
his cape and rain hat and shook the snow off them.
Maids from several different apartments now began arriving with extra-clothing for
their mistresses. Bao-yu’s Aroma sent him an old surtout lined with fox’s belly-fur. Li
Wan made the
servants fill three dishes, one with extra large steamed taros, the other two with
blood-oranges, yellow Canton oranges and olives, to take back to her.
Xiang-yun now told Bao-yu the title of the poem they wanted him to compose and
urged him to begin thinking a bout it.
‘I will,’ said Bao-yu; ‘but there’s just one thing I would ask of you all: please let me
use my own rhymes ; please don’t make me do it to set rhymes.’
‘All right,’ said the girls. ‘Use whatever rhymes you like.’ They had been admiring
the plum-blossom meanwhile. The vertical part of the branch—the part, that is,
which was stuck into the neck of the vase—must have been less than two feet high;
but growing at right-angles from the top of it was a side branch which rose and fell in
a spreading cascade of blossom all of four feet long. Of the branchlets forming this
flowery cascade

some were like writhing serpents,
some were like frozen worms;
some were as straight and smooth as a writing-brush,
some were as densely twigged as a tiny coppice.

As for the blossoms, they had

A colour like the rosy lips of love
And scent that made summer’s scents seem uninviting.

While the others-were studying the blossoming branch and praising its beauties, Xing
Xiu-yan, Li Wen and Bao-qin were busy composing their poems about it and
presently began writing them out for the others to inspect.
This is what the others were now able to read:

On a Branch of Red Plum Flower

I
Rhyming ‘red’                                   By Xing Xiu-yan

So brave, so gay they bloom in winter’s cold,
Before the fragrant peach and almond red;
Like rosy clouds that clothe the springtime slopes
Of Yu-ling, where my dream-soul oft has sped.
Each little lamp in its green calyx lies
Like drunken snow-sprite on a rainbow bed.
Yet do these flowers, of hue so rich and rare,
Reckless, in ice and snow their charms outspread.

II
Rhyming ‘plum’                          By Li Wen
What richness blooms before my drunken eyes?
’Tis not the white I sing, but the red plum.
See, its pale cheeks are streaked with blood-red tears,
Even though its bitter heart with cold is numb.
No flower this, but a fairy maid transformed
And here transplanted from Elysium
In this bleak North it makes such brave display,
I’ll tell the bees that spring’s already come.

III
Rhyming ‘flower’          By Xue Bao-qin

Like spendthrift youths in spring’s new fashions dressed,
Its bare thin branches burst in glorious flower.
Snow no more falls, but a bright rosy cloud
Tints hills and streams in one long sunset hour.
Through this red flood my dream-boat makes its way,
While flutes sound chill from many a maiden’s bower.
Sure from no earthly stock this beauty came,
But trees immortal round the Fairy Tower.

They read these poems with smiles of pleasure. There were words of praise for all
three of them; but Bao-qin’s, they finally agreed, was the best of the three. Bao-yu,
realizing that she was the youngest present, was greatly impressed. Dai-yu and
Xiang-yun between them poured out a tiny cupful of wine and offered it to her in
celebration of her victory.
‘All three were equally good,’ Bao-chai deprecatingly.
‘It was you two who in the past were always fooling me that poems were the best.
Now, it appears, you’ve found someone else to fool.’
‘What about you?’ Li Wan asked Bao-yu. ‘Is yours ready yet?’
‘I did have one ready,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but these three are so much better that reading
them has made me nervous and put it completely out of my mind. You’ll have to give
me a bit longer while I think up another.’
Xiang-yun picked up one of a pair of large bronze chop?sticks used as tongs for
feeding the stove with and beat a preliminary tattoo with it on her metal
hand-warmer.
‘I’ll drum for you;’ she said ‘If you can’t produce something each time the
drumming stops, we’ll double your penalty.’
‘I think I’ve got something,’ said Bao-yu. Dai-yu picked up a writing-brush, ‘I’ll write
it down for you while you recite it,’ she said. Xiang-yun struck up a tattoo.
‘Right!’ she said presently, as she stopped her drumming. ‘End of first round.’
‘Yes, I’ve got something,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Get ready to write.’

             ‘Wine not yet broached nor verses yet composed—’

Dai-yu wrote down the words, shaking her head as she did so.
‘That’s a very indifferent beginning.’
‘Come on!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Hurry!’ Bao-yu continued:

        ‘In quest of spring I sped to Elysium—

Dai-yu and Xiang-yun nodded.
‘Hmn. Not bad.’
Bao-yu went on:

             “Twas not the balm from Guanyin’s vase I craved
             Across that threshold, but her flowering plum—,

Dai-yu -shook her bead again as she wrote this down.
‘That’s a bit contrived, isn’t it?’
Xiang--yun began-another tattoo on the hand-warmer. When she finished, Bao-yu
continued at once:


‘A frozen worldling, for red flowers I begged;
The saint cut fragrant clouds and gave me some.
Pity my verse so angular and thin,
For convent snow has soaked it to the skin!’

As soon as Dai-yu had finished writing this down, Xiang-?yan and the rest began a
critical discussion of the whole poem. They were till in the midst of this when a little
maid dashed in to announce that Grandmother Jia was approaching. Bao-yu and the
girls hurried out, laughing and chattering, to welcome her.
‘She must be feeling in good spirits,’ they said, ‘to come out in the snow like this.’
Grandmother Jia was still quite a way off when they saw her. She was sitting in a little
bamboo carrying-chair and holding a green silk umbrella over herself. A large cape
and squirrel-lined hood almost completely enveloped her. Faithful, Amber and three
or four other maids, all carrying their own umbrellas, formed a little escort around
the chair and its bearers. Li Wan and the others would have gone out into the snow
to meet her, but Grandmother Jia called out to them to stay where they were.
‘Wait there under cover. I’ll come over to you..’
‘ I’ve given Feng and your Aunt Wang the slip,’ she told them, chuckling
mischievously, when the chair had reached them and they were helping her out of it.
It’s all right for me, going out in all this snow, because I’m sitting in this thing; but I
didn’t want them trudging along in the snow beside me, get?ting cold and miserable.’
Some of them relieved her of her snow-clothes while others supported her on either
-side and conducted her into the room where the heated kang was.
‘What pretty plum-blossom!’ she said as they entered it. ‘You children certainly
know bow to enjoy yourselves. I feel quite angry with you for not inviting me!’
Li Wan made the servants bring in a big wolfskin rug and spread it out in the middle
of the kang for Grandmother Jia to sit on.
‘Now you just all go on enjoying yourselves exactly as you were before I came,’ said
the old lady when she had settled herself on the rug. ‘I daren’t sleep after lunch at
this time of year, because the days are so short. I had a little game of dominoes
instead; then I started wondering what you were all up to and thought I would come
over and join you.’
Li Wan handed her a hand-warmer while Tan-chun fetched a winecup and a pair of
chopsticks, poured out a cup of warm wine, and offered it to her with both her hands.
Grandmother Jia accepted it from her and sipped the wine.
‘What have you got in that dish over there?’ she asked them.
‘Pickled quails,’ said one of the cousins, bringing the dish over for her inspection.
‘That will do very nicely,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tear off a little leg for me, will
you?’
Li Wan called for water, and having first washed her hands, performed the operation
for her in person.
‘Now I want you all to sit down again and go on talking,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It
does me good to hear you. —You too,’ she said to Li Wan. ‘You’re to sit down as well.
I want you to behave exactly as if I hadn’t come. Otherwise I shall go away again.’
At this the others resumed their former places—all except bearers turned into this
and put the chair down just inside it for Grandmother Jia to get out. Xi-chun was
already waiting there to welcome her and conducted them all through the covered
way which ran round the sides of the courtyard from the gateway to her living
quarters at the back. A framed board hanging underneath the eaves announced the
name of the building:

SPRING IN WINTER.



Servants held up the red felt portiere for them as they approached its doorway. They
could feel the hot air fanning their cheeks as they entered it.
Grandmother Jia tackled Xi-chun as soon as they were in?side, not even waiting to sit
down.
‘What’s happened to the painting?’
‘The glue gets tacky in this cold weather,’ said Xi-chun. ‘It stops the paint from going
on properly. I’ve put the painting away because I was afraid it might get spoiled.’
Grandmother Jia brushed aside this excuse with a dis?missive laugh.
‘I want that painting ready by the end of the year. Don’t be so lazy! Fetch it out at
once and get on with it, my girl!’
Just then a smiling Xi-feng made her appearance. A purplish woollen gabardine was
thrown loosely over her shoulders.
‘You’ve led me a fine dance,’ she grumbled, ‘sneaking off on your own like this!’
The old lady was delighted to see her.
‘I didn’t want you all catching colds; that’s why I told them not to let you know I
was going out. I suppose I ought to have realized that that sharp little nose of yours
would soon ferret me out again. You mustn’t think you are being dutiful in tracking
me down like this.’
‘Being dutiful!’ said Xi-feng. ‘That’s not at all the reason why I came out to look for
you. Just now when I went round to your apartment I found it all deathly quiet, and it
was quite clear from the maids’ answers, when I tried to find out where you had
gone, that they didn’t want me to go into the Garden to look for you. That aroused
my suspicions; and when a moment later a couple of nuns appeared on the scene,
my suspicions were confirmed: I realized that they must have come to make their
annual collection for some charity or other and that my dear, saintly Grannie, who no
doubt has rather a lot of subscriptions to pay out at this time of year, had gone into
hiding to avoid them. I asked the nuns, and sure enough it was for your annual
subscription that they had come. I paid it for you myself. So now your creditors have
gone, you can come out of hiding. You ought to be getting back now in any case.
You’ve got some nice, tender pheasant for dinner and if you leave it much longer it
will spoil.’
All this was spoken, of course, to the accompaniment of much laughter from the
others. Before Grandmother Jia could say anything in reply, Xi-feng had ordered the
bearers to bring up the bamboo carrying-chair and Grandmother Jia, in laughing
acquiescence, took Xi-feng’s hand, got back into it, and was at once lifted up and
whisked away by the bearers. The others followed after, chattering and laughing as
they went.
As they emerged from the east end of the alley-way into the silvery snowscape of the
Garden, they could see Bao-qin, identifiable by the glossy green mallard-cape,
standing a long way off behind the shoulder of a little hill, waiting for the rest of
them to arrive. A maid, hugging a large vase with a branch of red plum in it, was
standing behind her.
‘So there she is!’ said the others. ‘We thought there seemed to be two of us
missing. And she’s got herself some plum ?blossom, as well.’
Grandmother Jia smiled proprietorially at the distant figure.
‘What does that remind you all of, seeing her there on that snowy bank, wearing a
cape like that and with the spray of plum-blossom behind her?’
‘Why,’ they said, ‘it’s like that painting by Qiu Ying you have hanging in your room:
“The Beauty of the Snow”.’
Grandmother Jia shook her head.
‘No, the girl in that picture isn’t wearing a cape like that—and she isn’t half as
pretty as Qin, either.’
Just at that moment a third figure, previously invisible, stepped out from behind
Bao-qin’s back. Whoever it was was wearing a red felt snow-cape.
‘Which of the girls is that?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘There aren’t any more girls; we’re all here,’ said the others laughing. ‘That’s
Bao-yu.’
‘My eyes are getting worse and worse,’ said Grandmother Jia. Soon they had caught
up with the three figures on the hill and she could see that it was indeed Bao-yu
whom she had failed to recognize with Bao-qin and the maid.
‘ I’ve been over to Green Bower Hermitage again,’ Bao-yu told the girls.
‘Adamantina ended up by giving me a branch of plum-blossom for each of you. I’ve
just been arranging to have them delivered to your rooms.’
The others thanked him for his kindness.
Talking as they went, they presently passed through the gate of the Garden and
accompanied Grandmother Jia back to her apartment. After dinner, while they were
still sitting there in conversation, Aunt Xue arrived.
‘What a heavy fall of snow!’ she said. ‘I haven’t been able to come over and see
you all day long. You ought to go out and have a look at it, Lady Jia, if you are feeling
low. It would do you good.’
‘Who said I was feeling low?’ said Grandmother Jia with some amusement. ‘I’ve
only just got back from visiting the children. I’ve been having a fine old time!’
‘Oh?’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Yesterday evening I was intending to ask if my sister and I
could have the use of the Garden today so that we might arrange a little
snow-viewing party for you, but you’d already gone to bed, and Bao-chai said that
you were feeling out of Sorts, so I thought I’d better not bother you. If I’d known
differently, I’d have come round this morning and invited you.’
‘We’re only just into the eleventh month,’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘There’ll be
plenty more snow yet and plenty more opportunities for taking advantage of your
kind offer.’
‘I do hope so,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘It’s something I should very much like to do for you.’
‘Isn’t there a danger you might forget, Aunt?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not weigh out fifty
taels now and leave them with me? Then next time it snows, I can get it all ready for
you. That would save you the trouble of arranging it yourself and also avoid the
danger of your forgetting.’
‘In that case you and I might just as well split the money between us,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘Next time it snows, all I have to do is say that I’m feeling out of
sorts, and you won’t have to do anything at all. That way Mrs Xue will have even less
trouble, while you and I will each of us have twenty-five taels cleat profit.’
Xi-feng clapped her hands delightedly.
‘What a wonderful idea! Why didn’t I think of it myself?’
The others laughed.
‘Shameless hussy!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing with the rest. ‘You’re-like the
monkey on the pole: give you an inch and you take an ell. What you ought to have
said is: “No, Aunt, you are our guest Since you honour us by staying in our house, it is
we who should be inviting you. We can’t allow you to go spending money on us.”
That’s what you ought to have said; not asked your poor aunt for fifty taels. Whoever
heard of such a thing!’
‘She’s a canny old lady, this Grandma of ours,’ Xi-feng explained to Aunt Xue. ‘She
watches you first to see if you’ll weaken or not. If you’d weakened and coughed up
the fifty taels, she’d have been quite willing to go halves with me and pocket
twenty-five of them herself; but having gauged that you probably won’t, she adopts a
holier-than-thou attitude and makes an example of me, even though she was the one
who suggested it. All right, all right. I’ll pay for the whole party myself, and when
Grandma arrives, I’ll have fifty taels out of my own savings wrapped up all ready to
give her as a present. That shall be my punishment for having opened my big mouth
and occupied myself with other people’s affairs.’
Bao-yu and the girls were by this time rolling about on the kang.
Presently, when the conversation got round to what a beautiful picture Bao-qin had
made standing in the snow with the spray of plum-blossom behind her, Grandmother
Jia began inquiring about her parentage and the exact day and hour of her birth.
Aunt Xue guessed that she was considering her as a possible match for Bao-yu. She
would have been glad enough to go along with this had not Bao-qin already been
promised to the Meis; however, since Grandmother Jia had not asked her outright,
she could do no more than hint at a prior attach?ment.
‘She’s been very unlucky, poor child. The year before last her father died quite
suddenly. She used to go with him every-where on his travels, so she has seen a great
deal of the world for one so young. Her father was a great one for combining
business with pleasure. He always took the family with him when he went away on
business. They would spend perhaps a whole year in one province, seeing all the
sights; then the next six months they might spend travelling around in another. At
one time and another they must have covered well over half the provinces of the
Empire in that way. While he was on one of his trips to the capital, he promised her
to Academician Mei’s boy, but unfortunately it was in the year after that he died, so
nothing could be done about it. And now her poor mother has gone down with a
consumption...’
Xi-feng interrupted, sighing and stamping her foot in an exaggerated display of
disappointment.
‘Oh, what a shame! I was just going to offer my services as a match-maker, but it
seems that she’s already betrothed.’
Who did you have in mind?’ Grandmother Jia asked her. ‘Never you mind!’ said
Xi-feng. ‘I’m sure they would have made a very good pair; but since she’s already got
someone else, there doesn’t seem any point in discussing it.’
Grandmother Jia knew very well whom Xi-feng had in mind, but hearing that Bao-qin
was already spoken for, she dropped the subject and made no further mention of it.
The company talked for a while longer before breaking-up; but of the rest of that day
and the night which followed our narrative supplies no account.

*
Next day the snow had cleared. After lunch Grandmother Jia told Xi-chun that, cold
or no cold, she must get on with the painting as quickly as possible.
‘If you really can’t get it finished by the end of the year,’ she said, ‘it doesn’t matter.
But what you must do is get Bao-qin with the maid and the branch of plum-blossom
into it. I want you to do that straight away; and they are to be painted exactly as they
looked when we saw them on that bank yester?day.’
Xi-chun said that she would, though miserably aware that she would find doing so
extremely difficult. Later, when the others went round to her place to see how she
was getting on, she was pondering gloomily over this latest problem. Li Wan
somewhat heartlessly proposed that they should leave her to her own thoughts and
carry on their conversation without her.
‘When we got back from Grandmother’s last night,’ she said, ‘Qi and Wen and I
were unable to get to sleep, so we lay in bed making up riddles. I made up two using
quotations from the Four Books and the other two each made up one.’
‘Ah yes, that’s what we all ought to be doing,’ said the others. ‘Tell us your four first
and we’ll try to guess the answers.
‘Guan-yin lacks a biography,’ said Li Wan. ‘The answer is a phrase from the Four
Books.’
                    ‘Resting in the highest good,’
Xiang-yun promptly suggested.
‘What’s that got to do with “biography”?’ said Bao-chai.
‘Try again,’ said Li Wan.
‘I know,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Isn’t it

             ... though good, yet having no memorial?’


‘Ah yes, that must be it,’ said the others.
‘What is the green plant that grows in the water?’ said Li Wan.
‘That just has to be
                     ‘It is a fast-growing rush,’

said xiang-yun. ‘I don’t see how that ‘could be wrong.’
‘Good for you!’ said Li Wan. ‘Now here is Wen’s riddle:

             Beside the rocks the water runs cold.

It’s the name of an historical person.’
‘That must be “Shan Tao”,’ said Tan-chun. ‘His surname means “mountain”—that’s
the “rocks”—and “Tao” means “billows”
‘Right,’ said Li Wan. ‘Now Qi’s riddle is just a single word:

                       Firefly

The answer is a single- word, too.’
They all puzzled for a long time over this without being able to think of any answer. It
was Bao-qin who finally came up with the solution.
‘Yes, I see. It’s rather involved. The answer is “flower” isn’t it?—I mean the flower
that grows.’
Li Qi acknowledged smilingly that this was correct.
‘What has “flower” got to do with “firefly”?’ the others asked her.
Bao-qin explained:
‘In the Record of Rites it says
              Corrupt grass by transmutation breedeth fireflies.
Now the character for “flower” is written with “grass” at the top and “change”—or, if
you     like,     “transmutation”—under?neath.        So      “corrupt    grass  by
transmutation”—which, accord?ing to the Rites, produces fireflies—makes the
character for “flower
The others laughingly acknowledged that the riddle was an ingenious one.
‘All four of these riddles are very good,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I don’t think they are
quite the sort of thing that Lady Jia had in mind. I think we ought to make up some
about fairly easy, everyday objects, so that those of us who aren’t quite so learned
can enjoy them as well.’
Xiang-yun thought for a bit.
‘I’ve got one,’ she said presently. ‘It’s in the form of a “Ruby Lips” stanza:

             Far away
         From the high fell
         Where I used to dwell
         Amidst men I play.
         But for what gain?
         My labour’s vain;
         My tale is hard to tell.’

No one was able to make out what this could be. After puzzling for a long time, they
produced a number of different guesses. Someone thought it was ‘a monk’; someone
else thought it was ‘a Taoist’; a third person suggested that it might be ‘a marionette
player’.
‘You’re all wrong,’ said Bao-yu, who had been grinning silently to himself while the
others guessed, ‘I’ve thought of the answer. It’s “a performing monkey”.’
‘That’s it” said Xiang-yun.
‘We can understand the first part all right,’ said the others; ‘but what about the last
line? What’s that supposed to mean?’
‘Have you ever seen a performing monkey that hadn’t had its tail docked?’ said
Xiang-yun.
Groans and laughter.
‘Trust Yun’s to have a frightful pun in it—as if the riddle wasn’t hard enough
already!’
‘Mrs Xue was telling us yesterday that you’ve travelled a lot and been to all sorts of
interesting places,’ Li Wan said to Bao-qin. ‘With so much material you ought to be
just the person for making up riddles—especially as you’re so good at verse-making
as well. Why don’t you make up a few, and the rest of us will try to guess them?’
Bao-qin said nothing, but smiled and nodded, and at once went off into a corner to
think.
Bao-chai had now composed a riddle, too, and recited it for them to try and guess
while Bao-qin was doing her thinking.

                 ‘Tier upon compact tier of fragrant wood:
                 No craftsman’s hand could carve one half so well.
                 A gale blows all about the temple’s eaves,
                 Yet, though it shakes, no sound comes from my bell.’

While the others were still trying to guess the answer to this, Bao-yu recited one that
he had just completed himself:

                 ‘’Twixt heaven and earth amidst the clouds so high
             Bamboo gives warning to the passer-by.
             Eyes strain some feathered traveller to descry
                 Who’ll bear my answer back into the sky.’

Dai-yu also had one ready, and proceeded to recite it to them:
             ‘See my little prancing steed!
             Of silken rein he has no need,
             Round the city wall he goes,
            Wreaking havoc on his foes.
            At his master’s touch he moves
            With thunder of advancing hooves.
            In isles by tortoises supported
            His deeds are honourably reported.’
Tan-chun, too had composed a riddle, but as she was on the point of reciting it,
Bao-qin came back from her corner to announce that she had finished.
‘I’ve been visiting places of historical interest ever since I was little,’ she said, ‘so I
really have seen quite a lot. What I’ve done now is to choose ten of them, mostly
associated with some famous person or other, and make up a poem about each one.
The verses themselves may sound rather like doggerel, but the point about them is
that, as well as commemorating these famous places and people, each of them
contains hidden references to some common object which you have to guess.’
‘Ah, that sounds very ingenious!’ they said. ‘But why not write them down, so that
we can take our time thinking about them?’
What happened next will be related in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 51

A clever cousin composes some ingenious riddles
And an unskillful physician prescribes a barbarous remedy

WHEN Bao-qin explained that the riddles she had composed were in the form of
quatrains, each containing a clue to some well-known object, about famous places
she had visited in the course of her travels, the cousins were greatly impressed, and
waited with eagerness for her to copy them out. This is what they read when she had
finished doing so :

Red Cliff
             The river at Red Cliff was choked with the dead,
             And the ships without crew carried naught but their names.
             A clamour and shouting, a wind took the blaze,
             And a host of brave souls rode aloft in the flames.

             He needed no Iron Flute to teach him those arts.

Mt Zhong-shan

           And the call from retirement was none of your choosing,
           You danced in the end at another’s commandment,
           So you can’t be surprised if we find it amusing.

             Your crows and cicadas no more you shall hear
             By the old Sui embankment back home in the South;

             Wags in many an idle, unsavoury mouth.

Peach Leaf Ford
            In the waters a scene of decay is reflected;
            Long since from its bough did the last peach-leaf fall.

Green Mound
          The Amur’s black flood for pure grief is arrested;
          The frozen string twangs with a heartbroken sound;

          A few crooked trees bow in shame to the ground.

            In the clothing she wore lingers on to this day.

The Monastery at Pu-dong
           Young Reddie was ever a light, empty creature,
           Always to-ing and fro-ing in all kinds of weather.
           Though her Mistress in ire hung her up from the ceiling,
           Those two had already been walking together.

            Let not her full moon make you think that Spring’s coming,
            For the cold parts her now till next year from her lover.

After reading these poems, the cousins all praised the re?markable ingenuity with
which they had been constructed. Only Bao-chai was critical:
‘The first eight of these poems have historically verifiable subjects, but what about
the last two? I’m afraid I don’t quite understand what they are about. I think you
ought to make up another two to replace them with.’
‘Don’t be so stuffy, Chai!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Talk about “gluing the bridges of the zither”!
It’s true that the subjects of those last two poems can’t be found in the history books,
but how can you say that you don’t know what they are? Even if, as well-bred young
ladies, we may not read the books in which they are to be found, we’ve all watched
plenty of plays. Every three-year-old child is familiar with these stories. It’s sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that you’ve never heard of them.’
‘Hear, hear!’ said Tan-chun.
‘In any case,’ said Li Wan, ‘she has actually been to the places associated with the
stories, even if the stories them?selves are unhistorical. Stories pick up all kinds of
circum?stantial detail in the course of centuries of re-telling. Sooner or later some
know-all invariably equips them with a location in order to fool more people into
believing them. I remember on my journey here when I first came up to the capital
we visited three or four different sites all claiming to be the burial-place of Guan Yu.
Now no one doubts that Guan Yu actually existed or that he actually did the heroic
things he is supposed to have done; but he can’t have been buried in more than one
grave. Obviously the tradition that he was buried in those places was invented by
people—living long after Guan Yu’s death who loved and admired Guan Yu and all
that he had stood for and wanted to claim him for themselves. And if you look in. the
Geographical Gazetteer, you’ll find that it isn’t only Guan Yu who has graves in several
different places: practic?ally all the famous men who ever lived appear to have been
buried in more than one place. And when it comes to sites which are famous because
of people who never even existed, they are still more numerous. It may well be that
the people those last two poems are about didn’t exist; but though the stories about
them are unhistorical, they are certainly well-known. You can hear them told -by
story-tellers; you can see them acted on the stage; you can even find references to
them on the divination-sticks that people tell their fortunes with in temples. There
can’t be a man, woman or child who isn’t familiar with them. And even if one knows
them from the books, it can hardly be said that to have read a few lyrics from The
Western Chamber or The Soul’s Return is tantamount to reading pornography. No, I
see no harm in these two poems. I think she should leave them as they are.’
This, coming from Li Wan, effectively silenced Bao-chai’s objection.
Some time was now spent in trying to guess answers to the riddles concealed in
these poems, but all of their guesses were wrong.
The days in winter are very short and in no time at all, it seemed, they were trooping
back into the mansion for their dinner. While they were there, a message arrived for
Lady Wang to say that Aroma’s brother, Hua Zi-fang, had come and was waiting
outside in the front.
His mother is seriously ill and has been asking to see Aroma,’ said the messenger. He
asks if, as a special kindness, you will allow her to go home and see her.’
‘We shouldn’t dream of preventing a mother from seeing her daughter under such
circumstances,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Of course she may go.’
She called for Xi-feng and, having explained the situation to her, left it to her to
decide what arrangements should be made for Aroma’s departure. Xi-feng promised
to attend to the matter and hurried back to her own apartment to do so. She told
Zhou Rui’s wife to break the news to Aroma about her mother. She also gave detailed
instructions for the visit.
‘Get hold of another of the women in your group to go with you as second
chaperone. And take two of the junior maids with you as well. And you’ll want four of
the grooms from the front. Take responsible ones: not too young. Tell them you’ll
need two carriages, one large and one small. You two can sit in the larger one with
Aroma, and the two maids can go in the smaller one.’
Zhou Rui’s wife was on the point of going off to execute these orders, but Xi-feng had
evidently not finished.
‘Aroma’s a girl who doesn’t like fuss. You’d better tell her that it’s my wish that she
should dress herself up in the very best things she’s got. Tell her to take a good big
bundle of extra clothes with her as well. The cloth it’s wrapped in is to be of the
highest quality. Her hand-warmer is to be a good one, too. And tell her that before
she goes I want her to come here so that I can have a look at her.’
Zhou Rui’s wife went off to do her bidding. In due course Aroma herself arrived,
dressed up in all her finery. She was accompanied by Zhou Rui’s wife and the other
woman and by two little maids, one carrying her bundle and the other one her
hand-warmer. Xi-feng proceeded at once to inspect her, begin?ning at the top.
Aroma’s hair, liberally studded with pearled and golden jewellery, was satisfactory;
her clothing, it seemed, less so. She had on an ermine-lined silk tapestry dress of
peach-pink satin, sprigged with a pattern of different sorts of flowers, a leek-green
padded skirt embroidered in couched gold thread and coloured silks, and a black
satin jacket lined with squirrel.
‘I see. These are all things that Her Ladyship gave you. That’s good. But the jacket is
too plain. And it’s not warm enough for the time of year, either. You want something
with a heavier fur in it.’
‘This is the only one she gave me,’ said Aroma, ‘and the only other one I’ve got is
lined with ermine. She promised me one with a heavier fur in time for the New Year,
but I haven’t been given it yet.’
‘I’ve got one with a heavier fur which I haven’t worn be?cause the trimmings don’t
suit me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’d been meaning to get it altered, but I could let you have it
now if you like and you can give it back to me to have altered when Her Ladyship gets
this other one made that she’s promised you. We’ll call it a loan.’
The servants laughed.
‘You like to have your little joke, Mrs Lian. All the year round you’re handing things
out on the quiet that Her Lady?ship has overlooked, yet you never ask her for any
thing back for them. Why so stingy all of a sudden about a little old jacket?’
‘Her Ladyship can’t be expected to remember everything,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and these
are, after all, rather trifling matters. Of course, someone has to think about them, for
the sake of appearances. Even if it leaves me a bit out of pocket, I’ve got to see that
everyone is dressed decently. If that gets me a reputation for being generous well,
that’s just one of the hardships I must learn to put up with! It would be much worse
to have everyone going around looking like tramps. Think of the jokes I should hear
about my housekeeping then!’
‘ There can’t be many like you, Mrs Lian,’ said the women admiringly, ‘so
considerate towards Her Ladyship and yet at the same time so thoughtful towards us
servants. You really do think of everything.’
While they were praising her, Xi-feng was already ordering Patience to fetch the
jacket she had mentioned. It had in fact arrived from the tailor’s only a day or two
previously. It was a very grand one, in slate-blue satin, with eight large,
embroidery-like silk tapestry roundels woven into it, and with a lining of arctic fox.
After giving Aroma the jacket, Xi-feng inspected her bundle. The carrying-cloth was of
silk gauze in a nondescript black-and-white pattern, lined with strawberry?coloured
silk. All she had got wrapped up in it were a couple of padded dresses, by no means
new, and her other fur-lined jacket. Xi-feng told Patience to fetch a better
carrying-cloth-one made of a good-quality foreign broadcloth and lined with
turquoise-coloured silk—and a snow-cape to add to the con?tents of her bundle.
Patience went off to get them. When she came back she was carrying not one
snow-cape but two: one of them, in dark-red felt, showed signs of wear; the other, in
dark-red camlet, seemed to be almost new.
Aroma protested.
‘I can’t possibly take both of these,’ she said. ‘Even one of these would seem a bit
on the grand side for me.’
‘Just pack the felt one,’ said Patience. ‘You can carry the other one on your arm and
on your way out get someone to take it over to Miss Xing. Yesterday when we had
that heavy snow there were ten or a dozen of them all wearing felt or camlet
snow-capes. They made quite a picture in their red capes against the background of
white snow. She was the only one there who hadn’t got one. She looked all
hunched-up with the cold, poor thing: I felt really sorry for her. Let her have the
camlet one.’
‘See how liberal she is with my possessions,’ Xi-feng expostulated jokingly. ‘Heavens,
girl, I give enough away already without needing you to help me!’
‘Like mistress, like maid,’ said the woman who had spoken before. ‘It’s because you
yourself are so considerate towards Her Ladyship and so kind to us servants that she
feels free to behave in that way. If you were a mean. tight-fisted sort of person, she’d
never dare.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘I suppose you could say that she understands me a bit—about thirty per cent
perhaps!’
She turned back to Aroma to deliver her parting in?structions.
‘We must hope that your mother recovers, but if by any chance she doesn’t, you
will obviously have .to stay on for a bit. Let me know, in that case, and I’ll have your
bedding sent on to you. Don’t use their bedding or any of their toilet things.’ She
turned to Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘You know our rules, don’t you? I don’t need to go over
them again.’
‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘All their people are to keep away from us while
we are there, and if we stay they have to give us one or two inside rooms to
ourselves.’
With that she accompanied Aroma outside and called to the pages to fetch lanterns,
for it was already getting dark. The little party then made its way to the carriages,
and having dis?posed themselves inside them, were driven off to Hua Zi?-fang’s
house, where our story leaves them.

*

Back at the mansion Xi-feng summoned two of the nannies from Green Delights.
‘I doubt very much whether Aroma will be coming back for a day or two,’ she told
them. ‘You’d better tell whichever two of the senior maids you think are most
reliable to be on call at night in Bao-yu’s room while she is away. And keep an eye on
things yourselves. See that he doesn’t get up to mischief.’
The two women went off, saying that they would attend to the matter, and a little
later came back to report on what they had arranged.
‘We’ve put Skybright and Musk on night-call in his room. There are always four of
us outside, of course. We take it in turns to be on duty throughout the night.’ Xi-feng
nodded.
‘See that he goes to bed early and doesn’t get up too late.’
The old women promised, and went back into the Garden.
Not long after this Zhou Rui’s wife returned with the mes?sage that Xi-feng had been
half expecting: Aroma’s mother had already breathed her last and Aroma would be
unable to come back. Xi-feng went off to report this news to Lady Wang. She also
sent someone into the Garden to collect Aroma’s bedding and toilet things. Bao-yu
stood by and supervised, while Skybright and Musk got them ready.
When Aroma’s things bad been despatched, the two girls removed their hair
ornaments and changed into their night-clothes. Skybright showed no disposition,
after changing, to remove herself from the clothes-warmer over which she was
crouched.
‘Now don’t start acting the young lady,’ said Musk. ‘I advise you to stir yourself a
bit.’
‘I’ll stir myself soon enough when you are out of the way,’ said Skybright. ‘As long as
you are around, I might as well take it easy.’
‘Now come on, there’s a good girl!’ said busy Musk. ‘I’ll make his bed and you can
put the covet over the dressing-mirror and fasten the catch. You’re taller than I am.’
She bustled off and began making up Bao-yu’s bed.
‘Hail’ said Skybright disgustedly. ‘Just as I was beginning to get warm!’
Bao-yu, who up to that moment had been sitting apart, abstractedly wondering
about Aroma’s mother (he had still not been told of her death), chanced suddenly to
catch this remark. At once he got up, went into the next room, and attended to the
dressing-mirror himself,
‘Carry on warming yourself,’ he said with a smile to Skybright as he came in again,
‘I’ve done it for you.’
‘I don’t think I shall ever get warm,’ said Skybright. And I’ve just remembered: I
haven’t brought in the hot-water bottle.’
‘How thoughtful we are all of a sudden!’ said Musk. ‘He never has a hot-water
bottle. And we shan’t need one tonight. It’ll be much -warmer in here on the
clothes-warmer than it is on the kang in the other room.’
‘You’re not both going to sleep on the clothes-warmer, are you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I
shall be scared, all on my own in the closet-bed with nobody near me. I shan’t be
able to sleep.’
‘Well, I’m sleeping on the clothes-warmer at all events,’ said Skybright. ‘Let Musk
sleep beside the closet-bed.’
The time was well after nine. Musk, who had by this time let down the curtains,
moved the lamp to its night-time position, and lit the slow-burning incense, now
helped Bao-yu into bed and tucked him up. After that she and Skybright themselves
settled down for the night, Skybright on top of the clothes-warmer and Musk outside
the curtains which separ?ated the alcove of the closet-bed from the rest of the room.
Some time in the middle watch of the night Bao-yu called out for Aroma a couple of
times in his sleep and, not getting the customary response, woke up. Awake he
remembered, with some amusement, that Aroma was not there to answer. The noise
he made had woken Skybright, who called out from where she lay to Musk.
‘Musk! He’s even woken me up, over here. Do you mean to say you really haven’t
heard anything, lying there right beside him? You must sleep like a corpse!
Musk turned over and yawned.
‘He was calling for Aroma; what’s it got to do with me? What do you want?.’ she
asked Bao-yu.
‘I want some tea,’ he said.
Musk hopped out of bed to get him some. She was wearing only a quilted red silk
tunic.
‘You’ll get cold,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Put my fur gown on.’ She picked up the winter
dressing-gown that lay always ready beside him, in case he should need to get up
during the night. It was lined with the orange-yellow chest fur of pine-martens and
had a big fur collar. Slipping the gown over her shoulders, Musk first washed her
hands in the basin, then she poured him a cup of hot water and held the spittoon for
him to spit into when he had washed his mouth out. After that she took a teacup
from the shelf where the tea-things were kept, rinsed it out with hot water, and filled
it from a pot in a padded wicker case in which ready-brewed tea was kept warm for
such emergencies. Having ministered to Bao-yu’s wants, she rinsed her own mouth
out with the hot water and poured half a cup of tea out for herself.
‘Musk,’ Skybright called out to her, ‘give us a drop too, there’s a dear!’
‘What a nerve!’
‘Go on!’ said Skybright. ‘Tomorrow night you can lie back all night long and let me
wait on you.’
Musk held out the spittoon, as she had done for Bao-yu, while Skybright rinsed her
mouth out, then fetched her half a cupful of tea.
‘Don’t go to sleep yet, you two,’ she said, as soon as Sky?bright had been attended
to. ‘Keep talking while I go outside for a hit.’
‘There’s a ghost waiting for you out there,’ said Skybright. ‘There’s no ghost out
there, but there’s a very fine moon,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Go ahead: we’ll keep talking, don’t
worry!’
He coughed significantly.
Musk opened the door and lifted up the felt portière. There was, as Bao-yu had
predicted, a beautiful moon outside. As soon as she had gone out, Skybright slipped
down from the clothes-warmer and tip-toed after her, intending to give her a scare.
Physically the hardiest of the maids and, as a rule, the one who was least afraid of
the cold, she went as she was, with nothing but a short tunic to cover her. Bao-yu
tried to dis?suade her from going out.
‘I wouldn’t, if I were you. If you catch cold, it won’t be quite so funny.’
But Skybright motioned impatiently to him to be quiet and crept out of the door.
The .moonlight outside was like water. Suddenly she heard the wind. It was only a
brief, faint gust, but the chill of it penetrated to the marrow of her bones and made
her shudder.
‘It’s certainly true what they say about a warm body fearing the wind,’ she reflected.
‘This cold is really no joke.’
She was still determined to frighten Musk; but just as she was about to do so, Bao-yu
called out in a loud voice from indoors.
‘Careful Musk! Skybright’s outside.’
Immediately Skybright ran in again.
What an old woman you are!’ she said. ‘The shock wouldn’t have killed her.’
‘I wasn’t thinking about that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was worried about your catching cold;
and besides, if she’d called out when you startled her she might have woken
somebody up, and you know what it would have been like then. They’d never have
believed it was a practical joke, they’d have said, “Just look, Aroma only away for a
single night and already the girls in his room are seeing things. Not one of them’s to
be trusted.” Come on, come over here and tuck this quilt in for me.’
Skybright went over to arrange his bedding. While she was doing so, she stuck one of
her hands inside the cover and held it against his skin.
‘Your hand is freezing!’ he said. ‘I told you you’d get cold.’ He noticed how red her
cheeks were and put out his hand to touch them. They were as cold as ice.
‘Quick, you’d better get inside here and warm up,’ he said. Just as she did so, there
was a loud bang and Musk rushed giggling into the room, slamming the door behind
her.
‘Whew, what a shock I’ she said. ‘I thought I saw someone crouching down in the
shadows behind the rockery. Actually it was that long-tailed pheasant. I was just
going to cry out, when it heard me coming and flew up into the light, so that I could
see what it was. If I’d lost my head and started scream?ing, I might have woken
everybody up.’
She said this while washing her hands. Presently she finished washing and laughed.
‘Did you say Skybright had gone outside? I wonder why I didn’t see her. I bet she
went outside to scare me.’
‘What’s this lump here then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’s down in here getting warm. She
did go outside. If I hadn’t called out when I did, she would have scared you.’
‘She doesn’t need me to scare her, silly little goose!’ said Skybright, laughing, from
inside the bedclothes. ‘By the looks of it she’s perfectly capable of scaring herself!’
She emerged from Bao-yu’s bedding now and crossed the room to the
clothes-warmer to get inside her own. Musk gazed at her incredulously as she did so.
‘Is that all you were wearing when you went outside, that circus rider’s outfit
you’ve got on now ?’
‘That’s all she was wearing,’ said Bao-yu.
‘You’ll die before your time!’ said Musk. ‘What, standing around with only that on?
It’s enough to freeze the skin off you!’
She took the copper cover off the brazier and damped down the glowing charcoal by
shovelling some ash on to it with the fire shovel. Before replacing the cover, she
threw on a couple of pieces of agalloch to sweeten the air. Then she went behind the
screen and trimmed the lamp up. After that she too went back to bed.
The effect on Skybright of the sudden change of tempera?ture was to make her
sneeze. Bao-yu groaned.
‘I told you so. You have caught a cold.’
‘She was complaining that she -didn’t feel too good when we got up this morning,’
said Musk, ‘and she hasn’t eaten properly all day. Yet instead of looking after herself
she has to go playing pranks on people outside. It will be her own silly fault if she is ill
tomorrow.’
‘Does your head feel hot?’ Bao-yu asked Skybright.
Skybright coughed a few times.
‘It’s nothing,’ she said, ‘I’m not that delicate!’
Just then the chiming clock that hung on the partition in the outer room struck twice
and they heard the old woman on night duty cough a couple of times and call out:
‘Go to sleep, young ladies! There’ll be plenty of time for talking in the morning.’
Bao-yu gave a subdued chuckle.
‘Better not talk any more,’ he said. ‘We don’t want them talking about us.’
After that the three of them settled down and went to sleep again.
When Skybright got up next morning, her nose was stuffed up’ her voice was hoarse,
and the slightest movement cost her an effort.
‘We’d better keep this dark,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If my mother gets to hear of it, she’s sure
to insist on your going back home until you’re better; and however nice it may be at
your home, I’m sure it won’t be so warm as here, so you’ll be better off with us. I’ll
get a doctor in through the back gate to have a look at you on the quiet.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Skybright, ‘but at least let Mrs Zhu know what you’re
doing. Otherwise, when the doctor comes, what are you going to say if they start
asking ques?tions?’
Bao-yu knew that she was right and instructed one of the old nannies to go to Li Wan
with a message.
‘Tell Mrs Zhu that Skybright has got a bit of a chill. Say it’s nothing very serious, and
with Aroma away we shall be even more short-handed if she goes back home to get
better, so ?we’d like to get a doctor in quietly through the back gate to have a look at
her and not tell Her Ladyship about it.’
The old nannie was gone for quite a long time. When she did return it was with the
following answer.
‘Mrs Zhu says all right, as long as she’s better after one or two doses of medicine,
otherwise she thinks it would really be better to send her home. She says there’s so
much danger of infection at this time of year. She’s particularly worried that one of
the young ladies might catch something.’
All this time Skybright had been lying in the closet-bed inside, coughing. She stopped
coughing when she heard this message and called out angrily.
‘Anyone would think I’d got the plague I suppose I’d better go, if she’s so scared
that I might infect somebody. It would be just too terrible if any of you lot were to get
a head?ache or a sore throat as long as you live!’
She actually began getting up as she said this, but Bao-yu rushed in and made her lie
down again.
‘Now don’t start getting angry. She is, after ail, responsible for the girls and she’s
probably terrified that Lady Wang might get to know about this and grumble at her.
I’m sure that’s the only reason she says this: to cover herself in case it’s found out.
You’re inclined to be quick-tempered at the best of times. Now, with so much extra
heat inside you, you are even more inflammable!’
At this point the doctor was announced and Bao-yu barely had time to conceal
himself behind a bookcase as he entered the outer doorway, conducted by two or
three old women from the gate. The maids had all fled as soon as the arrival of a
male visitor was announced, leaving only three or four old nannies in charge of the
apartment. The old nannies quickly let down the closet-bed’s red embroidered
curtains and Sky?bright stretched forth her hand through a join in them.
This hand held out for the doctor’s inspection had nails two or three inches long on
two of its fingers, stained with balsam juice to a delicate shade of pink. The doctor
averted his eyes from this inflaming sight and would not proceed with the
examination until one of the old nannies had covered it up with a handkerchief.
When he had finished feeling the pulses, he got up, went into the outer room, and
announced his diagnosis to the nannies.
‘The young lady is suffering from inner congestion caused by exposure. In view of
the severe weather we have been having we should probably not be far wrong in
calling it a minor case of cold-fever or grippe. Fortunately your patient is a young lady
and therefore probably fairly modest in her diet; and the exposure does not appear
to have been a very serious one. What we have, then, is no more than a mild
infection picked up by someone whose stamina is normally rather low. One or two
doses of something to disperse the congestion should be sufficient to put her right.’
Having pronounced this diagnosis, he went off, conducted once more by the women
who had brought him in.
Li Wan had sent warning of the doctor’s arrival both to the servants on the gate and
the maids in the various apartments, so that his passage through the Garden, both
coming and going, was through an empty landscape in which not a single female was
to be seen. After passing through the Garden gate, he sat down in the outer lodge
which the pages occupied and wrote -out his prescription.
‘Don’t go yet, sir,’ said one of the old women when he had finished writing it. ‘Our
young master always likes to have his say about these matters. Like as not he’ll have
some question to ask you.’
The doctor looked startled.
‘Did you say “master”? But surely that was a young lady I examined just now? The
room was certainly a young lady’s boudoir, and the consultation was made with the
patient behind a curtain. Surely it cannot have been a young gentleman?’
The old woman laughed.
‘I see now why the boys said we had a “new doctor” coming in today. You certainly
don’t know much about this family, sir! That was our young master’s room you were
in lust now, but the person you examined was one of his maids one of the senior
ones. That was no young lady’s room. If one of the young mistresses had been ill, you
wouldn’t have got into her room that easy not on your first visit!’
She took the prescription from him and went back inside to show Bao-yu. Bao-yu
glanced through it rapidly. ‘Perilla’, ‘kikio root’, ‘wind-shield’ and ‘nepeta-seed’
appeared among the drugs at the head of the list, and lower down he noticed ‘thorny
lime’ and ‘ephedra’. He was appalled.
‘He’s prescribing for her as if she were a man. However bad the congestion is, you
can’t expect a young girl to stand up to drugs like thorny lime and ephedra. Who sent
for this man, anyway? You’d better get rid of him straight away and send for
someone we know.’
‘We weren’t to know what his prescriptions would be like,’ said the woman
defensively. ‘I suppose we could send one of the boys for Dr Wang. The only thing is,
as we didn’t tell the Office about this one, we shall have to pay him ourselves.’
‘How much ?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Well, you don’t want to give too little,’ said the old woman. ‘I should think for a
single visit a family like ours would give a tael.’
‘How much do we give Dr Wang for-a visit?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Ah, Dr Wang and Dr Zhang are our regular doctors. They aren’t paid by the visit.
They get a fixed yearly amount paid to them in quarterly installments. But this is a
new man who’s only ever been here the once, so we have to pay him now.’
Bao-yu ordered Musk to fetch a tael for him, but Musk said that she didn’t know
where Aroma kept her money.
‘I’ve seen her taking silver from the little pearl-inlaid cabinet,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll go
along with you and have a look.’
The two of them went into the room that Aroma used as her store-room and opened
the cabinet that Bao-yu had re?ferred to. In the top compartment they found nothing
but writing-brushes, ink-sticks, fans, incense-pastilles and a wide variety of scarves
and sachets. In the lower compartment, however, they found several strings of cash,
and there was a drawer in it in which they found a work-basket containing several
pieces of silver and even a little balance for weighing it with. Musk picked up the
balance.
‘Which of these is the one tad mark?’ she said.
‘That’s rich,’ said Bao-yu, ‘your asking me! Anyone would think you were new here.’
Musk laughed. She was about to go outside and ask, but Bao-yu stopped her.
‘Just pick out one of the larger pieces and give her that. There’s no need to bother
about the exact amount. We aren’t shopkeepers.’
Putting the balance back into the basket, Musk picked up one of the pieces of silver
and felt the weight of it on her palm.
‘I should think this one is about a tael,’ she said. ‘Anyway, it’s better to give too
much than too little. A poor creature like that, used to scrimping and scraping himself,
would say that it was meanness if we gave him too little. He’d never believe it was
because we didn’t know how to use-a balance.’
The woman who had brought the prescription was standing in the doorway,
following all this with amusement.
‘That piece you’ve got in your hand is half of a five-tael ingot,’ she said. ‘It must
weigh two taels at the very least. Since you haven’t got any silver-shears, I should
keep that piece if I were you and pick out a smaller one.’
But Musk had already closed the cabinet.
‘Oh, I can’t be bothered to look in there again. Just take it. Never mind the weight.’
‘And tell Tealeaf to go and get Dr Wang,’ said Bao-yu.
The old woman took the silver and went off to deal with the matter.
Tealeaf must have been quick, for Dr Wang arrived quite soon afterwards. The
diagnosis he gave after taking Skybright’s pulses was similar to the other man’s, but
there was no ephedra or thorny lime in his prescription: their place was taken by
milder drugs such as angelica, bitter-peel and white peony root; and the quantities
prescribed were smaller. Bao-yu was pleased.
‘That’s more like it!’ he said. ‘She certainly needs treating for congestion, but not in
the savage way this other man was proposing. I remember last year when I was
suffering from the same thing and Dr Wang came to look at me—in my case I was
badly constipated as well—he said that my constitution wouldn’t stand- up to harsh
decongestants like ephedra, gypsum and thorny lime. Well, if my constitution won’t
stand up to those drugs, I’m quite sure that yours or Skybright’s wouldn’t. In
comparison with you girls, I’m like one of those old aspens that have stood for half a
century or more in some grave-garth in the countryside, while you are like those
deli?cate crab-flowers that Yun brought round for me in the autumn.’
‘Aspens aren’t the only trees you find growing in grave?garths,’ said Musk, smiling.
‘What about pines and cypresses.? I hate aspens great, stupid trees I It’s not as if they
had more leaves than others, yet at the slightest breath of wind they start making a
racket. Why compare yourself to an aspen? How common!’
‘I wouldn’t compare myself with a pine or a cypress,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Confucius
himself speaks highly of those two trees:


“When the year is coldest, we see that pine and cypress are the last to fade.”
That shows you how noble they are. I should need to be a very conceited person to
compare myself with them.’

While he was still discussing this with Musk and Skybright, the old woman who had
shown him the prescription arrived back again with the drugs. Bao-yu told one of the
maids to find the silver medicine skillet and brew them on the brazier in his room.
‘Now do be sensible!’ said Skybright. Tell them to do it in the tea-kitchen. You’ll
stink the place out with the smell of boiling herbs if you do it in here.’
‘But the smell of boiling herbs is the finest smell in the world,’ said Bao-yu, ‘—far
superior to the perfume of any flower. Even the Immortals are supposed to gather
herbs and cook them; and gathering herbs to make medicine with is the favourite
occupation of hermits and holy men. The smell of medicine: that is the one aesthetic
treat that has so far been missing from this apartment; and now, today, we shall
enjoy it!’
And he insisted that they should prepare the medicine on the spot. Then he told
Musk to get some things ready to send to Aroma and commissioned one of the old
women to take them to her. She was to see how Aroma was and urge her not to
endanger her health by excessive weeping. When all these matters had been
attended to, he went off to pay his morning calls on Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia
and to have his lunch.
He found Xi-feng at Grandmother Jia’s place discussing mealtime arrangements with
his mother and grandmother.
‘Now that it’s so cold and the days are so short,’ she was saying, ‘wouldn’t it be
better if Li Wan and the young people were to have their meals in the Garden, to
avoid all this trek?king to and fro? They can begin coming in for them again when the
weather is warmer and the days are not so short.’
‘Oh, much better, surely?’ said-Lady Wang. ‘Especially when it’s snowing or blowing,
as it has been recently. It’s so bad for one to be exposed to the cold immediately
after eating. It’s also not good to eat food after being out in the cold with an empty
stomach. The empty parts fill up with cold air and then the food presses it down
inside one. That big five-frame room inside the back gate of the Garden would make
an ideal kitchen. We’ve already got all those women there who keep watch in the
Garden at night, so there are plenty of hands for fetching and carrying. All we need
are a couple of women from the kitchens here to go over and do the cooking. There
are regular allowances for vegetables and so forth, so they can either get the money
from Accounts and do their own shopping themselves, or, if they prefer, they can ask
the Office to get the stuff for them. And when we have anything special here, like
pheasant or roebuck, we can always arrange for a share of it to be sent over to them.’
‘I’d been thinking along these lines myself,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘but I was afraid
that opening another kitchen might mean extra trouble for you and Feng.’
‘ No trouble at all,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It’s simply a matter of switching
allowances—spending a bit more here and a bit more there. And even if it does put
our expenses up a bit, we don’t want the girls getting colds. Cousin Lin is particularly
sus?ceptible. Even Bao-yu is liable to suffer from the cold; and none of our girls is
really strong.’
How Grandmother Jia replied will be shown in the follow?ing chapter.

CHAPTER 52

Kind Patience conceals the theft of a Shrimp Whisker bracelet
And brave Skybright repairs the hole in a
Peacock Gold snowcape



‘QUITE so,’ said Grandmother Jia in answer to Xi-feng’s advocacy of the separate
kitchen. ‘I would have mentioned it myself, but you have so many burdens already
and I didn’t want to add to them. I know, of course, that you wouldn’t have
complained, but you might easily have got the impression that I only care about the
younger ones and have no con?sideration for you busy people who are responsible
for run-ring the household. However, now that you have suggested it yourself, I am
naturally delighted.’
It chanced that besides Aunt Xue and Mrs Li, Lady Xing and You-shi were also present
on this occasion, having come over some time previously to make their morning calls
and not yet gone back again. Grandmother Jia availed herself of their presence to
sing Xi-feng’s praises.
‘I wouldn’t say this as a rule because I don’t want to make her conceited, and in any
case the younger ones might not agree with me: but tell me now—as older married
women you have all had a good deal to do with her - have you ever met anyone quite
as thoughtful as Feng?’
Aunt Xue, Mrs Li and You-shi agreed that people with Xi-feng’s virtues were indeed
extremely rare.
‘Other young married women put on a show of liking their husband’s relations for
form’s sake,’ they observed, ‘but she really does seem to care for the young people;
and she is plainly devoted to you.’
Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed.
‘I’m very fond of her, but I’m afraid she’s a bit too sharp. It doesn’t do to be too
sharp.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Now there you are quite wrong, Grannie. The saying is that sharp-witted people
don’t live long. Everyone says that and everyone believes it, but you should be the
last person to agree with them. Look how long-lived and lucky you are, and yet you
are ten times more sharp-witted than me. By rights I should live twice as long as you,
if there is any truth in the saying. I expect to live until I am at least a thousand. At all
events I shan’t die until I have seen you go to heaven!’
‘It will be a very dull sort of world when all the rest are dead and only we two old
harpies are left alive,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The others laughed.
Remembering Skybright, Bao-yu left before the others and hurried back to his
apartment to see how she was. The air in it reeked of medicine. Skybright, lying on
the kang, her face a dusky red now with the fever, appeared to be completely on her
own. He felt her forehead and found it burning to the touch. Quickly warming his
hands over the stove, he slipped one of them inside the bedclothes and felt her body.
That too was fiery hot.
‘I should have thought Musk and Ripple might have stayed with you, if no one else,’
he said disgustedly. ‘I call that pretty heartless, leaving you on your own like this.’
‘Ripple’s not here because I made her go and have her lunch,’ said Skybright ‘And
Musk has only just this moment been called outside by Patience. They’re whispering
together in the front about something or other probably about the fact that I didn’t
go home to get better.’
‘Patience isn’t that sort of person,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She wouldn’t have known that you
were ill in any case, so she wouldn’t have come specially about you. Probably she
came to talk to Musk about something else, but happening to find you ill, pretended
she had come about you out of politeness. It’s the sort of social fib that anyone might
tell under the circum?stances. Even if you were in trouble for not going home, it’s got
nothing to do with Patience; and as you have always been on good terms with her in
the past, there’s no earthly reason why she should want to make unpleasantness
between you now by interfering in something that doesn’t concern her.’
‘I expect you’re right,’ said Skybright. ‘But I don’t under-stand why she should want
to hide things from me.’
‘I’ll go and find out what they’re talking about,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I go out the back
door and round the side, I shall be able to listen to them from outside the window.’
Going round to the front as he had said, he inclined his ear to the window and
listened. He could hear Musk talking in a low voice to Patience inside:
‘How did you come to get it back again?’
‘It was when I was washing my hands in the Garden that day that I lost it,’ he heard
Patience reply. ‘Mrs Lian made me keep quiet about it at the time, but as soon as we
got back she sent word round to the nannies in the different apartments and told
them to investigate. To tell the truth, we rather suspected Miss Xing’s maid. We
thought being so poor and not used to seeing things like that lying around she might
have been tempted. We never dreamed that it would turn out to be one of your
people.
‘It was Trinket who stole it. She was seen by your Mamma Song. Fortunately, when
Mamma Song came round with the bracelet to tell Mrs Lian, Mrs Lian was out, so I
quickly took it from her and told her to keep quiet about it.
‘I couldn’t help thinking how considerate is to you girls and how proud of you all he
is. It’s only two years since that girl Honesty stole the jade and there are some I could
mention who are still gloating about it, and now here’s this girl stealing gold—not
from him this time but from one of his neighbours, which is worse. I could just
imagine the gloating there would be if that got around. It seemed so unjust that he,
of all people, should be let down by his own girls in this way.
‘Anyway, I told Mamma Song that she was under no cir?cumstances to let Bao-yu
know about this. “In fact,” I said, “you’d better not tell anyone. Just behave as if
nothing had happened.” Of course, it wasn’t only Bao-yu I was thinking about. I knew
that Their Ladyships would be very angry if the got to hear of it and then it would be
very unpleasant for Aroma and the rest of you.
‘The story I told Mrs Lian when she got back was that I’d been to see Mrs Zhu and
picked the bracelet up on the way. I told her it must have slipped off into the grass
that day while I was washing and got buried under the snow, which explains why
nobody could find it. When the snow melted, there it was, shining in the sun for all to
see. I think she believed me.
‘The reason I’m telling you this is so that you should be on your guard about that
girl. Keep an eye on her and don’t send her on any errands. When Aroma gets back,
have a word with her about it and see if you can’t cook up some excuse for
dis?missing her.’
‘Little wretch!’ said Musk. ‘It isn’t as if she hasn’t seen things like that before. How
could she be so stupid?’
‘It wasn’t a particularly valuable bracelet,’ said Patience. ‘It’s one that Mrs Lian gave
me. It’s what they call a “shrimp whisker” bracelet. I think the pearl on it might be
quite valuable. That Skybright of yours is such a fire-brand that if I told her this, I’m
sure she’d never be able to keep quiet about it. She’d blow up immediately and start
hitting the girl or shouting at her, and then the whole thing would be out, in spite of
all I had done to keep it dark. That’s why I’m telling you. I thought someone ought to
be warned, so that you can keep an eye on her.’
With these words Patience took her leave.
Bao-yu had listened to what she said with conflicting emotions: pleasure at
discovering that Patience understood him so well; anger that Trinket should be a
thief; regret that so intelligent a person should be capable of so ugly an action. Going
back to Skybright, he relayed to her everything he had just heard except what
Patience had said about Skybright herself, which he emended somewhat for her
benefit.
‘She said you’re such a worrier that if you were to hear this now, while you are ill, it
would make you worse. She’s planning to tell you about it when you are better.’
Skybright’s reaction was as fiery as Patience had foreseen it would be. Her eyebrows
flew up and her eyes became round with anger. She wanted to summon Trinket
immediately.
‘Isn’t it rather a poor return for Patience’s considerateness immediately to start
making an outcry about it?’ said Bao-yu, restraining her. ‘Why not accept what she
has done in the spirit in which it was intended and get rid of Trinket later on?’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Skybright, ‘but I feel so angry. If I don’t get it off my chest
now, I shall burst,’
‘What have you got to be angry about?’ said Bao-yu, amused. ‘You just concentrate
on getting better.’
Skybright had already had one dose of her medicine. To?wards evening she was given
the second infusion. But although she perspired a bit during the night, it didn’t really
seem to do much good. She still had a temperature, her head still ached, her nose
was still blocked, and she was still just as hoarse. In the morning Dr Wang came again,
and after taking her pulses, made a few alterations in the prescription; but although
the revised dosage brought down her temperature a little, her head still ached as
before.
‘Fetch the snuff,’ Bao-yu commanded. ‘If sniffing it can make her give a few good
sneezes, it will clear her head.’
Musk went off to do his bidding and presently returned with a little oval box made of
aventurine, edged and embel?lished with gold. Bao-yu took it from her and opened it.
Inside the lid, in West Ocean enamel, was a picture of a naked, yellow-haired girl with
wings of flesh. The box contained snuff of the very highest quality, which foreigners
call uncia,
‘Sniff some,’ he told Skybright, who had taken the box and was gazing fascinatedly
at the picture inside it. ‘If you leave it open too long, it will lose its fragrance and then
it won’t be so good.’
Skybright took a little of the snuff with her fingernail and sniffed it up her nose;
Nothing happened, so she scooped up a really large amount and sniffed again. A
tingling sensation passed through the root of her nose, right up inside her cranium
and she began to sneeze: four, five, six times in suc?cession. Immediately her eyes
and nose began to stream. She shut the box hurriedly with a laugh.
‘Goodness, how it burns! Give me some paper.’
At once one of the younger maids handed her a wad of tissue. Skybright used sheet
after sheet of it to blow her nose on.
 ‘How’s that?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Much clearer,’ she said. ‘But I still have this headache in the front of my head.’
‘Now that we’ve started using foreign medicine, we may as well go the whole bog,’
said Bao-yu. ‘I expect we’ll have you better again in no time. Musk, go to Mrs Lian’s
and tell her I said please could she let me have some of that Western stuff she uses
to make her headache plasters with. It’s called yi-fu-na’
Musk went off, returning after a goodish while with half a tablet. She hunted out a
scrap of red satin and cut out two little circles each about the size of a fingertips from
it; then, having melted the yi-fu-na to an ointment-like consistency over the stove,
she spread a little of it on each of them with a hair?pin. Skybright stuck them on
herself, one over each temple, with the aid of a hand-mirror. Musk laughed.
‘You already looked like a banshee to start with, with your ill face and your hair all
over the place. Now, with those two things on you, you really do look a sight! Funny:
one hardly notices them on Mrs Lian. I suppose it’s because she wears them so often.
—By the way;’ she said, turning to Bao-yu, ‘Mrs Lian asked me to tell you that
tomorrow is your Uncle Wang’s birthday and Her Ladyship wants you to go. Tell me
what clothes you’ll be wearing tomorrow so that I can get them ready now and not
have to rush around in the morning.’
‘Oh, anything,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Whatever comes first to hand. Birthdays! It’s nothing
but birthdays from one year’s end to the next.’
He got up and left the room, intending to go to Xi-chun’s place to see how she was
getting on with the ‘painting; but as he came out of the courtyard gate, he saw
Bao-qin little maid Periwinkle hurrying across the pathway ahead of him and hurried
forward to catch up with her.
‘Where are you going?’ he asked.
‘To Miss Lin’s,’ said Periwinkle. ‘Miss Xue and Miss Bao-?qin are there already and
I’m on my way to join them.’
Bao-yu changed his mind about going to see Xi-chun and accompanied Periwinkle to
the Naiad’s House. He found not only Bao-chai and Bao-qin there but Xing Xiu-yan as
well. Dai-yu and her three visitors were sitting on the clothes-warmer gossiping,
while Nightingale sat in the closet-bed alcove by the window, sewing. The girls
laughed when they saw him enter.
‘Another one? There’s nowhere for you to sit.’
‘What a charming picture!’ said Bao-yu. “‘A Bevy of Beauties Keeping Warm in
Winter.” I should have come earlier. Still, your room is so warm, I shall be perfectly all
right on this chair.’
He sat on the chair that Dai-yu normally occupied. On this occasion it was covered
with a squirrel-skin rug. A marble jardinière in the closet-bed alcove where
Nightingale was sit ring caught his eye. It was full of single-petalled ‘water nymph’
narcissi growing in clumps of four or five flowers from each bulb.
‘What beautiful flowers!’ he said. ‘The warmth of the room makes their scent even
richer. How is it I didn’t notice them yesterday?’
‘They were given to Qin by your Chief Steward Lai Da’s wife,’ said Dai-yu: ‘two pots
of narcissi and two of winter-sweet. Qin gave these ones to me and one of the two
pots of winter-sweet to Cousin Yun. I didn’t really want them, but as she was kind
enough to offer them to me, I thought it would be churlish not to accept. If you’d like
them, I’d be very happy to pass them on to you.’
‘Thank you,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I’ve got two pots of them already. Though mind you,
they are not as good as these. In any case, if Cousin Qin gave them to you, you can’t
possibly go handing them over to somebody else.’
‘There’s hardly a minute of the day when I haven’t got a medicine-skillet on the
stove,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I seem practically to live on medicine nowadays. The smell of
medicine is bad enough as it is, but this heavy flower-scent on top of it makes me feel
quite faint. Besides, the smell of medicine spoils the smell of the flowers, which is a
pity. Much better carry them off somewhere where they can regain their purity away
from competing odours.’
‘I’ve got a sick person in my room today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘My room is full of
medicine-smells too. How did you know?’
‘What an extraordinary question!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I know nothing about it. How
should I know what goes on in your room? I don’t think you’ve teen attending to a
word I’ve been saying. You’re like someone who comes k half-way through a story
and disturbs the rest of the audience by asking questions.’
‘At least we shan’t want for a theme at our next poetry meeting,’ said Bao-yu.
“‘Narcissus “and “winter-sweet” will make splendid subjects.’
‘Oh no!’ wailed Dai-yu, burying her face in her hands. ‘What’s the point of having
poetry meetings? Another meet?ing only means another lot of penalties. It’s so
shaming.’
‘I suppose that’s meant for me,’ said Bao-yu, ‘since I’m the one who’s always
getting penalized. But if it doesn’t bother me, I don’t see what you have got to go
burying your face in your hands about.’
‘I shall call the next meeting,’ said Bao-chai brightly. ‘There will be four themes for
poems in Regular Verse and four for poems in other metres and everyone will have
to do all eight of them. The first will be a three-hundred-line poem in pentasyllabics
exhausting the rhyme “first”. It’s subject will be “On the Diagram of the Supreme
Ultimate”?
Bao-qin laughed.
One can see that it isn’t really poetry you’re interested in but in making things
difficult for others. It could be done, of course, if one really wanted to do it—it would
simply be a question of selecting bits from the Book of Changes and tortur?ing them
into some sort of verse—but what would be the point?
‘When I was eight I went with my father on one of his trips to buy foreign
merchandise to one of the Western sea-ports and while we were there we saw a girl
from the country of Ebenash. She was just like the foreign girls you see in paint?ings:
long, yellow hair done into plaits, and her head was smothered in jewels: carnelians,
cat’s-eyes and emeralds. She was wearing a corslet of golden chain-mall and a dress
of West Ocean brocade and she had a Japanese sword at her side covered all over
with jewels and gold. Actually she was more beautiful than the foreign girls you see
in paintings. They said that she had a perfect understanding of our literature and
could expound the Five Classics and write poems in Chinese. My father asked her
through an interpreter if she would write something for us in Chinese characters and
she wrote out one of her own poems for him.’
The cousins were enthralled and Bao-yu eagerly begged her to show them the poem.
‘That’s not possible,’ said Bao-qin. ‘I left it behind in Nanking.’
Bao-yu was very disappointed.
‘Just my luck!’ he said. ‘And I was hoping to broaden my experience.’
‘Don’t be a tease!’ said Dai-yu, giving Bao-qin a tug. ‘You didn’t leave anything
behind in Nanking. Look at all the lug?gage you brought with you! I think you’re
making it up. The others can believe you if they like, but I don’t.’
Bao-qin blushed and hung her head. She made no reply, but a little, secret smile was
faintly discernible in her features.
‘How like you to say that, Frowner!’ said Bao-chai. ‘You really are too sharp.’
‘Well, if she’s brought it with her, she ought to let us have a look and satisfy our
curiosity,’ said Dai-yu.
‘She’s got such a great pile of stuff,’ said Bao-chai, ‘she simply hasn’t had time to go
through it all yet. How does she know which of all those trunks and boxes she put it
in? Wait until she’s had time to sort her things out: no doubt she will come across the
poem and let you see it then.’ She turned to Bao-qin. ‘Or perhaps you can remember
it? If so, why don’t you recite it for us now?’
‘It was in Regular Pentameter,’ said Bao-qin. ‘I can re?member that. For a foreigner
it was really quite a good poem.’
‘Hold on.!’ said Bao-chai. ‘If you are going to recite it, let me first send for Yun, so
that she can hear it as well.’
She gave instructions to Periwinkle.
‘Go back to my room and tell Miss Shi that we’ve got a beautiful foreigner here
who can write poems in Chinese. Tell her that as she’s so crazy about poetry, we
thought she’d like to meet her. And tell her to bring that other poetry maniac with
her when she comes.’
Periwinkle went off laughing to deliver the message. Presently Xiang-yan’s voice,
loudly inquiring ‘Where’s this beautiful foreigner?’ could be heard outside, and a
moment later she and Caltrop walked into the room.
                 ‘Ere yet the shape was seen, the voice was heard’
said the others, laughing. When xiang-yun and Caltrop were seated, Bao-qin
repeated for their benefit what. she had just been telling the others. xiang-yun
pressed her to recite the poem, and this she now proceeded to do:

The Land of Ebenash
         Last night I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls;
         Tonight beside the watery waste I sing.
         The island’s cloud-cap drifts above the sea,
         And mists about its mountain forests cling.
         Our pasts and presents to the moon are one;
         Our lives and loves beyond our reckoning.
         Yet still my heart yearns for that distant South,
         Where time is lost in one eternal spring.


‘Fancy a foreigner being able to write that!’ said the cousins admiringly. ‘It’s better
than we Chinese could do ourselves.’
While they were still enthusing over the poem, Musk arrived to report that someone
had just been round with a message for Master Bao from Lady Wang.
‘Her Ladyship says, when you go to your Uncle Wang’s first thing tomorrow, will
you tell them that she’s sorry she can’t go herself, but she’s not feeling very well?’
Bao-yu stood up, out of respect for his mother, to reply. He asked Bao-chai and
Bao-qin lf they would be going too. No, said Bao-chai, they had sent a present
yesterday, and that was all they would be doing.
Conversation continued a little longer and then the com?pany broke up. As Bao-yu
politely insisted on the others going out before him, he would have been the last to
leave, but just as he was about to do so, Dai-yu called him back.
Tell me,’ she said, just how long will Aroma be away?’
‘I don’t know;’ said Bao-yu, ‘but she certainly won’t come back until after the
funeral?
Dai-yu evidently had something on her mind that she wanted to say but was finding
difficulty in expressing. whatever it was, she must have abandoned it, for, after
reflecting for a few moments ins in silence, all she said was:
You’d better go.’
Bao-yu, too, had a feeling that there were a lot of things he ought to be asking her,
but he could not for the moment recollect what any of them were. After trying
unsuccessfully to remember, he left her with a cheerful ‘See you tomorrow’ and
went down the steps outside, his head bent low as he con?tinued ruminating. Just as
he was about to set out across the forecourt, something occurred to him and he
remounted the steps and went in again.
‘The nights are getting so much longer now. How many times do you cough in the
night? Do you wake up very often?’
‘I’m much better at night than I was,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Last night I only coughed twice.
But I still don’t sleep very well. Last night I only slept between about two and four in
the morning. After that I couldn’t get hack to sleep again.’
‘Ah, I knew there was something important I wanted to ask you about,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I’ve just remembered what it was.’ He drew closer to her ear and went on in a lower
voice. ‘You know that bird’s nest that Cousin Bao sent you,—’
But before he could finish, Aunt Zhao called in to inquire lf Dai-yu was feeling better.
Dai-yu knew that she had dropped in on her way back from seeing Tan-chun, and
that the kind?ness, if kindness it were, was of a-somewhat tangential nature;
nevertheless she begged her with eager politeness to be seated and thanked her
warmly for the visit.
‘How kind of you to think of me, Mrs Zhao and to come here yourself in such bitter
weather!’
She ordered tea to be poured for her visitor) simultaneously darting a look at Bao-yu
which he rightly interpreted as an order to make himself scarce. It was in any case
time for his dinner, so he went to his mother’s place to have it. She made him go
back early, bearing in mind that he must be up betimes next morning.
When he got back to his own room, Bao-yu found that Skybright had already taken
her medicine. He judged it best to let her stay where she was in the closet-bed. He
himself slept on the space outside the curtain which Musk had occu?pied the
previous night. This time Musk slept on the clothes-warmer. He had it moved up
beside the closet-bed before they went to bed, so that she could be near at hand
during the night.
The night passed by without event.

*

Next day, before it was yet light, Skybright was calling on Musk to wake up.
‘Come on, Musk! You ought to be awake by now, Haven’t you slept enough yet?
You go outside and tell the others to get his morning drink ready while I try waking
him up.’
Musk hurriedly drew on a garment and got out of bed.
‘We’d better-both wake him and wait till he’s dressed and the clothes-warmer has
been carried back to its usual place before we let the others it’,’ she said. ‘The old
women have already said that he’s not to sleep in the same room as you in case he
catches your sickness. We shall never hear the end of it, if they find out that we’ve
been sleeping all crowded up together like this.’
‘Yes,’ said Skybright. ‘I was thinking that too.’
The two girls began calling Bao-yu. He must in fact have been awake already, for he
got out of bed and began dressing immediately. Musk called in one of the junior
maids to help her move the warmer back into place and fold up the bedding. Only
when all traces of the previous night’s sleeping arrange?ments had been effaced
were Ripple and Emerald called in to assist Bao-yu with his toilet.
  ‘It’s very overcast again,’ said Musk, when Bao-yu’s toilet had been completed. ‘It
looks as lf it will snow. You’d better put on your felt.’
Bao-yu nodded and changed the outer garment he had put on for a more substantial
one. A junior maid came in carrying a little tea-tray on which was a covered cup
containing a con?coction of red dates and Fukien lotus-seeds. Bao-yu drank a few
mouthfuls, took a piece of ginger from a saucerful of crystallized shapes held out to
him by Musk and put it in his mouth to nibble, addressed a few brief admonitions to
Sky?bright to look after herself while he was away, and went off to see his
grandmother.
She had not yet risen when he arrived at her apartment, but the servants, knowing
that he was going visiting and could not wait for her to get up, admitted him at once
to her bed?room. He caught a glimpse of Bao-qin lying asleep behind her, her face
turned inwards to the wall. The old lady observed that her grandson was wearing,
over his formal dress of lychee-brown broadcloth, a dark-red felt cape embellished
with roundels of gold thread and coloured silk embroidery. Its slate-blue satin border
was fringed with tassels.
‘Is it snowing?’ she asked him.
‘Not yet,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but it looks as if it will.’
Grandmother Jia turned to Faithful:
‘Give him that peacock-feather cloak we were looking at yesterday.’
Faithful murmured a reply and went out of the room, re?turning presently with a
magnificent snow-cape that gleamed and glittered with gold and green and
bronzy-bluish lights. It was like Bao-qin’s mallard-cape and yet somehow different.
‘This is what they call “peacock gold”,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It is made by the
Russians. They twist the barbs of peacock-feathers into a kind of yarn and weave it
from that. The other day I gave your cousin Bao-qin a cape like this made out of
mallard feathers. Now I am giving this one to you.’
Bao-yu kotowed and put it on. Grandmother Jia smiled.
‘Go and show your mother’
Bao-yu obediently hurried off to do so. On his way out he came upon Faithful,
standing beside the kang in the outer room. She affected to be rubbing her eyes in
order not to have to look at him. She had avoided speaking to him ever since the
frightful scene nearly two months earlier when she had vowed never to marry, and
Bao-yu was continually being made uncomfortable by her avoidance of him. Seeing
her once more preparing to ignore him, he went up to her with a friendly smile in the
hope of breaking her silence.
‘Faithful, see this! How do you think I look in it?’
But Faithful simply turned and fled, retreating into Grand?mother Jia’s bedroom.
Obliged to give up, he continued on his way to Lady Wang’s. After his mother had
seen the cape, he went into the Garden to show himself off to Musk and Sky?bright.
After that he returned to his grandmother’s to report.
‘I showed it to Mother. She said it seems almost a pity to wear it and I must be very,
very careful not to spoil it.’
‘That was the only one I had left,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘If you do spoil it I haven’t
got another one to give you. And there would be no question of getting another one
made for you - not in these parts.’
She put on her admonitions-for-the-departing-grandchild voice:
‘Now don’t drink too much. And leave early.’
‘Yes, Grandma.’
Old women from his grandmother’s apartment accom?panied him as far as the
reception hall of the outer mansion. Below the steps outside it his foster brother Li
Gui, together with Wang Rong, Zhang Ruo-jin, Zhao Yi-hua, Qian Sheng and Zhou Rui
and the pages Tealeaf, Storky, Ploughboy and Sweeper, had been waiting a long time
in readiness. The pages were carrying clothing-bundles and blankets, and two of the
older men were holding a splendidly caparisoned horse by the bridle. The old women
issued a few words of admonition to the men, the men, after acknowledging them
with a few per?functory cries, handed Bao-yu his whip and held the stirrup for him to
mount, and Bao-yu, mindful of the precious cape, got up slowly into the saddle. The
little party then began to advance, Li Gui and Wang Rong, one on either side, holding
the bridle-rings, Qian Sheng and Zhou Rul walking ahead, and Zhang Ruo-jin and
Zhao Yi-hua following closely behind.
‘Zhou, Qian,’ Bao-yu called out from the saddle to the two in front, ‘let’s go out of
the side gate, otherwise it will mean going past my father’s door and I shall have to
get down.’
‘Since Sir Zheng went away, his door’s kept locked all the time,’ said Zhou Rui,
turning a grinning face back to his young master. ‘You don’t need to get down.’
‘Even though it is locked, I still ought to get down,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Quite right, sir,’ said Li Gui and Qian Sheng approvingly. ‘If you was to get slack
about dismounting and Mr Lai or Mr .Lin was to see you, they’d be sure to have
something to say about it. Even though they couldn’t very well tell yon off, like
enough they’d blame us for not teaching you manners.’
By now Zhou Rui and Qian Sheng were moving towards the side entrance. While the
point of etiquette was still being discussed, they ran head on into Lai Da himself, of
whom they had just been speaking. Bao-yu at once reined to a halt and made as if to
dismount, but, Lai Da hurried up and prevented him by clinging to his leg. Bao-yu
thereupon stood up in the stirrups and, taking him by the hand, addressed him
graciously for some moments before continuing on his way. He had barely done so
when thirty or forty pages armed with dustpans and brushes came trooping into the
courtyard. Immediately they caught sight of Bao-yu, they lined up in a row along the
wall and stood with their arms at their sides while one of their number, evidently the
leader, stepped forward and, dropping to one knee in the Manchu salute, wished
Bao-yu a good morning. Bao-yu did not know the page’s name, so he merely smiled
and nodded. The whole troop remained motionless until the horse and its rider had
passed by.
Bao-yu’s little party now issued out of the side gate, where ten horses were ready
waiting for them: one for Li Gui and each of his fellows and one for each of the pages.
All sprang at once into the saddle and were off down the street like a puff of smoke.
At this point our story leaves them and turns to other matters.

*

Back at Green Delights Skybright, exasperated to find, after another dose of her
medicine, that the sickness still showed no disposition to depart, was holding forth
loudly against the whole generation of doctors.
They’re all cheats,’ she said. ‘They take your money, but none of the medicine they
give you is any good.’
‘Don’t be so impatient,’ said Musk soothingly. ‘Getting better is always a lengthy
business. You know what they say “Sickness comes like an avalanche but goes like
reeling silk”. This stuff isn’t the Elixir of Life. You can’t expect it to cure you in a
twinkling. You’ll be all right if you take things easy for a few days. Getting yourself
worked up will only give the sickness a tighter grip on you.’
Skybright’s anger changed direction and vented itself now upon the junior maids.
‘Where have you lot all sneaked off to?’ she called out to them. ‘Very bold, aren’t
you, now that you seem helpless? Just you wait till I’m better: I’ll have the hide off
every one of you.’
Her outcry produced a solitary response. A little girl called Steadfast came hurrying in
and inquired, ‘What is it, Miss?’
‘What’s happened to the others?’ said Skybright. ‘Are they all dead? Are you the
only one left alive?’
While she was speaking, Trinket, too, came in—at a some?what more ambling pace
than the other girl.
‘Look at this little creature, now!’ said Skybright. ‘Why couldn’t she have come
sooner? You’d have come running here fast enough if we’d been handing out
monthly allowances or sharing out sweets, wouldn’t you? Then you’d have been the
first to arrive. Come closer. I’m not a tiger. I won’t eat you.’
Trinket edged a few steps nearer. As she did so, Skybright suddenly raised herself
from her lying position, snatched hold of her hand, and began jabbing at it violently
with an enor?mous hairpin which she had been keeping concealed under her pillow.
‘What do you want this little claw for?’ she said. ‘It’s no good with a needle and
thread. All it’s good for is picking and stealing. Shifty eyes and light fingers! A little
claw like this can only bring you disgrace. Much better stab it!—and slab it!—and
stab it! so that it can’t do any more thieving.’
Trinket was by now screaming with pain. Musk quickly dragged her away out of
Skybright’s clutches and forced Skybright to lie down again in bed.
‘You’ve only just been sweating after the medicine,’ she said. ‘What’s the matter
with you? Do you want to die? If you’ll just wait until you’re better, you can punish
her as much as you like. Don’t start making a scene about it now!’
But Skybright insisted on calling in Mamma Song and deal?ing with the matter at
once.
‘Master Bao has told me to tell you that he finds Trinket lazy,’ she said when
Mamma Song arrived. ‘She answers him back and doesn’t do anything when he gives
her orders, and even when Aroma tells her to do things she says rude things about
her behind her back. Master Bao is most anxious that she should be dismissed
immediately. He says he will speak to Her Ladyship about it himself when he sees her
tomorrow.’
When Mamma Song heard this, she knew that the story of the bracelet must have
leaked out.
‘That’s as may be,’ she said. ‘But oughtn’t we to wait until Miss Aroma comes back
and tell her first?’
‘What I am giving you are Master Bao’s own orders,’ said Skybright. ‘He was most
particular that she Should be dis?missed immediately. I don’t see that Miss
Aroma—or Miss Sweetscents or Miss Smellypots for that matter—has got any?thing
to do with it. I know what I’m doing. Just do as I say. Go and get someone from her
family to come here immediately and take her away.’
‘You might just as well,’ said Musk. ‘She’ll have to go sooner or later. Let them take
her away now and get it over with.’
So Mamma Song had to go off and summon the girl’s mother from outside. When
Trinket had finished getting her belongings together, her mother went in with her to
see Musk and Skybright.
‘Now what’s all this about?’ she said. ‘If the girl’s done wrong, why can’t you just
punish her for it? Why do you have to dismiss her? It doesn’t leave us much face,
does it, if she’s dismissed ?’
‘You’ll have to ask Bao-yu about that when he gets back,’ said Skybright. ‘It’s
nothing to do with us.’ The woman sneered.
‘You know perfectly well that I wouldn’t dare. He always does what you young
ladies want him to in any case. Even if I saw him and he agreed that she could stay,
there’s no guaranteeing that she would if you young ladies weren’t agreeable. Take
what you said just now. I know he’s not here at the moment, but even so. if I was to
name his name as you did just now without a “master” or a “mister” to it, people
would say I was a savage, but for you young ladies, seemingly, it’s quite all right.’
Skybright became red with anger.
‘I called him by his name, did I? Why don’t you go and report me to Their Ladyships?
Tell them that I’m a savage and get me dismissed.’
‘I advise you to take that girl out of here and be on your way,’ said Musk. ‘If you
have anything to say, you can say it later. You can’t stand here wrangling about it now.
When have you ever seen other people bandying words with us? Even Mrs Lai and
Mrs Lin show a bit of restraint when they talk to us. And as for this business of saying
“Bao-yu” instead of “Master Bao”: everyone knows that it’s Her Old Ladyship’s
particular wish that we should. Because he’s not strong and she’s afraid he might die
young, she likes as many people as possible to use his name, to bring him luck. She
even has it written in big characters and pasted up on walls outside to get people
saying it. It would be funny if we couldn’t use his name when every water-carrier and
dung-carrier and beggar in town can do so. As a matter of fact only yesterday Mrs Lin
got told off by Her Old Ladyship for calling him “Master Bao”.
‘And for another thing, we senior maids are constantly having -to take messages to
Her Old Ladyship and Her Lady-ship about him, and when we do, we always say
“Bao-yu”, never “Master Bao”. Why, I should think we must each of us use his name a
couple of hundred times every day. You cer?tainly chose the wrong thing to find fault
with when you picked on that one! If you don’t believe me, go round one of these
days when you are free to Her Old Ladyship’s or Her Ladyship’s and you will hear us
openly calling him “Bao-yu” to their faces. But of course, you don’t have any
important business that would bring you in contact with Their Lady-ships, do you? All
your time is spent doing odd-jobs outside. One could hardly expect you to know the
way things are done in here.
‘But I’m afraid we really can’t have you standing around here any longer. If you stay
much longer, I’m afraid even though we don’t object someone else may come along
and ask what you are doing here. If you want to appeal against the girl’s dismissal,
you should get her out of here first and take it up with Mrs Lin afterwards and she
will speak to Master Bao about it. With all the hundreds of people there are in this
household we can’t have just anyone running in and out when?ever they feel like it.
We don’t even know the names of half of them.’
By way of emphasizing her point, Musk ordered one of the junior maids to fetch a
floor-cloth and begin wiping the floor. At this Trinket’s mother, unable to find a reply
and fearful of being caught staying too long, swept out angrily, taking her daughter
with her. But Mamma Song was not letting them get away so easily.
‘You certainly don’t have much idea of manners, my good woman. After all the time
she’s been here, your daughter could at least make the young ladies a kotow before
she goes. She may have no other parting gift to give them—I don’t suppose they’d
set much store by it if she had— but she might at least have the decency to make -
them a kotow. You can’t both just up and go.’
Trinket was obliged to come in again and kotow to the two inside. She also went
round to do the same for Ripple and Emerald, but they refused to look at her. After
that she de?parted with her mother, the latter indicating as they went, by many a
sniff and sigh, the hatred that she dared net express more openly.
A consequence of this latest exposure to the cold and of the accompanying
emotional upset was that Skybright was now feeling bad again. At lighting-up time,
after tossing about feverishly all day, she was just beginning to settle down at last
when Bao-yu returned in a great fret and began stamping and groaning almost as
soon as -he entered the room. Musk asked him what the matter was.
‘It’s this cloak that Grandmother gave me this morning. She was so pleased about it,
and now—I don’t know how it happened—I’ve gone and got a burn in it behind the
lapel. Fortunately it was fairly dark just now when I came back and neither
Grandmother nor Mother noticed anything.’
He took it off for Musk-to examine. It was only a little burn, about the size of a
finger-print, but clearly visible.
‘It must have been caused by a- spark from your hand-warmer,’ said Musk. ‘It’s
nothing to worry about. We’ll send someone out on the quiet with it immediately to
find a good invisible mender and get it mended for you.’
She wrapped it up and called in one of the old nannies to take it out for them.
‘Tell them it has to be ready by daylight tomorrow. And for heaven’s sake don’t let
Her Old Ladyship or Her Ladyship find out about it!’
The woman was gone a very long time. When she at last returned, she was still
carrying the bundle with the peacock cloak in it.
‘ I’ve tried everywhere—invisible menders, tailors, em?broiderers,
seamstresses—and none of them will touch it. They all say they don’t know what the
material is and don’t want to be responsible.’
‘Oh dear!’ said Musk. ‘What are we going to do now? Well, you lust can’t wear it
tomorrow, that’s all.’
‘But I must,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tomorrow is his actual birthday. Grandmother and
Mother have both said I must. Today was only the first day of the celebrations, not
his actual birthday. Isn’t it just my luck to burn it the very first time I put it on?’
Skybright, who had listened to all this in silence, could con?tain herself no longer and
sat up immediately in bed.
‘Come on, let me have a look. If you weren’t meant to wear it, you won’t wear it.
No good making all this fuss about it now.’
‘There’s something in that,’ said Bao-yu laughing, and handed it to her. He brought
the lamp over so that she could examine it more closely.
‘This is made of “peacock gold”,’ said Skybright. ‘If we could get hold of some of the
thread .and make a little darn with it’ I think it would probably pass.’
‘We’ve got peacock gold thread,’ said Musk. ‘The trouble is that apart from you
there’s no one else here who could do the darning.’
‘I shall just have to make the effort and do it then, shan’t I?’ said Skybright.
‘No, that’s out of the question,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You’ve only just started getting better.
You’re not in a fit state to do sewing yet.’
‘Oh, don’t be such an old woman!’ said Skybright. ‘I know what I’m capable of.’
So saying, she sat up again in bed, knotted up her loosely flowing hair, and drew a
jacket on over her shoulders. Her body felt abnormally light and she was almost
overcome with dizziness. It really did seem as if the effort would be too much for her;
but knowing what a state Bao-yu would be in if the snow-cape was not repaired, she
gritted her teeth, and fighting back the weakness that threatened to engulf her, told
Musk to pinch the yarn and thread a needle for her while she herself took a length of
it and held it against the material.
‘It’s not really a very good match,’ she said, ‘but I don’t suppose it will show very
much when it’s been darned.’
‘I’m sure it will do very nicely,’ said Bao-yu. ‘At all events, we’re not going to be able
to find a Russian tailor to do it for us!’
Skybright began by opening up the seam of the lining underneath the burnt patch so
that she could insert a cup-sized darning mushroom from inside. Having stretched
the material out over the mushroom, she scraped away the charred parts and the
surrounding nap with a razor until the threads were clearly exposed, then, with her
needle and thread, she worked first across in one direction and then at right-angles in
the other until she had filled the hole with a criss-cross darn. Using this as a
foundation, she now began to weave the thread in and out with her needle so as to
Imitate the surrounding pattern. This was the most difficult and exhausting part of
the work. After each couple of stitches she had to stop and examine what she had
done, and after every four or five she had to lean back on the pillow and rest.
Meanwhile Bao-yu fussed around her unceasingly, one moment asking her if she
would like a ‘nice hot drink’, another moment suggesting that she should rest, one
moment fetching a squirrel-skin cloak to put over her shoulders, the next moment a
pillow for her back, until she became quite frantic and had to entreat him to leave
her alone
‘My dear little grandfather—please just go to bed! If you stay up any longer, you’ll
have rings under your eyes in the morning, and that will never dot’
Bao-yu could see that he was exasperating her and made a pretence of settling down
in his bed; but he could not get to sleep. After he had been lying awake for some
time, he heard the chiming clock strike four. Skybright had just completed the
mending and was finishing off the job by carefully teasing the nap out with a little
toothbrush.
‘That’s wonderful,’ said Musk. ‘If you didn’t look at it carefully, you could never tell
it was a darn.’
Bao-yu asked to see.
‘It’s perfect,’ he said. ‘It looks exactly the same as the rest.’
Skybright had been coughing a good deal during the final stages of her task and it
had been all she could do to conclude
it.
‘Anyway, it’s done,’ she said. ‘It doesn’t really look right, but I can’t do any
more—Aiyo!’
With a cry of weariness she sank back, utterly exhausted, upon the bed.
If you wish to know the outcome, please read the chapter which follows.

CHAPTER 53

Ning-guo House sacrifices to the ancestors on New Year’s Eve
And Rong-guo House entertains the whole family on
Fifteenth Night



SEEING that Skybright’s repair of the peacock gold snow cape had so utterly
exhausted her, Bao-yu called in a junior maid to help massage her and for a while
they pummelled her between them. After that they all went to bed; but in less than
no time it seemed to be broad daylight and they had to get up again. Instead of going
straight off to his uncle’s, however, Bao-yu first sent someone to summon Dr Wang.
‘The doctor arrived promptly and proceeded to take Skybright’s pulses. He appeared
to be disconcerted by what he found.
‘Yesterday she seemed to be a little better,’ he said, ‘but this pulse today takes us
right back to where we started from—empty, superficial, faint, constricted. Now why
should that be? She must have been eating or drinking too much. Either that, or she
has been worrying about something. The original attack was not a serious one; but
failure to take care of oneself after perspiration has been induced can be very
serious.’
He went outside and wrote another prescription, which was presently brought in to
Bao-yu. Bao-yu noticed that the sudorifics and decongestants of the earlier
prescription had been omitted and restorative drugs to increase the vitality and
nourish the blood, such as lycoperdon, nipplewort and angelica, had been
substituted. He gave instructions for the medicine to be made up immediately. He
seemed distressed.
‘This is dreadful. If anything should happen to you after this, I shall never forgive
myself.’
Skybright, lying back on her pillow, hooted derisively at his concern:
My dear young Master, just get on with your own affairs and don’t worry about me.
I’m not about to go into a decline, I assure you!’
Bao-yu was in any case obliged to go now; but having held out at his uncle’s place
until the afternoon, he managed to get back to her by pretending that he was feeling
unwell.
Skybright was certainly quite ill. Fortunately she was normally an active, lively sort of
girl, not given to moping and vapours; she had always been sensible—even
abstemious—in her diet; and her constitution was a sound one. The Jias were great
believers in the virtues of fasting. Masters and servants alike were put on a starvation
diet at the slightest hint of a cough or cold, the physic and nursing they received
being considered of only secondary importance to this, and Skybright had been
fasting now for two or three days, ever the influenza began. In addition to this, she
had taken her medicine regularly and, except for the one night’s lapse, had looked
after herself reasonably well. Although the over-exertion set her back a few days, she
was soon on the mend again. And as the new catering arrangements whereby the
cousins now ate in their own apartments made ordering things much easier, Bao-yu
was able to get all sorts of soups and broths made up to aid her recovery.
Omitting details of this convalescence, our story passes on to the return of Aroma,
which occurred shortly after her mother’s funeral. As soon as she got back, Musk told
her all about Trinket and how Skybright had dismissed her first and reported the
dismissal afterwards to Bao-yu. Aroma merely remarked that Skybright had been ‘too
hasty’, but made no further comment.
Li Wan had herself now fallen a victim to the season’s cold; Lady Xing was suffering
from an inflammation of the eyes which necessitated Ying-chun’s and Xiu-yan
attendance on her both mornings and evenings to dress them for her; Mrs Li had
been invited to spend some days with a younger brother and gone off taking Li Wen
and Li Qi with her; and Bao-yu was preoccupied with Aroma, who was still thinking
con?stantly of her mother and liable at any moment to break down, as well as with
Skybright, who had still not entirely recovered. So what with one thing and another,
no one felt much in the mood for writing poetry and one or two of the club’s
fixture-days went by without a meeting.
It was now well into the twelfth month and Lady Wang and Xi-feng were busily
preparing for the New Year. The season of appointments brought news that Wang
Zi-teng had been promoted to the post of Inspector-General of Armies in the Nine
Provinces and that Jia Yu-cun was to become Under Secretary to the President of the
Board of War with occasional duties at Court. Over in the Ning mansion Cousin Zhen
had opened up the Hall of the Ancestors and set his people to work sweeping it,
setting the vessels out in readiness for the New Year sacrifices, and welcoming the
spirits back into the an?cestral tablets. He also had the main hall of the Ning-guo
mansion swept in readiness for the annual ceremonial hanging of the ancestral
portraits. Everyone in both mansions, both high and low, was in a fever of activity.
One morning in the course of these preparations, as You-?shi, who had not long since
risen, was, with the assistance of Jia Rong’s new wife, getting the presents of newly
made clothes ready for sending to Grandmother Jia, a maid came in bearing a trayful
of New Year medallions.
‘It’s from Merry, ma’am. He says that loose silver you gave him the other day was of
several different marks but the total weight was one hundred and fifty-three taels
and thirteen pennyweights and he says they’ve managed to make two hundred and
twenty medallions from it.’
She held out the tray for You-shi to inspect. On it there were medallions shaped like
plum-flowers, crabflower-shaped medallions, medallions with ‘heart’s desire’ rebus
patterns of ingot, brush and sceptre, and others with patterns of aus?picious flowers.


‘Yes,’ said You-shi, ‘they seem to be all right. Tell him to take them inside
immediately.’
The maid went off to do her bidding. Shortly after that Cousin Zhen came in to have
his lunch and Jia Rong’s wife hurried out to avoid him.
‘Have we received the bounty money for the New Year sacrifices yet?’ Cousin Zhen
asked You-shi when they were alone together.
‘I sent Rong to draw it this morning,’ said You-shi.
‘It’s not that we rely on the money exactly,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘but it is after all the
gift of the Emperor and I think we ought to draw it as soon as possible and get it
across to Lady Jia so that it can be used to pay for the offerings. It’s a double blessing
when the gracious favour shown us by His Majesty can be passed on to the ancestors.
However many thousands of our own we were to spend on them, it wouldn’t do
them nearly as much honour as these offerings subsidized by the imperial
bounty—not to mention the advantages that we enjoy as recipients of Imperial
favour. And we have to remember that apart from the one or two great families like
ours who don’t really need this money, there are many, many families of poor
hereditary officials who do actually depend on it for their ancestral sacrifices and
who wouldn’t be able to celebrate New Year properly without it. So you see it really
was extra?ordinarily benevolent and far-seeing of the dynasty to institute this annual
bounty.’
‘Yes, indeed,’ said You-shi.
‘Master Rong is back,’ a servant came in to report while the two of them were still
talking.
‘Tell him to come in,’ said Cousin Zhen
Jia Rong entered carrying a little yellow bag, not as one would normally carry a bag,
but holding it in both hands at shoulder height.
‘You’ve been a long time, haven’t you?’ said Cousin Zhen.
Jia Rong smiled nervously.
‘This year they’re not paying it at the Board of Rites any longer but at the treasury
of the Imperial Victuallers; so having first gone to the Board of Rites, I had to go from
there all the way to the Imperial Victuallers to draw the money. The people at the
Imperial Victuallers’ office all asked after you, by the way. They say they haven’t seen
you for a long time, but they often think about you.’
‘It’s not me they think about but my things,’ said Cousin Zhen with a dry smile.
‘Either that, or they are hoping for an invitation to come round over the New Year.’
He was inspecting the yellow bag as he said this. It had a sealing-slip with the words

PERPETUAL BOUNTY

written on it in large characters. On the other side was the chop of the Department
of Sacrifices of the Board of Rites and some columns of smaller characters:

             Annual grant awarded in perpetuity to Jia Yan, Duke
             of Ning-guo, and Jia Yuan, Duke of Rong-guo, for

This was followed by a cipher in red ink.
After inspecting the yellow bag, Cousin Zhen had his lunch; then, when he had
washed his hands and rinsed his mouth out, he changed into formal hat and boots
and, ordering Jia Rong to follow him with the bag, set off for the other mansion to
report the arrival of the bounty-money, first to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and
then to Jia She and Lady Xing next door. When they got back he took out the money
and ordered the bag to be carried into the Hall of the Ancestors and burnt there in
the great incense-burner in front of the ancestral tablets.
There were further orders now for Jia Rong:
‘I want you to go and ask your Aunt Lian whether she’s decided yet on which days
she’ll be entertaining in the New Year. If she has, get the office to make out a good,
clear list of the dates, so that we don’t have any duplicating this year. Last year
several families got invitations from both of us for the same day, and of course,
people being what they are, instead of realizing that it was a mistake, they assumed
that we had deliberately worked it out between us as an economy.’
Jia Rong hurried off to see Xi-feng, returning presently with the list of dates that his
father had asked for. After run?ning his eye over it, Cousin Zhen handed it to a
servant.
‘Give this to Lai Sheng. Tell him to avoid these dates when he sends out our New
Year invitations.’
He and Jia Rong went on to inspect operations in the hall, where a number of pages
were carrying in and arranging the large screens on which the portraits of the
ancestors were to be hung, and cleaning and polishing the tables and the ritual
vessels of gold and silver which were to be set up in front of them. While they were
thus engaged, a page came in holding a red greetings-card and a schedule containing
some sort of list.
‘Bailiff Wu from Black Mountain village, sir. He’s just arrived.’
‘That old rascal?’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘He’s been long enough getting here!’
Jia Rong took the greetings-card and schedule from the servant, and opening up the
card, held it out for his father to read. Cousin Zhen folded his hands behind his back
and bent over to read the inscription:

Wu Jin-xiao, Bailiff, presents his Humble Compliments
to the
Master and Mistress
and compliments to
The Young Gentlemen and Ladies
wishing you
Wealth, Health and Prosperity
Increase of Pay and Promotion
and
all your Heart’s Desire in the
Coming Year
Cousin Zhen laughed.
‘These country people have an original sense of style.’
‘Never mind the style,’ said Jia Rong, echoing his father’s laughter with obsequious
laughter of his own, ‘just think of all the good luck he is wishing us!’
He opened up the schedule and held it out while Cousin Zhen ran his eye down the
list:

‘Bring him in,’ said Cousin Zhen when he had finished perusing the schedule.
Wu Jin-xiao promptly appeared. He knelt down in the courtyard below and had
already kotowed and called out his greetings before Cousin Then could have him
raised up and brought into the hall.
‘You are still hale and hearty then?’ Cousin Then asked him.
‘Yes, sir, thank you sir,’ said the old man, beaming. ‘I still manage to get about.’
‘Your sons must be quite big fellows by now,’ said Cousin Then. ‘Why don’t you let
them do the travelling for you?’
‘To tell you the truth, sir, I’m so used to the journey, I’d miss it now if I wasn’t to
come. Shouldn’t know what to do with myself. The boys would be only too glad to
come if I’d let them, of course—see what it’s like here “in the Emperor’s shadow” as
we say—but they’re only youngsters yet: I’d be afeared of them having some mishap
on the way. A few years longer and I shan’t need to worry.’
‘How many days have you been on the road?’ said Cousin Then.
‘Well, sir, as you know, there was a lot of snow this year: it must have been lying
three or four foot thick in places. And that sudden thaw we had coming on top of it
made the going very difficult. That must have put us back several days. It’s taken a
month and two days altogether. But I do assure you, sir, seeing that the time was
running out and knowing how anxious you’d be, we made as much speed as we
could.’
‘I was wondering what could have made you so late,’ said Cousin Then. ‘Well, I’ve
been looking at this list of yours. I see you’re holding out on me again this year, you
old devil.’

Wu Jin-xiao advanced a couple of steps—springing, as it were, to his own defence:
‘It’s like this, sir. The harvests this year have been really terrible. From the third
month to the eighth month it rained on and off all the time. I doubt we had six fine
days in a row together. Then in the ninth month we had hall as big as tea?cups. For
fifty miles around, the damage to crops and livestock—and houses and people as
well, for that matter—was terrible. That’s why I haven’t brought you more this year.
That’s the honest truth, sir. You know I wouldn’t lie to you.’
‘I’d reckoned on your bringing me at least five thousand taels,’ said Cousin Then,
frowning. ‘What am I supposed to do with an amount like this? We have only eight or
nine farms now and of those eight or nine two have declared themselves disaster
areas this year and aren’t contributing anything. With you holding back on me too, I
might as well give up celebrat?ing New Year altogether.’
‘Your lands have done better than some,’ said Wu Jin-xiao. ‘Take my cousin’s place.
That’s only thirty mile from where I am, but my word, what a difference! My cousin
manages eight farms for your relations at the other House. They’ve got several times
as much land as you, but the vittles he’s brought them this year are no more than
this lot here, and their cash yield on sales is no more than two or three thousand.
Now they really ha~ got something to make a fuss about.’
‘It’s true,’ said Cousin Then. ‘We’re not too badly off on this side. At least we
haven’t got any new major commitments outside our regular annual expenditure. For
us it’s a question of spending a bit more freely when we’re flush and economiz?ing a
bit when things are tighter. And even in the case of these New Year expenses, I
suppose I could cut down on them if I really had to. It would simply be a question of
brazening it out. But with our Rong-guo cousins it’s different. They’ve had all these
new expenses during the past few years, none of which were optional, but no new
source of income to set against them. Which means that for the past year or two
they’ve had to start eating into their capital. If you folk can’t help them to make up
the deficit, who else is there they turn to?’
‘I know they’ve got a lot on their plate,’ said Wu Jin-xiao with a knowing smile, ‘but
it can’t all be outgoings, can it? There must be something coming in as well. Surely
Her Grace and old Live-For-Ever must give them a hand-out once in a while?’
Cousin Then turned to Jia Rong with a laugh.
‘You heard that? Rich, isn’t it?’
Jia Rong tittered.
‘What does a countryman like you living at the back of beyond know about such
matters? You don’t suppose Her Grace has handed them the keys of the Emperor’s
treasury, do you? She’s not her own mistress, even if she wanted to. She does give
presents, of course, but it’s only on birthdays and feastdays and the like and never
more than a few lengths of figured satin or some curios or knick-knacks. Even when
she gives money, at the very most it will be a hundred gold. Now say a hundred gold
is worth a thousand silver taels—it can’t be much more than that—what possible
good can a thousand taels do them, when during each of the past two years they’ve
been forced to draw on their capital to the tune of several thousands a year? During
the first of those two years they had the Visitation—including the building of that
great garden. Just imagine what that must have cost them. Another two years like
these last two with another Visitation thrown in and they’ll be cleaned out!’
‘These simple country souls see “the bright outside but not the dark within”,’ said
Cousin Zhen. ‘The situation our Rong-?guo cousins are in is like the proverbial
chime-hammer made of phellodendron wood: imposing to look at but bitter inside.’
‘You can tell they really are hard-up,’ said Jia Rong half? jokingly. ‘The other day I
heard Auntie Lian plotting with Faithful to steal some of Lady Jia’s things to use as
security for a loan.’
‘No, I think that was merely our Feng being her usual artful self,’ said Cousin Then,
laughing. ‘They’re still not that poor. I expect she has noticed how much they have
been spending. beyond their means and is planning some economy or other. What
you overheard would simply have been her way of let?ting people know how
hard-up they are and preparing them for some cuts. I’ve got a rough idea of how
their finances stand at present and I assure you that they aren’t quite as desperate as
that yet.’
Concluding the conversation on this more reassuring note, Cousin Then gave Wu
Jin-xiao into the charge of the servants with instructions that he was to be properly
looked after and entertained. Our narrative does not follow the old man into the
servants’ quarters, however, but remains in the hall with Cousin Then.
Cousin Then had a portion of the things that Wu Jin-xiao had brought set aside to be
used as offerings to the ancestors; he had another portion set aside for sending to
Rong-guo House; and while Jia Rong attended to its delivery, he person?ally
supervised the selection of a third portion which he intended to keep for his own use.
What remained he had piled up in orderly heaps on the pavement beneath the hall
terrace to be shared out among the junior members of the clan, who were forthwith
invited to come and collect their shares.
At that point a large consignment of things arrived from the other mansion, most of
them things to be used in the an?cestral sacrifices, but some of them for Cousin Then
himself. Having given orders for their disposal, Cousin Then went back to his
supervision of the polishing and furniture-shifting in the hall. When that work was
completed, he put on a lynx-skin coat and went out, still in his slippers, on to the
terrace, where, having found himself a warm place under the eaves, he got the
servants to spread out a wolfskin rug for him so that he could sit there and watch the
young clansmen as they came to collect their shares. He noticed that Jia Qin was
among them.
‘What are you doing here?’ he called out to him. ‘Who told you to come?’
Jia Qin came over and stood in front of him, arms held submissively at his sides.
‘I heard that you were having a family share-out, Uncle, so I came along without
waiting to be called.’
‘These things I’m giving away now are intended for those of your uncles and
cousins who haven’t got jobs or private incomes to support them,’ said Cousin Then.
‘During the years when you were unemployed yourself, I used to give you a share of
the New Year things. But you aren’t unemployed now: you’ve got that supervisor’s
job that my Rong-guo cousins gave you, looking after those young nuns in the family
temple. Not only have you got a salary of your own, but you control all the nuns’
allowances as well. Yet still you come here for my things. You are too greedy. And just
look at you! No one would think from your appearance that you had money to spend
and a responsible position. You used to have the excuse that you had no money, but
what excuse have you got now? You look even more disreputable now than you did
when you were unemployed!’
‘I’ve got a big family to support,’ said Jia Qin. ‘I have a lot of expenses.’
‘Humbug!’ said Cousin Then. ‘I know what you get up to in that temple of yours,
don’t think I don’t! Once you set foot in that place, you are the master and nobody
there can gainsay you. With money to spend and the rest of us a long way away in
the city, you can do exactly as you like: invite the local riff raff in every night to
gamble with you and fill the place with your kept women and fancy boys. So having
squandered all the money and reduced yourself to the disgraceful state I see you in
now, you have the effrontery to try and get something out of me. All you are likely to
get out of me, young man, is a good stout stick across the shoulders! And when this
holiday is over, I shall make it my business to have a word with your Uncle Lian and
see to it that he has you recalled.’
Jia Qin reddened, but dared not say anything.
A servant came up then to report:
‘Someone with a present from the Prince of Bei-jing, sir. Two scrolls and a
perfume-bag.’
Cousin Then turned to Jia Rong.
‘Go and entertain him for me. Tell him I’m out.’
Jia Rong hurried off.
Cousin Zhen then dismissed Jia Qin, and having presided over the distribution until
all the things had been taken, re?turned to his own apartment to have his dinner
with You-shi.
Concerning the rest of that day and the night which fol?lowed our narrative is silent.
The day after that was even busier. But to give further details of these preparations
would be tedious. Suffice it to say that by the twenty-ninth of the twelfth month they
had been completed. In both mansions new door-gods had been pasted up on all the
doors, the inscribed boards at the sides and over the tops of gateways had been
repainted, and fresh ‘good luck’ slips—auspicious couplets written in the best
calligraphy on strips of scarlet paper—had been pasted up at the sides of all the
entrances. In the Ning-guo mansion the central doors of the main outer gate, of the
ornamental gate, of the outer reception hall, of the pavilion-gate, of the inner
reception hall, of the triple gate dividing the inner from the outer parts of the
mansion, and of the inner ornamental gate were all thrown Open, so that a way was
opened up from the street right through into the family hall inside. Red lanterns on
tall scarlet stands lined either side of this route. At dusk, when the candles in them
were lit, they took on the appearance of two long, parallel serpents of light,
undulating slightly where they ascended or descended the steps of terraces.
Next day, the last of the Old Year, Grandmother Jia and any of the Jia ladies who
possessed patents of nobility attired themselves in the court dress appropriate to
their rank and were borne in procession to the Palace, Grandmother Jia at the head
in a palanquin carried by eight bearers, to make their kotows to the Imperial
Concubine and felicitate her on the successful conclusion of the year. On their return
from the banquet which she gave them, their chairs were set down out?side the
pavilion-gate of the Ning-guo mansion, where those of the younger Jia males who
had not escorted them to the Palace were lined up on either side of the gateway
waiting to receive them. When the ladies had all alighted, the young men conducted
them on foot to the Jia family’s Hall of the An?cestors.
Bao-qin had never been inside this part of the mansion before. She was being
allowed in on this occasion by virtue of her recent adoption into the family and was
anxious to take in every detail in order that she might retain as accurate an
im?pression of it as possible.
The Jia family’s Hall of the Ancestors was in a separate courtyard of its own in the
west part of Ning-guo House, away from the more domestic parts of the mansion—a
court?yard that was entered through an imposing five-frame gateway behind a
black-lacquered wooden paling. An inscription in large characters hung over the
central arch of the gate:

ANCESTRAL TEMPLE
OF THE
JIA FAMILY
with a column of smaller characters in the lower left hand part of the board
indicating that the calligrapher was a direct descendant in the sixty-somethingth
generation of the Sage Confucius. A long couplet from the brush of the same
calli?grapher occupied the two vertical boards at the arch’s sides:

                 With loyal blood poured out willingly upon the ground
                 a myriad subjects pay tribute to their benevolent rulers

             For famous deeds lauded resoundingly to the skies
                  a hundred generations offer sacrifices to their heroic ancestors

Inside the gate a raised white marble walk shaded by an avenue of venerable pines
and cypresses led up to a terrace on which ancient bronze tripods were ranged. Over
the entrance to the temple’s vestibule, whose penthouse-roof swept forwards from
the main building’s fa?ade, hung a board framed in a carved and gilded border of
nine interlacing dragons and in?scribed in the Late Emperor’s calligraphy with the
following words:

HIS MINISTERS ARE AS SHINING STARS

The vertical inscriptions on either side were in the same Im?perial hand:

             Their achievements outshone the celestial luminaries
             Their fame is reflected in the generations that come after them

The board over the entrance to the main hall of the temple was framed by two
contending dragons and its inscription was of incised characters infilled in green.
Both it and the matching couplet below it were in the calligraphy of the reigning
sovereign:

HONOUR THE DEAD AND KEEP THEIR MEMORIAL

             Their sons and grandsons enjoy the fruits of their blessedness
             The common people recall Ning and Rong with kindness

Beyond the flickering brilliance of many lights and the glint and sheen of drapes and
hangings Bao-qin could make out some of the spirit tablets of the ancestors, but not
very clearly.
By ancient custom the menfolk were divided in ranks to left and right of the hall so
that each generation was on a different side from the one which followed it, fathers
and sons separ?ated, grandfathers and grandsons together. Jia Jing presided over the
sacrifice with Jia She acting as his assistant; Cousin Then held the drink-offering; Jia
Lian and Jia Cong the silk-offering; Bao-yu carried the incense; Jia Chang and Jia Ling
unrolled the kneeling-mat in front of the great incense-burner Then the black-coated
musicians struck up and the ceremony began.: the threefold offering of the Cup, the
standings, kneel?ings and prostrations, the burning of the silk-offering, the
libation—every movement precisely in time to the solemn strains of the music. The
music ceased at the same time as the ceremony, and the participants filed out and,
grouping them?selves round Grandmother Jia, conducted her to the main hall of the
Ning-guo mansion where, under the richly-embroidered frieze which hung high in
front of them, against a background of brilliantly-decorated screens, high above the
smoking in?cense and flickering candles of the altar, the portraits of the ancestors
hung, those of the ducal siblings, Ning-guo and Rong-guo, resplendent in dragon
robes and jade-encrusted belts, in the centre and somewhat raised above the rest.
The men ranged themselves in ascending order of seniority in the space between the
hall and the ornamental gate, so that the two most junior ones, Jia Xing and Jia Zhi,
were just inside the gate and the two most senior ones, Jia jing and Jia She, were at
the top of the terrace steps and under the eaves of the hall. The womenfolk of the
family were ranged inside the hall in corresponding ranks but in reverse order: that is
to say, the most junior were nearest the threshold and the most senior furthest
inside the hall, but whereas the senior male in a generation was at the east end of his
row, the senior female in the same generation would be at the west end of hers, and
vice versa. The male domestics of all ages were ranged in the courtyard on the
further side of the ornamental gate.
The manner of making the offerings was as follows: Each ‘course’ was passed from
hand to hand by the servants until it reached the ornamental gate. There it was
received by Jia Xing and Jia Zhi and passed on from hand to and until it reached Jia
Jing at the top of the terrace steps. Jia Rong, as senior grandson of the senior branch
of the family, was permitted, alone of all the males, to stand inside the threshold
with the women. He received the dishes from his grandfather Jia Jing’s hands and
passed them to his wife, Hu-shi. Hu-shi passed them to the row ending in Xi-feng and
You-shi, who passed them forwards to Lady Wang standing at the side of the altar.
Lady Wang then put them into the hands of Grandmother Jia, who raised them up
reverently towards the portraits before laying them down on the altar in front of her.
Lady Xing stood to the west of the altar facing eastwards and helped her lay them
down. When meat, vegetables, rice, soup, cakes, wine and tea had all been
transmitted to the altar by this human chain and offered up there by Grandmother
Jia and her two daughters-?in-law, Jia Rong withdrew and took up his position next to
Jia Qin in the courtyard below, at the head of the most junior generation of Jia family
males.
Now came the most solemn part of the ceremony. As Grandmother Jia, clasping a
little bundle of burning joss sticks with both her hands, knelt down for the
incense-offering, the entire congregation of men and women, rank upon rank of
them, close-packed as flowers in a flower-bed, knelt down in perfect time with her
and proceeded to go through the motions of the Great Obeisance. This was done
with such silent concentration that, from five-frame hall and three-frame vestibule,
from portico and terrace, terrace steps and courtyard, for some minutes nothing
could be heard but the faint tinkling made by jade girdle-pendants and tiny golden
bells and the soft scrape and scuffle of cloth-soled boots and shoes.
The ceremony over, Jia Jing, Jia She and the rest of the menfolk hurried back to the
Rong-guo mansion so that they could be waiting there in readiness to make their
kotows to Grandmother Jia on her return.
In You-shi’s main reception-room, whither the ladies re?paired now from the hall, the
floor had been entirely covered with a great red carpet and a huge gold cloisonné
incense-burner with a loach-lipped rim and three massive legs shaped like the trunks
of elephants stood in the middle.
In the centre of the kang—also new-carpeted, but in scarlet—a dark-red back-rest
had been placed with a design showing a couchant dragon coiled around the
character for ‘longevity’. Large bolsters of the same colour and with the same design
on them had been placed as arm-rests at right-angles to it; for extra warmth a black
fox-fur had been draped around the top of it, and there was a white fox-fur mg
between the bolsters, for sitting on. When Grandmother Jia had been installed on
this furry throne, several old great aunts were invited to sit on fur rugs that had been
spread out on the kang to left and right of it. Lady Xing, Lady Wang and other ladies
of their generation were installed on fur rugs on a smaller kang in an alcove-room to
the side of the main kang and discreetly separated from it by an openwork wooden
screen. On the floor below, in two facing rows, were a dozen carved lacquer chairs,
on which Bao-qin and the other cousins were invited to sit. They had chair-backs and
seat-covers of squirrel, and large copper foot-warmers in place of footstools.
You-shi and her daughter-in-law Hu-shi now appeared with tea-trays in their hands,
and while You-shi offered tea to Grandmother Jia, Hu-shi served the old aunties.
After that You-shi passed into the alcove and served tea to Lady Xing and the other
ladies on the smaller kang, and Hu-shi served the cousins sitting in chairs below.
Xi-feng, Li Wan and a few other young married women of their generation, debarred
from taking tea either with the elder ladies or with their young unmarried cousins,
stood idly by, on the floor below the kang, ‘in attendance’. Lady Xing and her group,
as soon as they had finished drinking their tea, rose and moved over to where
Grandmother Jia was sitting on the kang so that they too might be ‘in attendance’.
After exchanging a few words with the other old ladies while she sipped her tea,
Grandmother Jia gave orders for her palanquin to be made ready. At once Xi-feng
climbed up on to the kang and began helping her to her feet.
‘But we’ve already prepared dinner for you here,’ said You?-shi. ‘You never stay
with us for dinner on New Year’s Eve. Won’t you make an exception just this once?
Surely my cater?ing can’t be all that inferior to Feng’s?’
Xi-feng continued to help Grandmother Jia from the kang. ‘Come on, Grannie, let’s be
getting home! Pay no attention to lien’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘You’re so busy with the sacrifices,’ she said. ‘You’re worked off your feet as it is; I’m
sure you don’t want the bother of feeding me as well. Besides, in past years when I
haven’t stayed, you have Sent the food over to me. Why don’t you do that again this
year? I don’t feel like eating very much now; but if you send it over, I shall be able to
save it up for tomorrow, and then I shall be able to eat more of it than I could now.’
This made everyone laugh.
‘See that you get someone thoroughly dependable to sit up and keep an eye on the
candles tonight,’ Grandmother Jia said by way of parting admonition. ‘Where fire is
concerned, one can’t afford to take chances.’
You-shi, escorting her meanwhile from the room, assured her that she would do so.
At the pavilion-gate You-shi and the other ladies hid them-selves behind the
gate-screen from the eyes of the waiting menservants while Grandmother Jia got into
her palanquin. Pages of the Ning-guo mansion went ahead of the bearers and, as
they approached the outer gate, directed them through the centre of its three
gateways. Lady Xing and Lady Wang fol?lowed in their less imposing conveyances,
accompanied by You-shi, who was also going over to the other mansion.
Outside, while they were being borne in a westerly direction down the street, the
ladies could see the achievements, in?signia and musical instruments (bells, gongs,
stone-chimes and drums hung in magnificently carved, painted and tasselled stands)
of the Dukes of Ning-guo and Rong-guo, those of the Duke of Ning-guo along the
eastern half of the street outside the south wall of the Ning-guo property, and those
of his brother-duke outside the Rong-guo wall to its west.
As in the other mansion, the centre-gates throughout Rong-?guo House were all
thrown open so that a way was clear from the outer gate right through to the Hall of
Exalted Felicity inside. But this time, instead of going through to the pavilion-gate and
getting out there, they turned left after the outer reception hall and were carried to
the main reception hall in Grandmother Jia’s part of the mansion. The others
assembled round the old lady as they got out of their sedans and followed her into
the hall. Here, too, everything had been transformed: brilliantly embroidered screens
and cushions specially brought out for the occasion and an incense-burner set down
in the middle of the room from which emanated delicious odours of pine and cedar
and Hundred Blend aromatic.
As soon as Grandmother Jia was seated, a venerable nannie came up to her to report
that ‘the old ladies had arrived to make their kotow’ and she hurriedly got up again
and ad?vanced to welcome two or three elderly female relations who had just come
into the hall. A good deal of polite tussling ensued, accompanied on both sides by
laughter and protesta?tions, as Grandmother Jia took the hands of each old lady in
turn and, while the old ladies pretended that they were struggling to kneel, made a
great show of struggling to pre?vent them—for although Grandmother Jia was their
senior, they were in the same generation as her and too elderly to be allowed to
kotow in earnest. They sat down for a while after that and took a cup of tea; then
Grandmother Jia saw them out, but no farther than the inner ornamental gate.
When she had returned and was once more enthroned on the principal seat in the
hall, Jia Jing and Jia She came forward with all the menfolk in the family in rows
behind them to make their kotow.
‘You all do so much for me during the year,’ Grandmother Jia protested. ‘Can’t we
forget about the kotow?’
But nobody heeded her. Rank upon rank of them, the males in one large group and
the females in another, knelt down together and bowed their foreheads to the
ground. After that folding chairs were brought and put down in a row to left and right
of Grandmother Jia’s seat and the next most senior members of the family sat down
and received their kotows, and so on by order of seniority downwards, until all but
the most junior members of the family had been kotowed to; but now even their
turn arrived and they too were allowed to sit down as the domestics of both
households, men-servants and women-servants, pages and maids, came in by order
of their various ranks and duties and made their kotows to their em?ployers.
After that the New Year’s Eve wish-penny was distributed to servants and
children—gold or silver medallions in little embroidered purses—and the New Year’s
love-feast was laid, tables on the east side of the hall for men and boys, tables on the
west side for girls and women. There was herb-flavoured New Year’s Eve wine and
love-feast soup, there were lucky-?cakes and wish-puddings; and when all had eaten
and drunk, Grandmother Jia rose and went into an inner room to change out of her
Court dress, which she had all this time been wear?ing. This was a signal for the
others present to disperse.
As darkness came on, offerings of cakes and burning joss? sticks were made in front
of all the Buddha-shrines and in all the little niches of the Kitchen God, who is
welcomed back this night from his annual trip aloft. In the main courtyard, outside
Lady Wang’s apartment, an ‘altar to heaven and earth’ was set up - a long table on
which offerings of sticky fried honey-sticks and fresh apples and steamed wheat-flour
cakes and other goodies had been built up, layer upon layer, into a little pagoda of
offerings in front of a large colour-print representing the whole host of heaven (or as
much of it as the artist had been able to fit in). Great horn lanterns hung at either
side of the main entrance to Prospect Garden to illuminate the gateway, and
innumerable standard lamps lit up its alley-ways and courtyards and walks. As for the
inhabitants of the mansion, all of them, both masters and servants, seemed, in their
dazzling holiday array, like walking flower-gardens of brilliant embroidery and
brocade. And all night long a confused hubbub of talking and shouting and laughter
arose, punctuated by the continual, unceasing pops and bangs of exploding
firecrackers.
At four o’clock in the morning, as the drums of the fifth watch were sounding,
Grandmother Jia and the other ladies once more got into their court dresses and
were borne in pro?cession to the Palace, this time to felicitate Yuan-chun on the
advent of the New Year. Livened footmen walked ahead of them carrying the full
paraphernalia to which Grandmother Jia’s rank entitled her. Once more Yuan-chun
feasted them; once more, on their return from the Palace, they made offer?ings to
the ancestors in their shrine in the Ning-guo mansion; and once more, on returning
to her own apartment in Rong-?guo House, Grandmother Jia received the
prostrations of the assembled family. As soon as that was over, she changed out of
her court clothes and declared that she was going to rest, refusing to see any of the
friends and relations who now began arriving in great numbers to offer their New
Year felicitations, and spending her time either quietly conversing with Aunt Xue and
Mrs Li or, as an occasional diversion, playing games of cards or Racing Go with Bao-yu
and the girls.
But Lady Wang and Xi-feng, on both this and each of the seven or eight days which
followed, were kept busy entertain?ing the guests whom the family had invited to
drink their New Year wine. In both the reception hall and the courtyard out?side it
there were plays to watch and tables at which the un?ending stream of visitors could
sit for a while and eat and drink while they watched them.
And no sooner was that lot of entertaining over than another lot had to be prepared
for as the First Moon waxed greater and the Lantern Festival drew near. Again the
Ning and Rong mansions were gay with lanterns and decorations. On the eleventh of
the month Jia She entertained Grand-mother Jia and the rest of the family and on the
twelfth it was Cousin Zhen’s turn to play host, while for several days run?ning Lady
Wang and Wang Xi-feng were most of the time out visiting one or other of the
innumerable families from whom they bad received invitations.
On the evening of the fifteenth Grandmother Jia had tables laid for a feast in her big
‘new’ reception hall—the scene of Xi-feng’s fateful birthday-feast. A stage was set up
for a troupe of child-actors which she had specially hired for this occasion, and both
the stage and hall were hung all over with lanterns of every imaginable shape and
colour. When her preparations were completed, she summoned all her children and
grandchildren, nephews and nieces, great-nephews and great-nieces to a family
feast.
As a matter of fact it is not strictly true that all of them were invited. Jia Jing was, for
religious reasons, a total abstainer from meat and strong drink, so he was not invited.
Obligations to the dead rather than to the living had brought him back for the holiday,
and on the seventeenth, two days after this, as soon as the last of the ancestral
sacrifices was over, he returned to his Taoist monastery outside the city and the
briefly inter?rupted pursuit of immortality. Meanwhile, when not actually engaged in
discharging ceremonial duties, he spent all the time on his own in a quiet,
out-of-the-way corner of the mansion, in a state of incommunicado with the other
members of the family.
And Jia She, although he was invited, excused himself as soon as he had received a
party-gift from his mother. She knew that he felt uncomfortable in her presence and
did not attempt to detain him. Back in his own quarters, surrounded by cronies and
dependants, he could drink and admire the lan?terns while beautiful young women
played and sang for his delectation:

         Ears with pipes and songs beguiled,
         Eyes by silk skirts hypnotized.


—A different scene altogether from the one he had just left.
But let us return to the latter—to the reception hall in Grandmother Jia’s rear
courtyard, where a covered stage had been erected to accommodate the players.
Inside the hall some dozen or more tables had been laid facing outwards towards the
stage. They were arranged in a fan shape, with the two central tables in the place of
honour at the back and the rest of them raying out forwards to left and right of them.
At the side of each table a smaller, ornamental table had been placed on which were
arranged
1. a little three-piece incense set (a vase, a cassolette and a tripod, all made on a
miniature scale out of metal) in which Hundred Blend aromatic—a gift from the
Palace—was burn?ing;
2. a porcelain dish, eight inches long, four or five inches wide and two or three inches
deep, containing a miniature landscape made out of stones and mosses;
3. a small japanned tea-tray on which was one of Grand?mother Jia’s best china
teacups and a little individual mille fiori teapot in which choicest tea was brewing;
4. a little table-screen of red silk gauze, embroidered with flowers and appropriate
lines of ‘grass character’ verse, framed in a delicately carved pierced-work
sandalwood frame;*
5. a vase (each one a collector’s piece and each different from the rest) containing
the three friends winter’ or riches in a jade hall’ or some other flower arrangement,
mostly of fresh flowers that had been specially forced for the occasion.
The two tables in the place of honour at the back were occupied by Aunt Xue and
Mrs Li. To their left, at the head of the row of tables radiating outwards towards the
east side of the hall, there was a large, low wooden settle with a carved pierced-work
back of interlacing dragons, which had

* Stone’s Note to Reader:
These screens were embroidered by a Soochow girl called Hui-niang, who, as
member of a highly-cultivated Service family and an accomplished amateur painter
and calligrapher, embroidered only occasionally for her own diversion and not as a
means of making money. As the flowers embroidered on them were all copied from
flower-paintings by famous masters, their design and colouring were far superior to
the cruder, more garish productions of professional embroiderers; and the
accompanying verses, all chosen with impeccable taste from a wide range of literary
sources, were executed in black embroidery-silk with such consummate skill that
every hook and squiggle, every variation in thickness of line, every join and break in
the brush-written ‘grass script’ calligraphy was exactly reproduced, not mangled and
deformed as in the stilted, wooden attempts at copying of the commercial
embroiderer.
Since Hui-niang did not depend on her embroidery for a living, speci?mens of it,
despite its great fame, have always been hard to come by. Even among the rich and
great there are very few households which can boast a specimen. Such as do exist
are referred to by collectors as ‘Hui em?broidery’. But what are sometimes sold as
specimens of ‘Hui embroidery’ today invariably turn out to be imitations deliberately
made to take in the inexpert buyer. The real Hui-niang died tragically at the age of
eighteen, and there are in fact no genuine specimens of her work now to be had,
since the few houses which posse as a piece or two hold on to them tena?ciously and
refuse to part with them to would-be purchasers. Indeed, if a genuine specimen of
Hui-niang’s work were ever to come upon the market, its value would be incalculable.
The Jia family originally possessed three, of which two had been presented as a gift
to the Emperor only a year previously, leaving this set of sixteen little table-screens,
to which Grandmother Jia was so much attached that she kept them always in her
own apartment, unwilling that they should remain with the stock of objects
commonly drawn on for the family’s entertainment of guests, and only rarely, on
occasions of her own devising, brought them out to be admired.
Stone
been put there for Grandmother Jia to lie on. It was furnished with a back-rest and
bolsters and was large enough to have a fur rug spread out on it and still leave room
at one end for a small, exquisitely gilded table of foreign make on which had been
placed a teapot, a teacup, a spittoon, a napkin and, among various other small
objects, an eyeglass-case. Grandmother Jia rested with her feet up on the settle and,
after talking for a while with the company, took out the eyeglasses from their case
and looked through them at the stage.
‘I do hope you will forgive me for lying down like this in your presence,’ she
apologized to Aunt Xue and Mrs Li. ‘It’s very rude of me, I know, but I’m getting so
rheumaticky in my old age?
She made Amber get up on to the settle beside her and massage her legs by gently
pounding them with a ‘maiden’s fist’—a sort of short-handled mallet with a padded
leather head.
No feaster’s table with cover and drapes had been put in front of the settle, only the
little ornamental table with the table-screen and the incense set and vase of flowers.
The very elegant, somewhat larger table of normal height which would have been
hers if she had been sitting up with the rest had been placed somewhat to the left of
the settle and laid with wine-cups, soup-spoons and chopsticks for four. It was
occupied by Bao-qin, Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-yu. Although she could not sit with
them, Grandmother Jia kept up a pretence that they were eating together: each dish
as it arrived would be submitted to her inspection, and if she fancied it, would be
placed on the little table at her elbow; then, when she had tasted it, it would be
removed and set down in front of the four young people for them to finish.
After Grandmother Jia and her four grandchildren, the next along on the east side
was Lady Xing; after her came Lady Wang, then You-shi, then Li Wan, then Xi-feng,
and lastly Jia Rong’s wife, Hu-shi. Along the west side Bao-chai came first, next to her
mother, then Li Wen, then Li Qi, then Xiu-yan, then Ying-chun, then Tan-chun and
then Xi-chun.
Red-tasselled glass lanterns hung in rows from the beams overhead to left and right
of the diners. In front of them, on each of their tables, was an ingenious light
consisting of a flower-shaped candle attached to the base of a reflector in the form of
a vertical lotus leaf. These lotus leaves, though made of metal, were so skillfully
engraved and enamelled that they looked almost real. They were attached to their
metal stands by means of a swivel, so that the beams of the candle could be
concentrated in any direction desired. When all the reflectors were simultaneously
directed towards the stage, the diners’ view of the players was wonderfully
improved.
The wooden partitions with their window-lattices and doors which normally
separated the hall from the verandah had been removed and great palace lanterns of
glass, whose elaborately carved wooden frames were hung with strings of crimson
tassels, were suspended at intervals in the space thus created. More rows of
lanterns—lanterns of every kind of material and design— horn lanterns, glass
lanterns, gauze lanterns, lanterns of Yunnan glitter-glass, embroidered ones, painted
ones, lan?terns with cut-outs of paper or silk in them, hung in lines under the
verandah eaves, both inside and outside the archi?traves, and from the eaves of the
loggias on either side of the courtyard.
The tables on the verandah were all occupied by males: Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia
Huan, Jia Cong, Jia Rong, Jia Qin, Jia Yun, Jia Ling and Jia Chang.
Although Grandmother Jia had sent invitations by word of mouth to every clansman
and clanswoman residing in the city, some of them were too elderly to stand up to
the noise and excitement of a party, some were unable to come because they had no
one to look after the house for them while they were away, some had intended to
come but were prevented from doing so by illness, some stayed away from envy of
their richer clansmen or because they were ashamed of their own poverty, others
because they could not stand Xi-feng, and yet others because they were so unused to
company and in?capacitated by shyness that they dared not come—in short,
although the clan was a numerous one, for one reason or another, of all those invited
the only female guest who turned up was Lou-shi, mother of Bao-yu’s former
classmate, the intrepid little Jia Jun, who came bringing Jia Jun with her, and the only
male ones were those who had found employ?ment with the family under Xi-feng’s
auspices and were there-fore obliged to put in an appearance: Jia Qin, Jia Yun, Jia
Chang and Jia Ling. Yet even with the absence of so many who had been invited from
outside, for a family party the company was a large one.
Presently, while they all sat watching the players, Lin Zhi?-xiao’s wife came into the
hall leading six other women, each pair of whom were carrying between them a
small kang-table covered with a red felt top on which was a bundle of strung cash:
hundreds and hundreds of newly-minted copper coins, specially chosen for size and
quality, fastened together by a single long cord of crimson silk. Under the direction of
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife two of these tables were set down in front of Mrs Li and Aunt Xue
and the third one beside Grandmother Jia’s settle.
‘Do it in the middle, where everyone can see’ said Grand?mother Jia.
The women all knew what was expected of them. Setting the tables down in the
centre of the hall, they simultaneously undid the ends of the crimson cords with
which the money was fastened and began pulling them out so that the coins tumbled
in heaps upon the tables.
The play being performed on this occasion was The House in Pin-kang Lane, and the
actors had just come to the end of that section of it called ‘Meeting in the Sickroom’.
The hero Yu Shu-ye, having at last met the love of his life only to be called by stern
duty from her side, had just left the stage in chagrin. At this point the child-actor
playing the part of his little page Leopard Boy, observing what was going on in the
hall, began to extemporize:
‘You can go off in a huff if you like; but today is the fifteenth of the first month and
did Lady Jia of Rong-guo House is holding a family party; so what lam going to do is to
get on this horse and gallop there as quickly as I can and ask them for some
sweeties!’
This caused Grandmother Jia and the rest of the audience to burst out laughing.
‘That’s a sharp little fellow,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘How sweet!’
‘And he’s barely nine,’ said Xi-feng.
‘Barely nine!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And being able to come out with it so pat!’
She nodded in the direction of the waiting women.
‘Largesse!’
Three of the women had already provided themselves with small shallow baskets in
readiness for this order. At the word of command they walked up to the little tables,
shovelled up basketfuls of coins from the heaped-up money, and took them outside
to the foot of the stage which Leopard Boy had just vacated.
‘Largesse from Lady Jia, Mrs Xue and Mrs Li for Leopard Boy to buy himself some
sweets with,’ said one of the women.
The three of them then discharged the contents of their baskets upon the stage. The
money landed with a mighty clatter and at once the whole stage was covered with
shining pennies.
Cousin Then had ordered his own pages to have a large flat basket of money ready
for his own largesse to the players.
But you will have to wait for the next volume, gentle reader, in order to find out
whether they received it.

CHAPTER 54

Lady Jia ridicules the cliches of romantic fiction
And Wang Xi-feng emulates the filial antics
of Lao Lai-zi



TO CONTINUE OUR STORY:

Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian had secretly instructed their pages to have a large
flat-bottomed basket of largesse-money in readiness, and when they heard
Grandmother Jia call out ‘Largesse!’, they told the pages to take this basket and
empty it onto the stage. The money showered down on the boards with a
tremendous ringing clatter, which greatly delighted the old lady.
The two men now rose to their feet. A page hurried forward and handed Jia Lian a
silver kettle of freshly-heated wine on a tray. Taking the kettle, Jia Lian followed his
cousin into the hall. Cousin Zhen went first to Mrs Li, bowed, took her wine-cup and,
turning back, handed it to Jia Lian to fill. Then he did the same for Aunt Xue. The two
ladies stood up, meanwhile, politely demurring:
‘Please, gentlemen, go back to your seats! You are too polite!’
With the exception of the four senior ladies - Aunt Xue, Mrs Li, Lady Xing and Lady
Wang - all the females present now left their seats and stood, hands at their sides,
while Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian went over to the couch on which Grandmother Jia
reclined. As it was rather a low one, the two men knelt to serve her. The other males,
who had followed them into the hall and were standing a little behind them drawn
up in their order of seniority, with Jia Cong at their head, seeing Cousin Zhen and Jia
Lian kneel, knelt down in a row behind them, whereupon Bao-yu hurriedly rose from
his chair and knelt down as well. Xiang-yun nudged him, amused.


‘What do you want to kneel down with them for?’ she whispered. ‘If you’re feeling
so polite all of a sudden, it would be more to the point to get up and serve everyone
your-self.’
‘So I shall, presently,’ Bao-yu whispered back at her.
The two men had now finished serving Grandmother Jia and gone on to serve Lady
Xing and Lady Wang.
‘What about the young ladies?’ Cousin Zhen inquired when these last two had
been attended to.
‘No, no, go and sit down now I’ Grandmother Jia and the senior ladies cried. ‘Spare
them the formality.’
At this Cousin Zhen and the other males withdrew.
It was now about ten o’clock and the play being performed
- the ‘Feast of Lanterns’ section from The Orphan’s Revenge -had reached a climax of
noise and excitement. Bao-yu tried to slip out unnoticed under cover of the din, but
his grand-mother had spotted him.
‘Where are you going?’ she called. ‘There are a lot of fire?works about outside.
Mind a piece of burning touch-paper doesn’t fall on you and set you alight!’
‘I’m not going very far,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll be back directly.’
Grandmother Jia ordered some of the old nannies present to go after him and see
that he was all right. Observing that he had only Musk and Ripple and a couple of
little junior maids in attendance, she asked what had become of Aroma.
‘That girl is getting above herself,’ she said. ‘Sending the younger maids to stand in
for her! - What next?’
Lady Wang rose hastily in Aroma’s defence.
‘It is only a few days since her mother died. She is still in mourning for her mother.
It wouldn’t be right for her to go out in company yet.’
Grandmother Jia nodded, but seemed to have second thoughts:
‘That’s all very well, but bereavement shouldn’t make any difference where a
master or mistress is concerned. Suppose she had still been working for me: do you
think she would have stayed away then? One doesn’t want this sort of thing to
become a precedent.’
Xi-feng came to her aunt’s assistance:
‘Even if she weren’t in mourning, she would still need to be keeping an eye on
things. Tonight, with lanterns and fire-works everywhere, there is a terrible danger of
fire. Whenever we have plays, the people from the Garden all come sneaking over
here to watch. It’s just as well to have one careful person like Aroma left behind
there who can go round making sure that everything is all right. Besides, she’ll be
able to see that everything is ready for Bao-yu so that he can go straight to bed when
he gets back. If she were here, you can be sure that no one else would bother. He
would go back to find his bedding cold, and there would be no hot water for his tea
or anything else ready for him. I’m afraid I took it for granted that you would prefer
her not to come; but if you want her here, Grannie, I can easily go and fetch her for
you.’
‘No, no, don’t fetch her,’ said Grandmother Jia hurriedly. ‘You have obviously given
the matter more thought than I. There’s only one thing, though. When did her
mother die? Why didn’t I get to hear about it?’
‘But Aroma came to tell you about it herself,’ said Xi-feng, smiling. ‘Surely you can’t
have forgotten already?’
Grandmother Jia thought for a bit.
‘Yes, I do seem to remember something about it. I’m afraid my memory isn’t up to
much these days.’
‘You can’t remember everything’ the others said reassuringly.
Grandmother Jia sighed:
‘She served me all those years when she was a little girl, then she was with Yun for
a while, and during these past few years she’s had that holy terror who left a
moment ago to put up with. I remember thinking at the time that we owe the girl a
bit of kindness - especially as she’s not one of our own home-reared servants but one
who came to us from outside - and meaning to ask them to give her something
towards the funeral when I heard that her mother had died, but I’m afraid that
afterwards I forgot.’
‘It’s already been taken care of,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Lady Wang gave her forty taels for
funeral expenses the other day.’
Grandmother Jia nodded:
‘Ah well, that’s all right then. As a matter of fact Faithful lost her mother too, quite
recently. I couldn’t let her go to the funeral because her parents were living in the
South. Since she and Aroma are both in mourning, why don’t we let her go and join
Aroma? The two of them can keep each other company.’
She ordered some of the women in attendance to make a selection of the cakes and
other delicacies they had been eating and take them for Faithful to eat with Aroma in
Green Delights.
‘You’re a bit late with your suggestion,’ said Amber, laughing. ‘Faithful went over to
Aroma’s place hours ago!’
This remark concluded the discussion and the company’s briefly distracted attention
returned now to the business of drinking and watching the play.

*

After leaving the party, Bao-yu made his way straight through to the Garden. The old
women whom his grandmother had sent after him, realizing that he must be
returning to his own apartment, did not accompany him inside but slipped into the
tea-kitchen of the gatehouse to warm themselves at the stove and avail themselves
of the opportunity for some surreptitious drinking and a hand or two of cards.
On entering his courtyard Bao-yu found Green Delights ablaze with lights but silent as
the grave.
‘Surely they can’t all have gone to bed?’ said Musk. ‘Let’s go in quietly and make
them jump.’
Bao-yu and the four girls tiptoed through the outer room and peeped through the
apertures of the mirror-wall into the room within. Aroma and another girl were lying
facing each other on the nearer side of the kang. At the further end two or three old
women appeared to be taking a nap. Bao-yu was just about to push open the
mirror-door and enter when the sound of a sigh came from the direction of the kang
and he could hear the voice of Faithful speaking:
‘You see, you can never be sure of anything in this life. Look at you, f6r example, on
your own here with a free family living outside, never sure from one year to the next
where they might move to: you never expected to be with your mother at the end,
did you? Yet it just so happened that this year she was living near at hand and you
were able to be a good daughter to her when she died.’
‘It’s true,’ said Aroma. ‘When I first came here, I didn’t think I’d ever see my mother
again. And do you know, when I went to tell Her Ladyship that she’d passed away, she
gave me forty taels for funeral expenses. She couldn’t have done more for me if I’d
been her own daughter. It’s certainly more than I’d have dared hope for.’
Bao-yu turned back and whispered to Musk and the others behind him:
‘It’s Faithful in there with her. I didn’t think she’d be here. If I go inside now, she’s
sure to rush off in a huff - she always does nowadays when she sees me. We’d better
go away again and leave the two of them in peace. Aroma must have been pretty
miserable on her own. It’s nice that she’s got Faithful with her to talk to.’
He tiptoed out again and taking his stand behind a rock, began hitching up his clothes.
Musk and Ripple, who were standing behind him, suppressed a giggle:
‘Why don’t you squat down to take off your underthings? You’ll get the wind on
your belly, standing up like that!’
The two junior maids who had been following behind Musk and Ripple, as soon as
they saw the reason for the halt, hurried off to the tea-kitchen for hot water to wash
his hands.
Bao-yu had finished and was just turning back to the waiting maids when two
women servants appeared, walking in his direction. Seeing this dark figure lurking
amongst the rocks, they loudly demanded who it was.
‘It’s Bao-yu,’ said Ripple. ‘Don’t shout at him like that, you’ll scare the daylights out
of him!’
‘Oh I am sorry,’ said the woman who had shouted. ‘What an awful thing to do - and
today of all days! How are you, young ladies? Having a nice holiday? You certainly
deserve it, after all your work during the rest of the year.’
As they came closer, Musk asked them what they were carrying.
‘It’s some things from Her Old Ladyship for Miss Faithful and Miss Aroma,’ said the
woman. ‘She suddenly thought of them, while she was watching the play.’
‘Oh?’ said Ripple. ‘I thought it was The Orphan’s Revenge they were watching, not
The Magic Casket!’
‘Take the lids off and let’s have a look,’ said Bao-yu.
The two women squatted on their haunches and held out the food-boxes while Musk
and Ripple took off the lids. Bao-yu leaned over and looked into them. Each one
contained a selection of the very choicest of the various sweet and savoury
confections they had been eating at the party. He nodded approvingly before
hurrying on. Musk and Ripple threw down the lids - somewhat carelessly - and
hurried after him.
‘Now those two women seemed very nice,’ said Bao-yu. ‘They were certainly very
civil. Think how hard they must work every day, Yet they could still say those nice
things about you - none of that boasting about how busy they are and how much
they do for us that you get from some of these people.’
‘Oh, those two are all right,’ said Musk. ‘Some of them are really terrible, though.’
‘They can’t help being stupid,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Being more intelligent than they are,
you ought to feel sorry for them. You only have to be a bit more forebearing with
them and they’d give you no trouble.’
While he was speaking, they were passing through the gate?way of the Garden. The
old women drinking and playing cards in the tea-kitchen had been taking it in turns
to get up and peep outside so as not to be taken off their guard, and seeing Bao-yu
through the gate, they came hurrying out after him.
In the gallery leading to the hall where the party was he came upon the two little
maids who had gone to fetch hot water. They had been waiting there for some time,
one with a basin of water, the other with a towel over her arm and a pot of hand
lotion. Ripple first tested the water with her hand.
‘The older you grow the more stupid you get,’ she said to the girl. ‘This water is
stone cold.’
‘Blame the weather, miss,’ said the girl. ‘I was afraid the water would cool quickly
so I poured it out boiling from the kettle, but you see it makes no difference.’
Just at that moment an old woman chanced to be passing by with a kettle full of
freshly-boiled water.
‘Here, missus,’ the girl with the basin called after her, ‘do us a favour! Come over
and pour some in this basin, will you?’
‘This is for Her Old Ladyship’s tea,’ said the old woman. ‘Go and get some yourself,
young lady - walking won’t spoil your feet!’
‘I don’t care who it’s for,’ said Ripple, ‘but if you won’t pour that water out for her, I
shall come and do it my?self.’
The old woman turned. Recognizing Ripple, she hurriedly lifted the kettle up and
poured some water into the basin.
‘That’s enough,’ said Ripple. ‘Really, a person of your age ought to have more sense!
We know it’s Her Old Ladyship’s. Do you suppose we’d have dared ask for it if we
weren’t entitled to?’
The old woman smiled apologetically:
‘My eyesight’s not too good. I didn’t recognize this young lady as one of yours.’
When Bao-yu had finished washing, the other girl poured some of the lotion onto his
palm and he rubbed it into his hands. Ripple and Musk took advantage of the hot
water to wash their own hands too, and after rubbing a little of the lotion into them,
followed Bao-yu back into the hall.
Calling for a kettle of warm wine, Bao-yu now took his turn at pouring for the ladies,
beginning with Mrs Li and Aunt Xue. They protested smilingly and begged him to go
back to his seat, but Grandmother Jia insisted that he should pour for them.
‘He’s young,’ she said. ‘Let him do it. But let us empty our cups first for this round.’
She drained her winecup as she said this. Lady Xing and Lady Wang followed suit and
the other two ladies felt constrained to imitate their example.
‘Pour Out for the girls too,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And do it properly. See that they
empty their cups first before you fill them.’
‘Yes, Grandma,’ said Bao-yu, and proceeded from table to table, pouring for
everyone in turn. When he got to Dai-yu he hesitated, knowing that for her this sort
of drinking was an impossibility; but Dai-yu held her cup up to his lips and he drained
its contents for her at a gulp.
‘Thank you,’ she said, smiling gratefully. Bao-yu refilled the winecup.
‘Don’t go drinking cold wine, Bao-yu,’ Xi-feng called out to him. ‘It’ll make your
hand shake. You won’t be able to write properly or draw a straight bow.’
‘I haven’t been drinking cold wine,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I know, I know,’ said Xi-feng gaily. ‘I was only joking.’
When Bao-yu had finished pouring out for all the girls -all, that is, except Jia Rong’s
wife Hu-shi, who, being of a generation below his, had to have her drink poured out
for her by a maid - he went onto the verandah outside and poured for Cousin Zhen
and the men. Having done so, he sat and chatted with them for a while before going
back into the hall and resuming his seat with the ladies.
Presently soup was served and, shortly after, little First Moon dumplings of
sweetened rice-flour. Grandmother Jia expressed concern for the boy-actors outside
in the cold:
‘Tell them to break off for a bit, poor little things! Let them have some hot soup and
some good hot food to eat before they go on again. They can have some of these
cakes and things, and some of these dumplings.’
A few minutes later, the stage in the courtyard having by now fallen silent, two blind
female ballad-singers, both of them familiar visitors to the house, were led in by the
women. A couple of high stools were placed behind them, on which Grandmother Jia
invited them to be seated, and their instruments were handed to them, a pipa lute
and a three-stringed ‘samisen’ guitar. Grandmother Jia asked Mrs Li and Aunt Xue
what story they would like to hear.
‘Anything,’ they said.
Grandmother Jia turned to the two women:
‘Have you added anything new to your repertoire lately?’
‘Yes,’ said one of the women. ‘We’ve got a new story set in the Five Dynasties
period, after the fall of Tang.’
‘What’s it called?’ Grandmother Jia asked her.
‘It’s called The Phoenix Seeks a Mate,’ said the woman.
‘Well, the name sounds all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Can you give us an idea
what it’s about, then we can decide whether we want to hear it or not?’
‘This story took place in the time of the Five Dynasties after the decline of the
Tang,’ said the woman. ‘There was in those days a certain gentleman called Wang
Zhong who, after having served as Chief Minister under two successive reigns, had
retired because of old age to live on his estate in the country. Now this Wang Zhong
had an only son whose name was Wang Xi-feng -’
This set everyone laughing.
‘Feng’s double, evidently,’ said Grandmother Jia.
One of the womenservants gave the blind ballad-singer a prod:
‘Don’t talk such nonsense! That’s our Mrs Lian’s name.’
‘Carry on, carry on!’ said Grandmother Jia.
The blind woman rose to her feet:
‘I’m dreadfully sorry, Mrs Lian. I had really no idea it was your name.’
‘Do carry on,’ said Xi-feng, laughing. ‘That’s quite all right. Coincidences over names
are the commonest thing in the world.’
The woman sat down again and continued:
‘A time came when this old Sir Wang sent his son off to the capital to sit for the
examinations. One day, while the young man was on his journey, there was a great
downpour of rain and he was forced to seek shelter in a near-by grange. Now it so
happened that the owner of this grange was a former acquaintance of old Sir Wang’s
called Li, and this old Sir Li invited the young man to spend a few days with him at the
grange, accommodating him in his own study. Sir Li had no son of his own, but he
had an only daughter called Chu?luan, a very accomplished young lady who excelled
in every?thing she turned her hand to, whether it was performing on the qin or
playing Go or painting or calligraphy -’
‘I can see why it’s called The Phoenix Seeks a Mate,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You
don’t need to tell me what the story’s about, I can guess already. “Feng” means
“phoenix” and “Chu-luan” means “little hen phoenix”. Obviously it’s the story of how
Wang Xi-feng seeks to make this Li Chu-luan his wife.’
‘I believe Your Old Ladyship has heard this story before,’ said the blind woman,
smiling.
‘Her Old Ladyship has heard everything,’ someone told her. ‘And what she hasn’t
heard she can guess.’
‘These stories are all the same,’ said Grandmother Jia,’ so tedious! Always the same
ideally eligible young bachelors and the same ideally beautiful and accomplished
young ladies -at least, they are supposed to be ideal, but there’s certainly nothing
ideal about their behaviour - in fact there’s nothing very ladylike about them at all.
Invariably, we are told how well-born they are. Their father has been a Prime Minister,
or a First Secretary at the very least. They are always their father’s only child and the
apple of his eye. They are always amazingly well-educated, a model of decorum, a
regular paragon of all the virtues - that is, until the first presentable young man
comes along. As soon as he appears on the scene -it doesn’t matter who or what he
is - all their book-learning and the duty they owe their parents fly out of the window
and the next moment they are “making their plans for the future” and generally
carrying on in a way that would bring blushes to the cheek of a cat-burglar - certainly
not in the least like respectable, educated young ladies. You would hardly call a young
woman who conducted herself like that a “paragon”, however many books she might
have read - any more than you would acquit a young fellow charged with highway
robbery on the grounds that he was a good scholar. The people who make up these
stories give themselves the lie every time they open their mouths.
‘And for another thing: if these young women really belonged to cultivated,
aristocratic households in which the girls and their mothers were all educated people,
then even allowing for the somewhat reduced circumstances owing to their father’s
early retirement, you can be sure there would still be plenty of nannies and maids in
attendance on them. So how is it that in all of these stories there is only ever a single
confidante who knows what her young mistress is getting up to? What are all the
other servants supposed to be doing all this time? Of course, this is only another
example of the way in which these stories contradict themselves.’
There was some laughter from the assembled company and someone complimented
Grandmother Jia on her perceptive?ness in exposing the underlying falseness of
these stories.
‘There’s always a reason for it,’ the old lady went on. ‘In some cases it’s because the
writer is envious of people so much better off than himself, or disappointed because
he has tried to obtain their patronage and failed, and deliberately portrays them in
this unfavourable light as a means of getting his own back on them. In other cases
the writers have been corrupted by reading this sort of stuff before they begin to
write any themselves, and, though totally ignorant of what life in educated,
aristocratic families is really like, portray their heroines in this way simply because
everyone else does so and they think it will please their readers. I ask you now, never
mind very grand families like the ones they pretend to be writing about, even in
average well-to-do families like ours when do you ever hear of such carryings-on? It’s
a wonder their jaws don’t drop off, telling such dreadful lies! For my part, I have
never allowed these sort of stories to be told. Even the maids here don’t know about
such matters. It’s true that during the past year or two, since I’ve been getting older,
and particularly now that the young people are most of the time safely out of the
way in the Garden, I do once in a while listen to a snatch or two of one of these
stories, when I feel in need of cheering up a bit; but as soon as the children arrive, I
make the person telling it stop.’
Mesdames Li and Xue were thoroughly in agreement:
‘That is the general rule in all the best people’s houses. Even in our households the
children aren’t allowed to listen to such stories.’
Xi-feng walked over to pour the old lady a drink:
‘Come on, Grannie, that’s enough! Your wine will be getting cold. Drink this first to
wet your whistle. You can go on with your lecture afterwards.’
She turned to the rest of the company:
‘The story you’ve just been listening to is called Falsehood Exposed, or The Tale of a
Grandmother. It is a story which took place under the reigning dynasty, on this very
day of this very month of this very year on this very spot and at this very hour. How
can Grannie “with one mouth tell a double tale”? Ah, how indeed! Our tale puts forth
two tails. Which tail to wag? Wig-wag. But for the time being we do not inquire
which tale is false, which true. Our story turns rather to those people in the party
who were admiring the lanterns and watching the play... Just give these two kinsfolk
a chance to drink a cup of wine and watch a scene or two more of the play, Grannie,
and then you can get on with your Exposure of Falsehood -dynasty by dynasty.’
She continued unconcernedly pouring wine while her audience convulsed
themselves. Even the blind ballad-singers were in stitches.
‘You’ve got the gift, Mrs Lian,’ they said. ‘It’s what we call a “hard mouth”. If you
were to take up story-telling as a profession, we should be out of business!’
‘Don’t let them encourage you,’ said Aunt Xue to Xi-feng, laughing. ‘You must
behave yourself. There are people outside listening. This isn’t like every day, you
know.’
‘It’s only Cousin Zhen outside there,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He and I used to get up to all
sorts of mischief together in our younger days. It’s only during the last few years
since I’ve grown up and married Lian that I’ve had to start being a bit more
strait-laced with him. But even though we have to treat each other like solemn
in-laws nowadays, I’m sure he doesn’t mind me fooling about like this. Think of Lao
Lai-zi in the Twenty-Four Patterns of Filial Piety, dressing up in children’s clothes at
the age of seventy and playing at “dicky-bird” in front of his aged parents to keep
them amused. If Cousin Zhen and the other menfolk won’t come in here and play
dicky-bird themselves, the fact that I’m taking so much trouble to make Grannie
laugh and get her to eat a bit should make them feel pleased and grateful, not critical
of my behaviour.’
‘It’s true, I haven’t had a really good laugh for days,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘She has
made me laugh so much, I really do feel better for it. I think I’ll have another drop of
wine.
She took a sip from her cup and then turned to address
Bao-yu: ‘Pour a cup for your Cousin Feng.’
‘No need,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Let me share your good health.’ She took the cup that
Grandmother Jia had just been drink?ing from and tossed back what remained of the
wine in it, then, handing the cup to a maid to take away, she replaced it with a clean
one that had been previously warmed in hot water. She then proceeded to do the
same for everyone else, removing their dirty cups and replacing them with clean,
warmed ones. After that she poured out a fresh supply of wine for everyone before
returning to her seat.
‘If Your Old Ladyship doesn’t want to hear a story,’ said the blind woman who had
spoken before, ‘perhaps you’d like us to do a song for you.’
‘Give us “O Captain, Captain”,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The two women at once began tuning their instruments and presently struck up a
lively tune, the words of which were divided alternately between them.
Grandmother Jia inquired what the time was.
‘Midnight,’ said one of the senior womenservants.
‘No wonder it’s getting so cold,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It really is bitter.’
Maids were already arriving with more clothes, which they helped their mistresses to
change into or put on over what they were already wearing.
Lady Wang rose, smiling, to her feet:
‘Why don’t you go into the room at the back, Mother, where the heated kang is?
Mrs Li and my sister are not outsiders; I’m sure they won’t mind. And the rest of us
will take care of them for you.’
‘Why don’t we all go inside?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That will be much cosier.’
‘I doubt there’s room for us all,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We don’t need all these tables now. Why
don’t we have just two or three of them taken inside? We can have them put
together to make one big table, then we can all squeeze up round it and keep each
other warm. That will be much jollier!’
Everyone agreed that this was a good idea and got up from their places in
preparation for the move. The tables were cleared, the three largest ones were
carried into the inner room and put together, and the dessert, with various additions
and replacements, was relaid on them inside.
‘Now,’ said Grandmother Jia when everybody was inside, ‘you must forget about
seniority now and sit down where I put you.’
She made Mrs Li and Mrs Xue sit at one end, facing south, and placed herself close to
them on the east side, with Xiang?yun squeezed in on one side of her and Dai-yu and
Bao-qin on the other.
‘You must sit next to your mother,’ she told Bao-yu. So Lady Xing and Lady Wang
came next on the east side with Bao-yu sandwiched between them.
She put Bao-chai on the west side at the end nearest to Mrs Li, then came the Three
Springs, then Lou-shi with her little boy Jia Jun, then Li Wan and You-shi with little Jia
Lan squeezed in between them, and finally Xi-feng.
Jia Rong’s wife, Hu-shi, sat on her own at the north end, round the corner from
Xi-feng.
When they were all seated, Grandmother Jia called to Cousin Zhen and the menfolk
to leave, saying that she herself would shortly be going off to bed. Hearing her call,
Cousin Zhen came hurrying inside, bringing the others with him.
‘Go away, go away!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t come in here! They’ve only just
sat down, they don’t want to have to all get up again. Off to bed with you! You’ve got
important things to do in the morning.’
‘Very good,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I’ll leave Rong behind then, to pour the drinks for
you.’
‘Ah yes,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’d forgotten him.’
Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian withdrew. Pleased to be so soon released, they arranged for
Jia Cong and Jia Huan to be escorted back to their own apartments and went off, as
they had planned to do if possible, to spend the rest of the night together on the
town. But that is no part of our story.
‘I was just thinking,’ said Grandmother Jia when they had gone, ‘ all these people
enjoying themselves here tonight: all we lacked was a young married couple to make
it seem like a proper reunion. I was forgetting about Rong. Sit next to your wife, Rong.
Let’s see you both together.’
Just then some of the women came in bringing a playbill with them. The players were
preparing to resume.
‘Oh, just as we were beginning to enjoy a little conversation,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Now we shan’t be able to hear ourselves speak. And those poor children must be
getting dreadfully cold after so many hours in the open. Why don’t we give them a
rest? Call our own troupe over and let them do something on this stage. The other
ones can stay here and watch them.’
With answering cries the women went out to make the necessary arrangements.
Messengers were sent, some into Prospect Garden to summon the young actresses,
others to the inner gate to requisition some pages. When the pages presented
themselves at the green-room door they were told to take away all the grown-up
members of the visiting troupe and entertain them elsewhere so that only the
boy-actors should be present when the little actresses arrived. These last were to be
observed shortly afterwards, issuing from the gallery at the corner entrance to the
courtyard, preceded by their chief singing instructor and accompanied by a number
of women carrying bundles. There had not been time to bring the wardrobe-boxes,
so they had had to make a guess at the three or four plays that Grandmother Jia was
likeliest to want to hear and hurriedly bundle together the costumes that would be
needed for their performance.
Led by the women who had summoned them, Elegante and the rest entered the
heated back room of the hall, made their curtsies to Grandmother Jia and the rest of
the company, and then stood, arms held stiffly at their sides, awaiting instructions.
Grandmother Jia smiled at them benevolently:
‘Doesn’t your teacher give you a holiday even for First Moon? Dear, dear, dear! -
Well now, what are you going to sing for us? We’ve just been listening to The
Orphan’s Revenge which was so noisy that it’s given us all headaches. We’d like to
hear something a bit quieter now. I ought to tell you that we have a very
discriminating audience here tonight. There’s Mrs Xue and Mrs Li here who both
come from families which used to keep their own troupes of players and who have
heard heaven knows how many good performances between them; there are some
young ladies here who know much more than our own girls about plays and music;
and the troupe you saw just now outside, though they are only children, belong to a
famous conn9isseur and are better than many commercial companies of grown-up
players. So if we don’t want to disgrace ourselves, we shall have to be on our best.
Now let’s see. Let’s try to think of something a bit different to show them. Suppose
we get Parfumee to sing “The Dream Recalled” from The Return of the Soul with just
a fiddle to accompany her - leaving out all the woodwind. How would that be for a
start?’
‘Just the thing, Your Old Ladyship,’ said Elegante drily. We’re certainly not good
enough for Mrs Xue and Mrs Li to want to see us in full performance. They just want
an idea of what our diction and voice-production are like.’
‘Quite so,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The two ladies referred to were much diverted by Elegante’s reply.
‘I believe you and Her Old Ladyship are pulling our legs,’ they told her.
‘Not at all,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘These girls are trained only for our own private
amusement, not as an investment. We don’t hire them out, like some people. So
they really aren’t up to commercial standards.’
She turned to Althee, the performer of ‘painted face’ parts:
‘You can do “Hui-ming Takes the Letter” from The Western Chamber. Don’t bother
to make up for it, though. I think those two scenes should be enough to give our
guests some idea of what you can do. Put all you’ve got into it, now, or I shall have
something to say to you!’
The little actresses went out. Those who were to play had soon got into their
costumes and the performance began:
first ‘The Dream Recalled’ and then ‘Taking the Letter’. The audience listened
throughout with rapt attention. When the performance had ended, Aunt Xue
observed that, though she had seen hundreds of different companies in her time, she
had never before heard a performance in which the woodwind in the orchestra was
silent.
‘Oh yes,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Take that “Chu River” aria the heroine sings in The
House in Ping-kang Lane that we were listening to earlier in the evening. Quite often
you can see productions which leave out the woodwind parts in the orchestral
accompaniment. Instead they have the male lead playing a flute accompaniment on
the stage. I agree, a whole sequence with only string accompaniment is unusual, but
there’s nothing very special about it. It depends entirely on the individual preference
of the person who owns the troupe.’
She pointed to Xiang-yun:
‘When I was this child’s age her grandfather had a troupe of young actresses one of
whom was a very good qin-player. She took a number of qin-playing scenes like the
famous one from The Western Chamber and the scene in which Miao-chang plays
the qin in The Jade Hairpin and the “Eighteen Stanzas for the Barbarian Pipe” from
the modern sequel to The Story of the Lute, and arranged them in a single sequence
with qin accompaniment. That was rather impressive. More what-shall-I-say than the
things we have just been listening to.
‘Yes,’ the others agreed, ‘that does sound most unusual.’
Grandmother Jia called the women over and told them that she would now like
Elegante and the others to perform an instrumental piece called Lantern Festival
Moon. The women went out again to transmit her order. Meanwhile Jia Rong and his
wife went round replenishing the winecups.
Xi-feng observed that Grandmother Jia was in very good spirits.
‘While the ballad-singers are still here,’ she said, ‘why don’t we get them to play
“Spring Joy on Every Brow” for us and we can have a game of “Pass the Plum”?’
‘Oh yes, that’s a good game,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Just right for this time of year,
too.’
Orders were given for a pair of drums to be fetched - special ‘drinker’s drums’ whose
black lacquered sides were studded with patterns of brass nails - and handed to the
blind women. Someone produced a flowering spray of red plum for the game.
‘Now,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘whoever’s hand the branch is in when the drumming
stops must first drink a cup of wine and then they have to say something: but what
shall it be?’
‘You can turn your hand to anything, Grannie,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but for those of us who
aren’t so clever it won’t be much fun if it’s something that we’re no good at. I think it
should be something that all of us can enjoy. Why not say that whoever the branch
stops with must tell a joke?’
Everyone present knew that Xi-feng was a wonderful raconteuse with a seemingly
inexhaustible stock of new and funny stories. The servants standing below in
attendance seemed quite as much delighted by this proposal as the members of the
family sitting around the table on the kang, and several little maids went racing off to
inform sisters or cousins outside:
‘Quick, come inside! Mrs Lian is going to tell a joke.’
In no time at all the room was packed with maids.
The actresses had by now finished playing. Grandmother Jia, after first seeing to it
that they were given some soup and a selection of the delicacies available, gave
orders for the drumming to begin.
The blind women were practised performers in this game and deliberately varied the
speed of the beat. Sometimes it would be as slow as the last drips of a water-clock,
sometimes as fast as the rattle of dried beans poured from a bag, sometimes it would
go galloping along like a runaway horse, sometimes it became a soft whisper
interspersed with sudden bursts of sound to make you jump, like flashes of lightning
in the darkness. When the beat was slow, the branch passed slowly from hand to
hand; when it was hurried, the passing too grew faster. Then suddenly it stopped
altogether while Grandmother Jia was holding it. This, in itself, was enough to make
everyone laugh. Jia Rong quickly came round and filled up the old lady’s winecup.
‘Naturally Grandma is the lucky first,’ the others said. ‘You must let us share your
luck, Grandma!’
‘The wine is no problem,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s the joke that’s worrying me.’
‘Come now, your jokes are better even than Feng’s, Grandma,’ they said. ‘Do tell us
one. Make us all laugh.’
‘I don’t know any good new ones,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ll just have to put a bold
face on it and do the best I can.’
She began her story.
‘In a certain family there were ten sons, all of whom were married, but of the girls
they married only one, the youngest, was intelligent and nimble-witted and a good
talker. The old couple doted on this clever daughter-in-law and day in day out found
fault with the other nine. The other nine naturally resented this and took counsel
together what they should do about it.
“‘At heart we are every bit as dutiful as she is,” they said, “but because the little
wretch is so glib, father-in-law and mother-in-law only care for her. Isn’t there
anything we can do about this injustice?”
‘Then one of the nine had an idea:
“‘Why don’t we go to the temple of Yama, the King of the Underworld, and ask him
why, when our souls first went into human bodies, he gave that little horror a clever
tongue and made all the rest of us so stupid?”
‘The others were delighted with this suggestion, and so next day they all went
trooping off to the temple of King Yama and, after offering up incense, lay down on
the steps of the altar and went to sleep. When they were asleep, the souls of the
nine sisters-in-law waited and waited and waited, but King Yama didn’t come.
‘Presently, just as they were growing desperate, Monkey came bowling along on his
cloud-trapeze, and seeing the nine souls there, lifted up his metal-clasped cudgel to
strike them with. The souls knelt down in terror and begged him to spare them.
Monkey asked them what they were doing there, so they told him their story. When
they had finished, Monkey stamped his foot and sighed sympathetically.
“‘What a good job you met me here and not old Yama,” he said. “He wouldn’t have
been able to help you at all.”
‘The nine souls implored him to tell them what they should do.
“‘Do but have compassion on us, Great Sage,” they said, “and our troubles will be
over.”
“‘It’s quite simple,” said Monkey with a laugh. “The day that the ten of you were
due to enter your human bodies, I happened to have been around at old Yama’s
place and done a little piddle on the floor, and just before she was born, that little
sister-in-law of yours drank it all up. That’s what gave her such a clever tongue. If
clever tongues are all you want, I can do as much piddle for you as you like.”‘
The story ended amidst laughter.
‘It’s a good job all of us are such stupid, tongue-tied creatures,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I
should hate to think that any of us had drunk monkey’s piddle!’
You-shi and Lou-shi turned towards Li Wan, laughing:
‘I wonder who she thinks she’s fooling. It’s very clear which of us in this room is the
one who drank monkey’s piddle!’
‘A joke is always the better for being apt,’ Aunt Xue observed.
While she was speaking, the drumming began again. The maids, who wanted only to
hear Wang Xi-feng tell a joke, had come to a secret understanding with the blind
women that if one of them coughed it would be a signal to stop, and when the
branch had been round twice and had just reached Xi-feng for the second time, the
maids all coughed and the drumming stopped. There was a shout of laughter from all
present.
‘Ha!’ they said. ‘Now we’ve got you! Hurry up with your wine and tell us a good
one - only don’t make us laugh so much that we get stomach-ache!’
Xi-feng thought for a few moments and then started:
‘A family was celebrating the First Moon festival, just as we are doing, admiring the
lanterns and drinking wine together. It was a very lively party and everyone in the
family was there: the grandmother, the great-grandmother, the daughters-in-law, the
granddaughters-in-law, the great?granddaughters-in-law, the grandsons, the
great-nephews,      the    great-grandsons,    the   great-great-grandsons,     the
great-little-medium-grandsons, the granddaughters, the great-nieces, the first
cousins once removed, the first cousins twice removed, the second cousins
two-and-a-half times removed - oh, good?ness gracious me, it was a really lively
party!’
Her audience were already laughing.
‘She’s a caution!’ they said. ‘I wonder which of us she’s got it in for this time.’
‘Don’t you bring me into it,’ said You-shi, laughing: ‘I’ll tear your mouth for you!’
Xi-feng stood up and struck her hands together in mock despair:
‘Here am I going to all this trouble to entertain you and all you do is keep
interrupting. All right then, I won’t go on.’
‘Go on, go on! Take no notice of them!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘What happened
then?’
‘What happened then?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Oh, there they all sat, and after drinking
together all night long, they went to bed.’
She said this straight-faced and in a very matter-of-fact tone of voice. Her audience
waited open-mouthed for her to con?tinue, but nothing was forthcoming, and at last
they realized, with a chill of disappointment, that that was all they were going to hear.
After a long, old-fashioned look from Shi Xiang-yun she relented, however.
‘All right, let me tell you another story about people celebrating the First Moon
festival.
‘Some men were taking an enormous rocket outside the city and a crowd of
thousands had collected behind them to see them let it off. While they were still on
their way, some impatient character who couldn’t bear to wait any longer put a
lighted incense-stick to the touch-paper and lit the fuse. There was a great WHOOSH!
and the rocket went off. Every?one burst out laughing and went off home - all except
the man who had been underneath, carrying the rocket on his back. He just stood
there all on his own, complaining what a rotten job the firework-maker had made of
the rocket. He’d put it together so badly, he said, that all the gunpowder had trickled
away before they’d had a chance to let it off.’
‘But surely he’d have heard it go off?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘He was stone deaf,’ said Xi-feng.
There was a burst of laughter from her audience. But they were still worried about
her earlier story.
‘What about the other one you were telling? What did happen then? You really
ought to finish it, you know.’
‘Oh how you do pester one!’ said Xi-feng, thumping the table in pretended
annoyance. ‘Next day was the sixteenth; the party was over; the festival had ended. If
you ask me, I think they were too busy clearing up and putting things away to know
what had happened then.’
This brought another burst of laughter.
‘That’s two o’clock sounding outside,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’m sure Grannie must be tired.
If you ask me, I think we all ought to be like the deaf man’s firework and “trickle away
You-shi, who in the vehemence of her mirth was rocking back and forth with a
handkerchief stuffed in her mouth, stopped for a moment to point a minatory finger
at Xi-feng:
‘She really is a caution, this one!’
‘She’s a caution all right, and no mistake!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘By the way,
talking of fireworks, why don’t we let ours off now? They will help us to overcome
the effects of all that wine.’
At once Jia Rong jumped up and hurried out. Under his supervision a team of pages
set up a number of framework stands in the courtyard on which fireworks were then
fastened or hung. Though none of them particularly large ones, they were all
imported tribute fireworks of the very highest quality. There were fireworks of all
sorts, including a number of bangers. Dai-yu, being of a nervous disposition, was
terrified of pops and bangs. Knowing this, Grandmother Jia hugged her to her bosom
to comfort her. Aunt Xue offered the same protection to Xiang-yun, but Xiang-yun
laughed and said that she didn’t mind the fireworks.
‘There’s nothing she likes better than letting them off herself,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She’s
not afraid of fireworks!’
Lady Wang hugged Bao-yu.
‘What about me?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Doesn’t anyone love me?’
‘I’ll hold you,’ said You-shi, laughing, ‘ though why you should act the shrinking
young thing now I can’t imagine. Normally when you hear fireworks you get so
excited I’d sooner eat a bee’s turd than stand by and watch you!’
‘Wait until this is over,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We’ll go out in the courtyard and let some off
ourselves. I’m sure I can do it better than these boys.’
While they were speaking, a succession of different sorts of fireworks were going off
outside: golden rain, ‘nine dragon’ rockets, thunderflashes, cloud-hoppers, and many
other sorts. When the display was over, the boy-actors were asked to go up on the
stage again and play the Beggar’s Song, and every?one amused themselves by
throwing money onto the stage and watching them scramble for it.
As hot soup was once more being served, Grandmother Jia remarked that after being
up for so many hours she was beginning to feel rather empty.
‘We have some duck and rice stew ready,’ Xi-feng told her.
‘I think I’d like something a bit lighter than that,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘We’ve got a rice and date frumenty that was made for the ladies who don’t eat
meat,’ said Xi-feng.
‘That will do,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The used things were removed now from the table and another set of dishes
containing all sorts of tempting entremets laid out in their place. When everyone had
sampled what they fancied, they rinsed their mouths out with tea supplied for that
purpose and the party finally broke up.

*

Early on the morning of the seventeenth the family paid a formal visit to the
Ning-guo mansion to attend the ceremonial closing of the Hall of Ancestors and the
taking down and putting away of the ancestral portraits. Later in that day, when they
were back at Rong-guo House, they attended a New Year reception by Aunt Xue.
There was no question of another Visitation that year. A Dowager Consort, who had
been the late Emperor’s favourite concubine, had fallen seriously ill and the filial
feelings of the reigning Emperor had prompted him to curtail all seasonal festivities
at the Palace. So from Yuan-chun that year there was not so much as a lantern riddle.
There was, however, during the days which followed, a succession of parties or
‘receptions’ given by the senior domestics of the household, to which the family
were, of course, invited: Lai Da’s on the eighteenth, Lai Sheng’s at the Ning-guo
mansion on the nineteenth, Lin Zhi-xiao’s on the twentieth, Widow Shan’s on the
twenty-first and Wu Xin?deng’s on the twenty-second. Grandmother Jia attended
these or not as the fancy took her, sometimes coming at the beginning and staying
until all the other guests had gone, sometimes only putting in a brief appearance
long after her arrival had been despaired of. But she refused absolutely to turn up
when friends or relations were visiting, or to attend the receptions to which they
invited her, leaving Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng to stand in for her on these
occasions. Bao-yu, too - apart from a single duty visit to his uncle Wang Zi-teng’s
house - managed to avoid all social gather?ings by saying that his grandmother
needed him at home to keep her amused.
Then suddenly, when all the festivities were over, an event occurred which filled the
whole household with dismay. Xi-feng had a miscarriage.
For further information on this subject you must turn to the following chapter.

CHAPTER 55

A foolish concubine seeks to humiliate her own daughter
And an ill-natured stewardess tries to outwit
Her young mistress



As we were saying, the First Month festivities in the Rong?guo mansion were scarcely
over when Xi-feng had a miscarriage. Confined for a month to her room by doctor’s
orders and with two or three physicians in daily attendance on her, she was unable to
keep up her usual management of the household’s affairs; yet so confident was she
of her powers of recovery that she continued, in spite of remonstrances, to plan
things from her sick-room, despatching Patience with messages to Lady Wang
whenever she thought of something that needed doing.
Lady Wang for her part was like a woman who has lost a limb. Never at the best of
times an energetic person, she attended to only the most important matters herself
and left most of the routine business to Li Wan. Unfortunately Li Wan, though a
model young woman in some respects, was not a good manager and allowed the
servants to do more or less as they liked. Soon Lady Wang was obliged to call in
Tan-chun as a reinforcement. It would only be for a month, she told them. If they
could bold out for a month, Xi-feng would by then be better and would be able to
take over once more.
But Xi-feng was not as robust as she supposed. Like many young people she had not
been taking proper care of herself, and the excessive demands she had for some time
past been making on her nervous energies had seriously weakened a constitution
that was already far from strong. The miscarriage was in fact only a symptom of her
body’s exhaustion. A month later it was followed by the beginning of a chronic small
dis?charge of blood from the womb. Although she was unwilling to tell anyone about
it, it was apparent to everyone from her gaunt and yellow look that something must
be seriously the matter with her.
Lady Wang insisted that she should make a more serious effort to get better: she
must follow the treatment prescribed for her; above all she must stop worrying
about the household. Xi-feng was herself beginning to be afraid that the trouble
might develop into a major illness which would leave her at the mercy of her
enemies and was now willing to take time off to recuperate. But in spite of her
impatience to get better, the weakness was not to be cured in a day, and it was not
until well into the autumn of that year, after months of slow con?valescence, that her
body recovered its strength and the dis?charge of blood finally dried up.
But we anticipate. Let us return to the time about a month after the miscarriage
when Lady Wang was beginning to realize that her niece was far from better and
could not be expected to relieve Li Wan and Tan-chun of their duties.
Lady Wang was worried about the Garden. There were far too many people in it: she
feared that they were receiving insufficient supervision. Calling Bao-chai to her, she
entrusted her with their surveillance.
‘Those older women are no good,” she told her. ‘They drink and play cards
whenever they have a moment to spare. They sleep in the daytime and play cards at
night, I know they do. When Feng was up and about, there was someone they were
afraid of; but now that she is out of the way, I expect they do just as they please.
Now my dear, I know you are a dependable person. Your cousins are too young for
these matters and I am too busy. Will you please, for my sake, keep your eye on
things for the next week or two? If you come across anything I have missed, point it
out to me. I don’t want Lady Jia asking me about things and finding that I don’t know
the answer. If you see any of the servants misbehaving, let me know. And report
them if they are disobedient. Don’t wait for things to get out of hand before speaking
up about them.’
Bao-chai, whatever she thought of this request, could not very well refuse it.
Spring was now at its height. Dai-yu’s seasonal cough had returned, and in All-spice
Court Shi Xiang-yun lay ill in bed with some epidemic sickness that required constant
medical attention. Li Wan and Tan-chun, though neighbours, were too far apart for
their present circumstances, since servants had to keep going from one place to the
other looking for them, so it was decided that for purposes of household
management they should meet at six o’clock each morning in a little three-frame
reception room on the south side of the Garden gate. They would eat their lunch
there and would be available for seeing people on household business there up to
the end of the morning.
This reception room had originally been intended as a place for the senior eunuchs to
sit at the time of the Visitation. After the Visitation was over there was no further
use for it -in the daytime, at any rate; at night it provided a convenient meeting-place
for the women who made up the watch. Now that the weather was getting warmer,
it did not need a great deal doing to it - beyond moving in one or two pieces of
furniture - to turn it into a comfortable office for the young managers. It had a board
over the doorway bearing the in?scription

SUPPORT BENEVOLENCE PROMOTE VIRTUE

but the servants always referred to it simply as ‘the jobs room’.
Thither, then, at six o’clock each morning the two sisters?-in-law repaired and sat
there until noon while a stream of stewardesses and serving women trooped in and
out reporting on their duties and asking for their instructions.
To begin with, when the servants heard that Li Wan would be managing the
household on her own, all of them were secretly pleased. She was known to be a
kind, easy-going sort of person who disliked giving punishments, and with her in
command they felt sure that it would be much easier than usual to get away with
things. Even the addition of Tan-chun did not materially alter these expectations.
Tan-chun was young and unmarried and, so far as one could judge, a quiet and docile
girl. They foresaw no trouble from that quarter and were, as a consequence, inclined
to take liberties in her presence that they would not have dared to do with Xi-feng.
Within only a few days of her arrival, however, they had begun to sense, from the
way in which she handled one or two of the matters that were brought to her
attention, that though quieter-spoken than Xi-feng and of a much more equable
disposition, she yielded nothing to her in thoroughness.
By coincidence it happened that about this time a dozen or more important events -
promotions, demotions, marriages, deaths and the like - occurred in rapid succession
among the group of aristocratic and official families connected by matrimonial or
other ties with the Ning-guo and Rong-guo Jias, and for days on end Lady Wang’s
time was taken up with visits of condolence or felicitation. Some responsible person
was needed to stand in for her while she was away; so while Li Wan and Tan-chun
spent all their mornings in the office, Bao-chai spent hers in Lady Wang’s apartment,
only leaving it when her aunt got home from her visiting. At night the three young
guardians spent whatever time could be spared from their sewing patrolling the
Garden in sedans, escorted by the old women of the watch. Working together in this
way they soon came to feel that they had evolved a system of supervision more
careful even than Xi-feng’s - a view amply borne out by the grumbles of the
domestics themselves:
‘No sooner is the Terror of the Seas put out of action than along come these three
Scourges of the Mountains to take her place. Nowadays you can’t even take time off
for a quiet drink of a night or a little game of cards!’
A day came when Lady Wang was due to attend a luncheon at the Marquis of
Jin-xiang’s. Li Wan and Tan-chun, after an early toilet, had attended her to the gate
and seen her off. They had just got back to their office and were enjoying a morning
cup of tea when Wu Xin-deng’s wife came in to report:
‘Mrs Zhao’s brother, Zhao Guo-ji, died yesterday. I told Her Ladyship and she said I
was to report it to you.
Having delivered this brief communiqué’, she stood in silence, her arms held stiffly at
her sides, waiting for a reply. A number of stewardesses who were waiting their turn
to report, pricked up their ears at this mention of Tan-chun’s natural mother and
waited with interest to see what the two young deputies would decide. If their
decision was a good one, they would in future treat them with respect; but if it was
one in which there was the slightest possibility of picking holes, not only would they
not respect them, but afterwards, when they got back outside, they would have
many a good laugh at their expense.
The behaviour of Wu Xin-deng’s wife on this occasion was quite deliberate. If it had
been Xi-feng that she was reporting to, she would have demonstrated her efficiency
by making one or two helpful suggestions, having armed herself beforehand with
some precedents for Xi-feng to choose from; but as it was only Li Wan and Tan-chun,
one of whom she despised for her softness and the other for her youth, she merely
stated her business and left them to flounder unaided.
Tan-chun turned questioningly to Li Wan.
‘When Aroma’s mother died recently, didn’t they give her forty taels?’ said Li Wan
after thinking for a bit. ‘I suppose we’d better give her forty taels.’
‘Yes ma’am,’ said Wu Xin-deng’s wife, and taking up a tally, went hurrying off to
collect the money.
‘Just a minute!’ Tan-chun called out after her.
Wu xinLdeng’s wife returned - a trifle reluctantly it could be observed.
‘Don’t collect that money yet,’ said Tan-chun. ‘There’s something I want to ask you.
Of the old women in Lady Jia’s apartment who used to be chamber-wives when my
grandfather was alive, some must have been home-reared and some must have been
bought outside. There’s a different scale for the two kinds, isn’t there? How much do
the home-reared ones get when someone in their family dies and how much do the
ones from outside get? Give us one or two examples so that we have something to
go on.’
Not having prepared herself for such a question, Wu Xin?deng’s wife was unable to
answer it. She covered up for herself, all smiles:
‘It’s not a very important matter. Just give what you think. No one’s going to
question your decision.’
Tan-chun smiled back:
‘Now you are talking nonsense. Suppose I said, “Give her a hundred taels”? No, we
have to give what is right: otherwise, quite apart from the fact that you will all laugh
at us, how am I going to face Mrs Lian when I next see her?’
‘Very good then, I’ll go and look up the old accounts,’ said Wu Xin-deng’s wife. ‘I
can’t at the moment remember.’
‘You’ve been working here all these years and you can’t remember?’ said Tan-chun.
‘I think you are trying to make things difficult for us. I can’t believe that you have to
go off and look things up when Mrs Lian asks you a question. If you do, all I can say
is that she is not such a strict mistress as she is supposed to be: in fact, I should say
that she was a rather indulgent one. All right, hurry up and fetch the accounts then!
If this matter is delayed, it isn’t your negligence that will be blamed but our
incompetence.’
Blushing to the roots of her hair, Wu Xin-deng’s wife hurried off to do as she was
bidden. The other women gasped and stuck their tongues out in surprise. Reporting
on other matters continued in her absence.
After a little while she returned with the account-books. On examination Tan-chun
found two instances of home-reared concubines receiving twenty taels and two of
‘outsiders’ receiving forty taels. She also found an instance of an outsider receiving a
hundred taels and one of an outsider receiving sixty; but in each case a note
explaining special circumstances had been made against the entry: in the first case
the body of a parent had had to be conveyed in its coffin for interment in another
province and the extra sixty taels was to cover the cost of transport; in the second
case the extra twenty taels was for the purchase of a plot of ground for burial.
Tan-chun handed Li Wan the relevant account to look at, while at the same time
informing Wu Xin-deng’s wife of her decision:
‘Give her twenty taels. And leave these accounts with us, so that we can have a
good look at them.’
Wu Xin-deng’s wife went off once more.
The next thing that happened was that Aunt Zhao came stalking in. Li Wan and
Tan-chun invited her to be seated, but Aunt Zhao was in no mood for polite
preliminaries.
‘Everyone in this family tramples on me,’ she said, address?ing herself to Tan-chun.
‘Don’t you think that you at least might stick up for me?’
She began crying messily, the abundant moisture seeming to come as much from her
nostrils as from her eyes.
‘Who are you complaining about?’ said Tan-chun. ‘I really don’t understand you.
Who’s been trampling on you? If you would tell me, perhaps I might be able to “stick
up” for you.’
‘You have, for a start,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘That doesn’t leave me anyone to turn to,
does it?’
Tan-chun leaped to her feet:
‘I shouldn’t dream of trampling on you.’
Li Wan, too, stood up and made some soothing remark or other. But Aunt Zhao was
not to be placated:
‘Sit down both of you, and listen to me. I’ve given the best years of my life to this
family - years and years and years. I’ve borne two children for them, you and your
brother. And now, after all that, I’m not even to be treated as well as Aroma. What
sort of face does that leave me with? What sort of face does it leave you with - never
mind me?’
Tan-chun laughed mirthlessly:
‘Oh that’s what this is about! The simple answer to that is that I have to follow the
rules.’
She sat down again, opened up the account-book and, holding it out for Aunt Zhao to
see, read the relevant entries out to her.
‘These regulations were laid down by the ancestors for everyone to follow. I can’t
suddenly go altering them. It isn’t just Aroma. It will be exactly the same if one day
Huan has a chamber-wife from outside. If someone in her family dies, then, as an
outsider, she will get exactly the same amount as Aroma did. It has nothing to do
with who is more important than whom. It isn’t a matter of prestige at all. Zhao
Guo-ji was Lady Wang’s bondservant. That means that he belongs to the
“home-reared” class. The rules lay down a certain scale of payments for that class.
All I have done is to follow the rules. I am sure that Zhao Guo-ji must approve and be
grateful to the ancestors and Lady Wang for their generosity. If he doesn’t - if he
thinks he is being unfairly treated - then all I can say is that he is stupid and
ungrateful and one can’t really care very much what he thinks. As regards face, it
makes no difference to me whether Lady Wang gives him everything she’s got or
nothing at all. And I really do think that while she is away you might try to compose
yourself a bit and not go working yourself up into such a state. Although Lady Wang
is so good to me, I am constantly worried that you will spoil everything with your
perpetual trouble-making. If I’d been a boy I should have left home long ago and
done some?thing to show myself worthy of her kindness; but as I am a girl, I have to
stay at home and never say a word out of turn. I believe she realizes this, and
because she thinks highly of me she has entrusted me with this managing job as a
means of proving myself. But before I have had a chance to do anything, you have to
come along and start making things diffi?cult for me. If Lady Wang gets to hear of it,
she will probably conclude that the job is too hard for me and take it away again.
That would be a real loss of face - for you as well as for me.’
Tan-chun’s shoulders began to shake as she said this and she ended up by bursting
into tears.
Aunt Zhao did not really have an answer to what Tan-chun had said, so she tried
another tack.
‘If Lady Wang is so fond of you, you ought to use your position to give us a helping
hand. The fact is, though, you are so anxious to keep in her good books that you
forget about us altogether.’
‘Of course I don’t forget about you,’ said Tan-chun. ‘But what do you mean by
giving you a “helping hand”? A good mistress will always be favourable to those who
try hard and make themselves useful, and a good servant doesn’t need any “helping
hand” in order to keep in her favour.’
Li Wan hovered between them, still trying to act the peace maker:
‘Please don’t be angry, Mrs Zhao. You mustn’t blame Tan?chun. I’m sure she’s most
anxious to give you all the help she can; but you could hardly expect her to say so.’
‘Don’t talk such stuff, Wan!’ said Tan-chun impatiently. ‘Help whom, for goodness
sake? Whoever heard of the young mistress in a family helping the servants? Their
private interests are no concern of mine, as you perfectly well know.’
‘We’re not talking about “servants”, we’re talking about me,’ said Aunt Zhao angrily.
‘If you hadn’t been in charge now, I’d never have asked you. At this particular
moment you happen to be in charge here. Very well. Your mother’s brother has just
died. If you decide to give an extra twenty or thirty taels towards his funeral, Her
Ladyship isn’t going to stop you, is she? Of course she isn’t. We all know what a good,
kind person Her Ladyship is. It’s mean, tight-fisted people like you interfering that
stop her being generous. I simply don’t know what you’re worried about. It isn’t your
money you’re spending. I’d been hoping that one of these days when you grew up
and got married you’d be able to do our Zhao family a bit of good. But not you!
You’re in such a hurry to find a higher branch to perch on, you’ve forgotten the nest
even before your feathers are full-grown!’
Tan-chun went white, and for a moment anger deprived her of her breath. When she
regained it she broke into louder sobs.
‘Who is this “mother’s brother”? The only mother’s brother I know about is the
one who has just been appointed Inspector-General of Armies in the Nine Provinces.
I’m sure I always try to show respect where it is due, but no one ever told me that I
ought to think of Zhao Guo-ji as my uncle. If so, how is it that he always stood up for
Huan and walked behind him on his way to school in the mornings? Why didn’t he
insist on being treated as an uncle by Huan? But what’s the point? Everyone knows it
was you who bore me. Two or three months never go by without your making a
scene about something or other just to give yourself an opportunity of proclaiming
the fact. And you talk about face! It’s a good job I understand your little game. If I
were a simple-minded person and not very sure of my position, it would have driven
me distracted long ago.’
The ever more agitated attempts at peace-making by Li Wan and continuing gabble
of complaint from Aunt Zhao which followed this outburst were suddenly interrupted
by a call from the women outside:
‘Here’s Miss Patience with a message from Mrs Lian.’
At once Aunt Zhao fell silent. She advanced fawningly on Patience as she entered:
‘Is your mistress any better, Patience? I’ve been meaning to go round and see her,
but I just haven’t had the time.’
Li Wan asked Patience what she had come for.
‘Mrs Lian heard that Mrs Zhao’s brother had died and she was afraid you might not
know what to give. She said according to the rule it should be twenty taels, but in
this particular case Miss Tan should feel free to add on a bit if she sees fit.’
‘Oh? On what grounds, I wonder?’ said Tan-chun, who had by this time wiped the
traces of tears from her face. ‘I’m not aware that there was anything very special
about this person. His mother didn’t carry him for twenty-four months before he was
born. He didn’t rescue his master on the battle?field from under a heap of corpses
and carry him to safety on his back. It is very ingenious of your mistress, getting me
to break the rules so that she can take the credit for being generous, but if she
wishes to play the Lady Bountiful by giving away other people’s money, I’m afraid she
will have to wait. Tell her that I absolutely refuse to take responsibility for any change
in the rules. If she wants to make a change, let her wait until she is better. Then she
can add on as much as she likes!’
Patience had already had a rough idea of the situation when she arrived and by the
time Tan-chun finished speaking she had sized it up completely. Observing the anger
in Tan-chun’s face, she did not presume to reply in the joking, light-hearted manner
she would normally have adopted with her, but stood in silence, with her arms held
submissively at her sides.
It was now about the time when Bao-chai usually came over from Lady Wang’s
apartment for discussion. Tan-chun and Li Wan stood up to greet her as she entered
and invited her to sit with them. Before they had a chance to begin talking, however,
one of the women who had been waiting outside came in to make her report.
Because Tan-chun had recently been crying, three or four maids had already been to
fetch water and towels and a hand-mirror so that she could wash her face. As she
was at this moment sitting cross-legged on a low wooden couch, the maid carrying
the hand-basin went down on both her knees to bring it to a convenient level for her,
whereupon the girls bearing the towels, hand-mirror, cosmetics and so forth also
knelt down on either side. Seeing that Tan-chun’s body-servant Scribe was not
present, Patience hurriedly stepped forward, rolled back Tan-chun’s sleeves for her,
removed her bracelets and tucked a large towel round her neck to protect the front
of her dress. As Tan-chun stretched out her hands to begin washing, the woman who
had just entered began to make her report:
‘Excuse me Mrs Zhu; excuse me Miss Tan. The school want to draw this year’s
allowance for Master Huan and Master Lan.’
‘What’s the hurry?’ snapped Patience. ‘Haven’t you got eyes in your head? Can’t
you see that Miss Tan is washing? You ought to be waiting outside. What do you
mean by bursting in like this? Would you behave like this if Mrs Lian were here? Miss
Tan is a kind young lady and lets you get away with it, but if I tell Mrs Lian when I get
back how little respect you show her, you’ll be in serious trouble - and don’t say I
didn’t warn you!’
Thoroughly alarmed, the woman put on her broadest smile and retreated,
apologizing, from the room.
Tan-chun, who had finished washing and was now making up her face, looked up at
Patience with a sardonic smile:
‘It’s a pity you didn’t come a bit earlier. You missed the best part of the comedy. Wu
xin-deng’s wife, who has spent a whole lifetime in service, came here without having
bothered to look up the records, in the hope of making us look foolish. Fortunately I
thought to ask her what the rule was; but then she had the effrontery to tell me that
she had forgotten. I told her that I didn’t think she would forget things and have to go
off and look them up if it was your mistress that she was dealing with.’
‘I should think not, indeed!’ said Patience. ‘If she had ever tried a trick like that on
Mrs Lian, she’d have some nasty scars on her backside to show for it, I can tell you!
Don’t you believe any of them, miss! They think that because Mrs Zhu is such a kind,
saintly person and you are such a quiet, shy young lady they can get away with
anything.’
She turned to address the women who were standing outside the door:
‘Keep it up all of you! Just carry on with these little tricks! See what happens to you
when Mrs Lian is better!’
‘Now, now, you know us better than that, miss!’ said the women, laughing. “‘Let
him face the summons that did the offence”. We wouldn’t pull the wool over a young
mistress’s eyes. We know perfectly well that if a young unmarried lady like Miss Tan
was to get really angry with us, it would be more than our lives was worth.’
‘Well, as long as you know, that’s all tight,’ said Patience drily. She turned back to
Tan-chun. ‘I’m sure you must realize, miss: Mrs Lian is much too busy to think of
everything and there must be quite a few things that she’s over?1ooked, They say
“the bystander sees all”, and during the years that you’ve been quietly looking on as
a bystander you may have noticed cases in which more or perhaps less ought to be
given that Mrs Lian herself has never got around to dealing with. If you were to take
this opportunity of putting them right, you’d be doing Her Ladyship a good turn and
at the same time it would be a kindness to my mistress which I’m sure she would
appreciate.’
Before she bad finished, Bao-chai and Li Wan were both laughing.
‘Patience, you’re wonderful! No wonder Feng is so devoted to you. The way you’ve
just put it, you make us feel that even if there are no grounds for altering the rules,
we ought to try and find some, just so as not to disappoint you!’
Tan-chun joined in their laughter:
‘I still feel very angry. Until she came along, I was hoping to work some of it off on
her mistress, but she’s been so reasonable about it all that I hardly know what to do!’
She called in the woman whom Patience had chased out a few minutes earlier.
‘What are these allowances for Master Huan and Master Lan that the school is
asking for?’
‘Eight taels each a year, miss. It’s for paper, writing-brushes and refreshments.’
‘But these expenses are already provided for in the monthly allowances,’ said
Tan-chun. ‘Mrs Zhao gets two taels a month for Huan, Aroma gets two a month for
Bao-yu from Her Ladyship, and Lan’s expenses are covered by Mrs Zhu’s allowance.
Why should we pay an additional eight taels for each of them to the school? Is that
what they go to school for, to collect the money? I think we should cancel that
payment from now on. Patience, go back and tell your mistress: I insist that these
payments should be discontinued.’
‘They should have been long ago,’ said Patience. ‘Mrs Lian had decided to stop
them last year, but with so much going on over the New Year, she forgot about it.’
The woman who had come for the allowances had to go off empty-handed.
Women from Prospect Garden now arrived carrying food-boxes containing Li Wan’s
and Tan-chun’s lunch. They were preceded by the maids Scribe and Candida who
carried a little table between them which they put down in front of their mistresses.
Patience busied herself by taking dishes from the food-boxes and putting them on
the table; but Tan-chun stopped her:
‘If you have nothing more to say, you had better be about your own business. There
is nothing for you to do here.’
‘I haven’t got any other business,’ said Patience, smiling. ‘That’s why Mrs Lian sent
me here. Partly it was to bring you the message, but partly it was because she was
afraid the servants here might be giving you trouble and she thought I might be able
to make myself useful.’
‘Why hasn’t Miss Bao’s lunch been brought here so that she can eat with us?’
Tan-chun inquired.
At once one of the maids went outside and gave an order to the women who were
waiting there under the eaves:
‘Miss Bao’s going to have her lunch here with the other young ladies. Tell them to
bring it here.’
The raised voice of Tan-chun, who had overheard her, issued from behind her in
reproof:
‘Who are you ordering about like that? Those are stewardesses out there and
senior members of the domestic staff. You can’t make them run to and fro fetching
and carrying things for you. Have you no respect for seniority? Patience is standing
around here with nothing to do: why don’t you get her to go?’
Not waiting to be ordered, Patience murmured something and hurried out; but the
women outside silently waylaid her and with broad smiles prevented her from going.
‘We can’t let you go, miss: that would never do! In any case, we’ve already sent
someone.’
They dusted the steps with their handkerchiefs and invited her to sit down:
‘There you are, miss, sit there in the sun and rest yourself. You must be tired after
standing about for so long.’
Patience was about to sit down when two women from the tea-kitchen rushed up to
her with a rug:
‘That stone’s too cold to sit on. Here’s a nice clean rug. You sit on this, miss.’
Patience smiled and nodded:
‘Thank you very much.’
Another woman came out carrying a cup of tea for her on a tray.
‘Here you are, miss,’ she whispered. ‘This isn’t the tea we usually drink. This is the
kind we make for the mistresses. Try some of that for a change.’
Patience bowed and took the cup, then, shaking a reproving finger at the women,
she admonished them in a voice that she kept low so as not to be audible inside:
‘You’ve gone too far this time and no mistake! Miss Tan is a real little lady, but just
because she is too well-bred to throw her weight about, it doesn’t mean that you can
afford to take advantage of her. On the contrary, you ought to respect her all the
more for it. If she were ever to get really angry, my word you would be in trouble! It
wouldn’t just be a question of saying “sorry” then. If she took it into her head to
throw a tantrum, even Her Ladyship would have to give in to her. Mrs Lian certainly
wouldn’t stand in her way, she wouldn’t dare. So just what makes you so bold against
her I do not know. You might just as well pelt a rock with eggs as set yourselves up
against her!’
‘We wouldn’t dare set ourselves up against her,’ said the women. ‘This was all Mrs
Zhao’s doing.’
‘Oh, come on now!’ said Patience, still speaking in a half?whisper. ‘Everyone likes to
push a falling wall. We all know that Mrs Zhao isn’t the most sensible of mortals. She
doesn’t know whether she’s coming or going half the time. It’s just a bit too easy to
blame it all on her when things go wrong. Do you think after all the years I’ve been
here I don’t know how unmanageable and how ruthless you can be? If Mrs Lian were
just a shade less determined, she’d have been finished off by you lot years ago. As it
is, you only need half a chance to start making things difficult for her. Many and
many’s the time she’s nearly come unstuck because of your whispering. Everyone’s
always saying what a holy terror she is and how you’re all afraid of her. I’m probably
the only one who realizes that in her heart of hearts she’s actually afraid of you. As a
matter of fact she and I were talking about this only the other day. We both agreed
that if you didn’t make yourselves a bit more accommodating, there were sure to be
one or two explosions. Miss Tan may be only a young girl, but you’re completely
mistaken in treating her like this. Even Mrs Lian is a tiny bit scared of Miss Tan. Of all
the young ladies in this household Miss Tan is the only one she feels that way about.
And yet you think you can do what you like with her!’
Just then Ripple approached and the women all crowded round to greet her.
‘Better stay outside with us for a bit, miss,’ they said. ‘They’ve just laid for lunch
inside. Better wait until they take the table away before going in to report anything.’
‘I’m not like you,’ said Ripple loftily. ‘I can’t wait.’
She began mounting the steps.
‘Come back at once!’ Patience called after her.
Ripple looked back and saw that it was Patience.
‘Oh, what are you doing here? Sentry duty?’
She came down again then and sat beside Patience on the rug.
‘What have you come about?’ Patience asked her in a low voice.
‘I want to ask about Bao-yu’s and our allowances for this month. We’ve been
wondering when we’re going to get them.’
‘Oh that!’ said Patience. ‘That’s not very important. Go back and tell Aroma this -
say I told you to tell her: no matter what it is, don’t come here asking for anything
today. Anything you ask for will be refused. If you ask for a hundred things, one after
the other, the answer will be “no” every time.’
‘Why’s that?’ said Ripple.
Patience and the women explained, pointing out that to go in and ask for something
on Bao-yu’s behalf at the very moment when Tan-chun was looking around for
someone of consequence to make an example of would be simply courting disaster.
‘There’s no sense in your going in now,’ said Patience. ‘Either way it will be
awkward. If they make an example of Bao-yu they will risk offending Their Ladyships;
if they don’t make an example of him You Know Who will call it favouritism and
complain that they daren’t provoke anyone who has Their Ladyships behind them
and only take it out on the weak ones who can’t protect themselves. You wait and
see: they’ll even turn down one or two requests from Mrs Lian before they’ve
finished, just to stop certain people talking.’
Ripple stuck her tongue out in a grimace.
‘It’s a good job I met you here. I should only have got smut on my nose if I’d gone
inside. I’d better go back straight away then and tell the others.’
She rose and went away.
Presently Bao-chai’s lunch arrived and Patience went inside again to help serve it. By
this time Aunt Zhao had already left. The three young women sat cross-legged on the
wooden settle around the low lunch-table which had been placed upon it, Bao-chai
facing south, towards the doorway, Tan-chun facing west and Li Wan facing east. Only
their personal maids stayed inside the room to serve them; no one else dared enter.
The women waited quietly on the verandah outside, dis?cussing the situation in
whispers:
‘Better keep out of trouble from now on. Better not try any more funny business.
Look what happened to Mrs Wu, and she’s ever so much senior to us!’
    Their whispered conversation continued intermittently until lunch was over. They
knew it was over when the sound of chopsticks on bowls and dishes ceased and only
an occasional low cough could be heard from inside. Presently a maid appeared in
the doorway and held the portiere up high to let two other maids through who were
carrying out the lunch-table. Another three maids with wash-basins were already
waiting outside who went in as soon as the other two had finished carrying out the
table. Soon they too came out again, each carrying a wash-basin as before and also a
spittoon. Then Scribe, Candida and Oriole arrived, each with a covered teacup on a
tray, and went in. A little later this last trio reemerged. As they did so, Scribe stopped
for a moment to admonish the junior maids who were remaining behind:
‘Now do your job properly. We’ll be back to relieve you as soon as we’ve had our
lunch. No sneaking off to sit down while we’re away!’
The departure of Scribe and the other two was a signal for the women outside to
begin going in, one by one, to report on their various business. They did this sedately
enough, with none of the careless insolence they had been showing previously.
Tan-chun’s customary good nature gradually reasserted itself and presently she
turned to Patience and addressed her in a normal tone of voice:
‘There’s an important matter that I have been wanting to consult your mistress
about. I’m glad I’ve remembered it now. Come back again as soon as you have
finished your lunch, while Miss Bao is still here, and the four of us can discuss it
together; then, when we’ve worked out all the details, we can ask your mistress
whether to go forward with it or not.’
‘Yes, miss,’ said Patience, and promptly left.
When she got back, Xi-feng asked her why she had been so long and received a full
account of what had happened which greatly entertained her.
‘Good! Good!’ she said. ‘Good for Tan-chun! I always said she’d make an excellent
little manager. Oh, what a pity she wasn’t born in the right bed I’
‘Now you’re talking stupid, madam,’ said Patience. ‘Although she’s not Her
Ladyship’s child by birth, surely no one is going to think any the worse of her because
of that? Won’t she always be treated exactly the same as the rest?’
Xi-feng sighed:
‘I’m afraid it’s not quite as simple as you think. I know being a wife’s or a
concubine’s child is not supposed to make any difference, and in a boy’s case perhaps
it doesn’t; but I’m afraid with girls, when the time comes to start finding husbands
for them, it often does. Nowadays you get a very shallow class of person who will ask
about that before anything else and often, if they hear that the girl is a concubine’s
child, will have nothing further to do with her. It’s silly, really, because if they did but
know it, even the maids in a household like ours are better than the wife’s daughters
in many another household, let alone the daughters of concu?bines. In the case of
girls like Tan-chun and Ying-chun it’s hard to say. They might be unlucky and make a
bad match through being discriminated against, or then again they might be lucky:
someone might come along who didn’t care about these distinctions and they might
make a perfectly good marriage.’
Xi-feng paused for a moment and smiled at Patience confidingly:
‘Because of all the economies I’ve introduced during these last few years there’s
hardly anyone in this household who doesn’t secretly hate me. But it’s like riding a
tiger: I daren’t relax my grip for a single moment for fear of being eaten. In any case,
our expenditure is still far above our income. The trouble is, everything in this
household from the largest down to the smallest item has to be done on a scale and
according to rules that were laid down by our ancestors; but unfortu?nately the
income from our property is not what it was in their days. If we do economize, the
family looks ridiculous, Their Ladyships feel uncomfortable, and the servants
com?plain of our harshness; yet if we don’t economize, in a very few years’ time we
shall be bankrupt.’
‘I know;’ said Patience. ‘And there are three or four young ladies and two or three
young masters to provide for, and Her Old Ladyship: all these big expenses are yet to
come.’
‘Ah, I’ve allowed for them,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Those expenses I think we can just about
manage. Bao-yu’s bride-price and Miss Lin’s dowry won’t involve us in any expense
because Her Old Ladyship will pay them Out of her private savings and Miss Ying will
be taken care of by Sir She. Of the girls, that only leaves Miss Tan and Miss Xi. They’re
not going to cost more than seven or eight thousand each at the outside. Then
there’s Huan: they’re not going to spend all that much on him: say three thousand.
Even if we can’t raise all of that, we can probably get by with a little judicious pruning.
As for Her Old Ladyship: the main things have been paid for already; there will only
be various miscellaneous expenses. Four or five thousand will probably be ample. No,
as long as we can economize a bit, we shall be able to deal with those expenses as
they come along. What really worries me is the possibility of one or two large items
of expenditure turning up which we hadn’t been expecting. Then I am afraid we
really shall be done for!
‘But let’s not worry about these far-off things just now. You must hurry up and have
your lunch so that you can get back and find out what it is they want to talk about.
I’m delighted that things should be turning out in this way. It’s what I’ve. always
wanted, someone to take a bit of the weight off my shoulders. There’s Bao-yu of
course; but he isn’t really one of us, so even if I were to win him over, he wouldn’t be
very much use. Mrs Zhu is such a Holy Buddha, she’s no good. Miss Ying’s even worse
- and anyway she doesn’t properly belong to this household. Miss Xi is still childish.
Lan is little more than a baby. Huan is like a singed cat in the cold, only looking for a
warm stove or a corner of a kang to curl up on - How the same mother could produce
two children such poles apart as him and Tan-chun I never shall under?stand I - Miss
Lin and Miss Bao are both very capable girls, but unfortunately they’re not of our
surname and can’t very well be expected to involve themselves in running our affairs.
And in any case, one of them’s like a beautiful picture-lantern: you feel that a puff of
wind would blow her out; and the other is so determined not to open her mouth
about what doesn’t concern her that a shake or a nod or an “I don’t know” is about
all you can ever get out of her and you feel a bit awk?ward about asking her to do
anything. And that only leaves Miss Tan. She’s got a good mind; she’s good at
expressing herself; she belongs to the right lineage; Her Ladyship likes her; she’s a bit
unsure of herself perhaps, but that’s all the doing of that wretched Zhao woman; in
other respects she’s very much like Bao-yu. She’s certainly not in the least like Huan.
He really is the most objectionable child. If I had my way he’d have been sent packing
long ago. No, if she’s got the determination to do this job, let’s go along with her, I
say. Let’s make an ally of her, so that I don’t have to go on feeling so isolated. From a
high-minded, honourable point of view, having her to help us will save us a good deal
of anxiety, and in the long run Her Ladyship will benefit. But there is also a not so
high-minded, rather more selfish way of looking at it. I’ve been too ruthless, I know I
have. I ought to step back now and take stock of things. I can’t keep the pres?sure up
any longer. People hate me so much already, there are daggers in their smiles. You
and I have only two pairs of eyes between us. If I carry on as I have been doing,
sooner or later they are bound to catch us off our guard and I shall be destroyed. So
you see, her stepping forward and taking command just when things are at their
liveliest means that the heat will be turned off me for the time being and people’s
resentment against me will have a chance to cool down.
There’s something else I want to say to you. I know you are a very intelligent person,
but I am afraid you may find it rather hard to transfer your allegiance, so I want to
impress this on you now. Although Miss Tan may be only a girl, there are very few
things that she doesn’t know about. You mustn’t be taken in by her quiet manner. In
fact, being able to read and write, she’s if anything better equipped to manage things
than I am. Now they always say that anyone who wants to break a gang up should
begin by arresting the leader, and her immediate concern must be to make an
example of someone as a means of establishing her authority. That being so, you can
be quite sure that I shall be the person she’ll pick on first to make an example of. If
she starts criticizing anything I have said or done, don’t try to defend it; just be very
polite and say that the criticism is justified. Don’t, whatever you do, stand up to her
out of a mistaken sense of loyalty to me: that’s the last thing I want you to do.’
Before she could go on, Patience laughingly interrupted her:
‘Why are you so ready to assume that other people are stupid? I’ve been taking
that line with her already; I don’t need you to tell me!’
‘I was afraid you might have no time for anyone but me,’ said Xi-feng. That was my
only reason for warning you. If you have been taking that line with her already, so
much the better. Evidently you are cleverer than I am. By the way, aren’t you perhaps
getting a little carried away - this “you”, “you”, “you” all of a sudden? What’s wrong
with “madam”?’
‘I’ll say “you” if I want to,’ said Patience. ‘If you don’t like it, there’s always my face
to slap. It won’t be the first time it’s enjoyed that privilege!’
‘Little beast!’ said Xi-feng. ‘How many times do you intend to go on dragging that
up? Fancy provoking me with a thing like that when you know how ill I am! Come on!
There aren’t any visitors about. Come over and sit here with me. We’d better get on
with our lunch.’
Felicity and three or four junior maids came in at this point carrying a short-legged
table between them which they set down on the kang. Xi-feng’s lunch consisted of no
more than some bird’s nest soup and a couple of small, light dishes suitable for an
invalid palate. Unable to eat more, she had cancelled the portion that under normal
catering arrangements would have been her due. Felicity put the four dishes to
which Patience was entitled on Xi-feng’s table and filled her a bowlful of rice.
Patience then half sat, half stood with one foot curled underneath her on the edge of
the kang and the other one resting on the floor, and in that position kept Xi-feng
company while she ate her lunch. When they had both finished eating, she helped
Xi-feng to wash and rinse Out her mouth, then, after a few admonitory words to
Felicity, went back to rejoin Tan-chun and the others in the office.
Outside the office building the forecourt was quiet and deserted. The stewardesses
who had formerly been waiting there had now all gone off about their business.
What happened when she went inside will be related in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 56

Resourceful Tan-chun abolishes abuses
in the interests of economy
And sapient Bao-chai shows how small concessions
can be made without loss of dignity
Having kept Xi-feng company while she ate her lunch and waited on her while she
rinsed her mouth out and washed, Patience made her way back to the lobs room’.
The courtyard outside it was quiet now, deserted except for the silent row of maids
and womenservants waiting outside the windows until their mistresses inside the
room should require them. The latter were already in the midst of a discussion. They
were talking about Lai Da’s garden, which they had visited in Grandmother Jia’s
company some months previously on the occasion of the party which had had such
unfortunate consequences for Xue Pan. Tan-chun broke off as Patience entered and
indicated a low stool for her to sit on.
   ‘I’ve been thinking about those two taels we get every month for hair-oil and
cosmetics,’ she told Patience. ‘We already get a monthly allowance of two taels each
and our maids get allowances too. It looks to me as if this is another case of
duplication, like the eight taels paid to the school every year which we were dealing
with earlier. I know it’s not a very important matter, and the sum involved is not very
great, but it’s obvious at a glance that this is a bad arrangement, and I can’t
understand why your mistress hasn’t noticed it.’
   ‘There is a reason,’ said Patience. ‘Obviously you young ladies need a regular fixed
supply of these things, and as there wouldn’t be much sense in our constantly
running out with a few coppers to make individual purchases, the cosmetic
allowances for the various departments are drawn by our buyers and used to make
bulk purchases with. The stewardesses collect monthly supplies from the buyers and
distribute them to the different apartments, and we maids in the different
apartments look after them for use by you as and when you need them. The two-tael
monthly allowance you get is quite separate from the cosmetics money. It isn’t
meant to be spent on cosmetics; it’s simply to keep you in money, so that if the need
should ever arise to spend on something, you shouldn’t have the inconvenience of
finding yourselves short and perhaps running round for some only to find that Her
Ladyship or whoever is in charge at the time is out or too busy to see you. I have to
admit though that about half of us do in fact seem to go outside these arrangements
and buy cosmetics with our spending money; but whether it’s because the official
buyers simply pocket the money and don’t deliver the goods, or because the stuff
they supply us with is so inferior, I simply don’t know.’
   Tan-chun and Li Wan exchanged knowing smiles.
   ‘You’ve noticed, too, then,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I don’t think they actually embezzle the
money, but sometimes the supply is very much delayed. If you try to hurry them they
produce something so awful that it is quite unusable, and in the end you are forced
to buy your own. There’s only one way of doing that, too. You have to give a couple
of taels to a nannie and ask her to get one of her sons or nephews to buy it for you.
It’s no good trying to do it through the regular staff. If you do, you only get the same
awful, unusable stuff as before, I don’t know why.’
   ‘It’s because if they bought you stuff of better quality, they’d be in trouble with the
regular buyers,’ said Patience. ‘The regular buyers would complain that they were
trying to do them out of a job. They’d rather offend you than risk offending the
buyers. Of course, if you get the stuff through your nannies, there’s nothing the
buyers can do about it’
   ‘Well, I am very uneasy about the whole arrangement,’ said Tan-chun. ‘Here we
are paying the same money twice over and half the stuff that is paid for has to be
wasted. It would be much better if this monthly payment to the buyers were
abolished altogether. That’s one thing. Another thing is this. Last year when we went
to Lai Da’s place, you went too. What did you think of that little garden of theirs?
How do you think it compares with ours?’
   ‘It’s not half as big,’ said Patience, ‘and it has far, far fewer trees and flowers and
things in it.
   ‘I got talking to one of the daughters while we were there,’ said Tan-chun. ‘That
garden of theirs is let out annually on contract. She told me that quite apart from
supplying them through the year with flowers for their hair and with all the
bamboo-shoots, vegetables and fish that they eat, it brings them in an annual
income of two hundred taels of silver. Ever since that day I have realized that even a
broken lotus-leaf or a withered grass-root is worth something.’
   Bao-chai laughed.
   ‘There speaks the voice of gilded youth. How typical! But even though, O
delicately-nurtured one, you have no immediate experience of such matters, you can,
after all, read and write. Surely you must at some time or other have read Zhuxius’s
essay “On Not Throwing Away”?’
   ‘Yes,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but in that essay isn’t he merely urging the people, in a fairly
general sort of way, to exert themselves? And isn’t it all rather empty and rhetorical?
Surely he didn’t mean every word of it to be taken literally?’
   ‘Zhuxius empty and rhetorical?’ said Bao-chai. ‘He meant every word of it. If, after
only a few days of household management, the greed for gain has already so clouded
your judgement that the teachings of Zhuxius seem empty and rhetorical, I fancy that
if you were to venture outside into the corrupting atmosphere of the market-place,
you would soon be finding even Confucius himself too abstract for you!’
   ‘Since you are so learned,’ said Tan-chun, ‘I’m surprised that you should appear to
be unfamiliar with the views of Fixius. Fixius once said, “Whosoever sets his foot in
the market-place or takes his seat at the counting-board must forget about Yao and
Shun and turn his back on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius...”‘
   ‘How does it go on?’ said Bao-chai.
   ‘I must claim the quoter’s privilege of giving only as much of the text as will suit my
purpose,’ said Tan-chun. ‘If I told you how it went on, I should end up by
contradicting myself!’
   ‘Everything in the world has some use or other,’ said Bao-?chai, ‘and if it has a use,
it must have a monetary value. Surely to an intelligent person like you so obvious a
truism can hardly have come as a revelation?’
   ‘You call people here to discuss important business,’ said Li Wan, ‘but all we have
had so far is talk about books!’
   ‘But talk about books is important business,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Without it we should
be no better than vulgar tradesmen I’
   The three of them continued chaffing a little longer before Tan-chun returned to
her theme:
   ‘Let’s say for the sake of argument that our garden is only twice as big as theirs.
Doubling the income they get from theirs would mean a clear profit of four hundred
taels per annum. Now of course, a family like ours couldn’t possibly put its garden
under contract and turn it into a business in the way that they do it would look too
mercenary. On the other hand, when you know how valuable everything is, it seems
a terrible waste of natural resources not to have a few people whose special job is to
look after it and just let everyone trample on it and despoil it as they please. I think
we ought to pick out a few experienced trustworthy old women from among the
ones who work in the Garden - women who know something about gardening
already - and put the upkeep of the Garden into their hands. We needn’t ask them to
pay us rent; all we need ask them for is an annual share of the produce. There would
be four advantages in this arrangement. In the first place, if we have people whose
sole occupation is to look after trees and flowers and so on, the condition of the
garden will improve gradually year after year and there will be no more of those long
periods of neglect followed by bursts of feverish activity when things have been
allowed to get out of hand. Secondly there won’t be the spoiling and wastage we get
at present. Thirdly the women themselves will gain a little extra to add to their
incomes which will compensate them for the hard work they put in throughout the
year. And fourthly, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t use the money we should
otherwise have spent on nurserymen, rockery specialists, horticultural cleaners and
so on for other purposes.’
   “‘And after three years there shall be no more famine nor hunger in the land”,’
Bao-chai intoned. (She had wandered off in the course of Tan-chun’s exposition and
was examining some calligraphy on the wall.)
‘It’s a very good idea,’ said Li Wan. ‘If we could really do this, I’m sure Lady Wang
would be pleased. It’s not so much the saving of money that’s important; but if there
are going to be people whose special job is to look after the Garden and they are
allowed to make a little money out of it as well, then what with “the allurement of
status” on the one hand and “the incentive of gain” on the other, they are sure to
make a good job of it.’
‘It needed you to suggest this, miss,’ said Patience. ‘My mistress has thought of
something like this in the past, but she hasn’t liked to mention it to anyone, because
she thought that now all you young ladies are living in the Garden you might feel that
we ought to be spending more on it rather than less and if she had people snooping
around in it making economies you might feel that that really was the last straw.’
Bao-chai walked over and began feeling Patience’s face:
‘Open your mouth, Patience: I want to see what your teeth are made of. Ever since
early this morning you’ve been keeping up this tune. You never give Miss Tan credit
for anything. You never admit that Mrs Lian is less than perfect and that there are
things she may not have thought of. Whenever Miss Tan has finished saying
something, you come back at her with the same refrain: your mistress has thought of
that too, only for some compelling reason or other she hasn’t been able to do
anything about it. This time you tell us that she didn’t like to save money by putting
the Garden under super?vision because of us living there.’
She turned to the others:
‘She’s right, of course. If you do hand this Garden over to a few of the old women
to look after, they will naturally be unwilling that a single fruit or flower that they
have charge over should be picked. Obviously where we are concerned they will not
dare to say anything; but it is sure to prove a source of endless quarrelling with the
maids. Patience is far?seeing enough to realize this and, in her own inimitable way,
without fear or flattery, she gives us warning. How tactful she is! Even if we weren’t
on good terms with her mistress, I think after hearing Patience we should be shamed
into making our peace with her!’
‘And I was so angry this morning,’ said Tan-chun. ‘When I heard that Patience had
come, I suddenly thought of her mistress and the insufferable behaviour of those
henchwomen of hers - which she, no doubt, encourages and it made me even angrier.
But Patience was so quiet and timid, like a poor little mouse that the cat has been
after, and stood there all the time so meekly; and when she did speak, it was not to
remind me of the many kindnesses that I owe her mistress, but to tell me that if I
decided to make any changes, I should be doing her mistress a kindness which she
was “sure she would appreciate”. It really wrung my heart when she said that. Not
only did I stop feeling angry then; I felt ashamed. “Here am I,” I thought, “only a
young girl, but behaving in such a way that nobody can ever like me or care what
happens to me. When shall I ever be in a position to do anyone a kindness?”’
At this point her emotion got the better of her and she shed some tears. The others,
moved by the sincerity with which she had spoken and remembering how Aunt Zhao
was con?stantly maligning her and making things difficult for her with Lady Wang,
were themselves moved to tears of sympathy; but they did their best to rally her.
‘What better return can we possibly make Lady Wang for placing her trust in us,’
said Li Wan, ‘than to take advantage of the fact that things are a little quieter now by
discussing some much-needed economies? What do you want to go bringing in an
unimportant matter like that for?’
‘I’ve got the gist of your plan, Miss,’ said Patience. ‘All you need do now is tell us
which of the women you want to appoint and we can go straight ahead with it.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but you ought to have a word with your
mistress about it first. It was a bit presumptuous of us to go poking about and making
these little economies in the first place - I should never have ventured to do so if I
hadn’t known that your mistress was so understanding: if she’d been a stupid or
touchy person, she might have suspected me of trying to shine at her expense All the
same, the very least we can do is to consult her first.’
‘Very well,’ said Patience pleasantly. ‘I’ll go and tell her, then.’
She was gone for some time, but returned eventually, full of smiles:
‘I knew it wasn’t necessary to go. Of course she agrees. A good idea like this: how
could she do otherwise?’
As soon as Tan-chun had received this confirmation, she and Li Wan sent for the list
of women employed in the Garden. Bao-chai joined them in scrutinizing it and in
making a pro?visional selection of those most likely to be suitable. These were
summoned forthwith and Li Wan, addressing them in a group, outlined the scheme
to them in general terms. The women were enthusiastic.
‘Let me have the bamboo,’ said one of them. ‘I’ll have double the amount growing
within a year. I can keep you in bamboo-shoots for the kitchen and pay you an annual
rent for it as well.’
‘Let me have that bit of rice-paddy,’ said another. ‘I’ll keep you in grain for your
cage-birds so that you don’t have to spend money on feed, and I’ll pay you annual
tent.’
Before Tan-chun could say anything, someone arrived with a message:
‘The doctor’s arrived. He’s waiting to come into the Garden to have a look at Miss
Shi.’
‘Just a moment!’ said Patience as the women went scurry?ing off to escort the
doctor. ‘There’s no point in a hundred people going if there isn’t anyone responsible
to receive him.’
‘Wu xin-deng’s wife and Mrs Shan are already waiting for him at the Painted Gate
on the south-west corner of the Garden,’ said the woman who had brought the
message.
When Patience heard that, she made no further objection.
After the women had gone, Tan-chun looked at Bao-chai inquiringly:
‘Well?’
Bac-chal laughed:
“‘He who shows most enthusiasm in the beginning proves often to be a sluggard in
the end; and he who promises the fairest is often thinking more of his profit than of
his performance.”’
Tan-chun nodded in agreement and praised the aptness of the quotation. She turned
to the register once more and pointed out a few more names for the other two to
con?sider. Patience fetched a brush and inkstone for her to write with.
‘Mamma Zhu is a very reliable body,’ said the others of one of these. ‘Her old man
used to be a bamboo specialist and her son still is; it’s in the family. She’s the one we
should put in charge of all the bamboos in the Garden. And Mamma Tian comes
from a farming family. The farm at Sweet-rice Village may be only a plaything and not
meant for serious cultivation, but if she were in charge of all those vegetable and
paddy strips and doing the things that needed doing at the proper times, we should
probably get a lot more out of it.’
‘When you think of the amount of land that goes with them, it seems a pity that
All-spice Court and Green Delights don’t produce anything marketable,’ said
Tan-chun.
‘Oh, but they do!’ said Li Wan. ‘Especially All-spice Court. Half the aromatics sold in
perfumers’ shops and on the herb stalls at markets and temple fairs come from
plants like the ones grown in All-spice. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more
profit to be had out of them than out of anything else that this Garden produces. And
as for Green Delights: to mention nothing else, just look at all the flowers produced
by that rosa rugosa during the spring and summer months! And all the rambler roses
and monthly roses and rosa glabra and honeysuckle and wistaria on the pergolas:
think how much you could make out of them if the flowers were dried properly and
sold to tea-merchants for flavouring!’
Tan-chun nodded enthusiastically.
‘But,’ she reflected, ‘we haven’t got anyone who knows the art of flower-drying,
have we?’
‘The mother of Miss Bao’s maid Oriole knows all about that sort of thing,’ said
Patience. ‘Don’t you remember her drying a lot of flowers once and filling little
baskets and gourds with them to make us presents?’
‘Is this the thanks I get for praising you?’ Bao-chai asked Patience.
‘What can you mean?’ said the others, in some surprise.
You can't possibly give the job to her,' said Bao-chai. 'You have so many able and
willing women of your own who won't be getting any of these jobs: they are going to
think very poorly of me if they know that I am responsible for bringing in an outsider.
I can think of someone that you could give this job to, though: Old Mamma Ye at
Green Delights - Tealeaf's mother. She's a very honest old woman; and what's more,
she is on very good terms with Oriole's mother. You'd much better give the job to her.
She will probably consult Oriole's mother whenever there is anything she is not sure
about in any case. She may even elect to hand over to her altogether. But that would
be entirely a private matter between the two of them. The other servants might
resent it, but at least they couldn't blame us. The advantage of this arrangement is
that it would look fair as well as being effective.'
Li Wan and Patience agreed. Tan-chun was more sceptical:
'That may be; but what if cupidity proves stronger than friendship?'
'Not likely in this case,' said Patience. 'Only the other day Mamma Ye was invited to
become Oriole's godmother. The three of them had a little party to celebrate. The
two families are very close.'
Tan-chun dropped her objection and proceeded, with the others, to deliberate on the
rest of their choices - all of them women whom the four of them had mentally noted
in the past for their dependability. As each one's selection was confirmed, she made
a little circle with her writing-brush against the corresponding name in the register.
Shortly after this the women arrived back again to report that the doctor had gone
and to hand in the prescription he had left. After studying it, Li Wan, Tan-chun and
Bao-chai sent one of the women to obtain the drugs from outside and to supervise
the making-up and administering of the medicine. Then Li Wan and Tan-chun told the
women which of them were to have the cultivation of which parts of the Garden and
what the conditions of their tenure were to be:
'You will be expected to give us, in due season, a fixed amount of your crops for our
own use; but apart from that it will be up to you to make whatever profit from them
you can.
Accounts will be submitted and dues paid at the end of the year.'
'I've been having second thoughts about that,' said Tan?-chun. 'If you are submitting
annual accounts and paying dues, presumably it will be to the Office. But that means
another lot of people with control over you and another layer skimmed off your
profits. Now in thinking up this new arrangement and appointing you ourselves, we
are already in a sense going above their heads, which is sure to anger them. They
probably won't dare to say anything about it now, but there will be nothing to stop
them getting their own back later on when you go round to settle accounts with
them at the end of the year. And there's another thing. If they are going to be in on
this, they are sure to expect a share of the produce. Whatever you agree to give us in
the course of each year, they will expect the equivalent of half the amount for
themselves. That's an old, established rule. Everyone knows that. But since the new
arrangement is our creation, I say let's keep it out of their hands altogether. If there's
to be an annual settling of accounts, let it be done here, internally.'
'If you ask me,' said Bao-chai, I don't think there should be any settling of accounts at
all. You'd always be finding that this one had too much and that one too little. It
would only be a lot of extra trouble. Why not get each of them to take over some
regular item of your expenditure and pay for it out of their profits? That will keep it
all inside the Garden. I've just been running over in my mind what your regular
expenses are. They aren't very many. There's hair-oil, cos?metics, incense, paper:
every mistress and her maids get a fixed amount of those every month. Then there
are brushes, dust-pans, feather-dusters and food for the livestock (birds, rabbits, deer
and so forth). That's really all. Now suppose instead of drawing money from Accounts
for all those things we gave these women the responsibility of paying for them:
how much do you reckon the saving would be?'
'They're small items in themselves,' said Patience, 'but I should think if you added
them all together the total annual saving would be well over four hundred taels.'
'There you are I' said Bao-chai. 'Four hundred a year, eight hundred in two years: you
could buy a small house for letting with that or add half an acre of poor farm-land to
your landholdings. But though there should be quite a lot left over after they have
covered the expenses we are assigning to them, we want them to have a little
something to spend on themselves after working hard all through the year; and
though, from our point of view, the main object of these operations is economy, we
don’t want to overdo it. There would be no point in saving an extra two or three
hundred taels if it meant resorting to undignified methods in order to do so. What
we are now proposing means that Accounts will be paying out four or five hundred
taels a year less than they do now without anyone outside feeling the pinch. And as
for inside, the women doing these jobs will be getting a little extra for themselves,
the ones not doing them will be able to relax a bit, the Garden’s stock of trees and
flowers will thrive and increase through being better cared for, and we shall he better
off when we have this regular supply of the produce for our own use - all this without
any loss of dignity. Whereas if we went all out to economize with no other
consideration but making money in mind, no doubt we should have little difficulty in
squeezing more out, but the effect of paying everything back into the common
account would be wails of protest from everyone, both inside the Garden and out,
and a consequent loss of dignity that in a household like yours would be quite
un?acceptable.
‘Altogether there must be several dozen old women working in this Garden. If you
give the money-making jobs to these few here and leave the others out in the cold,
the others are going to complain that it isn’t fair. Now as I said, there’s still going to
be quite a lot of money left over when they’ve finished paying these various
expenses for you, and I think we should be letting them off a bit too lightly if we let
them keep all of it. Why don’t we say that every year, no matter how much or how
little they have made, they are to pay so many strings of cash into a common pool
which will be shared out among all the other women? Although those others won’t
any longer have anything to do with the upkeep of the Garden, they are responsible,
day and night, for keeping an eye on the other servants; they have the responsibility
of opening and closing the gates, which means that they have to get up earlier and
go to bed later than everyone else; and whenever any of us go out, whatever the
weather, even if it is raining or snowing heavily, they have to carry sedans, punt boats,
draw sledges - in fact do any heavy work that needs to be done. Since they work so
hard in the Garden from one year’s end to the next, it seems only fair that if any
money is going to be made out of the Garden, they should have a share in it. And
there’s another reason for this, if it doesn’t seem too petty-minded to mention it’ -
Bao-chai turned to the women to explain - ‘If you think only of how much you can
make out of this for yourselves and don’t let the others have a share, they are sure to
feel resentful even if they don’t like to say anything and will try to make up for it by
misappropriating what they can for their own use - filching a fruit here and a flower
there whenever they have the opportunity. Whereas if they know in advance that
they are going to get a share of whatever you make from your produce, they will be
as anxious as you are that none of it is stolen and will even keep an eye on it for you
when you aren’t able to watch over it yourselves.’
The women were quick to see the force of this argument - no control by the Office,
no settling of accounts with Xi-feng, only a few strings of cash to pay out every year.
They were all of them delighted and accepted these conditions unani?mously.
‘Better than being pushed around by Accounts,’ they said. ‘If we were paying them
anything, they’d want a dash on top of it for themselves.’
Those of the women present who were not getting one of the gardening jobs, when
they heard that they were going to be given money at the end of every year without
having to do anything to earn it, were, if anything, even more delighted -though for
politeness’ sake they pretended to demur:
‘After all the hard work they’ll be putting into it they ought to have a bit extra for
themselves. Doesn’t seem right that we should sit back and collect the jackpot
without having to do anything for it!’
‘Don’t refuse the offer,’ said Bao-chai, smiling. ‘It’s no less than you deserve. As
long as you continue to keep a close watch on things and don’t get slack and allow
people to drink and gamble. Otherwise it puts me in such an awkward position. This
isn’t really my business, of course; but as you have no doubt heard, my aunt has
repeatedly urged me to take over responsibility for it on the grounds that Mrs Zhu is
too busy and the other young ladles are too young to attend to it. I can’t refuse her,
knowing that to do so would be deliberately adding to her worries. She has such
indifferent health and so many household cares and I have so little to do myself that
even if she were only a neighbour and not my aunt, I could scarcely refuse to help her.
It’s no good worrying that I shall make myself unpopular. If I care only about being
popular and allow people to drink and gamble as much as they like, sooner or later
someone who has drunk too much will start a quarrel. If an incident like that were to
happen, how should I be able to look my aunt in the face? And think what it would
be like for you. You would have forfeited your reputation as responsible seniors that
you have taken so many years to build up. After all, the reason all these dozens of
maids and the whole of this great Garden have been placed under your supervision is
because you have served here under three or four generations of masters and are
considered more dependable than any of the other servants. At a time when we all
ought to be doing our best to keep up appearances, you will have allowed other
people to drink and gamble. It will be bad enough if my aunt gets to hear of it and
gives you a talking-to; but what if you are found out by the stewardesses and they
decide to discipline you themselves without bothering to tell my aunt? What a
disgrace, that people of your years should be punished by servants younger than
yourselves. They would be within their rights, of course. As stewardesses they have
power over all other members of the staff. But how much better if you conducted
yourselves in such a way that you could keep your self-respect and not be in a
position where they had you at their mercy! That is why I have thought of this plan
for bringing you in a little extra money. I am hoping that everyone will now
collaborate to make this Garden such a model of discipline and good management
that those who have the power to intervene, when they see how tight a discipline
you are able to keep by yourselves, will decide that there is nothing for them to
worry about and will respect you and leave you alone. Then we shall feel that the
trouble we have taken in planning this little extra income for you was justified. Think
about it!’
The women were all smiles of pleasure:
‘You’re right, Miss Bao. Don’t worry, Mrs Zhu and young ladies both! We should be
lost souls indeed if we didn’t show a bit of consideration for you after you have been
so kind and thoughtful to us!’
At that moment Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife came in:
‘The Zhen family from Nanking arrived in town yesterday. Today they have gone to
the Palace to offer their felicitations. Some of their people have just arrived here to
pay their respects. They have brought presents with them.’
She held out the list of presents with both hands. Tan-chun took it from her and ran
her eye over it:

Imperial use decorated satins and mang satins                               12 lengths
Imperial use satins, various 12 lengths
Imperial use gauzes, in different shades     12 lengths
Imperial use Palace taffetas 12 lengths
Official use satins, gauzes, taffetas and damasks in various colours   24 lengths

When Li Wan too had seen the list, she told Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife to use the largest size
of gratuity packet for tipping the bearers with. She also sent someone to report to
Grandmother Jia, who sent word back that Li Wan, Tan-chun and Bao-chai were to
come over and inspect the presents. After they had done so, Li Wan told the women
in charge of the store-room to wait until Lady Wang had got back and had a look at
them before putting them into store.
‘The Zhens are rather special people,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You had better use
one of the largest gratuity packets when you are tipping the bearers. And you’d
better get some cloth-lengths ready: I expect we shall have some of their women
arriving shortly, to pay their respects.’
   The words were scarcely out of her mouth when the arrival of four women from
the Zhen household was announced. Grandmother Jia at once gave orders that they
should be brought in. All four were sober matrons of forty years or more and so
genteelly dressed that it would have been im?possible to guess from their
appearance that they were servants. When the formal salutations and the inquiries
after Grand?mother Jia’s health had been completed, the old lady called for
footstools to be brought for them to sit on. They acknowledged the courtesy but
waited until Bao-chai and the others were seated before they would sit down
themselves. When Grandmother Jia asked them when they had arrived in town, they
stood up again to reply:
   ‘We arrived yesterday. Today Her Ladyship has had to take our young lady to the
Palace, so she has sent us to offer you her respects and ask after the young ladies.’
   ‘It’s many years since they have been to the capital,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s
rather unexpected, that they should suddenly turn up like this.’
  The women smiled:
  ‘Yes, madam. They had an Imperial Summons to come this year.’
‘Have they all come?’ said Grandmother Jia.
  ‘No, madam. Her Old Ladyship and the young master and our fourth and fifth
young ladies and the other ladles all stayed at home. Only Her Ladyship and our third
young lady have accompanied the Master on this journey.’
  ‘Is your third young lady betrothed yet?’ said Grandmother Jia.
  ‘No, madam, not yet.’
  ‘Your first and second young ladies both married into families on very good terms
with ours,’ said Grandmother Jia.
  ‘Yes, madam,’ said the spokeswoman. ‘Every year when they write home they tell
us how much they are beholden to you for your kind concern.’
  Grandmother Jia laughed deprecatingly:
  ‘One could hardly call it that. Our families have known each other for so long and
we are connected by marriage: it’s only right that we should take an interest in them.
We are particularly fond of your second young lady. She is so unassuming, in spite of
her rank. I think I could say, without offence, that we have grown quite attached to
her.’
  The women laughed:
  ‘You are too polite, madam.’
Grandmother Jia pursued her questioning:
‘Your young master lives with his grandmother, then?’
 ‘Yes, madam.’
 ‘How old is he? Has he started school yet?’
   ‘Thirteen this year,’ said the woman. ‘He has started school, but he is always
playing truant. He has always been naughty, since he was little. He’s a good-looking
boy, though, and his grandmother’s favourite, so there’s not much his father and
mother can do about it.’
   Grandmother Jia was greatly diverted.
   ‘Just like us! And what is his name?’
   ‘Well, because she says he is her “treasure” and because he has such a milky-white
complexion, his grandmother calls him “Bao-yu”. That means “Precious Jade”, you
see.’
   Grandmother Jia turned to Li Wan, laughing:
   ‘Fancy that! He’s even called Bao-yu, too.’
   Li Wan inclined politely
   ‘Coincidences over names have always been common, whether among
contemporaries or among people of different periods.’
   ‘We did wonder, after he was given this name, whether there wasn’t some family
of our acquaintance in the capital in which the name had already been used,’ said the
woman; ‘but as it was ten or more years since we’d been there, we couldn’t
remember for sure whether there was or not.’
   ‘It’s my grandson’s name,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Come here, someone.’
   ‘Hei!’ shouted the womenservants in attendance, and a few of them stepped
forward.
   ‘Go over to the Garden and tell our Bao-yu to come here so that our visitors can
have a look at him and tell us how he compares with their Bao-yu.’
The women hurried off in obedience to her order and returned after ten minutes or
so with Bao-yu in their midst. When the four women from the Zhen household saw
him enter, they hurriedly rose to their feet.
   ‘You gave us quite a turn,’ they said. ‘If we hadn’t been here and had met you in
some other place, we’d have thought that our own Bao-yu must have followed after
to join us!’
   They took him by the hand and made much of him, plying him with all sorts of
questions. Bao-yu smiled back at them and greeted them politely.
   ‘Well, how does he compare with yours?’ Grandmother Jia asked them.
   ‘It would appear that the two Bao-yus are very like each other from what they
have already said,’ Li Wan remarked.
   ‘I doubt such a coincidence is possible,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Children of the
upper classes, especially if they are reared delicately and provided they are not
pock-marked or ill-favoured, are all much of a muchness as far as good looks are
concerned. There would be nothing remarkable in a slight resemblance between
them.’
   ‘In appearance he is exactly like our Bao-yu,’ said the women; ‘but though Your
Ladyship was saying just now that he is mischievous, I think your Bao-yu must be
better-tempered than ours.’
   ‘Oh?’ said Grandmother Jia, immediately interested. ‘Why do you think that?’
   ‘Because he let us hold his hand just now when we talked to him. If it had been our
young gentleman, he would have called us “old fools”. We are not allowed to lay a
finger on any of his things even, let alone take him by the hand. The only servants he
will have about him are young girls.’
   Before they could go on, Li Wan, Tan-chun and Bao-chai had burst out laughing.
Grandmother Jia was laughing too:
   ‘I’m sure that if I were to send some of my women to see your Bao-yu now and
they took him by the hand, he would somehow or other contrive to put up with it.
Children brought up in families like ours, no matter how odd or eccentric they may
be, will always conduct themselves in a courteous, well-bred manner in the presence
of strangers. Otherwise their eccentricity would not be tolerated. In fact, the reason
why grown-ups are so fond of them, though partly because of their good looks, is
mainly because their beautiful manners - much better than many a grown-up’s -
make it such a pleasure to be with them. No one meeting them can help liking them,
and that makes us more tolerant of what they do on their own, when they are out of
sight. But if they were to carry on in exactly the same way all the time, never allowing
the grown-ups to get a word in edgeways, they would be fit for nothing but a
whipping.’
‘That’s true, madam,’ said the women, smiling. ‘Although our Bao-yu is so odd and
mischievous, he can at times, when he is with visitors, behave himself better than a
grown-up, so that it’s a pleasure to watch him. No one who meets him can help liking
him. Often they ask us what his father should want to beat him for, not realizing what
a holy terror he can be inside the family. Sir Zhen and Lady Zhen are driven half
distracted by him. If it were just his wilfulness, which is fairly normal in a child, it
could be cured in time; so could his extravagance, which is normal in the sons of
well-to-do people; and so could his hatred of study, which again is fairly normal in a
young person. But this weird perverseness of his seems to be inbred: there seems to
be no cure for it.’
   Just then Lady Wang’s return was announced. She went straight up to
Grandmother Jia on entering and saluted her, after which she received the
salutations of the four visitors and exchanged a few words with them.
   ‘You are tired,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Go and rest’
Lady Wang served her mother-in-law with some tea before withdrawing to her own
apartment. Shortly after she had gone, the four women took their leave of
Grandmother Jia and went to join her. Lady Wang chatted with them for a while
about family affairs before sending them on their way - suitably primed, of course,
with messages and gratuities: but those are details which need not concern us.

*

Greatly tickled by what the women had told her, Grandmother Jia, for some time
after their visit) would announce to anyone who came to see her:
There is another Bao-yu, you know, exactly like our Bao-yu in every particular.’
The other memhers of the family, bearing in mind that the world was a large place
and instances of the same name among its innumerable upper-class families
probably of not very rare occurrence, and that a grandmother who doted on her
grandson was a fairly unremarkable phenomenon, were unimpressed by the
coincidence and gave little thought to it. But Bao-yu, convinced, like many another
young gentleman, of his own uniqueness, dismissed what the four women had said
as a fabrication designed to give pleasure to his grandmother. He was taunted about
it by Xiang-yun when he visited her in her sick-room in the Garden to see how she
was getting on.
‘You’ll be able to get up to all sorts of mischief now,’ she said. ‘Previously it was a
case of

The single strand makes not a thread Nor the single tree a wood.

We thought there was only one of you. But now you know you are a pair, there will
be no stopping you. If your father beats you really badly, you can always run off to
Nanking and get this other Bao-yu to stand in for you!’
‘You don’t believe that rubbish, do you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘How could there be another
Bao-yu?’
‘There was a Lin Xiang-ru in the Warring States period and a Si-ma Xiang-ru under
the Former Han,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Yes, but this one’s supposed to look the same as well,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s not
something you can find precedents for, surely?’
‘What about when the men of Kuang mistook Confucius for Yang Huo?’ said
Xiang-yun.
Confucius and Yang Huo may have looked the same,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they didn’t
have the same name. Lin xiang?ru and Si-ma Xiang-ru had the same name but they
didn’t look alike. We are supposed both to have the same name and to look the same.
It isn’t possible.’
Xiang-yun, unable to think of a reply, took the easy way out.
‘Pleathe yourthelf. Whether it is or whether it isn’t, it’s of no concern to me.’
And she lay back on the bed and closed her eyes.
But Bao-yu’s confidence was shaken. Had he a double? When he told himself that he
couldn’t possibly, he now began to feel that perhaps after all he had. On the other
hand how could he be sure that he had when he had never seen him? Brooding on
this uncertainty, he went back to his room and lay down on his bed to ponder it in
silence. Soon he had drifted into sleep.
He was in a garden, which, he remarked with surprise, bore some resemblance to
Prospect Garden. While he was still puzzling over the similarity, he became aware
that some girls were coming towards him, all of them maids. Again he was surprised:
‘Strange that there should be another lot of maids here like Faithful and Aroma and
Patience!’
He observed that they were laughing at him:
‘Bao-yu, what are you doing here?’
Bao-yu, naturally supposing that they meant him, smiled back at them:
‘I’ve strayed in here by accident. I think this garden must belong to some friend or
other of my family. Won’t you take me with you and show me round it?’
‘It isn’t our Bao-yu after all,’ said the girls. ‘He’s not bad-looking, though, and he
sounds reasonably intelligent.’
‘Tell me,’ said Bao-yu eagerly, ‘is there another Bao-yu here then?’
‘Bao-yu?’ rejoined one of the girls sharply. ‘We have Her Old Ladyship’s and Her
Ladyship’s orders to use that name as much as possible as a means of bringing him
luck and Bao-yu likes to hear us use it; but what business has a boy like you from
some remote place outside to be making free with it? Don’t let them catch you doing
that here, boy or they’ll flay your backside for you!’
‘Come, let’s be going,’ said another. ‘We don’t want Bao-yu to see him.’
‘Don’t let’s stand here talking to the nasty creature,’ said a third. ‘We shall be
contaminated!’
And they hurried off.
Bao-yu was nonplussed.
‘No one has ever been as horrid as that to me before. I wonder why they are? And I
wonder if there really is another person exactly like me here.’
As he mused on the unaccountable hostility of the maids, his feet were carrying him
along in no particular direction and presently he found himself inside a courtyard. He
looked around him in some surprise:
‘Strange! There’s even a place like Green Delights here.’
He mounted the steps of the verandah and walked inside the building. Someone was
lying there on a bed. On the other side of the room were some maids, some of them
sewing, some of them giggling over a game they were playing. Presently the person
on the bed - it was a youth - could he heard to sigh and one of the maids laughingly
inquired what he was sighing for.
‘Aren’t you asleep, Bao-yu? I suppose you are worried about your cousin’s illness
again and imagining all sorts of foolish things about her.’
Bao-yu heard this with some astonishment. He listened while the youth on the bed
replied:
‘I heard Grandmother say that there is another Bao-yu in the capital who is exactly
like me, but I didn’t believe her. I’ve just been having a dream in which I went into a
large garden and met some girls there who called me a “nasty creature” and
wouldn’t have anything to do with me. I managed to find this Bao-yu’s room, but he
was asleep. What I saw was only an empty shell lying there on the bed. I was
wondering where the real person could have got to.’
‘I came here looking for Bao-yu. Are you Bao-yu then?’ Bao-yu could not help
blurting out.
The youth leaped down from the bed and seized Bao-yu by the hands:
‘So you are Bao-yu, and this isn’t a dream after all?’
‘Of course it isn’t a dream,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It couldn’t be more real!’
Just then someone arrived with a summons:
‘The Master wants to see Bao-yu.’
For a moment the two Bao-yus were stunned; and then one Bao-yu hurried off and
the other Bao-yu was left calling after him:
‘Come back, Bao-yu! Come back, Bao-yu!’
Aroma heard him calling his own name in his sleep and shook him awake.
‘Where’s Bao-yu?’ she asked him jokingly.
Though awake, Bao-yu had not yet regained consciousness of his surroundings. He
pointed to the doorway:
‘He’s only just left. He can’t have got very far.’
‘You’re still dreaming,’ Aroma said, amused. ‘Rub your eyes and have another look.
That’s the mirror. You’re looking at your own reflection in the mirror.’
Bao-yu leaned forward and looked the doorway he had pointed to was his
dressing-mirror. He joined Aroma in laughing at himself.
Seeing him awake, maids were already at hand with a spittoon and a cup of strong
tea for him to rinse his mouth with. Musk recalled Grandmother Jia’s strictures
against young people having too many mirrors around them.
‘She says that when you’re young your soul isn’t fully formed yet, and if you’re
reflected in mirrors too often, it can give your soul a shock which causes you to have
bad dreams. Fancy putting your bed right in front of that great mirror! It’s all right as
long as it’s kept covered, but sometimes when you’ve been out to the front,
especially in hot weather when you’re feeling tired, they forget to cover it. That’s
what must have happened just now. And you must have been looking at yourself in it
before you dropped off to sleep. That would be a sure way of bringing on a bad
dream. And it would explain why you were calling your own name out in your sleep.
Let’s move this bed inside, away from the mirror, for goodness sake!’
Just then a message arrived for Bao-yu from Lady Wang saying that she wanted to
see him.
But as to what it was she wanted to see him about: that will be revealed in the
chapter which follows.
CHAPTER 57

Nightingale tests Jade Boy with a startling message
And Aunt Xue comforts Frowner with
words of loving kindness



Obedient to the summons, Bao-yu hurried from the Garden and over to his mother’s
apartment. It appeared that she was about to pay a call on Lady Zhen and wanted to
take him with her. Bao-yu was delighted and hurried back again to get changed.
The Zhens’ town house was very much like the Ning and Rong establishments - if
anything, a shade more opulent. In answer to Bao-yu’s questioning, Lady Zhen
assured him that there was indeed a Bao-yu in Nanking. She kept the two of them to
dinner and they stayed there for the rest of the day. Bao-yu was at last convinced.
As soon as they got back in the evening, Lady Wang made arrangements for
entertaining Lady Zhen. A first-class dinner was ordered, a well-known troupe of
adult players engaged, and Lady Zhen and her daughter were invited to come over
next day. The day after that mother and daughter left town. They had no time for
farewells: Sir Zhen had been ordered back to his post.
It was on the day of their departure that Bao-yu, after visiting Xiang-yun and finding
that she was distinctly on the mend, went over to see how Dai-yu was getting on,
only to be told that she was taking her afternoon nap. Nightingale chanced to be
sitting outside in the covered walk doing some sewing, so, not wishing to disturb
Dai-yu, he went over to talk to Nightingale instead.
‘How was she last night? Is her cough any better?’
‘Yes, a bit better,’ said Nightingale.
‘Thank the Lord for that!’ said Bao-yu fervently. ‘If only she could shake it off
altogether!’
Nightingale looked up at him with amusement:
‘It’s not often we hear you calling on the Lord.’
Bao-yu returned her smile:
‘Any doctor will do in an emergency.’
His eye took in her costume as he said this: a cotton-padded dress of thin
black-and-white material with only a lined black satin waistcoat over the top of it. He
reached out his hand to feel it.
‘What you’re wearing is much too thin for this time of year. You’re sitting in a
draught here as well. If you go sick too, things here will be in a pretty pickle!’
‘Look,’ said Nightingale sharply, ‘let’s just talk to each other in future, shall we,
without any of this pawing about? Now that we’re all beginning to grow up, it creates
such a bad impression. However much that horrible lot over there say things about
you behind your back, you still carry on the same as when you were little. It won’t do.
Miss Lin has warned us time and again about getting into conversations with you.
Look at the way she behaves towards you herself nowadays: she can’t keep far
enough away from you.’
She rose to her feet as she said this and moved, with her sewing, into the house.
The effect of this rebuff on Bao-yu’s feelings was as if a bowl of icy water had been
emptied over him. For some moments he was stunned and stood gazing stupidly at
the clump of bamboos that were growing in front of him; then, as he became
gradually aware that Mamma Zhu, to whose expert care they had been entrusted,
was rooting about in their midst, he took himself off, but still in a daze, and scarcely
aware what he was doing. Presently he sat down on a rock somewhere to think.
Tears rolled down his cheeks, but he did not feel them. For an hour or more he
continued to sit there motionless, turning the same question, ‘What am I to do?’,
over and over in his mind, but never reaching a con?clusion.
Snowgoose, sent on an errand to fetch ginseng from Lady Wang’s, passed by him on
her way back. As she glanced sideways from the path, she saw a figure sitting
motionless on a rock underneath a peach-tree, chin cupped in hand and evidently
lost in thought, which she recognized, with some surprise, as Bao-yu.
‘It’s ever so cold,’ she thought: ‘what can he be doing, all on his own out here?
They say that sickly people are specially liable to catch things in spring. Perhaps he’s
gone mental.’
She went over to where he was sitting and, squatting down in front of him, peered
smilingly into his face.
‘What are you doing out here?’
Bao-yu noticed her with a start.
‘Why do you come up to me like this? You’re a girl, aren’t you? She’s told you all
not to have anything to do with me, for fear of creating a scandal; so why do you still
come up to me? If we’re seen here talking together) there’ll only be more gossip. Go
back home!’
Snowgoose assumed that Dai-yu had been upsetting him and continued on her way.
When she got back to the Naiad’s House, Dai-yu was still asleep, so she gave the
ginseng to Nightingale.
‘What was Her Ladyship doing?’ Nightingale asked her.
‘She was having an afternoon nap, too. That’s why I was so long. I’ll tell you
something that will make you laugh, Night. While I was sitting in the servants’ room
talking to Silver and waiting for Her Ladyship to get up, who should look in but Mrs
Zhao, and beckoned me over to her. And do you know what she wanted? They’re
burying her brother tomorrow and she’s got leave from Her Ladyship to go there for
the wake. Young Fortune’s going with her, and she said Fortune hasn’t got anything
to wear, would I please lend her my pale-blue dress? Well, I thought to myself,
Fortune’s got just as many dresses as I have; the only reason she wants to borrow
some?one else’s is because she’s too mean to let her wear her own there and risk
getting it dirtied. I wouldn’t mind lending it to her - even if she dirtied it, it wouldn’t
matter all that much - but what has she ever done for us? So I said, “Miss Lin told me
to hand all my clothes and jewellery to Nightingale to look after. I should have to see
Nightingale about it first, and I should have to tell Miss Lin. It might take rather a long
time. I might not be able to get it to you before you go,” I said. “Perhaps it would be
safer to borrow someone else’s.”‘
Nightingale laughed.
‘You’re an artful little minx, aren’t you? You don’t wantto lend her your dress, but
you take very good care that it’s me and Miss Lin that get blamed for refusing it, and
not you. Is Mrs Zhao going now, then, or first thing tomorrow?’
‘Now,’ said Snowgoose. ‘She’s probably already left.’
Nightingale nodded.
‘It looks as if Miss Lin’s still asleep,’ said Snowgoose. ‘If it wasn’t her, I wonder who
it was that made Bao-yu so upset. He was sitting Out there in the Garden crying.’
‘Oh?’ said Nightingale sharply. ‘Where?’
‘Under that peach-tree behind Drenched Blossoms Pavi?lion.’
Nightingale hurriedly put down her sewing and stood up. ‘You take over in case she
calls. If she wants me, tell her I’ll be back directly.’
She sped off to look for Bao-yu. There was a reassuring smile on her face as she came
up to him.
‘That was only a harmless little remark I made, and it was only for your own and
everyone else’s good. Why did you need to get in such a passion and go rushing off to
sit in the wind here and cry? Suppose you were to get ill as a result of this.’
Immediately Bao-yu was his smiling self once more:
‘I wasn’t in a passion. I thought what you said was very reasonable. What upset me
was the thought that if you felt that way, then other people must feel that way too, in
which case soon everyone would stop having anything to do with me.’
Nightingale sat down companionably at his side.
‘A short while ago you moved away from me when I was standing opposite you,’
said Bao-yu. ‘Now, apparently, it is all right to sit close beside me.’
‘I suppose you’ve forgotten the time when you and Miss Lin were talking together
and Mrs Zhao burst in on you,’ said Nightingale. ‘That was what made me careful.
Now I’ve just heard that she’s away, so it’s quite safe. Incidentally, there’s something
about that occasion I’ve always wanted to ask you. You were about to say something
about bird’s nest when she came in but didn’t have a chance to finish; and you’ve
never referred to it since.’
‘Oh, it was nothing important,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s just that once you start taking
bird’s nest, you’ve got to keep it up, and it seemed to me that as Cousin Bao is really
here as our guest, it would be rather boorish to keep asking her for more; on the
other hand it would be rather awkward to have to ask Lady Wang for it; so I dropped
a hint to Grandma, and I rather think that she had a word on the subject with Feng.
That’s all I was going to tell Dai when we were interrupted. I’ve since heard that
you’re getting an ounce a day regularly, so there hasn’t seemed any need to mention
it.
‘Oh, so it was you who told her about it,’ said Nightingale. ‘In that case we owe you
our thanks. We couldn’t think what it was that could have suddenly put it into her
head.’
‘She should take it regularly, every day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If she can keep it up for two
or three years, she should get completely better.’
‘It’s easy enough now,’ said Nightingale, ‘but where will she find the money for it
next year, when she goes home?’
Bao-yu was startled.
‘When who goes home? What home?’
‘When your Cousin Dai goes back to Soochow.’
Bao-yu laughed:
‘You’re joking. Soochow is where her father came from, I know. But the reason we
brought her here in the first place was because when my Aunt Lin died there was no
one to look after her. There wouldn’t be anyone in Soochow for her to go to. You
must be lying.’
‘How arrogant you are I’ said Nightingale scornfully. ‘I suppose you think yours is
the only big family in the world. According to you, I suppose, other people only have
fathers and mothers: they couldn’t possibly have uncles and aunts on their father’s
side like you do. As a matter of fact, when Miss Lin came here it wasn’t because there
weren’t any relations of her father’s that she could have gone to; it was because Her
Old Ladyship was afraid that being so little she might not be as happy with them as
she would with her mother’s folk. But it was only ever her intention to keep her here
for a few years. As soon as she’s old enough to be married, she’ll have to go back to
the Lin family. You could hardly expect a Lin family girl to spend the rest of her days
among Jias, now could you? The Lins may be too poor to afford a square meal, but
they are people of education. They’d never sink so low as to hand over responsibility
for one of their own number to their marriage-kin. Next year - next spring at the
earliest, but certainly not later than next autumn - either your family will send her
back to them or the Lins themselves will come here to fetch her. Miss Lin was talking
to me about it only the other night. She said I was to ask you to get together all the
little presents she’s ever given you and send them back to her, and she’ll do the same
with yours.’
To Bao-yu these words were like a thunderclap exploding immediately overhead.
Nightingale waited to see how he would reply, but he made no sound. Growing at
last im?patient, she was about to speak to him again when Skybright appeared. She
had been looking for him everywhere, she said. He was wanted by his grandmother.
‘He’s been here all this time talking about Miss Lin’s ill-ness,’ said Nightingale. ‘I
keep telling him how she is, but he won’t believe me. If you want him to go with you,
you’ll have to take hold of him and make him go.’
She left then, without waiting to see more.
Skybright noticed Bao-yu’s vacant expression. His forehead was beaded with sweat
and there was a red, inflamed look about his face. She seized him by the hand and
hurried him back to Green Delights.
Aroma was naturally alarmed to see Bao-yu come back in such a state, but attributed
it to the weather: it was an in-clement spring and he had gone out while overheated
and exposed himself to the wind. But it soon became ap?parent that feverishness
was the least serious of his symp?toms. His eyes had a fixed and glassy stare, a little
trickle of saliva ran from each corner of his mouth, and he seemed to have lost all
consciousness of what he was doing: when they brought him a pillow he lay down;
when they pulled him by the hand he sat up again; when they handed him a cup of
tea he drank it; but all with the mechanical movements of an automaton. The maids,
when they saw this, were in a panic; but not daring to report yet to Grandmother Jia,
they first sent for Nannie Li to tell them what was wrong.
Nannie Li came promptly. Before she did anything else, she spent a good long while
simply observing him. Then she asked him a few questions, but he made no reply.
Then she took his wrist in her hand and felt his pulse. Finally, taking the raphe of his
lip between her thumb and finger, she pinched it a couple of times, so hard that a
deep imprint was made by her nails: yet he seemed to feel nothing.
‘Lord a mercy!’ cried the old woman in a pathetic voice, and clinging to his body,
she set up a howl and wept. Aroma, beside herself with anxiety, tugged imploringly
at her sleeve:
‘Nannie, Nannie, have another look at him and tell us how serious it is, so that we
know what to say to Their Ladyships. Don’t just cry!’
Nannie Li hammered the bed with her fists:
‘It’s all up with him, I tell you. All the heartache I’ve had on account of him was
wasted.’
Aroma and the girls who, whatever else they might think of Nannie Li, respected her
age and experience, assumed that she must know what she was talking about and all
began crying too.
Skybright now told Aroma the circumstances in which she had found Bao-yu.
Without a moment’s hesitation Aroma flew over to the Naiad’s House, arriving just
as Nightingale was giving Dai-yu her medicine. Wasting no time on civility, she stalked
straight up to Nightingale and confronted her there and then.
‘What did you say just now to our Bao-yu? Just go and take a look at him, will you,
then go and tell Her Old Lady ship, because I won’t be responsible.’
She concluded by sitting down rudely in a chair.
The sight of Aroma, with her angry, tear-stained face, behaving in a way that was so
utterly uncharacteristic of her, filled Dai-yu with alarm.
‘What is it?’
Aroma made an effort to control herself and answered tearfully:
‘I don’t know what Her Ladyship here can have said to him, but that simpleton of
ours just stares into space without speaking, his hands and feet are icy-cold, and
when Nannie Li pinches him, he doesn’t seem to feel anything. He looked half dead
when I left. Even Nannie Li said it was all up with him. She’s over there wailing for
him now. He may be already dead for all I know.’
To Dai-yu, as to the girls, Nannie Li, for all her failings, was an old woman whose
words carried the weight of experience. If she said it was all up with Bao-yu, it must
be all up with him. There was a horrible sickening sound as she vomited up the
medicine she had just taken, followed by a dreadful paroxysm of silent coughing that
seemed to rack every nerve and fibre of her body. She coughed until her face was
scarlet and her hair was in disorder, until her eyes bulged and the veins stood out on
her forehead, coughed until she was so breathless that she was unable to lift her face
up from the bed. Nightingale at once began thumping her, but Dai-yu raised herself
with an effort from the pillow and, after struggling for some moments to regain her
breath, pushed her away:
‘Don’t do that. Get a rope and strangle me - that would be kinder!’
‘But I didn’t say anything,’ Nightingale protested. ‘I was only joking. He must have
taken me seriously.’
‘Surely you know better by now than to joke with him?’ said Aroma. ‘He’s such a
fool, he always takes everything seriously.’
‘Whatever it was you said to him,’ said Dai-yu, ‘you’d better go over there straight
away and unsay it. That might bring him back to his senses.’
Nightingale climbed hurriedly off the bed and accompanied Aroma to Green Delights.
Unfortunately Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang were also there when they arrived. At
the sight of Nightingale, Grandmother Jia’s eyes flashed angrily.
‘Wicked creature! What did you say to him?’
‘I didn’t say anything,’ said Nightingale. ‘I was only pulling his leg.’
There was a sudden ‘Aiya!’ from the bed. It was Bao-yu, who had just caught sight of
Nightingale and who now, to everyone’s relief, burst into tears.
Grandmother Jia seized hold of Nightingale and thrust her towards him. She
supposed that Nightingale had offended Bao-yu in some way and that he would find
relief in beating her. To her surprise, instead of doing any such thing, he clung to her
imploringly:
‘If you’re going, take me with you!’
No one could make head or tall of this until Nightingale had been questioned and
explained to them the nature of her hoax.
‘So that’s all it was!’ said Grandmother Jia in tears. ‘And I was thinking it must be
something serious!’ She chided Nightingale, but less unkindly now: ‘You’re normally
such a sensible girl. Surely you know he’s inclined to be a bit simple at times? What
on earth possessed you to tease him like that?’
Aunt Xue urged a less serious view of Bao-yu’s derangement:
‘It’s true that he is a simple-hearted child; but his Cousin Lin came here when they
were both little and they have grown up together and are closer to each other than
any of the other children. I think you would expect him to be upset, suddenly out of
the blue like that being told that she was going away. Never mind a simple-hearted
child, I should think even a sophisticated grown-up would be! This isn’t a serious
illness, Lady Jia. I’m sure you and my sister have no reason to feel worried. A dose or
two of medicine and he’ll be perfectly all right again.’
Just at that moment the wives of Lin Zhi-xiab and Lai Da were announced, ‘come to
see how the young master was’.
‘How thoughtful of them!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them to come in.
But at the sound of the name ‘Lin’ Bao-yu began threshing about wildly on the bed,
calling out that the Lins had come to fetch Dai-yu and insisting that they should be
sent away.
‘Yes, send them away,’ said Grandmother Jia, while at the same time she did her
best to soothe him: ‘There, there, there. That wasn’t anyone from the Lin family. The
Lins all died out long ago. There aren’t any of them left to fetch her. Don’t worry!’
‘I don’t care who it was,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I don’t want any Lins here, apart from Cousin
Lin.’
‘There aren’t any Lins here,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘All the Lins in this place have
been sent away.’
   She turned to the servants:
   ‘In future Lin Zhi-xlao’s wife is not to be allowed inside the Garden. And I don’t
want the word “Lin” to pass your lips even. Is that clearly understood, everyone?’
   ‘Yes, madam,’ the servants replied in chorus, not daring to laugh.
   Presently Bao-yu’s eye chanced to light on a little metal self-propelling boat - a
West Ocean toy - which stood on one of the alcove shelves in the carved partition.
Immediately he became excited again.
   ‘Look!’ he said, pointing, ‘the ship that’s come to fetch her - that’s where they’ve
docked it, over there.’
   At a hurried order from his grandmother, Aroma took it down from the shelf. He
held his hand out to receive it, and as soon as it was in his possession, hid it under
the quilt, chuckling with satisfaction as he did so:
   ‘They won’t get away now!’
   All this time he continued to hold tightly on to Nightingale with his other hand.
   The doctor’s arrival was announced and Grandmother Jia gave orders that he
should be brought in immediately. Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the girls withdrew into
the inner room. Grandmother Jia herself continued to sit beside Bao-yu on the edge
of the bed. As her attendants also remained, there were a good many people in the
room when the doctor entered. It was Dr Wang. He paid his respects to the old lady
before proceeding to take Bao-yu’s pulse, mystified by the presence of a shame-faced
Nightingale, who, unable to leave Bao-yu’s side, could only stand there and hang her
head.
   After feeling the pulse for a while, Dr Wang rose to his feet.
   ‘The young gentleman is suffering from a delirium caused by a phlegmatic
occlusion of the cardiac orifices. The ancients recognized three main types of this
form of dementia: in the first type the delirium is associated with an anaemic
deficiency, when the body is failing to absorb its nourishment; in the second, it is
brought on by some violent emotional disturbance, such as anger; in the third, the
occlusion occurs as a result of shock. This is a delirium of the third type. In this type,
fortunately, the occlusion is only a temporary one, so it is less serious than the other
two.’
‘Just tell us whether it’s dangerous or not,’ said Grand mother Jia. ‘We’re not asking
you for a treatise on medicine.’
Dr Wang laughed deprecatingly and bowed:
‘He’ll be all right.’
‘Will he really be all right?’
‘Unquestionably,’ said the doctor. ‘I give you my word for it.
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Then perhaps you will go outside now and write
your prescription. If he recovers, I promise you a handsome reward, and Bao-yu
himself shall bring it to you and kotow to you when he brings it. But if he doesn’t get
better, I shall have the main hall of the College of Physicians pulled down about your
ears!’
‘How kind! How kind!’ The doctor, bowing and smiling at the prospect of a
‘handsome reward’ and Bao-yu kotowing at his feet, could not have heard the threat
which followed, for he continued to say ‘How kind!’ after it had been uttered and left
the room pursued by a wave of laughter.
The medicine he prescribed was soon concocted and Bao-yu did, after taking it,
become a good deal calmer. But he would not release Nightingale.
‘If she goes,’ he said, ‘I shall know that they are leaving for Soochow.’
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang saw that there was nothing for it but to let
Nightingale stay with him. Amber was sent to look after Dai-yu in her place. Dai-yu’s
other maid, Snowgoose, was kept busy running to and fro for news of Bao-yu’s
condition. By evening this was sufficiently improved for Grandmother Jia and the
other visitors to feel that they could return to their own apartments. They continued
to inquire after him by messenger, however, throughout the course of the night.
Nannie Li came again, bringing Mamma Song and several other old nannies to help
watch over him. Nightingale, Aroma, Skybright and Musk kept up a constant vigil at
his bedside throughout the night. From time to time Bao-yu would drop off, but
invariably he would wake up with a start from some dream and tearfully announce to
them either that Dai-yu had already gone or that people had come to take her away.
Each time this happened Nightingale was the only one who could calm him.
Grandmother Jia had sent over various nostrums -pills and powders she had heard
recommended as sovereign specifics in cases of mental disorder - and they used
these to dose him with when he woke up.
Next day, after another dose of Dr Wang’s medicine, Bao-yu was distinctly better. His
mind was clear now, but because he did not wish to lose Nightingale yet, he
pretended that it was still affected. Nightingale regretted what she had done and
bore the antics of this pseudo-madman and the weariness of waiting on him both
night and day with uncomplaining fortitude.
‘It’s only right that you should have to nurse him, seeing that you were the one
who set him off,’ said Aroma, relieved that Bao-yu was only play-acting. ‘You should
have known better. He’s a case, this young master of ours. Tell him the wind’s
blowing on a fine day, and next minute he can hear the rain! Heighho! What he’ll be
like when he’s grown up doesn’t bear thinking of!’
But she did not pursue the subject.
*

Xiang-yun had by now recovered completely and could drop in daily to see how
Bao-yu was progressing. As soon as he seemed normal, she treated them all to an
imitation of his madness. Her mimicry was so droll that even Bao-yu had to laugh,
shamefacedly, into his pillow. He had no recollection of what he had been like when
it all started and now, when they told him, he did not believe them.
Once, when no one was about, he took Nightingale’s hand in his own and drew her
to him.
‘Why did you scare me like that?’
‘I was pulling your leg,’ said Nightingale. ‘It was only a joke, but you took it
seriously.’
‘That was no joke,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It was too well-reasoned.’
Nightingale laughed.
‘I made it all up. There’s no Lin family - leastways, if there is, they’re very, very
distant relations, and not in Soochow, either, but scattered all over the place, in
different provinces. And even if one of them did come to take her away, Her Old
Ladyship would never let her go.’
‘I wouldn’t, even if she did,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I wonder,’ said Nightingale. ‘I think you’re only saying that. You’re not a child any
longer now. You’re already betrothed. Another two or three years, when you’re
married, you won’t have time for anyone else.’
Bao-yu heard her with astonishment.
‘Betrothed? To whom?’
Just before New Year I heard Her Old Ladyship say that she was betrothing you to
Miss Qin. That’s why she makes so much of her, isn’t it?’
Bao-yu burst out laughing.
‘Everyone calls me a simpleton, but you’re an even bigger simpleton than I am.
That was only a joke. Qin’s already betrothed to Academician Mei’s son. Do you think
I would have taken it so calmly if I had been betrothed to her? Don’t you remember
the scene we had last time, when I swore all those oaths and tried to break this
beastly thing’ - he pointed to his jade - ‘and you had such a job trying to stop me?
What are you trying to do? Start me off again?’
He ground his teeth.
‘If only I could die this minute and my heart burst out of my body so that you could
see how true it is! After that I shouldn’t care if all of me - flesh, blood and bones -
was burned to ashes, and the ashes turned to smoke, and the smoke blown by the
winds into every corner of the earth!’
Big tears rolled down his cheeks. Nightingale covered his mouth up in alarm; then, as
she wiped his eyes for him, she spoke to him soothingly as to a child:
‘There, there. There’s no need to get so worked up about it. I’m the one who needs
to worry. That’s why I said those things: to test you.’
‘You?’ said Bao-yu in surprise. ‘What have you got to be worried about?’
‘You know I never belonged to the Lin family, don’t you,’ said Nightingale. ‘I was
originally one of Her Old Ladyship’s servants, like Faithful and your Aroma. I was
transferred to Miss Lin, but as it turned out I got on very well with her -ten times
better, as a matter of fact, than the maid she brought with her from Yangchow - and
since then we’ve become inseparable. Lately I’ve been worried by the thought that
she might have to leave here - in which case, of course, I should want to go with her.
But all my family is here. If I didn’t go with her, it would seem like a betrayal after
what we’ve been to each other all these years. On the other hand if I did go, it would
mean leaving my family behind. I wasn’t sure about how serious you were in wanting
her to stay. That’s why I made those things up. I wanted to test you. I never imagined
you were going to make such an uproar, or I wouldn’t have said them.’
‘So that’s what was worrying you!’ said Bao-yu, smiling. ‘Well, you are a simpleton.
Please don’t worry about that any more. Let me try to put it for you in a nutshell. In
life we shall live together; in death we shall mingle our dust. How will that do?’
Nightingale said nothing, but appeared to be thinking. One of the old women came in
to announce that Jia Huan and Jia Lan had come to inquire after Bao-yu’s health.
‘Tell them it’s very kind of them,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but not to come in here, because
I’ve only just gone to sleep.’
‘Very good,’ said the old woman, and went off to relay the message.
‘Now that you’re better,’ said Nightingale, ‘you ought to let me go back to see how
my other invalid is getting on.’
‘Yes, you’re right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was meaning to tell you last night that you could
go back, but I forgot. I am completely better now. You can go back straight away.
Nightingale began tying up her bedding and getting her toilet things together.
‘I notice you’ve got several mirrors in your vanity box,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t you
give me that little one with the pattern of caltrops on it as a keepsake? I can keep it
by my pillow to use when I’m in bed, and it will be handy to take with me when I go
out.’
Nightingale gave him the mirror, then, having first arranged for someone to carry
over her things, took leave of the other maids and returned on her own to the
Naiad’s House.
During the past few days Dai-yu’s anxiety for Bao-yu had led to a relapse and had
been the occasion of several fits of weeping. On inquiring nervously why Nightingale
had returned, she was relieved to hear that it was because Bao-yu was better. As
Amber’s services were now no longer needed, she sent her back to Grandmother Jia.
That night, when all the others had gone to bed and she had undressed and was lying
not far off from her mistress, Nightingale addressed her, in guarded undertone, on
the subject of Bao-yu’s intentions.
‘Bao-yu really is a simple soul. Do you know what made him ill? It was because he
heard that we were going away.’
Dai-yu said nothing. After waiting in vain for a reply, Nightingale went on as if
speaking to herself.
‘Much better stay where we are. You couldn’t ask for a better family than this. And
the two of you have grown up together and know each other’s likes and dislikes.
Where else would you find someone who understood you so well?’
Dai-yu snorted at her disgustedly.
‘Aren’t you tired after all your exertions during these last few days? I can’t
understand why, instead of chattering away to yourself, you don’t take this
opportunity to get a bit of rest.’
‘It isn’t lust chatter,’ said Nightingale. ‘I’m concerned about your future, Miss. It’s
been worrying me for years. You’ve no father or mother or brothers: there’s no one
else who will concern themselves about it. The important thing is to get it all
properly settled while Her Old Ladyship is still well and in her right mind. You know
what they say: “Good health in the old is like warm weather in winter: you can’t
depend on it.” If anything were suddenly to happen to her, the chance of getting
someone you really liked would have passed you by. No doubt they would do their
best to marry you to some?one of good family, but look how many of these young
aristocrats keep concubines, and how changeable they are in their affections. Some
of them if they were married to the Queen of Heaven would tire of her in a week.
And neglect is not the worst part of it; often there are hard words and harsh
treatment to follow. When that happens, if the wife has a powerful family to stick up
for her, it isn’t so bad; but what about someone in your position? As long as Her Old
Ladyship is alive you’ll be all right, but once she’s gone, you’ll be at everyone’s mercy.
That’s why I say we’ve got to make our minds up.

Easier a golden hoard to win
Than find one understanding heart.

You’re a clever young lady. I’m sure you must know that saying.’
‘This girl’s gone out of her mind,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Just these few days away and she’s
come back completely altered. I shall have to tell Her Old Ladyship about this
tomorrow and get her to take you back. I’m afraid you can’t stay with me any longer.’
‘I meant no harm,’ said Nightingale. ‘I’ve only told you to think about it; I haven’t
asked you to do anything wicked. Why should you tell Her Old Ladyship? It’ll only get
me into trouble, and what good will that do you?’
She said no more, and presently went to sleep.
Not so Dai-yu. However she might have concealed the fact from Nightingale, she was
deeply affected by what the maid had said, and while Nightingale slept beside her,
she lay awake weeping through the greater part of the night. The darkness was
beginning to lighten when she finally dropped off to sleep. Washing that morning
required an effort. Not long after she had finished her bird’s nest syrup, Grandmother
Jia came in person to see her and waxed eloquent on the importance of getting well.

*

It was Aunt Xue’s birthday and everyone from Grandmother Jia downwards sent her
a present. Dai-yu looked out two little articles of her own embroidering to send her.
Aunt Xue hired a troupe of child actors and threw a birthday party which everyone
except Bao-yu and Dai-yu attended. Grandmother Jia took everyone to call on them
both on her way hack from it.
Next day there was another party for the employees of the Xue family at which Xue
Ke acted as host on his aunt’s behalf. There were more festivities on the day which
followed. Altogether three or four days were spent just in celebrating the one
birthday.
Aunt Xue was very impressed with what she had seen of Xing Xiu-yan. She was such a
refined, serious girl, in spite of her unfortunate upbringing: the very model of ‘virtue
in homespun and a wooden hairpin’. Aunt Xue had thought of her as a possible
daughter-in-law, but when she reflected on the lawless nature of her son, it seemed a
pity that so nice a girl should be thrown away on him. She was still trying to make her
mind up about this when suddenly it occurred to her that Xue Ke was not yet
betrothed and that he and Xiu?-yan would make an ideal couple. She decided to ask
Xi-feng for her advice. Xi-feng was enthusiastic.
‘But you know how difficult Lady Xing can be,’ she said. ‘Why don’t you leave it to
me, Auntie? Let me deal with it in my own time.’
She found her opportunity of broaching the subject when Grandmother Jia next
came to call on her.
‘There’s something my Aunt Xue wants you to do for her, Grannie, but she’s a little
bit shy of asking.’
‘Oh? What’s that?’ said Grandmother Jia.
She laughed when Xi-feng explained.
‘Good gracious, that’s nothing to be shy about! It’s a splendid idea. Let me have a
talk with your mother-in-law about this. She won’t refuse, I promise you.’
As soon as she was back in her own apartment, she summoned Lady Xing and
proposed the match to her, urging its suitability in forceful terms.
Lady Xing did some rapid thinking: the Xue family were of respectable origins; they
were immensely rich; Xue Ke was a good-looking boy; and Grandmother Jia was
making herself responsible for the match. Confident that she would be able to turn it
to her own advantage, she assented, to Grandmother Jia’s intense satisfaction,
without more ado. The presence of Aunt Xue was now requested and the
self-abasing civilities customary on these occasions exchanged between her and Lady
Xing. When these had somewhat abated, Lady Xing sent someone to inform Xing
Xiu-yan’s parents, Xing De-?quan and his wife, of the Xue family’s proposal. Living as
they now did on Lady Xing’s charity, they were scarcely in a position to refuse even if
they wanted to, and the messenger was soon back again reporting their prompt and
enthusiastic acceptance.
‘I love meddling in other people’s affairs,’ said Grandmother Jia jovially. ‘I seem to
have meddled successfully in this one. I hope I am going to be paid something for my
services.’
‘Of course,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘The only difficulty will be knowing how much to give
you. What shall we say? Ten thousand taels? Probably you would regard that as too
little! What we really need is a sponsor to settle these matters for us.’
‘We may be short of manpower in this family,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘but I dare say
we could rustle up a couple of cripples for you!’
She sent someone to fetch You-shi and her daughter-in-law from Ning-guo House. As
soon as they arrived, she explained why she had invited them, whereupon they
turned to the other two ladies and offered them their congratulations.
‘Now,’ said Grandmother Jia when they had finished, ‘you know our way of doing
things in this family, don’t you - you know we never haggle about bride-prices and
“face” and that sort of thing? We want you to act as a third party and settle this for
us. What we want is a settlement that is not too lavish and yet not too economical:
something between the two. And when you’ve worked out what each of the parties
should contribute, come and tell me what you have decided.’
You-shi promptly agreed to do this. Aunt Xue, delighted that everything had gone off
so well, hurried home and at once had a formal invitation to act as marriage-sponsor
drawn up and sent over to Ning-guo House to confirm the arrangement.
You-shi knew Lady Xing too well to want to be mixed up in any affairs - particularly
one of a pecuniary nature - to which she was a party. She had agreed in this instance
only because Grandmother Jia had asked her to and she could not very well refuse. In
the event she simply arranged matters in the way she thought would best please
Lady Xing. Aunt Xue was a very accommodating person and could be relied on to fall
in with almost any terms. But it is not with details such as these that our narrative is
concerned.
Aunt Xue's betrothal of her nephew to Xing Xiu-yan was soon common knowledge
throughout the household. At first Lady Xing wanted to segregate the girl by moving
her in with herself, but Grandmother Jia objected.
'Surely she can stay where she is? She can't see anything of the boy, of course, but
surely there's no harm in her con?tinuing to see Mrs Xue and Bao-chai and little Qin?
They're all females, after all. It will be cosier if they get to know each other better.'
Lady Xing did not renew her offer.
And what of the parties themselves? Xue Ke and Xing Xiu-yan had met briefly on the
journey to the capital and there was no reason to suppose that they were not
extremely pleased with the betrothal. Inevitably Xiu-yan became a little more
withdrawn after it, spending rather less of her time in Bao-chai's and Bao-qin's
company and speaking, when she was in it, rather more sparingly. But this was partly
because Shi Xiang-yun was such a tease. Fortunately she was far too intelligent and
well-bred to indulge in any of that false modesty, so common among girls in her
position, which shows itself in affected simpering and ridiculous grimaces.
Ever since the day they first met, Bao-chai had felt sorry for Xiu-yan. First of all she
was so poor. And then there was her father. Unlike most of the fathers that Bao-chai
knew about - grave gentlemen who had gained wisdom with their years - Xiu-yan's
father was a drunken sot who took little interest in his daughter's welfare. As for Lady
Xing, Bao-chai could see that the affection she showed her niece was simu?lated and
that really she did not care for her in the least. And Ying-chun, whose apartment she
shared, was too docile to assert herself even on her own behalf, let alone anyone
else's.
Since Xiu-yan was too proud to ask for things, this meant that whenever anything
was lacking, even one of the simple necessities of life, she had simply to go with out
it. Knowing this, Bao-chai did all she could to anticipate her wants; but she gave by
stealth, careful lest Lady Xing, who was sensitive to gossip, if to nothing else; should
get to hear of it.
Xiu-yan had learned to cherish Bao-chai as a special friend long before this
magnificent betrothal so wildly beyond her own and everyone else's expectations
and, after it, continued from time to time to confide in her. Bao-chai for her part
continued to treat her as an intimate friend and would use none of the formalities
that are customary between prospective sisters-in-law.
One day, when Bao-chai was on her way to visit Dai-yu, she caught sight of Xiu-yan,
who, as it happened, was also on her way there. Bao-chai smiled and beckoned and
waited for Xiu-yan to catch up with her. The two girls then walked on together until
they came to the rear side of a miniature moun?tain of rock. There, where no prying
eyes could see them, Bao-chai stopped again.
'The weather is still really cold. Why have you changed Out of your winter clothes
already and put on single linings?'
Xiu-yan hung her head and said nothing. Ba-chai guessed at once that she had been
forced to pawn them.
'It must be because you haven't had this month's allowance yet,' she said. 'How could
Cousin Feng be so thoughtless?'
'No,' said Xiu-yan. 'She didn't forget. She paid the allow?ance on time. But Aunt Xing
sent someone to tell me that she thought I didn't really need two taels a month and
that I ought to contribute one of them towards my parents' upkeep. She said that if
there ever was anything I needed, I could always hent it from Cousin Ying's things' -
suppressed emotion was causing her to lapse into her native dialect -'But I ask you,
coz, how could I? Cousin Ying wouldn't mind - she is so meek - and she probably
wouldn't notice, any road. But though she wouldn't say anything, you can be quite
sure that the servants would. The nannies and maids in that apart?ment are such a
prickly lot and so spiteful with their tongues. Although I am living there, I dare not
ask them to do very much for me, and even for what little they do I am expected to
find money to buy them drinks and other little treats with every four or five days.
Even when I was getting two taels it wasn’t enough, and now it’s only one. The only
way of raising money I could think of was by pawning my winter clothes. I got
someone to slip out and do it for me the other day.’
Bao-chai sighed.
‘It’s a pity all the Mei family areaway just now. Academician Mei isn’t due back
from his posting until the year after next. if they were here in town, Bao-qin could
get married straight away and then we could go ahead with your affair and get you
out of this mess. But as things are, your Prospective will never consent to get married
before his sister, so the difficulty remains. I shall have to have a word with Mamma
about this. Obviously you can’t go on as you are. Another year or two like this and I
am afraid you will go into a decline.
‘In future, if those people are nasty to you, you must learn to put up with it. You
mustn’t make yourself ill trying to please them. Perhaps you had better hand over
the whole of your remaining tad to them when it comes: see if that will keep them
quiet. But don’t go treating them any more, whatever you do. Never mind the
spiteful things they say to you. If it gets too bad, you can always walk away. And if
you are short of anything, don’t behave like a little frightened mouse; ask me straight
out for it, without delay. I say this not because we are future sisters-in-law but
because we are friends. We are friends, aren’t we, and have been ever since you
came? If you are afraid of gossip, don’t come yourself when you want something,
send your maid for it, then no one will know.’
Xiu-yan hung her head and the reply she made was scarcely audible. In order to
change the subject, Bao-chai pointed to a green jade girdle-ring that was hanging
from her waist.
‘Who gave you that?’
‘Cousin Tan,’ said Xiu-yan.
Bao-chai nodded.
‘She must have noticed that all the other girls were wearing one of these things
and wanted to spare you the embarrass?ment of being the only one without. It is
typical of her to be so thoughtful. However, I think you ought to realize that these
sort of gewgaws are really for the daughters of mandarins and noblemen. Look at me:
you don’t see any jewellery on me. A few years ago, it’s true, I would have been
smothered with it; but I know now that we are less well off than we used to be, and
have given up wearing it as a means of economizing. No doubt when you marry you
will be provided with a whole trunkful of this stuff, In the meantime, though, we
don’t need to compete with the others in finery, you and I. As long as we are honest
and remain true to ourselves, it doesn’t matter that we cannot equal them in
appearance.’
Xiu-yan smiled.
‘In that case, I shall go back and take it off,’ she said.
‘Don’t be so precipitate,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She meant it as a kindness. If she sees you
not wearing it, she will wonder why. I spoke only in general terms, for your future
guidance.’
Xiu-yan murmured her assent.
‘Where are you going now, coz?’ she asked Bao-chai.
‘To the Naiad’s House,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Why don’t you go back now and get your
maid to bring me that pawn ticket? I’ll send someone out on the quiet to redeem the
things for you and get them round to you in the evening without anyone knowing, so
that you can begin wearing them again as soon as possible. We don’t want you
catching cold in this wind, do we? Oh, there’s just one other thing: where did you
pawn them?’
‘I think it’s called the “Reliant”,’ said Xiu-yan. ‘It’s in Drum Tower Street West.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘Well, at least they’ve stayed in the family. If the assistants realized where they had
come from, they must have thought they were receiving an advance instalment of
your trousseau!’
Xiu-yan coloured, realizing that the ‘Reliant’ must be one of the Xue family’s
businesses. She did not say anything, however, but with a little laugh hurried back to
look for the pawn ticket.
Bao-chai continued on her way to the Naiad’s House. She arrived to find her mother
already ensconced and in the midst of conversation with Dai-yu.
‘Mamma, what a surprise! When did you arrive?’
‘I’ve been so busy during these last few days that I haven’t had time to see her or
Bao-yu. Today I decided to see both of them, but both of them seem to be better.’
Dai-yu urged Bao-chai to be seated.
‘The world’s affairs are very mysterious,’ she said, by way of bringing her into the
conversation. ‘Who would ever have thought that your mother and Aunt Xing would
end up as commeres?’
‘My child,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘you are too young to understand these things. Old folk
talk about “the unseen thread that binds”. They say that marriages are decided by an
Old Man Under the Moon who joins future couples together by tying them round the
ankles with a scarlet thread, and that once he’s done that, it doesn’t matter how far
apart they are, even if there are oceans between them, sooner or later something
will happen to bring them together and they will end up husband and wife. These
things are quite unpredictable. Sometimes there will be two young people whose
parents on both sides are favourable to their union, who have lived years together in
the same place, and who take it as a foregone conclusion that they are going to
marry, yet if the Old Man Under the Moon hasn’t tied them with his scarlet thread,
then in spite of everything, they never will. Take you two girls, now: we don’t know
whether at this moment the two young men you will marry are right here under our
noses or somewhere “south of the mountains and north of the sea”!’
‘Mamma!’ said Bao-chai, burying her head in her mother’s dress, ‘how you do
always drag one in when you get talking!’
‘Look at her!’ said Dai-yu, mockingly. ‘What a great baby! She’s ever so poised and
grown-up when you aren’t here, Auntie. It’s only when she’s with you that she puts
on this little girl act.’
Aunt Xue stroked the recumbent head, still buried in her lap, and sighed indulgently.
‘I suppose it’s a bit like Cousin Feng and your grandmother. Chai can be perfectly
serious with me when things need dis?cussing, but at the same time she knows the
little ways of cheering me up - she knows that when she becomes my little girl again,
it helps me forget my troubles.’
It was Dai-yu’s turn to sigh now. A tear rolled down each cheek.
‘I don’t know why she has to do it here though unless she wants to rub in the fact
that I haven’t got a mother.’
‘Oh Mamma, just listen to that!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Who’s putting on a little girl act
now?’
‘You mustn’t blame her for being upset,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Poor child! She has no
one.’
She stroked Dai-yu’s hair and tried to comfort her.
‘Don’t cry, my dear. You mustn’t be upset because I make a fuss of your cousin. I’m
as fond of you, you know- perhaps even more so. Although Chai has no father, she
has got me and Pan so you see I know that you have the greater need. She knows
how fond I am of you, because I am always telling her. The only reason I don’t show it
more is because there are a lot of people in this household who are always ready to
put a false construction on things. If they saw me being nice to you, they would say
that I did it not for the very obvious reason that everything about you cries out to be
loved and that one can hardly help loving you, but because I saw how much your
grandmother loves you and wanted to curry favour with her.’
‘You say you love me as much as Chai,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Let me be your god-daughter
then. Don’t refuse, Auntie, or I shall think you don’t really mean it.
‘If you will have me for your godmother, I should like nothing better.’
‘Out of the question,’ said Bao-chai flatly.
‘But why?’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-chai smiled mischievously:
‘Tell me, why do you think Cousin Xing was betrothed to my Cousin Ke? Why wasn’t
she betrothed to my brother, who is Cousin Ke’s senior and who still hasn’t got a
be?trothed?’
‘I suppose because your brother is away,’ said Dai-yu, ‘or perhaps their horoscopes
are incompatible.’
‘No,’ said Bao-chai, ‘that’s not the reason. It’s because someone has already been
chosen for my brother. We are only waiting for him to come home to make it public. I
don’t need to name names. If I tell you that you can’t possibly become Mamma’s
god-daughter, you ought to be able to work it out for yourself.’
She winked at her mother and broke into a laugh.
This time it was Dai-yu who buried her face in Aunt Xue’s bosom.
‘Beat her, Auntie, beat her - I insist!’
Aunt Xue hugged her niece, laughing:
‘You mustn’t believe what she says. She’s only teasing.’
‘No, seriously, Mamma,’ said Bao-chai, ‘why don’t you ask Lady Jia some time if you
can have Cousin Lin for your daughter-in-law? You will never find a better one
elsewhere.’
Dai-yu threw herself on Bao-chai and made as if to scratch her:
‘Have you gone quite mad?’
Aunt Xue laughingly held them apart.
‘If I thought that your brother was not good enough for Xiu-yan - which is why I
betrothed her to your cousin Ke -I certainly wouldn’t inflict him on this child here.
Not so long ago Lady Jia was asking me about Bao-qin as a possible match for Bao-yu,
but I had to tell her that Bao-qin was already betrothed - not that otherwise it
wouldn’t have been a very good match. The other day, when we’d finished discussing
Ke and Xiu-yan’s betrothal, she began teasing me about it. “Last time, when I wanted
one of her girls,” she said, “I couldn’t have her; and now here she is snapping up one
of ours!” She was only joking, of course, but I could see that she was thinking about
Bao-yu still and half inviting me to make a suggestion. I rather wish now that I had.
She is so concerned about him, and he is such a peculiar boy. You can’t see him
getting on with some girl chosen for him from outside. I think much the most
satisfactory arrangement would be to betroth him to your Cousin Lin here.’
Dai-yu, who up to this moment had been listening open-mouthed, turned scarlet at
the mention of her own name and with a cry of rage threw herself again on Bao-chai.
‘I’ll kill you! You deliberately led Auntie up to this.’
‘How ridiculous!’ said Bao-chai, laughing. ‘It’s Mamma who said it, not I. What are
you hitting me for?’
Already Nightingale had darted forward:
‘If that’s what you think, Mrs Xue, why don’t you talk to Her Old Ladyship about it?’
‘Goodness, child, you are impatient!’ said Aunt Xue, laughing, ‘I suppose if you are
in such a hurry to get your mistress married, you must be thinking of a little husband
for yourself!’
‘Mrs Xue!’ said Nightingale, crimson-faced. ‘You ought to know better at your age!’
She turned and fled.
Dai-yu who, when Nightingale intervened, had angrily bidden her to mind her own
business, now gloated over her discomfiture:
‘Holy Name, it serves you right! You would poke your nose in, wouldn’t you, and
now you’ve got smut on it!’
There was a burst of laughter in which the maids and serving-women joined. They
were still laughing when Xiang- yun ran into the room, brandishing a piece of paper.
‘What sort of bill is this?’
Dai-yu examined the paper but could make nothing of it. The women below had
recognized it, however, and tittered with amusement.
‘That’s a nice thing for a young lady to be carrying! they said. ‘If you want to know
what that is, Miss, you’ll have to pay for the lesson!’
Bao-chai snatched the paper from Xiang-yun’s hand and looked. It was Xiu-yan’s
pawn ticket. She hurriedly folded it away.
‘It looks like a pawn ticket that one of the women must have dropped,’ said Aunt
Xue. ‘Whoever it is will be worried when she misses it. Where did you pick it up?’
‘What’s a pawn ticket?’ Xiang-yun asked her.
The women laughed:
‘What a simpleton! Fancy not knowing what a pawn ticket is!’
‘It’s hardly surprising,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘She’s had a very aristocratic upbringing,
don’t forget, and in any case she is still very young. How could she know about pawn
tickets? What occasion would she ever have of seeing one? In the household she
comes from even if one of the servants had such a thing, they would take very good
care that she didn’t see it. You shouldn’t call her a simpleton. I doubt very much
whether any of your own young ladies would know a pawn ticket if she saw one.’
‘That’s true,’ said the women, smiling. ‘Miss Lin here didn’t know, so you can be
quite sure the others wouldn’t. Even Bao-yu, although he goes outside quite a lot,
has probably never seen one.’
Aunt Xue now explained what a pawn ticket was. Xiang?yun and Dai-yu laughed
incredulously.
‘The things people do for money! Is that what they do in your pawnshops, Aunt?’
‘That’s a funny question!’ said the women, laughing. ‘All crows are black, you know.’
‘Where did you find this?’ Aunt Xue asked again.
But before Xiang-yun could reply, Bao-chai interrupted:
‘It’s an old ticket, Mamma; it was cancelled years ago. Caltrop has been using it to
fool them with.’
Aunt Xue believed her and did not pursue the matter.
Shortly after that a messenger arrived from the Ning-guo mansion to say that You-shi
would ‘like a word when convenient with Mrs Xue’ and Aunt Xue got up and left
them. As soon as she had gone, Bao-chai asked Xiang-yun where she had found the
ticket.
‘I saw Xiu-yan’s maid Signet handing it, very furtively, to Oriole and Oriole slip it
between the pages of a book. They thought I hadn’t noticed. I had a peep when
they’d gone, but I couldn’t make out what it was, and as I knew you were both here, I
thought I would come over and see if either of you could make anything of it.’
‘But why should Cousin Xing be pawning her clothes?’ said Dai-yu, puzzled. ‘And
why, having pawned them, should she want you, Chai, to have the ticket?’
Bao-chai saw that Xiu-yan’s circumstances could no longer be concealed and
explained to them both what had happened. Dai-yu, feeling ‘the fox’s sympathy for
the hunted hare’, was much distressed, but Xiang-yun’s reaction was one of anger.
‘I’m going straight over to see Ying-chun about this,’ she said. ‘You’ll feel better,
both of you, when I’ve given those beastly servants a piece of my mind.’
   She would have gone, too, had not Bao-chai restrained her.
   ‘Are you out of your mind? Sit down and stay where you are.’
   ‘If you were a man,’ said Dai-yu, laughing, ‘you could go around like a knight-errant
putting the world to rights; but a Jing Ke in skirts is just plain ridiculous!’
   ‘All right then,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘if you won’t let me talk to Cousin Ying about it,
let’s simply have Xiu-yan over to live with us.’
   ‘We’ll talk about that tomorrow,’ said Bao-chai. A servant put her head round the
door to make an announce?ment:
   ‘Miss Tan and Miss Xi have called.’
   Hearing of their arrival, the three in the room fell silent.
   For further details of the visit our reader is referred to the next chapter.




CHAPTER 58

In which the cock-bird who mourns his mate
Is found to be a hen
And a true heart is able to sympathize
with a strange kind of love



Our last chapter concluded with Tan-chun’s and Xi-chun’s arrival at the Naiad’s House,
which put a sudden stop to the discussion of Xiu-yan’s affairs by the other three.
Conversation was renewed after the new arrivals had inquired about Dai-yu’s health,
but of a general, unserious nature, and shortly afterwards all four visitors took their
leave and went their separate ways.
*

The Dowager Consort of the late Emperor whose illness we referred to in an earlier
chapter had now passed away and all noblewomen and wives of officials resident in
the capital had to put on the mourning appropriate to their rank and present
themselves at the Palace. A Special Edict was published prohibiting the holding of
musical or dramatic entertainments by persons of rank for a period of one year and
banning the celebration of marriages between commoners for a period of three
months. Every day Grandmother Jia together with Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi and
Jia Rong’s wife Hu-shi had to go to the Palace to take part in the ceremonies of
mourning, seldom returning until well after two o’clock in the afternoon.
   These ceremonies, which took place in one of the side halls of the Palace, were
due to last for twenty-one days, at the end of which time the body of the Consort
was to be conveyed to the late Emperor’s mausoleum in Goodson prefecture, a
distance of some ten days’ journey from the capital. On reaching there, the coffin
was to lie in state for several more days while further ceremonies were performed
preliminary to its final interment in the mausoleum. The whole expedition, from start
to finish, would take about a month. Cousin Then and You-shi were both supposed to
take part in it, which would mean that throughout that period both the Ning-guo and
Rong-guo mansions would be left masterless. A family council was held and it was
decided, in order that one person at least should be left in charge of the two
mansions, to petition for You-shi’s exemption on the grounds that she was enceinte.
At the same time Aunt Xue’s help was enlisted to keep an eye on the young people.
For this purpose it was essential that she should move into the Garden; but it was
something of a prQblem to know in which of its buildings she should stay. Bao-chai
already had Xiang-yun and Caltrop living with her; Li Wan was having to
accommodate Bao-qin, whom Grandmother Jia had placed temporarily in her care,
and though Mrs Li and her girls were still at their uncle’s place in the city, they too
were constantly dropping in on her and staying for three or four nights; Ying-chun
was sharing with Xu-yan; Tan-chun was fully occupied with household business, and
in any case the noisy bickering of Aunt Zhao and Jia Huan, who were constantly
coming round to pester her, would have made her apartment a highly unsuitable
place for Aunt Xue to live in; and Xi-chun’s place was too small. That left only the
Naiad’s House for her to move into.
Aunt Xue did so the more readily because, in discussing these arrangements with her,
Grandmother Jia had impressed upon her that Dai-yu was the young person most
particularly in need of her care. And besides, Aunt Xue had always had a very great
affection for Dai-yu. Now that they shared the same apartment she was able to give
her undivided attention to Dai-yu’s welfare - to seeing that she had good food and
enough of it, and that she took her medicines at the proper times. Never before had
Dai-yu been so well looked after. She responded with a gratitude deeper than words,
though it was by words that it was most often expressed: Aunt Xue was now her kind
‘Mamma’, and when Bao-chai and Bao-?qin were present, she addressed them and
referred to them exactly as if they were her elder and younger sisters. Grandmother
Jia, who had been worried at the prospect of being separated, even for a month,
from her orphaned granddaughter, was both relieved and happy to observe this new
development.
Aunt Xue, now that she was in the Garden, concerned herself only with the welfare
of the cousins and disciplining of their maids; in other domestic matters, however
important, she was unwilling to intervene. You-shi, too, although she visited the
Rong-guo mansion daily, did little more than hear the roll-call and was most unwilling
to exercise any real authority. As the only responsible person left in it she already had
her hands full with the affairs of the other mansion and was kept extremely busy
seeing that the temporary lodg?ings near the Palace which Grandmother Jia and the
other ladies retired to in between ceremonies were kept regularly supplied with food
and bedding and so forth.
While the senior members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo mansions were so busy, the
stewards and stewardesses of the two mansions were no less occupied, some of
them in accompanying their mistresses each day to and from the Palace, some in
attending to the provisioning and maintenance of the temporary lodgings, and some
as an advanced party who staffed the lodgings in readiness for their mistresses’
arrival.
Lacking the discipline normally imposed by these officers, the domestics of both
mansions who remained behind grew slovenly in their duties or took advantage of
the exceptional circumstances to ally themselves with those placed temporarily in
charge as a means of scoring off fellow-servants. Of the male staff at Rong-guo House
only Lai Da and one or two others remained. Nearly all Lal Da’s most trusted
lieutenants had gone. Owing to their inexperience he was finding the replacements
he had made extremely unserviceable -and so stupid: their peculations were so
transparently gross, their reports so patently unreliable, their recommendations so
obviously biased; he would have had difficulty in enu?merating all the defects he
found in them or the troubles they caused him.
At this time all the great families which kept troupes of actors or actresses in their
households were beginning to disband them. Hearing this, You-shi, after discussing
the matter with other members of the family, approached Lady Wang with the
suggestion that their own troupe of actresses should be disbanded. The method by
which she proposed to do this was economical.
‘We have, of course, bought these girls,’ she said. ‘Although they can’t keep up their
music, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t use them as maids. It’s only really the
instructors that we need to get rid of.’
‘No,’ said Lady Wang firmly. ‘We cannot treat them like servants. These are
daughters of free men, sold into their profession because their parents could not
afford to keep them. They have given us a year or two of good entertainment. Now
that this opportunity of releasing them has arisen, we ought to give them each a few
taels and let them go. That was cer?tainly what our ancestors would have done; and I
do not believe that we have become quite so degenerate or so un?generous that we
cannot, in this matter at least, follow the ancestors’ example. It’s true that we have a
few members of an earlier troupe still living with us; but there was a special reason
for their staying. They didn’t want to go, so we gave them employment and found
husbands among the staff for them when they were old enough to marry.’
‘Very well, we shall ask them,’ said You-shi. ‘If they want to go, we can send for
their parents to come and fetch them and give the money to their parents. That will
be safest. Otherwise we shall have all sorts of dubious characters turning up here to
collect them and selling them when they get them outside, and our kindness in
freeing them will be wasted. Of course, any of them who don’t want to go can stay
with us.’
Lady Wang agreed and You-shi sent someone to Xi-feng to explain what had been
decided. She also instructed the clerks in the counting-house to pay eight taels to
each of the in?structors and tell them that they were free to go where they liked. The
costumes, theatrical properties and other movables in Pear Tree Court were carefully
checked against the inventories and stored away and a caretaker was put in charge of
the buildings.
As for the little actresses, on interviewing them individually, You-shi found that hardly
any of them wanted to go. Some said that their parents were alive but did not care
for them and would only sell them again if they went back to them; others that they
had no parents and had been sold by uncles or brothers; others that they had no
relations at all that they could go to; others that they had become attached to the Jia
family and did not want to leave. In the end all but three of them elected to stay.
After what she had said, Lady Wang could scarcely refuse to have them.
The three who were leaving were taken away by their foster-mothers to stay with
them for the time being until their real parents could come to fetch them. Those who
had chosen to stay were assigned to different apartments - mostly in the Garden - as
servants. Elegante, the leader of the troupe1 was reserved for Grandmother Jia; the
'leading lady', Parfumee, went to Bao-yu; Etarnine, the soubrette, to Bao-chai; the
'principal boy', Nenuphar, to Dai-yu; Althee, the leading 'painted face', to Xiang-yun;
Cardamome, the second 'painted face', to Bao-qin; Artemisie, who specialized in old
men's parts, to Tan-chun; and You-shi asked if she might keep Aubergine, who
specialized in old women's parts, for herself.
The little actresses, though nominally in service, did nothing all day but wander
about happily in the Garden, like uncaged birds rejoicing in their new freedom.
Nobody made much effort to discourage them, as it was understood that they were
wholly unaccustomed to waiting on other people and were none of them able to sew.
It is true that one or two of them had the good sense to see that the future would be
bleak for them without a craft, now that their theatrical training had been
discontinued, and who applied themselves to learning domestic skills like sewing and
spinning; but they were the exception.
An important day in the obsequies of the late Consort arrived when it was necessary
for Grandmother Jia and the other ladies to start out for their temporary lodgings
near the Palace at four o'clock in the morning. After recruiting themselves there with
a small collation, they proceeded to the Palace to attend the ghostly breakfast of the
Deceased. When that was over, they went back to their lodgings and had lunch. Then,
after a brief rest, they returned to the Palace and remained there for both the None
and Vesper offerings. Then back to their lodgings again for dinner before finally
return?ing home.
The temporary lodgings were in the family temple of a high official in which
perpetual devotions were maintained by a sisterhood of Buddhist nuns. The nuns
occupied the two courtyards to east and west of the shrine-hall, but there were a
great many spare rooms in these courtyards, all of them kept scrupulously clean by
the nuns. The Rong-guo ladies had rented the rooms in the east courtyard and the
Prince of Bei-jing's ladies those in the west one. As they had to leave for the Palace
and return from it at the same times, the two lots of ladies had plenty of
opportunities of meeting each other, and many courtesies were exchanged between
them. But it is not with these outside matters that we are concerned.
Back, then, to the Garden. With Grandmother Jia and Lady Jia away for so much of
the day and the prospect of their being away altogether during the month it would
take them to travel to and from the mausoleum, there were a great many maids and
womenservants with nothing much to do but wander about in it enjoying themselves.
Their numbers were augmented by the women from Pear Tree Court, who were now
attached to different apartments in the Garden. Suddenly there seemed to be dozens
more people about in it than there ever had been before.
The girl-actresses were arrogant little creatures, imperious and tyrannical towards
the servants, demanding and fastidious about their food and clothing, sharp and
disputatious with their tongues - in a word, thoroughly difficult characters to deal
with. The Pear Tree Court women all hated them, but had not hitherto dared to
quarrel with them openly. To these women the closing of the drama school was a
great relief. Some of them, in their gladness to be free of it, were willing to let
bygones be bygones. Others, less magnanimous, still nursed their rancour but, the
diaspora having separated them from their former charges, dared not carry warfare
against them into another's territory.
It was the day of the Spring Cleaning festival and Jia Lian, having prepared the usual
offerings, had gone with Jia Huan, Jia Cong and Jia Lan to the Temple of the Iron
Threshold outside the city to clean the family graves. Jia Rong, accompanied by a
party of clansmen from the Ning-guo side of the family, had set out separately for the
same destination. Of the young male members of the family only Bao-yu, having not
yet wholly recovered from his illness, was unable to go. After lunch Aroma noticed
that he was showing a disposition to sleep.
‘It’s such a fine day,’ she said, ‘why don’t you take a stroll in the Garden? If you lie
down as soon as you’ve eaten, you won’t digest your food.’
Bao-yu stepped somewhat reluctantly into a pair of slippers and, supporting himself
with a walking-stick, shuffled off through the courtyard and out into the Garden.
Care of the Garden and its produce had lately been put into the hands of female
experts and, this being the busy tune of year for gardeners, they were t6 be observed
on every hand, trimming the bamboos, pruning trees and bushes, bedding plants Out,
planting bulbs and sowing seeds. Other women were moving over the surface of the
lake in punts, dredging up mud from the bottom and planting lotus-roots. On a
miniature mountain of rock overlooking the lake an appreciative audience consisting
of Xiang-yun, Caltrop, Bao-qin and some of the maids sat watching them. As Bao-yu
slowly made his way up to them, Xiang-yun cried out in mock alarm:
‘Quick, send the boats away! They’ve come to take Cousin Lin!’
Bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly.
‘People can’t help what they do when they’re ill. You shouldn’t make fun.’
‘It’s your fault for being so comical,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why do you always have to be
so different? Even your illnesses are different from everyone else’s.’
Bao-yu sat down with them for a while and watched the women working.
‘It’s a bit windy here,’ said Xiang-yun presently, ‘and the rock is rather cold to sit on.
Don’t you think you ought to go indoors?’
Bao-yu had already decided that he would like to go and see Dai-yu, so, hauling
himself up with his walking-stick, he took his leave of the girls and walked off, over
Drenched Blossoms Bridge and along the embankment on the other side.
New growth hung from the weeping willows in strings of gold and the blossom-buds
of the peach-trees had burst into a vermilion haze; but the big apricot-tree behind
the rockery, its flowering past, was already in full leaf and covered with tiny apricots,
each no bigger than a pea.
‘What a shame!’ he thought. ‘Just those few days in bed and I missed the apricot
blossom.

And in among the green leaves now
The young fruit hangs from every bough.

He stood and gazed at the tree. They were Du Mu’s lines, written on his last visit to
Hu-zhou, when he met the beautiful young dancer of a dozen years before and found
that she was now a married woman with a brood of children. How did it go?

The spring-time blossoms, white and red,
Before the thieving wind have fled;
And in among the green leaves now
The young fruit hangs from every bough.

He thought of Xing Xiu-yan’s betrothal. It would only be a year or two now before she
married, and soon she too, like the girl that Du Mu wrote about, would be a mother
with a brood of young children about her. People had to marry, of course: they had to
reproduce their kind. But what a way for a lovely young girl to end!

The spring-time blossoms, white and red...

Not so many years from now her jet-black tresses would turn to silver and her rosy
cheeks become wrinkled and colourless. The thought of it made him feel sad and an
involuntary sigh escaped from him. Then, as he continued to gaze at the tree, a little
bird flew up, and perching on one of its branches, began to sing away for all it was
worth. Bao-yu’s day-dreaming took another turn.
‘That bird must have come here when the tree was in blossom,’ he told himself.
‘What he’s singing is a lament at finding the blossoms gone. You can tell it’s a lament
by the sound. Pity Gong-ye Chang, who understood the language of birds, isn’t
around! I could have asked him what it was saying. I wonder if it will remember to
come here next year when the apricot-tree is in flower again?’
His reverie was interrupted by a sudden burst of flame beyond the rockery which
caused the bird to fly off in alarm. Bao-yu was almost as startled as the bird. The brief
crackle of flames was followed by an outburst of angry shouting.
‘Nenuphar, you little wretch, how dare you burn paper offerings here in the Garden!
I’m going straight off to report you. You’re in for a whipping, my girl.’
Wondering what on earth could be happening, Bao-yu hurried round to the other
side of the rockery to investigate. A tear-stained Nenuphar crouched on the ground,
holding the chafing-dish with which the recent blaze had been kindled, and gazing
with a sorrowful expression at the charred, still smouldering remains of a pile of gold
paper ‘spirit money’.
‘Who’s it for?’ he asked her. ‘You really shouldn’t burn it here, you know. I suppose
it must be for one of your parents -or is it for a brother, perhaps? Tell me the person’s
name and I’ll get my boys to go out and buy a proper baofu for you and write the
name on it.’
When she saw that it was Bao-yu, Nenuphar closed her lips tightly and no amount of
questioning would elicit an answer from her. Just then the woman he had heard
shouting came hurrying back, an evil expression of triumph on her face, and seized
hold of the girl.
‘Well, I’ve reported you to the young mistresses,’ she said, ‘and they’re very, very
angry.’
Nenuphar was still only a child. Terrified of the humiliation that awaited her, she now
made a childish attempt to resist going.
‘I said all along you were getting above yourselves,’ said the woman. ‘You can’t do
as you please in here like you could outside. It’s different here. We like to have a bit
of law and order.’ She pointed to Bao-yu. ‘Even Master Bao has to abide by the rules.
I don’t know what sort of a young madam you think you are to come along here and
start breaking them. Come on! It’s too late to start being afraid now. You’ll have to
come along and see them.’
‘That’s not spirit money,’ said Bao-yu hurriedly. ‘It’s waste paper she’s been burning
for Miss Lin. You should have looked more carefully before you reported her.’
To Nenuphar in her desperation Bao-yu’s appearance on the scene had been an
added terror. She could hardly believe her ears when she heard him covering up for
her. Her fear gave way to a surprised delight and she plucked up courage to defend
herself.
‘Yes, what makes you so sure it was spirit money? That was used writing-paper of
Miss Lin’s.’
But the woman was unimpressed. Stooping down, she picked out one or two of the
unconsumed fragments from the ashes.
‘Don’t argue with me! Here’s evidence! You’ll have to come with me to the jobs
room and explain yourself to them there.’
She took hold of Nenuphar by the sleeve and begun dragging her off; but Bao-yu
held her by the other sleeve and struck at the woman’s hand with his walking-stick
until she let go.
‘Take those bits of paper to them if you must,’ he said. ‘I suppose I shall have to tell
you. Last night I dreamed that the Spirit of the Apricot-tree came to me and said that
if I wanted to get better quickly, I must have an offering of spirit money made to her.
She said it had to be made by a stranger, not by anyone from my own room, and no
one else must know about it. And now, after I’ve been to the trouble of getting the
stuff and finding this girl to make the offering for me, it’s all wasted, because you saw
her doing it. This is the first day I’ve been up since my illness. If I get ill again now, it
will be your fault. Do you still want to take her? Nenuphar, go with her and see them.
Tell them exactly what I have just said. And when my grandmother gets back I shall
tell her what happened. I shall tell her that this woman interrupted you deliberately.’
Nenuphar was by now thoroughly cock-a-hoop. Now it was she who was tugging at
the woman. The woman threw the bits of paper to the ground and addressed herself
beseechingly to Bao-yu, a sickly smile on her face:
I didn’t know, really I didn’t. If you tell Her Old Ladyship that, it will be all up with
me.’
‘Don’t report back then, and I won’t tell her.’
‘But when I reported just now, they said I was to bring her,’ said the woman. ‘I’d
better tell them she’s been called away by Miss Lin.’
Bao-yu thought for a bit and then nodded. The woman went off to do as she had said.
When she had gone, Bao-yu resumed his questioning.
‘Who was it for then? I’m sure it wasn’t for anyone in your family. Is it a secret?’
Nenuphar was grateful to Bao-yu for having protected her. Knowing now that he was
a kindred spirit and to be trusted, she could hardly refuse him any longer. There were
tears in her eyes when she answered:
‘Besides myself there are only two other people in the world who know about this:
Parfumee in your room and Etamine in Miss Bao’s. After what happened today, I
think I shall have to let you be a third; but you must promise never to speak about it
to anyone else.’
She began to cry.
‘It’s no good,’ she said. ‘I can’t say it to your face. After you’ve got back, when
there’s no one else around, you can get Parfumee to tell you.’
She slipped away then, leaving him full of curiosity.
Continuing his walk to the Naiad’s House, he found Dai-yu looking thinner than ever
but feeling, she assured him, very much better than she had been a few days earlier.
She noticed how much thinner be had become, and the recollection of what had
caused them both to look so haggard provoked the shedding of a few tears. They had
not been speaking for more than a few minutes when, mindful that he was still
convales?cent, she urged him to go back and rest and he felt obliged to obey her.
When he got back, he was anxious to ask Parfumee about Nenuphar’s secret, but
Xiang-yun and Caltrop had just arrived and were engaged in lively conversation with
her and Aroma in the adjoining room. Fearing that if he called her to him the others
might ask questions, he resolved to be patient.
After a while Parfumee went off with her foster-mother to have her hair washed. Her
foster-mother had already let her own daughter wash her hair in the water. When
Parfumee noticed this, she was loud in protest.
What, give me the water your daughter’s washed in? Considering you take the whole
of my monthly allowance, I think I deserve better than left-overs!’
Angry - the more so because she was in the wrong - the woman shouted back at her.
‘Ungrateful little wretch! I’m not surprised they say players are hard folk to handle.
However good a person may be to start with, once they get into that profession,
they’re ruined. You’d never think a scrubby little creature like this could have so many
airs and graces. Nothing but the best for young madam! Sixes or aces, nothing else!
And such a spiteful, sharp little tongue if she doesn’t get what she wants! Worse than
a biting mule!’
The two of them began to go at it then, hammer and tongs. Aroma Sent someone
outside to quieten them:
‘A little less shouting, you two! Just because Her Old Ladyship isn’t here, nobody
seems able to say anything without hollering at the tops of their voices!’
‘It’s that Parfumee making trouble,’ said Skybright. ‘I don’t know what makes her
think she’s so wonderful. Just because she knows a few plays, you’d think she’d won
the war or something!’
‘It takes two to make an argument,’ said Aroma. ‘The older one shouldn’t be so
unjust and the younger one shouldn’t be so unpleasant.’
‘You can’t blame Parfumee,’ said Bao-yu. “‘Any departure from the straight or even
causes things to give voice.” A famous philosopher wrote that. She’s here without
parents or anyone to look after her. This woman takes her money and then doesn’t
treat her properly. If that’s not a departure from the straight and even, I don’t know
what is. You can hardly blame her for giving voice about it! How much does she get a
month, anyway?’ he asked Aroma. ‘Wouldn’t it save a lot of trouble if you took the
money and looked after her yourself?’
‘I don’t mind looking after her,’ said Aroma, ‘but if I do, it certainly won’t be for the
money. It wouldn’t be worth making enemies over.’
She got up as she said this and, going into the other room, took a little bottle of Oil of
Flowers, some hen’s eggs, some soap and a hair-string and told one of the old
women to convey them to Parfumee outside.
‘Tell her to stop quarrelling. Tell her she can get some more water and wash her
own hair with these.’
Unfortunately the foster-mother chose to regard this as a public humiliation for her
and grew even angrier.
‘You wicked child,’ she said to Parfumee’, ‘pretending that I keep back your money!’
She dealt her a couple of slaps, whereupon Parfumee burst out crying. Bao-yu was
about to rush outside, but Aroma restrained him.
‘What are you doing? I’ll speak to her.’
But Skybright had already darted outside and was pointing at the woman angrily:
‘You ought to know better, at your age! If we give her the things to wash her hair
with that you wouldn’t give her yourself, you ought to feel ashamed. I don’t know
how you can have the face to hit her. You wouldn’t have dared hit her if she’d been in
the school still, carrying on with her training.’
‘I hit her for trying to show me up in public,’ said the woman. ‘I’m her foster-mother.
I’ve a right to.’
‘Musk,’ said Aroma, ‘I’m no good at arguing with people and Skybright is too
excitable. You’ll have to go and deal with her.’
Musk hurried over.
‘All right, all right. There’s no need to shout. Let me just ask you this one question.
When have you ever seen anyone punishing their daughter in the master’s or
mistress’s presence - I don’t lust mean here, I mean anywhere in the whole Garden?
Even in the case of a real daughter, not just a foster-daughter, once she’s left home
and gone into service it’s for her master or mistress to punish her or the senior maids.
We can’t have parents chipping in all the time - otherwise how should we ever
manage to train a girl? I don’t know! You people, the older you get, the worse you
seem to behave! It’s not so long ago that we had Trinket’s mother in here making a
scene. I suppose she must be your model. But don’t worry. During these last few days
what with this one ill and that one ill and Her Old Ladyship busy all the time with
other matters we haven’t had a chance to report anything. But give us a few more
days. We shall find an opportunity. We’ll tell her everything. Then perhaps we shall
see some of you high?handed people taken down a peg. And another thing. There’s
Bao-yu in there only just beginning to get better - even we daren’t raise our voices
above a whisper - yet here are you hitting a girl outside his room and making her cry
like a howling wolf or a banshee. The top people only have to be away from the
house for a day or two and already you are behaving as if you were above the law. No
one is safe from you. A few more days and you’ll be hitting us, I shouldn’t wonder! If
you ask me, you’re the sort of foster-mother the girl could do without. If you think
the plant will only flourish with your tender care, you’re very much mistaken!’
Bao-yu was so angry that he banged on the threshold with his stick.
‘These old women have hearts of stone. It’s bad enough that they can’t look alter
the girls, but to go maltreating them as well ...!

Almighty earth and heaven, what’s to do?’
‘What’s to do?’ said Skybright. ‘Send the lot of them packing, useless baggages!’
The woman, shamed into silence by Musk’s tirade, made no reply.
Musk looked at Parfumee, in her crabflower-red padded tunic and patterned green
silk trousers unbound at the ankles, her glossy black hair hanging down her back,
crying as if her heart would break. It was a spectacle so different from her more
familiar stage appearances that Musk could not help laughing at its incongruousness:
‘I must say, you don’t look much like Cui Ying-ying at the moment. Reddie after her
beating, though: now that’s a part you could play without having to make up for it!’
Skybright led Parfumee away and washed her hair for her. When she had towelled it
dry, she did it up for her in a ‘lazy knot’ and told her to go back to Bao-yu’s room
when she had finished dressing.
Shortly after, a woman arrived from the kitchen to say that the food was ready,
should they send it over yet? One of the junior maids went inside to ask Aroma.
‘What does the clock say?’ Aroma asked. ‘With all that rumpus going on outside, I
didn’t hear it strike.’
‘It didn’t,’ said Skybright. ‘The wretched thing needs repairing again, I don’t know
why.’
She fetched a watch from somewhere and inspected it.
‘It’s about half a cup of tea off dinner-time,’ she said. ‘Tell them we’ll be ready
directly.’
The girl went off to relay this message.
‘Come to think of it,’ said Musk, smiling, ‘that Parfumee deserved a slap or two for
being so mischievous. She was the one who made the clock stop by playing about
with the pendulum yesterday.’
She began getting things out and laying them in readiness for the meal. Presently
junior maids carrying food-boxes came into the room and stood there while
Skybright and Musk removed the covers and inspected the contents: a bowl of soup
and the now familiar rice-gruel flanked by four different kinds of pickle.
‘But he’s better now,’ said Skybright. ‘How much longer has he got to go on eating
gruel and vegetables in brine? Why can’t they send him some proper food for a
change?’
Musk had finished laying now. Taking the large bowl of soup (ham and
bamboo-shoots) from the food-box, she put it on the table for Bao-yu to try. He bent
down over the bowl and slurped up a mouthful.
‘Ow, hot!’
Aroma laughed.
‘Holy Buddha! You’re not all that starved for meat, surely? I’m not surprised you
burn yourself if you go at it so greedily.’
She picked up the bowl and gently blew on it, then, as Parfumee happened to be
standing by, she handed it to her:
‘Here, you can do it. You may as well make yourself useful, instead of mooning
around all day doing nothing. But blow on it gently: we don’t want you spitting in it.’
Parfumee began blowing as instructed. She seemed to be managing very nicely, but
the foster-mother, who was standing outside the partition doorway whither she had
insisted on coming ‘to help’ and who, in her ignorance of the Garden’s etiquette, saw
this as an opportunity of making up to the maids, came hurrying officiously into the
room and tried to take the bowl from her.
‘She’s too inexperienced. She might drop it. Let me blow.’
Skybright shouted at her angrily:
‘Get out of here at once! Whether she breaks the bowl or not is our affair: we don’t
need you blowing on it, at all events. Who said you could come inside the partition,
any?way?’
Her anger transferred itself to the junior maids:
‘Young idiots! She probably doesn’t know about these things. You ought to have
told her.’
‘We tried to keep her out,’ the maids protested. ‘We tried to tell her, but she
wouldn’t believe us. Now do you believe us?’ they asked the woman. ‘Even the
places we’re allowed into you’re only allowed into about half of’ but you seemed to
think you could go bursting in even where we aren’t allowed to go - and you were
shouting and waving your hands at us when we tried to stop you.’
They hustled her from the outer room, into which she had retreated, onto the
verandah outside. The old women waiting in the courtyard below to take back the
food-boxes and empty bowls laughed at her when she emerged.
‘You should ‘a taken a look at yourself in the mirror before you went inside,
missus!’
The woman, angry and ashamed, had to bear their taunts in silence.
Parfumee was still blowing away at the soup. Bao-yu smiled at her:
‘Don’t destroy your lungs with all that blowing! Why don’t you try it now, to see if
it’s all right?’
Parfumee thought he must be joking and smiled timidly at Aroma and the rest.
‘Go ahead, taste it!’ said Aroma. ‘Why not?’
‘Watch me taste it,’ said Skybright, and took a sip from the bowl.
Encouraged by her example, Parfumee took a sip too.
‘It’s all right,’ she said, and handed Bao-yu the bowl.
Bao-yu drank about half the soup, ate a few pieces of bamboo-shoot, consumed half
a bowlful of the gruel, and declared himself satisfied. The servants cleared away. A
little maid came in with a wash-bowl. After he had washed his hands and rinsed his
mouth out, it was Aroma’s and the other senior maids’ turn to have their dinner.
Bao-yu signalled to Parfumee with his eyes. A sharp-witted child - one, moreover,
who had spent several years of young life in a school of drama - Parfumee responded
like an old trouper. She had a stomach-ache, she told them. She didn’t feel like any
dinner.
‘Oh well, if you’re not eating,’ said Aroma, ‘you may as well stay and keep him
company. We’ll leave the gruel here. If you get hungry, you can eat some of that.’
She and the other maids then left.
Bao-yu was now able to tell Parfumee about his encounter with Nenuphar - how he
had lied to protect her and how, feeling unable to answer his question herself, she
had referred him to Parfumee for an explanation.
‘So who was she making the offering for?’
Parfumee’s eyes reddened slightly and she sighed.
‘Oh, Nenuphar is crazy.’
‘Why?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you mean?’
‘It was for Pivoine,’ said Parfumee, ‘the girl in our troupe who died.’
‘There’s nothing crazy about that,’ said Bao-yu, ‘if they were friends.’
‘Friends!’ said Partumee. ‘They were more than that. It was Nenuphar’s soppy
ideas that started it all. You see, Nenuphar is our Principal Boy and Pivoine always
played opposite her as Principal Girl. They became so accustomed to acting the part
of lovers on the stage, that gradually it came to seem real to them and Nenuphar
began carrying on as if they were really lovers. When Pivoine died, Nenuphar cried
herself into fits, and even now she still thinks about her. That’s why she makes
offerings to her on feast-days. When Etamine took over the roles that Pivoine used to
play, Nenuphar became just the same towards her. We even teased her about it:
“Have you forgotten your old love then, now that you’ve got yourself a new one?”
But she said, “No, I haven’t forgotten. It’s like when a man loses his wife and
remarries. He can still be faithful to the first wife, as long as he keeps her memory
green.” Did you ever hear anything so soppy in your life?’
‘Soppy’ or whatever it was, there was a strain in Bao-yu’s own nature which
responded to it with a powerful mixture of emotions: pleasure, sorrow, and an
unbounded admiration for the little actress. He took Parfumee’s hands in his own
and told her with great earnestness what she must say to Nenuphar.
‘Tell her never, never to use that paper stuff again. “Spirit money” is a superstitious
invention of modern times: you’ll find nothing about it in the teachings of Confucius.
All she needs to do when feast-days come round is to light a little incense in a burner.
Provided that it’s done with reverence, that’s all that’s needed for conveying one’s
feelings to the dead. It’s the sincerity with which we make the offering, not the
offering itself that counts. You see that burner on the table over there? Whenever I
want to remember someone dear to me - it doesn’t necessarily have to be on a
feast-day or any particular day, by the way - I light some incense in it and put out a
cup of fresh tea or water, or sometimes some flowers or fruit if I have any. You can
even use “unclean foods”- as long as they’re devoutly offered: that’s the important
thing. Tell her not to go burning that paper stuff any more.’
Parfumee promised. After that she finished off the gruel. Then someone came in to
say that Grandmother Jia had got back.
Of that you shall hear more in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 59

By Willow Walk the conservers of property
resort to violence and abuse
And at Green Delights the defenders of law and order
invoke a higher authority



Hearing that his grandmother and the other ladies were back, Bao-yu put on an extra
garment and shuffled off, walking-stick in hand, to greet them. He found them tired
out by the taxing routine of the past few days and anxious to retire to bed as soon as
possible. Nothing of interest happened during that night. The ladies were up again at
four o’clock next morning and off once more to the Palace.
The date of their departure for the mausoleum was fast approaching. Faithful, Amber,
Parrot and Pearl busied themselves getting together the things that Grandmother Jia
would need on the journey, while Silver, Suncloud and Sunset did the same for Lady
Wang. When all was ready, they went over everything, item by item, with the most
senior of the servants who were accompanying their mistresses. There were
altogether sixteen of these: six maids and ten older women. The male servants, who
are not included in that number, were meanwhile preparing the mule-litters that
their mistresses would ride in and getting the harness and other gear into good order.
Faithful and Silver were not among the sixteen. They were to stay behind and look
after their mistresses’ apartments while they were away.
Some days before the funeral cortege was due to set out, the maids packed up the
covers and hangings of their mistresses’ travelling-beds. These were collected by a
party of four or five women, who, with the aid of some men?servants, took them by
cart through the back streets to the lodgings where their mistresses were to spend
the night be?fore their departure and put them up ready for them to sleep in.
The Jia ladies and their retinue left the mansion the day before the cortege was due
to start. Grandmother Jia and Jia Rong’s wife shared the first litter; Lady Wang
followed on her own in the second; Cousin Zhen and the menservants provided them
with a mounted escort. Then followed several large covered carts in which the maids
and womenservants were travelling. The carts also carried a large number of bundles
containing changes of clothing for the ladies. The other members of the family, led by
Aunt Xue and You-shi, accompanied the little procession as far as the outer threshold
of the main gate to see the old lady off.
While the column was reforming itself in the street, Jia Lian appeared on horseback
at the head of a small party of mounted grooms. He shepherded his parent’s litters
into place between those of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, then, fearful of the
possible consequences of leaving the baggage train with its female freight unguarded,
trotted back to a position behind the carts and, with his mounted followers, brought
up the rear.
Inside the mansion Lai Da greatly increased the numbers of the watch and ordered
the entrances to the two main courtyards to be kept permanently closed. Anyone
wanting to go in or out of the mansion now had to do so through the small side gate
on the west corner. The ornamental gate dividing the outer from the inner part of the
mansion was closed at sundown. So, too, were the main and side gates of the Garden.
The gate which the cousins normally used for getting into or out of the rear part of
Lady Wang’s quarters and the gate on the east side which gave access to the corner
gate of Aunt Xue’s courtyard were left open. Since they affected only the
intercommunication of the already sealed-off inner parts of the mansion, it did not
seem necessary to close them. Faithful and Silver shut up the living-rooms normally
occupied by their mistresses and went to sleep with the other maids in the servants’
quarters at the back. Each day at sundown Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife conducted a party of
ten or so senior women into the Garden to police it during the night. The number of
pages employed in the gallery outside for the purpose of sounding the night-watches
was increased. Everything was done, in short, to ensure that the security of the
mansion was maintained.
*

Waking one fine, fresh morning from vernal slumbers, Bao- chai, on raising the
bed-curtain and stepping down into the room, became sensible of a very slight
chilliness in the air, the reason for which was apparent when she opened the door
and looked out. A little shower, falling in the last watch before dawn, had refreshed
the earth and turned the mosses everywhere a more brilliant shade of green. She
went in again and called to the others to get up.
While they were washing, Xiang-yun complained of an irritation in her cheeks which
she feared might herald an outbreak of the mild eczema she sometimes suffered
from and asked Bao-chai for some rose-root orris to put on them.
‘I gave the last of it to Qin a few days ago,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Frowner has a lot. I had
been meaning to ask her for some, but as I haven’t had any trouble with my own
cheeks this year, I forgot about it.’
She ordered Oriole to go and get some. As Oriole was about to leave, Etamine said
that she would like to go with her because she wanted to talk to Nenuphar. The two
girls set off from All-spice Court, chattering and laughing as they went.
At Willow Walk they followed the line of the embankment. The trailing golden strings
of the weeping willows were already flecked with emerald.
‘Do you know how to weave things with these?’ Oriole smilingly asked her
companion.
‘What sort of things?’ said Etamine.
‘Oh, things to look at, things to use - all sorts. Just wait while I break off a few and
I’ll weave a little basket out of them. I’ll leave the leaves on, then, if we fill it with
different kinds of flowers, it will look ever so pretty.’
Temporarily forgetting about the orris-powder, she reached up and broke off some of
the tender willow-twigs. She got Etamine to hold them for her; then, as they walked
along together, she plaited them into a little basket. From time to time she stopped
to pick a flower or two that grew beside the way. The finished basket was a pretty
little open-work one with a handle, bursting all over with the greenery which she had
been careful not to pull off. When it was filled up and stuck all over with flowers, it
looked really charming. Etamine was enraptured:
  ‘Oh, Oriole, do let me have it!’
  ‘We’ll give this one to Miss Lin,’ said Oriole. ‘We can pick some more twigs on the
way back and I’ll make baskets like this for you all.’
By this time the two girls had arrived at the Naiad’s House. Dai-yu had not yet
completed her toilet. She was very much taken with Oriole’s handiwork.
‘Ah, a living basket! Who made it?’
‘I did,’ said Oriole. ‘It’s for you, miss.’
‘Oh, but it’s charming!’ said Dai-yu, taking it. ‘No wonder they’re always saying how
clever you are with your hands.’
After admiring it a little longer, she told Nightingale to hang it up where she could see
it
Oriole first inquired politely after Aunt Xue and then asked Dai-yu about the
rose-orris. Dai-yu told Nightingale to wrap some up for her.
‘I’m better now,’ she told Oriole as she handed her the packet. ‘I feel like going out
today for some exercise. Tell Chai that there’s no need for her to pay her call on
Mamma today or to visit me. As soon as I’ve done my hair, Mamma and I will be
coming over to her place. We can have our lunch there. We shall be quite a little
family party!’
Oriole promised to relay the message and went into Nightingale’s room to collect
Etamine; but Etamine and Nenuphar had just reached the most interesting part of
their conver?sation and were most unwilling to be separated. Oriole pro?posed a
solution to Nightingale.
‘Your mistress is going over to our place presently. Why not let Nenuphar come
with us now and wait for her there?’
‘By all means,’ said Nightingale. ‘She gets up to so much mischief, we shall be glad
to have her off our hands for a bit!’
She got out Dai-yu’s spoon and chopsticks, wrapped them up in a napkin of West
Ocean linen, and held them out for Nenuphar.
‘Here you are: you can take these for her. May as well make yourself useful.’
Nenuphar took the things from her and set off, smiling happily, with the other two.
They made their way to Willow Walk again and Oriole broke off a lot more twigs and,
sit?ting down on a nearby rock, began straightway plaiting them to make into
another basket. She told Etamine to go ahead with the rose-orris and come back for
her presently when she had delivered it; but both girls were fascinated by Oriole’s
skilful weaving and could not tear themselves away. Oriole threatened to suspend
work on the basket if Etamine did not do as she was told.
‘Come on,’ said Nenuphar. ‘I’ll go with you. We can hurry back in no time.’
After they had gone, while Oriole sat plaiting on her own, Mamma He’s daughter
Swallow walked up and smilingly asked her what she was making. Oriole was still
talking to her when the other two got back. Swallow looked at Nenu?phar curiously.
‘Tell me, what was that paper you were burning the other day when my Aunt Xia
caught you? She was going to report you, but Bao-yu made out that it was she who
was in the wrong, so she couldn’t go through with it. She was ever so angry. She
came and told my mother all about it. What on earth did you do during all that time
you were living out?side together to make such an enemy of her?’
Nenuphar sniffed.
‘I didn’t do anything. It’s because she’s so greedy. She can’t squeeze as much out of
me as she used to be able to. To mention nothing else, look at all the food she and
the others used to take home with them when they were working with us outside.
You know they did.’
Swallow laughed.
‘She’s my own aunt. I can’t very well criticize her in front of other people. I must
admit, though, it does seem to be as Bao-yu once said. “A girl before she marries is
like a price?less pearl, but once she marries the pearl loses its lustre and develops all
sorts of disagreeable flaws, and by the time she’s an old woman, she’s no longer like
a pearl at all, more like a boiled fish’s eye.” He said, “How can the same person, at
different times in her life, seem like three completely different people?” - Of course, I
knew at the time he was only talking his usual nonsense; but really there does seem
to be some truth in it. I don’t know about other people’s families, but it’s certainly
true of my mother and my aunt. The older they get, the more they seem to care
about nothing else but money. When we were all living together at home, they used
to com?plain that there weren’t any job for us that would bring in a bit of income.
Then this Garden was built and I was lucky enough to be among those who were
chosen to work in it -doubly lucky, in fact, because I was assigned to Green Delights.
That meant that quite apart from the fact that they didn’t have to find my keep any
more, they were getting an additional four or five hundred cash each month that I
managed to save out of my wages. You’d have thought they’d have been satisfied
with that, but oh no! Then they got jobs themselves, looking after these player-girls
in Pear Tree Court. My Aunt Xia had Nenuphar for foster-daughter and my mother
had Parfumee. So for this last year or two they’ve been really comfortably off. Now
that you’ve all moved inside, of course, it’s rather out of their hands; but they won’t
give up. It really makes you laugh. First my aunt having that row with Nenuphar, and
then my mother having that row with Parfumee. That was over the shampoo.
Parfumee had asked my mother I don’t know how many times to shampoo her hair
for her. Then Parfumee’s monthly allowance came in and my mother had no excuse
for putting her off any longer, so she bought the shampoo, but when she’d bought it,
she told me to wash my hair with it first. Well, I didn’t like to do that. I mean, I’ve got
money of my own, and even if I hadn’t, I could always get the stuff for washing my
hair with from Aroma or Skybright or Musk without any trouble by simply asking for
it. So I said no, I wouldn’t. So then she got hold of my younger sister and washed her
hair first. Needless to say, when she called Parfumee after that there was a quarrel.
Oh, and then she wanted to go and blow on Bao-yu’s soup. Oh dear, I could have died!
I told her about the rule as soon as I saw her going in, but she wouldn’t believe me.
Oh no, Mother knows best! So of course she made a fool of herself. It’s a good job
there are so many of us working in the Garden and no one can ever remember who
is related to who, otherwise they might get the impression that the people in my
family do nothing but quarrel all the time.’
‘Incidentally, this place where you’ve chosen to do your basket-making is on the
territory of another of my aunts - my father’s sister. Ever since she was put in charge
of it, she’s treated it as if it were her own property. She slaves away on it from
morning to night. What’s more, she makes me come and watch over it for her: she’s
so terrified of any of it getting spoiled. It’s got so that I can hardly do my own job
properly. And now that Mother’s moved into the Garden, she keeps an eye on it too.
The pair of them watch over it like hawks. No one else is allowed to touch a blade of
grass here. I don’t mind telling you, if they come along this way and find you’ve been
picking their flowers and breaking their young willow-twigs, they won’t be at all
pleased!’
‘In anyone else’s case, perhaps not,’ said Oriole; ‘but my case is different. When the
Garden was divided up, it was agreed that daily supplies of stuff from it were to be
sent to all the apartments. That included, apart from things to eat, flowers for
everyone’s hair and flowers to put in the vases. Now my mistress, it so happens, was
the only one who said she didn’t want a daily supply of flowers. She said she would
let them know whenever she wanted any, but up to now she never has. So you see,
in my case they are hardly likely to object even if they do find out that I’ve been
picking some.’
These words were scarcely out of her mouth when who should appear, hobbling
along on her stick, but this same aunt that Swallow had been talking about. Oriole
and Swallow invited her to come and sit down on the rock. The old woman felt a
pang of displeasure as her eye travelled from the little heap of broken willow-twigs to
the freshly-picked flowers that Nenuphar and Etamine were holding, but since it was
Oriole who appeared to be responsible, she forbore to complain of the vandalism
and found something to grumble at her own niece about instead.
‘When I tell you to come here and keep an eye on things, you prefer to stay at
home and play. Then when the others ask you to do something for them, you
pretend that you can’t because you’re already working for me. You use me like a
magic charm, so that you can do a disappearing act when?ever there’s a job of work
to be done!’
‘First you tell me to come here, then you’re afraid the others will want me so you
tell me off for being here,’ Swallow protested. ‘I can’t be in two places at once, aunt!’
‘Don’t you believe her, missus!’ said Oriole teasingly. ‘She’s the one who picked all
these things and pestered me to weave them for her. I tried to get rid of her, but she
wouldn’t leave me alone.’
‘For goodness sake!’ said Swallow agitatedly. ‘Don’t make jokes like that. She’ll take
you seriously.’
Alas, it was all too true! This aunt of Swallow’s was a stupid old woman whose senile
infatuation with money was such that beside it all human ties had long since ceased
to count. At Oriole’s words the pent-up anguish with which she viewed this hateful
spoliation of her domain found relief in action: she raised her stick and, with the
presumptuous tyranny of old age, struck Swallow several times with it across the
back.
‘Little baggage!’ she said. ‘How dare you answer me back! Your own mother hates
you so much she’s itching to get her teeth in you. Don’t you go raising your voice at
me!’
‘Oriole was only joking,’ said Swallow, weeping - partly from the pain and partly
from the humiliation of being beaten in front of the others. ‘Why should my mother
hate me? I haven’t burnt the washing-up water! What am I supposed to have done?’
Dismayed that her words should have had such an effect, Oriole stepped hurriedly
between them and seized the aunt’s upraised arm.
‘I was only joking, missus. Is it to shame me that you are beating her?’
‘I’ll thank you not to meddle in what doesn’t concern you, miss,’ said the old
woman. ‘Do you think I should not be allowed to discipline my own niece just
because you are here?’
The crassness of this reply caused Oriole to flush with anger.
‘You can discipline her any time you like, but I don’t see why you should choose to
do it when I make a joke,’ she said scornfully. ‘All right, go ahead and discipline her,
then.’
And releasing the old woman’s arm, she sat down on the rock again and got on with
her weaving.
The next thing that happened was that Swallow’s mother appeared on the scene,
looking for her daughter.
‘What are you doing there?’ she shouted as she caught sight of her. ‘I thought I told
you to go and fetch some water.’
‘Come over and see what she’s been doing,’ the old aunt shouted back at her. ‘I’ve
no hold over her any more than you now, it seems. She’s being very impertinent to
me.’
‘Oh, what’s she been doing this time, sister-in-law?’ said the woman, coming up to
them. ‘She’s got no use for her own mother any more, I knew that; but I thought she
might have a bit of respect left for you still.’
Recognizing the newcomer as Swallow’s mother, Oriole wanted to explain; but the
aunt did not give her a chance.
‘Look at that!’ she said, pointing to the willow-twigs on the rock. ‘A great girl like
her - you’d think she’d know better! And not content with that, leading other people
on to ruin me as well!’
Swallow’s mother was still smarting from her unsuccessful quarrel with Parfumee
and was angry with Swallow for not having taken her side.
‘Little strumpet!’ she shouted, bearing down on her wrathfully and slapping her
across the head. ‘How long now have you been working with those young madams? -
it hasn’t taken you very long to pick up their airs and graces! But don’t you go
thinking I can’t lay my hands on you any more. A foster-daughter’s one thing, but you
are my own flesh and blood. I can still look after you when I feel like it. Little painted
whores, telling me I can’t go inside where you can go! I wish you’d go inside and stay
there: perhaps if you stayed inside long enough, you might find a customer!’ She
grabbed hold of the little half-made willow basket and waved it in Swallow’s face.
‘And what’s this supposed to be? What’s the bloody meaning of this?’
‘I made that,’ said Oriole. ‘Don’t curse the mulberry tree when you mean the locust.
If it’s me you’re angry with, why not say so and leave her out of it?’
Swallow’s mother was intensely jealous of these senior maids like Oriole and Aroma
and Skybright, for she knew that their status and authority were greatly superior to
her own. She feared them and deferred to them, but doing so cost her a good deal of
angry resentment which she vented on the junior maids. On this occasion her anger
was further exacerbated by the presence of her sister’s enemy, Nenuphar.
Swallow was now making her way tearfully towards Green Delights. Her mother was
afraid that if they asked her there why she was crying and she told them, there would
be further insults to put up with from Skybright, so she hurried after her to try and
stop her.
‘You come back I’ she shouted. ‘You’ll go when I say you can.’
But Swallow refused to stop, and her mother, greatly incensed, rushed forward,
intending to lay hands on her. Swallow happened to turn and see her coming,
however, and got away by running even faster. Her mother, continuing the pursuit,
slipped on the moss and fell over, to the great delight of Oriole and the other two.
Oriole was by now so disgusted with the whole affair that she threw everything -
basket, twigs and flowers - into the water and went off home, leaving the old aunt
blessing her?self in pious horror at the waste.
‘Wicked creature!’ she called out after her. ‘You ought to be struck by lightning,
throwing away good flowers like that!’
She set about picking some herself then, to deliver to the various apartments.
As for Swallow, she went on running until she came to Green Delights. There, just
inside the courtyard, she ran full tilt into Aroma, who was just at that moment setting
out to pay a call on Dai-yu. Swallow clung to her imploringly.
‘Save me, miss! My mother’s going to beat me again.’
At the sight of the mother, arriving now in hot pursuit, Aroma could no longer
contain her annoyance.
‘That’s twice in three days: first your foster-daughter and now your own daughter.
Is it to show off the size of your family that you do this, or do you really not know any
better?’
Being a relative newcomer to the Garden, Swallow’s mother had as yet formed no
very clear impression of Aroma beyond that she spoke very little and was probably a
fairly harmless sort of person.
‘I should mind your own business, if I was you, miss,’ she said rudely. ‘You know
nothing about these matters. It’s because you’re all so soft with the girl that she’s got
so out of hand.’
She darted after Swallow again, her hand upraised to strike her. Aroma was so angry
that she turned round and began marching back to the house. On her way she
passed Musk, who was hanging some handkerchiefs out to dry under the crab-apple
tree. Musk looked over her shoulder to see what all the shouting was about.
‘I should leave them to it, if I were you,’ she advised Aroma. ‘Just let them get on
with it and see what happens.’
She signalled to Swallow with her eyes as she said this. Swallow’ understood her
immediately and dashed inside the house to take refuge with Bao-yu. The other
servants smiled at each other in pleasurable anticipation.
‘Now there’ll be trouble,’ they said. ‘Now we shall really see something!’
‘Why don’t you calm down a bit?’ Musk said to the woman. ‘Surely you’re not
going to set yourself up against the whole apartment?’
The woman saw her daughter go up to Bao-yu inside the house and Bao-yu take her
by the hand.
‘Don’t worry,’ Bao-yu said to the girl. ‘I’ll look after you.’ Swallow, still crying, told
him the whole story of Oriole and the willow-wigs. Bao-yu was deeply shocked, but,
for form’s sake, pretended to blame Swallow for what had hap?pened.
‘It’s bad enough having rows in here; what do you want to go upsetting your aunt
outside for?’
‘What this good woman said just now is right,’ Musk said to the other servants.
Perhaps we are too slack. Perhaps we don’t know enough about these matters to
deal with them properly ourselves. What we need is someone whose opinion she will
listen to, someone who really knows what’s what.’
She turned to a little maid standing near by.
‘Go and fetch Patience. If Patience can’t come, fetch Mrs Lin.’
As the little maid ran off on her errand, the other women in the compound drew
round Swallow’s mother with inter?ested smiles.
‘Better ask them to call that child back,’ they advised her. ‘You don’t want Miss
Patience coming here.’
‘If she’s “Miss Patience”, she’ll just have to be patient and listen to reason,’ said the
woman defiantly. ‘I never yet heard of a mother being disciplined for trying to
discipline her own daughter.’
The others smiled at her ignorance.
‘You don’t know who Miss Patience is, though. Miss Patience is Mrs Lian’s Number
One. If she’s in a good mood, you might get away with a telling-off; but if she’s not
my goodness, you’re in for a packet of trouble!’
Just then the little maid came back with a message.
‘Miss Patience was busy, but she asked me why I’d come and when I told her she
said, “Tell her she’s dismissed and get Mrs Lin on the corner gate to give her forty
strokes of the bamboo.”‘
It was now the mother’s turn for tears and entreaties.
‘It wasn’t easy for me to get this job,’ she said. ‘I shan’t get another like it. And I’m a
widow, too: I’ve no one else at home. From your point of view that’s an advantage,
because I can give all my attention to serving you. But it means that it’s my only
livelihood: if you turn me out, I don’t know how I’m going to keep alive.’
Aroma began to relent.
‘But if you want to stay here,’ she said, ‘you really must learn to behave yourself
and do what you are told. You really can’t go around hitting people all the time. What
are we to do with a person like you? This daily shouting and quarrelling is giving our
place a bad name.’
‘Take no notice of her,’ said Skybright. ‘Send her packing. Who’s got time to stand
around arguing with people like her?’
Swallow’s mother appealed to the other maids:
‘I admit I was in the wrong; but if you tell me what to do, I’m willing to learn. Give
me another chance, young ladies, you won’t regret it. It’s a “work of merit”, don’t
forget, to help another person mend their ways.’
She appealed to Swallow:
‘It was on account of beating you that I got into this tr6uble. And I didn’t beat you
very hard. Put in a word for me, there’s a good child!’
Bao-yu himself now felt sorry for the woman and told her that she could stay.
‘But no more trouble, mind! Any more trouble from you, and you’ll be out like a
shot - and you’ll be given the beating!’
The woman thanked first Bao-yu and then all the others in turn. She had already left
when Patience looked in to see what the trouble was.
‘Forget about it!’ said Aroma. ‘It’s all over.’
‘Well, they say “where mercy is possible, mercy should be shown”,’ Patience
observed. ‘If you can see your way to letting her off, it certainly saves us some
trouble. I can’t understand it, though. It’s only a few days since Their Ladyships left,
yet already the whole place seems to be in a state of mutiny. Before I’ve finished
dealing with trouble in one place, it crops up in another. I scarcely know which way to
turn.’
‘I thought we were the only ones,’ said Aroma. ‘I didn’t realize there were others.’
‘Oh, this is nothing!’ said Patience. ‘There have been seven or eight outbreaks just
during these last three or four days. Compared with the others, this trouble of yours
is a very minor affair. We’ve had something much more upsetting - and more
ridiculous - than this to contend with.’
Aroma was curious to know what it was. But as to whether Patience told her or not,
that will be revealed in the chapter which follows.

CHAPTER 60

As a substitute for rose-orris
Jia Huan is given jasmine face-powder
And in return for rose essence
Cook Liu is given lycoperdon snow



Aroma, you will recall, had asked Patience what in particular it was that had been
giving her so much trouble. Patience smiled mysteriously:
Something no one would ever guess. You’ll have a good laugh when I tell you. I won’t
tell you for a few days yet, though, because I still haven’t quite got to the bottom of it
-and I haven’t got time now, in any case.’
As if to prove that this was so, one of Li Wan’s little maids arrived at that very
moment:
‘Miss Patience? Oh, there you are! Mrs Zhu’s waiting for you. Why don’t you
come?’
‘I’m coming, I’m coming,’ said Patience, breaking away from the others with a laugh
and hurrying after her.
Aroma and the others laughed, too.
‘She’s grown as popular as hot cakes since her mistress’s illness: everyone wants
her at once!’
Patience’s business with Li Wan is no part of our story. We remain with Bao-yu and
the test at Green Delights.
‘Swallow,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you and your mother had better go to Miss Bao’s place and
make it up with Oriole. You can’t let her go on feeling offended.’
‘Yes,’ said Swallow, and hurried out to find her mother. Bao-yu shouted to them
through the window as the two of them were crossing the courtyard:
‘Don’t say anything about it in front of Miss Bao. You don’t want Oriole to get a
telling-off.’
Mother and daughter shouted back a reply and continued on their way, conversing as
they went. Swallow began reproaching her mother when they were out of earshot:
‘I told you, Mother, again and again, but you wouldn’t believe me. All this trouble
you’ve got yourself into - it was so unnecessary.’
‘Get along with you, little hussy!’ said her mother, laughing. ‘You know what the
proverb says: “Never suffer, never learn”. I’ve learned my lesson. I don’t need any
lectures from you!’
‘If only you could be content with the job you’ve got, Ma, and not be always
pushing forward so,’ said Swallow gently. ‘There are all sorts of benefits to be had
from working here, after you’ve been here some length of time. I’ll tell you just one
of them. Bao-yu says that when the time comes, he’s going to ask Her Ladyship to
give us maids - all of us, that is, not just the ones who work in his room - our freedom,
so that you can marry us to whoever you like. What about that for a start?’
‘Really?’ Her mother’s delight was tempered with incredulity.
‘Why should I tell a lie?’
The pious invocations which this news evoked continued until they were almost at
All-spice Court. They arrived there when Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Aunt Xue and the others
were having lunch. Swallow and her mother waited until Oriole came out to make
the tea, then, as she emerged, Swallow’s mother stepped forward to make her
apology.
‘I’m afraid I was a bit hasty just now, miss. I said sonic things I shouldn’t have done.
I hope you won’t hold it against me. Anyway, I’m very sorry.’
Oriole, all smiles, begged them both to be seated and would have given them tea;
but mother and daughter said they had business to attend to and took their leave.
They were already on their way back to Green Delights when Etamine came hurrying
after them.


‘Just a minute, just a minute!’
She was holding a little packet which she wanted them to deliver to Parfumee for her.
It was rose-orris, she explained, for the face.
‘That’s a bit unnecessary, isn’t it?’ said Swallow. ‘They must have plenty of it there
they’d be only too willing to give her if she wanted any. Why go to the trouble of
sending her some?’
‘What they do with theirs is their concern,’ said Etamine. ‘This is mine and I want to
give it to her as a present. Please take it with you.’
Swallow could scarcely refuse.
When she and her mother got back to Green Delights, Jia Huan and Jia Cong were
with Bao-yu inside, having arrived on a formal visit a few moments previously to
inquire about his health. Swallow turned to her mother.
‘Now, Mother: I’ll go in alone. There’s no need for you to come in with me.’
Her mother received this without a murmur. All her former wilfulness was quite
forgotten and she stood docilely outside while Swallow entered.
Bao-yu, seeing her come in, realized that it was Only to report the successful
conclusion of her mission and nodded to her curtly to show that he had understood.
There was therefore no need for her to say anything, and after standing silently for a
few moments inside the doorway, she slipped out again, signalling with her eyes to
Parfumee as she did so to follow her into the Outer room. There she handed the
packet to her and told her in an undertone what Etamine had asked her to say.
Bao-yu, having nothing whatever to talk to his visitors about, had been idly following
this transaction out of the corner of his eye, and when Parfumee came in again, he
asked her what it was that she was holding. Parfumee told him and handed him the
packet. He praised Etamine’s thoughtfulness while opening it up to have a look.
Jia Huan craned forward and smelt the powder’s cool, delicious scent. Stooping down,
he fished a sheet of paper from inside his boot.
‘Give us a bit, brother!’ he said, holding the paper out for Bao-yu to pour some in.
Bao-yu would have given him some, but Parfumee was unwilling that Etamine’s gift
to her should be shared.
‘No, don’t take any of that,’ she said. ‘I’ll get some more for you from outside.’
Bao-yu, divining the reason for her reluctance, quickly did the packet up again.
‘Here you are. Hurry up and get some more then.’
Parfumee took the packet, and having stored it safely away in the room where she
kept her things, looked in the drawer of her vanity-case for her own supply, only to
find that the box she had kept it in was empty - why she could not imagine, because
she was sure there had been some left in it that morning: But when she asked the
others, of course, no one knew anything about it.
‘There’s no time to bother about that now,’ said Musk. ‘Obviously it must have
been someone from this room. They must have found themselves short and
“borrowed” yours. Give him something else. It doesn’t matter what: he’ll never know
the difference. Anything to get rid of them, so that we can get on with our lunch!’
Following this advice, Parfumee made up a little packet of jasmine-scented
face-powder and took it inside to the boys. Jia Huan, grinning broadly, stretched out
his hand to receive it, but she threw it contemptuously on the kang and he had to
stoop down to pick it up. When he had stowed it inside the breast of his jacket, he
and Jia Cong finally took their leave.
With Jia Zheng permanently away and Lady Wang and the other ladles now also
absent, Jia Huan had lately taken to staying away from school for several days at a
time on the pretext that he was ill; he therefore felt no compunction in entering his
mother’s courtyard during the daytime. He did so now, very pleased with himself, to
look for Sunset, whom he found chatting with Aunt Zhao.
‘Look, I’ve brought you something nice,’ he said, going up to her, all smiles, and
holding out the packet: ‘something for your face. You know you’re always saying how
good rose?-orris is for skin troubles - how much better than the silver powder you
get from outside - well, have a look at this!’
Sunset opened the packet, took one look at its contents, and let out a hoot of
laughter.
‘Who did you get this from?’
Jia Huan told her.
‘They’ve been having you on,’ said Sunset. ‘This stuff isn’t rose-orris, it’s jasmine
face-powder.’
Jia Huan looked again. It did in fact have a slightly pinkish tinge, and when he sniffed
it, he found that it had a sweet, almost sickly perfume, quite unlike the clean, fresh
scent of the orris.
‘Well, anyway, it’s good stuff,’ he said. ‘Orris or this stuff; it’s all powder, isn’t it? You
can keep it to use on your face. This is still better than anything you could buy from
outside.’
Sunset put it away resignedly.
Aunt Zhao eyed her offspring scornfully.
‘You don’t think if they’d got anything really good they’d give it to you, do you? I’m
not surprised she made a fool of you; I’m surprised you bothered to ask her for it.
Take it back and throw it in her face, that’s what you ought to do. Now that the
others are all either chasing around the countryside after this funeral or lying with
their toes curled up in bed is just the moment for a good old row. Stir them all up a
bit. Pay them back for some of the things they’ve done to us in the past. No one’s
going to be bothered to dig a little thing like this up in two months’ time when
they’re all back again. And even if they do, you’ve got a good excuse. Bao-yu’s your
elder brother; you can’t do anything to offend him, I agree. But that doesn’t mean
that you have to put up with what every little cat or dog of his chooses to do to you.’
Jia Huan hung his head.
‘It’s not worth a quarrel,’ said Sunset, defending him. ‘Much better just grin and
bear it, whatever we think.’
‘Just stay out of this, will you?’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘It’s got nothing to do with you. He
knows he’s in the right. It’s a golden opportunity to go and tell these little hussies
exactly what he thinks of them.’ She pointed at Jia Huan scornfully. ‘Pah! Spineless
creature I If ever I say a word out of place or give you the wrong thing by mistake, I
get black looks from you soon enough! Oh yes, you can be very fierce with your own
mother! But when some little chit of a girl makes a fool of you, you take it lying down.
How can you expect the servants to respect you when you grow up if you always
behave like this? Oh, you’re so useless, you make me sick!’
Shamed and angered by her words, yet still not daring to act upon them) Jia Huan
made a dismissive gesture with his hand.
‘It’s all very well to talk, but you wouldn’t dare to go there any more than I would.
You want me to go back there and have a row with them, don’t you? All right,
suppose I do and they tell the school. I’m the one who’ll feel the pain when I get
beaten, not you. You’re always stirring me up to do things; then, when I get beaten
and sworn at, you just keep your head down and say nothing. This time you’re trying
to stir me up to have a row with these girls. Well, if you’re not afraid of Tan-chun,
why don’t you do it yourself? Then perhaps in future I might take a bit more notice of
what you said.’
His words touched Aunt Zhao on the raw.
‘What?’ she screamed. ‘Me afraid of my own flesh and blood, of my own daughter
that I once carried inside me? That’s a good story!’
She snatched up the packet of orris-powder from where Sunset had placed it and
went rushing off in the direction of the Garden. Sunset, having found expostulation in
vain, slipped off to another apartment to shelter from the storm. Jia Huan slunk off
through the ornamental gate to play on his own outside.
As Aunt Zhao, still in a highly combustible state, went charging into the Garden, who
should she run into but old Mamma Xia, that aunt of Swallow’s who was also the
foster-mother and implacable enemy of Nenuphar. From Aunt Zhao’s livid face and
bloodshot eyes it was evident to the old nannie that she was in a very nasty temper.
Mamma Xia politely inquired where she was going.
‘Now even the little painted actresses who haven’t been with us more than a few
days are discriminating against us. I could take it from anyone else, but to have little
creatures like that putting you in your place - it’s more than flesh and blood can
bear!’
As these sentiments, insofar as she could make sense of them, seemed very much in
accord with her own, Mamma Xia asked her, with some interest, precisely what it
was that had upset her. Aunt Zhao explained how Jia Huan had asked for rose-orris
and been fobbed off with ordinary face-powder.
‘My dear Mrs Zhao,’ said Mamma Xia, ‘have you only now begun to realize what
they are like? Why, what you have just told me is nothing I The other day they were
even burning ghost money in here - and Bao-yu sticking up for them, if you please I If
anyone else brings anything into the Garden, it’s all “unclean, unclean I” - there’s no
end of a fuss. But ghost money, than which there’s nothing more unclean that I know
of, that’s all right, apparently. You’re the most senior person after Her Ladyship, Mrs
Zhao. I think you ought to put your foot down for once. I’m sure if you did, everyone
would respect you for it. If you ask me, players is only trash anyway, so even if you
upset them, there’s nothing much they can do about it. Let these two things, the
powder and the ghost money, be your justification for making an example of them.
I’ll support you with my evidence. Give them a taste of your authority now and you
will find it that much easier to deal with other things later on. Even if the young
mistresses don’t like it, they’re not going to side against you with riff-raff like these.’
Aunt Zhao’s resolve was strengthened by this encouragement.
‘I didn’t know about the ghost money,’ she said. ‘Tell me what happened.’
Mamma Xia did so, in great detail, concluding with a further incitement to action.
‘Go and have it out with them, Mrs Zhao! We’ll stand by you if there’s any trouble.’
These words were as music in Aunt Zhao’s ears. Emboldened by them, she marched
off without more delay to Green Delights.
It chanced that Bao-yu was out when she arrived (he had heard that Dai-yu was
visiting All-spice Court and gone off to join her there) and Parfumee was having lunch
with Aroma and the other maids. The girls all rose to their feet as Aunt Zhao entered
and politely invited her to join them.
‘Won’t you have some lunch, Mrs Zhao? Why are you in such a hurry?’
Ignoring the invitation, Aunt Zhao stepped forward, threw the powder she was
carrying in Parfumee’s face and, with stabbing index finger for emphasis, began
shouting at her abusively.
‘Little strumpet! You’re a bit of bought goods, that’s all you are. We paid down
money and bought you, so that you could be trained to sing for our entertainment.
Play-actors and prostitutes are the class of people you belong to; the lowest servant
in this household is still a few steps above you. So what makes you think you have
the right to go discriminating between one person and another? It’s no skin off your
nose if Bao-yu wants to give something of his away to somebody: what business have
you to try and stop him? I suppose you thought when you palmed that stuff off on
Huan that he wouldn’t know the difference. Well, let me tell you: Master Huan is
Bao-yu’s brother, whatever you may think of him, and that means he’s one of the
masters, and there’s no cause for you to look down on him.’
Parfumee, never one to take things quietly, set up a howl of tearful protest.
‘I gave that stuff to him because I hadn’t got any orris and I was afraid if I told him I
hadn’t got any he wouldn’t believe me. Anyway, it’s good powder. And suppose I
have been trained as an actress, I’ve never played outside for money. I’m a little girl,
not a trumpet or whatever it was you called me. And as for being “bought goods”,
well, it wasn’t you who bought me. And anyway, look who’s talking! I thought all of
us here were bought goods. I don’t know why you of all people would want to drag
that up.’
‘Stop that at once!’ said Aroma, shocked, and tried to pull her Out of the way. But
Aunt Zhao, in speechless fury, had already advanced on Parfumee and dealt her a
couple of resounding slaps on the head. Aroma expostulated.
‘She’s only a child, Mrs Zhao, you don’t want to put yourself on the same level.
Leave it to us to deal with her.’
Parfumee was not to he struck with impunity and reacted to the assault with a fine
display of histrionics, weeping, shout?ing and throwing herself about in all directions.
‘How dare you hit me, you horrible old woman! You should look at yourself in the
mirror! Go on, hit me again then, hit me again! I don’t want to go on living!’
Lowering her head, she drove it into Aunt Zhao’s midriff, continuing, as she butted
into leer, to repeat her challenge. Several of the servants shouted at her and
attempted to pull her off. Aroma would have done so too, but Sky-bright drew her to
one side and advised her against joining them.
‘Leave them to it, Aroma Y6u and I don’t want to get mixed up in this. It’s the law of
the jungle now: you hit me, I hit you. Heaven knows where it will end!’
The servants who had followed in Aunt Zhao’s wake, when they heard the rumpus
inside, gave thanks to the Lord Buddha that justice was at last being done. Among
them, the old women who bore grudges against the little actresses were particularly
gratified to hear that Parfumee was being beaten.
The news travelled quickly. Nenuphar and Etamine, who had found a quiet corner of
All-spice Court in which to be alone together, heard it when the two former ‘painted
faces’ of their troupe, Xiang-yun’s Althee and Bao-qin’s Cardamome, burst in on them
to enlist their support.
‘Come on, you two! If we let them bully Parfumee, we shall all of us suffer. It’s time
to come out in the open and make a stand. Let’s show them a bit of spirit!’
The four of them were only children, full of righteous indig?nation for their friend.
Without a moment’s reflection they rushed off in a body and went charging into
Green Delights. Cardamome made first impact, and Aunt Zhao would have been
swept off her feet had she not been simultaneously ringed round by the three others,
who, with fists flailing, heads butting, and all emitting loud ‘boo-hoos’, pressed in
upon her rear and sides. Skybright and the senior maids, though pretending concern
and making half-hearted attempts to intervene, found it difficult not to laugh; but
Aroma was genuinely distressed and dashed from one to another of them, dragging
them away from Aunt Zhao. It was useless. As she pulled one off, another would dart
in to replace her.
‘What’s the matter with you all?’ wailed Aroma. ‘If you’ve got a grievance, why
can’t you discuss it like sensible human beings? You can’t go taking the law into your
own hands like this. I never heard of such a thing!’
Aunt Zhao could only curse helplessly. Etamine and Nenuphar held her firmly by each
arm and Althee and Cardamome had her pinned between them with their heads.
‘Kill us!’ they kept shouting, ‘Kill us all four!’
Parfumee meanwhile lay stretched out corpselike on the ground, having cried herself
into a swoon.
The little actresses might have remained locked in their grapple with Aunt Zhao
indefinitely, but Skybright had already sent Swallow to bear word of what was
happening to Tan-chun, and You-shi, Li Wan and Tan-chun, together with Patience
and a number of female domestics, now arrived upon the scene and shouted to them
peremptorily to release her.
Aunt Thao was by now pop-eyed with anger and the veins stood out thickly on her
forehead. They asked her how she came to be in such a predicament, but her reply,
though long and voluble, was made almost incomprehensible by rage, and You-shi
and Li Wan, unable to make anything of it, contented themselves with shouting some
more at the act?resses. Tan-chun, though, merely sighed.
‘This isn’t really very serious. You are too easily angered, Aunt. As a matter of fact
there was something I wanted to discuss with you, but the maids didn’t seem to
know where you had got to. Now it appears that you were in here, work?ing yourself
into a rage. Do come with us now.’
You-shi and Li Wan smilingly confirmed the invitation.
‘Yes, Mrs Zhao. Come with us to the office and we can discuss things with you
there.’
Since she could scarcely object to being consulted, Aunt Zhao was constrained to go
along with them, but even as she went she continued muttering angrily to herself
until Tan?-chun cut her short:
‘These girls are here for our amusement,’ Tan-chun said. ‘They are like pets. You
can talk to them and play with them if you feel like it, or if you don’t, you can simply
ignore them. It’s the same when they are naughty. Just as, when your puppy-dog
bites you or your kitten scratches you, you can either ignore it or have it punished, so
with these girls. If they do something to offend you, you can either let it pass, or, if
you don’t feel able to, you can call in one of the stewardesses and have them
punished. There is absolutely no need to go rushing off in person, shouting and
hollering at them. It’s so undignified. And besides, it sets so bad an example. Look at
Aunt Zhou. She doesn’t seem to suffer any of this disrespect you complain of and she
isn’t always rushing off after people to have it out with them. If I were you, Aunt, I
should go back to your room now and try to calm down a bit. And don’t go listening
any more to those trouble-makers. There’s no reason why you should do other
people’s work for them; you get no thanks for it; they merely laugh at you for being
stupid. However angry you may feel now, try to be patient for a few days until Lady
Wang gets back and we’ll see what we can do to get all this sorted out then.’
This dressing-down was effective, insofar as it left Aunt Zhao without a word to say,
and she returned in silence to her room. As soon as she had gone, Tan-chun burst out
angrily to the others.
‘You’d think she’d know better at her age. Why can’t she do anything to make
people respect her? I mean, what a ridic?ulous thing to quarrel about! And what a
way to behave! She will listen to absolutely anything anyone tells her. She has
absolutely no judgement of her own. And those wretched old women take advantage
of the fact to use her as their cat’s-paw.’
The more Tan-chun thought about it, the angrier she became. She ended up by
ordering the women to make some inquiries and find out whose incitement it was
that had goaded Aunt Zhao into action. The women went off obediently to
investigate, but turned to each other with shrugs and smiles as they left the building.
‘Like looking for a needle on the ocean bed!’
And though they had Aunt Zhao’s women and all the women from the Garden up in
front of them for question?ing, not one of them would admit to knowing anything at
all about it, and they were obliged to report back to Tan?-chun that they had failed.
‘But we shall go on making inquiries, miss,’ they said. ‘If we find anything suspicious,
we shall report it to you.’
Tan-chun’s anger had by this time subsided and she would have let the matter drop;
but Artemisie, the little actress who had been assigned to her apartment, came to
her privately to tell her that she could identify the culprit.
‘It was Mamma Xia,’ she said. ‘She hates us and she is always trying to get us into
trouble. The other day she tried to get Nenuphar into trouble for burning
spirit-money, but Bao-yu had asked her to burn it, and when he owned up, Mamma
Xia hadn’t a leg to stand on. Today, when I was delivering those handkerchiefs for you,
I noticed her and Mrs Zhao twittering away for ever such a long time together and
when they saw me coming they moved out of the way to avoid me.’
It seemed highly probable that it was Mamma Xia who had done the inciting; but
these little actresses were all closely in league together, Tan-chun reflected, and all of
them were exceptionally mischievous: it would be too risky to act on the evidence of
what one of them had said. She thanked Artemisie for her information, but inwardly
decided to do nothing.
By an unlucky chance Mamma Xia had a granddaughter who worked in Tan-chun’s
apartment and did various little errands for the maids, with all of whom she was
popular. Her name was Cicada, but the maids all called her ‘Ciggy’. On this particular
occasion Tan-chun had gone back to the jobs room’ after lunch, leaving Ebony in
charge of her apartment. Ebony now asked Ciggy to go to the Garden gatehouse and
get one of the pages there to run out and buy her a sweet-cake. Ciggy objected that
she had just finished sweeping the courtyard and had a backache. She told Ebony to
ask some?one else.
‘There’s no one else I can ask,’ said Ebony. ‘I tell you what. If you’ll do this errand
for me now, I’ll give you a piece of good advice that you can pass on to your grandma
when you get there.’
And she proceeded to tell her about Artemisie’s denunciation.
‘Tell her to be on her guard.’
‘The little beast!’ said Ciggy, taking the money for the sweetcake. ‘She wants to join
in too, does she? Wait till I tell my gran!’
And off she went to the back gate of the Garden.
It was a slack time now in the kitchen and the women, Mamma Xia among them,
having for the time being finished with fetching and carrying; were sitting outside on
the steps and gossiping. Ciggy asked one of them to go out and buy a hot fried
sweetcake for her and then proceeded to give her grandmother an account,
interlarded with much bad language of her own, of what Ebony had told her about
Artemisie.
Mamma Xia, both angered and alarmed by what she heard, was all for going off
straight away, having it out with the little actress, and protesting her innocence to
Tan-chun; but Ciggy prevented her.
‘Don’t go, Gran! What can you say to them if you do go? How are you going to
explain how you got to know about it? Once they start asking questions, you’ll be in
the soup again. I’ve told you this to put you on your guard. You don’t have to do
anything about it.’
Just then Parfumee peered in the gateway of the kitchen courtyard and called across
to Mrs Liu, the cook, who was still banging about inside the kitchen.
‘Cookie, Master Bao says, for his vegetable dish this evening could he have
something cold and vinegary again, please, only not so oily as last time?’
‘Very good,’ Cook Liu stood in her doorway and called back cheerfully. ‘Why should
they send you about such a great, important matter? Come in and look around, if it’s
not too dirty for you.’
Parfumee had barely stepped into the courtyard when the woman to whom Ciggy
had entrusted the money arrived back carrying Ebony’s hot fritter on a saucer.
‘Oo, lovely hot fritter! Give us a taste!’ said Parfumee jokingly.
‘That has been ordered and paid for by someone else,’ said Ciggy primly, as she
took the saucer from the woman. ‘It is not for you.’
‘Do you fancy one, miss?’ Cook Liu asked Parfumee. ‘I’ve got one in here that I
bought for our Fivey you can have if you like. It hasn’t been touched yet, so it’s quite
clean.’
She brought the fried cake out on a saucer and handed it to Parfumee.
‘There you are. Now you wait there a moment and I’ll heat up a nice cup of tea for
you to go with it.’
She went inside again to rake the top off the fire and heat some tea up in a skillet.
But instead of waiting for her, Parfumee picked the fritter up from its saucer, went
over to Ciggy with it, and held it under her nose for her to inspect.
‘Look what’s that, then? Fritter. Who wants your mouldy fritter? I was only joking. I
wouldn’t eat yours if you went down on your bended knees and begged me to!’
She began to crumble it up between her fingers and throw the pieces to the birds.
‘Don’t worry, Mrs Liu!’ she called out in the direction of the kitchen. ‘I’ll buy two
catties of these for you presently.’
Ciggy glared at her in outrage.
‘Old Thunder up there must be blind not to strike you dead,’ she said bitterly.
‘Either that, or he must be angry with me for something. Still, I can’t compete with
you, can I! I haven’t got anyone to rush out and give me things, or trot around after
me like a self-adopted slave, or chip in with a good word for me when there’s an
argument.’
‘All right, young ladies, that’s enough!’ said the women on the steps. ‘Can’t you
even see each other without having words?’
The more discerning of them, sensing that a storm was brewing and not wanting to
get involved, had already begun slipping off elsewhere. But Ciggy had no stomach for
a fight and went off, muttering angrily to herself, without further argument.
When the women had all gone, Cook Liu came bustling Out of her kitchen for a
private word with Parfumee.
‘That business we were talking about the other day -have you spoken to him about
it yet?’
‘Yes, I have,’ said Parfumee. ‘I was going to remind him of it today, but that
wretched Zhao woman came along and upset everything with her quarrelling. How’s
Fivey? Did she drink any of that Essence of Roses I brought her the other day?’
‘She drank it all,’ said Cook Liu. ‘She loved it. She’d really like some more, to tell the
truth, but she doesn’t like to ask.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Parfumee. ‘I can easily get her some more. I only have to ask
for it.’
The object of Parfumee’s inquiry, who owed her strange name to the fact that she
was the fifth of Old Liu’s granddaughters, though only the daughter of a cook, was in
both looks and intelligence a match for any of the senior maids -Patience, Aroma,
Faithful or Nightingale - and it was only because of a weakly constitution that she
was still, in her sixteenth year, without employment. Recently, however, observing
how numerous the maids were in Bao-yu’s apartment and how light their duties
were, and hearing that it was his intention to give them their freedom when they had
finished service with him, her mother had conceived the ambition of getting her on
the staff of Green Delights. Lack of a contact there had at first made this ambition
seem unrealizable; but Cook Liu had previously worked at Pear Tree Court, where her
cheerful and ungrudging service had won her golden opinions with the girls. They
greatly preferred her to their own foster-mothers. And so when Parfumee moved
into Green Delights, the cook had easily. prevailed on her to tackle Bao-yu on her
daughter’s behalf. Bao-yu had consented willingly, but the situation created by
Xi-feng’s illness together with other more recent developments had so far prevented
him from seeking higher approval for the appointment.
But we digress.
Bao-yu heard about the fracas created in his apartment by Aunt Zhao while he was at
All-spice Court visiting the girls. Though deeply distressed on Parfumee’s behalf, he
decided, after some hesitation, that intervention by him could only make matters
worse, and resolved to stay where he was. He did so until word reached All-spice
Court that Tan-chun had succeeded in getting Aunt Zhao out of the way. Returning
then, he had formally reproved Parfumee for her belligerency and then sent her on
an errand to the kitchen.
Parfumee now arrived back at Green Delights and reported on the fulfilment of her
mission. She also told him that, if he still had any, Fivey would like some more of the
Essence of Roses.
‘Yes, I think I’ve still got some,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Look, why don’t you give her all of it? I
don’t drink it very often myself.’
He sent Aroma to fetch it. As there was not a great deal of it left, he told Parfumee
that Fivey might as well keep the bottle. Parfumee went back to the kitchen again to
give the bottle to Cook Liu.
When she got there, she found Fivey there as well. To give her ailing, cooped-up
daughter a little treat, Cook Liu had brought her along with her that day when she
went to work. The girl had just been taking a little walk in the environs of her
mother’s kitchen and was now resting her feet in the kitchen and having a cup of tea.
Mother and daughter, when they saw the glittering five-inch crystal bottle half-full of
ruby liquid that Parfumee was carrying, assumed that it was some of Bao-yu’s West
Ocean grape wine that she was bring?ing them.
‘Sit yourself down,’ said Cook Liu. ‘I’ll just fetch the mulling-pan and boil up some
water to heat it in.’
Parfumee laughed.
‘That’s all there is, I’m afraid. He says you can keep the bottle.’
Fivey realized that the red liquid must be not grape wine but some more Essence of
Roses, and thanked her effusively for her kindness. Parfumee asked her how she felt.
‘A bit livelier today,’ said Fivey. ‘That’s why I came in with Mother. I’ve been for a
walk all around here, but there’s really not much to look at just a lot of rocks and the
backs of buildings. I haven’t seen anything that you could really call a view.’


‘Why don’t you go right inside?’ said Parfumee.
‘Because I won’t let her,’ her mother chipped in. ‘None of the young ladies in there
knows her. If some inquisitive person were to stop her and start asking questions,
she’d have a lot of trouble explaining what she was doing. Once you’ve got her a
place in there, as you so kindly promised, I’m sure there will be plenty willing to show
her around. She’ll be able to look around the Garden then until she’s sick of the sight
of it!’
‘You don’t want to worry,’ said Parfumee. ‘I’d look after her.’
‘I’m sure you would, bless you!’ said the cook. ‘But folks like us have to be more
careful.’
She poured Parfumee a cup of tea. Parfumee accepted her hospitality to the extent
of using some of this as a mouth?wash before getting up to go.
‘My hands are a bit full at the moment,’ said Cook Liu. ‘Fivey will see you out.’
The two girls went out together. Having first ascertained that there was no one else
about, Fivey impulsively took Parfumee by the hand:
‘Did you really ask him about that?’
‘Of Course I did!’ said Parfumee. ‘I wouldn’t deceive you. I’ve found out that there
are two vacancies that haven’t yet been filled: one of them is the place left by
Crimson, for whom Mrs Lian still hasn’t found him a substitute; the other one is
Trinket’s. If he asks for you, it will be only one out of those two places, so he will be
perfectly within his rights. The only reason he hasn’t done so already is because
Patience keeps telling Aroma that if we have any requests concerning either jobs or
allowances to make, we’d be well advised to put them off for the time being. The fact
is that Miss Tan is looking for someone to make an example of. She’s already made an
example of Mrs Lian by turning down two or three of her requests in a row, and now
she’s trying to pick on us. She hasn’t found an excuse for doing so yet, but she hasn’t
given up trying. So if we go asking her about a thing like this now, it’s almost a
foregone conclusion that she will say no; and once she’s turned it down, it will be
very difficult to get that refusal reversed. Much better wait until the situation here
has quietened down a bit - till Their Lady-ships are back again and everyone is in a
good mood. If he approaches the old girl then, she’ll give him anything he asks for, no
matter what it is.’
‘I know,’ said Fivey, ‘but I’m too impatient to wait that long. I want that job now. In
the first place it will make my mother happy. She’ll feel that all the trouble she has
had in bringing me up has not been wasted. Secondly, the pay I shall earn will make
things easier for them at home. And thirdly, if only I felt a bit more cheerful, as I shall
do if I get that job, I do believe that this illness of mine would get better - and that
would mean a great saving for my family on doctor’s fees and medicines.’
At that point Parfumee left her and continued on her way back alone. Fivey returned
to the kitchen. She and her mother spoke warmly together of Parfumee’s kindness.
‘I’d never have thought anything like this would ever come our way,’ said Cook Liu.
‘Still, though it’s so precious, you can have too much of a good thing. You don’t want
to overheat your blood. I think it would be rather a nice gesture if we were to pour a
little of this off to give to someone else.’
Fivey asked her who she had in mind.
‘I was thinking of taking half a cupful to your uncle’s boy,’ said Cook Liu. ‘He’s been
down with a fever this last day or two, and it’s just the sort of thing he would enjoy.’
Fivey made no reply and watched in silence while her rnother decanted a small
quantity of the red liquid into a teacup and then placed the bottle, after corking it up
again, on a shelf of the kitchen cupboard.
‘I think if I were you I wouldn’t give him that,’ she said finally. There was a wry little
smile on her face. ‘If anyone should ask you where it came from, we might find
ourselves in trouble.’
‘Oh, fiddlesticks!’ said her mother. ‘Surely we don’t have to be that careful? If you
work as hard as I do all the year round, you are entitled to a few perks. No one is
going to say that we stole it, surely?’
She sailed off cup in hand then to her brother’s, leaving Fivey alone in the kitchen.
She found her nephew in bed. He and his parents were all three delighted when they
learned what she had brought them. A cupful of cool water freshly drawn from the
well was mixed with a little of the essence and handed to the sick boy to drink. He
finished it at one draught and immediately declared that he felt better and that his
head seemed somewhat clearer. The cup containing the remainder of the essence
was covered with a square of paper and set on the table beside him.
While Cook Liu was still there, some of the sick boy’s workmates from the mansion
called in to visit him. Among them was a young fellow called Qian Huai, related on his
mother’s side to Aunt Zhao. His father worked in Accounts. Qian Huai’s own job was
to accompany Jia Huan when he went to school. A bachelor and with money to
spend, he had for long been an admirer of Fivey’s and in time past his parents had, at
his insistence, made several approaches to Fivey’s parents through intermediaries
asking for Fivey’s hand in marriage. Her parents were by no means averse to the
match, but as Fivey herself, though without actually saying anything, made it
perfectly plain by her behaviour that the idea was repugnant to her, they had not
dared to accept. More recently, with talk of Fivey going into service in the Garden,
they had been less inclined than ever to look on Qian Huai as a possible son-in-law,
for it now seemed probable that after four or five years’ service as a maid, Fivey
would be at liberty to marry someone of their own choice from outside. Qian Huai’s
parents, too, when they saw the way things stood, were inclined to let the matter
drop.
Not so Qian Huai, however. Wounded in his amour propre by Fivey’s rejection, he
made a fierce vow that he would pursue her relentlessly, with all the force and guile
at his command, until he had succeeded in making her his wife.
It was a surprise to him, needless to say, to call with the other pages on his sick
workmate and find Fivey’s mother at the bedside. Cook Liu was equally flustered on
recognizing Qian Huai among the little group of visitors and got up to go, on the
pretext of being busy.
‘Do just stay for a cup of tea,’ said her brother and sister-in-law. ‘It was so kind of
you to think of him.’
‘I expect they’ll he wanting their dinner inside now,’ said Cook Liu. ‘I’ll come and
see him again when I’m not so busy.’
The sister-in-law opened a drawer and took out a small paper packet from it as they
were leaving. Outside, at the corner by the gate, she pressed it, smilingly, into Cook
Liu’s hand.
‘This is something your brother brought back yesterday, from the gate. He was five
days on duty there and not a single tip all the time. Then suddenly yesterday some
high-up from Canton came here on a visit and left three little baskets of this white
stuff - “Lycoperdon Snow” it’s called - two for the masters and one for the people on
the gate. This here is your brother’s share of it. I opened it last night to have a look.
It’s beautiful stuff - so white and fine. They say that a little of it taken every morning
mixed with breast-milk is wonderful for building up the body. If you can’t get
breast-milk, you can use cow’s milk, or even plain boiled water. Of course, we
immediately thought of your Fivey; it would be just the thing for her. I sent our little
maid round with some this morning, but she said your door was locked. She said you
must have taken Fivey in with you. I would have gone in then to see her and given it
to her myself; but then I thought that with the mistresses away they’re much stricter
about letting people in and out now and they’d be sure to ask what business I had
going inside. And besides, this last day or two we’ve heard rumours of such terrible
goings-on in there, I should be afraid of getting mixed up in something. So it’s a good
job you came today, sister-in-law; you’ll be able to take the packet to her yourself.’
Cook Liu thanked her and left. At the corner gate of the Garden her way was blocked
by a grinning page.
‘Where have you been, missus? There have been two or three calls from inside
asking for you. Me and the others have been looking for you all over the place.
Where have you just come from? You don’t live out in this direction. I bet you’ve
been up to something!’
‘Cheeky little monkey!’ said the cook.
The rest of their exchange is recorded in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 61

Bao-yu owns up to a crime he
did not commit
And Patience bends authority in order that
the innocent may be spared



Cook Liu was trying to get back into the Garden, but the bantering page-boy delayed
her.
‘You don’t live in this direction. Naughty old Auntie! What have you been up to?’
“‘Auntie” is it?’ said Cook Liu, laughing. ‘Cheeky little monkey! If your “auntie” has
got herself a fancy man, that means you have a new uncle, so what are you worrying
about? You open that gate quickly, my lad, and let me in, or I’ll take hold of you by
that little po-cover of yours and pull your hair out!’
‘If I let you in, promise you’ll pinch a few apricots for me,’ said the boy, ‘to make up
for having kept me waiting so long. Mind you don’t forget, now, or next time you
want to nip out in the middle of the night for a bottle of wine or some oil, I’ll not
open for you. I’ll just let you stand there shouting and not even answer you.’
‘You must be mad!’ said the cook. ‘We can’t do that sort of thing any more now.
Nowadays it’s all divided up among the garden-women; and there isn’t one of them,
either, that wouldn’t just as soon scratch your eyes out as look at you. You only have
to walk under one of the fruit-trees and they’re watching you like hawks. Fat chance I
should have of picking any of the fruit for you! Only yester?day I was walking
underneath a plum-tree and raised my hand to drive a bee away that was buzzing in
front of my face. One of your old aunties happened to see me, but as she was quite a
long way off, she couldn’t quite make out what I was doing. She thought I was picking
the plums. Oh, you should have heard her shout! “Don’t take them! We haven’t
offered the first-fruits yet. No one must have any of those plums until Their Ladyships
have got back and made the offerings. You’ll get your share in time.” I suppose she
thought I had a craving and couldn’t wait! I’m afraid I wasn’t very polite. I gave her a
piece of my mind. You ask one of your old aunties if you want some fruit, my boy, it’s
no good asking me. You asking me for fruit is like the granary rat asking the crow
for corn: Have asking Have-not!’
‘Oh dear, oh dear!’ said the boy sarcastically. ‘If you can’t get me any, you can’t;
there’s no need to go on about it so. I suppose you think you won’t be needing my
services any more; but you will. When your Fivey gets her job inside, you’re going to
need my services more than ever.’
‘Whatever rubbish will the boy come out with next?’ said the cook. ‘What job are
you talking about?’
‘It’s no good pretending,’ the boy crowed. ‘I know. You needn’t think you’re the
only one with contacts inside. I’ve got my contacts too. I may be all the time working
here outside, but I’ve got two girl cousins inside who keep me informed. There’s
nothing much going on inside there that I don’t know about.’
At that point in their exchange they were interrupted by an old woman’s voice from
within:
‘Come on, you little monkey, you let Mrs Liu in this minute! If she doesn’t come in
directly, they won’t get their dinners in time.’
‘Don’t worry, I’m coming!’
Cook Liu brushed past the boy and, pushing the gate open for herself, went hurrying
back to the kitchen. Several of her assistants were waiting there already. They had
been standing about doing nothing, none of them having dared to take the initiative
without her.
‘Where’s Fivey gone?’ she asked them.
‘She just this minute went off to look for her cousins in the tea-room,’ they said.
Cook Liu put the packet of Lycoperdon Snow somewhere to give to her daughter later
and began making up the food-boxes for the different apartments. While she was
engaged in this work, Ying-chun’s little maid Lotus arrived with a message from
Chess.
‘Chess says for dinner tonight she wants a bowl of egg-custard, lightly done.’
‘That’s a bit of a luxury just now,’ said the cook. ‘I don’t know why it is, but for some
reason hen’s eggs seem to be in very short supply this year. Ten cash each they’re
charging for them at the moment, and even then you’re lucky if you can find any. The
other day, when they were making up a present for one of Her Ladyship’s relations
that had just had a baby, there were four or five of our buyers out scouring the
markets for eggs. They had no end of a job getting together two thousand. So you
can imagine what it must be like for me. Tell her to ask for eggs some other time.’
‘The other day when she wanted bean-curd, you gave me some that was rancid,’
said Lotus, ‘and I got a telling-off for it. Now she wants eggs and you say you haven’t
got any. I bet I could find some here if I looked.’
She stepped over to the food-container and took the lid off. Among the other things
revealed was a little cache of some ten or a dozen eggs.
‘There you are, what are they then?’ she said. ‘Aren’t you terrible? The food we eat
is all paid for, I don’t know why you’re so grudging with it. It isn’t as if you’d laid the
eggs yourself!’
‘I’ll give you laying eggs, my girl! If anyone lays eggs around here, it’ll be your
mother! Those are the only eggs I’ve got left and I’ve been saving them up to use as
garnishing on other dishes. Even then I’ll only use them if the young mistresses ask
for them specially. I need to have a few eggs by me in case of emergency. What am I
going to do if one of the mistresses asks for some eggs and you lot have already
eaten them all? “What?” she’ll say. “No eggs? Not even any eggs?” You people lead
such soft, sheltered lives. All you’ve got to do is stretch your hands out for
washing-water and your mouths open for food. You think eggs are the commonest
things in the world, you don’t realize there can be such things as shortages. Never
mind eggs, the day may yet come when there’s not even a corn-stalk to be had. My
advice to you girls is to try and make do with what you’re given. After all, you get the
best quality white rice, and chicken and duck to eat every day. It’s too much
pampering that causes this passion for variety: eggs one day, bean-curd the next,
fried pickled turnips in gluten batter ... It’s all very well saying you want something
different, but I’m afraid it won’t do. If each lot wants something different, that’s ten
different dishes I’ve got to prepare. I might just as well stop catering for the young
mistresses altogether and do nothing but cook for you girls!’
Lotus went red and shouted angrily back at her.
‘It’s not true that we’re always asking for something different. This rigmarole of
yours is quite uncalled for. Anyway, it’s your job to give us what we want. If that isn’t
your job, I’d like to know what is. You were obliging enough to Swallow the other day,
when she came to say that Skybright wanted a dish of artemisia shoots. “With pork
or with chicken?” you asked her. And when Swallow said Skybright didn’t eat meat,
she’d have it with wheat gluten, only not too much oil, “Oh,” you said, “how stupid of
me! I’d quite forgotten she was a vegetarian.” You scurried off to wash your hands
first before you cooked it, and when you’d cooked it, you carried it all the way there
for her your?self, just like a little dog that runs wagging its tall to its master. Why you
should pick on me to make an example of in front of all these people, I do not know.’
‘Holy name!’ said Cook Liu. ‘These people here will be my witness. Whenever
anyone from one of the other apartments, whether mistress or maid, asks me for a
special order -and I’m not just talking about that occasion you mentioned, I’m talking
about ever since this kitchen here first started -they invariably offer me something to
cover the extra cost. Whether I have to buy anything extra or not, it’s a nice gesture
and I appreciate it. Some people think that as I only have the young ladies to cater for,
I must make a lot out of it; but if anyone took the trouble to sit down and work it out,
they’d get a shock. Between forty and fifty people I have to cater for, counting both
mistresses and maids. And do you know what my daily allowance is? Two chickens,
two ducks, ten catties of pork and a thousand cash worth of vegetables. You try
managing on that! I can barely make it stretch to two meals a day provided everyone
sticks to the regu?lar menu; but if I’m going to have one person ordering one thing
and one person ordering another, turning down the food I’ve bought for them and
expecting me to buy other materials to make up their orders, my allowance simply
won’t stretch to it. If that’s the way you want it, you’ll just have to ask Her Ladyship
to give you all bigger allowances; then we can do what they do in the main kitchen
for Her Old Ladyship’s meals: have a blackboard with the names of all the dishes
under the sun chalked up on it and work through them one by one, having a different
dish every day. Then you could settle with me for what you’d eaten at the end of
each month. A week or two ago Miss Tan and Miss Bao suddenly thought they’d
fancy a dish of salted bean-sprouts and Miss Tan sent one of the girls over with five
hundred cash to ask me if I would prepare it for them. I laughed. “They’d never eat
five hundred cash worth,” I said, “not if they had bellies like the Laughing Buddha.
Twenty or thirty cash would be ample.” I sent the money back to her, but she
wouldn’t take it - said I should keep it to buy myself a drink with. “Now that the
kitchen’s inside,” she said, “I expect you often have people coming round and asking
you for favours.” She said, “I know it’s hard for you to refuse them, but even salt and
soy sauce cost something, and we don’t want you to end up out of pocket. Let’s call
this a payment to make up for some of the extras that other people have had out of
you.” Now there’s a kind, understanding young lady! I praise the Lord in my heart for
a young lady like that! Too bad that Mrs Zhao got to hear about it. She was furious, of
course: thought I was doing far too well out of it. And sure enough she sent one of
her little maids round less than ten days later asking for this and asking for that. I
couldn’t help laughing. You’re just the same. I suppose you’ve taken a leaf out of her
book. Well, it’s no good. My allowance just won’t stretch to it.’
Just then another messenger arrived from Chess to find out what had become of
Lotus.
‘What’s the matter?’ the messenger asked her. ‘Have you taken root or something?
Why don’t you come back?’
Lotus flounced off angrily after the messenger. The report that she gave when she
got back was so highly embellished that Chess could hardly fail to be incensed by it.
She was unable to do anything about it for the time being, because she was in the
middle of serving Ying-chun her dinner; but as soon as Ying-chun’s meal was over,
she hurried off to the kitchen, taking several of the junior maids with her.
She arrived as the kitchen staff were having their own dinner. The women, to whom
it was obvious that some kind of mischief was imminent, rose to their feet with
nervous smiles on their faces and invited her to sit with them. Ignor?ing the women,
she issued a brusque command to her minions:
‘Right! Boxes, bins, cupboards - wherever the food’s kept - throw it all out! Better
the dogs eat it than these swindlers have it all!’
The young maids, needing no second bidding, threw themselves with great gusto into
the work of ransacking the kitchen, while the women made vain efforts to restrain
them and pleaded with Chess to call them off.
‘You don’t want to believe everything those young girls tell you, miss. Mrs Liu
would never dare offend you, she knows it’s more than her job is worth. She did say
that eggs are hard to come by lately, it’s true; but we told her that it was silly of her
to take that line, and that if you say you want something, it’s up to her to find some
means of getting it for you, whatever it is. That’s what we told her. She’d already
admitted that she was in the wrong and put a basin of eggs in the steamer before
you arrived. Look on the stove, if you don’t believe us.’
Chess’s anger subsided somewhat under these blandishments and the young maids
were persuaded, albeit reluct?antly, to discontinue their pillage. Chess continued to
grumble for a bit and make unflattering remarks about the cook, but was eventually
persuaded to return, while Cook Liu, with much banging of pots and pans and
indignant muttering, set about making her a custard. When this was in due course
delivered to her, Chess promptly emptied it on the ground, but the woman who had
taken it prudently refrained from reporting this fact on her return for fear of
provoking further unpleasantness.
When Fivey returned to the kitchen, her mother gave her some soup and a half a
bowlful of congee and told her about the Lycoperdon Snow. Fivey, resolving to share
the latter with her friend and benefactress Parfumée, wrapped half of it up m a
separate sheet of paper and, having waited until it was dusk, when there were not
many people about, made her way to Green Delights, keeping to the trees as much
as possible, so that no one should see her. She managed to get as far as the gate of
the courtyard without being stopped by anyone, but, not daring to go inside,
retreated to the cover of some rose bushes and lurked there until someone should
come out.
Fortunately she did not have long to wait. After about the time it would take to drink
a cup of tea Swallow came out of the gate and Fivey stepped out of the bushes and
called to her to stop. Swallow could not at first make out who it was and had to go up
close and scrutinize her before asking what she wanted.
‘Will you tell Parfumee to come out for a minute, please?’ said Fivey. ‘I want to
have a word with her.’
Swallow laughed softly.
‘You’re too impatient. Your business is sure to be settled within the next ten days,
whatever you do. It’s silly to keep on asking. Anyway, she’s just gone out to the front,
so you’ll have to wait a bit. But perhaps it would be better if you gave me a message
to pass on to her. If you wait till she comes back, you might find yourself inside still
when they shut the gate.’
Fivey handed her the packet.
‘This stuff is Lycoperdon Snow …’
She went on to explain what its properties were and how it was to be taken.
‘I’ve just been given some and I want to share it with her. Would you mind giving it
to her for me, please?’
Leaving the packet in Swallow’s hands, she turned and began swiftly making her way
back again. She had just got as far as the part of the Garden bordering Flowery
Harbour when she saw Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife at the head of a party of stewardesses
coming towards her from the opposite direction. Concealment was impossible; there
was nothing for it but to walk straight up to them and greet them.
‘What are you doing, running around like this?’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘I thought
you were supposed to be ill.’
Fivey forced herself to smile.
‘I’ve been a bit better this last day or two, so Mother brought me into the Garden
with her for a change of air. I’ve just been to Green Delights for her, to deliver
something.’
‘That can’t be right,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘I saw your mother go out of the
Garden just now; that’s why I shut the gate. If she’d really sent you to Green Delights,
why didn’t she tell me you were still inside? Why did she go out and let me lock the
gate without saying anything? You must be lying.’
Fivey was momentarily at a loss for a reply.
‘Actually she told me this morning but I forgot,’ she stammered. ‘I only just now
remembered. Probably she didn’t say anything about my being in here because she
thought I’d already gone home.’
Observing her confusion and the halting nature of her reply, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife
remembered that Silver had lately reported some things missing from Lady Wang’s
apartment which none of the other maids would admit to having taken and
wondered if Fivey might be the thief. It was unfortunate for Fivey that Ciggy and
Lotus, together with a number of older servants, should have arrived on the scene at
that moment and helped to confirm her suspicion.
‘Give her a good grilling, Mrs Lin!’ said one of these new arrivals. ‘She’s been
sneaking to and fro all over the place this last day or two. I don’t know what she’s
been up to, but she’s certainly been up to something.’
‘Yes,’ said Ciggy, ‘and Silver told me yesterday that when they opened that
cupboard in Her Ladyship’s side room the other day they found a whole lot of things
missing. They noticed there was a bottle short when Mrs Lian sent Patience over for
some Essence of Roses, otherwise they’d never have thought of looking.’
‘Oh?’ said Lotus with a pleased-looking smirk. ‘I didn’t know about that. As a
matter of fact I’ve seen a bottle of Essence of Roses somewhere today.’
‘Where?’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife asked eagerly. Ever since the bottle from Lady Wang’s
cupboard had been found missing, Xi-feng had been sending Patience round daily to
inquire about the progress of her investigations and she was under great pressure to
discover the thief.
‘In her mother’s kitchen,’ said Lotus.
Lanterns were lit and the little party hurried off to investigate, Fivey protesting
anxiously as they went:
‘But that little bottle came from Master Bao’s room. It was given to me by
Parfumée.’
‘Parfumy!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife contemptuously. ‘If we find the evidence in the
kitchen, I shall have to report it, and that’s that. It will be up to you to explain
yourself to the mistresses if you can.’
By now they had reached the kitchen and some of them, led by Lotus, went inside to
look. They came out almost immediately with the bottle. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, thinking
that there might be other stolen articles in the kitchen, ordered a thorough search, in
the course of which the packet of lycoperdon was discovered. Taking this and the
rose essence as evidence, they now led Fivey off to face Li Wan and Tan-chun.
But Li Wan would not see them. Jia Lan was ill, and she was too busy looking after
him to have time for household business. They should see Miss Tan about it, she said.
Tan-chun was not in the office, having already returned to her own apartment. Off
they all trooped then to Tan-chun’s place, where one of their number went inside to
announce their business. The maids were all in the courtyard enjoying the cool
evening air. Tan-chun was inside, washing her hair, they said. Scribe went indoors to
report. It seemed an age before she re-emerged.
‘I told Miss Tan. She said you’d better find Patience and ask her to see Mrs Lian
about it.’
So off they went once more, this time to Wang Xi-feng’s place, where they told their
business to Patience. Patience, on going inside to report, found that her mistress had
just gone to bed. Xi-feng heard her through, after which she gave judgement
summarily as follows:
‘Give the mother forty strokes, turn her out of the Garden, and make sure that she
is never employed inside the Inner Gate again. Give Fivey forty strokes too and pack
her off to the grange. They can either sell her or marry her to one of the hands.’
Patience relayed this verdict, word for word, to Lin Zhi?xiao’s wife and the others
waiting outside. Fivey, shocked and weeping, threw herself on her knees at
Patience’s feet and explained to her how Parfumee had given her the rose essence as
a present.
‘We can clear that up easily enough,’ said Patience. ‘All we’ve got to do is wait until
we can ask Parfumée tomorrow to find out whether she gave it to you or not. But
what about this lycoperdon stuff? That was brought here as a present for Their
Ladyships. No one had the right to touch that before Their Ladyships had seen it.’
Fivey explained that the packet of powder came not from Lady Wang’s store but from
her uncle’s share of the surplus that had been given as a douceur to the gate-people.
‘That puts you in the clear then,’ said Patience, smiling. ‘It’s beginning to look as if
you are wearing the hat for someone else.’ She turned to Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘It’s too
late to do anything about this now. Mrs Lian has just taken her medicine and gone to
bed; I can’t go pestering her about a little thing like this at this time of night. You’d
better hand her over to the night watch and tell them to look after her until the
morning. I’ll explain it all to Mrs Lian tomorrow, and we’ll see what we can do.’
Lacking the confidence to dispute this countermanding by Patience of her mistress’s
orders, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife conducted Fivey outside and handed her into the custody
of the watch before continuing about her own business.
Though still unbound, Fivey was unable to move freely and was obliged to stay where
she was put and listen to the ill-natured comments of the old women. Some of them,
assum?ing as a matter of course that she was guilty, rebuked her for her misconduct;
others complained of the trouble that she was causing them.
‘As if we haven’t got work enough already, they have to give us this thief to mind,’
they grumbled. ‘If she does herself an injury or gives us the slip while we’re not
looking, we shall get into trouble!’
And those who in the past had got on badly with her mother rejoiced in the
daughter’s discomfiture and lost no opportunity of taunting and abusing her.
Poor Fivey! Her heart was full of the injustice of it, but there was no one to pour out
her troubles to. The hardships of that night were doubly distressing to a person of
her weak and ailing constitution: no one to give her tea or even a cup of water when
she was thirsty, no pillow or bedding for her to lie on - even if she had felt like
sleeping. The wretched girl spent the whole night in almost continuous weeping.
The enemies of Fivey and her mother, disappointed that the sentence could not be
carried out on them immediately and fearful that the morrow might bring some
remission, rose up next morning at crack of dawn and went secretly to Patience,
hoping, by means of bribes and flattery, to buy her over. They extolled her
resoluteness and drew her attention to various past misdemeanours of Cook Liu in
order to strengthen the evidence against her. Patience accepted their presents,
listened politely to their advice, and as soon as they had gone, slipped quietly over to
Green Delights and asked Aroma whether Parfumée had in fact given some Essence
of Roses to Fivey.
‘I certainly gave some to Parfumée,’ said Aroma, ‘but whether or not she passed it
on to someone else, I couldn’t say.’
She called in Parfumée to ask her. Parfumée, in some alarm, at once confirmed that
she had given the bottle to Fivey and went off to tell Bao-yu what had happened.
Bao?yu was as shocked as she was.
‘The Essence of Roses is no problem,’ he said; ‘but what about the Lycoperdon
Snow? I’m sure what she told them about it was the truth, but if it gets known that
her uncle took it while on duty, then he’s going to get into trouble -which seems a
rather poor exchange for his kindness.’
He thought he had better see Patience himself and point this out to her.
‘Look,’ he said, ‘the Essence of Roses can be accounted for easily enough, but that
Lycoperdon Snow business still looks a bit fishy. Why don’t you be a nice, kind girl,
Patience, and tell them that the Lycoperdon Snow was given to her by Parfumee as
well? Then that disposes of the whole affair.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Patience, smiling, ‘but she told everyone last night that
her uncle gave it to her. How can she now make out that she got it from you? And
apart from that, don’t forget that the bottle of Essence of Roses from Her Ladyship’s
room has still to be accounted for. If this isn’t it, where are they going to look for it?
It’s not very likely that anyone else will own up to having taken it.’
Skybright stepped over at this point to join in the discussion.
‘The Essence of Roses from Her Ladyship’s place must have been stolen by Sunset
to give to young Huan. It’s as plain as the nose on your face. I don’t understand why
you’re all making such a mystery of it.’
‘I know that as well as you do,’ said Patience, ‘but it’s not so simple. Silver, who was
so worried about finding that bottle missing that she was in tears, did go, very quietly
and nicely, and ask Sunset if she had taken it, and if Sunset had had the grace to say
‘yes’, Silver herself would have done nothing, and I’m quite sure that no one else
would have made an issue of it. Who’s going to stir up trouble about a little thing like
that? But unfortunately not only would Sunset not admit to having taken it, but she
even had the gall to accuse Silver of taking it herself. The two of them made such a
hullabaloo between them that soon everyone in the household had heard about it.
By that stage I couldn’t ignore the matter any longer, even if I’d wanted to. I had to
investigate it. And the first thing I found, of course, was that the one doing all the
accusing was actually the thief. But without any evidence, there was nothing much I
could do.’
‘I can take responsibility for that too,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You can tell them I stole the
bottle from Her Ladyship’s room to give the girls a scare. Now everything is
accounted for.’
‘No doubt it’s an act of merit to clear someone else of suspicion,’ said Aroma, ‘but
Her Ladyship won’t be very pleased when she hears. She’ll say you’ve been up to
your old childish tricks again.’
‘Oh, that’s of no consequence,’ said Patience. ‘We could of course clear this matter
up quite easily by looking for the stolen bottle in Mrs Zhao’s room. The only reason I
hesitate to do that is because I’m afraid it would make things difficult for a certain
person whose feelings I do care about very much. I know she would be distressed,
and the last thing I want to do is “damage the jade vase while trying to hit the
mouse”.’
She held three fingers up as she said this to indicate that it was Tan-chun she was
referring to. Aroma and the rest nodded in agreement.
‘That’s true. Perhaps it would be better if Bao-yu took all the blame.’
‘Yes,’ said Patience, ‘but at the same time I think we ought to call Sunset and Silver
here and get this matter properly sorted out. We don’t want whoever it is to think
she can get away with it. If we do nothing, she’s sure to think it’s be?cause we
haven’t the wit to find out rather than that it’s for the reason I’ve just said, and she’ll
think she can go on stealing things with impunity.’
This being agreed on, Patience sent someone to call them over.
‘Well, you can stop worrying now, you two,’ she said when they had arrived. ‘They
think they’ve found the thief.’
‘Where is she?’ said Silver.
‘At the moment she’s in Mrs Lian’s room being questioned,’ said Patience. ‘She’s
admitted taking everything they’ve asked her about. I happen to know myself that
she didn’t take them and is only confessing because she’s frightened. Master Bao
can’t bear the idea of an innocent person suffering and has already agreed to take
responsibility for some of them. As regards the rest, I could tell them who the real
thief is, but there are certain difficulties. One is that the real thief is a very good
friend of mine. The other is that the receiver of stolen goods, who is a pretty poor
specimen, is closely related to a very nice person who would be very much upset if all
of this were to come into the open. It looks as if I shall have to ask Master Bao to take
responsibility for the whole lot, so that everyone is clear of suspicion. Before I do
that, however, there’s something I should like to be clear about first. Can I be sure, if I
do ask him to do us this favour, that everyone is going to be a bit more careful in
future? Because if not, then rather than stand by and see an innocent person suffer, I
shall have to tell all I know to Mrs Lian.’
A blush had overspread Sunset’s face while Patience was saying this. Her natural
decency suddenly getting the better of her compelled her now to speak.
‘Don’t worry, Patience. There’s no need for any innocent person to suffer and
there’s no need for that other person you mentioned to be upset. I stole those things.
It was because Mrs Zhao kept on at me to take them. I stole them to give to Huan.
Even when Her Ladyship was here I often used to steal things for him, so that he
could give them away to his friends. I thought that the fuss made when they found
out that things were missing would die down in a day or two. I can’t stand by and let
an innocent person take the blame. You’ll have to take me with you to Mrs Lian and
let me make a clean breast of it.’
Her courage took all of them by surprise.
‘You’re a good sort, Sunset, I always knew you were,’ said Bao-yu admiringly, ‘but
there’s really no need for you to tell her. All I’ve got to do is say that I stole those
things for a lark, to give you all a scare, and that now there’s been all this fuss about
them, I feel I ought to own up. There’s only one thing, though. I really must ask you
girls to be more careful in future, for all our sakes.’
‘I did it,’ said Sunset, ‘it’s up to me to face the music.’
Patience and Aroma disagreed.
‘That’s not the way to look at it at all. If you confess, they’re sure to worm
something out about Mrs Zhao, and that will upset Miss Tan again when she gets to
hear about it. You’d much better let Master Bao accept responsibility, so that
everyone is cleared. Nobody except the few of us here knows the truth, so it’s
terribly easy for him to do this. But as Master Bao says, you really will have to be
more careful in future. If you must take anything, at least wait until Her Ladyship is
here. When she is back, you can give the whole room away if you like, because then
we shan’t be involved!’
Sunset hung her head and pondered for some moments before finally agreeing to go
along with this.
When it was settled exactly what they should do, Patience went with Parfumee and
the two maids from Lady Wang’s apartment to the watch-room, called out Fivey, and
quietly instructed her to say that the Lycoperdon Snow as well as the Essence of
Roses had been given to her by Parfumée. Fivey was deeply grateful. Patience next
took Fivey with her to Wang Xi-feng’s place, where Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and her helpers
had already been waiting for some time with Fivey’s mother in their custody.
‘I brought her here first thing,’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife told Patience in reference to her
prisoner. ‘As that left no one to get the lunch ready, I put Qin Xian’s wife temporarily
in charge, so that the young ladies should get their meal on time.’
‘Who is Qin Xian’s wife?’ said Patience. ‘I don’t think I know her.’
‘She does night duty in the south corner of the Garden. She doesn’t do anything in
the daytime: that’s probably why you don’t know her. Very high cheek-bones and big
round eyes. She’s a very clean, lively little body.’
‘Yes, of course you know her, Patience,’ said Silver. ‘She’s the auntie of Miss Ying’s
maid, Chess. Chess’s father works for Sir She, but her uncle and auntie work on this
side of the mansion with us.’
Patience remembered with a laugh.
‘Oh, that’s who you’ve chosen! If you’d told me that, I should have known who you
meant.’ She laughed again. ‘You’ve been a bit too quick with your appointment. It’s
all cleared up now, this business. The waters have gone down and we can see the
rocks. We know now who the real thief was who stole that stuff from Her Ladyship’s
room. It was Bao-yu. He went round to Her Ladyship’s apartment some days ago and
asked Silver and Sunset for something and just for a tease the silly girls said he
couldn’t have it, because they couldn’t give him anything while Her Ladyship was
away. So he simply slipped in later on when they weren’t there and helped himself.
When these two found the things missing, they were scared out of their wits. But as
soon as Bao-yu heard that someone else had been accused of taking the things, he
told me everything. He even brought them round to show me, so that I could see
they exactly corresponded with what the girls had told me was missing. As regards
the Lycoperdon Snow, that was something that Bao-yu had got from outside. He’s
been giving it away to all kinds of people - not only in the Garden: one or two of the
old nannies begged some off him to give to their relations outside and they have
given it to other people as presents; and Aroma gave some of hers to Parfumee and
that lot and they’ve been passing the stuff to and fro between them?selves. So you
see, it’s all over the place. The two baskets that were left in the jobs room the other
day for Their Ladyships are still untouched. The seals on them haven’t been broken.
So as far as that’s concerned, there are no grounds for a charge either. If you’ll wait
here a few moments longer, I’m just going in to tell Mrs Lian about this and we’ll see
what she says.’
Patience then went into the bedroom and repeated almost verbatim to Xi-feng what
she had just been telling Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife.
‘That’s as may be,’ said Xi-feng when she had finished; ‘but we all know how ready
Bao-yu is to cover up for other people. Someone only has to go to him with a
hard-luck story - especially if there’s a bit of flattery thrown in with it - and he’ll own
up to anything in order to get them off. If we believe him now, how are we going to
deal with more serious cases later on? I think this needs going into more carefully. I
think you ought to get hold of those girls from Her Ladyship’s apartment and - well, I
wouldn’t say torture them exactly, but you could get them to kneel in the sun on
broken china all day without anything to eat or drink. If one day doesn’t make them
confess, just go on day after day until they do. They’re sure to give in sooner or later,
even if they’re made of iron.’
‘And as for that Liu woman,’ she went on, ‘you know what they say. When flies
gather on an egg, it’s generally a sign that there’s a crack in it. She may not have
stolen anything in this instance, but I suspect she’s no better than she should be for
all these people to be complaining about her. We’ll let her off the flogging, of course,
but I still think we ought to dismiss her. Even in the Emperor’s court people get
punished for what they call “guilt by association”, so she can’t complain if we sack
her merely on suspicion.’
‘Yes, but why bother?’ said Patience. ‘They say that where mercy is possible, mercy
should be shown. What better opportunity than this could you have of showing
yourself merciful for once? Look at all the trouble you give your?self on account of
these people, and they aren’t even your own household: it’s Lady Xing’s household
that you really belong to. And where does it all get you, at the end of the day? All you
do is build up a lot of resentment against yourself and turn a lot of nasty, spiteful
people into your enemies. A person in your delicate health can’t afford to make
enemies. Think of all the time it took you to conceive a man-child - and then to lose it
after carrying it inside you for six or seven months! How do we know that that wasn’t
brought on by too much worrying about this sort of thing? I think you ought to start
straight away taking things a bit easier. Close your eyes to things a bit oftener. “What
the eye doesn’t see the heart doesn’t grieve”!’
Patience’s little homily quickly won Xi-feng to a better humour.
‘All right,’ she said, laughing. ‘Do as you wish. I’m not going to get myself worked up
about it.’
‘Now you’re talking sensibly,’ said Patience happily, and going out of the bedroom,
proceeded to dispose of the business outside in the way she had all along intended
to.
But more of that in the next chapter.

‘It’s the sign of a really thriving household,’ said Patience, ‘that their big troubles
turn into little ones and their little ones into nothing at all. To make a great song and
dance over a trifle like this would be plain ridiculous. You can take them both back to
the kitchen. The mother is to keep her job. Qin Xian’s wife will have to go back where
she came from. There is to be no further mention of this matter. Let there be no
slackening in the daily inspection of the Garden, though. That’s most important.’
As she turned to go, Cook Liu and her daughter stepped quickly forwards and
kotowed their thanks. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife then conducted them back to the Garden,
after which she reported to Li Wan and Tan-chun on what had been decided. Both
expressed satisfaction that the matter had resolved itself without further trouble.
The victory that had been gained by Chess and her faction was thus an empty one,
and Qin Xian’s wife, that aunt of Chess’s whose installation in the kitchen had been
the result of long and patient scheming, enjoyed only the briefest moment of
triumph in her new position. Beginning in a great bustle with a general stock-taking
of the kitchen’s equipment and stores, she detected - or claimed to detect - various
shortages in the latter. Two piculs of best rice were missing, she said; a month’s
supply of general purpose rice had been overdrawn; and the amount of charcoal was
not what it was supposed to be. While so engaged, she was at the same time making
discreet arrangements for the conveyance of various ‘presents’ (they included, by a
strange coincidence, a pannier of charcoal and a load of rice) to Lin Zhi-xiao’s
quarters outside; and there were to be presents for the clerks who worked in
Accounts. She also prepared several dishes for a little repast to which she invited her
new colleagues.
‘Now that I’ve got this job, I rely entirely on your support to run things here,’ she
told them. ‘So if there are any little matters that I fall down in, I shall look to you all
to help me out.’
Suddenly, in the midst of this activity, new orders arrived:
‘As soon as you have finished serving this lunch, you must leave. Liu has been
cleared. They’re putting her back in charge here.’
Stunned though she was by this news, the wretched woman had at once to begin
packing her things, and soon, with drums muffled and colours furled, beat a hasty
retreat from the kitchen. The things she had given away to others - pointlessly, it now
appeared - had to be made good, in some cases by selling her own possessions. Even
Chess, for all her fury, was powerless to help her.
Ever since the fuss made by Silver about the missing objects, Aunt Zhao, the secret
recipient of many of the things which Sunset had stolen, had been living in fear of
discovery. Each day, as she made her surreptitious inquiries about the current
progress of investigations, she perspired afresh. When Sunset herself suddenly came
in and announced that Bao-yu had owned up and that there was nothing more to
fear, she was naturally very much relieved. The effect on Jia Huan, however, was
somewhat different. He immediately became suspicious, and taking out all the things
that Sunset had been at such pains to get for him, he threw them in her face.
‘Two-faced thing!’ he shouted. ‘You must be thick with Bao-yu or he wouldn’t have
covered up for you. If you were prepared to take those things in the first place, you
ought to have kept quiet about it and not told anyone. Now that you’ve told him, I
don’t want them any more. They would only remind me of your treachery.’
Sunset swore by the most desperate oaths that she had been faithful to him; she
even wept; but Jia Huan was adamant.
‘If it weren’t that we used to be friends,’ he said, ‘I’d go straight along now to Aunt
Lian and tell her that you stole those things. I’d tell her that you offered them to me,
but I wouldn’t take them. Think about that then, and consider yourself lucky to have
got away with it!’
With those words he flounced out of the room, to the great indignation of his mother,
who shouted after him angrily.
‘Ungrateful little blackguard! What do you mean by it?’
Sunset meanwhile was weeping as if her heart would break.
‘Poor child!’ said Aunt Zhao, trying to comfort her. ‘He doesn’t appreciate you. But
at least I know you are faithful to him. Let me look after these things for you. He’s
sure to come round to a more sensible way of thinking in a day or two.’
She would have taken them, but Sunset forestalled her, sweeping them angrily into a
bundle, which, when no one was looking, she carried into the Garden and emptied
out over the lake. Some of the things sank straight to the bottom, the rest floated
about on the surface of the water. She was still angry when she went to bed, and
cried all night long under the bed-clothes.
*
The day of Bao-yu’s birthday arrived - the same day, it had been discovered, as that
on which Bao-qin had hers. Because Lady Wang was away, rather less fuss was made
of it than in previous years. There were the customary four kinds of birthday present
from Abbot Zhang together with a new amulet to replace the one he had worn
during the previous year, and from the monks and nuns of various temples a token
share of the day’s offerings accompanied by such other little gifts as the religious are
wont to give on these occasions: little figures of Old Longevity, sacred colour-prints,
offertory scrolls, talismans inscribed with his personal star guardian, and annually
renewable lockets inscribed with the current year-star. A number of the blind
ballad-singers both male and female regularly patronized by the household called in
to offer their colourful felicitations. His uncle Wang Zi-teng’s family sent him the
usual suit of clothes and two pairs of shoes and socks, together with a hundred little
peach-shaped birthday cakes and a hundred little bundles of the finest ‘silver thread’
vermicelli. From his Aunt Xue he received ex?actly the same presents as from his
uncle but in appropriately reduced amounts. The only other presents from senior
members of the family were a pair of shoes from You-shi and a heavily-embroidered
‘propitious encounter’ purse with a tiny gold image of Old Longevity in it and a piece
of Persian ware from Xi-feng. As in previous years, a distribution of alms was made
on his behalf to the monks of various temples.
And then of course there were Bao-qin’s presents; but to enumerate them as well
would be tedious.
The presents which Bao-yu received from the girls were of a less formal nature and
chosen more to mark the occasion than for their intrinsic value: a fan from one, a
specimen of calli?graphy from another, a painting or a poem.
On the morning of his birthday Bao-yu rose at dawn, and after completing his toilet,
put on his most formal clothes and went out to the main front courtyard of the
mansion, where Li Gui and three other of his grooms were waiting for him by a table
they had’ made ready with an incense burner and candlesticks and offerings as an
altar to Heaven and Earth. Bao-yu lit some sticks of incense and made his
prostrations, poured out a libation of tea, and burned the paper offerings and
offertory scrolls. Then he went round to the Ning-guo mansion and kotowed his
respects to the ancestors, first in the shrine and then in the hall. Emerging from the
latter, he knelt down on the terrace outside and ‘kotowed upwards’ to his absent
dear ones - Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng and Lady Wang - rising on his knees after
each prostration and lifting his clasped hands up in front of him. He called in at the
main apartment on his way out and made his kotow to You-shi, after which he sat
and talked to her for a bit before returning to Rong-guo House. His first visit there
was to Aunt Xue, who made vigorous - though, of course, unsuccessful at?tempts to
prevent his kotowing to her. After that he called on Xue Ke, who was slightly senior to
Bao-yu but not enough to warrant an obeisance and whose efforts to prevent a
kotow, therefore, were more successful. After exchanging a few words with Xue Ke,
he went back into the Garden. There he found Skybright and Musk waiting for him.
They were accompanied by two junior maids holding a red carpet which was
intended for kneeling on. Attended by these four, he now proceeded to visit all those
in the Garden beginning with Li Wan who were senior to himself. Then back to the
mansion again and out through the inner gate to call on Nannie Li and three other of
his former nannies, with each of whom he was expected to spend some time in
conversation. On his way back the servants inside the Garden gate would have liked
to kotow to him, but he would not let them; and when he was once more back in his
room, Aroma and the other maids offered him only verbal greetings and did not
attempt to kneel. Lady Wang had forbidden the maids to kotow to younger members
of the family for fear it might shorten their lives.
Soon after this Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived. Aroma prevented them from kneeling
and made them sit down for a while. As soon as they had gone, Bao-yu declared
himself tired out by all the walking he had done and put his feet up on the bed. But
not for long. He had barely had time to drink half a cupful of tea when there was a
confused sound of chatter?ing and giggling outside and eight or nine maids burst
laugh?ing into the room. There was Ebony and Periwinkle and Kingfisher and Picture,
Xing Xiu-yan’s maid Signet, the nursemaid carrying Xi-feng’s little girl Qiao-jie, and
two of the maids from Lady Wang’s room, Avis and Avocet. He noticed that they
were carrying a red carpet between them.
‘Where are the birthday noodles?’ they said. ‘See how your doorway is crowded
with people who have come to wish you happy returns!’
No sooner were the maids inside than Tan-chun, Xiang-yun, Ba-qin, Xiu-yan and
Xi-chun appeared behind them. Bao-yu hurried out to greet them. ‘How kind of you
all to come!’ he said, and as he ushered them inside, he called out to Aroma to get
them all some tea. A great deal of polite tussling ensued before his guests could
finally be persuaded to sit down. Aroma now brought in tea for them all on a tray;
but they had taken no more than a sip of it when Patience arrived, dressed to the
nines in all her finery, and Bao-yu had to get up once more and hurry out to greet
her.
‘When I went to Feng’s place just now,’ he said, ‘the person who announced me
told me that she couldn’t see me, so I asked if I might see you instead. Why wouldn’t
you let me?’
‘The first time you sent in I couldn’t come out because I was doing your Cousin
Feng’s hair,’ said Patience. ‘When you sent in the second time and said that you
wanted me to receive you in her place, I naturally couldn’t let you because it would
have been too great an honour. It is I who should kotow to you -which is what I have
come to do now.’
‘But that’s too great an honour for me!’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
Aroma nevertheless brought a chair over and made Bao-yu sit in it. Patience made
him a curtsey. Bao-yu, already on his feet again, answered it with a bow and pumped
his hands. Patience went down on her knees. Bao-yu knelt down too. At once Aroma
raised Patience to her feet, whereupon she curtseyed to Bao-yu once more and
Bao-yu, who had got up when she did, answered her with another bow and another
pumping of the hands.
‘Now another one,’ said Aroma smiling and giving him a nudge.
‘Why?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ve finished.’
‘She’s finished making her birthday reverence to you,’ said Aroma; ‘but it’s her
birthday today too, so you still have to make yours to her.’
Bao-yu bowed again, delightedly.
‘So it’s your birthday too, Patience?’
Patience returned his bow with another curtsey.
Xiang-yun took hold of Bao-qin with one hand and Xiu-yan with the other.
‘At this rate the four of you are going to be making rever?ences to each other all
day long!’
‘Oh, of course!’ said Tan-chun. ‘It’s Cousin Xing’s birth?day as well. I’d quite
forgotten.’
She turned to one of the maids:
‘Go and tell Mrs Lian about this; and get them to send another lot of presents like
the ones they did for Miss Qin to Miss Ying’s apartment.’
The maid went off to do her bidding. Now that the fact that today was her birthday
had become public knowledge, Xiu-yan was obliged to make a round of the
apartments, bowing and kotowing to everybody, as Bao-yu had had to do before her.
‘Interesting, all these coincidences,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You expect a few birthdays
every month; but it’s only when you get a lot of people living together like us that
you begin getting two or three of them on the same day. We even have a birthday on
New Year’s Day in this family: Yuan-chun’s. She comes first in that as in everything
else. I suppose that’s what makes her so lucky. It was great-grandfather’s birthday as
well, New Year’s Day. The fifteenth of the first month is Aunt Xing’s birthday and also
Cousin Chai’s - another coincidence. The first of the third month is Mother’s birthday.
The ninth of the third is Cousin Lian’s. We haven’t got anyone with a birthday in the
second month.’
   ‘Yes you have,’ said Aroma. ‘Miss Lin’s is in the second month, on the
twenty-second. It’s true there’s no one of your surname, though.’
‘My memory is hopeless!’ said Tan-chun.
‘Not at all,’ said Bao-yu. He pointed smilingly at Aroma: ‘She only remembers it
because her own birthday is on that day.’
      ‘Oh, you’re on the same day as her, are you? I don’t recollect your ever having
come round and kotowed to me on that day,’ said Tan-chun teasingly. ‘And Patience:
this is the first time I’ve heard that your birthday was today.’
      ‘What sort of great ladies do you think we are to be bothering with birthdays?’
said Patience. ‘Kotows and birthday presents are not for the likes of us. My birthday
is just another day, to be got through with as little fuss as possible. I don’t suppose
you’d ever have known about it at all if she hadn’t let on. Now that you do know, I’ll
gladly come round and kotow to you when you get back later to your room.’
      ‘I don’t in the least want you to do that,’ said Tan-chun. ‘On the other hand, I
should very much like us to celebrate your birthday for once. In fact, I shan’t be
content unless we do.’
      ‘Hear, hear!’ said Bao-yu and Xiang-yun.
Tan-chun gave instructions to one of the maids:
      ‘Go to Mrs Lian and tell her, from us all, that we want to keep Patience with us
for the day. Tell her we are going to pool together and celebrate her birthday.’
The maid went off, laughing excitedly. It was some time before she returned with
Xi-feng’s answer.
‘Mrs Lian says thank you very much for the honour you are doing her. She says she
doesn’t know what you will be giving Patience to eat, but provided you let her have
some of it, she will agree to leave her here in peace.’
The cousins and maids all laughed when they heard this message.
‘It so happens that, as the birthday noodles and all the other things needed for
today’s meals are being seen to by the big kitchen outside, the Garden kitchen has
got nothing to do today,’ said Tan-chun. ‘So when we’ve made our collection, we can
give it to Cook Liu and get her to prepare this private party for us in the Garden
kitchen.’
The others having readily agreed that this would be best, Tan-chun sent someone to
tell Li Wan, Bao-chai and Dai-yu what had been decided and invite them to
contribute. She also sent for Cook Liu and asked her to prepare a two-table banquet
in the Garden kitchen. Somewhat puzzled by this request, Cook Liu pointed out that
on this particular occasion the catering was all being done in the outside kitchen.
‘Yes,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but this is only for us. Today is Patience’s birthday and we
want to pool together and have a special little party for her. So do something nice for
us, will you? You can bring the bill to my place afterwards and I will give you the
money.’
‘Miss Patience’s birthday today?’ said Cook Liu. ‘Well I never!’ And she stepped
briskly forward and made her a kotow. Patience bent over in confusion and raised her
to her feet.
The cook hurried off to begin preparations. Tan-chun now invited Bao-yu to
accompany her to the ‘jobs room’ and break his fast there with some noodles.
Hav?ing first waited for Li Wan and Bao-chai to arrive, she sent someone to ask if
Aunt Xue and Dai-yu would care to join them. Now that the weather was warmer,
Dai-yu’s illness was very much better than it had been and she was able to come.
With so many people in party dresses the crowded office was beginning to take on
an unusually gay and festive appearance. Unfortunately a formal present for Bao-yu -
a handkerchief, a fan, some sticks of incense and a length of silk - arrived at that
moment from Xue Ke, and Bao-yu had to abandon the female company of the office
and go to take noodles with Xue Ke.
Since the Xue and Jia families each had a birthday on this same day, each was
supposed to entertain the other with birthday wine. Accordingly, at about noon that
day, Bao-qin was brought over by Bao-chai to make a birthday reverence to her elder
brother and to wait on him and Bao-yu while they drank the wine. But Bao-chai was
impatient of punctilio.
‘There is no need for you to send our wine over there,’ she told Xue Ke. ‘This year
at least we can dispense with those empty formalities. You can invite our employees
from the shop in to help you finish it. Cousin Bao and I must go back to the Garden
now. Excuse us for leaving you like this, but we have other people there waiting for
us to entertain them.’
‘I won’t try to detain you then,’ said Xue Ke politely. ‘To tell the truth, our people
from the shop will feel freer to call here when you are gone.’
Having apologized to Xue Ke on his own account, Bao-yu accompanied the two girls
back into the Garden. As they passed into it through the corner gate, Bao-chai made
the women there lock it up after them and hand her the key.
‘Why is it necessary to lock this gate?’ Bao-yu asked her. ‘There are only a few
people using it, and now that you and Aunt and Qin are all three living in the Garden,
it must be an awful nuisance if you have to lock and unlock it every time you need to
go and fetch something from your place outside.’
‘One can’t be too careful,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Look at all the incidents you people have
been having during the past few days; yet not once have any of our people been
implicated. I put that down entirely to the fact that this gate is kept constantly locked.
If it were left open, other people besides us would want to use it for the convenience
of taking short cuts; and as it would be too invidious to begin distinguishing between
who might use the gate and who might not, it is better to keep it permanently locked
and stop everyone using it, even though it means a certain amount of inconvenience
for Mamma and me, because at least it ensures that when there is any trouble none
of out people will be under suspicion.’
‘You heard about the missing objects, then?’ Bao-yu asked her.
‘You mean the Essence of Roses and Lycoperdon Snow?’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t
suppose you would have known even about them if your own protege’s had not been
involved. No, I was thinking about something rather more serious than that
-something which, for all our sakes, I hope will never come to light. If it does, a great
many people will be implicated. I can tell you this, because you have nothing to do
with the management of the household. I told Patience the other day too. Patience is
an intelligent girl, and as her mistress cannot get about now, I thought she ought to
know about it. As I say, I hope nothing will come of it; but if it does blow up, Patience
will have been warned and will know how to safeguard herself against being
wrongfully accused again. Bear in mind what I am saying so that you are warned, too,
if anything should happen. But don’t let anyone else know that I told you this.’
They had been approaching Drenched Blossoms while she was speaking. In the
pavilion at the centre of the bridge a group of ten or so girls - Aroma, Caltrop, Scribe,
Skybright, Musk, Parfumée, étamine, Nénuphar and one or two others they could
not identify - were leaning over the railings looking at the fish in the water below. As
Bao-yu and his two cousins approached, they chorused out to them:
‘The party’s all ready in the Peony Garden. Hurry up and take your places!’
Taking the maids with them, the cousins made their way to the lakeside Peony
Garden in the midst of which was the large, open summerhouse where the tables for
the party had been laid. Even You-shi had been invited and was already sitting there
waiting for them. In fact, by now almost every?one had arrived except Patience
herself.
Patience had intended to drop in only briefly at Xi-feng’s house in order to change
into something more suitable for the party; but no sooner had she reached it than
presents began arriving from the Lin and Lai households. The bearers of these proved
to be only the forerunners of a stream of callers from every level of the domestic staff,
who arrived in twos and threes, bringing her gifts or offering their congratulations.
Patience was kept continuously busy dealing with these callers, rewarding the
deliverers of gifts, thanking those who had come in person to felicitate her, and
running in and out to show her presents to Xi-feng. She kept only a few of these for
herself; the rest she either courteously returned or immediately gave away. Even
when she had finished with her visitors she had to serve Xi-feng her lunch of noodles
and wait until she had finished it before she was at last able to get changed and hurry
back into the Garden.
A number of maids who had been sent out by the others to look for her took charge
of her as she entered it and carried her off to the summerhouse. It was a dazzling
sight there that met her eyes: not perhaps the
chelonian tables, lotus-cushioned chairs
of the poet; but no effort had been spared to make it an eye-catching and appetizing
spread.
A friendly laugh greeted her arrival.
‘Now all the birthday folk are here!’
They wanted to make her and the other three – Bao-yu, Bao-qin and Xiu-yan - sit at
the head of the feast, but as Aunt Xue was present, all four of them naturally refused.
‘A slow old buffer like me is no fit company for you young people,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I
should only feel uncomfortable if I stayed. Let me go and lie down in the jobs room. I
don’t feel like eating anything and I’m not much of a drinker. You will be much better
able to look after your guests if I am not here.’
You-shi and the others loudly insisted that she should stay. Only Bao-chai dissented.
‘Whether or not we should get on better without Mamma,’ she said, ‘I’m sure
Mamma herself would be happier lying down in the jobs room than sitting here with
us. If there is anything here she fancies, we can have it sent over to her and she will
be able to eat it there on her own in comfort. Besides, there is no one in charge there
at the moment. If Mamma is there, she will be able to keep an eye on things.’
     ‘Oh well, in that case we’ll let her go,’ said Tan-chun smiling. ‘Obedience is the
best obeisance, as they say.’
     She went with the others to escort her aunt to the jobs room and personally
supervised the arrangement of various pillows and cushions by the junior maids.
     ‘Now,’ she said to these junior maids when Aunt Xue had been comfortably
settled, ‘if you will stay here and massage Mrs Xue’s legs for her and fetch her tea or
anything when she asks you without making up all sorts of wonderful excuses, I
shouldn’t be surprised if later on, when we send some nice things for her to eat, she
doesn’t give some of them to you. So mind you don’t go away!’
     The girls all promised that they would stay.
     When they got back, Tan-chun made Bao-qin and Xiu-yan sit at the head of the
top table and Patience and Bao-yu at right-angles to them on the left and right ends.
She and Faith?ful sat shoulder to shoulder on the fourth side, facing Bao-qin and
Xiu-yan. At the table parallel to the west wall Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun, Ying-chun
and Xi-chun sat in order of seniority on the two longer sides and Caltrop and Silver
on the shorter sides, one at either end. You-shi and Li Wan sat at the longer sides of
the table parallel to the east wall, with Aroma and Sunset to left and right of them on
the shorter sides. The fourth table was occupied by the remaining maids, Nightingale,
Oriole, Skybright, Periwinkle and Chess, sitting around it in no particular order.
      No sooner were they all seated than Tan-chun rose to her feet again, wine-kettle
in hand, intending to drink toasts with each of the four ‘birthday people’; but the
birthday four, realizing that if they allowed one of their hosts to do this, a dozen or
more would follow, objected strenuously.
      ‘If you are going to start this nonsense,’ said Bao-qin, ‘we shall none of us get
settled until evening.’
      The point was taken and Tan-chun sat down again, where?upon the blind
ballad-singers, who had tagged along with the others, began tuning their instruments
for a birthday ode. This time everyone objected.
      ‘None of us like that old stuff. Why don’t you go to the jobs room and entertain
Mrs Xue?’
While they were about it, they made a selection from the various dishes on the table
for the people conducting the blind women to take with them to Aunt Xue.
‘Just sitting here making polite conversation is not going to be much fun,’ said
Bao-yu when the singers had been disposed of. ‘We ought to play a drinking game.’
Various suggestions were made, but none met with everyone’s approval.
‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Why not write the names of different games down
on slips of paper and put it to the draw?’
‘Good idea!’ said the others, and sent for an inkstone and writing-brush and some
slips of fancy paper.
To Caltrop, who in addition to writing poetry had lately been learning some
calligraphy, the opportunity of exercising her new skill proved irresistible and she
jumped up and insisted on doing the writing. After thinking for a bit, the com?pany
managed to produce some ten or more names of drink?ing games which Tan-chun
dictated one by one to Caltrop to write down on the slips. The slips were then folded
up small, doubled over, and thrown into a jar. Tan-chun asked Patience to draw. She
did so with a pair of chopsticks, stirring the slips around with them before fishing one
out for her inspection. Tan-chun unrolled it and read it out.
‘Cover-ups.’
‘Cover-ups?’ said Bao-chai, laughing. ‘Why, that’s the grandfather of them all! They
played “cover-ups” in ancient times. Admittedly, we don’t know exactly how they
played it then and our modern “cover-ups” is a comparatively recent invention; but
it’s still very, very difficult. I should think at least half the people here wouldn’t know
how to play it. We’d much better set that one aside and pick something a little less
literary that everyone can understand.’
‘We can’t set it aside now that it’s been drawn,’ said Tan?-chun. ‘I suggest that we
draw again, and if it’s the sort of game that everyone can enjoy, those who want to
can play that game while the rest of us are playing cover-ups.’
This time she got Aroma to draw. The name on the slip she picked out was
‘guess-fingers’. Xiang-yun greeted it with approval.
‘Now there’s a nice, simple, lively game! There’s a game that suits me down to the
ground! None of your stuffy old cover-ups for me! The very thought of it gives me a
headache! I’m for guess-fingers!’
‘Isn’t it just like her to reduce the entire party to anarchy before we have even
begun!’ said Tan-chun. ‘Cousin Chai, you must sconce her for me.’
Bao-chai forthwith obliged by forcing a whole cupful of wine down Xiang-yun’s
throat.
‘Now,’. said Tan-chun, herself gulping down a little wine, ‘I’m your M.C. I take it you
don’t need me to read the rules out. You just have to do as I tell you. We’ll get
someone to fetch dice and a cup and each of us will throw in turn, beginning with
Cousin Qin. Anyone who throws the same number as someone else will pair with
that person for cover-ups.’
Bao-qin threw a three. The others on the top table each threw a different number.
Caltrop on the second table was the first to throw another three.
‘We’d better confine ourselves to objects inside this room, don’t you think?’
Bao-qin suggested. ‘Otherwise the range of possibilities will be too large.’
‘Certainly,’ said Tan-chun. ‘And whoever hasn’t given the right answer after three
guesses must drink a cup of wine as a penalty. You begin.’
Bao-qin thought for a bit.
‘Market.’
Caltrop, who was new to this game, could see nothing in the room which could
combine with ‘market’ to make a quota?tion; but Xiang-yun, whose eyes had been
darting busily around from the moment the clue was announced, happened
suddenly to catch sight of the inscription that hung up over the door:
PEONY GARDEN
She guessed at once that Bao-qin must be thinking of the passage in the thirteenth
book of the Analects where Confucius tells a person who wanted to study
horticulture that he would ‘much better go to some old fellow who kept a market
garden and learn about it from him’. As Caltrop could still not guess what the
‘market’ indicated and the others were beginning to drum her for an answer,
Xiang-yun, who had already thought of a matching quotation from a line in one of
Wang Wei’s poems
Sometimes I to my herb garden repair
leaned over and whispered to Caltrop to give ‘herb’ as her reply. But Dai-yu had
spotted her and was quick to tell the others.
‘You’ll have to sconce her again. She’s been telling her how to answer.’
Xiang-yun was obliged to down another cupful of wine. She was so vexed that she
rapped Dai-yu on the knuckles with a chopstick. Caltrop, too had to drink a sconce.
The next pairing occurred when Bao-chai threw the same number as Tan-chun.
Tan-chun’s clue was ‘man’.
‘Isn’t that a bit wide?’ said Bao-chai.
‘All right,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I’ll give you another clue. That should narrow it down a
bit. “Shut”.’
Bao-chai thought for some moments. There was certainly plenty of chicken-meat on
the table. Tan-chun must be referring to ‘cock-man’ from Wang Wei’s
The red-capped cock-man has proclaimed the dawn
and ‘cock-shut’ from Luo Yin’s
At cock-shut still upon my book to pore.
She therefore countered with ‘niche’, basing herself on a line from the sixty-third
poem in the Poetry Classic:
The cock roosts in his niche.
The two girls smiled at each other and each took a sip of wine in celebration of a
successful turn.
      Xiang-yun, unwilling to wait longer, was already in the midst of a game of
guess-fingers with Bao-yu. The two of them were both shouting at the tops of their
voices. At the other side of the room You-shi and Faithful were also shouting at each
other ‘Five-a, five-a!’ ‘Seven-a, seven-a!’ ‘Eight-a, eight-a!’ from their separate tables,
while Patience and Aroma, sitting at adjacent ends of the same two tables, made up
another pair and contributed to the noise. To the racket made by their shouting was
added, in the case of the five female players, the clashing of bracelets every time
they gestured. Soon Xiang-?yun had beaten Bao-yu and Aroma had beaten Patience.
It was agreed that the losers should drink a cup of wine each and do something
before and something after drinking it: the question was, what? Xiang-yun had plenty
of suggestions for Bac-yu.
‘Before drinking you must give a well-known quotation in prose, a well-known
quotation in verse, a dominoes three?some, a song-title, and the day’s forecast from
an almanac, all five to hang together so that they make continuous sense. After
drinking you must give the name of some food you see here on the table which can
be used in more than one sense.’
The others laughed.
‘No one but her could think up such a rigmarole,’ they said. ‘Still, it should be
interesting.’
They began urging Bao-yu to start.
‘Have a heart!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I need a bit of time to think if I’m to get through that
lot.’
‘Drink the wine,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll do the rest for you.’
Bao-yu drank his cup obediently and listened.
‘One. “Scudding clouds race the startled mallard across the water”,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Two. “A wild goose passes, lamenting, across the wind-swept sky.” Three. It must be
“The wild goose with a broken wing”. Four. So sad a sound makes “The Heart
Tormented”. Five. “The cry of the wild goose is heard in the land.”’
The others laughed:
‘It certainly makes good sense!’
    Dai-yu picked up a hazel-nut.
‘This cob I take up from the table
Came from a tree, not from a stable.’

The other losers, Faithful and Aroma, were let off more lightly, being required to
produce only a single well-known saying which had some bearing on birthdays. In the
interest of economy their answers are omitted from this narrative.
A brief interlude of confusion followed while the next round of pairings was being
decided. It was resolved that Xiang-yun should play Bao-qin now at guess-fingers and
Li Wan, who had just thrown the same number as Xiu-yan, should play Xiu-yan at
cover-ups. Li Wan was to begin.
‘Gourd,’ said Li Wan.
   ‘Green,’ said Xiu-yan.
‘Green’ was evidently correct, since Li Wan appeared to be satisfied and the two
young women simultaneously sipped their wine.
Meanwhile Xiang-yun had lost to Bao-qin at guess-fingers and was asking what she
should do for a forfeit.
‘You know what Lai Jun-chen said when he showed Zhou Xing the fiery furnace that
Zhou Xing himself had designed,’ said Bao-qin: ‘“Please step inside!” I think that’s
what I should say to you now. Why don’t you do the forfeit that you designed for
Bao-yu?’

The others apart from Xiang-yun appreciated the aptness of the historical allusion.
Xiang-yun began answering without delay.
‘One. “A swift-rushing swirl and shock”. Two. “The sky rocks and heaves in the
river’s swelling waters”. Three. Better have “The lone boat tied with an iron chain”.
Four. And since there is a “Storm on the River”. Five. “This will be a bad day for
travelling.”’
By the time she had finished, the rest of the company were all laughing.
‘That sounded a bit contrived!’ they said. ‘She must have thought the forfeit up for
the express purpose of getting in her joke. - Come on!’ they said to Xiang-yun. ‘Let’s
have the second half.’
From the dish in front of her Xiang-yun picked out a duck’s head with her chopsticks
and pointed it at the maids who were sitting round the fourth table at the other end
of the room.
‘This little duck can’t with those little ducks compare:
This one is quite bald, but they all have a fine head of hair.’
There was even more laughter at this, but the maids pretended to take offence and
Skybright and Periwinkle came over to her table to protest.
‘It’s all very well for Miss Yun to have her joke, but she ought to leave us out of it.
You ought to make her drink another sconce now, as a punishment. And while she’s
about it, she might give us a nice bottle of hair-oil each by way of compensation.’
I dare say she would be glad to,’ said Dai-yu drily. ‘The trouble is that if she starts
giving bottles of hair-oil away, she will probably find herself on the carpet for stealing
them.’
The remark passed unnoticed, with two exceptions. The exceptions were Bao-yu,
who, assuming that it must refer to his supposed theft of the Essence of Roses, held
his head down and said nothing, and Sunset, the real thief, whose face turned red
with embarrassment. Bao-chai stared at Dai-yu reprovingly, whereupon Dai-yu, who
had intended no more than a mild joke at Bao-yu’s expense, realized too late that
Sunset must inevitably have construed it as a spiteful reminder of her guilt. She
attempted to distract attention from it by applying herself, with somewhat unnatural
vigour, to the game of guess-fingers.
The next pairing to be determined by the dice was that of Bao-chai and Bao-yu. The
clue Bao-chai gave Bao-yu for her cover-up was ‘precious’. After puzzling over it for
some moments, Bao-yu felt sure that it was a leg-pull. His own name meant ‘Precious
Jade’. No doubt the object she had in mind was the jade he always wore round his
neck and she was using his own name for her clue. Very well, he would answer her in
kind.
‘I take it that you are making free with my name,’ he said. ‘I hope that you won’t be
offended then if I make just as free with yours. “Bao-chai” means “Precious Hairpin”,
so I shall borrow your “hairpin” for my answer. “Jade hairpin” comes in a line by
some Tang poet:
The candle burnt out and the jade hairpin broken.
It is “jade”, isn’t it, in your cover-up?’
‘I protest,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘“Precious jade” isn’t a quota?tion. You’re supposed to
use only quotations in this game. We ought to sconce them both.’
“‘Precious jade” does come from a quotation,’ said Caltrop.
‘Surely not?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I’m prepared to admit you might find it on a New Year
scroll or something of that sort, but not in any work of literature, surely?’
‘I came across “precious jade” only the other day in a poem by Cen Shen,’ said
Caltrop:
‘Since in that land much precious jade is found.
I’m surprised you don’t remember it. And not long after?wards I came across
“precious hairpin” in a poem too- a poem by Li Shang-yin:
The precious hairpin gathers dust.
I remember being very much amused at the time to think that Master Bao’s and Miss
Bao’s names are both to be found in poems of the Tang dynasty.’
‘So much for your objection!’ said the others to Xiang-yun, laughing. ‘It’s you who
must drink the sconce.’
It was useless to argue: Xiang-yun had to drink another cupful.
The whole company now paired off for guess-fingers. With Grandmother Jia and Lady
Wang away, the girls felt free to make as much noise as they liked. Coloured sleeves
flashed, bracelets jangled, earrings shook, hair ornaments nodded in time to the
shrieked-out numbers. In such a bedlam almost anything would have passed
unnoticed; and it was only when they had tired of playing and broken off for a rest
that they suddenly became aware that Xiang-yun was no longer with them. At first
they assumed that she must have slipped out to answer a call of nature; but when,
after they had waited for quite some time, she had still not reappeared, they sent
some of the maids out to look for her. The search proved fruitless. Xiang-yun had
vanished without a trace.
At this point Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife arrived, accompanied by several of the old women
under her command. She had come partly out of a genuine desire to be useful but
much more because she regarded the maids as young and giddy creatures who
would take advantage of Lady Wang’s absence to play their young mistresses up by
drinking more than was good for them and behaving riotously. Tan-chun was fully
aware of this and let her know that she was.
‘I see you still don’t trust us, Mrs Lin. I assure you, though, that we haven’t been
drinking very much. We’re only enjoying ourselves: the wine has been a very small
part of it. You really have no cause to be worried.’
Li Wan and You-shi added their reassurances.
‘Go and rest, Lin. We wouldn’t let them drink too much, I promise you.’
The women laughed.
‘I know you wouldn’t,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘Even when Her Old Ladyship
encourages them to, the young ladies don’t drink very much, so I know they’d be
even less inclined to overdo it when Their Ladyships are away. It wasn’t because of
that I came; it was just that I thought there might be something you needed me for.
Also, as it’s a long way yet to dinner-time and you’ve been at it quite a long while
now, I thought it was time you had a bite of something. I know you don’t normally go
in much for snacks between meals, but when you’ve been drinking, you really need
to get a bit of food inside you so that it does you no harm.’
‘You are quite right,’ said Tan-chun. ‘In fact, we were just thinking of having
something when you came.’
She turned to the maids behind her and told them to fetch some light refreshments
from the kitchen. There was an answering cry from all sides and a few of them went
off to do her bidding.
Tan-chun smiled courteously at the women.
‘Do please go and rest now. Or perhaps you would like to go and keep Mrs Xue
company? We’ll send some wine there presently for you to drink.’
‘Oh no, miss, we wouldn’t presume!’
She and the women stood talking a little longer before finally taking themselves off.
Patience put her hand to her cheek and laughed.
‘My face is so hot, it must be terribly red. I wish they hadn’t seen me like this. I
think we ought to stop now. If we give them an excuse for coming back again it will
be really em?barrassing.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Tan-chun. ‘As long as we don’t do any serious drinking, it’s
perfectly all right.’
‘Come and look, everyone!’ - They were interrupted by a giggling young maid -
‘Miss Yun must have been feeling drunk and gone out for some air. She’s lying on the
granite bench behind the rockery, fast asleep.’
‘Let’s be quiet and not waken her,’ the others said amidst laughter, and followed
her outside to have a look.
They found Xiang-yun where the maid had said, on a large stone bench in a hidden
corner of the rockery, dead to the world. She was covered all over from head to foot
with crimson petals from the peony bushes which grew round about; the fan which
had slipped from her hand and lay on the ground beside her was half buried in petals;
and heaped-up peony petals wrapped in a white silk handkerchief made an
improvised pillow for her head. Over and around this petalled monstro?sity a
convocation of bees and butterflies was hovering distrac?tedly. It was a sight that the
cousins found both touching and comical. They made haste to rouse her and lifted
her up into a half-sitting position on the bench. But Xiang-yun was still playing
drinking games in her sleep and proceeded to recite the words of an imaginary forfeit,
though her eyes were tightly closed.
‘One. “The spring water being sweet, the wine is good.” Two. “Pour me its liquid
amber in a jade cup.” Three. We’ll drink till we see “The moon above the plum-tree
bough”. Four. Then, as we’re “Rolling Home”. Five. It will be “A good time to meet a
friend.”’
They shook her, laughing.
‘Wake up! Wake up! Come and have something to eat. Lying on the damp stone like
this you’ll make yourself ill.’
Xiang-yun...
uplifted slowly then those orbs serene
and saw the faces of the cousins bending over her. Then she looked downwards and
saw her own body and the place where she had been lying. She could remember
escaping from the noise to rest for a few moments somewhere where it was cool and
quiet. Evidently the wine from all those sconces she had been made to drink must
have got the better of her and caused her to drop off. Ashamed to have been
discovered in such a predicament, she struggled hastily to her feet and accompanied
the others back to the summerhouse, where she rinsed her mouth out with water
and drank two very strong cups of tea. Tan-chun made one of the girls fetch a piece
of ‘hangover rock’ for her to suck. By the time she had sucked the rock for a bit and
taken a few mouthfuls of hot, sour soup, she was feeling almost herself again.
A selection was now made of the various comestibles on the tables and sent over to
Xi-feng, who reciprocated by sending them some delicacies of her own. Bao-yu and
the girls then took some sustenance themselves, after which they broke up into little
groups, standing or sitting where they pleased and amusing themselves as the fancy
took them. Some went out?side to admire the peonies or to lean on the balustrade
at the edge of the lake and look at the fish swimming in the water below. Tan-chun
and Bao-qin stayed indoors to play Go. Bao-chai and Xiang-yun stayed indoors to
watch them. Dai-yu and Bao-yu went outside and, having found themselves a little
flowering arbour that they could stand and talk in, appeared to be completely
engrossed in their conversation.
While everyone was thus engaged, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and her party appeared once
more, bringing with them a tearful, woebegone woman, who, as they reached the
steps that led up to the summer-house, threw herself down on her knees, not daring
to go further, and began knocking her head upon the ground. Meanwhile Tan-chun
continued to stare concentratedly at the Go-board, one outstretched hand feeling for
the spare pieces in the box while she contemplated her next move. One of her pieces
had been threatened, and though she could see how to get the two ‘eyes’ easily
enough, she could not, however hard she tried, think of a way of doing so which did
not break the development she had planned. It was some minutes before she looked
up and, in turning to ask for some tea, caught sight of Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, who had all
this time been standing there beside her, and asked her what she had come for.
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife pointed to the kneeling woman.
‘This is the mother of Miss Xi-chun’s maid, Landscape. She works in the Garden.
She’s been using some very bad language. I heard her just now and asked her what
she meant by it, but what she said to me, miss - well, I wouldn’t like to soil your ears
by repeating it. I think she ought to be dismissed.’
‘Why didn’t you see Mrs Zhu about this?’ said Tan-chun.
‘I did, miss. I ran into her just now on her way to the jobs room to join Mrs Xue. She
said I was to tell you.’
‘Shouldn’t you tell Mrs Lian?’
‘No need,’ said Patience. ‘I can tell her about it when I get back.’
Tan-chun nodded.
‘All right, dismiss her then. We’ll tell Lady Wang about it when she comes back and
get her to confirm it.’
She turned once more to her game. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and her party moved off,
taking the offender with them.
All of this scene was clearly observed by Bao-yu and Dai-yu from their flowering
covert, though they were too far away to hear what was said.
‘What a curiously detached person your sister is!’ said Dai-yu. ‘She has been
actually invited to take charge of things, yet she still won’t go a step beyond what is
absolutely neces?sary. Most people in her position would have been throwing their
weight about long ago.’
‘Ah, you don’t know what’s been going on while you were away,’ said Bao-yu.
‘While you were ill in bed, she did in fact do a great deal of managing. For example,
she divided this Garden into sections and put each section under someone’s
supervision. Nowadays you can’t even pick a flower in it without permission. And she
cut down on a lot of things too- mostly things that Feng or I had asked for, as an
awful example to the others. Oh no, Tan has got very strong views on domes?tic
economy. I certainly wouldn’t call her “detached”.’
‘I’m very glad to hear it,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We are all much too extravagant. Although
the management of the household is not my business, I have frequently, just out of
curiosity, made a few calculations, and I can see that our expenditure is vastly in
excess of our income. If we go on in this way without economizing, the time will
surely come when our credit is ex?hausted.’
‘Even if it does,’ said Bao-yu gaily, ‘I don’t suppose you and I will have to go short.’
Dai-yu turned away from him somewhat impatiently and began walking towards the
summerhouse, intending to seek Bao-chai’s company inside. Bao-yu would have gone
too, but just at that moment Aroma came up carrying a little varnished wooden ‘tea
for two’ tray, in each of whose rounds nestled a cup of freshly made tea.
‘Well, where’s she gone?’ said Aroma. ‘I brought this out specially, because I could
see the two of you standing here all this time without anything to drink; but now
she’s not here.’
‘That’s her, over there,’ said Bao-yu, removing one of the cups for himself. ‘You can
take it to her inside.’
Aroma did so, but by the time she had reached her, Dai-yu was already standing
talking to Bao-chai.
‘Here you are,’ said Aroma, ‘whichever of you is the thirst?ier had better take this
while I go and fetch another.’
‘I’m not thirsty,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I only want enough to wash out my mouth with.’
She lifted the cup to her lips, drank a mouthful of tea from it, and handed the
remainder to Dai-yu.
‘Let me get you another cup,’ said Aroma.
‘Oh, you know me,’ said Dai-yu smilingly. ‘I can’t drink much tea because of my
illness. The doctor says it’s bad for me. This half cup will be quite enough for me.
Thank you very much, though. It’s very kind of you.’
Having drained the cup, she put it back on the tray, where?upon Aroma went off to
collect the other cup from Bao-yu.
‘Where’s Parfumée?’ Bao-yu asked her when she got back to him. ‘I haven’t seen
her for a long time.’
Aroma looked around.
‘She was here a moment ago. I saw her playing match-my?-flower with some of the
others. Now she seems to have dis?appeared.’
Bao-yu hurried back to his room to look for her. He found her asleep on the bed with
her face turned inwards to the wall.
‘Come on, you mustn’t sleep!’ he said. ‘Come out and get some exercise. We’ll be
eating soon. You want to get an appetite for your food.’
‘Why shouldn’t I sleep?’ said Parfumée. ‘There’s nothing else for me to do. I got so
bored when you all went off drinking and left me on my own.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘We’ll be having a party of our own here in the evening,’ he said, pulling her to her
feet. ‘I’ll ask Aroma to let you sit at table with the rest of us, shall I?’
‘Not on my own,’ said Parfumée. ‘I shouldn’t enjoy it unless Nénuphar and étamine
could be with me as well. Besides, I don’t like noodles. I didn’t have a proper lunch
today because I couldn’t eat the noodles. I got so hungry that just now I asked Liu to
do a bowl of soup and some rice for me to eat here now; so I shan’t want anything
again tonight. I could just drink, I suppose; but if you want me to, you’ll have to let
me drink as much as I like and not let the others fuss over me. When I was still at
home I used to drink two or three catties of rice wine at a sitting, but once I started
learning beastly opera, they wouldn’t let me drink any more in case it spoiled my
voice. During this last year or two I haven’t had so much as a smell of it. Tonight I
should like to celebrate the end of all that.’
‘So you shall,’ said Bao-yu.
At that point a woman arrived from Cook Liu with a food-box containing Parfumée’s
order. Swallow relieved her of it and brought it inside. It contained a bowl of
shrimp-balls in chicken-skin soup, a bowl of duck steamed in wine, a plate of red
salted goose-slices, another plate on which were four cream-cheese rolls stuffed with
pine-kernels, and a large bowl of delicious, steaming-hot, fragrant green rice.
Swallow put these all on the table in front of Parfumée and fetched her a spoon,
chopsticks and some bowls, one of which she filled for her with the fragrant rice.
‘Ugh!’ said Parfumée. ‘How can I eat this horrible greasy stuff?’
She spooned some of the soup onto her rice and picked up a couple of goose-slices
with her chopsticks to put on top of it. The rest she left untouched. Bao-yu sniffed
the rejected dishes. They smelt delicious - much nicer than the things he generally
had to eat. He helped himself to one of the pine-kernel rolls and told Swallow to fill
him another bowl with some rice and pour on some of the soup. The combination
-soup, rice, and pine-roll - was quite delectable. Parfumée and Swallow both laughed
as they watched him eat.
When he and Parfumée had both finished, Swallow would have sent the remainder
back to the kitchen, but Bao-yu told her that she should eat it herself.
‘If it’s not enough, we’ll ask them to bring you some more.’
‘No, no, this will be plenty,’ said Swallow. ‘It’s not long since Musk brought me
some cakes and things from the party. If I eat this now, I shall have had quite enough.’
She proceeded to tuck in there and then, standing where she was beside the table.
Soon all had been demolished except for two pine-kernel rolls.
‘I’ll save these for my Ma,’ she said. ‘Oh, and if you’re drinking this evening, will you
let me have a drop too?’
‘Are you another drinker then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Good! We’ll have a real celebration
tonight. Aroma and Skybright are both fond of drinking, but they won’t take much as
a rule because they feel it isn’t quite proper. Tonight my birthday shall be the excuse
for everyone to let themselves go! By the way, there’s something I’ve been meaning
to ask you for some time but keep forgetting. Would you make yourself responsible
for Parfumée in future? Just keep an eye on her and see that she doesn’t get up to
mischief. Aroma would like to if she could, but she has her hands full already.’
‘I can look after Parfumée, don’t worry about that,’ said Swallow. ‘What I want to
know is, what are you going to do about Fivey?’
‘You can tell Mrs Liu that Fivey definitely will be coming to work here. After I’ve had
a word with the others, she can move in as soon as she likes.’
‘Now you’re talking!’ said Swallow. She called the two little maids in to wait on him
while he washed his hands and pour out tea for him while she herself got the dirty
things together and handed them to the woman outside. After that she washed her
own hands and went off to tell Cook Liu the good news. But that is no part of our
story.
Bao-yu left to rejoin the others as soon as he was ready, and Parfumée, holding a silk
handkerchief in one hand and a fan in the other, trailed along behind him. As he
came out of the courtyard gate he saw Aroma and Skybright walking hand in hand
towards him and asked them what they had come for.
‘You!’ they said. ‘Dinner’s been laid now and the others are waiting for you to
begin.’
Bao-yu explained that he had just eaten.
Aroma laughed:
‘You’re like a cat: always eating except when you ought to be. You’d better come
and sit with them all the same, for appearance’s sake.’
Skybright poked Parfumee playfully on the forehead with her finger.
‘You’re getting to be quite a little man-eater, aren’t you? Going back to have some
food, indeed! You’d arranged to meet him there, more like. Why didn’t you tell
anyone else that you were going?’
Aroma laughed.
‘Oh nonsense, Skybright! Of course she didn’t arrange to meet him. It was a pure
accident, their being there at the same time together.’
‘All right,’ said Skybright, ‘but what does he need us for then? Why don’t we all go
away and leave Parfumee to look after him on her own?’
‘He may not need the rest of us,’ said Aroma, ‘but he certainly couldn’t do without
you.’
‘On the contrary,’ said Skybright. ‘I’m the one person he could do without. I’m lazy,
I’m clumsy, I’m bad-tempered -in short, I’m just no good for the job.’
‘If he burns another hole in his peacock gold snow-cape, who’s going to mend it for
him if you aren’t there?’ said Aroma mischievously. ‘Yes, my girl: all the excuses I
used to hear from you in the past when I tried to get you to do something for me.
You were no good at sewing, oh no! You didn’t even know how to hold a needle! And
it isn’t as if it was my own sewing I’ve asked you about: it’s only ever been his things
that I’ve asked you to help me with. No, you wouldn’t touch them. Yet I only have to
be out of the house for a few days and there you are, sitting up all night sewing for
him, even though you are half dead with the flu! What can the explanation of that be,
I wonder? No, come on: I want to hear your answer.’
But Skybright only ‘pshaw’-ed and went on smiling.
They had been.walking back to the summerhouse through?out these exchanges and
were now re-entering it. Aunt Xue had come back again for the meal, so they
reseated themselves in order of seniority with Aunt Xue at the head. Bao-yu poured a
little tea onto some rice and merely pretended to share the meal with them. When
they had finished eating, they sat talking over their tea or playing games.
Outside, meanwhile, Periwinkle, Caltrop, Parfumée, étamine, Nénuphar and
Cardamome, having been all over the Garden collecting flowers, sat down, with their
laps full of them, in a little semicircle of lawn enclosed by high banks of flowering
shrubbery and began playing ‘match-my-flower’.
‘I’ve got some Guanyin willow,’ said one.
‘I’ve got some Lohan pine,’ said another.
‘I’ve got gentleman’s bamboo.’
‘I’ve got lady’s plantain.’
‘I’ve got green starwort.’
‘I’ve got red moon-flower.’
‘I’ve got a peony from The Peony Pavilion..’
‘I’ve got a lute-flower from The Story of the Lute.’
‘I’ve got “brothers and sisters”,’ said Cardamome.
‘I’ve got “husbands and wives”,’ said Caltrop.
‘There’s no such flower,’ said Cardamome.
‘Yes there is,’ said Caltrop. ‘There are two main kinds of orchid, the spring orchid,
which has only one flower on each stem, and the summer orchid, which has several;
but there’s more than one kind of summer orchid. There’s the kind that you’ve got,
which has the flowers growing one above the other on the stem: that’s called
“brothers and sisters”; and there’s another kind like mine here, which has two
flowers growing side by side at the top: that’s called a “husband and wife” orchid.’
Cardamome rose to her feet. Unable to counter with botani?cal arguments, she
resorted to jeering instead.
‘And I suppose it’s a “father and son” orchid if one flower’s bigger than the other
and an “enemies” orchid if they’re growing back to back! It’s because your own
husband’s been away so long: you can’t even look at an orchid now with?out thinking
of him. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, dragging him into it like this!’
Caltrop laughed, though her face had turned bright red.
‘You horrible little creature! What rubbish you talk!’
She had begun getting up, intending to give Cardamome’s mouth a good pinch; but
before she could do so, Cardamome had thrown herself upon her, forcing her
backwards and pinning her to the ground, while at the same time she looked round
and called to the other girls to help her.
‘étamine! Nénuphar! Come and pinch her mouth for me!’
Caltrop struggled to get free and the two of them rolled over and over on the ground.
The others laughed and clapped their hands.
‘Careful! Mind the puddle!’ they shouted. ‘Mind she doesn’t spoil her skirt!’
Cardamome looked round and saw that they had rolled towards a hollow in which
rain-water had collected and that Caltrop’s skirt was half in it. Feeling somewhat
scared, she let go of Caltrop, jumped up, and ran away. The others thought Caltrop’s
plight a great joke, but fearing that, with Cardamome gone, she might vent her anger
upon them, they ran off also, amidst peals of laughter.
Caltrop got up and inspected her skirt. It was completely soaked, and the foul,
stagnant water was dripping off it in half-a-dozen places. She was still exclaiming
bitterly over it when Bao-yu appeared. Observing that the girls were playing
match-my-flower, he had gone off to collect some flowers himself and had now come
back to join them. Surprised to find the other girls all gone and Caltrop standing on
her own there contemplating her skirt, he asked her what had happened to the
game.
‘I had a “husbands and wives” flower,’ said Caltrop, ‘but the others had never heard
of it and said I’d made it up; so there was a quarrel and they spoilt my nice new skirt.’
Bao-yu seemed pleased.
‘I can match your “husbands and wives”,’ he said, taking a purple skullcap from his
bunch. ‘Look, here’s a “two heads are better than one”.’ He picked up Caltrop’s orchid
and laid it beside the purple skullcap.
‘Bother your “ two heads are better than one”!’ said Caltrop, ‘and bother my
“husbands and wives”! Look at my skirt!’
Bao-yu bent down and examined it.
‘Aiya! How did you manage to do that? It’s grenadine, isn’t it, that red material?
They call it that because it’s the red of pomegranate-flowers. I’m afraid it’s a material
that stains very badly. What a pity!’
‘It was material that Miss Bao-qin brought with her from Nanking,’ said Caltrop.
‘Miss Bao-chai and I each made ourselves a skirt out of it. This is the first time I’ve
put mine on.’
Bao-yu stamped and sighed sympathetically.
‘I’m sure the Xues could afford to spoil a hundred skirts like this one every day,’ he
said; ‘but that’s not the point. In the first place, if this is material that Bao-qin gave
you, it’s going to look rather bad if your skirt’s worn out before Bao?- chai’s has even
been worn. And in the second place, Aunt Xue is a bit inclined to nag - I’ve often
heard her complain?ing that you are extravagant and a bad manager and don’t know
how to look after things properly and so forth - and though this may not be your fault,
I’m afraid if she gets to see it, you are going to have rather a lot of that sort of thing
to listen to.’
What Bao-yu had just said so exactly accorded with what Caltrop herself had been
thinking, that she began, in spite of everything, to feel almost pleased.
‘I know. If only I’d got another skirt like this one, I could change into it straight away
and she wouldn’t notice. But the trouble is, though I’ve got several new skirts, they
all look quite different.’
‘Stop moving!’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you don’t keep still, you’ll get the dirty water on your
trousers and pantaloons and the tops of your shoes. I’ve got an idea. Last month
Aroma made herself a skirt which is practically identical with this one, but she won’t
be able to wear it for a while yet because she’s still in mourning for her mother. Why
don’t we get her to send it over for you to change into?’
Caltrop smiled gratefully but shook her head.
‘No, I can’t do that. I’m sure they wouldn’t like it if they found out.’
‘They won’t mind,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As soon as her mourning’s over you can ask her
what she’d like to have in return and I’m sure they’d be only too pleased to let you
give it to her. Come now, it’s not like you to be so coy! It’s not as if you’ll be doing
anything deceitful. You can tell Bao-chai about it. All we shall be doing is making sure
that my aunt doesn’t get to hear of it, because we know it would only make her
angry.’
Caltrop thought for a bit. What he said seemed reasonable. She smiled and nodded.
‘All right- since you are so kind. I’ll wait for you here, then. Only please, I beg of you,
ask her to bring it here herself.’
Bao-yu agreed, delighted that she had accepted, and hurried back to find Aroma,
head low and eyes to the ground, think?ing about Caltrop all the way.
‘What a pity - nice girl like that - hasn’t any parents -doesn’t even remember her
own name - kidnapped when she was a child - and to be sold to a brute like Pan!’
But not all his thoughts about her were so melancholy.
‘What a delightful surprise, though, to be able to do this for her! - That time with
Patience was a surprise, too. But this! - never, never would have expected it!’
Still engrossed in these thoughts, he regained his room. There, going up to Aroma, he
took her impulsively by the hand and told her what he had come for.
Everyone loved Caltrop. There was something endearing about her that one could
not help responding to. Aroma was no exception and was in any case somewhat
given to acts of impulsive generosity. As soon as Bao-yu told her what had happened,
she opened her clothes-chest, and getting the scarlet skirt out, folded it up carefully
and hurried off after him to look for her.
They found her still standing patiently on the spot where Bao-yu had left her. Aroma
pretended to scold.
‘You’re too wild, Caltrop. It always ends in trouble.’
   Caltrop coloured.
‘Oh, thank you, Aroma. It’s those horrible little beasts I was playing with. I didn’t
realize they could be so nasty.’
She unfolded the skirt that Aroma had brought her. It was, as Bao-yu had said, exactly
like the one she was wearing. She made him turn his back and look away while she
crossed her arms and inserted her hands under her dress in order to undo the
fastenings of the dirty skirt. Having carefully removed it, she wrapped herself in the
clean one and did up the sides.
‘Let me take that dirty one,’ said Aroma. ‘I’ll send it back to you later when I’ve
cleaned it up a bit. If they were to see you going back with it, they’d be sure to ask
questions.’
‘Yes, you take it,’ said Caltrop. ‘But my dear Aroma, I don’t want it back if I’ve got
this one of yours to wear. Give it to one of the younger maids. I don’t mind which one:
you can decide that for me.’
‘That’s very generous of you,’ said Aroma.
Caltrop bowed twice to her in formal expression of her thanks. Aroma then went off,
carrying the dirty skirt.
Looking round for Bao-yu, Caltrop found him still with his back towards her, squatting
down on the ground and just completing the burial of the ‘husband and wife’ orchid
and the purple skullcap. He had dug a little grave for them with a piece of stick, lined
it with fallen petals, laid the two flowers on the petals, covered them with more
petals, and was now smoothing earth over the top. Caltrop tugged at his arm,
laughing.
‘What on earth do you think you’re doing? I’ve heard people talking about the
creepy sort of things you get up to, but I only now realize what they mean. Look at
your hands! They’re absolutely filthy. You’d better go and wash them straight away.’
Bao-yu got up and began to go. Caltrop started walking off, too, in the opposite
direction. She had gone no more than a few steps, however, when she turned and
called to him to stop. Bao-yu, supposing that she had something more to say to him,
turned smilingly towards her, holding up his muddy bands.
‘What is it?’
But Caltrop merely stood there, smiling and saying nothing. Just then her little maid
Advent came up to tell her that Bao-qin wanted to talk to her. After that, finally, she
spoke.
‘You won’t ever tell your Cousin Pan about this, will you?’
‘What, put my head inside the mouth of a tiger?’ said Bao-?yu, laughing. ‘You must
think I’m crazy!’
He turned once more and went back to Green Delights.
What happened there will be related in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 63

Flower maidens combine for
nocturnal birthday revels
And a grass widow copes with funeral arrangements
single-handed



The first thing Bao-yu did when he got back to Green Delights was to wash his hands.
While doing so, he discussed with Aroma the drinking-party that they were planning
to have that evening.
‘I want everyone to enjoy themselves,’ he said. ‘I want you to let yourselves go for
once. Let’s decide now what we are going to eat, so that they have plenty of time to
get it ready.’
‘You don’t have to worry about that,’ said Aroma, smiling. ‘I’ve already made a
collection for tonight and given the money to Mrs Liu: ten pennyweights of silver
each from Skybright, Musk, Ripple and me - that’s two taels - and six each from
Parfumée, Emerald, Swallow and Number Four (I didn’t collect anything from the
ones who are taking the evening off) making three taels four pennyweights
altogether. With that money she’s going to do us forty little dishes of different things
to eat. I’ve also had a word with Patience about the drink and she’s had a two-gallon
jar of Shaoxing wine carried over for us. It’s hidden away over there, ready for the
evening. The party will be our birthday present to you from the eight of us.’
‘How did the younger ones manage to give so much?’ said Bao-yu, pleased but a
little concerned. ‘I think it would have been better if you hadn’t taken contributions
from them.’
‘What about us then?’ said Skybright. ‘We’re not exactly rich. This is something
they wanted to do for you. I think you ought to accept it in the spirit in which it was
offered and not bother too much about where the money came from. Suppose they
stole it: what does that matter to you?’
‘You’re right,’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
‘If you were to go for one single day without feeling the rough side of her tongue,’
said Aroma, ‘I think you would feel deprived!’
‘Aroma is getting quite expert in the art of stirring up trouble between other
people,’ said Skybright. ‘I wonder who she picked it up from.’
While the others were still laughing at these exchanges, Bao-yu gave orders for them
to close the courtyard gate.
‘I don’t wonder the young ladies call you “Busybody”,’ said Aroma. ‘If we shut the
gate now, we shall be simply inviting suspicion. Much better wait a bit.’
Bao-yu nodded.
‘I have to go outside now for a moment. Have some water ready when I get back,
will you, Number Four? Swallow, you can come with me.’
When they were outside and he had first made sure that no one else was about, he
asked Swallow what Cook Liu had said about Fivey.
‘Mrs Liu was very pleased when I told her,’ said Swallow, ‘but she said that because
of all the worry and the harsh treatment she suffered the other night Fivey has had a
relapse; so it’s out of the question for her to begin working with us now. She said it
will just have to wait until she’s better.’
Judging from the long sigh he gave when he heard this, Bao-yu appeared to be very
much distressed.
‘Tell me,’ he asked, ‘does Aroma know about this?’
‘I haven’t told her myself,’ said Swallow. ‘I suppose Parfumée might have done.’
‘Anyway, I haven’t told her yet,’ he said. ‘Hmn. Perhaps I’d better.’
Going back inside, he was careful to wash his hands to avert suspicion.
It was already lighting-up time. A party of women could be heard entering the
courtyard gate. The inmates of Green Delights crowded to the windows to peep out.
It was Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, accompanied by a number of the stewardesses. A woman
holding a big lantern in her hand was leading the way.
‘They’ve come to inspect the watch,’ said Skybright. ‘When they go out again we
shall be able to shut the gate.’
Sure enough, the women on night-duty at Green Delights now trooped out into the
courtyard to be inspected.
‘Now, no gambling and no drinking!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, when she had
ascertained that they were all there. ‘And no lying down and going to sleep until
daylight, or I shall be after you!’
‘None of us is that stupid,’ said the women, laughing. ‘We wouldn’t dare.’
‘Is Master Bao in bed yet?’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife asked them.
The women said they didn’t know. Aroma gave Bao-yu a prod and he shuffled to the
doorway in his slippers and smiled amiably at the assembled matrons outside.
‘I haven’t gone to bed yet. Come inside and sit down.’ He turned to Aroma inside.
‘Aroma, some tea for Mrs Lin!’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife required no pressing.
‘Not in bed yet?’ she exclaimed, stepping nimbly into the room. ‘Now that the days
are so long, you need to go to bed early so that you can get up early in the morning.
If you get up late, people will laugh at you. “That’s no way for an educated,
well-brought-up young gentleman to behave,” they’ll say. “More like an ignorant,
uneducated coolie.”‘
The comparison seemed to please her, for she laughed very complacently after
making it. Bao-yu laughed too.
‘You’re quite right, Mrs Lin. As a matter of fact, I do go to bed early most nights.
Generally when you make your rounds I don’t know you’ve been here because I’m
already in bed when you come. The reason I’ve stayed up today is be?cause I’ve had
such a lot of noodles to eat. I was afraid that if I went to bed now I’d get indigestion.’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife transferred her smiling attention to Aroma.
‘You want to give him some good, strong Pu-er tea to drink.’
Aroma and Skybright answered her together.
‘We made him a big pot of herbal tea - wutong-tips. He’s already had two cupfuls of
it. It’s still quite fresh. Would you like to try some?’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife rose to receive the cup that Skybright poured for her.
‘I hear that Master Bao has taken to calling you senior girls by your names,’ she said.
‘Now that’s not very respectful. Though you work here, you are still Their Ladyships’
girls, don’t forget. I don’t say but what he mightn’t sometimes, just once in a while,
let one of your names drop out by accident, and no harm done. But if he makes a
habit of it, the other young gentlemen will soon be copying him, and we shall get
ourselves laughed at as a family in which the young folk have no respect for their
elders.’
‘You are quite right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But in fact it is only once in a while and quite
unintentionally.’
Aroma and Skybright hastened to corroborate this.
‘Oh yes, Mrs Lin. It would be quite unfair to say that he makes a habit of it.
Normally he is most respectful. It’s only once or twice in this apartment when we’ve
been joking together and never in front of other people.’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife was all smiles.
‘Well, that’s all right then. Respectable is what an educated young gentleman ought
to be. The more you respect others, I say, the more others will respect you. And I
don’t only mean older people who have served three or four generations of the
family, I mean anyone who comes to you from Their Ladyships. Even Their Ladyships’
cat and Their Ladyships’ dog is to be respected, if you want people to think of you as
an edu?cated, well-brought-up young gentleman.’
She finished her tea.
‘Well, good night young master, I must be going.’
‘Won’t you stay a little longer?’ said Bao-yu.
But Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife was already on her way and leading her troops off to inspect
another apartment. Skybright barred the gate after her as soon as she was gone. She
was laughing as she came in afterwards.
‘I think the old girl’s had a bit too much to drink. That’s why we were treated to the
lecture.’
‘She means well,’ said Musk. ‘We need someone to remind us once in a while, just
to keep us on the straight and narrow.’
She began laying the table while she said this; but Aroma stopped her.
‘Let’s not sit up at the big table. We can put the round pear-wood table on the kang.
It will be much more relaxed and comfortable on the kang.’
While other maids lifted the pear-wood table onto the kang, Musk and Number Four
went off to collect the dishes that Cook Liu had been preparing for them. Though
each carried the largest tea-tray she could find, it took four or five trips to carry them
all over. Meanwhile two old nannies squatted on the verandah outside, tending the
stove on which the wine was heating.
‘It’s so hot,’ Bao-yu said to the maids. ‘Let’s take our outer clothes off.’
‘You can take yours off if you like,’ said the girls, ‘but we want to drink a health with
you before we start, so we shall have to stay respectable a bit longer.’
‘If you’re going to begin that sort of nonsense, we shan’t get started until morning!’
said Bao-yu. ‘You know how I hate that kind of thing. It’s bad enough at parties
outside when I have to do it; but to make me do it here in my own room it’s as
though you were deliberately trying to annoy me.’
‘All right, all right!’ they said. ‘Anything you say!’
And so, before taking their places on the kang, they went off to remove their
hair-ornaments and make themselves more comfortable. They returned wearing only
tunics and trousers, with their unadorned hair loosely knotted or coiled. Bao-yu
himself was wearing a dark-red cotton tunic tied at the waist with a sash, and
trousers in a black-and-green-patterned lined silk gauze, unconfined at the ankles.
The girls found him already ensconced on the kang. He was leaning back, one elbow
resting on a newly-made turquoise-coloured pouffe stuffed with rose and peony
petals, playing guess-fingers with Parfumée. Parfumée was shouting excitedly as she
played. She was wearing a very short, close-fitting tunic with a harlequin pattern of
turquoise, deep purple and reddish-brown lozen?ges, a willow-green sash, and
flower-sprigged pale red trousers, which, like Bao-yu’s, were unconfined at the ankles.
Her hair was done up in a number of little plaits which had been drawn back to join
one great plait, as thick as a goose’s egg at the nape of her neck. She had a tiny jade
stud no bigger than a grain of rice in her right ear; from her left ear hung a pendant
made of ruby-glass and gold, the size of a ginkgo-fruit. Never had the moonlike pallor
of her face, the limpid brightness of her eyes shown to greater advantage.
‘Look at that now!’ said the maids admiringly. ‘Wouldn’t you take the two of them
for a pair of twins?’
‘Wait a bit,’ said Aroma, who had begun pouring wine. ‘You can play that later. Even
though you won’t let us drink healths with you, at least do us the honour of drinking
from our hands.’
She held her wine-cup to his lips and he took a sip from it. After that each of the
seven others came up to him in turn, holding their full cups out to him, and he took a
sip from each one. This little ceremony over, they proceeded to arrange themselves
round the table. As there was insufficient room for Swallow and Number Four on the
side nearest the edge of the kang, they brought a couple of felt-covered porcelain
‘tabouret’ stools up and sat at it on the floor below. The forty dishes, all of white
Ding-ware and each no larger than a tea-saucer, contained every conceivable kind of
sweet, savoury, fresh, dried, pickled, salted, smoked, baked, fried or sauteed delicacy
designed to assist the absorption of rice-wine by the human frame.
‘Let’s play a drinking game,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Yes, but let it be a nice, quiet game this time,’ said Aroma. ‘We don’t want too
much shouting, or people will hear us. Something not too learned, though. Don’t
forget that some of us here can’t read or write.’
‘Get out the dice and let’s play Fours then,’ said Musk.
‘No, that’s a boring game,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let’s play Choos?ing the Flower.’
‘Oh yes, do let’s!’ said Skybright. ‘I’ve been wanting to play that for ages.’
‘It’s a good game,’ said Aroma, ‘but you really need more people playing it to make
it interesting.’
‘If you ask me, I think we should slip over and ask Miss Bao and Miss Yun and Miss
Lin to come and join us,’ said Swallow. ‘There’d be no harm in their staying here till
about ten o’clock, surely?’
‘But think of all the opening and closing of gates,’ said Aroma. And suppose you ran
into the watch and they started asking -’
‘It’ll be all right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Ask Miss Tan too; she’s fond of drinking. And if she’s
one of the party, they won’t be able to say anything even if they do find out. And
what about Miss Qin?’
‘No, not Miss Qin,’ said the girls. ‘She’s staying in Mrs Zhu’s room. Routing her out
from there would be simply asking for trouble.’
‘It’ll be all right,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you see. Just ask her.’
Swallow and Number Four needed no second bidding. Choosing a few of the junior
maids to go with them, they ordered the old women to open the gate for them and
set off, one in the direction of Dai-yu’s place and one in the direction of Bao-chai’s.
The senior maids, Aroma, Musk and Skybright, doubted whether, particularly in the
case of Dai-yu and Bao-chai, such insubstantial deputies would be successful and
decided that they had better go themselves and add their own weight to the
invitation. Ordering a couple of the older women with lanterns to accompany them,
they went off in the wake of the other two to see what they could achieve.
It was as they had suspected. Bao-chai ‘thought it was rather late’; Dai-yu ‘didn’t feel
quite up to it’. It was only when Aroma and Skybright had appealed to them by
pointing out that the maids were the hosts and would very much appreciate the
honour that they changed their minds and finally consented to come.
Swallow and Number Four had had no such difficulty with Tan-chun. She had seemed
delighted by the invitation, even suggesting that they should invite Li Wan as well
since it would be embarrassing if she were not invited and were to find out about the
party afterwards - and sending her own maid Ebony to help Swallow persuade Li Wan
that she and Bao-qin should come.
One by one the new guests started to arrive. Caltrop came, too, in addition to the
ones already mentioned. Refusing to take ‘no’ for an answer, Aroma had taken her
firmly by the hand and dragged her off forcibly from All-spice Court. To
accommodate the greater numbers, Aroma and the other girls put another table
alongside the one already on the kang and a row of chairs facing them on the floor
below. Bao-yu and the other guests arranged themselves on the kang, while the
seven maids and Parfumée, as hosts, sat on the row of chairs below, within reach of
one or other of the tables.
‘Cousin Lin can sit there, against the partition,’ said Bao-yu, while the guests were
still arranging themselves on the kang. ‘She’ll be better able to keep warm there.’
He made her a little nest of pillows there, into which, though it was somewhat
inconveniently distant from the table, she settled herself very comfortably. From this
cosy vantage-point she looked across at Li Wan, Bao-chai and Tan-chun with a teasing
smile.
‘You are always grumbling about the gambling and drinking of the servants, yet
here are we proposing to do precisely the same thing ourselves. How will you have
the face to tell them off for this sort of thing in future?’
‘This doesn’t count,’ said Li Wan, smiling back at her. ‘There’s all the difference in
the world between doing this once in a while on a birthday or a holiday and doing it
every night of one’s life.’
Skybright now produced a cylindrical bamboo box containing a set of ivory
drinking-cards, each with a different kind of flower painted on it. After giving it a
good shake, she put it down in the middle of one of the tables. Then she took four
dice, put them inside a dice-box, shook it, opened it, and looked inside. The pips on
the faces uppermost made a total of five. Counting herself as ‘one’, the fifth along in
an anti-clockwise direction was Bao-chai.
‘I draw first then,’ said Bao-chai, smiling. ‘I wonder what it will be.’
She gave the cylinder another shake and pulled out a card. The others craned over to
look. It had a picture of a peony on it with the caption ‘Empress of the Garden’ in
large red characters. This was followed by a line of smaller black characters from a
poem by the Tang poet Luo Yin:
Yourself lack passion, yet can others move.
On the other side of the picture were directions for the person drawing the card and
for the other drinkers:
All present are to drink a cup in your honour. Also,
because you have preeminence over all the other flowers,
you are entitled to ask anyone present to recite a poem
or tell a joke or sing a song for your entertainment.
     The others laughed delightedly.
     ‘The peony suits you perfectly. What a splendid choice!’
When they had all drunk the cupful, Bao-chai drank a little wine herself and said that
she would like Parfumée to sing her a song. Parfumée began:
‘The sumptuous birthday feast begins -’
‘Stop! Stop!’ said the others. ‘We don’t want birthday odes at this time of night.
Sing us something nice.’
Parfumée began again, this time putting all she had into the performance:
‘With my little phoenix-feather broom
I stand at heaven’s door
To sweep away the fallen flowers
That lie on heaven’s floor;
And when, by yonder cloud-bank,
The wind begins to rise,
It stirs the pearly dust up:
Round and round it flies.
O, sweeping heaven’s floor
Is like any earthly chore! ...’

Meanwhile Bao-yu, who had taken temporary possession of the card, continued to
turn it this way and that between his fingers, muttering to himself the line of verse
that was inscribed on it:
Yourself lack passion, yet can others move.
When Parfumée had finished, he gazed at her fixedly, saying nothing. Xiang-yun
snatched the card from him rather im?patiently and handed it back to Bao-chai.
Bao-chai threw the dice. Sixteen. This time the count went right round both tables,
ending at Tan-chun, who was sitting next to her.
‘I wonder what I shall be,’ said Tan-chun, and reached out to draw a card. But she
blushed when she had looked at it and threw it on the table with an embarrassed
laugh.
‘I don’t think we ought to play this game,’ she said. ‘It’s really a game for men to
play, outside. There are all sorts of objectionable things in the directions.’
The others were puzzled, until Aroma picked the card up and held it out for them to
see. The picture was of a spray of almond blossom with the caption ‘Spirit of the
Afterglow’. The line of verse which followed it was by Gao Chan:
Apricot-trees make the sun’s red-petalled floor.
Then came the part which had made Tan-chun feel embarrassed:
You are destined to make a noble marriage. Congratulations! Those present must
  offer you a cup of wine and drink a cup in your honour.
The reading of these words was greeted with general laughter.
‘So that’s what upset you? Well, it’s true there are a few like this which are amusing
at the expense of us girls, but there’s no real harm in them. Anyway, what’s wrong
with the prognostication? We’ve already got one royal consort in the family, why
shouldn’t we have another? Congratulations!’
They raised their cups and drank a toast to the marriage. Tan-chun herself refused to
drink, but Xiang-yun, Caltrop and Li Wan seized hold of her and forced the wine down
her throat. Even then she continued to insist that they ought to abandon the game
and play something else. Xiang-yun had to take hold of her hand, clamp her fingers to
the dice-box, and force her to throw the dice. The number thrown in this way was
nineteen. This time the count was more than the number of players and ended, the
second time round, at Li Wan. Li Wan shook the cylinder and drew out a card. She
smiled when she saw what she had got.
‘Very good! Look at this, all of you! This is rather a nice one.’
The picture was of a winter-flowering plum with the rubric ‘Beauty of the Snow’. The
verse that followed was by Wang Qi:
Content by cottage fence to bloom unseen.
The instructions given on this card were:
You are to drink a cup of wine. The next player after you is to throw the dice.
‘There, isn’t that nice!’ said Li Wan. ‘You have to throw the dice for me and I just sit
back enjoying myself and let the world go by!’
She sipped her wine and passed the dice-box to Dai-yu. The eighteen which Dai-yu
threw brought the count round to Xiang-yun.
‘Ha ha!’ said Xiang-yun, rolling up her sleeves. She stretched her arm out and drew
a card. The others looked at what she had drawn. It was a picture of crab-apple
blossom with the caption ‘Sweet Drunken Dreamer’. The quotation following was a
line from Su Dong-po:
Fear that the flowers at dead of night should sleep.
‘For “at dead of night” read “on a stone bench”,’ said Dai-yu.
The others laughed, remembering Xiang-yun’s inebriation earlier in the day; but
Xiang-yun smiled unconcernedly and pointed to the self-propelling toy boat on
Bao-yu’s shelf.
‘Just get on that boat and go home, will you? You have too much to say for yourself,
my girl!’
Amidst further laughter they looked at the instructions:
          In view of the sweet drunken dreaming you are not to drink anything
yourself,
but the players sitting to right and left of you are each to drink a cupful.
‘Holy name!’ said Xiang-yun, clapping her hands delight?edly. ‘What a kind,
thoughtful card!’
Xiang-yun’s neighbours, it so happened, were Dai-yu and Bao-yu. Others filled their
cups for them in readiness. Bao-yu drank half of his and gave the rest to Parfumee,
who threw her head back and emptied it at a gulp; Dai-yu, under cover of talking to
someone, emptied the whole of hers into a spittoon. Xiang-yun picked up the dice.
The total this time was nine, which meant that Musk was to draw. The card she drew
portrayed a rose under the caption ‘Summer’s Crowning Glory’. The black-letter verse
was another line from Wang Qi:
After sweet Rose there is no more blooming.
And the instructions:
All present drink three cups to commemorate the passing of the flowers.
      ‘What does it say?’ Musk asked.
Bao-yu frowned and quickly hid the card.
‘We are all to drink something,’ he said.
As a compromise they drank three sips each instead of the three cupfuls prescribed.
Musk threw nineteen with the dice, which made it Caltrop’s turn to draw. The flower
she drew was a purple skullcap with the caption ‘Three Springs’ Harbinger’. The line
of verse was by Zhu Shu-zhen:
Even as the twy-stemmed blossoms break in bloom.
And the comment:
This flower is a luck-bringer. Congratulations! Those present are to offer
you three cups of wine and are each to drink a cup of wine to your health.
     Caltrop threw six. Dai-yu to draw.
‘I wonder if there are any nice ones left,’ Dai-yu thought as she reached out to draw
a card. ‘I hope I shall pick one of them if there are.’
She looked at the card she had taken. It was a hibiscus flower. ‘Mourner of the
Autumn Mere’ the caption said, and the line of verse was by Ou-yang Xiu:
Your own self, not the East Wind, is your undoing.
The instructions said:
You are to drink a cup of wine yourself, and Peony is to take a cup with you.
     The others laughed.
     ‘Isn’t that good! It’s exactly the right flower for her.’
     Dai-yu too seemed pleased. When she and Bao-chai had drunk, she threw the
dice. Twenty. That meant that Aroma was to draw. Aroma reached out and took a
card. The picture on it was of a spray of peach-blossom with the caption ‘Fisherman’s
Lost Paradise’ and the verse, from Xie Fang-de:
Peach-trees in pink and another spring is here.
The instructions said:
Almond is to drink a cup of wine with you, so is anyone who is the same age as you,
anyone whose birthday is on the same day, and anyone who has the same surname.
     ‘This one sounds interesting,’ said the others, laughing, and at once began
working out which of them belonged to these categories. Caltrop, Skybright and
Bao-chai were all the same age as Aroma; Dai-yu’s birthday was on the same day; but
there appeared to be no one present with the same surname – until Parfumée
pointed out that her surname, like Aroma’s, was ‘Hua’ and claimed the right to drink
a cup as well.
     While the others were pouring out the wine, Dai-yu looked mischievously at
Tan-chun:
      ‘As both Almond and someone who is destined to marry royalty, you had better
begin.’
      ‘What’s that?’ said Tan-chun. She turned to Li Wan. ‘Oblige me by leaning over
and giving that girl a back-hander, would you?’
      ‘Oh, that seems rather hard!’ said Li Wan. ‘She’s not getting a royal husband and
now she is to be beaten as well!’
      Aroma was about to throw the dice when they heard someone calling outside
the gate. One of the old women hurried out to see who it was and came back to
tell them that it was some people from Aunt Xue’s come to collect Dai-yu.
      ‘What time is it?’ they asked the old woman.
      ‘Long past second watch,’ she said. ‘It struck eleven some time ago.’
      Bao-yu, refusing to believe that it could be so late, asked to see his watch. He
found on inspecting it, however, that it was in fact five and twenty minutes past
eleven. Dai-yu rose to her feet.
      ‘I can’t, in any case, keep going much longer,’ she said. ‘And I have to take my
medicine when I get back.’
      ‘Perhaps we’d all better break off now,’ said the others.
      Aroma and Bao-yu tried to dissuade them, but Li Wan and Tan-chun were
insistent.
‘It’s terribly late. We’ve already broken enough rules for one day.’
‘Very well,’ said Aroma. ‘All of you lust drink one more cup of wine then, and we’ll
let you go.’
Skybright, assisted by one of the junior maids, was already filling their cups. The
others drank up and called for their lanterns to be lit. When they were ready, Aroma
and the rest of the maids accompanied them all the way to the far side of Drenched
Blossoms Bridge before returning to Green Delights. There, having once more barred
the gate, they continued for a while with the game. Aroma filled some extra large
cups with wine and put a selection of the delicacies on the little dishes on to a large
plate to give to the old women who had been all this time on duty.
Everyone was by now beginning to be a little drunk. Soon they were playing
guess-fingers and singing solos. By two o’clock the old women, who had been
supplementing what the maids, in their kindness, had given them by surreptitiously
helping themselves, had made such formidable inroads into the wine-supply that the
two-gallon jar was suddenly found to be empty. On hearing that there was no more
wine, the maids began to clear the things away and to wash and prepare themselves
for bed.
Parfumée, who had drunk so much that her cheeks were flushed and her eyes
glittered with an unnatural brightness, was incapable of moving. She leaned inertly
against Aroma’s shoulder, murmuring plaintively in her ear.
‘Oh, Aroma! My heart is beating so!’
Aroma laughed.
     ‘You shouldn’t have drunk so much!’
Swallow and Number Four had long since succumbed and were lying asleep on the
kang. Skybright tried unsuccessfully to wake them; but Bao-yu stopped her:
‘Leave them alone. It doesn’t matter if we all sleep here for once.’
He followed their example by pillowing his head on the petal-stuffed damask cushion,
turning over on his side, and promptly dropping off to sleep.
     Aroma could see that Parfumée was extremely drunk. Fearing that any but the
slightest movement might make her sick, she lifted her up, very, very gently, and laid
her down beside Bao-yu on the kang. She herself lay down on the couch opposite. A
gentle oblivion then descended upon all of them and they slept like tops until
morning.
     It was already broad daylight when Aroma opened her eyes.
     ‘Oh, it’s late!’ she said.
     She raised her head up to look at the kang opposite. Parfumée was still fast
asleep, her head resting on the raised edge of the kang. Aroma hurriedly got up and
went across to wake her. Her calling aroused Bao-yu, who sat up, looked around him
cheerfully, commented ‘It’s late!’, and gave Parfumée a prod. Then Parfumée, too, sat
up, rubbing her eyes and still only half awake.
     ‘Shame on you!’ said Aroma, laughing at her. ‘Look where you spent last night!
You must have been very drunk, not to have chosen your place more carefully!’
     Parfumée looked around her and saw that she had spent the night at Bao-yu’s
side. She slipped off the kang hurriedly, with an embarrassed laugh.
      ‘How did I …?’
      ‘I don’t know either,’ said Bao-yu, laughing. ‘If I had known, I should have
rubbed some ink on your face!’
      Maids now came in carrying the basin and other things for his toilet.
      ‘Thank you all very much for last night’s party,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ll have another
one tonight and this time you shall all be my guests.’
      ‘Oh, no!’ said Aroma. ‘Not again! If we make another rumpus tonight, people
will start complaining.’
      ‘That’s all right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s only twice. Anyway, we’re all seasoned
drinkers. Just think, we got through a whole two-gallon jar of wine last night! Just
as it was beginning to get interesting, we found that we’d run out.’
      ‘That’s how it should be,’ said Aroma. ‘It’s much better to end a party when the
fun is at its height than to go on until everyone is exhausted. I must say, everyone
was in very good form last night. Skybright was being quite abandoned. She even
sang a song, if I remember rightly!’
‘But don’t you remember?’ said Number Four. ‘You sang one too. We all did.’
A fit of uncontrollable giggles possessed the maids as they remembered, and they hid
their blushing faces in their hands. While they were still giggling, a smiling Patience
arrived. She had come to invite her hosts of the previous day to a return party.
‘No excuses!’ she said. ‘I shall expect every one of you to be there.’
They made her sit down and somebody fetched her some tea.
‘What a pity we didn’t have her with us last night!’ Skybright commented.
Patience pricked up her ears.
‘Why, what were you doing last night?’
‘I don’t know whether I ought to tell you,’ said Aroma. ‘We had a high old time, I
can tell you that. Even the high jinks Her Old Ladyship gets up to with the young
ladies and Master Bao are nothing compared to last night. We got through a whole
two-gallon jar of wine. We drank so much that we forgot our shame, singing songs
until after two o’clock, then lying around with our clothes on and sleeping where we
lay until morning.’
‘Charming!’ said Patience with pretended indignation. ‘You come and ask me for
wine, you don’t invite me to your party, and now you have the nerve to tell me what
a wonderful time you had. I feel really angry!’
‘He’s giving a return party tonight,’ said Skybright. ‘He’s sure to ask you to that. I
expect he’ll be going over himself shortly to invite you.’
‘“He” is who? Who is “he”?’ said Patience.
‘Oh, sharp-ears!’ Skybright coloured and pretended to strike her. ‘Trust you to pick
on a little thing like that!’
‘Well, I can’t stay here talking, I’ve got something to attend to,’ said Patience. ‘I’ll be
sending someone over later to tell you when it’s ready. Mind you all come now, or I’ll
have the troops out to come and get you!’
Bao-yu and the maids tried to detain her, but she was already on her way.
Bao-yu now completed his interrupted toilet and took his early morning tea. While
he sat sipping it, his eye chanced to light on a sheet of paper underneath the
inkstone.
‘I wish you girls wouldn’t use my inkstone as a paper?weight,’ he said.
Aroma and Skybright were immediately on the defensive.
‘Oh dear! Who’s at fault this time?’
Bao-yu pointed towards the offending paper.
‘Look. Under the inkstone. Someone’s pattern, I expect, that she forgot to put
away.’
Skybright lifted the inkstone and picked up the paper from underneath. It was not an
embroidery-pattern but some kind of writing. She handed it to Bao-yu. It was a sheet
of pink, patterned letter-paper. A single column of characters ran down the centre of
it:
From Adamantina, the Dweller Beyond the Threshold: Respect?ful Anniversary
Greetings.
‘Who took delivery of this note?’ he asked, jumping up excitedly.
Assuming, from the degree of agitation, that the note must be from a person of some
consequence, Aroma and Skybright took up the question. In response to their
shouted inquiry, a smiling Number Four came running into the room.
‘I did. From Adamantina. She didn’t bring it herself, she sent one of the old women
with it. I put it down somewhere in here. I meant to tell you about it, but with all that
drinking last night I forgot.’
‘So that’s who it’s from,’ said the other maids. ‘What a fuss about nothing!’
But Bao-yu evidently did not think so.
‘Fetch me some paper,’ he said, still in some agitation, and himself began grinding
the ink. But when the ink was ground and he sat with moistened brush poised in
readiness over the virgin paper, he found that he did not know how to begin. What
was the correct response to ‘Dweller Beyond the Threshold’? For a long time he sat
thinking, but no inspira?tion was forthcoming.
‘It’s no good asking Bao-chai,’ he thought. ‘She’d only say something critical about
Adamantina being too “fanciful”. I’d better ask Dai-yu.’
Slipping Adamantina’s note into his sleeve, he set off in the direction of the Naiad’s
House. He was just stepping off the Drenched Blossoms bridge when he caught sight
of Xing Xiu-yan bustling along in a very purposeful manner from the opposite
direction.
‘Where are you going?’ he asked her.
‘I want to have a talk with Adamantina.’
Bao-yu was surprised.
‘Adamantina is such a strange, contrary person. There are very few people she can
get on with. If she thinks highly of you, it proves that you must be made of finer stuff
than the rest of us.’
‘I don’t know whether she thinks particularly highly of me,’ said Xiu-yan, ‘but we
were neighbours for ten years. When she was serving her novitiate at the Coiled
Incense Temple, there was only a party wall separating her from the place where my
family lived. My family was too poor to own a house and for ten years lived in rented
accommodation in her temple. Whenever I had nothing else to do, I used to go inside
the nuns’ courtyard and spend my time with Adamantina. It was she who taught me
to read and write. In fact, everything I know, practically, I owe to her. So you see,
she’s not only my “hard times friend”; she is also in a sense my teacher. When my
parents finally came here to throw themselves on the generosity of your family, we
learned that Ada?mantina, too, had found a home here. She had evidently found this
a place where her eccentricities would be tolerated and where she would be safe
from molestation by those having the power to persecute her. It seemed as if our
destinies must be linked. And I was glad to find, when I went to look her up here, that
her friendship for me was unaltered. In fact, I think that if anything she is even nicer
to me now than she was before.’
As if by a flash of lightning, the mystery of Xiu-yan’s utter alienness from her
appalling parents was revealed.
‘I see!’ he said. ‘That ethereal, crane-in-the-clouds quality one notices in everything
you do or say-I see now where you get it from. As a matter of fact it’s something to
do with Adamantina that has brought me out. Something she wrote has been
puzzling me and I was on my way to ask someone else’s advice about it when I ran
into you. It’s an extraordinary bit of luck that I did, because you are obviously much
better qualified to advise me than the person I had been intending to ask.’
He took the piece of paper from his sleeve and showed it to her. Xiu-yan ran her eye
over it and laughed.
‘She’ll never change. The same whimsical, preposterous Adamantina as always!
Who but Adamantina would use her nom-de-plume in a birthday greeting? Talk
about “a monk no monk and a maid no maid”! What sort of etiquette is that?’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Bao-yu, smiling. ‘Adamantina is above etiquette. She doesn’t
subscribe to the conventions of our mundane world. Her writing to me in this way
shows that she must credit me with some intelligence. Unfortunately I haven’t the
faintest idea in what terms I ought to reply. I was on my way to ask Cousin Lin’s
advice when I was fortunate enough to bump into you.’
For some moments Xiu-yan ran her eyes up and down Bao-yu appraisingly. Finally
she broke into a laugh.
‘“The sight of it exceedeth the report thereof.” I see now what they mean. I’m not
surprised she sent you this. And I’m not surprised she gave you all that plum-blossom
last year. Well, if even Adamantina has succumbed, I suppose I shall have to do my
little bit by explaining what this means.
‘Adamantina is fond of saying that out of all the poems by all the poets of the Han,
Jin, North-and-South, Tang and Song dynasties, a couple of lines in Fan Cheng-da’s
“Walk in the Cemetery” are the only decent verses ever written:
Though you hide behind a threshold of indestructible iron,
The mound shaped like a wheat-cake will claim you for its own.
That’s why she calls herself “The Dweller Beyond the Threshold”. Her favourite
prose-writer is Zhuang-zi, so sometimes she calls herself “The Outsider”, after
Zhuang-zi’s “outsider ... wandering beyond the realm”. The way to please her is to
refer to yourself modestly as someone still trapped in the toils of the wicked world
while she is floating freely somewhere above them. If she’d called herself “The
Outsider” in this note she’s sent you, the right response would have been to call
yourself “The Worldling” in your reply. As she’s called herself “The Dweller Beyond
the Threshold”, you should refer to yourself in answering as “The Dweller Behind the
Threshold”, to indicate that you have understood the reference to Fan Cheng-da.’
The scriptures tell us that the revelation of the Buddha-truth comes ‘like ghee poured
upon the head’. Bao-yu must have had some such feeling as he listened to Xiu-yan,
for he first of all gave a gasp of discovery and then laughed out loud.
‘I see! That’s why our family temple is called the “Temple of the Iron Threshold”！
Thank you very much. Now I can go and write my reply.’
Xiu-yan continued on her way to Green Bower Hermitage and Bao-yu went back to
write his note. He wrote:
From Bao-yu, Dweller Behind the Threshold, Devout and Humble Thanks.
He carried the note to the Hermitage himself and posted it through the crack
between the double doors.
By the time he got back to Green Delights, Parfumee had just completed her toilet.
She had gone back to the elaborate feminine coiffure which she normally favoured,
complete with kingfisher-feather hair-ornaments; but Bao-yu said he would prefer to
see her permanently got up like a boy. He had her fringe and side-pieces cut off and
the remaining short bits shaved away from her forehead round to the back of her
neck, so that only the long hair growing from the crown of her head remained.
‘We’ll get you a big fur cap with ear-flaps to wear in the winter,’ he said, ‘and big
tiger-boots for your feet, or white socks and thick-soled, stitch-patterned padded
shoes, to go with loose-bottomed trousers. And we’d better change your name.
“Parfumée” won’t do for a boy. What about “Honey Boy”? We can call you “Honey”
for short.’
     Parfumée was delighted.
‘Now you’ll be able to take me with you when you go outside,’ she said. ‘If anyone
asks about me, you can tell them that I’m one of your pages, like Tealeaf.’
Bao-yu smiled at the idea, but seemed rather doubtful.
‘I think sooner or later they’d be able to tell that you weren’t.’
‘You have no imagination!’ said Parfumée ‘Tell them I’m a foreign page. Your
family’s got several foreign pages.* Anyway a pigtail suits me; everyone says it does.
What about it? Don’t you think it’s a brilliant idea?’
Bao-yu was quite won over.
* Stone’s Note to Reader:
Both the Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family did in fact employ a number of
foreign captives taken by previous members of the family in their various military
campaigns and later graciously bestowed on them as bond-slaves by His Imperial
Majesty. They were invariably employed as grooms, being useless for any other kind
of work. Parfumee transvestism was by no means a novelty in the household. The
tomboyish Shi Xiang-yun had long since shown a passion for dressing up in military
uniform and was frequently to be seen wearing a cavalryman’s belt and tight-sleeved
riding habit. When Bao-yu put Parfumee into boy’s clothing, she was quick to follow
suit by dressing her own Althee in a page’s costume. As a ‘painted face’ Althee was
already in the habit of shaving off the short hair above her forehead and round her
ears to facilitate making-up and had acquired a certain masculinity of movement and
gesture from the roles she played, so the transformation was in her case a less drastic
one. Li Wan and Tan-chun were so taken with the result that they decided to dress
Bao-qin’s Cardamome up as a little page as well. Her hair was done up in two knots
like horns, one on each side of her head. Dressed in trousers and a short smock and
with a pair of red shoes on her feet she looked - except for the make-up - exactly like
the scholar’ page, Lute Boy, in the play. Xiang-yun changed Althee’s name to ‘Valiant’
because she thought it suited her. Cardamome was the youngest, liveliest and most
mischievous of the little ex-actresses and the majority of the Garden’s inhabitants
had already taken to calling her by less flattering sobriquets long before her
transformation into a page. After the transformation had been made, Bao-qin
rejected ‘Lute Boy’ as too obvious; and since she liked ‘Cardamome’ and thought it a
pretty name, she resolved to retain at any rate the middle part of it by calling the
new page ‘Damon’.
Stone
‘It’s a very good idea. I’ve often seen officials with little foreign servants - mostly
Tartars or Tibetans captured in the wars. People like to have them as grooms because
they are good at handling horses and don’t mind waiting about in the cold. We’ll
have to give you a foreign name then. What about “Yelü Hunni” ? “Yelü” is an old
Kitan Surname and “Hunni” is what the Xiong-nu used to call themselves.’
Parfumée was very satisfied with this, so it was agreed that in future she would
always be referred to as Yel Parfumée Hunni.
After lunch Patience’s messenger arrived to say that, as the summerhouse in the
Peony Garden was thought to be too hot, her return party had been laid out in the
Shady Elm rooms. You-shi came over well in advance, bringing two of Cousin Zhen’s
little concubines, Lovey and Dove, with her from Ning-guo House. They were very
young and wild and had seldom been taken to the neighbouring mansion before.
Today, meeting such lively members of the Garden’s society as Caltrop, Xiang-yun,
Parfumée and étamine for the first time, they were in their element, quickly proving
the truth of the old saying about ‘birds of a feather’ by chattering nineteen to the
dozen with their new-found friends and dashing off with them on an exploratory tour
of the Garden. You-shi was left to the company of her own maids.
Presently, when they were visiting Green Delights, Caltrop, Lovey and Dove were very
much amused to hear Bao-yu addressing Parfumée as ‘Yelü Hunni’. Having elicited
from her how she came to have acquired so extraordinary a name, they began to try
using it themselves; but in their unpractised mouths the foreign sounds soon
degenerated into ‘Yellow Honey’; and even this was soon abandoned in favour of
‘Yellow Belly’. The maids, hearing them call her this, were all in stitches. Bao-yu
feared that Parfumée would be wounded by their hilarity and proposed yet another
change of name.
‘There is a land in the West called “Fran-see-ya” where they make a kind of golden
glitter-glass called “aventurin”. You are such a bright and glittering person yourself: I
think the name Aventurin would suit you very well.’
Parfumée was delighted with it. But it was still no good: the others found ‘Aventurin’
too difficult; and having established that it was the name of some kind of foreign
glass, soon took to calling her ‘Glassy’ or ‘Glass-eyes’ instead.
      But we digress.
      The party in the Shady Elm rooms had now begun. Once more wine was made
an excuse for much unrestrained hilarity. The blind ballad-singers were asked to drum
for them and Patience broke off a spray of peonies to play ‘passing the branch’ with.
There must have been near enough twenty people taking part in the game. Just as
the fun was at its height, it was announced that two women had arrived delivering
things from the Zhen family in Nanking and Tan-chun, Li Wan and You-shi had to go
off to the jobs room to receive them. The others decided to make a little break in the
party while they did so, in which those who wanted to could take some exercise
outside. Lovey and Dove decided to have a swing.
      ‘You get up as well,’ Bao-yu said to Lovey, who was pushing. ‘I’ll push you both.’
      ‘Oh no you don’t!’ said Lovey. ‘I know your kind of pushing! Yellow-belly can
push us.’
      ‘Please,’ said Bao-yu exasperatedly, ‘don’t call her by that horrible name! You’ll
have all the others calling her by it as well.’
      Dove was giggling helplessly on the swing.
      ‘Stop it, you two! I can’t work this thing properly if you make me laugh. I shall
fall off, if you’re not careful, and knock all the gravy out of you!’
      While they were in the midst of their diversions, a group of servants from the
Ning-guo mansion came rushing up in a state of great agitation.
      ‘Sir Jing is dead!’
      ‘Dead?’ Everyone hearing them was incredulous. ‘But he hadn’t been ill. How
can he have died so suddenly?’
      ‘He spent all his time looking for the secret of immortality.’ said one of the
servants. ‘Perhaps he found it and went off to heaven.’
      You-shi heard the news with dismay. There would be so much to do, and with
Cousin Zhen, Jia Rong and Jia Lian all three away, no dependable male around to help
her. The first thing she did, of course, was to remove all her jewellery and the
ornaments from her hair. Then, having ordered some of the household to go on
ahead and put all the Taoists there under lock and key pending her husband’s return,
she got into her carriage and drove with all speed to the Dark Truth Monastery
outside the city, accompanied by the Chief Steward Lai Sheng’s wife and several of
the senior stewardesses. Meanwhile other servants were dispatched to various
members of the faculty requesting their attendance at the monastery.
The physicians duly arrived. As the patient was already dead, there was little scope
for their customary methods of diagnosis; but they knew that Sir Jing had gone in for
breath-control and various other kinds of Taoist hocus-pocus, some of which, like the
worship of the Seven Stars, the keeping of ‘ghost-worm’ vigils and the swallowing of
mercuric ‘elixirs’, must have gravely weakened his constitution and may well have
hastened his death; and when they saw the purple face and cracked and shrivelled
lips of the corpse and felt the iron-hard abdomen, they had little difficulty in forming
their collective opinion, which their spokesman delivered forthwith to the waiting
women: ‘That death was due to edema and corrosion following ingestion by the
deceased of some toxic metallic substance in pursuance of his Taoist researches.’
‘It wasn’t toxic,’ protested the Taoists, alarmed for their own safety. ‘It was an
infallible secret formula, but it needed to be taken in the right conditions. We told
him he wasn’t ready for it, but he wouldn’t believe us. He must have taken it during
the vigil last night, when he was meditating on his own and there was nobody around
to stop him. He will have gone straight to heaven, of course: such faith is sure to be
rewarded. We must rejoice that he has cast off the corrupt gar?ment of flesh and left
this sea of misery behind him.’
But You-shi had no intention of getting drawn into an argument. Her only reply was
to give orders that they should all be locked up again and remain so until Cousin
Zhen could deal with them when he got back. Riders were dispatched post-haste to
inform him of his father’s death.
You-shi could see at a glance that the monastery’s accommodation was far too
cramped for the lying-in-state; on the other hand there could be no question of her
taking the corpse back with her into the city. She therefore had it wrapped up and
carried in a curtained chair to the Temple of the Iron Threshold. And as she calculated
that it would probably be at least half a month before Cousin Zhen got back, by
which time, as this was the hottest part of the year, the process of decomposition
would already be well advanced, she decided, acting on her own initiative, to consult
an astrologer and find out the earliest date on which the body could be encoffined.
The coffin was conveniently to hand, having been deposited in the Temple of the Iron
Threshold when it was purchased some years previously. The formal going into
mourning and its attendant ceremonies were scheduled to take place three days later.
Staging was put up in readiness for the Taoists and Buddhists, but their requiems
were to be deferred until Cousin Zhen should have returned.
While You-shi and the already depleted staff were attending to these matters outside
the city, no one with authority was left in the two mansions able to deal with callers
from outside. On the Rong-guo side Xi-feng was still unable to see people because of
her illness, Li Wan was fully occupied in looking after the young people, and Bao-yu
was too lacking in savoir-faire to be trusted. It was necessary to call in a number of
obscure junior clansmen who had done occasional odd-jobs for the family in the past:
Jia Bin, Jia Guang, Jia Heng(Ⅰ), Jia Chang and Jia Ling. On the Ning-guo side even the
internal running of the household was a problem, since You-shi was for the time
being unable to get back at all. She had to call on her step-mother, old Mrs You, to
keep an eye on things for her. As Mrs You had two young unmarried daughters by a
previous marriage, the most sensible arrangement seemed to be to bring the girls
with her and install herself in temporary residence at Ning-guo House.
At this point our story moves elsewhere. As soon as the news reached him of his
father’s death, Cousin Zhen made an urgent application for leave of absence to the
Board of Rites. He included Jia Rong’s name in the petition, since Jia Rong was,
nominally at any rate, the holder of a commis?sion. The officials of the Board of Rites,
bearing in mind His Imperial Majesty’s devotion to the Late Emperor and
determination to give fullest expression to it in these obsequies of the Late Emperor’s
favourite Consort, dared not grant leave of absence on their own initiative and
referred the matter to the Emperor himself in a memorial. But the Son of Heaven,
with that godlike compassion that is so typical of him, far from making his own
bereavement an objection, saw it as all the more reason for sympathizing with the
bereavement of a subject - particularly one whose ancestor had performed such
great and signal services for the Crown. His immediate reac?tion on reading the
memorial was to ask for particulars of Jia Jing’s official rank. The Board of Rites
memorialized back as follows:
Jia Jing: Palace Graduate, Second Class. His hereditary office and emoluments were
passed on during his lifetime to his son Jia Zhen. Owing to age and ill-health, he had
for some years past been living in religious seclusion at the Dark Truth Monastery,
where he was resident at the time of his death. Jia Zhen and his son Jia Rong are in
attendance here at the mausoleum for the obsequies of Her Late Highness and are
Your Imperial Majesty’s petitioners for leave to absent themselves in order to attend
to the funeral arrangements.
On receipt of this memorial His Imperial Majesty was graciously pleased to issue the
following Rescript:
Although Jia Jing’s own life appears to have been undistin?guished by service to the
state, nevertheless in recognition of the distinguished record of loyal service to the
Crown of his grandfather the Duke of Ning-guo it is Our pleasure that a Court
appointment carrying the honours and entitlements of an officer of the Fifth Rank
should be bestowed upon him posthumously, and that his son and grandson should
be authorized to convey his remains into the Capital, entering by way of the Lower
North Gate, and to display them there in their private residence in the customary
manner; and thereafter, having duly carried out all rites and ceremonies that are
lawful to be performed, to convey them thence to the deceased’s registered place of
origin for interment. And furthermore it is Our pleasure that Our treasury at the
Imperial Victuallers should disburse to the said son and grandson a sum being the
equivalent of one portion of funeral offerings of the First Grade towards the
defrayment of the said Jia Jing’s funeral expenses; and that it should he lawful and
permitted for holders of Court appointments up to and including the rank of Prince
and Duke to make offerings and condolences.
     When the contents of this Rescript were made known, it was not only the
members of the Jia family who expressed their gratitude: all the great officers of the
Court were loud in their praises of this extraordinary example of Imperial
magnani?mity.
Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong at once set off on horseback, determined to ride both night
and day until they reached their destination. About half way along their road they
came upon a group of horsemen riding hell-for-leather towards them who turned out
to be Jia Bin and Jia Guang at the head of a party of Jia family domestics. They threw
themselves from their saddles as soon as they recognized Cousin Zhen and touched
knee and hand to the ground in the Manchu salute.
‘Why have you come?’ Cousin Zhen asked them.
‘Mrs Zhen was worried that when you and Rong left there would be no one to
escort Her Old Ladyship,’ Jia Bin replied, ‘so she sent us to take your place.’
Cousin Zhen expressed his approval of his wife’s thoughtfulness.
‘And what about things at home?’ he asked. ‘How have you been managing?’
Jia Bin told him how You-shi had had the Taoists put under arrest, how she had had
Jia Jing’s body moved to the family temple, and how, in order that there might be
someone at home to keep an eye on things during her absence, she had persuaded
her step-mother and two step-sisters to move into temporary residence at Ning-guo
House. At mention of the two step-sisters the face of Jia Rong, who had dismounted
when the others did, was observed to break into a grin. For his part Cousin Zhen
merely nodded, observed several times over that these arrangements were ‘very
sensible’, and, touching the riding-whip to his horse’s flanks, was on his way once
more.
Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong rode on then through daylight and darkness, stopping at
post-houses along the way only long enough to obtain a change of mount. It was
night-time when they approached the outskirts of the Capital and well after two in
the morning when they reached the Temple of the Iron Threshold. Those keeping
watch had to rouse the others up to meet them. Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong
dismounted and lifted up their voices in loud wailing. Still wailing, they crawled on
their knees all the way from the Outer gate of the temple to the lying-in-state room
inside. There, at the foot of the coffin, they knocked their heads repeatedly on the
floor and wept with abandon until daylight, by which time they had all but lost their
voices.
After a brief intermission during which Cousin Zhen was greeted by You-shi and the
rest (for he had not, till that moment, had an opportunity of speaking to them) he
and Jia Rong changed into the appropriate hempen mourning-garments before
returning to bow once more at the foot of the coffin.
Cousin Zhen found it impossible to achieve quite that state of self-absorbed grief -
‘oblivious to all around’ - which books of etiquette require of the bereaved son: there
were too many things that needed attending to. For example, friends and relations
had to be informed about the Gracious Rescript permitting a lying-in-state at the
mansion and the receiving of offerings and condolences there. Jia Rong was ordered
back home to make all preparations necessary for receiving the coffin.
Jia Rong was pleased with his commission. Hurrying to horse, he rode briskly into the
city. As soon as he got back, he ordered the servants to begin clearing the furniture
from the front reception hall at Ning-guo House and making a shrine for the coffin
there out of screens and hangings. He also told them to put up awnings for the
funeral bands outside the doorway, and a cloth and cane archway which should later
be covered with funerary inscriptions. When he was satis?fied that all this work was
well in hand, he hurried into the inner apartments to meet his grandmother and two
young aunts.
The Hon. Mrs You (the late Mr You - You-shi’s father – had been a mandarin of the
sixth rank) was an elderly lady much given to taking naps. She was in fact recumbent
upon the kang and refreshing herself with sleep at the moment when Jia Rong
entered. It was the two daughters, sewing amidst their maids, who welcomed him.
‘I’m glad you’ve come, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong, grinning broadly at the elder of them.
(Her name was Er-jie.) ‘Father has been longing to see you.’
Er-jie turned red.
‘Now look here, young Rong,’ she said, ‘you behave yourself! I suppose you are one
of those people who, if they don’t get a good telling-off every once in a while, don’t
feel comfortable. You are supposed to be a well-bred, educated young gentleman,
yet a coolie would have better manners.’
She picked up the nearest object to hand, which happened to be a flat-iron, and
made as if to aim it at his head. Jia Rong ducked in alarm, clasping his head in his
arms; he ducked not away from her, however, but towards her, and ended up on her
bosom, laughing and begging for mercy. At this the younger sister, San-jie, came over
and tried to fasten her nails upon his mouth.
‘We’ll tell our sister about you when she gets back.’
Jia Rong knelt between them on the kang, entreating them not to, whereupon the
two sisters collapsed in laughter.
He noticed that Erjie was eating cardamums and made a grab at them intending to
take some for himself. As he did so, Er-jie spat a chewed-up mouthful of them in his
face. Quite unperturbedly, he began licking off the particles that he could reach with
his tongue and nibbling them. This was more than even the maids could stomach.
‘Look at you, freshly in mourning and your old grannie lying there right under your
nose!’ they said. ‘These are your aunts, after all, even though they are so young: you
ought to have more respect for your mother than to treat her family like this. Wait till
we tell the Master when he gets back: he’ll give you what for!’
Temporarily abandoning his aunts, Jia Rong went over to the maids, put his arms
around two of them and began kissing them.
‘My darlings, you are so right! I shan’t interfere with them any more.’
The maids pushed him off indignantly.
‘Pig!’ The maid who said this spoke with feeling. ‘You have a wife and maids of your
own; what do you need to come bothering us for? An understanding person would
realize that this was only fun, but what about someone who didn’t know? There are
plenty of dirty-minded, gossiping busy?bodies who would be only too pleased to go
tattling about this sort of thing to the other mansion, and before you know where
you are the gossips there will be passing round the most terrible stories about us.’
‘Their household is completely separate from ours,’ said Jia Rong, ‘why should they
bother about what we do here? Anyway, they’ve got scandal enough of their own to
keep them busy! Every family history has got a few scandals in it. Look at the stories
they tell about the rulers of the Han and Tang dynasties: “Filthy Tang and stinking
Han” they say, don’t they? If even the families of emperors were like that, you can
hardly expect ours to be any different. As for the household next door: look how
strict Great-uncle She is, yet Uncle Lian still manages to get up to a few tricks with
that little chamber-wife; and look what a tough nut Aung Feng is, yet that didn’t stop
Uncle Rui thinking he could settle her business. Do you imagine I don’t know what
they get up to over there -?’
He seemed to be warming to the subject and would doubtless have treated them to
other even less edifying examples of Rong-guo depravity, had not the old lady
suddenly woken up at that point, necessitating an abrupt change of manner. At once
he dropped down on his knee and began inquiring solicitously about her health.
‘It is so good of you to have gone to all this trouble for us, Grandma,’ he said, ‘and
for Auntie Er and Auntie San to put up with so much inconvenience on our behalf.
Father and I don’t know how to thank you. I expect after this business is over we
shall all be coming round to your place and making you a kotow.’
‘Bless the boy, what eloquence!’ said the old lady, nodding appreciatively. ‘For our
own kin, though: it’s the least we could do. And how is your father?’ she asked him.
‘When did he hear the news? When did you get back?’
‘We’ve only just got back,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Father sent me on to see you immediately.
He was particularly anxious that I should persuade you to stay here until everything is
over.’
He winked at the two young aunts while he was saying this. Er-jie pretended to grind
her teeth angrily, though she was trying not to laugh.
‘Glib-tongued little ape!’ she said. ‘We’re to be kept around here as second strings
for your father, I suppose?’
‘Don’t you worry!’ said Jia Rong, his eye on the old lady. ‘My father has your
interests very much at heart. He’s been looking for years now for a couple of
well-placed, rich, handsome young husbands for my two aunties. Now he’s found
one at last - someone he met the other day on the journey.’
He was only joking, but the old lady took it all as gospel truth and asked him what the
name was of this prospective son-in-law. Er-jie, laughing, laid down her sewing and
ran across to strike him.
‘Don’t believe a word he says, Ma! He’s a wicked liar!’
Even the maids were outraged.
‘If the Lord in Heaven can hear you, you’d better watch out for the lightning!’ said
one of them.
Just then a servant entered:
‘We’ve finished all the things you told us to do, Master Rong. Will you go back now
and tell the Master it’s all ready?’
Off went Jia Rong then, smiling all over his face.
But what happened after that will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 64

Five fair women make subjects for
a chaste maid’s verse
And nine jade dragons make a
love-gift for a flirt



As soon as Jia Rong learned that evening was ready, he returned to the temple and
reported to his father to that effect. At once preparations for the procession into the
city were put in motion. Bearers were organized, insignia, funeral banners and all the
other paraphernalia got ready overnight, and messengers hurriedly sent out to
relations and friends telling them when the procession would set out: five o’clock on
the morn?ing of the fourth.
The procession, needless to say, was of dazzling magnificence, and troops of
mourners took part in it. It provoked varying reactions from the crowd numbering
many thousands who lined the road to watch it, all the way from the Temple of the
Iron Threshold to the gates of Ning-guo House. Some took a simple pleasure in the
spectacle; others admired the wealth which had created it; but there were also a few
sour-faced Confucian scholars who looked down their noses and muttered something
about sumptuousness being no substitute for grief. A buzz of discussion followed its
passing all along the route.
The procession reached the mansion at about three in the afternoon; the coffin was
deposited in its shrine in the main hall; offerings were made; the lament was raised.
After that the mourners began gradually to depart. Only those members of the Jia
clan remained who had undertaken to lend the family a hand with the reception.
Among relations not of the Jia sur?name the only one to stay behind was Lady Xing’s
brother, Xing De-quan.
As long as there were visitors around, convention obliged Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong
to remain in appropriately grief-stricken attitudes beside the coffin, conforming, as
far as possible, to the scriptural canons on mourning which enjoin the bereaved son,
among other things, to ‘lie upon rushes with a sod of earth for his pillow’; but as
soon as the last guest had gone, they were off like a shot to enjoy the society of their
young female relations inside.
Throughout this period Bao-yu too was expected to put on mourning and go over
every day to Ning-guo House to spend the whole day there beside the coffin. Xi-feng
was not well enough to go over daily, but on days when there were sutra-readings
and the callers were numerous, she would drag herself over and lend You-shi a hand
in entertaining the wives.
One morning after the early offering, when Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong, worn out by a
succession of short nights and long, exhausting days, lay dozing beside the coffin,
Bao-yu thought that as there were no visitors he might just as well go back home and
see Dai-yu. Calling at Green Delights on the way, he found the courtyard silent and
deserted. In the coolness of the surrounding gallery a few old women and junior
maids were sitting or lying about in various postures of sleep. He had no wish to
disturb them, and would have made his way into the house alone; but just as he was
approaching the doorway, Number Four caught sight of him and started up,
intending to raise the blind for him to enter. She had not time to do so however, for
at that very moment Parfumée came rushing out and very nearly ran into him. She
checked her?self just in time.
‘What are you doing here?’ There was an expression of pleased surprise on her face.
‘Don’t let Skybright get me! She’s trying to hit me.’
Inside the room there was a clatter of numerous tiny objects striking the floor and a
moment later Skybright burst through the doorway in pursuit.
‘Where are you, you little wretch? If you’ve lost, you have to have a slap. It’s no
good running to Bao-yu to protect you: he isn’t here today.’
Bao-yu laughingly intercepted her.
‘She’s only little. I don’t know how she’s offended you, but won’t you forgive her for
my sake?’
Bao-yu’s sudden appearance at that moment was so unexpected that Skybright
found it comical.
‘Parfumée must be a little witch! I wouldn’t have thought even magic spells could
bring someone so quickly! Well, I don’t care!’ she said, having recovered somewhat
from her surprise. ‘Magic or no magic, I’m going to get her!’
She wrested the arm free that Bao-yu was holding and darted at Parfumée; but
Parfumée dodged behind Bao-yu’s back and clung to him. Bao-yu took Skybright by
one hand and Parfumée by the other and walked with them into the room. There, on
the kang under the west wall, Musk, Ripple, Emerald and Swallow sat playing dibs:
melon-seeds for winners and slaps for losers. Parfumée had lost to Skybright and run
out to avoid the slap. The clattering noise that Bao-?yu had heard was the sound of
dib-stones falling from Skybright’s lap when she got up to chase her. Bao-yu surveyed
the scene approvingly.
‘I thought you’d be a bit quiet here with me away,’ he said. ‘And as the days are so
long now, I was afraid you might be going to sleep after lunch and making yourselves
ill. I’m glad you’ve found a way of keeping yourselves amused - Where’s Aroma?’ he
asked, suddenly noticing that she was not with them.
‘Oh, Aroma,’ said Skybright. ‘Aroma’s gone religious. She’s sitting on her own in the
next room like Bodhidharma with her face to the wall. I haven’t dared disturb her so I
haven’t the least idea what she’s doing. Whatever it is, she’s being very quiet about it.
You’d better go in and have a look: perhaps she’s attained Enlightenment!’
Bao-yu laughed and went into the inner room. He found Aroma sitting on the couch
by the window making knots in a length of grey silk cord. She rose to her feet as he
entered.
‘What lies has that wretch Skybright been telling about me? I wanted to get on with
this knotting, that’s what I came in here for. I hadn’t got time to fool about with the
others, so I pretended that I wanted to take advantage of your being away by sitting
here quietly on my own and meditating for a bit. Bodhidharma, indeed! I’ll pinch that
girl’s mouth!’
Bao-yu laughed and sat down beside her to watch her knot.
‘The days are so long now, you ought to take a break of some kind. If you don’t
fancy playing with the others, why not come with me to see Cousin Lin? Surely it’s
much too hot for knotting?’
‘I noticed that you’re still wearing that old black fan-cover we made for you when
you went into mourning for Mrs Rong. As long as you were only wearing it once or
twice a year, it didn’t seem worth the trouble of replacing it; but now that you have
to wear summer mourning every day at the other House, I thought it was high time I
made you a new one. As soon as I’ve finished this cord for it, you can take the old
one off and put it on. I know you don’t care very much about this sort of thing, but if
Her Old Ladyship were to see you wearing the old one when she got back, she’d be
sure to blame me for neglecting you. She’d say I was too lazy even to notice what you
were wearing.’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘It’s very nice of you to have thought about it. But don’t drive yourself too hard. You
don’t want to give yourself a heat stroke.’
At that moment Parfumée came in carrying a cup of water?-cooled tea for him on a
tray. Because as a little boy he had been delicate, Bao-yu was never given ice-cold tea
to drink in summer. To cool his tea they plunged the tea-pot into a basin of water
freshly drawn from the well. The water was changed several times until the tea inside
the pot, though not chilled, had reached a pleasant freshness. He drank half the
contents of the cup while Parfumée held it to his lips, then turned his head back
again to address Aroma.
‘I told Tealeaf when I left that if anyone important turns up at Cousin Zhen’s, he is
to let me know immediately; otherwise I shan’t be going back there.’
He got up to go. As he was leaving the house, he called back to Emerald and the
others in the outer room:
‘If I’m wanted for anything, you’ll find me at Miss Lin’s.’
On his way there, just as he was about to cross Drenched Blossoms Bridge, he came
upon Snowgoose followed by two old women carrying an assortment of caltrops,
melons and lotus-roots.
‘What are they for?’ Bao-yu asked her. ‘I know your mistress never eats that sort of
thing. Is she expecting Mrs Zhu or someone?’
‘If I tell you, you mustn’t let on when you see her,’ said Snowgoose.
Bao-yu nodded.
‘You can go on ahead and give that stuff to Miss Nightingale,’ Snowgoose said to
the two women. ‘If she asks you why I’m not with you, tell her I’m doing something
and I’ll be back directly.’
The women made some reply and continued on their way. Snowgoose waited until
they were out of earshot.
‘The Mistress has been feeling a bit better this last day or two. But when Miss Tan
looked in after lunch today and wanted her to go with her to call on Mrs Lian, she
wouldn’t go. She appeared to be thinking about something and had a little cry. Then
presently she picked up her writing-brush and did a lot of writing - poetry I think. She
told me to send out for some melons and things. While I did that, she said,
Nightin?gale was to clear the qin-table in the inner room, move it into the outside
room, and put the dragon incense-burner on it. She said she’d tell us what to do with
the melons when I got back. If she’s planning to entertain someone, I don’t see what
she wants the incense-burner for - certainly not for burning incense in, because she
doesn’t like incense as a rule. She likes to have fresh flowers and fruit and gourds
about her but not incense because she doesn’t like the smell of it in her clothes.
Anyway, if she does want to burn some, why not in the inner room, where she
spends all her time? Unless it’s because the old women have made the outer room a
bit smelly and she’s burning it to get rid of the smell. The fact is, I really don’t know.
You’ll have to go and find out for yourself.’
While she was speaking, Bao-yu had unconsciously lowered his head.
‘From what Snowgoose says,’ he thought, ‘there must be some other reason for
this. She wouldn’t have things put out specially if she were merely entertaining one
of the girls. Perhaps today is the anniversary of Aunt Lin’s death. No, just a bit: it can’t
be. When it is, Grandma always sends her the stuff for the offering and she’s done
that already this year. Perhaps it’s for a seasonal offering. Perhaps she’s been reading
the Doctrine of the Mean:
In each season of the year ... offer things seasonable
It’s possible. If I go and see her now, when she is feeling upset, I am sure to want to
talk her out of it and shall probably only succeed in causing her to suppress her grief.
On the other hand, if I don’t go, then with no one there to stop her, she may simply
go on getting more and more upset. Either way will be bad for her. The best thing will
be for me to go and see Cousin Feng first, sit with her for a bit, and look in at Cousin
Lin’s on my way back. Then, if she is still upset, I shall try to find some means of
consoling her. In that way I shall be able to prevent her grief from getting out of hand,
though at the same time she will have had a chance of giving it expression, so that
there will be no danger of its being unhealthily repressed.’
Having come to this decision, he let Snowgoose go on to the Naiad’s House alone and
made his way out of the Garden to Xi-feng’s place. He arrived just as a number of
women-servants who had been reporting on household matters were leaving. Xi-feng
herself was leaning inside the gateway talking to Patience. She smiled at Bao-yu as
she saw him come.
‘You’ve come back, then? I’ve just this moment been telling Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife to
send someone over to the other place to tell your pages that if you don’t appear to
be doing anything they ought to slip in and ask you to come back here for a rest. I
was afraid that in this hot weather with so many people milling around there, you
might find the sweaty smells a bit too much for you. But you’ve come back anyway,
so I needn’t have bothered.’
‘Thank you for the kind thought, though,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I decided to come back here
partly because there was nothing there for me to do, but also because I noticed that
you haven’t been over there for some days and I wanted to see if you were all right.
How are you feeling lately?’
‘Oh, still pretty much the same,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Still up one day and down the next.
Now that Grandmother and your mother are away, those senior women are getting
quite out of hand, fighting or quarrelling about something or other every day. We’ve
even had cases of gambling and thieving recently. Of course, your sister is a great
help; but she’s a young unmarried girl and there are certain things she can’t be told
about. When they crop up, I have to struggle out of bed and deal with them myself.
So I don’t really get a lot of rest. Under the circumstances there’s not much prospect
yet of getting better: all I can hope is that I shan’t get any worse!’
‘I know. But you’ve got to look after yourself,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You must try not to
worry so much.’
He chatted with her a little longer before going back into the Garden. Arriving at the
Naiad’s House, he could see the remains of incense smoke as he entered the
courtyard gate. In the outer room there was a wet patch on the flagstones where a
libation had been poured, and Nightingale was super?vising the removal of the
qin-table to the inside room and the replacement of various other objects and bits of
furniture. Concluding that the little service (if that is what it had been) must just be
over, he went inside. Dai-yu was lying down with her face to the wall. She looked ill
and exhausted. At the sound of Nightingale’s ‘Master Bao, Miss’, she raised herself
wearily, though with a smiling face, and invited him to sit by her.
      ‘How have you been these last few days, coz?’ he said. ‘You look a bit calmer
than you did, but something seems to have been upsetting you.’
‘I can’t imagine why you should say so,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I am perfectly all right.’
‘How can you expect me to believe that?’ said Bao-yu. ‘The tears are still wet on
your face. You should learn to take things a bit easier. It is bad for a person who has
so much illness to be constantly indulging in grief. If you end up by undermiring your
health; I-’
     The realization that what he was about to say was probably something that
ought not to be said caused the words to stick in his throat. For although, from the
fact that he and Dai-yu had grown up together, there existed a most perfect
sympathy between them, although there was nothing in the world that either of
them wanted more than to live and die in each other’s company, the understanding
that this was so was a wordless one which had never been expressed. In the past,
because Dai-yu was so sensitive, words had all too often proved a stumbling-block.
And now today, when the whole point of his coming here was to comfort her, here he
was again, on the point of saying something that would offend her! Finding that he
could not go on, a sort of panic gripped him. He feared he was going to make her
angry; and yet he so desperately wanted to help her. As he thought about it, the
panic gave way to a feeling of helpless sadness and he began to cry.
Dai-yu, sensing that he was about to make one of those extravagant statements that
she always found so irritating, had indeed been on the point of getting angry; but
when she saw his internal struggle and the tears which followed it, she felt not angry
with him but moved, and being herself of a tearful disposition, was soon sitting there
in silence and weeping with him for company. To Nightingale, who came in at that
moment with some tea, it appeared as if they must have been having a quarrel.
      ‘Just when Miss Lin is getting along nicely,’ she said to Bao-?yu with some
asperity, ‘what do you mean by coming along here and upsetting her?’
      Bao-yu laughed and wiped his eyes.
      ‘I’ve done no such thing.’
      To cover up his embarrassment, he got up and began pacing about the room. In
doing so, he caught sight of a sheet of paper sticking out from underneath Dai-yu’s
inkstone. The temptation to reach out and pick it up proved irresistible, and before
Dai-yu could get up and snatch it from him, he had put it in the bosom of his gown.
     ‘Let me read it, Dai!’
     ‘Whatever you come here about,’ said Dai-yu, ‘you always seem to end up by
nosing through my papers.’
     Bao-chai came in while she was speaking.
     ‘What is it you want to read, cousin?’ she asked Bao-yu.
     Bao-yu still had no idea what the piece of paper contained, and because he was
uncertain what Dai-yu’s feelings would be about his reading it, he hesitated to
answer Bao-chai’s question for fear of giving Dai-yu offence. He therefore smiled and
said nothing, while all the time his eyes rested on Dai-yu questioningly. Dai-yu smiled
at Bao-chai and invited her to be seated.
‘I’ve been looking at some lives of famous women,’ said Dai-yu, ‘all of them women
who are famous in history for their beauty or intelligence. There was so much I found
moving - heartening and admirable in some cases, tragic and deplorable in others -
that after lunch today, having nothing better to do, I decided to make a selection of
them and try writing poems about them in which some of those feelings could be
expressed. Then Tan-chun came in and asked me to go with her to see Cousin Feng,
but I didn’t feel up to it. After doing only five of the poems I had planned, I suddenly
felt too tired to go on and left them lying there on the table, little thinking that
Master Bao would come along and dis?cover them. I wouldn’t really mind his seeing
them if it weren’t for the fear that he might go copying them out and showing them
to other people.’
‘When did I ever do such a thing?’ said Bao-yu indignantly. ‘If you’re referring to the
White Crab-flower poems on that fan, I wrote them on it myself in small kai-shu
characters merely for the convenience of always having them by me when I wanted
to look at them. I fully realize that poems written in the privacy of the women’s
quarters are not lightly to be passed around outside. Ever since you spoke to me
about it, I have been careful not to carry that fan with me anywhere but inside the
Garden.’
‘Cousin Lin is right to be worried,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Now that the poems are written
on that fan, there is always the possibility that you might one day forget and carry it
with you to your room outside. Suppose Uncle’s literary gentlemen were to see it
there, they would be sure to ask you who the poems were by. If as a result of that
they were to become public property, it would be extremely unpleasant for us. “A
stupid woman is a virtuous one”: that is what the old proverb says. A girl’s first
concern is to be virtuous, her second is to be industrious. She may write poetry if she
likes as a diversion, but it is an accomplishment she could just as well do without. The
last thing girls of good family need is a literary reputation.’ She paused and gave
Dai-yu a smile. ‘There would be no harm in letting me see them of course. The
important thing is not to allow Cousin Bao to go off with them.’
‘In the light of what you have just been saying,’ said Dai-yu drily, ‘I’m not at all sure
that I ought to let you look at them either. Anyway,’ she pointed to Bao-yu, ‘he’s
already got them.’
Bao-yu assumed from her tone that he might read them. Extracting the paper from
the inside pocket of his gown, he drew up close to Bao-chai so that the two of them
could peruse it together. This is what they read.
Xi Shi
That kingdom-quelling beauty dissolved like the flower of foam.
In the foreign palace, Xi Shi, did you yearn for your old home?
Who laughs at your ugly neighbour with her frown-and-simper now,
Still steeping her yam at the brook-side, and the hair snow-white on her brow?
*
Yu Ji
The very crows are grieving as they caw in the cold night air.
She faces her beaten Tyrant King with a haggard look of despair:
‘Let the others wait for the hangman, to be hacked and quartered and rent;
‘Better the taste of one’s own steel in the decent dark of a tent.’
*
Lady Bright
To a loveliness that dazzled, the palace of Han showed the door;
For ‘the fair are mostly ill-fated’, as has been said often before.
Yet it seems strange that an emperor - even one with such tepid views –
Should abandon his eyes’ own judgement and let a painter choose!

Green Pearl
Pebble or pearl - to Shi Chong it was only a rich man’s whim:
Do you really believe your undoubted charms meant so very much to him?
It was fate, from some past life preordained, that made him take his rash stand,
And the craving to have a companion in death’s dark, silent land.

She marked the firm, courteous protest, the well-phrased confident plan,
And, under the unsuccessful clerk, saw the essential Man.
The great Yang Su in her eyes was finished from that hour:

After praising the poems enthusiastically, Bao-yu suggested that, as there were five
of them, a good collective title would be ‘Songs for Five Fair Women’; and without
waiting for Dai-yu’s approval, he picked up her writing-brush and wrote it on the
left-hand side of the sheet after the poems.
‘Whatever subject one chooses for a poem,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it is important that
one’s treatment of it should be original. If one merely plods along in the footsteps of
earlier poets, it doesn’t matter how fine the language is, the lack of originality will
prevent it from being a really good poem. Thus, many poets have taken Lady Bright
as their theme, but the best ones have always contrived to give the subject a new
turn, one emphasizing the sad fate of Lady Bright herself, another the wickedness of
the painter Ma Yan-shou, another the frivolousness of the Han emperor who
employed him to paint portraits of court ladies rather than portraits of distinguished
statesmen and soldiers, and so on. Further new twists were given to this theme by
Wang An-shi:
What brush could ever capture a beauty’s breathing grace?
The painter did not merit death who botched that lovely face.
and by Ou-yang Xiu:
A prince so ill able to control what went on under his nose
Must hope in vain to impose his rule on remote barbarian foes.
Cousin Lin shows the same originality as these two poets, by presenting each of her
subjects in a novel and interesting light -’
Before she could continue with her disquisition, a servant came in to announce that
Jia Lian was back. His arrival at the Ning mansion had been reported some time ago
and he was expected any moment at Rong-guo House. Bao-yu at once got up and,
hurrying out to the front part of the mansion, waited inside the main gate for his
cousin to arrive. He did not have to wait long. Within moments Jia Lian was
dis?mounting from his horse and stepping through the gateway. Bao-yu advanced to
meet him, touched hand and knee to the ground in greeting, and wished good health,
first, as was good manners, to his grandmother and mother, from whom Jia Lian had
come, and then to Jia Lian himself. The cousins then went inside together, hand in
hand. Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao?-chai, Dai-yu, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun were
already waiting for Jia Lian in the hall. After each of them had greeted him
individually, he gave them his news.
‘Grandmother will be arriving here early tomorrow. She’s been keeping very well
on the journey. Today she sent me on ahead to make sure that everything here is all
right. I shall be leaving again tomorrow at four o’clock in the morning and going out
of the city to meet her.’
They asked him a few questions about the journey, but because they knew how tired
he must be after so much travel, soon left him so that he could go back to his own
room and get some rest. About the remainder of that day our narrative is silent.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang arrived home round about lunchtime the following
day. When the initial greetings were over, the old lady sat for a while and sipped a
cup of tea before taking Lady Wang and the others with her to Ning-guo House. A
great wailing rose up as she arrived. Jia She and Jia Lian had gone there after seeing
the old lady home, and as she and her party entered the room in which the coffin
stood, the two of them advanced to meet her at the head of a number of weeping
clansmen, and supported her one on each side as she ap?proached the coffin. At the
foot of it Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong knelt down, pressing their heads against her skirts
and weeping piteously. To people of advancing years even simulated grief is
distressing, and Grandmother Jia, an arm about each head, wept very bitterly herself,
Jia She and Jia Lian did their best to comfort her, and at last, when her grief had
some?what abated, she moved on, to the right of the coffin-screens, where You-shi
and her daughter-in-law were waiting for her. Here there was more clinging and
weeping, after which those present came forward one by one to salute Grandmother
Jia and welcome her in a more normal fashion.
Cousin Zhen, fearing that Grandmother Jia, who had still not rested properly after her
tiring journey, would become distressed if she were to sit much longer in such
melancholy surroundings, strongly urged her not to stay. When at last he had
prevailed on her to go and she was back in her own apartment at Rong-guo House, it
became evident that the shock of mourning, following so soon upon the discomforts
of travel, had indeed had an adverse effect on her ageing con?stitution. By nightfall
she was showing all the symptoms of incipient illness: heaviness in the head, a
constricted feeling in the chest, a blocked-up nose and hoarseness of the voice. The
doctor was summoned immediately and half that night and the whole of the
following day taken up with consulta?tions, prescriptions and the preparation and
administering of medicine. Fortunately the illness had not yet established itself in her
system and responded rapidly to treatment. There was a slight outbreak of
perspiration round about midnight of the second night and after that her pulse and
temperature both returned to normal. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief; though to
be on the safe side they kept up the dosage for another day.
A few days later it was Jia Jing's 'funeral' - in this case no more than the re-depositing
of his coffin in the family temple. Grandmother Jia was still not well enough to take
part; Bao-yu stayed at home to look after his grandmother; and Xi-?feng was still
insufficiently recovered. Apart from them, all the other members of the Rong-guo
family, Jia She, Jia Lian, Lady Xing and Lady Wang, together with all the men- and
women-servants of their households, accompanied their Ning?-guo cousins to the
Temple of the Iron Threshold. They were back again that evening; but Cousin Zhen,
You-shi and Jia Rong stayed on at the temple for the Hundred Days, at the end of
which Jia Jing was to be taken to his final resting-place in Nanking. Old Mrs You and
her two daughters remained all this while at the Ning-guo mansion to keep an eye on
things.
Jia Lian had heard a good deal in the past about these two step-sisters of You-shi,
though, to his great regret, he had never until very recently had an opportunity of
meeting them. The opportunity had presented itself on the occasion of Jia Jing's
removal into the city. Since then they had become fairly well acquainted.
Acquaintanceship in his case (Jia Lian being what he was) had been accompanied by
the first stirrings of lust. He felt encouraged by an unsavoury rumour he had heard to
the effect that his cousins Zhen and Rong, both father and son, had at one time or
another enjoyed the sisters' favours. Whenever he had a chance to, he flirted or
made eyes at them - unsuccessfully in San-jie's case, for she met all his advances with
indifference, but with a more promising reaction from her sister. Unfortunately, with
so many pairs of eyes watching, he could not follow up his success, apart from which
he was a little scared that Cousin Zhen might be jealous. Between him and Er-jie it
could be said that there was a silent understanding; but for the time being there
could be nothing more.
This all changed after the funeral. Then, at Ning-guo House, apart from Mrs You and
the two sisters and a few maids and older women employed to do the rough work,
hardly anyone from the master apartment was left behind. All the personal maids,
parlour maids and concubines stayed with their master and mistress at the temple.
As for the married servants, their activities were confined to keeping watch at night
and minding the gates by day; and since they had their own quarters outside, they
had no reason to go inside the house except when they were on duty. This seemed to
Jia Lian to be an excellent time to act. A pretended wish to keep Cousin Zhen
company at the temple gave him an excuse for absenting himself fr6m his own house,
whilst the pretext of attending to household matters on Cousin Zhen's behalf
enabled him to make several trips back to Ning-guo House, thus providing him with
further opportunities for pursuing his flirtation with Er-jie.
One day Yu Lu, a junior steward from Ning-guo House, came out to see Cousin Zhen
about some business.
‘The total cost of the procession, including funeral furnishings and hire of labour,
was one thousand one hundred and ten taels. Of that, five hundred taels have
already been paid, leaving six hundred and ten taels outstanding. Yesterday I had the
managers of both agencies round asking me for the rest of the money. I thought I’d
better see you about it and ask you what I’m to do.’
‘Why didn’t you go straight to the counting-house and draw what’s wanted?’ said
Cousin Zhen. ‘I don’t see why you should need to come bothering me about it.,
‘I did go to the counting-house, sir,’ said Yu Lu, ‘but since Sir Jing passed away they
have already paid out so much that they’ve barely got enough left to pay for the
Hundred Days services and the expenses of your stay here in the temple. They
couldn’t pay these bills without eating into what has been earmarked for something
else. That’s why I’ve come out to see you. I wondered whether you would want me
to pay them out of your personal account, or whether there’s some other account
you could transfer the money from. If you will let me know what you want me to do,
I’ll go ahead and do it.’
Cousin Zhen laughed.
‘The days when we had money lying around unused in private accounts have long
since passed. You’ll have to borrow the money where you can.’
It was Yu Lu’s turn to laugh.
‘If it were one hundred or two hundred taels, sir, I might be able to manage
something; but five or six hundred? Where would I get a sum like that at short
notice?’
After thinking for a bit, Cousin Zhen turned to Jia Rong:
‘Go to your mother, Rong, and ask her for that five hundred taels the Zhens of
Nanking sent us after the funeral. It hasn’t been handed in to the counting-house yet.
And ask her to have a rake-around and see if she can’t raise the whole sum.’
Jia Rong hurried off. In a very short time he was back again with his mother’s answer.
‘Mother says two hundred of the five hundred has already been spent. She sent the
remaining three hundred back home for Grandmother You to take care of.’
‘In that case,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘you’d better go back with Yu Lu to ask her for it
and let him have it. While you’re about it, you’ll be able to see if everything at home
is all right. And of course give my regards to your aunts. Yu Lu, you’ll have to raise the
rest of the money as best you can by borrowing.’
Jia Rong and Yu Lu promised to do his bidding, but just as they were about to
withdraw Jia Lian walked into the room. Yu Lu stepped up to him smartly and
dropped him a salute.
‘What’s happened?’ said Jia Lian.
Cousin Zhen proceeded to explain to him why Yu Lu was there. As he did so, it
occurred to Jia Lian that this would be a good opportunity of going to the Ning-guo
mansion and looking up Er-jie again.
‘It seems a pity to go straining one’s credit for so trifling a sum,’ he said. ‘I had a
little windfall the other day that I haven’t made use of yet. Why don’t I let him have
that to add to your three hundred and save him the trouble of borrow?ing?’
‘That will be splendid,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Perhaps you will authorize Rong to pick it
up then, when he goes to collect the three hundred?’
‘I think it will be necessary to go for it myself,’ said Jia Lian hurriedly. ‘In any case I
haven’t been home for some days. I really ought to drop in and pay my respects to
Grandmother and Lady Wang and my parents. I shall be able to look in at your place
too, Zhen, and make sure that your servants are behaving themselves. And pay my
respects to your mother?-in-law, of course.’
‘It means imposing on you once again,’ said Cousin Then, smiling. ‘I don’t know
whether I should let you.’
‘For goodness’ sake!’ said Jia Lian. ‘One’s own cousin!’
‘Go with your uncle, then,’ Cousin Zhen instructed Jia Rong, ‘and when you see
Lady Jia and the other ladies and Sir She to make your bow to them, remember to say
that your mother and I send them our regards. And don’t forget to ask whether Lady
Jia is quite better yet and whether or not she is still taking medicine.’
Having ‘yessir’-ed each one of these commands, Jia Rong followed his Uncle Lian
outside. The two of them then took horse and, accompanied by Yu Lu and several
pages, all on horseback, rode out towards the city. As Er-lie was very much on his
mind, Jia Lian beguiled the journey by talking to his nephew about her as they rode
along. He spoke approvingly of her good looks and gentle character. He remarked
what perfect poise she had and what a soft and pleasing way of speaking. In fact, he
concluded, everything about her excited one’s admiration and respect.
‘Everyone speaks so highly of your Aunt Feng, but to my mind she isn’t a patch on
her.’
Jia Rong understood very well where this conversation was leading them.
      ‘If you love her so much, Uncle,’ he said, ‘why not let me he your matchmaker
and arrange for you to have her as your Number Two?’
      ‘Is that a joke,’ said Jia Lian, ‘or are you in earnest?’
‘I’m being perfectly serious.’
Jia Lian laughed:
‘It’s certainly an attractive proposal. The only trouble is, I don’t think your Aunt
Feng would ever stand for it. And besides, your Grandmother You might not be
willing. And haven’t I heard somewhere that your Aunt Er is already engaged to
someone?’
‘None of these is really a problem,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Aunt Er and Aunt San, although
they took his surname, were not really my Grandpa You’s daughters. When Gran
married my Grandpa You as his second wife, she brought them with her from a
previous marriage. I’ve heard Gran say that when she was carrying Aunt Er, her first
husband had an agreement with a friend of his called Zhang, who was a manager on
one of the Imperial Farms and whose own wife was also pregnant at the time. They
agreed that if the children their wives were carrying turned out to be a boy and a girl,
they should be betrothed to each other. In that way Aunt Er was engaged to the
Zhangs’ boy from the moment she was born. Later on the Zhangs lost all their money
in a lawsuit, and Gran lost her first husband and married my Grandpa You, and for
ten or fifteen years now she hasn’t heard a word from them. She often com?plains
about the betrothal and says she wishes she could get it revoked; and Father is
anxious to betroth Aunt Er to some?one else. He’s only waiting until he has found the
right person, and then he means to find out where the Zhangs are, hand them a
small sum of money, and persuade them to sign a deed of revocation. The Zhangs are
so poor, they are hardly likely to refuse. In fact, when they’ve seen the kind of people
we are, they probably won’t dare. And whatever Father and Gran might have thought
about Aunt Er becoming a Number Two in other circumstances, I’m sure they would
have no objection in your case. The only difficulty as I see it is Aunt Feng.’
Jia Lian was so enraptured by the main part of what Jia Rong had been saying, that it
is doubtful whether he heard those last words at all. For some moments he rode on
in silence, a fatuous grin on his face. Meanwhile Jia Rong was thinking.
‘I’ll tell you what, Uncle,’ he said presently: ‘if you’ve got the nerve, there’s one way
of doing this that would be absolutely fool-proof. It would involve you in spending a
bit of money though.’
‘Never mind that, dear boy!’ said Jia Lian eagerly. ‘If you have a plan, just tell me
what it is.’
‘Don’t say anything about this when we arrive,’ said Jia Rong, ‘but wait until I have
had a chance to explain it all to Father and he can arrange it with my Gran. When it’s
all settled, buy a little house somewhere in the streets at the back of our mansion,
furnish it, install one or two married couples to look after it, and then all you have to
do is choose the day: you can marry Aunt Er then and nobody be any the wiser. Of
course, you’d have to impress on the servants that they are not to let on about it; but
provided they don’t talk, there’s no reason why Aunt Feng tucked away in the inner
courtyards should ever hear about it. And by the time you’ve been living together for
a year or two, you ought to be able to ride the storm out even if your secret is blown.
You’d have to face an explosion from Sir She, of course; but you can tell him that you
did it for the family, because Aunt Feng is unable to have a son. And as for Aunt Feng
herself, when she sees that the rice is cooked and knows that it can’t be uncooked,
she’ll have to put up with it. That only leaves the old lady to square, and you should
be able to do that easily enough with a bit of coaxing.’
There is an old saying, ‘Desire maketh the wise man a fool’. Jia Lian was so intoxicated
by his desire for Er-jie that Jia Rong’s idiotic plan struck him as unassailable. The fact
that he was in mourning, the fact that a secret marriage of the kind he was
contemplating was bigamous and illegal, the fact that he had an extremely strict
father and an exceptionally jealous wife - all those things which ought to have given
him pause were lightly brushed aside. Nor did it occur to him that Jia Rong’s counsel
was by no means disinterested. Jia Rong had designs upon Er-jie himself, to which the
presence of his father, when they were all together in the same house; was an
impediment. If Jia Lian married Er-jie, she would have to live outside, and there
would be unlimited opportunities for larks with her whenever Jia Lian was away.
Blind to all this, Jia Lian thanked Jia Rong profusely and promised him a suitable
reward.
       ‘If you can really arrange this for me, dear boy, I’ll buy you a pair of the prettiest
little girls who are to be had and make you a present of them!’
       They were by now approaching the gates of Ning-guo House.
       ‘You go in here and ask my Gran for the money to give to Yu Lu, Uncle. I’m going
on to the other House to pay my respects to the old lady.’
Jia Lian smiled and nodded.
‘When you see her, don’t let on that I came here with you, will you?’
‘All right,’ said Jia Rong; then, leaning over, he added in a low voice in his uncle’s ear:
‘If you should happen to see Aunt Er today, don’t let impatience get the better of you!
A scandal now will make it harder to arrange things later.’
‘Cheeky devil!’ said Jia Lian laughing. ‘Go on, be on your way now! I’ll be waiting for
you here.
While Jia Rong went on to the Rong mansion alone, Jia Lian turned into the gateway
of Ning-guo House. The men-servants temporarily in charge there were waiting
inside the gate to welcome him, with the other servants all lined up behind them.
They clustered round him as he made his way up to the hall. There, for form’s sake,
he asked them a few per?functory questions before dismissing them and continuing
on his way to the inner apartments.
As cousins and intimates having no secrets from one another, Cousin Zhen and Jia
Lian had always felt free to come and go in each other’s apartments without
formality, and so, when Jia Lian approached the main sitting-room of Cousin Zhen’s
apartment, the old women at the door simply raised the portiere for him and let him
go in unannounced.
Looking round him as he entered, Jia Lian saw only Er-?jie and a couple of maids
sewing together on the kang at the southern end of the room. The mother and the
other sister were not in evidence. He went up and greeted her. In response to her
smiling invitation to join her, he climbed up and sat with his back resting against the
openwork partition along the eastern side of the kang, insisting that Er-jie should
take the place of honour. After a few generalities, he asked her where Mrs You and
San-jie were.


‘Just gone out the back to see about something,’ said Er-jie. ‘They’ll be here again
in a moment.’
The maids now went outside to fetch tea, leaving the two of them alone together. Jia
Lian ogled Er-jie meaningfully, but she merely smiled, keeping her eyes demurely
downwards, and pretended not to notice. At this stage, he judged; a physical advance
would be premature. He noticed that as she sat there her hands were continuously
playing with a length of silk handkerchief to which a tiny embroidered bag was
attached. To fill in the embarrassed silence that was developing, he pretended to be
feeling for something at his waist.
‘Oh, I’ve come out without my betel! Give me some betel, my dear, if you’ve got
any.’
‘I have got some,’ said Er-jie, ‘but it’s not for other people.’
Jia Lian laughed and made a movement towards her, as if he intended to snatch the
handkerchief and its little pouch from her by force, whereupon Er-jie, rather than risk
someone coming in and finding them in the midst of an unseemly tussle, threw it
across to him with a little laugh. Jia Lian caught it in mid-air, emptied the contents
into the palm of his hand, selected one single half-eaten nut which he popped into
his mouth and began chewing, and stuffed all the rest back into the bag. He was just
going to hand it back to her when the two maids came in again with the tea. Jia Lian
took a cup from one of them and began sipping it. While the maids were not looking,
he contrived to unfasten a Han jade girdle pend?ant in the form of nine tiny
interlocking dragons that he wore attached to his belt, tie it onto the handkerchief
and toss it back for Er-jie to catch. But Er-jie pretended not to have noticed. She
allowed the handkerchief with the two small objects attached to it to fall beside her
on the kang and went on calmly sipping her tea.
Just then there was a rattle of the portiere and old Mrs You and San-jie came into the
room from the back, attended by two little maids. Jia Lian signalled with his eyes to
Er-jie that she should pick the handkerchief up, but Er-jie continued to ignore him. In
somewhat of a panic by now and wondering what Er-jie could be at, he rose to his
feet arid advanced to meet San-jie and the old lady. When, after exchanging
courtesies with them, he glanced back behind him, Er-jie was stand?ing
unconcernedly in the same place, with the same inscrut?able smile on her face; but
the handkerchief had vanished. He breathed a sigh of relief.
      When they were all seated and a few pleasantries had been exchanged between
them, Jia Lian remembered the business on which he was supposed to have come.
      ‘Zhen’s wife says that she sent a packet of silver to you the other day to look
after for her. It’s wanted now to pay some bills with, so Zhen has sent me to ask you
for it and also to find out if everything at home is all right.’
      Mrs You at once told Er-jie to take the key of the chest and fetch the money for
her.
‘I’m also glad of the opportunity my errand gives me of offering you my respects,
ma’am, and of seeing the young ladies again,’ Jia Lian continued after Er-jie had gone.
‘I must say, you are looking extremely well. But I am sorry the young ladies should
have to put up with the inconvenience of moving into a strange house.’
‘Tut, for one’s own kin!’ said Mrs You, smiling. ‘You are too polite, Mr Lian! It’s of no
consequence where we stay: one bed is as good as another. To tell you the truth,
things have been very difficult for us since Mr You passed away. If it hadn’t been for
the help given us by my daughter’s husband, I really don’t know how we should have
managed. To look after the house for him in his time of trouble is the very least we
can do in return. It can certainly not be spoken of as an incon?venience.’
     Er-jie had now returned with the silver and handed it to her mother; her mother
handed it to Jia Lian; and Jia Lian ordered one of the maids to call in one of the old
women from outside, whom he then instructed to take it to Yu Lu and tell him to wait
for him in the front.
While the old woman was going off with the money, Jia Rong’s voice could be heard
outside in the courtyard and a few moments later he appeared. He greeted his
grandmother and two aunts before turning with a smile to Jia Lian:
‘Sir She has been asking about you, Uncle. He says there’s something he wants you
to do for him. He was going to send someone to fetch you from the temple, but I told
him you were already on your way into the city. He told me that if I ran into you on
my way back, I was to tell you to hurry.’
Jia Lian hastily rose to go, but delayed to hear something that Jia Rong was saying to
Mrs You.
‘You know the other day I was telling you that Father has found a husband for Aunt
Er, Gran. In looks and build he has quite a strong resemblance to Uncle Lian. Does
that please you?’
Since he was pointing a finger at Jia Lian and simultaneously making a face at Er-jie
while he said this, the question appeared to be meant as much for Er-jie as for her
mother. If so, Er?-jie was too embarrassed to answer. Not so her sister, however.
‘Little monster!’ San-jie shouted, half angrily and half in jest. ‘Keep your dirty little
mouth shut - unless you want me to come over and shut it for you!’
Jia Rong retreated, laughing, from the room; and Jia Lian, taking a laughing farewell
of the old lady and her daughters, went out after him. He stopped in the hall again on
his way out to admonish the servants: not to gamble, not to drink, and so forth. Then,
after a private aside with Jia Rong in which he urged him to return with all speed to
the temple and speak about a certain matter to his father, he went with Yu Lu to the
other mansion and gave him the balance of the amount owing. Having dispatched Yu
Lu, he went in to see what his father wanted, and after that to Grandmother Jia’s
apartment to pay his respects. But these are formalities with which we need not
concern ourselves.
We return, then, to the Ning-guo mansion, where Jia Rong, concluding, when he saw
Yu Lu go off with Jia Lian, that there was nothing more for him to do, went back to
the inner apartments for further badinage with his young aunts before setting off
once more for the temple. It was evening when he arrived there and reported back
to his father.
‘Yu Lu got the money all right. And Lady Jia is now completely recovered. She is no
longer taking medicine.’
He availed himself of the opportunity to tell his father about Jia Lian: how, on the
journey into town, he had expressed a desire to take Er-jie as his Number Two and
how he proposed to set her up in a separate establishment, keeping Xi-feng in
ignorance of the marriage.
‘His sole reason for taking a Number Two,’ Jia Rong explained, ‘is that he wants a
son. And the reason he particularly wants Aunt Er is because he feels it would be
better to keep things in the family and have someone he knows, than risk taking
some unknown person from outside. He was very insistent that I should speak to you
about this.’
He omitted to mention that he was the author of this plan.
Cousin Zhen, after reflecting on it, seemed well disposed.
‘Actually, it’s not a bad idea. I wonder whether your Aunt Er would be willing,
though. You’d better go in again tomorrow and have a word with your Grandmother
You. Tell her to talk to your Aunt Er about it and see if she accepts. If she does, we
can go ahead and fix it up properly.’
After a good deal more advice to Jia Rong on how he was to conduct himself, Cousin
Zhen went inside to see You-shi and told her about the plan. You-shi could see at
once that it would not work and did her best to dissuade him; but Cousin Zben’s
mind was made up; and in the end, since she was accustomed to giving in to him,
and since Er-jie was in any case only a step-sister, for whom therefore she felt only
limited responsi?bility, she allowed the menfolk to go ahead and washed her hands
of the whole affair.
Jia Rong went into town next morning and told his grandmother what his father had
told him to say. He also added a good deal of his own. He told her what a capital
person Jia Lian was; how Xi-feng was ill and not expected to get better; how Jia Lian
was planning to buy a house outside and install Er-jie in it temporarily, but how in a
year or two, as soon as Xi-feng was dead, he would move her inside and make her his
Number One. He went on to tell her about the gifts Cousin Zhen would give for the
betrothal and of the wedding presents that Jia Lian was planning for his bride; how
Jia Lian was prepared to look after Mrs You in her old age; and how in due course he
would see San-jie provided with a husband. The Liang dynasty preacher on whom the
heavens rained down flowers could not have spoken with greater eloquence. Mrs You
could hardly fail to agree, particularly in view of the fact that she depended on
Cousin Zhen for her livelihood and that it was he who was sponsoring the marriage.
And Jia Lian was such a fine young gentleman - infinitely superior to that Zhang boy.
She would go to Er-jie at once and talk it over with her.
You Er-jie was a highly impressionable young woman. Already, in the past, she had
compromised herself with her sister’s husband. And she had always resented the
arbitrary betrothal to Zhang Hua (as the Zhangs’ boy was called) which seemed to
condemn her to a lifetime of poverty. If Jia Lian loved her and her brother-in-law was
prepared to give her away, what possible objection could she have to the marriage?
Her consent was given with a nod, conveyed at once to Jia Rong by her mother, and
in due course reported to Cousin Zhen.
Next day Cousin Zhen invited Jia Lian to the temple to hear from his own lips that
Mrs You had consented. Jia Lian, delighted that the matter had been settled with so
little trouble, at once began discussing what to do. Agents had to be engaged to look
round for a suitable house, jewellery for Er-jie’s trousseau had to be ordered, and
furnishings had to be pur?chased for the house. Within a few days all this had been
done. A twenty-frame house in Little Flower Lane about two thirds of a mile north of
Two Dukes Street had been bought, fur?nished throughout, and two little maids
purchased to go with it.
Jia Lian was at first uncertain what to do about older servants. If he used servants
from his own household, their transfer was sure to be detected; on the other hand a
married couple purchased from outside would be strangers, and therefore of
uncertain loyalty and impossible to trust. Suddenly he remembered Bao Er, whose
unfortunate wife had hanged herself after being attacked by Xi-feng in a fit of jealous
rage. At the time Jia Lian had given him some money and promised him a new wife.
The wife he had eventually chosen for him was none other than the Mattress,
widowed since the drunken cook ‘Droopy’ Duo had finally drunk himself to death.
Bao Er had had prior experience of her charms and knew that he was getting a good
bargain; and the Mattress for her part was glad to be married to someone who
(thanks to Jia Lian’s subvention) could afford to be free with his money. This couple,
united in their loyalty to Jia Lian and dislike of Xi-feng, seemed an ideal choice for the
new establishment and were to their immense satisfaction installed in it, along with
the newly-?purchased maids, to be at Er-jie’s disposal when she arrived.
There remained only the matter of Zhang Hua to be dealt with. It was Zhang Hua’s
grandfather who had originally held the managerial post on one of the Imperial
Farms. His father simply inherited the post when the old man died. While holding it,
he had made the arrangement with Mrs You’s first husband, who was his good friend,
as a result of which Zhang Hua and Er-jie were engaged to each other from their
earliest infancy. Some time after that he lost all his possessions in a lawsuit and the
family were reduced to penury so dire that even food and clothing were a problem,
and taking on a new daughter-in-law was, for the time being, wholly out of the
question. Then Er-jie’s mother had remarried, and for fourteen years or more they
had been completely out of touch. Their whereabouts were eventually traced,
however, and Zhang Hua’s father summoned to Ning-guo House and induced to sign
a deed of revocation releasing Er-jie from her betrothal. He did not want to sign it,
but was too intimidated by Cousin Zhen’s air of affluence and authority to object.
After he had signed, Mrs You handed him twenty taels, and that was that.
Everything had now been taken care of. All that remained was for Jia Lian to name
the day. The calendar was consulted and the third of the sixth month, which was just
beginning, was found to be the earliest auspicious day. On that day, it was decided,
Er-jie should be received as a bride in her new home.
But for that event you must await the following chapter.
CHAPTER 65

Jia Lian’s second marriage is
celebrated in secret
And the future marriage of San-jie
becomes a matter of speculation



By the second day of the month, the arrangements jointly agreed on by Jia Lian,
Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong had been completed and Mrs You and San-jie moved into
the new house. A brief inspection of it satisfied Mrs You that, if not quite what Jia
Rong had led her to expect, it was at least excellently furnished, and it could be said
that both she and San-jie were reasonably happy about the move. Bao Er and his
wife could not do enough for them. It was ‘yes, milady’, ‘no, milady’ whenever they
were talking to Mrs You; and San-jie, for the first time in her life, found herself being
addressed as ‘Miss You’, or sometimes even as ‘madam’.
In the last watch of that same night, only an hour or two before the dawning of the
third, Er-jie, seated in a plain chair without bridal trimmings, was carried to her new
home. The incense and paper-offerings for the ceremony, the wedding-feast and
marriage-bed had all been made ready long before she arrived. Jia Lian, also in a
small, plain carrying-chair, arrived shortly afterwards. The bride and groom made
their prostrations to Heaven and Earth, the paper offerings were set fire to, and Mrs
You conducted her heavily-veiled daughter into the marriage-chamber, gratified to
observe the transformation wrought by a completely new and expensive-looking
outfit of clothes and jewellery.
The phoenix-gambollings of the nuptial couch and the mutual delight and cherishing
which they engendered are here passed over. Suffice it to say that the more Jia Lian
saw of Er-jie, the more he loved her, until the desire to make some gesture expressive
of his feelings became overwhelming. All he could think of was to behave in every
way as if Er-jie was his only wife and Xi-feng did not exist. He ordered Bao Er and his
wife to call her ‘Mrs Lian’ and always referred to her himself in that way when he was
speaking to them. When he went back to Xi-feng, as from time to time he was
obliged to, he would tell her that he had been doing something at the Ning-guo
mansion; and Xi-feng, knowing how well her husband got on with Cousin Zhen and
how frequently he was consulted by him, suspected nothing. In spite of their
num?bers, few of the Rong-guo domestics concerned themselves much with Jia
Lian’s activities, and even the few who had the time and curiosity to nose out what
he had been up to were more anxious to win favours by playing up to him than to
gamble on the uncertain advantages of giving away his secret. Everything seemed to
be working out very smoothly and Jia Lian felt immensely grateful to Cousin Zhen for
having made it all possible.
The allowance Jia Lian made to cover the day-to-day expenses of his little household
was fifteen taels a month. On days when he was unable to come, Mrs You and her
two daughters dined together. On days when he was there, he and Er-jie would dine
together and Mrs You and San-jie would eat separately in their own room. Besides
paying Er-jie the allowance, Jia Lian handed over all his private savings to her to look
after for him. He told her everything about Xi-?feng, down to the most intimate
bedroom particulars, and promised her that as soon as Xi-feng died, she should move
into the mansion and live there openly as his wife. It cannot be said that Er-jie found
any of this displeasing. In the meantime the little household was managing very
comfortably.
*
Two months passed quickly by. One evening, as Cousin Zhen was returning from a
day of Buddhist ceremonies at the Temple of the Iron Threshold, he bethought him
that it was some considerable time since he had enjoyed the company of the two You
sisters and decided to pay them a visit. First, though, he sent a boy to the new house
to find out if Jia Lian was there. Delighted when the boy brought back word that he
was not, he ordered most of the servants to return to Ning-guo House without him,
keeping only his two most trusted pages to accompany him on foot to the Yous’
house. They did this walking one on either side of his horse’s head and holding on to
his bridle.
It was already lighting-up time when they got there, but the courtyard gate was still
open. Their arrival was so quiet and discreet that they managed to get inside it
unobserved. The pages tied the horse up in the stable and took themselves off to the
servants’ quarters to await further orders, while Cousin Zhen entered the living-room
alone. He found San-jie and her mother sitting there. The lamp had just been lit.
Shortly after he had finished exchanging greetings with them, Er-jie herself appeared
and made him welcome. Tea was served. Cousin Zhen smiled over his cup at her as
he sipped his tea.
‘Well, do you think I’d make a good marriage-broker? If the husband I picked for
you is no good, I doubt I could find you a better! Your sister will be coming to see you
shortly, by the bye, and bringing you a present.’
Er-jie had already given orders for food and wine to be brought and for the courtyard
gate to be barred. Since their visitor was a member of the family, it seemed
reasonable, that the usual restraints should be relaxed. Presently Bao Er came in with
some things and took the opportunity of offering his respects to Cousin Zhen.
‘You’re a good fellow, Bao,’ said Cousin Zhen affably. ‘I’m sure that’s why Mr Lian
chose you for this job. No doubt there will be even more important work for you in
the future. So don’t go drinking outside and getting yourself into trouble, will you? If
you do as I tell you, I promise to make it worth your while. And let me know if there’s
any?thing you want here. Mr Lian is a busy man, and not all the people in his
household are to be trusted. It’s better to ask me. He and I are not only cousins, you
know; we are also very good friends.’
‘Yes, sir. I shall do my best to give satisfaction, sir,’ said Bao Er. ‘I realize it would be
more than my life is worth to get into any trouble.’
Cousin Zhen smiled and nodded.
‘Good. As long as you know.’
For some minutes the four of them sat drinking together; but Er-jie knew that it was
not for a family evening that Cousin Zhen had come and soon found an excuse for
getting herself and her mother out of the way. She told him that she had to go to the
other side of the house for something and was afraid to do so on her own. As soon as
she and Mrs You were out of the room, Cousin Zhen drew up closer to San-jie. His
behaviour became so familiar that the two maids in attendance grew embarrassed
and slipped off to the kitchen. They were content that Cousin Zhen and San-jie
should enjoy themselves in any way they chose, provided that they did not have to
stay and watch.
Cousin Zhen’s two pages were all this time drinking with Bao Er in the kitchen, while
the Mattress stood at the stove with her back to them. When the two maids burst in
and began laughing and joking with the boys and asking to be given some wine, Bao
Er was far from pleased.
‘What are you girls doing here? You ought to be in the sitting-room. Suppose they
want service in there? There’ll be trouble.’
His wife turned round wrathfully from the stove.
‘Silly old fool! Why don’t you get your nose back into your winecup? The sooner
you’re flat on your back snoring and your little winkle tucked up out of harm’s way,
the better it’ll be for all of us! What’s it to do with you whether they want service in
there or not? I’m here to see to all that. If there’s any rain falling it won’t fall on your
head. So what are you worrying about?’
Bao Er was well aware that it was largely to his wife that he owed his favourable
position with Jia Lian. He did little himself these days but draw his pay and drink his
wine; but so exemplary was the Mattress’s service of Er-jie, that al?though Jia Lian
knew of Bao Er’s failings, he had so far refrained from taking him to task about them
out of con?sideration for her. Bao Er’s awareness of this kept him in obedient
subjection to her. And so, when he heard himself addressed by her in this way, he
merely drank a few more cups in silence and then took himself quietly off to bed.
The Mattress had a few drinks herself now with the pages and the two girls, anxious
to make herself as agreeable as possible so that the pages would give a good report
of her to Cousin Zhen. But just as this little party in the kitchen was beginning to
warm up, it was interrupted by a sudden knocking at the gate. The Mattress hurried
out and opened it as Jia Lian was dismounting from his horse. In answer to his
question whether there was anything to report, she whispered into his ear that Mr
Zhen had come and was at this very moment in the guest-room in the west courtyard.
Jia Lian went straight to his own room, where he found Er-jie sitting with her mother.
The two women seemed somewhat flustered by his arrival, but he pretended not to
notice.
‘Bring us some wine,’ he told the Mattress. ‘I think I shall have a cup or two and
then go to bed. I feel rather tired tonight.’
At once Er-jie was all over him, taking his coat, fetching him tea, asking him about his
day - in short, showering on him all those little wifely attentions which so enchanted
him. Presently the Mattress reappeared with their wine. Old Mrs You said that she
did not want any and went off to bed. The two of them sat down together to drink it.
One of the two maids, who had now been persuaded to resume their duties, came
over from the kitchen to wait on them.
Meanwhile Jia Lian’s trusty servant Rich - the only attendant he had brought with
him on this visit - had been tying his master’s horse up in the stable. Finding another
horse there already, he was able on closer inspection to identify it and to deduce
what the Mattress by her whispering had attempted to conceal from him: viz., that
Cousin Zhen was somewhere on the premises. Sure enough, on going to the kitchen
when he had finished tying up the horse, he found two of Cousin Zhen’s pages,
Happy and Lively, sitting there drinking. They, too, when they saw him enter, realized
that both their masters must be present; but neither party was going to admit what
each knew the other one must know.
‘We couldn’t keep up with the master,’ said Happy and Lively, ‘and it was getting
too dark to go home, so we came here to beg a night’s shelter.’
‘There’s plenty of room here for you to sleep,’ said Rich expansively. ‘Make
yourselves at home. Actually I came here to bring the mistress her monthly
allowance. Now that I’ve given it to her, I think I shall spend the night here as well.’
‘Come and have a drink then,’ said Happy. ‘We’ve had a lot to drink already.’
Rich sat down and poured himself some wine; but before he could drink any, there
was a sound of neighing and trampling from the stable and he and Lively had to run
out and shout at the horses. The two animals sharing the same manger had taken a
dislike to each other and started kicking. It was only after a great deal of shouting and
whoaing that the pages succeeded in quieting them and tying them up on separate
sides of the stable.
While they were doing this, Happy was able to drink several more cups of wine, and
by the time they got back into the kitchen, he was already glassy-eyed. The Mattress
was evidently waiting for an opportunity to retire.
‘Well, boys,’ she said to them as they entered, ‘I’ll leave you to it then. I’ve made
you a pot of tea, so you can help yourselves. I’m going off to bed.’
The boys were reluctant to let her go, and there was a good deal of kissing and
fondling and noisy ribaldry before she finally succeeded in extricating herself. She
closed the door behind her as she went, and Rich and Lively proceeded to bar it on
the inside, preparatory to going to bed. When they went back to look at the kang,
however, they found Happy sprawled out in the middle of it, already fast asleep.
‘Come on, there’s a good chap, get up and lie down again properly!’ they said,
shaking him. ‘Don’t be so selfish! Where are we supposed to go?’
‘What about a bit of bum-cake?’ mumbled Happy, momen?tarily returning to
consciousness. ‘Turn and turn about. Fair shares for all.’
The others, seeing that he was too drunk to reason with, blew the lamp out and
settled themselves on either side of him as best they could.
The commotion in the stable had caused Er-jie’s apprehensiveness to return, but by
forcing herself to keep up a flow of chatter, she succeeded in distracting Jia Lian’s
attention away from it. So successful was she that, after a few more drinks, he began
to grow amorous and, having first sent the girl off with the dirty things, proposed
that they should bar the door for the night and begin undressing. Er-jie was beautiful
at any time, but in only a crimson shift, with her fashionable coiffure shaken out into
billowing black clouds and her face all soft and glowing with desire, she possessed an
extra dimension of beauty that was not revealed in the day?time. He hugged her to
him with a delighted laugh.
‘They’re always telling me how perfect that termagant wife of mine is,’ he said, ‘but
the way you look tonight, she’s not fit to carry your shoes!’
‘I may have looks, but I’ve got no class,’ said Et-jie. ‘Without class, one might just as
well not be good-looking.’
‘Why do you say that?’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t understand.’
‘You all treat me as if I were a fool,’ said Er-jie tearfully. ‘You think that I know
nothing-’
‘No!’
‘- but though we’ve only been married two months – ’
‘I know you’re not a fool!’ he insisted.
      ‘- though we’ve only been together for so short a time,’ she continued, ‘I already
feel that I’m yours completely and for ever, in this life or any life to come. Because
you are my husband, I shall always look up to you and never, never deceive you. My
future is assured. But what is to become of my sister? We can’t let things go on the
way they are at present. We must think of some permanent solution for her.’
Jia Lian laughed reassuringly.
‘Look, I’m not a jealous man. I know about your past and it doesn’t bother me. You
really mustn’t worry. I realize that now we are married you must feel awkward about
Cousin Zhen being here, but surely the solution would be for Cousin Zhen and your
sister to have a formal union and after that we can forget our inhibitions and make it
a foursome. What do you say to that?’
Er-jie wiped her eyes.
‘It’s very nice of you to suggest it, but I don’t know what the other two would think
of your idea. For one thing, my sister is such a funny girl. And for another, I don’t
know whether your cousin would like having everything dragged out into the open.’
‘It’ll be all right,’ said Jia Lian, ‘you see! I’ll go over and have it out with him now.
There’s no time like the present. It’s only a question of breaking the ice.’
He strode off, the bolder for being a little drunk, to the courtyard on the western side
of the compound. Light was streaming through the sitting-room window. He pushed
the door open and walked in.
‘Where’s the big chief, then?’ he cried. ‘Cousin, I’ve come to pay you my respects!’
Speechless with embarrassment, Cousin Zhen rose to his feet and motioned him
dumbly to a seat.
‘What’s this?’ said Jia Lian, noting his embarrassment. ‘After we’ve always been
such good friends, and after all you’ve done for me - because if I cut myself into a
million pieces, I still couldn’t begin to show you how grateful I am - you’re not, surely,
going to start feeling uneasy on my account? My dear coz, from this day on I want
you to carry on exactly as you used to in the past. Otherwise I shall give up any idea
of getting myself an heir and stop coming here altogether!’
He tried to kneel down at this point, but Cousin Zhen, who was becoming quite
frantic with embarrassment, quickly reached out to stop him.
‘All right, Lian,’ he said, ‘all right. Whatever you say, coz. I’ll be guided by you.’
‘Come on, let’s have some more wine!’ Jia Lian said to the servant-girl. ‘I’m going to
drink with my dear cousin.’ He turned to San-jie with a leer. ‘Why don’t you and my
dear cousin share a cup? You and Zhen drink a cup together and I’ll drink a cup to
your future happiness. To Zhen and San-jie!’
San-jie leaped to her feet and, pointing her finger at Jia Lian from where she stood on
the kang, fixed him with a withering look of contempt.
‘Don’t try the talking horse on me, my friend! If you two want to drink, I’ll watch
you drink. But count me out of it. People who work shadow-puppets should be
careful not to break the screen. You surely can’t be so stupid as to imagine that we
haven’t seen by now how things really stand in your household? If you and your
cousin thought that by spending a few taels of your stinking money you could buy my
sister and me for your whores, you were very much mistaken. You see, I know all
about your old woman and how scared you are of her. I know that it’s because of her
that when you married my sister you had to smuggle her out here like a man who’s
stolen a gong and doesn’t dare to play on it. Well, I should like to meet this Feng lady
and find out just how many heads and arms she’s got. If we can reach a satisfactory
agreement, well and good; but if there’s the slightest difficulty, I’m perfectly prepared
to take her on and fight it out with her single-handed. But before I do that, I promise
to have the liver and lights out of you two, or my name’s not “San-jie”! - You said you
wanted a drink, didn’t you? All right, I’ll drink with you.’
She picked up the wine-kettle and poured out a cupful of wine; then, having drunk
half of it herself, she threw an arm round Jia Lian’s neck and pressed the winecup to
his lips.
Jia Lian was shocked by this onslaught into instant soberness; and Cousin Zhen,
ill-prepared for such strident shrew?ishness by what had passed earlier in the
evening, was almost equally taken aback. The two of them, for all their boasted
experience, found themselves reduced to a condition of tongue-tied helplessness by
this single unmarried girl.
But San-jie had not finished with them yet.
‘Why don’t you ask my sister to join us?’ she asked. ‘If we’re going to have fun, let’s
all have fun together. “Home is handiest” as the proverb says. There are no outsiders
here. We’re all in the family. Come one, come all!’
Cousin Zhen was by now looking for an opportunity to leave, but San-jie was careful
to give him none. He had not suspected that she could be like this and deeply
regretted having come; but he could not simply walk out without giving offence to Jia
Lian.
Out of deliberate disregard for appearances she had taken off her hair-ornaments
and outer clothes, and from time to time as she spoke, the animated gestures with
which her words were accompanied caused the imperfectly-fastened crimson shift
she was wearing to gape open, revealing glimpses of leek-?green breast-binder and
snow-white flesh beneath; the red shoes that peeped out below her green drawers
were all the time tap-tapping or coming together in a manner that was anything but
ladylike, and her earrings bobbed to and fro like little swings. To her
brow’s dusky crown and lips incarnadine
the lamplight lent an added softness and brightness; and the wine she had drunk
gave her eyes, which were at all times sparkling and vivacious, an even more
irresistible allure. The two men were spellbound, and yet at the same time repelled.
Her looks and gestures were all that inflamed concupiscence could desire; but her
words and the very frankness of a provocation too brazen to be seductive kept them
at bay.
And a poor pair they made of it in a situation where something other than carnal
satisfaction was required of them. Not only was there none of that lively repartee
that might have been expected of men who prided themselves on their gallantry;
they could not produce so much as a single amusing remark between them and sat
there, as the effortless flow of talk continued to pour out of her, fascinated but
unresponding. Sometimes she abused them, called them names, said the most
outrageous things to them. It was as though the roles had been reversed - as though
she was the man and they were a pair of poor, simpering playthings whose services
she had paid for. And when she had had enough of playing with them, she dismissed
them ignominiously, bolted the door alter them, and went to bed.
From that time onwards, whenever one of the servants did some small thing to
displease her, she would launch into loud abuse of Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong,
denouncing all three of them as swindlers, deceivers and oppressors of the widow
and the orphan.
Cousin Zhen, when he finally got back after that visit, was chary of exposing himself
again. Sometimes when San-jie felt in the mood, she would send one of the boys
round to summon him and he would visit her then gladly enough, for he still had
some small hope of winning her; but he was careful to behave himself when he did,
and to defer in everything to her wishes.
San-jie was a very peculiar young woman. She took a perverse pleasure in enhancing
her natural beauty by affecting a striking style of dress and by adopting every
conceivable kind of outrageously seductive attitude. The effect was that every male
who encountered her was smitten - not only the suscep?tible ones like Jia Lian and
Cousin Zhen, but those made of sterner stuff as well; yet all of them, after only a few
minutes in her company, felt their ardour extinguished and their advances repelled
by the reckless, forthright, almost insolent way in which she received them.
When her mother and sister took her to task for her cavalier treatment of the two
cousins, she told Er-jie she was ‘stupid’.
‘Why should that pair of precious rascals be allowed to ruin girls like us that are
worth a million of them and get away with it?’ she said. ‘They shan’t do so if I can
help it. Besides, that wife of Lian’s is a very dangerous woman. We’re all right for the
time being because she hasn’t found out yet about your marriage; but she will do
one of these days, and when that time comes she’s not going to sit still and do
nothing. There’s sure to be a most terrible row, and who knows which of us will come
out of it alive? It’s only fair that they should be made to jump a bit now. If we’re
going to end up with a bad name anyway, let’s at least get what we can out of them
while we’ve got the chance!’
Her mother and sister, seeing that it was useless to argue with her, left her alone.
San-jie certainly put her precept into practice. Her demands for special kinds of food,
for clothing, for jewellery became daily more extravagant and capricious. Given a
silver orna?ment she would express a desire for a gold one. If she had something
with pearls in it, she would like something with gems in it as well. While she was
eating the fatted goose, her mind was already contemplating the slaughter of the
duck. And woe betide the cook if anything was not quite to her taste! Over would go
dishes, table and all! Or, if a newly-made garment displeased her, no matter how
expensive the material, she would quickly reduce it to ribbons, using a pair of scissors
to aid the process and uttering a fresh malediction at every tear. Cousin Zhen, who,
having some time previ?ously exhausted the possibilities with Er-jie and grown
somewhat tired of her, had willingly yielded her up to Jia Lian and transferred his
attentions to her sister, now found that San-jie, far from proving the complaisant
mistress he had hoped for, was actually costing him a great deal of money - money,
moreover, on which there seemed little prospect of a return.
Nowadays when Jia Lian came he spent the whole of his time there with Er-jie and
scarcely dared venture from her room. Because of San-jie he too was beginning to
regret the situation into which he had got himself.
On the other hand Er-jie was so loving and so devoted to him; he found her so
sympathetic. In her gentleness, in the wifely submissiveness with which she insisted
on discussing everything with him before she would make any decision, she was ten
times better than Xi-feng. And in respect of looks, voice and deportment she was at
least five times better.
True, she was a fallen woman; and though she had repented, neither her reform nor
any other excellence could bring back her virtue. But that was what she said. Was it
not Jia Lian himself who repudiated it?
‘Everybody makes mistakes,’ he would say. ‘As long as you know that you were
wrong and don’t do it again, that’s all that matters.’
He refused to talk about the unchasteness of her past: her present goodness was
enough for him.
And so, his doubts forgotten, he would cleave to her more passionately than ever.
They were of one heart, one mind. He swore they should live and die together.
Xi-feng and Patience were banished totally from his thoughts.
Inevitably these pillow-sessions would end with Er-jie urging Jia Lian to do something
about her sister.
‘Why don’t you talk it over with Zhen and think of someone you both know of who
can marry her?’ she said on the last of these occasions. ‘She can’t stay here like this
indefin?itely. Sooner or later there will be trouble.’
‘I did talk to Zhen about it the other day,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but he couldn’t give up the
idea of keeping her for himself. I said to him, “That piece of meat is too hot for chaps
like us, Zhen. The rose is a very pretty flower, but you can get some nasty jabs from
its spines. You’ll never hold a girl like that down. Much better find a husband for her
and get her off your hands.” But he wouldn’t say “yes” and he wouldn’t say “no”: he
just hummed and hawed for a bit and left it at that. So what can I do?’
      ‘Don’t worry,’ said Er-jie. ‘We’ll speak to San-jie herself about it tomorrow. If we
can persuade her to agree in principle to a betrothal, it can be left to her to have it
out with Cousin Zhen herself. Once she has convinced him that he has nothing to
hope for, he will have to do something about finding her a husband.’
Next day Er-jie spent the morning preparing a little party for the four of them, and Jia
Lian, instead of going off as he usually did, deliberately stayed indoors. At about noon
Er-jie invited her sister over and, when she arrived, seated her next to their mother in
the place of honour. San-jie knew perfectly well what the subject of this meeting was
to be and, as the wine was going round for the third time, before her sister had had a
chance to broach it, she burst into tears and proceeded to do so herself.
      ‘I’m sure the only reason you have invited me here today, sister, is to give me a
lecture, but I’m not stupid and I don’t need to be nagged at as if I were a child. We all
know what happened in the past, and there is no point in dragging it up now. The
important thing is that as you are comfortably settled and Mamma’s future is now
assured, it’s time to start thinking about how I am to be disposed of. However, this
matrimony business is no children’s game: it’s a girl’s whole lifetime to the day she
dies that is decided by it. In the past, because we were so vulnerable and one could
never be sure what designs men might have on one, I deliberately acted in a
shameless manner in order to keep them at bay. Now I am willing to put all that
behind me and turn myself into a good and obedient wife. On one condition, though:
the man I marry has got to he somebody I know about and somebody who is to my
liking. If I leave the choice to you, I am sure you will do your best to find someone
rich and well-placed and good-looking, but if it is someone I cannot give my heart to,
I shall feel that the whole of my life has been wasted.’
      Jia Lian smiled reassuringly.
      ‘That’s easy. We leave the choice entirely to you. Just name the man and we will
take care of the expenses. Your mother will have nothing to worry about.’
      ‘I don’t need to name him,’ said San-jie. ‘Er-jie has known about him all along.’
      ‘Who is it?’ Jia Lian asked, turning to Er-jie; but Er-jie could not for the moment
think who her sister had in mind.
      ‘I know who it is!’ Jia Lian clapped his hands delightedly, suddenly convinced
that he had thought of the right answer. ‘And a very good choice too!’ he added.
      ‘Who?’ said Er-jie.
      ‘No one else could ever be good enough for her. It has to be Bao-yu.’
      Er-jie and Mrs You felt sure that he was right, but San-jie herself repudiated the
suggestion indignantly.
      ‘I suppose you think that if we were ten sisters instead of only three, every one
of us would have to marry a Jia. There are other males in the world besides the ones
in your family, you know.’
      The other three were nonplussed. If it was not Bao-yu that she had in mind,
then who could it be?
      ‘Don’t just look under your noses,’ said San-jie. ‘Try casting your mind back five
years, sister.’
      But at that point Joker arrived, one of Jia Lian’s most trusted pages and sharer of
his secrets.
      ‘Sir She has been asking for you, sir,’ said Joker. ‘I told him that you’d gone off to
Sir Wang’s and then hurried here as quickly as I could to let you know.’
      ‘Were they asking about me at home yesterday?’ Jia Lian sounded a trifle
concerned.
      ‘I told the mistress that you were at the family temple discussing arrangements
for the Hundred Days with Mr Zhen and thought you might not be able to get back.’
      Jia Lian called for his horse to be led out and set off immediately, with Rich in
attendance. Joker was left behind at the disposal of the women. Er-jie had two plates
of food and a large cup of wine set down on the edge of the kang beside him and
invited him to eat and drink standing, while she asked him a few questions. In fact
she asked him a great many. How old was Xi-feng? In what way was she so awful?
How old was Grandmother Jia? How many girls were there? And so on. Joker, smiling
broadly, proceeded, between large sips of wine, to give the old lady and her two
daughters a detailed expose of the Rong mansion and its inhabitants.
      ‘I’m one of the boys from the inner gate,’ he told them. ‘I belong to one of two
groups of four. We work there by shifts. One group goes on duty as the other one
comes off. Of us eight, some, like me, are in the master’s confidence, some are in the
mistress’s. Those of us who are in the master’s confidence daren’t say a word to
upset the mistress’s boys; but she can say or do whatever she likes to us. You want to
know what she’s like? A cruel heart and a sharp tongue, that about sums her up. The
master’s no softy, but he can do nothing with her. There’s a Miss Patience working for
her though. She’s very nice. Though she’s so well in with the mistress, she’ll often do
you a kindness behind her back. When one of us boys is in trouble, the mistress will
be down on us like a ton of bricks, but if we can get Patience to put in a word for us,
we know we shall be all right. Everyone hates the mistress. The only exceptions are
Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship. The others pretend to like her, because they’re
afraid. She knows she hasn’t got any rivals and she always takes very good care to
keep both Their Ladyships happy, so consequently whatever she says goes, nobody
else dares stand up to her. She’s a great one for saving. She must have saved a
mountain of money by now. That’s why Their Ladyships are always saying what a
good manager she is. They don’t realize how much we servants have to suffer so that
she can take the credit. Whenever anything good happens, you can be sure that
she’ll get in with the news first, before anyone else does, so that she can reap the
benefit. But when things go wrong or she’s made a slip herself, she’ll very quickly
step aside and fasten the blame for it on someone else. She’ll even fan the flames up
and make it hotter for that other person once she’s safely out of it herself. Even her
mother-in-law can’t stand her. “The magpie looking for a bigger nest who set up
house with the crow” she calls her. She says she’s no business meddling with the
affairs of our household when she ought to be looking after her own. She says if it
weren’t for Her Old Ladyship, she’d have ordered her back long ago and made her
stay where she belongs.’
      Er-jie laughed.
      ‘If you say things like this behind her back, what must you say behind mine? In
my case there are even more things to criticize!’
       Joker fell on his knees, protesting.
       ‘If I ever said a word against you, madam, I should deserve to be struck by
lightning! It would have been a great blessing for all of us if the master had married
you first instead of the mistress. I know there would have been fewer beatings and
cursings for us boys and we shouldn’t have had to go around the way we do in fear
and trembling all the time. There isn’t a boy among us who isn’t every day and
everywhere singing your praises and saying what a kind and considerate lady you are.
We are planning to ask the master to let us stay here and serve you all the time.’
       ‘Get up, get up!’ said Er-jie, laughing. ‘Little imperti?nence! I was only joking;
how easily you are scared! I’m sure I don’t know what you should want to come here
for. I am thinking of going to see your mistress.’
       Joker waved his hand in vigorous disapproval.
       ‘Don’t do that, madam, whatever you do! It would be much better if you never
set eyes on her as long as you live. She’s “soft of tongue and hard of heart”, “two
faces and three knives”, she’ll “give you a smile and trip you up the while”, she’s “a
welcoming fire when you see her, but a stab in the back when it’s dark” - all those
things and more. I don’t think even Miss You here could get the better of her in an
argument, so I’m sure a quiet, gentle lady like you would be no match for her.’
       Er-jie smiled.
‘If I behave correctly towards her, I don't see why she should do me any harm.’
‘Listen, madam,’ said Joker. ‘I'm not saying this to you because I’ve had too much to
drink, but when she sees that you are both prettier and more popular than she is,
she’s not going to let matters rest. They call jealous people “vinegar bottles”, don't
they? Well, she’s not just a bottle-full of vinegar; she’s a storage-jar - a whole
cistern-full of it! The master’s only got to rest his eyes on one of the maids, and she’ll
find occasion to have that poor girl beaten until she looks like a boiled sheep’s head.
Miss Patience is supposed to be his chamber-wife, but I doubt she lets him sleep with
her more than once in a year. And even then she’ll go on and on about it afterwards
until she’s reduced Patience to tears. “I didn't want to do it,” says Patience, “you
made me. When I said I didn’t want to, you told me I was wicked and dis?obedient,
but now that I've done it, you keep picking on me.” After that she makes it up with
Patience and begs to be forgiven.’
‘That can't be true,’ said Er-jie. ‘If she's really the harpy you say she is, how could
she possibly be frightened of a mere chamber-wife?’
‘Because Patience has reason on her side,’ said Joker. ‘It’s like the proverb says:
“Three men with a carrying-pole can't shift Reason from its place.” Patience has been
with the mistress since she was a little girl. There were four maids that came with the
mistress when she married, but only Patience stayed on with her. The other three
either died or got married. The mistress gave her to the master to be his
chamber-wife partly because she wanted to show everyone what a virtuous wife she
was and partly because she thought it would be a way of binding him to her. Miss
Patience is a really good sort. She’s not the sort of person to go looking for trouble,
and she’s always been good and true to the mistress. That’s why the mistress always
makes it up with her.’
‘I see,’ said Er-jie. ‘But haven’t I heard that there are a young widow and a number
of young ladies in the family? If your mistress is as awful as you say she is, how comes
it that these other ones let her get away with it?’
Joker clapped his hands together and laughed.
‘Because the “young widow” you're talking about – that’s our Mrs Zhu - is a Saint.
The nickname we servants give her is “Lady Gwanyin”. She doesn’t as a rule have
anything to do with household matters. She spends all her time teaching the young
ladies writing and broidering and book-learning. That’s her job. She has done a bit of
household managing since the mistress fell ill, but even now she doesn’t interfere
very much: just follows the rules, very quiet and ladylike - no throwing her weight
about or showing off how clever she is like the other one. Of the young ladies, the
eldest one - well, I suppose she must be a good ’un to have been so favoured. The
second one - that's the master's sister - we call her “Miss Doddyblock”. She’d
probably forget to say “oh” if you stuck a pin in her. The third - Master Bao’s younger
sister - we call “The Rose” –’
‘Why do you call her that?’ the You sisters asked simultaneously.
‘Sweet and pretty and everyone loves her, but she has a thorn,’ said Joker. ‘The
great pity about her is that she’s not Her Ladyship’s child. A phoenix reared in a
crow’s nest, that’s what she is. The fourth young lady is really Mr Zhen’s sister, but
Her Ladyship brought her over to our mansion when she was still a baby and brought
her up there with the others. She’s a big girl now, but still pays no attention to what
goes on around her, no more than the second one. Then besides our four there are
two other young ladies that you probably won’t have heard about - both very, very
beautiful. One is Sir Zheng’s sister’s child. Her name is Miss Lin. Though she’s so
beautiful, sh’'s very thin and weakly. The other is Her Ladyship’s sister’s child. Her
name is Miss Xue.’
‘Miss Wood and Miss Snow,’ said Er-jie, smiling.
‘If we ever meet them on their way through the courtyard or getting into their
carriages when they go out,’ said Joker, ‘we none of us dare to breathe.’
‘Of course,’ said Er-jie. ‘A great household like yours is sure to be very strict about
such matters. Though young boys like you would be allowed into the courtyards, you
would naturally be expected to keep your distance when the young ladies are about.’
     ‘No, no, no,’ said Joker, waving his hand energetically. ‘That’s not the reason
we’re afraid to breathe. We’re afraid that if we breathed out too hard, we might blow
Miss Lin over and cause Miss Xue to melt!’
     The three You ladles, the Mattress and the two maids all burst out laughing.
     But who was it that San-jie wanted to marry? This will be revealed (if you want
to know) in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 66

Shame drives a warm-hearted young woman
to take her life
And shock leads a cold-hearted young gentleman
to renounce the world



Our last chapter concluded with Joker’s female audience laughing at the notion of
Miss Wood’s being blown down and Miss Snow melted by the breathing-out of the
pages. The Mattress dealt him a playful box on the ear.
‘There may be some truth in what you say; but your way of telling things turns even
good sense into nonsense,’ she said. ‘You are more like one of Bao-yu’s boys than
one of the Master’s.’
Er-jie was about to ask another question, but San-jie got in first.
‘Yes now, about Bao-yu: what does he do - apart from going to school?’
Joker laughed.
‘Don’t ask about him, Miss! You’d never believe half of it if I told you. To begin with,
although he’s such a big fellow now, he’s never had what you might call a proper
schooling. Everyone in the family since his great-grandfather’s time, including the
Master, had to do their ten years in the family school; but not him. Bao-yu doesn’t
like study; so because he is Her Old Ladyship’s darling, that’s that. Sir Zheng used to
try and do something with him, but that was soon put a stop to by Her Old Ladyship.
Nowadays he spends the whole of his time just fooling around. You can’t understand
what he’s talking about half the time, and you can’t make any sense of what he does.
He looks bright enough, and people always assume from his looks that he must be
clever; but underneath it he’s stupid. You can tell he must be stupid from the fact
that he never has a word to say for himself when he meets anyone. I’ll give him this,
though: although he doesn’t go to school, he can write a bit. That’s about the only
thing he’s any good at. He doesn’t study, he doesn’t care for physical training, and he
doesn’t like meeting people. He just spends all his time playing around with a pack of
maids. He’s soft, too. Sometimes when he sees us, if he’s in the mood, he’ll play with
us as if he were an equal. Other times he ignores us and we ignore him. If we’re
sitting down or lying down when he comes by, we don’t get up for him; we just take
no notice. He doesn’t care. Nobody’s afraid of him. We do just what we like when
he’s around. He never stops us.’
‘You talk like this about someone who is easy-going with you,’ said San-jie, ‘yet you
complain just as much about someone who is strict. One can see that you are
difficult people to employ!’
‘I always thought Bao-yu looked so nice,’ said Er-jie. ‘How disappointing to learn
that there is really nothing in him after all!’
‘You surely don’t believe the rubbish this boy has been talking, sister?’ said San-jie
impatiently. ‘We have, after all, seen Bao-yu several times ourselves. I suppose you
could call him effeminate. Whether he is eating or talking or moving about, there is
certainly something rather girlish about his manner. That comes from spending
nearly all his time in the women’s quarters with no other males around. But stupid? I
hardly think he can be called that. Don’t you remember when we were still in
mourning, that time we were standing watching the monks as they went round the
coffin and he stood right in front of us? Everyone said how ill-mannered it was of him
and how inconsiderate. But then afterwards he quietly came up to us and explained:
“I hope you didn’t think it very inconsiderate of me to stand in front of you like that,”
he said, “but I noticed how dirty some of those monks were and I was afraid that the
smell of them might distress you.” Then shortly after that, when he was drinking
some tea and you said you’d like some too, he stopped one of the old women from
emptying the slops out of his cup and filling it up again for you. “No, no,” he said,
“that’s dirty! You must wash it first before you pour her any.” Just on the strength of
those two incidents I think you ought in fairness to agree that, when he is with girls
at any rate, he is perfectly capable. People fail to find out what he is really like
because they are put off by his manner.’
‘To hear you speak, it sounds as if the two of you would get on very well together,’
said Er-jie. ‘I think we ought to betroth you to him. Why not?’
San-jie was prevented from answering by Joker’s presence. She merely looked down
and occupied herself by cracking a melon-seed between her teeth.
‘They’d make a fine pair,’ said Joker, ‘whether from the point of view of looks or of
character. The only thing is, he’s got someone else already. Although it hasn’t been
made official yet, it’s as good as certain that he’s going to marry Miss Lin. The reason
they haven’t been properly engaged yet is because Miss Lin is so often ill, and also
because they are still a bit on the young side; but two or three years from now, as
soon as Her Old Ladyship gives the word, they are sure to be.’
They were still discussing this when Rich arrived with a message from Jia Lian.
‘Sir She is sending the Master to Ping-an in a few days’ time on important secret
business. He’ll probably be away for fifteen or sixteen days. He can’t come back here
tonight, but he says, Mrs You, will you and the Mistress get that business you know
about settled, so that when he comes tomorrow, he’ll know what he has to do?’
Having delivered this message, he went back again, taking Joker with him. Er-jie had
the gate closed after them and retired early for the night, a good part of which she
spent in extracting the required information from her sister.
Jia Lian did not arrive until after noon next day. Er-jie expressed concern that he had
come at all.
‘If you have something important to do, you don’t need to put yourself in a rush by
coming here. I should hate to be the cause of your starting late.’
‘It isn’t anything really important,’ said Jia Lian, ‘just a job that needs doing which
happens to be rather far away. I shall have to leave by the beginning of next month
and it will be about half a month before I get back.’
‘Well, while you are away, just concentrate on the job,’ said Er-jie. ‘You don’t have
to worry about anything here. We shall be perfectly all right. San-jie isn’t the sort of
girl to change her mind overnight and she has definitely chosen her man now. I think
you will have to go along with her choice.’
‘Ah yes,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Who is it?’
‘Someone who may not be available at present, in which case it’s anyone’s guess
when he will be back,’ she smiled. ‘I must admit, she has a very good eye. And she
says that she is prepared to wait as long as it will take - ten years if neces?sary. If by
any chance he’s dead or for some reason or other can’t ever come, she says she will
cut her hair off and become a nun. She would rather spend the rest of her life in
prayer and fasting than marry anyone else.’
‘Well, come on!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Who is this person who has made such a powerful
impression on her?’
‘It’s a long story,’ said Er-jie. ‘Five years ago my mother took us both with her to her
old home for my grandmother’s birthday. The family had invited a troupe of amateur
actors for the occasion, all young men of good family. The one who played the junior
male lead was called Liu Xiang-lian. He is the only man my sister is prepared to marry.
Last year he got himself into some sort of trouble and had to go into hiding, and we
don’t know whether he’s out of it yet or not.’
‘So that’s who it is!’ said Jia Lian. ‘No wonder she is so keen. Yes, she certainly has a
good eye. There’s something you probably don’t know about him, though. Young Liu
is a very handsome young man, but he’s an awfully cold fish. He has very few real
friends. Bao-yu is probably the person he gets on best with. He took himself off
somewhere or other last year after beating up that oaf Xue Pan - I suppose because
he wanted to avoid meeting us. I haven’t seen him since then. Someone did tell me
that they’d heard he was back, but it may have been only a rumour. I can easily find
out by asking one of Bao-yu’s pages. - But suppose it is only a rumour. He’s such a
rolling stone, it may be years before he comes back again. Won’t it be rather a waste
for her to put off marrying for so long?’
‘When our San-jie says she’s going to do something, she does it,’ said Er-jie. ‘I think
you will have to go along with her.’
They were interrupted at this point by San-jie herself, who had evidently been
listening to their conversation and chose this moment to come into the room.
‘Set your mind at rest, brother-in-law. I am not one of those people who say one
thing and mean another; I really do mean what I say. If Liu turns up, I shall marry him.
From now on and until he does I shall spend all my time praying, fasting and looking
after Mamma. If he has still not turned up when Mamma is no longer here to look
after, I shall go into a convent.’
She drew a jade hairpin from her hair and deliberately broke it in two.
‘So be it with me if I do not do exactly as I have sworn!’
She went straight back to her room then; and from that day onwards her conduct
was indeed exemplary.
Jia Lian could see that he had no choice but to fall in with her wishes, and after a
brief discussion of domestic matters with Er-jie, went home for further discussions
with Xi-feng about the preparations for his journey. While at home he sent someone
to ask Tealeaf about Liu Xiang-lian.
‘I’m afraid I don’t know,’ said Tealeaf. ‘I should think he probably hasn’t come back
yet. If he had, I should almost certainly have got to hear about it.’
Inquiries made among Xiang-lian’s neighbours confirmed that he had not returned.
Jia Lian was obliged to report back to Er-jie that he had drawn a blank.
A little before he was due to begin his journey, Jia Lian took leave of Xi-feng and the
family, but only in order to spend his last two nights with Er-jie. He found San-jie so
altered on this visit as to seem almost a different person. Er-jie, too, showed herself
so careful and competent in her manage?ment of the little household that he could
see there would be no need to worry about either of them while he was away.
Jia Lian left the city early on the day of his departure and thereafter followed the
main road to Ping-an, putting up at some staging-post or hostelry each night and
making shorter stops for meals and refreshments during the day. After two days of
uneventful travelling he came, on the third day, upon a little caravan moving towards
him along the road ahead consisting of a number of pack-animals and some ten or so
horsemen, of whom the leading two appeared to be masters and the rest servants.
As they drew near enough for him to make out their faces, Jia Lian saw with
astonishment that the two leading horsemen were Xue Pan and Liu Xiang-lian and
urged his horse forwards to meet them. After greetings and the customary
generalities had been exchanged, the three of them went into a near-by inn to sit
down together and talk. Jia Lian asked the question that had been puzzling him.
‘After your little incident last year, the rest of us were anxious to make it up
between you, but young Liu seemed to have disappeared without a trace. How do
you come to be together now?’
‘It’s a very strange story,’ said Xue Pan. ‘My boys and I finished selling our stuff off
in the spring and we’ve been on our homeward journey ever since. Everything was
going quite smoothly until a couple of days ago. Then just as we were approaching
Ping-an, we ran into a gang of robbers who took away all our things. But just at that
very moment up pops young Xiang-lian out of nowhere, drives off the robbers, gets
all our stuff back for us, and saves our lives. He refused to let me thank him, but in
the end he agreed that we should become blood-brothers. We’ve been travelling
together ever since. From now on we’re going to be just like real brothers to each
other. He’s leaving me at the next crossroads and going off sixty or seventy miles
south of here to look up an aunt of his, while I go on ahead to the capital. When I’ve
settled my own affairs, I’m going to find a new house for him and fix him up with a
nice little wife, and we’re both going to settle down and be family men.’
‘I see,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Well, I’m glad to hear it. It’s a pity we had all that worry for
nothing.’
He paused a moment before continuing.
‘You said something a moment ago about finding young Liu a wife. I happen to
know of someone who would suit him perfectly.’
He proceeded to tell the other two about his own marriage to Er-jie and how they
were anxious to find a husband for her younger sister, omitting to mention, of course,
that San-jie had chosen Liu Xiang-lian herself.
‘Don’t say anything about this to the others when you get home,’ he told Xue Pan.
‘I’m waiting until we have a son. I shall tell them about it then.’
Xue Pan seemed delighted.
‘High time, too!’ he said. ‘Cousin Feng is to blame for not giving you one.’
‘There you go again!’ said Xiang-lian, laughing. ‘You mustn’t say things like that to
people. Better keep your big mouth shut!’
Xue Pan obediently fell silent, merely observing, before he did so:
‘We ought to take Lian up on his suggestion, though.’
‘I’d always set my heart on marrying a stunningly beautiful girl,’ said Xiang-lian.
‘However, since you both recom?mend this one, I’m prepared to lower my
expectations a bit. Yes, all right, Mr Jia. I leave it to you to arrange this, then. I put
myself in your hands.’
‘I don’t ask you to believe this now,’ said Jia Lian, smiling. ‘You’ll be able to judge for
yourself when you see her: but this sister-in-law of mine is a stunningly beautiful girl.
I should go so far as to say she must be one of the most beautiful women who have
ever lived.’
Xiang-lian brightened.
‘All right, then. Shall we fix it up when I get back to the capital in about a month’s
time, when I have finished seeing my aunt?’
‘If you and I were the only ones involved, I would gladly leave it at that,’ said Jia
Lian, ‘but knowing how unpredictable your movements are, I can’t help feeling a little
nervous on the girl’s behalf. Suppose you failed to turn up? It could mean a whole
lifetime wasted. I think you ought to give me some sort of pledge.’
‘A gentleman’s word ought to be pledge enough,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘In any case, I’m
always hard up; I’m not in a position to give you a betrothal gift - particularly when I
am on the road like this, away from home.’
‘There’s all my stuff at your disposal,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Help yourself. Give him a share
of that.’
‘It isn’t money or jewellery I’m after,’ said Jia Lian. ‘It doesn’t have to be anything
valuable. Just give me something you carry about with you that I can take back with
me as a token.’
‘At all events, I can’t give you this sword,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘I need it for self-defence.
I have got another sword in my luggage I could let you have - well, two swords, really:
it’s a pair of swords in one scabbard, what they call a “Duck and Drake” sword. It’s a
family heirloom. I never use it, but I always carry it around with me. I could never
bear to be parted from it for long, so however much I may wander, if you take that as
my pledge, you can be sure of my eventually coming back to get it.’
He handed Jia Lian the heirloom when he had got it out of his bundle, and after a few
more drinks the three men remounted, took leave of each other, and went their
separate ways.
*
In due course Jia Lian arrived at Ping-an and saw the Military Governor, only to be
told that the business he had come about could not be dealt with satisfactorily until
some time in the tenth month. As there was no point in staying, he started back the
very next day for the capital, calling in first at Er-jie’s place on his arrival.
Er-jie had run the little household during his absence with exemplary circumspection.
The courtyard gate had been kept shut and bolted all day and she had received no
outside visitors. San-jie, too - a young woman who never did anything by halves - had
continued as good as her word. When not actually keeping to her own room, she had
spent the whole of the time either ministering to the wants of her mother or sitting
and sewing with Er-jie. Jia Lian was gratified to find all these signs of prudent
housekeeping on his return and his respect for Er-jie’s wifely virtues increased.
When the greetings and routine questionings were over, he told the sisters about his
encounter with Liu Xiang-lian, and getting the Duck and Drake swords out of his
luggage, he handed them to San-jie to take care of. San-jie first examined the
scabbard. It was embossed with a design of interlacing dragons and sea-monsters
and encrusted all over with jewels. Then she took out the swords, identical except
that one had the character ‘Duck’ and the other the character Drake’ engraved on its
blade. And what blades! Cold, cruel; glittering with the cold brightness of autumn
waters. San-jie was enraptured by them. She put them both back into their scabbard
and carried them off to her own room, where she hung them up over her bed.
Thereafter she would look up at them from time to time and smile, happy in the
knowledge that now her future was assured.
After a couple of nights with Er-jie, Jia Lian went back to Rong-guo House to report to
his father and to rejoin the other members of the family. He found Xi-feng with the
rest. She had by now recovered sufficiently to get about and had resumed her duties
as household manager. As soon as he could, he went to see Cousin Zhen and tell him
about San-jie and Liu Xiang-lian. Cousin Zhen was lately much taken up with a new
acquaintance and had lost his former interest in the You sisters. He therefore
received Jia Lian’s news with equanimity and seemed perfectly content to leave the
matter in his hands, merely insisting on himself contributing thirty taels towards the
expenses, since he feared that Jia Lian’s resources might be inadequate. Jia Lian
accepted the money and handed it to Er-jie to spend on San-jie’s trousseau.
Round about the middle of the eighth month Xiang-lian arrived back in the capital
and at once went to pay his respects to Aunt Xue and make the acquaintance of Xue
Ke. He was told that Xue Pan had been ill in bed almost since the day he got back
(some sickness brought on by change of water or the effects of travel) and was still
under doctor’s treatment. However, on hearing that Xiang-lian had come, Xue Pan
insisted on having him brought into his bedroom. He and his mother, whose earlier
resentment against Xiang-lian had been completely banished by her gratitude to him
for saving her son’s life, spoke eloquently of their indebtedness, and when the
conversation turned to the subject of Xiang-lian’s marriage, they insisted that all the
material things required for it should be supplied by them, so that he should have
nothing to do himself except name the day. It was now Xiang-lian’s turn to be
grateful.
Next day Xiang-lian went to see Bao-yu. The two of them were always wonderfully at
ease in each other’s company and Xiang-lian felt sufficiently intimate to ask him
confidentially about the circumstances of Jia Lian’s second marriage.
‘I really don’t know - beyond what Tealeaf has told me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I haven’t been
to see them. I don’t really think it’s my business. Tealeaf mentioned that Cousin Lian
was very anxious to see you about something, but I don’t know what it was.’
Xiang-lian told him about the various things that had happened to him on his travels,
ending up with an account of his encounter with Jia Lian.
‘Congratulations!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You are a lucky man. She’s a ravishingly beautiful
girl. The perfect match for a good-looking chap like you!’
‘If she is so beautiful,’ said Xiang-lian, ‘there can be no shortage of suitors wanting
to marry her. Why should your cousin pick on me? I’ve never been particularly
friendly with him in the past - certainly not to that extent - yet when I met him on
this journey, he was so pressing, so insistent that I should give him a definite
undertaking to marry her. What am I to make of it? It’s almost as if the girl’s family
was doing the pursuing. I can’t help feeling very dubious about the whole affair. I
wish I hadn’t given him those swords. I thought of you as the person most likely to be
able to help me get to the bottom of this business.’
‘For a person so intelligent you have left it a bit late to start feeling dubious now
that you have promised to marry the girl and already given them your pledge,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘You started off by saying that you wanted to marry a beauty. Now that
you’ve got one, why not leave it at that? Why these suspicions?’
‘You said just now you didn’t even know about her sister’s marriage,’ said Xiang-lian.
‘How do you know she is so beautiful?’
‘I saw her practically every day for a month at Ning-guo House when she and her
sister were brought there by Cousin Zhen’s mother-in-law,’ said Bao-yu. ‘How could I
fail to know? Ravishingly beautiful. Obviously made for you. You San-jie, you see:
even the name makes her yours!’
Xiang-lian stamped impatiently.
‘And everyone else’s, no doubt.’ Bao-yu’s execrable pun had not amused him. ‘It
won’t do. This is a thoroughly bad business. The only clean things about that
Ning-guo House are the stone lions that stand outside the gate. The very cats and
dogs there are corrupted!’
Bao-yu reddened, and Xiang-lian, realizing that he had gone too far, began pumping
his bands apologetically.
‘I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. - But surely you can tell me something about
her character?’
‘Since you appear to know already, I don’t quite see the point,’ said Bao-yu wryly.
‘In any case, perhaps I’m none too clean myself.’
‘What I said was spoken in the heat of the moment,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘You mustn’t
take it to heart.’
‘I’ve already forgotten it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you go on talking about it, you will make it
seem that the one who has taken it to heart is you.’
Xiang-lian pumped his hands again and took his leave. He was still thoroughly
unhappy about the whole affair. At first he thought of going back to Xue Pan and
talking it over with him; then he changed his mind, partly because Xue Pan was ill but
mainly because in any case he had little confidence in his judgement. In the end he
decided that perhaps the best thing would be simply to ask for his pledge back. Once
he had made up his mind, he decided to tackle Jia Lian about it immediately. He
found him at Er-jie’s place.
Jia Lian, delighted to hear that Xiang-lian had already come to call, came hurrying out
to meet him and conducted him to the inside sitting-room to introduce him to his
future mother-in-law. He was somewhat surprised when Xiang-lian merely bowed to
the old lady instead of making her a kotow and addressed her formally as ‘Mrs You’.
The significance of this became apparent presently when tea was served and
Xiang-lian came at once to the point.
‘I am afraid that when I met you recently on my travels I acted far too hastily. I
didn’t know at the time, hut it seems that my aunt had already in the fourth month
chosen another girl to be my wife. When she told me about it, there was obviously
nothing I could say. To hold to my agreement with you would have meant disobeying
my aunt, and that of course is out of the question. Now, if the pledge I gave you had
been gold or silk or something of that sort, I should simply have forgotten about it;
but those swords I gave you were a family heirloom left me by my grandfather, so I’m
afraid I shall very regretfully have to ask you for them back.’
Jia Lian was unable to take this calmly.
‘Now look here, young Liu, this won’t do, you know! A pledge is a pledge. The
whole idea of it is to guard against people having second thoughts like this. An
engagement to marry isn’t something you can just jump into and out of at will. I’m
afraid what you are proposing is quite impossible.’
Xiang-lian smiled patiently.
‘No doubt you are in the right, and I am perfectly prepared for you to reproach me;
but I’m afraid I cannot go through with this marriage under any circumstances.’
Jia Lian seemed about to argue, but Xiang-lian frustrated him by rising to his feet.
‘Could we go and discuss this somewhere else, please? It isn’t very convenient,
talking about it in here.’
You San-jie had been able to hear the whole of this conversation quite clearly from
her room. She had waited so long for Xiang-lian, and now that at last he had come,
he was re?jecting her. It must be because of something he had heard about her in
the Jia mansion. He probably thought of her as a shame?less wanton, the sort of
woman who throws herself at men, unworthy to be his wife. If she allowed the two
men to go off together, there was little likelihood that Jia Lian could do anything to
stop him breaking off the engagement; and even if he tried arguing with him, the
probable outcome would only be further damage to her reputation. As soon,
therefore, as she heard Jia Lian agreeing to go outside with him, she snatched the
swords down from the wall, and having first drawn out the Duck and hidden it
behind her back, she hurried into the sitting-room to see them.
‘There is no need for you to go out and discuss anything,’ she said. ‘Here is your
pledge back.’
The tears were pouring down her cheeks like rain. She held out the scabbard with the
single sword in it in her left hand. As Xiang-lian took it, she whipped the other sword
out with her right hand and slashed it across her throat. It was all over in a moment.
Red scatter of broken blossoms, and the jade column fallen, Never to rise again ...
The terrified servants made futile attempts to resuscitate her, but she was already
dead. Old Mrs You wept and screamed, breaking off from time to time to inveigh
against Xiang-lian as a murderer. Jia Lian seized hold of Xiang-lian and called for
someone to bring a rope, intending to tie him up and take him to the yamen; but
Er-jie checked her weeping and did her best to dissuade him.
‘He didn’t force her to do it, it was her own decision. What good will taking him to
the yamen do? We don’t want a public scandal on top of everything else. Much
better let him go.’
Jia Lian, whose resolution seemed temporarily to have deserted him, let go of
Xiang-lian automatically: but Xiang-lian made no attempt to escape.
‘I didn’t know she was like this,’ he said, weeping. ‘She had a noble heart. It wasn’t
my luck to have her.’
He lifted up his own voice then and wept, as if he had been weeping for his bride. He
stayed with the family until the coffin had been bought and San-jie laid inside it; and
when the lid was closed over her, he threw himself on it and clung to it for a long
time weeping. Only then did he take leave of them, walking alone out of the gate,
blinded by his tears and scarcely knowing where he was going.
As he walked along in a daze, his thoughts full of San-jie’s rare combination of beauty
and resoluteness which he had so wantonly rejected, one of Xue Pan’s little pages
came looking for him to take him to his new house. Xiang-lian was too distracted to
pay the boy much attention and allowed himself to be led there by the hand. It was a
pleasant, well-appointed little house While he and the page stood waiting in the
sitting-room, he heard a little tinkling noise - the sound made by the girdle-gems of a
hurrying woman - and San-jie came into it from outside. She had the Duck cradled in
her right arm. Her left hand was holding some sort of album or ledger.
‘I loved you for five years,’ she said. (The tears were still running down her cheeks.)
‘I did not know that your heart was as cold as your face. It was a foolish love, and I
have paid for it with my life. Now I am ordered to go to the Fairy Disenchantment’s
tribunal in the Land of Illusion to keep the records of the other lovers who are under
her jurisdiction. But I could not bear to leave without seeing you just once more
before I go. After this I shall never see you again.’
She began to go, but Xiang-lian wanted to question her and tried to stop her going.
She spoke again, but this time it sounded more like an incantation.
‘From love I came; from love I now depart. I wasted my life for love, and now that I
have woken up, I am ashamed of my folly. From now on we are nothing to each other,
you and I - nothing.’
A little gust of wind with a faint fragrance on it seemed to blow past him as she
uttered these last words, and the very next moment she had vanished.
Xiang-lian came to himself with a start, uncertain whether or not he had been
dreaming. He could see no sign of Xue Pan’s little page when he looked about him,
and the new house had turned into a dilapidated temple. Not far from him a Taoist
with a crippled leg sat catching and killing his lice. Xiang-lian got up and went over to
him.
‘What is this place, holy one?’ he asked, having first clasped his hands and knocked
them against his forehead in the ap?propriate salutation. ‘And may I know whom I
have the honour of addressing?’
The Taoist chuckled.
‘I don’t know where this place is any more than you do. Nor who I am. It is a place
where I am resting a little while before going on elsewhere.’
It felt to Xiang-lian as if a douche of icy water had penetrated him to the bone with
its coldness. He understood. Without a moment’s hesitation he drew the
companionless Drake out of its scabbard, stretched out his queue, slashed through
                    … the unnumbered strands,
That bind us to the world and its annoys,
and as soon as the Taoist was ready, followed him out into the world. But where the
two of them went to, I have no idea. Other information apart from that will be
available in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 67

Frowner sees something that
makes her homesick
And Xi-feng hears something that
rouses her suspicions



The grief occasioned in old Mrs You, Er-jie, Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian by San-jie’s
suicide can be imagined. It long outlasted her burial outside the city walls, which
took place shortly after the encoffining. As for Liu Xiang-lian, the human repinings
felt by that somewhat cold young man when he realized the value of what he had
lost were brought to an abrupt end (as we have shown) by the even colder words of
the Taoist, which, by breaking through the Barrier of Confusion and opening his eyes
to the vanity of human affections, caused him to renounce the world by symbolically
severing his hair and following the mad holy man in his wanderings. The direction
these took them in is unknown, as we stated in the previous chapter. Let us leave
them and see how others were affected by these events.
Aunt Xue had been delighted by the news of Xiang-lian’s betrothal to You San-jie. The
wedding would give her an opportunity of demonstrating her gratitude to him for
saving her son’s life. She was excitedly planning for this event - discussing the
purchase of a house and furniture, selecting a date, making arrangements for the
ceremony and so forth - when one of the household boys came in with the appalling
news that San-jie had cut her throat and Xiang-lian decided to become a Taoist. She
was still puzzling over the incomprehensible nature of this disaster when Bao-chai
came over from the Garden.
‘Child, have you heard the news?’ Aunt Xue asked her. ‘Mrs Zhen’s younger sister,
San-jie - the one that was engaged to marry Pan’s new “brother” Liu Xiang-lian - has
cut her throat. I’ve no idea why. And Xiang-lian has renounced the world and just
disappeared. Isn’t it terrible? I don’t know what to make of it.’
Bao-chai heard her without emotion.
‘ It is as the proverb says, Mamma: “The weather and human life are
unpredictable.” This was probably preordained because of something they did in
their past lives. The other day you were planning to do everything you could for him
because of what he did for Pan. Now she is dead and he has disappeared. I think the
best thing you can do is just forget about them. There is no point in upsetting
yourself on their account; there are other things to worry about. It is more than a
fortnight now since Pan got back from the South and the goods he brought with him
must all have been disposed of by now. Surely you ought to have a word with him
about entertaining the people who went with him on the journey? They had a good
deal of hardship to put up with during their months of travel. It will seem very
uncouth of us if we do not find some way of showing our appreciation.’
While Bao-chai and her mother were talking, Xue Pan came in from outside. His eyes
were still wet from recent weeping.
‘Mamma,’ he said, ‘have you heard about Xiang-lian and San-jie ?’
‘They told me only a few minutes ago,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Your sister and I were talking
about it when you came in.’
‘You heard that Xiang-lian had gone off with some Taoist then,’ said Xue Pan.
‘Yes,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘That’s what’s so extraordinary. Why should an intelligent
young man like that suddenly take leave of his senses to go wandering off with a
Taoist? As he had no parents or brothers, I think it’s up to you as his best friend to
find him. They say the Taoist is both mad and lame, so they cannot have got very far -
probably no farther than one of the temples or monasteries in this vicinity.’
‘That’s exactly what I thought, Mamma,’ said Xue Pan. ‘As soon as I heard the news,
I went around looking for him with the boys, but we couldn’t find a trace of him
anywhere, and none of the people we talked to seemed to have seen him.’
‘Well, if you’ve already looked for him and he can’t be found, you’ve done as much
as a friend could do,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Some good might yet come of it, you never
know. What you’ve got to do now is start getting your business back into shape. And
for another thing, it’s time you started thinking about your own marriage and making
a few prepa?rations. We’ve got no other man in the family but you and you’re not as
bright as you might be. You know what they say about baby birds learning to fly. The
sillier the bird, the sooner it must begin. If you start getting ready well in advance,
there will be less danger of making yourself ridiculous when the time comes by
finding that there are all sorts of things you have forgotten. And there’s something
else I want to talk to you about. Your sister has just been pointing out to me, it’s
more than a fortnight since you came back and the goods you brought hack with you
must all have been sold off by now. You ought to give a little party for those of our
employees who went with you on the journey - just a little gesture to show them that
you appreciate their services. After all, it was a long journey. What would it be? A
thousand miles there and back? Pretty nearly. You were four or five months away, at
all events. And don’t forget, they underwent some very alarming experiences on
your behalf.’
‘You’re absolutely right, Mamma,’ said Xue Pan. ‘And sis, she always thinks of
everything. I had thought about it myself, but during these last few days, what with
running around everywhere disposing of the stock until my head feels’ as if it will
burst and running around getting things ready for Xiang?-lian’s wedding (fat lot of
good that was, now that it’s all come to nothing!) I somehow didn’t get round to it.
Still, it’s not too late. We can fix a time for tomorrow or the day after and send the
invitations out straight away.’
‘I leave all that to you,’ said his mother.
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when one of the pages came in from
outside to report.
‘There are some men here from the shop with two cases of stuff for you and a
message from Mr Zhang. He says these are the things you bought for yourself, that
aren’t on the stock-list. He would have sent them round earlier, but there were a lot
of other cases on top of them and he couldn’t get them out. He says they didn’t
finish selling the stock off until yesterday, so this is the first time he has been able to
get at them.’
Two other pages carried the two cases in, one after the other, while he was speaking.
They were large coir trunks, protectively crated between pairs of roped-together
boards.
‘Aiyo!’ said Xue Pan. ‘How stupid of me! I brought these things back specially for
you and sis, Mamma, but I completely forgot to bring them home with me. Fancy the
boys in the shop having to remember them for me!’
‘It’s a good thing you “brought them back specially”, said Bao-chai. ‘Now we’re only
getting them a fortnight late. If you hadn’t “brought them back specially”, we should
probably have had to wait until the end of the year! It’s the same with everything
you do. You are so thoughtless.’
Xue Pan laughed.
‘I think it’s because of that scare we had on the journey. It scared the wits out of
me and they haven’t got back into the right holes yet.’
The others laughed. He turned to the boy who had come in with the message.
‘All right. Tell the men outside we’ve got the stuff now and they can go back to the
shop.’
Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were curious.
‘Well, what is it you’ve got all crated and corded up so carefully?’
Xue Pan told the pages to untie the ropes, remove the protecting boards and undo
the fastenings of the trunks. The first one contained mostly materials - silks, satins,
brocades and so forth - and various foreign articles of domestic use.
‘The other trunk is stuff I got specially for you, sis,’ said Xue Pan.
He undid the fastenings of it himself. Besides writing?brushes, ink-sticks, inkstones,
different sorts of fancy stationery, purses, rosaries, fans, fan-cases, face-powder,
rouge and other feminine articles, it contained a whole lot of novelties from
Hu-qiu-shan: little mercury-filled automata who turned somersaults when you put
them down on the floor or a table, automata with sand-filled cylindrical bodies
whose arms, legs and heads moved when you set the sand running, and lots and lots
of scenes from drama made up of tiny figures moulded in coloured clay in cases of
transparent green gauze. Most fascinating of all was a tiny made-to-order figure of
Xue Pan himself, looking exactly like the original in every detail. Bao- chai had no eyes
for anything but this. Picking the tiny replica up in her hand to examine it, she looked
from it to the original and burst out laughing. She had the other things put back into
the trunk and ordered two of the older servants to carry it to All-spice Court for her
under Oriole’s supervision while she herself stayed chatting a little longer with her
mother and brother. Then she too went back into the Garden.
After she had gone, Aunt Xue proceeded to go over the contents of the other trunk
with Providence, taking them out, putting them into separate piles, and explaining
which pile was to be given to Grandmother Jia, which to Lady Wang, and so forth.
Xue Pan for his part began there and then to make preparations for a party. The
invitations to his employees were dispatched with great urgency, for he was
determined that the party should be on the very next day. As a number of people
were invited, it took some time for all of them to assemble and there was much talk
about trading, accountancy and the disposal of stock before the last of the guests
had arrived. When they were all present, Xue Pan invited them to take their places at
table and went round himself with the wine-kettle to fill their cups. Aunt Xue sent
someone in to thank them on the family’s behalf for their loyal service. Thereupon
drinking began and conversation of a more general kind among the guests. Presently
one of them observed that a good friend was missing from their company whose
presence might have been expected.
‘Oh?’ said the others. ‘Who’s that?’
‘Mr Liu,’ the man said, ‘that saved all our lives and became a blood-brother to the
master.’
This started a good deal of speculation among the guests and finally one of them
asked Xue Pan outright why he had not invited him. Xue Pan frowned and sighed.
‘Don’t ask me about him,’ he said. ‘It’s a very funny business. It isn’t “Mr Liu” now
any longer. It’s “Father Liu”.’
The others expressed surprise.
‘How can that be?’
Xue Pan related the whole story to them. They were even more surprised when they
heard.
‘Now I understand what they were shouting about yesterday outside the shop,’ said
one of them. ‘It was something about a man having been converted by only two or
three words spoken to him by a Taoist. Someone else said the two of them had
vanished into thin air. They didn’t say who the man was. We were all busy selling
stock at the time, so we couldn’t go outside to find out and we’ve been wondering
ever since whether to believe the story or not. We never imagined it was Mr Liu they
were talking about. If we’d known, we’d have gone after him and tried to reason with
him. I’m sure we’d have found some way of stopping him.’
‘I’ve got a different theory about what happened,’ said one of them.
‘Oh? What’s that?’ the others asked him.
‘Well,’ said the man with the theory, ‘it doesn’t seem very likely that a clever young
chap like Mr Liu would suddenly go off to become the disciple of an old Taoist. We
know how strong he is and how good at martial arts. Perhaps he’d found out that this
Taoist was really a wicked magician and just pretended to become his disciple so that
when he’d got him to some quiet, out-of-the-way place he could do him in.’
‘If that’s what it is, that’s very good,’ said Xue Pan. ‘There are too many of these
fellows going around leading people astray with their silly nonsense. It needs a
person like Xiang-?lian to put a few of them down.’
‘But didn’t you look for Mr Liu yourself when you heard about this?’ his guests
asked him.
‘Of course I did,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Inside and outside the city. And I don’t mind telling
you - you can laugh at me if you like - I had a good old cry when I couldn’t find him.’
He sighed several times and looked very despondent. His customary cheerfulness
seemed to have deserted him altogether since this loss. Seeing him so downcast, his
employees did not venture to stay long, but drank the wine up, finished up the food,
and dispersed. We, too, shall leave him at this point and continue our interrupted
narrative of the previous day.
*
When Bao-chai got back from her mother’s to her own room in All-spice Court, she
went over the toys that Xue Pan had given her, deciding which of her cousins each
one of them should go to and retaining only a very few of them for herself. When she
had finished doing that, she proceeded to portion out the other things as well. For
some of the cousins there were writing-brushes, paper, inkstones and ink; for others,
purses, fans and rosaries; some were to have hair-oil, powder and rouge; for some
there were to be only toys. She made the little piles as equal as possible, except in
the case of Dai-yu, for whom she selected twice as much as for anyone else. Having
explained very carefully to Oriole who each of the piles was for, she sent her off, with
an old woman acting as portress, to go round to all the apartments and deliver them.
With one exception, the cousins, on receiving their presents, tipped the bearers and
said that they would thank Bao-chai in person when they next saw her. Dai-yu alone
reacted some?what differently. The sight of the Hu-qiu toys, manufactured only a few
miles from her native Soochow, brought on a severe attack of nostalgia. Once more
she was reminded of her position: an orphan and an outsider, with no kind brother in
her case to bring back things for her from the South. Already she was beginning to be
upset. Nightingale knew at once what was the matter, but judged it more politic to
remonstrate than to let her mistress know that she understood.
‘Look at all the illness you’ve had, miss. You hardly ever stop taking medicine. It’s
only just recently that you’ve begun to look a bit better. Though even now I think it’s
more a case of being in better spirits than being properly cured. You can see from the
fact that Miss Bao has sent you all these things that she must think a lot of you. That
ought to make you happy, not upset you. Whatever is Miss Bao going to think if she
gets to hear that the things she has sent you have made you feel miserable? That’s
not going to he very nice for her, is it? And there’s another thing. Look how
concerned Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship always are about your health, how
they get the best doctors and the best medicines to try and cure you. And now, just
as you are beginning to be a little bit better, here you go, crying and making yourself
miserable. It’s as if you wanted to get ill again, just to give them something more to
worry about! It was too much fretting that brought on your illness in the first place.
You ought to have a bit more consideration for yourself.’
While Nightingale was admonishing her mistress, a voice from the courtyard was
heard announcing ‘Master Bao’. Nightingale called to him to come inside.
‘Sit down,’ said Dai-yu..
    Bao-yu noticed that she had been crying.
‘Hullo, what’s the matter?’ he asked. ‘Who’s been upsetting you?’
Dai-yu forced a smile.
     ‘I’m not upset.’
Nightingale shot her lips out and gestured towards the table behind Dai-yu’s bed. His
eyes followed her gesture to the pile of presents on the table. He realized she could
only just have received them from Bao-chai.
‘Why, what a lot of things you’ve got there!’ he said. ‘Are you planning to set up a
shop?’
Dai-yu made no reply.
‘Don’t talk about them!’ said Nightingale. ‘They’re from Miss Bao. As soon as Miss
Lin set eyes on them, she burst into tears. I was just trying to talk some sense into her
when you came in. Perhaps, now you’re here, you’ll be able to do it for me.’
Bao-yu knew what Dai-yu’s trouble was as well as Nightin?gale, but was no more
willing than Nightingale to show her that he knew. He merely laughed, therefore, and
answered Nightingale with a jest.
‘Oh, I know what’s upset your mistress. She’s cross because Miss Bao didn’t send
her more. Never mind, coz,’ he said, turning to Dai-yu, ‘one of these days I’ll he
visiting Kiangnan myself, and when I do, I promise to bring you back two whole
boatloads of these things. That should dry your eyes for you!’
Dai-yu, aware that she was being ‘cheered up’, could not rebuff the clumsy attempt
too impatiently; nor, on the other hand, did she feel inclined to let it pass
unreproved.
‘I may be very stupid and ill-bred, but not quite to the extent of getting into a
passion because I have not been given enough toys. I am not a three-year-old. You
make me out to be even more petty-minded than I am. I have my own reasons for
what I feel. What do you know about them?’
As she said this, the tears began once more to flow. Bao-yu moved over from his seat
and sat down beside her on the bed. He began picking the articles on the table up
one by one, turning them this way and that to examine them, and asking her all sorts
of questions about them. What was this? What did you call it? Wasn’t this one clever?
What was it made of? And this one, what was it for? He also made various
suggestions as to where she should put them. This one he thought would be nice to
keep by her on her desk; that one would look well with the vases and other
ornaments on the wall-table; and so on and so on until Dai-yu felt that, however
well-intentioned this might be, she could stand no more.
‘Come on, you’re being a nuisance,’ she said. ‘Let’s go and see Bao-chai.’
This was precisely what Bao-yu had been hoping for. If he could get her to go out, the
distraction of doing something else might cause her to forget her sadness.
‘Good!’ he said. ‘We ought to go, anyway, to thank her for the things.’
‘I wasn’t thinking of that,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Between cousins there is no need for such
formality. I was thinking that, having just got back from the South, Cousin Pan must
have told her a lot about the places there he visited, and hearing about them from
Chai would be the next best thing to taking a trip back there myself.’
Her eyes began to redden, and for a moment it seemed in doubt if she would go out
after all; but as Bao-yu was already on his feet waiting for her, she was more or less
obliged to follow him.
‘After all the trouble Cousin Pan went to in getting them to you,’ Bao-yu told
Bao-chai when they were in her room, ‘you ought to have kept those things for
yourself, not given them all away to other people.’
‘There’s nothing very special about them,’ said Bao-chai. ‘They are all inexpensive
objects made by local craftsmen which just happen to have come from a long way
away. I thought the rest of you might find them amusing.’
‘When I was little, these things were so familiar to me that I thought nothing of
them,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Now, after all these years, they have become novelties again.’
“‘The farther from home, the more precious the object” as the saying goes,’ said
Bao-chai. ‘Not that these are precious, of course.’
Bao-yu feared that Bao-chai was moving onto dangerous ground and intervened to
change the subject.
‘Be sure to make Pan go again next year, Chai, and bring us back a lot more.’
Dai-yu stared.
‘If you want to make such a request, that’s your business, but kindly leave others
out of it!’ She turned to Bao-chai. ‘He has not come here to thank you, you observe,
but to put in an order for next year.’
Bao-chai and Bao-yu both laughed.
As the three of them chattered on, the conversation presently turned to the subject
of Dai-yu’s illness.
‘When you are out of sorts,’ Bao-chai suggested, ‘you want to force yourself to go
out of doors: walk around, visit people, look at things - anything to take your mind off
yourself. You’ll find it is much better for you than sitting cooped up indoors feeling
miserable. I wasn’t feeling very well recently. I felt exhausted all day long and hot all
over and wanted to do nothing but lie down. This is a bad time of the year for me,
and I was afraid of becoming seriously ill. So I started deliberately looking for things
to do and forcing myself to do them; and do you know, during the last day or two I
really have begun to feel better.’
‘I am sure you are right,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have in fact come to the same conclusion
myself.’
*
The person most gratified by Bao-chai’s presents was Aunt Zhao.
‘I’m not surprised they all say what a nice girl that Bao-chai is,” she said to herself
when the consignment of toys arrived for Jia Huan. ‘You can see from this how kind
and generous she is. Her brother can’t have brought all that much back for her from
his travels, yet every single person has been remembered. No one’s been left out
because they aren’t impor?tant, even the unlucky ones like us that no one else ever
bothers about. Now if it had been that Lin girl, it would have been a very different
story. She can scarcely even bring herself to look you straight in the face. You
wouldn’t catch her sending us things like this!’
As these thoughts passed through her mind, she was turning the things over and
over in her hands and arranging them this way and that upon the kang. Presently the
thought occurred to her that Bao-chai was close kin to Lady Wang. Why should she
not take advantage of that fact to ingratiate herself with Lady Wang? Gathering the
articles up in her arms, she went off, full of fuss and self-importance, to Lady Wang’s
room and took up a position at her elbow.
‘Look!’ she said, putting on a very affected smile. ‘Look what Bao-chai has just sent
our Huan! Such thoughtfulness in one so young! She’s a real little lady, Bao-chai. She
has class. And so generous. You can’t help admiring her. I don’t wonder you and Her
Old Ladyship are so fond of her and always speaking so highly of her. I didn’t like to
keep these things without your permission, that’s why I’ve brought them. And I
thought it might amuse you to look at them.’
Lady Wang had guessed what the motive for her visit must be long before she had
finished. The clumsy attempt to ingratiate was by no means pleasing to her, but she
could not ignore it altogether.
‘Certainly you should keep them,’ she said. ‘Let Huan have them to play with.’
She had merely glanced at the toys in saying this and then turned away again.
So Aunt Zhao, who had been so cock-a-hoop when she came, had got nothing for her
pains but a smutty nose. Angry, but not daring to show it, she returned crestfallen to
her room and threw the things into a corner, muttering crossly to herself as she did
so.
‘Hfn! What do you make of that then?’
And she sat on her own there on the kang, continuing to mutter to herself as she
brooded angrily on her wrongs.
*
Oriole and the old woman had by this time finished delivering presents and went
hack to give their mistress an account of the messages of thanks sent back by the
recipients and the various tips they had received. As soon as the old woman had
gone out, Oriole moved closer to where Bao-chai was sitting and spoke softly into her
ear.
‘When we were delivering at Mrs Lian’s just now, Mrs Lian looked absolutely
furious about something. I had a word with Crimson on my way out and she said that
when Mrs Lian came back from Her Old Ladyship’s a little before we arrived she was
looking very grim - not at all her usual smiling self. She called for Patience as soon as
she got back and they were talking earnestly together about something, but she
couldn’t hear what they were saying. It looks as though something really serious
must have happened. Did you hear about anything while you were at Her Old
Ladyship’s today, miss?’
Bao-chai wondered what could have made Xi-feng so angry, but could think of
nothing.
‘Every household has its own troubles,’ she told Oriole. ‘It isn’t our business to
inquire. Go and pour me some tea.’
So Oriole went out to pour tea and nothing more on that subject was said.
*
After seeing Dai-yu to her gate, Bao-yu continued on his way to Green Delights. While
he did so, he was thinking how hard it must be to be an orphan and feeling more and
more sorry for her. He resolved to have a word with Aroma about it when he got
back, but when he got back, only Musk and Ripple were in his room.
‘Where’s Aroma?’ he asked them.
‘Must he in one or other of the courtyards hereabouts,’ said Musk. ‘She can’t be
lost. Why the sudden urge to see her?’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘I didn’t imagine she was lost. The reason I asked is because I’ve just got back from
seeing Miss Lin. She seemed to be rather upset about something, and when I asked
her what it was, she said the things that Miss Bao sent her were made quite near her
old home and the sight of them had upset her. I was going to ask Aroma if she’d mind
going over and having a word with her.’
‘Oh dear! Who’s in for it this time?’
It was Skybright who said this. She had come in at that moment and overheard only
the last few words he had spoken. He repeated for her benefit the whole of what he
had just been saying to Musk.
‘Aroma went out a few minutes ago,’ said Skybright. ‘I think she was going to call on
Mrs Lian. It’s quite possible that she may drop in at Miss Lin’s place on her way back.’
Bao-yu made no reply. Ripple poured him a cup of tea. He took it from her
absent-mindedly, rinsed his mouth with some of it, handed the rest to one of the
junior maids, and stretched himself out on his bed, looking thoroughly miserable.
*
After Bao-yu went off to visit Dai-yu, Aroma had at first occupied herself with some
sewing. While she was doing this, it suddenly occurred to her that it was some time
since she had been to call on Xi-feng and ask about her illness. Now seemed as good
a time as any to visit her, because she knew that Jia Lian was not there so that she
would be able to converse with her more freely. When she had changed her clothes
and, with the aid of a hand-mirror, made a few adjustments to her appearance, she
went in again to tell Skybright of her decision.
‘I’m off to Mrs Lian’s now. Stay in the room while I’m gone, will you? We don’t want
Master Bao calling out and finding nobody there.’
‘Aiyo!’ said Skybright sarcastically. ‘You are the only one who ever thinks about him,
of course. The rest of us just sit around all day doing nothing.’
Aroma merely laughed and went off without replying. As she came within sight of the
water near Drenched Blossoms Bridge, she saw that the lotuses were all dead and
ragged-looking; but the hibiscus-bushes along the banks were just coming into flower,
the pink budding clusters making a brilliant contrast with the bright green of the
leaves. She lingered on her way along the embankment so that she could get a better
view of them. Looking up suddenly from her contemplation of the hibiscus bushes,
she became aware that on the other side of the path a little ahead of her someone
was standing under the grape-vine waving a feather-duster about, apparently dusting
something. When she got a little nearer, she could see that it was that indefatigable
gardener, Mamma Zhu. Recognizing Aroma, the old woman beamed and came up to
greet her.
‘It’s not often you find time to go out walking, miss?’
‘No, indeed,’ said Aroma. ‘I’m on my way to see Mrs Lian. What are you doing?’
‘I’m trying to keep these wasps off the grapes,’ said the old woman. ‘There was
very little rain in the dog-days this year, consequently it’s brought the pests out onto
all the fruit. It gets riddled all over with bites and a lot of it is dropping before it’s ripe.
These wasps are terrible things. You’d never credit it. They’ll go for just two or three
grapes in a bunch, but the juice drips from them onto the rest, and then the whole
bunch is spoiled. Look at that, miss! A whole lot more of them have settled just in the
time we have been talk?ing.’
‘Even if you keep at it non-stop with that duster of yours, you’re not going to keep
off more than a few of them,’ said Aroma. ‘Why don’t you ask one of the buyers to
get a lot of muslin bags made for you, to tie over the bunches? They will keep off the
birds and wasps while still allowing the air to get at them.’
‘I certainly will,’ said the old woman. ‘What a clever idea! I’ve never heard of that
one before - but then this is the first year I’ve had the job, you see.’ She smiled. ‘Look,
miss, although so many of the grapes are spoiled, they still taste good. Let me pick
you some to try.’
Aroma looked serious.
‘No, no. I don’t think they’re ripe enough to eat yet, in any case; but even if they
were, I couldn’t possibly eat any before the first-fruits have been offered to the
ancestors. Surely a person who has worked as many years for the family as you have
must know that rule?’
‘Of course, miss. You are quite right,’ said the old woman hurriedly. ‘It was being so
pleased that put it for the moment from my mind. I am a foolish old woman.’
‘It doesn’t really matter,’ said Aroma. ‘But you older servants ought not to set us
younger ones a bad example.’
She continued on her way then, out of the Garden and round to Xi-feng’s place. As
she entered the courtyard, she could hear the sound of Xi-feng’s raised voice coming
from inside the house.
‘It’s monstrous! Treating me like a criminal, after all I’ve had to put up with in this
place!’
Whatever the background of this remark might be, it was obvious to Aroma that this
would be an extremely inopportune moment to go in; and yet it was already too late
for her to turn back. The best she could do was to advertise her presence. She
deliberately made a heavier noise with her feet and called out to Patience through
the window. Patience came hurrying out to welcome her.
‘Is Mrs Lian in?’ Aroma asked her. ‘Is she quite better yet?’
By now she was inside the house; but Xi-feng had already had time to get up on the
couch and pretend that she had been lying down. She rose to her feet as Aroma
entered.
‘Yes, I am a little better, thank you. It is kind of you to remember me. It seems quite
a time since you last came round here.’
‘Knowing you weren’t well, I ought by rights to have been coming every day,’ said
Aroma. ‘On the other hand, when you arc poorly, you need lots of peace and quiet
for resting, and I was afraid that if I came too often it might disturb you.’
‘Oh, I don’t mind the disturbance,’ said Xi-feng smiling.
‘But I realize that it isn’t easy for you to get away from Master Bao. Although he has
so many girls to wait on him, you are the one he really relies on. Patience tells me
you are always asking her how I am; so you see, even though you can’t get over here,
I know that you are concerned about me.’
She asked Patience to bring a stool over and put it down beside the couch she was
reclining on for Aroma to sit on. Felicity came in with some tea. Aroma inclined
herself politely as she accepted it and murmured something about Felicity troubling
herself.

While she was talking to Xi-feng, she noticed a junior maid go up to Patience in the
outer room and quietly announce that Brightie had arrived and was waiting at the
inner gate. She heard Patience answer the girl in the same guarded undertone:
‘Good. Tell him to go away for a few minutes and come back later. Tell him not to
hang about outside this courtyard.’
Aroma knew from this that Xi-feng must have business of some kind, so after sitting
for a minute or two longer, she got up to go. Xi-feng made no attempt to stop her.
‘Come again when you can,’ she said. ‘It does me good to talk to you.’
She summoned Patience to see Aroma out. As Aroma followed Patience through the
outer room, she saw two or three junior maids waiting there, obviously scared out of
their wits and looking as if they scarcely dared to breathe. Aroma passed through the
courtyard gate and continued on her way back alone, wondering what could be the
matter.
As soon as she had finished seeing off Aroma, Patience went in again to report to
Xi-feng.
‘Brightie came, but because Aroma was here, I said he was to go and wait in the
front. Shall I have him called in now straight away, or shall I let him wait a bit? What
do you want me to do?’
‘Call him in,’ said Xi-feng.
‘Tell me,’ said Xi-feng in the interval while they were waiting for him to arrive, ‘what
exactly was it you heard?’
‘It was that girl I sent out just now who actually heard it,” said Patience. ‘She said
that while she was waiting at the inner gate, she heard two of the pages talking to
each other on the other side of it. One of them said, “The new mistress is even
prettier than the old one and ever so much better-tempered.” Then she heard
someone else - she thought it might have been Brightie - telling the other two off.
“What’s this ‘new mistress’ ‘old mistress’ you’re talking about? You’d better keep
your voices down. If anyone inside gets to hear about this, you’ll have your tongues
cut out!”’
At this point one of the junior maids came in.
‘Brightie’s waiting outside, ma’am.’
A chilling little laugh from Xi-feng.
‘Tell him to come in.’
The little maid went outside again.
‘The mistress says you are to come in.’
‘Hei!’
Brightie stepped smartly inside, dropped his knee to the ground, and ended up
standing stiffly to attention in the doorway leading to the inner room.
‘Come here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I want to talk to you.’
Brightie came into the room and stood in front of his mistress, a little to one side.
‘Your master’s got himself a woman outside,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Did you know?’
Brightie dropped his knee to the ground once more.
‘I spend all my time on call at the inner gate, madam. I’ve no means of knowing
what the master does outside.’
Xi-feng’s smile was full of malice.
‘Of course you wouldn’t know. You wouldn’t stop other people talking about if you
did, would you?’
Brightie realized from this that the words he had recently been saying to the other
pages must have been overheard and that it would be impossible now to deceive her.
He fell on his knees to reply.
‘I really don’t know, madam. I just happened to hear Joker and Happy talking a lot
of nonsense, so I shouted to them to be quiet; but I really couldn’t tell you the exact
circumstances they were talking about; I should only be making it up if I tried. You
want to ask Joker, madam. When the master’s here, he spends most of his time with
him outside.’
Xi-feng spat with great force.
‘Black-hearted, worthless scum the lot of you! You are all in league against me, do
you think I don’t know? Go out and find that little pimp Joker and bring him here.
And don’t go away when you’ve done that, either. Wait here. I’ll have a few questions
to ask you when I’ve finished with him. – Wonderful!’ she commented to herself.
‘This is my trusted servant whom I employ on all my most confidential business!’
‘Yes, madam. Very good, madam.’
Brightie knocked his head upon the floor, then scrambled to his feet and went off to
look for Joker.
Joker was in the counting-house fooling about with some of the other pages when
word came to him that he was ‘wanted by Mrs Lian’. Startled, but never for a
moment imagining that his master’s secret had been blown, he hurried off after
Brightie to Xi-feng’s apartment to find out why he was wanted. When they got there,
Brightie went in first.
     ‘Joker is here, madam.’
     ‘Bring him in!’
Even before he had seen her, the mere sound of that strident summons was enough
to throw Joker’s thoughts into confusion. But there was nothing for it: he had to
screw up his courage and follow Brightie into the inner room.
‘Well, my little man,’ said Xi-feng as he entered, ‘this is a fine thing you and your
master have been up to! I think you had better tell me all about it.
Joker heard the words, he saw the anger in Xi-feng’s face and the terrified looks of
the maids who stood motionless to left and right of her, and his legs became so weak
that he sank involuntarily to his knees and began kotowing.
‘I’ve been told that this business has really nothing to do with you,’ she said. ‘Your
only fault is in not having come to me and reported it. I am willing to overlook that if
you tell me the truth. But woe betide you if you tell me a single word that is false! If
you had a dozen heads, I should have each one of them!’
Joker rose up, trembling, to his knees:
‘What is it the master and I have done wrong that you want to know about,
madam?’
It was as though the fire that smouldered in Xi-feng had suddenly burst into flame.
‘Strike the mouth that said that!’ she shouted, beside herself.
Brightie advanced, with hand upraised, to do her bidding.
‘Not you, idiot!’ Xi-feng shouted. ‘I am asking him to strike himself. Don’t worry, I
shall have you striking your own mouth too before we are finished!’
      Joker, still kneeling, began opening his arms to left and right of him and bringing
them forcibly together, so as to slap his hands simultaneously upon his face. Xi-feng
allowed him to do this a dozen or more times before shouting to him to stop.
‘Now,’ she said, ‘what’s all this about the “new mistress” your master has married?
I suppose you are going to tell me you know nothing about it?’
Joker, gathering from this that the whole story was out, became quite desperate.
Plucking his hat off he began bumping his head on the floor in a frenzy of
self-abasement.
‘Only spare my life, madam! I swear that every word I tell you shall be the truth.’
‘Get on with it, then!’
Joker knelt stiffly upright in order to do so.
‘I didn’t know about this business at the beginning, madam. I think it started during
the time when Sir Jing’s body was still lying at the temple. Yu Lu went out there one
day to ask Mr Zhen for some money and when Master Rong came back into the city
to see about it, the master came with him. On their way they got talking about Mrs
Zhen’s two sisters, and the master said how much he admired the new mistress - er,
the other Mrs Lian, and Master Rong, he said, joking-like -,
Xi-feng spat.
‘Turtle’s egg! What “other Mrs Lian”?’
‘Beg pardon, ma’am!’ said Joker hurriedly, and kotowed again.
When he had risen once more on his knees, he fixed his eyes miserably on the ceiling,
unable to go on.
‘Well?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is that all? Why don’t you go on?’
‘You’ll have to bear with me, madam,’ said the wretched Joker, ‘otherwise I daren’t.’
‘Bear with you?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Bear with your mother’s arsehole! I advise you to get
on with your story: it will be very much better for you if you do!’
‘Master Rong said he could arrange for the master to marry her. The master was
very pleased. Then - well, I don’t know how exactly, but he did.’
The very faintest of smiles hovered briefly over Xi-feng’s face.
‘I don’t suppose you do know. No doubt if you did, it would make a very
complicated story. All right, go on. What happened after that?’
‘After that Master Rong found the master a house.’
‘Oh?’ said Xi-feng sharply. ‘Where is it?’
‘A few streets behind our place,’ said Joker. ‘Not very far.’
‘So!’ Xi-feng turned and looked hard at Patience. ‘You heard that? You and I are
both dead, Patience. We don’t exist any more!’
Patience dared not reply.
Joker continued his story.
‘Mr Zhen gave a lot of money to the Zhangs so that they wouldn’t object to the
wedding.’
‘Now we have a Zhang family in the story,’ said Xi-feng. ‘This is getting rather
complicated.’
‘Ah yes, you see, madam, the other Mrs Lian -’
Joker suddenly realized what he had said and dealt himself a slap across the mouth.
Xi-feng laughed in spite of herself and the maids to right and left of her puckered up
their faces and giggled. Joker thought for a bit.
‘The elder of Mrs Zhen’s two sisters – ’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Get on with it! What about her?’
‘The elder of Mrs Zhen’s two sisters was engaged when she was little to someone
called Zhang. I think his name is Zhang Hua. Nowadays he and his family are very
poor beggars, almost. Mr Zhen promised them some money in return for breaking off
the engagement.’
Xi-feng nodded, then turned to look at the maids: ‘You hear this, all of you? This is
the little monster who was telling us a few minutes ago that he didn’t know
anything!’
Joker continued:
‘After that Mr Lian had the new house redecorated and she came there for the
wedding.’
‘Where from?’ said Xi-feng.
‘From her mother’s place,’ said Joker.
‘Hm, I see. Was she escorted by anyone?’
‘Only Master Rong and a few maids and nannies. No one else.’
‘What about Mrs Zhen?’
‘She came along a couple of days later with some presents.’
Xi-feng laughed and turned to address Patience behind her.
‘There you are! Don’t you remember there were a couple of days when he hardly
stopped praising Mrs Zhen and telling us what a wonderful person she was?’
The smile on her face quickly vanished as she turned back again.
‘And who waits on them there? - You, of course.’
Joker hurriedly kotowed but did not attempt to reply.
‘Come to think of it,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I suppose all those times he told me he had to be
away because he had business to do for our Ning-guo cousins, it was really this that
he was up to.’
‘Sometimes he really was doing things for them, sometimes he was at the new
house,’ said Joker.
‘Who’s living with her there?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Her mother and her younger sister - leastways, the younger sister was living with
her, but the day before yesterday she cut her throat.’
‘Why did she do that?’ said Xi-feng.
Joker told her the whole story of San-jie and Liu Xiang-lian.
‘He was a lucky man,’ said Xi-feng when he had finished telling it. ‘I’ve no doubt
that if he’d married her she would have made him a most notorious cuckold. - Have
you anything else to tell me?’
‘I’ve told you all I know, madam, and every word I’ve told you is true. You can ask
other people. If you find a word of a lie in what I’ve told you, you can beat me to
death and I shan’t complain.’
Xi-feng bowed her head for some moments, reflecting. Eventually she looked up
again and pointed her finger at him.
‘You are a wicked little wretch and I ought by rights to kill you for imagining that
you could deceive me. I suppose you thought that by deceiving me you would do
that stupid master of yours a favour and your new mistress would love you for it. If it
weren’t that I thought you were too frightened just now to have lied to me, I should
have broken both your legs.’ Her voice rose to a shout. ‘Get up!’
Joker kotowed several times, scrambled to his feet, and retreated as far as the
threshold of the outer room, not daring to leave altogether.
‘Come back!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t finished with you yet.’
Joker turned and advanced some steps and stood with his arms held stiffly at his
sides and his body inclined forwards in a respectful attitude of attention.
‘What’s the hurry?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is your new mistress waiting to give you
something?’
Joker dared not look up.
‘From now on you are not to go there any more,’ said Xi-feng. ‘From now on, if I call
for you at any time of any day, I shall expect you to be there straight away - and I
warn you, you’d better see to it that I’m not kept waiting! All right. Be off!’
Again he withdrew. This time he got as far as the steps outside the door.
‘Joker!’
‘Madam?’ He turned back once more.
‘Off to tell the master all about it, aren’t you?’
‘Oh no, madam! I wouldn’t dare.’
‘All right, go then; but if you breathe a word of this outside, I’ll have you flayed!’
‘Yes, madam. Very good, madam.’
Joker now made his final exit.
‘Brightie!’ Xi-feng called.
‘Yes’m!’ Brightie came bounding forward.
Xi-feng opened her eyes very wide and stared at him for the length of time it would
take to say two or three sentences; then finally she spoke.
‘So, Brightie. Very good. Excellent. Now go. And if anyone outside breathes a word
about this, I shall hold you responsible.’
‘Yes’m.’
Brightie withdrew very slowly from her presence; but in his case there was no recall.
‘Pour the tea,’ said Xi-feng.
This was taken by the junior maids as a signal for them to withdraw, which they did
immediately, leaving Xi-feng alone with Patience.
‘You heard all that?’ said Xi-feng. ‘That’s good.’
Patience smiled, but dared not say anything.
Xi-feng appeared to be thinking, and to be growing angrier and angrier the more she
thought. She lay back with her head on the pillow and gave herself up wholly to her
thoughts. Presently she frowned as if an idea had just occurred to her.
‘Patience, come here.’
‘Madam?’
‘I’ve thought what to do,’ said Xi-feng. And she proceeded to tell Patience what she
had planned.
But in order to know what that was, you must wait for the following chapter.
CHAPTER 68

Er-jie takes up residence
in Prospect Garden
And Xi-feng makes a disturbance
in Ning-guo House



When Jia Lian made his second expedition to Ping-an in the tenth month, he found
that the Military Governor was away on a tour of inspection; and since no one
seemed willing to predict when he would be back, there was obviously nothing he
could do but sit in his lodgings and wait for that elusive official to turn up. It was in
fact several weeks before he did, so that by the time Jia Lian had finished transacting
his business and made the journey back home again, almost two months had elapsed
since he set out.
      But we anticipate. Let us return to the point at which we left off in the last
chapter.
      After hearing Joker’s revelations, Xi-feng deliberately concealed her knowledge
from Jia Lian for several weeks. It was not until he had started out on his journey to
Ping-an that she began putting her plan into execution.
      The first thing she did was to call in the workmen - carpenters, decorators,
paperers and so forth - and have the three-frame building on the east side of her and
Jia Lian’s courtyard converted into a smaller replica of the main apartment. On the
fourteenth of the tenth month, when the decorating and furnishing of this apartment
had been completed, she went to see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and
announced her intention of going out first thing next morning to burn incense in a
certain convent-temple in the vicinity. She would take only four companions with her,
she said: Patience, Felicity, Zhou Rui’s wife and Brightie’s wife. She waited until they
were about to get into their carriages on the morning of the fifteenth before
revealing to her companions what their actual destination was to be. They were
going to Er-jie’s house. Xi-feng had previously given instructions to the manservants
who were to accompany them that they were to be dressed in mourning and that the
carriage she rode in was to have mourning trappings. This was because Er-jie, she
had discovered, had not long since suffered a second and greater bereavement: old
Mrs You, who had never quite recovered from the shock caused by her third
daughter’s suicide, had, only two or three weeks previous to this date, taken a nap
which turned out to be her last. Joker was told to lead the way, and it was he who,
arriving at the house a little before the rest of the party, knocked on the gate to give
the occupants warning of its coming. The Mattress came to the door. Joker had by
this time resolved the problem of nomenclature to his own satisfaction:
      ‘Tell Mrs Er,’ he said blandly, ‘that Mrs Lian is here.’
      The immortal parts of the late Droopy’s relict leaped through her cranium and
described several somersaults in the air. She rushed inside to inform her mistress.
Er-jie was no less startled than her servant when she heard the message, but even in
such an extremity she could do no less than receive her visitor with the expected
courtesies. Adjusting her dress, therefore, she went into the front courtyard to meet
her. By this time Xi-feng’s carriage had arrived outside the gate and its occupants
were in process of descending from it. Er-jie watched her visitor curiously as she
entered the outer gate, supported by Zhou Rui’s wife and Brightie’s wife, one on
either side. She was dressed in half-mourning, with hair-ornaments of silver and
white and a spencer of some black material with a silver thread in it over the palest
of pale blue gowns. Underneath the gown she was wearing a plain white satin skirt.
Er-jie was particularly struck by her eyes:
       Brows a branched twig with two high-pendant leaves,
And trigon phoenix-eyes, slant, hard and bright.
And she was very beautiful:
     Pretty as a peach-tree in the spring,
Even in austere autumn’s dress.
      Er-jie advanced to meet her as she entered the courtyard and dropped her a low
curtsey, adopting, in the first words she uttered, the form of address that an inferior
wife uses in speaking to her chief.
‘Forgive me, sister, I had no idea that you were planning to favour me with an
inspection or I should have gone out?side to meet you.’
This was followed by another low curtsey, which Xi-feng, smiling graciously, returned.
After curtseying had continued for some moments on either side, Xi-feng took Er-jie
impulsively by the hand and the two young women walked hand in hand into the
house. Inside, Er-jie made Xi-feng sit down in the place of honour and ordered one of
the maids to bring a cushion and put it down in front of her on the floor.
‘I am still very young,’ she explained to Xi-feng. ‘Since I first came here, everything
has been decided for me by others, either my mother, when she was still with us, or
my elder sister. Now that you have come, I hope - if you do not think me too
unworthy - that you will allow me to take all my instructions from you. I promise to
serve you with all the devotion of which I am capable.’
Having concluded her little speech, she knelt down on the cushion and kotowed.
Xi-feng rose from the chair and bowed.
‘I am as young and inexperienced as you are, sister,’ she said. ‘What I have done for
Mr Lian has always been for his own good, as far as a silly, inexperienced woman like
me could tell what that was. I begged him, as I am sure you would have done in my
position, not to go sleeping out “under the willows” (you know what I mean) both for
his health’s sake and because I knew it would worry his parents; but Mr Lian
completely misunderstood the spirit in which that advice was offered. It wouldn’t
have mattered so much if he’d deceived me about taking a mistress; but marrying a
second wife is a very serious business. He really ought to have told me. It isn’t as if I
hadn’t begged him to take a second wife. If he were to have a son, no matter by
whom, I should stand to benefit as much as he would. It would be a support for me
in my old age. But no. Mr Lian has got it firmly fixed in his mind that I am the sort of
jealous woman who cannot tolerate a rival. And so he has to go off and do this
without telling me. It’s so unfair. Who am I to explain myself to? Only Heaven above
knows what a great injustice he has done me. When I first got wind of your marriage
about ten days ago, I realized at once that it was this mistaken notion he has about
my being so jealous that had prevented him from telling me. I have waited until he is
away before visiting you because I wanted this opportunity of getting to know you
properly. But that is not the only purpose of my visit. I want to ask you - to entreat
you - to show your understanding of my position by leaving this place and coming
back with me to the mansion. Let us live together, side by side, like sisters. Let us join
forces in looking after him: seeing that he performs his duties properly and takes
good care of his health. Surely that is how it ought to be? Just imagine what it will be
like for me if you continue living here outside. Quite apart from my feelings, think of
the effect it will have on my reputation - and on yours, too, for that matter. And even
if you think our reputations are unimportant, as no doubt they are, consider what
the effect will be on Mr Lian’s reputation, which is a far more serious matter. I expect
the servants say all sorts of nasty things about me behind my back. It is their way of
having their revenge on me for being strict. I suppose it is only natural. You know the
proverb. The woman who runs a household is like a water butt: all the dirt washes off
on her. In our household I have three lots of seniors above me and cousins and
sisters-?in-law both single and married in my own generation. If I were really hard to
get on with, how do you think all those people would have managed to put up with
me for so long? Would I have come to you today if I were such a terrible person?
Many wives hearing that their husband had married another woman and was living
outside with her in secret would be unwilling even to set eyes on her. Heaven knows
I’ve tried to accommodate Mr Lian. I’ve even offered him my Patience as a
chamber-wife. I think Heaven and Earth and the Lord Buddha must have taken pity
on me in letting me know about this marriage. They didn’t want me to be destroyed
by a pack of scandal-mongering servants. That’s why I am asking you to come and
live with me. I promise that your treatment will be exactly the same as mine in every
respect: accommodation, service, clothing-allowance, everything. There is so much
that an intelligent person like you could do to help me if you had a mind to. Working
side by side together, we shall not only give the lie to this malicious tittle-tattle of the
servants which I find so wounding; we shall also be able to show Mr Lian when he
gets back how wrong he has been in making me out to be jealous. The three of us
will live in perfect harmony together. And all this I shall owe to you! But if you won’t
come with me, I am perfectly prepared to move in here with you. Provided that you
put in an occasional good word for me with Mr Lian so that I am still left some
ground to stand on, I should even be willing to hold your basin and comb your hair
for you and wait on you like a servant.’
      She concluded this discourse by breaking into noisy weeping. Indeed, so pitiful a
spectacle did she present that Er-jie herself could not help weeping with her. After
further bowings and curtseyings the two women sat down together as first and
second wife and Patience came forward to make Er-jie her kotow. From the superior
quality of her dress and general air of refinement Er-jie could guess who she was and
hurriedly rose to prevent her.
      ‘No, no, you mustn’t do that! You and I are equals.’
Xi-feng stood up, too.
      ‘Nonsense! Let her kotow to you,’ she said, laughing. ‘She is only a maid. She is
your maid as much as mine now and in future you must treat her as such.’
      She ordered Zhou Rui’s wife to take the First Meeting presents out of the bag
she was carrying: four lengths of best quality dress material and four pairs of pearl
and gold earrings with hair ornaments to match. There was more bowing and
curtseying as Er-jie received them. The two wives sat down once more. Tea was
served, and they began to talk things over as they sipped their tea. Xi-feng insisted
that what had happened had chiefly come about through her own fault.
      ‘I blame no one else,’ she said. ‘All I am asking for is a little sympathy.’
     Er-jie was so lacking in guile herself that she had no difficulty in believing that
Xi-feng was a good woman who had been slandered.
‘After all,’ she told herself when she recollected the alarming things that Joker had
said about Xi-feng’s character, ‘servants do often revenge themselves by saying nasty
things about their employers.’
And so, abandoning all caution, she began pouring her heart out unreservedly,
confident that in Xi-feng she had found a friend. Confirmation of this favourable view
in the form of tributes to the excellence of Xi-feng’s household governance were not
wanting from Mesdames Zhou and Brightie in the background.
‘She puts herself out too much for other people, that’s her trouble. She gets no
thanks for it, though. People only complain about her the more.’
They told Er-jie about the apartment that Xi-feng had made ready for her.
‘Beautiful, Mrs Er! You wait till you’ve seen it!’
Er-jie longed to live with Jia Lian inside the mansion like a respectable married
woman and was therefore only too willing to comply with Xi-feng’s request.
‘I ought to go back with you, sister: it is no less than my duty. But what about this
place?’
‘Oh, that’s no problem!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Just get the boys to move out your boxes and
bags for you. You won’t be needing the furniture, you can leave that here. All you
need to do is name whoever of your people is most reliable and we will get whoever
it is to stay here and look after it for you.’
‘Now that I’ve met you, I should like to leave all those sort of decisions to you,’ said
Er-jie hurriedly. ‘I haven’t been here very long and have no experience of running a
household. I’m not able to decide things like this for myself. Why don’t you take
charge of these chests and boxes, sister? I have got hardly any things of my own.
Almost everything in this place belongs to Mr Lian.’
Xi-feng told Zhou Rui’s wife to make a mental note of all the movables and have them
carried over later to Er-jie’s new apartment. She then urged Er-jie to dress herself as
quickly as possible for going out, and as soon as she was ready, walked hand in hand
with her to the waiting carriage. Inside the carriage she insisted that Er-jie should sit
beside her on the same seat.
‘This is rather a strait-laced household we are going into,’ Xi-feng confided to Er-jie
when they were alone in the carriage together. ‘Neither the old lady nor Lady Wang
knows a word yet about your marriage. They would probably kill Mr Lian if they
found out that he had married you while he was still in mourning. There is a very
large garden at the mansion which all the young people live in and which other
people very seldom go into. I think when we get back it would be better if you didn’t
meet Their Ladyships straight away but stayed in there for a few days while I think of
some way of explaining about you to them.’
‘I leave all that to you, sister,’ said Er-jie. ‘I will do whatever you think best.’
The boys accompanying the carriage had received advance instructions not to enter
the mansion by the main gate on their return journey but to go straight in at the back.
Descend?ing from the carriage on her arrival, Xi-feng, having first shooed away a knot
of curious bystanders, led Er-jie through the rear entrance of Prospect Garden and
took her to meet Li Wan and the girls in Sweet-rice Village.
By this time nine out of ten of the Garden’s inhabitants had heard about Jia Lian’s
second marriage, and when the news spread that Xi-feng was bringing the new wife
into the Garden, curiosity drew numbers of them to Li Wan’s place to meet her. All
were impressed by her beauty and by her gentle, pleasing manner. After introducing
them, Xi-feng warned each of them individually that she would kill anyone who
mentioned Er-jie’s presence to an outsider. The nannies and maids who worked in
the Garden were all terrified of Xi-feng and knew in any case that Jia Lian’s marrying
a new wife in a period of family and national mourning was a very serious offence.
They needed no persuading, therefore, to have as little to do with the matter as
possible.
Xi-feng had a private word with Li Wan requesting her to look after Er-jie for a few
days while she herself thought of some way of explaining about her to Grandmother
Jia and Lady Wang. Li Wan knew that Xi-feng already had an apartment ready for
Er-jie to move into at her own place and could well understand that a certain amount
of secrecy had to be maintained about a marriage contracted when in mourning; she
could not therefore refuse to give Er-jie temporary lodging.
Xi-feng took Er-jie’s own maids away from her and substituted a servant of her own.
She also gave secret instructions to the older women to keep an eye on Er-jie,
threatening them with the direst penalties if they allowed her to stray outside or
deliberately run away. Having thus disposed of Er-jie for the time being, she went off
to attend to the next stage of her plans. But of that, for the moment, we will say
nothing.
Everyone who knew about this affair was mystified by the strange forbearance that
Xi-feng had so far shown towards her rival and could not help wondering what had
come over her. Er-jie for her part, observing how well all the young people in the
Garden got on together, felt thoroughly reassured about her future in the bosom of
so delightful a family.
But then, after a few days had gone by, there was an unpleasant incident with Mercy,
the new maid whom Xi-feng had given her in place of her own. Er-jie had run out of
hair-oil and told Mercy to run over to Xi-feng’s and ask her for some.
‘I think you might be a bit more considerate, Mrs Er,’ the maid said insolently.
‘Every day of her life Mrs Lian has to dance attendance on Their Ladyships and Lady
Xing, she has two or three hundred servants waiting from daybreak every morning
for a word from her to tell them what to do, she has at least a dozen important
matters and thirty or forty little ones to deal with every day, all the family’s social
contacts to attend to, from Her Grace at the Palace and princes and dukes and other
high-ups down to other families like our own, thousands of taels of silver to approve
the spending of - and you want to go bothering her for some hair-oil! My advice to
you, madam, is to be a bit more patient. After all, your marriage to Mr Lian was
rather a hole-and-corner affair, wasn’t it? It’s only because of Mrs Lian’s unheard of
generosity that you have been treated so well. A less tolerant person might have
turned you out into the gutter - and not much you could have done to stop them!’
At the end of this verbal drubbing Er-jie could only hang her head in silence. If that
was what other people thought about her, minor inconveniences like the lack of
hair-oil would have to be endured.
But that was not the end of it. Following this outburst, Mercy began to grow more
and more careless about serving Er-jie’s meals. Either they came much too early or
much too late, and the food she brought consisted invariably of stale old left-overs.
Er-jie once or twice tried speaking to her about it, but Mercy only glared at her and
lifted her voice up in noisy self-justification. Fearing that if the others heard the
shouting they would think of her as one of those vulgar, shrewish women who are
always quarrelling with their servants, Er-jie felt obliged to drop the matter and put
up with the hardship as best she could.
After a week or so Xi-feng came to visit her. She was all smiles and loving sympathy,
‘my dear’ this and ‘my dear’ that.
‘If the servants are not giving you satisfaction, my dear, or are being insubordinate,
do let me know and I shall have them beaten.’
She turned and spoke harshly to the maids and older women who were present.
‘I know you lot. I know how you bully the gentle ones. It’s only the hard ones like
me that you are afraid of. Once out of my sight you think you can get away with
murder. But take care! If I hear one word of complaint from Mrs Er, I shall have you
slaughtered!’
Er-jie was impressed by the concern that Xi-feng showed for her.
‘With her to stick up for me,’ she thought, ‘there is really no need for me to do
anything myself. Servants often are insolent. If I speak up about this girl and get her
into trouble, people will say that I lack the forbearance that a wife - especially one in
my position - is always supposed to show.’
And so, far from complaining, she covered up for Mercy and the other servants and
insisted that the service they gave her was satisfactory.
*
All this time Brightie was making inquiries on Xi-feng's behalf into Er-jie's background.
He quickly established that Er-jie had indeed been previously betrothed. Her
affianced, now a young man of nineteen, was a gambler and a wastrel. After
gambling his way through all his family's possessions, he had been turned out of
doors by his father and now made the gambling-dens his home. The fact that his
father had been to see Mrs You and received twenty taels from her in return for
breaking off the engagement was still unknown to him. The name of this
unpromising youth was, as Joker had said, Zhang Hua. When Brightie passed this
information on to Xi-feng, she promptly wrapped twenty taels up in a packet and told
him to go back and promise them to Zhang Hua if he would bring a written
indictment against Jia Lian before the court. It should say that Jia Lian had, in a
period of both national and private mourning and without the knowledge or consent
of his parents, brought unlawful pressure to bear on the plaintiff's parents, causing
them to break off an existing engagement between the plaintiff and his betrothed,
and had then, setting his own wife aside in an unlawful manner, taken to wife the
plaintiff's betrothed in her stead.
A strong instinct of self-preservation at first prompted Zhang Hua to refuse. When
Brightie told Xi-feng this she was furious. A young idiot, she called him; a lame dog
who wouldn't allow one to help him over the stile.
‘You will have to explain it to him very carefully. Tell him he can charge this family
with high treason for all I care; all I want is a pretext for making it hot for them. But
tell him that if things show any sign of getting too hot, I am perfectly well able to cool
them down again.’
Another idea occurred to her as Brightie was on the point of leaving.
‘He could put your name on the indictment,’ she said. ‘Then you could go along to
the court and answer it yourself.’
She gave him careful instructions as to what in that event he should say and do,
assuring him that she would be able to handle the consequences herself. Confident
of her support, Brightie persuaded Zhang Hua to write out an indictment in which he
himself would be named.
‘ “Lai" is the surname,’ he said. ‘Put “Brightie Lai was principal agent of the
accused.” You can say that everything Mr Lian did he was put up to doing by me.’
What Brightie was now proposing seemed to Zhang Hua much less risky than what
he had suggested previously, and after some preliminary discussion about the exact
form that the indictment should take, he wrote it out and went along with it next
morning to the Court of Censors to ‘cry injury’ on the steps outside. An usher came
out to relieve him of it and take it inside to their lordships, and in due course the
court came into session and the presiding Censor found himself reading a bill of
indictment in which a certain ‘Brightie Lai, servant of the above’ appeared as chief
accomplice of the accused. Under the circumstances it seemed most expedient to
have ‘Brightie Lai, servant of the above’ summoned before the court.
Somewhat overawed by the prospect of making an arrest in Rong-guo House, the
blackcoats sent one of their number ahead of them with a message; but Brightie,
who was expect?ing the summons, intercepted the messenger and was outside in
the street waiting for them when they arrived. He stepped forward and offered
himself to them with a disarming smile.
‘I’m afraid you have been troubled on my account, gentlemen, for I think I must be
the person you have come for. Here you are: slip your chain on!’
He stretched his neck out in readiness; but the blackcoats declined.
‘That’s all right, brother. You just come along quietly. Nobody’s going to put any
chains on you!’
When Brightie arrived in the court he knelt down facing the tribunal, side by side
with Zhang Hua but at a little distance away from him. The Censor ordered him to be
shown the indictment, and Brightie, although he had virtually dictated it himself,
affected to study it very carefully. When he had finished doing so, he handed it back
again and kotowed.
‘I know all about this, my lord. It’s true what it says there about my master, but it
wasn’t really anything to do with me. Zhang Hua has only dragged me into it because
he has a personal grudge against me. The person who put my master up to all this
was someone else. Your Lordship ought to ask him about this other person.’
It was Zhang Hua’s turn now to kotow.
‘There is another person involved, my lord, but I didn’t dare to accuse him, so I put
one of the servants’ names instead.’
Brightie pretended to be indignant.
‘Tell his lordship who it is, you fool! This is a court of law we are in and one of the
Emperor’s judges you are speaking to. You’ve got to tell him the name of the person,
no matter who it is.’
Zhang Hua admitted that Jia Rong was the person in question, whereupon the Censor,
very much against his inclination, had to issue a summons for Jia Rong.
Xi-feng had secretly sent her page Cheerful to the court to see if the case was going
forward. When he came back to her with this news, she hastily sent for a member of
her father’s household called Wang Xin, explained to him what had been happening,
and told him to see the Censor on her behalf. He was to persuade the Censor to give
Jia Rong a good scare, but not to proceed to any damaging judgement against him.
She also gave him three hundred taels with which to streng?then his persuasion.
That night Wang Xin saw the Censor in his private chambers and obligingly supplied
him with a little ‘background infor?mation’ to the case. The Censor had a pretty good
idea of what was expected of him. He took the proffered bribe with? out demur and
agreed that at the next hearing it would almost certainly be discovered that Zhang
Hua was a thoroughly worthless character who had brought these trumped-up
charges against the Jias because he owed them money and could not pay it back.
Wang Xin also obtained a brief interview with the President of the Court of Censors
at his private residence. The President was an old friend of Xi-feng’s uncle, Wang
Zi-teng. He had observed that the defendants in this case were all members of the Jia
family and was most anxious that it should be disposed of as expeditiously and with
as little fuss as possible. He had made no recommendation for special action against
the defendants as holders of commissions under the Crown, but merely confirmed
what the Censor of the day had already decided: that Jia Rong should be summoned
and should be required to answer the indictment.
By this time Xi-feng’s discovery and Er-jie’s removal into Prospect Garden were
already known about in Ning-guo House, and Jia Rong and his father were anxiously
discussing this latest development in Jia Lian’s affairs when someone arrived to give
warning of the impending summons and urge them to think quickly what they would
do. Jia Rong, who had gone into the front part of the mansion to receive the
messenger, came rushing back in a panic to tell his father.
‘The man has an infernal nerve!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I thought I’d taken sufficient
precautions against anything like this happening.’
He sealed two hundred taels up in a packet and sent it as a sweetener to the Censor.
At the same time he ordered one of his senior domestics to go and answer the
summons. He and Jia Rong were still discussing this new crisis when a cry went up
that ‘Mrs Lian of Rong-guo House’ had arrived. This was a most unpleasant surprise.
Father and son both attempted to make a getaway, but Xi-feng was already inside the
courtyard before they could disappear.
‘Ah, the head of the family!’ she called after the elder of the two retreating backs.
‘You’ve been putting your cousin up to some nice tricks lately, haven’t you?’
Jia Rong, as a junior, was obliged to go back and greet her. She seized him by the
hand and marched on, with him in tow, towards the interior of the mansion.
‘Take good care of your aunt, Rong,’ Cousin Zhen called out after them. ‘Tell them
to slaughter some fresh meat for her dinner.’
He called for his horse and went off to hide himself elsewhere.
Xi-feng walked through into the main sitting-room inside. You-shi came out of the
inner room to greet her.
‘What is it, Feng?’ she asked, observing Xi-feng’s ugly expression. ‘Something has
upset you.’
Xi-feng spat in her face.
‘Nobody else wanted that precious sister of yours, so you had to foist her onto our
family. Anyone would think all the other men in the world had died and only our Jia
ones were left! But even if you’d set your heart on marrying her to a Jia, at least you
might have done it properly, with go-betweens and witnesses and everything open
and above-board. At least we should all have known where we were then and been
able to keep up some sort of appearances. I can’t think what could have come over
you. Was it some phlegm that got into your heart? Was it rouge you’d swallowed,
clogging up your thinking-tubes? Just what was it that made you think you could
marry her to him at a time like that - a time when he was in double mourning: state
mourning and family mourning? Now, thanks to you, we’ve got someone suing us: so
even the people in the law-courts know what a jealous shrew I am and I have to sit
by as helpless as a crab with no legs while total strangers discuss my character and
wonder why my husband doesn't divorce me. What have I done wrong since I came
to this place that you should want to treat me like this? Is it something that Grandma
or Aunt Wang said that has made you set this trap for me, to get me out of the way?
Let’s go to court together, the two of us, and state our cases; and after that, let’s
come back here and ask for a family council so that we can have it all out into the
open, face to face. You can give me a bill of divorce then if you want to, and I shall go
back to my own people.’
She began to cry noisily, tugging at You-shi’s arm and insisting that she should go
with her to court. Jia Rong, in a desperate attempt to dissuade her, threw himself
down on his knees and knocked his head repeatedly on the floor, entreating his aunt
to ‘control her rage’. Xi-feng let go of You-shi and rounded savagely on Jia Rong.
‘Black-hearted villain! May God’s lightning strike you and the devils tear your
carcase! You’re as stupid as mud, and yet you are forever meddling and interfering in
what doesn’t concern you, forever busybodying away at your dirty, scoundrelly little
plots that in the end will ruin your family and destroy the lot of us. Nobody wants
you - even the ghosts won’t want you when you die, your own mother’s ghost or the
ghosts of your ancestors. Don’t you dare tell me what I ought to do!’
And she began beating him. Jia Rong redoubled the frequency of his kotows.
‘Please, auntie, please! Don’t give way to anger. Don’t think only of what has just
happened: try to remember the good things as well as the bad. I may be very wicked,
but surely in a thousand days there must have been one day when I was good! I
know you have every reason to be angry with me, but there is no need for you to
punish me yourself. I will gladly do it for you if it will help you to overcome your
anger.’
He spread his arms out to left and right of him and began to deal himself hefty slaps
upon both cheeks, prefacing each blow with an interrogation, thus:
'Are you going to go on doing these stupid, meddlesome things in future?' (slap!)
‘Are you going to go on listening to Uncle instead of doing what Auntie tells you?’
(slap!)
‘How can you bear to be so cruel and unnatural to Auntie, when Auntie has always
been so good and kind to you?' (slap!)
The others felt like telling him to stop playing the fool. They also felt like laughing,
but did not dare to. Xi-feng threw herself upon You-shi's bosom, weeping and wailing
in a fine display of histrionic grief.
‘I don’t mind your finding him another wife, but why was it necessary to make him
break the law? Why did you let him do it without his father knowing? And why did
you have to destroy my reputation while you were about it? You and I must go to the
court together before the blackcoats come here and arrest us. After that we can go
next door and have it all out in front of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and all the
rest of the clan. If it’s found that I am an undutiful wife who refuses to let her
husband take a concubine, you can give me a bill of divorce and I shall leave without
a murmur. As a matter of fact I have invited your sister here myself. I haven’t dared
tell Grandmother and Lady Wang about her yet because I was afraid they would be
angry. At the moment she is living in the Garden, like a princess, with nothing but the
best to eat and servants to wait on her hand and foot every minute of the day.
Meanwhile I’ve been getting an apartment ready for her at home which will be
exactly the same as my own. I’d been meaning to move her in there as soon as
Grandmother had been told about her. I was prepared to live in peace and harmony
with her and Lian and to let bygones be bygones. But now it turns out that all the
time she was betrothed to somebody else! What a mess you’ve made of things! Of
course, I knew nothing about this before. When they told me yesterday that I was
being sued, I was panic-stricken. I knew that even if I appeared in court to answer the
charge myself, it was the Jia family that would be disgraced. So I’m afraid I took five
hundred taels of Lady Wang’s money without telling her, to bribe the Censor with.
And even after that, he still has my servant there in custody.’
All this was spoken not as continuous discourse but punctuated by fits of weeping. In
her final outburst the weeping turned almost into a scream as she began invoking her
parents and her ancestors and threatening to hang or drown herself or batter her
brains out against a wall. You-shi, whom all this time she had not let go of, was so
mauled and crumpled that she was beginning to take on some of the aspects of a
piece of well-kneaded dough and various parts of her clothing had become damp and
discoloured with the moisture from Xi-feng’s eyes and nose. As there was nothing
much she could say in answer to Xi-feng, she shouted at Jia Rong instead.
‘Stupid little fool! A fine mess you and your rather have made of things between
you! I said at the time that no good would come of this.’
Xi-feng took You-shi's head in both her hands and, drawing her face close to her own,
pretended to inspect the inside of her mouth.
‘Who’s stupid? There isn’t an aubergine in here. I see no sign of a gag. Why couldn't
you have come and told me? If you had told me about it at the time, none of this
would ever have happened. But no, you have to wait until it has got into the
law-courts and the whole household is in an uproar, and now you start blaming them!
There’s a very old saying: “A good lining gives a garment strength and a husband with
a good wife has few calamities.” If you’d been a good wife to Zhen, he and the others
would never have got up to this mischief. You haven’t the wit to k anything useful;
and as for saying - for all the good sense that ever comes out of your mouth you
might as well be a bottle! You seem to think that you have only got to sit tight and do
nothing and people will praise you for your virtue!’
She spat two or three times in quick succession.
‘I did try,’ said You-shi tearfully. ‘The others here will tell you, if you don’t believe
me. I tried very hard to dissuade them. It’s not my fault that they wouldn’t listen.
What was I supposed to do? But I don’t blame you for being angry. It’s just one more
thing that I shall have to bear.’
All the Ning-guo concubines, maids and womenservants were by now silently
entreating for their mistress, so that the room seemed suddenly to have filled with
row upon row of kneeling figures. The most senior of the servants now smilingly
addressed Xi-feng on her mistress’s behalf.
‘You’re generally such a wise, understanding person, Mrs Lian: even though our
mistress is at fault, you ought not to be too hard on her - leastways, not in front of us
servants. You and our mistress have always been such good friends. Leave her a bit of
face now, please!’
She handed her a cup of tea, but Xi-feng dashed it to the floor. After a bit she did,
however, stop crying and rolled up her hair, which had come undone. But the tone in
which she addressed Jia Rong was still an angry one.
‘Go and fetch your father. There’s something I want to ask him to his face. I want to
ask him about this new rule which says that a man may marry when he is in
mourning, barely thirty-five days after his uncle’s death. It’s something I’ve never
heard of before. I should like him to tell me about it so that I shall be able to teach it
to the younger generation.’
Jia Rong kotowed and remained upon his knees.
‘This business had nothing to do with either of my parents,’ he said, ‘I was the one
who put Uncle up to it. I don’t know what came over me; I must have been out of my
mind. My rather knows nothing about it. If you insist on having it out with him, he
will undoubtedly kill me. I’d rather you punished me yourself - in fact, I should
welcome it. As for the lawsuit, I’m quite incapable of handling a big thing like that
myself. One “bides a broken arm inside one’s sleeve”: surely you, of all people, know
that, Auntie? You’ve got a very silly nephew, I’m afraid, and he has done a very silly
thing. There’s nothing for it, you will just have to deal with the matter for us, as you
would if your cat or your dog had done something naughty and you had to clear up
after it. Imagine you had a good-for-nothing son like me who had got himself into
terrible trouble: wouldn’t you still go on caring for him, in spite of all the suffering he
had caused you?’
He concluded by kotowing again and looked as if he might go on doing so indefinitely.
His pathetic abjectness soon melted Xi-feng; but she could not change her tune too
abruptly when there were so many pairs of eyes watching her. She did not answer
him, therefore, but merely raised him up with a sigh and, wiping her eyes, addressed
herself once more to You-shi.
‘You must forgive me, kinswoman. It’s because I am so young and inexperienced.
When I heard that there was someone suing us, I simply lost my head. That’s why I
have been behaving so badly. As Rong says, “One hides a broken arm inside one’s
sleeve”: I must ask you to forget all those nasty things I was saying just now and have
a word with Zhen on my behalf to see if he can’t get this lawsuit settled out of court.’
‘Certainly.’
‘Of course.’
In their eagerness to reassure her, You-shi and Jia Rong answered her simultaneously.
‘Whatever happens, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong, ‘I promise you that Uncle Lian won’t be
involved. You mentioned just now that you had already had to spend five hundred
taels on this case. Mother and I will certainly find some way of making that good. We
can’t possibly allow you to be out of pocket because of this. That would be
unthinkable. We must ask one thing of you, though. Do, please, cover up for us at the
other house. Please don’t let Grandma and Lady Wang get to know about this!’
Xi-feng answered him scornfully.
‘You were willing enough to go over my head when you planned this thing in the
first place. Now that it’s gone wrong and you need someone to cover up for you,
you’ve decided that you need me after all. I may be stupid, but I’m not that stupid!’
Again she ignored him and addressed herself to You?shi. ‘Your Cousin Lian is my
husband, don’t forget. You all say that you acted as you did out of your concern that
he should have an heir. Well, don’t you think I share in that concern myself? I look on
your sister as if she were my own. I was so happy when I first heard about her and
Lian that I couldn’t sleep all night. I wanted the servants to start decorating a room
for her immediately, so that I could have her to come and live with us. But you know
what servants are. They told me I was too hasty and that I ought to tell Grandmother
and Lady Wang first. I certainly wasn’t going to take that advice, and I threatened
them with all sorts of pains and penalties if they said anything about it to anyone
themselves. Unfortunately my threatening was of no avail. Just as I thought I’d
succeeded in hushing the matter up, the very worst thing happened: a person called
Zhang Hua suddenly popped up out of nowhere and brought a lawsuit against us. I
was so scared that for two nights I didn’t sleep a wink. I didn’t dare tell anyone else
about it. All I could do was to get the servants to try to find out who this Zhang Hua
was and what it was that had made him so bold. After two days investigating they
came back and told me. It seems that he is a thoroughly worthless character - a
down-and-out. “Mrs Er is this man’s betrothed,” they said. “At the present moment
he is so hard up that sooner than die of hunger and cold, he is prepared to do almost
anything. This lawsuit is simply a last desperate attempt to make some money. He
reckons that even if he dies in the attempt it will be a better death than starving.
Anyway,” they said, “you can hardly blame him for trying. The master really has been
a bit hasty: marrying during a period of national mourning is one offence; marrying in
a period of family mourning is another; marrying without parental con?sent is a third;
and marrying bigamously is a fourth. They say that the man sentenced to death by a
thousand cuts will dare to pull the Emperor off his horse. A man like this Zhang Hua
who is crazed by poverty will do anything. With such good arguments in his favour,
he’d be a fool not to sue!” Well now, I ask you! Even if I’d been a forensic genius,
which I’m not, hearing them say that would have been enough to shut me up. What
could I do? Lian was away. There was no one at hand to advise me. All I could think of
was to try and buy him off. But the trouble is, the more you give to people like that,
the more they twist the knife in you and think up more and more pretexts for getting
money out of you. And I am like a boil on a mouse’s tail: there’s a limit to what can
be squeezed out of me. It was because I was feeling so desperate that I -’
‘Don’t worry about the money,’ You-shi and Jia Rong both chimed in, not waiting
for her to finish. ‘That’s something we can certainly take care of for you.’
‘If Zhang Hua is only suing because he wants money,’ said Jia Rong, ‘I think I can
now see what to do. We must promise him money on condition that he will admit
that the charges he brought against us were false ones. Of course, we shall have to
spend a bit of money to see that he isn’t too heavily proceeded against; but once the
case has been dismissed and he has been released, all we have to do is give him the
money we promised, and that should be the end of it.’
Xi-feng tutted and looked amused.
‘Brilliant! No wonder you made such a mess of your match-making if this is the way
you go about things! I always thought that you were intelligent, but I see now that I
was wrong. If we do as you suggest, he will pretend to agree, the case will be called
off, and that will appear to be the end of it. But don’t you see, if you put money into
the hand of a fellow like that, he will get through it in about four or five days and
then think up some other villainy as a means of getting more? Even though we have
nothing to fear from him, he will still be a constant source of worry. What you
propose in any case plays straight into his hands, because it enables him to say that
we must have something to be ashamed of or we wouldn’t be offering him money.’
Jia Rong was a sharp young man and quickly saw what his aunt was driving at.
‘I’ve got another idea,’ he said. ‘Perhaps I should be the one to clear this mess up
after all, since I am the one who got us into it. I shall ask Zhang Hua straight out what
his inten?tions are. Is it definitely Aunt Er he wants, or is he willing to make do with
someone else if we will give him the money? If it is definitely Aunt Er and no one else
will do, I shall simply have to break it to her that she must go and join him.’
‘That’s all very well, but I don’t want to part with your Aunt Er,’ said Xi-feng
hurriedly. ‘In fact, I refuse to hear of it. Even suppose she were willing, what would
people think of us if we allowed her to go? No, I think we must keep her, even if it
means giving him more money.’
Jia Rong knew perfectly well that although Xi-feng said this, she was secretly longing
to get rid of Er-jie and was merely anxious that if she did so it should be with her
reputation for womanly virtue untarnished. He deemed it safest not to dispute with
her, however, but merely to agree with everything she said.
‘This outside part of the business should not be too hard to settle,’ said Xi-feng. ‘In
the long run it’s here at home that we are going to have the difficulty. Hadn’t you
better come with me to explain all about this to Grandmother and Lady Wang?’
This threw You-shi into another panic. She seized Xi-feng by the hand and earnestly
entreated her to think of some lie which would obviate this necessity.
‘If you are not capable of dealing with the consequences, you ought not to do these
things in the first place,’ said Xi-feng coldly. ‘Really! It quite disgusts me to hear you
bleat like this! Oh well. I wasn’t going to help you out of this fix, but I am such a weak,
soft-hearted creature. I suppose I shall have to. You’d better stay out of this, then. I’ll
take your sister on my own to make her kotow to Grandmother and the ladies. I shall
say that this is your sister and that I have taken a great fancy to her. I shall tell them
that because I haven’t so far managed to give Lian a son, I had been thinking of
buying two girls to serve him as chamber-wives, but that since seeing your sister I
had thought how much nicer it would be to have her instead as his Number Two and
keep it all inside the family. Then I shall say that since her mother and sister died she
has been living in very reduced circumstances and would have found it impossible to
hold out on her own until the end of the hundred days mourning, so I have taken it
upon myself to invite her here to live with us. I shall tell them that I’ve already had a
room made ready for her and would like her to move in there as a temporary
measure until the mourning period is over and she is allowed to sleep with Lian. All
lies, of course, but I am sufficiently brazen to get away with them. Even if there is any
trouble, I promise that it shan’t come near you. Well, what about it? Do you think
that will do?’
You-shi and Jia Rong were all smiles.
‘Very handsome of you, and very resourceful, too. But then you always were both
of those things. When this affair is safely out of the way, we shall come round and
make you a kotow.’
‘Fiddlestick! I don’t want your kotows,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She pointed her finger at Jia
Rong. I know you now for what you are.’
Her face reddened as she said this, and for a moment she seemed on the point of
tears. Jia Rong put on his most winning smile.
‘Come on now, forgive and forget, won’t you, just this once?’
He knelt once more, but she turned her head away and ignored him. He got to his
feet again, still smiling.
You-shi made the servants bring a basin of water and a vanity-box, so that. Xi-feng
could wash her face and hands and comb her hair, and gave orders to hurry on the
dinner. Xi-feng insisted that she must go back, but You-shi was equally insistent that
she should stay and eat with them.
‘If you go off now like this, how shall we ever have the face to visit you at your
place in the future?’
Jia Rong added his own smiling persuasion.
‘Come on, Auntie! I promise that in future I shall serve you as a truly devoted
nephew, strike me dead if I don’t!’
Xi-feng gave him a look.
‘Pshaw! Who believes -?’
     But she did not finish.
The maids and old women had been busy meanwhile laying the table. You-shi made
a selection from the dishes with her own chopsticks to put on Xi-feng’s plate and Jia
Rong knelt down beside her and offered her a cupful of wine. When Xi-?feng and
You-shi had eaten, a maid served them with tea to rinse their mouths with and then
with a better tea to drink. After a couple of sips of the latter, Xi-feng rose to go. Jia
Rong saw her all the way back to her own place.
As soon as she was back, Xi-feng went into the Garden to tell Er-jie about these latest
developments. She told her how worried she had been when she heard about the
lawsuit, and what she had found out as a result of her inquiries. Then she explained
what had to be done now in order to ensure that none of the others got into trouble.
But if you want to know how Xi-feng’s plan turned out in the event, you will have to
read the following chapter.
CHAPTER 69

A scheming woman kills
with a borrowed knife
And one who has ceased to hope
swallows gold and dies



Er-jie was full of gratitude when she heard what Xi-feng was planning to do for her
and gladly accompanied her to the inner mansion. You-shi, feeling that - in spite of
what had been agreed - she could hardly stay away when her own step-sister was
being formally presented to the family, went along with them, on the express
understanding that she herself would say nothing and that, in the event of there
being any opposi?tion, Xi-feng would take sole responsibility.
When the three of them arrived in Grandmother Jia’s apartment, the old lady was
talking to Bao-yu and the girls - such conversations, enlivened by much joking and
laughter, being nowadays her principal source of amusement. Seeing Xi-feng come in
accompanied by a beautiful young woman, she screwed up her eyes and peered at
the latter with curiosity.
‘Well now, who is this charming young person?’
‘Have a good look, Grandma,’ said Xi-feng, taking Er-jie by the hand and drawing
her forwards. ‘Tell me what you think of her. - Quick, make your kotow!’ she
whispered to Er-jie. ‘This is Lian’s grandmother.’
When Er-jie had completed her obeisance, Xi-feng pointed to each of the cousins in
turn and told her their names.
‘You can make your curtseys to them later, after you have been to see Their
Ladyships,’ she said.
Er-lie had to greet each of the cousins by name, as if she were meeting them for the
first time. After that she stood, with head demurely lowered, to one side.
Having studied her face for some moments, Grandmother Jia raised her head to think,
but presently gave up with a laugh.
‘It’s no good,’ she said. ‘I can’t think who it is. But I’m sure I’ve seen her somewhere
else before.’
‘Never mind about that, Grandma,’ said Xi-feng laughing. ‘Just tell me what you
think of her. Is she prettier than me?’
Grandmother Jia put on a pair of spectacles.
‘Bring the child a little closer,’ she told Faithful and Amber. ‘Let me have a look at
her skin.’
Amid suppressed titters from the others present, Er-jie was hustled forward.
Grandmother Jia looked her up and down very carefully.
‘Hold her hand out,’ she said to Amber. ‘Let me look at her hand.’
When the hand had been inspected, Grandmother Jia took off her spectacles and
laughed.
‘Flawless. Yes, she’s prettier than you.’
Xi-feng laughed too, then, kneeling down, proceeded to repeat, more or less word for
word, what she had told You-shi she would say.
‘Will you be very kind and let her stay here, Grandma? She wouldn’t begin living
with Lian until next year, when she is out of mourning.’
‘Yes, that’s perfectly all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Very good of you to have
suggested it. I’m very glad. Provided, as you say, that she and Lian don’t start sleeping
together until next year.’
Xi-feng kotowed. Then she asked Grandmother Jia if she would mind deputing two of
her women to take Er-jie round to see Lady Xing and Lady Wang, and whether it
would be all right for them to say that Er-jie was being installed on Grandmother Jia’s
initiative. The old lady consented and Er-jie was led off to see the other ladies.
Xi-feng’s failure to take adequate steps for procuring her husband an heir had for
some time now been a source of anxiety to Lady Wang, for she knew that her niece’s
reputation must be suffering as a consequence. She was therefore delighted, when
Er-jie was presented to her as Jia Lian’s new concubine, to learn that it was Xi-feng
herself who was responsible for the arrangements. Now that Er-jie’s union with Jia
Lian had been brought into the open, it was possible to move her from the Garden
into the apartment in Xi-feng’s courtyard that had been prepared for her.
Meanwhile Xi-feng’s agents were secretly inciting Zhang Hua to claim his affianced
wife, promising that she would come to him with a generous trousseau and that they
would give him a substantial sum of money to set up house with. It was no easy task
persuading him, since from the very start he had had little stomach for this case. His
apprehensions seemed justified when, in answer to the summons, Jia Rong's
repre?sentative eventually appeared in court and made the following statement:
‘Zhang Hua had already broken off his engagement with the young lady before she
entered our house. She did so, in any case, merely as a kinswoman, already related to
the family by her sister’s marriage. There was never any talk of forcing her into
matrimony. Zhang Hua trumped up this case against my master because my master
was attempting to recover some money owing to him which Zhang Hua was unable
to pay.’
The Censor, whose past connections with both the Jia and Wang families, not to
mention the substantial bribe he had pocketed only the night before, inclined him to
accept this as a reliable version of the facts, ruled that Zhang Hua was a person of
untrustworthy character, driven by destitution to make a number of malicious and
defamatory accusations against the defendants, none of which could be
substantiated. The charges in the indictment were dismissed and Zhang Hua was
sentenced to be flogged and driven from the court. By distributing money in the right
quarters, Cheerful was able to ensure that the flogging administered was a light one
and got to work again on Zhang Hua as soon as it was over.
‘There’s no question you were betrothed to this girl. If you go back and tell them
that it’s the girl you want and nothing else, they’re sure to give judgement in your
favour.’
Zhang Hua was induced to do this and the court, after further persuasions from
Wang Xin, did in fact give judgement in his favour.
‘Zhang Hua is to repay the full amount owed by him to the Jia family within the
period specified. But provided that he does so, his affianced wife is to be restored to
him as soon as he is in a position to receive her.’
This judgement was confirmed in the presence of Zhang Hua’s father, who was
specially summoned to the Court of Censors to hear it. When Cheerful explained to
the old man that this meant that he and his son were to get not only the promised
money but also Er-jie and her trousseau as well, he was naturally delighted and at
once went along to the Jia mansion to claim the bride. Xi-feng went in feigned alarm
to report this latest development to Grandm6ther Jia.
‘It’s all the fault of Cousin Zhen’s wife,’ she said. ‘It seems that the Zhang family had
never agreed to break off this earlier engagement, and now they have sued us and
the court has given judgement against us.’
Grandmother Jia summoned You-shi from the other man?sion and rebuked her for
her carelessness.
‘It seems that your sister’s betrothal before she was born to this Zhang person was
never properly broken off, and now his family are suing us. I can’t imagine what you
thought you were at when you made this arrangement!’
‘But it was broken off,’ You-shi protested. ‘They even took our money.’
‘When Zhang Hua was giving evidence, he said he’d never seen any money,’ Xi-feng
chipped in. ‘He said no one had ever approached him about breaking off the
engagement. His father said your step-mother mentioned something about breaking
it off but there was nothing final. He said that when your step-mother died, you
moved your sister in regardless and married her to Lian as his Number Two. No one
present at the time was able to refute those statements, so they were able to get
away with them. It’s a good job Lian hasn’t slept with the girl yet. As far as that goes,
there is nothing to stop her going back to Zhang. The only thing is, it would be a
frightful loss of face for us to let her go again having once moved her in.’
‘Yes, but as you say, Lian hasn’t touched her yet,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It would be
even worse for our reputation to hold on to someone who by rights is somebody
else’s wife. Much better hand her over to him. We can easily find someone else for
Lian.’
‘The engagement really was broken off,’ said Er-jie, and named the date on which it
had occurred. ‘My mother gave the Zhangs twenty taels for doing it. It must be
because they are so hard up that they have brought this case against you. The things
they have been saying are quite untrue. My sister made no mistake.’
It only goes to show how dangerous people like this are to provoke,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘Well, in that case, Feng, you had better go and see what you can
do about it.’
Whatever reluctance she may have felt, Xi-feng was obliged to say that she would.
She had Jia Rong summoned to her room to talk to him about it. Jia Rong knew her
feelings well enough - but after all, how could a family like the Jias really contemplate
handing over one of their women to a beggar? The idea was preposterous. When he
reported the conversa?tion to his father, Cousin Zhen sent someone to have a word
privately with Zhang Hua.
‘Look here, you’ve had a lot of money out of them,’ the man said. ‘Why do you
have to have the woman as well? If you insist too hard, my master is likely to start
getting angry with you, and frankly I wouldn’t give much for your chances if he does.
Why don’t you and your father go back to where you came from? With the money
you’ve already got you’d have no difficulty in finding yourself a very nice little wife,
and if you decide to go away, I can promise you some more money towards your
travel expenses.’
This sounded to Zhang Hua like good advice, and after talking it over with his father,
he agreed that if the money he had already received were to be made up to a total of
one hundred taels, he and his father would undertake to make themselves scarce.
The money was handed over, and father and son rose at four o’clock next morning to
begin the journey back to their native village. As soon as he had made sure of their
departure, Jia Rong went round to tell Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng.
‘Zhang Hua and his father have run away. The charges in the indictment were all
fabricated and they lost their nerve because they thought they were going to be
found out. The court knows all the facts now but has decided not to prosecute. So
that is the end of the affair.’
Xi-feng was not as put out by this as might have been expected.
‘After all,’ she told herself, ‘even if I had insisted on Zhang Hua taking her away,
there was always the possibility that Lian might get back in time to reclaim her. He
would only have had to give Zhang a little money and Zhang would surely not have
refused to give her back. Perhaps it’s just as well that she’s staying here. I have her
here safely under my thumb while I think of some other way of dealing with her. But I
don’t like this idea of Zhang going off nobody knows where. Suppose he talks? Or
suppose one day he finds some means of reopening the case? Everything I have done
up to now will turn out to have been simply working towards my own downfall. Oh, I
should never have put a weapon like this into somebody else’s hand!’
She began to grow more and more worried and eventually thought of a plan. Calling
Brightie to her she told him to find out where Zhang Hua was and procure his death,
either by laying a false accusation of robbery against him and leaving it to the
magistrates and yamen runners to finish him off judicially, or else by employing an
assassin. Only by such root-and-branch methods, she felt, could her fears be allayed
and the threat to her reputation be removed.
Brightie went off agreeing to do what she had asked, but when he got home and had
time to think about it, he began to feel misgivings.
‘The fellow’s already gone away,’ he thought. ‘Surely that’s the end of the matter?
Why does she need to make such a great issue of it? Taking a man’s life is no
children’s game; it’s a serious business. I’ll just have to humour her for the time being
and think of some way out of this later.’
Having so resolved, he went into hiding for a few days before coming back and
reporting to Xi-feng.
‘Three days after Zhang Hua and his father ran away, somewhere near Jing-kou in
the early hours of the morning Zhang Hua was knocked down and killed by a
highwayman for the sake of the money he was carrying. The old man died of a
heart-attack shortly afterwards in a near-by inn. There was an inquest on the bodies
and both of them were buried there, where it happened.’
Xi-feng did not believe him.
‘I’ll probably be sending someone to make inquiries shortly,’ she said. ‘If I find out
that you’ve been lying, I’ll have every tooth in your head broken.’
But in the event she did nothing and let the matter drop.
From that time onwards her demeanour towards Er-jie was affable in the extreme.
No sister could have shown a greater interest in her well-being.
*
A day came when Jia Lian’s business was at last transacted and he was able to start
on his much-delayed journey back home. On his arrival in the city he called in first at
the new house in order to see Er-jie, but he found the place locked and empty with
only an aged caretaker in occupation. When, in answer to his questions, the old man
told him what had happened, he stamped in his stirrups with vexation; but there was
no time for indulging his feelings, for he had shortly to present himself before his
parents and report to them on the successful conclusion of his mission.
Jia She was for once very pleased with him and praised him for his capability. He gave
him a hundred taels as a reward and a seventeen-year-old girl from his own room
called Autumn as a concubine. Jia Lian kotowed to receive his presents. He felt
enormously pleased with himself; but there was a slightly hang-dog expression on his
face when, after he had seen Grandmother Jia and the rest, he appeared once more
before his wife.
To his surprise there were none of the expected recriminations. Xi-feng seemed,
indeed, to have become a different per?son. She came out to meet him with Er-jie at
her side, con?fined herself to questions about his health, his stay in Ping-an and the
journey back home, and made not a single reference to his deception. When the
time came for him to tell her about Autumn, he was unable to prevent a certain
pleased smugness from stealing over his face. At once Xi-feng ordered two of the
married servants to go round in a carriage to collect her. Here was another thorn in
her bosom, even before the first one had been extracted! Yet not a trace of what she
felt was allowed to show itself in her expression. With the same unchanging smile
she ordered a ‘welcome home’ dinner for her husband and took Autumn to make
her kotows to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang. Jia Lian privately marvelled at the
extra?ordinary change that had come over her.
It need hardly be said that Xi-feng harboured feelings about Er-jie very different from
the ones her outward show of friendliness might have suggested. Once or twice
when they were alone together she confided to her (in a sisterly manner, of course)
that her reputation in the family was a very unsavoury one.
‘There is a nasty little story going around, my dear, that you weren’t all you should
have been before you were married. They say you were much too thick with Cousin
Zhen. I’m afraid even Lady Jia and Lady Wang seem to have got hold of it. They are
beginning to ask me why I picked someone whom no one else would have, and why I
don’t put you away and choose somebody more suitable. Needless to say, when I
first heard this story I was flabbergasted. I’ve tried to find out who started it, but I’ve
had no success. Oh, these servants! Just as I thought I’d done something to feel
proud of, I find that I’ve got a fish’s head like this on my plate to contend with!’
Xi-feng’s sympathy for Er-jie was so great that, after telling her all this a couple of
times, her indignation against these anonymous traducers caused her to become
quite ill; she re?fused all food and drink and began to spend the greater part of her
time lying down in her room. The servants, with the sole exception of Patience,
speculated freely about the cause of their mistress’s illness, and Er-jie, though
seldom named, came in for frequent criticism.
Because Autumn had been presented to Jia Lian by his father, she had a very high
opinion of her own importance, showing scant respect for Patience or even for
Xi-feng, let alone for a poor, unwanted creature like Er-jie, who was commonly
known to have been a fallen woman before she married. When Xi-feng noticed this
she was secretly pleased.
Since Xi-feng’s pretended illness, she had ceased to eat with Er-jie, whose meals, on
Xi-feng’s instructions, were now served to her in her own room. Invariably the food
that was given her was inedible. Patience was so disgusted that she took to buying
her things to eat with her own money, or, on the pretext of going for a walk with her
in the Garden, taking her to the Garden kitchen where she could be given nourishing
soups to eat under her supervision. Because it was Patience who did this, none of the
other servants dared to inform against her. Unfortunately Autumn once came upon
them there and, feeling no such compunction, went straight off to denounce her to
Xi-feng.
‘Patience is going out of her way to give you a bad name, Mrs Lian. That Er woman
wastes the good food you give her and goes into the Garden with Patience every day
to sneak food from the kitchen.’
Xi-feng abused Patience angrily.
‘Most people keep a cat to keep down the mice for them. My cat seems to eat the
chickens!’
Patience dared not answer back, and from then on kept away from Er-jie; but she
secretly hated Autumn because of this.
Bao-yu and the girls were privately concerned about Er-jie. Though none of them
would venture to speak out openly on her behalf, they all of them felt sorry for her.
Sometimes, when no one else was about, one or other of them would get into
conversation with her. Invariably she would be crying and wiping her eyes all the time
they were talking to her; but she never uttered a word of complaint against Xi-feng -
indeed, since Xi-feng was careful never to reveal herself in her true colours, it is hard
to see what she could have complained of.
Jia Lian for his part failed to notice that anything was wrong. Since his return he had
been completely taken in by Xi-feng’s show of magnanimity towards her rival; and in
any case he was at present somewhat preoccupied. The sight of his father’s many
maids and concubines had often in the past aroused libidinous feelings in him which
he had perforce repressed; while on her side Autumn had often in the past, by
flutterings of the eyelids and various other signals, ex?pressed a marked interest in
her master’s handsome son. It may be imagined what sort of blaze was kindled in the
brush-wood when two such eager bedfellows were brought together with full
parental approval of their union. Day after day he spent in Autumn’s company –
aye sporting with his new-won bride
in the words of the poet. He seemed, indeed, scarcely able to prise himself away
from her. Gradually, as Autumn became more and more the only centre of his
concern, his former feelings towards Er-jie began to cool.
Xi-feng detested Autumn but was glad to have her as a means of ridding herself of
Er-jie. She would ‘kill with a borrowed knife’ - or rather she would watch the killing
from a safe distance, like a traveller reclining on a mountainside who watches two
tigers tearing each other to pieces in the valley below. And when Autumn had
disposed of Er-jie, Xi-?feng herself would take care of Autumn. Once she had settled
on this strategy, she lost no opportunity, whenever she found herself alone with
Autumn, of stirring her up against her rival.
‘You are so young and headstrong. You ought to be more careful,’ she told her. ‘She
is his second wife, after all. He is very, very fond of her. Even I have to give way to her
a bit. It’s suicide to go constantly provoking her in the way you do.’
This had the desired effect of releasing a stream of abuse against Er-jie, uttered in a
voice that could be heard from one end of the courtyard to the other.
‘You’re too soft with people, Mrs Lian. I wouldn’t behave so meekly if I was in your
place. Where’s all your old authority gone to? You can be forgiving if you like, but if
I’ve got a smut in my eye, I like to get it out. You just let me get at that whore, I’ll give
her a piece of my mind!’
Xi-feng pretended to be too scared of Autumn to rebuke her; but Er-jie, listening in
her room, spent the whole day crying and was too upset to eat. She did not dare to
tell Jia Lian what the matter was when he called in to see her, and next morning,
when Grandmother Jia noticed that her eyes were red and swollen with weeping and
asked her what the matter was, she would not say.
This was just the sort of opportunity that Autumn was waiting for. ‘She’s very good at
putting on this dying duck act,’ she confided to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang
when Er-jie had gone. ‘We get this from her all the time. It’s because she hates
sharing. She wishes that Mrs Lian and I were dead so that she could have Mr Lian all
to herself.’
‘It’s possible to be too attractive,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘They say that a jealous
nature often goes with it. How contemptible to be like that, though - especially when
Feng has gone out of her way to be nice to her! One can see that she has no
breeding.’
From that time onwards she appeared to have taken rather a dislike to Er-jie; and the
servants, when they sensed that Grandmother Jia did not like her, were only too
ready to press forwards and trample on her themselves. Now indeed life for the poor
young woman became a burden, only occasionally alleviated when Patience, acting
behind her mistress’s back and against her wishes, took up the cudgels on her behalf.
How could so gentle a soul, one of those whom Nature, in the words of the poet,
did out of snow and rose-petals compound,
stand up to the barbarities to which she was now daily subjected? After suffering in
silence for a month, she began to show the symptoms of an illness: there was a
weakness and lassitude in her limbs which made moving them an effort; she could
keep nothing down, either food or drink, and seemed to grow thinner and paler ail
the time; and she could not sleep at night. One night, when she was trying to get to
sleep, San-jie appeared to her, carrying the sword that she had cut her throat with.
‘Sister,’ she said, ‘you always were a silly, weak-willed creature. I knew you would
suffer for it in the end. Don’t trust the honied words of that jealous woman!
Outwardly she seems kind and virtuous, but she is treacherous and cunning
under?neath. She hates you and will never rest until she has brought about your
death. If I had been alive, I would never have allowed you to move inside here; or if I
had, I would never have allowed her to treat you like this. But I was fated to kill
myself and you were fated to suffer here alone. That is our punishment, because in
our past lives our wantonness led other folk astray. Sister, you must do as J tell you.
Take this sword, cut off that jealous woman’s head, and come with me to the tribunal
of Disenchantment to await her judgement. You will die in any case, but if you do not
do as I say, you will have died for nothing and no one will feel sorry for you.’
‘Sister,’ said Er-jie, weeping, ‘my whole life has been sinful. You yourself say that my
present sufferings are a punishment. Why should I add the crime of murder to my
other sins?’
San-jie left her sorrowfully, and Er-jie, waking up with a start, realized that she had
been dreaming.
     Next time Jia Lian came to see her she had a tearful disclosure to make.
     ‘This illness I am suffering from will not get better. It is half a year now since I
came to you and already I am with child. It might be the son you want, though of
course we cannot know that until it comes. If Heaven is merciful, I hope I may live
long enough to bear it; but I fear I may die before, and the child with me.’
     ‘You mustn’t worry,’ said Jia Lian, weeping himself. ‘I’ll get a first-rate doctor to
cure this illness.’
     He lost no time in sending for one. Unfortunately the Dr Wang of the Imperial
College who had attended Grandmother Jia and other members of the family in the
past was at present with the Imperial Army in the field (he had some hopes of a
baronetcy on his return) and the pages sent out to summon him ended up by calling
in a colleague of his called Hu Jun-rong - that same doctor, in fact, who had been
called in to attend Skybright a year or two previously. After taking Er-jie’s pulses he
informed Jia Lian that her trouble was ‘irregularity of the menses caused by
anaemia’.
     ‘But are you sure she isn’t pregnant?’ said Jia Lian. ‘It’s three months now since
she had a period, and she is suffering all the time from morning-sickness.’
     When he heard that, Hu Jun-rong asked the old women in attendance if he
might have Er-jie’s arm again. It was thrust out through the curtain and he spent a
long time feeling the pulses in it a second time.
     ‘It’s true that in a case of pregnancy the pulse from the liver would be a strong
one,’ he said finally. ‘On the other hand wood in the ascendant generates fire, which
can by itself cause the drying up of the menstrual fluid: so a strong liver pulse may be
indicative only of an irregularity in the menses and not of pregnancy. I wonder if I
might have a look at the lady's face? Before I finally decide on the right treatment, I
should like to see what sort of colour she has.’
The request was an unusual one, but Jia Lian felt he had no choice but to grant it. The
bed-curtains were drawn back a few inches and Er-jie thrust her head out through
the slit. The vision thus presented to him seemed to deprive the doctor temporarily
of his senses, so that it is doubtful whether he was able to make any observations of
diagnostic value while he was goggling at it. After a moment or two the curtains were
drawn to again and Jia Lian accompanied the doctor outside and once more asked
him for his opinion.
‘It isn’t pregnancy,’ said the doctor. ‘There is some clotted blood which is holding
back the natural discharge. The important thing is to disperse the clot and get her
men?struating again.’
He wrote a prescription out and took his leave. Jia Lian sent someone to pay him and
also to purchase the drugs named in his prescription. The medicine was made up,
infused and taken. From about midnight Er-jie began to suffer from con?tinuous
abdominal pain, and after what seemed hours of agony, produced a foetus already
sufficiently developed to be recognizable as a male child. This was followed by
continuous bleeding in the course of which she fainted away.
Jia Lian cursed Hu Jun-rong bitterly when they told him. He sent someone
immediately to call another doctor. He also sent someone to look for Hu Jun-rong;
but Hu Jun-rong, having got wind of what had happened, had already packed his bags
and disappeared.
The new doctor was not encouraging.
‘Obviously your lady’s constitution was not very robust to start with. It looks to me
as if in the course of her pregnancy she must have been subjected to some sort of
emotional dis?tress resulting in a congestion of the pneuma. By mistakenly attacking
this with a far too drastic dispersant, I am afraid the previous consultant has done a
lot of damage. The vital essence has been eighty or ninety per cent impaired. As
things look at present, I am afraid I really cannot guarantee a cure. I propose a
treatment using both liquid and solid medicines simultaneously. If you can make
quite sure that she neither sees nor hears anything likely to upset her during the
treat?ment, there might be some hope of improvement.’
Having given his diagnosis he departed, but not before writing out two prescriptions,
one for an infusion and one for some pills.
Jia Lian was beside himself. He insisted that the culprit responsible for calling in Hu
Jun-rong should be discovered, and had him beaten within an inch of his life. But Jia
Lian’s distress was as nothing compared with the transports of grief displayed by
Xi-feng.
‘It is beginning to look as if we are fated not to have a son,’ she lamented. ‘To think
that a doctor’s incompetence should ruin everything, just as we were so near to
having one!’
She had a little ‘altar to Heaven and Earth’ set up on which she burned incense and in
front of which she knelt down and prayed with the utmost fervency for Er-jie’s
recovery.
‘Let me be ill instead of her,’ she prayed. ‘Only let You-shi’s sister get well again and
bear us a man-child, and I vow to spend all my remaining days in prayer and fasting.’
Jia Lian and all the others who saw her and heard her pray were filled with
admiration.
While Jia Lian and Autumn were alone together, Xi-feng had all sorts of soups and
invalid slops made specially for Er-jie. She even sent the characters of Er-jie's nativity
to a fortune-teller to have her fortune told. The fortune-teller sent word back that
Er-jie’s stars were temporarily in collision with those of some other female born
under the sign of the Rabbit. A rapid investigation revealed that Autumn was the only
person in the household born under that sign. It was her astral influence that was
harming Er-jie.
The sight of Jia Lian rushing agitatedly about, calling for doctors, ordering medicines,
dispensing curses and floggings among the servants, and in general showing a most
singular devotedness to Er-jie, had already caused Autumn's system to secrete
several gallons of vinegar. Her jealous fury when she was informed that Er-jie’s illness
was due to her influence and when she was urged by Xi-feng to move elsewhere for a
few days in Er-jie’s interest can be imagined.
‘Who pays any attention to what those beggarly swindlers tell you?’ she said. ‘It’s
all rubbish anyway. How can I have any influence on her? I have nothing to do with
her.
The water in the well
And the water in the sea:
I’ve naught to do with you
Or you to do with me.
Precious little darling! She saw plenty of all sorts when she was living outside. She
didn’t suffer from any influences then, why should she start suffering from them now,
I wonder? Anyway, there’s something I’d like to ask her. I’d like to ask her where she
got that child from. She may fool that cotton?eared master of ours. As long as she
gave him a child, it would be all one to him whether it was a Zhang or a Wang. But do
you really care about that whore’s brat, Mrs Lian? I’m damned if I do! What’s so
special about having a baby? Give me a year or ten months and I’ll have one myself -
and it won’t have half the city for its father, either!’
The servants hearing her were at some pains not to laugh. It happened that Lady Xing
had come over that day to pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Autumn took the
opportunity of complaining to her.
‘Mr and Mrs Lian are trying to drive me out of here. I don’t know which way to turn.
Put in a good word for me, Your Ladyship, I beg of you!’
This led Lady Xing to give Xi-feng a severe telling-off, after which she proceeded to
give a piece of her mind to Jia Lian.
‘Ungrateful wretch! Whatever the girl’s like, she was given to you by Sir She. Fancy
trying to turn her out for the sake of an outsider! Have you no respect for your father
at all?’
She walked off in a huff, giving him no opportunity to explain. Autumn, now
thoroughly cock-a-hoop, stood outside Er-jie’s window and favoured the world at
large with an expanded and even more abusive version of what she had said earlier
to Xi-feng. Er-jie, lying inside, heard every word of it, as she was meant to, and was
deeply distressed.
That night, when Jia Lian and Autumn were in bed together and Xi-feng was asleep in
her own room, Patience went to see Er-jie and tried to comfort her.
‘You must try to get well,’ she said. ‘Don’t take any notice of that animal.’
Er-jie clutched her hand. She was crying weakly as she replied.
‘Sister, you have been so good to me, ever since I came to this place. I don’t know
how much unpleasantness you haven’t had to put up with on my account. If I come
out of this alive, I promise I shall do my best to repay your kindness. I fear I shan’t,
though. I shall have to try and repay you in another life.’
Patience could not help crying too.
‘All these things that have happened to you - it’s all my fault. I was so stupid. I
always told myself that I’d never deceive my mistress, and so when I heard about you
and Mr Lian living together outside, I thought I had to tell her. I never thought it
would all turn out like this.’
‘You’re wrong to blame yourself,’ said Er-jie. ‘She would have found out sooner or
later, even if you hadn’t told her. It was only a question of time. And anyway, I wanted
to come here. I wanted so much to be respectable. It really had nothing to do with
you.’
The two young women wept a while in silence. Once more Patience tried to comfort
her and urged her to get better; then, because it was long past midnight, she left her
to go and get some sleep.
After Patience had gone, Er-jie lay thinking.
‘This illness seems to have got its grip on me. I’m losing rather than gaining all the
time. It doesn’t look as if I shall ever get better. And now that I’ve lost the baby,
there’s nothing much left for me to live for. I don’t have to put up with all this hatred
and malice. Why don’t I just die and get it over with? They say you can die by
swallowing gold. It would be a better way of dying than hanging oneself or cutting
one’s throat.’
She struggled out of bed, opened one of her boxes, and hunted out a nugget of raw
gold. Then she wept a little. It was four o’clock in the morning. Summoning up all the
will-power she could muster, she forced herself to swallow it. She had to hold her
head back and swallow many times before it would go down; but in the end it did.
Then she dressed herself hurriedly in her best clothes, put on her jewellery and
ornaments, laid herself down upon the kang, and sank at once into unconsciousness.
Hearing no call from her next morning, the maids - Xi-feng and Autumn having gone
off to Grandmother Jia’s place for their morning duty - were only too pleased to get
on with their toilets undisturbed. Patience was disgusted by their callousness and
reproached them bitterly.
‘What you girls need is a really hard-hearted mistress - one who would curse you
and beat you every day. There’s a sick woman in there: can’t you feel any sympathy
for her at all? Even though she’s so easily put upon, I’m surprised you don’t show her
a little consideration, if only for appearance’s sake. “Everyone helps to push over a
falling wall” they say; but don’t you think you carry it a bit too far?’
Shamed by her reproaches, the maids pushed open Er-jie’s door and went inside to
look. They found her dressed up in all her finery and stretched out dead upon the
kang. Their frightened screams brought Patience running in as well. She could not
help weeping out loud when she saw the cause. The other servants, too, when they
remembered how sweet and gentle Er-jie had been and how unfailingly kind to her
inferiors, were moved to tears by her death, but they were all so scared of Xi-feng
that they dared not let her see their tears.
Soon everyone in the household had heard the news. When Jia Lian arrived he clung
to the corpse and wept uncontrollably. Xi-feng made a show of weeping too and
hypo?critically reproached Er-jie for her ‘cruelty’.
‘Hard-hearted sister!’ she wailed. ‘How could you bear to leave me like this when
you knew how much I cared for you?’
You-shi and Jia Rong also came and wept a while, after which they urged Jia Lian to
cease his lamentations and begin to perform his duties. The first of these was to
report Er-jie’s death formally to Lady Wang and ask if he might lay out the body in
Pear-tree Court for five days and after that move it to the Temple of the Iron
Threshold. Lady Wang gave her permission, whereupon he at once sent servants to
open up Pear-tree Court and make the principal room in it ready to receive the
corpse.
Jia Lian did not like the idea of Er-jie’s leaving the mansion for the last time by way of
the rear gate and into the back streets beyond. He therefore opened up the gate in
the outer wall of Pear-tree Court giving on to the passage-way between the two
mansions which led into Two Dukes Street. Awnings were put up on either side of
this gate to accommodate sūtra-chanting monks.
A beautifully-embroidered satin pall was draped over a camp-bed and Er-jie’s body
laid on it and covered over with a sheet. On this it was carried by eight pages,
followed by a number of married womenservants, along the foot of the inside walls
and all the way to the room in Pear-tree Court which had been made ready for it. The
official geomancer had been summoned and was waiting there in readiness. He lifted
the coverlet back to look at Er-jie’s face. She looked almost alive - if anything even
more beautiful than in life. The sight provoked a fresh outburst of grief from Jia Lian.
Once more he clung to her and wept.
‘My poor wife!’ he sobbed. ‘You should never have died. I blame myself for
allowing this to happen.’
Jia Rong nervously urged restraint.
‘There, there, Uncle! Take it easy! She was unlucky, poor Auntie. That’s all you can
say about it.’
He pointed in the direction of the wall separating Pear-tree Court from the mansion.
Jia Lian, understanding his meaning, lowered his voice, though he continued to
reproach himself.
     ‘I was too careless. I should have noticed what was going on.’ He addressed
himself to the dead woman. ‘One of these days I shall get to the bottom of this and
you shall be revenged.’
At last the coverlet was replaced and the geomancer made his pronouncement.
‘I am assuming that she died at the end of the fifth watch. In that case you won’t
be able to take her out of here on the fifth day, I’m afraid. It will have to be either the
third or the seventh. For the encoffining, the best time would be four o’clock
tomorrow morning.’
‘The third day is much too soon,’ said Jia Lian. ‘It will have to be the seventh. I
couldn’t keep her here much longer than that, because my uncle and my cousin are
both away and I should need to have their permission; but I am planning to do much
more for her when we get her to the temple outside. I’d like to keep her there for the
full thirty-five days and give her a really decent funeral with a requiem and so forth at
the end of it. We can take her south to Nanking and bury her in the family graveyard
next year.’
      The geomancer agreed to all this, wrote out the burial licence, and took his
leave.
Various male kinsmen - Bao-yu was the first - came over to help Jia Lian mourn.
When they had gone, he went back to his own apartment to look for Xi-feng and ask
her for some money to buy timber for a coffin with and pay for the funeral.
Now Xi-feng had used her illness as a pretext for not accompanying the others to
Pear-tree Court. She claimed that she had received strict instructions from
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang that until she had fully recovered she was to avoid
all places connected in any way with birth, sickness or death. She refused to go into
mourning for the same reason. The ban did not however prevent her from slipping
out into the Garden when everyone else had gone, making her way round it between
the rocks and the perimeter wall to the foot of the wall that separated it from
Pear-tree Court, and eavesdropping on what was going on inside. She could not hear
very much, but enough to send her scurrying back to Grandmother Jia to report on
what Jia Lian was up to. Grandmother Jia was indignant.
‘I never heard such nonsense! When a consumptive child dies, one just burns it and
scatters the ashes. Burying her in Nanking indeed! What can the man be thinking of?
If he feels he has to do something special for her because she was his wife, let him
observe the Thirty-Five Days. But after that he should either have her carried out and
burned or else buried in the common graveyard. Nanking, indeed!’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘That’s what I thought, but it wasn’t for me to say.’
Just then a maid arrived from Jia Lian, looking for her.
‘Mr Lian’s back, madam. He’s waiting for you to give him some money.’
Xi-feng went back to see him.
‘What’s this about wanting money?’ she asked him. ‘Don’t you know how difficult
things are lately? Every month now our allowance falls short of our expenditure. I
managed to raise three hundred taels yesterday to pay some of the bills with by
pawning two of my gold necklaces. There’s still twenty or thirty taels of that left that
you can have if you like.’
She told Patience to get it out and give it to him; then, muttering something about
Grandmother Jia having something more to say, she went away again, leaving Jia Lian
speechless with resentment. He was obliged to go through Er-jie’s drawers and
cupboards looking for the savings he had entrusted to her. But someone seemed to
have been through them before him, for all he could find were a few bits of broken
jewellery and a few far from new silk dresses. The sight of these clothes which she
had worn brought on another outburst of anguished weeping. He felt sure there was
something suspicious about her death but dared not utter what he thought. He made
the things up into a bundle and was appar?ently intending to take them outside and
sell them, for he had called no servant, and when Patience saw him was carrying the
bundle himself. She found the sight of him carrying it both pathetic but also a trifle
ludicrous. Hurriedly abstracting a packet containing two hundred taels of
miscellaneous bits and pieces of silver from one of Xi-feng’s chests, she drew him
into one of the side rooms where no one could see them and gave it to him.
‘Psst! Not a word! And by the way, if you want to cry, you can cry as much as you
like outside, but for goodness’ sake don’t make an exhibition of yourself here, where
everyone can see you!’
‘You are right,’ said Jia Lian, taking the money. He handed her a skirt out of the
bundle. ‘Here, take this. It’s something she often used to wear. Keep it to remember
her by.’
As he was insistent, she took it from him and put it away with her things.
Now that Jia Lian had some money, he sent someone to buy timber for the coffin.
Unfortunately the best planks turned out to be too expensive and the more modestly
priced ones did not meet with his approval. In the end he got on his horse and
insisted on going to see for himself. The outcome was that a set of planks costing five
hundred taels and obtained by him on credit were delivered from the
timber-merchant’s that evening. The carpenters were set to work on them
immediately and ordered to go on working through the night so that the coffin
should be ready in time.
He ordered some of the servants to dress in mourning and keep vigil at Er-jie’s side.
He himself did not return to his own apartment that evening, but spent that and
every other night of the seven at Pear-tree Court. Towards the end of this sojourn he
was somewhat surprised to receive a summons from Grandmother Jia.
The reason for the summons will be revealed in the chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 70

Lin Dai-yu resuscitates
the Poetry Club
And Shi Xiang-yun tries her hand
at a song lyric
Each of the seven nights following Er-jie’s death were spent by Jia Lian on his own in
Pear-tree Court. Throughout the whole of the seven-day period he had Buddhist
monks and Taoist priests chanting arid praying outside for her soul’s repose.
At the conclusion of the last chapter we mentioned the unexpected summons which
he received towards the end of this period from Grandmother Jia. It turned out to be
for the sole purpose of refusing him permission to convey Er-jie’s body to the family
temple outside the city. This was a heavy blow, but one to which he could not but
submit. He had to talk to the proprietor of the ground in which San-jie was buried
and have another grave opened for Er-jie above her sister’s. Apart from a few Jia
males and You-shi and her daughter-in-law, the only other mourners on the day they
buried her were Xi-feng’s kinsman Wang Xin and his wife. Xi-feng herself would have
nothing to do with the funeral and left Jia Lian to manage everything by himself.
The New Year was now approaching. Among the multitudinous duties that had now
to be attended to was the necessity of finding suitable wives from among the
maidservants for those of the menservants who had reached the marriageable age of
twenty-five. Xi-feng consulted Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang on this subject and a
lengthy discussion of it ensued. Several maids were of an age to marry, but for one
reason or another had to be exempted. The first of these was Faithful, who had taken
a vow to remain single all her life. Ever since the day on which she took this vow she
had refused even to speak to Bao-yu and had taken to using make-up only sparingly,
dispensing altogether with jewellery, and wearing only the very soberest clothes. The
others respected her determination and did not press her to abandon it. Amber had
to be exempted because she was ill. Sunset, too, since her break-up with Jia Huan,
had developed an illness that seemed incurable and had to be exempted for the
same reason. There remained only a few of the older maids-of-all-work from
Xi?feng’s and Li Wan’s apartments. The other maids were all too young. It was
decided to allow the young menservants to seek their brides outside.
*
Xi-feng’s illness, necessitating their standing in for her as household managers, had
for many months deprived Li Wan and Tan-chun of their leisure. That, and the
multifarious duties attendant on the New Year festival, had resulted in the indefinite
postponement of the Poetry Club. Now spring had come and at last there was time
for a meeting. But now it was Bao-yu’s condition that prevented them. Liu
Xiang-lian’s conversion and subsequent disappearance, San-jie’s suicide, Er-jie’s
hounding to death by Xi-feng, the grave deterioration in Fivey’s health caused by the
hardships of her night’s imprisonment - all these shocks and distresses following hard
upon one another had eventually reduced him to a state of mental collapse. He was
beginning to look and act like a half-wit and his speech was frequently disordered
and nonsensical. Aroma and the other maids were frightened out of their wits. They
dared not tell Grandmother Jia about it; instead they did what they could to distract
him by amusing him and making him laugh.
Early one morning he woke up to the sound of laughter, peals upon peals of it from
the neighbouring room. Aroma smiled at him when she saw that he was awake.
‘It’s Aventurin,’ she said, giving Parfumee the name that Bao-yu had insisted on.
‘You’d better go and rescue her. She’s got Skybright and Musk holding her down and
tickling her.’
Bao-yu slipped on his squirrel-lined gown and went into the outer room to look. The
three girls were on the kang, their bedding still not folded and none of them yet
dressed. Skybright, wearing only a tunic of leek-green Hangchow silk and a pair of red
silk drawers and with her hair hanging loose over her shoulders, knelt above
Parfumee’s body, straddling her as if riding a horse; Musk, wearing little but a red
breast-binder and an old gown that she had wrapped round herself like a cloak, was
tickling Parfumee under the armpits; Parfumee herself, in flower-patterned shirt, red
trousers and green stockings, lay on her back drumming her heels on the kang and
laughing so much that she seemed in some danger of asphyxiation.
‘Two big ones against one little one,’ said Bao-yu, laughing. ‘I shall have to see
about that!’
He got on the kang and began tickling Skybright. Skybright, being very ticklish, at
once began shrieking and let go of Parfumee in order to tickle him back, which gave
Parfumee the opportunity of getting on top of her and holding her down. Aroma
stood watching these antics with amusement.
‘Why don’t you get dressed, all of you?’ she said. ‘It won’t be so funny if you catch
cold.’
At that moment Casta came in.
‘Mrs Zhu thinks she left a handkerchief here last night. Have any of you seen it,
please?’
‘Yes,’ said Swallow. ‘I picked it up off the floor, but I didn’t know whose it was. I’ve
only just washed it and hung it out to dry. I’m afraid it won’t be dry yet.’
     Casta was greatly amused by the four figures struggling on the kang.
‘You’re certainly a lively lot here, larking about like this so early in the morning!’
     Bao-yu disengaged himself to talk.
     ‘Don’t you lot ever play, then? There are enough of you.’
     ‘Mrs Zhu isn’t much of a one for playing,’ said Casta, ‘and she keeps a pretty
tight rein on the others - Miss Qin and the two Miss Lis. It’s very quiet there now that
Miss Qin is sleeping over at Her Old Ladyship’s again. It will be quieter still next
winter when the two Miss Lis go back to their own home. Look how quiet it’s
become at Miss Bao’s place since Caltrop went back to Mr Pan. It’s as though several
people had left. Poor Miss Shi is quite lost without her!’
By coincidence it was Xiang-yun’s maid Kingfisher who walked in just at that moment.
She had a message for Bao-yu.
‘Miss Shi says come quickly, Master Bao. They’ve got a very good poem for you to
look at.’
‘Who have?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What sort of poem?’
‘The young ladies. They’re all together in the Drenched Blossoms Pavilion. You’ll
see when you get there.’
Bao-yu rushed through his toilet and hurried outside to join them. He found Dai-yu,
Bao-chai, Xiang-yun, Bao-qin and Tan-chun clustered round the sheet of paper on
which the poem was written.
‘Have you only just got up?’ the girls jeered when they saw him coming. ‘We’ve all
been up for hours!’
‘It’s more than a year now since our Poetry Club met,’ said one of them, ‘yet in all
that time no one seems to have felt the urge to get it going again. Springtime, when
everything in nature is renewing itself, seems an appropriate time for reestablishing
it.’
‘Yes,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘We founded it in the autumn, which is a time of decay.
Perhaps that’s why it didn’t thrive. If we reestablish it now, when everything is
burgeoning, it is bound to flourish! And this “Flower of the Peach” is such a splendid
poem: I think we ought to rename our club “The Peach-flower Club”. What do the
rest of you think?’
‘I think it’s an excellent idea,’ said Bao-yu. ‘May I see the poem?’
‘Let’s all go and see Farmer Sweetrice and discuss this business of reviving the
Poetry Club with her,’ said the others.
They got up in a body and began to go, Bao-yu reading the poem as he went.
The Flower of the Peach
Peach pink the tender flowers outside the window blow;
Peach pink on sleepy face the morning colours glow.
Tree-flowers outside the room and lady-flower inside:
Only a few short steps the flowery forms divide.
Slyly the conspiring wind tugs at the blind below:
Tree-flowers would peep inside if they could do so.
*
Outside the window tree-flowers are blooming still;
Inside the window lady-flower looks ill.
If the flowers could understand, surely they would grieve?
The anxious wind flaps the blind against the window-sill.
*
                   The anxious wind flaps the blind; spring crowns the courtyard trees;
Spring sights fill the lady’s eyes, but bring her heart no ease.
In her closed, untrodden court the moss grows green on the stones:
She leans there at the sunset hour, in the soft evening breeze.
*
In the soft breeze the lady’s face is wet with many a tear.
Her silken peach-skirt billows out, the peach-trees to be near.
The peach-flowers and the peach-leaves nod in a rich array:
The leaves, against the peach-pink, dark emerald appear.
A thousand trees, ten thousand trees, crowding close together,
Walls and buildings everywhere in a red mist smother.
*
Heaven’s new bed-spread is burning on the dawn loom of the skies:
It’s time now for sleeping lady-flower from dreams of spring to rise.
Her maid comes in with a golden bowl as she leaves her coral bed,
And the peach-pink stain from her sleepy face the chilly water dyes.

*
If with the water’s rosy hue comparison be made,
Carmine tears and dewy flowers seem of the self-same shade.
Yet lady’s tears and flowers in this unalike I find,
That the flowers are still and smiling, but the tears flow unallayed.
As she gazes on the smiling flowers, her tears at last grow dry;
But as they dry, the springtime ends and the flowers fade.
*
The flowers fade, and an equal blight the lady’s fair cheek palls.
The petals drift; she is weary; and soon the darkness falls.
A nightingale is singing a dirge for the death of spring,
And moonlight steals through the casement and dapples the silent walls.
Bao-yu uttered no word of praise when he had finished reading it, he simply went on
staring stupidly at the paper, He wanted to cry, but was ashamed that the girls should
see his tears and brushed them away with a hurried movement of his hand.
‘How did you get hold of this poem?’ he asked them.
‘First guess who wrote it,’ said Bao-qin mischievously.
‘River Queen,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who else?’
‘Really?’ said Bao-qin. ‘Well, as a matter of fact, I did.’
‘I don’t believe you,’ said Bao-yu, smiling back at her. ‘The tone of voice is entirely
different from yours.’
‘That just shows how little you know about poetry,’ said Bao-qin. ‘Not all of Du Fu’s
poems have the complexity of “Autumn Thoughts”. He is equally capable of lines like
Rain-fattened plum-buds crimson splashed,
Or
The wind’s green duckweed-trails on the water bright.’
‘That’s as may be,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I don’t believe Cousin Chai would allow you to
write such melancholy verses. And in any case, though I am sure you have the talent
to write verses like this if you wanted to, I don’t believe you would want to. Cousin
Lin writes like this because she has had actual ex?perience of grief.’
The girls all laughed.
They had now reached Sweet-rice Village. Li Wan was shown the poem and - it goes
without saying - was full of praise. After some discussion it was decided unanimously
that the first meeting of the revived Poetry Club should be held the very next day,
which as it happened, would be the second of the third month. The club was to be
renamed ‘The Peach-flower Club’ and Dai-yu was to be its presi?dent.
Next day, as soon as lunch was over, everyone met in the Naiad’s House and began
discussing the question of a subject. Dai-yu proposed that each of them should
compose a hundred couplets on ‘Peach-blossom’.
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Even if we succeeded in writing so many, there
have been such a lot of poems written on this subject in the past that we should be
sure to find ourselves repeating what has been said before; and we couldn’t in any
case do anything to equal your “Flower of the Peach”. Think of something else.’
But just at that moment a servant came in from outside and summoned them away.
‘The elder Lady Wang is here. Will you all come over to pay her your respects,
please.’
So off they trooped to talk to Wang Zi-teng’s wife. They had to stay and have dinner
with her and after that show her over the garden. It was lighting-up time before she
went.
Next day was Tan-chun’s birthday. Yuan-chun had sent two little eunuchs well in
advance of the date with her presents (various ornaments for Tan-chun’s room).
There were presents from all the other members of the family as well, of course, but
we will spare the reader a list. After lunch Tan-chun had to change into her most
formal clothes and go around all the apartments making her kotows.
‘My poetry dub seems to have got off to rather a bad start,’ said Dai-yu ruefully. ‘I’d
forgotten about her birthday. Today and tomorrow will be completely taken up with
it. Even though there will be no formal birthday with players and so forth, we are
sure to have to spend all day in the front with Grandmother and Aunt Wang. There’s
sure not to be any time left for a meeting.’
She postponed the meeting until the fifth.
On the morning of the fifth, after lunch, while the girls stood talking with
Grandmother Jia, letters from Jia Zheng arrived. Bao-yu brought them with him when
he came to make his regular morning call. He opened the one addressed to his
grandmother and read it out to her. Most of it was taken up with greetings and
inquiries about her health, but there was also something about returning to the
capital some time in the sixth month. There were other letters in the same packet
dealing with personal or domestic matters which were opened and read by Jia Lian
and Lady Wang. Everyone was of course delighted to hear that he was coming back
so soon.
But once again the Poetry Club was fated to be unlucky. Not long before this date the
betrothal had been announced of Wang Zi-teng’s daughter to the Marquis of
Bao-ning’s son (the wedding to be in the fifth month) and Xi-feng had lately taken to
spending three or four days in a row at the Wang residence, helping her aunt with
the entertaining occasioned by this important event. As ill luck would have it, when
Wang Zi-teng’s lady called to collect Xi-feng on the fifth, she insisted that all her
other nephews and nieces should come too and spend the day ‘enjoying themselves’
at her place. Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang decreed that Bao-yu, Tan-chun, Dai-yu
and Bao-chai should go as a representative selection. It was out of the question to
object that they had better things to do; the four of them had to go back to their own
rooms and change into their most formal clothes before accompanying Wang Xi-feng
and their aunt to the Wang family residence. It was lighting-up time before they
returned.
As soon as he got back to Green Delights, Bao-yu threw himself down to rest. Aroma
seized the opportunity to offer him a little serious advice. He really must try and pull
himself together, she said, and apply himself whenever possible to his books, so as to
be ready for his father’s return. Bao-yu did some rapid calculations on his fingers.
‘It’s a bit early for that yet,’ he said.
‘It isn’t only the books,’ said Aroma. ‘Your calligraphy is even more important. Even
if you can get by on the books, what are you going to show him when he asks to see
your calligraphy?’
Bao-yu smiled unconcernedly.
‘I’m always doing calligraphy. There must be masses of it. Surely you keep it for me,
don’t you?’
‘Certainly we keep it for you,’ said Aroma. ‘I got it out to have a look at only
yesterday, while you were away. Five hundred and sixty sheets: for all the years since
you first started, that’s all you’ve got to show. If you ask me, I think that from
tomorrow onwards you ought to concentrate all your energies on copying. If you
could copy two or three sheets of calligraphy a day, then by the time he gets back,
even though you won’t be able to show him a sheet for every day, you should have
enough to get by with.’
Bao-yu heard her with some alarm. He had a look at the collected sheets himself. It
was true. There simply wasn’t enough there to convince anyone that he had been
practising calligraphy every day.
‘All right,’ he said. ‘Beginning from tomorrow, I’ll write a hundred characters every
morning.’
He was still discussing this when they went to bed.
Next morning, as soon as he had washed and combed his hair, he sat down at the
window and began painstakingly copying kai-shu, characters out of a sample-book.
Grandmother Jia thought he must be ill when he did not appear with the others for
his duty-call, and sent someone over to inquire. Bao-yu returned with the messenger
to wish her good morning and explain.
‘I’ve been practising calligraphy,’ he told her. ‘That’s what’s made me late.’
Grandmother Jia was delighted.
‘Keep it up, my boy! When you are studying or practising your calligraphy, it doesn’t
matter if you don’t come here at all. You may tell your mother I said so.’
Bao-yu went round to Lady Wang’s apartment to do so. His mother was
unimpressed.
‘It’s too late to begin sharpening your weapons on the field of battle,’ she said.
‘Getting in a panic now will do you no good. Even if you work all day and all night,
you won’t be able to make up for all the time you have wasted. More likely all you
will succeed in doing is making yourself ill.’
‘I’ll be all right,’ said Bao-yu.
Bao-chai and Tan-chun, who happened to be present, reassured her.
‘We can’t memorize his texts for him,’ they said, ‘but we could at least help him out
with his calligraphy. If each of us copied a sheet of characters for him every day to
add to what he has done himself, he ought to have enough calligraphy to get by with.
That’s one hurdle at least he’d be over. It would save Sir Zheng from getting angry
and Bao-yu from making himself ill.’
Lady Wang smiled and nodded.
When Dai-yu heard that Jia Zheng was coming home, she knew that he would be
sure to ask Bao-yu about his lessons and that anything which distracted him from
them would be merely adding to his troubles. Because of this she deliberately made
no more mention of the Poetry Club, and in order that he should not suspect her real
reason for dropping it, pretended that she was beginning to find the whole thing
rather a bore.
Tan-chun and Bao-chai each produced a sheet of characters a day to add to his
collection, and Bao-yu himself, by doubling the time he spent on calligraphy,
managed to produce two hundred or sometimes as much as three hundred
characters a day. By the end of the third month he had already added considerably to
his stock of sheets.
One day towards the end of the month he was going over this stock and had just
estimated that fifty or sixty more sheets would probably be enough, when
Nightingale arrived with a roll of something from Dai-yu. On opening it out he found
it to consist of several sheets, all of the same dark-yellow bamboo paper, covered
with tiny ‘fly’s-head’ kai-shu characters which she had copied, in a hand very similar
to his own, from sample-books of Zhong Yu’s and Wang Xi-zhi’s calligraphy. Bao-ya
was so pleased that he clasped his hands and made Nightingale a bow before
hurrying over to thank her mistress in person.
Shortly after that he received some more sheets of calligraphy that Xiang-yun and
Bao-qin had been copying for him. Now, when he put the whole lot together, he
found that, though there was nothing like a sheet a day for every day since he first
started, there was already a sufficient quantity to get by with. This was a great relief.
He could now forget about calligraphy for the time being and concentrate on revision.
His aim was to go three or four times over each of the texts.
While he was still busily engaged in this revision, a tidal wave hit a certain part of the
coast, causing damage and loss of life in a number of neighbouring communities.
After reading the reports sent in by the local authorities, the Emperor issued a
Rescript commanding Jia Zheng to visit the area on his way back in order to supervise
relief. It now seemed unlikely that he would be able to reach home before the end of
the seventh month. When he heard this, Bao-yu threw aside his books and reverted
to the drifting, aimless way of life that was customary with him.
Spring was now almost over. Xiang-yun, feeling rather bored, had been watching the
drifting willow-floss and amusing herself by composing a little poem about it. It was a
song-lyric, in the form of a Ru-meng-ling:
‘Not chewed-off ends of the sky’s embroidery?
‘What are they?’ - ‘Raise the blind a bit and see.’
A white hand snatches some and draws it in,
Pursued by the swallows’ chiding din.
Oh stay, oh stay!
The lovely spring drifts after you away.
Xiang-yun was rather pleased with her little poem and wrote it out on a slip of paper
to show Bao-chai. After that she went to look for Dai-yu and showed it to her. Dai-yu
read it and smiled.
‘It’s good. Both charming and original.’
‘We’ve never done song-lyrics at any of our poetry meetings,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why
don’t you call a meeting for to?morrow and we’ll all do some? It would make a nice
change.’
Dai-yu was becoming infected by Xiang-yun’s enthusiasm.
‘It’s a good idea,’ she said. ‘I will.’
‘It’s a lovely day today,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why not have the meeting today?’
‘I don’t see why not,’ said Dai-yu.
She told the servants to prepare some suitably dainty things to eat, while a couple of
them went off to summon the other cousins to the meeting. Meanwhile Dai-yu and
Xiang-yun agreed that ‘Willow Floss’ should be the subject of the poems and decided
on the stanza-patterns that they should conform to. All this was written down on a
sheet of paper which was pasted up on the wall. When the cousins arrived, they first
of all read the notice on the wall and then read Xiang-yun’s poem. Some little time
after that was devoted to praising it.
‘I’m not much good at song-lyrics,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I suppose I had better do what
I can.’
Everyone drew lots then to see which stanza-forms they were to use. Bao-chai lit a
stick of Sweet Dreams incense, and then everyone settled down to think. Dai-yu was
the first to have something ready and write it down. Just as she had finished, Bao-qin
began hurriedly writing hers.
‘I’ve thought of mine,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I’d like to look at yours first before I show
it to you.’
Tan-chun laughed.
‘Why does the incense seem to be burning so quickly today? I’ve only done the first
half of mine.’ She turned to Bao-?yu. ‘How about you? Have you done yours yet?’
Bao-yu had in fact written a few lines of one, but, feeling dissatisfied with what he
had written, had crossed it all out and begun again, by which time the incense had
almost burned itself out.
‘Bao-yu’s failed to make the grade as usual,’ said Li Wan, laughing. ‘But what about
Miss Plantain?’
Tan-chun promptly began to write down what she had composed. The others read
the words as she wrote them. It was the first half of a Nan-ge-zi lyric.
Once in the air you start,
    The creatures of the wind, the breezes’ sport,
Not to be bound or held back by any art,
To north and south and east and west
You drift apart.
‘Very good,’ said Li Wan. ‘But why don’t you finish it?’
Bao-yu had been willing to concede defeat. When he saw that the incense was
running out, he could see no point in writing an indifferent conclusion just for the
sake of finishing, and so he had laid down his brush and occupied himself instead in
reading what Tan-chun had written. As he did so, he had a sudden inspiration, and
picking up his brush again, quickly scribbled out a second half for it:
Your drifting fate not fear:
I understand the message that you bear.
    Though orioles mourn and the flowers’ end seems near,
Spring will return, but I must wait
Another year.
The girls were amused.
‘You’re a funny fellow. You can’t do your own, yet you can do someone else’s
without any trouble. It’s very good, but unfortunately it doesn’t count.’
They had a look at Dai-yu’s poem then. It was a Tang-duo-ling.
The pollen is spent in the Island of Flowers;
   From the House of the Swallow the perfume has fled.
    The fluff-balls dance,
Pursue, embrace,
Their floating lives, as our lives, quickly sped’
     That, craving Beauty,
Find it dead.

  The creatures of nature, they too know our sorrow,
Their beauty, like ours, must soon end in decay.
  Our fate, like theirs,
Uncertain hangs,
Wed to the wind, our bridegroom of a day,
  Who cares not if we
Go or stay.
The others admired it, but with reservation.
‘Pity it’s so gloomy,’ they said. ‘Still, there’s no denying, it is very good.’
Then they had a look at Bao-qin’s. She had written a Xi-jiang-yue:
In the Han palace gardens a scatter thin and slight,
But along the Sui embankment in legions falling:
Spring’s three-month handiwork before the wind in flight,
A day-dream of pear-blossom on a moonlit night.

In many a courtyard petals fall through the air,
 And the floss collects like fragrant snow on the casements:
 In North and South the same sight is seen now everywhere;
But for the sad exile most hard to bear.
‘A more virile type of melancholy,’ said the others, laughing. ‘Very typical! That “In
many a courtyard...” couplet is good.’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I think it suffers from the same pessimism as Cousin
Dai’s. Willow floss is a light and airy thing. It seems to me that the best way to avoid
the cliches that this subject invites is to give it a light and airy treatment. That is the
principle on which I have tried to compose my poem; but you may not think I have
succeeded.’
‘Don’t be so modest!’ said the others. ‘It’s sure to be good. Come on, hand it over!
Permit us to admire!’
It was a Lin-jiang-xian that she had written.
In mazy dances over the marble forecourt,
   Wind-whorled, into trim fluff-balls forming –
‘Bravo!’ said Xiang-yun. “‘Wind-whorled, into trim fluff-balls forming”: that line is
better than anything the rest of us have written.’
They read on.
Like fluttering moths or silent white bees swarming:
Not for us a tomb in the running waters,
Or the earth’s embalming.

      The filaments whence we are formed remain unchanging,
No matter what separates or unifies.
Do not, earth-child, our rootlessness despise:
   When the strong wind comes he will whirl us upwards
Into the skies.
They thumped the table enthusiastically.
      ‘Undoubtedly this poem is the best. There is a more haunting melancholy
perhaps in River Queen’s poem and more liveliness and charm in Cloud Maiden’s; but
all in all this is far and away the best poem. This time Little Xue and Plantain Lover fail
to make the grade. We shall have to think of a penalty.’
      ‘That’s fair enough,’ said Bao-qin, laughing, ‘but what about someone who
failed to submit anything at all? What should his penalty be?’
‘Don’t worry about him,’ said Li Wan. ‘He will be punished too – exemplarily!’
      Just at that moment there was a crashing noise outside the window which made
them jump. It sounded as if an outer casement had somehow come unfastened and
fallen into the bamboos. The maids ran outside to look. Other maids, who had been
waiting outside there all the time, told them what it was: a large kite shaped like a
butterfly which had fallen down and got caught in the tops of the bamboo.
‘What a beauty!’ said the maids from inside. ‘I wonder whose it is. They must have
cut the string. Let’s try and get it down.’
‘I recognize that kite,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It belongs to Uncle She’s new girl, Carmine.
Let’s take it down and give it back to her.’
‘There must be other kites like that besides hers,’ said Nightingale. ‘I think it’s silly
to say that it must be hers. Anyway, I don’t care. I’m going to get it down for us.’
‘How mean you are, Nightingale!’ said Tan-chun. ‘You’ve got a kite of your own
already. And if you keep someone else’s, aren’t you afraid of catching their bad luck?’
     ‘You’re right,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We don’t know whose bad luck it mightn’t be
bringing us. Take it away! Let’s take out our kite and get rid of our bad luck.’
Nightingale told the maids, who had by this rime succeeded in getting the kite down,
to take it to the women at the gate and hand it into their keeping. If anyone came
looking for it, they were to give it back to them. The other maids rushed off excitedly
to fetch Dai-yu’s kite. It was the kind called a ‘pretty lady’. While two of them carried
out the kite, one of them brought out a stool to stand on, another fastened the
cross-piece to the raising-stick, and another paid the string out from the winder.
Bao-chai stood with the other cousins at the gate of the courtyard, directing
operations. She told the girls to fly the kite in the open ground outside the courtyard.
‘This kite of yours isn’t nearly as pretty as Cousin Tan’s,’ Bao-qin told Dai-yu. ‘She
has one shaped like a phoenix, with wings that move.’
‘Why don’t you get yours and fly it then?’ Bao-chai said, turning to Tan-chun’s maid
Ebony.
    Ebony hurried off excitedly to do so. Bao-yu, catching the enthusiasm, sent a
maid off to fetch one of his own.
‘Bring the big fish one that Lai Da’s wife sent me yesterday,’ he told the girl.
After a long time gone, the girl came back empty-handed.
‘Skybright flew it yesterday and let it go.’
‘Really!’ said Bao-yu. ‘And I hadn’t even flown it once myself.’
Tan-chun laughed.
‘Never mind! At least she’s got rid of your bad luck for you!’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu to the girl. ‘Go and fetch the big crab one.’
The girl went off and returned accompanied by two or three other maids carrying a
large pretty lady kite and a winder.
‘Miss Aroma says she gave the crab one to Master Huan yesterday. She says why
don’t you fly this one instead? It was sent to you yesterday by Mrs Lin.’
Bao-yu inspected it. The pretty lady was certainly a beauti?fully constructed creature.
He was secretly pleased and told the girls to fly it.
Tan-chun’s kite had also arrived by now and Ebony was already standing on a little hill
getting it up with the assistance of a few helpers. Bao-qin had sent for her kite, a
large red bat, and Bao-chai, beginning to share the excitement herself, had had hers
fetched too: it was a line of seven large geese flying one behind the other. Soon all
the kites but one were up in the air being flown successfully. Bao-yu’s pretty lady was
the exception. He said it was because the maids didn’t know how to do it properly
and insisted on flying it himself; but after a good deal of manoeuvring he could get
her no higher than the roof, and even then it was only to flop down weakly again
upon the ground. Bao-yu was getting into quite a state and the perspiration stood
out in beads upon his brow. The cousins all laughed. At this he became so
exasperated that he picked the kite up, threw it down on the ground again, and
pointed his finger at it in anger.
‘If you weren’t a lady, I’d stamp on you and smash you into pieces!’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘The string isn’t fastened on right. If you could get someone to refasten it for you
properly, it would fly just as well as any other.’
Dao-yu sent someone to take the kite back for restringing and fetch him another
pretty lady that he could fly in the mean time.
All the cousins were now standing with their faces turned upwards, watching the
kites as they soared higher and higher into the sky. A maid came round offering them
all sweets. Pre?sently there was a cry from Nightingale:
‘The wind’s getting stronger, Miss. Do you want to release it now?’
Dai-yu made her handkerchief into a pad for her hand and tested the tension on the
string. The wind was certainly pulling it with some force. She took over the winder
from Nightingale and let it run free, so that the kite could pull itself away in the wind.
There was a whirring noise as the last of the string ran out. Dai-yu asked the others if
any of them would like to cut it for her.
‘No, we’ve all got our own,’ they said. ‘You do yours first.’
   ‘It’s fun to see them fly away,’ said Dai-yu, ‘and yet it seems rather a pity.’
‘But that’s the main reason for flying kites,’ said Li Wan, ‘the pleasure of seeing
them fly away. Not to mention the fact that it is supposed to get rid of your bad luck.
You of all people ought to let yours go, so as to get rid of your illness.’
‘Come on, Miss, you’ve sent plenty of kites off in your time!’ said Nightingale. ‘Why
be so stingy all of a sudden? If you won’t cut it, I’ll cut it for you.’
She snatched a little pair of West Ocean silver scissors out of Snowgoose’s hand and
snipped through the kite-string, an inch or so from the winder.
‘Go away, kite!’ she cried merrily. ‘And take my mistress’s illness with you!’
The kite began to swoop and soar. Soon it appeared no bigger than an egg. A few
moments later and it was only a dot in the sky. Another moment and it had
disappeared from sight altogether.
‘Hurrah! Hurrah!’ cried the cousins, as they watched it disappear.
‘What a pity we don’t know where she will land!’ said Bao-?yu. ‘It would be nice if
she landed somewhere where there are people and some little child were to find her.
But suppose she lands in some uninhabited wilderness: how lonely she will be! I
think I shall send my lady after her, to keep her com?pany!’
He asked for the scissors and cut the string himself, and a second pretty lady went
hurrying after the first one until it, too, disappeared.
Tan-chun was just about to cut the string of her phoenix when another phoenix
appeared in the sky, not far from hers.
‘I wonder whose that is?’ said Tan-chun.
‘Don’t cut yours yet,’ the others cried. ‘It looks as if that one is going to get caught
up in it.’
And that is just what happened. The other phoenix drew nearer and nearer until the
two strings crossed and tangled. The maids were all for winding Tan-chun’s kite in
and capturing the other kite with it, but the owner of the other kite was not
prepared to yield, and after a good deal of tugging and heaving on both sides, the
strings finally snapped and the two phoenixes flew off companionably together. The
cousins clapped their hands delightedly.
‘Well, I’ve released my kite and now I’m tired. I think I shall go in and rest,’ said
Dai-yu.
‘Just wait until we’ve released ours,’ said Bao-chai, ‘and then we can all go.’
So she and Xiang-yun and Bao-qin each cut their kite-strings and watched their kites
fly away, after which all of cousins went back to their own apartments.
*
In spite of the reprieve, Bao-yu dared not abandon his lessons altogether and
continued to do a little revision or calligraphy from time to time. When he was
feeling bored, he would go out to seek the company of the girls, or go round to the
Naiad’s House for a chat. The girls, for their part, knowing how much he was behind
with his work, no longer sent anyone to invite him when they met together for
poetry-reading or other diversions; and Dai-yu, in her anxiety lest he should once
more incur his father’s wrath, frequently feigned sleep when he went round to see
her, so as not to be the cause of keeping him from his studies. Bao-yu was reduced to
spending more and more time in his own room, where work itself now often took the
place of a diversion.
     In this manner the summer gradually wore away. Autumn was just beginning
when one day two of his grandmother’s maids came round in a very agitated state to
summon him.
     The purpose of the summons and the reason for their agitation will be explained
in the chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 71

Lady Xing deliberately humiliates her
Daughter-in-law
And Faithful inadvertently interrupts
a pair of love-birds



It was the news of Jia Zheng’s imminent homecoming that had caused the
maidservants’ agitation. As an Education Officer, Jia Zheng was supposed to report on
his commission as soon as he arrived and, being a very conscientious man, he would
have thought it improper even to look in on his family before doing so. When,
therefore, at the news of his coming, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Bao-yu went out to
the first poststage beyond the walls to welcome him, he merely inquired after his
mother’s health, bowing respectfully in her direction as he did so, and told them to
go back and wait for him at home. After his interview next day with the All-highest,
his mission was formally completed and he could return with a good conscience to
his family. The All-highest had been graciously pleased to grant him a whole month’s
leave of absence in which to rest and recuperate at home.
      Jia Zheng was beginning to age now, and the worries and responsibilities of
office had taken their toll of his health. It was good to be back after so long an
absence from those nearest and dearest to him; he was determined to relax and
enjoy himself to the utmost, refused even to think about money matters or domestic
responsibilities, and spent all his time reading, or, when he felt in need of company,
drinking and playing Go with his literary gentlemen, or enjoying the de?lights of
family life with his wife and mother in the women’s apartments inside.
     This year the third day of the eighth month was Grandmother Jia’s eightieth
birthday. A formidable number of people would have to be invited and there was
even some doubt whether they would be able to accommodate them all.
After discussion by the menfolk of both mansions, it was decided that there should
be eight days of entertaining, beginning on the twenty-eighth of the seventh month
and ending on the fifth day of the eighth on each of these days banquets would be
given in both mansions: in the Ning-guo mansion for male guests and in the
Rong-guo mansion for female ones. The Painted Chamber, Prospect Hall and one or
two other of the larger buildings in Prospect Garden would be used as rest?rooms for
the ladies. The programme of entertaining would be as follows: the twenty-eighth
would be for Imperial kinsmen, Princes and Princesses of the Blood and their
consorts, Royal Highnesses, Serene Highnesses and members of the high nobility; the
twenty-ninth would be for Ministers of State and Civil and Military Governors and
their wives; the thirtieth for official colleagues and their wives and members of other
clans related to the Jia family by marriage; on the first of the eighth month a family
party would be given by Jia She, on the second one by Jia Zheng and on the third one
by Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian; on the fourth a joint entertainment would be given by all
members of the Jia clan irrespective of age and seniority; and on the fifth there
would be another joint enter?tainment organized by Lai Da, Lin Zhi-xiao and the
other senior domestics.
Ever since the beginning of the seventh month presents had been coming in almost
continuously. From the highest source of all an order was received by the Board of
Rites                                                   authorizing the bestowal of the
following:
a ru-yi sceptre of gold and jade four lengths of tribute satin
four gold and jade cups
five hundred taels of silver from the Imperial Treasury
Yuan-chun’s gifts, which were delivered to the mansion by eunuchs, were:
a golden figurine of Old Longevity
a staff of aloeswood
a rosary of putchuk beads
a box of Fu Shou incense
a pair of golden medallions
four pairs of silver ingots
twelve lengths of tribute satin
four jade cups
And there were presents too numerous to mention from princes and princesses and
from the families of a host of civil and military officials both great and small who
were on visiting terms with the Jias. Several long tables were carried into the main
reception hall and covered with red baize and the choicest presents set out on them
every day for Grandmother Jia’s inspection. She went along for the first day or two
and took some pleasure in examining her gifts, but soon grew tired of this and told
Xi-feng to look after them for her: she would look at them herself some other day,
when she had nothing better to do.
      By the twenty-eighth both mansions had been hung with lanterns and
festooned all over with garlands. Painted phoenixes gambolled on folding screens,
embroidered lotuses blossomed on drapes and covers, and the sound of fluting and
piping could be heard several streets away. The only guests that day at the Ning-guo
mansion were the Prince of Bei-jing, the Prince of Nan-an, Princess Yang-chang’s
Consort, the Prince of Luo-shan and a number of noblemen whose families had long
been on friendly terms with the Jias. At the Rong-guo mansion the guests were the
Dowager Princess of Nan-an, the Prince of Bei-jing’s Consort, and the ladies of the
various aforementioned noblemen. Grandmother Jia and the others were dressed in
full court rig to receive them. After the initial salutations were over, the visitors were
conducted to Prospect Hall inside the Garden, where they took tea and ‘changed
their clothes’. From there they were conducted to the Hall of Exalted Felicity, where
they offered formal con?gratulations to Grandmother Jia before finally, after much
polite bowing and deferring, taking their places at the banquet. The Dowager
Princess of Nan-an and the Prince of Bei?jing’s Consort sat at the two central tables
at the back of the hall; the two rows of tables arranged at right-angles to left and
right of theirs were occupied in order of precedence, the Marchioness of Jin-xiang
and the Countess of Lin-an heading the row upon the left, while Grandmother Jia, as
hostess, occupied the first of the right-hand ones. Lady Xing and Lady Wang stood in
attendance behind Grandmother Jia’s chair, with You-shi, Xi-feng and a number of
other Jia ladies fanning out to left and right behind them. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and Lai
Da’s wife stood by the bamboo curtain on one side of the hall supervising the
transportation of dishes and wine-kettles by a small army of serving-women, while
Zhou-Rui’s wife directed the waitresses from the other side of the folding screens.
Meanwhile the attendants brought with them by the lady visitors were being
entertained elsewhere.
     Outside, on the temporary stage that had been erected in the courtyard, the
players were due to begin their performance. In honour of the occasion they began
by kneeling in a row at the front of it and offering their birthday congratulations to
the old lady, while twelve little maids, dressed up as page-boys in identical costumes,
stood solemnly to attention below the stage. When the players had finished, one of
these little girl-pages advanced to the foot of the steps leading up to the hall with a
playbill in her hands. She was relieved of it by a serving-woman who had been
stationed there for the sole purpose of receiving and carrying messages. This woman
handed it to Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, who put it on a salver, edged herself through the
bamboo curtain, and carried it to Cousin Zhen’s concubine, Lovey. Lovey handed it to
You-shi, and You-shi walked up and offered it to the Dowager Princess of Nan-an. The
Dowager Princess, after first, for politeness’ sake, de?clining, chose one of those
congratulatory pieces which are customarily performed on these occasions. The
Prince of Bei-jing’s Consort, whose turn it was next, did exactly the same. The rest of
the ladies insisted that the players themselves should put on whatever they thought
best, for it was sure to be good.
     After four courses of various dishes and one of soup, the visitors’ attendants
gave their mistresses’ largesse to the players, and the ladies returned to the Garden
to ‘change their clothes’ and sample a very special tea. The Dowager Princess of
Nan-an asked Grandmother Jia about Bao-yu.
     ‘Several temples are reading the Immaculate Diamond for me today,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘He has gone to kneel a while in each one of them while they do
the reading.’
‘And what about your granddaughters?’ said the Princess.
‘Oh, this one is ill and that one is weakly and the other is too shy to see anyone.
They are looking after my room for me today. We have more players than we need,
so I thought we might as well let them have a troupe to themselves. I expect they are
at this moment sitting with their cousins and watching a play in my courtyard.’
      ‘Do send for them!’ said the old princess coaxingly.
      Grandmother turned to where Xi-feng was standing behind her.
      ‘Go and fetch your Cousin Shi and the two Xue girls and your Cousin Lin, will you?
Oh, and you can bring your Cousin Tan with you as well.’
      Xi-feng went to Grandmother Jia’s place. All the girls were there, nibbling sweets
and watching a play, as Grandmother Jia had said they would be. Bao-yu had just got
back from his kneeling. In obedience to her message, Bao-chai, Bao-qin, Dai-yu,
Tan-chun and Xiang-yun followed her back into the Garden and made their curtseys
to the assembled ladies. Some of the guests had seen them before, some had not;
but all alike exclaimed admiringly at their beauty. Of the five girls Xiang?yun was the
most familiar to those present.
      ‘Naughty girl!’ said the Dowager Princess waggishly. ‘You should have come
yourself to see me when you heard that I was here, not waited to be called! I shall
have a bone to pick with your uncle now, next time I see him!’
      She took Tan-chun by one hand and Bao-chai by the other and drew them
towards her.
      ‘And how old are you girls?’ she asked.
      She released them, after several times commenting what ‘fine girls’ they were,
and then subjected Dai-yu and Bao?-qin to the same treatment, taking them by the
hand, scrutiniz?ing each of them in turn, and extravagantly praising their good looks.
      ‘Dear me, they are all such lovely girls!’ she said laughing. ‘I really don’t know
which of them I prefer.’
      Suitable presents had now been made ready by an attendant: five gold rings,
five jade rings and five wristlets of aromatic beads.
‘Rather trifling presents I am afraid, my dears,’ said the Dowager Princess. ‘Perhaps
you could give them to your maids.’
     The five girls kotowed their thanks. There were more presents from the Prince
of Bei-jing’s Consort and from the other ladies present - but there is no need to
enumerate them.
     When they had finished their tea, the ladies walked for a while in the Garden,
after which Grandmother Jia invited them to return to the banquet; but the Dowager
Princess of Nan-an took her leave. ‘To tell you the truth, I am not feeling very well
today,’ she said. ‘I would not have stayed away for the world, but I am sure you will
understand if I leave a little early.’
     Under the circumstances, Grandmother Jia could not very well press her to stay,
and after some polite skirmishing when the Princess protested that she could
perfectly well find her way off the premises alone, the entire company saw her to the
gate of the Garden, where she climbed into her palanquin and was carried away. The
Prince of Bei-jing’s Consort returned with the rest of them to the Hall of Exalted
Felicity and sat with them there for some minutes, but then she too took her leave.
Of the other ladies some stayed on to the end, others left when a decent interval had
elapsed after the departure of the two princesses.
      The day’s entertaining left Grandmother Jia exhausted and next day she was
unable to see anyone and stayed in her own room. Lady Xing and Lady Wang had to
receive the female guests on her behalf. As for the male ones, those of them who
wanted to offer their birthday congratulations had to do so in the outer reception
hall. Their salutations were returned, obeisance for obeisance and bow for bow, by
Jia She, Jia Zheng and Cousin Zhen, who then conducted them to the banquet
prepared for them in Ning-guo House. But that is enough of banquets.
*
       As long as the birthday celebrations continued, You-shi did not go back to the
Ning-guo mansion to sleep. During the daytime she helped the others to entertain
the guests. In the evenings, after some time spent in Grandmother Jia’s apartment
chatting with the old lady, she would help Xi-feng supervise the getting out and
putting away of the porcelain, gold and silver ware and other things that had been
used that day or would be on the next, and the going over and setting out on display
of the most recently-arrived batch of presents. After that she would go to Li Wan’s
place to spend the night.
       On one of these evenings she had just finished waiting on Grandmother Jia
while she took her evening meal, when the old lady exempted her from further
services.
       ‘You must be tired,’ she said. ‘I know I am. Why don’t you go and have a bite to
eat yourself now and then go to bed? You will have to be up early again tomorrow.’
       You-shi thanked her and went off to Xi-feng’s room hoping for some supper.
Xi-feng was in the upstairs storage-room, however, supervising the putting away of
some screens that had just arrived. Only Patience was at home, folding up some of
Xi-feng’s clothes. Remembering Patience’s many kindnesses to Er-jie while she was
still alive, You-shi nodded her head sympathetically.
       ‘You are a good-hearted girl, Patience. I am afraid you have a great deal to put
up with.’
       Patience’s eyes reddened, but she forbore to say anything. You-shi asked her if
Xi-feng had eaten yet. Patience smiled.
       ‘She wouldn’t eat without first asking you,’ she said.
     ‘In that case I’ll go and look for a bite elsewhere,’ said You?-shi. ‘I don’t know
why, but I’m absolutely ravenous.’
     ‘Don’t go!’ said Patience. ‘We’ve got some mince rolls. Why not make do with
one or two of those now and have supper with Mrs Lian when she gets back?’
     ‘No, I can see you’re busy,’ said You-shi. ‘I think I shall go into the Garden to see
the girls.’
     Since she obviously wanted to go, Patience made no further effort to detain her.
     When You-shi came to the Garden she found the main gate and all the side
gates still open and blazing with lights. Turning to the maid who accompanied her,
she told her to go and fetch one of the women who were supposed to be on duty.
The maid went into the duty room in the gatehouse, but not a soul was anywhere to
be seen. She came back and told You?-shi. Very well, said You-shi, then she should go
and fetch one of the stewardesses from the mansion. The maid went back into the
mansion to the corner-house inside the inner gate which was used by the
stewardesses as a meeting-place, but its only occupants on this occasion were two
women busily engaged in sharing out some left-overs for their supper.
‘Where are the stewardesses, then?’ the girl asked them. ‘My mistress from the
Ning-guo is waiting for someone to give an order to.’
The women continued with their sharing-out. They felt little inclined to put
themselves out for a visitor from the other mansion.
‘The stewardesses have all gone home,’ said one of them.
‘In that case you’d better go and get one from her lodgings,’ said the maid.
‘Our job is to look after the rooms here, not to run errands,’ said the woman. ‘If you
want someone fetched, you’d better go and find someone whose job it is to fetch
them.’
‘But this is rank mutiny!’ said the maid. ‘Not your job to run errands? You might
fool a newcomer with such talk, but you don’t fool me! If I’d asked you to go to one
of the stewardesses with a private message or tell her to come and collect a tip,
you’d be trotting off like a little puppy-dog to its master. There’d be no talk then
about it not being your job to do errands. I’d like to hear you give Mrs Lian such an
answer!’
Partly because they had had a drop to drink and partly because what the girl said was
uncomfortably close to the truth, the women’s resentment quickly flared into anger.
     ‘Impertinent little baggage! We know very well what our job is; we don’t need
you to tell us. And before you start criticizing us, you might take a look at your own
parents. The way they suck up to the stewards and stewardesses at your place is
downright disgusting. You keep to your mansion and we’ll keep to ours. Go and make
trouble for your own people if you have a mind to, but keep away from us!’
     The maid had become white-faced with anger.
     ‘Good!’ she said ‘Very good!’ and turning about, walked straight back into the
Garden to report all this to her mistress.
     On entering the Garden some minutes previously, You-shi had come upon
Aroma, Bao-qin and Xiang-yun laughing at a story that two nuns from the Convent of
the Saviour King were telling them. When You-shi told them how hungry she was,
they invited her to sit with them in the courtyard of Green Delights while Aroma
went indoors to get her something to eat. Aroma found some rolls with meat and
some with vege?table stuffing in them and put them in a food-box to carry out to her.
She also brought out some tea for Bao-qin and Xiang-?yun to sip while You-shi was
eating the rolls. The nuns con?tinued with their story. At that moment the maid
arrived, still bursting with indignation, and proceeded to tell You-shi about her
encounter and what the two women had said. You-shi was silent for some moments
before she made any comment.
     ‘What extraordinary behaviour!’ she said finally.
     One of the nuns gave the maidservant a prod.
     ‘You are too quick-tempered, my child! You don’t want to go repeating what
those silly old women said to you. Your mistress is quite worn out from all her
exertions during these past few days. What she needs is a little pick-me-up,
something to cheer her up a bit. That’s what we’re trying to do, cheer her up. This is
no time to come troubling her with that sort of talk!’
     Aroma took the girl by the hand.
     ‘Go off and calm down a bit, there’s a good girl! I’ll get someone to fetch one of
the stewardesses.’
     ‘It isn’t necessary,’ said You-shi. She addressed herself to the maid. ‘Go and fetch
those two women, and when you’ve done that, you can find out where Mrs Lian is
and tell her I want to see her.’
     ‘I’ll go,’ said Aroma.
     ‘I’d rather you didn’t,’ said You-shi.
     The two nuns rose to their feet with propitiatory smiles.
     ‘Come, Mrs Zhen! You are such a kind, forgiving person as a rule. Surely you are
not going to lose your temper on Her Old Ladyship’s birthday? Whatever would
people say?’
Bao-qin and Xiang-yun added their own smiling entreaties.
‘All right,’ said You-shi, ‘I’ll let them off - but only because it is Lady Jia’s birthday.’
Unfortunately Aroma had in the meantime already sent a junior maid outside the
Garden to look for someone, and this girl was already pouring an account of what
had happened into the receptive ear of Zhou Rui’s wife, who, as it happened, was the
first person she ran into.
      Although Zhou Rui’s wife was not actually a stewardess, she regarded herself as
being of equal dignity with one on account of her special relationship with Lady
Wang, who had brought her from the Wang household when she was married;
moreover she was a somewhat insinuating woman, whose eagerness to please made
her a popular servant with the younger mistresses. What the maid told her brought
her flying over at once to Green Delights, brimming over with sympathy and concern.
      ‘How shocking! Poor Mrs Zhen! No wonder she is so angry! I wish I had been
there. I should have boxed their ears for them on the spot and settled accounts with
them later!’
      These worthy sentiments were uttered by her on the way. You-shi was pleased
to see her when she arrived.
      ‘Ah, my dear Zhou! Perhaps you will tell me whether or not I was right to feel
concerned. When I came into the Garden just now, all the gates were wide open and
candles were still burning in all the lanterns. Anyone would have been free to go in or
come out as they pleased. I thought how awful it would be if anything were to
happen, but when I gave orders for the duty-women to close the gates and put the
lights out, not a single one was to be found.’
      ‘Good gracious!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Mrs Lian gave special orders about this
only a few days ago and already they’re disobeying them! She’ll have to flog a few of
them when this is over; that’s the only way to cure this sort of thing.’
      You-shi then told her what the two women had said to her maid.
      ‘Well, don’t let it upset you, Mrs zhen,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Just wait until these
celebrations are over: I’ll have a word with the stewardesses and we’ll take that
precious pair and flog the daylights out of them. “You keep to your mansion and we’ll
keep to ours” indeed! They’ll be singing a different tune from that by the time we’ve
finished with them!’
      In the midst of this excitement someone arrived from Xi?feng’s, inviting You-shi
to come back for some supper.
      ‘I’m not hungry,’ said You-shi. ‘I’ve just been eating some rolls. Tell your mistress
to have her supper without me.’
      Zhou Rui’s wife went round herself to Xi-feng’s place shortly afterwards to
repeat all this story to Xi-feng.
      ‘All you need do is make a note of the women’s names,’ Xi-feng told her. ‘When
these celebrations are over, you can have them tied up and sent over to Mrs Zhen to
punish or pardon as she sees fit. It isn’t a very serious matter.’
      Now as it happened, Zhou Rui’s wife was on very bad terms with these two
women, and in her impatience to proceed against them, she put a somewhat loose
construction on the warrant given her by Xi-feng, for she first of all sent a boy round
to Lin Zhi-xiao’s house to say that Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife was wanted by You-shi
immediately, and then sent some other servants to apprehend the two women, tie
them up, and hand them over to the grooms to be shut up in the stables and kept
under guard there until further notice.
     Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, when she got the message, at once got into her carriage,
wondering what on earth could be the matter, and hurried over to Xi-feng’s place to
inquire; but when, on reaching the inner gate, she sent someone inside to announce
her, a maid came out and told her that Xi-feng had already gone to bed.
     ‘It’s Mrs Zhen that wants to see you,’ said the girl. ‘She’s in the Garden now.
You’d better look for her there.’
     Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife went into the Garden and hurried through it to Sweet-rice
Village. You-shi was quite put out when the maids announced her arrival. She had
her invited in immediately and smiled at her apologetically as she entered.
      ‘I only asked for you because I wanted to give an order and nobody could be
found. It wasn’t anything serious. It certainly wasn’t serious enough to call you out
for specially. It is all over and done with now, in any case.’
      Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife smiled, a trifle grimly.
      ‘But madam, Mrs Lian sent someone round to my place to say that you were
asking for me.’
      ‘If I was, it was under the impression that you were still here,’ said You-shi. ‘I
suppose it must be Zhou’s wife who told Mrs Lian about this. She need not have done
so. It was really nothing of any consequence. Please go back home to bed.’
      Li Wan was on the point of telling Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife what the trouble was, but
You-shi would not let her. Since evidently neither lady was going to tell her, Lin
Zhi-xiao’s wife took her leave. Just as she was coming out of the Garden gate, she ran
into Aunt Zhao.
      ‘Good gracious me! Still on your feet at this hour, Mrs Lin?’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’d
have thought you’d be at home and tucked up in bed by now!’
      ‘I was at home,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, and proceeded to tell Aunt Zhao why she
had been called out (for she had privately found out the reason for the summons
before going into the Garden).
      ‘Well, fancy calling you out for a piddling little thing like that!’ said Aunt Zhao
indignantly. ‘She should either have ignored it altogether, if she was feeling generous,
or if she was in an unforgiving mood, had the women given a few whacks and that
would have been the end of the matter. There was no need to drag you out specially.
I won’t ask you in for a cup of tea now, you’ll probably be wanting to get back to bed.’
      Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife continued on her way to the side gate where her carriage was
waiting. The young daughters of the two imprisoned women were lying in wait for
her there and, when they saw her coming, tearfully entreated her to intercede for
their mothers. Liin Zhi-xiao’s wife merely laughed at them.
     ‘Silly children! Those mothers of yours ought not to drink so much or be so free
with their tongues - that’s the cause of all this trouble. I don’t know what makes
them do it. It’s Mrs Lian who had them tied up and I’m in trouble myself now, so I
don’t know what I can do to help them.’
     The two daughters, being only little girls and of very limited understanding,
continued to blubber and entreat and clung so obstinately to Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife that
she was unable to get into her carriage. She rounded on one of the two girls
exasperatedly.
     ‘Stupid creature!’ she said. ‘What do you want to come hanging around me for
when you could find help elsewhere? Wasn’t your elder sister married to Mrs Fei’s
boy recently? Mrs Fei came here with Lady Xing when she was married. If you were
to tell your sister about this and get her to have a word with Mrs Fei and Mrs Fei
spoke about it to Lady Xing, that would be the end of the matter.’
      Glad to be reminded, the girl went scampering off immediately; but the other
girl continued to entreat. Lin Zhi?xiao’s wife shoved her off impatiently.
      ‘You really are a stupid child! Didn’t I just say that if she has a word with her
sister that will be the end of the matter? That means they’ll both be let off. You
surely don’t think they’d let her mother off and give yours a beating?’
      She got into her carriage then and drove back home.
The first little girl went and told her sister, as Lin Zhi?-xiao’s wife had told her to, and
the sister at once repeated the story to her mother-in-law, Goody Fei. This Goody Fei
was a notorious trouble-maker, whose first reaction to the story was a stream of
invective, fully audible to the occupants of all the neighbouring courtyards, after
which she went to solicit help from Lady Xing.
      ‘It’s my boy’s mother-in-law, my lady: she only had a few words with a maid of
Mrs Zhen’s, but that Zhou woman told such a pack of lies about her to Mrs Lian that
she had my boy’s mother-in-law and the woman that was with her tied up and shut
in the stables and in a few days’ time she’s going to have them both beaten. Do,
please, my lady, put in a good word with Mrs Lian and ask her to let them off.’
      Ever since the Faithful fiasco Grandmother Jia’s attitude towards Lady Xing
seemed to have hardened, whilst Xi-feng’s stature seemed to have grown at her
mother-in-law’s expense. The jealousy and resentment that Lady Xing felt as a
conse?quence of this had recently been exacerbated by an imagined slight: the
passing over of Ying-chun when the Dowager Princess of Nan-an asked to see the Jia
girls and Tan-chun was the only one of the three to be called. Mischief-makers were
not wanting to play upon her resentment, in this case repre?senting Xi-feng’s action
as a deliberate attack on her authority.
      Her hatred of Xi-feng had now reached a degree of intensity that went beyond
all reason.
      Early next morning she went to pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. This was
the junior clansmen’s day. When Lady Xing got there, the junior clansmen had
already arrived and the players were waiting to begin. Grandmother Jia always
enjoyed meeting young people, and so today she was appear?ing in person to
receive their congratulations, dressed in her ordinary clothes, since this was a family
party and the guests were all her juniors. She was reclining in the middle of the rear
part of the hall on a large wooden couch furnished with a back-rest and bolsters and
a footstool in front of it in case she should wish to sit upright. Around her couch were
ranged a number of identical stools on which Bao-chai, Bao-qin, Dai-Yu, Xiang-yun,
Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun were sitting. Of the twenty or so girls of their
generation whose mothers had brought them there on this occasion two, Jia Bin’s
sister Xi-luan and Jia Qiong’s sister Si-jie, had, on account of their good looks,
well-spokenness and charming manners, found particular favour with Grandmother
Jia and been invited to sit on stools with the other seven. Bao-yu sat up on the couch
with his grandmother and massaged her legs for her. Aunt Xue had been given the
place of honour in the ordering of the feast and the two lines of tables which rayed
out on either side were occupied by the other ladies according to their husbands’
seniority in the clan. The men sat on the verandah at either side of the hall, also in
order of seniority.
      Presently the birthday ceremony began. The female members of the clan were
the first to make their kotows. The males would have come next, but Grandmother
Jia lay back on the couch and sent someone outside to excuse them. Then Lai Da
arrived with the male domestics. They knelt down, row upon row of them, from the
ornamental gate all the way up to the steps at the foot of the hall, to make their
kotows. After them it was the turn of the married women, and after them of the
maids. Something like the time it would take to eat two or three meals must have
elapsed before all the kotowing was over. Next a number of bird-cages were set
down in the middle of the courtyard and the birds released from them. Then Jia She
and the other seniors supervised the burning of paper offerings to Heaven-and-Earth
and Old Longevity. Only then did the drinking and the play-acting begin.
      Grandmother Jia remained until the players’ mid-day interval before retiring to
rest in her own room. She insisted that those of them who had escorted her there
should go back and enjoy themselves, and asked Xi-feng to arrange for Xi-luan and
Si-jie to stay on for a couple of nights after the party.
     Xi-feng went off to speak to the girls’ mothers. Both had received favours from
her in the past and were only too happy to comply with anything she asked them,
and the girls themselves were of course delighted at the prospect of playing in the
Garden all day and not having to go home for the night.
     Lady Xing bided her time until the evening; then, just as everyone was getting
ready to go, she went up to Xi-feng in front of all the others and made her a request.
     ‘I understand that you became angry with two old women last night and sent
Zhou Rui’s wife to have them tied up. I don’t know what crime they had committed
and it isn’t of course my business to interfere, but it does seem to me that Lady Jia’s
birthday is an occasion when we should all be doing our utmost to help those less
fortunate than ourselves - giving money and free rice to the old and needy and that
sort of thing - hardly a time for maltreating aged domestics. Could you not see your
way to releasing them, for Lady Jia’s sake, if not for mine?’
Having said that, she got into her carriage and drove away.
The humiliation of being addressed like this in front of so many people filled Xi-feng
with anger and confusion. Her face turned a dusky red colour and for some moments
she was so taken aback that she was unable to speak; then, turning to Lai Da’s wife,
she said, with a forced laugh:
      ‘But this is ridiculous! Last night I heard that some of our people had been rude
to Mrs Zhen, and as I was afraid that she might be feeling vexed about it, I naturally
had them tied up so that they could be placed at her disposal. It wasn’t me they had
offended. I wonder what tale-bearing busybody is res?ponsible for carrying this story
next door?’
      ‘What exactly happened last night?’ asked Lady Wang.
      Xi-feng explained.
      ‘I didn’t even know about this myself,’ said You-shi, laughing. ‘Really, Feng, I
think you were a trifle officious.’
      ‘I was concerned about you,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You had been insulted. It was a
natural courtesy to place them at your disposal. Suppose I was at your place and
some of your people insulted me? Wouldn’t you send them over to me for me to
deal with? I thought that was a general principle which all of us observed, even if the
servant in question was a highly valued one. Some meddlesome person has blown
this incident up out of all proportion for the sake of stirring things up next door. I
shouldn’t have thought myself that it was worth mentioning even.’
      ‘Your mother-in-law was quite right,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Cousin Zhen’s wife is one
of us. There was no need for such empty courtesies in her case. Grandmother’s
birthday is much more important. The women ought to be released.’
      Xi-feng’s humiliation was now complete. A feeling of such wretchedness came
over her that she could no longer hold back the tears of anger that had been
collecting in her eyes. Not wishing them to be seen, she rushed back to her own
apartment to weep alone.
     She had hardly got back, though, when Grandmother Jia sent Amber round to
summon her. Amber noticed with surprise that she had been crying.
     ‘Hullo, what’s all this about? She’s waiting to ask you about something.’
     Xi-feng wiped away her tears, washed and dried her face, and put on a fresh lot
of make-up before accompanying Amber back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment.
     ‘How many of the people who sent presents gave me screens ?’ the old lady
asked Xi-feng when she arrived.
     ‘Sixteen,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There were twelve big screens and four little kang
screens. The biggest screen was from the Zhens of Nanking: a twelve panel folding
screen with a scene in silk tapestry on crimson satin from A Heap of Honours on one
side and Symbols of Longevity in powder-gold on the other. There’s also quite a good
enamelled screen from Admiral Wu’s lady.’
‘Yes, well don’t do anything with those two, then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Just put
them by somewhere where they will be safe. I want to give them to someone as a
present.’
      Faithful went over to Xi-feng and peered into her face.
      ‘What are you staring at her like that for?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Haven’t you
seen her before?’
      ‘I was wondering why her eyes are so swollen,’ said Faithful.
      ‘Come over here,’ Grandmother Jia commanded, and scrutinized Xi-feng herself.
      ‘It’s because my eyes were itching and I’ve been rubbing them,’ said Xi-feng.
      ‘Are you sure someone hasn’t been upsetting you?’ said Faithful, laughing.
      ‘Who would dare?’ said Xi-feng. ‘And even if they had, I wouldn’t dare to cry on
Her Old Ladyship’s birthday.’
      ‘I should think not indeed,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’m just going to have dinner
now. You can stay with me and watch me eat it, and then you and Zhen’s wife can
share what’s left over. The two of you can help these sisters here to pick up Buddha
beans.’ She indicated the pair of nuns whose presence Xi-feng had been vaguely
aware of on entering. ‘It will add some years to your life. I let Bao-yu and the girls do
it the other day. Now you two must have a go as well, so that no one can accuse me
of favouritism.’
      While she was speaking, the table had been laid and a meat?less meal served
for the two nuns. Then, when they had eaten, a meal with meat in it was served for
Grandmother Jia. When she in turn had finished, the remains of her meal were
carried into the outer room for Xi-feng and You-shi to eat. They had already started
when Grandmother Jia had Xi-luan and Si-jie sent for to join them. After they had
finished and washed their hands, some incense was lit and a pint of beans brought in,
over which the two nuns chanted some prayers. The two young women, each armed
with a pair of chopsticks, then had to pick the beans up one by one and drop them
into a basket, to be boiled next day and given away to passers-by in the street.
While they were thus engaged, Grandmother Jia reclined on her couch and listened
to edifying stories told her by the two nuns.
      Faithful had heard from Amber about Xi-feng’s crying and had been over to
Xi-feng’s apartment herself to find out the reason for it from Patience. Late that
evening, when everyone else had left, she spoke about it to Grandmother Jia.
      ‘Mrs Lian is still crying. It’s because she was shamed in front of everyone by Lady
Xing.’
      ‘Oh?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Why was that?’
      Faithful told her.
      ‘I think Feng acted quite correctly,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Surely we’re not going
to allow our slaves to insult everyone with impunity just because it’s my birthday? I
expect this was Lady Xing’s way of getting her own back for some grudge or other
that she hadn’t had the courage to tackle her about at the time. It’s hard to see what
other motive she could have had for humiliating her in public.’
    Just at that moment Bao-qin came in and the subject had to be dropped.
Bao-qin’s presence reminded Grandmother Jia of her two young visitors. She called
one of her women to her and gave her a message about them which she was to
convey to the principal womenservants in the Garden.
      ‘Tell them they must treat them just as they do our own young ladies. Anyone I
hear of behaving disrespectfully to either of them will be punished mercilessly.’
      ‘Better let me go,’ said Faithful, before the woman had had time to get away.
‘They’ll never listen to her.’
      She went off at once into the Garden. Her first call was at Sweet-rice Village; but
neither Li Wan nor You-shi was there. The maids there told her that they were in
Tan-chun’s apartment with the others, so she retraced her footsteps and called in at
Autumn Studio. She found Li Wan and You-shi in the Paulownia Room engaged in a
conversation, punctuated by frequent bursts of laughter, with the rest of the
Garden’s little society. They welcomed Faithful with smiles and urged her to be
seated.
      ‘What are you doing here at this late hour?, they asked her.
      ‘I suppose I’m allowed to walk in the Garden if I want to,’ said Faithful, and
passed on Grandmother Jia’s message about Xi-luan and Si-jie.
      Li Wan rose respectfully to receive it and at once sent some?one to transmit it
to the heads of all the apartments and instruct them to pass it on to their
subordinates.
      ‘Lady Jia has wonderful foresight,’ You-shi commented drily. ‘We energetic
younger ones may tie up a dozen servants, but we are still not so effective as her.’
      ‘I don’t know,’ said Li Wan. ‘Cousin Feng may not quite come up to Lady Jia’s
standard, but she doesn’t do too badly. Personally I find her foresight quite uncanny.
Certainly I could never hope to match it.’
      ‘You should have said “poor Cousin Feng”,’ said Faithful. ‘She’s in a bad way at
the moment. During all the years she has been managing things she may not have
put a foot wrong as far as Their Ladyships are concerned, but she has given a great
deal of offence elsewhere. A daughter-in-law’s life must be pretty impossible. If she is
too meek and mild her in-laws will complain that she is stupid and the servants won’t
respect her, yet if she shows any initiative, there is always another set of problems
rising up behind her back for every one that she deals with. In our household, where
there are a certain number of mistresses who used once themselves to be maids, it’s
particularly difficult. Such people are so full of their own importance that they are
always taking offence, and if they are the slightest bit crossed in anything they begin
spreading stories about you or finding other ways of stirring up trouble. I haven’t so
far liked to say anything to Her Old Ladyship about this for fear of making her angry.
If I ever do, people had better watch out, because then the sparks will begin to fly, I
can tell you! Perhaps I shouldn’t say this in front of you, Miss Tan, but you know how
certain people are always carrying on about the way Her Old Ladyship makes a
favourite of Bao-yu. Well now apparently that doesn’t matter any more. That’s just a
“natural preference”. Now it seems they’re angry because Her Old Ladyship has been
favouring you. Did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous?’
      ‘There are a lot of very silly people about,’ said Tan-chun. ‘One really can’t be
bothered with what they say. I often think how nice it would be to live in a smaller
household, even if it meant being poorer. Think how delightful it would be to have
just oneself and one’s parents and one or two brothers and sisters living together as
one happy little family! People look at our great household and all its wealth and
think how happy we must be; they don’t realize that the vexations far outweigh the
advantages.’
      ‘You’re much too thin-skinned, Tan,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m always telling you: you
should pay no attention to what vulgar people say or do but concentrate on enjoying
the luxuries and opportunities that wealth and position make available to us. Others
who lack these things have some reason to com?plain. Why make yourself miserable
when you have got them?’
      ‘We can’t all be as happy-go-lucky as you are,’ said You-shi. ‘All you think about
is amusing yourself with the girls, eating when you are hungry and sleeping when
you are tired. Each year to you is like the last. You haven’t a thought in your head
about the future.’
      ‘It’s the time I spend with the girls here that really matters,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I die,
I die. What do I care about the future?’
      Li Wan and the others laughed.
      ‘That’s a silly way to talk. Even if you don’t do anything with your life and spend
all the rest of it in here, you surely don’t think that the girls will be staying with you
as well? They’ll all be going off to get married.’
      ‘I can understand why people say your growth has all gone into good looks,’ said
You-shi. ‘You really are a silly fellow.’
      ‘Man’s life is uncertain,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Which of us knows when his time will
come? Even if I die today or tomorrow or this year or next year, at least I shall have
lived my life as I wanted to.’
The others would hardly let him finish what he was saying.
‘Worse and worse! Best not encourage him. What he was saying just now was
simpleton’s talk, but this is raging lunacy!’
      ‘Don’t talk about dying, Cousin Bao,’ said little Xi-luan. ‘Lady Jia and Lady Wang
are sure to feel lonely when all the girls have gone. I will come here and help you
keep them company.’
      Li Wan and You-shi both laughed.
      ‘Now you are talking like a simpleton, young lady. Don’t you think you will be
getting married then as well?’
      Xi-luan was overcome with bashfulness and hung her head. The first watch was
just sounding. They got up then and returned to their various apartments for the
night.
*
On her way back to Grandmother Jia’s, Faithful observed that one of the side gates of
the Garden was shut but not yet barred. There was no one about. A faint light burned
in the duty-room and a sliver of moon half-way up the sky shed a feeble radiance
from above. As she had no companion to talk to, carried no lantern, and was walking
softly, the women in the duty-room seemed not to have noticed her. She had for
some time been wanting to empty her bladder, and this seemed as good an
opportunity as any for doing so. She left the path and began looking for a place
where the grass was not too high to squat down in.
      She had found what looked like a good spot under a large osmanthus tree
behind a Tai-hu rock and was just making her way round the side of the rock to reach
it when a rustle of clothing caused her to jump almost out of her skin. By straining
her eyes she could make out two human shapes. They melted into the bushes at her
arrival, but Faithful had very sharp eyes, and before they disappeared, the faint
moonlight had enabled her to identify one of them by the red top, bouf?fant
hair-style, and tall, somewhat heavy build, as Ying-chun’s head maid, Chess. She
assumed that Chess and some other girl had been using the place as a convenience
and had hidden themselves in the bushes when they saw her coming, intending to
jump out at her presently and give her a scare.
‘Chess, come out of there!’ she called. ‘If you frighten me I shall scream, and then
you will be taken for a thief. This is no time to be playing monkey-tricks, a big girl like
you!’
     These words were spoken in jest with no other motive than to prevent Chess
jumping out and scaring her, but to Chess’s guilty conscience they seemed to imply
that the secret she was hiding had been discovered. She was terrified that Faithful
might cry out and others get to know about it as well, which would be even more
frightful: and as Faithful had always been kind to her in the past, she resolved to
throw herself on her mercy. Running out of the bushes, she knelt down and clung to
her imploringly.
      ‘Faithful, I beg of you, for God’s sake don’t cry out!’
      Not knowing what to make of this exaggerated reaction to her words, Faithful
hastily pulled her to her feet.
      ‘Well, well, what’s all this about?’
      Chess seemed unable to reply, but her body was trembling all over. Faithful was
more mystified than ever. She looked again in the direction from which Chess had
just come and saw a figure lurking there. It looked like a boy’s. She began to guess
the reason for Chess’s terror. A sickening embarrassment made her own heart beat
faster and she could feel her face burning to the very tips of her ears. She was afraid,
too. After a brief silence in which she managed to recover some of her composure,
she asked Chess, in a tremulous whisper, who ‘that other person’ was. Chess sank
once more to her knees.
      ‘He’s my cousin, Faithful,’ she said faintly, ‘my father’s sister’s son.’
      Faithful made a scornful sound, as if she did not believe her; but she was still
too embarrassed to say anything.
      ‘There’s no need to hide,’ Chess called out softly to the boy. ‘My friend here had
already seen you. Come out quickly and kotow.’
      The boy darted out from the cover of the tree, threw himself on his knees in
front of Faithful, and began knocking his head on the ground as if he were pounding
garlic in a mortar. Faithful wanted to turn away, but Chess clung to her tearfully and
beseechingly.
     ‘Our lives are in your hands, Faithful. Be merciful!’
     ‘Of course I shall; you don’t need to ask,’ said Faithful. ‘Tell him to go away.
Whatever happens, I shan’t tell anyone. There’s no need for all this drama.’
     Before she had finished speaking, a voice could be heard from the direction of
the corner gate.
     ‘Miss Faithful’s already gone out. We can bar the gate now.’
Chess was still clinging to her so hard that Faithful could not get away. She had to call
out to the woman from where she stood.
‘No, I’m still here. I’ve been doing something. Just a second: I’ll be out directly.’
Chess, when she heard her say that, was obliged to let her go. The rest will be told in
the following chapter.
CHAPTER 72

Wang Xi-feng refuses to see a
doctor
And Brightie’s wife seeks help
with a betrothal



As Faithful went out of the corner gate, her cheeks were still burning and her heart
was beating wildly. What an extraordinary encounter - and how unexpected! She
began to con?sider what the consequences would be if she were to tell anyone. A
crime involving both sexual delinquency and illicit entry could cost the offenders
their lives - and other persons might well be implicated. She resolved to keep her
discovery to herself. ‘After all,’ she reflected, ‘it is really no business of mine.’ And so,
when she got back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, she gave only a routine account
of her mission and went to bed without telling anyone about her experience.
But what of Chess? She and her father’s sister’s son - the boy whom Faithful had
discovered with her in the Garden - had often played together as little children. In
those days they were childhood sweethearts, innocently vowing, before they even
knew the full meaning of the vow, that they would be husband and wife when they
grew up or else would never marry. The years passed by and each grew up into a
good-looking adolescent. Significant looks would pass between them when they saw
each other during Chess’s occasional visits home, and they knew, without needing to
tell each other, that the childhood bond between them was as strong as ever. As they
were both dreadfully afraid that their parents would oppose their meeting, they
contrived - he working on his side and she on hers - to buy the support of the Garden
women, so that gates might be left conveniently unbarred and notice obligingly be
given when the coast was clear; and now, today, taking advantage of the confusion
caused by the birthday celebrations, they had met for the first time inside the Garden.
They had not yet reached the point of physical union when Faithful surprised them,
but they had exchanged vows and keepsakes and passionate endearments and were
not far off it. Shortly after their discovery by Faithful, the boy managed to dodge
away through the bushes and slip out of the corner gate unseen.
Chess did not sleep that night. She lay awake until dawn, bitterly regretting that she
had ever agreed to the assignation. Meeting Faithful next day caused her to go hot
and cold by turns, and all day long she felt as wretched and uncomfortable as if she
were carrying a devil’s child inside her. She had lost all her appetite for food and
drink, and whether sitting or standing felt equally jumpy and ill at ease. This
continued for two days. When two days had gone by and still nothing had happened,
she began to feel a little easier.
But then one morning one of the old women from the Garden gate came round and
whispered some news to her.
‘Your cousin’s run away. He hasn’t been home now for three or four days. They’re
out everywhere looking for him.’
A wave of mingled alarm, anger and grief swept over her.
‘Even if she’d told, he ought to have stayed,’ she thought, ‘and we could have died
together. How can he love me, running away like that, without even waiting to find
out?’
As a result of this latest shock she woke up next morning with a feeling of weakness
inside her, and after trying unsuccessfully for a while to drag herself around, was
forced to go back and lie down. This time she was ill in earnest.
When Faithful heard that one of the boys had unaccountably run away and that
Chess was so ill that there was already talk of moving her out of the Garden, she was
sure that in either case it was fear that she might betray them that had been the
cause. So concerned did she feel about this that, on the pretext of paying a sick visit,
she went to see Chess and reassure her. As soon as she could get the others out of
the room, she swore a most solemn oath that she would never give her away.
‘So just stop worrying and get better.’ she told her. ‘You are too young to throw
your life away because of a thing like this.’
Chess clung to her hand and wept.
‘Dear Faithful! We’ve known each other now since we were little girls. You have
always been nice to me, and I have always respected you. If you really don’t tell
anyone about this stupid mistake of mine, I promise to honour you as if you were my
mother. From now on, each day I live will be a day I owe to you. If I get better, I shall
set up a tablet with your name on it and kotow and burn incense to it every day and
pray that you may have a long and happy life. But if I die, then I hope I may be reborn
as a dog or an ass, if only I can have the chance to repay you.’
She went on to say much more in this vein, the tears all the while streaming down
her cheeks, so that Faithful herself became affected and began to cry as well.
‘It’s your own imagination that is making you so ill,’ she said, shaking her head sadly.
‘Why should I want to go out of my way to destroy your reputation? To win
someone’s approval? Surely you know me better than that? In any case, I am much
too shy to talk about such things. Please stop worrying. From now on you must start
getting better. And when you are better, try to live a little more sensibly in future.
Don’t go getting yourself into scrapes like this again.’
Chess nodded her head vigorously upon the pillow. After speaking a few more words
to comfort her, Faithful took her leave.
Faithful had noticed that Xi-feng had been somewhat off colour during these past few
days. She happened to know that Jia Lian was out and thought she might as well drop
in on Xi-feng on her way back and ask how she was. The servants on the inner gate
stood up as she approached and remained standing until she disappeared into
Xi-feng’s court?yard. As she entered the reception room, Patience was just emerging
from inside. She smiled when she saw Faithful and hurried up to her.
‘She’s just eaten and now she’s having an afternoon nap,’ she said in a low voice.
‘Come into the other room and we’ll have a chat.’
At her insistence Faithful accompanied her into the room on the east side of the
reception room and sat down with her. A junior maid poured them both some tea.
‘Tell me, what’s been the matter with your mistress during these past few days?’
said Faithful. ‘She seems so lethargic.’
Patience sighed.
‘It’s not just these last few days,’ she said, having first looked round to make sure
that no one else was within hearing. ‘It goes back a month at least. It’s just that all
the work of the last few days and that upset with Lady Xing coming on top of it have
made her worse so that people are beginning to notice.
‘In that case why doesn’t she call a doctor?’
‘My dear Faithful,’ said Patience, ‘surely you know our Mrs Lian better than that?
It’s not just calling a doctor or taking medicine that she objects to. Sometimes,
because I can’t bear to see her looking so ill, I’ll ask her, quite casually, “How do you
feel today?”; but even that will be enough to make her angry. She says there’s
nothing wrong with her and that I’m trying to make her ill by talking about it. In spite
of feeling so poorly, she still insists on keeping up with everything that goes on in the
household. It worries me. How can she ever get better if she herself won’t face up to
the fact that she is ill?’
‘She really ought to call a doctor,’ said Faithful. ‘Surely it would be a relief just to
know what she is suffering from?’
Patience sighed.
‘Whatever it is, if you ask me, it’s something pretty serious.
‘Oh?’ said Faithful. ‘What kind of trouble is it then?’
Patience leaned forwards and spoke very softly into her ear.
‘During this past month, ever since she had her last period, it’s been drip-drip,
drip-drip all the time. Surely that’s serious, isn’t it?’
‘Aiyo!’ said Faithful. ‘It sounds as if the blood-gate has burst.’
Patience gave a little laugh.
‘Oh Faithful, you are a baby! What a thing to say! Poor Mrs Lian!’
Faithful coloured, and she laughed as well, a trifle sheepishly.
‘Well I don’t know what it means myself. It’s just that I heard them saying it about
my elder sister. You’ve probably forgotten: she died of something rather like this. I
was too young at the time to know what was the matter with her, but I remember
hearing my mother talking about it to my sister’s mother-in-law and one of them
saying “The blood-gate’s burst” and wondering at the time what it could mean. Later
on, when I heard more about her illness, I thought I under?stood, but I don’t suppose
I did really.’
While they were talking, a little maid came in with a message.
‘Old Mrs Zhu has been again. We told her the mistress had just laid down for her
afternoon nap so she went off to Lady Wang’s room.’
Patience nodded.
‘Which Mrs Zhu is that?’ said Faithful.
‘She’s an official marriage-broker working for one of the yamens,’ said Patience.
‘She’s come on behalf of Sir Sun Somebody-or-other who wants one of our young Jia
ladies for his son. Old nuisance! She’s been around here every day during the past
few days, flashing her card at everyone.’
At that moment another little maid came hurrying into the room.
‘Mr Lian’s back!’
Patience hurried out to meet him as he stepped into the reception room outside. He
began walking into the side room, since it was the room that Patience had just come
out of, but halted on the threshold when he caught sight of Faithful sitting inside on
the kang.
‘Ah, my dear Faithful!’ he said, smiling broadly. ‘What favourable wind has blown
you to our humble abode?’
Faithful smiled back at him. She made no effort to get up.
‘I came here to pay my respects to you and Mrs Lian, but one of you was out and
the other one was having a nap.’
‘You’re so busy all the year round waiting on Her Old Ladyship,’ said Jia Lian, still
smiling, ‘it’s we who should come to see you, not the other way round.’ He paused.
‘As a matter of fact it’s rather a stroke of luck that you have come here today. I was
on my way to see you just now. The only reason I dropped in here was because this
gown I am wearing is too hot and I wanted to change into something cooler before
going on to see you. But God is good to me, it seems: your being here means that I
am saved the trouble of going out again.’
He sat himself down in a chair.
‘What was it you wanted to see me about?’ said Faithful.
Jia Lian gave a preliminary laugh.
‘Something I’ve forgotten about that you may perhaps remember. On Her Old
Ladyship’s birthday last year some travelling monk made her a present of a Buddha’s
hand modelled in coloured wax. She was so taken with it that she immediately had it
put on display somewhere where she could admire it. When I was going through the
inventory of her ornaments the other day in preparation for these birthday
celebrations, I found an entry for the thing but couldn’t discover where it had got to;
and as I wasn’t able to tick it off on the inventory, the steward of the ornaments
room has been on to me a couple of times since then asking me to find out where it
is. Do you know? Has Her Old Ladyship still got the thing on display somewhere in
her own apartment, or has she handed it over to someone else?’
‘After she’d had it on display for a couple of days, she grew tired of it and gave it to
Mrs Lian,’ said Faithful. ‘I don’t know why you should be asking me about it! I can
even remember the day, and the person I sent round with it. It was Old Wang’s wife.
You should ask Mrs Lian or Patience about it. They will tell you.’
Patience, who had just been seeing to some clothes, came hurrying in again.
‘Certainly she gave it to us. It’s upstairs here in the loft. Mrs Lian long ago sent
someone to tell the steward that we’d got it. I suppose he was too lazy to make a
note of it at the time. It’s too bad that he should be making a fuss about it now.’
‘If she gave it to your mistress,’ said Jia Lian, ‘how is it that I don’t know anything
about it? I think you must have been hiding it from me.’
‘The mistress did tell you about it,’ said Patience. ‘You wanted to give it to someone
as a present, but the mistress wouldn’t let you. She had a terrible job persuading you
to let her keep it. Fancy your forgetting - and then having the nerve to accuse us of
hiding it from you! If we were going to start hiding things from you, we could do a bit
better than that! We have been given things ten times more valuable, but invariably
you have been told.’
Jia Lian looked down smilingly and reflected, then clapped his hands suddenly as he
remembered.
‘Why yes, of course. How stupid of me! I’m forgetting everything these days; No
wonder people get so cross with me. I’m not the man I was!’
‘It’s hardly surprising,’ said Faithful. ‘You have so much to do and so many people
to deal with. By the time you’ve had a couple of drinks, you can’t be expected to
remember very much!’
She got up to go. Jia Lian too rose to his feet.
‘Do stay a little longer. I want to ask you a favour.’
He turned rather crossly to one of the junior maids.
‘Can’t we have some better tea than this? Get some clean cover-cups and use some
of that tea we were given yesterday.’
He turned back to Faithful.
‘During these past few days, because of Her Old Ladyship’s birthday celebrations,
we’ve got through the last few thousand taels we had. Our house-rents and
land-rents aren’t due in until the ninth month. Until then we have nothing. Yet soon
we shall be having to buy presents for the Princess of Nan-an’s birthday, and there
are the presents we shall have to send to Her Grace on the Double Ninth and various
weddings and funerals to provide for. We need at least two or three thousand taels
to pay for these things. It would be difficult to borrow that much outside at present;
and as they say self-help is the best help, I am turning to you to ask if you would be
prepared, for all our sakes, to commit a very tiny little crime. Could you possibly look
out a few gold and silver things that Her Old Ladyship would not be likely to miss and
smuggle a boxful of them out to me enough for me to raise about a thousand taels
on - just to tide us over the next week or two? As soon as our money comes in I shall
redeem them and give them back to you. I promise you shan’t get into any trouble.’
Faithful smiled.
‘Nobody can say you aren’t ingenious. Whatever will you think of next?’
‘Look, I’m not just saying this to flatter you,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but though I know plenty
of other people who have a thousand taels’ worth of stuff in their keeping, they none
of them have your courage or intelligence. If I made a proposal like this to one of
them, I’d frighten the wits out of them. That’s why I turn to you. Better one stroke of
the big bell than a thousand tinkles on the little cymbal!’
At that moment one of the junior maids from Grandmother Jia’s apartment came in.
She seemed somewhat out of breath.
‘Her Old Ladyship wants you. I’ve been ages looking for you. I never thought you
would be here.’
Faithful hurried out after her. Jia Lian went inside to see Xi-feng.
Xi-feng had, as a matter of fact, been awake for some time. She had heard Jia Lian
make his request but, not liking to intervene, had remained lying where she was. She
knew that Faithful had left.
‘Well?’ she asked as Jia Lian entered. ‘Is it settled?’
‘Not quite,’ said Jia Lian, smiling. ‘As good as. I think if you were to go over and have
a word with her, it would tip the balance.’
‘It’s nothing to do with me, what you get up to,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Suppose she does
agree. Once you’ve got your hands on the money, you’ll like as not forget all your fine
promises and just hang on to her stuff. And what can she do then? Nothing. Then
suppose Grandmother finds out? Her confidence in me, that it has taken me all these
years to build up, will be completely shattered.’
‘Come on, be an angel!’ Jia Lian pleaded. ‘I promise you won’t regret it.’
‘Why, what will you give me?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Just say,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Anything you like.’
‘I know what to ask him for,’ said Patience, who had been near at hand listening.
‘You know you said earlier there was something you were planning to do that you
would need one or two hundred taels for: ask him to let you have two hundred taels
of the money he raises on pawn. That ought to suit both of you.’
‘Thank you for reminding me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Yes, I will.’
‘You are a terrible woman!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Never mind things to pawn, if you had a
mind to, you could probably let me have four or five thousand taels cash. All I’m
asking you to do is say a few words for me - and even for that you want to charge! No
wonder you and I -’
Xi-feng leaped to her feet angrily, breaking in before he could finish.
‘Well, what of it? The “four or five thousand taels” is my own money, isn’t it? I
haven’t cheated you Jias out of it. Just about everyone in this establishment
nowadays seem to spend their time discussing my shortcomings. It only needed you.
Well, they say that when a house is haunted it’s one’s own ghost that invites the
others in. Why do you always assume that any money I have must be Jia money? I
haven’t noticed that your family is so staggeringly rich. You’re not exactly millionaires,
are you? We Wangs could probably keep you going for the rest of your lives just with
the sweepings from our floor! I don’t want to boast, but just take a look at the
dowries that Aunt Wang and I brought with us when we came here and try matching
them, item for item, with things of your own.’
Jia Lian laughed.
‘How you do fly off the handle! I was only joking. You can have a hundred or two
hundred taels now if you need them. I couldn’t give you much more than that, but
that much at least I can manage. Take it now and speak to her when you’ve spent it.
How’s that for an offer?’
‘I’m not in that much of a hurry,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It isn’t pennies for a laying-out I’m
after.’
‘Bless my soul, what a passion you’re in!’ said Jia Lian.
Xi-feng laughed.
‘No, I’m not really. But I found what you said just now very wounding. The day after
tomorrow is the anniversary of Er-jie’s death. Since we were sisters for a little while, I
thought the least I could do was visit her grave and make her a few offerings. She
didn’t give us a son, it’s true, but we mustn’t “let the dust of those who have gone
before get into the eyes of those who follow”. That’s what I wanted the money for.’
Jia Lian said nothing for some moments. Xi-feng had effectively shut him up.
‘You are very thoughtful,’ he said eventually. Then, after another pause, ‘Since you
won’t need the money till the day after tomorrow, we may as well wait and see
whether or not Faithful will let us have the things. If she does, you will be able to
take what you want after I have pawned them.’
At that moment Brightie’s wife came hurrying in.
‘Well?’ Xi-feng asked her. ‘Is it settled?’
‘No,’ said Brightie’s wife. ‘Nothing doing. It’s as I said: unless we have your backing
for it, we shan’t get anywhere.’
‘What’s this?’ said Jia Lian.
‘Oh, nothing serious,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Brightie and his wife have a son who is
seventeen this year and not yet married and they wanted to get Lady Wang’s Sunset
for him. They haven’t done anything about it previously, because they didn’t know
what Lady Wang might have in mind for her. Now it seems that because Sunset has
had so much illness during the past year, Lady Wang has sent her back to her parents
and said they can choose a husband for her themselves. Brightie’s wife asked me if I
would speak to the parents on her behalf but I thought that as the families were so
obviously suited, her parents couldn’t possibly have any objection to the match and
that Brightie and his wife would be able to arrange it themselves. But it seems that I
was wrong.’
‘It doesn’t matter, does it?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Surely there are plenty of others as good
as Sunset they could get for him, or even better?’
‘That’s as may be, sir,’ said Brightie’s wife with a somewhat artificial smile, ‘but if
people see that we are not even good enough for the likes of them, it doesn’t do
much for our prestige. I took a lot of trouble choosing that girl for him and I hoped
that you and Mrs Lian would be so very kind as to settle the matter for us, for I know
you could do so if you wished. But Mrs Lian she said no, there was no need, they’d be
sure to agree. Well, I got a woman to speak to the parents for me, and now she’s just
come back from them with a flea in her ear. I don’t think there’s any objection as far
as the girl is concerned. I’ve sounded her out once or twice in the past and as far as I
could make out she would be quite willing. It’s that stupid old couple with their high
and mighty ideas that are the stumbling-block.’
These words were intended to put Jia Lian and Xi-feng on their mettle; but Xi-feng
could hardly take the initiative in her husband’s presence and watched Jia Lian in
silence to see what he would do, whilst Jia Lian for his part had too much on his mind
to be bothered with anything so trifling. He would probably have ignored it
altogether were it not for the fact that Brightie and his wife were rather special
servants. Xi-feng had brought them from her father’s house when she was married
and they had served her devotedly ever since. Jia Lian realized that to be refused
help now that they had openly requested it would be regarded by them as a very
great loss of face.
‘Well, it’s hardly a matter calling for so much palaver,’ he said impatiently. ‘Be on
your way now and stop worrying about it! I’ll send a couple of senior people
tomorrow with the betrothal presents to have a talk with her father and tell him that
I am sponsoring the match. If he still holds out against it, I’ll have him over and talk
to him myself.’
Brightie’s wife looked questioningly at Xi-feng. In answer to her look Xi-feng made a
barely perceptible movement with her lips, whereupon Brightie’s wife got down on
her knees and made Jia Lian a kotow.
‘It’s your mistress you should be kotowing to,’ said Jia Lian hurriedly. ‘Although I
shall be talking to her father, you’ll still have to persuade your mistress to send for
the mother and have a word with her, otherwise it will seem too much like coercion.
After all, you’ll want to be on speaking terms with your son’s in-laws after the boy is
married.’
‘If you are prepared to take so much trouble on their behalf, you surely don’t think
that I am going to stand idly by?’ said Xi-feng. ‘All right, Brightie’s wife, you’ve heard
what we are going to do for you: now I want you to do something for me. I want you
to ask your husband to chase after all the people I have lent money to and see to it
that all the loan accounts are cleared by the end of this year. Tell him I must have
every penny back, or he’ll be in trouble! My reputation is quite bad enough already. If
I go on lending money at interest for another year, people will be wanting to eat me
up alive.’
‘It isn’t like you to be so timid, Mrs Lian,’ said Brightie’s wife, smiling. ‘Who would
dare to criticize you? It seems such a shame, after the work we’ve put into this, to
call all the money in again.’
‘ I don’t want it for myself in any case,’ said Xi-feng; ‘it was a means of
supplementing the housekeeping, because without it our expenditure was so much
greater than our income. Mr Lian’s and my allowance for the month, including the
allowances for four maids, is less than twenty taels: barely enough to keep us going
for four or five days. If I hadn’t scraped together a bit of extra on the side, I don’t
know what sort of hovel we should have been living in by now. And so now I’ve got
myself a bad name. I’m a usurer. Very well, I’ll call it all in again and stop lending
money altogether. I can spend money as fast as anyone else - though how we are
supposed to manage if we just all sit back and spend without a thought in our heads
for the future I fail to understand. Lady Wang spent two months worrying about how
she was going to manage for Her Old Ladyship’s birthday. In the end I reminded her
about four or five boxes of big, useless bronze things in the rear upstairs store-room
and suggested that we should try pawning them. We did, and raised three hundred
taels, which was barely enough to tide her over the celebrations. And you know of
course about my chiming clock. I sold that for three hundred and sixty taels, but in
less than half a month every penny of it had gone into paying bills. Now it seems the
menfolk are running short and someone has had the bright idea of trying to get
something out of Her Old Ladyship. Another year like this and we shall be pawning
our jewellery and our clothes!’
Brightie’s wife laughed.
‘Well, I dare say every one of you ladies has enough jewellery to keep you all for
the rest of your lives, if she had a mind to pawn it.’
‘No doubt it’s silly of me,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but personally I could never bring myself to
live like that. - Oh, I must tell you,’ she said, changing the subject, ‘I had rather a
funny dream last night. Someone - I didn’t know who he was, though he looked
familiar - came and told me that Her Grace had sent him to ask me for a hundred
lengths of brocade. I said “Which Her Grace?”. He told me a name, but it was the
wrong one, so I refused. Then he came forward and tried to take the stuff from me by
force. That was when I woke up.’
‘That’s because your obligations to Her Grace are so much on your mind during the
daytime,’ said Brightie’s wife, laughing.
The words were barely out of her mouth when a messenger from the Palace was
announced - a little eunuch sent by Xia Bing-zhong, the eunuch Master of the
Bedchamber. Jia Lian frowned when he heard the announcement.
‘I wonder what it is this time? You’d have thought he’d had enough out of us
already this year.’
‘Make yourself scarce and let me speak to him,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If it’s only a little thing
he wants, we needn’t worry; but if it’s something big he’s after, I think I know how to
handle this.’
Jia Lian slipped into one of the side rooms at the back, while Xi-feng gave orders for
the little eunuch to be brought in. She made him sit down and accept a cup of tea
before inquiring about the purpose of his visit.
‘Daddy Xia saw a house today that he would very much like to buy, but he’s two
hundred taels short of the price they are asking. He sent me to ask you if you happen
to have one or two hundred taels on you you could let him have just for the time
being. He will pay you back in a day or two.’
‘Why talk of paying back?’ said Xi-feng genially. ‘We’ve got plenty of money, just
help yourselves. Why don’t we just say that if we are ever short of money, we’ll come
and borrow some from you.’
‘Oh, Daddy Xia also told me to tell you that he still hasn’t paid back the twelve
hundred taels he owes you from the last two times, but he says he will definitely pay
it all back to you by the New Year.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Your Daddy Xia is an old fuss-pot, tell him. He really shouldn’t worry his head over
such trifles. I hope he won’t think I am complaining, but if everyone were as
scrupulous as he is about paying back the money they owe us, we should be
millionaires. About this money he wants now, though: I wonder if I have got that
much ready cash to give him. He’s certainly very welcome to it if I have.’
She called Brightie’s wife to her.
‘Pop out and see if you can get two hundred taels for me, will you? It doesn’t
matter where from.’
Brightie’s wife at once caught on to the little game her mistress was playing.
‘I’ve just been trying to get hold of some,’ she said brightly. ‘That’s why I’m here. I
couldn’t get any outside, so I thought you might have some.’
‘You people aren’t very resourceful,’ said Xi-feng crossly. ‘Why is it that when you
want money you always have to fall back on me?’
She called Patience in.
‘Patience, get out my two gold necklaces and see if you can pawn them for four
hundred taels.’
Patience left the room and came back presently with an embroidered box in which
were two magnificent collars of jewellery, every bit as fine as any that could be found
in the Palace, each carefully wrapped up in a piece of silk brocade. One of them was
made of gold wire and pearls the size of lotus-seeds; the other was of
kingfisher-feathers and gold, studded with precious stones. She went off with these
and returned some time later with the four hundred taels, half of which Xi-feng
wrapped up for the little eunuch, while the other half she handed over to Brightie’s
wife to buy presents for the Mid-Autumn festival with.
The little eunuch now took his leave. Xi-feng sent someone to carry the money for
him as far as the main gate.
‘These people really are a pest!’ said Jia Lian emerging from his hiding-place. ‘There
seems to be no end to their borrowing.’
‘Just as I’d been telling you about my dream,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Talk of the devil!’
‘Yesterday it was Chamberlain Zhou,’ said Jia Lian. ‘The first thing he said when he
opened his mouth was could I lend him a thousand taels. Because I hesitated a bit
before saying yes, he started looking huffy. I can see us making any number of
enemies this way. What we need right now is a windfall of forty or fifty thousand
taels!’
Patience came in to help Xi-feng wash and change preparatory to going over to wait
on Grandmother Jia at dinner. Jia Lian went off to his outside study. He had barely got
there when Lin Zhi-xiao came hurrying in, evidently bursting with some news. When
Jia Lian asked him what it was, he said that Jia Yu-cun bad been demoted.
‘I don’t know what it was for,’ he said. ‘It may not be true, in any case.’
‘Even if it’s not,’ said Jia Lian, ‘he’s sure to get thrown out of that job sooner or later.
We’d be well advised to have as little to do with him as possible.’
‘I’m sure you’re right, sir,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘But that’s easier said than done. Sir She
is on very good terms with him, and Sir Zheng likes him. Everyone knows that he is a
regular visitor here.’
‘Well, I suppose as long as we don’t get involved in any of his schemes it shouldn’t
matter,’ said Jia Lian. ‘You’d better go and make some more inquiries. Find out if he
really has been demoted, and if so, what for.’
Lin Zhi-xiao said he would do so, but showed no inclination to leave. Instead he sat
down in a chair and began talking to Jia Lian about this and that. Presently they got
on to the subject of the household’s financial difficulties. Lin Zhi-xiao took the
opportunity of airing his own idea of a solution.
‘We’ve got too big a staff,’ he said. ‘We ought to pick a day when there’s no other
business on hand and ask Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng if we can’t give some of
those older servants who are a bit past it now an honourable discharge. It would be a
kindness to them, because they’ve all got little jobs of their own to fall back on, and
it would mean a big saving for us in the amount we have to spend every year on
wages and keep. And there’s another thing: there are far too many maids. As the
proverb says, “The times get worse but never better.” It’s no good trying to live in
the style we used to keep up twenty or thirty years ago. If every apartment which in
the past used to employ eight girls were now to employ six and those which used to
employ four girls were to make do with two, the saving in wages and keep would be
enormous. Most of those girls are in any case old enough now to be married. If we
pair them off now with our boys, before we know where we are they will be breeding
new servants for us.’
‘I’m entirely in agreement with you,’ said Jia Lian. ‘The trouble is that as Sir Zheng
has only just got back, he doesn’t want to be bothered with anything yet. At the
moment even quite important matters are having to be shelved. We’d never get him
to discuss a small domestic matter like this. A couple of days ago an official
marriage-broker came round here with all her credentials, wanting to arrange a
match between her client’s son and one of our young ladies, but Lady Wang said that
Sir Zheng was so happy to be home again with his family all around him - she says
he’s hardly stopped talking about “family togetherness” since the day he got back -
that she felt sure it would upset him to have to talk about the girls getting married
and leaving home, and she forbade anyone to mention it to him.’
‘Why, I’m sure that’s as it should be,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘Her Ladyship is a very
thoughtful lady.’
‘Talking of marriage-brokers, that reminds me,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Our Brightie’s boy
wants to marry Sunset from Her Ladyship’s room and Brightie’s wife has been asking
me if I would arrange it for them. It seems to me that it’s hardly important enough
for that. Could one of you go round and see the girl’s father for me? You could tell
him that it has my approval.’
Lin Zhi-xiao agreed to do so, but without much enthusiasm. After a longish pause he
added,
‘I think if I was you, sir, I wouldn’t get myself involved. That boy of Brightie’s is only
a lad, but already he’s drinking too much and gambling and getting up to all sorts of
capers. I know they’re only slaves, but marriage is for a lifetime, after all. I haven’t
seen Sunset myself for some years, but by all accounts she’s grown up into a very
presentable young woman. It would seem a pity to throw her away on the likes of
him.’
‘Oh, so Brightie’s boy has been misbehaving, has he?’ said Jia Lian. ‘It seems to me
that it’s not a wife he needs but a thundering good hiding. I think you’d better give
him one to get on with and then lock him up and ask his parents what they propose
to do about him.’
Lin Zhi-xiao laughed.
‘We don’t have to do that now, surely? Next time he gives trouble, we’ll let you
know and you can deal with him then. It doesn’t seem quite the time to tackle him
about it now.’
Jia Lian made no reply and Lin Zhi-xiao shortly afterwards got up and left.
That evening Xi-feng summoned Sunset’s mother to her in order to propose the
marriage with Brightie’s son. Sunset’s mother had all along been opposed to it, but it
was so flattering to have Xi-feng talking to her like this, woman to woman, that she
found herself agreeing to everything in spite of her?self. When, some time after she
had left, Jia Lian returned, Xi-feng asked whether he had spoken yet to the father.
‘No, I haven’t,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I was going to talk to him about it, but then I heard
that that boy of Brightie’s is turning out a thoroughly bad lot, so I put it off. If what
they told me about him is true, I think we ought to give him a good, sharp lesson or
two before we set about getting a wife for him.’
‘None of us Wangs seem to find much favour with you people nowadays,’ said
Xi-feng frostily. ‘I suppose since I don’t meet with your approval, it’s hardly surprising
that you should be dissatisfied with my servants. I’ve already spoken to her mother
about it and she was overjoyed. What am I supposed to do now? Call her in again
and tell her it’s all off?’
‘No, no,’ said Jia Lian. ‘If you’ve already arranged it with her mother, it will have to
stand. But you’ll have to have a word with Brightie tomorrow and tell him to do
something about that boy.’
Our narrative moves at this point to the unfortunate object of these manoeuvrings.
*
When, some days previous to this, Lady Wang sent Sunset back home to her parents,
it was on the express understanding that they might choose for her whatever
son-in-law they wished. Brightie’s visits to her parents filled Sunset with foreboding.
Her union with Jia Huan had not yet been approved, but she had long since given her
heart to him and knew that she could never be happy with Brightie’s son. When,
shortly after that, she learned that Brightie’s son was a drunkard and a gambler and
hideously ugly into the bargain, she became even more alarmed. The fear that
Brightie and his wife might use their influence with Xi-feng to force her parents to
accept the match finally made her so frantic that, on the evening of the day on which
these other events took place, she told her younger sister, Moonrise, to go in secret
to Aunt Zhao and try to find out exactly what was happening.
Now Aunt Zhao had always got on well with Sunset and had been longing for the day
when Sunset could become Jia Huan’s concubine, thus providing her at the same
time with an ally. It was an unexpected blow to her when Sunset was sent back home
to her parents, and she was constantly urging Jia Huan to go and ask Lady Wang if he
might have her for himself; but partly because Jia Huan was too bashful to open his
mouth about it, and partly because he did not in any case care about her very much
(after all, he thought, she was only a maid; there would be plenty even better than
her in the future) he hung back, hoping that the matter would eventually be dropped.
But Aunt Zhao did not give up so easily, and the night that Sunset sent her younger
sister to see her she tried to enlist Jia Zheng’s support. Jia Zheng was unenthusiastic.
‘What’s the hurry?’ he said. ‘Wait until the boys have spent another year or two at
their studies, it will be soon enough then. I’ve already got my eye on a couple of girls,
one for Bao-yu and one for Huan, but I think they are too young yet. I am afraid that
if they had the girls now, it would get in the way of their studies. You can speak to me
about this again in a year or two’s time.’
Aunt Zhao would have gone on trying, but just at that moment there was a loud
crash outside which made them both jump.
You will have to look at the next chapter, however, in order to find out what caused
it.
CHAPTER 73

A half-witted servant-girl picks up a
highly embarrassing object
And an easy-going young mistress refuses
to inquire into a theft



As we were saying at the end of the last chapter, Aunt Zhao and Jia Zheng were
interrupted in the midst of their dis?cussion by a sudden crash. The maids, when
questioned, said that it had been caused by an outer casement of one of the
windows falling. It could not have been properly fastened and must have slipped its
catch. After first roundly cursing them, Aunt Zhao went outside with them to
supervise its replacement. When she came in again, she helped Jia Zheng to settle
down for the night. And so we leave them.
*
Meanwhile, over at Green Delights, Bao-yu had just gone to bed. The maids were
themselves on the point of doing so when a sudden knocking was heard at the
courtyard gate. The old woman who opened it recognized the caller as a maid of
Aunt Zhao’s called Magpie, and asked her what she wanted; but instead of answering,
the girl pushed past her and rushed straight inside. She found Bao-yu already lying
down, but engaged in bantering conversation with Skybright and a couple of other
maids who were sitting on the edge of his bed.
     ‘What’s the matter?’ they asked when they saw who their visitor was. ‘What
brings you out at this hour?’
     ‘I’ve come to warn you,’ said Magpie, addressing herself in an urgent whisper to
Bao-yu. ‘I heard my mistress just now jabbering to Sir Zheng about something, and
though I couldn’t make out what they were talking about, I heard him say “Bao-yu” a
couple of times. I thought I’d better put you on your guard in case he asks to see you
tomorrow about anything.’
     She turned and hurried out again as soon as she had finished speaking. Aroma
told someone to run after her and ask her to stay for a cup of tea, but she was afraid
of being shut inside the Garden when they closed the gate, and insisted on going
back immediately.
     Bao-yu knew that in Aunt Zhao’s twisted imagination he was regarded as an
enemy, and though he did not know what she had said, the mere fact that she had
been talking about him was enough to make him feel uncomfortable all over, much
as Monkey did when he heard Tripitaka reciting the spell for tightening the iron band
round his head. After giving the matter some thought, he concluded that the only
practical way in which he could prepare himself for the morrow would be by revising
his texts. Should his father take it into his head to test him, he reasoned, then if only
he could be word-perfect in his texts, it would not be so difficult to bluff his way
through whatever else he might ask him. Having made the decision, he hurriedly
threw a gown over his shoulders and prepared to begin some revision, bitterly
regretting that Jia Zheng’s silence on the subject of lessons since his last return from
duty had lulled him into a false sense of security.
      ‘I ought to have had more sense,’ he told himself. ‘One really ought to do a little
bit every day, to keep in practice.’
      He began to reckon up how much he could still recite from memory. He found
that there was little more than The Great Learning, The Doctrine of the Mean and
the two halves of the Analects that he could be absolutely sure of. The first half of
Mencius he knew reasonably well, but certainly not well enough to be able to carry
on from any sentence given him at random. The second half was virtually terra
incognita. Of the Five Classics he was fairly familiar with the Poetry Classic because
he was frequently having to read bits of it in connection with his own versifying.
Though far from word-perfect, he probably knew it well enough to scrape through a
test. He could not remember any of the other classics at all; but fortunately his father
had so far never asked him to study them, so probably it would not matter. When it
came to Old Style Prose, the case was rather different. Over the past few years he
had read extracts from the Zuo, Gong-yang and Gu-liang commentaries on the Spring
and Autumn Annals and various Han and Tang pieces, but he had only dipped into
them as the fancy took him; he had not done any serious work on them. There was
certainly no question of his being able to remember them. There was even less
likelihood of his being able to pass muster on the Examination Essay. He had always
detested this style of writing in any case. The Sage himself didn’t write that way, he
argued, so how could one hope to expound the inner meaning of his teachings
through such a medium? It was no more than a device used by vulgar
fortune-seekers for starting themselves off on the golden road to success. Before he
left, Jia Zheng had selected a hundred of these essays for him to read; but Bao-yu had
only glanced at them occasionally, reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there as
some particularly felicitous expression or the extrava?gance, humour or melancholy
of the writer happened to catch his attention. He had never settled down to the
serious analytical examination of even a single essay.
      He began to revise; but the trouble was that whatever he revised now, he was
sure to be asked about something else next day, and the whole night would not be
long enough to revise everything. It soon became apparent that all he was
succeeding in doing was getting himself into an even worse state of nerves than he
had been in to begin with and, while studying to no purpose himself, preventing a
whole roomful of girls from sleeping as well.
      Aroma and the other senior maids could at least occupy themselves by trimming
his lamp, pouring him cups of tea and so forth; but the younger ones could neither
go to bed nor find any employment to keep themselves awake, and sat about the
place, drooping and nodding in various attitudes of fatigue. Skybright became
indignant.
      ‘Lazy little wretches! You sleep all day as it is. Just for once in your lives you are
asked to stay up late, and look at you! If you don’t liven yourselves up a bit, I shall
come and stick pins in you all!’
      As she said this, there was a loud bang from the outer room. It turned out to
have been caused by a little maid who had dozed off while sitting on the kang and in
doing so had bumped her head against the partition. Waking with a start just as
Skybright was uttering this threat, she assumed that the bump on the head she had
just received must have been dealt her by Skybright. To the great amusement of the
other girls she began tearfully begging her for mercy.
      ‘Oh no! Please, Skybright! I promise I won’t do it again!’
      ‘Don’t punish her,’ Bao-yu called out. ‘You ought to allow those younger ones to
go to bed. And you older ones too - you don’t all need to stay up. You should be
taking it in turns to get some sleep.’
      ‘Little ancestor!’ said Aroma exasperatedly. ‘You get on with your work! Just for
this one night try to concentrate all your energies on studying. Once you’ve got over
this hurdle; you can make what other arrangements you like!’
     She sounded so earnest that for the next few minutes Bao-yu did in fact
concentrate on his revision. Musk handed him a cup of tea to moisten his lips with
while he recited. In taking it from her he noticed that she had only a short tunic on
over her pantaloons.
     ‘It gets very cold at this time of night,’ he said. ‘You really ought to put
something else on.’
     Musk smiled grimly and pointed at his book.
     ‘Just forget about me for a while, could you? Get your mind fastened on this!’
     Hardly had she finished saying this than Parfumée - or Aventurin’ as Bao-yu now
called her - came running in from outside in a panic.
     ‘Oh God! A man’s just jumped down from the wall!’
     ‘Where? Where?’ cried the others, and began shouting for the older servants to
go and look.
     To Skybright this scare came as a blessing in disguise. Observing what heavy
weather Bao-yu was making of his revision and foreseeing that if he wore himself out
by staying up all night he would be in no condition for facing his ordeal in the
morning, she had been casting about desperately for some means of rescuing him
from it altogether. This panic about an intruder gave her an idea.
      ‘Why don’t you take advantage of this to get off tomorrow?’ she asked him. ‘Tell
them that the shock has made you ill.’
      This was a suggestion after Bao-yu’s own heart. He had the watch called and
ordered them to light their lanterns and make a thorough search. But no intruder
could be found.
      ‘I expect one of you young ladies had to go out for something in the dark and
being still half-asleep, took the bough of a tree moving in the wind for a man,’ they
said.
      ‘Nonsense!’ said Skybright. ‘You only say that as an excuse, because you haven’t
been keeping watch properly and you’re afraid of getting into trouble. It wasn’t only
one of us who saw him; a whole lot of us did; and Bao-yu was with us. The shock of it
has made him quite ill. His face looks terrible and he’s burning hot all over. I shall be
going over to Her Ladyship’s presently to get him a sedative. She’s sure to ask me
what has upset him. What am I supposed to tell her? That he took fright from looking
at a tree?’
      This seemed to scare the women, for they made no reply but hurried off again
to continue their search. Meanwhile Skybright and Aventurin went off to ask for
some pills, deliberately making as big a fuss as possible to make sure that everyone
knew that Bao-yu had been taken ill as a result of seeing something alarming in the
Garden. Lady Wang sent someone to fetch the medicine for the two girls and gave
orders for the members of the watch to make a full investigation. She was
particularly anxious that the pages from the inner gate who did night duty at the
point nearest to the Garden should be subjected to careful questioning. As a result of
these orders there was a general hubbub in the Garden throughout all the rest of
that night: lanterns and torches bobbing about and people scurrying to and fro in all
directions. At four o’clock in the morning the stewards and stewardesses were
summoned from their quarters and ordered to investigate all those servants of either
sex who had been on night duty in the mansion.
     When Grandmother Jia learned that Bao-yu was suffering from shock, she
wanted to know why. The others were obliged to tell her.
     ‘I didn’t expect a thing like this to happen,’ she said. ‘It would be bad enough if
the people who are supposed to be keeping us safe at night were merely being
careless. What worries me is the thought that some of them may be criminals
themselves!’
     Lady Xing and You-shi had not long since arrived for their morning duty, and Li
Wan, Xi-feng and the girls were also there in attendance. None of them dared say
anything. In the end it was Tan-chun who, smiling, stepped forwards and broke the
silence.

       ‘It’s because Cousin Feng hasn’t been very well during these last few months,’
she said. ‘The servants in the Garden have got much more careless than they used to
be. At first it was only once in a while: three or four doing night duty on the same
shift getting together for a little game of dice or cards to keep themselves awake. But
gradually they became more reckless, until now there are regular little card-schools
with their own bankers and forty or fifty strings of cash changing hands at a sitting. A
fortnight ago it even reached a point where a fight broke out over the cards.’
       ‘If you knew this at the time, why didn’t you tell anyone?’ said Grandmother Jia
with some asperity.
       ‘I didn’t tell Mother because I knew she was busy and not feeling very well,’ said
Tan-chun. ‘I did tell sister-in-law though, and the stewardesses and the women were
given several warnings. As a matter of fact, I think they have been a bit more careful
since then.’
       ‘You’re only a child,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You don’t know how serious this is.
You think that gambling is a trifling matter and that the only thing to be feared from
it is an occasional quarrel. But where there is gambling, there is probably drinking as
well; and if there is drinking, probably gates are being left unlocked so that people
can slip out to buy things; and when that happens, before you know where you are
they will be letting thieves in - the easiest thing in the world when it is dark and there
are so few people about. And then - Heaven help us! - with only you girls living there
and the maids and women who wait on you - some of them no better than they
should be, I dare say - anything could happen. There are things worse than burglary,
the mere suspicion of which could have the direst consequences for all of you. No,
this is not a matter to be dismissed so airily!’
      After such a snub, Tan-chun could only sit down again in silence.
      Xi-feng was still far from well and her usual ebullience was very much in
abeyance, but she managed to summon up some energy when she saw how
seriously the old lady was displeased. She made a point of observing how
unfortunate it was that such things ‘had to happen’ when she was ill, then, sending
for Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and three of the other principal stewardesses, she subjected
them to a thorough dressing-down in Grandmother Jia’s and everyone else’s
presence. When Xi-feng had finished with them, Grandmother Jia ordered them to
find out who the chief organizers were and all the others who had been taking part in
the gambling. She em?powered them to offer rewards for information and to punish
those who withheld it.
     Seeing Grandmother Jia so angry, the stewardesses dared not attempt to cover
up for their own kinswomen and friends, of whom there were several among the
older women of the watch. Going at once into the Garden, they summoned all the
women together and proceeded to grill them, one by one, without distinction of
persons. They met at first with a certain amount of resistance, but in the end, as will
almost invariably happen when the questioning is sufficiently patient and persistent,
the waters subsided and the rocks began to appear. By the time they had finished
their interrogations it was established that there were three principal organizers,
eight subsidiary ones, and a score or more gamblers who had availed themselves of
their services. All of these were taken at once to Grandmother Jia’s place, and were
soon to be observed kneeling down in rows in her courtyard, knocking their heads
upon the pavement and begging for mercy.
     Grandmother Jia began by asking for the names of the three principal organizers
and the amounts of money in their ‘banks’. Of the three it turned out that one was a
cousin on the mother’s side of Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, one a younger sister of Cook Liu,
and the other one Ying-chun’s nurse. The other eight organizers, who had operated
on a smaller scale, were also named, but their identities need not concern us.
Grandmother Jia ordered all the dice and playing-cards to be collected together and
burnt. The money from the banks she ordered to be confiscated and divided up
among the other servants. She sentenced the principal offenders to receive forty
strokes of the heavy bamboo, to be dismissed, and never to be employed by the
family again. The others were to receive twenty strokes, lose three months’ pay, and
in future be employed in cleaning out the latrines. After passing these sentences, she
formally reprimanded Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife for having permitted such things to happen.
      Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, let down by her own relation and twice rebuked in public,
was not the only person present to feel humiliated. Ying-chun, sitting among the
other cousins next to Grandmother Jia, felt equally humiliated when it was revealed
that her own nurse was one of the principal offenders. Dai-yu, Bao-chai and Tan-chun
felt sorry for her and rose to intercede for the old woman.
      ‘Couldn’t you, for Ying-chun’s sake, let her off this once?’ they pleaded. ‘She
isn’t an habitual gambler. It’s just that once in a while she gets carried away.
      ‘You none of you know what you are talking about,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘These old nannies are all the same. They think that because they suckled you when
you were babies it entitles them to special treatment now. They’re worse trouble
than all the other servants put together, because whenever they have done wrong
they think they can always get you to cover up for them. I know. I have had a lot of
experience of these people. I need to make an example of one of them, and this one
will do very well. You leave this to me. I know what I am doing.’
      The three girls were obliged to let the matter drop.
      Soon it was time for the old lady’s siesta and all of those present withdrew. But
because they knew she was angry, they did not all go back to their own apartments.
Some of them waited around so as to be on hand when she had finished resting.
You-shi called in at Xi-feng’s place to chat, but finding Xi-feng too much out of sorts
for conversation, went into the Garden to talk to Li Wan and the girls. Lady Xing, too,
after sitting for a while at Lady Wang’s place, went off to take a walk in the Garden.
She had got no farther than the Garden gate, however, when one of the junior maids
from Grandmother Jia’s apartment, a girl called Simple, almost bumped into her. The
girl was walking along chuckling delightedly to herself, intent on some brightly
coloured object. Because she was so intent on what she was holding, she had not
seen Lady Xing coming towards her and only looked up and checked herself when
she was almost upon her.
‘Well now, Simple,’ said Lady Xing, ‘you seem very pleased with yourself. What
marvellous thing have you got there? Let me have a look.’
Simple, just turned fourteen, had only recently been selected to help with the rough
work in Grandmother Jia’s apartment. She had a hefty body, a broad face and an
enormous pair of feet. A willing and effective worker in the heavier sort of jobs
requiring no intelligence, she was nevertheless so stupid as to be almost half-witted
and as ignorant and innocent almost as the day she was born. Much of what she said
was uninten?tionally amusing. Grandmother Jia was endlessly diverted by her and
always allowed her mistakes to go unreproved. It was she who had given her the
name ‘Simple’. When Simple had no work to do, she would often go into the Garden
to play. On this occasion she had gone into the Garden to look for crickets behind the
rocks of the artificial mountain just inside the gate, and in doing so, had come upon a
beautifully embroidered purse. The design embroidered on it consisted not of the
usual birds and flowers, but on one side of a pair of naked human figures locked
together in an embrace and on the other of some writing. Simple was too innocent
to under?stand what the naked couple were up to. After giving the matter some
thought, she had decided that they must be either two demons fighting or two
people wrestling, but could not make up her mind which of these was the correct
interpretation. She was on her way, chuckling delightedly over her find, to ask
Grandmother Jia’s opinion on the matter when she nearly ran into Lady Xing.
‘I think you’ve said the right word, Your Ladyship,’ said Simple. ‘It is a marvellous
thing. You just look!’
Lady Xing took the proffered bag. She examined the picture on it with a start.
‘Where did you find this?’ she asked, seizing Simple roughly by the arm.
‘I found it behind the rocks,’ said Simple, ‘when I was looking for crickets.’
‘Don’t tell anyone else about this,’ said Lady Xing. ‘This is a bad thing, Simple. If you
weren’t such a simpleton, they would give you a beating just for touching it. Don’t
ever say a word about it to anyone else!’
Simple turned pale with fright.
‘No, no, I won’t.’
She made Lady Xing a kotow and went off, round-eyed, with her mouth gaping
foolishly open.
Lady Xing looked around her. There were only maids in sight, and she obviously could
not give the embroidered purse to one of them, so she stuffed it up her sleeve. She
was very puzzled to think where it could have come from; but no trace of what she
felt was allowed to show itself on her face as she made her way through the Garden
towards Ying-chun’s apartment.
Ying-chun was still brooding disconsolately over her nurse’s guilt when her mother’s
arrival was announced. She hurried out to welcome her. As soon as Lady Xing was
seated and had been given tea, she began laying into her.
‘You’re not a child now. If you knew your nurse was doing this sort of thing, for
Heaven’s sake why couldn’t you have spoken to her about it? Other people’s nurses
don’t seem to get into trouble, why does it have to be yours? I don’t understand
you!’
Ying-chun hung her head and fiddled with her sash. It was some time before she
answered.
‘I did speak to her about it, on two occasions, but she wouldn’t listen to me. What
could I do? She’s my nurse. She’s supposed to tell me what to do, not the other way
round.’
‘Rubbish!’ said Lady Xing. ‘She’s entitled to tell you off if you’ve done something
wrong, but in a case like this where she was the guilty one, it was up to you to
behave towards her like a mistress. Then, if she still wouldn’t obey you, you ought to
have come and told me. As it is, you have let things slide until everyone knows about
it and all the rest of us are involved in the disgrace. I just don’t know what you think
you are at. Incidentally, if she was banker to a card-school, she must have had to get
money from somewhere to start it with. I shouldn’t be a bit surprised to find that
she’d talked you into lending her clothes or jewellery that she could pawn in order to
raise her capital. You’re such a soft, flabby creature, you’d be just as likely as not to
lend them to her. Well all I can say is, if she has and you don’t get them back from her,
it’s no good coming to me for the money, for I’ve none to give you; so what you will
do when festival time comes and you need your things I can’t imagine.’
Ying-chun continued to hang her head and say nothing. Lady Xing found her
unresponsiveness provoking.
‘Your mother was one of Sir She’s chamber-wives,’ she said, ‘and your Cousin Tan’s
mother was a chamber-wife as well, so you and she had the same sort of start in life.
As a matter of fact your mother was ten times better than that Zhao woman, so you
ought by rights to be better than your Cousin Tan. But you’re not. You’re not her
equal in any single respect. I don’t know, I’d have been better off without any
children at all. Those I have only make me look ridiculous.’
‘Mrs Lian is here,’ one of the servants announced.
‘Huh!’ said Lady Xing scornfully; and then again, ‘Huh!’
‘Tell her to go back home and take care of her illness,’ she said to the waiting
servant. ‘Tell her I have no need of her services.’
As that servant went out, another one, who had been sent to Grandmother Jia’s
place to act as a look-out, came in to report that the old lady was now awake. Lady
Xing got up to go. Ying-chun saw her out as far as the courtyard gate.
‘There you are!’ said Tangerine when Ying-chun got back. ‘When I told you the
other day that that pearl-and-gold phoenix had disappeared, you wouldn’t even ask
about it. I told you that Nannie had probably nicked it to pawn, but you wouldn’t
believe me. You said, “I expect Chess is looking after it.” Well, I asked Chess, because
although she is in, she is still perfectly clear in her mind, and she said, “No, I haven’t
touched it. It ought still to be in the casket on the bookshelf, ready for wearing at the
Mid-Autumn festival.” Now why don’t you send someone to Nannie right away and
ask her what she’s done with it?’
‘There’s no need to ask,’ said Ying-chun. ‘It’s perfectly obvious that she took it
because she was temporarily out of cash and needed the money from it to tide her
over. She quietly removed it when no one was looking, and I assumed that after a
few days had gone by, when she was in funds again, she would redeem it and quietly
slip it back again. I expect she forgot. In any case, there’s not much point in asking
her after what has happened today.’
‘She never forgot!’ said Tangerine. ‘She knew from past experience that you’d
never do anything, that’s why she didn’t put it back. I think I know what to do,
though. I’ll go and tell Mrs Lian about it, and either she’ll ask Nannie about it herself,
or better still, she’ll send someone with a few strings of cash round to the pawnshop
and get it back for you straight away.’
‘You’ll do no such thing!’ said Ying-chun. ‘Much better leave well alone. I’d rather
do without the thing than stir up a lot more trouble.’
‘Why are you so feeble?’ said Tangerine exasperatedly. ‘All this “saving trouble”!
One of these days they’ll carry you off with the loot! I’m going, anyway.’
She began to do so. Ying-chun said nothing and made no attempt to prevent her.
Unknown to them both, however, Zhu-er’s wife - the daughter-in-law of the old nurse
they were talking about - had all this time been listening outside the door. She had
come intending to ask Ying-chun to put in a plea for her mother-in-law, but held back
when she heard Ying-chun and Tangerine discussing the pearl-and-gold phoenix.
Because Ying-chun was so weak and unassertive, Zhu-er’s wife would not normally
have regarded the discovery by her of one of her mother-in-law’s depredations as a
matter of very much consequence; but when she heard Tangerine insisting that
Xi-feng should be informed, she could see that unless something were done to
prevent this, the consequences could be very serious indeed. At this point, therefore,
she hurried in to try and stop her.
‘Now, now, Miss Tangerine,’ she said, smiling rather unnaturally, ‘don’t go making
trouble! Our old missus was a bit silly about that pearl-and-gold phoenix, I will admit.
She’d lost a bit at the cards and couldn’t recoup, so she took it as a loan. Naturally
she never expected that all this trouble would break out before she’d had a chance to
put it back. But be that as it may, it’s the mistress’s property, and we’ve no intention
of forgetting about it. Sooner or later we fully intend to redeem it for her. I’d hardly
be here now if we didn’t, would I? I’ve come to ask the mistress, for the sake of the
milk she sucked from her as a baby, to go to Her Old Ladyship and plead with her for
our old missus.’
‘My dear good woman,’ said Ying-chun, ‘if that is what you are hoping for, then the
sooner you disabuse yourself of that hope the better. I am not going to plead for your
mother?in-law. You can wait from now until this time next year if you like, but I will
still not do it. Miss Bao and Miss Lin and the others have tried already and Her Old
Ladyship refused to listen to them. She’s even less likely to listen to me on my own. I
have already put up with enough humiliation for one day; I have no intention of
going to look for more.’
‘Whether or not you return that phoenix is one thing and whether or not the
mistress goes to plead for your mother-in-law is another,’ said Tangerine. ‘Don’t try to
confuse the issue. I hope you’re not suggesting that if the mistress doesn’t do what
you ask for your mother-in-law, you won’t redeem the phoenix? I think you ought to
redeem the phoenix first and start talking about that other matter after you have
brought it back.’
Ying-chun’s refusal and Tangerine’s sharp rebuke put Zhu?-er’s wife out of
countenance and left her momentarily at a loss for words, but she quickly found her
tongue again and, as if openly contemptuous of Ying-chun’s easy-going nature, began
taking noisy issue with Tangerine in her mistress’s presence.
‘Don’t be so high and mighty, Miss Tangerine! If you look around at the other
apartments in this household, you’ll find that there isn’t a single one in which the
nannies don’t take some advantage of their position to get a few perks. I don’t see
why only in our case you should be so pernickety. If you are a bit light-fingered, of
course, that’s another matter! Ever since Miss Xing came to live with us, Lady Xing
has insisted on a tad a month being stopped out of her allowance to help pay for her
mother. That means that though we now have two mistresses here in the place of
one - with all the extra expenses that that entails - we are having to manage on less
money a month instead of more. It’s hardly surprising that the mistresses are always
running short. And when they do, who is it that steps in and pays? We do. One way
and another, we must have paid out at least thirty taels by now, and from what I can
see, it was money down the drain.’
‘Thirty taels?’ said Tangerine indignantly. ‘How do you make that out? Just tell me
one or two of the things the mistress is supposed to have asked you for.’
Ying-chun had been made uneasy by the open reference to her mother’s meanness.
‘Now that’s enough!’ she told the woman. ‘If you can’t give the phoenix back, you
can’t. There’s no need to go dragging all these other matters into it and shouting
them around for everyone else to hear. I don’t want the thing, anyway. If mother asks
me about it, I shall tell her I’ve lost it. At least you won’t have anything to worry
about, so you might just as well go away and rest. What’s the point of making all this
fuss?’
She told Tangerine to pour her some tea. Tangerine was both angry and alarmed.
It’s all very well for you to take that way out, miss, but what about us? Not content
with depriving you of your gold phoenix, this woman is now pretending that you’ve
been spending their money and proposing to write off the phoenix to offset what
they’re supposed to have given you. If Lady Xing hears that and asks how you came
to be spending so much, it’s we servants who will take the blame. It isn’t fair!’
She burst into tears. Chess, who, as she lay ill in bed, had been listening with growing
impatience to what the others were saying, could now contain herself no longer.
Getting out of bed, she dragged herself over to take Tangerine’s part in the argument.
Ying-chun, finding that her single attempt at ending it had failed, picked up a volume
of Tai-shang’s Heavenly Rewards and Punishments and began to read.
While Zhu-er’s wife and the two maids were still at it hammer and tongs, Bao-chai,
Dai-yu, Bao-qin and Tan-chun arrived. Concerned that Ying-chun might still be feeling
distressed about her nurse, they had met together by prearrangement and come
over to try and cheer her up. Sounds of the wrangling going on inside were distinctly
audible as they entered her courtyard. Tan-chun walked over and, peeping through
the window, saw Ying-chun half-reclining on the day-bed reading a book, oblivious to
the noisy argu?ment that was going on only a few feet away from her. She laughed.
Just at that moment two junior maids raised the portiere for the visitors and
announced their arrival.
At once Ying-chun put her book down and rose to welcome them. The sight of these
newcomers - particularly as Tan-chun was one of them - caused the woman to stop of
her own accord and she took the opportunity of slipping quietly outside.
‘Who was that talking in here just now?’ said Tan-chun as she took a seat. ‘It
sounded as if someone was having an argument.’
‘Oh, nothing,’ said Ying-chun, pleasantly. ‘Probably only the servants making their
usual fuss about nothing. Certainly not anything worth inquiring about.’
‘I’m sure I heard something about a “golden phoenix” just now,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I
distinctly heard someone say, “When she’s short of money, she always asks us
servants for some.” When who’s short of money? Not you, Ying, surely? You don’t ask
the servants for money, do you?’
‘You’re absolutely right, miss, she most certainly does not,’ said Chess and
Tangerine indignantly.
Tan-chun smiled.
‘Well, Ying, if it wasn’t you the woman I heard was talking about, perhaps it was me?
You’d better call her inside again and let me ask her.’
‘Now you’re being ridiculous,’ said Ying-chun, laughing. ‘Why be like this? It has
absolutely nothing to do with you.’
‘There you are wrong,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You and I are in the same boat. Our
circumstances are very similar. What she says affects me as much as it does you. It
would be just the same if you were to hear someone at my place complaining about
me. You would feel almost as though you were being criticized yourself. As mistresses,
you and I are above talking to servants about the petty cash. We may ask them for
things sometimes, as and when we require them, but that is another matter. Tell me,
though: how did a “pearl-and-gold phoenix” come to be mixed up in this discussion?’
Zhu-er’s wife, terrified lest Tangerine should seize this opportunity to denounce her,
came rushing in at this point and tried to put Tan-chun off the scent with her own
ex?tremely garbled account of what had happened. But Tan-chun showed that she
had a better understanding of the case than the woman supposed.
‘I think you are being very stupid,’ she said smilingly. ‘What you ought to do, now
that your mother-in-law has already got herself into trouble, is to go to Mrs Lian
before the money confiscated has been divided up and ask if you can have some of it
back to redeem this jewellery with. Ideally, of course, it would have been better if
you could have redeemed it before all this trouble broke out and saved yourselves a
bit of face. But now that you have no face left to save, you’d much better make a
clean breast of it and get the money. After all, your mother-in-law has already been
found guilty. However many crimes she’s committed, they can only cut her head off
once. You take my advice. Go round to Mrs Lian’s place as soon as possible and make
a clean breast of it. Standing around here shouting is not going to get you anywhere!’
The woman was forced to admit that Tan-chun’s reading of the situation was correct.
But she was too scared to go to Xi-feng and confess.
‘If I hadn’t heard you talking about this, it would have been none of my business,’
said Tan-chun. ‘But now that I have heard, I think you had better let me take over and
do the explaining for you.’
Unknown to the others, Tan-chun had tipped Scribe the wink a minute or two
previously and Scribe had slipped outside to summon help. It was no surprise to
Tan-chun, therefore, that Patience should have walked in just as she was saying this;
but to the others her appearance at that moment was little short of miraculous.
Bao-qin clapped her hands delightedly.
‘I always knew Cousin Tan was a witch. Now here comes her familiar spirit!’
‘It’s not witchcraft, it’s generalship,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Don’t you remember what it says
in The Art of War?
A shy maiden in defence, but swift as a hare in the attack.
In good generalship surprise is of the essence.’
A look from Bao-chai caused the two girls to drop their bantering and talk of
something else while Tan-chun addressed herself to the new arrival.
‘Is your mistress any better yet?’ she asked Patience. ‘She seems to have
completely lost her grip on things since she had this illness. It’s very unfortunate for
people like me who have to put up with the consequences.
‘Oh?’ said Patience in some surprise. ‘Has someone been giving you trouble, miss?
If you will let me know what I can do, I am at your disposal.’
Zhu-er’s wife was now in a panic. She bounded up to Patience and was all over her
before Tan-chun could get a word in.
‘Sit down while I tell you, Miss Patience. I can explain it all.’
Patience gave her a long, hard look.
‘Miss Tan and I are talking. What right have you to come butting in like this? If you
had any manners at all, you wouldn’t even be in this room, you’d be waiting
respectfully outside. Whoever heard of an outside servant going into one of the
young mistresses’ apartments without being asked?’
‘Manners?’ said Tangerine. ‘You won’t find many around here. People barge in and
out of this apartment as they please.’
‘It’s your fault then if they do,’ said Patience sharply. ‘If Miss Ying is too gentle to do
so, you ought to throw them out yourselves and then go and report them to Her
Ladyship.’
Zhu-er’s wife reddened at Patience’s rebuke and took herself outside.
‘Now I can answer your question,’ Tan-chun said to Patience. ‘This is not actually
my affair. If it were, perhaps I shouldn’t have minded quite so much. What happened
is that this woman’s mother-in-law, trading on the fact that she used to be Miss Ying’s
wet-nurse when she was a baby and taking advantage of Miss Ying’s easy-going
nature, took some of her jewellery without telling her in order to raise money for her
gambling. As if that wasn’t enough, this woman had the gall to pretend that Miss
Ying owed them money in order that she could blackmail her into interceding for her
mother-in-law. I found her and these two maids shouting at each other in Miss Ying’s
bedroom while Miss Ying sat by helpless. Now that you are here, I should like to ask
you this question. Is this woman really so thick-witted that she doesn’t know any
better, or has someone else put her up to this? I mean, is there some plan to
undermine Miss Ying first and then, when she is safely out of the way, to get to work
on me and on Miss Xi?’
‘Oh miss!’ said Patience, endeavouring to treat the question as a joke, ‘how could
you? Mrs Lian is not as bad as that!’
‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ said Tan-chun coldly. ‘You know the saying: “Like grieves for
like; for when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.” When I saw what was
happening to Miss Ying, I couldn’t help feeling nervous.’
Patience turned to Ying-chun questioningly.
‘It would be easy enough to deal with this matter if it weren’t that this woman is
the wife of your foster-brother. It’s really up to you, miss.’
Ying-chun had all this time been sitting shoulder to shoulder with Bao-chai, reading
one of the stories in Rewards-and-Punishments. She had not even heard what
Tan-chun had been saying and had only the haziest idea what was required of her
when she suddenly found herself being addressed. She smiled back, however, and
did her best to oblige.
‘Don’t ask me!’ she said. ‘There’s absolutely nothing that I can do about it. If they
will go getting themselves into trouble, they must face the consequences. All I can
say is that I can’t do anything to get their punishment reduced and I won’t do
anything to increase it. As for that object they took from me without telling me, if
they do bring it back I shall be happy to receive it; if they don’t bring it back I shall
not ask them for it. If either of Their Ladyships should ask me about it, I shall keep
the facts hidden from them if I can do so honourably, in which case these people may
consider themselves lucky; but if I can’t, I shall just have to tell them the truth. It is
quite out of the question that I should deliberately deceive Their Ladyships in order
to cover up for them. You say I am too easy-going and indecisive: if you know of a
better way of dealing with this matter that is both fool-proof and will not upset Their
Ladyships, by all means go ahead with it; I shall certainly not interfere.’
The others were much amused by this answer.
‘Ying-chun makes me think of that monk who went on discussing theological
matters while wolves and tigers prowled outside in his courtyard,’ said Dai-yu
laughing. ‘How on earth would she have controlled a great household like ours if she
had been a man?’
‘That’s begging the question,’ said Ying-chun, smiling. ‘There are plenty of men who
live off the fat of the land but who, in a crisis, are no better at dealing with things
than I. Anyway, Tai-shang says that of all works of merit helping people when they
are in trouble is the greatest. I may not be able to help anyone, but at least I am not
going out of my way to make things worse for them. What is the point of gratuitously
making enemies or exerting oneself for ends from which no one will benefit?’
Before she had finished, another visitor was heard arriving in the courtyard. Who this
was will be revealed in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 74

Lady Wang authorizes a raid
on Prospect Garden
And Jia Xi-chun breaks off relations
with Ning-guo House



Patience was greatly amused by the tone of Ying-chun’s answer to her inquiry.
Ying-chun’s further self-justification in reply to Dai-yu’s comment was cut short by
the arrival of another visitor. It was at this point that we concluded the last chapter.
The visitor was Bao-yu. When it was known that one of the chief organizers of the
gambling was Cook Liu’s younger sister, Cook Liu’s enemies in the Garden regarded
this as a good opportunity for making another attempt to oust her from her kitchen.
Going in a body to Xi-feng, they accused her of being in partnership with her sister
and receiving equal shares of her takings, and they demanded that Xi-feng should
take appropriate action to punish her. Cook Liu, when she heard this, was at first
panic-stricken; then, remembering her friends at Green Delights, she hurried over
there, taking great care that nobody saw her on the way, and begged Skybright and
Aventurin to tell Bao-yu what had happened. It occurred to Bao-yu, when they told
him, that as Ying-chun’s nurse was in trouble for the same offence, it would be more
effective to join forces with Ying-chun in pleading for clemency than to go along on
his own and plead only for Cook Liu. It was in order to discuss this matter that he had
come to see Ying-chun. Unfortunately, when he arrived, he found that she was not
alone.
‘Are you better now?’ the others asked him. (They supposed that he was still
suffering from shock.) ‘What have you come for?’
He could not state the real purpose of his visit in front of so many people and merely
told them that he had come ‘to see how Ying-chun was getting on’. The others
believed him, and a desultory conversation followed about nothing in particular.
Patience now went off to deal with the pearl-and-gold phoenix. Zhu-er’s wife
followed at her elbow, begging to be let off.
‘For charity’s sake, don’t tell her, miss! I promise you faithfully, that phoenix will be
redeemed.’
‘So you keep saying,’ said Patience, drily. ‘What a pity you couldn’t have redeemed
it a bit sooner and saved yourself this trouble! You want to wriggle out of this
somehow without telling her, don’t you? Well, I can’t say that I am very keen on
informing against you, myself. I’ll tell you what: you get that thing back as quickly as
possible and hand it over to me, and I won’t say anything about it to my mistress.’
Zhu-er’s wife was so relieved that she went down on her knees to thank her.
‘You carry on now with whatever you are doing, miss. I’ll have it ready for you by
this evening. I’ll bring it to show you as soon as I’ve redeemed it, and then I’ll take it
back to Miss Ying’s. How will that be?’
‘All right,’ said Patience. ‘But if you don’t turn up with it this evening, you will have
only yourself to blame for what happens.’
The two young women then went their separate ways.
‘Well?’ said Xi-feng, when Patience got back to her apartment. ‘What did Miss Tan
want you for?’
‘She was worried that you might have been fretting over this gambling business,’
said Patience, smiling. ‘She asked me how you’d been eating this last day or two.’
‘That’s very kind of her,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Oh, there’s more trouble, by the way. Some
of them have just been here accusing Cook Liu of being mixed up in the gambling
business with her sister. They’re saying, in fact, that she was the real or?ganizer.
However, remembering how insistent you always are that I should let well alone and
only think of my health, I took no action. Last time I ignored your advice and had
some?one punished, I not only offended Lady Xing but also ended up by making
myself ill. So this time I knew better. They can do as they please, I don’t care.
Someone else can do the worrying. I have nearly destroyed myself by worrying and
the only result of it is that everyone hates me. Very well. Now all I am going to think
about is getting better. And when I am better, I am going to turn myself into a Mr
Yes-yes. No matter what frightful things the others get up to, I shall just say “Yes, yes”
when I hear about them. “Yes, yes,” I shall say, and not give them a single other
thought!’
‘If only you would be like that,’ said Patience smiling, ‘what a blessing it would be
for us all!’
At that moment Jia Lian came in, sighing and striking his hands together with
vexation.
‘More trouble! When I borrowed that stuff from Faithful the other day to pawn,
how could Mother have got to hear about it? She had me over there just now and
asked me to borrow two hundred taels for her. She said she wanted it for the
Mid-Autumn festival. I said I didn’t know who I could borrow two hundred taels from
at the moment. “If you can’t borrow the money, you can easily find something to
raise it on,” she said. “Don’t always make excuses. Don’t know who to borrow it from,
indeed! You could spirit all those things out of Lady Jia’s room when you chose to, yet
now you make difficulties about raising a paltry two hundred taels for me! You’re
lucky I haven’t told anyone what you’ve been up to.” I’m certain Mother isn’t really
short of money. This is sheer, gratuitous trouble-making on her part.’
‘There were no outsiders here on that occasion,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I wonder how the
news could have leaked out.’
Patience, who had been listening to their conversation, tried hard to remember who
had been present. After some moments it came back to her.
‘I know. There was no one else here that day while you were talking to Faithful, but
in the evening, when she sent the stuff round, that mother of Simple’s who works for
Her Old Ladyship called in with some laundry and afterwards sat quite a long while
talking in the kitchen. If she saw that great trunk there, it would have been only
natural to ask what was inside it, and the maids might well have told her, without
realizing that they were not supposed to. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that’s how it
got about.’
She called some of the junior maids in to question them.
‘Which of you told Simple’s mother the other day what was in that trunk?’
The maids knelt down in terror and swore by the most sacred oaths that they had
said nothing.
‘We’re always most careful not to say too much to anyone. When people ask us
anything, we always say that we don’t know. We’d certainly never have told her
about that!’
Xi-feng considered the probabilities.
‘Somehow I don’t think they would have told her. At all events, there is no point in
harrving them about it now. We shall just have to put that question behind us. The
important thing now is to make sure that Mother gets what she wants. I’d rather we
went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble.’ She turned to
Patience. ‘Take some of my gold things again and get us another two hundred taels. -
As soon as she has the money ready, you can take it to Mother immediately, and that
should be the end of the matter,’ she told Jia Lian.
‘Might as well raise four hundred taels while you are about it,’ said Jia Lian. ‘We
could do with another two hundred ourselves.’
‘I don’t see that at all,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We don’t really need two hundred taels
ourselves. And in any case, if we raise so much now, where is the money coming from
later for getting the things out of pawn?’
Patience fetched the now familiar gold necklaces and told Brightie’s wife to take
them to the pawnshop. Soon afterwards Brightie’s wife was back again with the cash
and Jia Lian went in person to hand it over to his mother.
While Jia Lian was taking the money to Lady Xing, Xi-feng and Patience continued to
ask themselves who could have leaked the information about the surreptitious
removal of Grandmother Jia’s valuables.
‘It’s too bad!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Poor Faithful will be in trouble over this, and all because
of us.’
While they were still wondering who it could have been, Lady Wang was announced.
This was a surprise, for Xi-feng could think of no reason why she should be visiting
them. She and Patience hurried out to greet her.
Lady Wang had only one maid, a trusted junior, in attendance. There was an angry
expression on her face and she walked swiftly through the house into the inner room
and sat down grimly on the kang, all without uttering a word. Xi-feng, concealing her
apprehension behind a smile, hurriedly served her with tea.
‘It’s an unusual honour to have you here, Aunt.’
‘Patience, leave the room!’ Lady Wang commanded.
‘Yes’m,’ said Patience, wondering what on earth could be the matter, and hurried
out, taking all the other maids with her. She stood by the outer door until they were
all outside, then closed it after her and sat down at the top of the steps to prevent
anyone going in.
As Xi-feng, now thoroughly alarmed, watched her aunt and wondered why she had
come, Lady Wang, who appeared to be on the point of weeping, drew an
embroidered pouch from her sleeve and threw it on the kang.
‘Look at that!’
Xi-feng hastily picked it up and found herself, to her great surprise, looking at a lewd
picture, beautifully embroidered in silks.
‘Where did you get it from?’ she asked.
The tears that had collected in Lady Wang’s eyes poured down her cheeks now and
the voice in which she answered was choked and trembling.
‘Where did I get it from? I sit all day at the bottom of a well. As you seemed such a
conscientious young woman, I thought I could leave things to you and enjoy some
leisure, but it seems that you are no better at managing than I. Fancy leaving a thing
like that in the Garden - on a rockery, too, in broad daylight, where everyone could
see it! It was picked up by one of Grandmother’s maids. If your mother-in-law hadn’t
fortunately spotted the girl carrying it, it would have gone straight to Grandmother. I
think it’s for you to tell me how it came to be dropped there.’
It was Xi-feng’s turn to look angry.
‘How do you know it’s mine?’
Lady Wang sighed and shed a few more tears.
‘How can you ask me that? Who in this household apart from you and Lian could a
thing like this belong to? The old women would have no use for a thing like this and
none of the girls would know where to get one from. Obviously that wretched,
worthless Lian must have got hold of it from somewhere; and you, treating it, I
suppose, as a great joke, were only too happy to receive it from him. I know that
young couples do go in for this sort of thing; why try to deny it? But the young
people in the Garden are still innocent. Suppose one of their maids had picked it up
and shown it to them? It doesn’t bear thinking of. Or suppose a maid had picked it up
and told someone from outside that she had found it in the Garden? What sort of
reputation would that leave our family with? It would be better to die than that such
a thing should happen.’
A mixture of shame and exasperation caused the blood to rush into Xi-feng’s face.
She fell on her knees beside the kang. There were tears in her own eyes when she
answered, but they were tears of anger.
‘What you say is no doubt very reasonable, Aunt, and I have no wish to argue with
you, but I really don’t own anything like this and I really must ask you to reconsider
one or two of the things you have said. First of all, take another look at this bag. It
wasn’t made here. One can see at a glance that it is a poor commercial imitation of
“palace” embroidery. Even the tassels are the kind you would buy outside. I may be
young and frivolous, but I’d hardly be likely to want a trashy thing like this. Secondly,
this isn’t the sort of thing one would carry around with one. Even if it were mine, I
should keep it hidden somewhere in a secret place, not walk around with it on my
person, particularly if I were going into the Garden. The girls and I are always holding
each other and pulling each other about, so that if I were wearing a thing like this, it
would very quickly get noticed, and what should I feel like then, if one of the girls or
one of the maids were to look at it? Thirdly, I may be the only young married woman
with a husband in the family, but there are plenty of even younger married women
among the servants who are often in and out of the Garden. How can you be so sure
that it wasn’t one of them who dropped this bag? Then there are those younger
concubines of Sir She’s, like Carmine and Azure. Mother often takes one or two of
them with her when she goes into the Garden. They would be even more likely to
own a thing like this. And Zhen’s wife herself isn’t all that old, not to mention Lovey
and Dove, whom she frequently takes with her when she goes there. How do you
know it doesn’t belong to one of them? And in any case, there are so many maids in
the Garden, how can you be so sure that all of them are pure? There may be one or
two of the older ones who are not so innocent. One of them could have slipped out
on some pretext or other when no one was looking to flirt with the pages on the
inner gate and got it from one of them. It’s perfectly possible. But I can assure you
that I have never possessed a thing like this, and I know that Patience hasn’t either.
So I really must ask you to reconsider.’
Lady Wang was somewhat overwhelmed by this torrent of words, but had to admit
their reasonableness.
‘You can get up,’ she said with a sigh. ‘It was wrong of me to accuse you. I ought to
have known that a young woman of your breeding would not be guilty of such
unseemliness. I am afraid I was overwrought and allowed anger to get the better of
me. But what am I to do? Your mother-in-law saw fit to send this thing round to me
by a messenger. I was terribly upset when I unwrapped it and saw what it was.’
‘The first thing to do is to try not to be so upset,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If the servants
become aware that something is wrong, the chances of Grandmother getting to hear
about it will be much greater. If we can remain cool and carry out our investigations
in secret, we are much more likely to get at the truth, and even if we don’t, no one
outside is going to be any the wiser. We should pick four or five of our most trusted
servants to do the investigating - people like Zhou Rui’s wife and Brightie’s wife who
can be relied upon not to talk - and send them into the Garden as replacements of
the women who have been dismissed. The pretext for their investigations can be that
there are various things connected with the gambling that still remain to be cleared
up. The other thing we must do something about is the number of the maids. There
are far too many of them. As they get older, they begin to get grown-up ideas, and
one can never be quite sure that they may not get up to some mischief. It’s no good
waiting until something has actually happened before doing any?thing, because then
it will already be too late; on the other hand to begin large-scale dismissals straight
away would be very distressing for the girls and probably for us as well. It would be
better to wait until each maid either reaches a certain age or shows signs of growing
insubordinate, and then use the first slip she makes as grounds for dismissing her and
marrying her to one of the boys. In that way we can both avoid having trouble and at
the same time make a considerable reduction in our expenses.’
Lady Wang sighed.
‘You are of course right. But in fairness to our girls I think it must be said that they
are already making do with the absolute minimum of service. Not one of them has
more than two or three maids who are the least bit of use. The others are like a pack
of mischievous children. And I am not the only one who would feel unhappy about
cutting down the numbers; I think it highly probable that Grandmother, too, would
object. After all, things may be a bit difficult at present, but we can’t be all that poor.
I wouldn’t lay claim to any great riches, but I think I may perhaps be a little bit better
off than the rest of you. So if there is any talk of economy, I’d rather do without
my?self than see the girls suffer. The important thing now is to call in Zhou Rui’s wife
and one or two of our other women and get them to begin these secret
investigations for us as quickly as possible.’
Xi-feng at once called Patience in and explained what was wanted. Patience went out
again and within a short time had assembled five of Lady Wang’s and Xi-feng’s most
trusted retainers: Zhou Rui’s wife, Wu Xing’s wife and Zheng Hua’s wife from among
Lady Wang’s servants and Brightie’s wife and Happy’s wife from among Xi-feng’s.
Lady Wang thought they might not be enough for the sort of detailed investigation
she had in mind. While she was wondering who else to get, Wang Shan-bao’s wife
walked in.
Wang Shan-bao’s wife, like Goody Fei, was one of the servants who had been with
Lady Xing since her childhood and accompanied her when she came to the Jia
household as a bride. It was she, in fact, who had brought the embroidered bag to
Lady Wang, and she had trailed along to Xi-feng’s place out of curiosity, to see what
she would do about the discovery. Lady Wang’s past observation of these trusted
henchwomen of her sister-in-law had not been sufficient to make her mistrust them
and she welcomed this new arrival as a reinforcement.
‘Ah, just the person!’ she said as she caught sight of her. ‘After you have reported
back to your mistress, you will be able to go with these others into the Garden and
keep an eye on them for me.’
On a number of past visits to the Garden Wang Shan-bao’s wife had been greatly put
out by the failure of the maids there to show her the respect and consideration that
she felt to be her due; but dearly as she would have liked to teach those young
creatures a lesson, she had not so far found a sufficient pretext for doing so. This
discovery of an obscene object in the Garden was, in her eyes, a godsend, and her
recruitment by Lady Wang to play a part in the investigations arising out of it was the
kind of opportunity she had dreamed of.
‘We’ll get to the bottom of this easy enough, don’t you worry, madam,’ she said.
‘What you need in that Garden is more discipline, if you don’t mind my saying so, and
has been for some time. To see the way those young maids carry on there, you would
think they were princesses. They can have that whole place in an uproar, yet none of
us dares to breathe a word against them, for we know that if we did, they would go
running off to their young mistresses and get them to complain that it’s them we
have been criticizing: and that is a charge which none of us is willing to stand up to.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘Yes, I suppose the girls who wait on the young mistresses are inclined to be a bit
spoiled.’
‘The young mistresses’ maids are by no means the worst,’ said Wang Shan-bao’s
wife. ‘The worst of the lot is that Skybright that works in Bao-yu’s room. Because
she’s a bit better-looking than the others and a bit readier with her tongue, she goes
around dolled up all the time like a Xi-shi, putting everyone else in their place. She
likes the sound of her own voice, does that young woman, and she likes to have her
own way. If you say the slightest little thing to offend her, up fly her eyebrows and
she will begin telling you exactly what she thinks of you. Oh, she’s a proper little
madam, that one! Not much of the maidservant about her!’
A sudden recollection seemed to strike Lady Wang while Wang Shan-bao’s wife was
speaking. She turned to Xi-feng questioningly.
‘I remember last time I was in the Garden with Lady Jia seeing a maid, a
snaky-waisted girl with narrow, sloping shoulders and something of your Cousin Lin
about the eyes, shouting at one of the junior maids, and thinking what a thoroughly
objectionable young woman she must be. I didn’t say anything at the time because I
was with Lady Jia. I meant to try and find out who she was afterwards, but I forgot. I
wonder if this is the same girl? It sounds uncommonly like her.’
‘Skybright is certainly the best-looking of the maids,’ said Xi-feng cautiously, ‘and as
regards her behaviour and manner of speaking, I suppose you could say she is
inclined to be a little too free. The person you describe certainly sounds as if it might
have been her, but as I wasn’t myself there at the time, I wouldn’t like to say for sure
that it was.’
‘There’s no need to go on wondering,’ said Wang Shan?bao’s wife. ‘We can call her
here this minute and Her Ladyship can see for herself whether it’s her or not.’
‘Whenever I see anyone from Bao-yu’s room, it’s always either Aroma or Musk,’
said Lady Wang. ‘Both of them are the kind of plain, simple girl I like. They would
never send the kind of girl we are talking about to see me because they know that
that is just the sort of creature I cannot abide. Oh dear! One can’t help wondering,
when a thing like this happens: suppose Bao-yu were to be corrupted by a little harpy
like that...?’
After some moments’ reflection, she called in her own maid from outside.
‘I want you to go over to Master Bao’s place and say that there is something I want
to ask them about. Say that I would rather Aroma and Musk stayed behind to look
after Bao-yu. There is a girl there called Skybright who is very intelligent. You can tell
her to come. Say she is to come over with you straight away. You are not to say
anything to her on the way here.’
‘Yes, my lady,’ said the maid, and hurried off to Green Delights.
When she arrived Skybright, who had recently been feeling far from well, was just
getting up from a nap and was only half awake: but as the order said ‘Come at once’,
she had to go with the maid as she was, with no time to make herself presentable.
However, this did not unduly concern her. Knowing Lady Wang’s aversion to people
of her type, she would normally have felt some nervousness about having to appear
before her. On this occasion she took comfort from the fact that her indisposition
over the last few days had caused her to neglect her appearance. Dowdiness would
count in her favour.
Alas! When she arrived in Xi-feng’s room, Lady Wang took one look at this languid
vision with its tousled hair, crooked hairpins and rumpled dress and felt all the anger
she had just conquered rising up again inside her - particularly when she recognized
this as being almost certainly the same girl as the one who had aroused her ire on
that previous occasion a month before in the Garden.
‘Good gracious me!’ she exclaimed sarcastically. ‘What swooning Xi-shi have we
here? For whose benefit do you go around in this extraordinary get-up? Don’t
imagine I don’t know what your little game is, young lady! I may not have done
anything about you yet, but I’ll have the skin off you one of these days! - Is Bao-yu
any better?’
Though shaken by the unexpectedness of this onslaught, Skybright realized at once
that someone must have been saying things about her. And although understandably
angry, she managed to keep her head. She was too intelligent not to realize that the
question about Bao-yu was a trap. She knelt to answer it.
‘I don’t often go into Bao-yu’s room, madam, or see much of him, so I am afraid I
am not able to tell you. It’s Aroma and Musk who mostly wait on him. They would be
able to give Your Ladyship an answer.’
‘Little liar!’ said Lady Wang. ‘You’ve got eyes in your head, haven’t you? What’s the
good of employing you if you can’t even tell me whether he’s well or not?’
‘I used to be Her Old Ladyship’s maid,’ said Skybright. ‘She selected me for night
duty in the outer room at Green Delights because she thought that, going to live in
the big, empty Garden he might get frightened at night. I told Her Old Ladyship that I
was too stupid to work for Bao-yu, but that only made her angry. She said, “I’m not
asking you to wait on him personally. You don’t need to be clever for the job I’m
asking you to do.” So after that I had to go. I don’t see him very often. He might call
me in once or twice every ten days or so to ask me about something and I just
answer him and go back to my work. His meals and all the personal service are
looked after either by the older servants and nannies or by Aroma and Musk and
Ripple. Whenever I’ve got time for it, I still have a lot of Her Old Ladyship’s sewing to
do. I’m afraid I don’t pay much attention to what Bao-yu is doing. I will do so in
future, if Your Ladyship wishes me to.’
Lady Wang was completely taken in.
‘Please don’t trouble yourself,’ she said hastily. ‘Holy Name! I’m only too happy to
learn that you don’t see much of him. So you were given to him by Her Old Ladyship.
I suppose in that case I shall have to see her first before I can dismiss you.’
She turned to Wang Shan-hao’s wife.
‘When you and the others go into the Garden, I want you to take particular care
that this girl is kept well away from Bao-yu. Make sure that she doesn’t sleep in the
same room. I shall be dealing with her in a few days’ time, when I have had a chance
of speaking about her to Her Old Ladyship.’
As she turned again momentarily towards Skybright, her voice rose almost into a
shout.
‘Get out of here! The sight of you standing there like a young trollop offends my
eyes! Who gave you permission anyway to dress yourself up in that garish fashion?’
Skybright left the room, utterly crushed. She buried her face in her handkerchief as
soon as she was outside the door and wept into it every step of the way back to
Green Delights.
Meanwhile Lady Wang was telling Xi-feng how much she regretted her remissness in
having allowed creatures like Skybright to inhabit the Garden for so long undisturbed.
‘I wish I had had the energy to keep a closer watch on things,’ she said. I never
expected to find a young flibber?tigibbet like that in the Garden. And I suppose if
there is one there like that, there are likely to be others like it as well.’
Xi-feng could see that Lady Wang was too incensed to reason with; and however
much she might have said to the point, she would not in any case have dared to do
so in front of Wang Shan-bao’s wife, who was one of her mother?-in-law’s principal
informants and a most notorious stirrer-up of trouble. She merely lowered her head,
therefore, and murmured assent.
It was Wang Shan-bao’s wife who spoke.
‘Don’t upset yourself, my lady. Leave all these little things to me. There’s a very easy
way of getting to the bottom of this business. Tonight, when the Garden gates have
been shut and there is no chance of word getting through inside, we’ll make a
surprise visit and search all the maids’ rooms in each of the apartments. Whoever
owned this thing we’re trying to find out about must have other things like it as well,
so if we find anything like it in our search, we shall have found the owner.
‘That sounds like a good idea,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We shall never get anywhere
unless we do something like that. - What do you think?’ she asked Xi-feng.
Xi-feng deemed it impolitic to disagree.
‘If you think it’s all right, Aunt, I should let her do it.
‘I do think it’s all right,’ said Lady Wang emphatically. ‘Unless we do it this way, we
might spend a year investigating and still get nowhere.’
A raid was accordingly planned for that very evening. After dinner, when
Grandmother Jia had retired for the night and the cousins had all returned to their
apartments, Wang Shan-bao’s wife, having first asked Xi-feng to accompany her, led
her little party into the Garden. After ordering all the side gates to be closed, she set
about searching immediately, beginning with the room just inside the Garden gate
which was used by the women of the night watch as a rendez-vous. Nothing of
interest was discovered there except for a few candle-ends and a little leftover
lamp-oil which someone had evidently put by to take home. However, Wang
Shan-bao’s wife solemnly pronounced them to be stolen property: no one was to
touch these things, she said, until Lady Wang had been informed and the appropriate
steps had been taken. They proceeded to Green Delights, barring the courtyard gates
after them as soon as they were inside.
Bao-yu was still worrying about Skybright when this party of women came bursting
into his courtyard and, without a word of explanation, walked straight into the part of
the house occupied by the maids. On going out to investigate he ran into Xi-feng and
asked her what was happening. Xi-feng went indoors to sit down with him and
accepted a cup of tea.
‘Something important is missing that no one will own up to having taken,’ she said.
‘It’s thought that one of the maids in the Garden might have stolen it, so they are
searching everyone in order to clear the innocent ones of suspicion.’
While Xi-feng was explaining this to Bao-yu, Wang Shan-bao’s wife was proceeding
with her search.
‘Whose are these trunks?’ she asked, and demanded that the owners should come
forward and open them.
Aroma had suspected that some sort of trouble lay ahead when she saw the state
that Skybright was in when she returned from her interview. The raid confirmed her
premonition. Resignedly she set the other maids an example by opening her own
trunks and boxes first. Nothing of interest was found in them. The searchers passed
on. Each girl stood by her own things and opened them up as the searchers came to
them. Finally only Skybright’s trunk remained.
‘Which girl’s is this?’ said Wang Shan-bao’s wife. ‘Why doesn’t she come forward
and open it?’
Aroma was on the point of opening it herself when Skybright, who, to judge from the
state her hair was in, had only just got out of bed, came rushing into the room, flung
the lid open with a bang, picked the trunk up by its bottom, and emptied its contents
on the floor. Wang Shan-bao’s wife blushed scarlet with embarrassment.
‘There’s no cause to be angry with me, miss,’ she said. ‘I’m not carrying this search
out to please myself, I’m here on Her Ladyship’s orders. If you don’t want your things
to be searched, you have only to say so and I shall tell Her Ladyship. There’s no need
to carry on like this about it.’
At this Skybright’s wrath blazed up in fury. She pointed at the old woman’s face.
‘You say you are here on Her Ladyship’s orders. Well I’m here on Her Old Ladyship’s
orders. Anyway, I thought I knew all the women who worked at Her Ladyship’s place
and I’m sure I never saw a self-important, meddlesome old busy?body like you there
before!’
Xi-feng, who had now rejoined them, was secretly delighted to see Wang Shan-bao’s
wife getting the rough side of Skybright’s tongue, but because the woman was her
mother-in-law’s favourite, she had to pretend that she was shocked, and shouted at
Skybright to be silent. Wang Shan-bao’s wife looked angry and flustered and seemed
on the point of re?torting; but Xi-feng restrained her.
‘All right, Mrs Wang, that will do. You don’t have to put yourself on the same level
by arguing with the girl. You get on with your searching. We’ve got all the other
places to go to yet, and if we delay too long, word will get round that we are coming
and they will be prepared for us. If that happens and you don’t succeed in finding
anything, I shan’t consider myself responsible.’
Though inwardly fuming, Wang Shan-bao’s wife was obliged to contain herself and
spent the next minute or two rummaging tight-lipped among Skybright’s possessions.
Having found nothing of importance, she then asked Xi-feng if they might go
elsewhere.
‘Now have you looked really thoroughly?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’re going to look pretty
silly if you have to report back to Lady Wang tomorrow that you couldn’t find
any?thing.’
‘We’ve been through everything,’ said one of the women. ‘There’s nothing here
that there shouldn’t be. We did find one or two boy’s things, but they were the sort
of things a quite small boy would use. Probably they belonged to Bao-yu when he
was little. Anyway, they’re of no conse?quence.’
‘In that case we can be on our way,’ said Xi-feng, pleasantly. ‘On to the next place,
then!’
Off they went without more ado. Xi-feng turned to Wang Shan-bao’s wife as they
walked along for a word in her ear.
‘I’ve got a suggestion to make, but I don’t know whether you’ll agree to it or not.
Can we confine this search to members of our own household? I don’t think we
ought to search the maids in Miss Xue’s room.’
‘Oh, I quite agree,’ said Wang Shan-bao’s wife. ‘It would never do to go searching
the rooms of our guests.’
Xi-feng nodded.
     ‘That’s what I thought’
They had by now reached the Naiad’s House. Dai-yu had already gone to bed when
the arrival of all these people was announced. Unable to guess what they could have
come for, she was on the point of getting up to ask when Xi-feng came into her room
and begged her to stay in bed.
‘Go to sleep. We shall be gone again in a moment.’
She slipped out again after a few inconsequences and rejoined the others, who had
already begun their searching. In the course of rummaging through the various
trunks and boxes in Nightingale’s room they came across some old amulets whose
period of effectiveness had long since expired and a set of two pouches and a
fan-case designed for wearing on a belt. The fan-case had a fan in it, which they took
out to examine. These were obviously masculine articles and had in fact been worn
at one time by Bao-yu. Wang Shan-bao’s wife, congratulating herself on what she
took to be a signifi?cant discovery, called Xi-feng over to witness it.
‘Look at these things, Mrs Lian! Now where would these have come from?’
Xi-feng smiled.
‘These would be old things of Bao-yu’s,’ she said. ‘He and the girls here have been
seeing each other for years - since they were little children. Their Ladyships would
probably remember having seen these things on him. You could always ask them, if
you don’t believe me.’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife was at once all smiles.
‘If you recognize them, Mrs Lian, that’s good enough for me.’
‘There’s nothing here worth bothering about,’ said Xi-?feng. ‘I think we should
leave these folk in peace and hurry on elsewhere.’
‘We’ve had so many other things where these came from and given so many in
return that I can’t keep track of them,’ said Nightingale laughing. ‘I couldn’t for the
life of me tell you when he gave us these.’
Xi-feng and Wang Shan-bao’s wife now conducted their little party to Tan-chun’s
place. This time their arrival was anticipated. Someone had brought word of their
coming, and Tan-chun, guessing that something serious must have happened to have
provoked so ugly a reaction, was standing in the open doorway, surrounded by maids
with lighted candles, waiting for the search party when it arrived.
‘Well?’ she asked, somewhat challengingly. ‘What do you want?’
Xi-feng smiled an emollient smile.
‘Something has been missing and they have been questioning everyone for several
days now without being able to find out who took it. It’s thought that whoever is
responsible for the theft might try to incriminate one of the maids. We are making
this search more for the sake of clearing them than because we really suspect any of
them of taking it.’
‘Naturally all my maids are thieves,’ said Tan-chun affably. ‘As a matter of fact, I am
their principal fence. If you want to search, you’d better look at my cupboards and
boxes first, because anything they steal is automatically handed over to me.’
She ordered the maids to open all her boxes. She also made them bring in her
dressing-cases, jewel-boxes, bedding-rolls and miscellaneous wrapped-up bundles of
clothing and open them all up for Xi-feng to inspect.
Xi-feng laughed uncomfortably.
‘I’m only carrying out your mother’s orders, coz. There’s no point in getting
offended with me.’ She turned to the servants. ‘Quickly, do these things up again for
Miss Tan.’
Scribe and Ebony, assisted by Patience and Felicity, began refastening the boxes and
tying the bundles up again.
‘I’ve said that you may search my things,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but if you want to search
my maids’, I’m afraid that won’t be possible. You see, I am a very hard mistress. I
always insist on knowing what my maids have got; consequently everything they
have - every needle and thread even - is taken care of by me; I don’t allow them to
keep anything themselves. So if you want to do any searching, you will have to search
me. If that doesn’t satisfy you, you have only to report to Lady Wang that I was
obstructive and I will gladly face whatever the consequences are tomorrow. I must
say, I cannot understand this eagerness to meet trouble half-way. The searching will
begin soon enough in this household when the day of confiscation arrives. Didn’t you
hear the news this morning about the Zhens? They tempted fate, just as we are now
doing, by carrying out a quite unnecessary search of their own servants, and now
there is a confiscation order against them and they are being searched themselves.
No doubt our time too is coming, slowly but surely. A great household like ours is not
destroyed in a day. “The beast with a thousand legs is a long time dying.” In order for
the destruction to be complete, it has to begin from within.’
She began to cry. Xi-feng darted a look at the women, which Zhou Rui’s wife
interpreted as a signal that they should go.
‘Since Miss Tan has said that the girls’ things are all here, Mrs Lian, can’t we go on
to another place now and leave her in peace?’
Xi-feng responded by rising to her feet and wishing Tan?chun good night.
‘Are you sure you’ve looked properly?’ said Tan-chun. ‘It’s no good coming back
tomorrow and asking to look again, because I shan’t let you.’
‘If all the maids’ things are in here, there is no need to look,’ said Xi-feng, smiling.
‘No need to look, when I’ve gone to the trouble of having everything opened for
you?’ said Tan-chun coldly. ‘I call that rather perverse. Tomorrow I suppose you will
say that I covered up for my maids and wouldn’t let you look. I want to be told in
plain language that you have searched as much as you want to. If you haven’t, you’d
better do so now, while you have the chance.’
Xi-feng smiled. She knew from past experience that she had to be more careful with
Tan-chun than with any of the other girls.
‘I have already searched your maids’ things and your things sufficiently.’
‘And what about the rest of you?’ Tan-chun asked the women.
‘We’ve searched enough,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife and the other women, smiling.
It was now that Wang Shan-bao’s wife showed her total lack of judgement - for she
was in truth a very stupid woman. She had heard something of Tan-chun’s reputation
in the past, but refused to believe that an unmarried girl of her years - particularly
one who was a concubine’s daughter -could be as formidable as Tan-chun was said to
be. No doubt, she told herself, it was the inexperience or pusillanimity of her
informants that made them think her so. Was not she, Wang Shan-bao’s wife, one of
Lady Xing’s oldest and most trusted servants? Did not even Lady Wang have to show
her a cer?tain measure of deference? A mere chit of a girl like Tan-chun was not
going to intimidate her. She had, in any case, the distinct impression that it was
Xi-feng and not herself that Tan-chun was angry with. At all events, she resolved to
show how little she held Tan-chun in esteem by indulging in a little horse-play at her
expense. Going up to Tan-chun, she took hold of a corner of her jacket and turned it
back, grinning all over her face.
‘There!’ she said. ‘Now I’ve even searched Miss Tan, and there’s nothing on her
either!’
Xi-feng was shocked.
‘Good gracious, woman! Are you -?’
But before she could finish there was a resounding smack! and a large red mark
appeared on the old woman’s face where Tan-chun had hit her.
Tan-chun was in a towering rage.
‘Who do you think you are? How dare you touch me? It seems that the respect that
I and the others show you, even though it is only for Her Ladyship’s sake and out of
consideration for your age, merely encourages you to make mischief for us and abuse
your borrowed powers. That, in all conscience, is hard enough to bear. But now, to
lay hands on me - that is really too much! If you have reckoned on my being a poor,
timid creature like your Miss Ying whom you can bully and impose upon at your
pleasure, you have made a very big mistake. You may search my things if you wish
and I shall not complain; but I will not be made a laughing-stock. Here!’ - with one
hand she began feverishly undoing her buttons, while with the other she pulled
Xi-feng’s hand towards her and placed it beneath her jacket ‘Search me! I would
rather be searched by you than submit to being pawed over by a slave!’
Xi-feng and Patience quickly buttoned her up again and straightened out her dress,
shouting angrily at Wang Shan?bao’s wife as they did so.
‘You have been drinking again, Nannie. Why do you do it, if it makes you behave so
badly? You’d better get out of here, before worse happens!’
Patience did her best to comfort Tan-chun.
‘Dear miss! Please don’t distress yourself. She isn’t worth your getting upset about!’
Tan-chun gave a humourless laugh.
‘I’m not upset. If I’d been upset I should have beaten my brains out before I’d have
let her touch me. I shall see Grandmother and Lady Wang about this first thing
tomorrow, and after that I shall call on Lady Xing and make whatever amends she
likes to ask for.’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife had retreated hastily from the room after her discomfiture and
was now lurking outside the window complaining bitterly of the outrage to her
dignity.
‘This is the first time anyone has ever struck me. I shall see Lady Xing tomorrow and
ask her to let me go back to my old home. If this is the way I am to be treated, I had
rather not go on living!’
‘Do you hear what that woman is saying?’ Tan-chun asked her maids. ‘Are you
waiting for me to go out there and argue with her myself?’
Scribe, needing no second prompting, hurried outside to take up the cudgels for her
mistress.
If I were in your shoes, Mrs Wang, I should have the sense to keep my mouth shut.
We should all be only too pleased if you really did go back to your own home; but I’m
afraid that when it comes to it, you won’t be able to tear yourself away. After all, if
you go, who will there be left to worm her way into Her Ladyship’s confidence and
make all our lives a misery by having searches made?’
Xi-feng was greatly amused.
‘Good for Scribe! “Like mistress, like maid”!’
‘Oh,’ said Tan-chun coldly, ‘we thieves have ready wits. We are all capable of
turning a phrase or two. It’s only when it comes to going behind other people’s backs
and stirring those in authority up against them that we are not quite so clever.’
Patience made some soothing remark to Tan-chun, simultaneously making a grab at
Scribe and pulling her back into the room, while Zhou Rui’s wife and the other
women did their best to be conciliatory. Xi-feng remained until she had seen
Tan-chun safely put to bed before leading her party off in the direction of Xi-chun’s
Spring in Winter room in the Lotus Pavilion, briefly taking in Li Wan’s place on the
way.
As Li Wan was unwell and had already taken her medicine and settled down for the
night by the time they arrived, they went into the maids’ room straight away without
disturbing her. After searching each of the maids’ boxes in turn and finding nothing,
they continued on their way to Xi-chun’s apartment.
Being younger and more immature than the other cousins, Xi-chun was much more
frightened by this visitation and at first seemed to be quite bewildered by it. It took
all of Xi?feng’s efforts to calm her. Unfortunately, while they were searching in
Picture’s trunk, they came upon a large packet containing thirty or forty silver
medallions, a carved jade belt-buckle, a pair of men’s boots and a pair of socks. Even
Xi-feng turned pale.
‘Where did these come from?’ she asked the unhappy maid.
Picture knelt down and tearfully confessed the truth.
‘They were given to my brother by Mr Zhen, madam. Since our parents went to live
in the South, our uncle and aunt have been looking after us. They both drink and
gamble a lot, and my brother was afraid that if he left anything with them they would
sell it and spend the money, so he made a secret arrangement with one of the old
nannies to bring things in to me so that I could look after them for him.’
Xi-chun, a naturally timorous child, was terrified by this discovery.
‘I knew nothing about this!’ she cried. ‘It is very wicked of her. If you want to beat
her, cousin, please do it outside. I’m not used to hearing such things. I think it would
distress me.’
Xi-feng smiled.
‘If what you say is true,’ she told Picture, ‘you can be forgiven for looking after
these things. But your brother had no business to choose such a way of getting them
in to you. If these things could be smuggled in without anyone knowing, then so
could anything else. It’s the person who brought them in who is the really guilty party.
Of course, if what you say is not true, you may as well give up hope of living!’
‘I wouldn’t dare lie to you, madam,’ said Picture, weeping. ‘You have only to ask Mr
and Mrs Zhen. If they say my brother wasn’t given these things, I shan’t complain if
you beat us both to death.’
‘I shall certainly ask,’ said Xi-feng. ‘But even if he was given them, you are still to
blame. Who said that you could have things brought in to you secretly? I shall let you
off this once if you will tell me honestly who brought them in, but you mustn’t ever
do this again.’
‘Don’t let her off!’ said Xi-chun. ‘There are so many maids. If the older ones see her
getting away with it, there’s no knowing what they will get up to. You may want to
forgive her, but I don’t.’
‘She seems to me a pretty sensible girl as a rule,’ said Xi?feng. ‘We all make
mistakes sometimes. I’m only proposing that we should let her off this once. If she
does anything like this again, we shall punish her for this offence as well. - Come on
now, what about this person who brought you the things?’ she asked Picture. ‘Tell
me who it was.’
‘Oh, I can tell you that,’ said Xi-chun. ‘It’s sure to have been that old Zhang woman
from the rear gate. She’s always around here, whispering guiltily to the maids and
doing little favours for them - in return for which, of course, they give her their
protection.’
Xi-feng told one of the women to make a note of this. The silver and the other things
she gave to Zhou Rui’s wife to take care of until Picture’s statement about their
provenance could be verified.
This old Mamma Zhang whom Xi-chun had named as the go-between who had
brought things in for Picture’s brother was a close kinswoman of Wang Shan-bao’s
wife, being in fact the mother-in-law of one of her children. However, since becoming
Lady Xing’s chief confidante, Wang Shan?bao’s wife had had little time for kinsfolk or
former colleagues, and her treatment of Mamma Zhang had caused that matron to
take umbrage. On two occasions there had been words between them, and for some
time now the two of them had not been on speaking terms. The satisfaction of
learning that the guilty bearer of these objects was a hated enemy almost
compensated Wang Shan-bao’s wife for the indignity of being slapped by Tan-chun
and taunted by Tan-chun’s maid. She endeavoured to impress Xi-feng with the gravity
of what they had discovered.
‘This smuggling is a very serious business, Mrs Lian. No doubt the things we are
looking for got into the Garden by the same way. I think you ought to look into this.’
‘I fully intend to do so,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t need you to tell me.’
They took leave of Xi-chun then and made their way to Ying-chun’s. Ying-chun was
asleep when they arrived and the maids had already gone to bed. They had to knock
a long while at the gate before anyone answered.
‘There’s no need to disturb your mistress,’ Xi-feng said to the girl who admitted
them, and made straight for the maids’ room, followed by the rest of the party.
Knowing that Wang Shan-bao’s wife was Chess’s maternal grandmother, Xi-feng
watched her very attentively to see if she would show any favouritism. Wang
Shan-bao’s wife began on the trunks of the other maids. None of them contained
anything of interest. Coming to Chess’s trunk last of all, she merely picked up one or
two things lying on the top of it before hurriedly pronouncing that there was ‘nothing
there’, and would have shut it up again if Zhou Rui’s wife had not intervened to
prevent her.
     ‘Now just a minute. Whether there is or not, you’ve got to go through it properly,
the same as you did the rest, out of fairness to the others.’
She stretched her own hand out as she said this and, diving into the trunk, fetched
out, successively, a pair of men’s padded socks, a pair of men’s satin slippers, and a
packet containing a little Loving Couple ornament and a letter. All these things she
handed over to Xi-feng.
From handling so many bills, invoices and accounts during her years as a household
manager, Xi-feng had learned to recognize quite a large number of characters and
was able to make out the whole of the crude missive, written on pink Double
Happiness notepaper, that Zhou Rui’s wife had just thrust into her hand.
     Since your visit last month my parnts have fund out about us but cant do any
thing til Miss Yings marrid if
     you can meet me in the garden send word by mrs Zhang we can talk more frely
in the garden than at home
   PLEASE TRY I have recd the two rosearys I send you this bag it shows you what I
dream of!! PLEASE
KEEP IT!!! your loving kit cousin PAN YOU?AN
     Xi-feng could hardly restrain herself from laughing out loud.
     Wang Shan-bao’s wife knew nothing of the romantic history that lay behind this
letter; but she had already had an un?comfortable feeling that all was not well when
she saw the men’s socks and shoes; and now, as she watched Xi-feng reading the
words on the pink notepaper and laughing at what she read, she became even more
apprehensive.
‘What is it, madam? An account?’ she said. ‘I suppose you are laughing because
there is some mistake in it.’
‘It certainly doesn’t balance properly,’ said Xi-feng, laughing. ‘If you are Chess’s
grandmother, shouldn’t her kit-cousin be a Wang?’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife found the question a very strange one.
‘She has a kit-cousin on her father’s side, her father’s sister’s son. Pan You-an, that
boy who ran away - he’s her kit-cousin.’
‘That makes sense,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Would you like me to read you the letter?’
     She proceeded to do so, to the great astonishment of all present. Wang
Shan-bao’s wife, who had sought out the wrongdoing of others with such
single-minded persistency, was now mortified to discover that the only wrongdoer
she had succeeded in unmasking was her own granddaughter.
‘Did you hear that, Mrs Wang?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, who, like the other women,
had signalled her astonishment by sticking her tongue out and wagging her head
incredu?lously. ‘Couldn’t be clearer than that, could it? No talking a way out of that
one! So what do we do now?’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife heartily wished that it were possible to slip through some
crack and disappear into the ground. Xi-feng contemplated her for some moments
with enjoyment, her lips puckered up with suppressed laughter.
‘One must look on the bright side,’ she said to Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘The girl has quietly
gone off and chosen herself a husband. At least her grandmother is saved the bother
of choosing one for her!’
Zhou Rui’s wife laughed, and added some pleasantry of her own. Wang Shan-bao’s
wife was left with no one but herself on whom to vent her anger, so she slapped her
own face and reproached herself.
‘Silly old fool! You’ve lived too long, that’s your trouble! Look what you’ve brought
on yourself! Why couldn’t you have kept your mouth shut? Now you’ve got to suffer
for your own foolishness.’
The others had not the heart to laugh, but could not help feeling pleased, either
because she had made them suffer in the past and it was sweet to see her suffer now
in her turn, or from a more detached belief that they were witnessing the
working-out of divine retribution on one who had richly deserved its visitation.
Xi-feng noticed with surprise that Chess, who all this time had been standing by with
bowed head, saying nothing, had no trace of fear or shame in her expression and
wondered if she might be planning to make away with herself. As it was obviously too
late that night for questioning her, she deputed two of the women to watch over her
until morning. She herself went off with the other women, taking the things with her
as evidence.
It was her intention to deal with the matter in the morning, after a night’s sleep, but
during the course of the night she was several times obliged to get out of bed, and
each time she did so she found that she was losing blood. By the time next morning
came, she was too weak and dizzy to get up. A doctor was called. He took her pulses,
wrote a prescription, and left, saying that she would need to rest. His findings,
reported to Lady Wang by the old nannies who went to have the prescription made
up, plunged that already depressed gentlewoman into yet greater gloom. Thus
judgement on Chess’s affair was, for the time being, postponed.
*
You-shi, as it happened, called in that day to see Xi-feng and sat for a while talking
with her. After that she went on to see Li Wan and talked with her. While she was
there, a maid arrived to ask if she would mind calling in to see Xi-chun, so she went
along to Xi-chun’s. As soon as she arrived, Xi-chun launched into a long and detailed
account of what had happened the previous night. She also sent someone round to
ask Zhou Rui’s wife for the things that had been found in Picture’s trunk. You-shi
verified that they had indeed been given by Cousin Then to Picture’s brother.
‘Stupid creature!’ she said, turning to rebuke Picture, who was standing by.
‘Why do you call her names?’ said Xi-chun. ‘It was your laxness which made her the
way she is. It’s too bad. None of the other girls has been let down like this by her
maids. How shall I be able to face them after this? I told Cousin Feng last night to
take her away, but she wouldn’t. I am glad that you have come, because now you will
be able to. I don’t care what you do with her - beat her, kill her, sell her - I just want
to be rid of her.’
Picture knelt down and implored her mistress most piteously not to send her away.
You-shi and Xi-chun’s nurses also did their best to talk Xi-chun out of dismissing her.
‘It was only a single lapse on her part,’ said You-shi. ‘I’m sure she won’t do it again.
Think of all the years of service she has given you.’
But Xi-chun, in whom the natural waywardness of youth was reinforced by a perverse
contrariness that was all her own, remained adamant in the face of both argument
and entreaty and insisted that Picture must go.
‘And it isn’t only Picture that I don’t want to see any more,’ she told You-shi. ‘The
same goes for all the rest of you. From now on I propose to stop going round to your
place altogether. There has been a lot of talk about you people of late. If I continue to
go round, I am afraid I might get involved in it.
‘Who has been talking about us?’ said You-shi. ‘And what, pray, have they found to
talk about? I think you might begin by considering who you are - and who we are. If
you have heard people talking about us, I should have thought it was up to you to ask
them what they meant by it.’
‘That’s rather strange advice coming from you,’ said Xi-chun sneeringly. ‘A girl like
me is supposed to keep well away from scandal, not go running headlong towards it.
You know the saying: “A father should help a son and the son his father, but not in
slaying or in doing evil.” The same principle holds good for you and me. I can only
answer for my own integrity. If you people end up by getting yourselves into a mess, I
don’t want to have anything to do with it.
You-shi was half angered and half amused by her young sister-in-law’s rudeness.
‘I can see now why people speak of Miss Xi as young for her age,’ she said,
addressing the grown-up servants below the kang. “‘Young and foolish” I have heard
her called. I used not to believe it of her, but finding her now so unreason?able and
so lacking in any sense of proportion, I really do begin to despair of her.’
‘She is still very young,’ said the women placatingly. ‘You must expect a few knocks
in your dealings with her, Mrs Zhen.’
‘I may be “young”,’ said Xi-chun scornfully, ‘but there is nothing “young” about
what I have just been saying. And since none of you people can even read or write,
how can you have the nerve to call me “foolish”?’
‘You are the great scholar, of course,’ said You-shi sarcastic?ally, ‘the Top of the List
candidate! Stupid people like us cannot hope to compete with you in understanding.’
‘There’s certainly not much understanding in what you have just said,’ Xi-chun
retorted. ‘Your assumption that a Top of the List candidate cannot be stupid is a
vulgar fallacy typical of the great mass of blind, undiscriminating world?lings. A true
sage can be identified by the very first step he takes, not by examination results.’
‘Goodness!’ said You-shi mockingly. ‘A moment ago we had the great scholar; now,
it seems, the great preacher has come to enlighten us!’
‘I lay no claim to enlightenment,’ said Xi-chun, ‘though I can see that most people
are no better than Picture - and that they are as little worth bothering about.’
‘You are a cold-hearted little monster,’ said You-shi.
‘If I seem cold, it is because I wish to keep myself uncorrupted,’ said Xi-chun. ‘Why
should I want to get involved with you and allow myself to be dragged down to your
level?’
You-shi was highly sensitive to remarks about her family’s reputation and had already
been embarrassed and upset by Xi-chun’s reference to ‘people talking’. Because
Xi-chun was only a girl, she had done her best not to lose her temper; but this last
remark was too much to stomach. Unable to contain herself any longer, she burst out
angrily.
‘What do you mean, “dragged down to my level”? You turn your maid’s offence into
an occasion for making a completely unwarranted attack upon me, and when I bear
your ridiculous attacks with patience, it seems merely to encourage you to indulge in
further insults. Very well, Miss Holy Purity! I shall be careful to keep away from you in
future, in case your priceless reputation is sullied by my presence.’
She swept out angrily, indicating to her maids as she went that they should bring
Picture with them.
‘It will be much better for all concerned if you don’t ever come here again,’ Xi-chun
called out after her. ‘It will save a lot of argument.’
You-shi heard this and grew even angrier; but reflecting that Xi-chun was, however
vexing, a young unmarried daughter of the family and therefore not a person with
whom she could engage in open wrangling, she swallowed her anger and hur?ried off
without answering, out of the Garden and into the inner part of the mansion.
What she heard there will be related in the chapter which follows.
CHAPTER 75

Midnight revellers are startled
by a sound of evil omen
And Mid-Autumn moon-watchers listen
to quatrains of unequal merit



When You-shi swept angrily out of Xi-chun’s apartment, it had been her intention to
visit Lady Wang, but one of the old women in her suite whispered in her ear to advise
her against going there.
‘Some people from the Zhen family have just arrived there, madam, with a lot of
things. I think it’s something secret they’ve come about. It probably wouldn’t be very
convenient for you to go there now.’
‘That’s funny,’ said You-shi. ‘I heard your master saying last night that he had read in
the Gazette that the Zhens had been attainted. It said that there was a search and
confiscation order on their estate and that the family were being brought under
arrest to the capital for questioning. What can any of them be doing here?’
‘You may well ask, madam. It was some of the women?folk we saw there. They
were in a terrible state, very worried and frightened. I expect they are doing
something they ought not to be.’
You-shi abandoned her idea of visiting Lady Wang and went back to see Li Wan, with
whom she had been talking a little earlier when Xi-chun called her away. Li Wan had
been visited in the meantime by her doctor; and as she was feeling much livelier than
she had done for some days, she had remained sitting up after her visit. You-shi
found her propped up on pillows and with the bedclothes pulled up round her, eager
for conversation. Unfortunately You-shi, who had been so affable on her earlier visit,
was now in no mood to talk and sat at Li Wan’s bedside silent and pre?occupied. Li
Wan wondered if she was feeling hungry.
‘Have something to eat,’ she said. ‘What would you like?’ She turned to Candida.
‘What nice little snack have we got that we could offer Mrs Zhen?’
‘Please don’t bother,’ said You-shi. ‘You’re hardly likely to have interesting snacks in
the house after being an invalid for so many days. And in any case I’m not hungry.’
‘Someone sent me some rather good wheatmeal tea yesterday,’ said Li Wan. ‘Why
don’t you try a bowl of that?’
She told Candida to mix some for her with sugar and boiling water. You-shi made no
reply and continued to brood. The women and maids who had come with her tried to
think of some means of distracting her.
‘You haven’t done your face yet since this morning, madam,’ said one of them.
‘Why not take this opportunity of having a wash?’
You-shi nodded. Li Wan at once sent Candida for her dressing-case and mirror.
Candida offered You-shi the use of her own make-up.
‘Our mistress doesn’t use make-up, Mrs Zhen. If you don’t mind using my stuff,
you’re very welcome to some of this.’
‘It’s true that I haven’t got any,’ said Li Wan, ‘but you ought to have borrowed some
from one of the young ladies to lend her. Fancy offering her your own, and in front of
everyone else! It’s a good job it was Mrs Zhen. Some people would have been most
offended.’
‘Oh, that’s all right,’ said You-shi, and began to wash. The maid with the basin bent
down to hold it out to her.
‘Where are your manners, girl?’ said Li Wan reprovingly, whereupon the maid at
once went down on her knees.
‘Manners!’ said You-shi. ‘The outward frills of respectability! Those are the things
our servants are so good at. What they actually get up to doesn’t bear much
investigating.’
Li Wan realized that she must be referring to the events of the previous night.
‘Why do you say that?’ she asked smilingly. ‘What has who got up to that doesn’t
bear investigating?’
‘Need you ask?’ said You-shi. ‘You’ve not been so ill that you’ve lost the use of your
faculties!’
Before Li Wan could reply, Bao-chai’s arrival was announced. Li Wan and You-shi both
called out to her to come in. You-shi, hurriedly wiping the water from her face, got up
to welcome her and made her sit down with her at the side of the bed.
‘On your own?’ she asked her. ‘Where are all the others?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I haven t seen them yet. Mother isn’t very well today,
and as her two senior maids are also both ill in bed and I don’t trust any of the others,
I thought I had better go and stay with her for a few days. At first I was going to tell
Lady Jia and Aunt Wang, but then I thought that as this is rather a small matter and I
shall in any case be coming back again as soon as Mother is better I wouldn’t bother
them but simply have a word about it with Cousin Wan.’
Li Wan and You-shi exchanged smiles and glances. Presently, when You-shi had
finished her toilet, the three of them each had a bowl of wheatmeal tea.
‘I must send someone to see how your mother is and find out what she is suffering
from,’ said Li Wan. ‘I can’t go in person, unfortunately, because I am ill myself. Don’t
worry about anything here. I’ll send someone to look after your apartment while you
are away. Do come back soon, though, or I shall be blamed for your going.’
‘Whyever should you be?’ said Bao-chai. ‘There’s noth?ing unusual about my going.
You are not being asked to connive at a gaol-break. And incidentally, I don’t see why
it should be necessary to send anyone to my apartment. Why not simply invite
Cousin Shi to stay with you for a few days? Wouldn’t that be simpler?’
‘While we are on the subject, where is Cousin Shi?’ said You-shi.
‘I sent her off just now to look for Cousin Tan,’ said Bao-?chai. ‘She was to bring
Cousin Tan here so that I could explain to her about going to Mother’s too.’
By coincidence ‘Miss Shi and Miss Tan’ were at that very moment announced. As
soon as they were seated, Bao-chai told Tan-chun about her intention of moving
outside for a few days to look after her mother.
‘Very wise,’ said Tan-chun. ‘But why only stay outside until Aunt is better? Why not
move outside altogether?’
‘That’s rather a strange way to talk,’ said You-shi, laughing. ‘It’s as though you
wanted to drive our kinswoman out.’
‘Well, why not?’ said Tan-chun bitterly. ‘Better be driven out now by me than by
someone else later on. Kinsfolk are lucky. They don’t have to stay here. Not like the
members of this happy family - all glaring at each other like angry fighting-cocks,
wondering which will be the first one to strike!’
You-shi laughed.
‘I think today must be my unlucky day. I seem to have caught all you young ladies in
a thoroughly unpleasant mood.’
‘If you don’t like the heat, you should stay away from the fire,’ said Tan-chun.
‘Who’s been upsetting you then?’ She thought for a bit. ‘It’s not likely to have been
Cousin Feng. Not this time. So who was it?’
You-shi’s vague answer evaded the question. Tan-chun knew that she was afraid to
speak openly for fear of causing trouble.
‘Come on!’ she said tauntingly. ‘Don’t act the innocent! It’s not high treason to tell
us. No one’s going to chop your head off. Look at me. Last night I slapped Wang
Shan-bao’s wife’s face. That’s an offence deserving hard labour at the very least, yet
nothing’s happened so far, bar a bit of muttering. I don’t think anyone is going to give
me a beating.’
‘Did you really slap her face?’ Bao-chai asked incredulously.
Tan-chun treated them all to a lively account of what had happened, after which
You-shi, seeing that there was no longer any point in concealment, proceeded to tell
them about her recent encounter with Xi-chun.
‘Oh, she’s always like that,’ said Tan-chun. ‘It’s her nature. Xi-chun is so peculiar,
nothing the rest of us say or do is ever going to alter her. By the way’ - she returned
to the subject that was uppermost in her mind - ‘I made some in?quiries first thing
this morning to find out why nothing was happening. Apparently it’s because Cousin
Feng is ill again. I also sent someone to inquire about Wang Shan-bao’s wife. It seems
that she has been given a beating. For interfering.’
‘Quite right, too!’ said You-shi and Li Wan. But Tan?-chun took a more cynical view.
‘It would be a comparatively easy way of disarming suspicion. We must wait and
see.’
You-shi and Li Wan looked thoughtful, but neither made any comment.
Shortly after this the maids came in to say that dinner was ready. Xiang-yun and
Bao-chai went back to their apart?ment to pack, in preparation for their respective
moves. Our narrative leaves them at this point.
You-shi and Tan-chun, after taking their leave of Li Wan, made their way to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The old lady was reclining on her couch listening,
while Lady Wang told her about the Zhens: the offences they had been charged with,
the confiscation of their property and their coming up to the capital now for
questioning. Grand?mother Jia was obviously much shaken by what she heard, but
brightened up somewhat when You-shi and Tan-chun arrived.
‘Where have you both come from?’ she asked them. ‘I suppose you know that Feng
and Wan are both ill now? I wonder how they are today.’
‘They are both a little better,’ said You-shi.
Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed.
‘I think we’ve heard enough about other people’s troubles for the time being. It’s
time we started thinking about the arrangements for our Mid-Autumn party.’
‘The catering arrangements have all been made,’ said Lady Wang. ‘It only remains
for you to decide where you want it. I suppose the nights are getting too chilly now
for us to have it out in the Garden.’
‘We can always put on a bit more clothing,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Of course we
must have it in the Garden. That’s what the Garden is for.’
While they were speaking, some of the women came in carrying the dinner-table
between them. Lady Wang and You-shi laid chopsticks and carried in the rice. When
all was ready, Grandmother noticed that in addition to her own dishes there were
two large food-boxes containing dishes from the other apartments. It was a
long-established custom that the occupants of other apartments should send her
samples of what they were planning to eat that day themselves as a way of showing
her their respect.
‘I’ve told you all a number of times to stop doing this,’ she said. ‘Why won’t you
ever do as I say?’
‘These are only very ordinary things here,’ said Lady Wang, referring to her own
contribution. ‘It’s one of my fast-days today, so I have only vegetarian dishes. I know
you don’t much like bean-curd fried in batter, which is one of the things I am having.
The only thing of mine I think you might like is a salad pickle of chopped
water-mallow in pepper sauce.’
‘That sounds rather nice,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I think I’d like to try some of that.’
Faithful quickly took the saucer containing it out of the box and put it down in front
of her. Bao-qin, having first apologized to each of her seniors for sitting down in their
presence, took her place at one side of the table. Grandmother Jia said that Tan-chun
should eat with her as well, where?upon Tan-chun too made her apologies and sat
down. She sat at the other side of the table opposite Bao-qin. Scribe quickly fetched
her a bowl and chopsticks. Meanwhile Faithful was pointing out the other dishes to
Grandmother Jia.
‘I can’t make out what these two here are. They are from Sir She. The stuff in this
bowl is creamed chicken and bamboo. It’s from Mr Zhen.’
She brought the bowl of sliced bamboo-shoot over and put it down on the table.
Grandmother Jia made a couple of dips into it with her chopsticks. She ordered all
the other dishes to be taken back to their senders.
‘Tell them thank you very much I’ve tried some, but not to send things to me any
more. If I ever want anything, I shall let them know.’
The women made some reply and went off with the boxes.
‘Now bring me my rice-gruel and I’ll have a bit of that,’ said Grandmother Jia.
You-shi stepped forward with a bowl of gruel. It was made with red ‘Emperor’ rice,
she told her. After drinking about half of it, Grandmother Jia ordered the other half to
be taken to Xi-feng. She pointed to one of the dishes.
‘And this is for Patience.’ She turned to You-shi. ‘I’ve finished. Now you can eat.’
‘Thank you,’ said You-shi, but waited all the same until the old lady had rinsed her
mouth and washed her hands and was walking up and down on Lady Wang’s arm for
her digestion before she ‘begged to be seated’. By this time Bao?qin and Tan-chun
had finished eating. They got up as You?-shi sat down, excusing themselves from
keeping her company while she ate.
‘Oh,’ said You-shi, ‘I’m not used to eating at a big table like this all on my own.’
‘Faithful and Amber can eat with you for company,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Good!’ said You-shi. ‘I was about to suggest that.’
‘I like to see people eating together,’ said Grandmother Jia. She pointed to Butterfly.
‘Now here’s a good girl. Why shouldn’t she eat with you as well? Go on, child! Go and
eat with your mistress. As long as you are here with me, it doesn’t matter if you
break the rules for once.’
‘Come on!’ said You-shi to the maid encouragingly. ‘Don’t pretend to be bashful!’
Grandmother Jia stopped walking up and down and stood with her hands clasped
behind her back to watch them eat. It suddenly struck her that the rice being served
was the plain white rice normally eaten by the servants and that You-shi, too, was
eating it.


‘Why are you giving Mrs Zhen this stuff?’ she asked them.
‘There isn’t any of Your Old Ladyship’s rice left,’ said the maids. ‘You had an extra
young lady eating with you today, don’t forget.’
‘Meals are made to measure nowadays,’ said Faithful. ‘We can’t afford to be
extravagant the way we used to be.’
‘There have been so many floods and droughts during the past few years,’ said Lady
Wang. ‘Our farms haven’t been able to make up their quotas. These special kinds of
rice are particularly hard to come by. We have had to start rationing them rather
carefully.’
‘Even the cleverest housewife can’t make rice-gruel without rice.’ Grandmother Jia
quoted the proverb amidst general laughter.
Faithful turned to address the women waiting outside the door.
‘If Her Old Ladyship’s rice is all finished, you can get the rice that Miss Tan would
have eaten if she hadn’t been eating with us and bring it here for Mrs Zhen.’
‘No need,’ said You-shi. ‘What I’ve got here is quite enough for me.’
‘I dare say it is,’ said Faithful, ‘but what about me?’
The women hurried off to fetch the rice.
Presently Lady Wang went off to have dinner in her own apartment, leaving You-shi
to entertain Grandmother Jia. The time passed quickly, with much good-humoured
teasing and laughter, and the first watch had already begun before Grandmother Jia
noticed how late it was getting.
‘You’d better be getting back now,’ she told You-shi.
You-shi took her leave. Outside the inner gate she got into her waiting carriage. Her
women pulled the blind down, then, taking all the maids with them except Butterfly,
who was riding in the carriage with her mistress, hurried on ahead so that they could
be waiting for You-shi when she arrived in the other mansion. The men from both
gates walked some way along the street to keep it clear of pedestrians while six or
seven pages pushed and pulled the carriage (it seemed too short a distance and too
late an hour for mules) as far as the interior of the Ning-guo gateway. There the
pages retired, old women came forward and raised the blind, and Butterfly
dismounted and helped out her mistress. You-shi noticed that there were four or five
large carriages waiting below the stone lions which flanked the gate and commented
to Butterfly on their presence.
‘I wonder how many horses there are in the stables? If this number came by
carriage, you may be sure that a much greater number will have come on horseback.’
As she and Butterfly entered the outer courtyard, Jia Rong’s wife at the head of a
party of maids and older women carrying lanterns advanced to meet them.
‘I’ve been dying for I don’t know how long to have a look at the men while they are
gambling,’ said You-shi, ‘but so far I haven’t had an opportunity. Tonight is the best
chance I shall ever get. Let’s go along the wall in front of the windows so that we can
peep in at them.’
The women with lanterns made a detour towards the building in which the men
were congregated. One of them went ahead and warned the pages waiting outside
not to announce their arrival to the men or make any other noise that would warn
those inside of their coming. You-shi and her party were thus able to steal right up to
the windows and could hear everything that was going on inside. Among the medley
of sounds that met their ears, numbers seemed to predominate, some uttered
exultantly and with raucous shouts of laughter, others angrily or despairingly and to
the accompaniment of curses and profanities.
Cousin Zhen had found the ban on amusements during the seemingly interminable
period of mourning for Jia Jing which convention imposed on him extremely irksome.
Archery, for some reason, was permitted, and a few months previously he had hit on
archery as a means of getting round the ban. A number of young men from the
wealthy and aristocratic households of his acquaintance were invited round to the
Ning-guo mansion to participate. Shooting was to be competitive.
‘Random shooting is quite useless,’ he explained to them. ‘You not only don’t make
any progress; it actually spoils your form. You’ve got to have incentives of some kind
to keep you on your toes, and the best way of doing that is to bet on something.’
Butts were set up in the shooting gallery below the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion and
every day after lunch the young men came along to compete. Since, as Bereaved Son,
it would have been unseemly for Cousin Zhen himself to have been named in this
connection, the nominal convenor and organ?izer of these gatherings was Jia Rong.
All those invited were rich, profligate, dashing young fellows, accustomed to
spend?ing their time in cock-fighting, dog-racing and even more questionable
amusements. After some discussion it was decided that the responsibility for
providing dinner after the day’s archery should fall to each one of them in turn. It
became a point of honour to make these dinners as lavish as possible, so that the
daily junketings at Ning-guo House came more and more to resemble the Diet of
Lintong in the well-known play of that name, except that whereas Duke Mu’s princely
guests competed in the bravery of their com?manders and the magnificence of their
regalia, it was in the skill of their chefs and in masterpieces of culinary art that the
members of the Ning-guo archery club strove to outdo each other.
When this had been going on for a couple of weeks or so, Jia Zheng and Jia She got to
hear about it. The report that reached them cannot have been a very accurate one,
however, for, far from being critical of these goings-on, they spoke of them with
approval.
‘Since Rong obviously has no aptitude for book-learning,’ Jia Zheng observed,
‘Cousin Zhen does right to encourage him in the martial arts. The boy does, after all,
hold a military commission.
They even made Bao-yu, Jia Huan, Jia Cong and Jia Lan participate. The four of them
had to go over every day after lunch and not return until each of them had taken his
turn at the butts.
But it was not of course in the archery that Cousin Zhen was interested. On the
grounds that resting the muscles was an important part of one’s training, he was
soon advocating a little cards or dice in the evenings as a means of relaxation. At first
they played only for drinks, but soon they were play?ing more and more for money;
the time spent on gaming gradually encroached on the time devoted to archery;
betting became more open; and finally, with the formal opening of a ‘bank’ some
three or four months previously, regular, organized gambling for heavy stakes had
become a daily routine. The Ning-guo servants, who grew fat on the pickings, were
delighted with these new arrangements and, anxious that they should go on, if
possible, for ever, took very good care that no one outside the mansion should get to
hear about them.
Lady Xing’s brother, Xing De-quan, himself a keen gambler, had lately become a
frequenter of this establish?ment; so, inevitably, had Xue Pan, who was never so
happy as when he was throwing away his money.
Xing De-quan was very unlike his sister. Drinking, gambling and debauchery were his
only interests; consequently whenever any money came into his hands, he spent it
like water. The singular obtuseness he showed in all his dealings had earned him the
nickname of ‘Uncle Dumbo’. And since Xue Pan was already known to all and sundry
as ‘the Oaf King’, the two of them when they were together were referred to by the
young men as ‘Uncle Dumbo and Cousin Oaf’.
The situation when You-shi peeped inside was as follows. Cousin Oaf and Uncle
Dumbo, each with a partner, were playing six-dice Grabs on the kang in the outer
room. Simultaneously another dicing game, Driving the Sheep, was being played by
several players sitting round a large table on the floor below. The inner room, where
a slightly more intellectual group were playing Tin Kau, was devoted to dominoes.
The servants were all pages of fifteen or under. There was also a pair of male
prostitutes, powdered, over-dressed youths of seventeen or eighteen, whose duty
was to ply the guests with drink. It was this pair who first caught You-shi’s eye when
she looked in.
Xue Pan had been having the sulks earlier on because he was losing, but then his luck
had changed: he had not only recouped his losses but made a lot of extra money. He
was therefore in a very good mood indeed. Cousin Zhen sug?gested that this might
be a good point at which to stop and have dinner. They could go on playing
afterwards if they wanted to.
‘What about the two other lots?’ he inquired.
It transpired that the Tin Kau players in the next room were in process of settling up
after finishing the game and were in fact beginning to think about their dinner, but
that the group at the big table playing Driving the Sheep had not yet reached a
suitable point at which to break off. Cousin Zhen ordered dinner to be served for all
those, himself included, who were ready. Jia Rong was to wait and have dinner with
the other players when they had finished.
Xue Pan, elated by his success, sat with a cup of wine in one hand and his arm round
the shoulders of one of the pretty pot-boys. With a victor’s expansive generosity he
ordered the other boy to pour some wine ‘with his compliments’ for Uncle Dumbo.
But Uncle Dumbo was thoroughly out of temper at having lost the game, and the two
cupfuls he drank now in rapid succession served merely to make him tipsily
aggressive. He vented his anger on the two young ganymedes, who, he claimed, had
treacherously withdrawn their favours from him and transferred them to the winner.
‘Heartless brood of unnatural little whore’s gits!’ he grumbled. ‘You’ve had plenty
of favours off me in the past - and off everyone else here. Now, just because I’ve lost
a few taels, I’m not good enough for you. What makes you so certain you won’t ever
need my help again in the future?’
The other guests all knew that he was drunk. Those of them who were losers
themselves smiled wryly and said nothing, but one or two of the winners
magnanimously expressed their sympathy.
‘That’s right, Uncle. Rotten little bastards! That’s just the way they do behave.’
‘Why don’t you pour Uncle a drink and tell him you’re sorry?’ said another of them.
The two young ganymedes, practised professionals in every trick of the trade, were
on their knees at Uncle Dumbo’s side in a moment, offering him wine, fondling his
thigh, and gazing with simpering archness into his eyes.
‘Don’t be angry with us, dear old friend. We are only children. We have to do as we
are told. Our teacher always tells us, “It doesn’t matter what they are like or what
your own feelings are, the person who at any moment has the most money is the
one you must be nice to.” Just win a lot of money later on this evening, old friend,
and you’ll see how nice we shall be to you!’
The disarming frankness of this made everyone laugh. Even Uncle Dumbo, though he
tried hard not to, was forced to join in.
‘All right, I forgive you,’ he growled as he took the proffered winecup. ‘Though I
don’t mind telling you, if I hadn’t been so fond of you two, I’d have kicked the stuffing
out of your little tum-tums!’
He shot his foot up as he said this, by way of demonstration. The two boys scrambled
to their feet in mock alarm. Each of them carried a long woman’s handkerchief of
flowered silk. With mincing gestures, still holding their handkerchiefs in their hands,
they guided the winecup towards his lips. Uncle Dumbo’s loud gurgles of delight
were briefly interrupted while he threw his head back and drained the cup. Then, still
laughing, he pinched their cheeks.
‘Little dears!’ he said. ‘How I loves them!’
His mood changed abruptly as he remembered a grievance. He smote the table
angrily and glared at Cousin Zhen.
‘I had a quarrel with your Uncle She’s wife yesterday, did you know that?’
‘With Aunt Xing?’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘No, I hadn’t heard that.’
Uncle Dumbo sighed self-pityingly.
‘About damned money, as usual. You don’t know the history of our Xing family,
dear boy. When my old mother died, I was still too young to know what was going on.
I have three elder sisters. The eldest is your precious aunt. When your aunt married,
she took everything we had with her. Everything. My second sister had to marry
without a dowry. She and her husband are paupers. My third sister is still unmarried.
She lives on a pittance paid out to her by that old whore, Wang Shan-bao’s wife, who
has charge of all our money. Well, I went along yesterday to ask her for a few coppers.
Not Jia money, mind you: our Xing money is good enough for me. But would she give
me any? Not she! And that’s the reason why I get treated by you lot like a poor
relation.’
Cousin Zhen knew that he was drunk, but as it was embarrassing that these
unsavoury details of family history should be paraded in front of outsiders, he did his
best to mollify Uncle Dumbo and get him onto another tack.
All this was clearly audible to You-shi outside.
‘Did you hear that?’ she whispered to Butterfly, who was standing beside her.
‘That’s Lady Xing they’re talking about. If her own brother talks about her in that way,
you can hardly wonder that other people complain about her.’
She would have said more, but checked herself in order to attend to what was going
on inside. The group playing Driving the Sheep had now broken off and were calling
for wine.
‘Who was upsetting Uncle Dumbo just now?’ asked one of them. ‘We couldn’t
quite catch what it was about. Tell us what happened, Uncle, and we’ll see you get
fair play.’
Uncle Dumbo proceeded to tell them how the two boys had forsaken him because he
had no money.
‘Good grief!’ said the young man who had asked the question. ‘I don’t blame you
for being angry - What do you mean by it?’ he asked the boys. ‘He’s only lost a bit of
money, hasn’t he? He hasn’t lost his prick!’
The company roared with laughter. Uncle Dumbo’s mouthful of rice was spattered
over half the floor.
‘You dirty bugger!’ he said. ‘Can’t you open your mouth without being crude?’
You-shi gave a little snort of disgust.
‘Just listen to those animals! By the time they’ve swilled a few more cups of wine,
heaven knows what filth they’ll be coming out with!’
She moved on her way - having seen and heard quite as much as she wanted to -
returned to her apartment, un?dressed, and went to bed. Cousin Zhen did not get to
bed until after two. He spent what remained of the night in Lovey’s room.
As soon as he was up next morning, someone came in with a message to say that the
melons and mooncakes he had ordered were now ready and it only remained for him
to say who they were to be sent to.
‘Ask your mistress to see to it,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I have got other business to
attend to.’
Lovey took this message to You-shi, who proceeded to go through the list deciding
how much should go to whom and making arrangements for the delivery. She had
barely finished doing this when Lovey came back again with another message.
‘The master wants to know if you are going out today, madam. He says we can’t
keep Mid-Autumn properly on the fifteenth because we are in mourning still, but
there would be no harm in having a little family party tonight.’
‘I don’t want to go out,’ said You-shi, ‘but with Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian both ill in bed,
I don’t see how I can refuse to go next door and lend a hand.’
‘The master says, if you have to go out, will you at any rate try to get back as early
as you can?’ said Lovey.
‘Better hurry up with the lunch then,’ said You-shi. ‘The sooner I can get away, the
sooner I’ll be back.’
‘The master’s having lunch in the front today, madam. He says please have your
lunch here without him.’
‘Who’s he got there?’ said You-shi.
‘Somebody told me it’s two people just arrived from Nan-king,’ said Lovey, ‘but I
don’t know who they are.’
Jia Rong’s wife came in while Lovey was talking. Shortly after that lunch was served.
After lunch, You-shi changed into her going-out clothes and went over to Rong-guo
House. She did not return until evening.
While she was away, Cousin Zhen went ahead with arrange?ments for an intimate
family party. He had a whole pig boiled, a whole sheep roasted, and an infinite
number of vegetable dishes and entremets prepared. When You-shi got back that
evening, he conducted her and the little con?cubines and Jia Rong and Jia Rong’s wife
to the Bosky Verdure Pavilion where it was all laid out. This was in the All-Scents
Garden, as they continued to call the little rem?nant still left them after the main
part was incorporated in Prospect Garden.
They had dinner first. The wine was brought in after they had finished eating, so that
they could apply themselves single-mindedly to games and mirth and the enjoyment
of the Mid-Autumn moon, which now (for by this time it was already the beginning
of the first watch) shone brightly in a clear, fresh sky, filling the world above and
below with its silver light. Cousin Zhen invited the four little concubines to sit at the
same table as him and You-shi and join with them in games of Plumstones and
Guess-fingers. Presently – for the drink was beginning to make him sentimental - he
called to them for some music, and Flower sang for them in a clear, sweet voice,
accompanied by Lovey on the vertical bamboo flute. Everyone was deeply moved by
the perform?ance. After it was over the games continued.
The hours slipped by. Soon it was nearly midnight. Cousin Zhen was by now more
than a little drunk. They had all just put on some extra clothes and had some hot tea;
the wine-cups had been cleared and clean ones put in their place and a fresh lot of
newly heated wine was just being poured, when suddenly a long-drawn-out sigh was
heard from the foot of one of the garden walls. It was heard by all of them, quite
clearly and unmistakably, and they could feel the hair on their scalps rise as they
listened to it.
‘Who’s there?’ Cousin Zhen shouted in a voice that he tried to make fierce and
challenging. But though he repeated the question several times, there was no reply.
‘It’s probably one of the servants,’ said You-shi.
‘Nonsense!’ snapped Cousin Zhen. ‘There are no servants living behind any of these
walls. In any case, that’s the Hall of the Ancestors over there. What would anyone be
doing behind that wall?’
A rustle of wind passed, at that very moment, along the foot of it and a distant sound
like the opening and closing of a door could be heard from inside the ancestral
temple. An oppressive feeling of dread came over them; the night air seemed
suddenly to have grown colder; the moon appeared less bright than it had been a
few minutes before; and they could feel their skins crawling with terror.
Shock had made Cousin Zhen almost sober; but though he managed to keep better
control of himself than the others, he was very much shaken and had lost all appetite
for enjoy?ment. Nevertheless he forced himself and the others to sit a little longer
before retiring finally to bed.
He rose quite early next morning. It was the fifteenth, one of the two days in each
month on which offerings have to be made to the ancestors. Entering the ancestral
temple with the other male members of the family, he took the opportunity of
looking round inside it very carefully; but everything was as it should be; there was
no sign whatever of anything untoward having happened. He put down the previous
night’s terror to the effects of drunkenness - a mild attack of the horrors - and
resolved to make no further mention of it. When the service was over, he shut the
temple up again and made sure that the doors were securely locked and barred.
*
After dinner that evening Cousin Zhen went over with You?-shi to Rong-guo House.
He found Jia She and Jia Zheng in Grandmother Jia’s room. The two of them were
sitting on the kang, talking and laughing with the old lady, while Jia Lian, Bao-yu, Jian
Huan and Jia Lan stood on the floor below. After greeting them and exchanging a
word or two with each of them in turn, he sat, or rather half-sat, in polite discomfort,
on a stool next to the door. Grandmother Jia vouchsafed a gracious smile in his
direction.
     ‘How is your Cousin Bao’s archery these days?’
Cousin Zhen jumped to his feet to reply.
‘Greatly improved, Lady Jia. It isn’t only his form that is better; he is beginning to
handle the bow with much greater strength.’
‘That’s the point at which to stop then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We don’t want him
straining himself.’
‘No, no, certainly not,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I quite agree.’
‘Those mooncakes you sent yesterday were very good,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The
melons looked all right, but there’s not much inside them when you cut them open.’
‘Those mooncakes are good, aren’t they?’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘They were made by
our new pastry-cook. I tried them myself to make sure they were all right before
venturing to send you any. As for the melons: we’ve been lucky in previous years, but
for some reason none of them this year seem to be any good.’
‘I think we must blame the weather,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘The rains this year were
excessive.
‘The moon must be up by now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s go and make our
Mid-Autumn offering.’
She got up and, leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, led the way into the Garden. The main
gate was wide open and hung with great horn lanterns. When they reached Prospect
Hall, they found servants with lighted lamps waiting for them on the terrace and a
table on which incense smoked in a square container and on which offerings of
melons and other fruit and mooncakes had been set out on dishes. Lady Xing and all
the other female members of the family were waiting inside the hall.
  Moonlight and lanterns gleaming pale
Through a thin aromatic veil –
It was indeed a scene of indescribable beauty. A carpet for kneeling on had been laid
on the terrace at the foot of the table on the side nearest the hall. Grandmother Jia
washed her hands, lit some sticks of incense, knelt down on the carpet, bowed down,
and offered up the incense. The others followed her example.
‘The best place for enjoying the moon from is the top of a hill,’ she told them when
they had finished. She suggested the pavilion on the summit of the ‘master
mountain’ behind Reunion Palace (of which Prospect Hall was a part) as the place to
have their party. The servants at once went off to make it ready. Meanwhile
Grandmother Jia sat talking with the others inside Prospect Hall, resting and drinking
tea. Presently the servants came back to report that the mountain-top pavilion was
now ready. The old lady stood up again and, supported on either side by her maids,
prepared to make the ascent.
‘I’m afraid the moss on the steps might make them rather slippery,’ said Lady Wang.
‘Wouldn’t it be better if you went up in a chair?’
‘The servants sweep them every day,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How can there be any
moss? They are good, level steps and not too steep. The exercise will be good for
me.’
Jia She and Jia Zheng led the way, followed by a couple of old women with horn
lanterns. Faithful, Amber and You-shi supported the old lady on either side, and Lady
Xing, Lady Wang and all the others followed in a close procession behind. It was only
a hundred or so steps up the zig-zag path to the summit.
The pavilion was a rectangular building with one completely open side looking onto a
terrace. Because it was situated on the convex grassy summit of the little ‘mountain’,
it was called Convex Pavilion. Two tables with chairs round them had been set out on
the terrace, separated from each other by a large screen. The tables and chairs, like
the moon and melons and mooncakes, were all round, in honour of the occasion.
Grandmother Jia sat at the head of one of the tables with Jia She, Cousin Zhen, Jia
Lian and Jia Rong on her left hand and Jia Zheng, Bao-yu, Jia Huan and Jia Lan on her
right. Between them they filled only about half the places round the table.
‘I never felt in the past on these occasions that we were a small family,’
Grandmother Jia commented. ‘Looking at us today, though, I must say we do make a
very miserable turn?out. I can remember Mid-Autumns when there were thirty or
forty of us sitting down together. Ah, what times we had then! We shan’t ever have
numbers like that again. Let’s have the girls to sit with us. See if we can’t fill up that
gap!’
Someone went over to the table presided over by Lady Xing on the other side of the
screen to fetch Ying-chun, Tan?-chun and Xi-chun. Jia Lian, Jia Rong, Bao-yu and the
other boys got up while the chairs were rearranged and the girls were installed at the
table. Then they reseated themselves in their proper order, Jia Lian and Jia Rong with
Ying-chun and Xi-chun between them, and Bao-yu and Jia Huan on either side of
Tan-chun.
Grandmother Jia asked someone to fetch a spray of cassia and made one of the
women sit behind the screen and drum for them, so that they could play Passing the
Branch. Anyone whose hand the branch was in when the drumming stopped had first
to drink a cup of wine and then tell a funny story. The drumming started and the
branch passed from Grandmother Jia to Jia She and so on round the table. It stopped
just as the branch had reached Jia Zheng’s hand on its second time round. He raised
the winecup to his lips to the accom?paniment of much secret nudging and pinching
among the younger folk, to whom the notion of Jia Zheng telling a joke was in itself
unbelievably funny.
Jia Zheng could see how much the old lady was enjoying herself and was anxious not
to spoil her pleasure. Before he could begin his story, however, she saw fit to give
him notice that he must expect to be punished if he did not make her laugh.
‘I can only think of one joke,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If you don’t find it amusing, you will
just have to punish me.’
‘Very well, tell us your one joke then,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘It is about a hen-pecked husband,’ said Jia Zheng.
He got no further. Already his audience were convulsed. It was not that what he had
said was the least bit funny, simply that they had never heard him talking about such
things before.
‘This is sure to be good,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘In that case,’ said Jia Zheng, laughing himself, ‘let me persuade you to drink a cup
of wine.’
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia.
At once Jia She and Jia Zheng rose to their feet. Jia She held a winecup in both his
hands while Jia Zheng poured wine into it from a wine-kettle. Then Jia Zheng took
the cup from Jia She and ceremoniously set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. The
two men stood in stiffly deferential attitudes beside her while she drank some, then,
having completed their little pantomime, resumed their places.
Jia Zheng proceeded with his story.
‘This hen-pecked husband was so afraid of his wife that he never dared stay long
away from the house. But one Mid-Autumn Festival he chanced to be out shopping
in the street when a friend caught sight of him and insisted on dragging him off to his
house for a drink. Without meaning to, the husband became very drunk - so much so
that he had to stay at his friend’s house for the night. When he woke up the next
morning, he was full of remorse. However, there was nothing for it but to hurry back
home and apologize. When he got back, his wife was washing her feet.
“‘Very well,” she said when he had finished apologizing, “if you will lick my feet
clean, I will forgive you.”
‘The man began to lick, but a feeling of nausea overcame him and he showed signs
of wanting to be sick. When his wife saw this, she was furious.
“‘How dare you?” she screamed, and looked as if she was about to give him a
beating.
‘The husband knelt down in terror and begged to be forgiven.
“‘Please, my dear! It isn’t that I find your feet in the least distasteful. It’s just that I
drank rather a lot of yellow wine last night and ate lots of very rich mooncakes, so
today I am feeling a little queasy.”’
Grandmother Jia and the rest all laughed and Jia Zheng poured Grandmother Jia
another cup of wine.
‘Someone had better change this yellow wine for samshoo,’ she said. ‘We don’t
want you husbands having this sort of trouble with your wives tomorrow!’
        This produced another laugh.
        The drumming recommenced and the branch, starting from Jia Zheng, began
circulating again. This time it stopped with Bao-yu. Bao-yu had been feeling
uncomfortable to start with because of Jia Zheng’s presence, but became ten times
more so when he found himself stuck with the branch.
      ‘If I tell a joke and it’s no good,’ he thought, ‘he will say I’ve no invention. But if I
tell a good one, he’ll say I have no aptitude for serious things, only frivolous ones,
and that will be even worse. I’d much better not tell one at all.’
      Having reached this decision, he stood up and asked his father to excuse him.
      ‘I’m sorry,’ he said, ‘I can’t tell jokes. May I do something else, please?’
      ‘You may compose a poem on the theme of “Mid-Autumn Moon”,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘If it is good, I shall reward you; if it is not - I shall deal with you tomorrow.’
      ‘This is a game we are playing,’ said Grandmother Jia testily. ‘Do you have to
make the boy write poetry?’
‘He can do it if he wants to,’ said Jia Zheng. He was smiling.
‘Very well, let him do it then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Fetch him a brush and. paper
somebody.’
‘No padding, now!’ Jia Zheng told Bao-yu. ‘No “crystal”, “ice”, “jade”, “silver”, “light”,
“bright”, “white” - anything of that sort. I want something original that will give me
some idea of what you have been doing with your mind during this past year or two.’
Bao-yu found these injunctions by no means uncongenial, and having succeeded, in
quite a short time, in thinking of a quatrain, he wrote it out and handed it to his
father. Jia Zheng said nothing, but was observed to nod after he had finished reading
it, which Grandmother Jia interpreted to mean that he could not have found the
poem too bad.
‘Well?’ she asked him.
Jia Zheng wanted to make her happy.
‘Not at all bad,’ he said. ‘It’s a pity he won’t study, but his verses are really quite
elegant.’
‘Well, that’s all right then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You ought to encourage the boy,
so that next time he tries even harder.’
‘You are quite right,’ said Jia Zheng. He turned to one of the old women in
attendance. ‘Tell my boys to get out two of the fans I brought back with me from the
South, will you, and give them to Bao-yu for me.’
Bao-yu came forward and kotowed. After he had gone back to his seat, the game
continued. This time the branch stop?ped in Jia She’s hand. He drank his wine and
then told the following story.
‘This one is about a dutiful son whose mother was ill. He tried everywhere to get a
doctor for her, but couldn’t find one, so in the end he was reduced to calling in an old
woman who practised acupuncture. Now this old dame knew nothing of physiology,
nevertheless she assured the son that it was inflammation of the heart that his
mother was suffering from and that she could cure it instantly with her needle. The
son became very alarmed.
“‘If metal in any form comes into contact with the heart,” he said, “it means death.
Surely you’re not going to put a needle in her heart?”
“‘No, no, I shan’t put it in the heart,” said the old woman. “I mean to put it in here,
over the ribs.”
“‘But that’s too far from the heart,” said the son. “Surely if you put it in there, it
won’t do any good?”
“‘Oh yes it will,” said the old woman. “A mother’s heart always inclines towards
one side.”’
The others all laughed, and Grandmother Jia was persuaded to drink another half cup
of wine. After a long pause she said somewhat wryly,
‘Perhaps I could do with a bit of the old dame’s acupuncture myself.’
Jia She realized, too late, that his somewhat tactless choice of story could be
interpreted as a criticism of his own mother. Hurriedly rising to his feet, he held up
his cup to toast her with and did what he could to change the subject. Fortunately
the old lady made no further reference to his gaffe and the game soon continued.
This time the branch stopped with Jia Huan.
Jia Huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies. He was even
beginning to show a certain interest in verse, though his tastes in it were decidedly
peculiar. When Bao-yu’s poem was praised earlier on, he had been dying to
demonstrate his own talent, but had not dared risk the charge of showing off in his
father’s presence. Now that the luck of the game had given him free licence, he
called for paper and writing-brush and, in a matter of moments, wrote out a quatrain
which he handed to his father. Jia Zheng was not impressed. It was a somewhat weird
little poem, and whatever advances Jia Huan might lately have made in his
schoolwork, they certainly did not reveal them?selves in his choice of words.
‘It is easy to see that you and Bao-yu are brothers,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Whether in your
ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound
classical models. The “Two Incomparables” we should call you, not because you are
incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are
incomparably hard to knock any sense into: though whereas Bao-yu seems to think
that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a
second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry
and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang.’
This (not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny) provoked
general laughter.
‘Let me see that poem,’ said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost
immediately began praising it.
‘I like this poem, it’s got guts in it. Boys from families like ours don’t need to read
themselves half blind in order to get started on a career. Provided they’ve read
enough to show that they are better educated than the rabble and are capable of
holding down a job, they can hardly fail to get on. Why waste a lot of time and
energy on turning the boy into a book-worm? What I like about this poem is that it is
just the sort of good amateur, not-too-brainy poem you’d expect a young chap of our
class to write.’
He sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to Jia Huan as a reward and
smilingly patted him on the head.
‘You go on writing poems like this, young fellow! We’ll have no trouble getting you
a posting when the time comes, don’t you worry!’
Jia Zheng protested.
‘Whatever you think of the poem, it hardly justifies talking in this way about the
boy’s future.’
Meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could
continue; but Grandmother Jia intervened.
‘Why don’t you two go now? I’m sure your gentlemen must be waiting for you, and
it would be discourteous to neglect them. Besides, it must be all of ten o’clock and if
you go now it will give the children a chance to enjoy them?selves unconstrainedly
for a while before they go to bed.’
The two brothers at once got up to go, and after a parting cup offered to them on
behalf of all the rest, they went off, taking Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian with them, but
leaving Bao?yu and the two younger boys with the womenfolk.
What happened after their departure will be related in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 76

Flute-playing at Convex Pavilion provokes
too much melancholy
And linked verses at Concave Pavilion betray
a morbid sensitivity



After Jia She and Jia Zheng had left, taking the two younger men with them,
Grandmother Jia had the screen removed and proposed that those sitting at both
tables should combine to make a single party. The serving-women cleared and wiped
the table, replenished and replaced the plates of foodstuff, and set out clean
winecups and chopsticks. While they were doing this, Grandmother Jia and the other
members of the family were putting on more clothing, washing their hands; rinsing
their mouths out, and drinking tea. When all was ready they arranged themselves
round the one table. As they did so, Grandmother Jia noticed, for the first time that
evening, that Bao-chai and Bao-qin were not there. With Li Wan and Xi-feng also
away ill, the family gathering seemed sadly depleted. She commented on this fact to
Lady Wang.
‘In past years, when Sir Zheng was away, we invited your sister to enjoy the
Mid-Autumn moon with us. To be sure, we had some very happy times with her, but
the recollection that one of our dear ones was missing - in my case a son, in yours a
husband, in the children’s a father somewhat dampened our enjoyment. This year,
now that he is back, I was looking forward to a really jolly family party; but now,
unfortunately, it’s your sister and her children who can’t be with us. Well, I suppose
as she’s got two more members of her family with her this year we could hardly
expect her to leave them behind and come over here simply to keep me amused. But
what a pity that Feng should have chosen this time to be ill! She is always such a
tonic as good as ten other people at a party! It only goes to show. One can’t have
everything.’
She sighed.
‘Fetch me a bigger cup,’ she said presently, ‘and pour me some good hot wine.’
Lady Wang smiled.
‘You have both your sons with you this year, Mother. Surely that is a gain? There
may have been more females present in previous years, but surely having all your
own children about you is better?’
‘Yes, yes, of course it is,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I am happy. That is why I have asked
for a larger cup. You must all have larger cups too.’
It was getting very late now and the other ladies had no real inclination for carousing;
but as Grandmother Jia showed no signs of flagging, they were obliged to keep her
company. The effect of forcing themselves to drink with her was that they became
unbearably sleepy.
Grandmother Jia called for a carpet to be spread out at the top of the terrace steps.
The remaining mooncakes, melons and other eatables were carried over there and
the maids and womenservants invited to sit round in a big circle, eating them and
enjoying the moon.
Grandmother Jia, too, looked up at the moon. It had now reached its meridian and
was even clearer and more beautiful than it had been earlier in the evening.
‘To get full enjoyment of so fine a moon,’ she said, ‘the music of a flute is
indispensable.’
She had the girls of the family’s little ten-piece orchestra summoned; but when they
arrived, they were informed that not all of them would be required to play.
‘Too much sound would spoil the effect,’ she said. ‘The flute on its own will be
enough. And we should like to hear it from quite a long way away.’
The flautist went off obediently to do her bidding. A moment after she had left, one
of Lady Xing’s women came hurrying up and whispered something in Lady Xing’s ear.
‘What is it?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘It’s Sir She,’ said Lady Xing. ‘On his way back just now he tripped over a rock and
twisted his ankle.’
Grandmother Jia at once sent two of her own women to see how he was and told
Lady Xing that she was to go back immediately and look after him. Lady Xing rose and
took her leave.
‘Zhen’s wife may as well go back now too,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Then I shall go
home to bed.’
‘I don’t intend to go back at all tonight,’ said You-shi. ‘I have resolved to spend the
night here with you.’
‘That will never do!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing. ‘Tonight of all nights a young
couple like you ought to be together. I can’t have you staying away from your
husband for my sake!’
You-shi coloured.
‘Really, Grandma, what a thing to say! I suppose Zhen and I are still comparatively
young, but we have been married nearly twenty years, you know: we are both nearly
forty. And in any case, we’re still in mourning for Sir Jing. I’d much better spend the
night here with you.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’d quite forgotten you were still in mourning.
Poor Sir Jing! It must be more than two years now - but I ought not to have forgotten.
I shall drink this big cupful as a punishment! All right, you’d better stay and keep me
company then. Let Rong’s wife see Lady Xing out. After that, she can go back home
herself.’
You-shi instructed her daughter-in-law accordingly, where?upon little Hu-shi
accompanied Lady Xing as far as the main gate of the mansion. There both ladies got
into their carriages and went their separate ways.
Meanwhile the company had been over to the other side of the terrace to admire the
cassia. They now took their places at table once more and were served with freshly
heated wine.
In the midst of their chattering and laughter, suddenly startling them into silence, the
undulant, lamenting sound of a flute came floating up to them from the cassia-trees
below. Beautiful at any time, such music heard in the stillness of the night under the
great vault of the sky with a bright moon above and only the cold, invisible night
wind stirring in the earth below steals like a balm over the soul, soothing and
dissolving all earthly griefs and cares. They listened, rapt and silent, with upturned,
attentive faces. The music continued for about the space in which one could
comfortably have drunk two cups of tea and then stopped. The momentary silence
which followed it was broken by cries of admiration from all present. The winecups
were replenished with warm wine.
‘You see,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It is good, isn’t it?’
‘It truly is,’ they agreed. ‘Who could have imagined anything so beautiful? If it
weren’t for you, Grandma, we might never have had this experience.’
‘It could have been much better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘To get the full benefit you
need to hear something really slow.’
She had a large cup of wine poured and ordered one of her women to take it to the
flautist.
‘Tell her to take her time with this, and say that when she’s finished drinking it, I’d
like her to play us another piece, only more softly this time.’
While this woman went off with the message and the wine, the two women she had
sent off earlier to inquire after Jia She’s ankle returned.
‘We’ve had a look at Sir She, Your Ladyship. His right ankle is rather swollen, but
he’s taken some medicine and the pain is not so bad now. It doesn’t look very
serious.’
Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed.
‘You see? The truth is, I worry too much. He was trying to make out that I don’t
care about him at all!’
While she was saying this, Faithful appeared carrying a large cape and hood.
‘Here, put these on,’ she said. ‘It’s getting very late. You don’t want to be outside
when the dew falls. Aren’t you afraid of catching cold? I think when you’ve sat a little
longer, you ought to come back home to bed.’
‘Just when I’m enjoying myself you have to start nagging me to go to bed,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘I hope you don’t think I’m drunk. I’ve decided to stay up till dawn.’
She called rebelliously for more wine, but did put the cape and hood on
notwithstanding. The other ladies drank with her for company and did their best to
be amusing. Then, silencing them once more, the sound of the flute concealed in the
cassia-bushes below came stealing into their ears, this time more plaintive even than
before. Indeed, this time the combination of the flute’s melancholy with the effects
of nocturnal stillness and ghostly moonlight induced a feeling of such over?powering
sadness in the listeners that they turned their backs on it and sought, with talk and
somewhat forced laughter, to escape it. Fresh wine was called for and the flautist told
to stop playing.
‘I’ll cheer you up, Lady Jia,’ said You-shi. ‘Let me tell you a funny story. I learnt it
specially for the occasion.’
‘Ha, ha, ha. Yes, that would be very nice, a joke. Do tell me,’ said Grandmother Jia
with a jollity that seemed somewhat strained.
‘There were once four brothers,’ You-shi began. ‘The eldest had only one eye, the
second had only one ear, the third had only one nostril, and the fourth, though he
had all his parts in order, was dumb.’
She had got no farther with her story when she became aware that the old lady’s
head was nodding down upon her bosom and her eyelids drooping as though she
was about to go to sleep. She broke off at once, and she and Lady Wang both called
gently to her to wake up. Grandmother Jia opened her eyes wide and laughed.
‘I’m not sleeping, I was just resting my eyes. Go on with your story. I’m listening.’
‘It’s very late,’ said Lady Wang. ‘The air is cold tonight and there is a lot of dew.
Won’t you go home and rest now, Mother? We can have another moon-party
tomorrow night, if you feel like it. The moon on the sixteenth is still well worth
watching.’
‘What time is it?’ Grandmother Jia asked.
‘Past two o’clock,’ said Lady Wang. ‘The children couldn’t hold out any longer. They
have all gone off to bed.’
Grandmother Jia looked round the table. Only Tan-chun was still sitting there in the
semicircle of empty chairs.
‘Well,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘they are not used to staying up late. Considering the
amount of weakness and sickliness there is among them, I suppose it is just as well.
But there’s my little Tan, sitting there all on her own, poor child! You go to bed too,
my dear. We’ll end the party now.’
She got up herself as she said this, and after taking a sip or two of green tea, climbed
into her bamboo carrying-chair and was borne out of the Garden by two women, the
rest walking beside her or following close behind. But of her and them no more.
One of the women who remained behind to clear the table and stack the crockery
noticed that a single porcelain cup was missing. After looking everywhere for it
unsuccessfully, she appealed to the other servants.
‘I suppose one of you must have dropped it accidentally and thrown it away
somewhere. Do please tell us, and let us have the broken pieces, so that when we
report the loss we shan’t be accused of having stolen it.’
‘None of us has broken it,’ said the others. ‘It might have been a maid of one of the
young ladies that broke it. If you can think who it might have been, I should go and
ask them.’
‘You are right,’ said the woman, suddenly recollecting. ‘I remember Kingfisher
coming to fetch a cup for her mistress. I must go and ask her for it.’
She had not far to look. A short way along the paved path at the bottom of the steps
she came upon her and Nightingale walking along together. It was Kingfisher who
spoke first.
‘Oh, has Her Old Ladyship ended the party then? I suppose you don’t know where
my mistress has gone?’
‘I’ve come to ask you what you’ve done with one of our teacups,’ said the woman,
‘and you ask me about your mistress!’
Kingfisher laughed.
‘I poured out a cup of tea some time ago and handed it to her, and the next thing I
knew was she’d disappeared - with the teacup.’
‘Her Ladyship said just now that the young ladies had all gone to bed,’ said the
woman. ‘I don’t know where you two can have been larking about all this time not to
know anything about it.’
‘I’m sure our mistresses wouldn’t have slipped off to bed without telling us,’ said
Kingfisher. ‘More likely they just went off for a walk. Perhaps when Her Old Ladyship
left they joined the others to see her back to her apartment. We’ll go over there now
and have a look. If they are there, we shall know where your cup is. Why don’t you
come round and ask me for it tomorrow? There’s no pressing hurry for it now, is
there?’
‘There’s no hurry as long as I know where it is,’ said the woman. ‘I’ll call round and
ask you for it tomorrow.’
She went back to the pavilion then, to finish stacking the crockery.
*
Lady Wang was wrong. Dai-yu and Xiang-yun had not gone to bed. The sight of all
those Jias enjoying the moonlight (in spite of Grandmother Jia’s complaint that the
numbers were so few) and the thought of Bao-chai and Bao-qin enjoying a
moon-party of their own with Aunt Xue and the two Xue males made the occasion a
painful one for Dai-yu. She had slipped away not in order to go to bed but to lean on
the terrace railings and cry. Bao-yu on this occasion had little thought for anything
but Skybright’s illness, which had lately taken a serious turn for the worse, and after
several appeals from his mother to go to bed, he had availed himself of the excuse
for going back in order to find out how she was. Tan?chun was still feeling too much
out of temper after the recent domestic upheavals to have any appetite for
amusement. Ying-chun and Xi-chun might have kept Dai-yu company, but since they
did not as a rule get on with her very well, it would not have occurred to them to do
so. That left only Xiang-yun to offer her some comfort.
‘Now coz, this won’t do! You’re an intelligent girl: you must take more care of
yourself. I must say, it is too bad of Chai and Qin. All that talk about spending
Mid-Autumn night enjoying the moon together and using the occasion to revive the
Poetry Club with another linked couplets session - and then, when the time comes,
they leave us in the lurch and go off to enjoy the moon by themselves! No Poetry
Club, no linked couplets, nothing! It’s all the fault of those wretched men! You
remember the remark made by the first Song emperor: “No one but me is allowed to
snore in this bed?room!” That’s the menfolk’s attitude at a party. Never mind. Since
the others haven’t come, we’ll make up some linked couplets ourselves and take
them along tomorrow to shame them with.’
Xiang-yun was so enthusiastic a comforter that Dai-yu felt she could not show herself
wholly unresponsive.
‘The trouble is, all these people here are making so much noise,’ she said. ‘It’s not
an atmosphere very conducive to poetic inspiration.’
‘Although the hilltop is a good place for enjoying the moon from,’ said Xiang-yun,
‘the moon would look even better over water. I don’t know whether you realize it,
but one side of this hill does actually give onto the lake. There is a little building there
called the Concave Pavilion nestling in a hollow quite close to the water’s edge.
Whoever made this Garden must have been quite an educated person. The place
where we are now is obviously called the Convex Pavilion because it is on top of the
convex hill, and Concave Pavilion must have been given its name because it is in a
hollow. Those two words “concave” and “convex” are very seldom encountered in
literature. Their use in landscape gardening for the naming of features must be even
rarer. To my mind the linking together of these two pavilions by so unusual a pair of
names suggests that they must have been specially designed for viewing the moon
from: Convex Pavilion for those who like the small, remote moon of the mountains
and high places, Concave Pavilion for those who prefer the silky whiteness of the
great orb reflected in the surface of the water. “Convex” and “concave” are often
thought of as vulgar, unpoetical words, but that is only because of their modern
associations. Some people even call that well-known line of Lu You’s vulgar:
In well-worn concave patch the ground ink settles;
but I find that criticism rather silly.’
‘Lu You is by no means the only writer to have used those words in a work of
literature,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Jiang Yan uses them in his prose-poem “Moss”, Dong-fang
Shuo uses them somewhere in his Book of Marvels, and in Lives of the Painters they
turn up in a description of Zhang Seng-yao’s decoration of the Ekayāna Monastery at
Nanking. In fact, there must be countless instances in literature. I think it’s merely
ignorance that nowadays leads people to dismiss them as “unpoetical”. To tell you
the truth, it was I who gave these two pavilions their names. That year when Bao-yu
did all the naming of places in the Garden there were several places left over
afterwards which he either hadn’t got round to naming or had given names to that
were thought unsuitable, and the task of naming them was given to us girls. The
names we made up were taken to the Palace for Cousin Yuan’s approval and she sent
word back saying that provided Uncle Zheng approved of them they were to be used.
So that’s how I came to name these two pavilions. All right, let’s go down then.’
The two girls descended the slope of the little mountain. A few steps round a turn in
the pathway which skirted the foot of it took them to the pavilion. Near the water’s
edge, linking it with Lotus Pavilion farther along the shore, was a bamboo railing. The
two old women who were on night watch in it, little imagining that an overspill from
the hilltop party would come their way, had long since put their light out and gone to
sleep. Dai-yu and Xiang-yun laughed when they saw that the pavilion was in
darkness.
‘They’ve gone to sleep. Never mind. All the better. Let’s sit outside here on the
covered verandah and look at the moonlight on the water.’
They found a couple of drum-shaped bamboo stools to sit down on. A great white
moon in the water reflected the great white moon above, competing with it in
brightness. The girls felt like mermaids sitting in a shining crystal palace beneath the
sea. A little wind that brushed over the surface of the water making tiny ripples
seemed to cleanse their souls and fill them with buoyant lightness.
‘If only I were in a boat now, with some wine to drink!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘If this were
my own home, I should jump into a boat now immediately.’
‘There’s an old saying: “Who seeks perfection must abandon joy”,’ said Dai-yu. ‘If
you ask me, I think we are very well the way we are. Why do we have to be in a boat
to enjoy this?’
Xiang-yun laughed.
“‘One conquest breeds appetite for another.” That applies to most of us, you know,
not only to generals.’
While she was speaking, a flute began to play. They listened for some moments to its
plaintive rise and fall.
‘Grandma and Aunt Wang are obviously enjoying themselves,’ said Dai-yu, smiling.
The flute is a very happy touch. We shall put it to our own purposes, you and I. It
shall inspire our verse. We both like pentameters, don’t we? Let’s do linked
pentameters as we did on that other occasion.’
‘What rhyme?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘We could use a number for a rhyme,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Let’s count the uprights in the
railing as far as that angle over there. Whatever the number is shall be our rhyme.’
‘That’s a very ingenious idea,’ said Xiang-yun.
The two girls got up and walked along the railing to count. It turned out that there
were exactly eight posts from one angle of the railing to the next.
‘Hmn,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Eight. I wonder how far we shall get with that rhyme. The
danger with this sort of thing always is that after a time the rhyming becomes forced
- or else one simply can’t go on at all. Well, you begin.’
‘I’d like to have been able to see afterwards which of us had done better,’ said
Dai-yu, ‘but unfortunately we haven’t got anything to write with.’
‘I’ll write it out tomorrow,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I may not be very clever, but I’ve got a
reasonably good memory.’
‘All right,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll start with something very prosy and obvious.’

DAI-YU:
Fifteenth night of the Eighth, Mid-Autumn moon -

Xiang-yun thought a bit before following.

XIANG-YUN:
Whose joys the First Full Moon’s do emulate,
Under your crystal-constellated heaven -

DAI-TU:
The sounds of music everywhere pulsate.
At many a hoard the reckless winecups fly –


‘Ha! I like the “reckless winecups”,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I must try to do them justice.
Let me see.’
She thought for a bit.

XIANG-YUN:
Where friends are met your feast to celebrate.
The air is crisp, the wind more bracing blows –


‘You finished the couplet very well,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but that second line is a bit weak,
isn’t it?’
    ‘We’ve got a long way to go and the rhyming will soon begin to get harder,’ said
Xiang-yun. ‘I want to save up any good ideas I may have until later.’
‘Mind you produce some good lines later then,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Otherwise you are
going to look pretty silly!’
She proceeded to finish the couplet.

DAI-YU:
In the clear sky the cold stars scintillate.
Grey hairs are mocked when they for cakes dispute -’

I don’t like that line,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It sounds like an allusion, but I think you have
just made it up to confuse me.’
‘That shows you don’t read much,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s a perfectly good allusion.
There’s a story about quarrelling over cakes in the Official history of the Tang Dynasty.
I’ll show you it tomorrow.’
‘Well, anyway, I’m not going to be confused,’ said Xiang yun. ‘I can cap that line.’

XIANG-YUN:
Green girls divide the melons, eight and eight.
New scents the jade-like cassia have enriched -’


‘Now that really is a bogus allusion,’ said Dai-yu.
‘We’ll look both our allusions up tomorrow and the others can judge between us,’
said Xiang-yun. ‘In the meanwhile, let’s get on with this and stop wasting time.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but I don’t like your other line either. We ought to
be able to manage without clichés like “lade-like cassia”. I call that mere padding.’

DAI-YU:
Closed day-lilies the morrow’s gold gestate.
A blaze of candles gilds the radiant feasters –


“‘Gold gestate”!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Well, that’s one way of getting a rhyme - a pretty
cheap one if you ask me! And your second line is quite as much padding as mine
was.’
‘If you hadn’t started with “jade-like cassia”, I shouldn’t have brought in my
gold-gestating day-lilies,’ said Dai-yu. ‘And as regards my second line, I should have
thought a few words on the brilliance of the feast were called for, in order to do
justice to the occasion.’
Since Dai-yu was evidently not going to concede anything, Xiang-yun was obliged to
finish off the couplet.

XIANG-YUN:
Whom frequent sconcings soon inebriate.
Competing, they observe the game’s strict order –


‘Ah, that’s a good line!’ said Dai-yu.
She thought a bit before capping it.

DAI-YU:
And rules for ‘I spy’ gravely promulgate.
Some shake the pretty dice and make them roll –


‘I like “gravely promulgate”,’ said Xiang-yun, laughing. ‘It lifts a vulgar subject up
and gives it tone. But then your “dice” in the next line bring us back again to the
banal.’
She followed as best she could.

XIANG-YUN:
Or, to the drum’s quick beat, the branch rotate.
The clear rays glint on roofs and courts below -
‘Well capped!’ said Dai-yu. ‘But then in your next line you wander off the track. Is
that the best you can do, padding out with that stuff about moonlight?’
‘In point of fact we haven’t said much about the moon yet,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Surely
a few words on the subject are in order? Isn’t that what our poem is supposed to be
about?’
‘All right, let it pass,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We’ll have another look at it tomorrow.’

She continued.

DAI-YU:
And all in silvery light illuminate.
Prizes and forfeits impartially they ponder -


‘Oh dear! are we back with that lot again?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why not something
about ourselves for a change?’

XIANG-YUN:
Sibling verse-contests they adjudicate.
Poets lean on railings, seeking inspiration –

'You’ve managed to get round to us at last!’ said Dai-yu.

DAI-YU:
Or hunt for rhymes, propped up against a gate.
The excitement lingers, though the party’s over –


‘Oh, does it?’ said Xiang-yun.

XIANG-YUN:
The sounds of music softly terminate.
Slowly the talk and laughter fade to silence -


‘It’s getting harder all the time now to rhyme,’ said Dai-yu.

DAI-YU:
Leaving a moonscape hushed and desolate.
On dewy steps the tiny toadstools sprout –
‘Just a minute, I can’t think how to rhyme this,’ said Xiang-yun.
She got up and paced to and fro, hands clasped behind her, thinking.
‘Ha, yes, that’ll do!’ she said after some moments. ‘Good job I thought of that word,
otherwise I might have had to give up.’

XIANG-YUN:
Tight-curled albizzia bushes pernoctate.
A rain-swelled swirl rips through the brook-bed rocks –

Dai-yu leapt to her feet, unable to restrain a cry of admira?tion.


‘You wretch! You certainly have left the good things till last. “Pernoctate” is a
splendid word. But what is “albizzia” for goodness’ sake?’
‘I came across it yesterday in the Prose Anthology,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I was going to
look it up because I didn’t know what kind of tree it was, but Cousin Chai told me I
didn’t need to: she said it was another name for what we nowadays call “mimosa”. I
didn’t believe her, so I looked it up all the same. She was right. That girl knows
everything.’
‘Well, it was very clever of you to have thought of it,’ said Dai-yu, smiling,
‘especially as mimosa does in fact close up at night. But that “rain-swelled swirl” line
is brilliant. That single line is worth all the lines we have made up so far put together.
I shall have to think very carefully before capping it. I very much doubt whether, even
so, I shall be able to think of anything as good.’
After thinking for a while, she produced the following.

DAI-YU:
And wind-combed leaves on ledges congregate.
The Weaving Maid in lonely splendour shines -


‘Your capping line is not at all bad,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘but that second line wanders
off the track a bit. Still, I suppose you could say your “Weaving Maid” is saved from
being mere padding by the “lonely”. It introduces an element of feeling into the line.’

XIANG-YUN:
Damp airs the silver Toad of the moon inflate.
See where the Hare immortal medicine pounds -
Dai-yu nodded silently for some moments before reciting her own two lines.

DAI-YU:
Thither Chang E was forced to emigrate.
A man moves upwards through the constellations -

Xiang-yun, gazing up at the moon, also nodded.

XIANG-YUN:
A raft floats skywards with a human freight.
Waxing or waning, the moon’s face, ever changing –


‘That capping line is not good,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It merely repeats what my line said in
other words. You manage to get clear again with your second line. I suppose you
wanted to compensate for the sameness of the first couplet by making a big jump in
the second.’

DAI-YU:
Its substance changeless and inanimate.
Soon the clepsydra’s night-long drip will cease –

Xiang-yun was about to continue when Dai-yu drew her attention to a black shape in
the middle of the lake.
‘Look, in that dark shadow there, like a human shape! Do you think it could be a
ghost?’
Xiang-yun laughed.
‘Oh, she’s seeing ghosts now! I’m not afraid of ghosts. I shall throw a stone at it.’
She bent down to pick up a pebble and hurled it into the centre of the lake. They
heard a plop and saw the distorted image of the moon expand and contract as
concentric ripples travelled outwards from the shattered surface. There was a loud
squawk, and from the middle of the dark shadow a white stork flew up and flapped
his way across the water in the direction of Lotus Pavilion.
‘So that’s who it was!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I wasn’t expecting him to be there. He gave me
quite a shock.’
‘I’m very grateful to that stork,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘He’s given me a first line for the
next couplet.’

XIANG-YUN:
Black shades the lamp’s last gleams annihilate
A stork’s dark shape crosses the cold, bright water –

Dai-yu murmured admiringly, but stamped with vexation when she began to think
about finishing the couplet.
‘Wretched stork, coming to her aid like that! This is not like the “rain-swelled swirl”
couplet: I’m not going to be able to complete it by paralleling the whole line. A
contrast for the dark moving shape is the most I can hope for. But your line is so
natural, so simple and expressive. I feel almost like giving up.’
‘Perhaps if we both thought about it we could finish it together,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Or,
if you prefer, let’s break off now and you can try again tomorrow.’
Dai-yu stared up at the sky, ignoring her. Suddenly, after remaining immobile for
some seconds, she gave a little laugh.
‘Stop your chatter, girl! I can finish this couplet. Listen:

DAI- YU:
Where, moon-embalmed, a dead muse lies in state.

Xiang-yun clapped her hands.
‘Excellent! Couldn’t be better! I love your “dead muse”!’ She sighed. ‘I mean
excellent from a purely poetic point of view, because it’s so original. It’s a bit morbid,
though. I don’t think it can be good for a person in your state of health to indulge in
such chilling fantasies.’
‘With you to compete against, how else could I keep my end up?’ said Dai-yu.
‘Because I put so much into that last line -’
Just at that moment a figure stepped out from behind the spur of rock beyond the
railings.
‘Bravo! An excellent line!’ said this person. ‘But it is, indeed, a little too melancholy.
Don’t do any more. If you go on from there, the danger is that you may produce
something forced and mechanical, which instead of offsetting the beauty of your line
will merely spoil it.’
Startled by this unexpected interruption, the two girls looked hard in the direction
from which it came and with some surprise recognized the speaker as Adamantina.
‘What are you doing here?’ they asked her.
‘Hearing the sounds of your moon-watching party, followed later by the sound of a
flute playing, I was tempted to come out and enjoy the moon myself. I wanted to see
it over this open expanse of water, where it appears to most advantage, and as I
approached, I could hear you both reciting. Such pure refinement constrained me to
stay and listen. But there were lines which, in spite of their excellence, contained a
note of almost decadent melancholy, lines which made me fearful for the person
uttering them. That is why I came out of my concealment and prevented you from
going on. Lady Jia has long since broken up the party. Everyone else in the Garden
must be in bed by now. I wonder where your maids are. Doubtless they are
somewhere looking for you. Are you not afraid of catching cold? Come with me, and I
shall give you some hot tea to drink. It must be nearly dawn.’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘I’d no idea the night was so far advanced.’
The three of them walked together to Green Bower Hermitage. A faint light still
flickered in the Buddha shrine and the incense in the burner gave off a tiny smoke. All
the old lay-sisters were asleep. A little maid, nodding sleepily on Adamantina’s
meditation mat, appeared to be the only person still up. She roused herself when
Adamantina called to her and made some tea with water from the already boiling
kettle. Just at that moment there was a knocking at the gate and the little maid
hurried to open it. It turned out to be Nightingale and Kingfisher with two or three
old womenservants, looking for their mistresses. They found their mistresses drinking
tea inside.
‘Well!’ they said. ‘You’ve led us a fine old dance! We’ve been all over the Garden
looking for you. We even tried Mrs Xue’s outside. In the end we happened to go to
that little pavilion under the mountain, just as the caretakers were waking up. When
we asked them about you they said, “There were two people talking outside on the
covered verandah a while ago, then a third one came along and we heard them
saying they were going to the Hermitage.” That’s how we knew you were here.’
Adamantina told the little maid to take them round to the back where they could sit
down and have some tea. She herself took paper, inkstone, brush and ink and began
writing out the poem in linked couplets at the other two’s dictation.
Dai-yu was impressed by Adamantina’s enthusiasm.
‘I have never before liked to ask for your opinions about poetry because I have
never before seen you show so much interest,’ she said; ‘but since you now obviously
are in the mood for discussing it, won’t you please favour us with some criticism? If
you think that what we have done is no good at all, let us burn it; hut if you can see
ways of improving it, do please correct it for us.’
‘I certainly would not presume to alter any of it,’ said Adamantina smiling; ‘but as
there are no less than twenty-three couplets here, I am pretty sure that all your best
lines must have been used up by now, and that if you were to go on, there would be
a danger that you might begin to flag. What I should have liked to do would have
been to go on for you myself; but I am afraid that if I did, I might only succeed in
adding a dog’s tail to your leopard-skin!’
Dai-yu had never seen Adamantina compose poetry before and took her up eagerly
on her obvious willingness to do so now.
‘Oh please do, if you have a mind to! Though our verses may be of little value, they
will gain distinction by being associated with yours.’
‘In order to conclude what you have done so far,’ said Adamantina, ‘it will be
necessary to bring the poem back to what we Buddhists call the “proper aspect”. If
we continue to abandon reality and go chasing after the bizarre and the supernatural,
we shall be guilty not only of unmaidenliness but also of losing sight of our subject.’
Mesdemoiselles Lin and Shi agreed.
Adamantina picked up the brush and began, muttering and writing by turns, until,
having knocked off some dozen or so couplets, all in the same apparently effortless
manner, she laid the brush down again and handed the paper over for the other two
to read. This is what she had written:

In golden censers figured incense burns;
Unguents in their jade pots coagulate.

A flute provokes the grieving widow’s weeping;
She craves some warmth her bed’s chill to abate.

Its cheerless hangings stir in the wind of autumn,
Its love-ducks mock a mistress without mate.

Thick dews make treacherous the slippery moss,
And spears of frost the tall bamboos serrate.

Better the winding lakeside path to follow,
Or lonely hilltop to perambulate.

Bound demons seem to writhe in the tortured rock-shapes;
In the trees’ black shadows wild things pullulate.

Light’s harbingers begin with the dark to struggle,
And morning’s first dews to accumulate.

Birds in a thousand treetops wake the woodland;
In the echoing valley sad apes ululate.
My footsteps tread the path’s familiar turnings,
Nor need the stream’s source to investigate.

From Green Bower convent sounds the matin bell;
And Sweet-rice cocks the dawn anticipate.

Why should this rapt enjoyment end in sorrow,
Or timid cares our conscience irritate?

Poets ought in themselves to find their pleasure,
Not in the message they communicate.

As daylight breaks let none of us plead tiredness,
But over tea continue our debate.

At the end of these couplets she had written down the title for the whole poem:
Mid-Autumn Night in Prospect Garden: A Poem in Thirty-five Couplets
Dai-yu and Xiang-yun were full of admiration.
‘Strange that we should be always looking round for poetic talent,’ they said, ‘and
all the time we have had a poet like you on our very doorstep! These verses of yours
make anything we have ever done look very amateurish.’
‘I must have another look at them tomorrow and touch them up a bit,’ said
Adamantina smiling. ‘It’s already dawn. We really must go to bed.’
Dai-yu and Xiang-yun got up and took their leave. Their maids left with them.
Adamantina saw them outside the gate and stood a long while watching them go.
They had already covered a good part of the way back when she at last went in again
and closed the gate after her.
Kingfisher wanted Xiang-yun to go to Li Wan’s place to sleep.
‘The people at Mrs Zhu’s are expecting you, miss. You ought to go there.’
‘Drop in there on the way and tell them not to wait up for me any longer,’ said
Xiang-yun. ‘Mrs Zhu is still ill. If I went back there to sleep now, I’m afraid I might
disturb her. If I’m going to disturb anyone, let it be Miss Lin.’
When they reached the Naiad’s House, they found half the servants there asleep. The
girls took off their ornaments and outer clothes, washed, and got into bed.
Nightingale let down the bed-curtains, and having set the lamp down within easy
reach of the bed, went out and closed the door.
But neither of the girls could sleep, Xiang-yun because she always had difficulty in
getting to sleep in a strange bed, and Dai-yu because her anaemic condition always
made sleeping difficult for her, and because on this occasion she had long since
passed beyond tiredness, so that for her sleep was in any case out of the question.
For a long time the two of them lay tossing and turning on the bed.
‘Can’t you get to sleep?’ Dai-yu asked Xiang-yun eventually.
‘I can never get to sleep in a strange bed,’ said Xiang-yun with a rueful laugh.
‘Anyway, I’m too tired to get to sleep. I’ll just have to lie and rest. Can’t you get to
sleep either?’
Dai-yu sighed.
‘This is no novelty for me,’ she said. ‘I don’t suppose I get more than ten really good
nights’ sleep in a year.’
‘No wonder you’re always ill,’ said Xiang-yun.
Our story continues in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 77

A wronged maid takes a loving
last leave of her master
And three young actresses seek to
escape matrimony in the cloister



To Lady Wang it appeared that, with the passing of the Mid?-Autumn festival,
Xi-feng’s condition had improved considerably. True, she was still far from well, but
she could get about in the house now and even venture out of doors. The physician,
who, notwithstanding this improvement, had on Lady Wang’s instructions been
requested to continue his daily visits, was now recommending a course of pills
designed to regularize her periods and make some new blood to replace the
quantities she had lost. Observing that the prescription for these pills included two
ounces of the best quality ginseng, Lady Wang ordered her maids to get out her own
supply. After much rummaging they found a few pieces not much thicker than a large
hairpin in one of the little medicine-boxes. When they showed them to Lady Wang,
she thought them of too inferior a quality and ordered the maids to look again; but
further searching produced only a large packet of ‘whis?kers’ broken off from the
rootlets.
‘When one doesn’t need this stuff, there is always plenty of it,’ said Lady Wang
testily. ‘It is only when we want some that you can’t find any. I am always telling you:
you must keep a proper check on things and you must keep them together, but you
won’t do as I say: you will leave things lying around all over the place, and then
afterwards you never know where to look for them.’
‘I think this is all the ginseng we’ve got,’ said Suncloud. ‘That time Lady Xing came
for some, I think she must have taken it all.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Go and look again. And look properly this time!’
Suncloud had to go off and search some more. She came back bearing several
packets of herbs.
‘I don’t know what is in these, Your Ladyship. If there isn’t any ginseng in any of
these, then we really haven’t got any.’
Lady Wang opened the packets. She had no recollection of what they contained and
could not identify the contents, but she could tell at a glance that none of them
contained any ginseng. She sent someone to Xi-feng’s room to ask if Xi-feng had got
any herself. Xi-feng came over to reply.
‘I’ve only got extract of ginseng,’ she said. ‘Actually I have got a few dried leaves and
whiskers, but they are not of good quality and I use them every day in my infusions.’
Lady Wang was obliged to ask Lady Xing; but she, too, was unable to oblige.
Lady Wang was now reduced to going round in person to Grandmother Jia and
begging some from her. Grandmother Jia at once asked Faithful to get out whatever
remained of her own supply. Fortunately there was still a large packetful. The roots
were of various sizes, but mostly about the thickness of a finger. Faithful weighed out
two ounces and gave them to Lady Wang, who carried them back to her own
apartment and there handed them over to Zhou Rui’s wife, together with the packets
of unidentified herbs, instructing her to get one of the pages to carry them to the
doctor. While he was about it, she said, he could determine what the herbs were and
write their names on the packets.
When Zhou Rui’s wife reappeared some time later, she was carrying not only the
packets of herbs but also the ginseng.
‘He’s written the names on the packets,’ she said. ‘But this ginseng - he says it’s
very high quality ginseng, but it’s too old. He says ginseng isn’t like other medicines:
no matter how good it is, after a hundred years or so it turns into dust. This ginseng
here hasn’t turned into dust yet, but he says it’s already dried-up, like rotten wood.
It’s got no goodness in it. He told me to bring it back. He said tell Her Ladyship to try
and get hold of some a bit fresher than this. It doesn’t matter about the roots being a
bit on the thin side as long as it’s fresh.’
Lady Wang bowed her head and thought for some moments in silence.
‘I suppose there’s nothing else for it. We shall just have to buy two ounces. - Take
this stuff away!’ she said, feeling no inclination to examine the packets. One of the
maids removed them while she continued with her instructions to Zhou Rui’s wife.
‘Tell our buyer to pick out ginseng of the very best quality. He is to get it as cheaply as
he can, of course, but it must be high quality ginseng. Oh, and if Lady Jia should ask
any of you about this, tell her that we used the ginseng she gave us. Don’t go
prattling to her about what the doctor said.’
Zhou Rui’s wife was about to go off on her errand when Bao-chai, who happened to
be sitting in the room, smilingly intervened.
‘Just a minute, Aunt. There is really no good ginseng to be had in the shops
nowadays. If the dealers ever get hold of a whole root, they cut it into two or three
sections which they carve into shape and graft crowns and rootlets onto so that they
can make more money by passing off each section as a whole root. Our firm has
quite a lot to do with the ginseng suppliers. If I had a word with Mamma about this, I
am sure Pan could arrange for one of our people to get two ounces of whole, uncut
root from the suppliers. It might cost rather a lot, but at least you could be sure that
you were getting ginseng of the very highest quality.’
‘You are so knowledgeable!’ said Lady Wang gratefully. ‘Would you do that then? I
am sure it would be better for the request to come from you.’
Bao-chai left immediately and was gone for a long time.
‘He’s sent someone to see about it,’ she said when she got back. ‘We shall have a
reply by this evening. That means that we ought to be able to get the stuff first thing
tomorrow. That isn’t too long to wait, is it?’
Lady Wang was delighted, though her comment was a somewhat rueful one.
‘We have always kept a supply of ginseng in the past, and we have given I don’t
know how much away to other people; but now that we want some ourselves, we
have to run around looking for it elsewhere.’
She sighed.
‘Although ginseng is so costly, it is only a medicine,’ said Bao-chai consolingly. ‘As
such it ought to be given away to others, so that its benefit may be spread as widely
as possible. People in our position cannot behave like ill-bred parvenus who hoard
their ginseng like an heirloom and can only under the most exceptional
circumstances be induced to part with any.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘Yes, I suppose you are right.’
A little later, after Bao-chai had gone and there was no one else with her in the room,
Lady Wang called Zhou Rui’s wife over to ask about another matter.
‘When you made that search in the Garden the other day, did you find what you
were looking for?’
Zhou Rui’s wife had already consulted Xi-feng about what Lady Wang should be told
and Xi-feng had insisted that there should be no concealment; she therefore told her
everything. Lady Wang was deeply shocked. When she had somewhat recovered
from her surprise and begun thinking what to do, it occurred to her that, as Chess
was Ying-chun’s maid and therefore really a member of Lady Xing’s establishment, it
would first be necessary to acquaint Lady Xing with the facts before proceeding any
further. Zhou Rui’s wife had her own ideas on the subject.
‘Lady Xing was so angry with Wang Shan-bao’s wife for meddling that she boxed
her ears and Wang Shan-bao’s wife has kept at home ever since, pretending to be ill.
She certainly won’t have spoken to Lady Xing about this matter because Chess is her
own daughter’s child and it would be like slapping her own face if she did so. I expect
she’s pretending to have forgotten all about it and is just waiting for the whole affair
to blow over. If I report it, Lady Xing will like as not take umbrage and say that I am
interfering. It would be best simply to take Chess and the things we found along to
her and let her work it all out for herself. Probably she’ll give Chess a beating and
have her married to one of the boys and pick another maid for Miss Ying and that will
be the end of the matter. But if I just go along and tell her, without taking Chess or
the things, she’ll probably think up some excuse for doing nothing. “If your mistress
has found this out,” she’ll say, “why doesn’t she deal with it herself? Why do you
come here asking me about it?” That way it will get put off. Then suppose when no
one is looking the girl finds some means of doing away with herself? We shall have a
fine to-do on our hands! She’s already been under guard now for two or three days.
If we don’t do something about her soon, we shall be simply asking for trouble.’
Lady Wang reflected for some moments.
‘Yes, you are right,’ she said at last. ‘Do as you have suggested straight away then,
and after that we will deal with our own young harpies.’
Now that she had her commission, Zhou Rui’s wife got together several of the other
women and took them with her to Ying-chun’s apartment. Ying-chun listened with
tears in her eyes while Zhou Rui’s wife explained what she had come about, and it
was evident that the idea of parting with Chess distressed her; on the other hand, as
she had now heard something about the raid from the other maids and knew that
this matter was connected in some way with morality, she felt that however painful
the parting might be, there was probably nothing she could do to prevent it. Chess
was unaware of this. She had pleaded with Ying-chun the morning after the discovery
and was convinced that Ying-chun could save her if she had a mind to. It could only
be her habitual reluctance to speak out, her usual weak irresolution, that now kept
her silent. When it became clear that her mistress was determined to say nothing
and that there was to be no escape for her, Chess fell down on her knees and
reproached her tearfully.
‘You have a cruel heart, miss! All through these last few days you have allowed me
to go on hoping, but now, when the time comes, you won’t say a single word to help
me!’
‘You surely don’t expect Miss Ying to keep you?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife indignantly.
‘Even if she did, what would all the other people in the Garden say? And how would
you be able to look them in the face after what you have done? Take my advice: the
best thing you can do is to pack your things up and get out of here as quickly as
possible, before anyone else has had a chance of finding out what you have been up
to.’
‘I know that you have done something serious,’ said Ying-?chun tearfully. ‘If I speak
up for you or try to keep you, it will be all up with me too. Apart from that, look how
quickly they got rid of Picture, in spite of all the years she had served Miss Xi: just
“Out!” and out she went. I don’t think it will stop at you and Picture. I think they
must be planning to get rid of all the older girls in the Garden. We are all going to be
separated sooner or later. If you ask me, I think you and I might just as well part now
as any other time.’
‘There, you see?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Miss Ying understands. There’ll be plenty of
others dismissed after you have gone, don’t you worry!’
Since there was to be no respite, Chess, struggling to hold back her tears, made a last
kotow to her mistress and said good-bye to the other maids. As she was leaving, she
leaned forwards and whispered in Ying-chun’s ear:
‘Try and find out what’s happening to me, miss. Put in a good word for me if you
hear I’m suffering.’
‘Of course I will,’ said Ying-chun. There were tears in her own eyes as she said it.
Those were the last words spoken before Zhou Rui’s wife and the other women took
Chess away. Two old women accompanied them carrying her things. They had gone
no more than a few steps out of the courtyard gate when little Tangerine came
running after them and handed Chess a silk purse, while with the other hand she
wiped her streaming eyes.
‘This is from the mistress. She says it’s hard to lose you after all the years you and
she have been together and she wants you to have this to remember her by.’
As she received the purse, Chess was unable to restrain a further outburst of tears,
and for some moments she and Tangerine clung together weeping, until Zhou Rui’s
wife, growing impatient, began hustling Chess on her way, forcing the two girls apart.
Chess spoke to the women imploringly:
‘For charity’s sake, couldn’t you turn a blind eye just for a few minutes while I say
good-bye to the maids in the other apartments? Some of the older ones I have
known so long, they have become almost like sisters to me.’
Zhou Rui’s wife and the other women all had work of their own to do which they had
left unwillingly and were anxious to get back to; moreover all of them deeply
resented the overbearing manner which Chess and the other senior maids had
adopted towards them in the past; there was therefore little chance of their being
moved by her plea.
‘If I were you I should stop all this shilly-shallying and be on your way,’ said Zhou
Rui’s wife coldly. ‘We’ve got more important things to do than sit around waiting
while you say your good-byes. In any case, they’re not your real sisters, so what’s the
point of seeing them? It’s only playing for time. You’ve got to leave in the end,
however long you delay. You might just as well get it over with now, as quickly as
possible.’
She hurried on towards the rear corner gate of the Garden. The hapless Chess, not
daring to say another word, had to follow her out of it.
By coincidence, just as they were coming out of the Garden, they ran into Bao-yu
who was returning to it from outside. Seeing Chess in the company of this grim
escort and with the two older women behind her carrying a lot of things, he realized
that she must be leaving the Garden for good. He had heard something now about
the raid and had noticed that Skybright’s sickness had grown more serious since her
interview with his mother (though he could not induce her to say why). The
realization that he was witnessing Chess’s dismissal came as all the greater shock in
the light of these other happenings. He stepped forwards impetuously and barred
their way.
‘Where are you going?’
Zhou Rui’s wife knew Bao-yu from of old and greatly feared that they were now to be
held up indefinitely with a lot of pointless chatter.
‘It’s nothing to do with you,’ she said, smiling grimly. ‘You get back to your books!’
‘Just stop a moment, there’s a good woman,’ said Bao-yu appealingly, just long
enough to hear what I’ve got to say.’
‘Her Ladyship told us we were under no circumstances to delay,’ said Zhou Rui’s
wife. ‘There’s nothing to be said. We’ve got our orders from Her Ladyship, that’s all
we’re concerned about.’
Chess clung to Bao-yu and wept.
‘There’s nothing they can do. If you want to save me, you’ll have to speak to Her
Ladyship.’
Bao-yu was deeply upset. His eyes filled with tears.
‘I don’t know what terrible thing you are supposed to have done,’ he said, ‘but I
know that something has upset Skybright and made her ill, and now you are going.
What on earth is happening?’
Zhou Rui’s wife turned on Chess angrily.
‘You’re not a lady’s maid now, you know. Now if you don’t do what I tell you, I have
the right to beat you, just like any other servant. You can’t play fast and loose with us
now and then run to your mistress to save you from the consequences. I’ve told you
a number of times to be on your way, but you take no notice. A maid holding on to a
young master - whoever heard of such a thing!’
At this the other women laid violent hands on Chess and hurried her away. Bao-yu,
fearing that if he said anything it would only make matters worse, glared at them in
silence; but he could not resist pointing his linger at them when they had gone and -
sotto voce - giving bitter vent to his feelings:
‘Strange, the way they get like this when they marry! It must be something in the
male that infects them. If anything they end up even worse than the men!’
The old women on duty at the gate overheard this and could not help laughing at
him.
‘In that case all girls must be good and all women must be bad,’ they said. ‘You
don’t really believe that, do you?’
‘Indeed I do,’ said Bao-yu feelingly. ‘That’s precisely what I do believe.’
Just at that moment some other old women came hurrying up to them.
‘Make sure you’re all here in case Her Ladyship wants you,’ said one of them. ‘She’s
in the Garden now, making an inspection. And someone go and get Skybright’s
cousin and his wife, so that they’ll be ready to take her away presently.’ She chuckled.
‘Holy Name! The Lord has opened his eyes at last! With that little pest out of the way,
it will be a better place for all of us!’
At the old woman’s mention of his mother’s presence, Bao?-yu, fearing that it might
bode ill for Skybright, had rushed off immediately, so that he had missed the gloating
remark which followed it. When he arrived at Green Delights, he found a small crowd
of women waiting outside the door. His mother was sitting inside the room with
anger written all over her face. She deliberately ignored him as he entered. Skybright,
who had taken no nourishment of any kind for the past four or five days and was in
too weak a state to get up, had been dragged from the kang and now stood facing
her, propped up between two women. Her hair was in disarray and her face looked
as if it needed washing.
‘Throw out the clothes she has been wearing,’ Lady Wang was saying. ‘She can take
them with her. The rest can be kept here and given to more deserving maids to wear.’
Having finished with Skybright, she ordered all the other maids to be called in, from
Aroma down to the most junior maid-of-all-work, to be subjected to her scrutiny.
Each and every one of them was in Lady Wang’s opinion a potential corrupter of her
boy.
‘Which is the one whose birthday is on the same day as Bao-yu’s?’ she asked.
Since the girl herself would not answer, one of the old women pointed her out.
‘This is the one, Your Ladyship: Citronella. She’s called “Number Four”. She’s the
one whose birthday is on the same day as Bao-yu’s.’
Lady Wang examined the girl closely. Although not half as good-looking as Skybright,
she had a certain gracefulness about her, and intelligence shone out in her every
feature. She was moreover better dressed than the other maids. Lady Wang sniffed
scornfully.
‘Another shameless young baggage! This is the one who said that those with the
same birthday are destined to be husband and wife. You did say that, didn’t you? You
think that because I live away from here I don’t know these things; but though I may
not come here often myself, I have my eyes and ears here, watching you and listening
to you all the time. Do you imagine that I would willingly allow my only son to be
corrupted by creatures like you?’
Number Four reddened, hearing from Lady Wang’s own lips the words she once said
to Bao-yu in private. It was useless to deny that she had said them. She hung her
head and wept.
‘Tell her people to come and take her away,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She can be paired off
with one of the boys.’
Exit Number Four.
Now which is the one with the foreign name?’ said Lady Wang.
Parfumée-Aventurin stepped forward.
Oh, it is you. One expects an actress to be a vampire, but one had hoped, after you
turned down the opportunity to go free and insisted on staying here, that you would
make some effort to behave. Instead, it seems, you have turned your attentions on
my son and been encouraging him to get up to I don’t know what sorts of mischief.’
Parfumée smiled.
‘I haven’t encouraged him to get up to anything.’
Lady Wang smiled back at her.
‘You would argue with me, would you? I suppose it is hardly surprising, considering
the way you treated your own foster-mother while I was away. - Call her
foster-mother!’ she ordered. ‘I make her a present of this girl. She can marry her to
whomever she likes. And you can give her her things to take as well.’
Having thus disposed of Parfumée, she went on to give orders that none of the
remaining ex-actresses were to stay any longer in the Garden. Their foster-mothers
were to be summoned to collect them and allowed to dispose of them as they
wished. The delight and gratitude of these women when they received the message
can be imagined. They arranged among themselves to visit Lady Wang in a body and
kowtow their thanks to her before going into the Garden to collect the girls.
Lady Wang now proceeded to inspect Bao-yu’s things. Anything which looked at all
unfamiliar she had put on one side. The whole lot were then wrapped up in one big
bundle and carried to her own apartment.
‘Much better make a clean sweep of these things,’ she said. ‘There will be that
much less for people to gossip about.’
In conclusion she admonished Aroma and the remaining maids.
‘Now be careful! From now on if I hear of anything the slightest bit untoward
happening, I shall have no mercy! I can’t move you out yet, because there are still
investigations in progress, but next year I shall have the whole lot of you moved back
into the mansion, and then perhaps I shall be able to set my mind at rest.’
She went off at the head of her little troop of women, not even staying for a cup of
tea.
When Bao-yu heard from the old woman of his mother’s visit, he had expected
something unpleasant but of no great consequence: perhaps another inspection of
the maids’ possessions. He was therefore quite unprepared for the raging tempest
that had just passed over him. The things his mother had charged the maids with
showed so uncanny a knowledge of even his most intimate conversations with them
that there seemed little point in denial. He felt wretched enough to die, but it was
clear that even self-immolation could achieve nothing while his mother’s anger was
at its height. He therefore followed after her in silence, until he had seen her as far as
Drenched Blossoms Pavilion half-way across the bridge, when she peremptorily
ordered him to return.
‘Go back - and get on with your studies! Then next time your father asks you about
them, you will at least be able to say that you have made a start.’
Bao-yu turned back. All the way back to Green Delights he was thinking to himself:
‘Who’s been blabbing? No one outside knows about these things. How did Mother
get to hear about them?’
The question was continuing to trouble him when he entered his room. He noticed
that Aroma was in tears.
‘Well, she would be if any of the senior maids was leaving,’ he thought. ‘It’s only
natural.’
He flung himself down on the bed and broke into loud sobs. Aroma tried to talk him
out of his despair. She knew that, whatever might become of anyone else, it was
Skybright that he was chiefly concerned about.
‘Oh, do get up!’ she said. ‘What’s the use of crying? I tell you, Skybright will be
better off where she is going. Back at home she will at least be able to have a few
days to herself in peace and quiet. And if you really can’t bear to be without her, you
have only to wait until Her Ladyship’s anger has cooled down a bit and then go and
ask Her Old Ladyship to have her brought back again. It shouldn’t be difficult. Her
Ladyship was acting in anger. Probably she had heard someone gossiping about her.’
‘But what heinous crime is Skybright supposed to have committed?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Maybe she isn’t,’ said Aroma. ‘Maybe Her Ladyship just thinks she is too
good-looking. She probably thinks that anyone who is so good-looking must be
unreliable. She knows these very beautiful young women are often trouble-makers.
Probably she dislikes Skybright just for being beautiful. It’s better to be a plain, gawky
person like me!’
‘Who said that beautiful women are trouble-makers?’ said Bao-yu. ‘There have
always been lots and lots of beautiful women who were nothing of the kind. But
never mind all that. What I can’t understand is, how did Mother get to hear about all
those private jokes of ours? No one outside could have told her. It’s very, very
strange.’
‘Look how careless you are,’ said Aroma. ‘Once you get a bit excited you are
capable of saying anything, regardless of who else is around. Many and many’s the
time I have given you a look or made some sign to warn you, but you never notice.’
‘Maybe,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but tell me this. How is it that she’d heard something
damaging about every single person in this apartment except you and Musk and
Ripple?’
Somewhat taken aback by this question, Aroma hung her head and pondered it for
some moments, but she was unable to think of an explanation. She laughed
embarrassedly.
‘I agree, it is rather strange. We three must often have made careless remarks that
could have been used against us. I wonder why Her Ladyship didn’t mention any?
Perhaps she’ll come back and deal with us three later.’
‘You?’ said Bao-yu, laughing incredulously. ‘The famous paragon of all the virtues?
There’s little danger of her finding fault with you. Or with those other two, whom you
trained and moulded in your own image. Parfumée I can understand: she is young
and precocious and inclined to use her intelligence for putting other people down, so
it’s hardly surprising that she should be disliked. Number Four’s unpopularity I blame
myself for. It dates from that time when you and I had quarrelled about something
and I allowed her to wait on me in your place. The others must have resented my
giving her special treatment, and that, ultimately, must be the reason for what has
happened to her today. But why Skybright? You and she started together with my
grandmother when you were little girls. It’s true she is a bit better-looking than the
rest of you, but she has never taken advantage of that fact: no one has ever been
made to feel threatened by it. Even her forthrightness - and she could be quite
sharp-tongued on occasion - has never, as far as I am aware, given serious offence. I
suppose it must be as you say: her good looks have been her undoing.’
He concluded by once more bursting into tears.
Mulling over what he had just said, Aroma concluded that it could only mean that he
suspected her. There seemed little point in protesting. She sighed.
‘There’s One above who knows the truth of the matter; but I don’t suppose we
shall find out who it was for a while yet. At all events, crying isn’t going to help. Much
better keep your spirits up and next time Her Old Ladyship is feeling cheerful, explain
what has happened and ask to have Skybright back again.’
‘You only say that to humour me,’ said Bao-yu bitterly. ‘According to you I am to
wait until Mother’s anger has subsided and after that wait until a favourable
opportunity arises for talking to Grandmother; but what makes you think that
Skybright’s illness will wait that long? Ever since she came into our family as a child
she has lived comfortably. She has never had to experience a single day of real
hardship. Sending her to that place now is like taking a potted orchid that has just
started putting out its first tender spears of growth and setting it down in a pigsty.
Apart from being physically ill, she must be in a terrible state mentally as well. And
she has no kind parents to look after her, don’t forget: only that worthless cousin and
his wife. I doubt she’ll last there a fortnight. I may not even be able to see her again.’
‘Curfew for the common people, but the Prefect can light a fire,’ said Aroma drily.
‘What a fuss you’d have made if I’d said anything so unlucky! How can you bear to
talk so glibly about her dying?’
‘It isn’t unlucky to talk about what has already been foretold,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There
was a portent of her coming death last spring.’
‘Oh?’ said Aroma in some surprise. ‘What was that?’
‘The crab-apple tree in the courtyard here: only one half of it budded this year; the
other side seems to have died. I knew at the time that something awful must be
going to happen; now I can see that it must have been a portent of her death.’
Aroma laughed out loud.
‘Forgive me, but I just can’t help myself. You really are an old woman! And you
supposed to be so educated! How can what happens to trees and plants have
anything to do with human beings?’
Bao-yu sighed.
‘What do you know about it? Not only plants and trees, but all things that live and
grow have feelings. And like us, they are most responsive to those who most
appreciate them. There are plenty of examples from history: the juniper tree in front
of the temple of Confucius, the milfoil that grows beside his tomb, the cypress in
front of Zhu-ge Liang’s shrine, the pine-tree that grows in front of Yue Fei’s grave: all
those paragons of the vegetable world, mightily endowed with vital essence and able
to withstand the ravages of the centuries, have withered and dried up in times of
disorder, only to flourish once more when times were prosperous. In the course of a
thousand or more years all of them have died and come to life again several times
over. If those are not portents, what are they? On a somewhat less exalted level
there are the peonies beside Yang Gui-fei’s Aloeswood Pavilion, the rhododendrons
of the Duan-cheng-lou and the evergreen grass on Lady Bright’s grave. Surely you
can’t deny that all these are instances of sympathy between plants and humans? I
see no reason to doubt that our crab-apple tree too was reacting to a human
situation.’
By the time his idiotic discourse had ended, Aroma did not know whether to laugh or
groan.
‘You really make me angry,’ she said, ‘comparing Skybright with all those famous
people! What sort of creature do you think she is anyway? And even if she is so
wonderful, you seem to forget that I have precedence over her among your maids. If
the crab-apple is connected with any of us, it ought to be me. It must mean that I am
going to die.’
Bao-yu clapped his hand over her mouth.
‘Now, now, that’s enough of that! I’m already worried enough about her as it is, I
don’t want to have to worry about you as well. Let’s say no more about it. Three
people is quite enough to lose in one day!’
Aroma was secretly glad to hear him say this.
‘If I hadn’t said that to stop him,’ she thought, ‘heaven knows where this nonsense
would have ended!’
‘There’s something else I want to discuss with you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m not quite sure
whether you’ll agree to this or not. Couldn’t we somehow, without letting any of the
family know about it, contrive to let her have her things? Perhaps we could also send
her a few strings of whatever money we have managed to save, so that she has got
something to buy medicines with. Could you, for the sake of all your years together,
do this for her?’
Aroma laughed.
‘Do you really think I need asking? What a mean, inhuman sort of person you must
think I am! I’ve got her clothes and all her other things piled up over there, ready to
send her. I can’t send them now, in broad daylight. With so many prying eyes about it
would be simply asking for trouble. But as soon as it’s evening I shall get Mrs Liu to
take them to her. I’ve got several strings of cash that she can take to her as well.’
Bao-yu nodded.
‘I am a paragon of all the virtues, don’t forget,’ said Aroma teasingly. ‘It’s worth
spending a bit of money to keep up my reputation!’
Bao-yu smiled and said a few words to comfort her. He was afraid that she might
have taken what he said earlier to heart.
That evening, when things had quietened down a bit, he slipped out on his own to
the rear corner gate of the Garden and begged one of the old women there to take
him to Skybright’s house. At first she refused absolutely to help. She was too scared,
she said. What would become of her rice-bowl if Lady Wang got to hear of it? In the
end, after he had pleaded with her very insistently and also promised her some
money, she agreed to take him.
*
Skybright was in the first instance purchased, when she was barely ten years old, by
the Chief Steward Lai Da as a little slave-girl for his wife, who often took Skybright
with her when she went to work in Rong-guo House. It was in this way that she first
came to the attention of Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia took a great fancy to the
beautiful, intelligent little girl, and when Lai Da’s wife noticed this, she gave Skybright
to the old lady as a present. It was because the old lady thought so highly of
Skybright that she later on gave her as a maidservant to her beloved grandson.
Skybright had no recollection of her parents or of the place where she was born. The
only relation she knew of was a cousin somewhat older than herself, said to be her
father’s sister’s son, who was in bondservice elsewhere. After her instalment at the
mansion she begged Lai Da’s wife to have this cousin purchased too and find him
some employment with the Jias. The stewardess was touched by the gratitude and
respect that Skybright continued to show her after her advancement. At her
insistence Lai Da purchased the cousin, gave him a small job as a buyer, and even
provided him with a wife.
Unfortunately Skybright’s cousin was a timorous, poor-spirited creature, whereas the
wife Lai Da had chosen for him was a lively and rather attractive young woman.
Finding her husband unable to provide her with what she wanted, she soon took to
going out every day, dressed up to the nines, to exercise her charms on the other
servants. She was aided in this by a highly expressive pair of eyes which seldom failed
to convey their message. The men were drawn towards her irresistibly, like flies
towards carrion, so that there was seldom any lack of volunteers to fill the gap left by
her neglectful husband.
The couple lived in an apartment not far from the rear side gate of the Garden, and it
was to this place that Skybright was taken after her dismissal. The cousin’s young
wife had little stomach for nursing a sick relation, and as soon as she had eaten, was
off on her customary rounds, leaving Skybright alone and untended in the outer
room.
When Bao-yu arrived at the house, he told the old woman who had brought him to
wait at the gate and keep a look-out while he went inside. Raising the cotton
door-curtain he looked into the room. He could see Skybright at once, lying on an old
rush mat on the kang (fortunately she still had her own bedding) but no one else
appeared to be at home, and he wondered for a moment what he should do; then,
going over to the kang, he plucked timidly at the quilt in which she was wrapped and
gently called her name. His eyes were full of tears.
Skybright, who had been ill to start with, had been made even more so by the
detestable things said to her by her cousin and his wife since her arrival. After
coughing through most of the day, she had recently dozed off into a fitful sleep, and
it was not until Bao-yu had called her name for the second time that she opened her
eyes. What surprise, delight, sorrow, anguish all mixed in one when she saw who it
was! She gripped his hand tightly in hers, but for a long time she could only sob. At
last she managed to speak.
‘I didn’t think I should ever see you again.’
After that she coughed and coughed. Bao-yu was sobbing now himself.
‘Holy Name, it’s a good job you’ve come!’ she said. ‘Could you get me half a cup of
tea? I’m so thirsty, but though I’ve called and called, no one ever comes.’
Bao-yu hurriedly wiped his eyes.
‘Where’s the tea?’
‘It’s over there on the stove,’ said Skybright.
Bao-yu looked at the brick-and-mud-built stove against the wall. There was only a
sort of blackened earthenware skillet on it that bore no resemblance to a tea-pot. He
found a teacup on the table whose greasy, rancid odour reached his nostrils even
before he picked it up. Having located some water, he washed it twice, rinsed it twice,
dried it with his handkerchief, sniffed it (it still smelt) and half filled it with a dusky,
reddish liquid from the skillet. Was it tea? He tasted it dubiously. It had a bitter, acrid
taste with only a slight suggestion of tea about it.
‘That’s tea,’ said Skybright, who had raised herself on the pillow. ‘Please let me
have it. You can’t expect it to be as good as ours.’
Bao-yu handed it to her and she gulped it down greedily as if it were the most
delicious nectar. He watched her with tears running down his cheeks, suddenly
ashamed of his own fastidiousness.
‘If there’s anything you want to tell me,’ he said, ‘you’d better tell me now, while
there’s nobody else about.’
‘What have I got to tell?’ said Skybright. ‘I’m living now from day to day and from
hour to hour. I know I’m done for: it can’t be more than four or five days now at the
most. If it weren’t for one thing, I could die content. I know I’m a bit better-looking
than the others, but I’ve never tried to make up to you. Why will they insist that I am
some sort of vam?pire? It’s so unfair. And now I have so little time left. I ought not to
say this, but if I’d known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved
rather differently.’
She began to cry again.
Bao-yu took her hands in his own. They felt like bundles of dried twigs, so wasted had
she become. She was still wearing a pair of silver bangles on either wrist.
‘Better take these off,’ he said (he was crying himself as he spoke). ‘You can put
them on again when you are better.’
He took them off for her and put them under the pillow.
‘It’s a pity about these nails,’ he said. ‘It took you such a long time to grow them. By
the time you are better, I expect you’ll find that quite a lot of them will have broken
off.’
She wiped her eyes, curled the third and fourth fingers of her left hand back against
the side of her mouth and with a supreme effort half bit half tore off the two
two-inch lengths of scallion-like nail that projected from them.
‘Here!’ She put the pieces into his hand. ‘To remind you of me.’
Then she reached down inside the bedding and managed, after a great deal of
struggling, to take off the old red chemise she was wearing and hold it out to him.
Because of her weakness, the effort of doing this made her pant so much that she
could not speak; but Bao-yu understood what she wanted. He removed his outer
garment, took off the shirt he was wearing underneath it and laid it over her, and put
on the chemise she was holding out to him. He did not bother to do the buttons up,
since it would be hidden anyway beneath his outer garment. While he was fastening
his belt on again, he noticed that she was staring at him, trying to say some?thing.
‘Help me up!’
Even with Bao-yu’s assistance it cost her a good deal of effort to sit fully upright.
Once she was sitting up, she stretched one of her arms out and tried drawing the
shirt on herself. Bao-yu draped it over her shoulders and eased each of her arms in
turn into the sleeves, then gently laid her down again.
‘If anyone sees that when you get back and asks you whose it is,’ said Skybright,
weeping, ‘there’s no need to tell them any lies. Tell them it’s mine. Since I’ve got such
a bad reputation anyway, I might as well have something to show for it when I’m
gone!’
At that moment the door-curtain was lifted and the cousin’s wife came into the room,
all dazzling smiles.
‘Very nice! I’ve heard all that you two have been saying.’ She directed a bold look at
Bao-yu. ‘And what are you doing, a young master like you, coming to see us servants
in our quarters? Bet you heard I was young and good-looking and came here to flirt
with me!’
‘Please, I beg of you, don’t speak so loud!’ said Bao-yu entreatingly. ‘I shouldn’t
really be here, but your cousin was with me for many years: I came here to see her
because she is ill.’
The young woman smiled and nodded approvingly.
‘That’s right. They say you have a good heart.’
She took him by the hand and pulled him after her into the inner room.
‘If you don’t want me to make a noise, you can easily stop me. You have only to do
one little thing.’
She got her backside up onto the kang and drawing him down on top of her, put up
her legs and gripped him tightly between them. This was something totally outside
Bao-yu’s experience. His heart started pounding wildly, his face turned scarlet, and
his whole body began to tremble. It would have been hard to say what feeling was at
that moment uppermost in his mind: embarrassment, shame, fear or annoyance. All
he could manage to say was:
‘Don’t fool about, please!’
The young woman leered up at him through half-closed eyes.
‘Get away with you! From what I’ve been told, you’ve had plenty of practice with
other girls. What makes you so bashful today all of a sudden?’
Bao-yu became even redder.
‘Please let me go. If you’ve got anything to talk about, let’s discuss it like
reasonable human beings. There’s an old woman outside there listening. What do
you think you are doing?’
‘There’s no old woman out there,’ she said. ‘I saw her when I got back and told her
to wait for you at the Garden gate. Come on! I’ve waited a long time to get my hands
on you. If you won’t do what I ask, I’ll call out. You’re a bold one, aren’t you, coming
here! What will Her Ladyship say if she finds out? I was listening to you two outside
the window for quite a while. From what I could make out, you and she have nothing
between you. Well, more fool she, if that’s the case! You needn’t expect me to be so
daft!’
She began to get to work on his clothing, while Bao-yu made frantic efforts to pull
himself away. They were still struggling when a voice was heard outside the window
asking for Skybright. The young woman gave a start and let go of Bao-yu. Bao-yu was
so shaken and confused that he had not heard the voice, and Skybright, listening to
what was going on in the next room, was so overcome with shame and anger that
she had fainted clean away. This left only the cousin’s wife to answer the caller - or
rather callers, for when she went outside to look, it turned out to be Cook Liu and
Fivey with a bundle containing Skybright’s things. Cook Liu was also holding several
strings of cash.
‘We’ve brought these from Miss Aroma for your young lady,’ she said. ‘Which room
is she in?’
The young woman laughed.
‘This room here. Where else would we keep her?’
As Cook Liu and Fivey went into the outer room, a lurking figure dodged into the
inner room at the back. Cook Liu knew something of the young wife’s reputation and
assumed that it must be one of her lovers. Since Skybright appeared to be asleep, she
put the things down beside her and hurried out again. But Fivey had sharper eyes
than her mother and had recognized the lurking figure as Bao-yu.
‘Didn’t Miss Aroma say when we were leaving that she’d been looking for Master
Bao?’ she asked her mother.
‘Goodness, I nearly forgot!’ said Cook Liu. ‘Mrs Song told me just now that she
thought she’d seen him go out of the side gate. And there was someone waiting for
him outside the gate too, wasn’t there? They’ll be wanting to close presently.’
She turned back and asked the young woman if she had seen him.
‘No,’ said the cousin’s wife, beginning to feel nervous. ‘What would Master Bao be
doing at our house?’
Hearing her say this, Cook Liu began to go again; but Bao-yu, partly because he was
afraid of being shut out of the Garden and partly because he feared that the cousin’s
wife might return to the attack if he remained after the visitors had gone, threw
discretion to the winds and, lifting up the door-curtain, came rushing out after them.
‘Mrs Liu! Wait for me! We’ll go back together!’
Cook Liu was mightily astonished.
‘My dear young master! Whatever has brought you to this place?’
Bao-yu sped on ahead without replying.
‘Call him back, Ma!’ said Fivey. ‘Tell him not to be in so much of a hurry. He’ll run
into someone if he’s not careful and they’ll find out what he’s been up to. There’s no
need for him to hurry in any case. That person we saw waiting for him will see to it
that the gate’s kept open for him.’
She and her mother ran after Bao-yu to try and catch up with him. The cousin’s wife
stared after them disconsolately: her beautiful young gentleman had got away.
Bao-yu did not stop running until he was inside the Garden gate. Only then did he
feel safe again, though his heart was still beating wildly. Fortunately no one appeared
to have noticed his absence, and when he got back to Green Delights he managed to
put Aroma off by saying that he had been visiting Aunt Xue.
Shortly after this, as she was making up his bed, Aroma asked him how they should
sleep.
‘Oh, anyhow,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I don’t mind.’
It should be explained that during the year or two that had elapsed since her
unofficial promotion by Lady Wang, Aroma had been taking herself very seriously
and no longer, either at night or when they were alone together in the daytime,
permitted herself those affectionate intimacies that had been customary between
her and Bao-yu in the past. A slight distance seemed to have grown up between
them since their younger, more carefree days. Partly it was being so much busier that
kept her from him: for although the most impor?tant matters remained outside her
control, it was she who organized the sewing and other maid’s-work, took care of
Bao-yu’s and the junior maids’ pocket-money for them, attended to their clothing
and other equipment, and assumed responsibility for the general maintenance of the
apartment. Partly it was because she had a fear of infecting him: for she still
continued, though very infrequently, to cough blood.
     It was mainly for this last reason that she had for some time now ceased
sleeping in the same room. But Bao-yu was nervous at night and liked to have
someone near at hand whom he could call to when he woke up. Because she knew
that Skybright was a light sleeper, Aroma entrusted all the night-time duties, like
answering him when he called, getting up and making tea for him and so forth, to her,
so that it had long since been the custom for Skybright to sleep in the same room
with him beside his bed. Now that Skybright was no longer with him, Aroma made
her own bed up beside Bao-yu’s in Skybright’s place.
   Observing the somewhat dazed manner in which Bao-yu was conducting himself
that evening, Aroma urged him to go to bed early, and as soon as she had got him
settled, went to bed herself. But he seemed very restless. As she lay in her own bed
she could hear him sighing and muttering to himself in his. This went on until well
after midnight. Only then did he fall silent and appeared to have gone to sleep.
Relieved, Aroma began drifting off herself. But only for a moment. Before she had a
chance to get fully off to sleep, she heard him call out:
‘Skybright!’
‘What is it?’ said Aroma, instantly alert again.
Bao-yu said that he wanted some tea, so she got up and poured him out a cup. He
sighed as she handed it to him.
     ‘I’m so used to calling her, I forgot that it was you.’ Aroma laughed.
     ‘The first night she slept with you, you were calling out in your sleep for me. It
took you a while then to get used to the change.’
     They both lay down again. Again Bao-yu was restless and continued so for the
space of about two hours. It must have been four o’clock before he finally got to
sleep. Just as he was dropping off, Skybright walked into the room looking exactly as
she used to do before she was ill. She came right up to the bed and spoke to him.
‘Enjoy your lives, all of you! Mine is already over.’
      Immediately she had said that, she turned round and walked out again. Bao-yu
called out after her. His calling awoke Aroma, who assumed that he was once more
calling Skybright’s name instead of her own from force of habit. But when she went
over to ask him what he wanted, she saw that he was crying.
      ‘Skybright’s dead,’ he said.
      Aroma laughed.
      ‘Don’t be ridiculous! Whatever would anyone think if they heard you say such a
thing?’
      Nevertheless Bao-yu insisted that Skybright was dead and waited impatiently for
the daylight when he could send someone to find out the circumstances of her death.
But daylight brought a little maid knocking at the front corner gate of the Garden
with a message from Lady Wang.
      ‘You must tell Bao-yu to get up immediately and come over to Her Ladyship’s as
soon as he is washed and dressed. The Master is invited out to a
chrysanthemum-viewing, and because he was so pleased with the poem Bao-yu
made at the party the other night, he wants to take him and the other young masters
with him. Have you got that message? Be as quick as you can, please. And tell him to
hurry. The Master is in the main room with Her Ladyship. They are waiting for Bao-yu
to come so that they can start their breakfast. Master Huan is there already, so be
quick. And someone take the same message to Master Lan, please.’
     ‘Yes, yes,’ said the women, hurriedly buttoning up their clothing, and two of
them hurried off to deliver it, one to Green Delights and the other to Sweet-rice
Village.
Aroma knew that something unusual must be toward for someone to be knocking so
early at the courtyard gate and called to one of the old women to go and find out
what it was while she herself got up and put her clothes on. When she heard the
message, she sent someone out for washing-water and roused up Bao-yu. She told
him to wash himself as quickly as possible while she went to fetch him some clothes.
Since it was Jia Zheng he was going out with, she chose his second best, judging his
best to be too showy.

    As there was now obviously no possibility of following out his original intention,
Bao-yu washed and dressed and hurried over to his parents’ apartment immediately.
When he got there be found Jia Zheng already sipping his wheatmeal tea and
apparently in very good humour. Bao-yu made his morning salutation to his parents
after which he in turn was greeted by Jia Huan and Jia Lan. Jia Zheng ordered the
three of them to sit down and drink their wheatmeal tea.
‘Bao-yu is not as diligent as you two in his schoolwork,’ he told the two younger
boys, ‘but he is much better than you at making up poems and couplets. No doubt all
three of you will be called upon to contribute poems at this place we are going to.
Bao-yu will have to help you out a bit.’
This was music indeed in the ears of Lady Wang, who had never before heard her
husband praise Bao-yu in such terms. She waited until Jia Zheng and the boys had
gone before getting up to make her morning call on Grandmother Jia; but before she
could get away, Parfumée foster-mother and two of the other foster-mothers came
in saying that there was something they wished to speak to her about.
‘Ever since Your Ladyship was good enough to let me take Parfumée home with
me,’ said Parfumée’s foster-mother, ‘she’s been refusing to eat and drink and
behaving like a crazy girl, and now Nénuphar and étamine are the same. The three of
them have been carrying on something dreadful, threaten?ing to kill themselves and
I don’t know what. All they want, they say, is to shave their hair off and become nuns.
Well, I thought, they’re only children; after a day or two they’ll get over this. But not
a bit of it: two days have gone by already and they’re worse than ever. Neither words
nor blows have an effect on them. We’re all at our wits’ end. We’ve come to ask Your
Ladyship if you will either let them have their way and go into a convent or else deal
with them as you see fit and hand them over to somebody else, because we can do
nothing with them.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Lady Wang impatiently. ‘It’s not for them to decide what is to
become of them. The Buddhist vocation is not to be undertaken on a mere childish
caprice. Give each of them a flogging and see if they misbehave then!’
It was the custom for nuns from the various temples which the Jia ladies patronized
to visit the mansion over the Mid?-Autumn festival bringing the first-fruits of their
offerings. Euergesia, the prioress of Water-moon Priory, who had come along with
the rest, had been invited to stay on for a few days and happened to be at hand
during this interview. This holy old fraud pricked her ears up when she heard of three
young persons wanting to become nuns. A few young novices to wait on her and help
about the priory were just what she was looking for. She set to work on Lady Wang
accordingly.
‘No doubt it is because this is such a blessed household (thanks to all Your
Ladyship’s good works) that these young people’s hearts have been turned towards
the faith,’ she said. ‘It is true that the Buddha’s gate is not to be entered lightly; but it
is also written that the Buddha’s truth is for all sorts and conditions of men. And not
only men, for when the Blessed Lord made his vow, it was to work for the salvation of
all sentient beings. These three young people have no parents and are far from the
place where they were born. Having had a taste of luxury during their years here with
you, yet being born to a lowly fate and trained in a profession that at best is vanity,
they cannot but tremble when they think what the future may hold for them. I
believe that is why, out of the midst of this sea of suffering, they have turned towards
the light and resolved to abjure the world and its vanities and prepare themselves for
the life to come. That is a noble decision, Your Ladyship. I don’t think you ought to
stand in the way of it.’
Lady Wang was a good woman at heart and had only opposed the young actresses’
determination to become nuns because she thought it proceeded from mere childish
waywardness and feared that when put to the test they would find the vows of
celibacy and abstinence too much for them and fall into mortal sin. But what the old
nun said sounded plausible; and besides, she was at this moment very much
preoccupied with other matters. Lady Xing had sent someone over to say that she
wanted Ying-chun to spend a few days with her so that she could be exhibited to the
representatives of a family seeking her in marriage, and Lady Wang herself was facing
a visit from an official match-maker who was coming to discuss the matrimonial
prospects of Tan-chun. She was far too worried by these other matters to be unduly
concerned about the fate of a few entertainers. The answer she gave Euergesia,
therefore, was a favourable one.
‘Very well then. Would you be prepared to take them as your disciples?’
‘Now blessings be upon you!’ said the old prioress. ‘It would be a holy thing if you
would let me, it would indeed. Praise his Holy Name!’
She pressed her palms together and bowed down almost to the ground.
Lady Wang turned to the three foster-mothers:
‘All right, go and ask them. If they are really serious about this, they can kotow to
Mother Euergesia in my presence and formally make themselves her disciples.’
The three women went off and presently reappeared, bringing the three girls with
them. Lady Wang questioned each of them closely about her decision and when she
was satisfied that they were utterly resolved to go through with it, allowed them to
make their kotows to the old nun. After that they kotowed to her. Now that she was
convinced of their determination and saw that nothing could deflect them from it,
she began to feel quite sorry for them and ordered the servants to get out various
things to give them. She also gave several presents to the prioress.
Thus Parfumée, Nénuphar and étamine left the sinful world behind them and went
off with Euergesia to embark on a new life at Water-moon Priory.
What followed thereafter will be related in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 78

Jia Zheng commissions the Ballad
Of the Winsome Colonel
And Bao-yu composes an Invocation
to the Hibiscus Spirit
After the departure of Euergesia and the three girls, Lady Wang was at last able to
make her morning call on Grandmother Jia. Finding the old lady in excellent humour,
she decided that this was as good a time as any to report on her recent activities.
‘There is a girl in Bao-yu’s room called Skybright,’ she said. ‘She is already of age;
she has been constantly ill during the past year; she gives much more trouble than
any of the others; and she is lazy. During her latest spell of sickness, which must have
been going on now for the better part of a fortnight, we’ve had her looked at by the
doctor and he says she’s got some kind of consumption - a kind that is quite common,
apparently, in unmarried girls; so I’ve sent her back to her own people and told them
that we shan’t be wanting her here again if she gets better, they can find a husband
for her themselves. I also took it upon myself to send away those young actresses.
For one thing, like most people trained in that profession, they use the most
appalling language I don’t think it’s very nice for the other girls to be exposed to it.
And for another thing, as we no longer require them to perform for us, which is what
they were trained for, I think it is only right that we should let them go. We have far
too many maids as it is. If Bao-yu or the girls need any more, we can supply them
from the regular staff; they don’t need young actresses to wait on them.’
Grandmother Jia nodded.
‘That sounds quite sensible. I had been thinking along those lines myself. About
Skybright, though: I always thought she was an excellent maid: she expressed herself
well; she was much the best needlewoman I ever had; I had been thinking of
eventually giving her to Bao-yu to keep. I’m sorry to hear she has changed so much
for the worse.’
‘I’m sure you were not mistaken in her,’ said Lady Wang, smiling. ‘Let’s just say that
the girl was not destined to be fortunate -.hence this perpetual sickness. “For a
growing girl there are eighteen hazards” the proverb says. Quite apart from that, I
think these very gifted people are apt to play up a bit, as I am sure you, Mother, with
all your rich experience must have noticed. Three years ago I, too, was thinking about
choosing someone permanent for Bao-yu, and to begin with I, too, thought of
Skybright as the likeliest choice. But after watching her very carefully, I came to the
conclusion that, although better qualified than the others in so many particulars, she
is not really a very dependable person. For all-round dependability I think Aroma is
very much her superior. I know they say “a wife for virtue and a concubine for
beauty”, but even in choosing a concubine I think the girl with a con?siderate nature
and a sense of responsibility is to be preferred. Aroma may not be as good-looking as
Skybright, but in other respects I should rate her qualifications as a chamber-wife
very highly. Her behaviour is so mature, and yet at the same time she is such a simple,
good-natured girl. During all the years that she has been with Bao-yu she has never
once misbehaved herself; in fact, whenever Bao-yu gets into one of his wild or silly
moods, she does her best to talk him out of it. I waited two whole years to see if she
was really as good as I thought she was, and when, at the end of all that time, I had
found no fault in her, I made a private arrangement to have her maid’s allowance
stopped and two taels paid to her each month out of my own allowance. Aroma
herself was the only person I told about this, because I thought she could do with the
encouragement. I deliberately kept it from everyone else, partly because if Sir Zheng
had got to hear about it he would almost certainly have said that Bao-yu was too
young for a chamber-wife and that having one would distract him from his studies,
and partly because if Bao-yu himself thought of her as a chamber-wife, he would be
less inclined to listen to her good advice and would become more ungovernable than
ever. That is the reason, Mother, why I haven’t told you about this before.’
‘I see,’ said Grandmother Jia, smiling. ‘Oh well, that’s all right then. Even better.
Aroma never had much to say for herself, in my recollection. I always thought her
rather a dull little stick. However, you obviously know her much better than I do. I’m
sure you can’t be wrong. I certainly think it very wise of you not to have told Bao-yu
himself about this, and I hope all of us here will continue to keep quiet about it. I am
sure you are right in thinking that he is the sort of person who, when he is married,
will never listen to a wife’s or a concubine’s advice. He’s a strange boy. I don’t really
understand him. I’ve certainly never known another one like him. His other kinds of
naughtiness I can understand; it’s this passion for spending all his time with maids
that I find so hard to make out. It used at one time to worry me: I thought it must be
because he had reached puberty and was having experiences with them; but after
watching him very carefully, I came to the conclusion that it wasn’t that at all. It’s
very, very strange. Perhaps he was a maid himself in some past life. Perhaps he ought
to have been a girl.’
Lady Wang and the others laughed. Lady Wang then went on to tell Grandmother Jia
how highly Jia Zheng had spoken of Bao-yu that morning and how he had taken
Bao-yu and the other two boys with him on an outing. Grandmother Jia was
delighted.
Not long after this Ying-chun appeared, dressed in her going-out clothes, to take
leave of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang before going next-door to stay with Lady
Xing. Xi-feng called in, too, for her morning duty call and stayed to wait on the old
lady while she took her lunch and to joke with her for a while after it was finished.
When the old lady had settled herself down for her after-lunch nap, Lady Wang called
to Xi-feng to accompany her back to her own apartment. She asked her whether she
had started taking the ginseng pills yet. No, not yet, Xi-feng told her, because she was
still taking the infusions; but her aunt was not to worry, because she was now feeling
completely better. Observing that she certainly seemed to have got her old
cheerfulness back, her aunt was inclined to believe her. She told her about her
dismissal of Skybright and the other girls. This led her to another topic.
‘Why did your Cousin Chai go back home without telling anyone? Doesn’t anyone
know? When I was making my inspection yesterday, I decided to take a look at Wan’s
servants as well. That new nurse she has got for little Lan is quite un?suitable; in fact,
I don’t like the look of her at all. I said to Wan, “I don’t care how you do it, my dear,
but you must get rid of that woman at once. Lan is old enough to do without a nurse
now in any case. He certainly doesn’t need a nurse like that one!” I asked her if she
knew about Bao-chai. She said yes, Bao-chai had told her that she was going, but it
was only for two or three days, until her mother was better, and then she would be
moving in again. Well I know for a fact that there is nothing much wrong with your
aunt: a bit of a cough and some back-ache, but then she always gets that at this time
of year. I am sure there is some other reason for her leaving. Can anyone have
offended her? She is such a serious child. I should hate to think of anyone offending
her after our two families have been getting on so well together all these years.’
‘Who could possibly have offended her?’ said Xi-feng, smiling.
‘I wondered if Bao-yu might have done,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He is so careless about
what he says, so tactless. When he gets excited he is capable of saying almost
anything.’
‘I don’t think you have much to worry about on that account,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Bao-yu
may behave foolishly in com?pany, but when he is with our girls, or even the maids,
he is always extremely considerate. His greatest anxiety is always how not to offend
them. He is certainly the last person I should expect to hear any of our girls complain
about. I should think Cousin Chai’s leaving has much more to do with that search we
carried out in the Garden the other night. She would naturally infer from it that the
people in the Garden are not trusted; and since she knew we would never search her
people because of her position here as our guest, she might well conclude that the
only way in which she could clear them of suspicion would be to move outside. I’m
sure that’s why she went: to avoid suspicion.’
To Lady Wang, too, this seemed the most likely explanation. She studied the floor
thoughtfully for some moments; then she had Bao-chai summoned, explained to her
what had happened, and assured her that she must not think herself under the least
suspicion. She must move back into the Garden at once and continue living there as
before.
Bao-chai smiled courteously but held her ground.
‘I had been meaning to move out some time ago, Aunt, but did not like to mention
it to you because I knew you were so much occupied with other matters. It was the
coincidence of Mamma’s being poorly and her two most reliable maids both going
sick at the same time which decided me to move out when I did. Now that you know
about my leaving, I should like to ask formally for permission to move out my things.’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng both laughed.
‘You are too unbending,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Do, please, move in again. Do not allow a
trifle like this to come between us.’
Bao-chai smiled.
‘I assure you, Aunt, you are quite mistaken. It really isn’t because of what you think
that I am leaving the Garden. It is because Mamma has been in rather low spirits
lately and there’s no one but me for her to rely on during the night. And be?sides,
Pan is getting married shortly, and there is still a lot of sewing to do and household
things to get. Mamma badly needs to have me at hand all the time to help her with
the preparations. You know how things are in my family, so you know that I am not
making this up. And there is another reason. Ever since I first moved into the Garden,
the little south-east corner gate has been left open. This was done specially for our
convenience, but of course there is nothing to prevent anyone else using it who
wants to take a short cut. No one going through it is ever questioned. Now suppose
the wrong person got in by that way and something awful happened. It would make
it very awkward for all of us. When I first moved into the Garden it didn’t matter
much one way or the other if I spent the nights there. We were all very much
younger then and there wasn’t so much that needed doing at home. It seemed
better for me to be sewing or playing in the Garden with the other girls than moping
at home on my own. But now we are older it is rather different. I am sure that the
worries you have had during this past year or two have been aggravated by the fact
that the Garden is too big to keep all the time under your surveillance. Any reduction
in the number of people living there means some reduction in the number of your
worries. That is why I am not only determined to move permanently out of the
Garden myself, Aunt, but would seriously urge you to make whatever other reduction
in numbers may be necessary. You mustn’t think that for a great household like yours
to retrench would be undignified. Look how modestly we live nowadays. It was a very
different style we used to live in when I was a little girl.’
It was unusual for Bao-chai to speak at such length. When she had finished, Xi-feng
turned with an amused expression to Lady Wang.
‘I think you will have to let her have her way, Aunt. You can’t force her to move in if
she doesn’t want to.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘I find what you say unanswerable,’ she told Bao-chai. ‘You will have to do as you
think best.’
While she was speaking, Bao-yu came in to report that he was back.
‘Father is still at the party,’ he said. ‘He told us to come back now because he was
afraid it might be going on much longer and he didn’t want us coming back in the
dark.’
‘I hope you didn’t disgrace yourself,’ said Lady Wang anxiously.
‘Not in the least,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Look at all the loot we’ve brought back!’
The old women from the inner gate who, as he entered, had relieved his pages of the
things they had been carrying, now came forward with them for Lady Wang to
inspect. There were three fans, three fan-pendants, three boxes of writing-brushes,
three boxes of ink-sticks, three rosaries and three jade belt-buckles: one of
everything for each of the three boys.
‘The fans and fan-pendants are from Academician Mei,’ said Bao-yu, ‘the ink-sticks
and brushes are from Vice-President Yang, and the rosaries and buckles are from
Under-Secretary Li.’ He fished out a little sandalwood Buddha-charm from inside his
jacket. ‘This is from the Duke of Qing-guo. He only gave one to me.’
Lady Wang questioned him about the other people who had been present and the
poems that had been composed. She told someone to take Bao-yu’s share of the
presents and go with him and the other two boys to see Grandmother Jia.
Grand?mother Jia was of course delighted, and Bao-yu found him?self having to
answer all the same questions over again. His anxiety to learn about Skybright made
him anxious to get away, and after answering a few of them, he told his grandmother
that he had been riding rather fast and was aching all over from his ride.
‘You must go back to your room at once then and change into more comfortable
clothes,’ she said. ‘You’ll feel better when you’ve had a chance to relax; but don’t,
whatever you do, lie down.’
Bao-yu left his grandmother’s without more ado. Musk and Ripple, with two of the
junior maids from Green Delights, were waiting for him outside. Ripple took charge
of his share of the presents and she and the other two trotted along after him as he
strode into the Garden.
‘Phew! I’m hot,’ he said, divesting himself of hat, belt and outer garment as he
walked along and handing them to Musk to carry. He was wearing a gown of lined
damask underneath, whose viridian green contrasted strikingly with the flashes of
blood-red trouser revealed through the side-slits as he walked along. Ripple
recognized the trousers as Skybright’s handiwork.
‘“Objects remind us”,’ she said, quoting from the well-known proverb. Musk
nudged her reprovingly and tried to change the subject.
‘Yes,’ she said lightly, ‘the red of the trousers goes very well with the dark green of
the gown. What with them and his blue-black boots and his greeny-black hair and his
snow-white face he makes quite a picture!’
Bao-yu, walking slightly ahead of them, pretended not to have heard; but after going
only a few steps further, he halted abruptly.
‘Oh dear, I have to pay a little call!’ he said. ‘What am I going to do?’
‘That’s all right,’ said Musk. ‘We’re not going to lose you in broad daylight!’
She told the two junior maids to go with him.
‘Ripple and I will come back for you when we’ve got rid of these.’
‘Can’t you wait?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shan’t be a moment.’
‘Oh, do let us get rid of these things first!’ said Musk. ‘Whatever must we look like,
traipsing after you with all this stuff? Like the Wardrobe Master and the Clerk of the
Ink-horn in a royal procession!’
Bao-yu, who had been hoping that they would go, indicated that they might do so
and went off with the two junior maids to a secluded corner behind some rocks
where he could question them.
‘Did Aroma send anyone to Skybright’s place after I had gone?’
‘Yes, she sent Mamma Song,’ said one of the girls.
‘What did Mamma Song say when she got back?’
‘They told her that Skybright was lying with her head back calling out all night long,
but in the early morning she stopped calling and closed her eyes. They said it looked
as if she was going.’
‘Who was she calling for?’ Bao-yu asked hurriedly.
‘Her mother,’ said the girl. ‘They said she just went on calling “Mamma!”
“Mamma!” all night long.’
‘Didn’t she call for anyone else?’ said Bao-yu, brushing away a tear.
‘They didn’t mention anyone else,’ said the girl.
‘Oh, you’re a silly girl!’ said Bao-yu impatiently. ‘I’m sure you must have misheard.’
‘She certainly is a silly girl,’ the other little maid piped up. A sharp little creature,
she had sensed at once what Bao-yu was hoping for and was willing to supply it. ‘I
not only heard exactly what Mrs Song said; I even managed to slip out and see
Skybright myself.’
‘How did you come to do that?’ Bao-yu asked her.
‘Remembering how much kinder than any of the other senior maids Skybright had
always been to me,’ said the girl, ‘I thought to myself that though I couldn’t do
anything else for her in her trouble, I could at least go to visit her. Even if someone
saw me and reported me to Her Ladyship and I got a beating, it would be worth it
after all she had done for me. So, at the risk of a beating, I stole round to her cousin’s
place to see her. Although she was so near death, her mind was quite unaltered. She
held my hand and opened her eyes wide when she saw me. “Where’s Bao-yu gone?”
she said. When I told her, she sighed. “Oh,” she said, “I shan’t be able to see him,
then.” “Can’t you hold out a bit?” I asked her. She smiled at me. “No,” she said. “You
see, I’m not really dying; I’m going to heaven to be a flower-spirit. The Jade Emperor
has given me the job of looking after the flowers.” She said, “I have to leave at
half-past two to take up the job, and Bao?-yu won’t be home until a quarter to three,
so we shall miss seeing each other by only a quarter of an hour. Usually when people
are dying, King Yama sends his demons to fetch their souls, and if you want to delay a
bit, all you have to do is burn a bit of spirit money and make a little offering of some
rice and tea, and they will leave you alone for a few minutes while they go after the
money and stuff. But when the heavenly messengers summon you, it’s different. You
can’t keep them waiting for a single moment.” At the time I didn’t quite believe her,
but when I got back I kept my eye on the clock and sure enough it was exactly a
quarter to three, as she’d said it would be, when they told us you’d got back and we
were to go over and wait for you.’
‘You can’t read,’ said Bao-yu, ‘so you wouldn’t know about these things. But there
are in fact flower-spirits: I’ve read about them. Not only is there a spirit in charge of
all the flowers, but there are also lesser spirits in charge of each separate kind of
flower. I wonder which Skybright is going to be.’
The little maid quickly glanced round the Garden for inspiration. Her eye lit on some
hibiscus bushes which, this being now the second half of autumn, were already in full
bloom.
‘I asked her myself,’ she said. “‘Tell me what kind of flower you are going to be
responsible for,” I said, “so that after you are gone we shall know where and when to
make you offerings.” “I’ll tell you,” she said, “but you mustn’t let anyone else but
Bao-yu know about it. These are immortal matters which are supposed to be kept
secret.” Then she told me: the hibiscus flower.’
Bao-yu found nothing extraordinary in this. On the contrary, after hearing it, his
sorrow turned instantly into delight. He looked round and smiled happily as his eyes
rested on the hibiscus bushes.
‘Such a flower is worthy to be looked after by such a person!’ he said. ‘I felt sure
that someone of her qualities would have work to do in the world. But -’ he became
sad once more as he reflected - ‘although her sufferings are over, it still means that I
shall never see her again.’
Then it occurred to him that, though he had failed to be with her at the end, there
was nothing to stop him going to see her now and paying his last respects to her body.
After the five or six years she had been with him and all that she had done for him in
that time, he surely owed it to her. He hurried back to carry out this resolve, running
into Musk and Ripple on his way. They had just started out again to look for him.
Back at Green Delights he hurriedly dressed up again and, telling the girls that he was
going to pay a call on Dai-yu, slipped out of the Garden and made his way, on his own
this time, to the place where he had visited Skybright the day hefore, expecting to
find her laid out there in her coffin.
Skybright had died not, as the lying maid had said, that afternoon, but early in the
morning. As soon as she had breathed her last, the cousin and his wife had gone to
the mansion to tell Lady Wang in the hope of getting some money out of her for the
funeral. Lady Wang had given them ten taels and told them to get the body out of
the house as quickly as possible and have it cremated.
‘The girl died of a consumption,’ she said. ‘You mustn’t keep the body in the house,
whatever you do.’
Impressed by this advice, they had hurried off with the money and made
arrangements to have the body encoffined and carried to the burning ground outside
the city without delay. Skybright’s clothes and jewellery, worth between three and
four hundred taels, they kept for themselves: a nice little sum to put by for their old
age. When all the arrangements had been completed, they shut up the house and
accompanied the hearse outside the city to see the body cremated. Bao-yu arrived,
therefore, to find the house locked up and nobody at home. Once more frustrated,
he stood for some minutes gazing blankly at the door. Finally, since there was nothing
else he could do, he turned round and walked back to the Garden. The thought of
returning to his room was distasteful to him. He decided to call in at Dai-yu’s on the
way back; but Dai-yu’s maids told him that their mistress was out.
‘She’s gone to see Miss Bao,’ they said.
Bao-ya made his way to All-spice Court. To his surprise he found it silent and
deserted, and when he peeped inside, he could see that it had the empty, cheerless
look of an uninhabited house. He had a vague recollection of having heard some days
previously that Bao-chai was thinking of moving out; but he had been so busy with
homework during the past few days that it had gone out of his mind. Now it
appeared that she really had moved.
A sort of blankness came over him. Chess had gone. Picture had gone. Parfumée and
the other four little actresses had gone. Skybright was dead. Now, it seemed, Bao-hai
and her lot had gone, too. And though Ying-chun was supposed to have left only
temporarily, to judge from the number of visits made by match-makers during the
past weeks, it would not be very long before she was getting married. The Garden’s
little society was breaking up.
‘Oh well,’ he thought, ‘no good fretting about it now. I’ll go and enjoy Dai-yu’s
company for a while; and after that, I’ve still got Aroma to go back to. It looks as if we
three will soon be the only ones left.’
In that philosophical frame of mind he went back to the Naiad’s House; but Dai-yu
had still not returned. Just as he was wondering where else he could go, a maid from
Lady Wang’s apartment came up to him with a message from his mother.
‘The Master’s back now and wants to see you. He says he’s got a good subject for a
poem and you are to come at once.’
Bao-yu was obliged to accompany the girl to his mother’s apartment; but by the time
he got there, his father had already gone. Lady Wang ordered some of her women to
accompany him to his father’s study outside. He found Jia Zheng discussing the
highlights of the chrysanthemum-viewing party with his literary gentlemen.
‘Shortly before the gathering broke up,’ he was telling them, ‘there was some
discussion about an episode from the history of the last dynasty. It was a story in
which the romantic, the edifying, the heroic and the pathetic were all exemplified -
indeed, one of the most remarkable stories I have ever heard. Everyone present
agreed that it deserved a poem to commemorate it.’
‘Pray tell us the story,’ said the literary gentlemen, intrigued.
‘It seems that there was a member of the Imperial clan called Prince Heng,’ Jia
Zheng began, ‘who had gone out to become Military Governor of Qing-zhou. As well
as being a fanatically keen soldier, the Prince was inordinately fond of female
company, and in the free time left over from his official duties, found a way of
combining these two interests by recruiting a large number of beautiful young
women whom he had trained in military arts. Every day these young women would
be made to engage in mock combat and other warlike exercises for the Prince’s
entertainment. The most beautiful and also the most militarily accomplished of these
young women was a certain Miss Lin, who, because she was the fourth daughter in
her family, was known by the name of “Fourth Sister Lin”. Prince Heng thought so
highly of her that he gave her a colonelcy and put her in command of the whole
female troop. From then on he took to calling her “Colonel Winsome” or “the
Winsome Colonel”.’
‘How priceless!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen rapturously. “‘The Winsome
Colonel”! What a marvellous com?bination! Surely this Prince Heng must have been
one of the most eccentrically romantic persons the world has known?’
‘One could certainly call him that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘But there is stranger still to
follow.’
‘Stranger still?’ said the literary gentlemen with surprise. ‘Then this must be a very
strange tale indeed.’
‘In the second year of his governorship,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘a horde of bandits,
latter-day descendants of the Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows of the Han period,
swept over the whole of Shantung Province, looting and pillaging as they went. The
Prince, scorning to mobilize fully against an enemy whom he regarded as a mere
rabblement of sheep and curs, took the field against them himself at the head of only
a light force of cavalry. But the rebel leadership, by an unexpected combination of
cunning and low trickery, defeated him in two successive engagements. In the second
of these the Prince himself died fighting.
‘In Qing-zhou the civil and military authorities were in a panic.
“‘What could you or I hope to do when the Prince himself has failed?” they asked
each other, and began to make plans for yielding up the city to the rebels.
‘But Fourth Sister Lin’s reaction to the grim news was to gather her fellow-officers
together and address them as follows:
“‘Our beloved Prince’s goodness to us was such that we could never have repaid
even a small fraction of it as long as we lived. Now that he has laid down his life for
his country, I feel that we in turn ought to lay our lives down for him. Those who feel
as I do, follow me. Those who do not are free to leave now, while there is time.”
“‘We will follow you!” the girls cried with a single voice; and that night, under the
cover of darkness, they rode out from the walls of Qing-zhou into the midst of the
rebel camp. At first, because the rebels were unprepared, they succeeded in killing
and decapitating several of their leaders; but it was not long before those in the
camp realized that the raiders were a party of women who could easily be overcome
if offered determined resistance. Seizing their weapons and rallying themselves
together, they fell upon Fourth Sister Lin and her band with such ferocity that soon
the girls’ heroic vow to die for their Prince was fulfilled, for not a single one of them
was left alive.
‘The Emperor and the entire Court were deeply affected when news of this was
brought to them. It is to be assumed that a suitable person was then appointed to
command operations against the rebels and that the rebel horde melted away at the
first appearance of the Imperial forces - we are not concerned with that. But what of
Fourth Sister Lin, gentlemen? Do you not find her an admirable person?’
‘Admirable indeed!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘And what a marvellous subject for
a poem! We must all of us try to make one up about her.’
One of their number took a writing-brush and inkstone and wrote down the story
almost exactly as Jia Zheng had told it, slightly modifying it here and there in the
interest of style, to serve as a short preface for their poem. When he had finished it,
he handed it to Jia Zheng for his approval.
‘Yes, that seems to me exactly as it should be,’ said Jia Zheng after glancing briefly
through it. ‘It was a preface rather like this one that started off the discussion at our
gathering. An Imperial directive was received at the Department yesterday asking for
a search to be made in the records of this and the preceding dynasty for hitherto
neglected instances of outstanding merit deserving some posthumous recognition.
No class of persons was to be excluded: monks, nuns, beggars, women and girls - all
were eligible. Wherever exceptional merit could be established, a brief account of it
was to be forwarded to the Board of Rites for inclusion in the list of
recommendations. The preface they were discussing at our gathering was a copy of
the account sent in by our Department to the Board. It was reading that preface that
gave those present the idea that they should write a “Winsome Colonel” poem in
commemoration of Fourth Sister Lin’s heroic loyalty.’
‘And very right that they should!’ said the literary gentlemen smilingly. ‘But what is
most admirable of all about this story is the tireless benevolence of the present Court
which led to the unearthing of this forgotten heroism. Surely this is a thing
unparalleled in any former age? The Tang poet’s line
This holy age, when nothing good’s omitted,
might almost have been written in anticipation of the present reign.’
‘Indeed!’ Jia Zheng nodded gravely.
By this time Jia Huan and Jia Lan had also arrived. Jia Zheng allowed the three boys to
look at the preface and then told them that he wanted a poem from each one of
them. He would award a prize to whoever completed one first and another prize for
the best poem.
Jia Huan and Jia Lan had several times recently been called upon to compose in
company and so were not unduly nervous on this occasion. After reading the preface,
all three boys went off into separate corners to think. Jia Lan was the first to finish a
poem and Jia Huan, fearful of being outstripped by his young nephew, made haste to
follow. The two of them had already written their poems out while Bao-yu was still
thinking. Jia Zheng and the literary gentlemen decided to look first at what the two
younger boys had written. Jia Lan’s contribution was in the form of a quatrain.
Fourth Sister Lin was the Winsome Colonel’s name:
She was beautiful and gentle, yet her valour none could tame.
In Qing-zhou where, her Prince to avenge, she threw her life away,
The very ground on which she fell is fragrant to this day.
The literary gentlemen praised the little poem enthusiastically.
‘For a young boy of his years to produce such a poem is proof of a highly cultured
upbringing,’ they said.
‘Childish prattle! Childish prattle!’ Jia Zheng laughed deprecatingly. ‘Still, for one of
his tender years it is quite a creditable effort.’
Next they read Jia Huan’s contribution. It was a Regulated Verse poem in
pentameters.
The lovely lady would not sit and grieve;
For sterner thoughts her warlike breast did fill.
She dried her woman’s tears and fearless rode
Through Qing-zhou’s gates to be killed and to kill.
‘However great the odds,’ she said, ‘I can
‘My debt repay, if not avenge this ill.’
The inscription graved upon her tomb shall be:
‘Here buried lies the world’s fidelity.’
‘Ah yes!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘What a difference those few years between
them make! This is quite a different approach.’
‘I suppose it’s not too bad,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but it doesn’t really do justice to the
subject.’
‘Oh well, as to that -!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘After all, our young friend is not
so very much older than his nephew. Old heads are not to be expected on young
shoulders! Give them a few more years and I don’t doubt we shall have a pair of
poets in our midst to rival Ruan Ji and his nephew Ruan Xian!’
‘Come, come, they are not as good as that!’ said Jia Zheng, smiling. ‘They don’t
study hard enough, that’s their trouble.’
He asked Bao-yu how he was getting on.
‘After all this careful chiselling, Mr Bao’s poem is sure to be something of quite a
different order from these two we have just heard,’ said the literary gentlemen’ - one,
no doubt, in which the romantic and tragic aspects of the theme will both be fully
exploited.’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘I don’t think Regulated Verse is quite the right medium for this subject. It calls for
something longer - a song or ballad in the Old Style - to do it justice.’
‘You see!’ said the literary gentlemen, some jumping to their feet, some nodding or
clapping in their enthusiasm. ‘We said that his contribution would be quite different!
It is the sign of a good, experienced writer to be able to gauge immediately what
form will be most appropriate to the sub?ject. With a title like this and a preface,
clearly what is called for is either a long narrative poem like Bo Ju-yi’s “The
Ever?lasting Remorse” or an Old Style ode like Wen Ting-yun’s “On Hearing Guo
Dao-yuan Play the Musical Glasses” or Li He’s “Return from Gui-ji”, in which narrative
and lyrical elements combine. Only the greater freedom of the Old Style allows for
the smoother, more flowing development that this subject calls for.’
Jia Zheng was of the same opinion. He took brush and paper and prepared to write.
‘So be it, then. Recite your lines, my boy, and I shall take them down for you. They
had better be good after this boastfill preliminary, or I shall beat your bottom!’
Bao-yu recited his first line:
Prince Heng was fond of a pretty face and of martial arts also -
Jia Zheng copied the words down and then shook his head over what he had written.
‘Vulgar and pedestrian!’
‘No, no, it isn’t vulgar,’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘That is what the Ballad
Style is like. Wait and see how it goes on.’
‘All right, we’ll let it pass,’ said Jia Zheng.
Bao-yu continued.
So he trained the ladies of his court to ride and draw the bow.
In ravishing songs and beguiling dances the Prince took no delight,
But to watch the pike-drill he was fain of fair maids in a row.
He waited while Jia Zheng finished writing down the lines. The literary gentlemen
professed themselves particularly impressed by the ‘ravishing songs’ line, claiming to
see a quality of ‘rugged strength’ in it which they deemed highly appropriate in a
ballad. The fourth line, which they called ‘pure narrative’, was also, they thought,
exactly as it should be.
‘You shouldn’t praise the boy so,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You will turn his head. Let’s see
how he manages to develop this in his second stanza.’
Bao-yu recited:
As he watched them drill, he scarcely saw the clouds of dust arise;
’Twas the lovely Colonel’s lamplit face that swam before his eyes.
‘Bravo!’ shouted the literary gentlemen. “‘He scarcely saw the clouds of dust” leads
us on to the “lamplit face” of the heroine. A most ingenious development! The way
every word is used in these two lines is quite masterful!’
Bao-yu continued:
When the rosy lips framed their harsh commands he could smell the mouth’s sweet
breath;
But the weapons oft shook in the fair white hands, too weak for such exercise.
The literary gentlemen laughed and clapped their hands.
‘What a wonderful picture! I think friend Bao must have been among those present
at the time. He saw the white hand shake and smelt the perfume. How else could he
describe it all so vividly?’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Women drilling, however bold and fierce they might be, could never look quite the
same as men. One can assume the occasional softness creeping in without having
had any special experience.’
‘Oh, get on!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘We can do without the comment.’
Bao-yu thought a little before beginning the next stanza.
The lotus belt round the Colonel’s waist in a clove-shaped knot was tied –
     ‘The change of rhyme from “eyes” to “eyed” is one example of that smooth,
flowing development we were just now talking about,’ said the literary gentlemen.
‘Also, this line has just that touch of charm and prettiness that the subject calls for.’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘I don’t like this line at all. We have already heard
about her “mouth’s sweet breath” and her “fair white hand” in the last stanza. Why
does he need to go on in this strain? I think it is mere weakness of invention that
leads to this piling up of descriptive bric-à-brac.’
‘ A long ballad needs a few ornamental, descriptive passages,’ said Bao-yu,
‘otherwise it would seem too bare.’
‘You are continuing the same kind of description into a new stanza,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘When are you going to get on to her warlike side? If you have another two or three
lines of this kind of stuff, it’s going to seem like drawing legs on a snake!’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll try to make a quick change to the warlike side and then
finish the whole description off in this one stanza.’
‘What a genius!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically. ‘You begin with a line that looks like
the first item in a long catalogue, and now you are talking about instant changes and
abrupt conclusions. I think you may find that you have bitten off rather more than
you can chew!’
Bao-yu hung his head and pondered a while before finally coming out with this line:
Yet it was not strung pearls that hung from it, but the good sword at her side.
‘Will that do?’ he asked anxiously.
The literary gentlemen banged on the table and cheered.
‘We’ll leave it,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Carry on.’
‘If it will do, I’ll continue as I’ve planned,’ said Bao-yu. If not, it would be better to
cross it out and I’ll try to think of something completely different and develop in
another direction.’
Jia Zheng shouted at him angrily.
‘Hold your tongue, sir! Do it again if it’s not good enough, indeed! How many times
do you propose to go on trying? Ten times? A hundred? Save your energy and get
on!’
Bao-yu resigned himself to developing from the line he had just recited. He thought
for some moments before continning.
When late at night the jousting ended, her courage was quite spent,
And her handkerchief with carmine sweat from her streaming face was dyed.
‘That’s the end of another stanza,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Now how are you going on?’
Bao-yu continued:
Next year the whole North-east land with rebels was a-run,
Like ravening beasts, or swarming bees after the queen has flown –
      ‘ “A-run” is good,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘It is little touches like that that
show the master-hand at work. The narrative style in this stanza is good, too. Lively.’
Bao-yu continued:
The Prince led forth the Emperor’s men the rebel hordes to quell.
  He fought them once and he fought them twice, but his army was overthrown.
A stench of blood upon the wind blighted the standing corn,
And on empty tents and an empty camp the setting sun went down.
*
‘Twas the rainy time, and sounding rills down the lone green hillsides sped
When Prince Heng, his fighting ended, on the battlefield lay dead.
Now rain has washed the white bones clean, but not the blood-soaked grass,
And as the moon rises, shivering ghosts stand at each corpse’s head.
‘Brilliant!’ cried the literary gentlemen. ‘The narrative style, the imagery, the choice
of words are all quite perfect. But now what about Fourth Sister Lin? What ingenious
new development will bring her back upon the scene?’
Bao-yu recited:
The officers refused to fight for fear they might be killed,
    And with no defenders, Qing-zhou’s fate seemed already to be sealed.
But though the men were all afraid, the girls were loyal and true:
And among them Prince Heng’s favourite with especial zeal was filled.
‘Neatly turned!’ said the literary gentlemen.
‘It took four lines to do it, though,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too much! And I expect there is
more useless verbiage to follow.’
Bao-yu continued:
Now who the Prince’s favourite was to you shall be revealed:
    Fourth Sister Lin she was by name, the Winsome Colonel called.
She rallied her companions fair and issued a command,
And like a troop of lovely flowers they rode into the field.
*
Their heavy saddle-cloths are wet with tears of the spring sky’s woe,
   And the iron of their armour chills them, as through the cold night they go.
Though the outcome may be uncertain; they have taken a solemn vow,
Whate’er befall, before they die, for the Prince to strike a blow.
*
But what chance against their savage foe had that gallant band?
Like gentle flowers they perished, crushed by a brutal hand.
The horses’ hooves are fragrant yet that trod them in the mud;
   Near the city walls their poor ghosts flit, where they made their final stand.
*
A courier riding through the night to the Emperor’s city came,
And all who heard his heavy news with sadness did exclaim.
The Son of Heaven looked aghast when he learned of Qing-zhou’s fall,
And his captains and his counsellors all hung their heads for shame.
*
The captains and the counsellors and men of high degree
Were put to shame by Fourth Sister Lin’s fidelity.
For Fourth Sister Lin my heart with grief doth swell,
And though my song is ended now, my thoughts on her still dwell.
The literary gentlemen broke into loud acclaim as Bao-yu finished. It seemed at first
as if they might go on indefinitely. Subsiding at last, they read the whole poem
through again from the beginning.
‘It is certainly a very long poem,’ said Jia Zheng, smiling, ‘but for all that, I don’t
think it really does justice to the subject.’
He turned to the three boys:
‘All right, off you go!’
The three of them went off, feeling like condemned prisoners who have suddenly
been given a reprieve. For the two younger ones it was the end of their day: a
blessed nothingness until bedtime. But Bao-yu was still grieving for Skybright. The
sight of the hibiscus by the lake reminded him of what the little maid had told him
about her. As he stood gaz?ing sorrowfully at the bushes, an idea suddenly came to
him.
‘Since I wasn’t able to see her in her coffin, why don’t I pay my last respects to her
here, in the presence of her flowers?’
He was on the point of kneeling down in front of them when another thought
occurred to him.
‘That’s all very well, but I can’t do it just anyhow. In order to show proper respect I
must first make sure that I am dressed correctly. And I must prepare a little ceremony
and make her some sort of offering.’
This led to further cogitation.
‘It says somewhere in the classics, “Where there is faith enough and goodwill,
duckweed boiled in puddle-water is an offering acceptable to the gods and a dish fit
to be set before princes.” Proper respect evidently has nothing to do with the value
of the offering. And I could always write something to read out before I made it.’
He began to plan what he would write. ‘An elegy’ it would be called. It would be a bit
like one of those long Chu poems – Li sao or The Summons of the Soul - but with
elements of other things as well. And of course a lot of it would be original. He sat
down and began writing it as soon as he got back to his apartment. As it was to
please himself, he could be as wild and extravagant as he liked and compose as
quickly as his imagination would let him. Soon the draft was finished, and he took a
piece of white material of the kind they call ‘mer?maid silk’, which he knew Skybright
had been fond of, and after first writing the title on it in large characters:
THE SPIRIT OF THE HIBISCUS:
AN ELEGY AND INVOCATION
he copied out the text in a neat kai-shu hand and carried it with him into the Garden.
The little maid who had told him about Skybright’s transformation had to follow him
with some things for the offering on a tray: a cup of tea, some autumn flowers in a
vase of water, and some charcoal in a little burner for starting a fire with. When his
solemn bowings and kneelings were over, he hung the silk up on the branches of a
hibiscus and began tearfully to read out the words:
The year being one in the era of Immutable Peace, the month that in which the
Sweet odours of hibiscus and cassia compete, the day, a heavy and doleful day, I,
most wretched and disconsolate JADE of the House of Green Delights, having with
due reverence prepared and got together buds of flowers, silk of mermaids, water of
the Drenched Blos?soms stream and Fung Loo tea (all things of little value in
themselves, yet sufficient to attest the devotion of a true believer) do here offer
them up in sacrifice to her that has now, in the Palace of the White God) become
SPIRIT OF THE HIBISCUS, having power and dominion over the flowers of autumn.
It is now sixteen years since the BLEST SPIRIT de?scended into the world of men. As
to her native place and the lineage in which she was born, they were long since
forgotten; but for five years and eight months of that time she was, in my rising up
and lying down, in my washings and combings, in my rest and play, my constant close
companion and helpmate.
It is to be recorded of her that in estimation she was more precious than gold or jade,
in nature more pure than ice or snow, in wit more brilliant than the sun or stars, in
complexion more beautiful than the moon or than flowers. Who of the maidens did
not admire her accomplishments? Who among the matrons did not marvel at her
sagacity?
But if baleful scritch-owls that hate the heights can cause the kingly eagle to be taken
in a net, and rank and stinking weeds, envious of another’s fragrance, can cause the
sweet herb of grace to be uprooted, it is not to be thought that a shrinking flower
could withstand the whirlwind’s blast, or a tender willow-tree be proof against the
buffetings of the tempest. When the envenomed tongue of slander was wagged
against her, she pined inwardly with a wasting sickness: the red of her cherry lips
faded and only sad and plaintive sounds issued out of them; the bloom of her apricot
cheeks withered and none but lean and haggard looks were to be seen upon them.
Slanders and slights crept from behind every curtain; thorns and thistles choked up
the doors and windows of her chamber. Yet truly she had done no infamous thing.
She entered a silent victim into the eternal, a wronged innocent into the everlasting:
a more notable martyr (though but a mere girl) to the envy of excellence than he
who was drowned at Long Sands; a more pitiable sufferer from the peril of plain
dealing than he that was slain upon Feather Mountain.
Yet since she stored up her bitterness in silence, none recognized the treasure that
was lost in her, cut off so young. The fair cloud dispersed, leaving no means to trace
the beauteous outline of its former shape. It were a hard thing to hunt out the Isle of
the Blest from among the multi?tudinous islands of the ocean and bring back the
immortal herb that should restore her: the raft is lost that went to look for it.
It was but yesterday that I painted those delicate smoke-black eyebrows; and who is
there today to warm the cold jade rings for her fingers? The medicine she drank
stands yet upon the stove; the tears are still wet on the garment she once wore. The
phoenix has flown and MUSK’s vanity-box has burst apart for sorrow; the dragon has
departed, and RIPPLE’s comb has broken its teeth for grief. The magpie has forsaken
my chamber: it is in vain for the maidens to hang up their needles on Seventh Night
and pray for nimble fingers. My buckle with the love-ducks is broken: the seamstress
is no more who could repair the silk-work of its girdle.
And this being the season of autumn when the power of metal predominates and the
White God is master of the earth, the signs themselves are melancholy. I wake from
dreams of her on a lonely couch and in an empty room. As the moon veils herself
behind the trees of the garden, the moonlight and the sweet form I dreamed of are
in the same moment extinguished; as the perfume fades from the hangings of my
bedchamber, the laboured breath and whispered words I strove to catch at the same
time fail silent. Dew pearls the pavement’s moss; the launderer’s beat is borne in
unceasingly through my casement. Rain wets the wall-fig; a flute’s complaint carries
uncertainly from a near-by courtyard.
Her sweet name is not extinguished, for the parrot in his cage under the eaves ceases
not to repeat it; and the crabtree in my courtyard whose half-withering was a
foretokening of her fate stands yet her memorial. But no more shall the sound of her
lotus feet betray her at hide-and-seek behind the screen; no more will her fingers cull
budding orchids for the game of match-my-flower in the garden. The embroidery
silks are thrown aside in a tangle: never again will she cut them with her silver
scissors. The sheeny silk lies creased and crumpled: never again shall her hot-iron
smooth out its perfumed folds.
In her last hour, when I might else have gone to her, I was called in haste from the
Garden by a Father’s summons; when, grieving, I sought to take leave of her
abandoned body, I could not see it because it had been removed by a Mother’s
command; and when I was told that her corpse had been consumed, I repented of
my jesting vow that we should share the same grave-hole together, for that were
now impossible, and that our ashes should commingle, for ash she is already
become.
In the burning-ground by the old temple, green ghost-fires flicker when the west
wind blows. On its derelict mounds, scattered bones gleam whitely in the setting sun.
The wind sighs in the tall trees and rustles in the dried-up grasses below. Gibbons call
sadly from tombs that are hidden in the mist, and ghosts flit weeping down the
alley-ways between the tombs. At such times must the young man in his
crimson-curtained bed seem most cruelly afflicted; at such times must the maiden
beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated.
The tears of Ru-nan fall in bloody drops upon the wind, and the complaint of Golden
Valley is made to the moon in silence. Vengeance is for demons and baleful bogles;
the gentle spirits of maidens are not wont to be jealous, though wronged. Natheless
shall the backbiters not lightly escape her; their mouths shall be squeezed in vices;
the hearts of those cruel harridans shall he ripped: for her anger is kindled against
them.
Though the bond between us was a slight one, yet can it not easily he broken; and
because she was ever close to me in my thoughts, I could not forbear to make
earnest inquiry concerning her. Thus it was revealed to me that the God had sent
down the banner of his authority and summoned her to his Palace of Flowers, to the
end that she who in life was like a flower should in death have dominion over the
hibiscus. At first when I heard the words of the little maid touching this appointment,
I thought them fantastical; but now that I have pondered them in my heart, I know
them to be worthy of perfect credence. How so?
Did not Ye Fa-shan compel Li Yong’s sleeping spirit to compose an epitaph? And was
not the soul of Li He summoned in order that he might write a memorial in heaven?
The circumstances may differ, but the principle is the same. God chooses his
ministers according to their capabilities, else how could they discharge the duties
that are required of them? And who more fit and meet than her to be given this
charge that has been laid upon her? Truly, here at last she has a work that is worthy
of her.
And because I would have her descend here in this place, I have composed these
verses to invoke her with, fearing that the common speech of mortals might be
offensive to her immortal ear.
The Invocation
All’s clearest azure above * where her team of white wyverns through the welkin
wends,
And the world in a haze below * as her chryselephantine car to the earth descends.
Her awning’s relucent splendour * outshines Antares and his starry band,
Her guidons and gonfalons go before * and the stars of Aquarius guard her on either
hand.
Cloudcleaver follows as escort * Moondriver gallops to clear the way ahead.
I can hear the creak and trundle of chariot-wheels * of her phoenix-figured car’s
majestic tread.
I can smell the enveloping perfume * of her cincture from fragrant stalks of asarum
twined,
See the dazzle of her dress * gleaming with moon-jade ouches, fretted and lined.
I’ll strew the altar with lily-of-the-valley leaves * and have water?-lilies for lamps fed
with orchid oil,
And in chalices cunningly fashioned from calabash * pour rarest metheglin flavoured
with penny-royal.
As I fasten my gaze on the clouds * methinks I see a faint glimmer of her face;
As I strain my ear on the silence * I seem to hear a faint echo of her voice.
But she, on a tryst with eternity, brooking no coarctation * has abandoned me, cruel,
here in the dust to lie,
Calling on Windlord in vain to drive me up after her * to ride side by side with her
across the sky.
My heart is all wracked with teen * yet it boots not to weep and wail:
You are gone now to your long sleep * against Nature’s order no power on earth can
prevail.
In the grave-vault secure you rest * the bourne after which there is no more
transformation.
But to me still in bonds in this hateful wen below * O Spirit, succouring come for my
consolation!
O Spirit, come and abide for my consolation!

But what though she is present in this place? She is girt about with silence;
she is veiled in a mist of invisibility; I cannot see her:

Only the green wreathed creepers that make her side-screens,
And the ranks of tall bullrushes, her guardsmen’s spears.
The sleepy willow-buds waken as she approaches;
And the bitter lotus-seeds sweeten as she nears.
The White Virgin waits for her on cliffs of cassia;
From Orchid Island the water-sprite comes to greet her.
Jade-player plays for her on a little organ,
And Cold-keys sweeps the iron spine with his metal beater.
The God of the Mid Peak’s consort comes at her bidding;
The crone of Li Mountain is summoned forth to meet her.
The Luo River turtle brings her his magic offering;
To the heavenly music wild beasts gambol and prance.
In the deeps of Red River the dragons are humming the melody;
And in pearl-tree groves the Birds of Paradise dance.

Seeing my reverence and my devoutness of heart (notwith?standing that I have
neither vessels of gold nor vessels of bronze in which to make my offering) she drove
forth her chariot from the City of Sunrise to meet me; but even now her banners are
returning to the Garden of Night. For a little moment it seemed that the invisible
would become visible; but murky vapours rose up suddenly between us and we were
cut off.

Clouds and mists drifted and drew together,
Rain and fog veiled the heaven’s light;
Then rolling back, revealed the high stars
And earth all radiant in the noon of night.

My mind is in a turmoil, uncertain whether I wake or dream. I gaze at the sky with
sighs of disappointmnent; I wait in uncertainty with weeping eyes. My speech grows
silent: only the music of the wind in the grove of bamboos is to be heard, and the
wing-beats of birds as they fly off startled, and the plopping sounds of fish as they
nibble at the surface of the water.
Blest Spirit, may my lament go up to thee; may my rite be acceptable to thee.
Wuhu aizai! Receive this offering!

When he had finished reading, he made a little flame with the burner and set fire to
the silk. Then he poured the tea out on the ground as a libation, scattered the
flowers, and emptied the water out of the vase. He continued to linger there after he
had finished, as though unable to tear himself away, and the little maid had to
remind him several times that they ought to be getting back. He had just started to
go when a laughing voice called out ‘Stop a minute!’ and the maid, turning to look
behind her, saw with terror that a female form was stepping out of the bushes.
‘Help!’ she cried. ‘It’s a ghost! Skybright’s spirit really has come back!’
Bao-yu looked back too. But whether or not it was a ghost he saw will be revealed in
the following chapter.




CHAPTER 79

Xue Pan finds to his sorrow that he is
married to a termagant
And Ying-chun’s parents betroth her
to a Zhong-shan wolf



At the end of the last chapter our story had reached a point at which, just as Bao-yu
and the little maid were beginning to walk away after completing the sacrifice to
Skybright, they were startled by the sound of a human voice coming from the
direction of the flowering hibiscus bushes. When Bao-yu looked, he saw that the
person who had called out was Dai-yu. She advanced towards him smiling.
‘A highly original elegy! It deserves to have a permanent place in literature
alongside the Elegy for the Shaman’s Daughter by Han-dan Chun!’
Bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly.
‘Most elegies one sees are so stale and derivative, I thought I’d try my hand at
writing something a bit different. It was only for my own amusement; I hadn’t
intended that anyone else should hear it. Perhaps now that you have heard it, you
will let me know of any glaring errors you may have noticed and help me to correct
them.’
‘Where is the original text?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I should need to have a careful look at the
text first before venturing on any criticism. It was such a long piece, I could barely
make out what most of it was about. There were a couple of lines somewhere near
the middle that caught my attention:

The young man in his crimson-curtained bed must seem most cruelly afflicted;
And the maiden beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated.

The general sentiment is all right, but I thought “crimson-curtained bed” a trifle
shop-worn. I don’t see why you used that image when there is a much better one to
hand.’
‘Oh, what’s that?’ said Bao-yu.
‘We’ve all got this rose-coloured haze diaphene in our windows,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Instead of “the young man in his crimson-curtained bed”, why not say ‘the young
man at his rosy-misted casement”?’
Bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly.
‘Excellent! How clever of you to have thought of it! It only goes to show that there
is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look. Stupid people
like me fail to think of the obvious. Actually though, I haven’t got that sort of gauze in
my windows; so though “rosy-misted case?ment” is a great improvement, I don’t
think I had better use it. It would be fine for you to use it, but I think if I did it would
be a bit presumptuous.’
‘But why?’ said Dai-yu, smiling. ‘My window is your window. It is unfriendly to be
so punctilious. Look at the ancients who used to “lend furs and horses and feel no
resentment when they came back the worse for wear”. And that was to mere
acquaintances: we two are members of the same family.’
‘I agree with you that one ought to share with one’s friends,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and not
only furs and horses, but even more precious things if one has them. But for a mere
male to arrogate to himself what properly belongs to you girls would be quite a
different matter. It would be better to alter “young man” and “maiden” and let it be
your elegy. After all, you were always very well-disposed towards Skybright. I’d rather
give the elegy to someone else than throw away your “rosy-misted casement”. Let’s
make it:
The mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted;
And the maid beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated.

I should be very happy to alter it in that way, even though it would mean that the
elegy would cease to have anything to do with me.’
‘She wasn’t my maid,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t make sense. Besides, “mistress” and
“maid” are such an unpoetical combination. I might want to use this version when
Nightingale is dead, but that won’t be for a long while yet, I imagine.’
‘Come now, it’s not very nice to talk about Nightingale dying,’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
‘You started it,’ said Dai-yu.
‘I know what,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ve got a still better solution. Why don’t we just say:

I by my rosy-misted casement seem most cruelly afflicted;
And you beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated?’

Dai-yu momentarily changed colour; yet though the words filled her with an almost
unbearable feeling of premonitory dread, she masked it with a smile and nodded
approvingly at his suggestion.
‘Yes, that’s a great improvement. Better not tamper with the words any more or
you will spoil them. You ought in any case to be getting back now. I’m sure you must
have more important things to attend to. When I saw your mother just now, she was
briefing someone to tell you that you are to go to your Aunt Xing’s place first thing
tomorrow morning. It seems that your Cousin Ying’s betrothal has been decided on. I
expect they want you there for the ceremony.’
‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bao-yu, a trifle pettishly. ‘I’ve not been feeling particularly
well lately. I may not be well enough to go there tomorrow.’
‘How typical!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I should try to grow out of these childish ways if I were
you. You are getting too old -’
She broke off in a fit of coughing. Bao-yu at once became concerned about her.
‘There’s a nasty wind here. I don’t know why we are standing around in the cold
like this. We’d better be getting back now. There’s no sense in making ourselves ill.’
‘I ought to be going back now in any case,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s time I went to bed.
We’ll see each other again tomorrow.’
She began to walk away. Bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction.
Suddenly it occurred to him that Dai-yu was unaccompanied and he told the little
maid to run after her and see her back to her apartment.
Back at Green Delights he found some old women with a message from his mother. It
was as Dai-yu had said. He was to go over first thing next morning to his Uncle She’s
house.

*

The family that Jia She was proposing to marry his daughter into was called Sun. They
were a Da-tong family whose menfolk had all, for several generations, been Army
officers. A former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the
Ning and Rong brothers, so their claim to a special relationship with the Jia family
was a strong One. Only one member of the family was at present living in the capital,
a young man called Sun Shao-zu who had been given the post of Military Provost in
the metropolitan garrison as an heredi?tary entitlement. He was a tall,
powerfully-built, impressive-looking young man; he drew a good bow, had a good
seat on a horse, and knew how to bear himself well in company and please those
whom it was important to please. Still under thirty and with his family’s not
inconsiderable wealth behind him, he had excellent prospects. Already the War
Department had marked him out for promotion. And he was unmarried. From every
point of view - the special relationship between their two houses, the Sun family’s
wealth, and the personality of the young man himself - Jia She regarded this as being
the almost perfect match and informed Grandmother Jia of his choice. Grandmother
Jia by no means shared his enthusiasm; however, after reflecting that the couplings
of young people are to a large extent fated and that, as Jia She was after all the girl’s
father, it was not really for her to interfere, she made some neutral response such as
‘I see’ or ‘Oh, are you?’ and left it at that.
Jia Zheng felt a much more positive antipathy to the match. He detested the Suns.
Though the connection between the two families was a long-standing one, it had
come about because Sun Shao-zu’s grandfather, who had been the worst possible
sort of social climber, had wormed his way into the patronage of Jia Zheng’s
grandfather and great-uncle for the sole purpose of concluding some dubious
business that he could not have brought off on his own. In Jia Zheng’s view they
lacked both education and breeding. He spoke to Jia She on two separate occasions
advising him very strongly against the match; but as Jia She refused to take the
slightest bit of notice, there was nothing much he could do.
Bao-yu had never met Sun Shao-zu before. Obliged to do so at his uncle’s place next
day and to make such small-talk as he was capable of, he was appalled, in the course
of conversation, to discover just how soon the marriage was to be: it seemed that
Ying-chun would be going to her husband’s house before the end of that year. When
some time later Lady Ying came over to tell Grandmother Jia that she now wanted to
move Ying-chun out of the Garden for good, he became even more depressed. That
strange apathy they had observed in him on previous occasions again came over him.
The news that Ying-chun would be taking four maids with her to the Sun household
provoked some stamping and groans and the remark that ‘five more decent people
were now lost to the world’; but it was only a momentary outburst.
He took to wandering about for hours on end in the neighbourhood of Amaryllis Eyot,
now shuttered and forlorn and with only one or two women of the night-watch on
duty in it. The very reeds and knotgrass along its banks and the caltrops and
pondweed in the water seemed to have taken on a wilting, dejected look, as if they
too were missing the presence of their former tenant. All the charm and colour
which had once endeared the spot to him seemed now to have abandoned it. So
strong was this feeling, that it eventually began forming itself into a poem, the words
of which came almost unbidden to his lips.

The pool’s pink-petalled lotus crowns have gone,
By one night’s nipping wind of autumn blown;
Like stricken mourners, knotgrass and caltrop-heads
Under the weight of frost and dew bow down;
And the board whose Go-stones clicked the long day through
With mud of sluttish swallows is blotched brown.
Old poets for parted friends made such a din:
What grief must mine be then for closest kin?

Just as he had finished reciting this poem, Bao-yu heard a laugh behind him.
‘What are you mooning about for this time?’
Bao-yu glanced back and saw that it was Caltrop. He turned to greet her.
‘My dear Caltrop! What brings you here today? You are becoming quite a stranger
in this Garden.’
Caltrop clapped her hands as if she found his question a great joke.
‘I am always longing to come here,’ she said, ‘but now that your Cousin Pan is home
again, I am no longer a free agent. Just now Mrs Xue was trying to get hold of Mrs
Lian and they told her that she was in the Garden. I asked for the job of going to look
for her simply as an excuse for coming here. I have just seen Mrs Lian’s maid and she
told me that her mistress is with Mrs Zhu in Sweet-rice Village. I’m on my way there
now. Tell me, how is Aroma these days? And how was it that Skybright died so
suddenly? What was wrong with her? And Miss Ying - she moved out very suddenly,
didn’t she? Just look at this place, it already looks deserted!’
Bao-yu did his best to answer her. He also invited her to accompany him back to
Green Delights and have some tea there.
‘I can’t at the moment,’ said Caltrop. ‘Wait till I’ve seen Mrs Lian and given her my
message and I’ll come and see you then.’
‘What’s this important message that you are in such a hurry to give her?’ said
Bao-yu.
‘It has to do with your Cousin Pan getting married.’
‘I see,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who did they finally settle on? They seemed to be wrangling
about it for months. It seemed to be Miss Zhang one day, Miss Li the next, and the
day after that Miss Wang. One wondered what the unfortunate girls had done to
deserve being considered for such a fate.’
‘Well you can forget about them now,’ said Caltrop, ‘because it’s all been settled.’
‘What family does the one they’ve chosen belong to?’ said Bao-yu.
‘A family that was related to our family by marriage once before,’ said Caltrop.
‘Your Cousin Pan called in on them last year during his travels. They are Imperial
Purveyors like us, registered with the Ministry of Finance, and one of the wealthiest
families in the capital. All your folk here seemed to have heard of them when we told
them. In fact everyone in the city, from Imperial Princes to shopkeepers, has heard of
the Cassia Xias.’
‘Oh,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why do they call them that?’
‘They are, as I say, very, very rich,’ said Caltrop, ‘and they own a great deal of land.
Several hundred acres of their land are devoted just to growing cassia alone. All the
cassia sold in shops in the city is supplied by them, and all the cassia, both cut
flowers and potted plants, on display in the Palace. That’s how they got the nickname.
Old Mr Xia that used to be head of the business is dead now. There’s only his widow
left and a young Miss Xia. No son. It’s sad to think that the family may die out.’


‘Spare your sorrow,’ Said Bao-yu. ‘What about this young lady? Why did Mr Xue
take a fancy to her?’
‘Partly I suppose it was because they were destined for each other and partly it was
a case of “beauty in the eye of the beholder”,’ said Caltrop smiling. ‘Years ago when
they were little and their two families were often visiting each other, your cousin and
Miss Xia used to play together and call each other’s parents “Auntie” and “Uncle”.
When your cousin went to call on them last year, Mrs Xia, having no son of her own
and seeing him now for the first time as a grown-up man, felt more as if she was
welcoming a long-lost son. She was quite overcome, laughing and crying by turns;
and of course she insisted that he and her daughter should see each other. Well it
seems that the daughter has grown into a great beauty, and is educated, too, having
been taught by a private tutor. Your cousin was quite bowled over. Mrs Xia even had
the older men from the shop who were travelling with your cousin to stay with her.
They must have spent three or four days in her house. She’d like to have kept them
even longer and they had quite a job persuading her that they needed to be getting
back. When they did get back, your cousin could speak of nothing else. Almost as
soon as he’d set foot in the door he was telling Mrs Xue that she must get him the
young lady for his wife. Mrs Xue was quite agreeable. She’d seen Miss Xia when she
was a little girl, and she knew the families were well-matched. So after talking it over
with Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian, she sent someone to see Mrs Xia about the
betrothal and it was settled almost immediately. The only snag is, they’ve fixed the
date for the wedding a bit on the early side, which means a terrible rush to get ready.
Still, I’m longing for her to be here. Think of it: another person to write poetry with!’
‘Hmn, maybe,’ said Bao-yu. ‘All the same, I am a bit worried for you.’
‘What do you mean?’ said Caltrop. ‘I’m afraid I don’t understand you.’
‘I should have thought it was obvious enough,’ said Bao- yu. ‘Isn’t there a fear that
if somebody else appears on the scene Cousin Pan will lose interest in you?’
Caltrop’s face reddened and she stared back at him coldly.
‘What sort of talk is that? I used to think that we respected each other, you and I.
Now I am beginning to understand what people mean when they say that you are
the kind of person with whom it is impossible to be friendly.’
She turned on her heel and walked away, giving him no chance to reply.
A sense of desolation came over Bao-yu. It was as if a part of him had been
irretrievably lost. For some minutes he stood vacantly staring after her, like an idiot.
Returning at last in great dejection to Green Delights, he shortly afterwards went to
bed. But he did not sleep well that night. Several times in the course of it he called
out Skybright’s name in his sleep or woke up in terror from some frightful dream. His
body next morning was feverish and he seemed to have lost all appetite for food and
drink.
The events of the past few weeks - the raid on the Garden, Chess’s dismissal,
Ying-chun’s departure, Skybright’s death and all the attendant humiliation, shock and
grief had been too much for him. They now combined with the effects of the chill he
had taken in his recent loiterings in the autumnal Garden to lay him on his back for
several weeks. Grandmother Jia came over daily to Green Delights to visit him and
Lady Wang began to regret that her concern about Skybright had caused her to deal
with him so harshly. However, she gave no outward indication of this change of heart
beyond renewing her orders to the womenservants to take special care of him. Twice
every day the doctor called to take his pulses and. supervise his dosing. It was a
whole month before he began to show signs of improvement, and even then the
doctor insisted that he would require a hundred days of convalescence before he
could return to a normal diet or be allowed to set foot outside his courtyard.
The restraints of this period of convalescence, during which all his amusements had
to be taken inside his own room, soon proved extremely irksome. By the time forty
or fifty of the hundred days had gone by, he was already fairly exploding with
impatience; but all his pleading and all the ruses he adopted to get the sentence
altered were in vain. Both Grand?mother Jia and Lady Wang were adamant. Resigned
at last to another fifty days of confinement, he concentrated his energies on thinking
up ever more ingenious and outrageous ways in which he and his maids could pass
the time.
News reached him in his confinement of the superb plays and banquets with which
Xue Pan celebrated the arrival of his new bride. Everyone said she was good-looking,
and not only that, but literate and able to write a tolerable hand. Bao?-yu would
have given anything to go over and meet her; but of course he could not.
Not long after that came news of Ying-chun’s wedding, and Bao-yu realized with a
pang that the affectionate, brother-and-sister-like relationship of their childhood
years was now at an end: from now on, even if they ever met, they would have to be
formal and distant with each other. It made him doubly despondent when he
reflected that he had not even been able to see her before she left. However, he
decided to keep his troubles to himself. For the time being he continued to
con?centrate on thinking up new ways of passing the time. At least there was one
good thing about his confinement: he no longer had Jia Zheng urging him and
threatening him about his studies. During those hundred days of convalescence he
and the maids all but took Green Delights apart. No form of diversion was too wild or
hare-brained for him to try, and things were done then that cannot have been
thought of before or since. We will not tax the reader’s credulity by attempting to
describe them.
*
After delivering her snub for what she mistakenly believed to be a deliberate
rudeness, Caltrop decided that in future it would be best to keep away from Bao-yu
as much as possible, even to the extent of avoiding visits to the Garden altogether.
This was not difficult, since she was at the time fully occupied with preparations for
Xue Pan’s wedding.
Caltrop had persuaded herself that when there was another woman in the house -
someone who would take a share of the responsibilities and whose authority she
herself could fall back on - life would be somehow easier for her than it was at
present. The young lady Xue Pan was marrying was said to be not only beautiful but
educated; it followed, in Caltrop’s reasoning, that she must be gentle and ladylike as
well. Caltrop awaited her arrival even more impatiently than Xue Pan, and resolved
to serve her, when she came, with all the devotion and care of which she was
capable.
The young lady of whom Caltrop entertained such high expectations was still only
seventeen. It is true that she was not at all bad-looking; she could even read quite a
number of words; and if subtle deviousness of character had been an examinable
qualification, she might have come out a good second to Xi-feng. Her chief drawback
sprang from the fact that she had lost her father at a very early age; and as her
widowed mother had no other child of her own and doted on her excessively, she
had been thoroughly spoiled. By treating her every whim as law and gainsaying her
nothing, her mother had turned her into a monster. In her own estimation Miss Xia
was a bodhisattva; all other creatures were as dust beneath her feet. The exterior she
presented to the world made one think of the flowers in spring; underneath it there
were light?nings and tornadoes. At home, in the bosom of the family, her maids
learned to gauge the severity of her tantrums: if she was only slightly vexed, she
would curse them; if she was gravely displeased, they would be beaten. As for her
views on matrimony: Miss Xia - or Xia Jin-gui to give her her full name - considered
that if she wanted to be mistress in her own house, it behoved her to put her
maidenly modesty and the gentleness that was habitual with her aside and show a
little authority. It would be necessary to keep the others in their place. Xue Pan in
particular, because of his wilfulness and intransigence, must be broken in as quickly
as possible, or she would never be able to establish her dominion and plant her flag
in this new territory. The discovery that there was a beautiful and intelligent young
concubine in this household she was entering aroused feelings in her akin to those
expressed by the founder of the Song dynasty when he likened the world to a
bedroom and declared that none but he should snore in it.
Because of her name ‘Jin-gui’, which means ‘cassia’ and the abundance of
cassia-trees cultivated by her family, Xia Jin-gui had always insisted on strict
avoidance of the syllables ‘jin’ and ‘gui’ and the word ‘cassia’ by her maids and any
other inferiors who had to do with her. Of course, cassia?flowers had from time to
time to be referred to somehow or other, so, bearing in mind the myth about the
cassia-tree that grows beside the palace of Chang E in the moon, she decreed that
cassia should always be referred to in her presence as ‘Chang E’s flower’. The notion
that in doing this she was in some way conferring on herself the status of a
moon-goddess was perhaps not entirely absent from her mind. At all events, the
luckless maid who carelessly let out a ‘jin’ or a ‘gui’ in her presence or who was
incautious enough to utter the dread word ‘cassia’ was in for a savage beating and
would probably lose her pay for a month or two as well.
Now Xue Pan was one of those fickle natures always ready to be ‘off with the old love
and on with the new’; and in spite of all his bluster, he was only pot-valiant, having
little stamina, or stomach either, for a long-drawn-out trial of strength. While the
novelty of his marriage still lasted, he was, in any case, only too willing to defer in
everything to his beautiful young bride. Jin-gui quickly grasped what sort of person
she had to deal with and exploited her advantage to the utmost. During the first
month of their marriage things stood about equally between them, but by the end of
the second month Jin-gui’s star was definitely in the ascendant.
One day, after drinking rather more than was good for him, Xue Pan went to see
Jin-gui about something he wanted them both to do. On meeting with determined
opposition to his proposal, he finally lost patience with her and, after some angry
shouting, walked out on her in a temper. Jin-gui wept abandonedly, refused to eat or
drink, and eventually succeeded in persuading everyone that she was ill. A doctor
was sum?moned who pronounced her to be suffering from a ‘collision of blood and
air’ and prescribed a lenitive medicine to ease the clogged passages of the breath.
Aunt Xue gave Xue Pan a furious dressing-down.
‘You’re a married man now and soon you’ll be a father. I don’t know how you can
carry on like this. Here’s a girl as rare as a phoenix chick, a beautiful, delicate creature,
reared up with I don’t know how much loving care by her family - they only let her
marry you because they thought you had enough human decency to look after her
properly - and what do you do? Instead of making an effort to control yourself and
settling down to live in peace and harmony with her as a husband ought to do, you
carry on just as you always did, drinking too much and treating the girl like a
barbarian. So now we have to spend money on expensive doctor’s bills and put up
with this quite unnecessary anxiety, all because of you.’
Xue Pan felt thoroughly remorseful after this lecture and went back to Jin-gui to try
and make it up with her. But Jin-gui had heard the lecture too and was encouraged by
it to behave even more outrageously than before. Xue Pan’s pacific overtures were
ignored. He had to humble himself still further. It took a fortnight of patient
wheedling to talk his wife into a more satisfactory frame of mind. By that time the
self?-assurance that had once been characteristic of him was very much in abeyance.
Having already, in this first encounter, caused her husband to lower his colours and at
the same time discovered that her mother-in-law was harmless, Jin-gui began
pressing forwards in quest of yet further victories. At first she would do no more than
consolidate her ascendancy over Xue Pan; then, using her feminine charms to make
him her instrument, she would extend her dominion over Aunt Xue; and finally
Bao-chai too should be brought under her control. But Bao-chai saw through her
sister-in-law’s little game very quickly and was able to meet ruse with ruse - even, by
means of an occasional quiet but well-placed remark, to give her ambitions some
check. Finding that she was not to be taken with cunning, Jin-gui began looking for
occasions for a direct confrontation with her; but as Bao-chai was equally careful not
to give her any, she was for the time being obliged, albeit reluctantly, to treat her
with respect.
One day, having nothing better to do, Jin-gui engaged Caltrop in conversation. When,
in answer to her questions, Caltrop told her that she had no recollection of her home
and parents, Jin-gui was displeased. She felt sure that Caltrop knew really but was
withholding the information out of malice.
‘Who gave you the name “Caltrop”?’ she asked her.
‘Miss Bao,’ said Caltrop.
Jin-gui sneered.
‘People are always saying how clever your Miss Bao is. I can’t see that she showed
much cleverness in choosing you that name.’
‘If you say that of Miss Bao,’ said Caltrop warmly, ‘it must be because you have
never had occasion to test her knowledge. Even Sir Zheng has often spoken
admiringly of Miss Bao’s learning.’
Jin-gui’s reaction to that remark will be related in the chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 80

Unfortunate Caltrop is battered by
a philandering husband
And One Plaster Wang prescribes for
an insufferable wife



Jin-gui reacted to Caltrop’s defence of Bao-chai’s intelli?gence with a toss of the head,
a scornful curl of the lip and a couple of loud, contemptuous sniffs.
‘ The flowers that girls are named after are supposed to be beautiful,
sweet-smelling ones. What is there beautiful or sweet-smelling about a
caltrop-flower? If you’re going to call caltrop-flowers sweet-smelling, then what are
you going to say of the flowers that are really fragrant? It’s a ridiculous choice for a
name.’
‘But caltrop-flowers are sweet-smelling,’ said Caltrop. ‘A lot of water-plants are.
Even lotus-leaves and lotus-pods have a certain fragrance - not to be compared with
the scent of flowers, perhaps; but in very still weather, especially very early in the
morning or very late at night, they have a delicious, cool fragrance that is in some
ways superior to that of flowers. Even caltrops themselves and cock’s heads and the
roots and leaves of reed-grass have a lovely fresh scent after dew or rain; it makes
you feel good just to smell it;’
‘To hear you speak,’ said Jin-gui, ‘anyone would think that orchid and cassia were
not particularly fragrant.’
Caltrop, warming to the argument, momentarily forgot Jin-gui’s taboo.
‘Ah now, orchid and cassia are quite different,’ she began; but before she could get
any further, Moonbeam was pointing a finger in her face and crowing over her in
malicious triumph:
     ‘You’ll catch it now! That’s the mistress’s name you’ve just said.’
     Caltrop was overcome with confusion and hurriedly apologized for her lapse.
     ‘I’m truly sorry, madam. It was a slip of the tongue. I hope you won’t hold it
against me.’
     Jin-gui smiled magnanimously.
     ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter. You don’t need to worry about that. About this name
of yours, though: I really don’t think that “Caltrop” is very appropriate. I should like
to change it, but I don’t know whether you would be willing to let me.’
     ‘Oh, madam, what a thing to say!’ said Caltrop, smiling. ‘I am your chattel, to do
with exactly as you wish; who am I to be willing or unwilling? If you wish to change
my name, my name already is whatever you wish to change it to!’
     Jin-gui smiled, somewhat unpleasantly.
     ‘You may say that, but I fear your Miss Bao may be rather less happy about it.
     ‘Ah no, madam. You see, when I was bought by the family, I used first to work for
Mrs Xue: that’s how Miss Bao came to give me my name, not because I was Miss
Bao’s own maid. Then after that I served the master. Miss Bao has nothing to do with
me - especially now you are here. In any case, she’s a very sensible young lady - not
at all the sort of person to make a fuss about a little thing like this.’
      ‘Very well,’ said Jin-gui: ‘in that case, since a water-lily is a much more
appropriate flower to name someone after than a caltrop, I think we ought to call
you “Lily”.’
      ‘Very good, madam, let that be my name then,’ said Caltrop, smiling.
      “Lily” she became then from that moment. Bao-chai, when she heard about it,
appeared totally unconcerned.
      Xue Pan was in some respects like the general of old in whom ‘conquest did but
breed appetite for further conquest’, for when, after his marriage to Jin-gui, he
discovered that she had an attractive, rather coquettish maid called Moon?beam, he
was continually calling to her to bring him things - cups of tea and the like - so as to
have an opportunity of flirting with her. Moonbeam perfectly well understood what
he was up to but had to behave circumspectly from fear of Jin-gui, whom she studied
carefully for some sign which would indicate how she wanted her to respond.
     Jin-gui had indeed noticed Xue Pan’s interest in her maid and reasoned within
herself as follows.
     ‘I’ve been wanting to deal with Caltrop, but so far haven’t found a way of getting
at her. Since he’s already taken a fancy to Moonbeam, I might just as well let him
have Moon?beam, because he’s sure to grow cooler towards Caltrop as a
consequence and I shall be able to take advantage of that in order to get rid of
Caltrop; and with Caltrop out of the way, settling Moonbeam’s hash ought to be easy,
because Moonbeam is my own servant.’
     Having decided on a strategy, she had only to await a suitable opportunity of
putting it into practice. Such an opportunity occurred one evening when Xue Pan,
having drunk himself into a state of cheerful inebriation, called as was his wont to
Moonbeam to bring him some tea. While Moonbeam was handing him the cup, he
deliberately gave her fingers a squeeze; Moonbeam, with a very unnatural
affectation of modesty, drew back her hand; and since neither of them had their
minds on what they were doing, the cup crashed to the floor, splashing hot tea over
Moonbeam’s skirt and everything else round about. Xue Pan tried to cover up his
embarrassment by pretending that Moonbeam had not handed him the cup properly,
while Moonbeam for her part said that the master had not ‘taken a proper hold’.
     Jin-gui hooted at them contemptuously.
     ‘You two really are a comedy! You must think I’m an idiot.’
     Xue Pan hung his head and laughed sheepishly and Moonbeam fled blushing
from the room when, not long after this, it was time to go to bed, Jin-gui tried to turn
Xue Pan out of the bedroom and make him sleep elsewhere. She said she was tired of
seeing him go around all the time looking as if he was wasting away with passion.
Xue Pan smiled foolishly and said nothing.
     ‘If you want to do something, why don’t you tell me?’ she said. ‘All this groping
in corners will get you nowhere.’
     Encouraged by her words and fortified by what he had drunk against any feeling
of shame, he knelt down on the bed-covers beside her and seized her hand.
     ‘Listen, lover,’ he said: ‘if you will let me have your Moonbeam, I’ll give you
anything you ask for - anything at all. If it’s human brains you want, I shall see that
you have them.’
     ‘What nonsense you talk!’ said Jin-gui. ‘What do I care who you go to bed with?
Just don’t make a fool of yourself by carrying on in front of the others, that’s all I ask.’
     Xue Pan was so pleased and grateful that it seemed he would never stop
thanking her. That night he performed his conjugal duties with exemplary
thoroughness. Every sinew was strained to give Jin-gui pleasure. He did not go out
next morning, but hung around at home, waiting for an opportunity of exploiting his
new-found licence.
      A little after midday Jin-gui rather pointedly went out in order to leave the coast
clear. Xue Pan lost no time in setting to work on Moonbeam, who, since she now had
a pretty good idea of her mistress’s intentions, put up only a token resistance to his
advances. Carnal congress seemed imminent. But Jin-gui had been waiting for this
moment only in order to frustrate it.
      Jin-gui had a maid called Orfie who had been with her in her mother’s house
since she was a child. Orfie had lost both her patents when she was little and had no
one else to look after her, so when she first entered service with the Xias, she was
invariably referred to as ‘the little orphan’. Her name ‘Orfie’ was simply a convenient
contraction of this. Orfie’s duties were normally of a rough and menial kind, but on
this occasion she was employed by her mistress on a task requiring some finesse.
      ‘Orfie,’ said Jin-gui, ‘do you think you could tell Lily to fetch my handkerchief
from my room and bring it to me? You needn’t let her know that it was I who sent
you.’
      Orfie went off to look for Caltrop.
      ‘Miss Lily,’ she said when she had found her, ‘the mistress has left her
handkerchief in her room. Why don’t you go and get it for her?’
      Caltrop had recently been puzzled by Jin-gui’s hostility, and, in her efforts to
overcome it, was constantly thinking of things that she could do to please her. Since
Orfie’s suggestion seemed to offer a means of winning favour, she sped off without a
second thought to do the errand, bursting into the room at the very moment when
Xue Pan and Moonbeam were in the interesting situation we have just described. She
turned back, blushing to the tips of her ears, but not in time to escape the notice of
the other two.
      Xue Pan himself was fairly unconcerned. Jin-gui was the only person he feared,
and as Jin-gui had given her consent, he cared nothing about what anyone else might
think. He had not even bothered to shut the door. But Moonbeam minded very much.
Being by nature a disputatious, somewhat self-righteous young woman, she found it
peculiarly galling that Caltrop of all people should have seen her at such a moment.
Pushing Xue Pan away from her, she ran out of the room, protesting, with cries of
angry complaint, that he had been attempting to rape her.
      The effect of this upon Xue Pan was that all the excitement generated by his
tussling with Moonbeam was transformed into animosity against Caltrop. He rushed
outside and spat at her.
     ‘Little harlot! What do you man by it, wandering around the place like a
damned disembodied ghost?’
     He might have done her an injury, but Caltrop, sensing that she was in mortal
danger, ran as fast as her legs would carry her and managed to get away. Abandoning
the chase, he went back to look for Moonbeam but could find no trace of her. This
increased his anger against Caltrop, whom he cursed once more in her absence. After
dinner that evening, when he had once again drunk himself merry, he decided to
take a bath. On testing the water with his foot and finding it to be too hot, he insisted
that Caltrop had done it deliberately, intending to harm him, ran after her, stark
naked as he was, and gave her a couple of kicks. Caltrop had long grown unused to
such savage treatment; but things had now reached such a pass that she dared not
complain and ran off to weep alone and nurse her injuries in silence.
     Meanwhile Jin-gui had secretly instructed Moonbeam to place herself at Xue
Pan’s disposal that very night in Caltrop’s bedroom. She ordered Caltrop to move in
with her, and when she refused, said she supposed that it was because she found her
room dirty or was too lazy to wait on her at night. She pretended to think that it was
Xue Pan who had inspired her refusal.
‘That master of yours is such a barbarian,’ she said. ‘He has only to look at a girl to
want her for himself. Now he’s taken my maid away, yet he won’t let me have you in
her place. What’s his idea, I wonder? Does he want to drive me to my death?’
Xue Pan, for whose ears this was, of course, intended, became apprehensive that the
difficulties Caltrop was making might once more prevent him from enjoying
Moonbeam, and he came rushing into Caltrop’s room to rebuke her.
‘Don’t you realize, this is an honour your mistress is doing you? You do as you’e told
and sleep with her, or I’ll give you a beating!’
Caltrop had now no choice but to roll up her bedding and carry it into Jin-gui’s room.
Jin-gui told her to make her bed up on the floor. This order too she had to obey. As
soon as she had settled down for the night, Jin-gui called to her for some tea. Caltrop
brought her the tea and lay down again. A little after that Jin-gui called to her to
come and massage her legs. And so it went on, seven or eight times in the course of
the night, so that it was impossible for Caltrop to get right off to sleep or even to rest
properly.
Now that Xue Pan had got Moonbeam, he was like a man who has come into
possession of a priceless jewel. He forsook all other interests for her. This secretly
enraged Jin-gui, who could not forbear some jealous mutterings when she was on
her own.
‘Enjoy yourself while you can, my friend,’ she would say. ‘I shall get round to you in
the end. And when I do, you had better not complain!’
For the time being, however, she refrained from outbursts and set about laying a trap
for Caltrop. About a fortnight after Caltrop moved into her room she suddenly
pretended to be ill. She complained of agonizing pains in the heart and appeared
unable to move her limbs. Nothing they did for her seemed to bring relief. The
servants said it must have been brought on by something Caltrop had done to upset
her.
A couple of days later, as one of the maids was shaking out Jin-gui’s pillow, a cut-out
paper mannikin fell out of it. It had the eight symbols of her nativity written on it and
five needles sticking into it, one in the heart and one in each of the limbs. This item
of news was thought sufficiently inter?esting to be reported to Aunt Xue, instantly
throwing that poor lady into a highly inflammable state of nervous com?motion. The
effect the news had upon Xue Pan was even more violent. He was for having all the
servants flogged immediately until one of them confessed to having planted the
paper figure; but Jin-gui prevented him.
‘Why make the innocent suffer?’ she said. ‘I expect it’s Moonbeam who did it, to
get me out of the way.’
‘That’s most unfair,’ said Xue Pan. ‘When, during this past week or two, has
Moonbeam had the time to go inside your room?’
‘Who else could it have been then?’ said Jin-gui. ‘I suppose you don’t think I’d do it
to myself? Moonbeam is the only one who’d dare go in my room.’
'But Lily’s been in here with you all the time,’ said Xue Pan. ‘She must know, if anyone
does. She’s the one to flog if we want to find out.’
‘What’s the good of flogging anyone?’ said Jin-gui. ‘They’ll never confess anything.
If you ask me, you’d much better pretend you haven’t heard about it and let the
matter drop. When all’s said and done, it doesn’t much matter if I die. You can always
find yourself a better wife when you feel like it. If we’re going to be honest, the fact
of the matter is, you all three hate me, don’t you ?’
She began crying bitterly. Xue Pan was so enraged that he snatched up a door-bar
and rushed off in search of Caltrop straight away. He began hitting her with it as soon
as he found her, on the head, on the face, on the body, shouting accusations at her
but giving her no chance to deny them. Aunt Xue came running out in answer to
Caltrop’s anguished cries and shouted to him to stop.
‘How can you beat the girl like that without first making an attempt to find out
what has happened? She’s given us years of faithful service: it’s unthinkable that
she’d do a thing like that. Time enough to start laying about you after you’ve made a
serious attempt to get to the bottom of it.’
When Jin-gui heard her mother-in-law saying this, she was afraid that Xue Pan might
weaken. Her crying rose in pitch into a sort of plaintive yell.
‘You have monopolized Moonbeam now for over a fortnight and refused to let
anyone but Lily sleep with me. You rush to Moonbeam’s defence when I say you
ought to flog her, and now you get in a temper and start beating Lily. I don’t know
why you don’t stop all this play-acting and get rid of me; then you will be free to pick
a really rich, good-looking girl to marry.’
Her words had the intended effect of further inflaming Xue Pan. Aunt Xue could see
that her son was being manipu?lated and was thoroughly disgusted by the
unscrupulous way in which Jin-gui maintained her hold on him. But what could she
do? She knew the weakness of her son’s character and realized that his subservience
to Jin-gui had already become a habit. Evidently he had seduced Jin-gui’s maid, that
much was clear; yet Jin-gui was one moment accusing him of forcibly ‘monopolizing’
the girl, while the next moment she seemed to claim credit for deferring like a good
wife to his wishes. And who could be responsible for the black magic? The proverb
says that even the wisest judge will hesi?tate to pronounce on household matters.
Adapting it to the present circumstances, it might be said that even a parent finds it
difficult to pronounce on the marital problems of his offspring. Aunt Xue, certainly,
felt quite helpless when con?fronted with those of her son. She could only shout at
him in exasperation.
‘Worthless creature！Even a dog would behave in a more seemly manner than you
do! Now, it seems, you have got your muddy paws onto your wife’s own maid that
she brought with her from her home. You’ve heard her yourself accusing you of
taking the girl away from her. How are you going to show your face anywhere when
other people get to hear about it? And this other business: Heaven only knows who
is responsible; yet here you go, lashing out at this poor child here before making the
slightest effort to find out what really happened. We all know what a fickle creature
you are, but really! What a return for the years of loyal service she has given you! I
don’t care how dissatisfied you are with her, you ought not to beat her. I’ll get a
dealer here right away and have her sold; that’s the only way to settle this. Then you
won’t be troubled by her any more. Come, girl!’ she said to caltrop, ‘get your things
together and come with me.’ She turned to the other servants. ‘Quickly now, go and
get the dealer! It doesn’t matter what we sell her for; just let’s get rid of this - this
thorn in the flesh, and perhaps we shall have a bit of peace again in this household!’
Xue Pan, seeing that his mother was really angry, stood with bowed head throughout
this tirade and made no attempt to reply. It was Jin-gui’s strident wail from inside the
window that answered her.
‘Whether you want to sell the girl or not, Mrs Xue, I think you might leave me out
of it. Are you implying that I’m such a vinegar-wife that I can’t tolerate an inferior?
And what do you mean, “thorn in the flesh”? Thorn in whose flesh? Even if I did hate
her so much, I wouldn’t let him have my own maid to replace her with.’
‘What sort of manners are these?’ Aunt Xue was trembling all over and her voice
was choking. ‘Since when did it become acceptable for a young woman to shout at
her mother?-in-law through the window? I was under the impression that you had
been brought up in an educated household. All this shouting and screaming - I can’t
make out what you are trying to say.’
Xue Pan stamped his foot and shouted at Jin-gui despair?ingly.
‘Oh stop, stop! You’ll have everyone laughing at us.’
Jin-gui, thinking, no doubt, that having gone so far she might as well go all the way,
only shouted the louder.
‘Why should I care if people laugh at us? Your darling chamber-wife has been trying
to do me in. Is this a time to start worrying about whether people are laughing at us
or not? Why don’t you keep her and sell me instead? Everyone knows how rich the
Xues are and how they make use of their money in order to trample on other people.
And everyone knows about their fine relations who will always step in and slap
anyone down for them who is giving them trouble. What are you waiting for? I don’t
know why you married me in the first place if you find me so unsatisfactory. I’m sure I
didn’t ask you to come running round to our house, begging and entreating my
mother to let you have me as your wife.’
     She rolled about on the bed, weeping and screaming and beating her bosom.
Xue Pan was beside himself. Whether he rebuked her, reasoned with her, beat her, or
begged her to be silent, it seemed unlikely that anything he did would have much
effect. He could only stump in and out of the room, sighing and groaning
inarticulately, and concluded by exclaim?ing, with great bitterness, that he was ‘a
very unlucky man’.
     Meanwhile Bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors. Aunt Xue
continued to insist that Caltrop must be sold. Bao-chai smilingly expostulated.
     ‘People like us don’t sell servants, Mamma, we only buy them. I think anger is
interfering with your judgement. What would people think if they heard that we
were planning to sell a servant? They would laugh us to scorn. If Pan and his wife are
dissatisfied with Caltrop, let her stay here and work for me. I could do with another
maid.’
     ‘If we keep her, it will seem to them like a provocation,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Much
better send her away and be done with it.
     ‘I can’t see that it makes any difference,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Provided she never goes
into the front part of the house, then as far as they are concerned, it will be just as if
she had been sold.’
     Caltrop was already at Aunt Xue’s feet begging to be allowed to stay and
protesting her willingness to serve Bao-chai as a maid. Aunt Xue was obliged to
relent.
     From now on Caltrop spent all her time with Bao-chai and stopped going into
the front part of the house altogether. She had at least security now; but for all that
she was not entirely happy. Sometimes on fine, clear nights she would gaze
wet-checked at the moon; at other times she might be heard unaccountably sighing
to herself while she trimmed a lamp.
The fact was that although she had lived with Xue Pan for several years, she had
never borne him a child. Some defect in the blood had made her unable to conceive.
And now she was ill too. The effect of all the emotional and physical outrage to which
she had recently been subjected was that a flood of fiery humour was released into
her liver, leading eventually to a drying up of the menstrual fluid. She became very
thin, yet had lost all interest in food. The doctor was called in and medicines were
prescribed, but they seemed to do her no good.
Meanwhile Jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband. Sometimes, when
drink had made him bold, Xue Pan would try to assert himself. Once or twice he went
for her with a cudgel or a knife; but Jin-gui only offered him her body to belabour, or
stretched her neck out and defied him to do his worst; and of course he could not; he
could only bluster. This soon became the established pattern of their quarrels. The
only result of it was that Jin-gui’s power over her husband grew all the stronger.
At this point Jin-gui began directing her attention on Moonbeam, picking on her and
finding fault with her. But Moonbeam was made of more inflammable stuff than
Caltrop. Up to now she and Xue Pan had got on together so swimmingly that she had
all but dismissed Jin-gui from her mind. Finding herself now under attack from that
quarter, she was unwilling to yield an inch and gave back as good as she got. When,
after a few slanging-matches, Jin-gui grew really angry and began not only to curse
her but to lay hands on her as well, she did not quite dare to return blow for blow,
but she put on a fine display of hysteria, shrieking, rolling about on the floor and
threshing about with her limbs. Thereafter she was constantly threatening suicide,
and at any hour of the day or night they might have to snatch knives or scissors from
her grasp or take down the noose which she had fastened for herself over a beam.
Between the two of them Xue Pan was driven half distracted. He could only look on
help?lessly while they quarrelled, until finally the rumpus got too much for him and
he would slip out of the house and take refuge elsewhere.
Sometimes in the intervals between quarrelling, if she was feeling cheerful, Jin-gui
would gather a few people together to play at dice or cards. She was inordinately
fond of gnawing bones, especially the bones of fowls. To satisfy this craving she had
ducks and chickens killed every day. The meat she gave to other people; it was only
the bones, crisp-fried in boiling fat, that she kept for herself, to nibble with her wine.
Sometimes, if the bone she was gnawing was giving her trouble and she grew
impatient, she would swear like a trooper.
‘That ponce and his poxy strumpet seem to enjoy themselves,’ she would say
self-pityingly. ‘Why can’t I get any enjoyment?’
Aunt Xue and Bao-chai no longer attempted to intervene. Now they could only sit in
their own room and weep in silence while they listened to the profanities next door.
Xue Pan was helpless. He bitterly regretted the brief madness which had led him to
chain himself to this demon wife. Soon everyone in the two mansions, both masters
and ser?vants, had heard about the Xues’ predicament and all felt sorry for them.
*
By this time Bao-yu’s hundred days of convalescence had ended and he was allowed
to go out. One of the first things he did was to call on Jin-gui. There was nothing
exceptionable in her behaviour or appearance on the occasion when he saw her: she
seemed to be just the same sort of delicate, flowerlike creature as all the other girls.
How did so beautiful a person come to have so appalling a character? It was a
mystery which continued to occupy him for some time after the visit.
When, a few days later, he called in to wish his mother good morning, his visit
happened to coincide with that of Ying-chun’s nurse. She brought distressing news
about Sun Shao-zu’s behaviour.
‘Whenever she is on her own, the young mistress does nothing but cry,’ said the
woman. ‘She’s longing for you to send for her so that she can enjoy a day or two of
freedom.’
‘I’ve been meaning for some days to send for her,’ said Lady Wang, ‘but so many
disagreeable things have been happening lately that I keep forgetting. Bao-yu spoke
to me about this when he got back from his visit the other day. Tomorrow is a good
day, according to the calendar. We will send for her tomorrow.’
     Just then a servant arrived from Grandmother Jia’s with a message for Bao-yu.
He was to go first thing next morning to the Tian Qi Temple to burn incense in
payment of a vow she had made for his recovery. Eager for outings after his long
confinement, he was hardly able to sleep that night for excitement.
Next day he rose at dawn, and as soon as he had washed and dressed, set off by
carriage, accompanied by two or three old nannies, and drove through the West Gate
of the city to the Tian Qi Temple outside the walls.
The Taoists of the temple had spent the previous day preparing the place for his
arrival. Because of his nervous disposition he did not care to get too close to the
hideous guardian deities and other horror-inspiring images for which this temple was
famous. As soon as he had presented the paper figures, spirit money, food and so
forth which constituted the offering, he withdrew to the residential part of the
temple and, alter taking lunch there, set off on a sight-seeing tour of the temple and
its precincts, accompanied by the old nannies and by Li Gui and the other grooms.
But the sight-seeing soon fatigued him and he withdrew to the monks’ quarters again
for a rest. The old nannies considered that it would be bad for him to sleep so soon
after eating and called in the Taoist priest-in-charge, Father Wang, to sit and talk with
him.
This Father Wang had knocked about the world in his time as an itinerant vendor of
panaceas and even now had his name-plate hung up outside the temple with an
impressive list of the pills, powders, plasters and potions that he was prepared, for a
consideration, to dispense. He was a frequent visitor at the Ning and Rong mansions
and was known to everyone there - as to everyone else outside - as ‘One Plaster
Wang’ from his habit of always concluding the patter with which he recommended
his medicaments with the same formula: ‘One plaster will suffice, ladies and
gentlemen; one single plaster will suffice.’
When One Plaster Wang arrived, Bao-yu was reclining on the kang looking
half-asleep and Li Gui and the others were doing their best to keep him awake.
‘Ah, Father Wang!’ they said as he entered. ‘You’ve come just in time. Everyone’s
always saying how good you are at telling funny stories. Won’t you tell one now for
our young master?’
‘I think I had better,’ said One Plaster Wang, smiling. ‘We don’t want him sleeping
after his lunch. The batter he’s lust eaten might start battering his insides.’
This was not a bad beginning. At least it made them all laugh. Bao-yu, laughing with
the others, got up and straightened out his clothes. One Plaster Wang ordered one of
his acolytes to ‘make some good, strong tea’.
‘Master Bao doesn’t want any of your tea,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Your room stinks of
medicine.’
‘O fie!’ said One Plaster Wang in comic outrage. ‘O monstrous imputation! Never
has medicine of any kind found its way into this room. Moreover, for the past three
or four days, ever since I heard your master was coming here, I have been burning
incense to sweeten it.’
‘I’m always hearing about your plasters,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tell me, what sort of things
are they good for?’
‘ My plasters?’ said the old Taoist. ‘Ah, now you’ve started something! It’s
impossible to do them justice in a few words. To begin with, there are one hundred
and twenty different ingredients in the ointment I use on them. Some of them
domi?nate over the others like a prince over his subjects, some of them combine
with each other in equal strength; some generate heat, some coolness; some of
them are cheap and some expensive. Internally they stabilize and fortify the humours,
enrich the blood, stimulate the appetite, tranquillize the spirits, banish excessive heat
and cold, aid digestion and loosen phlegm; externally they regularize the pulses, relax
the muscles, draw out the old, corrupt flesh, promote new growth, expel rheums and
neutralize poisons. Their efficacy is miraculous, as you yourself may see if you ever
have occasion to use one.’
‘I can hardly believe that a single plaster can do so many things,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I
wonder if the trouble I am thinking of could be cured by one.’
‘My plasters will cure any illness you like to mention,’ said the old Taoist. ‘If they
don’t give you instant relief, you are at liberty to pluck me by the beard, slap my old
face, and pull my temple down! What is the illness you have in mind?’
‘Try and guess,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you can guess right, I shall believe in the efficacy of
your plasters.’
One Plaster Wang thought for a bit.
‘Hmn, difficult.’ He smiled slily. ‘Of course, there are some things that it’s not very
convenient to use plasters for.’
Bao-yu told all the servants but Tealeaf to go out of the room.
‘This room is too small for so many people,’ he said. ‘The air in it is becoming foul.’
Tealeaf lit a stick of Sweet Dreams incense and Bao-yu made him sit close to him,
with the lighted incense in his hand, so that he could lean on him for support.
Watching this little pantomime, the cunning old Taoist had a sudden inspiration. His
face broke into a broad grin. Coming up closer to Bao-yu, he bent down and spoke
softly into his ear.
‘I think I’ve guessed. Could it be that you have started bedchamber exercises
already and are looking for a little something to help things along?’
Almost before he had finished, Tealeaf was shouting at him indignantly.
‘Get away with you! Dirty old man!’
Bao-yu had not understood.
‘What’s that?’ he asked Tealeaf, puzzled. ‘What did he say?’
‘Never mind what he said,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Silly rubbish!’
‘You’d better tell me yourself what it is, Master Bao,’ said One Plaster Wang,
unwilling to risk another guess.
‘The thing I want to know about is jealousy,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Could one of your
plasters cure a woman of being jealous?’
One Plaster Wang clapped his hands and laughed.
‘Now there you have me! Neither my plasters nor anyone else’s could do that!’
‘They are not such great shakes after all then,’ said Bao-yu, smiling.
‘I said plasters couldn’t,’ said One Plaster Wang. ‘I know of an infusion that might.
The only thing is, it would take rather a long time. There’s no lightning cure for
jealousy.’
‘What is this infusion called?’ said Bao-yu. ‘How do you make it?’
‘It’s called Pirum saccharinum,’ said One Plaster Wang. ‘You take one very good
autumn pear, two drams of crystal sugar, one dram of bitter-peel and three cups of
water and simmer them all together until the pear is soft. If the suf?ferer can be
made to eat one such pear, together with its juices, first thing every morning, she will,
eventually, be cured.’
‘I don’t think much of that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t see that working.’
‘If it doesn’t work the first time, perhaps it will by the tenth,’ said the old Taoist. ‘If
one year’s treatment is insufficient, she must persevere for a second. And so on. At
all events, these are wholesome ingredients. A pear prepared in this way is soothing
to the lungs and stomach, innocuous to the health, sweet to the palate, lenitive for a
cough and in every way agreeable. Sooner or later the woman will die; and as there
is no jealousy (that I know of) after death, it could be said that by that time she had
been cured.’
This set Bao-yu and Tealeaf off into fits of laughter. ‘Oily-tongued old ox’ they called
him.
‘Well, what’s the harm?’ said One Plaster Wang. ‘It’s only a bit of nonsense to stop
you sleeping in the middle of the day. Making you laugh is worth much more than
any medicine. Even my plasters are only tomfoolery. Do you think if I really had a
magic formula I’d be sitting here talking to you now? I’d have taken it myself long ago
and gone off to join the immortals.’
The hour of sacrifice had now arrived and Bao-yu was invited to offer his libation and
set fire to his paper hecatomb. What remained of the more substantial part of the
offering -the foodstuffs and the wine - was shared out among the Taoists and the
others present. Having completed what he came out for, he drove back into the city.
By the time he got home Ying-chun had already been back an hour or more. The
servants who brought her were being entertained to dinner before returning to the
Sun household. Ying-chun meanwhile was in Lady Wang’s room giving her and the
cousins a tearful account of her matrimonial troubles.
‘Sun Shao-zu is an out-and-out libertine. Gambling, drinking and chasing after
women are the only things he cares about. He has corrupted practically every maid
and young woman in the house. I have protested to him about it more than once, but
he only swears at me. He calls me a “jealous little whore”. He says that Father
borrowed five thousand taels from him and spent it all, and that though he has been
round time and again to ask for it, Father re?fuses to pay it back. Then he points his
finger at me and shouts: “Don’t put on the lady wife act with me, my girl! You’re no
better than a bought slave - payment in kind for the five thousand taels your old man
owes me - and if you’re not very careful I shall give you a good beating and send you
to sleep with the maids.” He says it was Great-grandfather who took the Initiative in
making the alliance between our families because theirs was so rich and influential,
so that by rights he ought to be Father’s equal. He says he was a fool to marry me,
because that makes Father his senior; and besides, he says, it has given people the
impression that he needed our help, whereas in fact quite the reverse is true.’
Ying-chun sobbed bittely while she told them this and the others wept as they
listened. Lady Wang did her best to comfort her.
‘He’s obviously an unreasonable man,’ she said; ‘but now that you’re married to
him, there’s really nothing to be done. I remember your Uncle Zheng speaking very
strongly against the marriage to your father, but your father was so set on it, he
wouldn’t listen. It’s a bad business. My poor child! I’m afraid it must be your fate.’
Ying-chun wept.
‘I can’t believe that it was my fate to be so unhappy. After losing my mother as a
tiny child, it seemed such bliss when you brought me here to live with Cousin Wan
and the girls. And now, after just a few years of blessedness, I am to end like this!’
Lady Wang tried once more to comfort her. She suggested that Ying-chun herself
should decide where she wished to sleep.
‘Since the very first moment I left I have been longing every minute of the day and
night to be back here with the girls,’ said Ying-chun. ‘And next to them I have missed
my beloved Amaryllis Eyot. If only I might spend another four or five days in the
Garden, I think I could die content. Who knows if I shall ever be allowed to come and
stay here again?’
‘Now, now, that’s a foolish way to talk!’ said Lady Wang. ‘A little jangling between
newly married couples is the commonest thing in the world. There is no cause at all
to be so tragic about it.’
She gave orders for the rooms on Amaryllis Eyot to be made ready as quickly as
possible, and told the cousins to keep Ying-chun company and do their best to
distract her from her troubles. She particularly impressed upon Bao-yu that no word
of this was to reach the ears of Grandmother Jia.
‘If I find that Grandmother has got to hear of this,’ she warned him, ‘I shall hold you
alone responsible.’
Bao-yu had to promise that he would say nothing.
That evening saw Ying-chun installed once more in her old apartment, with everyone
round her, cousins and ser?vants alike, doing their utmost to make her feel cherished.
Three days she spent in her old apartment in the Garden; after that she had to go
and stay with Lady Xing. Before doing so she called on Grandmother Jia and Lady
Wang to say good-bye. Her leave-taking with the cousins which followed was
extremely painful. It was all that Aunt Xue and Lady Wang could do to calm the young
people in their grief.
Ying-chun stayed two days with Lady Xing and it was to Lady Xing’s place that the Sun
family servants came to collect her. Needless to say, she felt little inclined to go with
them; but fear of her husband’s evil temper made her conceal her reluctance and
hurry over her leave-taking. Lady Xing had never been much interested in her
daughter’s welfare - during the two days that Ying-chun was with her she never once
inquired whether her relations with her husband were harmonious and the duties
required of her in her new house?hold not too onerous - and such expressions of
maternal sentiment as she may have indulged in at her departure were of only the
most perfunctory and superficial kind.
As to what followed her departure: to know that, dear reader, you will have to look
into another volume.
