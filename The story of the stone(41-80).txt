CHAPTER 41

Jia Bao-yu tastes some superior tea at Green Bower Hermitage
And Grannie Liu samples the sleeping accommodation at
Green Delights



‘THIS flower will to a pumpkin grow.’
As Grannie Liu of the flower-studded hair said this, gestur?ing with her hands to
suggest the size of the full-grown pump-kin, a shout of laughter rose from all those
present.
She drank the ‘pass’ cup.
‘To be truthful,’ she said, aiming for another laugh, ‘I’m but a clumsy body at the
best of times, and having drunk so much, I’m scared of breaking this pretty cup
you’ve given me. You should have given me a wooden one; then if I dropped it, it
wouldn’t matter.’
The others laughed; but Xi-feng pretended to take her seriously:
‘If you really want a wooden cup to drink out of, I can find you one. But I’d better
warn you. The wooden ones aren’t like these porcelain ones; they come in sets of
different sizes, and if we get them out for you, you’ll have to drink out of every one in
the set.’
Grannie Liu calculated.
‘I was only joking,’ she thought. ‘I didn’t think they’d really have any. When I’ve
dined with the gentry back home, I’ve seen many a gold and silver cup in their
houses, but never a wooden one. I expect these will be wooden bowls that the
children use. It’s a trick to make me drink a lot. Well, never mind. This stuff’s not
much more than sugared water anyway. It can do me no harm if I drink a bit extra.’
Having so reflected, she made reply
‘Very well. Let’s see them first though.’
‘Go to the inner room of the front apartment,’ Xi-feng told Felicity, ‘and fetch me
that set of ten winecups on the bookcase—the ones carved Out of bamboo root.’
          But before Felicity could go on her errand, Faithful made a
counter-proposal:
‘I know that set of yours they’re not very big cups, and in any case, you promised
her wooden ones and yours are only made of bamboo. Much better give her ten
boxwood ones and make her drink out of Them.’
‘All right,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Better still.’ So Faithful sent someone to fetch them.
The sight of these cups when they arrived both alarmed and delighted Grannie Liu.
What alarmed her was their size. The largest was as big as a small hand-basin and
even the smallest one was twice as big as the cup she held in her hand. What
de?lighted her was the consummate artistry of the carving. On each of the ten cups,
in smaller and smaller replicas, was the same landscape with little trees and human
figures in it and even some lines of minute ‘grass character’ writing and a tiny carved
representation of an artist’s seal.
‘I’ll take the smallest one,’ she said hurriedly.
‘Oh no!’ said Xi-feng, smiling. ‘These cups have never been used before, because
up to now we’ve never found any?one with a big enough capacity to drink from them.
Now that you’ve asked for them and we’ve been to the trouble of get?ting them out
for you, we must insist on your drinking from every one of them.’
‘I couldn’t,’ said Grannie Lin in a panic. ‘Please, Mrs Lian, don’t make me!’
Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue and Lady Wang all realized that a person of Grannie Liu’s
advanced years could not possibly be expected to imbibe so huge a quantity of liquor
with?out the direst consequences, and laughingly pleaded for her.
‘Come now, a joke is a joke. You mustn’t make her drink too much. Let her just
drink from the largest one.’
‘Holy Name!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Can’t I just drink from the smallest one, like I said? I
can take the largest one home with me and drink it up by degrees.’
The others laughed. Faithful, obliged to relent, ordered one of the larger, but not the
largest cup to be filled, and Grannie Liu, holding it in both her hands, began to drink.
‘Drink it slowly, now,’ Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue counselled her. ‘Don’t make
yourself choke.’
Aunt Xue told Xi-feng to offer the old woman something to eat with her bowlful.
‘What would you like, Grannie?’ said Xi-feng. Just name it and I’ll feed you some.’
‘I don’t know the names of any of these dishes,’ said Gran?nie Lin. ‘Anything you
like. They all taste good to me.’
‘Give her some of the dried aubergine,’ said Grandmother Jia.
Xi-feng collected some between her chopsticks and held it up to Grannie Liu’s mouth.
‘There. I expect at home you eat aubergines every day. Try some of ours and see
what you think of it.’
‘You’re having me on,’ said Grannie Liu, when she had eaten the proffered mouthful.
‘No aubergine ever had a flavour like that. If it did, we’d give up growing other crops
and grow nothing but aubergines!’
‘It really is aubergine,’ the others laughingly assured her. ‘This time we’re not
having you on.’
‘Really?’ said Grannie Liu in some surprise. ‘Well, I couldn’t have had my mind on it
properly while I was eating it. Give me a bit more, Mrs Lian, and this time I’ll chew it
more carefully.’
Xi-feng took up some more from the dish in her chopsticks and popped it into
Grannie Liu’s mouth. After prolonged, reflective mastication Grannie Liu agreed that
there was indeed a slight hint of aubergine in the flavour.
‘But I still say this isn’t really like aubergine,’ she said. ‘Tell me the recipe, so that I
can make it for myself.’
‘It’s simple,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You pick the aubergines in the fourth or fifth month when
they’re just ripe, skin them, re?move the pulp and pips and cut into thread-fine strips
which you dry in the sun. Then you take the stock from one whole fat boiling-fowl,
put the dried aubergine-strips into a steamer and steam them over the chicken stock
until it’s nearly all boiled away. Then you take them out and dry them in the sun
again. You do that, steaming and drying, steaming and drying by turns, altogether
nine times. And it has to be dried until it’s quite brittle. Then you store in a
tightly-sealed jar, and when you want to eat some, you take out about a saucerful
and mix it with fried slivers of chicken leg-meat before serving.’
Xi-feng’s ‘simple recipe’ caused Grannie Liu to stick her tongue out and shake her
head in wonderment.
‘Lord Buddha!’ she exclaimed. ‘That’s ten chicken gone into the making of it. No
wonder it tastes so good!’
And having laughed a while over the recipe, she applied herself once more to the
wine and slowly drank it down. She continued to toy with the cup after she had
finished drinking, as though loth to put it down.
‘I do believe you haven’t had enough,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Have another cupful.’
‘Gracious goodness, that would be the death of me!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘No, I was
just admiring the carving on it. Beautiful. How could they do it so fine?’
‘Now that you’ve finished drinking from it,’ said Faithful, ‘why not tell us what
wood it’s made of?’
‘Ah now, that question doesn’t surprise me,’ said Grannie Liu. You young ladies
living in the lap of luxury wouldn’t know much about wood; but people like us that
live all our lives with the woods for neighbours, that lie on wood when we re tired
and sit on it when we’re weary and even have to eat it sometimes in years of famine:
seeing it and hearing it and talking about it every day of our lives, we naturally get to
know its different qualities and can tell the genuine from the imitation. Well now, let
me see.’
She turned the cup round a good while in her hands and contemplated it with great
attention before pronouncing:
‘A household like yours wouldn’t have anything cheap in it,’ she said, ‘so anything
wooden you’ve got would be made from a wood that’s not very easy to come by. And
this is a heavy wood, so it’s definitely not willow. I should say, with?out much doubt,
this is red pine.’
The loud laughter which greeted this pronouncement was interrupted by the arrival
of an old woman who reported to Grandmother Jia that the young actresses were in
the Lotus Pavilion awaiting instructions. Were they to perform now, or should they
go on waiting a little longer?
‘Bless me! I had completely forgotten about them,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Yes, tell
them to begin straight away.’
The old woman departed, and presently, in the cold, clear air of autumn, the
ululation of flutes rising above a drone of pipes and organs came stealing through the
trees and across the water, ravishing the hearts and minds of those who heard it.
Bao-yu, the first to be affected, seized his wine-kettle, poured himself a cupful of
wine, and drained it in a single gulp. He then poured himself a second cup; but just as
he was about to drink it, he noticed that his mother had evidently been affected in
the same way, for she was just at that moment giving orders to a servant to fetch her
a supply of freshly-heated wine. At once he crossed over to where she was sitting and
held his cup to her mouth for her to drink from.
Soon the newly-heated wine arrived and Bao-yu went back to his seat. Lady Wang
rose from hers and picked up the wine-kettle that had just been brought, intending
to pour some for Grandmother Jia. This was a signal for the others present, including
Aunt Xue, to rise from their seats as well; but Grandmother Jia hurriedly gave orders
for Li Wan and Xi-feng to take over.
‘Let your Aunt sit down, so that the others can be at their ease,’ she said to Xi-feng,
whereupon Lady Wang relinquished the wine-kettle and went back to her seat.
‘We’re having such fun today,’ said Grandmother Jia when Xi-feng had poured for
her. ‘All of you must drink!’
She raised her cup to Aunt Xue, then, reaching beyond her, to Xiang-yun and
Bao-chai.
‘Come on, you two! You must have a cup too. And your Cousin Lin - we’re not
letting her off. I know she can’t drink very much, but today is an exception.’
She drained her cup, and Xiang-yun, Bao-chai and Dai-yu drank something from
theirs.
Grannie Liu, meanwhile, who had seldom before heard such fine music and was
more than a little drunk, was showing bet appreciation of it with vigorous
movements of hands and feet. Bao-yu, catching sight of her, slipped from his seat to
whisper in Dai-yu’s ear.
‘Look at the old grannie!’
‘It reminds me of the passage in the History Classic about the animals dancing to
the music of Shun,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Only in this case it’s just one old cow!’
The other girls, overhearing this, all laughed.
After a little while the music stopped and Aunt Xue sugges?ted that as everyone
appeared to have had about as much to drink as was good for them, perhaps it
would be a good idea to break up and walk around for a bit. At this Grandmother Jia,
who was herself beginning to feel like some exercise, rose to her feet. The others
rose too and followed her outside.
Anxious to keep Grannie Liu with her as a source of diver?sion, Grandmother Jia took
her by the hand to walk with her among the trees at the foot of the rockery. She
spent a goodish while circumambulating this area with her, explaining what the
various trees, rocks and flowers were called. Grannie Liu listened very attentively.
‘Seems that in the city it isn’t only the folks that are gran?der,’ she remarked. ‘The
creatures too seem to be grander than what they are outside. Even the birds here are
prettier, and they can talk.’
‘What birds?’ they asked her, curious.
‘I know the one on the golden perch on the verandah—him with the green feathers
and red beak is—a polly parrot,’ she said defensively, ‘but that old black crow in the
cage he’s grown a thingummy on his head and learned to talk, as well.’
The ‘crow’ that she was referring to was a mynah. The others laughed at her mistake.
A little after this some maids came up and invited them to take a snack.
‘After drinking all that wine, I don’t feel hungry,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Still, bring it
here anyway, and those who want to can help themselves.’
The maids went off and returned carrying two small tables. A couple of food-boxes
followed. Each, when its cover was removed, was found to contain two different
kinds of delicacy. In the first box there were two kinds of steamed things: marzipan
cakes made of ground lotus-root and sugared cassia?-flowers, and pine-nut and
goose-fat rolls, The second box contained two sorts of fried things, one of them a
heap of tiny jiao-zi only about one inch long
‘What have they got inside them?’ Grandmother Jia asked.
‘Crab-meat, said one of the old women who had brought the boxes.
Grandmother Jia frowned.
‘I shouldn’t think anyone would feel like eating that now,’ she said. ‘Much too rich.’
The other type of fried confection consisted of a wide variety of little pastry-shapes
deep-fried in butter. These, too, met with the old lady’s disapproval. She invited Aunt
Xue to choose first. Aunt Xue selected one of the little cakes of lotus-root marzipan.
Grandmother Jia chose a goose-fat and pine-nut roll, but after merely tasting it,
handed the uneaten half to a maid.
Grannie Liu was fascinated by the delicately fashioned pas?tries. They had been
looped or perforated or criss-crossed in every conceivable shape and the soft dough
instantaneously hardened in boiling butter-fat. The one she had selected was shaped
like a peony.
‘The cleverest girl in our village couldn’t make a paper cut?out as fine as that,’ she
said, holding it up for the others to see. ‘It seems almost a shame to eat it. I’d like to
wrap up a few of these and take them home with me to use as patterns!’
The others laughed.
‘I’ll give you a jarful to take back with you when you go,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Eat
these ones now, while they’re still hot.’
The others contented themselves with nibbling only one or two of whichever
delicacies in the boxes took their fancy, but Grannie Liu and Ban-er, partly because of
the novelty (neither of them having eaten such things before), and partly because
the little pastry-shapes really were very pretty and, being heaped promiscuously
together, tempted you to go on eating them to discover what new shapes were lying
underneath, went on munching away until they had tried several of every shape, by
which time about half the pile had vanished. Xi-feng had what was left on the four
dishes heaped together onto two of them and put into a single box, and sent it over
to the Lotus Pavilion for élégante and the eleven other little actresses to eat.
Just then the nurse appeared carrying Xi-feng’s little girl, who at once became the
main focus of their attention. She was clutching a large grapefruit, but as soon as she
caught sight of the Buddha’s hand that Ban-er was holding, she decided that she
wanted that, and let up a wail when the maids who were attempting to coax it from
Ban-er could not procure it for her quickly enough. A resourceful cousin saved the
situation by hurriedly taking the grapefruit and inducing Ban-?er to make an
exchange. Ban-er had by this time been playing with the Buddha’s hand for quite a
long while and had more or less exhausted its possibilities; moreover at the moment
he had his hands full of fried pastry-shapes; and the grapefruit not only smelled good
but, being round, made an excellent football. For these three reasons he concluded
that it was an altogether more satisfactory fruit than the Buddha’s hand and
abandoned all interest in the latter.

*

When everyone had taken tea, Grandmother Jia, with the rest of the party following,
conducted Grannie Lin to Green Bower Hermitage, where they were met at the gate
by the nun Adamantina. Inside the courtyard the trees and shrubs had a thriving,
well-cared-for look.
‘Monks and nuns always have the best-kept gardens,’ said Grandmother Jia, in
smiling approval of what she saw. ‘They have nothing else to do with their time.’
They were walking towards the meditation hall on the east side of the courtyard. As
they seemed to hesitate in the outer foyer, Adamantina invited them to go on inside,
but Grand?mother Jia declined.
‘No, we won’t go inside just now. We’ve all recently taken wine and meat, and as
you’ve got the Bodhisattva in there, it would be sacrilege. We can sit out here, where
we are. Bring us some of your nice tea. We’ll just drink one cup and then go out
again.’
Adamantina hurried off to make tea.
Having heard a good deal about her, Bao-yu studied her very attentively, when she
arrived back presently with the tray. It was a little cinque-lobed lacquer tea-tray
decorated with a gold-infilled engraving of a cloud dragon coiled round the character
for ‘longevity’. On it stood a little covered tea?cup of Cheng Hua enamelled
porcelain. Holding the tray out respectfully in both her hands, she offered the cup to
Grand?mother Jia.
‘I don’t drink Lu-an tea,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘I know you don’t,’ said Adainantina with a smile. ‘This is Old Man’s Eyebrows.’
Grandmother Jia took the tea and inquired what sort of water it had been made
with.
‘Last year’s rain-water,’ said Adamantina.
After drinking half’ Grandmother Jia handed the cup to Grannie Liu.
‘Try it,’ she said. ‘See what you think of it.’
Grannie Liu gulped down the remaining half.
‘Hmn. All right. A bit on the weak side, though. It would be better if it were brewed
a little longer.’
Grandmother Jia and the rest seemed to derive much amuse?ment from these
comments.
The others were now served tea in covered cups of ‘sweet-white’ eggshell china—all,
that is, except Bao-chai and Dai-yu, whom Adamantina tugged by the sleeve as an
indication that they should follow her inside. Bao-yu stealthily slipped out after them
and saw Adamantina usher them into a side-room leading off the foyer. This was
Adamantina’s own room. Inside it Bao-chai seated herself on the couch and Dai-yu
sat on Adamantina’s meditation mat. Adamantina busied herself at the stove, fanning
the charcoal until the water was boiling vigorously and brewing them a fresh pot of
tea. Bao-yu stepped softly into the room and made his presence known to the two
cousins.
‘So you get the hostess’s special brew?’
‘Yes,’ they said laughing. ‘And it’s no good your gate-crashing in here after us,
because there’s none for you.’
Just as Adamantina was about to fetch cups for the girls, an old lay-sister appeared at
the door carrying the empties she had been collecting in the foyer.
‘Don’t bring that Cheng Hua cup in here,’ said Adamantina. ‘Leave it outside.’
Bao-yu understood immediately. It was because Grannie Liu had drunk from it. In
Adamantina’s eyes the cup was now contaminated. He watched her as she got cups
out for the girls. One of them, a cup with a handle, had
THE PUMPKIN CUP

carved in li-shu characters on one side and

             Wang Kai his Treasure

in little autograph characters. on the back, followed by another column of tiny
characters:

             Examined by Su Dong-po in the Inner Treasury
             Fourth month Yuan-feng era anno 50

When she had poured tea into this cup she handed it to Bao-chai.
The other cup was shaped like a miniature begging-bowl and was inscribed with the
words

THE HORN LINK GOBLET

in ‘pearl-drop’ seal script. Adamantina filled it and handed it to Dai-yu.
She poured tea for Bao-yu in the green jade mug that she normally drank from
herself, Bao-yu commented jokingly on the choice:
‘I thought you religious were supposed to treat all earthly creatures alike. How
comes it that the other two get priceless heirlooms to drink out of but I only get a
common old thing like this?’
‘I have no wish to boast,’ said Adamantina, ‘but this “com?mon old thing” as you
call it may well be more valuable than anything you could find in your own
household.’
‘In the world’s eyes, yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But “other coun?tries, other ways”, you
know. When I enter your domain, I naturally adopt your standards and look on gold,
jewels and jade as common, vulgar things.’
Adamantina glowed with pleasure. In place of the jade mug she hunted out a large
drinking-bowl for him to drink out of. It was carved from a gnarled and ancient
bamboo root in the likeness of a coiled-up dragon with horns like antlers.
‘There, that’s the only thing I’ve got left. Do you think you can drink so much?’
Delightedly he assured her that he could.
‘Yes, I dare say you could too,’ said Adamantina. ‘But I’m not sure that I’m prepared
to waste so much of my best tea on you. You know what they say “One cup for a
connoisseur, two for a rustic, and three for a thirsty mule”. What sort of creature
does that make you if you drink this bowlful?’
Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu all three laughed at this. Adamantina poured the
equivalent of about a cupful into the bamboo-root bowl. Savouring it carefully in
little sips, Bao-yu found it of incomparable freshness and lightness and praised it
enthusiastically.
‘You realize, of course,’ said Adamantina seriously, ‘that it is only because of the
other two that you are drinking this. If you had come here alone, I should not have
given you any.
Bao-yu laughed.
‘I fully realize that, and I don’t feel in the least indebted to you. I shall offer my
thanks to them.’
Adamantina pondered this statement with unsmiling gravity.
‘Yes. I think that would be sensible.’
‘Is this tea made with last year’s rain-water too?’ Dai-yu asked her.
Adamantina looked scornful.
‘Oh! can you really not tell the difference? I am quite disap?pointed in you. This is
melted snow that I collected from the branches of winter-flowering plum-trees five
years ago, when I was living at the Coiled Incense temple on Mt Xuan-mu. I managed
to fill the whole of that demon-green glaze water-jar with it. For years I couldn’t bring
myself to start it; then this summer I opened it for the first time Today is only the
second time I have ever used any. I am mod surprised that you cannot tell the
difference. When did stored rain-water have such buoyant lightness? How could one
possibly use it for a tea like this?’
Dai-yu was too well aware of Adamantina’s eccentricity to attempt a reply; and since
it felt awkward to sit there saying nothing, she signalled to Bao-chai that they should
go. While the three of them were leaving, Bao-yu stopped to have a word with
Adamantina.
‘That cup that the old woman drank out of: of course, I realize that you can’t
possibly use it any more, but it seems a shame to throw it on one side. Couldn’t you
give it to the old woman? She’s very poor, and if she sold it, she could probably live
for quite a long while on the proceeds. What do you think?’
Adamantina reflected for some moments and then nodded.
Yes, I suppose so. Fortunately I have never drunk out of that cup myself. If I had, I
should have smashed it to pieces rather than give it to her. If you want her to have it,
though, you must give it to her yourself. I will have no part in it. And you must take it
away immediately.’
‘But of course,’ said Bao-yu. ‘No one would expect you to speak to her. That would
be an even greater pollution. Just give the cup to me and I shall see to the rest.’
Adamantina ordered the cup to be brought in and handed over to Bao-yu. As he took
it, Bao-yu said
‘After we’ve gone, shall I get my boys to bring a few buckets of water from the lake
and clean the floor for you ?’
Adamantina smiled graciously.
‘That would be very nice. But tell them to bring the water only as far as the gate.
They can leave it there at the foot of the outer wall. Tell them not to come inside.’
‘Of course,’ said Bao1u, putting the cup into his sleeve as they went into the foyer.
He found a junior maid of Grand?mother Jia’s there and entrusted it to her.
‘When Grannie Liu goes, see that she takes this Cup with her, will you?’
By the time he had done this, Grandmother Jia was already outside in the courtyard
expressing a desire to get back. Ada?mantina made no serious effort to detain her,
and after seeing her guests out of the Hermitage, went in again and closed the gate
after her.

*

Back at the scene of the party, Grandmother Jia, who was feeling somewhat
exhausted, told Lady Wang and the girls to act as hostesses to Aunt Xue while she
herself went off to Sweet-rice Village for a rest. Xi-feng ordered the servants to fetch
a little bamboo carrying-chair, which Grandmother Jia got into. Two old women lifted
it up, and then off they all went, Xi-feng and Li Wan one on either side of it and a
little cohort of maids and older servants bringing up the rear.
As soon as Grandmother Jia had gone, Aunt Xue excused herself and left, Lady Wang,
having dismissed the young actresses and given orders for the left-over food in the
lacquer boxes to be distributed among the maids, also availed herself of the
opportunity of taking a rest. Putting her feet up on the couch lately occupied by
Grandmother Jia, she first caused the blinds to be let down, then, instructing one of
the junior maids to massage her legs, and murmuring something about ‘calling her if
anyone came from Her Old Ladyship’, she settled her-self down for a nap.
Bao-yu and the girls watched the maids take the food-boxes out onto the rockery.
Some sat there on the rocks for their picnic; others spread out over the grass below
or sat under the trees or down at the water’s edge. Although so dispersed, they
managed to create a considerable hubbub.
After a little while Faithful arrived with instructions to show Grannie Liu some more
of the Garden. The cousins, hoping for more laughs, went along with them.
A short walk took them to the monumental stone arch at the entrance to the
Reunion Palace.
‘Goodness me!’ said the old woman. ‘You even have a temple here!’
She fell down on her knees and kotowed, causing her young companions to double
up with laughter.
‘Why do you laugh?’ she said. ‘Do you think I don’t know what the words say? We
have quite a few temples where I come from and they all have arches like this. The
writing on the arch is the name of the temple.’
‘All right. What’s the name of this temple then?’ they asked her.
Grannie Liu pointed upwards at the characters inscribed overhead.
‘“Temple of the Jade Emperor”. That’s what it says, doesn’t it?’
This produced an ecstasy of merriment in the young people. No doubt they would
have gone on teasing her, but just at that moment there was an alarming rumble
from her bowels and she clutched the hand of one of the little maidservants standing
by and begged her for the favour of a couple of sheets of paper, while with the other
hand she began undoing the buttons of her dress.
The others, still laughing, shouted at her to stop
‘No, no! Not here! Not here!’
They told one of the older women to escort her to a place beyond the north-east
corner of the precincts where there was a privy. Having led Grannie Liu to within
sight of it and pointed it out to her, the old servant deemed this an excellent
opportunity of taking some time off, and went away, leaving Grannie Liu to make her
way back alone.
Now Grannie Liu had drunk quantities of yellow rice-wine, which did not in fact agree
with her; on top of that she had eaten a lot of rich, fatty food; and as the food had
made her thirsty, she had concluded by drinking an excessive amount of tea. The
upset stomach which was the inevitable consequence of so much indulgence kept
her a wearisome long time in the privy before her business there was completed.
When she at last emerged, the colder air outside drove the wine fumes up into her
head, increasing the dizziness, which might be thought normal in a woman of her
years who has suddenly got up after squatting for a long time on her heels, to such
an extent that she was quite Unable to make out the route that she had come by.
Everywhere she looked there were buildings, rocks and trees. Unable to decide which
of them lay in the right direction, she made for the nearest paved path and, with slow
and deliberate steps, followed it to see where it would take her.
It took her in time to the courtyard wall of a house, but she could find no gate in it,
and after wandering round a long while looking for one, she came upon a bamboo
trellis, which she contemplated with some astonishment.
‘Hmn. Bean-sticks. What are they doing here?’
The ‘bean-sticks’ resolved themselves into a rose-covered pergola. After walking
alongside it for a while, she came to a round ‘moon-gate’, which she entered. Ahead
of her was a channel of crystal-clear water, five or six feet wide. Its banks were
reinforced with stone, and a large, flat slab of white stone had been laid across it to
make a bridge. After she had crossed the bridge there was a raised cobbled path
which, after a couple of right-angled bends, brought her up to the door of the house.
The first thing she saw on entering it was a young woman smiling at her in welcome.
Grannie Liu smiled back.
‘I’m lost, miss. The young ladies have left me to find my own way and I’ve
wandered in here by mistake.’
Surprised that the girl did not reply, Grannie Thu stepped forward to take her hand
and—bang!—hit her head a most painful thump on the wooden wall. The girl was a
painting, as she found on closer inspection.
‘Strange!’ she thought. ‘How can they paint a picture so that it sticks out like that?’
Grannie Liu was ignorant of the foreign mode of light-and-?shadow painting and was
sorely puzzled to discover, on touch?ing the picture, that it did not in fact ‘stick out’
but was flat all over. Turning from it with a sigh and a shake of her head, she moved
on to a little doorway in the wooden partition-wall, over which hung a green,
flower-patterned portière. She raised the portiere and went inside.
In the room she now entered everything, from the top of the surrounding walls,
delicately incised with shapes of swords, vases, musical instruments, incense-burners
and the like, to the lavish furnishing below, in which

                 The weaver’s glowing art combined
                 With gleam of gold and. orient pearl,

and thence down to the very floor of brilliantly patterned green glazed tiles beneath
her feet, was such as to make even more dazzled the eyes of an already intoxicated
old woman.
She looked for the way out - but where was it? To the left of her there was a
bookcase, to the right a screen. She tried behind the screen. Ah, yes! There was the
door. But there too, to her intense surprise, approaching her from the opposite
direction and causing her a momentary palpitation of the heart, was another old
woman, whom she took to be her old gossip from the village.
‘What? are you here too?’ she asked her, ‘I suppose you were wondering what had
become of me these last few days. Well, it was neighbourly to come and look for me.
Which of the young women brought you in?’
She noticed, with much amusement, that her old neigh?bour’s head was covered all
over with flowers.
‘Hoo! You’ll catch it! Picking the flowers from their garden to put in your own hair.
Well I never!’
The other merely grinned back at her and said nothing. Grannie Liu stretched out a
hand to give her the touch of shame. The other old woman stretched her hand out
too to stop her. After a. brief’ soundless skirmish, Grannie Liu managed to get her
finger onto the other one’s face. But no sooner had she done so than she recoiled in
horror, for the cheek she touched was as cold and hard as a block of ice. Suddenly
the truth dawned on her:
‘I’ve heard of rich folks having what they call “dressing mirrors ‘in their houses.
Mayhap I’m standing in front of one of them and it’s myself I’m looking at.’
She stretched out her hand again to feel and closely examined the surface. Yes, no
doubt of it: it was a mirror, let into the carved surface of the wooden partition. She
laughed at her own error.
‘Yes, but how do I get out of here?’ she thought, as she continued to finger the
mirror’s carved surround.
Suddenly there was a loud clunk! which so frightened the old woman that for some
moments she rolled her eyes in ter?ror. The mirror was in fact a kind of door. It had a
West Ocean mechanism by which it could be opened or closed, and Gran?nie Liu, in
feeling around it, had accidentally touched the spring which had made the mirror
slide back into the panel?ling, revealing the doorway underneath.
Pleasantly surprised, she passed through the doorway into a room whose main
feature was a rich and elegantly patterned bed. Now Grannie Liu was seven or eight
parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking. Seeing a bed in front of
her, she sat down on it gratefully, to rest her feet. But though she intended no more
than a few moments’ rest, as soon as she had sat down, her weariness overcame her.
Her head went down and her feet went up as though she was no longer in possession
of them; a darkness closed over her eyes, and she sank back on the bed, fast asleep.
Outside in the Garden meanwhile, the cousins were begin?ning to wonder what had
become of her, and Ban-er, missing his grandmother, became panicky and began to
cry.
‘Perhaps she’s fallen into the privy,’ one of the young people suggested cheerfully.
‘We’d better send someone to have a look.’
Two old women were sent to the privy to investigate. When they reported back ‘hat
she was not there, the others were at a loss to think where she could have got to. It
was Aroma who hit on the correct hypothesis.
‘She must have missed the way back because she was drunk. If she followed the
path in the wrong direction, it will have taken her to our back Courtyard. Now if she
went through the pergola and then on into the house through the back door, she’ll
probably have been seen by one of the maids. If she didn’t go in through the pergola
but went on walking in a south-westerly direction, Heaven only knows where she’ll
end up! I think I’d better go and have a look.
She hurried back to Green Delights, intending to ask the junior maids if they had seen
her; but the place was deserted; they had all sneaked off elsewhere to play. Entering
the main building by way of the front door, she made her way through the
complicated carved partition. A thunderous snoring could be heard coming from the
bedroom at the back. She hurried through. As she entered the bedroom, a heavy
stink, com?pounded of farts and wine-fumes, assailed her nostrils. Her eyes travelled
to the bed, from which the sounds were coming, and saw Grannie Liu, spreadeagled
on her back and fast asleep.
As soon as she had overcome her shock, she rushed up to the bed and shook her
relentlessly until she woke. Grannie Liu opened her eyes wide and saw Aroma
standing over her.
‘Oh, miss!’ She scrambled hurriedly to her feet. C Oh, I am sorry! Anyway—praise
be!— I haven’t dirtied the bed.’
She felt it nervously, to make sure.
Aroma, mortally afraid that someone would overhear and Bao-yu get to know of
what had happened, gestured to her violently not to speak. Hurriedly she threw
three or four whole handfuls of Hundred Blend aromatic onto the incense burner
that stood always smouldering beside the bed and re?placed its cover.
‘At least it’s a mercy she wasn’t sick,’ she thought to her?self.
Speaking to her in an urgent whisper, she nevertheless con?trived to smile at her
reassuringly:
‘It’s all right. I’ll look after this. Just follow me.’
Grannie Liu nodded gratefully and followed her to the junior maids’ quarters outside,
where Aroma made her sit down.
  ‘If they ask what happened, just say that you passed Out and had a little nap on
the rockery.’
Grannie Liu willingly agreed, and Aroma gave her some tea. By the end of the second
cup she had sobered up com?pletely and was able to converse.
‘Which of the young ladies does the bedroom belong to?’ she asked Aroma. ‘It’s the
most beautiful I ever saw. I thought I was in paradise.’
Aroma gave a wry little smile.
‘It’s—actually it’s Master Bao’s bedroom.’
Grannie Liu fell silent, horrified by the enormity of her trespass. Seeing that she had
now recovered, Aroma led her out through the front courtyard and back to where
the others were waiting.
‘I found her asleep on the grass,’ she said when she saw them, ‘so I’ve brought her
back for you.’
The others seemed satisfied with this explanation, for no further mention was made
of it.
Shortly after this Grandmother Jia woke up and dinner was laid for her in Sweet-rice
Village; but she felt too exhausted to eat anything, and getting into the bamboo
carrying-chair again, had herself carried back to her own apartment to rest. When
she was back, she told Xi-feng and the rest of the young folk who had escorted her to
go and have their dinner, and the cousins went back into the Garden
Ensuing events will be dealt with in the following Chapter.
CHAPTER 42

Lady Allspice wins over a suspicious nature with some
well-intentioned advice
And River Queen enhances her reputation as a wit with
some amusing sarcasms



The last chapter showed how Grandmother Jia, escorted by all the others, returned
from Sweet-rice Village to her own apartment. As soon as she arrived, she insisted
that the young people should go off and have their dinner. The young people
accordingly went back into the Garden, and when they had eaten, the party finally
broke up.
Returning from the Garden with little Ban-er, Grannie Liu first called on Xi-feng to
announce her intention of leaving for home early next morning.
‘We’ve only been here two or three days,’ she said, ‘but in these two or three days
we’ve seen and heard and eaten and drunk more things than we ever dreamed of.
I’m truly grateful to you and Her Old Ladyship and the young gentlewomen and the
young ladies working in the different apartments for treating an old countrywoman
with so much kindness. I don’t know what I can do in return. All I can think of is to
buy some sticks of best incense when I get back so that I can offer some every day to
the Lord Buddha and pray him to give you long life. Leastways it would show my
gratitude.’
‘It’s a bit early yet for rejoicing,’ said Xi-feng drily. ‘Thanks to you, Her Old Ladyship
seems to have caught a chill and is at this very moment lying on her back
complaining how bad she feels; and my little girl has caught a cold, too, and is lying in
there with a fever.’
Grannie Liu murmured sympathetically.
‘Her Old Ladyship’s feeling her age, poor soul,’ she said. And she isn’t used to the
exercise.’
‘I’ve never seen her more lively than she was today,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Generally when
she goes into the Garden, she’ll visit just one or two places, sit there for a little while,
and then come back again. But today, because you were there and she wanted to
show you everything, she must have covered the greater part of the Garden. It was
also because of you that I wasn’t on hand when Lady Wang gave my little girl that
piece of cake. I’m sure it was eating out in the cold that has made her feverish.’
‘I suppose your little lass doesn’t go into the Garden very much,’ said Grannie Liu.
‘Not like our young ones, off to play in the grave-garths almost as soon as they can
walk. She may have caught a cold from the wind as you say. On the other hand,
children of her age, being pure of body, often have the second sight. It could have
been brought on by seeing a spirit. If I was you, I’d have a look in the Almanac, just in
case. You never know, the child might have been pixified.’
Wondering why she had not thought of this herself, Xi-feng at once ordered Patience
to fetch down the Jade Casket. Sun?shine was summoned to look up the relevant
passage and read it out to them. This, after some preliminary hunting, he pro?ceeded
to do:

EIGHTH MONTH. TWENTY-FIFTH DAY: Sicknesses Occurring on this day have a
south-easterly origin. Possible causes Encounter with spirit of hanged person or
flower spirit. Recommended action Maxi?mum benefit may be obtained by procuring
voluntary departure of spirit. To do this, take forty pieces of coloured paper spirit
money’ and walk forty paces in a south-easterly direction offering one of the pieces
at every step.

    ‘There you are!’ said Xi-feng. ‘That must be it. The Garden is just where you’d
expect to run into a flower spirit. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if that doesn’t account
for Her Old Lady?ship’s trouble as well.’
She sent someone forthwith to obtain two lots of spirit money and got two of the
servants to carry out the exorcism, one on Grandmother Jia’s behalf and the other on
behalf of her little girl. As soon as it was over, she and Grannie Liu went in to see how
Baby was getting on. They found her sleeping peacefully.
‘There!’ said Xi-feng delightedly. ‘It takes an old, ex?perienced person like yourself
to know these things. Perhaps you could also tell me why she’s such a sickly little girl.
She’s always going down with something or other.’
‘There’s nothing unusual about that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Children of well-to-do folks
are brought up so delicate, their bodies can’t stand any hardship. And for another
thing, when young folks are cherished too much, it overloads their luck. It might be
better for her if in future you tried not to make quite so much of her.’
‘You may be right,’ said Xi-feng without much conviction. ‘It’s just occurred to me:
as we haven’t named the child yet, I wonder if you’d like to name her for us? For one
thing, being named by someone so old will help her to live longer; and for another—I
hope you won t mind my saying this, but you country people do have quite a lot of
poverty and hardship to contend with—being named by a poor person like yourself
may help to balance her luck.’
Grannie Liu thought for a bit.
‘When was she born?’
‘Ah, that’s just the trouble,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She was born on Qiao-jie—the Seventh of
the Seventh—a very unlucky date.’
‘No matter,’ said Grannie Lin. ‘Call her “Qiao-jie” then. That’s what the doctors
mean when they talk about “fighting poison with poison and fire with fire”. You call
her “Qiao?-jie” like I say, and I guarantee that she’ll live to a ripe old age. I prophesy
for this child that when she’s a big girl and the others are all going off to get married,
she may for a time find that things are not going her way; but thanks to this name, all
her misfortunes will turn into blessings, and what at first looked like bad luck will turn
out to be good luck in the end.’
Xi-feng was of course delighted with these ‘auspicious words’ and thanked her
warmly.
‘May it turn out for her as you say!’
She summoned Patience.
‘We’re going to be busy tomorrow and may not have the time then. As you’ve got
nothing to do at the moment, why don’t you get the things for Grannie together, so
that every?thing will be ready for her to start first thing tomorrow?’
‘Please don’t go giving me a lot of things,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’ve already put you to
so much inconvenience these last few days, I should feel even more uncomfortable
carrying a lot of things back with me.’
‘These are only very ordinary things,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Noth?ing special. Just a few
things for you to take back with you and show off to the neighbours. Just so as to be
able to say that you’ve been to town.’
‘Come over here, Grannie, and have a look,’ said Patience. Grannie Lu followed her
into the next room. A full half of the kang was occupied by her piled-up presents.
Patience picked them up one by one and explained them to her.
‘This sky-blue material is the gauze you said you wanted. The pale-blue gauze in a
closer weave is a present from the Mistress to line it with. These are two lengths of
wild-silk pongee. You can use it to make either a dress or a skirt with; it would do
equally well for either. In this wrapping here there are two lengths of silk for making
up into a New Year outfit. This is a box of various kinds of cakes and pastries made in
the Imperial kitchens. There are some kinds that you’ve al?ready eaten and some
that you haven’t. You want to put them out on plates when you’re having someone
to tea: you’ll find they’re a bit better than the ones you can buy in the shops. These
two sacks are the ones you brought the vegetables in when you came. This one has
got two bushels of pink ‘Em?peror’ rice in it. It makes a really delicious congee. This
one has got fruit and nuts and other things from the Garden in it. And this packet
here has got eight taels of silver in it. Every?thing up to here is from the Mistress.
Now these two packets here have each got fifty taels of silver in them - a hundred
taels in all. They’re a present from Her Ladyship, for starting a little business or
buying some land with when you get back, so that you can be self-sufficient in future
and not have to keep falling back on your friends. The two jackets’—here Patience
smiled somewhat embarrassedly—‘the two jackets and the two skirts and the four
head-scarves and the packet of embroidery silks are a present from me. The clothes
have only been worn a very little but they aren’t new: so if you decide to throw them
back at me, I shan’t complain.’
Grannie Liu had been exclaiming rapturously as each item was shown to her and
must have uttered several dozen ‘Holy Names’ by the time Patience came to her own
gift.
‘Throw them back at you, Miss?’ she said warmly, touched by the maid’s kindness
and humility. ‘How can you say such a thing? Fine clothes like these? I shouldn’t
know where to buy them if I had the money! You make me feel ashamed. I don’t like
to take them off you; yet if I don’t, you will think me un?grateful.’
‘Get away with you!’ said Patience. ‘That sort of talk is for strangers, and you are
one of us. If I didn’t think of you so, I’d never have dared make the offer. You just take
them and stop worrying. In any case, there’s something I want from you in return.
Next New Year, bring us some of your home-dried mixed vegetables: pigweed and
cowpeas and kidney beans and dried aubergines and dried gourd-shavings. Everyone
here loves them. You just bring us some of them. We don’t want anything else from
you, mind, so don’t go wondering what else to bring. Just bring some of them, and
we’ll be quits.’
Grannie Liu thanked her warmly and promised to remem?ber the dried vegetables.
‘Now off to bed with you!’ said Patience. ‘I’ll look after this lot for you. You can
leave it here tonight, and tomorrow we’ll send the boys out for a cab and get them to
load it for you. So you’ve got nothing to worry about.’
Overwhelmed by so much kindness, Grannie Liu went back into the other room to
take her leave of Xi-feng, and after thanking her many times over, went off to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment to spend the night.
She was up betimes next morning and would like to have said good-bye to
Grandmother Jia as soon as she had com?pleted her toilet, and made an early start;
but the family fore?stalled her. Knowing that the old lady was indisposed, they had
trooped in first thing to inquire how she was and had already sent outside for a
doctor. The latter’s arrival at the mansion was shortly after announced by an old
woman? servant, whereupon the old women in attendance on Grand mother Jia
urged her to conceal herself behind the curtains of the summer-bed. But
Grandmother Jia refused to budge.
‘I’m old, too, woman—old enough to be his mother, I shouldn’t wonder. What have
I got to fear from him at my age? I’m not going behind any curtains. Let him examine
me where I am.’
Seeing that she was resolved to stay, the old women brought up a little table and put
a small pillow on it for her to rest her arm on. These preparations completed, they
gave orders for the doctor to be admitted.
Dr Wang was shortly to be observed crossing the courtyard below, conducted by
Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong. Modestly declining to walk up the central ramp,
he followed Cousin Zhen up the right-hand side steps onto the terrace, where two
old women, one on either side of the doorway, were holding up the door-blind in
readiness. Bao-yu came for?ward to welcome the doctor as the two old women were
conducting him through the outer room, and led him, still accompanied by the other
gentlemen, to his grandmother inside.
The old lady was sitting up very stiffly on a couch. She was wearing a black crepe
jacket lined with pearly-haired baby lamb’s skin. Four little maids, their hair still done
up in childish ‘horns’, stood two on either side of her, holding fly whisks and
spittoons, and five or six old serving-women were fanned out in a sort of bodyguard
behind her. Vaguely dis?cernible glimpses of brightly-coloured dresses and golden
hair-ornaments betrayed the presence of numerous younger women behind the
green muslin curtains at the back. Not daring to raise his head in so much female
company, Dr Wang advanced and saluted his patient. Observing that he was dressed
in the uniform of a mandarin of the sixth rank, Grand?mother Jia deduced that he
must be a Court Physician, and in returning his salutation was careful to address him
with the ‘Worshipful’ to which his appointment entitled him.
‘And what is the Worshipful’s name?’ she asked Cousin Zhen.
‘Wang.’
‘When I was a young woman, the President of the Imperial College of Physicians
was a Wang,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Wang Jun-xiao. Famous for his diagnoses.’
The doctor bowed.
‘He was my great-uncle,’ he said, smiling demurely, but still not daring to raise his
head.
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘That makes you a friend of the family.’
She stretched out an arm and slowly arranged it for him on the pillow. The old
women brought up a large stool which they set down in front of her table and slightly
to one side. Dr Wang knelt on it, squatting on his heel with one haunch so that he
was half-sitting on the edge of the stool, and in that polite but uncomfortable
posture proceeded at great length to take the old lady’s pulses, first in one arm and
then in the other. After that he made another bow and retired, eyes still on the floor,
as they had been throughout the consultation.
‘Thank you,’ said Grandmother Jia as he was leaving. ‘See him out, will you, Zhen?
And see that he gets. some tea.’
Murmuring a reply, Cousin Zhen himself withdrew, fol?lowed by Jia Lian and Jia Rong,
and conducted Dr Wang back to one of the gentlemen’s rooms in the front part of
the mansion.
‘There’s nothing seriously wrong with Lady Jia,’ said Dr Wang when they were
seated. ‘She has a slight chill. There is no need for her to take any medicine. A light,
simple diet for a day or two and see that she keeps warm. That should be enough. I’ll
write Out a prescription that you can have made up if she feels like taking something.
If not, I should just for?get about it.’
He drank his tea and wrote out the prescription. Just as he was about to leave, the
nurse came hurrying in with Xi-feng’s little girl in her arms.
‘Doctor, have a look at us too, will you?’
The doctor went over, took one of the child’s hands and supported it on his own left
hand while he felt her pulse. Then he felt her forehead and inspected her tongue.
‘I’m afraid the young lady is not going to be very pleased with my advice,’ he said
with a smile. ‘A good, cleansing hunger is what she needs. Let her miss a couple of
meals. No need for a prescription. I shall send you some pills that you can dissolve in
hot ginger-water and give her to drink at bed?time. That should help do the trick.’
With that he took his leave once more and departed.
Cousin Zhen and the other two went back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment with the
prescription and reported what the doctor had said. Then they laid the prescription
on the table and withdrew.
Lady Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-chai and the rest came out from behind the curtain
as soon as the doctor had gone. Lady. Wang sat with Grandmother Jia for a while
before re?turning to her own apartment.
The coast was now at last clear for Grannie Liu to come forward and take her leave.
‘You must come again when you have the time,’ said Grand?mother Jia. She
ordered Faithful to see her off. ‘I can’t see you off myself,’ she said. ‘I’m not feeling
too well today.’
Grannie Liu, having thanked her and said good-bye, fol?lowed Faithful out of the
room and into a room at the side of the courtyard. Faithful pointed to a large bundle
on the kang.
‘These are dresses given to Her Old Ladyship by various people over the years as
birthday or festival presents, but as she refuses to wear any clothes made by
outsiders, they’ve none of them ever been worn. It’s a shame to keep them, really.
She told me yesterday to pick out a few for you to take back with you, either to give
away as presents or to wear yourself about the house. In this box here you’ll find
those pastries you wanted. This parcel has got the medicines in you were talking
about the other day: the Red Flower Poison Dis?pellers, the Old Gold Anti-Fever
Pastilles, the Blood Renewing Elixir Pills and the Easy Birth Pills. You’ll find each kind
wrapped up separately inside its own prescription. These two little silk purses are to
wear.’ Faithful undid the draw-strings and extracted from each purse a golden
‘Heart’s Desire’ medallion with a device showing an ingot, a writing-brush and a
sceptre. She smiled at Grannie Liu mischievously:
‘You give me these and keep the purses.’
Grannie Liu, surprised and delighted (as she showed by her many pious ejaculations)
to be receiving these further presents in addition to what Patience had shown her
the night before, seemed eager to accede to this request.
‘Yes, yes, Miss. You keep them by all means.’
Faithful, who had not intended to be taken seriously, re?placed the medallions in
their. purses and did them up again.
‘I was only pulling your leg. I’ve got lots of these things already. Keep them to give
the children at New Year.
While she was speaking, a little maid came in carrying a Cheng Hua enamelled
porcelain cup, which she handed to Grannie Liu.
‘Master Bao said I was to give you this.’
‘Well!’ said Grannie Liu as she took the cup from her. ‘Now what do you make of
that? Reckon it must be some?thing I did for him in a past life.’
‘Those clothes I gave you to change into the other day when you had your bath
were mine,’ said Faithful. ‘If you don’t mind taking them off me, I’ve got some more
like them that I’d like to make you a present of.’
As Grannie Liu made no objection, Faithful got out several more sets of clothing and
wrapped them up for her.
Grannie Lin wanted to go into the Garden to thank Bao-yu and the girls and say
good-bye to them; she also wanted to take her leave of Lady Wang; but Faithful
prevented her.
‘It isn’t necessary. In any case, they won’t be seeing anyone at this hour. I can thank
them for you when I see them later. Well, good-bye then. Come again when you can.’
She ordered an old servant-woman to fetch two pages from the inner gate to help
Grannie Liu out with her things. The old servant undertook to do this and also went
with Grannie Liu to collect the things from Xi-feng’s apartment. When they had got
them all together, she fetched the boys from the out?side corner gate who carried
them out to the street for her and loaded them into a waiting cab. Grannie Liu and
Ban-er then got in themselves and Set off without more ado on their journey back
home.
At this point they pass also out of our narrative, which turns now to other matters.
*

After they had eaten their lunch, Bao-chai and the test of the young people called
once more on Grandmother Jia, to see how she was progressing. On their way back,
as they reached that point in the Garden where their paths separated, Bao-chai
called Dai-yu over to her.
‘Frowner, come with me. There’s something I want to talk to you about.’
Dai-yu followed her to Allspice Court. When they were in?side her room, Bao-chai sat
down.
‘Well?’ she said to Dai-yu. ‘Aren’t you going to kneel down? I am about to
interrogate you.’
Dai-yu was mystified.
‘Poor Bao-chai!’ she said, laughing. ‘The girl’s gone off her head. Interrogate me
about what ?’
‘My dear, well-bred young lady!’ said Bao-chai. ‘My dear, sheltered young innocent!
What were those things I heard you saying yesterday? Come now, the truth!’
Dai-yu, still mystified, continued to laugh. She was begin?ning to feel somewhat
uneasy, though she would not admit it.
‘What awful thing am I supposed to have said? I expect you’re making it up, but
you may as well tell me.’
‘Still acting the innocent?’ said Bao-chai. ‘What were those things you said
yesterday when we were laying that drinking game? I couldn’t think where you could
have got them from.’
Dai-yu cast her mind back and remembered, blushing, that the day before, when
stumped for an answer, she had got through her turn by citing passages from The
Return of the Soul and The Western Chamber. She hugged Bao-chai imploringly.
‘Dear coz! I really don’t know. I just said them without thinking. If you tell me not to,
I promise not to say them again.’
‘I really don’t know either,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I just thought they sounded rather
interesting. I thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were.’
‘Dear coz! Please don’t tell anyone about this. I promise not to repeat such things
again.’
Moved by the scarlet, shame-filled face and pitifully entreating voice, Bao-chai
relented and did not pursue her questioning. Having first drawn her down into a seat
and handed her some tea, she began, very gently, to address her in the following
manner:
‘What do you take me for? I’m just as bad. At seven or eight I used to be a real little
terror. Ours was reckoned to be rather a literary family. My grandfather was a
bibliophile, so the house we lived in was full of books. We were a big family in those
days. All my boy cousins and girl cousins on my father’s side lived with us in the same
house. All of us younger people hated serious books but liked reading poetry and
plays. The boys had got lots and lots of plays: The Western Chamber, The Lute-player,
A Hundred Yuan Plays—just about everything you could think of. They used to read
them behind our backs, and we girls used to read them behind theirs. Eventually the
grown-ups got to know about it and then there were beatings and lectures and
burning of books—and that was the end of that.
‘So, you see, in the case of us girls it would probably be better for us if we never
learned to read in the first place. Even boys, if they gain no understanding from their
reading, would do better not to read at all; and if that is true of boys, it certainly
holds good for girls like you and me. The little poetry-writing and calligraphy we
indulge in is not really our proper business. Come to that, it isn’t a boy’s proper
business either. A boy’s proper business is to read books in order to gain an
understanding of things, so that when he grows up he can play his part in governing
the country.
‘Not that one hears of that happening much nowadays. Nowadays their reading
seems to make them even worse than they were to start with. And unfortunately it
isn’t merely a case of their being led astray by what they read. The books, too, are
spoiled, by the false interpretations they put upon them. They would do better to
leave books alone and take up business or agriculture. At least they wouldn’t do so
much damage.
‘As for girls like you and me: spinning and sewing are our proper business. What do
we need to be able to read for? But since we can read, let us confine ourselves to
good, im?proving books; let us avoid like the plague those pernicious works of fiction,
which so undermine the character that in the end it is past reclaiming.’
This lengthy homily had so chastened Dai-yu that she sat with head bowed low over
her teacup and, though her heart consented, could only manage a weak little ‘yes’ by
way of reply.
At that moment Candida came into the room:
‘Mrs Zhu says will you please come over to discuss an important matter with her?
Miss Ying and Miss Tan and Miss Xi and Miss Shi and Master Bao are there already,
waiting for you.’
‘I wonder what it is this time,’ said Bao-chai.
‘We shall soon find out if we go,’ said Dai-yu.
So off she went, and Bao-chai with her, to Sweet-rice Vil?lage. They found everyone
else there, as Candida had said. Li Wan greeted them with a smile.
‘We’ve only just got our poetry club started, and already someone is trying to
wriggle out of it. It’s Xi-chun. She’s ask?ing for a year’s leave of absence.’
‘I can guess why that is,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s because of what Grandmother said about
painting the Garden. She’s decided to use that as an excuse.’
‘I don’t think you should blame Grandmother,’ said Tan-?chun. ‘It’s what Grannie
Liu said that started it.’
‘Grannie Liu, yes, that’s right,’ Dai-yu hurriedly corrected herself. ‘Whose ‘grannie’
is she anyway, I’d like to know? ‘Old Mother Locust’ we ought to call her, not ‘Grannie
Liu’.’
This set them all laughing.
‘If one wants to hear the demotic at its most forceful,’ said Bao-chai, ‘one has to
listen to Cousin Feng. Fortunately for us she can’t read, so her jokes are somewhat
lacking in finesse and the language she uses can never rise above the level at which it
is commonly spoken. The secret of Frowner’s sar?castic tongue is that she uses the
method adopted by Confu?cius when he edited the Spring and Autumn Anna/s, that
is to say, she extracts the essentials from vulgar speech and polishes and refines
them, so that when she uses them to illustrate a point, each word or phrase is given
its maximum possible effectiveness. The mere name ‘Old Mother Locust,’, for
example, is sufficient to evoke the whole scene of yesterday’s party and everything
that happened at it. What’s more, she is able to do this sort of thing almost without
thinking.’
The others, still laughing, assured Bao-chai that she excelled as a commentator no
less than Dai-yu and Xi-feng, in their different ways, as wits.
‘The reason I asked you all here is because I wanted your advice on how long we
ought to give her,’ said Li Wan. ‘I said a month, but she says that’s much too short.
What do you all think?
‘Logically a year wouldn’t be at all too long,’ said Dai-yu. ‘If it took a whole year to
build the Garden, she would natural?ly require about two years in which to paint it.
First she’s got to grind her ink, then she’s got to soften her brushes, then she’s got to
fix the paper, then she’s got to find her colours, and then -,
The others realized that this was a joke at Xi-chun’s expense.
‘Yes?’ they said, playing up to her. ‘What then?’
Dai-yu, unable to maintain a straight face, was beginning to giggle.
‘—and then proceed in like manner, by gradual degrees, to paint it.’
Prolonged hilarity and clapping of hands.
‘In like manner, by gradual degrees’,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I like that. The telling phrase at
the end. The trouble with all those jokes we were laughing at yesterday is that they
were funny enough at the time, but on recollection they seem rather stupid. Dai-yu’s
jokes on the other hand, though the words at first appear colourless, are richly
humorous to remember. They certainly make me laugh a lot.’
‘You shouldn’t flatter her, Cousin Chai,’ said Xi-chun plaintively. ‘It encourages her
to show off. It’s because you complimented her on her joke about Grannie Liu that
she’s started making fun of me.’
‘Tell me now,’ said Dai-yu, taking Xi-chun’s hand in her own, ‘is it to be a picture of
the Garden alone, or are we to be in it as well?’
‘It was originally to have been of the Garden alone,’ said Xi-chun, ‘but afterwards
Grandmother said that that would make it look too much like an architect’s drawing
and told me to put in some people. She said what we wanted was something like one
of those paintings of ‘Scholars Enjoying Themselves in a Landscape’. The trouble is, I
don’t know how to do buildings in the Elaborate style, and I’m no good at human
figures; but as I was too scared to refuse, I’ve got myself into a mess.’
‘Human figures are no problem,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s the insect-painting that’s going to
give you the trouble.’
‘Now you’re talking nonsense,’ said Li Wan. ‘What need will there be of insects in a
painting of the Garden? A few animals and birds dotted here and there maybe, but
no insects, surely?’
‘If she has no other insects in it, she’s got to have Old Mother Locust,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Without her the painting would be incomplete.’
The others all laughed. Dai-yu continued, laughing so much herself that she had to
clutch her chest with both hands:
‘You must hurry up and get on with the painting. I’ve al?ready thought of a title to
inscribe on it when it’s finished. You must call it ‘With Locust to the Chew’.’
The others threw back their heads and roared. Their laughter ended abruptly,
however, when a loud crash caused them to look anxiously around them to see what
had fallen.
It turned out to have been Xiang-yun’s chair. It had been a somewhat rickety one to
start with, and in laughing she had thrown herself back against it so violently that the
two joints connecting the chairback with the seat had sprung, causing her to sink
backwards and sideways, still sitting in the disin?tegrating chair. Fortunately she was
saved by the room’s wooden partition from falling onto the floor. The undignified
spectacle of her descent provoked fresh shouts of mirth which only gradually
subsided when Bao-yu hurried over and helped her to her feet.
As he passed Dai-yu he signalled to her with his eyes. Understanding that something
must be wrong with her appearance, she slipped into Li Wan’s bedroom and took the
cover off the mirror to have a look. It was the hair above her brows that was coming
loose. She pulled out the drawer in Li Wan’s dressing-box, took out two little
vanity-brushes, primmed her hair at the mirror, then, hurriedly replacing everything,
went back into the outer room, where the others were still laughing. She pointed a
finger accusingly at Li Wan.
‘So this is your idea of ‘supervision in needlework and moral instruction’—inviting
us over here for jokes and horse?play!’
‘Did you hear that, all of you?’ said Li Wan. ‘This is the ringleader who sets
everyone else laughing and misbehaving, yet she has the effrontery to blame me for
starting it all! Oh, I could - ! Well, all I can say is that I hope when you marry you have
a real Tartar for a mother-in-law and lots of nasty sisters-in-law with tongues as sharp
as yours. It will serve you right!’
Dai-yu, blushing, clung to Bao-chai’s hand.
‘Let’s give her a year’s leave, shall we?’
‘Let me suggest what I think is a fair compromise and see what the rest of you think
of it,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s true that Lotus Dweller can paint, but ‘painting’ in her case
means no more than an occasional sketch in the Impressionistic style. Now of course,
you couldn’t paint this Garden in the first place if you didn’t have impressions of it;
but the trouble is that the Garden itself was designed rather like a painting, with
every rock, every tree, every building in it carefully and pre?cisely placed in order to
produce a particular scenic effect; and if you tried to get your impressions of all of
these different scenes onto paper exactly as they are, they simply wouldn’t make a
picture. The shape of the paper imposes its own per?spectives. You have to make
them into a composition. You have to decide which to bring into the foreground and
which to push into the background, which to leave out altogether and which to show
only in glimpses. When you’ve done that, you can make your rough draft. And even
then, it’s only when you’ve studied the draft for a long time and corrected it until
you’re satisfied that you can go ahead with your transfer.
‘One of your difficulties is going to be the ruler-work. With all those buildings
you’re going to have to do the straight lines with a ruler, and in ruler-work if you’re
not very careful it’s easy to make the most terrible mistakes - railings that slant to
one side, leaning pillars, windows on the skew or steps drawn Out of line. Sometimes
careless ruling can produce even more grotesque results, like a table squashed into a
wall or a flower?pot apparently testing on the side of a curtain. Any one of these
things is enough to make a painting look ridiculous.
‘Putting in the human figures is going to be another prob?lem. First of all you have
to be very careful that you have got them in the right perspective. Then again, in
painting figures the clothes and the position of the hands and feet are of great
importance. A careless slip of the brush can mean a mon?strously swollen hand or a
crippled leg. Compared with these, little mishaps like the colour of the face running
into the hair are of minor importance.
‘In my opinion this painting is going to be very, very diffi?cult. And since a year is
thought to be too long and a month too short, the compromise I suggest is that she
should be allowed half a year to do it in, but that Cousin Bao should be appointed to
help her. My reason is not that I think he knows mote about painting than she does
and can tell her how to do it—I am sure that if he tried, it would only make matters
worse—but because whenever there is anything she doesn’t know about or has
difficulty in putting in, he will be able to take the painting to one or another of his
men friends outside who know about these matters and ask for their advice.’
Bao-yu was enthusiastic.
‘That’s a splendid idea. Zhan Guang can do Elaborate style buildings and Cheng
Ri-xing is very good at women. I’ll go and have a word with them now.’
‘Didn’t I tell you you ought to be called ‘Busybody’?’ said Bao-chai. ‘Just because
I’ve mentioned the possibility, you don’t have to go rushing off straight away. Wait
until we’ve finished discussing what needs to be done, then you can go and see them.
The question now is, what is she going to do this painting on?’
‘We’ve got some. Snow Wave paper still,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It comes in large enough
pieces and it holds the ink well.’
‘Oh, you’re just hopeless I’ said Bao-chai. ‘Snow Wave is a good, ink-receptive
paper for doing calligraphy or Impres?sionist style paintings on, and it will stand up to
the wrinkle-and-wipe work in a Southern School landscape; but it is quite unsuitable
for a painting like this one involving detailed colouring and layer upon layer of graded
washes. You’d merely ruin the picture and waste the paper.
‘Now I’ll tell you what to do. Before they started on the construction of this Garden,
they made a very detailed draw?ing of the layout. It was only an artist’s impression,
but the measurements shown on it were all accurate. Why don’t you ask Lady Wang
for that drawing and then ask Cousin Feng to give you a piece of heavyweight pongee
of the same dimen?sions? Cousin Bao can get Uncle Zheng’s gentlemen to size it for
you, and they can make you a draft by adapting the archi?tect’s drawing and putting
in the human figures. He could even get them to touch in some of the
blue-and-green background for you and indicate where the outlines will need
reinforcing with milk gold or milk silver.
‘Meanwhile you must get hold of a portable stove that you can use for melting and
extracting your glue on and for heat?ing the water to wash your brushes with. You’ll
also need a long distemperer’s table, and a blanket to cover it, for resting your
painting on. And I don’t suppose your present supply of paint-saucers and brushes is
likely to be adequate. You’d better start from scratch and get yourself a completely
new outfit.’
‘I haven’t got any equipment to speak of,’ said Xi-chun. ‘I just use my ordinary
writing-brushes when I want to paint. As for colours: red ochre, Canton indigo,
gamboge and safflower red are the only four I’ve got. Apart from that, all I have is a
couple of colouring brushes.’
‘Why ever didn’t you tell me before?’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve still got lots of these
things. The only thing is, if I give them to you before you actually need them, they
will only be lying around doing nothing in your room the same as they now are in
mine. On second thoughts I think I’ll hang on to them for the time being. We can say
that I am keeping them for you. But I can let you have any of them you want as soon
as the need arises. I’d rather you used my stuff for painting fans with and that sort of
thing, though. It would be a waste to use it on this great big painting of the Garden.
What I’ll do for you now is to make out a list of materials you can ask Lady Jia for. You
may not know about some of these things, so perhaps it would be a good idea if
Cousin Bao were to take them down at my dictation.’
Bao-yu had brush and ink already prepared. He had been intending in any case to
take notes, in order to have his own record of what she said, and had merely to pick
up his brush and wait for her to begin.
Here is the list she dictated:

large size raft brushes              4
No.2 size raft brushes          4
No.3 size raft brushes          4
large wash layers               4
medium wash layer                    4
small wash layers                    4
large Southern crab’s claws         10
small Southern crab’s claws         10
whisker brushes                     10
large colouring brushes             20
small colouring brushes             20
face liners                           10
willow-slip brushes                 20
arrow-shaped cinnabar               4 oz.
Southern red ochre                  4 oz.
orpiment                               4 oz.
azurite                         4 oz.
malachite                             4 oz.
brush-stick gamboge                 4 oz.
     Canton indigo                        8 oz.
    oyster-shell white                   4 boxes
    safflower red                        10 sheets
    red powder-gold                 200 leaves
gold foil                        200 leaves
    quality Canton glue                  4 oz.
    clear alum                           4 oz.


‘That doesn’t allow for the alum and glue that will be needed for the sizing,’ said
Bao-chai. ‘You can leave that to the menfolk.
By the time these colours have been washed and ground and emulsified and graded,
you should have enough there to last you a lifetime—messing about and
practice-work in?cluded.’
She continued with her list:



superfine silk strainers         4
coarse silk strainers            2
strainer-brushes            4
mortars, various sizes      4
coarse howls                     20
5-in. saucers               10
3 in. porcelain ditto            20
portable stoves             2
casseroles, various sizes        4
new porcelain water-jars    2
new water-buckets           2
1-ft white linen bags    4
light charcoal             20 catties
willow-wood charcoal        1 catty
3-drawer chest of drawers   1
gauze, close-woven          1 ell
raw ginger                  2 oz.
soy sauce                   1/2 catty


‘—a cooking-pot and a frying-slice,’ Dai-yu added hurriedly.
‘What are they for?’ said Bao-chai.
‘To use with the ginger and soy sauce,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Then she’ll be able to cook the
colours and eat them.’
The others laughed, including Bao-chai herself.
‘Frowner! Frowner!’ she said. ‘What do you know about it? If you didn’t first
season the new saucers by rubbing ginger-juice and sauce on the bottom and
burning them in, they would crack when you put them on the heat.’
The others assured Dai-yu that this was so. Dai-yu, mean?while, was reading through
the list.
‘Just look!’ she said, laying a hand on Tan-chun’s arm and speaking to her in an
undertone. ‘All those water-jars and chests of drawers and things to paint a picture! I
think she must have got confused at this point and started making a list for her
trousseau.’
This set Tan-chun off into a fit of the giggles. ‘Pinch her lips, Chai!’ she said. ‘You
should hear what she’s been saying about you.’
‘I don’t need to,’ said Bao-chai. ‘One doesn’t expect ivory from a dog’s mouth!’
Bearing down on Dai-yu as she said this, she forced her back, laughing and protesting,
upon the kang and made as if she would pinch her face.
‘Oh, please coz, forgive me!’ Dai-yu pleaded. ‘Little Frowner is younger than you
and doesn’t know any better. You should teach me how to be good. If you won’t be
nice to me, who else can I turn to?’
The others, not knowing what lay behind these words, were greatly amused.
‘Do forgive her!’ they said, laughing. ‘How pitifully she pleads! Even we are melted.’
But Bao-chai knew she was referring to their recent confrontation on the subject of
forbidden books, and feeling rather embarrassed to have this dragged up in the midst
of a playful tussle, hurriedly released her. Dai-yu rose to her feet laughing.
‘That’s my good coz. If it had been me, I should never have let you off!’
Bao-chai pointed her finger at Dai-yu and smiled at her in?dulgently.
‘I’m not surprised that Lady Jia is so fond of you or that the others find you so
amusing. I can’t help being fond of you too, little coz. Come here and let me do your
hair for you.’
Dai-yu turned her head obediently while Bao-chai re?fastened her back hair. Bao-yu,
watching from where he sat, thought how much better it looked for Bao-chai’s
attention, and wished that he had not told Dai-yu earlier to tidy the hair above her
brows, for then Bao-chai could have done that for her too. His agreeable musings on
the subject were interrupted by Bao-chai’s voice:
‘Have you finished writing the list? Perhaps you’d better be the one to see Lady Jia
about it. If they’ve got those things here already, so much the better. If not, you’ll
have to get some money to buy them with. In that case I might be able to advise you
on where to go for them.’
Bao-yu folded up the list and stowed it away inside his jacket. They continued to sit a
while longer, chatting about this and that.
After dinner they went to call on Grandmother Jia to see how she was. She had been
suffering from nothing more serious than a slight chill aggravated by fatigue, and by
the evening, after a day’s cosseting and two doses of the mild sudorific prescribed by
Dr Wang, she was almost better.
If you want to know what the next day held in store, you will have to read the
following chapter.

CHAPTER 43

An old woman’s whim is the occasion of a birthday collection
And a young man’s remorse finds solace in a simple ceremony



Our story recommences in Lady Wang’s apartment next day. On the previous
evening’s visit she had found Grandmother Jia almost completely recovered after
only two doses of the medicine prescribed for her that same morning by the doctor.
Satisfied that it was only a mild chill, contracted during her day in Prospect Garden,
and not anything more serious that the old lady had been suffering from, and
deeming it unneces?sary to make an early call again this morning, Lady Wang
summoned Wang Xi-feng to her own apartment to discuss the getting together of
some things to send to her husband, Jia Zheng. A summons from Grandmother Jia
arrived neverthe?less, and Lady Wang hurried over, taking Xi-feng with her, to see
what was the matter.
‘Are you still feeling better today, Mother?’ she asked her when they arrived.
‘I’m quite recovered now, thank you,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ve had a sip or two of
the pheasant stew you sent me. It was very tasty I ate some of the meat in it and
enjoyed it very much.’
You have Feng to thank for that,’ said Lady Wang with a smile. ‘See how dutiful she is
to you! It shows that your kind?ness is not wasted on her.’
Grandmother Jia returned the smile and nodded affably.
‘It was good of her to think of me. If there’s any of the meat still left, I’d rather like a
few pieces of it fried. It has a pleasant, salty tang that goes well with the rice-gruel I
am taking The stew is very nice, but stew and gruel don’t go very well to?gether.’
Xi-feng at once sent orders to the main kitchen to have the pheasant-meat prepared.
‘Well, it wasn’t really my diet that I wanted to talk about,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘The reason I’ve sent for you is because the second of the ninth month is Feng’s
birthday. In previous years, though I’ve always meant to do something about it,
something or other has always cropped up which has pre?vented me from
celebrating it properly. As we’re all of us here together this year and it doesn’t look as
if there are likely to be any distractions, I propose that we should get together and
make a day of it.’
‘I was thinking just the same thing,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Since you feel in such good
spirits, Mother, why not settle now what we should do?
‘Well now, this is what I have been thinking,’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘In other years,
no matter whose birthday it’s been, we’ve each of us given our individual presents.
Now that’s so dull, and what’s more, I think it’s a rather unsociable way of
celebrating a birthday. I’ve thought of a new way which will be much more sociable
and also lots of fun.’
‘Whatever it is, I’m sure that’s what we ought to do,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I think we ought to imitate what they do in poorer fami?lies,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Everyone subscribes something towards a common pool, then, when it’s all been
collected, you spend it all on some treat or other, depending on how much you have.
What do you think of the idea?’
‘It sounds a very good one,’ said Lady Wang. ‘But how do we go about collecting
the subscriptions ?’
At this Grandmother Jia became still more animated. Let Aunt Xue and Lady Xing be
invited without delay, she told them. Let Bao-yu and the girls be sent for. And You-shi
from the other mansion. And why not Lai Da’s wife and some of the more respected
older members of the female staff? In?fected by her enthusiasm, the maids and older
women-servants went scurrying off in all directions to summon or invite.
In less time than it would take to eat a meal, all those invited, young and old,
mistress and servant, had been assembled, and the room was packed. Aunt Xue and
Grandmother Jia sat on their own facing the multitude, Lady Xing and Lady Wang on
chairs at the opposite side of the room beside the door. Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun
and the Three Springs sat in a row at the back of the kang behind Grandmother Jia
and Aunt Xue. Bao-yu half reclined in his grandmother’s lap. All the rest stood,
shoulder to shoulder, on the floor below.
As soon as she saw that they were all assembled, Grand?mother Jia gave orders for
stools to be brought so that Lai Da’s mother and various other of the more aged and
respected servants present might sit down. It was customary in the Jia household to
treat the older generation of servants those who had served the parents of the
present masters—with even greater respect than the younger generation of masters,
so that in this instance it was not thought at all surprising that You-shi, Xi-feng and Li
Wan should remain standing while old Mrs Lai and three or four other old nannies
(though not without first apologizing for the liberty) seated themselves on the stools.
Grandmother Jia now smilingly announced the proposal that she had already
outlined to Lady Wang. All present, it need hardly be said, were willing to fall in with
it—some because they were on good terms with Xi-feng and were genuinely happy
to give her pleasure, some because they were afraid of her and welcomed this as an
opportunity of getting themselves into her good books, and all because in any case
they could afford to do so. Accordingly, as soon as Grandmother Jia had finished
speaking, they all enthusiastically and with one voice agreed.
Grandmother Jia opened the list with her own subscription:
‘I’ll give twenty taels.’
‘I’ll follow Lady Jia,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Twenty taels.’
Lady Xing and Lady Wang called next:
‘We obviously can’t put ourselves on a level with Lady Jia. Sixteen taels.’
You-shi and Li Wan, decreasing their call by a like amount, came next:
‘Twelve taels.’
‘We can’t have you paying out that sort of money,’ Grand?mother Jia said to Li Wan,
‘—a young widow with no mean of her own. I’ll pay yours for you.’
‘Now don’t get carried away, Grandma! ‘said xi-feng. ‘You ought to do your sums
first before you start interfering. Don’t forget you’ve already got two of the young
folk, Bao-yu and Cousin Lin, to pay for besides your own contribution. It’s all very well
promising to pay these additional twelve taels for Li Wan in the heat of the moment,
but later on you’ll be wish?ing you hadn’t. You’ll probably end up by saying that it
was all because of that wretched Feng that you had to pay out so much money and
think of some trick for getting it back from me three or four times over. I know. Don’t
tell me I’m imagin?ing this.’
This made everyone laugh.
‘All right,’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing herself. ‘Then what do you propose?’
‘Well now, it isn’t even my birthday yet, but already I’m feeling uncomfortable
because so much is being done for me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It seems unlucky—so many
people being put to so much expense on my account while I don’t pay a penny myself.
Pd feel a lot easier if you’d let me pay this contribution for Li Wan; then, when the
day comes, I shall be able to eat and drink as much as I like without any fear of
spoiling my luck.’
Grandmother Jia hesitated, but consented when Lady Xing and Lady Wang both
insisted that this was the best solution.
‘I’ve got another suggestion to make,’ said xi-feng. ‘Your own contribution Is twenty
taels, Grandma, and on top of that you’re going to be paying contributions for
Bao-chai and Cousin Lin. It’s true that Aunt Xue will be paying Cousin Chai’s
contribution on top of her twenty taels, but that doesn’t seem quite so unfair. What
does seem unfair to me is that Mother and Aunt Wang should be paying only sixteen
taels each for themselves, yet paying no extras at all for any of the young people. I
think you’re getting the worst of this arrange?ment, Grannie.’
‘See what a good girl my Feng is to me!’ said Grandmother Jia delightedly. ‘You’re
quite right, my dear. If you hadn’t mentioned it, I should have let them get away with
it—as usual!’
‘All you need do, Grannie, is to make the two young people their responsibility. Let
each pay for one of them.’
‘That’s fair,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Yes, that’s what I’ll do.’
Lai Da’s old mother rose up from her stool in mock indig?nation.
‘But this is rank mutiny! It makes me feel really angry on Their Ladyships’ behalf.
What, side with Her Old Ladyship against your husband’s mother and your own
father’s sister? That’s a arrant breach of the laws o’ consanguinity!’
This sally was greeted with a burst of laughter from Grand?mother Jia and all the
others present. Old Mrs Lai remained standing until it had subsided and then made
her own offer.
‘If Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian are each contributing twelve taels, I suppose we’d better
go a step lower?’
‘Oh no, that won’t do at all!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You may be a step below them
in rank, but you’re all wealthy women. I know you’ve got lots more money than they
have. You can’t give more, of course, but at least you should give as much.’
The old women, led by Mrs Lai, willingly agreed.
‘The girls’ contribution will be only for form’s sake, any?way,’ said Grandmother Jia
in reference to the row of figures sitting silently behind her on the kang. ‘I should
think about the equivalent of a month’s allowance would be the right amount?
She turned to Faithful.
‘Come on, now I We’re not leaving you out! Go and get some of the other girls
together and decide how much you are going to give.’
Faithful slipped out and presently returned with Patience, Aroma, Suncloud and one
or two other of the senior maids. Some said they would give one tael, others two.
Grandmother Jia noticed that Patience was one of them.
‘Surely you’ll be doing something for your mistress at home?’ she said. ‘You don’t
need to contribute to this fund as well.’
‘Yes, ma’am, I shall be doing something at home,’ said Patience, ‘but that’s private.
This is a public thing, so I shall contribute to this along with the rest.’
Grandmother Jia smiled at her graciously and commended her public spirit.
‘Well,’ said Xi-feng genially, ‘now just about everyone seems to have been roped in
except Aunt Zhou and Aunt Zhao. Wouldn’t it be a politeness to ask them if they
would like to contribute as well? They might take it as a slight if we left them out.’
‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Whatever made me forget about them? They
probably won’t be free to come over, though. One of the maids had better go and ask
them.’
One of the maids had gone off on this mission almost before she had finished
speaking. She returned, after a long interval, to say that the concubines would
contribute two taels each.
‘Good!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Now take a brush and ink, someone, and calculate
how much we shall have altogether.’
In the interval thus created, You-shi addressed Xi-feng in a scornful whisper.
‘What a mean, grasping young woman you are! Your aunt and your mother-in-law
and all these other people forking out for your birthday, yet you still have to go
squeezing more out of two poor, dried-up old gourds like Zhou and Zhao!’
Xi-feng laughed silently.
‘Don’t talk nonsense!’ she whispered back. ‘I’ll settle accounts with you presently,
when we get out of here. Any?way, what do you mean, “poor”? Whenever they’ve
got any money they only pass it straight on to other people. We might just as well
intercept it before it gets into the hands of their creditors and get a bit of pleasure
out of it!’
By the time this whispered exchange was over, the calcula?tions had been completed
and it was announced that the amounts promised totalled a round sum of one
hundred and fifty taels with a few taels left over.
‘That’s more than we could possibly spend on plays and wine in one day,’ said
Grandmother Jia.
‘As we’re not inviting anyone from outside,’ said You-shi, ‘it won’t be a very big
party, either. There should be enough for two or three days. The big saving, of course,
is that now you’ve got your own troupe of players, you can have first-class
entertainment for nothing.’
‘Feng shall have whatever troupe she prefers,’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘That’s for
her to decide.’
‘We’ve heard our own troupe so often,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I think we should spend a bit
of money and get in a troupe from outside.’
‘Well, I propose to leave all the arrangements for this in the hands of Cousin Zhen’s
wife,’ said Grandmother Jia, then Feng will have nothing at all to worry about -
except how to get the greatest possible enjoyment out of her birthday!’
You-shi agreed to be organizer, after which she and the others stayed charting for a
few minutes with Grandmother Jia. Then, realizing that the old lady’s stock of energy
was ex?hausted, they gradually dispersed.
After the three younger women had seen Lady Xing and Lady Wang a part of their
way home, You-shi accompanied Xi-feng to the latter’s apartment to discuss with her
what arrangements she should make for the party.
‘Don’t ask me,’ said Xi-feng when You-shi questioned her. ‘You want to study
Grandmother and just do whatever seems to please her.’
‘You really are the limit, you know,’ said You-shi. ‘For?tune’s darling! I thought just
now that I was being called over about something serious, but it turned out to be just
for this! And then, if you please, quite apart from being asked to pay out money, I am
to have all the worry of arranging everything for you as well. What are you going to
do in return for all this, to show me your gratitude?’
‘What am I going to do in return?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You must be joking. I didn’t call you
over. If you’re afraid of the trouble, you’d better go back to Grandmother and tell her
to give the job to somebody else.’
‘Just look at her I’ said You-shi. ‘Really full of yourself today, aren’t you? I should
hold it in a bit, if I were you, my dear, or it might start running overt’
The two of them conversed for some minutes longer before finally separating.

*

When the first contributions arrived at Ning-guo House next morning, You-shi had
only just got up and was about to begin her toilet. She asked who had brought the
money, and on being informed that it was Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, sent the maid back to
fetch her in from the servants’ quarters, where she was waiting. When she arrived,
You-shi asked for a stool to be brought so that the old woman could sit and talk to
her while she continued with her toilet.
‘How many of the contributions have you got in this packet?’ You-shi asked her.
‘These are the ones from us servants,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘As they were all
ready, I thought I might as well bring them over straight away. The contributions from
Her Old Ladyship and the other ladies are still to come.’
Just then one of the maids came in to announce another arrival
‘The subscriptions from Mrs Xue and Lady Xing have arrived, ma’am.’
‘Subscriptions!’ said You-shi scornfully. ‘How eagerly you fasten on the ridiculous
word! It was only a passing fancy of Her Old Ladyship’s yesterday that we should
imitate what they do in poorer households. She used the word then as a joke; but
now, I suppose, we shall have every witless maid solemnly talking about
“subscriptions” all the time! Well, go and get the money and bring it in then. And
see that who?ever it is has some tea before they go.’
The girl went out and returned with the two packets of money that the messenger
had brought, one from Aunt Xue, including a contribution for Bao-chai, and one,
including Dai-yu’s contribution, from Lady Xing.
‘Who does that leave now?’ said You-shi.
‘That leaves Her Old Ladyship, Her Ladyship, the young ladies and the maids,’ said
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife.
‘What about Mrs Zhu’s?’ said You-shi.
Mrs Lian will be paying Out the money for all the others,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, ‘so
you’ll be able to get Mrs Zhu’s from her too when you see her about the rest.’
You-shi, having completed her toilet, now called for her carriage. As soon as it was
ready, she drove round to the Rong-guo mansion and went straight in to see Xi-feng.
She found her with the money already packeted and on the point of bringing it round
to her.
‘Is it all here?’ You-shi asked her.
‘All there,’ said Xi-feng gaily. ‘Hurry up and take it away. I don’t want to he
responsible for it if it gets lost.’
‘I don’t think I altogether trust you,’ said You-shi, return?ing her smile. ‘I think I’d
like to check it first in your presence.’
She opened up the packet and counted the money contained in it. The contribution
for Li Wan appeared to be missing.
‘I thought you were up to something,’ she said. ‘Why isn’t the money for Wan
here?’
Xi-feng smiled disarmingly.
‘Isn’t what you’ve already got there enough? Surely her little bit isn’t going to make
all that much difference? Why not wait and see what you need? If you find you
haven’t got enough, I’ll give the money for Wan to you later.’
‘I’m not letting you get away with this,’ said You-shi, ‘—playing the Lady Bountiful
yesterday in front of all those others and then going back on it now, when the two of
us are alone together. I shall have to go and ask Lady Jia for the money.’
‘You’re a hard woman!’ said Xi-feng. ‘One of these days when I have you at a
disadvantage, you mustn’t complain if you find me just as much of a stickler.’
‘Threats?’ said You-shi. ‘I think you are the one who should feel afraid. Do you think
if it weren’t for the things you have done for me in the past I would let you off now?
Here, Patience!’—She took Patience’s contribution from the pile and held it out to
her ‘Take this back. If later on I find that I need it, I’ll make it good with my own
money.’
Patience immediately understood what she was getting at and answered in the same
vein.
‘No, Mrs Zhen, you keep it. If you find you have any left over, you can give it back to
me afterwards.’
‘Take it,’ said You-shi. ‘Is your mistress the only one who’s allowed to break the
rules? Mayn’t I do favours too, if I want to?’
Patience was obliged to take the money from her.
‘Seeing your mistress so tight-fisted,’ said You-shi, ‘I often wonder what she’s going
to do with all this money she saves. Take it with her in her coffin?’
With that parting shot she went off to see Grandmother Jia. After greeting the old
lady and exchanging a few generalities, she went into Faithful’s room for a more
serious discussion of arrangements for the birthday party. The ‘discussion’ con?sisted
quite simply in finding out what would give Grand?mother Jia most pleasure and
deciding that that was what they should do. When all had been settled between
them and You?-shi was rising to go, she took out the two taels that Faithful had
contributed and handed them back to her.
‘Here you are. We shan’t be needing this.’
From Grandmother Jia’s apartment she went over to have a few words with Lady
Wang. When Lady Wang presently left her to go into her Buddhist chapel, You-shi
took advant?age of her absence to return Suncloud’s contribution; then, since xi-feng
was safely out of the way, she offered Aunt Zhou and Aunt Zhao their contributions
as well. But the con?cubines were too scared to take them.
‘Go on I’ said You-shi encouragingly. ‘I know how hard-up you are. You can’t afford
to give away money like this. If Feng finds Out, I shall take full responsibility myself.’
They took the money then, voluble in their gratitude.

*

In a twinkling the second of the ninth was upon them. The denizens of the Garden
had been informed that You-shi was planning an impressive variety of entertainment:
not only the customary plays, but also juggling, acrobatics, story-telling by blind
ballad-singers—in short, everything one could possibly think of that might contribute
to the success of the occasion and the pleasure of the participants.
Li Wan reminded the cousins that the second of the month was also one of the
regular meeting-days of the poetry club. Xi-chun was, of course, excused.
‘But why hasn’t Bao-yu turned up?’ she asked. ‘I suppose he’s so intent on enjoying
the film that he has forgotten his former enthusiasm for these more civilized
amusements!—Go and see what he’s doing,’ she said to one of the maids, ‘and tell
him to come here immediately.’
The maid was a long time gone.
‘Miss Aroma says he went out first thing this morning,’ she reported when she
eventually returned.
The others were incredulous.
‘That’s ridiculous. How could he possibly have gone out? The girl must have got the
message wrong.’
They sent Ebony over to ask again; but Ebony only confirmed what the first maid had
said.
‘Yes, lie really has gone out. It seems that one of his friends has died and he’s had
to go out to condole.’
‘That’s absolutely absurd,’ said Tan-chun. ‘Whatever the reason, he can’t possibly
have gone out today. Fetch Aroma here and I’ll speak to her myself.’
As if anticipating a summons, Aroma herself walked in while she was saying this. Li
Wan tackled her at once.
‘There’s absolutely no justification for his going out today, whatever the reason,’
she said. ‘In the first place it’s Mrs Lian’s birthday and Her Old Ladyship was
particularly anxious that we should all join in celebrating it this year: it’s monstrous
that he should go off on his own like this when everyone else from both houses is
here for the celebration. And in the second place this is the first regular meeting of
our poetry club and he hasn’t even asked leave to stay away.’
Aroma sighed miserably.
‘Last night he told me that he had some important business to attend to first thing
this morning. He said he had to go to the Prince of Beijing’s palace, but that he would
be back again as soon as possible. I told him not to go, but he insisted. When he got
up first thing this morning, he asked for a suit of mourning to wear. It looks as if some
important person in the Prince of Beijing’s household must have died.’
‘If that’s really so,’ said Li Wan, ‘then he ought to have gone. But then, on the other
hand, he ought to have got back by now.’
After a brief discussion the cousins decided to proceed without him and to punish
him in some way when he returned. Before they could begin, however, a summons
arrived from Grandmother Jia to join her in the mansion. As soon as they had done
so, Aroma reported Bao-yu’s absence. The old lady was displeased and sent someone
to fetch him back.
Bao-yu, evidently with some secret business on his mind, had spoken the day before
to Tealeaf about this excursion,
‘I have to go out first thing tomorrow,’ he told him. ‘I want you to be waiting for me
outside the back gate with two horses ready saddled. No one else is to accompany
me but you. Tell Li Gui that I am going to the Prince of Beijing’s, and that he must
stop anyone going out to look for me. He can tell them that the Prince is detaining
me and that I shall come back as soon as I can get away.’
Though somewhat mystified by these orders, Tealeaf felt he had no choice but to
follow them out, and before dawn next morning was waiting with two horses ready
saddled outside the tear gate of the Garden. As soon as it was light, Bao-yu, dressed
in heavy mourning, emerged from the postern, leaped onto one of the waiting horses,
and crouching down over the reins, set off at a brisk trot down the street—all
without utter?ing a single word.
Tealeaf leaped onto the second horse, gave it the whip, and did his best to catch up
with Bao-yu, at the same time shouting after him to inquire where they were going.
‘Where does this road lead to?’ Bao-yu asked him.
‘This is the main road to the North Gate,’ said Tealeaf. Outside the city it’s pretty
deserted in that direction. You won’t find much to amuse you there.’
Good,’ said Bao-yu. The more deserted the better.’
And by applying the whip he made his horse shoot on ahead, and presently, after a
couple of turns, had left the city gate behind him.
Tealeaf, more mystified than ever, followed him as closely as he could. When they
had galloped without stopping for two or three miles, in the course of which the
signs of human habitation had gradually grown more and more sparse, Bao-yu finally
reined to a halt and turned back to ask Tealeaf if there was anywhere where they
could purchase some incense.
‘I dare say we could find somewhere,’ said Tealeaf without much conviction. ‘It
depends what kind of incense you want.’
Bao-yu reflected for some moments.
‘Honeybush, sandal and lakawood,’ he said. ‘It has to be those three.’
‘I doubt if you’ll be able to get them,’ said Tealeaf, smiling at the na?veté of one
who could expect to make such purchases in such a place. But when he saw that
Bao-yu was genuinely distressed, he added: What’s it for? I’ve noticed that you often
carry powdered incense in that sachet you wear. Why not see if you’ve got any in
that?’
Bao-yu, glad to be reminded, extracted the silk purse that he wore suspended from
his neck underneath the front fold of his gown, felt inside it with his fingers, and was
delighted to find that there was still a pinch or two of powdered agalloch in the
bottom.
‘Seems a bit lacking in respect to use this though,’ he thought.
‘Still, it’s more respectful to use something I’ve carried all the way here myself than
it would be to use something I’d just bought in a shop.’
Having decided that the powdered incense would do, he asked Tealeaf where he
could get hold of an incense-burner and some fire.
‘Now those we can’t get,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Where could we, out here in the middle of
the wilds? If you knew you were going to need them, why didn’t you tell me
beforehand, and we could have brought them with us?’
‘Stupid idiot I’ said Bao-yu. ‘Do you honestly think we could have ridden out at this
break-neck pace if we’d been carrying an incense-burner full of hot coals with us?’
Tealeaf, after some moments of reflection, smiled uncertainly:
‘I know what we could do, Master, though I don’t know what you’ll think of the
idea. There’s little enough hope of our getting the things you’ve just asked for round
here, and the chances are that even if we could, you’d only start thinking of
something else you needed that was even harder to get. Now if we were to go on for
about another two thirds of a mile in this direction, we should come to the Temple of
the Water Spirit Bao-yu pricked up his ears.
‘The Temple of the Water Spirit? Is that near here? Good. That will do even better.
Let’s go there then.’
With a touch of the whip he was away once more, still talk?ing to Tealeaf over his
shoulder as he rode ahead.
‘The nun at the Water Spirit is one of our regular callers. If I see her when we get
there and tell her we want to use one of her burners, she’s sure to let us.’
‘Even if this wasn’t one of the temples we subscribe to,’ said Tealeaf, ‘I’m sure they
wouldn’t dare refuse if you asked them. But why is it that today you are so willing to
go to the Temple of the Water Spirit when normally you can scarcely abide to hear it
mentioned?’
‘The reason I normally feel that way about it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘is because I hate the
silly, senseless way in which vulgar people offer worship and build temples to gods
they know nothing about. Ignorant old men and women with too much money to
spend hear the name of some god or other—they’ve no idea who it is, but the mere
fact that they’ve heard it from the lips of some ballad-singer or story-teller seems to
them incontrovertible proof of the god’s existence—and go found?ing temples in
which these fictitious deities can he worshipped.
‘Take this Temple of the Water Spirit. The reason it’s called that is because the
divinity worshipped in it is supposed to be the goddess of the river Luo. Now in point
of fact no Goddess of the Luo ever existed. She was an invention of the poet Cao Zhi.
But that didn’t stop a lot of people making an image of her and worshipping it.
‘The only reason I feel differently about this temple today is because the idea of a
water-goddess just happens to fit in with the thing that is at the moment uppermost
in my mind; so I’m glad to make use of it for my own purpose.’
By this time they had reached the gate of the temple. The old nun who kept it, hardly
less surprised to hear of Bao-yu’s arrival than she would have been if she had been
told that a dragon had just fallen, alive and kicking, out of the sky, hur?ried out to
greet him, and ordered the old temple-servant who did duty as a porter to take care
of the horses.
Bao-yu went on inside. Instead of bowing down before the image, however, he stood
and contemplated it appraisingly. Though the goddess was only a thing of wood and
plaster and paint, the sculptor who made her had succeeded in capturing some of
the spirit of Cao Zhi’s famous description. To Bao?-yu’s gazing eyes she did indeed
appear as the poet portrayed her:

             Fluttering like the wing-beats of a startled swan,
             Swaying with the lissome curves of a water-dragon...

Cao Zhi’s beautiful images came crowding into his mind:

             Like a lotus flower emerging from the green water,
             Like the morning sun rising above the mist-bank...

And as he gazed and remembered, the tears coursed down his cheeks.
The old nun now appeared with some tea. While he sipped it, Bao-yu took the
opportunity of asking her if he might borrow an incense-burner. At this she
disappeared once more, to reappear, after considerable delay, carrying not only a
burner but also a whole portion of incense and a set of garishly printed
‘picture-offerings’. Refusing all but the burner, Bao-yu made Tealeaf carry it outside
into the rear courtyard of the temple, where he set about choosing a suitably dean
spot on
which to make his offering. Nowhere would do, however, until Tealeaf suggested
placing the burner on the stone plat?form of the well. To this suggestion Bao-yu
assented with a nod, and when Tealeaf had set down the burner and retired to a
respectful distance, he took out his pinch of agalloch and dropped it on the burning
charcoal; then, with tears in his eyes, he knelt down and made, not a kotow, but the
sort of half-obeisance one makes to the spirit of a junior or a servant.
Having concluded his little ceremony, Bao-yu got up and ordered Tealeaf to take the
burner back into the temple. But Tealeaf, though saying that he would, did nothing of
the kind. Instead he threw himself on his knees, kotowed several times, and began
praying aloud in the direction of the well
‘O spirit, in all the years I have served Master Bao this is the first time he has ever
kept anything from me. But though I don’t know who you are, O spirit, and don’t like
to ask, one thing I do know, and that is that you are sure to be some won?drously
beautiful, clever, refined young female. And since Master Bao isn’t able to tell you
Out loud what he wants of you, I, Tealeaf, am praying to you on his behalf.
‘I beseech you, if you still have feelings as you used to when you were on earth,
watch over my master from time to time, O spirit. I know you belong to a different
world now, but being as it’s for a special friend of yours that I’m asking this, please do
it if you can, spirit, for old time’s sake.
‘And please use what influence you can to see that Master Bao is reborn in his next
life as a girl, so that he can spend all his time with you; and don’t let him be reborn as
one of those horrible Whiskered Males he is always on about.’
At this point he knocked his head several more times on the ground. Bao-yu, who
had been listening, could no longer hold back his laughter. Observing that Tealeaf had
raised him?self once more on all fours and appeared to be about to go on, he kicked
him and told him to get up.
‘Stop this nonsense! If anyone hears you, I shall become a laughing-stock.’
Tealeaf scrambled to his feet, picked up the burner and fol?lowed Bao-yu inside.
‘I’ve already spoken to the nun about getting you some food,’ he told Bao-yu as
they were going in together. ‘I told her you hadn’t eaten yet. You ought to get
something inside you. I realize that you came out here because there’s a big party
and lots of racket at home today and you wanted some?where peaceful where you
could do this. But I think just stay?ing out here in the quiet all day is showing all the
respect you need to this person you’ve just made the offering to. You don’t need to
fast all day as well. That’s out of the question.’
‘That seems reasonable,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As I’m missing the patty all the time that I’m
here, I am in a way abstaining al?ready; so I suppose there can be no harm in my
taking a bit of vegetarian stuff.’
‘I’m glad to hear you say so,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Of course, there is another way of
looking at it. Your going off like this is sure to cause others at home to worry. Now if
no one at home was likely to worry, there’d be no harm in our not going back until
evening. But since they are going to worry, I really think you ought to be getting back
soon. For one thing it will set Their Ladyships’ minds at rest, and for another, it will, in
the long run, be more respectful to this person you’ve just made the offering to.
Because if you go home, even if you drink and watch plays, it won’t be because you
want to, but out of duty to Their Ladyships. Whereas if you stay out here thinking
only about the spirit and not caring how worried you make Their Ladyships, you’ll in
fact be making the spirit herself uneasy to think of all the anxiety that’s being caused
on her behalf. Think it over, Master Bao, and see if you don’t agree with me.’
‘I can see what’s on your mind without much difficulty,’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
‘You’re afraid that as you are the only one who came out here with me, you will bear
all the blame for this outing when we get back. That’s the real reason why I’m being
treated to all this high-minded advice, isn’t it? Well, don’t worry! It was all along my
intention to go back to the party when I had made the offering. I never said anything
about staying out here all day. I’ve discharged my vow. If I hurry home now so that
the others aren’t too worried, it seems to me that my obligations to the dead and the
living swill both be met.’
Tealeaf expressed his relief. Still talking, they made their way to the old nun’s parlour,
or hall of meditation’, where they found she had set out a very presentable (though,
of course, vegetarian) repast for them. After briefly sampling it, the two of them
mounted and set off again along the road by which they had come Bao-yu at such a
pace that Tealeaf was obliged to call out after him to slacken it.
‘Go easy on that horse, Master Bad! He hasn’t been ridden very much; you need to
keep a pretty tight rein on him.’
Soon they had entered the city gate, and not long after-wards might have been seen
slipping into the back gate of the Garden. Bao-yu hurried straight to Green Delights,
which he found deserted except for a few old nannies left behind as care-takers.
‘Holy Name!’ they said, their old faces lighting up with pleasure when they saw
who it was. ‘You’ve come at last! You’ve had Miss Aroma nigh out of her mind with
worry. They’re sitting at table in the front now, Master. Better hurry up and join
them.’
Bao-yu quickly took off his mourning clothes and went off to look for something
more colourful to change into.
‘Where is the party?’ he asked the old women as soon as he had dressed.
‘In the new reception room.’
He hurried, by the shortest route, towards the faint sounds of fluting and singing that
could soon be heard coming from the so-called ‘new’ reception hall that the old
women had referred to. As he approached the gallery through which he must pass to
reach it, he came upon Silver, sitting under the eaves of the covered way and crying.
She left off hurriedly when she saw him coming.
‘Here comes the phoenix at last!’ she said sarcastically. ‘Hurry up and go inside. If
you stay away much longer, there’ll be a riot!’
Bao-yu smiled at her sympathetically.
‘Guess where I’ve been.’
She ignored his question and turned away from him to wipe her eyes. He hurried on,
dejected because of his inability to comfort her. When he entered the hall were the
others were assembled and went up to greet his grandmother and his mother, it
really was as if a phoenix had appeared. Hurriedly he made his birthday kotow to
Xi-feng.
‘What do you mean by going off on your own like that?’ Grandmother Jia grumbled.
‘I never heard of such a thing. If this happens again, I shall tell your father when he
comes back and get him to give you another beating.’
Bao-yu’s pages came in next for her censure.
‘Why do they listen to him - rushing off like that whenever he tells them to? They
should tell us first. Where have you been, anyway?’ she asked him. ‘Have you had
anything to eat? Has anything happened to give you a fright?’
‘The Prince of Beijing’s favourite concubine died yester?day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I went to
condole with him. He was in such a state when I got there that I didn’t like to leave
im?mediately. That’s why I’ve been so long.’
‘If you sneak out again without first telling us,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘I really shall
tell your Pa to beat you.’
Though Bao-yu promised to obey, she still wanted to have his pages whipped; but the
others all begged for a reprieve:
‘Don’t take it to heart, Grandmother! He’s already said he won’t do it again. And
anyway, he’s back now, so we can for?get our worries and concentrate on enjoying
ourselves’
Grandmother Jia had in fact been extremely worried and her anxiety had made her
vengeful. Now that Bao-yu was back and she was no longer worried, her vengeful
feelings evapor?ated and the subject of beatings was quickly dropped. Her concern
now was lest Bao-yu should have been unduly dis?tressed by his visit, or have failed
to eat enough while he was away, or have been involved in some accident on the way
there or back. While she continued to fuss over him, Aroma took her place at his side
to wait upon him, and the rest of the company resumed the play-watching which his
arrival had interrupted.
The play being performed on this occasion was The Wooden Hairpin. Grandmother
Jia and the other ladies found it greatly affecting, shedding copious teats in the
course of it and sighing or cursing in the appropriate places.
The events that ensued will be told in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 44

Xi-feng’s jealousy is the object of an unexpected provocation
And Patience’s toilet is a source of unexpected delight



BAO-YU having now taken his place amongst the girls, they and the rest of the
company were once more able to give their undivided attention to the players.
The play being performed on this occasion was, as we noted at the end of the
previous chapter, The Wooden Hairpin, and it chanced that they had reached that
section of it popularly re?ferred to as ‘The Husband’s Offering’, in which the hero
Wang Shi-peng, believing that his wife has drowned herself, goes with his aged
mother to the river Ou-jiang to make offerings to her soul. At this point Dai-yu, who
was able to guess what the real purpose of Bao-yu’s early-morning excursion had
been, turned to Bao-chai and remarked, in a voice loud enough for Bao-yu to
overhear, that she thought Wang Shi-peng a ‘very silly sort of fellow
‘He could have made his offering anywhere. Why was it necessary for him to go
rushing off to the riverside to make it? They say that “objects aid recall”: well, since
all the water in the world comes ultimately from a single source, a bowlful of it
scooped up anywhere should have sufficed. His feelings could have been just as
effectively relieved by weeping over a bowlful of water as by rushing off to the banks
of the river.’
Bao-chai made no reply. Bao-yu, who had certainly heard her, turned away and called
for hot wine to drink Xi-feng’s health with.
Grandmother Jia was determined that this should be a day like no other and that
Xi-feng should derive the greatest possible enjoyment from it. Not feeling sufficiently
energetic to sit with the rest, however, she had retired to the inner room with Aunt
Xue, reclining on a couch there in a position from which it was still possible to watch
the players. A small selection from the dishes which had covered the two tables laid
for her outside had been set down within easy reach where she could pick at them
while conversing with Aunt Xue. The remainder she had made over to the maids and
older women on duty who had not been catered for, bidding them take their banquet
outside on to the verandah where they could sit down and enjoy themselves without
restraint.
Lady Wang and Lady Xing also sat in this inner room, not on the kang, where
Grandmother Jia’s couch had been placed, but at a high-topped table on the floor
below. The young people sat at a number of tables in the outer room. From time to
time Grandmother Jia would give orders to You-shi to make sure that Xi-feng was
enjoying herself.
‘Make her sit at the head. Why isn’t she sitting at the head? It’s up to you to act as
hostess on my behalf,’ she told You?-shi. ‘The poor child is run off her feet all the rest
of the year. Today I want her to be made a fuss of.’
You-shi went off to do her bidding, but shortly afterwards returned, a smile on her
face, to announce that Xi-feng was being difficult.
‘She says she’s not used to sitting at the head. She says it makes her uncomfortable.
And she refuses to drink anything.’
‘If you can’t make her, I shall have to come out and deal with her myself,’ said
Grandmother Jia, laughing.
This brought Xi-feng herself running up. She spoke to Grandmother Jia from behind
You-shi’s shoulder.
‘Don’t believe her, Grannie. I’ve had lots and lots to drink.’
‘Now look here,’ said Grandmother Jia to You-shi, ‘I want you to march this young
woman back to her seat and force her to sit down in it. Then I want every one of you
here to drink with her in turn. If she still refuses, I really and truly shall come out and
deal with her myself.’
You-shi hauled Xi-feng out again, cal1ed for larger cups to be brought, and poured
her out some wine.
There you are, my darling! In token of my appreciation of the noble way in which you
have served Lady Jia and Lady Wang and me during the past year, please accept this
cup of wine that I have poured out for you with my own fair hand!’
‘If you are really serious about wanting to show me your appreciation,’ said Xi-feng,
‘you ought to offer it to me kneel?ing down.’
‘Just listen to that!’ said You-shi. ‘I’ll tell you something, my girl you just don’t
realize how lucky you are. For all you know, things may never be as good as this for
you again. If I were you, I’d have a good booze-up while you can. Come on, two cups!’
You-shi was so insistent that in the end Xi-feng had to drink two whole cupfuls from
the larger cups. After that the cousins came up one by one to drink with her, which
meant that she had to take at least a sip or two with each of them. Then old Mrs Lai,
observing with what high spirits Grand-mother Jia was watching these antics,
determined to join in the fun too, and came over, with the other old nannies, to drink
Xi-feng’s health along with all the rest. Because of the seniority of this group, it
would have been difficult for Xi-eng to refuse them, so with each of them too she
had to take a couple of sips. But when Faithful and the maids came trooping up, it
was more than flesh and blood could bear and she begged to be excused.
Really, my dears, I couldn’t. Let me put it off until to?morrow.’
Faithful pretended to take umbrage.
‘I call that most insulting! Even Her Ladyship treats me with more consideration. I
used to think that I counted for something round here, but now, after being put in my
place in front of all these others, I can see that I did wrong to come. Well, if you
won’t drink, I’m going!’
She turned away and began marching out, but Xi-feng ran after and detained her.
‘No, please! I’ll drink,’
She fetched the wine herself, filled a cup to the brim with it’ and drank it down to the
last drop, up-ending it afterwards to show that it was dry. At that Faithful laughed
and went away content.
As soon as she had resumed her seat, Xi-feng knew that she had drunk too much. Her
heart was pounding in her throat and she felt an overwhelming desire to go back
home and lie down. But the leader of the jugglers was bearing down on her.
‘Give this man his money,’ she said, turning to You-shi, ‘I have to go home to wash.’
You-shi nodded, and Xi-feng, choosing a moment when no one was looking, slipped
outside and made her way along the outside of the hall under the shadow of the
eaves. Patience, who had seen her go and was concerned about her, hurried after
and gave her some support.
As they approached the passage-way which led from Grand?mother Jia’s rear
courtyard to the gallery in the midst of the little enclosure surrounded by wails and
buildings which had once been the scene of Jia Rui’s night-long sufferings, they
recognized one of the junior maids from their own apartment standing there, who, as
soon as she caught sight of them, turned tail and ran, Xi-feng at once became
suspicious and called out after her. The little maid at first pretended not to hear, but
when the shouting behind her continued, could no longer keep up the pretence and
had to turn about and face them.
Xi-feng’s suspicions were now thoroughly aroused. Ad?vancing into the gallery and
calling the maid back into it, she first made Patience close the partitions, so that they
were com?pletely cut off from the outside, then, seating herself on the gallery’s
stone plinth and ordering the maid to kneel down in front of her, she told Patience in
a fierce, loud voice to fetch two pages from the inner gate with a rope and whips to
‘flog to a jelly’ this abominable creature who had so little regard for the presence of
her mistress. The wretched girl, already half-dead with fright, now wept for terror
and knocked her head repeatedly on the ground, entreating Xi-feng for mercy.
‘I’m not a ghost,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’re supposed to stand still and wait when you see
me coming. What do you mean by running away from me like that?’
‘I didn’t see you at first, ma’am,’ said the little girl tearfully. ‘I was running because
I’d just remembered that there was no one at home to look after things.’
‘If there’s no one at home, you had no business to go out in the first place,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘And even if you didn’t see me, you must have heard me calling you. Patience
and I shouted to you at the tops of our voices ten or a dozen times, but you only ran
the faster. We weren’t all that far away from you, either, and you certainly aren’t deaf.
How dare you lie to me!’
She raised her hand and dealt the girl a slap on the cheek that made her reel, quickly
followed by a second slap on the other cheek. An angry red patch swelled up
instantly on either side of the girl’s face.
‘Don’t, madam. You’ll hurt your hand,’ Patience pleaded.
‘Hit her for me, then,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and ask her why she ran away. If she still won’t
talk, tear her lips!’
At first the maid tried sticking to her story, but when she heard that Xi-feng was going
to heat an iron red-hot and burn her mouth with it, she broke down and tearfully
confessed that Jia Lian was at home and had stationed her in the passage-way to look
out for her mistress and give him warning of her coming; hut as Xi-feng had left the
party so much earlier than expected, she had been taken unawares.
This seemed to Xi-feng to have the ring of truth about it.
‘Why did he ask you to look out for me?’ she asked. ‘Surely I’m allowed to go back
to my own room? There must have been a reason. Tell me. If you do, from now on I
shall love you and be your friend. But if you don’t, I shall take a knife and cut your
flesh with it!’
To reinforce her threat, she plucked a formidable hairpin from her hair and jabbed it
violently in the neighbourhood of the girl’s mouth, causing her to dodge this way and
that from it in terror.
‘I’ll tell, madam, I’ll tell. Only please don’t let him know that it was me that told
you,’ she wept and implored.
Patience begged Xi-feng not to hurt the girl, at the same time urging the girl to make
a clean breast of what she had to say. The story then came out.
‘Mr Lian came in a while ago and had a bit of a nap. When he woke up, he sent
someone to see what you were doing. They brought word back that your birthday
party had only just started and you wouldn’t be back for ages, so he opened the
chest and took out two pieces of silver and two hairpins and two lengths of satin and
told me to go and give them in secret to Bao Er’s missus and tell her to come over. So
then she came over to our room and Mr Lian made me go and wait in the passage
here and look out for you. And that’s really all I know.’
Xi-feng was by now shaking all over with anger. She pulled herself to her feet
notwithstanding and strode off swiftly towards the house. As she approached the
gateway of the court?yard, another little maid popped her head out but quickly drew
it in again and ran when she saw that it was Xi-feng. When Xi-feng called to her by
name, however, this maid, being more quick-witted than the other one, neither went
on retreating nor stood still, but simply turned about and came running up to Xi-feng
outside, an obsequious little smile upon her face.
‘Oh madam, I was just going over to tell you when I saw you coming here yourself.’
‘Tell me what?’ said Xi-feng.
The girl then proceeded to relate voluntarily what the other girl had just told under
duress.
Xi-feng spat contemptuously.
‘You’ve left it a bit late, haven’t you—waiting until you see me and then trying to
act the innocent?’
She raised her hand and struck the girl a blow that sent her staggering, then,
tiptoeing across the courtyard, applied her ear to the window to hear what was going
on inside.
The first thing she heard was a laugh and a woman’s voice.
‘The best thing that could happen to you,’ it was saying, ‘would be if that hell-cat
wife of yours was to die.’
‘Suppose she did,’ Jia Lian’s voice said in answer, ‘and I married another one who
turned out to be just as bad?’
‘If she was to die,’ said the first voice, ‘you ought to make Patience your Number
One. I’m sure she’d be better than this one.’
‘Patience won’t let me come near her nowadays,’ said Jia Lian. ‘She has a lot to put
up with, the same as me, that she doesn’t dare talk about. I don’t know, I reckon I
must have been born under a hen-pecked husbands’ star!’
Xi-feng heard this shaking with fury. The couple’s praise of Patience made her at once
suspect that Patience had been com?plaining about her behind her back. The fumes
of wine mounted up inside her, clouding her judgement. Without pausing to reflect,
she turned and struck Patience twice before kicking open the door and striding into
the room. There, without more ado, she proceeded to seize hold of Bao Er’s wife and
belabour her, breaking off only to block the doorway with her body in case Jia Lian
might think of escaping.
‘Filthy whore!’ she shouted. ‘Stealing a husband isn’t enough for you, it seems. You
have to murder his wife as well!’ She turned to Patience: ‘Go on, Patience, your place
is over there with them—with that whoremaster of yours and his other whore!
You’re all three in this together. You hate me just as much as they do under that
smarmy outside of yours I’
This was followed by several blows.
Poor Patience, overwhelmed by so much injustice, had only Bao Er’s wife on whom
she could vent her feelings.
‘If you have to do these shameful things,’ she said, ‘you might at least leave me out
of it.’ And she began to pummel the woman in her turn.
Now Jia Lian had had a good deal to drink that day, and because of the euphoric state
he was in, had taken insufficient precautions against surprise. Xi-feng’s unexpected
arrival had therefore left him completely at a loss. But Patience’s outburst was
another matter. The wine he had drunk rekindled his for?gotten valour; and whereas
the anger and shame he felt at seeing Xi-feng beat Bao Er’s wife had rendered him
speech?less, the sight of Patience doing the same thing so roused his valiancy that he
shouted at her and gave her a kick.
‘Little whore! You want to join in too, do you?’
Patience, whose gentle nature was easily overawed, at once left off, tearfully
protesting that it was cruel of them to speak about her in such a way behind her
back.
Xi-feng, furious that Patience should be afraid of Jia Lian, rushed over and began
striking her again, insisting that she should go on beating Bao Er’s wife and take no
notice of him. Finding herself thus attacked on both sides simultaneously by the pair
of them, Patience became so desperate that she dashed from the room, vowing that
she would find a knife and kill herself, and would undoubtedly have done herself an
injury if the maids and nannies from outside had not seized her and gradually talked
her out of it.
Xi-feng’s reaction when Patience dashed off threatening suicide was to ram her head
into Jia Lian’s chest and shout hysterically.
‘You’re all in league against me, and now you’re trying to frighten me because I
overheard you. I don’t care. Kill me! Strangle me!’
Jia Lian, in a fury, snatched a sword down from the wall and drew it from its
scabbard.
‘There’s no need for any of you to talk about suicide. I’m desperate too. I’ll kill the
lot of you and swing for it. That’ll make a clean end of the business!’
Just as the rumpus was at its height, You-shi arrived with a crowd of others.
‘What on earth is happening? A moment ago everyone was enjoying themselves,
and now here you all are shouting at each other!’
With the arrival of this audience Jia Lian pretended to be even drunker than he really
was, striking a fiercely threatening attitude and behaving as if he was seriously
intending to kill Xi-feng with his sword. Xi-feng, on the other hand, dropped me
shrewishness she had up to then been showing as soon as she saw them come and,
breaking quickly away, ran weeping to Grandmother Jia.
The play had already ended when Xi-feng burst in upon the aged matriarch and flung
herself trembling upon her bosom.
‘Save me, Grannie, save me! Mr Lian is going to kill me!’
‘What?’ cried Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing and Lady Wang in startled simultaneity.
‘When I went home just now to change my clothes,’ Xi-feng tearfully related, ‘I was
surprised to hear Mr Lian indoors talking to somebody. I was scared to go in straight
away, thinking it must be a guest, so I listened for a while outside the window. Then I
found that it wasn’t a guest that he was with but Bao Er’s wife, and they were saying
what a tyrant I was and planning to poison me so that he could marry Patience. I
became very angry then; but I didn’t want to make a scene with him. I struck
Patience a couple of times. All I did to him was ask him why he should want to kill me,
but he was so much put out by that that be tried to murder me on the spot.’
Grandmother Jia, believing this farrago to be true, was naturally appalled.
‘How dreadful! Bring the wretch here at once!’
But before the words were out of her mouth, Jia Lian him-self came running in,
sword in hand, with a crowd pursuing at his heels.
Grandmother Jia had always treated Jia Lian and Xi-feng with indulgence, and on this
occasion Jia Lian seemed to think that he could presume on this to riot in her
presence with impunity, totally disregarding the fact that his mother and aunt were
there as well. This deliberate flouting of their authority by a licensed favourite greatly
incensed the two ladies. They seized hold of him with angry scoldings, one on either
side.
‘Disgusting creature! Have you no sense of decency left whatever? Can’t you see
that Grandmother is here?’
‘It’s because Grandmother spoils her so much that she has become the way she is,’
said Jia Lian, leering at them through bloodshot eyes.
Lady Xing, having at last succeeded in wresting the sw6rd from his grasp, shouted at
him fiercely.
‘Get out of here at once!’
But Jia Lian remained where he was and went on talking and talking in the same
leering, disgusting manner, like a little boy who expects his naughtiness to be
admired. Grand?mother Jia, in a voice which shook with anger, uttered the only
threat that she knew would shift him.
‘I realize that we count for nothing with you. Fetch his father, some one, and see if
he’ll go then.’
At that Jia Lian finally shambled out. Sulkily avoiding the conjugal apartment, he took
himself off to his study outside.
After he had gone, Lady Xing and Lady Wang turned on Xi-feng and began scolding
her; but Grandmother Jia did what she could to comfort her by dismissing the
incident as unimportant.
‘Young men of his age are like hungry pussy-cats, my dear. There’s simply no way of
holding them. This sort of thing has always happened in big families like
ours—certainly ever since I can remember. It’s all my fault, anyway. I shouldn’t have
made you drink so much wine. It’s all turned to vinegar inside you.’
This made everyone laugh.
‘Don’t worry,’ she went on.’ I’ll see that he apologizes to you tomorrow. Just for
tonight, though, so as not to put him too much out of countenance, I think you had
better stay away from him.’
Her voice became harsher when she remembered Patience.
‘Little wretch! I always thought she seemed such a nice girl. To think that
underneath it all she should have been so wicked!’
You-shi laughed.
‘There’s nothing wrong with Patience. She just happened to be the person nearest
at hand for Feng to work off her spleen on. When Feng and Lian are angry with one
another, they both take it out on Patience. The poor girl is terribly unjustly treated.
Don’t you go taking sides against her as well!’
‘Oh well, that’s all right;’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I must say, she never struck me as
a wily seductress. In that case, of course, I’m sorry for the poor child—bearing the
brunt of it all when she is the innocent party.’
She called Amber to her.
‘Amber, I want you to take a message to Patience for me. Tell her—and I want you
to make it quite clear that the mes?sage comes from me personally—that I know she
has been unjustly treated and I shall make her mistress apologize to her tomorrow.
Only tell her not to make a fuss about it today, because it is her mistress’s birthday.’
*

Patience was at this time in Prospect Garden, whither she had been carried off at the
earliest opportunity by Li Wan and where, as soon as they were indoors, she had
collapse in a sobbing heap, resisting all attempts at lifting her. Bao-chai tried
reasoning with her.
‘Come, Patience, you are an intelligent girl. Think how well your mistress treats you
normally. Just because she’s got a bit drunk today and taken it out on you—why, it
shows how close you are to each other! You wouldn’t want her to take it out on
anyone else, would you? Everyone else is laughing at her for being such a drunken
silly. If you alone insist on—taking it so tragically, it will begin to look as if your
reputation for good sense was undeserved.’
Just then Amber came in with the message from Grand?mother Jia, and Patience,
conscious of the aura of prestige it gave her, began gradually to perk up a bit. She
remained in the Garden, however, and made no attempt to return to her mistress.
After she had sat with Patience and rested for a while, Li Wan, together with Bao-chai
and the rest of the girls, went back to see Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng, whereupon
Bao-yu invited Patience over to Green Delights. Aroma gave her an enthusiastic
welcome.
‘I’d like to have asked you here in the first place, but I saw that Mrs Zhu and the
young ladies were taking care of you, so I didn’t like to interfere.’
Patience’s face was smiling as she thanked her, but fell again almost immediately.
‘I can’t understand it, I really can’t. I’d done absolutely nothing to deserve such
treatment.’
‘Oh, it was a passing fit of anger,’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t suppose Mrs Lian knew what
she was doing. Look how well she treats you normally.’
‘I wasn’t thinking so much of Mrs Lian,’ said Patience. ‘It’s what that hateful woman
said. Why should she want to amuse herself at my expense? And then for that stupid
master of mine to go and beat me—!’
Once more the sense of injustice overcame her and she could not restrain her tears.
‘Don’t be upset, Patience!’ said Bao-yu consolingly. ‘I offer you an apology on their
behalf’
Patience laughed.
‘It has nothing to do with you.’
‘We’re all cousins,’ said Bao-yu. ‘What one of us does concerns all the others. If
they have done you an injury, it’s up to me to apologize.’
He turned his attention to her appearance.
‘What a pity! You’ve made your new dress all damp. Aroma’s dresses are in here.
Why don’t you change into one of hers, then you can spray some samshoo on this
one and iron it? You’ll need to do your hair again as well.’
He called to the junior maids to fetch water for washing and heat a flat-iron.
Up to this moment Patience had known only by hearsay of the remarkable
understanding shown by Bao-yu in his deal?ings with girls. He had deliberately kept
away from her in the past, knowing her to be Xi-feng’s confidante and (he sup?posed)
Jia Lian’s cherished concubine. It had indeed been a source of frequent regret to him
that he had been unable to show her how much he admired her. Seeing him like this
for the first time, Patience reflected on the truth of what she bad heard.
‘He really has thought of everything,’ she told herself, as she watched Aroma open
up a large chest—specially for her and select two scarcely worn garments from it for
her to change into. Then, since the water had already arrived, she took off her own
dress and skirt and quickly washed her face. Bao-yu, who stood by smiling while she
washed, now urged her to put on some make-up.
‘If you don’t, it will look as if you are sulking,’ he said ‘After all, it is Feng’s birthday,
and Grandma did specially send someone to cheer you up.’
Inwardly acknowledging the reasonableness of this advice, Patience looked round her
for some powder, but could not see any, whereupon Bao-yu darted over to the
dressing-table and removed the lid from a box of Early Ming blue-and-white
porcelain in which reposed the head of a white day my with five compact, stick like
buds on either side of the stem. Pinch?ing off one of these novel powder-containers,
he handed it to Patience.
‘There you are. This isn’t ceruse, it’s a powder made by crushing the seeds of
garden-jalap and mixing them with per?fume.’
Patience emptied the contents of the tiny phial on to her palm. All the qualities
required by the most expert perfumers were there: lightness, whiteness with just the
faintest tinge of rosiness, and fragrance. It spread smoothly and cleanly on the skin,
imparting to it a soft bloom -that was quite unlike the harsh and somewhat livid
whiteness associated with lead-based powders.
Then the rouge, too, was different—not in the usual sheets or tissues, but a tiny
white-jade box filled with a crimson substance that looked like comfiture of roses.
‘This is made from safflower, the same as ordinary rouge,’ Bao-yu explained to her,
‘only the stuff they sell in the shops is impure and its colour is inferior. This is made
by squeezing the juice from the best quality safflower, carefully extracting all the
impurities, mixing it with rose water, and then further purifying it by distillation. It’s
so concentrated that you need only a dab of it on the end of a hairpin to do your lips
with and still have enough left over to dilute with water in the palms of your hands
for using on your cheeks.’
Following his directions, Patience found that her com?plexion had acquired a radiant
freshness that she had never seen in it before. At the same time her whole face
seemed to be bathed in the most delectable perfume.
Using a pair of bamboo scissors, Bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of
an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in Patience’s
hair.
At that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to Li Wan’s place and she
had to leave him in a hurry.
Never before had Bao-yu been able to have Patience actually with him so that he
could do things for her. She was such a superior sort of girl, so handsome, so
intelligent, so different from the average run of common, insensitive creatures. His
previous inability to serve her had been a source of deep regret.
Today was—or would have been if -she had lived—Golden’s birthday, and for this
reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning. The row which bad broken
out later in the day between Xi-feng and Jia Lian had proved a godsend. It had at last
given him an opportunity of showing Patience something of what he felt for her. This
was an unlooked-for happiness he might otherwise have waited a lifetime for in vain.
He stretched himself out on his bed in a pleasurable glow of satisfaction.
These pleasant feelings were soon marred by the reflection that a coarse sensualist
like Jia Lian who never considered anything but his own pleasure would certainly
know nothing about the scientific preparation of cosmetics. He thought of Patience
serving that precious couple, alone in the world without parents or brothers and
sisters to defend her, some?how contriving to steer an even course between Jia Lian’s
boorishness on the one hand and Xi-feng’s vindictiveness on the other, yet today, in
spite of all her efforts, falling a victim to their cruelty. Truly her lot was an unhappy
one -mote unhappy even than Dai-yu’s!
At this point in his reflections he became so upset that he began to shed tears, not
bothering on this occasion to restrain them, because Aroma was not there to
disapprove. Getting up from his bed, he went over to inspect Patience’s dress. The
samshoo that had been sprayed on it was now neatly dry. He picked up the iron,
ironed the dress for her, and neatly folded it. Then he noticed that she had left her
handkerchief behind. As it was still marked with tear-stains, he washed it out in the
water she had used for her face and hung it up to dry. Feeling a strange sensation in
which sadness and happiness commingled, he mused for some minutes in silence
before going over to Sweet-rice Village to join the others. He remained there a long
while talking. The lamps had already been lit when he returned.

*

As Patience spent that night at Li Wan’s place and Xi-feng slept with Grandmother Jia,
Jia Lian returned to his room in the evening to find it gloomy and deserted. Not
caring to call for anyone, however, he managed for himself as hest he could and
spent the night there alone. On waking next morning he felt nothing but revulsion
and remorse when he remembered what had happened. His mother, Lady Xing, still
worrying about the drunken exhibition he had made of himself the day before, came
hurrying over first thing to urge him to go with her to see Grandmother Jia. This,
despite the most acute feelings of shame and embarrassment, he now had to do.
‘Well?’ the old lady asked him, when he knelt before her.
‘I had too much to drink yesterday, Grandmother, and I’m afraid I broke in on you
and made a scene. I’ve come here now to apologize.’
Grandmother Jia snorted.
‘Disgusting wretch! If you must go filling yourself with liquor, why can’t you lie
down quietly and sleep it off like a good, sensible creature? Fancy knocking your own
wife about! Feng can normally hold her own against anyone—she’s a regular little
Tyrant King as a rule—but yesterday you’d reduced the poor child to a state of terror.
Suppose I hadn’t been here to protect her and you really had done her an injury,
what would you have had to say for yourself then, I wonder?’
Though smarting under the ludicrous injustice of what she had just said, Jia Lian
knew that he was in no position to argue, and humbly acknowledged his guilt.
‘I should have thought that a couple of beauties like Feng and Patience would have
been enough for you,’ she went on. ‘Why you should need to be forever sniffing after
other skirts and bringing all this disgusting rag-tag and bob-tail back to your own
room, I just do not understand. Fancy beating your own wife and your chamber-wife
for a creature like that! And you a gentleman and member of a distinguished family!
You ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourself. if you have any consideration for my
feelings at all, you’ll get up off the floor now— because you are forgiven as far as I
am concerned—and you’ll apologize handsomely to that poor wife of yours and take
her back home with you. Otherwise you can just take yourself off, for I shan’t accept
your kotow!’
Jia Lian turned and looked at Xi-feng, standing at his grandmother’s side. She was
wearing none of her finery today, her eyes were swollen with weeping, and her face,
pinched and yellow without its make-up, was pathetic and somehow more appealing
than usual.
‘I suppose I’d better apologize,’ .he thought. ‘It will help to patch things up between
us; and it will please the old lady.’
Having so resolved, he looked up at Grandmother Jia with a smile.
‘If that’s what you want, Grandmother, I daren’t disobey you. But it’s going to make
her even more willful than before.’
‘Nonsense I’ said Grandmother Jia, though not ill-humoredly. ‘I know for a fact that
she is a model of wifely behaviour. I am sure she would be quite incapable of
deliber?ately giving offence. If she does ever give you any trouble, I shall see to it
myself that she submits to your authority.’
Jia Lian got to his feet then, and clasping his hands in front of him, made a low bow
to his wife.
‘It was all my fault, Mrs Lian. Please forgive me.’
This was said in so droll a manner that everyone burst out laughing.
‘Now you’re not to be angry any more, Feng,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘or I shall be
angry with you!’
She ordered someone to fetch Patience, and told Jia Lian and Xi-feng that she would
now expect them to make it up with her.
When Jia Lian saw Patience, he was even more ready to pocket his pride for her than
he had been for Xi-feng.

                      There’s no wife like a chamber-wife

as the saying goes, and before anyone else could say a word, he had bounded up to
her and began apologizing.
‘You were very badly treated yesterday, Patience. It was all my fault. It was because
of me that Mrs Lian was so beastly to you. Apart from offering you my own apology,
I’d like to apologize on her behalf as well.’
He clasped his hands again and bowed, once more provok?ing Grandmother Jia to
laughter. This time Xi-feng laughed, too.
Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng that it was now her turn; but before she could do
anything, Patience rushed up to her, threw herself at her feet and kotowed.
‘I made you angry on your birthday, madam. I shall never forgive myself.’
Xi-feng was already feeling remorseful that in her previous day’s drunkenness she
had so far forgotten herself as to humiliate Patience, in spite of all they had always
meant to each other, because of a mere chance-heard remark. Seeing her now so
generous and so lacking in resentment, she was both ashamed and deeply touched.
There were tears on her cheeks as she bent down and raised the girl to her feet.
‘In all the years I’ve served you,’ said Patience, ‘you’ve never laid so much as a
finger on me before. I bear you ‘no grudge for striking me yesterday, madam. It was
all that wicked woman’s doing. I don’t blame you in the least for losing your temper.’
She, too, was crying while she said this.
‘See the three of them back to their room now,’ said Grandmother Jia to her
women. ‘And if you hear another’ word about this, let me know straight away who
said it. I don’t care who it is, I shall take a stick to them myself!’
The three of them now kotowed to Grandmother Jia, to Lady Xing and to Lady Wang;
then the old nannies, bidden once mote to escort them, stepped forward with cries
of obedience and conducted them back to their room.
As soon as the three of them were alone together, Xi-feng started on Jia Lian.
‘Am I really such a hell-cat? Are you really so terribly hen?pecked? When that
woman wished me dead, you agreed with her. Surely I can’t be all that bad? Surely I
must have some good days, even if it’s only one in a thousand? You’ve made it seem
as if I’m worse even than that worthless whore. How can I have the face to go on
living now?’
She began to cry again.
‘Aren’t you satisfied yet?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Just think a bit: who was most to blame
yesterday? Yet today I was the one who had to kneel down in front of everyone and
apologize. You’ve come out of this pretty well. So what are you yammering at me
now for? Do you want me to kneel down again? Here? It doesn’t do to be too greedy,
you know.’
Xi-feng, unable to think of a reply to this, fell silent. Patience giggled.
‘There, it’s all over!’ said Jia Lian, laughing himself. ‘It’s no good. I just can’t help
myself.’
Just then a woman came to the door to report.
‘Bao Er’s wife has hanged herself.’
Jia Lian and Xi-feng were both profoundly shocked; but the look of fear on Xi-feng’s
face was of only momentary duration.
‘Well,’ she said harshly, ‘what of it? Why make such a fuss about it?’
Shortly after this Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife came in and spoke to Xi-feng on the side.
‘Bao Er’s -wife has hanged herself. Her family are talking about taking it to court.’
Xi-feng laughed scornfully.
‘Good! I was thinking of doing the same thing myself.’
‘I’ve just been trying to talk them out of it,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘I tried
frightening them a bit to start with, then I promised them some money if they would
drop it. They seemed to be willing.’
‘I’ve got no money to give them,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and I wouldn’t give it to them if I had.
Let them go ahead and sue. I don’t want you to talk them out of it, or to try
frightening them out of it either. Just let them go ahead and sue. If they lose their
case, I shall bring a suit against them for ex morte blackmail!’
As she stood there in some perplexity to know what to do, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife noticed
that Jia Lian was signaling to her with his eyes. She understood his meaning and went
off to wait for him outside.
Jia Lian followed soon after.
‘I’m just going out to have a look—see what’s going on,’ he said on his way out.
‘You’re not to give them any money I’ Xi-feng shouted after him.
Jia Lian went straight off to discuss the matter with Lin Zhi-xiao himself. As a result of
their discussion, someone was sent to haggle -with the family and promise whatever
seemed necessary, and the family eventually agreed to keep quiet in return for a
payment of two hundred taels ‘towards funeral expenses’. Terrified that they might
change their minds, Jia Lian sent someone to talk to the local magistrate and invited
the police inspector and two or three of the constables in to ‘help with the funeral’.
Seeing the way things were, the family now dared not pursue the matter any further
even if they wanted to, and were obliged to digest in silence whatever they might
feel of grief or anger.
Jia Lian told Lin Zhi-xiao to account for the two hundred taels by adding a bit here
and a bit there on to various items in the Current Expenses account. He also slipped
Bao Er some money of his own and consoled him with a promise that he would pick a
good wife for him at the earliest opportunity to replace the one he had just lost.
Flattered by all the attention he was receiving and grateful for the money, Bao Er was
only too willing to do as he was told and continued to serve Jia Lian with no less
devotion than before. But that is no part of our story.
Whatever internal uneasiness Xi-feng may have felt about these developments,
outwardly she affected complete in?difference. Finding herself alone with Patience
when Jia Lian had gone, she smilingly inquired after her injuries.
I was terribly drunk yesterday,’ she said. ‘I hope you won’t hold it against me, what I
did then. Where did I hit you? Let me have a look.’
‘You didn’t hit me very hard,’ said Patience.
Just at that moment they were interrupted by an announcement from outside.
‘Mrs Zhu and the young ladies are here.’
If you want to know what they had come for, you will have to read the following
chapter.

CHAPTER.45

Sisterly understanding finds expression in words of
sisterly frankness
And autumnal pluviousness is celebrated in verses of
autumnal melancholy



As we were saying at the end of the last chapter, Xi-feng had just begun expressing
her concern for Patience when Li Wan and the cousins walked in. She broke off and
invited them to be seated, and Patience went round and served them all with tea.
‘What a crowd!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Anyone would think I’d sent out an invitation for
something I’
‘There are two things we wanted to see you about,’ said Tan-chun. ‘One is my affair;
the other concerns Xi-chun but also includes instructions from Grandmother.’
‘They must be very important things for a turn-out like this,’ said Xi-feng.
‘We started a poetry club recently,’ said Tan-chun, ‘and the very first time we had a
regular meeting, somebody didn’t turn up. As the rest of us are too soft to apply the
rules our?selves, we want to invite you, as someone we could trust to apply them for
us with iron impartiality, to be our Disciplinary Officer. That’s the first thing. The
second thing concerns this painting of the Garden that Xi-chun has been asked to do.
There are all sorts of things she’ll need for it that she hasn’t got. We spoke to
Grandmother about it and she said that there might still be some things that would
do in the downstairs store-room at the back. She said we ought to have a look, and if
there are, we can use them. Otherwise, anything we haven’t got ourselves we should
send outside for and buy.’
‘I know nothing about poetry,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I couldn’t compose a poem to save my
life. I could come along to eat and drink with you if you like.’
‘You wouldn’t have to compose poems,’ said Tan-chum ‘That’s not what we want
you for. All you have to do is keep an eye on the rest of us, and if you find anyone
slacking or playing truant, decide how they ought to be punished.’
‘Don’t try to fool me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve already guessed. It’s not iron impartiality
you’re after, it’s financial backing. If you’ve got a club, you’re sure to have some
arrangement for taking it in turns to pay the bill, and as you’re short of money,
you’ve thought of this as a means of roping me in so that you can get some out of me.
That’s the real reason for your invita?tion, isn’t it?’
The others laughed.
‘Too bad! You’ve guessed.’
‘You’re like the original Crystal Man, Feng,’ said Li Wan.

                 ‘A heart of crystal in a body of glass.
You can see through everything!’
‘Fancy!’ said Xi-feng, mockingly. ‘The respected elder sister-in-law! The one who’s
put in charge of these young ladies to guide their studies and teach them needlework
and good manners! You encourage them to start a poetry dub, but as soon as the
question of money arises (and incidentally, how much money is involved?—it can’t
surely be very much), you’re not interested: it has nothing to do with you! Now, you
have a monthly allowance of ten taels. Excluding Grand?mother and Aunt Wang -
and they are, after all, ladies of rank and title—that’s twice as much as any of the rest
of us gets. Yet Grandma and Auntie go on about how poor you are: “poor young
widow I” “no means of her own!,’ Oh yes, and be-cause you’ve got a son, you get
another ten taels a month on top of that, which actually makes you equal with
Grandma and Auntie Wang. And you’ve got your land in the Garden, the best plot
there. It’s down in the tithe-book for the highest tithing. And you haven’t got a big
establishment. I doubt there are ten of you there altogether, counting you and Lan
and all the servants, so your outgoings can’t come to very much. And in any case
your food and clothing is all found out of common funds. If one were to add it all up
together, I think your real income must be somewhere in the region of four or five
hundred taels a year. Even if you were to spend one or two hundred a year out of
that on amusements for the girls like this poetry thing, it wouldn’t be for many years.
Another year or two from now and they’ll all be getting mar?ried. And it’s not as if
you were saving up for their dowries, either. That’s hardly likely to be your
responsibility. No, you’re frightened of spending that money of yours, that’s why
you’ve set these girls on to me. I’m supposed to go along like an innocent and eat
and drink myself silly so that next day I can be made to foot the bill. That’s your little
game, isn’t it?’
‘Listen to her, all of you!’ said Li Wan, laughing. ‘I make a single, inoffensive remark
to her, and in return I get this cart-load of ill-bred’ abuse! Really, Feng, what a
mercenary creature you are! You’re just like one of those muddy-legged wretches
who stand haggling in the market-place with a little abacus up one sleeve to do their
calculations on. It’s a good job you were born a girl and brought up in an educated,
upper-class family and that you married into a family of the same sort. If you’d been
born a boy and your family had been poor and un?educated people, I dread to think
what sort of a calculating monster you would have grown up into! Everyone in the
world has to become the object of your calculations. Yester?day it was Patience’s
turn. It’s a wonder you have arms to strike her with, for I’m sure it was a dog’s
stomach you poured all that wine into. None but a dog would have turned on
Patience the way you did. I tell you, I was so angry, I felt like coming straight over and
giving you a piece of my mind. Then I thought it over for a bit and decided not to.
After all, it was your birthday, and as we know, “every dog must have his day”. Also I
was afraid that if I made a fuss I might upset Grandmother. And because I didn’t have
it out with you yesterday, I was still feeling angry about it when I came here to see
you just now. Yet you have the gall to start on me—you who aren’t worthy to pick up
Patience’s shoes! You ought to change places, you two. I’m sure Patience would make
the better mistress.’

It made the girls laugh to hear Li Wan speaking with such unaccustomed heat.
‘Oh, now I understand!’ said Xi-feng, joining in their laughter. ‘It wasn’t about
poetry or painting that you came to see me: it was revenge for Patience you were
after. I didn’t realize that she had so powerful a protector. Now that I do, I shall never
dare to strike her again—not if all the devils in hell are tugging at my elbow! Here,
Patience! Miss Patience! Let me apologize to you in front of Mrs Zhu and the young
ladies. I “did evil in my cups”. Please forgive me.’
The others laughed.
‘There you are!’ said Li Wan to Patience. ‘I told you I’d stick up for you, didn’t I?’
‘It’s all very well for you ladies to joke about it,’ said Patience, ‘but you make me
feel very. uncomfortable.’
‘You’ve no cause to feel uncomfortable,’ said Li Wan. ‘I’ll look after you. You just get
that key and tell your mistress to unlock the store-room and find those things for us.’
‘My dear good Wan, please take these girls back to the Garden,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve
got the rice accounts to go over; I’ve got to see Lady Xing about something (1 don’t
know what, but she’s just sent over to say that she wants me); and I’ve got the New
Year’s clothes to see about. I have to find out what everyone wants and get the
orders placed—’
‘I don’t care in the least about these things,’ said Li Wan airily. ‘You just settle my
business first so that I can go back home and rest and not have these girls pestering
me any more.’
‘Give me a little time!’ said Xi-feng pleadingly. ‘You’re so considerate towards me as
a rule; I don’t know why I’m so Out of favour with you today. I suppose it must be
because of Patience. Often in the past you’ve said to me, “Now I know how busy you
are, Feng, but your health is important: you ought to find means somehow or other
of taking a rest.” That’s what you would normally say in a situation like this; but today
you seem more intent on driving me into an early grave! Incidentally, you may not
think it matters very much if the arrangements for other people’s winter clothing get
put off, but what about the clothing for the girls? Strictly speak?ing that’s your
responsibility. Don’t you think Grandmother would feel that you were taking
non-interference just a little far if she discovered that the girls were going without
winter clothes simply for want of a word from you? You know, of course, that I would
rather get into trouble myself than involve you in trouble...’
‘Listen to her, all of you,’ said Li Wan. ‘Marvellous, isn’t it? I’d like to get hold of that
clever tongue of yours, Feng, and—! Just tell me this one thing, then: are you going
to keep an eye on our poetry club for us or aren’t you?’
‘What a question!’ said Xi-feng. ‘If I refused to join your club and spend my money
in it, I should be declaring myself in open rebellion against the Prospect Garden
Residents’ Association, and heaven help me then!—my life wouldn’t be worth living!
I shall be round first thing tomorrow to report for duty, and the first thing I shall do
will he to pay down fifty taels to be spent as and when you wish on the club’s
entertain?ment. I can t write poetry—or anything else, for that matter—and I’m a
very common, ignorant sort of person to be joining a poetry club; and as for taking
on this disciplinary business: well, whether I do or whether I don’t, I don’t suppose
there’ll be much danger of your expelling me once you’ve seen the colour of my
money.’
The others laughed.
‘I’ll open the store-room presently,’ she continued, ‘and I’ll get them to put out
anything that looks as if it might be of use for you to have a look at. If you can use it,
keep it. Anything you’re still short of after that, I’ll tell them to buy for you outside. I
can get the pongee cut for you straight away. The architect’s drawing isn’t at Lady
Wang’s, by the way; it’s at Cousin Zhen’s place. I’m telling you this to save you a
wasted journey. I can get it for you, if you like; then I can have it taken with the
pongee to Sir Zheng’s gentlemen and ask them to do the sizing for you.’
Li Wan nodded approvingly.
‘That would be very kind. If you’ll really do all that for us, we shall have nothing
more to say. Come on then, everybody I Let’s go home and see what happens. If she
doesn’t send the stuff we can come back and deal with her later.’
She began to leave the room as she said this, the cousins following in her wake.
‘I know of only one person who could have stirred all this up,’ said Xi-feng as they
were going, ‘and that’s Bao-yu.’
The mention of his name stopped Li Wan in her tracks. She came back into the room.
‘I’d completely forgotten: it was Bao-yu that I came about in the first place. He was
the one who failed to turn up at our first meeting. We’re all too soft to know what to
do with him. How do you think we ought to punish him?’
Xi-feng thought for a bit.
‘The only thing I can suggest is that you should make him go round to each of your
apartments in turn and sweep the floors for you.
‘Yes, yes,’ said the others, laughing. ‘The very thing!’
They were just about to leave for the second time when Lai Da’s mother, old Mrs Lai,
came in, leaning on the shoulder of a little maid. Xi-feng and the rest rose to greet
her. They begged her to be seated and offered her their congratulations. The old
woman sat down on the edge of the kang and smiled round at them with pleasure.
‘The way I see it, since you are our employers, our good fortune is really yours. If it
weren’t for your family, how would the likes of us ever have come by a piece of good
fortune like this in the first place? Yesterday when you sent young Sun?shine round
with those presents, my grandson “kotowed up?wards”. in the doorway to show his
gratitude.’
‘When will he be leaving to take up his post?’ said Li Wan. Old Mrs Lai sighed, as
though the thought made her melan?choly.
‘Oh, I don’t concern myself with their affairs. I just let them get on with it. When he
came round to me to kotow the other day, I didn’t have a good word for him. I said to
him, “Young man, don’t tell me you’re a mandarin now, because it’s just plain
ridiculous. Thirty years it is since you were born,” I said, “and all that time, in actual
fact, you’ve :been a bondservant. Yet through the kindness of our Masters you were
set apart from the moment you came out of your mother’s womb. Thanks to the
Masters and your parents,” I said, “you were taught to read and write like a
gentleman’s son and fussed over by a parcel of maids and nannies and wet-nurses as
if you was some sort of young phoenix. I doubt you know how the word
‘bondservant’ is written. You’ve known nothing but soft living since you were born,” I
said. “You don’t know the bitterness your father and your grandfather had to go
through. You don’t appreciate the generations of hardship that went into the making
of a fine gentleman like you. And the money they spent on you,” I said’ “nursing you
through all the fevers and calamities of youth (for you were a sickly, ailing child): it
would have been enough to have made you anew out of silver Then, when you were
twenty, the Master, out of the kindness of his heart, undertook to buy you a place in
the Service, so that your future would be assured. Think how many freeborn
members of the clan go hungry,” I said, “yet be did this fox you, that was born a slave.
Such great fortune should make you fearful. And now, after ten years of fooling
around, you’ve talked the Master—by what jiggery-pokery I do not know -into getting
you selected for a posting. A district magistrate may not be very high in the scale,” I
said, “but the mandarin who goes to a district to be its magistrate is supposed to be
the father and mother of all the people who live there. So mind you don’t go getting
above yourself,” I said. “Do all in your power to show that you are worthy of the trust.
And always let the Master see how much you appreciate what he has done for you.
Otherwise Heaven will surely cast you off.’
Li Wan and Xi-feng both laughed.
‘You worry too much, Mrs Lai,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He’s all right. It’s true we don’t see
much of him nowadays. He used to come in once in a while, but these last few years
all we’ve seen of him has been his visiting-card at New Years and birthdays. He did
come in the other day, however, to kotow to Her Old Ladyship and Lady Wang. We
saw him in Her Old Ladyship’s courtyard, dressed in his new uniform. He looked very
imposing. A little bit fatter than he used to be. You ought to be happy now that he’s a
mandarin, not making yourself miserable with all this worrying about him. Even if he
doesn’t behave himself, I should leave his parents to do the worrying. All you have to
do now is sit back and enjoy your-self. If ever you’re at a loose end, you can always
jump in your chair and have yourself carried round here for a game of cards and a
chat with Her Old Ladyship. I’m sure no one here would dream of making you feel
uncomfortable. After all, you’ve got upstairs and downstairs and halls and
reception-rooms back home just the same as we have. You’re as good as any lady in
the land now, you know. I’m sure you will be respected as such.’
Mrs Lai hurriedly rose to her feet as Patience came up to pour tea for her.
‘You shouldn’t do that, miss. You should let one of the younger ones do it. ’Tain’t
right you should pour for me.’
Sitting down again she continued to hold forth between sips.
‘You don’t know that boy, Mrs Lian. He’s like all young people: you have to be strict
with them all the time. Even then if you’re not careful they’ll somehow find a way to
raise the devil and grieve their parents’ hearts. This young chap of ours now: those
that know him realize it’s just the mischief coming out, but those who don’t are liable
to think that he’s taking advantage of the fact that he’s got more money and
influence than other people to throw his weight about; and that reflects badly on the
Master’s reputation as well. Oh, I get so angry about it sometimes, I don’t know what
to do with myself. I have to call his Dad in and give him a good talking-to and then I
feels a bit better. I hope you won’t mind my saying this’—she pointed a finger at
Bao-yu - ‘but I wouldn’t have thought that your father was strict enough with you.
Look at the way Her Old Ladyship was out in front the moment he started when he
gave you that beating a while ago. You should have seen the way your grandfather
used to lay into him when he was a lad. And your father wasn’t the scapegrace that
you are, either. Then there was your father’s elder brother, Master She. Now he was
mischievous—though even so, he didn’t turn the whole household upsy-downsy the
way you seem to. He was always getting beaten. Oh, and the way your Cousin
Zhen’s grandfather over at the Ning-guo used to lay into his son! Oh, he had a fiery
temper! Once it was up—well, you’d never have thought it was his son he was
beating. Looked more like he was torturing a bandit. From what I’ve seen and beard, I
should imagine that the way your Cousin Zhen at the Ning-guo disciplines his son is in
his grandfather’s tradition. Only trouble is, he’s a bit too erratic. Can’t control himself,
that’s his trouble. I don’t blame the young ones for not respecting him. If you’re
sensible, young man, you’ll be glad to hear me say this; otherwise, though you may
be too polite to say so, I expect you’ll think I’m an interfering old woman.’
Just then Lai Da’s wife came in, followed almost im?mediately by the wives of Zhou
Rui and Zhang Cai. The latter two had come to report to Xi-feng on various domestic
matters. Xi-feng smilingly inquired of Lai Da’s wife whether she had come to collect
her mother-in-law.
‘Well, no, madam, not exactly,’ said Lai Da’s wife. ‘I really came to find out whether
you and the young ladies will be favouring us with your presence or not.’
‘Oh, how silly of me!’ said old Mrs Lai when she heard this. ‘Here have I been
talking a load of stale old sesame and all the time forgetting the one thing I came
here to ask you about! On account of our young chap’s posting, all our friends and
relations want to get together and celebrate, so we thought we’d better have a
reception. Well, the way I saw it, if we only held it for one day, it would mean inviting
some people and leaving out others, and that wouldn’t seem right. So I thought
about it for a bit, and I thought to myself, well, it’s thanks to the Masters that this
great honour has come our way, so we must do what we can to show our
appreciation. Even if it means spending every penny we’ve got, we ought to be glad
to do it. So I told the boy’s father to arrange a reception for three days running. On
the first day we’ll have some tables and a stage in our little bit of garden at the back
to entertain Her Old Ladyship and Their Ladyships and your good selves and the
young ladies, and some more tables and a stage with another lot of players in the
reception room at the front where we can entertain the gentlemen. The second day
will be a reception for relations and friends of the family, and the third day will be for
colleagues on the staffs of the two mansions. I do hope you will honour us with a
visit. It will be the high?light of our celebrations.’
Li Wan and Xi-feng asked her when the reception would be, assuring her that they
fully intended to come.
‘I’m sure Lady Jia would love to come too,’ they said, ‘but I wouldn’t bank on her
being able to.’
‘The date we’ve chosen is the fourteenth,’ said Lai Da’s wife hurriedly, before her
mother-in-law had a chance to get under way again. ‘We do hope you’ll come, for
Mother’s sake.’
‘I can’t answer for the others,’ said Xi-feng amiably, ‘but I shall definitely be coming.
I’d better warn you, though: I haven’t got any present to bring, and you mustn’t
expect me to offer largesse—I wouldn’t know how to go about it. You mustn’t laugh
if I just eat up and go.’
‘Get along with you, madam!’ said Lai Da’s wife, laughing. ‘If you feel like bringing a
largesse, twenty or thirty thousand taels would do very nicely!’
Old Mrs Lai laughed.
‘I been to see Her Old Ladyship already and she says she’ll come. Reckon I ought to
feel pretty pleased with myself.’
After further exhortations to attend the party and various other admonishments, the
old woman was at last getting up to go when her eye chanced to fall on Zhou Rui’s
wife and she seemed to remember something.
‘There’s something else I wanted to ask you about, Mrs Lian. What’s all this about
Zhou’s boy being dismissed? What did he do wrong?’
‘Ah yes, I’ve been meaning to speak to your daughter-in-?law about it,’ said Xi-feng,
‘but there were so many other things to think about that they drove it from my mind.
Lai, dear,’—she turned to Lai Da’s wife—‘when you get back, will you tell your
husband that neither of our households will be employing Zhou Rui’s son any longer
and that he is to send him packing?’
Lai Da’s wife could only agree, but the unhappy mother fell on her knees in
supplication.
‘What did he do?’ old Mrs Lai repeated. ‘Tell me what he did, and I’ll be judge for
you.’
‘Yesterday on my birthday,’ said Xi-feng, ‘before the rest of us had even started
drinking, he was already drunk, and when my grandmother sent her women round
with some presents, instead of going out and being nice to them, he sat where he
was swearing at everybody and made no attempt to receive the presents or take
them inside. Eventually the two women came in by themselves and he did at last go
with a couple of the pages to take in what they had brought. But though the pages
made no trouble, this young Zhou dropped the box he was carrying and scattered
wheat-cakes all over the courtyard. After the women had gone, I sent Sunshine out to
give him a talking-to, but it ended up with him shouting and swearing at Sunshine.
Faced with a young hooligan like that who is so utterly and completely uncontrollable,
I don’t see that one has any choice but to dismiss him.’
‘Is that all it was?’ said Grannie Lai. ‘And I was thinking it must have been
something serious! Take my advice, Mrs Lian. If that boy’s done wrong, beat him and
curse him and tell him to mend his ways, but dismiss him?—no, that would never do.
He’s not like one of your house-born servants. The Zhous came with Her Ladyship
from her old home when she was married. If you insist on dismissing him, it will look
like an affront to Her Ladyship. Give him a few whacks to learn him and tell him not
to do it again; but keep him on, whatever you do. If you won’t do it for his ma’s sake,
do it for Her Lady?ship’s.’
Xi-feng turned to Lai Da’s wife.
‘Very well then. Let him be called for tomorrow and given forty strokes with the
heavy bamboo. And tell him he’s not to drink any more.’
Lai Da’s wife said she would see that done. After that Zhou Rui’s wife kotowed to
Xi-feng in gratitude. She wanted to kotow to Mrs Lai as well, but the old woman
reached forward and prevented her. The four women then left, and Li Wan and the
girls went back into the Garden.
Towards evening Xi-feng sent someone to the store-room, as promised, to hunt out
any old painting gear that had been stored there and take it round for Bao-chai and
the others to look over. On doing so the girls found only about half the things they
wanted, and made a list of the other half which they gave to Xi-feng to have bought.
But these are matters about which it is not necessary to go into detail.
Suffice it to say that the freshly-sized pongee arrived back from outside in due course
together with a rough draft of the projected painting, and that Bao-yu began to
spend a part of each. day at Xi-chun’s place helping her. Tan-chun, Li Wan, Ying-chun
and Bao-chai developed the habit of dropping into sit with them while they worked,
partly to watch the painting and partly because it made a convenient rendezvous.
Reminded by the first nip in the air that the hours of dark?ness were gradually
lengthening, Bao-chai went round for a long consultation with her mother from
which she came away with quantities of extra sewing to occupy herself with in the
evenings; but since, when making her morning and evening calls on Lady Wang and
Grandmother Jia, she would often, if they seemed desirous of her company, spend a
considerable while sitting and talking with them, and since she was also in the habit
of dropping in from time to time to gossip with one or another of her cousins in the
Garden, she had very little leisure for sewing in the daytime and as a consequence
was invariably plying her needle under the lamp until eleven or twelve o’clock at
night.

*

As for Dai-yu, twice every year, following the spring and autumn equinoxes, she
suffered from a recurrence of her old sickness. This autumn the repeated junketings
occasioned by Grandmother Jia’s enthusiastic excursions into the Garden had drained
her of energy. Recently she had begun coughing again; and as this year it seemed to
be considerably worse than usual, she had stopped going out altogether and stayed
at home nursing herself in her room. Sometimes when she was feeling depressed she
would long for a visit from one of the girls and the distraction of someone to talk to.
But when Bao-chai or one of the others did in fact look in to ask how she was, she
would grow fidgety after only a few sentences had been exchanged between them
and begin to wish that they would go. The others realized that it was being ill that
made her like this; and knowing from past experience how hyper?sensitive she was,
they were never sharp with her, even if she was somewhat remiss as a hostess and
often lacking in courtesy.
Once when Bao-chai called in to see her, the nature of her illness became the subject
of their conversation.
‘I suppose the doctors in attendance on this family aren’t too bad as doctors go,’
said Bao-chai, ‘but the medicines they prescribe for you don’t seem to make you any
better. Don’t you think it’s time they called in someone really first-rate who could
cure this sickness once and for all? Every year all through the spring and summer you
have this trouble; yet you’re not an old lady, and you’re not a little girl any longer. You
can’t go on in this way indefinitely.’
‘It’s no good,’ said Dai-yu. ‘This illness will never go away completely. Look what I’m
like ordinarily, even when I’m not ill.’
Bao-chai nodded.
‘Exactly I You know the old saying: “He that eats shall live”? What you ordinarily eat,
when you’re not ill, doesn’t seem to nourish you or build up your resistance. That’s
one of your troubles.’
Dai-yu sighed.

         ‘Life and death are as Heaven decrees; and rank
         and riches are as Heaven bestows them.

These things are not in human power to command. I seem to be worse this year than
I have been in previous years.’
She coughed several times while she was saying this.
‘I was looking the other day it that prescription of yours,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I should
have said myself that there was too much cinnamon and ginseng in it. I know they
are supposed to build you up; but you don’t want to go overheating yourself. If you
ask me, I think the first, most important thing to do is to calm your liver and
strengthen your stomach a bit. If you could reduce the inflamed, over-active state of
your liver so that it was no longer harming the earthy humour of your spleen, your
stomach would begin functioning normally again and then the food you ate could
begin to nourish you properly. First thing every morning you ought to take an ounce
of the best quality bird’s nest and five drams of sugar-candy and heat them up in a
silver skillet until they make a sort of syrup. If you were to take that regularly, it
would do you more good than medicine. There’s nothing like it for building you up if
you have low vitality.’
Dai-yu sighed again.
‘You’re such a kind person,’ she said, ‘but I’ve got such a suspicious nature that in
the past I always suspected that your kindness was a cloak for something and
rejected it. It wasn’t until the other day, when you told me off for reading for?bidden
books and offered me all that good advice, that I ever felt really grateful to you. I
realized then that I had all along been wrong about you— right from the very start. I
suddenly realized: I’m fifteen this year and have no brothers or sisters: ever since my
m6ther died there has been no one—literally no one - who has ever spoken to me in
that sort of way. I’m not surprised Cousin Yun speaks so highly of you. I used to hate
it when I heard her praise your kindness, but since experienc?ing it myself, I know
what she means. If it had been you who’d said those things in the drinking game, I
should have been quite merciless. I should never have kept quiet about it at the time
and gently remonstrated about it later, when we were alone together, as you did I
knew from that that I had been wrong about you, and that you must really care for
me. If my eyes hadn’t been opened for me then, I should never be talking to you like
this today.
‘Now about this bird’s nest syrup you want me to take. I know bird’s nest is fairly
easy to come by, but this illness of mine is something I suffer from every year
because of my weak constitution. There’s nothing particularly serious about it, it’s
just something that I always get. Yet already everyone’s put to a huge amount of
inconvenience because of it, fetching doctors, brewing medicines, buying ginseng for
me and Saigon cinnamon. If I now come up with some fancy new idea like asking to
have bird’s nest syrup made for me every day, then even though Grandmother and
Aunt Wang and Cousin Feng may not say anything, the old nannies and maids on the
staff are sure to resent the extra work. Cousin Bao and Cousin Feng are Grandma’s
favourites, yet you should see the looks these people give them sometimes and you
should hear the things they say about them behind their backs! So you can imagine
what they must be like about me. I’m not even a proper member of the family: I’m
just a refugee, with no family of my own, living here as a hanger-on. That in itself is
enough to make them resent me. It’s difficult enough for? me as it is, without
deliberately thinking up new ways to make them hate me.’
‘I’m just as much an outsider as you are,’ said Bao-chai.
‘There’s no comparison between us;’ said Dai-yu. ‘You’ve got your mother and your
brother for a start. You’ve got property and businesses. You’ve still got land and a
home of your own back in Nanking. It’s true that as marriage-relations they allow you
to live here free of charge, but you provide everything for yourselves apart from the
accommodation. You don’t cost them a penny. And anytime you feel like it, you can
just get up and go. I’ve got nothing at all of my own, absolutely nothing. Yet
everything they give me—food. cloth?ing, pocket-money, even the flowers and trees
in my garden -are the same as they give their own gifts. Can you wonder that the
servants are so resentful ?’
‘Your being here only means one more dowry for them to find,’ said Bao-chai.
‘Surely so small an extra expense as that is hardly going to bother them?’
Dai-yu coloured.
‘I’ve been telling you my troubles because I thought you really cared, but you turn
them into a joke.’
‘Perhaps,’ said Bao-chai, smiling. ‘But it’s true, all the same. However, don’t you
worry: as long as I’m here, I promise to do my best to make it easier for you. If you
will promise always to let me know when anything is bothering you, I will promise to
deal with it if it is in my power to do so. I have a brother, it’s true; but you know as
well as I do what he’s like. It’s really only in having a mother that I can count myself a
bit luckier than you. In other respects we have enough in com?mon to think of
ourselves as fellow-sufferers. If you can see this—as with your intelligence I am sure
you must—you have no cause to go echoing Si-ma Niu’s complaint: “All men have
brothers, only I have none.’ Now, you have suggested that “the less trouble the
better” ought to be your motto here, and I take your point. I shall have a word with
Mother next time I see her about this. I’ll be surprised if we haven’t got some bird’s
nest of our own at home. If we have, I shall tell them to send you a few ounces, so
that you can get your own maids to prepare it for you every morning. That way will
be handier for you and will also avoid the risk of any alarms and excursions with the
staff.’
Dai-yu smiled at her gratefully.
It may be only a little thing, but it is very kind indeed of you to have thought of it.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s not worth speaking of. I’m only afraid that by
spending so much time with other people I may have been neglecting you rather.
Well, I’d better be going now. I’m afraid I’m tiring you.’
‘Come again this evening and talk to me for a bit,’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-chai promised to do so and departed.
And at this point she departs for a little while from our narrative.

*

Left alone, Dai-yu ate a few mouthfuls of congee and then lay down on her bed.
Towards sundown a change of weather came, bringing the whisper and rustle of rain.
It was the pulsing, steady rain of autumn, so constant that you sometimes wonder if
it has stopped. The afternoon slid imperceptibly into a somber evening, blackened by
lowering rain clouds and made yet more melancholy for Dai-yu by the persistent drip
of the rain on her bamboos. Reflecting that Bao-chai would now be unable to come,
she picked up a book at random to read beneath the lamp.
It was a volume of The Lyric Miscellany consisting largely of songs of sorrow and
separation: ‘The Autumn Bride’, ‘The Grief of Parting’ and suchlike. Moved by what
she read, she was inevitably drawn to give outlet to her feelings in com?position and
had soon completed a ‘song of separation ‘of her own. As she had modelled it on
Zhang Ruo-xu’s famous poem ‘Spring River: A Night of Flowers and Moonlight’, she
decided to call it ‘Autumn Window: A Night of Wind and Rain’. This is how it went:

Autumn Window: A Night of Wind and Rain

             The autumn flowers are dead, the leaves are sere;
             Lamp-light comes soon, the nights grow long again.
             Outside my window autumn’s signs appear
             More dismal in the wind and rustling rain.

             The rustling rain came in such swift downpour
             It startled me from autumn-dream-filled sleep.
             Now, in a muse, unable to sleep more,
             I watch the candle at my bedside weep.

           The candle weeps down to its socket low,
    And my heart weeps and desolation feels.
           Yet the same wind in other courts must blow;
             The sound of rain through other windows steals.

             The wind’s chill strikes through quilt and counterpane,
             The rain drums like a mad clock in my ears,
             All night, in whispering, monotone refrain,
             Companion to my own swift-coursing tears.

             The courtyard now with mist begins to fill,
             The bamboo’s drip persists without a pause.
             When will the wind cease and the rain be still,
             That with its weeping soaks my window’s gauze?

Having read it over to herself out loud, she laid down the writing-brush and was
about to go back to bed and settle down for the night when one of her maids
announced the arrival of Master Bao’. Almost simultaneously with this
an?nouncement, Bao-yu himself burst in wearing a rain-cape and an enormous
rain-hat of woven bamboo. Dai-ya laughed at the spectacle he presented.
‘The Old Fisherman! Where have you just sprung from?’
‘How are you today?’ Bao-yu asked her anxiously. ‘Have you had your medicine?
How much have you managed to eat today?’
He was divesting himself of the rain-clothes while he asked these questions. When he
had disposed of them, he picked up the lamp from the table and, shielding it with
one hand to throw the light on her scrutinized her face. He appeared to be satisfied
with what he saw.
You’ve got a better colour today.’
Now that he had taken off the rain-clothes, Dai-yu could see what he was wearing
underneath. He had on a somewhat worn-looking tunic of red silk damask tied with a
green sash at the waist, and trousers of sprigged green silk. The ends of his trousers
were stuffed into socks extravagantly patterned with a design of flowers picked out in
gold, and there were flowers and butterflies embroidered on his satin slippers.
‘The top part of you seems to have been pretty well pro?tected against the rain,’
said Dai-yu, ‘but what about the bottom part? Still, you appear to have kept your feet
dry.’
‘This is a complete outfit I’ve been wearing,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There is a pair of
pear-wood patterns that go with it as well, but I left them outside on your verandah.’
Dai-yu looked again at the cape and rain-hat. Both were exquisitely made—quite
unlike those that are sold in the market.
‘What sort of straw is this cape made of?’ she asked him. ‘It’s so fine. I can see now
why you didn’t look like a hedge?hog in it as people usually do in these things.’
‘The whole outfit was given to me by the Prince of Bei?jing;’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s
exactly like the one he wears himself at home when it rains. If you like it, I’ll get-you
one the same. There’s nothing so very special about it really. The hat’s rather fun.
The centre part is detachable. If you want to wear it in winter when it’s snowing, you
undo this little bamboo fastener and the whole top comes out, leaving you with just
the brim. So when it snows, it can be worn by a woman just as-well as by a man. I’ll
get you a hat like this to wear in winter when it snows.’
‘I don’t want one, thank you,’ said Dai-yu laughing. ‘If I were to wear one of those, I
should look like one of those old fisherwomen you see in plays and paintings.’
Immediately after saying this she realized that she had virtually been offering herself
as a fishwife to Bao-yu’s old fisherman and wished the -remark unsaid. She blushed
with embarrassment and leaned forwards, racked with coughing, over the table. But
Bao-yu appeared not to have noticed. What drew his attention was the poem be had
just spotted which lay on the table beside her. He picked it up and read it. A murmur
of praise which escaped involuntarily from his lips at once brought Dai-yu to her feet.
She snatched the paper from him and burned it over the lamp. But Bao-yu only
laughed.
‘Too late! I’ve already memorized it.’
‘I want to, go to bed now,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Please go now. Come again tomorrow.’
Hearing her speak of bed, Bao-yu felt inside his tunic and pulled out a gold watch
about the size of a walnut which he proceeded to inspect. The hand was pointing
exactly midway between the sign of the Dog and the sign of the Pig: nine o’clock at
night.
‘Yes,’ he said, stuffing the watch hurriedly back into his tunic. ‘Time for bed. I’ve
tired you long enough.’
He put on his cape and his rain hat and went out, but was back again almost
immediately.
‘Is there anything you fancy to eat? Let me know if there is, and I’ll tell
Grandmother first thing tomorrow. It will be safer to tell me than trying to explain
what you want to the old women.’
Dai-yu smiled.
‘I’ll-think about it during the night and let you know first thing tomorrow. Listen: it’s
raining harder. You’d better go quickly. Have you got anyone with you?’
‘Yes,’ one of the did women standing outside on the veran?dah called into her.
‘We’re waiting with our umbrellas up and we’ve got the lantern ready.’
‘Lantern?’ said Dai-yu. ‘In this weather?’
‘The rain makes no difference,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s a horn lantern. They’re not
affected by rain.’
Dai-yu reached out and took down a lamp with a balloon ?shaped glass shade from
the top of her bookcase. She ordered one of the maids to light a little candle in it and
offered it to Bao-yu.
‘Take this. It’s brighter than a horn one, and it’s specially made for going out in the
rain with.’
‘I’ve got one like that myself,’ said Bao-yu, ‘hut I didn’t bring it because I was afraid
they might trip over and break it.’
‘Which is worse,’ said Dai-yu, ‘a broken lamp or a broken leg? You’re not used to
wearing patterns, so it’s important to see where you’re going. The others can carry
the horn lantern in front of you, and you can carry this glass lamp, which is handier
and brighter and specially made for going out in the rain with, yourself. There. You
can send it back to me to?morrow. And if you should break it well, it won’t be the
end of the world. What has made you of all people so parsimonious about things all
of a sudden? You’re as bad as the Persian with his pearl!’
Thus persuaded, Bao-yu took the lamp from her and set off, two old nannies with
umbrellas and a horn lantern in front of him and two little maids with umbrellas
bringing up the rear. He made one of the little maids hold the glass lamp Dai-yu had
given him and leaned on her shoulder until they were back home.
The departure of Bao-yu and his party was immediately fol?lowed by the arrival of
two old women from Allspice Court, also carrying lanterns and umbrellas, with a
large packet of bird’s nest and another packet containing little frosty star?-shapes of
dazzling white imported sugar.
You’ll find these a hit better than the stuff you can buy in the shops,’ they told Dai-yu.
‘Our young lady says this is to be getting on with and when you’ve finished it she’ll
send you some more.’
‘That’s very kind,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Won’t you sit outside with the girls and let them
give you some tea?’
‘We won’t, miss, thank you all the same,’ they said. ‘We’ve got other things to do.’
‘Ah yes, you’re busy,’ said Dai-yu, smiling. ‘I should have remembered. Now that it’s
getting colder and the nights are longer, I expect you will have started your
card-school again. Nothing like a little gambling to pass the long night hours I’
The women laughed good-humouredly.
‘I won’t deceive you, miss,’ said one of them, evidently the chief organizer. ‘I’ve got
a really nice little school going this year. There are always a few of us on night-duty,
you see, and we don’t like to risk falling asleep and missing our watch, so we find our
little card-school the best answer. It keeps us awake and, as you say, miss, it helps to
pass the time. Tonight it’s my turn to be banker. The Garden gate has been closed
now, so it’s time we got started.’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘Well, all I can say is that it’s very nice of you to have taken time off when you could
have been winning money, to go out in the rain and bring me these things.’ She
turned to one of her maids: ‘Give them a few hundred cash so that they can buy
some wine to warm themselves up with after the rain.’
The women thanked her delightedly, and having kotowed, hurried outside to collect
the money, after which they put up their umbrellas again and departed.
Nightingale first put away the bird’s nest and sugar and then, having moved the lamp
over to the bedside and let-down the blinds, helped Dai-yu into bed.
As she lay there alone, Dai-yu’s thoughts turned to Bao?-chai, at first with gratitude,
because of her kindness, but after?wards a trifle enviously, because Bao-chai had a
mother and brother and she had none. Then she began thinking about Bao-yu and
herself: how they had been such good friends to start with, but how later on
suspicion and misunderstanding had grown up between them. Then she listened to
the insistent rustle of the rain on the bamboos and plantains outside her window.
The coldness penetrated the curtains of her bed. Almost without noticing it she had
begun to cry. It was nearly three in the morning before she was properly asleep.
We leave her now, to continue our story in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 46

An awkward person is given an awkward mission
And a faithful maid vows faithfulness unto death



IT was not, we observed in the last chapter, until nearly three o’clock in the morning
that Dai-yu finally dropped off to sleep. We leave her at this point in our narrative
and return to Xi-feng, who, it will be remembered, had been summoned on business
of an unspecified nature by Lady Xing.
When the others had left, Xi-feng hurriedly changed into her going out apparel, got
into her carriage, and drove round to the establishment next door.
The air of mystery surrounding this summons persisted after her arrival. Lady Xing
dismissed the others who had been present and addressed her daughter-in-law
conspiratorially.
‘The reason I have sent for you is that Sir She has entrusted me with a matter of
some delicacy which I hardly know how to go about and I thought I had better
discuss it first with you. He has taken a fancy to Lady Jia’s maid Faithful and wants her
for his concubine; and he has given me the job of asking Lady Jia for her. As I see it,
there is nothing very unusual in such a request, but I am rather afraid that Lady Jia
may refuse and wondered if you had any bright ideas on how one ought to go about
this business.’
Xi-feng put on what she hoped was a disarming smile.
‘I don’t think it’s worth trying. I think it would be merely asking for trouble.
Without Faithful, Grandma would be completely lost; she’d never consent to give her
up. In any case, she’s often remarked, in private conversation about Father, that she
can’t understand why at his age he continues to sur?round himself with young
girls—“wasting their young lives” she calls it. She says it’s not good for his health, and
that he ought to save up his energies for his job and not fritter them away on
“drinking all day with his fancy women”. You wouldn’t derive much pleasure from
hearing this sort of thing said to your face, Mother, and I am very sure that Father
wouldn’t. Yet if you insist on approaching Grandma about this, I’m afraid that that’s
what will happen. It will be like poking a straw up a tiger’s nostril. I hope you won’t
be offended, but I’m afraid I daren’t approach her about this. I should only be
demonstrating my own powerlessness to help and making a lot of unpleasantness for
myself into the bargain. Father is inclined to be a bit ga-ga at times nowadays. It’s up
to you to talk him out of it, Mother. This sort of thing is all very well in a younger man,
but in someone of Father’s years, with children and grandchildren of his own, it is
really too shaming I’
Lady Xing sniffed.
‘Lots of men in well-to-do families like ours have troops of concubines. Why should
it be so shameful only in our case? Anyway, I don’t know what makes you think he’d
listen to me, even if I did try to talk him out of it. And even if Lady Jia is so attached to
Faithful, she may not find it all that easy to refuse when the person asking is an
eldest son with a grey beard who has held a position in the Government.
Incident?ally, I only asked you over here for your opinion. I don’t see why you should
have to start reading me a lecture. There was never any question of asking you to
approach Lady Jia for me: I shall naturally undertake that task myself. And as for
com?plaining that I haven’t tried talking Father out of this obviously you have no
conception of what his temper can be like. I did try to dissuade him, but he started
hollering at me almost before the words were out of my mouth.’
Xi-feng knew that her mother-in-law was a weak and silly woman, always willing, for
the sake of a quiet life, to fall in with her husband’s wishes. Apart from pleasing her
husband, her principal aim in life was to see how much she could squeeze out of the
domestic economy and diver? into her personal savings. Decisions both great and
small she left to him; but all household monies passed through her hands, and she
saw to it that they suffered a considerable diminution in the process. The reason she
gave for this pillage was Jia She’s extravagance. ‘I have to economize,’ she would say,
‘to make up for what Sir She wastes.’ Among the children and servants of the
household there was not one whom she trusted or whose advice she would listen to.
From the tone of what she had just heard, Xi-feng knew that her mother-in-law’s
obstinate streak had been aroused and that it would now be quite useless to reason
with her. She therefore smiled even more disarmingly and promptly changed her
tack.
‘Of course. You are right, Mother. I haven’t had enough experience to be able to
judge these matters. But now I come to think of it, it’s only natural that a mother
should give what she treasures to her own son. Who else would Grandma give her
favourite maid—or any other precious thing—to if not to Father? One shouldn’t
believe everything that people say about other people behind their backs. No, I can
see that now. I have been too credulous. One has only to think how you and Father
are with Lian. Many a time when Lian has done some?thing he shouldn’t have done,
you and Father have spoken as if you could hardly wait to lay your hands on him, but
when he eventually turned up, you have forgiven everything and ended up by giving
him some treasured possession. I’ve no doubt that in this case it will turn out in
exactly the same sort of way with Grandma and Father. As a matter of fact, Grandma
is in rather a good mood today, so if you are going to ask her, it would probably be
best to do so straight away. Let me go over first to keep her sweet for you. I’ll find
some excuse for leaving and taking the others with me when you arrive. That will
give you a good opportunity for raising this matter. If she says yes, that will, of course,
be splendid. But even if she doesn’t, no great harm will have been done, be?cause no
one else will know about it.’
Hearing what she wanted to hear, Lady Xing’s good humour returned and she
proceeded to tell Xi-feng what she had already decided to do.
‘Actually my idea is not to mention this to Lady Jia at first. I think I shall begin by
having a quiet word with Faithful her?self. Though she may be bashful, as long as she
doesn’t say anything against it when I’ve explained it all to her, I shall
know that as far as she is concerned it is all right. If I talk to Lady Jia then, though she
may be unwilling to part with her, she won’t be able to get over the fact that Faithful
herself is willing to leave. “There’s no holding someone who has a mind to go,” as
they say. I think there should be no difficulty.’
‘Trust you for sound planning, Mother!’ said Xi-feng. ‘That way sounds fool-proof.
After all, every one of these girls is ambitious—they all want to improve their
position and get on in the world—and it’s unthinkable that she should throw away
this chance of becoming almost a mistress in order to remain a maid and end up
marrying one of the grooms.
‘Exactly!’ said Lady Xing. ‘That’s exactly what I thought. Any of these senior maids
would give her ears for a chance like this. Anyway, you go over now—only don’t
breathe a word of this to anyone else!—and I’ll follow later on, when I’ve had my
dinner.’
Xi-feng reflected.
‘Faithful’s no fool,’ she thought. ‘Whatever Mother says, it’s far from certain that
she’ll accept. Suppose I do go first and Mother follows later. If Faithful says yes, all
well and good; but if she doesn’t, Mother has such a suspicious nature that she’s sure
to think it’s because I’ve blabbed and been encouraging the girl to play hard to get. It
will be humiliating for her to discover that my prediction was right, and that will
make her angry; and then she’ll take it out on me—which won’t be very amusing. It
would be better if we went over together; then, whether Faithful accepts or not, no
suspicion can possibly fall on me.’
‘Just now as I was on the point of coming over,’ she said, bringing these reflections
to a rapid conclusion, ‘two crates of quails arrived from my aunt’s. I told the servants
to fry them, intending to send them over later for your dinner. Then, on my way in
through your gate, I met some of the boys from here with your carriage. They said it
had something wrong with it and they were taking it outside to be mended. Why not
make use of my carriage instead? We can go over together in it now, and you can
dine at my place afterwards on the quails.’
Finding this proposal acceptable, Lady Xing called in her maids to help her change;
then, supported by her ever-solicitous daughter-in-law, she got into the latter’s
carriage and drove with her to the establishment next door. On their way Xi-feng
pointed out that if they arrived at Grandmother Jia’s place together, the old lady
might notice her outdoor clothes and ask her where she had been.
‘It would be better if you went in there alone, while I slip back to my own place to
change,’ she said. ‘I’ll join you later, as soon as I’ve got into my everyday clothes.’
Lady Xing thought that this sounded reasonable and went in on her own to see
Grandmother Jia. After chatting with her for a few minutes about nothing in
particular, she left on the pretext of visiting Lady Wang. This meant that she went out
through the rear of the apartment, so that her way took her past Faithful’s room and
she was able to look in casually in passing to see if she was there.
Faithful was sitting in her room sewing, but stood up as Lady Xing entered.
‘What’s that you’re embroidering?’ Lady Xing asked her. ‘Let me look.’
She took the embroidery from her hand and inspected it.
‘You are getting very good,’ she said, laying it down again, and proceeded to
scrutinize the girl carefully, from head to foot.
Faithful had on an almost new lilac-coloured dress of silk damask over which she
wore a dag-edged sleeveless black satin jacket. Her skirt was a pale eau de Nil. Lady
Xing observed the slender waist and elegantly sloping shoulders, the oval face, the
lustrous, raven-black hair, the slightly aquiline nose, the cheeks slightly spotted with
a few tiny moles. Faithful grew embarrassed and apprehensive beneath this scrutiny.
‘What brings Your Ladyship here at this hour?’ she asked. ‘You don’t often come
over in the afternoon.’
Lady Xing made a sign to the maids who had accompanied her to leave the room,
then, seating herself in Faithful’s place, she took the maid by the hand and smiled at
her graciously.
‘I’ve come to wish you joy, my dear.’
Hearing this, Faithful was able to guess, more or less, what her visitor had come
about. She coloured and hung her head in silence while Lady Xing continued.
‘You see, Sir She has no one nowadays he feels he can really rely on. He was
thinking of buying someone; but you know, you can never trust those girls you get
from the dealers. You don’t know how clean they are, and often you don’t find out
what the snags are until it is too late. They seem all right when you buy them, but
two or three days later you find them get?ting up to the most frightful antics. Well,
then he thought he’d pick someone from among our house-born servants, but he lust
couldn’t seem to find anyone good enough. Either they weren’t good-looking enough,
or their looks were all right hut their characters wouldn’t do, or whatever it was
there was always something wrong with them. Anyway—to cut a long story
short—after half a year’s careful study, he has finally decided that you are the cream
of the cream. In looks, in character, in behaviour he finds you perfect: gentle,
reliable—in fact, all the things he is looking for in a girl. So he’s decided to ask Lady
Jia if he can have you for his concubine. Of course, you would get much better
treatment than a newly bought girl from outside could expect. In your case we
should put your hair back straight away and treat you as a proper chamber-wife. You
would be ‘Auntie’ to the children and ‘Mrs’ to the maids. In fact, you would have
practically the status of a mistress. Now I know you are an ambitious young woman.
You know what they say: “True gold will find its price.” In your case it’s proved by the
fact that Sir She has taken this fancy to you. Here is a chance of doing all those things
you ever set your heart on doing. And if you have any enemies, you will be in a
position now to make them look very silly. Now—come along with me and tell Her
Old Ladyship all about it.,
She took Faithful’s hand and made as if to go, but Faithful reddened and snatched her
hand away. Lady Xing assumed that she did so from bashfulness.
‘Come,’ she said, ‘there’s no need to be bashful. You don’t have to say anything
yourself if you don’t want to. just come with me and let me do the talking.’
But Faithful still hung her head and did not move.
‘Surely,’ said Lady Xing, when it became evident that Faithful was determined not
to accompany her, ‘surely you can’t mean to refuse this offer? I must say, you’ll be a
very silly girl if you do. What, throw away the chance of becoming a lady in order to
go on being a maid? if you do, then in two or three years time when they marry you
off, it will only be to one of the boys, you know. You’ll still be a slave just the same.
Whereas if you come to live with us—well, you know my nature: I’m not a difficult
person to get on with; and Sir She always treats his girls very nicely. And after you’ve
been with him for a year or two, if you can bear him a child, you’ll be on the same
level as me: everyone in the household will have to jump to it when you give them
orders. If you throw away an opportunity like this, you’ll certainly live to regret it.”
Faithful continued to hang her head and say nothing.
‘You’re such a lively person as a rule,’ said Lady Xing.
‘ What’s got hold of your tongue? is there any particular thing about this
arrangement that doesn’t suit you? Please let me know if there is, and I promise that
it shall be altered.’
But Faithful still said nothing.
‘Oh, I know what it is,’ said Lady Xing. ‘I expect you’ve got parents and don’t like to
say anything until you’ve heard from them. Why yes, very right and proper. I shall get
in touch with your parents and no doubt you will be hearing from them in due course.
Then anything you want to say, you will be able to say to them.’
With that she left, and went round to Xi-feng’s apartment. Xi-feng had long since
changed back into her ordinary clothes. As no one else was about, she had taken the
oppor?tunity of telling Patience about her interview with Lady Xing. Patience was
amused, but shook her head doubtfully at Lady Xing’s optimism.
‘If you ask me, I think it’s very uncertain. From the way she’s always spoken in the
past when we’ve been alone together, I should think she’ll-refuse. Anyway, we’ll just
have to wait and see.’
‘Lady Xing is sure to come here afterwards to talk about what happened,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘If Faithful has accepted, it will be all right; but if Faithful hasn’t accepted,
she’s not going to be in a very good mood, and it would embarrass her to have you
here while she was telling me about it. You’d better order them to prepare some of
those quails and a few other dishes to go with them so that I can offer her dinner
when she arrives; but after you’ve done that, you’d better take yourself off for a bit
and don’t come hack until you think she’s gone.’
Patience gave Xi-feng’s instructions to the cook and then went off to enjoy herself in
the Garden.
*

When Lady Xing left, Faithful felt sure that she would go straight to Xi-feng’s for
consultation and that soon after that someone else would arrive and put the same
question to her again. it seemed to her that the best way of avoiding this would be to
decamp. She sought out Amber in order to give some cover to her exit.
‘If Her Old Ladyship should ask for me, tell her that I’m not feeling well and couldn’t
eat any lunch today. Say I’ve gone to walk in the Garden for a bit and shall be back
again shortly.’
Amber agreed to do this and Faithful went off to wander about in the Garden. While
she -was doing so, she came by coincidence upon Patience doing exactly the same
thing.
Seeing no one else but the two of them around, Patience felt no compunction in
revealing her newly acquired knowledge.
‘Look who’s here! she called out teasingly. Mrs Faithful!’
Faithful blushed bright red.
‘I suppose you’re in the plot against me too. Well, never mind. I’ll be having it out
with your mistress presently.’
Patience could see that Faithful was really angry, and regret?ted her foolish jibe.
Taking her by the hand, she led her to some rocks beneath a stand of maple trees
where they could sit down together, and proceeded to tell her all that Xi-feng had a
few minutes earlier told her.
‘Thank you,’ said Faithful when she had finished. ‘You and I at least are still friends.
When I think of our set how many were we?—Aroma, Amber, Candida, Nightingale,
Suncloud, Silver, Musk, Ebony, Kingfisher—she left to go with Miss Shi—Charmer and
Golden—they both died—Snowpink that was dismissed—you and me—there must
have been a dozen of us altogether: when we were young we always told each other
everything and shared everything together; but now that we are older, the others all
seem to go their different ways and just aren’t interested. Not me, though: I haven’t
changed. I’m just the same as I always was. I don’t have any secrets from any of you.
Now listen: I’m telling you this now for you to remember—only don’t go passing it on
to your Mrs Lian. It’s not just a question of not wanting to be his concubine. I
wouldn’t go to Sir She, not if Lady Xing had died and he sent matchmakers and
witnesses and asked me to be his proper wife!’
Patience was about to answer when there was a laugh from behind the rocks on
which they were sitting and a voice called out.
‘What’s this shameless boasting I hear? It’s enough to set one’s teeth on edge!’
Startled, the two of them rose to their feet and went to look behind the rockery to
find out who it was. Aroma emerged, laughing, as they did so.
‘What’s all this about? Tell me about it too.
The three of them sat down on the rocks together and Patience retold all that she
had just told Faithful.
‘Well!’ said Aroma when Patience had finished. ‘I suppose it’s not for someone in
my place to say so, but what a nasty old man! Unless they’re downright misshapen,
just about no one is safe from him.’
‘I can tell you a way out of this if you want to refuse,’ said Patience.
‘What?’ said Faithful.
‘Have a word with Her Old Ladyship and get her to tell him that she’s already given
you to Mr Lian. That’ll cool his ardour.’
‘You too now?’ said Faithful angrily. ‘You’re a nice lot, I must say! It was your
mistress who suggested that the other day. I thought we hadn’t heard the last of
that.’
‘If you don’t want either of them,’ said Aroma, ‘then if you ask me I think your best
plan would be to get her to tell him that she’s promised you to Master Bao. That
would put him off right away!’
Both embarrassed and-exasperated by these taunts, Faithful rounded on her
tormentors with some heat.
‘You’re rotten, both of you, and I hope you both come to bad ends! I thought you
were decent sorts who might try to comfort me in my trouble. But even if you don’t
care, you might at least refrain from treating it as a joke. I suppose you think you
don’t have to worry about me because your own futures are assured and each of you
will end up as chamber wife to the person of your choice. Well, as I see it, things in
this world don’t always turn out the way you want them to. I wouldn’t be quite so
cock-a-hoop if I were you. You might be in for some nasty shocks yourselves.’
The others saw that they had really rattled her and laughingly did their best to calm
her down.
‘Now, now, Faithful, don’t take it so much to heart. We three have been like sisters
ever since we were little girls. We were only teasing you a bit because there’s no one
else around. Tell us what plan you’ve decided on, so that we shan’t be so worried
about you;’
‘Plan?’ said Faithful. ‘I’ve got no plan. I just shan’t go to him and that’ll be the end
of it.’
Patience shook her head.
‘I very much doubt if it will. You know what Sir She’s temper is like. It’s true that he
can’t touch you as long as you’re with Her Old Ladyship; but you’re not going to be
with her all your life, are you? You’ll have to leave in the end, and if you fall into his
clutches then, you’ll be in real trouble.’
Faithful smiled grimly.
‘As long as Her Old Ladyship lives, I shall stay with Her Old Ladyship. And when all’s
said and done, even when the old dear goes to her rest, there are still the years of
mourning. There would be no question of his taking a concubine with his mother just
dead. And by the time the period of mourning is over—well, anything might have
happened. I’ll just have to wait and see. If I get really desperate, I can -always shave
my hair off and become a nun; or failing that, there’s always suicide. I don’t mind
going through life without a man. Glad to keep myself clean?
The other two tittered protestingly.
‘The things you say, Faithful! Have you no shame?’
‘There’s not much room left for shame when things have come to this pass,’ said
Faithful. ‘Anyway, if you don’t believe me, just wait and see. Lady Xing said just now
that she was going to see my parents about this. I wonder if she will. She’ll have to go
all the way to Nanking if she does!’
‘Your parents are looking after the house in Nanking and can’t be fetched,’ said
Patience, ‘but they can be got in touch with eventually. And in any case, your elder
brother and his wife are here. It’s a pity you’re a house-born servant and not on your
own here like me and Aroma.’
‘It makes no odds,’ said Faithful. ‘ “You can take an ox to the water, but you can’t
make him drink.” Just because I refuse him, he’s not going to kill my parents!’
While she was talking, her sister-in-law appeared some distance from where they
were sitting, walking in their direction.
‘There you are!’ said Aroma. ‘They’ve evidently found that they can’t get in touch
with your parents, so they’ve already had a word with your sister-in-law.’
‘That cow!’ said Faithful. ‘She’s a regular camel-dealer, that one. She’d just jump at
a thing like this!’
The ‘cow’ was already upon them, smiling all over her face.
‘Ah, here you are, miss! I’ve looked for you everywhere. Come with me. I’ve got
something to tell you.’
Patience and Aroma fussed round her, inviting her to sit with them on the rock.
‘No, you young ladies sit down;’ said the woman. ‘I’ve got to have a word with our
Faithful.’
‘Is it really very urgent?’ they asked her innocently. ‘We’ve been playing “I spy”.
Can’t it wait until we’ve finished guessing?’
‘What is it?’ said Faithful. ‘Why not just tell me?’
‘Come with me,’ said her sister-in-law. ‘I’ll tell you over there. It’s good news,
anyway.’
‘Oh, is it by any chance the thing Lady Xing was talking about?’ said Faithful.
‘There!’ said her sister-in-law. ‘You knew about it all the time! What were you
having me on for? Now come on, hurry, and I’ll tell you all the details. It’s a
wonderful, wonderful piece of news!’
Faithful stood up and spat hard and deliberately in her sister-in-law’s face.
‘Why don’t you take your bloody trap out of here?’ she shouted, pointing at her
angrily. ‘ “Wonderful news” indeed! I suppose you’ve been studying the way families
of maids who’ve become concubines can throw their weight about, so you just can’t
wait to push me into that fire. If I find favour, then of course you’ll be the great lady
and be able -to put on airs and throw your weight about too. If I don’t, if I’m a
failure—oh, you’ll just draw your tortoise-head back into your tortoise-shell and
leave me to get on with it. Whether I live or die, it will be all the same to you.
She began crying hysterically and had to be restrained and comforted by Patience
and Aroma.
‘Huh!’ said her sister-in-law in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve her ruffled
dignity. ‘Whether you’re willing or not, you might at least be civil. Anyway, I don’t see
why you need drag other people into it. “One doesn’t discuss short legs in front of a
dwarf,” they say. I make no comment on the nasty things you said about me, but
what about these young ladies? They’ve done nothing to provoke you. This talk
about concu?bines is not very nice for them.’
‘Oh no!’ said the two young ladies in question. ‘She wasn’t referring to us when she
said -that. It’s you who are dragging in other people. What makes you think that
either of us has been chosen as a concubine? By whom? Even if we had been, neither
of us has any family in this household to throw their weight about, so she can say
what she likes on the subject:
there’s no occasion for us to get worked up about it.’
‘It’s because I made her look silly,’ said Faithful. ‘She’s trying to cover up by setting
you two against me. Fortunately you are too intelligent to be taken in. I lost my
temper just now and I’m afraid I didn’t choose my words very carefully. She evidently
thought she could take advantage of that.’
Faithful’s sister-in-law was by now finding her situation so disagreeable that she
removed herself from it by walking away in a huff. Faithful herself was still extremely
angry and for some time continued to hurl invectives at her retreating back; but
Patience and Aroma reasoned with her, and gradually she began to calm down.
‘Why were you hiding there just now?’ Patience asked Aroma when Faithful’s
composure had been restored. ‘It’s funny that we didn’t see you.’
‘I’d been over to Miss Xi-chun’s to see Master Bao,’ said Aroma, ‘but I got there a
moment too late. They said he had just that minute left for home. I couldn’t
understand why in that case I hadn’t run into him on the way, so I thought per?haps
he might have gone to Miss Lin’s; but just as I was going there to look for him, I met
one of Miss Lin’s people who said that he wasn’t with her, so I began wondering if he
might have gone out of the Garden altogether. Then just at that moment you came
along from the direction I was looking in, so I slipped behind a tree and hid. When
Faithful came, I slipped out from behind my tree and hid behind this rock. I could see
you both sitting there talking, but your two pairs of eyes couldn’t see me.
‘And your three pairs of eyes couldn’t see me!’ said a mock?ing voice behind them.
The three girls jumped in surprise. When they turned to look, it was Bao-yu himself
who walked out from behind the rock.
Aroma was the first to recover her voice.
You led me a nice dance!’ she said. ‘Where have you been all this time?’
‘As I came out of Xi-chun’s place, I could see you coming towards me,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I knew it must be me you had come for, so I hid myself to give you a surprise. I
watched you as you walked by with your head in the air. Then I watched you go into
Xi-chun’s courtyard. Then I saw you come out again. Then I saw you stop and ask
someone something. It was terribly funny. I was hoping that you would eventually
come by the place where I was hiding, so that I could pop out and make you jump.
But then you started dodging around, and I could see that you were hiding from
someone else and evidently planning to play the same trick on them. So I peeped out
to see who it was and found that it was these two. Then I began gradually working
my way round behind you, and when you stepped out and showed yourself, I slipped
forward and hid in the place where you had been biding.’
‘We’d better go behind and have another look,’ said Patience. ‘We’ll probably find
two more people hidden back there!’
‘No, I think there really are no more now,-’ said Bao-yu.
When she realized that Bao-yu must have heard everything that had been said,
Faithful lay face downwards on the rock and pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu laughed
at her and gave her a little prod.
‘It’s damp on that stone. Much better come indoors if you want to lie down.’
He tried to pull her up, at the same time inviting Patience to accompany them back
home for some tea. When Patience and Aroma added their own coaxing to his,
Faithful finally rose to her feet and the four of them went together to Green Delights.
Bao-yu had, indeed, heard everything from his hiding-place, and his concern for
Faithful made him very unhappy. When they were back, he lay back silent on his bed
worrying about it while the three girls laughed and chattered in the adjoining room.
*

When Lady Xing asked Xi-feng about Faithful’s parents, she learned that her father’s
name was Jin Cai and that he and her mother lived as caretakers at the Jia family
mansion in Nanking and seldom came up to the capital.
‘But she has an elder brother Jin Wen-xiang, who is one of Grandmother’s buyers,’
said Xi-feng, ‘and her sister-in-law is Grandmother’s chief laundress.’
The laundress was duly summoned and Lady Xing carefully explained what was
required of her. The woman was naturally delighted and went off in a great bustle of
self-importance to look for Faithful, confident that she had only to state her mission
for the matter to be successfully concluded. Ill pre?pared, therefore, for Faithful’s
acrimonious rebuff or the strictures of Patience and Aroma which followed it, she
re-turned to Lady Xing to make her report in a state of angry mortification.
‘It’s no good, I’m afraid. She just swore at me.’ Since Xi-feng was present, the
woman dared not mention Patience, ‘That Aroma was there, too, helping her. Some
of the things she said to me—well, I wouldn’t offend Your Ladyship’s ears by
repeating them. I think you and Sir She would be well advised to buy a girl elsewhere.
That little fool Faithful evi?dently wasn’t meant for such great fortune—nor we to
share it, seemingly.’
‘Whatever has this got to do with Aroma?’ said Lady Xing. ‘I wonder how she got to
know about it.’ She paused for a moment. ‘Was there anyone else there?’
‘Miss Patience was there,’ said the woman.
‘I wish you’d given her a box on the ears then and told her to come home,’ Xi-feng
put in hurriedly. ‘She went oft wandering somewhere or other as soon as I left the
house and there wasn’t a sign of her when I got back. If she was there, she’ll have put
in her pennyworth too, I suppose.’
‘Well, she wasn’t exactly there,’ said the woman, ‘she was quite a way off. I couldn’t
see her very clearly. Maybe it wasn’t her, I could have been mistaken.’
‘Go and find her at once,’ Xi-feng said to the servants. ‘Tell her I’m back and Lady
Xing is here and she is to come home immediately.’
Felicity hurried forward to report:
‘Miss Lin sent round three to four times to ask if Patience would go over to her
place, -so Patience went to see what she wanted. I went there to call her back when
you came in just now, but Miss Lin said would I please tell you that she wants
Patience a bit longer to do something for her.’
‘She’s always asking Patience to do things for her,’ said Xi-feng, with pretended
annoyance. ‘I wonder what it is this time.
Resourceless, now that her plan had misfired, Lady Xing returned home as soon as
she had eaten dinner and in the evening informed Jia She of what had happened.
After reflecting for some moments, Jia She ordered Jia Lian to be summoned
immediately.
‘Jin Cai and his wife aren’t the only couple looking after our Nanking property,’ he
began as soon as Jia Lian arrived. ‘Have him recalled immediately.’
‘Last time we had a letter from Nanking,’ said Jia Lian, ‘it said that Jin Cai was in a
delirium and they’d already issued the money to buy his coffin. He may well be dead
by now; and even if he isn’t, he’s probably unconscious and wouldn’t be much use to
us back here. And his old woman is as deaf as a post.
‘Villain! Parricide!’ Jia She shouted, in instant fury. ‘Trust you to know that! Get out
of my sight!’
Startled by his father’s unaccountable anger, Jia Lian retreated in a hurry. Shortly
after he had done so, Jin Wen-xiang was sent for.
Jia Lian, not daring either to go back home or to go in again to his father, stayed near
at hand in his outer study, waiting to see what happened. After a while Jin Wen-xiang
arrived, and Jia Lian watched him being conducted through the inner gate by the
pages. After a lapse of time in which he could comfort?ably (had he been so minded)
have eaten four or five meals, he saw Jin Wen-xiang come out again, but was still too
scared to make inquiries. He did not do so until be had allowed what he thought was
a safe interval to elapse after Jin Wen-xiang’s departure, and was then informed that
his father had gone to bed. Only then did he dare to go back home; and it was not
until Xi-feng informed him that night that he understood what it was all about.

*

That night Faithful was unable to sleep. Her brother came next morning to ask
Grandmother Jia if he could take his sister back home for the day. His request was
granted, and Grandmother Jia ordered Faithful to get ready. Faithful did not want to
go, but overcame her reluctance because she did not want the old lady to suspect
that anything was amiss.
When they were -home, her brother told her all that Jia She had said, promising that
if she accepted, her position would be an honoured one: she would become ‘Mrs Jin’,
and all the household would look up to her. But no matter what he said, Faithful set
her face firmly against it all and obstinately con?tinued to say ‘no’. In the end her
brother had no alternative but to go back to Jia She and tell him that his sister was
un?willing. Jia She was greatly incensed.
‘Now look here,’ he said, ‘you go back and get your wife to tell her this: Sir She says:
             The moon ever loved a young man.

He knows all about that saying. No doubt she thinks him too old for her and has set
her heart on one of the younger ones Bao-yu, probably, or my son Lian. Tell her, if she
has, the sooner she abandons hope in that direction the better, because if I can’t
have her, she may be very sure that no one else in this family will dare to. That’s one
thing. And here’s another. She may think that because she’s Lady Jia’s favourite, she
can look forward to marrying outside one day and becoming someone’s regular wife.
Well if so, just let her get this firmly into her mind: whoever or wherever she marries,
she needn’t think she will ever escape me. If she dies or is prepared to live all her life
an old maid, I might admit myself beaten; but otherwise, never. So unless she
proposes to choose one of those alternatives, she’d better hurry up and change her
mind. It will be a great deal easier for her if she does.’
Each sentence of the above had been punctuated by a nervous ‘Yessir’ from Jin
Wen-xiang. Jia She continued.
‘Now don’t think you can fool me over this in the hope of getting better terms.
Tomorrow I shall send Lady Xing over to have a word with Faithful herself. If Faithful
still refuses after your wife has spoken to her, then that is no fault of yours and I
shan’t hold it against you. But woe betide you if when Lady Xing talks to her she finds
that she is willing!’
After a good many more ‘Yessirs’ Jin Wen-xiang withdrew and went back home.
When he got back, he did not even wait to transmit Jia She’s message through his
wife, but went straight in and told it all to Faithful himself It made Faithful so angry
that for some time afterwards she was unable to speak. Finally, after some inward
calculation, she answered him as follows.
‘Even if I am willing, you’ll have to take me back first, so that I can have a word
about it with Her Old Ladyship.’
Supposing this to mean that she had changed her mind, her brother and his wife
were overjoyed, and the latter at once undertook to go with her to see Grandmother
Jia.
It so happened that when they arrived, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-yu
and the girls, and some of the senior stewardesses from outside were all - there with
the old lady sharing a joke. Faithful led her sister-in-law through their midst, knelt
down at her mistress’s feet, and with tears stream?ing down her face, proceeded to
tell her what Lady Xing had said to her the day before, what her sister-in-law had said
to her in the Garden, and what her elder brother had told her that morning.
‘When I refused, Sir She said it was because I fancied Master Bao, or else because I
was saving myself to marry someone outside. He said that even if I were to fly to the
world’s end, I should never as long as I live escape out of his clutches: sooner or later
he’d have his revenge. But I’ve made my mind up, and I’m telling Your Ladyship here,
in front of all these witnesses. I don’t care whether it’s Master Bao or Prince Bao or
the Emperor Bao, I don’t ever want to marry anyone. Even if Your Ladyship herself
were to try and force me to, I’d rather cut my own throat than marry. I’ll serve Your
Ladyship until you leave this world for the next one; and when that day comes, I
shan’t go back to my brother and his wife; I shall either take my own life or I shall cut
my hair off arid become a nun. And in case anyone should think I don’t really mean
this and am only saying it to get myself out of a corner, I call on heaven and earth and
all the gods and the sun and moon to be my witness: if I don’t honestly and sincerely
mean every word I say, may I be struck with a quinsy this very moment and matter
burst out of my mouth!’
She had hidden a pair of scissors up her sleeve before she came, and as she uttered
this oath, she undid her hair with her left hand and began hacking away at it with the
scissors in her tight. The servants rushed forward to stop her, but before they could
lay hands on her, she had already cut off a large hank. It was fortunate that her hair
was so thick and strong. Observing with relief that she had not succeeded in cutting
through all of it, the servants wound up what remained and refastened it on her
head.
By the time Faithful had finished speaking, Grandmother Jia was trembling all over
with rage.
‘I have only this one girl left that I can rely on,’ she said, speaking half to herself,
‘and now they are plotting to take her away from me.’
As she looked at those standing around her, her eye fastened upon Lady Wang.
‘You deceive me, all of you. You who are outwardly so dutiful: you are secretly
plotting against me like all the rest. Whenever I have any good thing you come and
ask me for it. All my best people you take away from me. Now I have only this one
poor girl left to me; and because you see that I am nice to her, it infuriates you—you
can’t bear it! And now you’ve found this means of getting her away from me, so that
you can have me at your mercy.’
Lady Wang had risen to her feet as soon as Grandmother Jia addressed her, but dared
not defend herself; Aunt Xue could not very well intervene when the object of these
stric?tures was her elder sister; and Li Wan had hustled her young charges from the
room at the first hint of impropriety when Faithful began her complaint.
Tan-chun, always one of the more thoughtful members of the family, realized that
however unjust the accusation, Lady Wang was in no position to answer back. She
realized that Aunt Xue could not speak up for her own sister or Bao-chai say anything
when her mother was silent and that Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-yu were even more
disqualified from coming to the rescue. This was exactly the sort of situation in which
a young unmarried granddaughter could be useful. And since Ying-chun was too
docile and Xi-chun too childish, Tan-chun herself, after listening for a while at the
window, boldly stepped into the room and faced her grandmother with an intrepid
smile.
‘How can this matter have anything to do with Mother, Grandma? Can you think of
any reason why a younger brother’s wife should be consulted about her
brother-in-law’s private business?’
Grandmother Jia was at once all smiles.
‘Of course not, my dear. I am a silly old woman! Mrs Xue, you must try not to laugh
at me. Your sister is a most dutiful daughter-in-law: not like She’s wife, who is so
scared of her husband that she has no time for me - beyond what she does for form’s
sake. I have done your sister a very grave injustice.’
Aunt Xue murmured something in reply, afterwards adding as a politeness:
‘The younger son’s wife is often the more favoured one. Perhaps you are biased,
Lady Jia.’
‘No,’ said Grandmother Jia firmly, ‘I am not biased. Bao-yu,’ she said, turning to her
grandson, ‘why didn’t you speak up when I falsely accused your mother? How could
you stand by like that and watch her being treated unjustly?’
‘How could I take Mother’s side against Uncle and Aunt?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Obviously
someone was to blame; but if it wasn’t Mother, who was I to say that it was? I could
hardly have said that it was me. Somehow I don’t think you would have believed
me!’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘Yes, I suppose you are right. Go and kneel down to your mother, then, Bao-yu. Tell
her that I’m getting old and that she is not to be upset by what I said to her. Ask her
to forgive me for your sake.’
Bao-yu quickly went over and knelt before Lady Wang. But before he could relay his
grandmother’s message, his mother had laughingly prevented him.
‘Get up at once and don’t be ridiculous, Bao-yu I How can you possibly apologize
for Grandma to me ?’
Bao-yu hurriedly got up to his feet.
‘What about you, Feng?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Why didn’t you try to stop me?’
‘I’ve been trying to restrain myself from blaming you for what’s happened,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘I don’t know why you should pick on me.’
Grandmother Jia’s laughter was echoed by the others present.
‘Oh? Now this is interesting. I should like to know why you think I’m to blame for
what has happened.’
‘You shouldn’t be so good at training your girls,’ said Xi-feng. ‘When you’ve brought
up a beautiful young bulrush like Faithful, can you blame other people for wanting
her? It’s a good job I’m only your granddaughter-in-law. If I’d been your grandson, I
should have asked you for her for myself a long time ago. I shouldn’t have waited till
now, I can tell you!’
‘Oh,’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing.’ So it’s all my fault, is it?’
‘Of course it’s your fault,’ said Xi-feng.
‘In that case I won’t try to keep her,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You can take her back
with you.’
‘Not just now;’ said Xi-feng. ‘In my next life, perhaps. If a good girl in this life, I
might be reborn as a man, and I can ask you for her then!’
‘Go on, take her with you!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You can give her to your Lian.
See if that shameless father-in-law of yours still wants her then!’
‘Lian doesn’t deserve her,’ said Xi-feng. ‘All he’s fit for is a couple of sad old
dumplings like me and Patience!’
This set everyone laughing.
A maid came in to announce someone.
‘Lady Xing, ma’am.’
Lady Wang hurried out to meet her.
What followed will be revealed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 47

In pursuit of love the Oaf King takes a fearful beating
And from fear of reprisal the Reluctant Playboy makes a
hasty getaway



HEARING that Lady Xing had arrived, Lady Wang at once hurried out to meet her.
Lady Xing had come over to see if there had been any change in Faithful’s attitude.
She was ignorant of the fact that the secret was now out and that Grandmother Jia
knew everything. The first she heard of it was when quietly informed by some of
Grandmother Jia’s women as she entered the old lady’s courtyard. She would have
liked to turn back, but by then it was already too late: she had already been seen and
announced by the servants inside, and when her sister-in-law Lady Wang came out to
meet her, she was obliged to go in with her and pay her respects to Grandmother Jia.
Finding that her greetings were received by the old lady in stony silence, she was
covered with shame and confusion.
By this time Xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and Faithful had
gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone. Fearing that their presence
might add to Lady Xing’s embarrassment, Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the rest also, one
after another, withdrew. When she saw that she and Lady Xing were alone together,
Grandmother Jia at last broke her silence.
‘I hear you have been playing the matchmaker for your husband,’ she said. ‘I must
congratulate you on your wifely virtue though I must say, I think that in this case you
are carrying wifeliness a little far. You have children and grand-children of your own
now: why should you be frightened of his temper still at your age? Yet they tell me
that you positively encourage his excesses.
Lady Xing blushed crimson with embarrassment.
‘I have tried several times to dissuade him, without suc?cess. I am sure you must
realize that I have acted against my will in this matter.’
‘You did what you were told, all the same,’ said Grandmother Jia sharply. ‘Would
you do what you were told if he asked you to kill someone? Just reflect for a moment.
There is only your sister-in-law, poor, simple soul—she is always ailing from
something or other—to worry about the responsi?bilities of this household. It’s true
that she has Lian’s wife to help her, hut she has so much to do that she hardly knows
which way to turn—always “putting the rake down to pick up the broom”. And I have
to cut down on all my activities nowadays. So if there is ever anything that your
sister-in-law and Feng have overlooked, Faithful is the only one left to make sure that
my needs are attended to. She is a child who notices things. If she sees that I lack
something, she will either ask for it herself or have a word with one of the other two
and make sure that I get it. Think of all the hundreds and thousands of things there
are to be done in this household. If I hadn’t got Faithful, how could the other two
avoid overlooking some?thing once in a while? So what would you have me do then?
Would you expect me to start worrying about all these things myself? Should I have
to start calculating what I needed every day and go running off to the other two to
ask them for it? Of all the girls I’ve ever had, Faithful is the only one left me now who
is a bit older and more responsible than the rest—who understands my little ways
and knows how I like things done. There’s a genuine bond between us—for example,
she would never take advantage of our relationship, as some girls would, to ask other
people for clothes or money for herself. One consequence 6f this is that not only
Feng and your sister-in-law, but everyone else in the household, from the highest
down to the lowest, is able to trust her. It means that quite apart from the fact that I
have someone I can rely on, Feng and -your sister-in-law are saved a great deal of
worry; because with a girl like that to look after me, I don’t suffer when they
occasionally forget something, and that keeps me in a good temper. If Faithful were
to leave me now, who would you get for me to put in her place? And even if you
could find such a jewel, she’d need to have a tongue in her head too. She’d be no use
to me if she didn’t have my Faithful’s gift for expressing herself. As a matter of fact
I’ve been think?ing of sending someone round to your husband to tell him that if he
would care to buy himself a girl, he’d be very welcome to do it with my money. I
don’t mind if it costs me eight thousand—ten thousand even—but if it’s this girl of
mine he wants, I’m afraid he can’t have her. Tell him that if he wants to be a dutiful
son, he’ll be doing more for me by leaving me my Faithful, to serve me during the
few years that yet remain, than if he were to come over and wait on me in person,
morn?ing, noon and night. It’s turned out very conveniently, your coming over just
now: you’ll be able to take this message back to him yourself and I can be sure of its
being properly delivered.’
She called for the servants.
‘What’s happened to everybody? We were just in the middle of a nice chat when
suddenly everyone went away.’
The maids, with answering cries, went off to look for the others. Soon all had been
reassembled except Aunt Xue, who showed some resistance to the summons.
‘I’ve only just got back,’ she said. ‘What’s the point of going out again?’
‘Have a heart, Mrs Xue I’ said the maid. ‘Her Old Ladyship is in a passion. If you
don’t come, no one else will ever shift her out of it. If it’s the walking that bothers
you, I’ll carry you there on my back I’
‘Get along with you, little monkey I’ said Aunt Xue, laugh?ing. ‘A few hard words
won’t hurt you.’
She went with the maid nevertheless. On her arrival she was cordially welcomed by
Grandmother Jia.
‘What shall we do?’ said the old lady. ‘Shall we play cards? Come and sit by me,
Mrs Xue. You haven’t had much practice. If the two of us sit together, there will be
less chance of Feng confusing us.’
‘Yes,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You will have to keep an eye on my hand and help me out a bit.
Is it to be just the four of us, or shall we have one or two more?’
‘Just us four, surely?’ said Lady Wang.
‘No, let’s have one mote,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It will make it more interesting.’
‘Go and call Faithful, someone,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘She can sit below me. Mrs
Xue’s eyesight isn’t too good. Faithful will be able to keep an eye on both our hands.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘I know you can read and write,’ she said to Tan-chun. ‘I suppose you haven’t
learned how to tell fortunes too, by any chance ?’
‘What a strange question!’ said Tan-chun. ‘You should be concentrating all your
energies on winning some of Grandma’s money, not thinking about having your
fortune told.’
-’I thought you -might be able to tell me how much I’m going to lose today,’ said
Xi-feng. ‘No question of winning anything. Look how Grandma’s got me ambushed on
every side before we’ve even started playing!’
Presently Faithful arrived and sat in the place below Grandmother Jia. Xi-feng sat
below Faithful. A red blanket was spread over the table, the cards were shuffled, the
players cut for deal, and the game began.
After they had been playing for some minutes, Faithful noticed that Grandmother Jia
had a nearly full hand and only needed a Two of Coins to go out. She made a sign to
Xi-feng, whose turn it was to discard. Xi-feng pretended to be in great doubt as to
what she ought to play.
‘I’m sure Aunt Xue is hanging on to the card I want. I’d better let her have this one,
and then perhaps she’ll part with it.
‘I’m sure I haven’t got anything you want,’ said Aunt Xue,
‘I’d need to look at your hand before I believed that,’ said Xi-feng.
‘You’re very welcome to,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘Come on, now! Put that card down and
let’s see what it is.’
Xi-feng laid the card down in front of Aunt Xue: Two of Coins.
‘It’s no good to me,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘but I’ve an idea your grandmother may be
going out now.’
‘Oh, no I’ cried Xi-feng in mock dismay. ‘It’s a mistake. I didn’t mean to discard that
one.’
But Grandmother Jia, with a crow of triumph, had already thrown down her cards.
‘You dare take that back! You shouldn’t make mistakes!’
‘I told you I needed a fortune-teller,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Well, I played the card, so I
suppose I’ve no one but myself to blame.’
‘I should think so too!’ said Grandmother Jia. Give yourself a good hard slap on the
face if you want to know where the fault lies!’ She turned to Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t
think
I’m grasping, Mrs Xue. I don’t play for -the money; but I do so enjoy winning!’
‘Of course,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘No one would be so idiotic as to suppose that you
played for the money. Hearing this, Xi-feng, who had meanwhile been counting out
the money she had lost, abruptly stopped, and threaded the coins back onto the
string.
‘Right!’ she said, speaking to the others present. ‘That settles it! She doesn’t play
for the money, she just enjoys winning. Well I am mean and grasping, I’m afraid, and
when I lose, I like to know how much. But if that’s the way she feels, back it all goes
again!’
When Grandmother Jia played cards it was her unvarying custom to let Faithful
shuffle for her. She had been talking to Aunt Xue throughout Xi-feng’s bit of by play,
but broke off when he became aware that Faithful had made no move. ‘Come child,’
she said. ‘You’re not too upset to shuffle for me, are you?’
Faithful took up the cards with a laugh. ‘No, only Mrs Lian hasn’t paid up yet.’
‘Oh, hasn’t she? ‘said Grandmother Jia. ‘She’ll be lucky if she gets away with that!’
She called one of the junior maids to her. ‘Take that string of cash from in front of
Mrs Lian and bring it here.’
The little maid did as she was bid -and laid the money on the table beside
Grandmother Jia.
‘Please let me have it back,’ Xi-feng pleaded, ‘—so that I can give you the right
amount.’ ‘Feng really is rather mean,’ said Aunt Xue jokingly. ‘It’s only a game, after
all.’
Xi-feng stood up and, laying a hand on Aunt Xue’s arm, pointed out to her the
wooden chest in which Grandmother Jia kept her money.
‘You see that, Aunt? I don’t know how much of my money has at one time or
another found its way in there. Before I’ve been playing half an hour, my money in
the chest begins calling to my money on the table to come and join it. All I have to do
now is wait until it’s called it all in, then the game will be over and Grannie will be in
a good temper again and I shall be able to go and get on with my work.’
By the time she had finished -saying this, Grandmother Jia and all the others present
were laughing. They were still laughing when Patience, fearing that her mistress
might have insufficient money by her, came in bringing another string of cash.
‘Don’t put it down in front of me,’ Xi-feng told her. ‘Put it down beside Her Old
Ladyship, so that all my money can go into the chest together. We don’t want the
money in the chest to have to go through the -business of calling for it all over again.’
This made Grandmother Jia laugh so much that she scat?tered the cards she was
holding all over the table.
‘Tear her mouth!’ she said to Faithful, giving her a playful push.
Patience laid the money down as she was bidden, and after laughing a while with the
others, went out again. On her way out of the courtyard she ran into Jia Lian, who
was just about to enter the gate.
‘Where’s Lady Xing?’ he asked her. ‘Sir She has sent me to look for her.’
‘She’s been standing in there with Her Old Ladyship for the last half hour,’ said
Patience. She hasn’t dared to move yet, but I dare say she’ll get away as soon as she
can. Her Old Ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning, but thanks to the
Mistress, who’s been all this time humouring her, she’s gradually beginning to calm
down a bit.’
 ‘Oh well, when I go in I shall say that I’ve come to find out if Her Old Ladyship is
going to Lai Da’s place on the four?teenth, so that I know whether or not to have the
carriages ready,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I can mention that Lady Xing is wanted as an
afterthought. And after that perhaps I shall stay on and chaff the old lady a bit for a
few minutes. That should he all right, shouldn’t it?’
‘If you’re asking my opinion, I think you’d do much better not to go in at all,’ said
Patience. ‘Everyone’s been in trouble with her today even Her Ladyship and Bao-yu. If
you go in now, you’ll walk straight into it.’
‘Oh, surely it’s all over now, isn’t it?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Surely she’s not going to start all
over again? It’s nothing to do with me, in any case. And Sir She did ask me to go and
fetch Mother myself. If he finds that I’ve sent someone else to do it, he’s in such a
bad temper already, that he’ll probably use that as an excuse to take it out on me.’
He began to go in, and Patience, to whom this sounded reasonable enough, turned
back and followed him in across the courtyard. Entering Grandmother Jia’s outer
door, Jia Lian crossed the reception room on tiptoe and peered into the inner room
at the back. He could see his mother standing there.
Xi-feng, who had sharper eyes than the rest, spotted him at once and made a sign to
him not to enter and another sign to Lady Xing indicating that she was wanted
outside. Lady Xing could not simply walk out, so she filled a cup with some tea and
set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. This caused the old lady to turn round; and
as Jia Lian chanced at that very moment to be looking in at the doorway and was
unable to withdraw his head in time, she caught a momentary
glimpse of him before he disappeared.
‘Who’s that outside?’ she said. ‘It looked like one of the boys peeping in there just
now.’
‘Yes’ said Xi-feng, quickly rising to her feet and going over to the doorway, ‘I
thought I saw someone’s shadow there just now.’
Jia Lian walked smiling into the room.
‘I’ve come to ask if you are going on the fourteenth, Grandma, so, that I shall know
whether to get the carriages ready or not.
‘In that case why didn’t you come in straight away,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘instead
of lurking around outside?’
‘I could see that you were playing cards,’ said Jia Lian with a somewhat artificial
smile. ‘I didn’t like to interrupt you. I was hoping to get my wife to come out so that I
could ask her.’
‘And what is there so extraordinarily urgent about this that you needed to ask her
now?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘If you’d waited until she got home, you could have
asked her all you wanted to then. Why this extraordinary conscientiousness all of a
sudden? Eavesdropping is what you were up to more likely, or spying for somebody
else. Whatever it was, you gave me a nasty turn, creeping around in that sneaky,
under?hand way. Disgusting creature! Your wife will be with me a long time yet
playing cards. Better get back to that Zhao Er woman while you have the chance and
carry on where you left off with your plans- for poisoning her!’
The others all laughed.
‘It was Bao Er’s wife, my old love, not Zhao Er’s,’ said Faithful, laughing.
‘That’s what I said, didn’t I?’ Grandmother Jia snapped. ‘Well, “Zhao” or “Bao” or
brown cow how can !be expected to remember such things? The very mention of
them makes me feel angry. There were three generations of the family above me
when I came to this household as a young bride, and now there are three
generations below me, and I’ve seen many shocking and many wicked and many
peculiar things during the fifty-four years since first I came here, but this sort of thing
is simply outside my experience. Now be off with you!’
Jia Lian bolted, not daring to say a word. Patience, who had been standing
meanwhile outside the window, quietly mocked him as he came out:
‘I told you so, but you wouldn’t listen. You walked straight into the net, didn’t you?’
Just at that moment Lady Xing came out.
‘This is all Father’s doing,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Now we have to face the consequences.’
‘Unfilial wretch!’ said Lady Xing. ‘Some people would die for their fathers, but
you—a few harmless words and you are already whining and complaining. What’s
the matter with you? You haven’t been hurt yet—though I should look out, if I were
you: Father’s been pretty angry these last few days.’
‘Come on, you must hurry back, Mother,’ said Jia Lian. ‘He sent me to fetch you a
long time ago.’
He saw his mother out of the main part of the mansion and round to Jia She’s
quarters next door. Lady Xing then gave her husband, in briefest possible outline, a
report of what had happened; and since it was now evident that nothing more could
be done about Faithful, Jia She had to put up with his mortification as best he could.
He did, however, from that day onwards, discontinue all duty calls on his mother on
the pretext of being ill. Lady Xing and Jia Lian were sent to make the mandatory calls
on her in his stead.
Meanwhile his agents scoured the market for likely girls. A suitable one was
eventually purchased for the sum of five hundred taels a seventeen-year-old girl
called Carmine, who was duly installed in his room. But that is another part of our
story.
The card-game continued until dinner-time, and it was not until after dinner that the
company finally broke up.
Of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record.

*

The fourteenth came. Before it was yet daylight, Lai Da’s wife came round once more
to renew her invitation. Grand?mother Jia responded enthusiastically and, taking
Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the young people along with her, spent a considerable part
of the day in the Lai family’s private garden.
Lai Da’s garden was not, of course, to be compared with Prospect Garden;
nevertheless it was spacious and well-made and among its pools, rocks, trees and
pavilions were to be found several features of striking interest or beauty.
The menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or ‘outer’ part of
the establishment included Xue Pan, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong and a number of
the more closely related members of the Jia clan outside the immediate family. Jia
She was conspicuously absent. Young Lai had also invited some of his office holding
colleagues and a few young men of good family as congenial company for the Jias.
One of these last was a young gentleman called Liu Xiang?lian whom Xue Pan had
met on some previous occasion and hankeringly remembered ever since. The
discovery that he was a keen amateur actor one, moreover, who specialized in
romantic roles had led Xue Pan to jump to the wrong conclusion and assume that he
must share the same ‘wind and moonlight’ proclivities as himself. Eager to make his
closer acquaintance but hitherto denied any opportunity of doing so, he was
overjoyed at finding him among the company on this occasion and consequently in a
state of excitement which rendered his behaviour extremely unpredictable.
Cousin Zhen had also heard of Liu Xiang-lian and admired him. Today, under pretext
of being a little drunk, he had taken the liberty of asking him to perform for them,
and Liu Xiang-lian, supported by the hired professional players, had obliged by
appearing on the stage in two operatic num?bers. When he rejoined the company,
Xue Pan took the oppor?tunity of moving over to his table and began plying him with
all sorts of questions and insinuations.
Liu Xiang-lian was a young man of excellent family who, having lost both his parents
in early youth, had failed to complete his education. He was of a dashing, impulsive
nature, impatient of niceties. His chief pleasures were exercising with spear or sabre,
drinking, and gambling; but he was not averse to gentler pastimes: he frequented the
budding groves and could play on both the flute and the zither. Because he was so
young and handsome, many who did not know him mistakenly supposed that, being
an actor, he must have the usual actor’s propensities. Lai Da’s son Lai Shang-rong had
been a good friend of his for years and it was only natural that he should invite him
on this occasion to help him enter?tain his guests. Under these circumstances Lin
Xiang-lian was prepared to put up with a certain amount of drunken horse-play; but
Xue Pan was too much for him, and soon his atten?tions were becoming so
distasteful that Xiang-lian resolved to leave at the earliest opportunity in -order to
escape from them. Before he could break away, however, Lai Shang-rong detained
him.
‘Bao-yu gave me a message for you just now. He said that though he saw you
briefly when he arrived, with so many other people around, be didn’t have a chance
of talking to you properly. He’s most anxious that you should stay on so that he can
talk to you afterwards. If you are really set on going, wait while I call him out and you
can have a word with him now. What you do after that is your own affair: I certainly
shan’t try to detain you.’ He called a waiter to him: ‘Look inside and get hold of one
of the old women. Tell her to have a quiet word with Master Bao to say that he’s
wanted here outside.’
After about the time it would take to drink a cup of tea in, Bao-yu appeared.
‘Here you are, Uncle Bao!’ said Lai Shang-rong when he had joined them. ‘I leave
Xiang-lian in your bands, I’ve got to go and look after my guests now.’
With that he left them.
Taking Xiang-lian by the hand, Bao-yu led him into a study at the side of the hall
where they sat down together.
‘Have you visited Qin Zhong’s grave recently?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Certainly I have,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘The other day I was out hawking with a few of
the others and happened to notice that we were only half a mile or so away from it.
It occurred to me that it might not have stood up to all that heavy rain we had in the
summer, so I left the others and went off to have a look. As a matter of fact it had
been washed away a bit; so the day after I got back I scraped a few hundred cash
together, went back first thing next morning, hired a couple of labourers, and got it
patched up again.’
‘That explains it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Last month, when the pods were beginning to form
on the lotuses in Prospect Garden, I picked ten of them and sent Tealeaf to offer
them at his grave. When he got back, I asked him if the rains had damaged it at all,
and he told me that not only had it not been damaged, but that it was in even better
condition than it had been the time before. I knew from that that some friend must
have been there recently and restored it. I wish I weren’t so cooped up all the time at
home. I can never do anything I want to by myself. The slightest move I make is sure
to be seen and reported, and either I’m physically prevented from going where I
want to or else lectured at until I promise not to go. It’s useless for me ever to say
that I’m going to do anything, because I know that I shan’t be allowed to. I can’t even
spend my own money in the way I want.’
‘This thing at least is something you don’t need to worry about,’ said Xiang-lian,
‘with me outside to look after it for you. Anyway, it’s the thought that counts. It’s
enough to know that you would do it yourself if you could. I’ve already put aside the
money for his anniversary on the first of next month. You know how broke I always
-am. I never have any savings because as soon as I’ve got any money I spend it all.
Well, this time I thought I’d better not take any chances, so I put some by well in
advance, so-as not to have to stretch my hands out helplessly when the time conies.’
‘I was going to send Tealeaf round to see you about that,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but you
never seem to be at home; and you’re such a rolling stone that no one ever knows
where to look for you.’
‘Don’t bother to try,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘This is a matter in which each of us does what
he can. Anyway, I shall be going away quite soon. It will probably be three or four
years before I come back again.’
‘Why?’ said Bao-yu in some agitation.
‘That’s something you’ll know -soon enough when the time comes. I must be going
now.’
‘Must you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I so seldom get a chance of seeing you. Can’t we leave
together in the evening?’
‘I’m afraid it’s that cousin of yours,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘The usual problem. If I stay any
longer, there’s sure to be some kind of trouble. I’d much better go now and avoid it.’
Bao-yu reflected for some moments.
‘Yes, I suppose in that case you’d better. Only, if you really and truly are going away
for a long time, do please let me know before you start. Please don’t just slip away
without telling me.’
His eyes brimmed over with tears.
‘Of course I’ll come and say good-bye to you,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘As long as you
promise not to tell anyone.’ He stood up to go. ‘You go in again now. Don’t try to see
me out.’
He left the study and made his way to the main gate: but there, unfortunately, was
the very person he was trying to avoid.
‘Who’s let my little Liu get away?’ Xue Pan bawled.
Xiang-lian’s eyes flashed angrily. In other circumstances he would have laid him out
there and then with a single blow of his fist; but reflecting that to do so now would
be inter?preted by the others as drunken brawling and would moreover be
embarrassing to his host, he restrained himself with some effort
Xue Pan, in whose besotted eyes he appeared as a coveted treasure that was moving
at last within his grasp, lurched towards him, smiling happily, and gripped him firmly
by the arm.
‘Where are you off to little pal?’
‘Just-going out for a stroll,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘I’ll be back again directly.’
‘It won’t be any more fun here without you,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Do stay a bit
longer—just to show me that you care for me, eh? If it’s business that’s taking you
away, don’t worry, leave it to me! I don’t care how important it is whether it’s a
career you’re after or making a pile—with me for a pal you’ll have no more to worry
about!’
Angered and revolted by his odious intimacy, Xiang-lian quickly thought of a plan for
disposing of him. Drawing him aside to a spot where they could not be overheard, he
pre?tended to question his sincerity.
‘Are you really so fond of me, or are you just pretending?’ Xue Pan was almost
beside himself. His eyes became tiny slits of pleasure:
‘How can you ask such a question, my dear? Pretending? May I die this instant if I
am!’
‘Good. This place here is not convenient. We’d better go in again now and sit with
the others for a bit. Then I’ll leave, and you can leave a bit after me and follow me
back to my place. We’ll make a night of it. I’ve got a couple of very nice little boys
there who’ve never been “out” before; so you needn’t bring anyone with you: all the
service we’ll need is there already.’
Xue Pan was by now so delighted that his drunkenness had already half left him.
‘Do you mean this?’
‘What a person!’ said Xiang-lian. ‘One opens one’s heart to you and you don’t trust
them.’
‘No, no, no,’ said Xue Pan hurriedly. ‘I trust you. I’m no fool. There’s only one thing,
though: I don’t know where you live. If you leave before I do, where am I to look for
you?’
‘My place is outside the North Gate,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘Do you think you can tear
yourself from home and spend a whole night outside the city?’
‘What do I need a home for if I’ve got you?’ said Xue Pan. ‘All right,’ said Xiang-lian.
‘I’ll wait for you on the bridge then, outside the North Gate. We’d better get back to
the party now. Don’t forget: wait a bit after I’ve gone before going yourself; then -no
one should suspect anything.’
‘Yes,’ said Xue Pan, ‘yes.’
The two of them then went in again and resumed their places. Xue Pan found waiting
difficult and kept his eyes constantly on Xiang-lian, watching for him to go. At the
same time he began, in joyous anticipation of the pleasures in store, to drink with
greater and greater abandon, not waiting for the wine to be offered, but stretching
out rudely to left and right of him and plying himself from the wine-kettles of his
neighbours. Soon he was very drunk indeed.
Xiang-lian now rose to go and succeeded in slipping out of the main gate unobserved.
First he gave an order to his page Almond, who was waiting there:
‘You go home now. I have some business outside the city to attend to. I’ll be back
later.’
Then he vaulted into the saddle and rode off until he came to the North Gate of the
city. Passing through, he rode on till he came to the bridge, where he halted and took
up his-station-to wait for Xue Pan’s arrival.
After the time it would take to eat a meal, he caught sight of Xue Pan hurrying along
in the distance. His mouth was open, his eyes were staring, and his head turned from
side to side as he looked anxiously about him, for all the world like one of those little
clapper drums that children twirl upon a stick. So intent was he on scanning the
remoter parts of the landscape that he failed to take note of what was nearer at hand
and rode right past Xiang-lian without seeing him. Xiang-lian, who for all his loathing
could not but laugh at this, gave his horse rein and followed after. Presently Xue Pan
began to notice that he was getting into the open country and brought his horse
round about. As he did so, he found himself almost face to face with Xiang-lian.
‘I knew you wouldn’t fall me,’ he cried delightedly.
Xiang-lian smiled back.
‘Let’s go on a bit further—just in case anyone is tracking us.’
He trotted on ahead and Xue Pan followed, keeping as close to him as he could.
Presently, having satisfied himself that the country ahead was quite deserted,
Xiang-lian dis?mounted near the edge of a reed-filled dyke and tied his horse up to a
tree.
‘You get down too,’ he called pleasantly to Xue Pan. ‘Let’s first swear an oath that if
either of us is unfaithful to the other or betrays our secret to anyone, it shall happen
to him as the oath shall say.’
‘Yes,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Good ideal’ He dismounted eagerly tied his horse to another
tree, and straightway knelt down and began his oath:
‘If ever, in the days to come, I prove unfaithful or betray this secret to another, may
Heaven and Earth destroy.’
He got no further. At that point there was a great thump and the sensation of being
hit on the back of the neck by an object like a large iron hammer. Everything became
suddenly black, except that the darkness was filled with a confusion of flying stars,
and he collapsed forwards helplessly upon the ground.
Xiang-lian stepped up and surveyed him from above. Someone not used to taking
punishment, he concluded. It would be unwise to use too much force on him.
Turning him over, he performed, with a few deft flicks over Xue Pan’s face, the
operation which is described in the profession as ‘opening up the fruits hop’.
At first Xue Pan struggled to get up, but Xiang-lian lashed out with his foot and sent
him sprawling once more upon his back.
‘You were willing, just as much as I was,’ Xue Pan muttered plaintively. ‘You had
only to say so if you weren’t. Why fool me into coming out here with you and then
beat me up?’
He began cursing him obscenely.
‘You blind iniquity!’ said Liu Xiang-lian. ‘You don’t know who you’re dealing with.
You should be begging for mercy right now, not swearing at me. You’re not worth
killing, though. I’ll just give you a little lesson.’
He picked up his horsewhip and turning Xue Pan on his face once more, proceeded to
deal him thirty or forty cuts along the length of-his body, from his shoulders down to
his calves. Xue Pan was by now half sober, and finding the pain un?bearable, began
to roar.
‘Look at you!’ said Xiang-lian contemptuously. ‘I should have thought you could
take your medicine a bit better than that.’
He took him by the left leg and dragged him a few steps to where the reeds began, in
the stagnant ooze of the dyke, so that he was coated from head to foot with the
liquid mud.
‘Now,’ he said, ‘do you know who I am?’
As Xue Pan merely lay in the mud whimpering and made no reply, he threw away his
whip and gave him a few thumps with his fist. Xue Pan rolled about and bellowed:
‘You’ve broken my ribs. I know you’re straight. It was the others who told me you
weren’t. I shouldn’t have listened to them.’
 ‘Leave the others out of this,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘I’m talking about now.’
‘Now?’ said Xue Pan. ‘Now I know you’re straight. I kn6w I was wrong. What more
can I say?’
‘You’ll have to talk a bit prettier than that before I’ve finished with you,’ said
Xiang-lian.
‘Old pal—’ Xue Pan began, whimpering.
Xiang-lian dealt him another thump with his fist.
‘Ow! Ow! Chap—’
Two thumps this time.
‘Ow! Ow! Sir, then. Please sir, forgive me for being so blind. From now on I shall
honour you and fear you.’
Now drink some of this water,’ said Xiang-lian. Xue Pan knitted his brows with
disgust:
‘But this water is really filthy. I couldn’t get it down.’
Xiang-lian raised his list threateningly. ‘I’ll drink,’ said Xue Pan hurriedly. ‘I’ll drink.’
He bent down and drank a mouthful of the water at the base of the reeds; but before
he could swallow it, there was a great retching noise and he vomited up all that he
had recently eaten and drunk.
‘Filthy pig!’ said Xiang-lian. ‘Now eat that up and I let you off’
Xue Pan began kotowing to him.
‘Please, for your soul’s sake, earn a bit of merit: don’t try to make me do that! I
couldn’t do that if you -killed me.’
‘This stench is poisoning me;’ said Xiang-lian; and leaving Xue Pan, he unfastened
his horse, led it off a few paces, vaulted into the saddle, and galloped away.
Observing with relief that Xiang-lian had really gone, Xue Pan, cursing his folly for
having been so egregiously mistaken in his man, attempted to struggle to his feet;
but every part of him was hurting so much that it was impossible for him to rise.

*

Meanwhile, back at the party, Cousin Zhen and the others, suddenly noticing that the
two of them were missing, sought them for a while without success. Someone did
say that they thought they might have gone out of the North Gate; but Xue Pan had
told his pages not to follow him, and they were all in such dread of their master that
none of them dared go out there to look. In the end Cousin Zhen became so uneasy
that he sent Jia Rong with some of the boys to track them down.
Their trail led them through the North Gate and about two thirds of a mile along the
road which crosses the bridge outside it. There, suddenly, they caught sight of Xue
Pan’s horse, tied up to one of the trees at the side of a reed-filled dyke.
‘Good!’ they said. ‘Where the horse is, the rider must be.’ And all of them went
over to where the horse was standing.
As they did so, they heard someone groaning among the rushes; and there, when
they went to look, was Xue Pan, his clothes torn, his face cut and swollen almost
beyond recognition, and so besmirched with mud from head to foot that he had
more the appearance of an old wallowing sow than of a human being.
Jia Rong had little difficulty in guessing what had happened. Slipping from his horse,
he ordered the servants to help Xue Pan to his feet.
‘Tireless in the pursuit of love, Uncle I’ he said cheerfully, while they struggled to
do his bidding. ‘This time it’s led you into the reeds of the marshes. I suppose the
Dragon King must have taken a fancy to you and carried you off to be his son-in-law.
To judge from appearances, I should say that you -must have got caught up on his
horn!’
Xue Pan wished that the earth would open and swallow up his shame.
As there was clearly no question of getting him onto his horse, Jia Rong told one of
the boys to hurry back to the street outside the North Gate and hire a carrying chair.
When Xue Pan had been helped into this, they had him carried into the city,
themselves accompanying him on horseback. Jia Rong mischievously proposed that
they should take him back to the Lais’ house to rejoin the party: but Xue Pan
entreated so piteously and begged him so earnestly not to tell anyone of his plight,
that Jia Rong relented and allowed him to go back home alone.
Jia Rong himself returned to the party to report back to his father. From his account
of the state Xue Pan had been in when they found him Cousin Zhen deduced that he
must have been beaten up by Liu Xiang-lian but appeared remarkably unconcerned,
for he merely laughed and observed that ‘he could do with the lesson’. It is true that
he went to inquire after him in the evening, when he got back home from the party;
but Xue Pan was by that time nursing his injuries in bed and declined to see him on
the grounds that he was feeling too ill.
When Grandmother Jia and her party had got back to their several apartments, Aunt
Xue and Bao-chai found Caltrop with her eyes all swollen from weeping. On
discovering the cause, they rushed in to look at Xue Pan. Fortunately he appeared to
have no bones broken, but his face and body had taken a terrible battering. Torn
between maternal anguish at his plight and anger at the folly which had occasioned it,
Aunt Xue inveighed against Xue Pan and Xiang-lian by turns. She wanted to tell Lady
Wang and get her to have Xiang-lian arrested, but was dissuaded from doing so by
Bao-chai.
‘It’s not important enough for that, Mamma. The two of them had been drinking
and fell out over their cups, that’s all there was to it. Whenever that happens, it’s
always the drunker of the two who gets the worst of it. Besides, every?one knows
what a lawless, ungovernable creature Pan is. It’s only because you’re his mother
that you feel differently. If it’s satisfaction you want, that can easily be arranged. Just
wait a few days until Pan is better and can get about again. I’m sure Mr Zhen and Mr
Lian and the other menfolk will be unwilling to pass over this in silence. Probably
they will get up a little party and ask this person to it and make him apolo?gize to Pan
in front of everyone and admit that he was to blame. But if you insist on making an
issue of it now and telling Aunt about it, you will make it appear that you are so blind
to Pan’s faults that you allow him to go around provoking other people, but that as
soon as someone stands up to him, you fly up in arms and use our relations’
influence to oppress them.’
Aunt Xue at once saw the force of this.
‘You are quite right, my child. I was being silly.’
‘Dear Mamma! But now you are being sensible. He doesn’t fear you, and he won’t
listen to anyone else. He just goes on getting worse and worse. One or two good,
sharp shocks like this might bring him to his senses.’
Meanwhile Xue Pan lay on the kang in his bedroom, cursing Xiang-lian by every name
he could think of and calling on his boys to smash up his house, to beat him to death,
to have the law on him. Aunt Xue shouted to them that they were to do no such
thing. To Xue Pan she explained that Xiang-lian was in any case beyond the reach of
his vengeance.
‘Xiang-lian behaved very bad because he was drunk. When he came to himself
afterwards he was very sorry; and now, because he is afraid of the consequences, he
has fled the coun?try.’
When Xue Pan heard that, he—
But you shall learn that (if you wish) in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 48

The Love Deluded One turns his thoughts to trade and travel
And the Poetry Enthusiast applies herself to making verses



XUE PAN gradually calmed down when his mother told him that Xiang-lian had fled.
After four or five days the pain of his injuries had subsided, but not the bumps and
bruises; and as, while these still dis?figured him, he was unwilling to meet any of his
acquaintance, he kept to his room on the pretext that he was still too ill to go out.
The tenth month soon came. Several of the employees work?ing in Xue Pan’s shops
in the capital wanted to go back home for the annual settling of accounts and Xue
Pan found himself giving a farewell party for them in his room. Among those present
was one Zhang De-hui, the sixty-year-old manager of his largest pawnshop. He had
worked with the family since he was a lad and now had a household of his own and
an income of two or three thousand taels. He was planning to leave with the others
but not return until half way through the following year, as he explained to Xue Pan
on this occasion.
‘There’s a great shortage of stationery and perfumed goods just now,’ he said.
‘These things are sure to fetch high prices next year. I’m proposing to send my eldest
boy here after New Year to look after the shop, so that I can travel back later. I shall
buy up supplies of stationery and sandalwood fans on my way, aiming to get back
here in time for the Double Fifth. I reckon it should be possible to make several
hundred percent profit, even after the excise and all the other expenses have been
deducted.’
This gave Xue Pan an idea.
‘I haven’t felt like seeing anyone since that beating,’ he thought, ‘and some excuse
for getting away from every?body for a year or so is just what I’ve been looking for.
Obviously I can’t go on staying indoors and pretending I’m ill indefinitely. And for
another thing, I haven’t done very much with my life to date: I’m neither a scholar
nor a soldier, and though I call myself a merchant, I’ve never handled a pair of scales
or an abacus in my life, not to mention the fact that I know nothing about the places
and peoples of the Empire or its roads and waterways. Why don’t I get a bit of capital
together and spend a year or so travelling around with Zhang De-hui? It won’t matter
much whether I make any money or not; the main thing is that it will get me away
from my disgrace; and there is the added advantage that I shall be able to put in a bit
of sight-seeing as well.’
Having so decided, he waited until the other guests had gone and then, making
himself as agreeable as he knew how, informed Zhang De-hui of his decision and
asked him to delay his departure by a few days so that he would have time to
prepare.
That evening he told his mother.
Aunt Xue’s initial reaction was one of pleasure, but this quickly gave way to
misgivings. It was not that she attached much importance to the loss of a little capital;
she was con?cerned about the scrapes he might get into away from home. And so
she ended up by refusing.
‘I think you’d better stay here with me. I should worry less. After all, you don’t need
to make this money. It isn’t as if you haven’t got enough to spend.’
But Xue Pan had made his mind up and was not to be put off.
‘You’re always telling me how inexperienced I am and how ignorant and how
unwilling to learn; yet now that I’m making a real effort to turn over a new leaf by
standing on my own feet at last and learning a bit about the business, you won’t let
me. What do you want me to do? I’m not a girl, to be shut up at home all the time:
you’ll have to let me out some time or other. Besides, Zhang De-hui is an old,
experienced person and he’s worked for our family all his life. If I’m with him, I don’t
see how anything can go wrong. Even if I did ever slip up, I’m sure he’d soon tell me
off about it and put me right. And as he knows all there is to know about prices and
so forth, I should naturally always consult him on business matters. You couldn’t ask
for better conditions; yet you won’t let me go. Very well, I’ll get ready in secret and
leave without telling you. You’ll see me when I come back next year, after making a
fortune! I’ll show you!’
With that he went off to bed in a huff.
Aunt Xue discussed the matter with Bao-chai after he had gone.
‘It’s good that he should want to occupy himself with something serious at last,’
said Bao-chai. ‘The trouble is, of course, that however fair-sounding his intentions
may be now, once he’s outside he may succumb to his old weaknesses again, and
then it will be that much more difficult to control him. However, I suppose that is a
risk one has to take. If he is really going to reform, then this experience may prove a
life-long blessing. If he is not, I don’t see that there is very much left that you can do.
After all, there is only so much one can do for another person: the rest must be left
to Heaven. Pan is a grown man now, Mamma. If you maintain that he is too ignorant
of the world to be allowed out into it, you are not going to make him any less
ignorant by keeping him shut up indoors. And since he is being so reasonable for
once, I should make up your mind that you are going to lose eight or nine hundred
taels and hand it over to him to see how he manages. After all, he will have someone
from our own business helping him and they may well feel some compunc?tion
about cheating him; so it’ s by no means a foregone conclusion that he will lose it all.
And for another thing, away from home there won’t be those worthless companions
of his to egg him on; nor, on the other hand, will he have anyone to fall back on if he
gets into trouble. He will have to fend for himself: eat when he can and go hungry
when he can’t. And when it dawns on him that he is on his own and has no one he
can lean on, he may begin to behave a bit better. Surely it’s worth trying?’
Aunt Xue pondered her daughter’s words for some minutes.
‘I think you are probably right,’ she said eventually. ‘I certainly don’t mind using
up some of our money on the experiment. If he can learn a bit of sense from it, it will
have been money well-spent.’
Having thus concluded their discussion, the two of them went to bed.
Next day Aunt Xue had Zhang De-hui invited round once more, and while he was
being entertained by Xue Pan in the study, stationed herself in the loggia at the back
and, address?ing him through the window from this hidden vantage point, entrusted
her boy, with many a fond and careful instruction, to his care. Zhang De-hui gave
vigorous assurances of good intent, and having finished his meal, stood up and took
his leave, stopping on his way out to add a few words to Xue Pan about arrangements
for their departure:
‘The almanac says the fourteenth is the best day for travel?ling. I should start
packing and hiring mules straight away if I were you, Mr Xue, so that we can make a
start first thing on the fourteenth.’
Xue Pan, delighted at the prospect of getting away so soon, hastened to relay this to
his mother.
Assisted by Bao-chai, Caltrop and a couple of old nannies, Aunt Xue devoted the
whole of the next few days to packing. She selected five male members of the
domestic staff to ac?company Xue Pan on his travels: the husband of his o1d wet
nurse, two experienced older servants who had been in service with his father, and
two of the pages who normally waited on him. Three heavy carts were hired for the
luggage and four travelling mules. Xue Pan himself planned to ride on a mule from his
own stables—a large, sturdy animal with an iron-grey coat. He also planned to take a
saddle-horse of his own as an alternative mount. When all other preparations had
been completed, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai devoted the remaining evenings to
exhortation and admonishment of the prospective traveller.
On the thirteenth Xue Pan went to take leave of his Uncle Wang’s family in the city,
after which he went round the two mansions saying his good-byes to the Jias. There
was some talk of Cousin Zhen and one or two of the others seeing him off next day
for a parting cup on the road; but whether or not anything came of it our narrative
does not disclose.
Early on the morning of the fourteenth Aunt Xue and Bao-chai accompanied him to
the outer threshold of the inner gate and watched him with tearful eyes until they
could see him no more.

*

When Aunt Xue moved from Nanking to the capital, she had brought only four or five
couples with her in addition to the handful of old nannies and young unmarried
maids of her immediate household. Now that five of the menfolk had gone off to
accompany Xue Pan on his travels, only one or two male servants were left. The very
day that Xue Pan started on his journey, Aunt Xue went into his study, had all the
small fur?niture, blinds, curtains and other movables carried out and stored in her
own apartment, and ordered the wives of the absent menservants to move in with
her to sleep. She also ordered Caltrop to tidy up Xue Pan’s sleeping quarters, lock the
door, and move - into her apartment with the rest.
‘But Mamma,’ Bao-chai protested, ‘you’ve already got all those others to keep you
company. Why not let Caltrop move in with me? It gets lonely in the Garden now that
the nights are longer: another companion to sit with me in the evenings when I am
sewing would be very welcome.’
‘Of course,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I was forgetting. I should have thought of it myself. I was
telling Pan only the other day: Apricot is so young and scatter-brained and Oriole on
her own really isn’t enough for you. We really ought to buy you another girl.’
‘Buying is all very well if you know what the girl is going to be like,’ said Bao-chai;
‘but if you make a bad choice, then not only have you wasted your money—that’s a
small consideration—but you have a very great deal of trouble on your hands. If we
are going to buy a girl, it would be much better to take our time over the inquiries
and not get one until we are quite sure about her background.
She told Caltrop to get her bedding and toilet things to?gether and ordered Advent
and one of the old nannies to carry them for her to Allspice Court. Then she and
Caltrop went into the Garden together.
‘I was dying to ask the Mistress if she would let me move in with you after Mr Xue
had gone,’ said Caltrop, ‘but I was afraid she might think I only wanted to get into the
Garden to play. How wonderful that you should have asked her for me!’
‘I knew you’d had your heart set on this Garden for some time past,’ said Bao-chai
with a smile, ‘but you haven’t really been free till now. Dashing in and out for a few
minutes each day wouldn’t have given you time to enjoy it properly. That’s why I
have waited for this opportunity before asking. Now you will be able to settle in and
spend a whole year here. You get your wish, you see, and I gain a companion!’
‘Dear Miss!’ said Caltrop ‘Now that there is the time and the opportunity, will you
teach me how to write poetry, please?’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘You’re like the -famous general: “one conquest breeds appetite for another”. I
advise you to take things more gently. Today is your first day in the Garden. If I were
you, I should go out of that corner gate and, beginning with Lady Jia’s, call in at all the
different apartments and pay your respects to everybody. You needn’t go Out of your
way to tell them that you have moved into the Garden; but if the subject should
happen to arise, tell them that I have brought you in as my companion. After that,
when you get back into the Garden, you ought to go round and call on all the young
ladies.’
Caltrop was just going oft to do as Bao-chai advised, when Patience came hurrying in.
She was in a state of some agita?tion, which she smilingly masked, however, in
response to Caltrop’s eager greetings.
‘I’m bringing her in here to live with me as my companion,’ Bao-chai explained. ‘I
was just about to report the matter to your mistress.’
‘You don’t need to do that, Miss!’ said Patience. ‘What?ever next?’
‘On the contrary,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s the correct thing to do. “Every inn has its
landlord and every temple its priest,” as they say. Even though it is not a very
important matter, I think I should report it, if only so that the women on night watch
may know that there are two more girls—her and Advent—living in the Garden now,
and make no difficulties about letting them in and out. Anyway, if you will tell your
mistress when you get back, I won’t bother to send anyone about it myself.’
Patience promised that she would.
‘Now you’re here,’ she said to Caltrop, ‘you ought -to go and introduce yourself to
your new neighbours.’
‘I was just sending her off to do that when you came,’ said Bao-chai.
‘Well, you can leave nr out,’ Patience told Caltrop. ‘Mr Lian is ill at home in bed.’
Caltrop murmured a reply and went off to make her calls, beginning with
Grandmother Jia.
As soon as she had gone, Patience -seized Bao-chai’s hand and asked her, in a low
and urgent voice, whether she had heard ‘their’ news.
‘No,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I’ve been so busy these last few days helping to get Pan off that
I haven’t heard anyone’s news. I haven’t even seen any of the girls during the past
day or two.’
‘Sir She has beaten Mr Lian so badly that he can hardly move. Do you mean to say
you haven’t even heard that?’
‘I heard something to that effect,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I didn’t know whether to
believe it or not. I’d been thinking of going to ask your mistress about it when you
came in just now. What did he beat him for?’
‘It was that toad Jia Yu-cun’s doing,’ said Patience bitterly. ‘Horrible man! It was a
bad day for this family when they got to know him. I don’ t know how much trouble
he hasn’t stirred up in the few years since first he came here. Last spring Sir She saw
some antique fans somewhere which so impressed him that when he got home and
looked at his own collection he decided that they were all no good and at once sent
every?one scouring around for some mote. Now there was a certain poor, unlucky
devil they call “Stony”—that’s a nickname, of course: I don’t know what his real
name is—so hard up that he never had enough to eat but who, it go happened, was
the owner of a collection of twenty antique fans that he guarded very closely, not
even allowing them to be taken out of his door. Mr Lian had a terrible job even
getting to see this man. In the end he did though, and eventually, after a great deal of
persuasion, managed to get himself invited into the house to have a look at the fans.
Mr Lian said he was only allowed a glimpse of them even then, but he said you could
see at once that they were the kind of fans that simply can’t be had anywhere today.
The fansticks were made of very special kinds of bamboo—naiad’s tears, black
bamboo, fawnskin and jadewood—and the paintings on them were all by old masters.
When he told Sir She about them, Sir She said at once that come what may he must
have them and that Stony could name his price. But Stony didn’t want a price not if
they offered him a thousand taels a fan, he said. He said he would rather die of
hunger and cold than sell them. There was nothing Sir She could do about that, of
course, except swear all the -time at Mr Lian for being “incompetent”. But I ask you,
Miss: Mr Lian had already promised five hundred taels cash down and still old Stony
had refused, so what more was there he could do? The matter might have rested
there if that black-hearted villain Jia Yu-cun hadn’t got to hear about it. He soon
thought of a way. He made out that Stony owed the government some money, had
him hauled off to the yamen, and when he got there, told him they would have to
detrain on his property to pay off the debt. Then he sent his officers round to Stony’s
house, seized the fans, valued them at a government price, and sent them to Sir She
as a present. Poor old Stony! I don’t know whether he’s alive now or dead. What I do
know is that when Sir She was telling Mr Lian how he had come by the fans at last,
Mr Lian couldn’t help remarking that he didn’t see anything very “competent” about
ruining a man and stripping him of all he possessed for so trifling a reason. That
made Sir She very angry, because of course he assumed that Mr Lian was really
getting at him. That was the main reason for the beating; but then there were a
number of smaller things a few days later—I don’t even remember now what they
were. They seem to have brought things to a head, because he suddenly went for
him. He didn’t pull him down and beat him with a flat-stick or a cudgel in the normal
way either: he just picked up the first thing that came to hand—I don’t know what it
was—and started hitting him with it where he stood. He cut his face open in two
places. We heard that Mrs Xue has got some kind of lotion for injur?ies of this sort
and I wondered if you’d mind letting me have a tablet.’
Bao-chai at once sent Oriole for the tablets and told her to bring two of them.
‘I won’t go and see your mistress now, under the circum?stances,’ she said, when
she handed them to Patience. ‘Give her my regards, though, won’t you?’
Patience thanked her and left.

*

Our story returns now to Caltrop. After dinner, by which time she had finished
making her calls, while Bao-chai went to join Bao-yu and the others in Grandmother
Jia’s apartment, Caltrop went off on her own to visit the Naiad’s House.
Dai-yu was by this time well on the way to recovery. She seemed so delighted to hear
that Caltrop had moved into the Garden, that Caltrop felt emboldened to make her a
request:
‘Now that I’m here and have got more time to spare, do you think you could teach
me .to write poetry? It would be such a piece of luck for me if you would.’
‘You can make your kotow and become my pupil if you like;’ said Dai-yu
goodnaturedly. ‘I’m no expert myself, but I dare say I could teach you the rudiments.’
Would you really?’ said Caltrop. ‘Then I’ll be your dis?ciple. But you must promise
not to get impatient with me.’
‘There’s nothing in it really,’ said Dai-yu ‘There’s really hardly anything to learn. In
Regulated Verse there are always four couplets: the “opening couplet”, the
“developing couplet”, the “turning couplet” and the “concluding couplet”. In the two
middle couplets, the “developing” and “turning” ones, you have to have
tone-contrast and parallel?ism. That’s to say, in each of those couplets the even
tones of one line have to contrast with oblique tones in the other, and vice versa, and
the substantives and non-substantives have to balance each other though if you’ve
got a really good, ori?ginal line, it doesn’t matter all that much even if the
tone-contrast and parallelism are wrong.’
‘Ah, that explains it I’ said Caltrop, pleased. ‘I’ve got an old poetry-book that I look
at once in a while when I can find the time, and I long ago noticed that in some of the
poems the tone-contrast is very strict, while in others it’s not. Someone told me the
rhyme:
         For one, three and five
         You need not strive;
         But two, four and six
         You must firmly fix.
and at first that seemed to explain the exceptions. But then I found that in some old
poems even the second, fourth and sixth syllables seemed to have -the wrong tones,
and I’ve been puzzling about it ever since. Now, from what you’ve just said, it sounds
as if these rules really aren’t important after all—that the most important thing is
that the language should be original.’
‘You’ve hit it exactly 1’ said Dai-yu. ‘As a matter of fact even the language isn’t of
primary importance. The really important things are the ideas that lie behind it. If the
ideas behind it are genuine, there’s no need to embellish the language for the poem
to be a good one. That’s what they mean when they talk about “not letting the words
harm the meaning
‘I love that couplet by Lu You,’ said Caltrop:
‘Behind snug curtained doors the incense lingers;
The well-worn concave patch the ground ink settles.
That’s genuine, isn’t it? So vivid.’
‘Good gracious! You mustn’t go reading that sort of stuff!’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s only
because of your lack of experience that you can think shallow -stuff like that any
good. Once you get stuck into that rut, you’ll never get out of it. You do as I tell you.
I’ve got the Collected Works of Wang Wei here. You take a hundred of Wang Wei’s
pentasyllabic poems in Regulated Verse and read and re-read them, carefully
pondering what you read, until you are thoroughly familiar with them all. After that
read a hundred or two of Du Fu’s Regulated Verse heptasyllabics and a hundred or
two of Li Bo’s heptasyllabic quatrains; then, with a firm foundation of those three
poets inside you, if you go on to look at some of the earlier poets like Tao Yuan-ming,
Xie Ling-yun, Ruan ji, Yu Xin and Bao Zhao, with your quickness and intelligence you
should have no difficulty in turning yourself into a fully-fledged bard within less than
a twelvemonth.’
‘In that case,’ said Caltrop excitedly, ‘dear Miss Lin, would you please lend me that
book you mentioned, so that I can take it back with me and study it before I go to
bed?’
Dai-yu told Nightingale to fetch down the volume of Regular Pentasyllabics from the
Collected Works of Wang Wei.
‘Read the ones I’ve marked with red circles,’ she said, handing the book to Caltrop.
‘They are my own selection. Just work your way through them gradually, taking each
one as it comes. If you have any difficulties, you can either ask Miss Bao about them
or else get me to explain them to you next time you see me.’
Caltrop carried the book back with her to Allspice Court, and sitting down under the
lamp, began reading -the poems, oblivious to all around her. Bao-chai made several
attempts at making her go to bed, but in the end, impressed by such total absorption,
gave up and left her alone.

*

Next morning, just as Dai-yu had completed her toilet, a smiling Caltrop walked in,
holding out the volume of Wang Wei and asking to exchange it for a volume of Du
Fu’s hepta?syllabics.
‘How many of them do you think you can remember? Dai-yu asked her.
‘I’ve been through all the ones marked with red circles,’ said Caltrop.
‘And do you think you have ‘learnt anything from them?’ ‘I think so,’ said Caltrop.
‘Though I can-’t be sure. Perhaps you can tell me.’
‘Certainly,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Discussion is what I was hoping for. it is the only way of
making progress. Tell me what you think they have taught you.’
‘Well,’ said Caltrop, ‘as I see it, poetry is very good at saying things which you can’t
exactly explain but which leave a very vivid impression in your mind; also it often says
things which at first seem illogical but are quite logical and natural when you stop to
think about them.’
‘That sounds very perceptive,’ said Dai-yu. ‘What about giving an example or two of
what you mean?’
‘Take that third couplet from his poem “On the Frontier”,’ said Caltrop:

        ‘Over a lone fire the straight smoke hangs;
        In the long river the round sun sets.

Now how can smoke really be “straight”? And why “the round sun”? Of course the
sun is round! Yet when you close the book and start thinking about those lines, the
scene they de scribe is so vivid that it’s almost as though you had been there. And if
you ask yourself what other two words be could have used instead of “straight” and
“round”, you realize that there aren’t any. Then again, in a couplet from another of
his poems:
         When the sun sets, the water whitens;
         When the tide rises, all the world is green.


“Whitens” and “green” at first seem like nonsense; but when you start thinking
about it, you realize that he had to use those two words in order to describe the
scene exactly as it was. When you read those lines out loud, the flavour of them is so
concentrated that it’s as though you had an olive weigh?ing several -thousand catties
inside your mouth! And there’s another couplet of his:

        Down by the ford the late sun lingers;
        Over the village a smoke-thread climbs.


“Lingers” and “climbs”: so simple, but so clever! I remember that year we came up
to the capital we moored the boat one evening towards dusk in a very lonely stretch
of country with only a few trees on the bank and a few houses far away in the
distance from which the blue smoke of peasants cook?ing their evening meal was
rising high, high into the clouds. When I read this couplet last night, it suddenly took
me back to that very spot.’
Bao-yu and Tan-chun had come in while she was talking and quietly sat down to
listen. Bao-yu was impressed.
‘To judge by what you’ve just said, you don’t need to read any more poetry. The
Emperor Jian-wen once remarked that “appreciation needs not to seek far afield”.
From your dis?cussion of that last couplet, I should say that you have already reached
the samādhi!’
‘Actually, although you won’t know this yet,’ said Dai-yu, ‘that “smoke-thread
climbs” line you admire so much is based on a line written by an earlier poet. If I
show it to you, I think you will agree that it is even more austerely effective than
Wang Wei’s line.’
She took down a copy of Tao Yuan-ming’s Works, hunted out the couplet she had in
mind, and handed it to her to look at:

         Half-lost in haze the distant haunts of men,
         Whose dawdling smoke the unseen hamlet marks.

Caltrop read it and nodded approvingly:
Yes, I see. He got the idea for “climbs” from the “dawd?ling” of this earlier line.’
Bao-yu laughed delightedly.
‘Perfect! You must end your discussion there. If you go on any longer, you’ll begin
unlearning what you’ve already dis?covered. You can start writing poetry yourself
now, straight away. It’s sure to be good.’
‘I can see I shall soon be writing an invitation asking you to join our poetry club,’
said Tan-chun smilingly.
Don’t make fun of me, Miss Tan,’ said Caltrop. ‘Writing poetry is something I’ve
always wanted to do, and now I’ve got the chance, I’m learning for the fun of it. I
don’t expect I shall ever be any good.’
‘Good heavens! we only write for the fun of it ourselves,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You surely
don’t imagine that what we write is good poetry? If we set ourselves up to be real
poets, people outside this Garden who got to hear of it would laugh so loud that
their teeth would drop out!’
‘That’s what Mencius calls “throwing yourself away”,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You shouldn’t
do that. The other day, when I was discussing Xi-chun’s painting with some of
Father’s gentlemen, they told me they had heard about our poetry club and asked if
they could see some of our poems, so I wrote a few out for them from memory. I
assure you, they were genuinely impressed. In fact, they have calligraphed them for
blocks to have them printed.’
‘Is this really true?’ Tan-chun and Dai-yu asked incredu?lously.
‘If anyone’s telling lies, it must be the parrot;’ said Bao-yu.
The two girls were aghast.
‘You really are the limit! Quite apart from the fact that the poems aren’t good
enough, you have no business to go showing our stuff to people outside.’
‘What’s the harm?’ said Bao-yu. ‘If those famous poems written by poetesses in
days gone by had never been -taken outside -the women’s quarters, we shouldn’t
know about them today.’
Just then Xi-chun’s maid Picture arrived and called Bao-?yu away to her mistress.
Caltrop pressed Dai-yu to lend her the volume of Du Fu; she also begged Dai-yu and
Tan-chun to set her a subject for a poem.
‘Let me try my hand at writing one myself,’ she said, ‘-and you can correct it for
me.’
‘Last night there was a very fine moon,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ve been thinking of writing a
poem about it myself, but haven’t yet got round to it. Why don’t you write a poem
about the moon? You can use “sky” and “light” as your rhymes; but I won’t set the
other rhyme words for you, you can use whichever ones you like.’
Clutching the volume of poems, Caltrop returned in great glee and at once began
thinking about her composition. After working out the first line or two, she could not
resist peeping at the Du Fu and reading a couple of poems. And in this way she
continued, alternately reading and composing by fits and starts, too excited to think
about eating or drinking or to sit still in the same place for two or three minutes
together.
‘Why give yourself so much trouble when you don’t have to?’ Bao-chai asked her.
‘It’s all that Frowner’s fault. I shall have to go and have it out with her. You are
inclined to be a dreamer at the best of times, but now you are becoming a real case I’
‘Please, Miss Bao I’ said Caltrop. ‘You are putting me off.’ She was writing while she
said this. Soon she had com?pleted the draft of a poem and handed it to Bao-chai to
look at. Bao-chai read it and laughed.
‘No, this is no good. This isn’t the way to write poetry. Still, don’t be disheartened. I
should take it to her just the same and see what she says.’
Caltrop followed her advice and went off to look for Dai?-yu. Dai-yu took the poem
and looked at it. This is what Caltrop had written:

       A chilly radiance bright, a fair round shape,
       The cold white moon hangs in the middle sky.
       The poet for inspiration seeks her oft;
       The homesick traveller from her turns his eye.
       Like a jade mirror hanging on azure wall,
       Like disc of jade suspended from on high.
       No need for lamps on such a glorious night,
    When every beam and post is bathed in light.

Dai-vu smiled.
‘You’ve certainly got some ideas there, but the words you’ve expressed them in
some-how don’t hang together properly. It’s because you haven’t read enough
poetry yet. It looks to me as if you’ve got rather stuck with this poem. If I were you,
I’d abandon it altogether and begin another one. Let yourself go a bit more this time.’
Caltrop returned in silence. This time she did not even go indoors but remained
outside among the trees at the water’s edge—to the considerable mystification of
those who passed by and saw her—sitting on a rock meditating, or squatting on her
heels in order to scratch characters on the ground.
Li Wan, Bao-chai, Tan-chun and Bao-yu, hearing of this interesting sight, stood on a
little hillock some distance away from her and watched with amusement. Bao-chai
insisted that Caltrop had gone mad.
‘You should have heard her last night. She was muttering away to herself until four
or five in the morning. And she can’t have slept for more than half an hour, for as
soon as it was daylight, I could hear her getting up again. She rushed through her
toilet and then rushed off to see Frowner. Pre?sently she came back again, and after
mooning around for half the day, she produced a poem; and as that was no good, I
assume she is now trying to write another one.’
‘“The genius of the place brings out the excellence of the person”,’ said Bao-yu,
misquoting slightly. ‘The -lord above doesn’t give us our talents for nothing. We
always used to say what a pity it was that a person of her qualities should lack
refinement—but look at her now! It proves there is some justice in the world.’
‘If only you had her powers of concentration,’ said Bao-chai, ‘you might study to
some purpose.’
Bao-yu did not reply.
Just then a very pleased-looking Caltrop was to be seen hurrying off in the direction
of the Naiad’s House.
‘Let’s go after her and see if it’s any better this time,’ said Tan-chun.
When the three of them arrived, Dai-yu had the poem in her hand and was already
discussing it.
‘What’s it like?’ they asked her.
‘Well, for a beginner, of course, it’s very good,’ said Dai-yu; ‘but it isn’t really right
yet. It’s too laboured. She’ll have to try again.’
The others asked if they might have a look. This is what they read:

                 Silver or water on the casement cold?
                 See its round source in yon clear midnight sky.
                 Blanched ghostly white, plum-blossoms spread their scent,
                 And dew on willow-slips begins to dry.
                 Is it white powder on the paving spilled?
                 Or grains of frost that on the railings lie?
                 I wake to find no other soul in sight
                 But that still face which through the blind sheds light.
‘It’s not much like a poem about the moon,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but if you altered the
title to “Moonlight”, it would fit rather well. Look at these lines: each of them is not
about the moon, it’s about moonlight. Well, all poetry is only a lot of nonsense! I
should leave it for a few days, Caltrop, if I were you. There’s no hurry.’
But Caltrop, though she had truly believed that this second poem was a minor
masterpiece and was extremely dashed by its rejection, was most unwilling to give
up. She wanted to begin thinking about her next poem straight away; and as she
found the talk and laughter of the cousins distracting, she went out to where the
bamboos began, at the foot of the terrace. There she gave herself up to cogitation of
such fierce intensity that she became totally obvious to all sights and sounds around
her, and when Tan-chun jokingly called to her through the window to ‘call it a day’,
she merely looked up with a somewhat dazed expression and replied that ‘“day”
didn’t rhyme: the rhyme word she was using was “sky”’. The others, hearing this, all
burst out laughing.
‘The girl’s got poetry mania!’ said Bao-chai. ‘This is all Frowner’s doing.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Dai-yu. ‘The Sage tells us that we should be “tireless in teaching
others”, She came and asked me for help. How could I possibly refuse her?’
‘Let’s take her to Xi-chun’s place and get her to look at the painting,’ said Li Wan.
‘Perhaps it will take her mind off poetry for a bit.’
She went outside, the others following, and taking Caltrop by the hand, led her to the
Spring In Winter room of Lotus Pavilion, where they found Xi-chun, fatigued by her
labours, lying on the couch taking an afternoon nap. The painting was on the wall,
masked by a covering of gauze. The cousins woke up Xi-chun and removed the cover
from the painting. Barely three-tenths of it had been completed. Several female
figures were to be seen scattered about here and there in the landscape.
‘Look,’ they said, pointing them out to Caltrop, ‘anyone who can write poetry gets
put into the picture. You must hurry up and learn, so that she can put you in too!’
After chatting and joking for a while, they broke up and went off to their several
apartments.
Caltrop could think of nothing else but her poem. in the evening she sat by the lamp
thinking about it, and it was after midnight when she went to bed. Even in bed she
lay with her eyes wide open, continuing to think about it; and it was not until three
or four in the morning that she gradually dropped off to sleep.
At daybreak Bao-chai woke up and listened: Caltrop ap?peared to be fast asleep.
‘She was tossing about all night,’ thought Bao-chai. ‘I wonder if she managed to
finish her poem. I won’t call her now; she must be exhausted.’
Just then she heard Caltrop laugh and call out in her sleep:
‘Ha! Got it! Let her try saying that this one isn’t any good!’
Bao-chai was both touched and amused.
‘What have you got?’ she asked, quickly waking her. ‘This poetry business is
becoming positively unnatural! I don’t know about learning how to write poetry:
what you’ll likelier get, if you go on much longer in this fashion, is a serious illness!’
The intensity of Caltrop’s application had, in fact, induced a concentration of the vital
fluids which, finding no outlet during the daytime, had resulted in her being able to
produce a whole eight-line poem in her sleep. She wrote it down as soon as she had
combed and washed, and then went out to look for the others.
At Drenched Blossoms, in the little pavilion on the bridge, she came upon Li Wan and
the cousins on the way back from their morning duty-call on Lady Wang. Bao-chai
was just telling them how Caltrop had composed a poem while she was dreaming
and how she had cried out in her sleep, and the others were laughing as they listened.
When they looked up and saw Caltrop herself approaching them, they eagerly asked
her if they might see her poem.
For further details, please see the following chapter.

CHAPTER 49



Red flowers bloom brighter in dazzling snow
And venison reeks strangely on rosebud lips



WHEN Caltrop saw the cousins talking and laughing about her, she came forward,
smiling herself, and handed the poem she was carrying to Dai-yu.
‘See what you think of this one,’ she said. ‘If this one is all tight, I shall go on
learning; if it’s still no good, I shall just have to give up the whole idea.’
The others clustered round Dai-yu to look. This is what they read:

             Ethereal splendour no cloud can blot out!
             Chaste lovely presence of the cold night sky!
             From a white world the washer’s dull thud sounds,
             Till in the last watch cocks begin to cry,
             While, by a fisherman’s sad flute entranced,
             A lady leans out from her casement high;
             And you, White Goddess, lulled in sweet delight,
             Wish every night could be a fifteenth night.
There were exclamations from all of them when they had finished reading it.
‘But this is not just “all right”,’ they said, ‘this is a good and highly original poem. It
shows the truth of the proverb: “Nothing is too difficult for one who has a mind to do
it.” We shall definitely be inviting you now to join our poetry club.’
Caltrop, supposing that they were only saying this to humour her, could not quite
believe them and continued to press Dai-yu and Bao-chai for the truth.
Just at that moment a number of maids and old serving women came hurrying
towards them in a state of great ex?citement:
‘Mrs Zhu! Young ladies! Come and meet you relations! A whole lot of young ladies
and other people we’ve never seen before have just arrived.’
Li Wan laughed.
‘What are you talking about? Whose relations have just arrived?’
There are two young cousins of yours, Mrs Zhu,’ they said, ‘and there’s a young lady
who says she’s Miss Bao’s cousin, and a young gentleman that’s cousin to Mr Xue.
We’re on our way now to fetch Mrs Xue. Why don’t you and the young ladies go on
ahead and meet them?’
They hurried off to complete their mission.
‘It sounds as if my cousin Xue Ke and his sister must have come,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Can
it be them, though?’
‘And it sounds as if my Aunt Li must have decided to bring her two daughters to the
capital,’ said Li Wan. ‘But how strange that they should have arrived together I’
When she and the cousins entered Lady Wang’s main recep?tion room, they found it
packed with people. Apart from the ones whom the servants had mentioned, they
found Lady Xing’s brother’s wife with her daughter Xing Xiu-yan. The three of them,
Lady Xing’s brother and his wife and daughter, had come up to the capital to put
themselves under the protec?tion of Lady Xing. By a coincidence Xi-feng’s brother
Wang Ren was starting out for the capital just as they were plan?ning to set out
themselves, so, on the strength of the marriage connection (Wang Ren being the
brother of Lady Xing’s daughter-in-law), they had elected to travel in his company.
While stopping at one of the canal ports half-way along their route, they had made
the acquaintance of Li Wan’s widowed aunt and her two daughters, Li Wen and Li Qi,
also on their way to the capital, and when it emerged that all of them were
marriage-relations of the Jia family, these three, too, had joined the party. A little
after this, Xue Pan’s cousin Xue Ke had decided to bring his sister Bao-qin to the
capital to attend to the formalities of her betrothal, Some years previously her father,
while temporarily residing in the capital, had prom?ised her to the son of a certain
Academician Mei, but had died before the betrothal could be made formal. Hearing
that his aunt’s kinsman Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, Xue Ke and his
sister had pushed on ahead to -join him. Thus it was that today all these people
presented themselves simultaneously at the Rong mansion lo6lting for their various
relations.
When at last the introductions and courtesies were over, it became clear that
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang were delighted with the new arrivals.
I knew something nice was going to happen from the way the lampwick was
behaving last night,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It kept flaring up and then forming into
little balls at the top. You see, I was tight!’
A general exchange of family talk ensued, and the handling over by the visitors of the
presents they had brought with them. After that Grandmother Jia invited them all to
take lunch with her, with wine to celebrate.
Xi-feng, it goes without saying, was now busier than ever. Li Wan and Bao-chai, who
had a great deal of catching up on family news to do, were also kept busy exchanging
informa?tion with their relations about all the things that had hap?pened during the
years since they last met. Dai-yu, observing them, at first shared in their happiness,
but when she began to reflect on the contrast with her own solitary and orphaned
state, she was obliged to go away in order to hide her tears. Bao-yu, well aware of
the reason for her sudden disappearance, went after her, and with a good deal of
coaxing, succeeded at last in comforting her.
As soon as Dai-yu had dried her tears, Bao-yu hurried back to Green Delights to tell
Aroma, Musk and Skybright about the visitors.
‘You ought to go and have a look,’ he told them. ‘This nephew of my Aunt Xue’s is
completely different from Cousin Pan. From his looks and behaviour you’d think he
was Bao-chai’s brother. He’s certainly more like her than Pan is. And as for the
sister—you’re always saying what a beauty Cousin Chai is, but wait till you’ve seen
her! And then there are my sister-in-law’s two cousins—well, words just fail-me!
Heavenly lord, what a store of beauty you must have at your disposal to be able to
produce such paragons! I’ve been like the frog living at the bottom of the well who
thought the world was a little round pool of water. Up to now I’ve always believed
that the girls in this household were without equals anywhere; but now, even
without my needing to go outside, here they come, each one more beautiful than the
last! Today has been an education for me. Don’t tell me there are any more like this:
the shock would be too great!’
He laughed excitedly. Aroma saw that he was in one of his crazy moods and refused
to go and look. But Skybright and the others were more curious and at once hurried
over for a peep. They returned soon after, full of smiles, to report on what they had
seen.
‘Do go and look!’ they urged Aroma. ‘There’s Lady Xing’s niece and this cousin of
Miss Bao’s and Mrs Zhu’s two cousins: it’s not often you get a chance to see four such
beautiful bul?rushes together!’
Scarcely had these words been uttered when a smiling Tan-chun came in looking for
Bao-yu.
‘Our poetry club is in luck,’ she said, finding him indoors with the maids. ‘Think of
all those new members!’
‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu. ‘What a happy inspiration of yours it was to start it! It’s almost as
though providence had sent these people here to make it prosper. But are you sure
they can all write poetry?’
‘I’ve already asked them,’ said Tan-chun. ‘They are too modest to say outright, of
course, but from what I can judge I’m pretty sure that either they all can, or even if
they can’t, would learn very quickly. Look how quick Caltrop has been.’
‘Which of the four do you think is the prettiest, Miss?’ said Skybright. ‘I say Miss
Bao’s cousin.’
‘Yes, I think I agree,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I think even Bao-chai is not quite as beautiful as
her.’
Aroma had been listening to all this with growing curiosity. ‘This is certainly news to
me!’ she said. ‘I shouldn’t have thought it possible to find anyone more beautiful
than Miss Bao. I must go and have a look.’
‘Grandmother was completely captivated as soon as she set eyes on her,’ said
Tan-chun. ‘She’s already insisted that Mother should become her godmother, and it’s
decided that Grandmother shall bring her up as her own grandchild.’
‘Really?’ Bao-yu seemed delighted.
‘When have I ever told you a lie?’ said Tan-chun. There was a glint of mischief in
her eye: ‘Now that she’s got such a beautiful granddaughter, she’ll probably lose
interest in her darling grandson.’
‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Bao-yu unconcernedly. ‘She ought to give preference to
girls. That’s as it should be. By the way, it’s the sixteenth today. It’s the day for our
poetry dub meeting.’
‘Cousin Lin has only recently got up, and Ying-chun is ill again,’ said Tan-chun.
‘We’re not really in any shape for a meeting at the moment.’
‘Ying-chun doesn’t care much about writing poetry any?way,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Surely
we can manage without her?’
‘Yes, but I think we ought to wait a few days, even so” said Tan-chun. ‘Why don’t
we wait until we’ve got to know the newcomers a bit better and then invite them to
join us? I shouldn’t think sister-in-law or Cousin Chai can either of them be much in
the mood for writing poetry at the moment. And Xiang-yun isn’t here. And Frowner
has only just recovered. No one is really up to it yet. We ought to wait until Yun
arrives and the new lot have settled in; then, when Frowner is completely better and
sister-in-law and Cousin Chai are a bit less preoccupied and Caltrop has made some
more progress, we can invite everyone to a plenary session. What you and I ought to
do now is go round to Grandma’s and see what arrangements are being made about
these people’s accom?modation. We know that Chai’s cousin is staying here,
be?cause Grandma has adopted her; but we don’t know yet about the others. If
there are no plans for them to stay here, we must ask Grandma to invite them. If
possible we should get her to let them live in the Garden. It would be fun to have
some more neighbours.’
Bao-yu grew quite radiant at the thought.
‘How clever you are, Tan!’ he told his sister admiringly.
‘I’m such a stupid ass. I get so carried away that I don’t think about the important
things like you do.’
Brother and sister then went together to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, where they
found the old lady in wonderful high spirits following Lady Wang’s recognition of Xue
Bao-quin as her god-daughter. She considered that this entitled her to treat the girl
as her grandchild, which she had begun doing by insisting that she end the nights
with her in her apartment and not in the Garden with Bao-chai. Xue Ke would
naturally stay with his aunt and occupy the study that Xue Pan had vacated.
‘ This niece of yours surely doesn’t need to go back to her parents yet?’
Grandmother Jia said to Lady Xing. ‘Let her stay in the Garden for a few days and
enjoy herself.’
Lady Xing’s brother and sister-in-law had been living in extremely straitened
circumstances, and now that they had come up to the capital, were relying on her to
provide them with accommodation and financial assistance. She was natur?ally only
too delighted to have one less person to her charge, and promptly handed Xiu-yan
over to Xi-feng to dispose of.
Bearing in mind the varied, somewhat peculiar, tempera?ments of the Garden’s
inhabitants, Xi-feng doubted the wis?dom of putting Xiu-yan in with one of the
others; on the other hand she foresaw disadvantages in opening up a separate
establishment for her. In the end she put her in with Ying chun, reflecting that if the
girl did experience any difficulties in -living with Ying-chun, then even if Lady Xing got
to hear of it, she, Xi-feng, could not be held responsible, since Ying-?chun was Lady
Xing’s own half-daughter.
From this time onwards, not counting the time she spent at home with her parents,
Xiu-yan received, for every whole month that she lived with Ying-chun in Prospect
Garden, an allowance from Xi-feng of exactly the same amount as -the monthly
allowance that was paid to Ying-chun herself.
To Xi-feng’s dispassionate eye it soon became apparent that in both temperament
and behaviour Xiu-yan was quite unlike Lady Xing and her parents that she was in
fact an extremely sweet and lovable person. Sorry that so gentle a soul should be so
poor and unfortunate, Xi-feng treated her with a tact and considerateness that she
did not always show the others. Lady Xing, on the other hand, seemed -scarcely
aware of her niece’s existence.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang esteemed Li Wan as a good and virtuous young
woman who, having lost her hus?band at an early age, bore widowhood with
fortitude and restraint. Now that this widowed aunt had arrived, they re?fused to
bear of her taking lodgings outside, and though the good lady made many polite
efforts to decline, insisted that she and her two daughters, Li Wen and Li Qi, should
move into Sweet-rice Village and stay there with Li Wan at the family’s expense.
No sooner had the new arrivals begun settling in than news came that Grandmother
Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, the Marquis of Zhong-jing, was being transferred to an
important position in one of the outer provinces and would shortly be leaving for his
new post, taking his family with him. Grandmother Jia could not bear the idea of a
permanent separation from her great-niece, and so it was agreed that Xiang-yun, too,
should move into residence with the Jias. It was Grandmother Jia’s original intention
that Xi-feng should set up a separate establishment for her in the Garden; but as
Xiang-yun herself rigorously opposed this idea and insisted on living with her beloved
Bao-chai, she was allowed to have her way.
The Garden’s society was now larger and livelier than it bad ever been before. With Li
Wan as its doyenne it numbered if you counted Xi-feng as an honorary member
thirteen people: Li Wan, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun, Li
Wen, Li Qi, Bao-qin, Xing Xiu-yan, Bao-yu and Xi-feng. Apart from the two young
married women, the rest were all fifteen, sixteen or seventeen years old. Most of
them were in fact born in the same year, several of them in the same month or even
on the same day. Not only Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and the servants, even
the young people themselves had difficulty in remembering who was senior to whom,
and soon gave up trying, and abandoned any attempt at observing the usual
formalities of address.
Caltrop could now think of nothing else all day long but writing poetry. Up to now
she had refrained from importun?ing Bao-chai too persistently for advice, but with
the arrival of an unwearying talker like Shi Xiang-yun upon the scene she was in her
element. Xiang-yun was only too willing to accede to her requests for instruction, and
morning, noon and night the two of them were to be found together, always in
ani?mated discussion.
‘You two are deafening me with your perpetual chatter,’ Bao-chai complained.
‘Imagine how ridiculous and un?maidenly it would seem to a man of letters if he
heard that girls were treating poetry as a serious occupation! Caltrop on her own was
bad enough, but with a chatterbox like you on top of it, Yun, I’m finding it a bit too
much. Everywhere I go it’s “the profundity of Du Fu”, or “Wei Ying-wu of Soochow’s
limpidity”, or “the somewhat meretricious charm of Wen Ting-yun”, or “Li Shang-yin’s
obscurity”. Still, there are two important living poets I’ve so far heard no men?tion
of.’
‘Oh?’ said Xiang-yun, all agog. ‘Which two?’
‘I’ve heard no mention of Crazy Caltrop’s prodigious pertinacity or the linguipotent
loquacity of Shi Xiang-yun,’ said Bao-chai.
The other two burst out laughing.
At that moment Bao-qin arrived. She was wearing a magni?ficent rain-cape that
glittered as she moved with gold and greenish lights. Bao-chai asked her where she
had got it from.
‘Lady Jia gave me it,’ said Bao-qin. ‘She looked it out for me because it was
beginning to sleet.’
Caltrop examined it curiously.
‘No wonder it looks so beautiful: this is woven out of peacock’s down.’
‘ That’s not peacock’s down,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It’s made from mallard’s
head-feathers.’ She smiled at Bao-qin teasingly:
‘One can see how fond of you she must be. She’s fond of Bao-yu, but she’s never let
him wear this.’
Bao-chai laughed:


‘To each a different fortune meted—

that’s certainly a true saying. I never dreamt that she would be coming here—much
less that when she did, Lady Jia would immediately fail for her like this!’
‘Apart from the time you spend with Her Old Ladyship,’ Xiang-yun advised Bao-qin,
‘I should stick to the Garden as much as possible if I were you. In these two places
you can eat and drink and play anywhere you please. But be careful of Lady Wang’s
place. If she’s in when you go there, then you can sit and talk with her as long as you
like; but if she’s not, it’s best not to go inside. There are a lot of nasty people in there
who like to do us harm.’
This highly indiscreet warning was uttered so matter-of-?factly that Bao-chai, Bao-qin,
Caltrop and Oriole were com?pelled to laugh.
‘I won’t say you are thoughtless,’ said Bao-chai, because you obviously mean well;
but you really are a bit too out?spoken. You and Qin ought to be -sisters, since you
are so concerned about her.’
Xiang-yun looked at Bao-qin appraisingly.
‘She is the only one of us who could wear this cape,’ she said. ‘Anyone else would
look wrong in it.’
Just then Amber walked in with a message from Grand?mother Jia:
‘Her Old Ladyship says please Miss Bao don’t be too strict with Miss Qin; she’s still
only little and should he allowed to have her own way. And she says if there’s
anything Miss Qin wants, she shouldn’t be afraid to ask for it.’
Bao-chai stood up politely to acknowledge the message. Afterwards she nudged
Bao-qin playfully.
‘I don’t know! Some people have all the luck. You’d better leave us, hadn’t you,
before we start maltreating you? It beats me. What have you got that I haven’t got?’
She was still teasing Bao-qin when Bao-yu and Dai-yu arrived. ‘You say that in jest,
Chai,’ said Xiang-yun, noting their entry, but I know someone who really thinks that
way.
‘If anyone’s really upset, it must be him,’ said Amber, pointing her finger at Bao-yu.
Xiang-yun laughed at her simple-mindedness:
‘No, he’s not that sort of person..’
‘Then if it’s not him you mean, it must be her,’ said Amber, pointing now at Dai--yu.
Xiang7yun fell silent. This time it was Bao-chai who spoke:
‘Wrong again. She feels the same way about my cousin as I do. in fact, I believe if
anything she’s even fonder of her; so how could she be upset? Don’t be taken in by
Miss Shi’s nonsense, my dear Amber. When did you ever hear Miss Shi say anything
serious?’
From past experience Bao-yu—who still knew nothing of Dai-yu and Bao-chai’s
recent rapprochement was too fami?liar with Dai-yu’s jealous disposition not to feel
appre?hensive that Grandmother Jia’s new partiality for Bao-qin might upset her. He
was puzzled, therefore, by Bao-chai’s rejoinder, and even more puzzled when he
studied the ex?pression on Dai-yu’s face and found that, far from showing any trace
of the resentment he would have expected, it exactly tallied with what Bao-chai had
said.
‘Those two used not to be like this,’ he thought. ‘Yet to judge from appearances,
they are ten times friendlier towards each other now than they are towards anyone
else.’
Shortly after this he heard Dai-yu calling Bao-qin ‘dear’ and fussing over her as if she
were Bao-qin’s elder sister.
Bao-qin was a young, warm-hearted creature; she was, moreover, highly intelligent
and had been taught her letters from an early age. By the time she had been a couple
of days in the ha household, she had already formed some impression of its members,
Finding that her cousins were quite different from the vapid, giggling creatures to be
found in the women’s quarters of so many houses, she was soon on friendly terms
with all of them and was careful not to show off; but in Dai-yu she recognized a
superior intelligence, and consequently felt even more affection and respect for her
than she did for any of the others. Hence the intimacy which Bao-yu had just
witnessed. He studied the pair of them curiously and marveled in silence.
Shortly after this, when Bao-chai and Bao-qin had gone off to Aunt Xue’s place and
Xiang-yun had gone to see Grand?mother Jia and Dai-yu had gone back to her own
room to rest, Bao-Yu went after Dai-yu to question her.
‘I’ve read The Western Chamber,’ he said, ‘and understood it well enough to have
offended you on more than one occa?sion by quoting it at you; yet there’s one line in
it I still don’t understand. Do you think, if I told you it, you could explain it-to me?’
Dai-yu realized that something must lie behind this request, nevertheless she
smilingly promised that she would do her best.
‘It comes in the section called “Ying-ying’s Reply”,’ said Bao-yu:
            ‘Since when did Meng Guang accept Lang Hong’s tray?

The question seems rather an apposite one. Those two little words “since when”
particularly intrigue me. Kindly ex?pound them for me, will you? Since when did
Meng Guang accept Liang Hong’s tray?
Dai-yu could not but be amused by the droll way in which he had gone about making
his inquiry.
‘That’s a good question,’ she said. ‘It was a good question when Reddie asked it in
the play, and it’s a good question when you ask it now.’
‘There was a time, not so long past, when you might have been deeply offended by
it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘yet now you say nothing.’
‘It’s because now I know she’s a very good person,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Before I used to
think she was two-faced.’
She proceeded to tell him, at some length, about the motherly talking to Bao-chai
had given her after her lapses in the drinking game and about the gift of bird’s nest
and sugar and the long talk Bao-chai had had with her when she was ill.
‘I see,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I needn’t have been so puzzled then. It seems that the
question

             Since when did Meng Guang accept Liang Hong’s tray?
could have been answered with another line from the same act of the same play. It
was since you spoke

    Like a child whose unbridled tongue knows no concealment!

Dai-yu went on to talk about Bao-qin, whom she evidently looked on as a younger
sister. Alas, this only reminded her that she had no real sister of her own and she
began to cry. Bao-yu would have none of this.
‘Now come on, Dai! You’re making yourself upset. Look at you! You’re thinner than
ever this year. It’s because you won’t take care of yourself. You positively look for
ways of making yourself miserable. It’s almost as though you felt you hadn’t spent
the day properly unless you’d had at least one good cry in it!’
‘No,’ said Dai-yu as she wiped her eyes. ‘I feel very low these days, but I don’t think
cry as much as I used to.’
‘I’m sure you do,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s just that it’s become so much a habit with you
that you no longer know whether you’re crying or not. I’m sure you cry just as much
as you always did.’
Just then one of the maids from his room arrived carrying his scarlet felt rain-cape.
‘Mrs Zhu has just sent someone round with a message for you, Master Bao,’ said
the maid.’ She says it’s starting to snow now and she wants to discuss with you about
inviting people for the poetry meeting.’
She had barely finished speaking when Li Wan’s emissary arrived to deliver the same
message to Dai-yu. Bao-yu sug?gested that they should go to Sweet-rice Village
together and waited while she put on a pair of little red-leather boots which had a
gilded cloud pattern cut into their surface, a pelisse of heavy, dark-red bombasine
lined with white fox-fur, a complicated woven belt made out of silvery green shot silk,
and a snow-hat. The two of them then set off together through the snow.
They arrived to find that nearly all the others were there already, mostly in red felt or
camlet snow-cloaks. The exceptions were Li Wan, who wore a simple greatcoat of
plain woollen material buttoned down the front, Xue Bao-chai in a pelisse of
ivy-green whorl-patterned brocade trimmed with some sort of exotic lamb’s wool,
and Xing Xiu-yan, who had no protection against the snow of any kind beyond the
every day clothes she was wearing.
Presently Xiang-yun arrived. She was wearing an enormous fur coat that
Grandmother Jia had given her. The outside was made up of sables’ heads and the
inside lined with long-haired black squirrel. On her head was a dark-red camlet
‘Princess’ hood lined with yellow figured velvet, whose cut-out cloud shapes were
bordered with gold, and round her neck, muffling her up to the nose, was a large
sable tippet.
‘Look, Monkey!’ said Dai-yu, laughing at this furry appari?tion. ‘Trust Yun to turn
the need for wearing snow-clothes into an excuse for dressing up! She looks just like
a Tartar groom!’
‘You haven’t seen what I am wearing underneath yet,’ said Xiang-yun, and opened
out the fur coat to show them.
She had on a short, narrow-sleeved, ermine-lined tunic jacket of russet green,
edge-fastened down the centre front, purfled at neck and cuffs with a triple band of
braiding in contrasting colours, and patterned all over with dragon-roundels
embroidered in gold thread and coloured silks. Under this she was wearing a short
riding-skirt of pale-red satin damask lined with white fox belly-fur. A court girdle of
different-coloured silks braided into butterfly knots and ending in long silken tassels
was tied tightly round her waist. Her boots were of deerskin. The whole ensemble
greatly enhanced the somewhat masculine appearance of her figure with its graceful,
athletic bearing.
The others laughed:
‘She loves dressing up as a boy. Actually she looks even more fetching in boy’s
clothes than she does as a girl.’
‘Let’s get down to business,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘What I want to know is, who’s paying
for the entertainment this time?’
‘Well, this is what I thought,’ said Li Wan. ‘We’ve already passed the date for our
regular meeting, and we don’t want to wait until the next one comes round, because
it’s too far ahead. As it’s snowing, I thought it would be rather nice if we clubbed
together for a little snow-party in honour of the newcomers and used it as an
occasion for doing some poetry-making as well. What do the rest of you think?’
‘I think that’s exactly what we should do,’ said Bao-yu. ‘The only thing is, it’s a bit
late for a party today, but if we wait until tomorrow, the snow may have stopped by
then and it won’t be so much fun.’
‘It’s very unlikely to,’ said the others. ‘And even if it has stopped by tomorrow
morning, it will surely be snowing still tonight, so it should be well worth looking at in
the morning.’
‘This place here is all right, of course,’ said Li Wan, ‘but I thought that for this
occasion it would be nicer if we met in Snowy Rushes Retreat. I’ve already told them
to light the stove there and get the underground heating system started. I don’t think
Grandma would much like the idea of our sitting round the stove making verses, so,
as it’s only a very little party, I propose that we don’t tell her about it. As long as we
let Feng know, it should be sufficient. As regards contributions: if each of you will
bring one tael to me here, it ought to be enough. Not you five;’ she pointed to
Caltrop, Bao-qin, Li Wen, Li Qi and Xiu-yan—‘And Ying-chun and Xi-chun won’t be
contributing either. Ying-chun is ill and Xi-chun is on leave of absence. That leaves
only Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun and Dai-yu. If you four will contribute one tael each,
I will undertake to contribute five or six taels myself. Together that should be ample.’
Bao-chai and the other three promised to bring her their contributions later and
went on to ask what titles and rhymes should be set for the poetry-making.
‘I’ve already decided that,’ said Li Wan. ‘Let it be a surprise for you when you
come.’
Arrangements for the party having now been settled, the cousins chatted together
for a while longer before going off in a body to visit Grandmother Jia.
That concludes the narrative for that day,

*

At first light next morning Bao-yu, who in excited anticipa?tion of the day ahead had
barely slept all night, crawled from the covers and lifted up a corner of the
bed-curtain to inspect the weather. Although the doors and windows were still
fastened, there was an ominous brightness about the latter which led him to
conclude inwardly groaning with dis?appointment that the snow must have cleared
and the sun be shining. Jumping out of bed, he opened one of the inner casements
and looked through the glass. It was not the sun after all, he found, but the white
gleam of snow. It had been snowing all night; there was a good foot of snow on the
ground and it was still coming down in great, soft flakes, I like the flock from a
torn-up quilt.
Overjoyed to find that he had been wrong, he at once began shouting for his maids,
and as soon as he had finished washing and dressed himself in an aubergine-coloured
gown lined with fox, a jacket with a sealskin shoulder-cape, and a belt round his waist
for warmth, he donned his elegant rain-bat and cape (the Prince of Bei-jing’s present
that Dai-yu had so much admired), stepped into his pear wood patterns, and set off
for Snowy Rushes Retreat.
Once outside tile courtyard gate, the Garden stretched out on every hand in uniform
whiteness, uninterrupted except for the dark green of a pine-tree or the lighter green
of some bamboos here and there in the distance. He felt as if he was standing in the
middle of a great glittering crystal bowl. Proceeding on his way, he had just turned a
spur in the miniature mountain whose foot he was skirting, when his senses were
suddenly ravished by a delicate cold fragrance. On looking around him, he found it to
be coming from the dozen or so trees of winter-flowering red plum growing inside
the walls of Green Bower Hermitage where the nun Adamantina lived. The brilliance
of their carmine hue against the white background and the bravura of their
blossoming amidst the snow so enchanted him that he stopped for some minutes to
admire them.
As he moved on again, he saw someone carrying a green oiled-silk umbrella crossing
over Wasp Waist Bridge. It was one of Li Wan’s servants on her way to invite Xi-feng
to the party.
Arriving at Snowy Rushes Retreat, be found several women-servants outside,
sweeping a pathway up to the door.
Snowy Rushes Retreat was built at the water’s margin in the shelter of a little hill. It
had a thatched roof and adobe walls and a post-and-bar fence round it and
bamboo-barred windows, just like a farmhouse or a peasant’s cottage. By merely
opening a casement and leaning out, it was possible to fish in the lake from its rear
windows. Reeds and rushes grew all around it. A meandering pathway through them
led to the bamboo bridge by which Lotus Pavilion could be approached from the
back.
When the snow-sweepers caught sight of Bao-yu in his rain hat and cape, they
paused from their labours and laughed.
‘We were just saying a moment ago that all we need now is an old fisherman, and
here he comes! You’re too impatient, Master: the young ladies won’t be coming until
they’ve eaten.’
Hearing that, there was nothing for Bao-yu to do but go back again.
Looking out from Drenched Blossoms Pavilion while he was crossing over the bridge,
he caught sight of his sister Tan-chun emerging from Autumn Studio. She was
wearing a dark-red camlet cloak and Guanyin hood and leaning on the arm of a little
maid. A woman-servant walked behind her carrying a green oiled-silk umbrella.
Realizing that she must be on her way to see Grandmother Jia, Bao-yu waited by the
pavilion for her to catch up with him and accompanied her out of the Garden.
When they arrived, Bao-qin was still at her toilet in the inner room. The other cousins
joined them shortly after. Bao-yu kept telling everyone how hungry he felt and
grumbling because the servants were so long in serving. When the food at last
arrived, the first dish to be put on the table was unborn lamb stewed in milk.
‘That’s a health food,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s for old folk like me. I’m afraid you
young people couldn’t eat it. It’s a creature that’s never seen the light. There’s some
fresh venison today, though. Why don’t you wait and have some of that?’
The others agreed to wait, but Bao-yu professed himself unable to hold out, and
helping himself to a bowl of plain boiled rice, poured a little tea over it and shovelled
it straight from the bowl into his mouth with one or two collops of pickled
pheasant-meat to help it down.
‘I know you’ve got something on today,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That’s why you’ve
no time to eat properly.’ She turned to the servants. ‘Save some of the venison for
them to eat in the evening.’
‘There’s plenty more,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve already spoken to them about it.’
Xiang-yun had a brief consultation on the subject with Bao-yu:
‘If they’ve got fresh venison, why don’t we ask for a piece and cook it ourselves in
the Garden? That would be fun.’
Bao-yu eagerly took up her suggestion and begged a piece from Xi-feng. He got one
of the women to take it into the Garden for them.
Presently, when they had all left Grandmother Jia’s place and reassembled in Snowy
Rushes Retreat an-d were waiting to hear what themes and rhymes Li Wan had
decided on, they noticed that Xiang-yun and Bao-yu were missing.
‘Those two should never be allowed together,’ said Dai-yu. ‘As soon as ever they get
together there is some kind of mischief afoot. No doubt the reason they’ve gone off
this time is because they have designs on that deer’s meat.’
Just then Li Wan’s aunt, Mrs Li, came in, drawn by the noise and numbers to see
what was happening.
‘That boy with the jade and the girl with the gold kylin,’ she said to Li Wan anxiously,
‘they both seem such clean, well-bred children, and they look as if they had enough
to eat, yet just now the two of them were discussing how to eat a piece of raw
venison. They seemed to he quite serious about it, too. Can one eat venison raw? I
find it hard to believe that it can be very good for you.’
‘Shocking I’ exclaimed the others. ‘Better go out and stop them.’
‘Yun is at the bottom of this,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Mark my words!’
Li Wan hurried off to find the culprits.
‘If you are proposing to eat raw meat,’ she said when she had found them, ‘I shall
have to send you back to Grandma’s to do it there. You can take a whole deer and
stuff yourselves sick on it as long as it’s not my responsibility. Come on, now! Come
back and make verses with the rest of us. Out in all this snow—it’s much too cold!’
‘You’re absolutely mistaken,’ said Bao-yu, laughing. ‘We’re planning to roast it.’
‘Oh well’ said Li Wan, ‘that’s different.’
Some old women arrived just then, carrying an iron stove, some metal skewers and a
grill.
‘Now be careful about cutting that meat,’ said Li Wan. ‘If you cut your fingers, you’ll
have nobody to blame but yourselves I’
Having uttered that warning, she went indoors again.
Not long after she had gone in, Patience came by on her way to the Retreat. Xi-feng
had sent her, in response to Li Wan’s invitation, to explain that she was unable to join
them because she was busy seeing to the various annual payments that fall due at
this time of year. Xiang-yun stopped her to exchange greetings, and having once
stopped her, was unwill?ing to let her go again. Patience was by nature a fun-loving
girl and she knew that Xi-feng would generally let her do as she liked. Considering the
idea of cooking outdoors a great lark, she entered into the spirit of the thing, and
taking off her bracelets, joined the other two round the brazier and asked for three of
the cut-up pieces of venison to roast.
Bao-chai and Dai-yu had seen this kind of thing before and were not particularly
interested, but it was a novelty to Mrs Li and Bao-qin and the newcomers, and they
were greatly intrigued.
‘What a lovely smell!’ said Tan-chun, when she and Li Wan had finished discussing
the theme for the verse-making. ‘You can smell it from here. I’m going outside to
have some.’
She went out to join the three around the brazier. Li Wan followed her.
‘Everyone’s ready and waiting,’ said Li Wan. ‘Haven’t you two finished eating yet?’
‘I need wine to inspire my verse,’ said Xiang-yun, speaking with a mouth full of
venison, ‘and eating roast venison gives me a thirst for wine. So if I didn’t eat this
venison, I shouldn’t be able to write any poetry for you.’
She caught sight of Bao-qin, in the beautiful drake’s head cloak that Caltrop had
thought was made of peacock’s feathers, hanging back somewhat from the rest and
smiling wistfully.
‘Thoppy!’ she called out to her. ‘Come and try thome!’
‘Too dirty!’ said Bao-qin.
‘Go and try some,’ Bao-chai urged her. ‘It’s very good. The only reason your Cousin
Lin isn’t having any is because she’s delicate and can’t digest it. If it weren’t for that,
she would love to have some herself.’
Hearing this, Bao-qin went over and nibbled a bit, and finding it good, began to tuck
in with as much gusto as the rest.
Presently a little maid arrived from Xi-feng summoning Patience to return; but
Patience told the girl to go back without her and tell her mistress that she was being
detained by Miss Shi. Shortly after the maid’s departure Xi-feng herself arrived, with
a rain-cape over her shoulders.
‘This looks good,’ she said jovially. ‘You might have told me!’
With that she joined the other five in their alfresco feast round the brazier
‘You look like a party of down-and-outs,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Oh dear, oh dear! Poor Snowy
Rushes Retreat, polluted by Butcher Yun and her reeking carnivores! I weep for you!’
‘What do you know about it?’ said Xiang-yun scornfully. ‘“True wits make elegant
whate’er they touch.” Yours is a false purity. Odious purity! Now we may reek and
raven; but presently you will see us with the pure spirit of poetry in our breasts and
the most delicate, silken phrases On our lips!’
‘You’d better see to it that the verses you make are good ones,’ said Bao-chai,
laughing, ‘otherwise we shall make you expiate the pollution by plucking the venison
from your in?sides and stuffing you with snowy rushes!’
They had now made an end of eating, and washed their hands. In putting on her
bracelets again, Patience noticed that one of them was missing; but though she and
the others looked all around them, they were unable to find it. They were still
puzzling over its disappearance when Xi-feng smilingly put an end to the search:
‘I know where the bracelet’s gone. You others go in and get on with your poetry.’
‘There’s no need to look for it any longer,’ she told Patience. ‘You will have to go
home without it; but I promise that within three days from now you shall have it
back again.’
‘What are your poems to be about this time ?’ she asked the cousins. ‘Grandma
says that as it’s getting near the end of the year, we shall soon be needing some First
Month lantern riddles.’
‘Ah yes, of course!’ they said. ‘We’d quite forgotten, We’d better make some good
ones up in advance to have ready for the festival.’
During this exchange they had been trooping into the room in the Retreat which had
the under-floor heating. Wine-cups and prepared dishes had been laid there in
readiness by the servants. A paper stuck to the wall announced the theme, form and
rhyme for the forthcoming poetry contest. Bao-yu and Xiang-yun, who had not yet
seen it, quickly went over to look. This is what it said:

             Theme: The Snow
             Form:  Linked Pentameters
             Rhyme: Eyes

No order of composition had been indicated.
‘I’m not much good at poetry myself,’ said Li Wan, ‘so I shall merely start you off by
giving you the first three lines. After that, whoever is the first to think of a good
following line can carry on.’
‘I think we ought to have a fixed order,’ said Bao-chai. As to whether or not her
advice was taken, that will be made clear in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 50

Linked verses in Snowy Rushes Retreat
And lantern riddles in the Spring In Winter Room



‘I THINK We ought to have a fixed order,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Just let me write the names
down and we can decide what it is to be by lot.’
When she had written down their names and torn up the paper, the slips were drawn
and she copied them down in the order in which they came out. Li Wan, by
coincidence, re?tained the first place.
‘If this is what you are doing,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I may as well contribute a line of my
own to start you off with.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said the others. ‘Please do!’
Bao-chai added the name ‘ Feng’ to the list, above that of ‘Farmer Sweet-rice’, while
Li Wan explained what the subject was and what sort of line it had to be. Xi-feng
listened attentively and thought for some moments before speaking.
‘You mustn’t laugh if this sounds a bit unpolished,’ she said at last, ‘but at least I
think it’s the right length. Mind you, I’ve no idea how it could go on.’
‘Never mind how unpolished it is,’ they said. ‘just tell us what it is; then you can
leave, if you want to, and get on with your own work.’
‘Well, when it snows, there’s always a north wind,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and last night I
could hear the north wind blowing all night long; so I’ve made a line up about that:

             Last night the north wind blew the whole night through.

There you are—take it or leave it!’
The others ‘looked at each other in pleased surprise.
‘Even if the language of this line is a bit unpolished and you can’t see what’s going
to follow it, it’s exactly the kind of line that a skilled poet would begin with. Not only
is the line good in itself, but it leaves so many possibilities open to the person who
follows. Put that down for our first line then, Sweet-rice, and you can finish the
couplet.’
Before they proceeded any further, however, Xi-feng, Mrs Li and Patience drank two
cups of wine with them, after which they left. As soon as they had gone, Li Wan
wrote out the line that Xi-feng had given them, adding a line of her own to make it
into a couplet and a third line after that to make the beginning of a second couplet.
Thereafter, as each of them in turn completed the couplet started by the previous
person and then added the first line of another couplet, she continued to write down
the lines at their dictation:
XI-FENG:
Last night the north wind blew the whole night through—
LI WAN:
Today outside my door the snow still flies.
On mud and dirt its pure white flakes fall down—
CALTROP:
And powdered jade the whole earth beautifies.
Flakes on the dead plants weave a winter dress—
TAN-CHUN:
And on dry grasses gemlike crystallize.
Now will the farmer’s brew a good puce fetch—
LI QI
His full barn to a good year testifies.
The ash-filled gauge shows winter’s solstice near—
LI WEN:
And the Wain turns as Yang revivifies.
Snow robs the cold bills of their emerald hue—
XIU-YAN:
And frost the river’s motion petrifies.
Snow settles thickly on sparse willow boughs—
XIANG-YUN:
But on dead plantain-leaves less easy lies.
Now perfumed coals in precious braziers burn—
BAO-QIN:
And heavy furs the girls’ slim shapes disguise.
Firelight the mirror by the window catches—
DAI-YU:
And burning nard the chamber purifies.
Still sobbing through the night the mournful wind—
BAO-YU:
Each sleeper’s dreams with sadness sanctifies.
Somewhere a melancholy flute is playing—
BAO-CHAI:
Whose sad notes with the wind’s plaint harmonize.
With groans the Earth Turtle sideways shifts his load—

At this point Li Wan laid down her brush and rose to her feet.
‘I think I’ll just slip out and see about getting some more wine heated. Someone
else can take my place.’
Ban-chai took up the writing-brush and called on Bao-qin to complete the couplet;
but before she could do so, Xiang-?yun had leapt to her feet with two lines of her
own:

XIANG-YUN:
As dragons brawl, the cloud-wrack liquefies.
A lone boat from the lonely shore puts out—
Nothing daunted, Bao-qin completed that couplet instead:

DAO-QIN:
While from the bridge a horseman waves good-byes.
Now warm clothes to the frontier are dispatched—
Xiang-yun would yield to no one; and her invention was so much quicker than
anyone else’s, that they were content to let her break the order, and watched with
amusement as she returned now, exulting, to the attack:

XIANG-YUN:
And wives to distant dear ones send supplies.
On still untrodden ways masked pitfalls threaten—
‘That’s a good line!’ said Bao-chai admiringly as she wrote down what Xiang-yun
had recited; and she followed with two lines of her own:

BAO-CHAI:
In snowbound woods a bough’s creak terrifies.
The wind-blown snow around the traveller whirls—
Dai-yu hurriedly followed:

DAI-YU:
And clouds of powdery snow at each step rise.
Steamed taros makes a good snow-party fare—
She nudged Bao-yu to follow: but Bao-yu was so absorbed in watching the contest
that seemed to be developing between Xiang-yun on the one hand and Bao-qin,
Bao-chai and Dai-yu on the other, that he was failing to think up lines of his own to
follow their half-couplets with. He did the best he could, how?ever, in response to
Dai-yu’s nudge:

BAO--YU:
The guests on ‘scattered salt’ themes improvise.
Now is the woodman’s axe no longer heard—
Clear off, you—you’re no good!’ said Xiang-yun, laugh?ing. ‘All you’re doing is getting
in other people’s way!’
Her pausing to say this gave Bao-qin an opportunity of cut?ting in:

BAO-QIN:
Yet still his rod the straw-clad fisher plies.
Mountains like sleeping elephants appear—

Xiang-yun hurried back into the fray:

XIANG-YUN:
A snake-like path the climber’s skill defies.
After long cold the trees strange frost-fruits bear—

This evoked admiring murmurs from Bao-chai and the rest.
Tan-chun managed to get in a contribution at this point:

TAN-HUN:
Which, bold in beauty, winter’s blasts despise.
The hushed yard startles to a cold chough’s chatter—

Xiang-yun was ready at once with two lines to follow, but as she was feeling thirsty,
she first stopped to gulp down some tea. In doing so, she lost her turn to Xiu-yan:

XIU-YAN:
An old owl wakes the vale with mournful cries.
The driving flakes make angles disappear—

Xiang-yun put down her teacup in a hurry, before more ground could be lost:

XIAN-G-YUN:
But dimples on -the water’s face incise.
In the clear morn how radiant gleams the snow!—

Dai-yu followed:
DAI-YU:
How ghostly, as the too short daylight dies!
Its cold the Chengs’ disciples could withstand—

Xiang-yun laughed excitedly as she hurried to complete the couplet:

XIANG-YUN:
Its promise can a king’s cares exorcise.
Who’d lie abed all stiff with cold indoors—

Bao-qin laughed, too, as she followed:

BAO-QIN:
When friends invite to red-cheeked exercise?
Who o’er the land the menfolk’s silk unrolls—?

Xiang-yun quickly capped this:

XIANG-YUN:
Who the white weft from Heaven’s loom unties?

But before she could begin another couplet, Dai-yu slipped in a line of her own:

DAI-YU:
Tall tiled pavilions cold and-empty stand—

Xiang-yun capped it:

XIANG-YUN:
Snug thatch more favour finds in poor men’s eyes.

Bao-qin, concluding that this was now a free-for-all, -cut in with the next half couplet:

BAO-QIN:
Ice lumps we thaw and boil to make our tea Xiang-yun, having evidently thought of
something amus?ing, began to giggle:

XIANG-YUN:
The fuel being damp, they greatly tantalize.

Dai-yu began to giggle too:

DAI-Y-U:
The Zen recluse with non-broom sweeps the ground—

The infection of giggles had now reached Bao-qin:

BAO-QIN:
His stringless lute-play still more mystifies.

Xiang-yun was by now so doubled up with laughter that the others could not make
out the words of her next line.
‘What? ‘they asked her. ‘What was that you said?’ Xiang-yun had to repeat it:

XIANG-YUN:
On the stone tower a stork unwatchful sleeps—

Dai-yu was laughing so much that -she had to clutch painfully at her chest and the
words she recited came out in a laughing shout:

DAI-YU:
On the warm mat a cat contented sighs.

All the lines that followed were uttered in rapid succession and to the
accompaniment of much laughter.

BAO-QIN:
In moonlit caves the silvery water laps—

XIANG-YUN:
And red flags flutter against sunset skies.

DAI-YU:
Soaked winter plums make the breath fresh and sweet—


‘That’s a good line,’ said Bao-chai. She capped it herself:
BAO-CHAI:
And melted snow the wine-fumes neutralize.

BAO-QIN:
The stiffened aigrette gradually thaws—

XIANG-YUN:
The snow-soaked silken girdle slowly dries.

DAI-YU:
The wind has dropped, but snow still wetly falls—

Bao-qin capped this, laughing:

BAO-QIN:
And frequent drips the passer-by baptize.

Xiang-yun had collapsed, weak with laughing, upon Bao-chai’s shoulder. The others
had long since given up trying to participate and become mere laughing spectators of
the three-cornered contest between Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-qin. Dai-yu urged
Xiang-yun to go on.
‘Don’t tell me you’ve run out of inspiration—! Surely your famous gift of the gab is
still good for a few more lines?’
Bao-chai prodded Xiang-yun, who was now laughing help?lessly upon her lap.
‘See if you can exhaust the rhyme, Yun. If you can do that, I shall be really
impressed.’
‘This isn’t verse-making,’ said Xiang-yun, raising her head from Bao-chai’s lap, it’s
more like a duel to the death!’
‘Well, whose fault is that?’ they asked her, laughing.
Tan-chun, having decided that she would be unlikely to make any further
contributions herself had some time before this taken over the task of amanuensis
from Bao-chai. She now pointed out -that the poem needed finishing off. Li Wan,
who had just arrived back, took the paper from her and embarked on a suitable
finishing couplet:

LI WAN:
Our verses shall this happy day record—
Her cousin Li Qi completed it:

LI QI
And a wise Emperor loyally eulogize.


‘Now that’s enough;’ said Li Wan. ‘We still haven’t exhausted the rhyme, but if we
go on any longer, we shall be tying ourselves up in knots trying to use words that
aren’t really suitable.’
They now went over the whole poem from beginning to end and discussed it all in
detail. It appeared that Xiang-yun had contributed far mote lines than anyone else.
The others laughed.
‘It’s because of all that venison you ate!’
‘ If we consider quality rather than quantity,’ said Li Wan, ‘I think all the
contributions are of about equal merit. Except Bao-yu’s, of course. He goes to the
bottom of the list, as usual.’
‘I can’t do Linked Verses, anyway,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You have to make allowances for
me.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Li Wan, smiling, ‘but we can’t make allowances for you at
every single meeting. One time you’re in trouble because we have fixed rhymes,
another time you fail to turn up altogether, and this time you tell us you “can’t do
Linked Verses “I think this time there really has to be a penalty. I noticed just now
that the red plum in Green Bower Hermitage is very fine. I’d like to have broken off a
branch to put in a vase, but I find Adamantina such a difficult person that I prefer not
to have anything to do with her. The first part of your punishment shall be to get us a
branch of that red plum and put it in a vase here where all of us can admire it.’
‘What a delightful penalty!’ said the others. ‘How civil?ized!’
Bao-yu, too, was delighted with the penalty, but just as he was setting off to perform
it, Xiang-yun and Dai-yu simul?taneously rose to their feet and detained him.
‘It’s very, very cold outside. Have a cup of hot wine before you go.’
Xiang-yun already had the wine-kettle in her hand. Dai-yu found an extra large cup
for her to pour the wine in.
‘There!’ said Xiang-yun, filling it up to the brim. ‘If you come back empty-handed
now, after drinking our wine, we shall double the rest of your penalty when you get
back!’
Bao-yu quickly drank down the proffered cup of freshly heated wine and walked out
into the snow. Li Wan wanted to send a servant out after him, but Dai-yu intervened.
‘I wouldn’t, if I were you. If he has anyone else with him, he won’t be able to get
any.’
Knowing Adamantina, Li Wan reflected that this was probably true and nodded. She
sent the maids to fetch a large mei?ping vase with wide shoulders and a very narrow
neck to put the plum-blossom in when it arrived.
‘When he comes back, we must compose some red plum poems,’ she said.
‘I can do one now,’ said Bao-qin.
‘Oh no!’ said Bao-chai. ‘We’re not letting yon do any more. You’ve already hogged
enough turns for today. It’s no fun for the others if they are left with nothing to do.
No, it’s Bao-yu’s penalty we’ve got to think about, He said just now that he can’t do
Linked Verses. When he comes back we ought to make him do some other kind of
verses for us by himself.’
‘Good ideal’ said Dai-yu. ‘And I’ve got another idea. Several people didn’t get
sufficient opportunity in the Linked Verses of showing what they can do. I propose
that those who contributed least in the Linked Verses should be given the red plum
poems to do?
‘Yes, I agree,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Cousin Xing, Cousin Wen and Cousin Qi were
practically crowded out altogether—and they are, after all, our guests. Qin and Yun
and you, Frowner, hogged nearly all the turns. This time the rest of us ought to keep
out of it and let Cousin Xing and Cousin Wen and Cousin Qi have the floor to
themselves.’
‘Qi isn’t very good at making verses,’ said Li Wan. ‘I think you’d better give her place
to your cousin Bao-qin.’
This was scarcely what Bao-chai had intended, but she felt herself in no position to
dissent.
‘Why don’t we use the words “red plum flower” as rhymes?’ she suggested. ‘Each
of the three can do an octet on “Red Plum Flower”, but Cousin Xing can use “red” for
her rhyme, Cousin Wen can use “plum” for hers, and Qin can use flower”.’
‘We seem to be letting off Bao-yu,’ said Li Wan. ‘I can’t agree to that.’
‘Give him a separate theme,’ Xiang-yun suggested.
‘What theme shall we give him?’ the others asked.
‘What about “On Visiting the Nun Adamantina with a Request for Red Plum
blossom”?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘That might be interesting.’
‘Oh yes!’ said the others. ‘That would do splendidly.’
At that very moment the object of their discussion walked in, smiling triumphantly,
with a flowering plum-branch in his hand. The maids at once relieved him of it and
put it in the waiting vase, while the cousins crowded round them to admire it.
‘I hope you enjoy it, all -of you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It took me enough trouble to get!’
Tan-chun handed him a cup of hot wine to revive him; but first the maids removed
his cape and rain hat and shook the snow off them.
Maids from several different apartments now began arriving with extra-clothing for
their mistresses. Bao-yu’s Aroma sent him an old surtout lined with fox’s belly-fur. Li
Wan made the
servants fill three dishes, one with extra large steamed taros, the other two with
blood-oranges, yellow Canton oranges and olives, to take back to her.
Xiang-yun now told Bao-yu the title of the poem they wanted him to compose and
urged him to begin thinking a bout it.
‘I will,’ said Bao-yu; ‘but there’s just one thing I would ask of you all: please let me
use my own rhymes ; please don’t make me do it to set rhymes.’
‘All right,’ said the girls. ‘Use whatever rhymes you like.’ They had been admiring
the plum-blossom meanwhile. The vertical part of the branch—the part, that is,
which was stuck into the neck of the vase—must have been less than two feet high;
but growing at right-angles from the top of it was a side branch which rose and fell in
a spreading cascade of blossom all of four feet long. Of the branchlets forming this
flowery cascade

some were like writhing serpents,
some were like frozen worms;
some were as straight and smooth as a writing-brush,
some were as densely twigged as a tiny coppice.

As for the blossoms, they had

A colour like the rosy lips of love
And scent that made summer’s scents seem uninviting.

While the others-were studying the blossoming branch and praising its beauties, Xing
Xiu-yan, Li Wen and Bao-qin were busy composing their poems about it and
presently began writing them out for the others to inspect.
This is what the others were now able to read:

On a Branch of Red Plum Flower

I
Rhyming ‘red’                                   By Xing Xiu-yan

So brave, so gay they bloom in winter’s cold,
Before the fragrant peach and almond red;
Like rosy clouds that clothe the springtime slopes
Of Yu-ling, where my dream-soul oft has sped.
Each little lamp in its green calyx lies
Like drunken snow-sprite on a rainbow bed.
Yet do these flowers, of hue so rich and rare,
Reckless, in ice and snow their charms outspread.

II
Rhyming ‘plum’                          By Li Wen
What richness blooms before my drunken eyes?
’Tis not the white I sing, but the red plum.
See, its pale cheeks are streaked with blood-red tears,
Even though its bitter heart with cold is numb.
No flower this, but a fairy maid transformed
And here transplanted from Elysium
In this bleak North it makes such brave display,
I’ll tell the bees that spring’s already come.

III
Rhyming ‘flower’          By Xue Bao-qin

Like spendthrift youths in spring’s new fashions dressed,
Its bare thin branches burst in glorious flower.
Snow no more falls, but a bright rosy cloud
Tints hills and streams in one long sunset hour.
Through this red flood my dream-boat makes its way,
While flutes sound chill from many a maiden’s bower.
Sure from no earthly stock this beauty came,
But trees immortal round the Fairy Tower.

They read these poems with smiles of pleasure. There were words of praise for all
three of them; but Bao-qin’s, they finally agreed, was the best of the three. Bao-yu,
realizing that she was the youngest present, was greatly impressed. Dai-yu and
Xiang-yun between them poured out a tiny cupful of wine and offered it to her in
celebration of her victory.
‘All three were equally good,’ Bao-chai deprecatingly.
‘It was you two who in the past were always fooling me that poems were the best.
Now, it appears, you’ve found someone else to fool.’
‘What about you?’ Li Wan asked Bao-yu. ‘Is yours ready yet?’
‘I did have one ready,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but these three are so much better that reading
them has made me nervous and put it completely out of my mind. You’ll have to give
me a bit longer while I think up another.’
Xiang-yun picked up one of a pair of large bronze chop?sticks used as tongs for
feeding the stove with and beat a preliminary tattoo with it on her metal
hand-warmer.
‘I’ll drum for you;’ she said ‘If you can’t produce something each time the
drumming stops, we’ll double your penalty.’
‘I think I’ve got something,’ said Bao-yu. Dai-yu picked up a writing-brush, ‘I’ll write
it down for you while you recite it,’ she said. Xiang-yun struck up a tattoo.
‘Right!’ she said presently, as she stopped her drumming. ‘End of first round.’
‘Yes, I’ve got something,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Get ready to write.’

             ‘Wine not yet broached nor verses yet composed—’

Dai-yu wrote down the words, shaking her head as she did so.
‘That’s a very indifferent beginning.’
‘Come on!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Hurry!’ Bao-yu continued:

        ‘In quest of spring I sped to Elysium—

Dai-yu and Xiang-yun nodded.
‘Hmn. Not bad.’
Bao-yu went on:

             “Twas not the balm from Guanyin’s vase I craved
             Across that threshold, but her flowering plum—,

Dai-yu -shook her bead again as she wrote this down.
‘That’s a bit contrived, isn’t it?’
Xiang--yun began-another tattoo on the hand-warmer. When she finished, Bao-yu
continued at once:


‘A frozen worldling, for red flowers I begged;
The saint cut fragrant clouds and gave me some.
Pity my verse so angular and thin,
For convent snow has soaked it to the skin!’

As soon as Dai-yu had finished writing this down, Xiang-?yan and the rest began a
critical discussion of the whole poem. They were till in the midst of this when a little
maid dashed in to announce that Grandmother Jia was approaching. Bao-yu and the
girls hurried out, laughing and chattering, to welcome her.
‘She must be feeling in good spirits,’ they said, ‘to come out in the snow like this.’
Grandmother Jia was still quite a way off when they saw her. She was sitting in a little
bamboo carrying-chair and holding a green silk umbrella over herself. A large cape
and squirrel-lined hood almost completely enveloped her. Faithful, Amber and three
or four other maids, all carrying their own umbrellas, formed a little escort around
the chair and its bearers. Li Wan and the others would have gone out into the snow
to meet her, but Grandmother Jia called out to them to stay where they were.
‘Wait there under cover. I’ll come over to you..’
‘ I’ve given Feng and your Aunt Wang the slip,’ she told them, chuckling
mischievously, when the chair had reached them and they were helping her out of it.
It’s all right for me, going out in all this snow, because I’m sitting in this thing; but I
didn’t want them trudging along in the snow beside me, get?ting cold and miserable.’
Some of them relieved her of her snow-clothes while others supported her on either
-side and conducted her into the room where the heated kang was.
‘What pretty plum-blossom!’ she said as they entered it. ‘You children certainly
know bow to enjoy yourselves. I feel quite angry with you for not inviting me!’
Li Wan made the servants bring in a big wolfskin rug and spread it out in the middle
of the kang for Grandmother Jia to sit on.
‘Now you just all go on enjoying yourselves exactly as you were before I came,’ said
the old lady when she had settled herself on the rug. ‘I daren’t sleep after lunch at
this time of year, because the days are so short. I had a little game of dominoes
instead; then I started wondering what you were all up to and thought I would come
over and join you.’
Li Wan handed her a hand-warmer while Tan-chun fetched a winecup and a pair of
chopsticks, poured out a cup of warm wine, and offered it to her with both her hands.
Grandmother Jia accepted it from her and sipped the wine.
‘What have you got in that dish over there?’ she asked them.
‘Pickled quails,’ said one of the cousins, bringing the dish over for her inspection.
‘That will do very nicely,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tear off a little leg for me, will
you?’
Li Wan called for water, and having first washed her hands, performed the operation
for her in person.
‘Now I want you all to sit down again and go on talking,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It
does me good to hear you. —You too,’ she said to Li Wan. ‘You’re to sit down as well.
I want you to behave exactly as if I hadn’t come. Otherwise I shall go away again.’
At this the others resumed their former places—all except bearers turned into this
and put the chair down just inside it for Grandmother Jia to get out. Xi-chun was
already waiting there to welcome her and conducted them all through the covered
way which ran round the sides of the courtyard from the gateway to her living
quarters at the back. A framed board hanging underneath the eaves announced the
name of the building:

SPRING IN WINTER.



Servants held up the red felt portiere for them as they approached its doorway. They
could feel the hot air fanning their cheeks as they entered it.
Grandmother Jia tackled Xi-chun as soon as they were in?side, not even waiting to sit
down.
‘What’s happened to the painting?’
‘The glue gets tacky in this cold weather,’ said Xi-chun. ‘It stops the paint from going
on properly. I’ve put the painting away because I was afraid it might get spoiled.’
Grandmother Jia brushed aside this excuse with a dis?missive laugh.
‘I want that painting ready by the end of the year. Don’t be so lazy! Fetch it out at
once and get on with it, my girl!’
Just then a smiling Xi-feng made her appearance. A purplish woollen gabardine was
thrown loosely over her shoulders.
‘You’ve led me a fine dance,’ she grumbled, ‘sneaking off on your own like this!’
The old lady was delighted to see her.
‘I didn’t want you all catching colds; that’s why I told them not to let you know I
was going out. I suppose I ought to have realized that that sharp little nose of yours
would soon ferret me out again. You mustn’t think you are being dutiful in tracking
me down like this.’
‘Being dutiful!’ said Xi-feng. ‘That’s not at all the reason why I came out to look for
you. Just now when I went round to your apartment I found it all deathly quiet, and it
was quite clear from the maids’ answers, when I tried to find out where you had
gone, that they didn’t want me to go into the Garden to look for you. That aroused
my suspicions; and when a moment later a couple of nuns appeared on the scene,
my suspicions were confirmed: I realized that they must have come to make their
annual collection for some charity or other and that my dear, saintly Grannie, who no
doubt has rather a lot of subscriptions to pay out at this time of year, had gone into
hiding to avoid them. I asked the nuns, and sure enough it was for your annual
subscription that they had come. I paid it for you myself. So now your creditors have
gone, you can come out of hiding. You ought to be getting back now in any case.
You’ve got some nice, tender pheasant for dinner and if you leave it much longer it
will spoil.’
All this was spoken, of course, to the accompaniment of much laughter from the
others. Before Grandmother Jia could say anything in reply, Xi-feng had ordered the
bearers to bring up the bamboo carrying-chair and Grandmother Jia, in laughing
acquiescence, took Xi-feng’s hand, got back into it, and was at once lifted up and
whisked away by the bearers. The others followed after, chattering and laughing as
they went.
As they emerged from the east end of the alley-way into the silvery snowscape of the
Garden, they could see Bao-qin, identifiable by the glossy green mallard-cape,
standing a long way off behind the shoulder of a little hill, waiting for the rest of
them to arrive. A maid, hugging a large vase with a branch of red plum in it, was
standing behind her.
‘So there she is!’ said the others. ‘We thought there seemed to be two of us
missing. And she’s got herself some plum ?blossom, as well.’
Grandmother Jia smiled proprietorially at the distant figure.
‘What does that remind you all of, seeing her there on that snowy bank, wearing a
cape like that and with the spray of plum-blossom behind her?’
‘Why,’ they said, ‘it’s like that painting by Qiu Ying you have hanging in your room:
“The Beauty of the Snow”.’
Grandmother Jia shook her head.
‘No, the girl in that picture isn’t wearing a cape like that—and she isn’t half as
pretty as Qin, either.’
Just at that moment a third figure, previously invisible, stepped out from behind
Bao-qin’s back. Whoever it was was wearing a red felt snow-cape.
‘Which of the girls is that?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘There aren’t any more girls; we’re all here,’ said the others laughing. ‘That’s
Bao-yu.’
‘My eyes are getting worse and worse,’ said Grandmother Jia. Soon they had caught
up with the three figures on the hill and she could see that it was indeed Bao-yu
whom she had failed to recognize with Bao-qin and the maid.
‘ I’ve been over to Green Bower Hermitage again,’ Bao-yu told the girls.
‘Adamantina ended up by giving me a branch of plum-blossom for each of you. I’ve
just been arranging to have them delivered to your rooms.’
The others thanked him for his kindness.
Talking as they went, they presently passed through the gate of the Garden and
accompanied Grandmother Jia back to her apartment. After dinner, while they were
still sitting there in conversation, Aunt Xue arrived.
‘What a heavy fall of snow!’ she said. ‘I haven’t been able to come over and see
you all day long. You ought to go out and have a look at it, Lady Jia, if you are feeling
low. It would do you good.’
‘Who said I was feeling low?’ said Grandmother Jia with some amusement. ‘I’ve
only just got back from visiting the children. I’ve been having a fine old time!’
‘Oh?’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Yesterday evening I was intending to ask if my sister and I
could have the use of the Garden today so that we might arrange a little
snow-viewing party for you, but you’d already gone to bed, and Bao-chai said that
you were feeling out of Sorts, so I thought I’d better not bother you. If I’d known
differently, I’d have come round this morning and invited you.’
‘We’re only just into the eleventh month,’ said Grand?mother Jia. ‘There’ll be
plenty more snow yet and plenty more opportunities for taking advantage of your
kind offer.’
‘I do hope so,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘It’s something I should very much like to do for you.’
‘Isn’t there a danger you might forget, Aunt?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not weigh out fifty
taels now and leave them with me? Then next time it snows, I can get it all ready for
you. That would save you the trouble of arranging it yourself and also avoid the
danger of your forgetting.’
‘In that case you and I might just as well split the money between us,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘Next time it snows, all I have to do is say that I’m feeling out of
sorts, and you won’t have to do anything at all. That way Mrs Xue will have even less
trouble, while you and I will each of us have twenty-five taels cleat profit.’
Xi-feng clapped her hands delightedly.
‘What a wonderful idea! Why didn’t I think of it myself?’
The others laughed.
‘Shameless hussy!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing with the rest. ‘You’re-like the
monkey on the pole: give you an inch and you take an ell. What you ought to have
said is: “No, Aunt, you are our guest Since you honour us by staying in our house, it is
we who should be inviting you. We can’t allow you to go spending money on us.”
That’s what you ought to have said; not asked your poor aunt for fifty taels. Whoever
heard of such a thing!’
‘She’s a canny old lady, this Grandma of ours,’ Xi-feng explained to Aunt Xue. ‘She
watches you first to see if you’ll weaken or not. If you’d weakened and coughed up
the fifty taels, she’d have been quite willing to go halves with me and pocket
twenty-five of them herself; but having gauged that you probably won’t, she adopts a
holier-than-thou attitude and makes an example of me, even though she was the one
who suggested it. All right, all right. I’ll pay for the whole party myself, and when
Grandma arrives, I’ll have fifty taels out of my own savings wrapped up all ready to
give her as a present. That shall be my punishment for having opened my big mouth
and occupied myself with other people’s affairs.’
Bao-yu and the girls were by this time rolling about on the kang.
Presently, when the conversation got round to what a beautiful picture Bao-qin had
made standing in the snow with the spray of plum-blossom behind her, Grandmother
Jia began inquiring about her parentage and the exact day and hour of her birth.
Aunt Xue guessed that she was considering her as a possible match for Bao-yu. She
would have been glad enough to go along with this had not Bao-qin already been
promised to the Meis; however, since Grandmother Jia had not asked her outright,
she could do no more than hint at a prior attach?ment.
‘She’s been very unlucky, poor child. The year before last her father died quite
suddenly. She used to go with him every-where on his travels, so she has seen a great
deal of the world for one so young. Her father was a great one for combining
business with pleasure. He always took the family with him when he went away on
business. They would spend perhaps a whole year in one province, seeing all the
sights; then the next six months they might spend travelling around in another. At
one time and another they must have covered well over half the provinces of the
Empire in that way. While he was on one of his trips to the capital, he promised her
to Academician Mei’s boy, but unfortunately it was in the year after that he died, so
nothing could be done about it. And now her poor mother has gone down with a
consumption...’
Xi-feng interrupted, sighing and stamping her foot in an exaggerated display of
disappointment.
‘Oh, what a shame! I was just going to offer my services as a match-maker, but it
seems that she’s already betrothed.’
Who did you have in mind?’ Grandmother Jia asked her. ‘Never you mind!’ said
Xi-feng. ‘I’m sure they would have made a very good pair; but since she’s already got
someone else, there doesn’t seem any point in discussing it.’
Grandmother Jia knew very well whom Xi-feng had in mind, but hearing that Bao-qin
was already spoken for, she dropped the subject and made no further mention of it.
The company talked for a while longer before breaking-up; but of the rest of that day
and the night which followed our narrative supplies no account.

*
Next day the snow had cleared. After lunch Grandmother Jia told Xi-chun that, cold
or no cold, she must get on with the painting as quickly as possible.
‘If you really can’t get it finished by the end of the year,’ she said, ‘it doesn’t matter.
But what you must do is get Bao-qin with the maid and the branch of plum-blossom
into it. I want you to do that straight away; and they are to be painted exactly as they
looked when we saw them on that bank yester?day.’
Xi-chun said that she would, though miserably aware that she would find doing so
extremely difficult. Later, when the others went round to her place to see how she
was getting on, she was pondering gloomily over this latest problem. Li Wan
somewhat heartlessly proposed that they should leave her to her own thoughts and
carry on their conversation without her.
‘When we got back from Grandmother’s last night,’ she said, ‘Qi and Wen and I
were unable to get to sleep, so we lay in bed making up riddles. I made up two using
quotations from the Four Books and the other two each made up one.’
‘Ah yes, that’s what we all ought to be doing,’ said the others. ‘Tell us your four first
and we’ll try to guess the answers.
‘Guan-yin lacks a biography,’ said Li Wan. ‘The answer is a phrase from the Four
Books.’
                    ‘Resting in the highest good,’
Xiang-yun promptly suggested.
‘What’s that got to do with “biography”?’ said Bao-chai.
‘Try again,’ said Li Wan.
‘I know,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Isn’t it

             ... though good, yet having no memorial?’


‘Ah yes, that must be it,’ said the others.
‘What is the green plant that grows in the water?’ said Li Wan.
‘That just has to be
                     ‘It is a fast-growing rush,’

said xiang-yun. ‘I don’t see how that ‘could be wrong.’
‘Good for you!’ said Li Wan. ‘Now here is Wen’s riddle:

             Beside the rocks the water runs cold.

It’s the name of an historical person.’
‘That must be “Shan Tao”,’ said Tan-chun. ‘His surname means “mountain”—that’s
the “rocks”—and “Tao” means “billows”
‘Right,’ said Li Wan. ‘Now Qi’s riddle is just a single word:

                       Firefly

The answer is a single- word, too.’
They all puzzled for a long time over this without being able to think of any answer. It
was Bao-qin who finally came up with the solution.
‘Yes, I see. It’s rather involved. The answer is “flower” isn’t it?—I mean the flower
that grows.’
Li Qi acknowledged smilingly that this was correct.
‘What has “flower” got to do with “firefly”?’ the others asked her.
Bao-qin explained:
‘In the Record of Rites it says
              Corrupt grass by transmutation breedeth fireflies.
Now the character for “flower” is written with “grass” at the top and “change”—or, if
you     like,     “transmutation”—under?neath.        So      “corrupt    grass  by
transmutation”—which, accord?ing to the Rites, produces fireflies—makes the
character for “flower
The others laughingly acknowledged that the riddle was an ingenious one.
‘All four of these riddles are very good,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I don’t think they are
quite the sort of thing that Lady Jia had in mind. I think we ought to make up some
about fairly easy, everyday objects, so that those of us who aren’t quite so learned
can enjoy them as well.’
Xiang-yun thought for a bit.
‘I’ve got one,’ she said presently. ‘It’s in the form of a “Ruby Lips” stanza:

             Far away
         From the high fell
         Where I used to dwell
         Amidst men I play.
         But for what gain?
         My labour’s vain;
         My tale is hard to tell.’

No one was able to make out what this could be. After puzzling for a long time, they
produced a number of different guesses. Someone thought it was ‘a monk’; someone
else thought it was ‘a Taoist’; a third person suggested that it might be ‘a marionette
player’.
‘You’re all wrong,’ said Bao-yu, who had been grinning silently to himself while the
others guessed, ‘I’ve thought of the answer. It’s “a performing monkey”.’
‘That’s it” said Xiang-yun.
‘We can understand the first part all right,’ said the others; ‘but what about the last
line? What’s that supposed to mean?’
‘Have you ever seen a performing monkey that hadn’t had its tail docked?’ said
Xiang-yun.
Groans and laughter.
‘Trust Yun’s to have a frightful pun in it—as if the riddle wasn’t hard enough
already!’
‘Mrs Xue was telling us yesterday that you’ve travelled a lot and been to all sorts of
interesting places,’ Li Wan said to Bao-qin. ‘With so much material you ought to be
just the person for making up riddles—especially as you’re so good at verse-making
as well. Why don’t you make up a few, and the rest of us will try to guess them?’
Bao-qin said nothing, but smiled and nodded, and at once went off into a corner to
think.
Bao-chai had now composed a riddle, too, and recited it for them to try and guess
while Bao-qin was doing her thinking.

                 ‘Tier upon compact tier of fragrant wood:
                 No craftsman’s hand could carve one half so well.
                 A gale blows all about the temple’s eaves,
                 Yet, though it shakes, no sound comes from my bell.’

While the others were still trying to guess the answer to this, Bao-yu recited one that
he had just completed himself:

                 ‘’Twixt heaven and earth amidst the clouds so high
             Bamboo gives warning to the passer-by.
             Eyes strain some feathered traveller to descry
                 Who’ll bear my answer back into the sky.’

Dai-yu also had one ready, and proceeded to recite it to them:
             ‘See my little prancing steed!
             Of silken rein he has no need,
             Round the city wall he goes,
            Wreaking havoc on his foes.
            At his master’s touch he moves
            With thunder of advancing hooves.
            In isles by tortoises supported
            His deeds are honourably reported.’
Tan-chun, too had composed a riddle, but as she was on the point of reciting it,
Bao-qin came back from her corner to announce that she had finished.
‘I’ve been visiting places of historical interest ever since I was little,’ she said, ‘so I
really have seen quite a lot. What I’ve done now is to choose ten of them, mostly
associated with some famous person or other, and make up a poem about each one.
The verses themselves may sound rather like doggerel, but the point about them is
that, as well as commemorating these famous places and people, each of them
contains hidden references to some common object which you have to guess.’
‘Ah, that sounds very ingenious!’ they said. ‘But why not write them down, so that
we can take our time thinking about them?’
What happened next will be related in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 51

A clever cousin composes some ingenious riddles
And an unskillful physician prescribes a barbarous remedy

WHEN Bao-qin explained that the riddles she had composed were in the form of
quatrains, each containing a clue to some well-known object, about famous places
she had visited in the course of her travels, the cousins were greatly impressed, and
waited with eagerness for her to copy them out. This is what they read when she had
finished doing so :

Red Cliff
             The river at Red Cliff was choked with the dead,
             And the ships without crew carried naught but their names.
             A clamour and shouting, a wind took the blaze,
             And a host of brave souls rode aloft in the flames.

*
Hanoi
             His column of brass bade the nations obey:
             The noise of him spread through barbarian parts.
             Brave Ma Yuan to conquest and empire was born:
             He needed no Iron Flute to teach him those arts.

*
Mt Zhong-shan
           Though ambition had never been part of your nature
           And the call from retirement was none of your choosing,
           You danced in the end at another’s commandment,
           So you can’t be surprised if we find it amusing.

*
Huai-yin
             The brave must beware of the vicious dog’s bite:
             The gift of a throne on your fate set the seal.
             Let us learn from your story the humble to prize,
             And due gratitude show for the gift of a meal.

Guang-ling
             Your crows and cicadas no more you shall hear
             By the old Sui embankment back home in the South;
             But the scandalous story of those wanton times
             Wags in many an idle, unsavoury mouth.

*
Peach Leaf Ford
            In the waters a scene of decay is reflected;
            Long since from its bough did the last peach-leaf fall.
            Your old Southern mansion has tumbled in ruins,
            And only your likeness looks down from the wall.

*
Green Mound
          The Amur’s black flood for pure grief is arrested;
          The frozen string twangs with a heartbroken sound;
          And, deploring the harsh rule that ordered this exile,
          A few crooked trees bow in shame to the ground.

*
Ma-wei
            The sad, ravaged face seemed to shine in its sweat;
Then soon that sweet softness all vanished away.
            Yet something remained, for the well-known perfume
            In the clothing she wore lingers on to this day.

*
The Monastery at Pu-dong
           Young Reddie was ever a light, empty creature,
           Always to-ing and fro-ing in all kinds of weather.
           Though her Mistress in ire hung her up from the ceiling,
           Those two had already been walking together.

  *
The Plum-tree Shrine
            ‘’Twill be by the willow and not by the plum.’
            But who is it there will her likeness discover?
            Let not her full moon make you think that Spring’s coming,
            For the cold parts her now till next year from her lover.

After reading these poems, the cousins all praised the re?markable ingenuity with
which they had been constructed. Only Bao-chai was critical:
‘The first eight of these poems have historically verifiable subjects, but what about
the last two? I’m afraid I don’t quite understand what they are about. I think you
ought to make up another two to replace them with.’
‘Don’t be so stuffy, Chai!’ said Dai-yu. ‘Talk about “gluing the bridges of the zither”!
It’s true that the subjects of those last two poems can’t be found in the history books,
but how can you say that you don’t know what they are? Even if, as well-bred young
ladies, we may not read the books in which they are to be found, we’ve all watched
plenty of plays. Every three-year-old child is familiar with these stories. It’s sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that you’ve never heard of them.’
‘Hear, hear!’ said Tan-chun.
‘In any case,’ said Li Wan, ‘she has actually been to the places associated with the
stories, even if the stories them?selves are unhistorical. Stories pick up all kinds of
circum?stantial detail in the course of centuries of re-telling. Sooner or later some
know-all invariably equips them with a location in order to fool more people into
believing them. I remember on my journey here when I first came up to the capital
we visited three or four different sites all claiming to be the burial-place of Guan Yu.
Now no one doubts that Guan Yu actually existed or that he actually did the heroic
things he is supposed to have done; but he can’t have been buried in more than one
grave. Obviously the tradition that he was buried in those places was invented by
people—living long after Guan Yu’s death who loved and admired Guan Yu and all
that he had stood for and wanted to claim him for themselves. And if you look in. the
Geographical Gazetteer, you’ll find that it isn’t only Guan Yu who has graves in several
different places: practic?ally all the famous men who ever lived appear to have been
buried in more than one place. And when it comes to sites which are famous because
of people who never even existed, they are still more numerous. It may well be that
the people those last two poems are about didn’t exist; but though the stories about
them are unhistorical, they are certainly well-known. You can hear them told -by
story-tellers; you can see them acted on the stage; you can even find references to
them on the divination-sticks that people tell their fortunes with in temples. There
can’t be a man, woman or child who isn’t familiar with them. And even if one knows
them from the books, it can hardly be said that to have read a few lyrics from The
Western Chamber or The Soul’s Return is tantamount to reading pornography. No, I
see no harm in these two poems. I think she should leave them as they are.’
This, coming from Li Wan, effectively silenced Bao-chai’s objection.
Some time was now spent in trying to guess answers to the riddles concealed in
these poems, but all of their guesses were wrong.
The days in winter are very short and in no time at all, it seemed, they were trooping
back into the mansion for their dinner. While they were there, a message arrived for
Lady Wang to say that Aroma’s brother, Hua Zi-fang, had come and was waiting
outside in the front.
His mother is seriously ill and has been asking to see Aroma,’ said the messenger. He
asks if, as a special kindness, you will allow her to go home and see her.’
‘We shouldn’t dream of preventing a mother from seeing her daughter under such
circumstances,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Of course she may go.’
She called for Xi-feng and, having explained the situation to her, left it to her to
decide what arrangements should be made for Aroma’s departure. Xi-feng promised
to attend to the matter and hurried back to her own apartment to do so. She told
Zhou Rui’s wife to break the news to Aroma about her mother. She also gave detailed
instructions for the visit.
‘Get hold of another of the women in your group to go with you as second
chaperone. And take two of the junior maids with you as well. And you’ll want four of
the grooms from the front. Take responsible ones: not too young. Tell them you’ll
need two carriages, one large and one small. You two can sit in the larger one with
Aroma, and the two maids can go in the smaller one.’
Zhou Rui’s wife was on the point of going off to execute these orders, but Xi-feng had
evidently not finished.
‘Aroma’s a girl who doesn’t like fuss. You’d better tell her that it’s my wish that she
should dress herself up in the very best things she’s got. Tell her to take a good big
bundle of extra clothes with her as well. The cloth it’s wrapped in is to be of the
highest quality. Her hand-warmer is to be a good one, too. And tell her that before
she goes I want her to come here so that I can have a look at her.’
Zhou Rui’s wife went off to do her bidding. In due course Aroma herself arrived,
dressed up in all her finery. She was accompanied by Zhou Rui’s wife and the other
woman and by two little maids, one carrying her bundle and the other one her
hand-warmer. Xi-feng proceeded at once to inspect her, begin?ning at the top.
Aroma’s hair, liberally studded with pearled and golden jewellery, was satisfactory;
her clothing, it seemed, less so. She had on an ermine-lined silk tapestry dress of
peach-pink satin, sprigged with a pattern of different sorts of flowers, a leek-green
padded skirt embroidered in couched gold thread and coloured silks, and a black
satin jacket lined with squirrel.
‘I see. These are all things that Her Ladyship gave you. That’s good. But the jacket is
too plain. And it’s not warm enough for the time of year, either. You want something
with a heavier fur in it.’
‘This is the only one she gave me,’ said Aroma, ‘and the only other one I’ve got is
lined with ermine. She promised me one with a heavier fur in time for the New Year,
but I haven’t been given it yet.’
‘I’ve got one with a heavier fur which I haven’t worn be?cause the trimmings don’t
suit me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’d been meaning to get it altered, but I could let you have it
now if you like and you can give it back to me to have altered when Her Ladyship gets
this other one made that she’s promised you. We’ll call it a loan.’
The servants laughed.
‘You like to have your little joke, Mrs Lian. All the year round you’re handing things
out on the quiet that Her Lady?ship has overlooked, yet you never ask her for any
thing back for them. Why so stingy all of a sudden about a little old jacket?’
‘Her Ladyship can’t be expected to remember everything,’ said Xi-feng, ‘and these
are, after all, rather trifling matters. Of course, someone has to think about them, for
the sake of appearances. Even if it leaves me a bit out of pocket, I’ve got to see that
everyone is dressed decently. If that gets me a reputation for being generous well,
that’s just one of the hardships I must learn to put up with! It would be much worse
to have everyone going around looking like tramps. Think of the jokes I should hear
about my housekeeping then!’
‘ There can’t be many like you, Mrs Lian,’ said the women admiringly, ‘so
considerate towards Her Ladyship and yet at the same time so thoughtful towards us
servants. You really do think of everything.’
While they were praising her, Xi-feng was already ordering Patience to fetch the
jacket she had mentioned. It had in fact arrived from the tailor’s only a day or two
previously. It was a very grand one, in slate-blue satin, with eight large,
embroidery-like silk tapestry roundels woven into it, and with a lining of arctic fox.
After giving Aroma the jacket, Xi-feng inspected her bundle. The carrying-cloth was of
silk gauze in a nondescript black-and-white pattern, lined with strawberry?coloured
silk. All she had got wrapped up in it were a couple of padded dresses, by no means
new, and her other fur-lined jacket. Xi-feng told Patience to fetch a better
carrying-cloth-one made of a good-quality foreign broadcloth and lined with
turquoise-coloured silk—and a snow-cape to add to the con?tents of her bundle.
Patience went off to get them. When she came back she was carrying not one
snow-cape but two: one of them, in dark-red felt, showed signs of wear; the other, in
dark-red camlet, seemed to be almost new.
Aroma protested.
‘I can’t possibly take both of these,’ she said. ‘Even one of these would seem a bit
on the grand side for me.’
‘Just pack the felt one,’ said Patience. ‘You can carry the other one on your arm and
on your way out get someone to take it over to Miss Xing. Yesterday when we had
that heavy snow there were ten or a dozen of them all wearing felt or camlet
snow-capes. They made quite a picture in their red capes against the background of
white snow. She was the only one there who hadn’t got one. She looked all
hunched-up with the cold, poor thing: I felt really sorry for her. Let her have the
camlet one.’
‘See how liberal she is with my possessions,’ Xi-feng expostulated jokingly. ‘Heavens,
girl, I give enough away already without needing you to help me!’
‘Like mistress, like maid,’ said the woman who had spoken before. ‘It’s because you
yourself are so considerate towards Her Ladyship and so kind to us servants that she
feels free to behave in that way. If you were a mean. tight-fisted sort of person, she’d
never dare.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘I suppose you could say that she understands me a bit—about thirty per cent
perhaps!’
She turned back to Aroma to deliver her parting in?structions.
‘We must hope that your mother recovers, but if by any chance she doesn’t, you
will obviously have .to stay on for a bit. Let me know, in that case, and I’ll have your
bedding sent on to you. Don’t use their bedding or any of their toilet things.’ She
turned to Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘You know our rules, don’t you? I don’t need to go over
them again.’
‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘All their people are to keep away from us while
we are there, and if we stay they have to give us one or two inside rooms to
ourselves.’
With that she accompanied Aroma outside and called to the pages to fetch lanterns,
for it was already getting dark. The little party then made its way to the carriages,
and having dis?posed themselves inside them, were driven off to Hua Zi?-fang’s
house, where our story leaves them.

*

Back at the mansion Xi-feng summoned two of the nannies from Green Delights.
‘I doubt very much whether Aroma will be coming back for a day or two,’ she told
them. ‘You’d better tell whichever two of the senior maids you think are most
reliable to be on call at night in Bao-yu’s room while she is away. And keep an eye on
things yourselves. See that he doesn’t get up to mischief.’
The two women went off, saying that they would attend to the matter, and a little
later came back to report on what they had arranged.
‘We’ve put Skybright and Musk on night-call in his room. There are always four of
us outside, of course. We take it in turns to be on duty throughout the night.’ Xi-feng
nodded.
‘See that he goes to bed early and doesn’t get up too late.’
The old women promised, and went back into the Garden.
Not long after this Zhou Rui’s wife returned with the mes?sage that Xi-feng had been
half expecting: Aroma’s mother had already breathed her last and Aroma would be
unable to come back. Xi-feng went off to report this news to Lady Wang. She also
sent someone into the Garden to collect Aroma’s bedding and toilet things. Bao-yu
stood by and supervised, while Skybright and Musk got them ready.
When Aroma’s things bad been despatched, the two girls removed their hair
ornaments and changed into their night-clothes. Skybright showed no disposition,
after changing, to remove herself from the clothes-warmer over which she was
crouched.
‘Now don’t start acting the young lady,’ said Musk. ‘I advise you to stir yourself a
bit.’
‘I’ll stir myself soon enough when you are out of the way,’ said Skybright. ‘As long as
you are around, I might as well take it easy.’
‘Now come on, there’s a good girl!’ said busy Musk. ‘I’ll make his bed and you can
put the covet over the dressing-mirror and fasten the catch. You’re taller than I am.’
She bustled off and began making up Bao-yu’s bed.
‘Hail’ said Skybright disgustedly. ‘Just as I was beginning to get warm!’
Bao-yu, who up to that moment had been sitting apart, abstractedly wondering
about Aroma’s mother (he had still not been told of her death), chanced suddenly to
catch this remark. At once he got up, went into the next room, and attended to the
dressing-mirror himself,
‘Carry on warming yourself,’ he said with a smile to Skybright as he came in again,
‘I’ve done it for you.’
‘I don’t think I shall ever get warm,’ said Skybright. And I’ve just remembered: I
haven’t brought in the hot-water bottle.’
‘How thoughtful we are all of a sudden!’ said Musk. ‘He never has a hot-water
bottle. And we shan’t need one tonight. It’ll be much -warmer in here on the
clothes-warmer than it is on the kang in the other room.’
‘You’re not both going to sleep on the clothes-warmer, are you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I
shall be scared, all on my own in the closet-bed with nobody near me. I shan’t be
able to sleep.’
‘Well, I’m sleeping on the clothes-warmer at all events,’ said Skybright. ‘Let Musk
sleep beside the closet-bed.’
The time was well after nine. Musk, who had by this time let down the curtains,
moved the lamp to its night-time position, and lit the slow-burning incense, now
helped Bao-yu into bed and tucked him up. After that she and Skybright themselves
settled down for the night, Skybright on top of the clothes-warmer and Musk outside
the curtains which separ?ated the alcove of the closet-bed from the rest of the room.
Some time in the middle watch of the night Bao-yu called out for Aroma a couple of
times in his sleep and, not getting the customary response, woke up. Awake he
remembered, with some amusement, that Aroma was not there to answer. The noise
he made had woken Skybright, who called out from where she lay to Musk.
‘Musk! He’s even woken me up, over here. Do you mean to say you really haven’t
heard anything, lying there right beside him? You must sleep like a corpse!
Musk turned over and yawned.
‘He was calling for Aroma; what’s it got to do with me? What do you want?.’ she
asked Bao-yu.
‘I want some tea,’ he said.
Musk hopped out of bed to get him some. She was wearing only a quilted red silk
tunic.
‘You’ll get cold,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Put my fur gown on.’ She picked up the winter
dressing-gown that lay always ready beside him, in case he should need to get up
during the night. It was lined with the orange-yellow chest fur of pine-martens and
had a big fur collar. Slipping the gown over her shoulders, Musk first washed her
hands in the basin, then she poured him a cup of hot water and held the spittoon for
him to spit into when he had washed his mouth out. After that she took a teacup
from the shelf where the tea-things were kept, rinsed it out with hot water, and filled
it from a pot in a padded wicker case in which ready-brewed tea was kept warm for
such emergencies. Having ministered to Bao-yu’s wants, she rinsed her own mouth
out with the hot water and poured half a cup of tea out for herself.
‘Musk,’ Skybright called out to her, ‘give us a drop too, there’s a dear!’
‘What a nerve!’
‘Go on!’ said Skybright. ‘Tomorrow night you can lie back all night long and let me
wait on you.’
Musk held out the spittoon, as she had done for Bao-yu, while Skybright rinsed her
mouth out, then fetched her half a cupful of tea.
‘Don’t go to sleep yet, you two,’ she said, as soon as Sky?bright had been attended
to. ‘Keep talking while I go outside for a hit.’
‘There’s a ghost waiting for you out there,’ said Skybright. ‘There’s no ghost out
there, but there’s a very fine moon,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Go ahead: we’ll keep talking, don’t
worry!’
He coughed significantly.
Musk opened the door and lifted up the felt portière. There was, as Bao-yu had
predicted, a beautiful moon outside. As soon as she had gone out, Skybright slipped
down from the clothes-warmer and tip-toed after her, intending to give her a scare.
Physically the hardiest of the maids and, as a rule, the one who was least afraid of
the cold, she went as she was, with nothing but a short tunic to cover her. Bao-yu
tried to dis?suade her from going out.
‘I wouldn’t, if I were you. If you catch cold, it won’t be quite so funny.’
But Skybright motioned impatiently to him to be quiet and crept out of the door.
The .moonlight outside was like water. Suddenly she heard the wind. It was only a
brief, faint gust, but the chill of it penetrated to the marrow of her bones and made
her shudder.
‘It’s certainly true what they say about a warm body fearing the wind,’ she reflected.
‘This cold is really no joke.’
She was still determined to frighten Musk; but just as she was about to do so, Bao-yu
called out in a loud voice from indoors.
‘Careful Musk! Skybright’s outside.’
Immediately Skybright ran in again.
What an old woman you are!’ she said. ‘The shock wouldn’t have killed her.’
‘I wasn’t thinking about that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was worried about your catching cold;
and besides, if she’d called out when you startled her she might have woken
somebody up, and you know what it would have been like then. They’d never have
believed it was a practical joke, they’d have said, “Just look, Aroma only away for a
single night and already the girls in his room are seeing things. Not one of them’s to
be trusted.” Come on, come over here and tuck this quilt in for me.’
Skybright went over to arrange his bedding. While she was doing so, she stuck one of
her hands inside the cover and held it against his skin.
‘Your hand is freezing!’ he said. ‘I told you you’d get cold.’ He noticed how red her
cheeks were and put out his hand to touch them. They were as cold as ice.
‘Quick, you’d better get inside here and warm up,’ he said. Just as she did so, there
was a loud bang and Musk rushed giggling into the room, slamming the door behind
her.
‘Whew, what a shock I’ she said. ‘I thought I saw someone crouching down in the
shadows behind the rockery. Actually it was that long-tailed pheasant. I was just
going to cry out, when it heard me coming and flew up into the light, so that I could
see what it was. If I’d lost my head and started scream?ing, I might have woken
everybody up.’
She said this while washing her hands. Presently she finished washing and laughed.
‘Did you say Skybright had gone outside? I wonder why I didn’t see her. I bet she
went outside to scare me.’
‘What’s this lump here then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘She’s down in here getting warm. She
did go outside. If I hadn’t called out when I did, she would have scared you.’
‘She doesn’t need me to scare her, silly little goose!’ said Skybright, laughing, from
inside the bedclothes. ‘By the looks of it she’s perfectly capable of scaring herself!’
She emerged from Bao-yu’s bedding now and crossed the room to the
clothes-warmer to get inside her own. Musk gazed at her incredulously as she did so.
‘Is that all you were wearing when you went outside, that circus rider’s outfit
you’ve got on now ?’
‘That’s all she was wearing,’ said Bao-yu.
‘You’ll die before your time!’ said Musk. ‘What, standing around with only that on?
It’s enough to freeze the skin off you!’
She took the copper cover off the brazier and damped down the glowing charcoal by
shovelling some ash on to it with the fire shovel. Before replacing the cover, she
threw on a couple of pieces of agalloch to sweeten the air. Then she went behind the
screen and trimmed the lamp up. After that she too went back to bed.
The effect on Skybright of the sudden change of tempera?ture was to make her
sneeze. Bao-yu groaned.
‘I told you so. You have caught a cold.’
‘She was complaining that she -didn’t feel too good when we got up this morning,’
said Musk, ‘and she hasn’t eaten properly all day. Yet instead of looking after herself
she has to go playing pranks on people outside. It will be her own silly fault if she is ill
tomorrow.’
‘Does your head feel hot?’ Bao-yu asked Skybright.
Skybright coughed a few times.
‘It’s nothing,’ she said, ‘I’m not that delicate!’
Just then the chiming clock that hung on the partition in the outer room struck twice
and they heard the old woman on night duty cough a couple of times and call out:
‘Go to sleep, young ladies! There’ll be plenty of time for talking in the morning.’
Bao-yu gave a subdued chuckle.
‘Better not talk any more,’ he said. ‘We don’t want them talking about us.’
After that the three of them settled down and went to sleep again.
When Skybright got up next morning, her nose was stuffed up’ her voice was hoarse,
and the slightest movement cost her an effort.
‘We’d better keep this dark,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If my mother gets to hear of it, she’s sure
to insist on your going back home until you’re better; and however nice it may be at
your home, I’m sure it won’t be so warm as here, so you’ll be better off with us. I’ll
get a doctor in through the back gate to have a look at you on the quiet.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Skybright, ‘but at least let Mrs Zhu know what you’re
doing. Otherwise, when the doctor comes, what are you going to say if they start
asking ques?tions?’
Bao-yu knew that she was right and instructed one of the old nannies to go to Li Wan
with a message.
‘Tell Mrs Zhu that Skybright has got a bit of a chill. Say it’s nothing very serious, and
with Aroma away we shall be even more short-handed if she goes back home to get
better, so ?we’d like to get a doctor in quietly through the back gate to have a look at
her and not tell Her Ladyship about it.’
The old nannie was gone for quite a long time. When she did return it was with the
following answer.
‘Mrs Zhu says all right, as long as she’s better after one or two doses of medicine,
otherwise she thinks it would really be better to send her home. She says there’s so
much danger of infection at this time of year. She’s particularly worried that one of
the young ladies might catch something.’
All this time Skybright had been lying in the closet-bed inside, coughing. She stopped
coughing when she heard this message and called out angrily.
‘Anyone would think I’d got the plague I suppose I’d better go, if she’s so scared
that I might infect somebody. It would be just too terrible if any of you lot were to get
a head?ache or a sore throat as long as you live!’
She actually began getting up as she said this, but Bao-yu rushed in and made her lie
down again.
‘Now don’t start getting angry. She is, after ail, responsible for the girls and she’s
probably terrified that Lady Wang might get to know about this and grumble at her.
I’m sure that’s the only reason she says this: to cover herself in case it’s found out.
You’re inclined to be quick-tempered at the best of times. Now, with so much extra
heat inside you, you are even more inflammable!’
At this point the doctor was announced and Bao-yu barely had time to conceal
himself behind a bookcase as he entered the outer doorway, conducted by two or
three old women from the gate. The maids had all fled as soon as the arrival of a
male visitor was announced, leaving only three or four old nannies in charge of the
apartment. The old nannies quickly let down the closet-bed’s red embroidered
curtains and Sky?bright stretched forth her hand through a join in them.
This hand held out for the doctor’s inspection had nails two or three inches long on
two of its fingers, stained with balsam juice to a delicate shade of pink. The doctor
averted his eyes from this inflaming sight and would not proceed with the
examination until one of the old nannies had covered it up with a handkerchief.
When he had finished feeling the pulses, he got up, went into the outer room, and
announced his diagnosis to the nannies.
‘The young lady is suffering from inner congestion caused by exposure. In view of
the severe weather we have been having we should probably not be far wrong in
calling it a minor case of cold-fever or grippe. Fortunately your patient is a young lady
and therefore probably fairly modest in her diet; and the exposure does not appear
to have been a very serious one. What we have, then, is no more than a mild
infection picked up by someone whose stamina is normally rather low. One or two
doses of something to disperse the congestion should be sufficient to put her right.’
Having pronounced this diagnosis, he went off, conducted once more by the women
who had brought him in.
Li Wan had sent warning of the doctor’s arrival both to the servants on the gate and
the maids in the various apartments, so that his passage through the Garden, both
coming and going, was through an empty landscape in which not a single female was
to be seen. After passing through the Garden gate, he sat down in the outer lodge
which the pages occupied and wrote -out his prescription.
‘Don’t go yet, sir,’ said one of the old women when he had finished writing it. ‘Our
young master always likes to have his say about these matters. Like as not he’ll have
some question to ask you.’
The doctor looked startled.
‘Did you say “master”? But surely that was a young lady I examined just now? The
room was certainly a young lady’s boudoir, and the consultation was made with the
patient behind a curtain. Surely it cannot have been a young gentleman?’
The old woman laughed.
‘I see now why the boys said we had a “new doctor” coming in today. You certainly
don’t know much about this family, sir! That was our young master’s room you were
in lust now, but the person you examined was one of his maids one of the senior
ones. That was no young lady’s room. If one of the young mistresses had been ill, you
wouldn’t have got into her room that easy not on your first visit!’
She took the prescription from him and went back inside to show Bao-yu. Bao-yu
glanced through it rapidly. ‘Perilla’, ‘kikio root’, ‘wind-shield’ and ‘nepeta-seed’
appeared among the drugs at the head of the list, and lower down he noticed ‘thorny
lime’ and ‘ephedra’. He was appalled.
‘He’s prescribing for her as if she were a man. However bad the congestion is, you
can’t expect a young girl to stand up to drugs like thorny lime and ephedra. Who sent
for this man, anyway? You’d better get rid of him straight away and send for
someone we know.’
‘We weren’t to know what his prescriptions would be like,’ said the woman
defensively. ‘I suppose we could send one of the boys for Dr Wang. The only thing is,
as we didn’t tell the Office about this one, we shall have to pay him ourselves.’
‘How much ?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Well, you don’t want to give too little,’ said the old woman. ‘I should think for a
single visit a family like ours would give a tael.’
‘How much do we give Dr Wang for-a visit?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Ah, Dr Wang and Dr Zhang are our regular doctors. They aren’t paid by the visit.
They get a fixed yearly amount paid to them in quarterly installments. But this is a
new man who’s only ever been here the once, so we have to pay him now.’
Bao-yu ordered Musk to fetch a tael for him, but Musk said that she didn’t know
where Aroma kept her money.
‘I’ve seen her taking silver from the little pearl-inlaid cabinet,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll go
along with you and have a look.’
The two of them went into the room that Aroma used as her store-room and opened
the cabinet that Bao-yu had re?ferred to. In the top compartment they found nothing
but writing-brushes, ink-sticks, fans, incense-pastilles and a wide variety of scarves
and sachets. In the lower compartment, however, they found several strings of cash,
and there was a drawer in it in which they found a work-basket containing several
pieces of silver and even a little balance for weighing it with. Musk picked up the
balance.
‘Which of these is the one tad mark?’ she said.
‘That’s rich,’ said Bao-yu, ‘your asking me! Anyone would think you were new here.’
Musk laughed. She was about to go outside and ask, but Bao-yu stopped her.
‘Just pick out one of the larger pieces and give her that. There’s no need to bother
about the exact amount. We aren’t shopkeepers.’
Putting the balance back into the basket, Musk picked up one of the pieces of silver
and felt the weight of it on her palm.
‘I should think this one is about a tael,’ she said. ‘Anyway, it’s better to give too
much than too little. A poor creature like that, used to scrimping and scraping himself,
would say that it was meanness if we gave him too little. He’d never believe it was
because we didn’t know how to use-a balance.’
The woman who had brought the prescription was standing in the doorway,
following all this with amusement.
‘That piece you’ve got in your hand is half of a five-tael ingot,’ she said. ‘It must
weigh two taels at the very least. Since you haven’t got any silver-shears, I should
keep that piece if I were you and pick out a smaller one.’
But Musk had already closed the cabinet.
‘Oh, I can’t be bothered to look in there again. Just take it. Never mind the weight.’
‘And tell Tealeaf to go and get Dr Wang,’ said Bao-yu.
The old woman took the silver and went off to deal with the matter.
Tealeaf must have been quick, for Dr Wang arrived quite soon afterwards. The
diagnosis he gave after taking Skybright’s pulses was similar to the other man’s, but
there was no ephedra or thorny lime in his prescription: their place was taken by
milder drugs such as angelica, bitter-peel and white peony root; and the quantities
prescribed were smaller. Bao-yu was pleased.
‘That’s more like it!’ he said. ‘She certainly needs treating for congestion, but not in
the savage way this other man was proposing. I remember last year when I was
suffering from the same thing and Dr Wang came to look at me—in my case I was
badly constipated as well—he said that my constitution wouldn’t stand- up to harsh
decongestants like ephedra, gypsum and thorny lime. Well, if my constitution won’t
stand up to those drugs, I’m quite sure that yours or Skybright’s wouldn’t. In
comparison with you girls, I’m like one of those old aspens that have stood for half a
century or more in some grave-garth in the countryside, while you are like those
deli?cate crab-flowers that Yun brought round for me in the autumn.’
‘Aspens aren’t the only trees you find growing in grave?garths,’ said Musk, smiling.
‘What about pines and cypresses.? I hate aspens great, stupid trees I It’s not as if they
had more leaves than others, yet at the slightest breath of wind they start making a
racket. Why compare yourself to an aspen? How common!’
‘I wouldn’t compare myself with a pine or a cypress,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Confucius
himself speaks highly of those two trees:


“When the year is coldest, we see that pine and cypress are the last to fade.”
That shows you how noble they are. I should need to be a very conceited person to
compare myself with them.’

While he was still discussing this with Musk and Skybright, the old woman who had
shown him the prescription arrived back again with the drugs. Bao-yu told one of the
maids to find the silver medicine skillet and brew them on the brazier in his room.
‘Now do be sensible!’ said Skybright. Tell them to do it in the tea-kitchen. You’ll
stink the place out with the smell of boiling herbs if you do it in here.’
‘But the smell of boiling herbs is the finest smell in the world,’ said Bao-yu, ‘—far
superior to the perfume of any flower. Even the Immortals are supposed to gather
herbs and cook them; and gathering herbs to make medicine with is the favourite
occupation of hermits and holy men. The smell of medicine: that is the one aesthetic
treat that has so far been missing from this apartment; and now, today, we shall
enjoy it!’
And he insisted that they should prepare the medicine on the spot. Then he told
Musk to get some things ready to send to Aroma and commissioned one of the old
women to take them to her. She was to see how Aroma was and urge her not to
endanger her health by excessive weeping. When all these matters had been
attended to, he went off to pay his morning calls on Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia
and to have his lunch.
He found Xi-feng at Grandmother Jia’s place discussing mealtime arrangements with
his mother and grandmother.
‘Now that it’s so cold and the days are so short,’ she was saying, ‘wouldn’t it be
better if Li Wan and the young people were to have their meals in the Garden, to
avoid all this trek?king to and fro? They can begin coming in for them again when the
weather is warmer and the days are not so short.’
‘Oh, much better, surely?’ said-Lady Wang. ‘Especially when it’s snowing or blowing,
as it has been recently. It’s so bad for one to be exposed to the cold immediately
after eating. It’s also not good to eat food after being out in the cold with an empty
stomach. The empty parts fill up with cold air and then the food presses it down
inside one. That big five-frame room inside the back gate of the Garden would make
an ideal kitchen. We’ve already got all those women there who keep watch in the
Garden at night, so there are plenty of hands for fetching and carrying. All we need
are a couple of women from the kitchens here to go over and do the cooking. There
are regular allowances for vegetables and so forth, so they can either get the money
from Accounts and do their own shopping themselves, or, if they prefer, they can ask
the Office to get the stuff for them. And when we have anything special here, like
pheasant or roebuck, we can always arrange for a share of it to be sent over to them.’
‘I’d been thinking along these lines myself,’ said Grand?mother Jia, ‘but I was afraid
that opening another kitchen might mean extra trouble for you and Feng.’
‘ No trouble at all,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It’s simply a matter of switching
allowances—spending a bit more here and a bit more there. And even if it does put
our expenses up a bit, we don’t want the girls getting colds. Cousin Lin is particularly
sus?ceptible. Even Bao-yu is liable to suffer from the cold; and none of our girls is
really strong.’
How Grandmother Jia replied will be shown in the follow?ing chapter.

And brave Skybright repairs the hole in a
Peacock Gold snowcape



‘QUITE so,’ said Grandmother Jia in answer to Xi-feng’s advocacy of the separate
kitchen. ‘I would have mentioned it myself, but you have so many burdens already
and I didn’t want to add to them. I know, of course, that you wouldn’t have
complained, but you might easily have got the impression that I only care about the
younger ones and have no con?sideration for you busy people who are responsible
for run-ring the household. However, now that you have suggested it yourself, I am
naturally delighted.’
It chanced that besides Aunt Xue and Mrs Li, Lady Xing and You-shi were also present
on this occasion, having come over some time previously to make their morning calls
and not yet gone back again. Grandmother Jia availed herself of their presence to
sing Xi-feng’s praises.
‘I wouldn’t say this as a rule because I don’t want to make her conceited, and in any
case the younger ones might not agree with me: but tell me now—as older married
women you have all had a good deal to do with her - have you ever met anyone quite
as thoughtful as Feng?’
Aunt Xue, Mrs Li and You-shi agreed that people with Xi-feng’s virtues were indeed
extremely rare.
‘Other young married women put on a show of liking their husband’s relations for
form’s sake,’ they observed, ‘but she really does seem to care for the young people;
and she is plainly devoted to you.’
Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed.
‘I’m very fond of her, but I’m afraid she’s a bit too sharp. It doesn’t do to be too
sharp.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Now there you are quite wrong, Grannie. The saying is that sharp-witted people
don’t live long. Everyone says that and everyone believes it, but you should be the
last person to agree with them. Look how long-lived and lucky you are, and yet you
are ten times more sharp-witted than me. By rights I should live twice as long as you,
if there is any truth in the saying. I expect to live until I am at least a thousand. At all
events I shan’t die until I have seen you go to heaven!’
‘It will be a very dull sort of world when all the rest are dead and only we two old
harpies are left alive,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The others laughed.
Remembering Skybright, Bao-yu left before the others and hurried back to his
apartment to see how she was. The air in it reeked of medicine. Skybright, lying on
the kang, her face a dusky red now with the fever, appeared to be completely on her
own. He felt her forehead and found it burning to the touch. Quickly warming his
hands over the stove, he slipped one of them inside the bedclothes and felt her body.
That too was fiery hot.
‘I should have thought Musk and Ripple might have stayed with you, if no one else,’
he said disgustedly. ‘I call that pretty heartless, leaving you on your own like this.’
‘Ripple’s not here because I made her go and have her lunch,’ said Skybright ‘And
Musk has only just this moment been called outside by Patience. They’re whispering
together in the front about something or other probably about the fact that I didn’t
go home to get better.’
‘Patience isn’t that sort of person,’ said Bao-yu. ‘She wouldn’t have known that you
were ill in any case, so she wouldn’t have come specially about you. Probably she
came to talk to Musk about something else, but happening to find you ill, pretended
she had come about you out of politeness. It’s the sort of social fib that anyone might
tell under the circum?stances. Even if you were in trouble for not going home, it’s got
nothing to do with Patience; and as you have always been on good terms with her in
the past, there’s no earthly reason why she should want to make unpleasantness
between you now by interfering in something that doesn’t concern her.’
‘I expect you’re right,’ said Skybright. ‘But I don’t under-stand why she should want
to hide things from me.’
‘I’ll go and find out what they’re talking about,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I go out the back
door and round the side, I shall be able to listen to them from outside the window.’
Going round to the front as he had said, he inclined his ear to the window and
listened. He could hear Musk talking in a low voice to Patience inside:
‘How did you come to get it back again?’
‘It was when I was washing my hands in the Garden that day that I lost it,’ he heard
Patience reply. ‘Mrs Lian made me keep quiet about it at the time, but as soon as we
got back she sent word round to the nannies in the different apartments and told
them to investigate. To tell the truth, we rather suspected Miss Xing’s maid. We
thought being so poor and not used to seeing things like that lying around she might
have been tempted. We never dreamed that it would turn out to be one of your
people.
‘It was Trinket who stole it. She was seen by your Mamma Song. Fortunately, when
Mamma Song came round with the bracelet to tell Mrs Lian, Mrs Lian was out, so I
quickly took it from her and told her to keep quiet about it.
‘I couldn’t help thinking how considerate is to you girls and how proud of you all he
is. It’s only two years since that girl Honesty stole the jade and there are some I could
mention who are still gloating about it, and now here’s this girl stealing gold—not
from him this time but from one of his neighbours, which is worse. I could just
imagine the gloating there would be if that got around. It seemed so unjust that he,
of all people, should be let down by his own girls in this way.
‘Anyway, I told Mamma Song that she was under no cir?cumstances to let Bao-yu
know about this. “In fact,” I said, “you’d better not tell anyone. Just behave as if
nothing had happened.” Of course, it wasn’t only Bao-yu I was thinking about. I knew
that Their Ladyships would be very angry if the got to hear of it and then it would be
very unpleasant for Aroma and the rest of you.
‘The story I told Mrs Lian when she got back was that I’d been to see Mrs Zhu and
picked the bracelet up on the way. I told her it must have slipped off into the grass
that day while I was washing and got buried under the snow, which explains why
nobody could find it. When the snow melted, there it was, shining in the sun for all to
see. I think she believed me.
‘The reason I’m telling you this is so that you should be on your guard about that
girl. Keep an eye on her and don’t send her on any errands. When Aroma gets back,
have a word with her about it and see if you can’t cook up some excuse for
dis?missing her.’
‘Little wretch!’ said Musk. ‘It isn’t as if she hasn’t seen things like that before. How
could she be so stupid?’
‘It wasn’t a particularly valuable bracelet,’ said Patience. ‘It’s one that Mrs Lian gave
me. It’s what they call a “shrimp whisker” bracelet. I think the pearl on it might be
quite valuable. That Skybright of yours is such a fire-brand that if I told her this, I’m
sure she’d never be able to keep quiet about it. She’d blow up immediately and start
hitting the girl or shouting at her, and then the whole thing would be out, in spite of
all I had done to keep it dark. That’s why I’m telling you. I thought someone ought to
be warned, so that you can keep an eye on her.’
With these words Patience took her leave.
Bao-yu had listened to what she said with conflicting emotions: pleasure at
discovering that Patience understood him so well; anger that Trinket should be a
thief; regret that so intelligent a person should be capable of so ugly an action. Going
back to Skybright, he relayed to her everything he had just heard except what
Patience had said about Skybright herself, which he emended somewhat for her
benefit.
‘She said you’re such a worrier that if you were to hear this now, while you are ill, it
would make you worse. She’s planning to tell you about it when you are better.’
Skybright’s reaction was as fiery as Patience had foreseen it would be. Her eyebrows
flew up and her eyes became round with anger. She wanted to summon Trinket
immediately.
‘Isn’t it rather a poor return for Patience’s considerateness immediately to start
making an outcry about it?’ said Bao-yu, restraining her. ‘Why not accept what she
has done in the spirit in which it was intended and get rid of Trinket later on?’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Skybright, ‘but I feel so angry. If I don’t get it off my chest
now, I shall burst,’
‘What have you got to be angry about?’ said Bao-yu, amused. ‘You just concentrate
on getting better.’
Skybright had already had one dose of her medicine. To?wards evening she was given
the second infusion. But although she perspired a bit during the night, it didn’t really
seem to do much good. She still had a temperature, her head still ached, her nose
was still blocked, and she was still just as hoarse. In the morning Dr Wang came again,
and after taking her pulses, made a few alterations in the prescription; but although
the revised dosage brought down her temperature a little, her head still ached as
before.
‘Fetch the snuff,’ Bao-yu commanded. ‘If sniffing it can make her give a few good
sneezes, it will clear her head.’
Musk went off to do his bidding and presently returned with a little oval box made of
aventurine, edged and embel?lished with gold. Bao-yu took it from her and opened it.
Inside the lid, in West Ocean enamel, was a picture of a naked, yellow-haired girl with
wings of flesh. The box contained snuff of the very highest quality, which foreigners
call uncia,
‘Sniff some,’ he told Skybright, who had taken the box and was gazing fascinatedly
at the picture inside it. ‘If you leave it open too long, it will lose its fragrance and then
it won’t be so good.’
Skybright took a little of the snuff with her fingernail and sniffed it up her nose;
Nothing happened, so she scooped up a really large amount and sniffed again. A
tingling sensation passed through the root of her nose, right up inside her cranium
and she began to sneeze: four, five, six times in suc?cession. Immediately her eyes
and nose began to stream. She shut the box hurriedly with a laugh.
‘Goodness, how it burns! Give me some paper.’
At once one of the younger maids handed her a wad of tissue. Skybright used sheet
after sheet of it to blow her nose on.
 ‘How’s that?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Much clearer,’ she said. ‘But I still have this headache in the front of my head.’
‘Now that we’ve started using foreign medicine, we may as well go the whole bog,’
said Bao-yu. ‘I expect we’ll have you better again in no time. Musk, go to Mrs Lian’s
and tell her I said please could she let me have some of that Western stuff she uses
to make her headache plasters with. It’s called yi-fu-na’
Musk went off, returning after a goodish while with half a tablet. She hunted out a
scrap of red satin and cut out two little circles each about the size of a fingertips from
it; then, having melted the yi-fu-na to an ointment-like consistency over the stove,
she spread a little of it on each of them with a hair?pin. Skybright stuck them on
herself, one over each temple, with the aid of a hand-mirror. Musk laughed.
‘You already looked like a banshee to start with, with your ill face and your hair all
over the place. Now, with those two things on you, you really do look a sight! Funny:
one hardly notices them on Mrs Lian. I suppose it’s because she wears them so often.
—By the way;’ she said, turning to Bao-yu, ‘Mrs Lian asked me to tell you that
tomorrow is your Uncle Wang’s birthday and Her Ladyship wants you to go. Tell me
what clothes you’ll be wearing tomorrow so that I can get them ready now and not
have to rush around in the morning.’
‘Oh, anything,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Whatever comes first to hand. Birthdays! It’s nothing
but birthdays from one year’s end to the next.’
He got up and left the room, intending to go to Xi-chun’s place to see how she was
getting on with the ‘painting; but as he came out of the courtyard gate, he saw
Bao-qin little maid Periwinkle hurrying across the pathway ahead of him and hurried
forward to catch up with her.
‘Where are you going?’ he asked.
‘To Miss Lin’s,’ said Periwinkle. ‘Miss Xue and Miss Bao-?qin are there already and
I’m on my way to join them.’
Bao-yu changed his mind about going to see Xi-chun and accompanied Periwinkle to
the Naiad’s House. He found not only Bao-chai and Bao-qin there but Xing Xiu-yan as
well. Dai-yu and her three visitors were sitting on the clothes-warmer gossiping,
while Nightingale sat in the closet-bed alcove by the window, sewing. The girls
laughed when they saw him enter.
‘Another one? There’s nowhere for you to sit.’
‘What a charming picture!’ said Bao-yu. “‘A Bevy of Beauties Keeping Warm in
Winter.” I should have come earlier. Still, your room is so warm, I shall be perfectly all
right on this chair.’
He sat on the chair that Dai-yu normally occupied. On this occasion it was covered
with a squirrel-skin rug. A marble jardinière in the closet-bed alcove where
Nightingale was sit ring caught his eye. It was full of single-petalled ‘water nymph’
narcissi growing in clumps of four or five flowers from each bulb.
‘What beautiful flowers!’ he said. ‘The warmth of the room makes their scent even
richer. How is it I didn’t notice them yesterday?’
‘They were given to Qin by your Chief Steward Lai Da’s wife,’ said Dai-yu: ‘two pots
of narcissi and two of winter-sweet. Qin gave these ones to me and one of the two
pots of winter-sweet to Cousin Yun. I didn’t really want them, but as she was kind
enough to offer them to me, I thought it would be churlish not to accept. If you’d like
them, I’d be very happy to pass them on to you.’
‘Thank you,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I’ve got two pots of them already. Though mind you,
they are not as good as these. In any case, if Cousin Qin gave them to you, you can’t
possibly go handing them over to somebody else.’
‘There’s hardly a minute of the day when I haven’t got a medicine-skillet on the
stove,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I seem practically to live on medicine nowadays. The smell of
medicine is bad enough as it is, but this heavy flower-scent on top of it makes me feel
quite faint. Besides, the smell of medicine spoils the smell of the flowers, which is a
pity. Much better carry them off somewhere where they can regain their purity away
from competing odours.’
‘I’ve got a sick person in my room today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘My room is full of
medicine-smells too. How did you know?’
‘What an extraordinary question!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I know nothing about it. How
should I know what goes on in your room? I don’t think you’ve teen attending to a
word I’ve been saying. You’re like someone who comes k half-way through a story
and disturbs the rest of the audience by asking questions.’
‘At least we shan’t want for a theme at our next poetry meeting,’ said Bao-yu.
“‘Narcissus “and “winter-sweet” will make splendid subjects.’
‘Oh no!’ wailed Dai-yu, burying her face in her hands. ‘What’s the point of having
poetry meetings? Another meet?ing only means another lot of penalties. It’s so
shaming.’
‘I suppose that’s meant for me,’ said Bao-yu, ‘since I’m the one who’s always
getting penalized. But if it doesn’t bother me, I don’t see what you have got to go
burying your face in your hands about.’
‘I shall call the next meeting,’ said Bao-chai brightly. ‘There will be four themes for
poems in Regular Verse and four for poems in other metres and everyone will have
to do all eight of them. The first will be a three-hundred-line poem in pentasyllabics
exhausting the rhyme “first”. It’s subject will be “On the Diagram of the Supreme
Ultimate”?
Bao-qin laughed.
One can see that it isn’t really poetry you’re interested in but in making things
difficult for others. It could be done, of course, if one really wanted to do it—it would
simply be a question of selecting bits from the Book of Changes and tortur?ing them
into some sort of verse—but what would be the point?
‘When I was eight I went with my father on one of his trips to buy foreign
merchandise to one of the Western sea-ports and while we were there we saw a girl
from the country of Ebenash. She was just like the foreign girls you see in paint?ings:
long, yellow hair done into plaits, and her head was smothered in jewels: carnelians,
cat’s-eyes and emeralds. She was wearing a corslet of golden chain-mall and a dress
of West Ocean brocade and she had a Japanese sword at her side covered all over
with jewels and gold. Actually she was more beautiful than the foreign girls you see
in paintings. They said that she had a perfect understanding of our literature and
could expound the Five Classics and write poems in Chinese. My father asked her
through an interpreter if she would write something for us in Chinese characters and
she wrote out one of her own poems for him.’
The cousins were enthralled and Bao-yu eagerly begged her to show them the poem.
‘That’s not possible,’ said Bao-qin. ‘I left it behind in Nanking.’
Bao-yu was very disappointed.
‘Just my luck!’ he said. ‘And I was hoping to broaden my experience.’
‘Don’t be a tease!’ said Dai-yu, giving Bao-qin a tug. ‘You didn’t leave anything
behind in Nanking. Look at all the lug?gage you brought with you! I think you’re
making it up. The others can believe you if they like, but I don’t.’
Bao-qin blushed and hung her head. She made no reply, but a little, secret smile was
faintly discernible in her features.
‘How like you to say that, Frowner!’ said Bao-chai. ‘You really are too sharp.’
‘Well, if she’s brought it with her, she ought to let us have a look and satisfy our
curiosity,’ said Dai-yu.
‘She’s got such a great pile of stuff,’ said Bao-chai, ‘she simply hasn’t had time to go
through it all yet. How does she know which of all those trunks and boxes she put it
in? Wait until she’s had time to sort her things out: no doubt she will come across the
poem and let you see it then.’ She turned to Bao-qin. ‘Or perhaps you can remember
it? If so, why don’t you recite it for us now?’
‘It was in Regular Pentameter,’ said Bao-qin. ‘I can re?member that. For a foreigner
it was really quite a good poem.’
‘Hold on.!’ said Bao-chai. ‘If you are going to recite it, let me first send for Yun, so
that she can hear it as well.’
She gave instructions to Periwinkle.
‘Go back to my room and tell Miss Shi that we’ve got a beautiful foreigner here
who can write poems in Chinese. Tell her that as she’s so crazy about poetry, we
thought she’d like to meet her. And tell her to bring that other poetry maniac with
her when she comes.’
Periwinkle went off laughing to deliver the message. Presently Xiang-yan’s voice,
loudly inquiring ‘Where’s this beautiful foreigner?’ could be heard outside, and a
moment later she and Caltrop walked into the room.
                 ‘Ere yet the shape was seen, the voice was heard’
said the others, laughing. When xiang-yun and Caltrop were seated, Bao-qin
repeated for their benefit what. she had just been telling the others. xiang-yun
pressed her to recite the poem, and this she now proceeded to do:

The Land of Ebenash
         Last night I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls;
         Tonight beside the watery waste I sing.
         The island’s cloud-cap drifts above the sea,
         And mists about its mountain forests cling.
         Our pasts and presents to the moon are one;
         Our lives and loves beyond our reckoning.
         Yet still my heart yearns for that distant South,
         Where time is lost in one eternal spring.


‘Fancy a foreigner being able to write that!’ said the cousins admiringly. ‘It’s better
than we Chinese could do ourselves.’
While they were still enthusing over the poem, Musk arrived to report that someone
had just been round with a message for Master Bao from Lady Wang.
‘Her Ladyship says, when you go to your Uncle Wang’s first thing tomorrow, will
you tell them that she’s sorry she can’t go herself, but she’s not feeling very well?’
Bao-yu stood up, out of respect for his mother, to reply. He asked Bao-chai and
Bao-qin lf they would be going too. No, said Bao-chai, they had sent a present
yesterday, and that was all they would be doing.
Conversation continued a little longer and then the com?pany broke up. As Bao-yu
politely insisted on the others going out before him, he would have been the last to
leave, but just as he was about to do so, Dai-yu called him back.
Tell me,’ she said, just how long will Aroma be away?’
‘I don’t know;’ said Bao-yu, ‘but she certainly won’t come back until after the
funeral?
Dai-yu evidently had something on her mind that she wanted to say but was finding
difficulty in expressing. whatever it was, she must have abandoned it, for, after
reflecting for a few moments ins in silence, all she said was:
You’d better go.’
Bao-yu, too, had a feeling that there were a lot of things he ought to be asking her,
but he could not for the moment recollect what any of them were. After trying
unsuccessfully to remember, he left her with a cheerful ‘See you tomorrow’ and
went down the steps outside, his head bent low as he con?tinued ruminating. Just as
he was about to set out across the forecourt, something occurred to him and he
remounted the steps and went in again.
‘The nights are getting so much longer now. How many times do you cough in the
night? Do you wake up very often?’
‘I’m much better at night than I was,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Last night I only coughed twice.
But I still don’t sleep very well. Last night I only slept between about two and four in
the morning. After that I couldn’t get hack to sleep again.’
‘Ah, I knew there was something important I wanted to ask you about,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I’ve just remembered what it was.’ He drew closer to her ear and went on in a lower
voice. ‘You know that bird’s nest that Cousin Bao sent you,—’
But before he could finish, Aunt Zhao called in to inquire lf Dai-yu was feeling better.
Dai-yu knew that she had dropped in on her way back from seeing Tan-chun, and
that the kind?ness, if kindness it were, was of a-somewhat tangential nature;
nevertheless she begged her with eager politeness to be seated and thanked her
warmly for the visit.
‘How kind of you to think of me, Mrs Zhao and to come here yourself in such bitter
weather!’
She ordered tea to be poured for her visitor) simultaneously darting a look at Bao-yu
which he rightly interpreted as an order to make himself scarce. It was in any case
time for his dinner, so he went to his mother’s place to have it. She made him go
back early, bearing in mind that he must be up betimes next morning.
When he got back to his own room, Bao-yu found that Skybright had already taken
her medicine. He judged it best to let her stay where she was in the closet-bed. He
himself slept on the space outside the curtain which Musk had occu?pied the
previous night. This time Musk slept on the clothes-warmer. He had it moved up
beside the closet-bed before they went to bed, so that she could be near at hand
during the night.
The night passed by without event.

*

Next day, before it was yet light, Skybright was calling on Musk to wake up.
‘Come on, Musk! You ought to be awake by now, Haven’t you slept enough yet?
You go outside and tell the others to get his morning drink ready while I try waking
him up.’
Musk hurriedly drew on a garment and got out of bed.
‘We’d better-both wake him and wait till he’s dressed and the clothes-warmer has
been carried back to its usual place before we let the others it’,’ she said. ‘The old
women have already said that he’s not to sleep in the same room as you in case he
catches your sickness. We shall never hear the end of it, if they find out that we’ve
been sleeping all crowded up together like this.’
‘Yes,’ said Skybright. ‘I was thinking that too.’
The two girls began calling Bao-yu. He must in fact have been awake already, for he
got out of bed and began dressing immediately. Musk called in one of the junior
maids to help her move the warmer back into place and fold up the bedding. Only
when all traces of the previous night’s sleeping arrange?ments had been effaced
were Ripple and Emerald called in to assist Bao-yu with his toilet.
  ‘It’s very overcast again,’ said Musk, when Bao-yu’s toilet had been completed. ‘It
looks as lf it will snow. You’d better put on your felt.’
Bao-yu nodded and changed the outer garment he had put on for a more substantial
one. A junior maid came in carrying a little tea-tray on which was a covered cup
containing a con?coction of red dates and Fukien lotus-seeds. Bao-yu drank a few
mouthfuls, took a piece of ginger from a saucerful of crystallized shapes held out to
him by Musk and put it in his mouth to nibble, addressed a few brief admonitions to
Sky?bright to look after herself while he was away, and went off to see his
grandmother.
She had not yet risen when he arrived at her apartment, but the servants, knowing
that he was going visiting and could not wait for her to get up, admitted him at once
to her bed?room. He caught a glimpse of Bao-qin lying asleep behind her, her face
turned inwards to the wall. The old lady observed that her grandson was wearing,
over his formal dress of lychee-brown broadcloth, a dark-red felt cape embellished
with roundels of gold thread and coloured silk embroidery. Its slate-blue satin border
was fringed with tassels.
‘Is it snowing?’ she asked him.
‘Not yet,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but it looks as if it will.’
Grandmother Jia turned to Faithful:
‘Give him that peacock-feather cloak we were looking at yesterday.’
Faithful murmured a reply and went out of the room, re?turning presently with a
magnificent snow-cape that gleamed and glittered with gold and green and
bronzy-bluish lights. It was like Bao-qin’s mallard-cape and yet somehow different.
‘This is what they call “peacock gold”,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It is made by the
Russians. They twist the barbs of peacock-feathers into a kind of yarn and weave it
from that. The other day I gave your cousin Bao-qin a cape like this made out of
mallard feathers. Now I am giving this one to you.’
Bao-yu kotowed and put it on. Grandmother Jia smiled.
‘Go and show your mother’
Bao-yu obediently hurried off to do so. On his way out he came upon Faithful,
standing beside the kang in the outer room. She affected to be rubbing her eyes in
order not to have to look at him. She had avoided speaking to him ever since the
frightful scene nearly two months earlier when she had vowed never to marry, and
Bao-yu was continually being made uncomfortable by her avoidance of him. Seeing
her once more preparing to ignore him, he went up to her with a friendly smile in the
hope of breaking her silence.
‘Faithful, see this! How do you think I look in it?’
But Faithful simply turned and fled, retreating into Grand?mother Jia’s bedroom.
Obliged to give up, he continued on his way to Lady Wang’s. After his mother had
seen the cape, he went into the Garden to show himself off to Musk and Sky?bright.
After that he returned to his grandmother’s to report.
‘I showed it to Mother. She said it seems almost a pity to wear it and I must be very,
very careful not to spoil it.’
‘That was the only one I had left,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘If you do spoil it I haven’t
got another one to give you. And there would be no question of getting another one
made for you - not in these parts.’
She put on her admonitions-for-the-departing-grandchild voice:
‘Now don’t drink too much. And leave early.’
‘Yes, Grandma.’
Old women from his grandmother’s apartment accom?panied him as far as the
reception hall of the outer mansion. Below the steps outside it his foster brother Li
Gui, together with Wang Rong, Zhang Ruo-jin, Zhao Yi-hua, Qian Sheng and Zhou Rui
and the pages Tealeaf, Storky, Ploughboy and Sweeper, had been waiting a long time
in readiness. The pages were carrying clothing-bundles and blankets, and two of the
older men were holding a splendidly caparisoned horse by the bridle. The old women
issued a few words of admonition to the men, the men, after acknowledging them
with a few per?functory cries, handed Bao-yu his whip and held the stirrup for him to
mount, and Bao-yu, mindful of the precious cape, got up slowly into the saddle. The
little party then began to advance, Li Gui and Wang Rong, one on either side, holding
the bridle-rings, Qian Sheng and Zhou Rul walking ahead, and Zhang Ruo-jin and
Zhao Yi-hua following closely behind.
‘Zhou, Qian,’ Bao-yu called out from the saddle to the two in front, ‘let’s go out of
the side gate, otherwise it will mean going past my father’s door and I shall have to
get down.’
‘Since Sir Zheng went away, his door’s kept locked all the time,’ said Zhou Rui,
turning a grinning face back to his young master. ‘You don’t need to get down.’
‘Even though it is locked, I still ought to get down,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Quite right, sir,’ said Li Gui and Qian Sheng approvingly. ‘If you was to get slack
about dismounting and Mr Lai or Mr .Lin was to see you, they’d be sure to have
something to say about it. Even though they couldn’t very well tell yon off, like
enough they’d blame us for not teaching you manners.’
By now Zhou Rui and Qian Sheng were moving towards the side entrance. While the
point of etiquette was still being discussed, they ran head on into Lai Da himself, of
whom they had just been speaking. Bao-yu at once reined to a halt and made as if to
dismount, but, Lai Da hurried up and prevented him by clinging to his leg. Bao-yu
thereupon stood up in the stirrups and, taking him by the hand, addressed him
graciously for some moments before continuing on his way. He had barely done so
when thirty or forty pages armed with dustpans and brushes came trooping into the
courtyard. Immediately they caught sight of Bao-yu, they lined up in a row along the
wall and stood with their arms at their sides while one of their number, evidently the
leader, stepped forward and, dropping to one knee in the Manchu salute, wished
Bao-yu a good morning. Bao-yu did not know the page’s name, so he merely smiled
and nodded. The whole troop remained motionless until the horse and its rider had
passed by.
Bao-yu’s little party now issued out of the side gate, where ten horses were ready
waiting for them: one for Li Gui and each of his fellows and one for each of the pages.
All sprang at once into the saddle and were off down the street like a puff of smoke.
At this point our story leaves them and turns to other matters.

*

Back at Green Delights Skybright, exasperated to find, after another dose of her
medicine, that the sickness still showed no disposition to depart, was holding forth
loudly against the whole generation of doctors.
They’re all cheats,’ she said. ‘They take your money, but none of the medicine they
give you is any good.’
‘Don’t be so impatient,’ said Musk soothingly. ‘Getting better is always a lengthy
business. You know what they say “Sickness comes like an avalanche but goes like
reeling silk”. This stuff isn’t the Elixir of Life. You can’t expect it to cure you in a
twinkling. You’ll be all right if you take things easy for a few days. Getting yourself
worked up will only give the sickness a tighter grip on you.’
Skybright’s anger changed direction and vented itself now upon the junior maids.
‘Where have you lot all sneaked off to?’ she called out to them. ‘Very bold, aren’t
you, now that you seem helpless? Just you wait till I’m better: I’ll have the hide off
every one of you.’
Her outcry produced a solitary response. A little girl called Steadfast came hurrying in
and inquired, ‘What is it, Miss?’
‘What’s happened to the others?’ said Skybright. ‘Are they all dead? Are you the
only one left alive?’
While she was speaking, Trinket, too, came in—at a some?what more ambling pace
than the other girl.
‘Look at this little creature, now!’ said Skybright. ‘Why couldn’t she have come
sooner? You’d have come running here fast enough if we’d been handing out
monthly allowances or sharing out sweets, wouldn’t you? Then you’d have been the
first to arrive. Come closer. I’m not a tiger. I won’t eat you.’
Trinket edged a few steps nearer. As she did so, Skybright suddenly raised herself
from her lying position, snatched hold of her hand, and began jabbing at it violently
with an enor?mous hairpin which she had been keeping concealed under her pillow.
‘What do you want this little claw for?’ she said. ‘It’s no good with a needle and
thread. All it’s good for is picking and stealing. Shifty eyes and light fingers! A little
claw like this can only bring you disgrace. Much better stab it!—and slab it!—and
stab it! so that it can’t do any more thieving.’
Trinket was by now screaming with pain. Musk quickly dragged her away out of
Skybright’s clutches and forced Skybright to lie down again in bed.
‘You’ve only just been sweating after the medicine,’ she said. ‘What’s the matter
with you? Do you want to die? If you’ll just wait until you’re better, you can punish
her as much as you like. Don’t start making a scene about it now!’
But Skybright insisted on calling in Mamma Song and deal?ing with the matter at
once.
‘Master Bao has told me to tell you that he finds Trinket lazy,’ she said when
Mamma Song arrived. ‘She answers him back and doesn’t do anything when he gives
her orders, and even when Aroma tells her to do things she says rude things about
her behind her back. Master Bao is most anxious that she should be dismissed
immediately. He says he will speak to Her Ladyship about it himself when he sees her
tomorrow.’
When Mamma Song heard this, she knew that the story of the bracelet must have
leaked out.
‘That’s as may be,’ she said. ‘But oughtn’t we to wait until Miss Aroma comes back
and tell her first?’
‘What I am giving you are Master Bao’s own orders,’ said Skybright. ‘He was most
particular that she Should be dis?missed immediately. I don’t see that Miss
Aroma—or Miss Sweetscents or Miss Smellypots for that matter—has got any?thing
to do with it. I know what I’m doing. Just do as I say. Go and get someone from her
family to come here immediately and take her away.’
‘You might just as well,’ said Musk. ‘She’ll have to go sooner or later. Let them take
her away now and get it over with.’
So Mamma Song had to go off and summon the girl’s mother from outside. When
Trinket had finished getting her belongings together, her mother went in with her to
see Musk and Skybright.
‘Now what’s all this about?’ she said. ‘If the girl’s done wrong, why can’t you just
punish her for it? Why do you have to dismiss her? It doesn’t leave us much face,
does it, if she’s dismissed ?’
‘You’ll have to ask Bao-yu about that when he gets back,’ said Skybright. ‘It’s
nothing to do with us.’ The woman sneered.
‘You know perfectly well that I wouldn’t dare. He always does what you young
ladies want him to in any case. Even if I saw him and he agreed that she could stay,
there’s no guaranteeing that she would if you young ladies weren’t agreeable. Take
what you said just now. I know he’s not here at the moment, but even so. if I was to
name his name as you did just now without a “master” or a “mister” to it, people
would say I was a savage, but for you young ladies, seemingly, it’s quite all right.’
Skybright became red with anger.
‘I called him by his name, did I? Why don’t you go and report me to Their Ladyships?
Tell them that I’m a savage and get me dismissed.’
‘I advise you to take that girl out of here and be on your way,’ said Musk. ‘If you
have anything to say, you can say it later. You can’t stand here wrangling about it now.
When have you ever seen other people bandying words with us? Even Mrs Lai and
Mrs Lin show a bit of restraint when they talk to us. And as for this business of saying
“Bao-yu” instead of “Master Bao”: everyone knows that it’s Her Old Ladyship’s
particular wish that we should. Because he’s not strong and she’s afraid he might die
young, she likes as many people as possible to use his name, to bring him luck. She
even has it written in big characters and pasted up on walls outside to get people
saying it. It would be funny if we couldn’t use his name when every water-carrier and
dung-carrier and beggar in town can do so. As a matter of fact only yesterday Mrs Lin
got told off by Her Old Ladyship for calling him “Master Bao”.
‘And for another thing, we senior maids are constantly having -to take messages to
Her Old Ladyship and Her Lady-ship about him, and when we do, we always say
“Bao-yu”, never “Master Bao”. Why, I should think we must each of us use his name a
couple of hundred times every day. You cer?tainly chose the wrong thing to find fault
with when you picked on that one! If you don’t believe me, go round one of these
days when you are free to Her Old Ladyship’s or Her Ladyship’s and you will hear us
openly calling him “Bao-yu” to their faces. But of course, you don’t have any
important business that would bring you in contact with Their Lady-ships, do you? All
your time is spent doing odd-jobs outside. One could hardly expect you to know the
way things are done in here.
‘But I’m afraid we really can’t have you standing around here any longer. If you stay
much longer, I’m afraid even though we don’t object someone else may come along
and ask what you are doing here. If you want to appeal against the girl’s dismissal,
you should get her out of here first and take it up with Mrs Lin afterwards and she
will speak to Master Bao about it. With all the hundreds of people there are in this
household we can’t have just anyone running in and out when?ever they feel like it.
We don’t even know the names of half of them.’
By way of emphasizing her point, Musk ordered one of the junior maids to fetch a
floor-cloth and begin wiping the floor. At this Trinket’s mother, unable to find a reply
and fearful of being caught staying too long, swept out angrily, taking her daughter
with her. But Mamma Song was not letting them get away so easily.
‘You certainly don’t have much idea of manners, my good woman. After all the time
she’s been here, your daughter could at least make the young ladies a kotow before
she goes. She may have no other parting gift to give them—I don’t suppose they’d
set much store by it if she had— but she might at least have the decency to make -
them a kotow. You can’t both just up and go.’
Trinket was obliged to come in again and kotow to the two inside. She also went
round to do the same for Ripple and Emerald, but they refused to look at her. After
that she de?parted with her mother, the latter indicating as they went, by many a
sniff and sigh, the hatred that she dared net express more openly.
A consequence of this latest exposure to the cold and of the accompanying
emotional upset was that Skybright was now feeling bad again. At lighting-up time,
after tossing about feverishly all day, she was just beginning to settle down at last
when Bao-yu returned in a great fret and began stamping and groaning almost as
soon as -he entered the room. Musk asked him what the matter was.
‘It’s this cloak that Grandmother gave me this morning. She was so pleased about it,
and now—I don’t know how it happened—I’ve gone and got a burn in it behind the
lapel. Fortunately it was fairly dark just now when I came back and neither
Grandmother nor Mother noticed anything.’
He took it off for Musk-to examine. It was only a little burn, about the size of a
finger-print, but clearly visible.
‘It must have been caused by a- spark from your hand-warmer,’ said Musk. ‘It’s
nothing to worry about. We’ll send someone out on the quiet with it immediately to
find a good invisible mender and get it mended for you.’
She wrapped it up and called in one of the old nannies to take it out for them.
‘Tell them it has to be ready by daylight tomorrow. And for heaven’s sake don’t let
Her Old Ladyship or Her Ladyship find out about it!’
The woman was gone a very long time. When she at last returned, she was still
carrying the bundle with the peacock cloak in it.
‘ I’ve tried everywhere—invisible menders, tailors, em?broiderers,
seamstresses—and none of them will touch it. They all say they don’t know what the
material is and don’t want to be responsible.’
‘Oh dear!’ said Musk. ‘What are we going to do now? Well, you lust can’t wear it
tomorrow, that’s all.’
‘But I must,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tomorrow is his actual birthday. Grandmother and
Mother have both said I must. Today was only the first day of the celebrations, not
his actual birthday. Isn’t it just my luck to burn it the very first time I put it on?’
Skybright, who had listened to all this in silence, could con?tain herself no longer and
sat up immediately in bed.
‘Come on, let me have a look. If you weren’t meant to wear it, you won’t wear it.
No good making all this fuss about it now.’
‘There’s something in that,’ said Bao-yu laughing, and handed it to her. He brought
the lamp over so that she could examine it more closely.
‘This is made of “peacock gold”,’ said Skybright. ‘If we could get hold of some of the
thread .and make a little darn with it’ I think it would probably pass.’
‘We’ve got peacock gold thread,’ said Musk. ‘The trouble is that apart from you
there’s no one else here who could do the darning.’
‘I shall just have to make the effort and do it then, shan’t I?’ said Skybright.
‘No, that’s out of the question,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You’ve only just started getting better.
You’re not in a fit state to do sewing yet.’
‘Oh, don’t be such an old woman!’ said Skybright. ‘I know what I’m capable of.’
So saying, she sat up again in bed, knotted up her loosely flowing hair, and drew a
jacket on over her shoulders. Her body felt abnormally light and she was almost
overcome with dizziness. It really did seem as if the effort would be too much for her;
but knowing what a state Bao-yu would be in if the snow-cape was not repaired, she
gritted her teeth, and fighting back the weakness that threatened to engulf her, told
Musk to pinch the yarn and thread a needle for her while she herself took a length of
it and held it against the material.
‘It’s not really a very good match,’ she said, ‘but I don’t suppose it will show very
much when it’s been darned.’
‘I’m sure it will do very nicely,’ said Bao-yu. ‘At all events, we’re not going to be able
to find a Russian tailor to do it for us!’
Skybright began by opening up the seam of the lining underneath the burnt patch so
that she could insert a cup-sized darning mushroom from inside. Having stretched
the material out over the mushroom, she scraped away the charred parts and the
surrounding nap with a razor until the threads were clearly exposed, then, with her
needle and thread, she worked first across in one direction and then at right-angles in
the other until she had filled the hole with a criss-cross darn. Using this as a
foundation, she now began to weave the thread in and out with her needle so as to
Imitate the surrounding pattern. This was the most difficult and exhausting part of
the work. After each couple of stitches she had to stop and examine what she had
done, and after every four or five she had to lean back on the pillow and rest.
Meanwhile Bao-yu fussed around her unceasingly, one moment asking her if she
would like a ‘nice hot drink’, another moment suggesting that she should rest, one
moment fetching a squirrel-skin cloak to put over her shoulders, the next moment a
pillow for her back, until she became quite frantic and had to entreat him to leave
her alone
‘My dear little grandfather—please just go to bed! If you stay up any longer, you’ll
have rings under your eyes in the morning, and that will never dot’
Bao-yu could see that he was exasperating her and made a pretence of settling down
in his bed; but he could not get to sleep. After he had been lying awake for some
time, he heard the chiming clock strike four. Skybright had just completed the
mending and was finishing off the job by carefully teasing the nap out with a little
toothbrush.
‘That’s wonderful,’ said Musk. ‘If you didn’t look at it carefully, you could never tell
it was a darn.’
Bao-yu asked to see.
‘It’s perfect,’ he said. ‘It looks exactly the same as the rest.’
Skybright had been coughing a good deal during the final stages of her task and it
had been all she could do to conclude
it.
‘Anyway, it’s done,’ she said. ‘It doesn’t really look right, but I can’t do any
more—Aiyo!’
With a cry of weariness she sank back, utterly exhausted, upon the bed.
If you wish to know the outcome, please read the chapter which follows.

CHAPTER 53

Ning-guo House sacrifices to the ancestors on New Year’s Eve
And Rong-guo House entertains the whole family on
Fifteenth Night



SEEING that Skybright’s repair of the peacock gold snow cape had so utterly
exhausted her, Bao-yu called in a junior maid to help massage her and for a while
they pummelled her between them. After that they all went to bed; but in less than
no time it seemed to be broad daylight and they had to get up again. Instead of going
straight off to his uncle’s, however, Bao-yu first sent someone to summon Dr Wang.
‘The doctor arrived promptly and proceeded to take Skybright’s pulses. He appeared
to be disconcerted by what he found.
‘Yesterday she seemed to be a little better,’ he said, ‘but this pulse today takes us
right back to where we started from—empty, superficial, faint, constricted. Now why
should that be? She must have been eating or drinking too much. Either that, or she
has been worrying about something. The original attack was not a serious one; but
failure to take care of oneself after perspiration has been induced can be very
serious.’
He went outside and wrote another prescription, which was presently brought in to
Bao-yu. Bao-yu noticed that the sudorifics and decongestants of the earlier
prescription had been omitted and restorative drugs to increase the vitality and
nourish the blood, such as lycoperdon, nipplewort and angelica, had been
substituted. He gave instructions for the medicine to be made up immediately. He
seemed distressed.
‘This is dreadful. If anything should happen to you after this, I shall never forgive
myself.’
Skybright, lying back on her pillow, hooted derisively at his concern:
My dear young Master, just get on with your own affairs and don’t worry about me.
I’m not about to go into a decline, I assure you!’
Bao-yu was in any case obliged to go now; but having held out at his uncle’s place
until the afternoon, he managed to get back to her by pretending that he was feeling
unwell.
Skybright was certainly quite ill. Fortunately she was normally an active, lively sort of
girl, not given to moping and vapours; she had always been sensible—even
abstemious—in her diet; and her constitution was a sound one. The Jias were great
believers in the virtues of fasting. Masters and servants alike were put on a starvation
diet at the slightest hint of a cough or cold, the physic and nursing they received
being considered of only secondary importance to this, and Skybright had been
fasting now for two or three days, ever the influenza began. In addition to this, she
had taken her medicine regularly and, except for the one night’s lapse, had looked
after herself reasonably well. Although the over-exertion set her back a few days, she
was soon on the mend again. And as the new catering arrangements whereby the
cousins now ate in their own apartments made ordering things much easier, Bao-yu
was able to get all sorts of soups and broths made up to aid her recovery.
Omitting details of this convalescence, our story passes on to the return of Aroma,
which occurred shortly after her mother’s funeral. As soon as she got back, Musk told
her all about Trinket and how Skybright had dismissed her first and reported the
dismissal afterwards to Bao-yu. Aroma merely remarked that Skybright had been ‘too
hasty’, but made no further comment.
Li Wan had herself now fallen a victim to the season’s cold; Lady Xing was suffering
from an inflammation of the eyes which necessitated Ying-chun’s and Xiu-yan
attendance on her both mornings and evenings to dress them for her; Mrs Li had
been invited to spend some days with a younger brother and gone off taking Li Wen
and Li Qi with her; and Bao-yu was preoccupied with Aroma, who was still thinking
con?stantly of her mother and liable at any moment to break down, as well as with
Skybright, who had still not entirely recovered. So what with one thing and another,
no one felt much in the mood for writing poetry and one or two of the club’s
fixture-days went by without a meeting.
It was now well into the twelfth month and Lady Wang and Xi-feng were busily
preparing for the New Year. The season of appointments brought news that Wang
Zi-teng had been promoted to the post of Inspector-General of Armies in the Nine
Provinces and that Jia Yu-cun was to become Under Secretary to the President of the
Board of War with occasional duties at Court. Over in the Ning mansion Cousin Zhen
had opened up the Hall of the Ancestors and set his people to work sweeping it,
setting the vessels out in readiness for the New Year sacrifices, and welcoming the
spirits back into the an?cestral tablets. He also had the main hall of the Ning-guo
mansion swept in readiness for the annual ceremonial hanging of the ancestral
portraits. Everyone in both mansions, both high and low, was in a fever of activity.
One morning in the course of these preparations, as You-?shi, who had not long since
risen, was, with the assistance of Jia Rong’s new wife, getting the presents of newly
made clothes ready for sending to Grandmother Jia, a maid came in bearing a trayful
of New Year medallions.
‘It’s from Merry, ma’am. He says that loose silver you gave him the other day was of
several different marks but the total weight was one hundred and fifty-three taels
and thirteen pennyweights and he says they’ve managed to make two hundred and
twenty medallions from it.’
She held out the tray for You-shi to inspect. On it there were medallions shaped like
plum-flowers, crabflower-shaped medallions, medallions with ‘heart’s desire’ rebus
patterns of ingot, brush and sceptre, and others with patterns of aus?picious flowers.


‘Yes,’ said You-shi, ‘they seem to be all right. Tell him to take them inside
immediately.’
The maid went off to do her bidding. Shortly after that Cousin Zhen came in to have
his lunch and Jia Rong’s wife hurried out to avoid him.
‘Have we received the bounty money for the New Year sacrifices yet?’ Cousin Zhen
asked You-shi when they were alone together.
‘I sent Rong to draw it this morning,’ said You-shi.
‘It’s not that we rely on the money exactly,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘but it is after all the
gift of the Emperor and I think we ought to draw it as soon as possible and get it
across to Lady Jia so that it can be used to pay for the offerings. It’s a double blessing
when the gracious favour shown us by His Majesty can be passed on to the ancestors.
However many thousands of our own we were to spend on them, it wouldn’t do
them nearly as much honour as these offerings subsidized by the imperial
bounty—not to mention the advantages that we enjoy as recipients of Imperial
favour. And we have to remember that apart from the one or two great families like
ours who don’t really need this money, there are many, many families of poor
hereditary officials who do actually depend on it for their ancestral sacrifices and
who wouldn’t be able to celebrate New Year properly without it. So you see it really
was extra?ordinarily benevolent and far-seeing of the dynasty to institute this annual
bounty.’
‘Yes, indeed,’ said You-shi.
‘Master Rong is back,’ a servant came in to report while the two of them were still
talking.
‘Tell him to come in,’ said Cousin Zhen
Jia Rong entered carrying a little yellow bag, not as one would normally carry a bag,
but holding it in both hands at shoulder height.
‘You’ve been a long time, haven’t you?’ said Cousin Zhen.
Jia Rong smiled nervously.
‘This year they’re not paying it at the Board of Rites any longer but at the treasury
of the Imperial Victuallers; so having first gone to the Board of Rites, I had to go from
there all the way to the Imperial Victuallers to draw the money. The people at the
Imperial Victuallers’ office all asked after you, by the way. They say they haven’t seen
you for a long time, but they often think about you.’
‘It’s not me they think about but my things,’ said Cousin Zhen with a dry smile.
‘Either that, or they are hoping for an invitation to come round over the New Year.’
He was inspecting the yellow bag as he said this. It had a sealing-slip with the words

PERPETUAL BOUNTY

written on it in large characters. On the other side was the chop of the Department
of Sacrifices of the Board of Rites and some columns of smaller characters:

             Annual grant awarded in perpetuity to Jia Yan, Duke
             of Ning-guo, and Jia Yuan, Duke of Rong-guo, for
             New Year Sacrifices: goods to the value of—taels net
             Cash received by: Jia Rong, Captain, Imperial Body-
?            guard, Inner Palace, on (date)
             Issuing officer for the year: (name)

This was followed by a cipher in red ink.
After inspecting the yellow bag, Cousin Zhen had his lunch; then, when he had
washed his hands and rinsed his mouth out, he changed into formal hat and boots
and, ordering Jia Rong to follow him with the bag, set off for the other mansion to
report the arrival of the bounty-money, first to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and
then to Jia She and Lady Xing next door. When they got back he took out the money
and ordered the bag to be carried into the Hall of the Ancestors and burnt there in
the great incense-burner in front of the ancestral tablets.
There were further orders now for Jia Rong:
‘I want you to go and ask your Aunt Lian whether she’s decided yet on which days
she’ll be entertaining in the New Year. If she has, get the office to make out a good,
clear list of the dates, so that we don’t have any duplicating this year. Last year
several families got invitations from both of us for the same day, and of course,
people being what they are, instead of realizing that it was a mistake, they assumed
that we had deliberately worked it out between us as an economy.’
Jia Rong hurried off to see Xi-feng, returning presently with the list of dates that his
father had asked for. After run?ning his eye over it, Cousin Zhen handed it to a
servant.
‘Give this to Lai Sheng. Tell him to avoid these dates when he sends out our New
Year invitations.’
He and Jia Rong went on to inspect operations in the hall, where a number of pages
were carrying in and arranging the large screens on which the portraits of the
ancestors were to be hung, and cleaning and polishing the tables and the ritual
vessels of gold and silver which were to be set up in front of them. While they were
thus engaged, a page came in holding a red greetings-card and a schedule containing
some sort of list.
‘Bailiff Wu from Black Mountain village, sir. He’s just arrived.’
‘That old rascal?’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘He’s been long enough getting here!’
Jia Rong took the greetings-card and schedule from the servant, and opening up the
card, held it out for his father to read. Cousin Zhen folded his hands behind his back
and bent over to read the inscription:

Wu Jin-xiao, Bailiff, presents his Humble Compliments
to the
Master and Mistress
and compliments to
The Young Gentlemen and Ladies
wishing you
Wealth, Health and Prosperity
Increase of Pay and Promotion
and
all your Heart’s Desire in the
Coming Year
Cousin Zhen laughed.
‘These country people have an original sense of style.’
‘Never mind the style,’ said Jia Rong, echoing his father’s laughter with obsequious
laughter of his own, ‘just think of all the good luck he is wishing us!’
He opened up the schedule and held it out while Cousin Zhen ran his eye down the
list:

         tufted deer                             30
         water deer                              50

‘Bring him in,’ said Cousin Zhen when he had finished perusing the schedule.
Wu Jin-xiao promptly appeared. He knelt down in the courtyard below and had
already kotowed and called out his greetings before Cousin Then could have him
raised up and brought into the hall.
‘You are still hale and hearty then?’ Cousin Then asked him.
‘Yes, sir, thank you sir,’ said the old man, beaming. ‘I still manage to get about.’
‘Your sons must be quite big fellows by now,’ said Cousin Then. ‘Why don’t you let
them do the travelling for you?’
‘To tell you the truth, sir, I’m so used to the journey, I’d miss it now if I wasn’t to
come. Shouldn’t know what to do with myself. The boys would be only too glad to
come if I’d let them, of course—see what it’s like here “in the Emperor’s shadow” as
we say—but they’re only youngsters yet: I’d be afeared of them having some mishap
on the way. A few years longer and I shan’t need to worry.’
‘How many days have you been on the road?’ said Cousin Then.
‘Well, sir, as you know, there was a lot of snow this year: it must have been lying
three or four foot thick in places. And that sudden thaw we had coming on top of it
made the going very difficult. That must have put us back several days. It’s taken a
month and two days altogether. But I do assure you, sir, seeing that the time was
running out and knowing how anxious you’d be, we made as much speed as we
could.’
‘I was wondering what could have made you so late,’ said Cousin Then. ‘Well, I’ve
been looking at this list of yours. I see you’re holding out on me again this year, you
old devil.’

Wu Jin-xiao advanced a couple of steps—springing, as it were, to his own defence:
‘It’s like this, sir. The harvests this year have been really terrible. From the third
month to the eighth month it rained on and off all the time. I doubt we had six fine
days in a row together. Then in the ninth month we had hall as big as tea?cups. For
fifty miles around, the damage to crops and livestock—and houses and people as
well, for that matter—was terrible. That’s why I haven’t brought you more this year.
That’s the honest truth, sir. You know I wouldn’t lie to you.’
‘I’d reckoned on your bringing me at least five thousand taels,’ said Cousin Then,
frowning. ‘What am I supposed to do with an amount like this? We have only eight or
nine farms now and of those eight or nine two have declared themselves disaster
areas this year and aren’t contributing anything. With you holding back on me too, I
might as well give up celebrat?ing New Year altogether.’
‘Your lands have done better than some,’ said Wu Jin-xiao. ‘Take my cousin’s place.
That’s only thirty mile from where I am, but my word, what a difference! My cousin
manages eight farms for your relations at the other House. They’ve got several times
as much land as you, but the vittles he’s brought them this year are no more than
this lot here, and their cash yield on sales is no more than two or three thousand.
Now they really ha~ got something to make a fuss about.’
‘It’s true,’ said Cousin Then. ‘We’re not too badly off on this side. At least we
haven’t got any new major commitments outside our regular annual expenditure. For
us it’s a question of spending a bit more freely when we’re flush and economiz?ing a
bit when things are tighter. And even in the case of these New Year expenses, I
suppose I could cut down on them if I really had to. It would simply be a question of
brazening it out. But with our Rong-guo cousins it’s different. They’ve had all these
new expenses during the past few years, none of which were optional, but no new
source of income to set against them. Which means that for the past year or two
they’ve had to start eating into their capital. If you folk can’t help them to make up
the deficit, who else is there they turn to?’
‘I know they’ve got a lot on their plate,’ said Wu Jin-xiao with a knowing smile, ‘but
it can’t all be outgoings, can it? There must be something coming in as well. Surely
Her Grace and old Live-For-Ever must give them a hand-out once in a while?’
Cousin Then turned to Jia Rong with a laugh.
‘You heard that? Rich, isn’t it?’
Jia Rong tittered.
‘What does a countryman like you living at the back of beyond know about such
matters? You don’t suppose Her Grace has handed them the keys of the Emperor’s
treasury, do you? She’s not her own mistress, even if she wanted to. She does give
presents, of course, but it’s only on birthdays and feastdays and the like and never
more than a few lengths of figured satin or some curios or knick-knacks. Even when
she gives money, at the very most it will be a hundred gold. Now say a hundred gold
is worth a thousand silver taels—it can’t be much more than that—what possible
good can a thousand taels do them, when during each of the past two years they’ve
been forced to draw on their capital to the tune of several thousands a year? During
the first of those two years they had the Visitation—including the building of that
great garden. Just imagine what that must have cost them. Another two years like
these last two with another Visitation thrown in and they’ll be cleaned out!’
‘These simple country souls see “the bright outside but not the dark within”,’ said
Cousin Zhen. ‘The situation our Rong-?guo cousins are in is like the proverbial
chime-hammer made of phellodendron wood: imposing to look at but bitter inside.’
‘You can tell they really are hard-up,’ said Jia Rong half? jokingly. ‘The other day I
heard Auntie Lian plotting with Faithful to steal some of Lady Jia’s things to use as
security for a loan.’
‘No, I think that was merely our Feng being her usual artful self,’ said Cousin Then,
laughing. ‘They’re still not that poor. I expect she has noticed how much they have
been spending. beyond their means and is planning some economy or other. What
you overheard would simply have been her way of let?ting people know how
hard-up they are and preparing them for some cuts. I’ve got a rough idea of how
their finances stand at present and I assure you that they aren’t quite as desperate as
that yet.’
Concluding the conversation on this more reassuring note, Cousin Then gave Wu
Jin-xiao into the charge of the servants with instructions that he was to be properly
looked after and entertained. Our narrative does not follow the old man into the
servants’ quarters, however, but remains in the hall with Cousin Then.
Cousin Then had a portion of the things that Wu Jin-xiao had brought set aside to be
used as offerings to the ancestors; he had another portion set aside for sending to
Rong-guo House; and while Jia Rong attended to its delivery, he person?ally
supervised the selection of a third portion which he intended to keep for his own use.
What remained he had piled up in orderly heaps on the pavement beneath the hall
terrace to be shared out among the junior members of the clan, who were forthwith
invited to come and collect their shares.
At that point a large consignment of things arrived from the other mansion, most of
them things to be used in the an?cestral sacrifices, but some of them for Cousin Then
himself. Having given orders for their disposal, Cousin Then went back to his
supervision of the polishing and furniture-shifting in the hall. When that work was
completed, he put on a lynx-skin coat and went out, still in his slippers, on to the
terrace, where, having found himself a warm place under the eaves, he got the
servants to spread out a wolfskin rug for him so that he could sit there and watch the
young clansmen as they came to collect their shares. He noticed that Jia Qin was
among them.
‘What are you doing here?’ he called out to him. ‘Who told you to come?’
Jia Qin came over and stood in front of him, arms held submissively at his sides.
‘I heard that you were having a family share-out, Uncle, so I came along without
waiting to be called.’
‘These things I’m giving away now are intended for those of your uncles and
cousins who haven’t got jobs or private incomes to support them,’ said Cousin Then.
‘During the years when you were unemployed yourself, I used to give you a share of
the New Year things. But you aren’t unemployed now: you’ve got that supervisor’s
job that my Rong-guo cousins gave you, looking after those young nuns in the family
temple. Not only have you got a salary of your own, but you control all the nuns’
allowances as well. Yet still you come here for my things. You are too greedy. And just
look at you! No one would think from your appearance that you had money to spend
and a responsible position. You used to have the excuse that you had no money, but
what excuse have you got now? You look even more disreputable now than you did
when you were unemployed!’
‘I’ve got a big family to support,’ said Jia Qin. ‘I have a lot of expenses.’
‘Humbug!’ said Cousin Then. ‘I know what you get up to in that temple of yours,
don’t think I don’t! Once you set foot in that place, you are the master and nobody
there can gainsay you. With money to spend and the rest of us a long way away in
the city, you can do exactly as you like: invite the local riff raff in every night to
gamble with you and fill the place with your kept women and fancy boys. So having
squandered all the money and reduced yourself to the disgraceful state I see you in
now, you have the effrontery to try and get something out of me. All you are likely to
get out of me, young man, is a good stout stick across the shoulders! And when this
holiday is over, I shall make it my business to have a word with your Uncle Lian and
see to it that he has you recalled.’
Jia Qin reddened, but dared not say anything.
A servant came up then to report:
‘Someone with a present from the Prince of Bei-jing, sir. Two scrolls and a
perfume-bag.’
Cousin Then turned to Jia Rong.
‘Go and entertain him for me. Tell him I’m out.’
Jia Rong hurried off.
Cousin Zhen then dismissed Jia Qin, and having presided over the distribution until
all the things had been taken, re?turned to his own apartment to have his dinner
with You-shi.
Concerning the rest of that day and the night which fol?lowed our narrative is silent.
The day after that was even busier. But to give further details of these preparations
would be tedious. Suffice it to say that by the twenty-ninth of the twelfth month they
had been completed. In both mansions new door-gods had been pasted up on all the
doors, the inscribed boards at the sides and over the tops of gateways had been
repainted, and fresh ‘good luck’ slips—auspicious couplets written in the best
calligraphy on strips of scarlet paper—had been pasted up at the sides of all the
entrances. In the Ning-guo mansion the central doors of the main outer gate, of the
ornamental gate, of the outer reception hall, of the pavilion-gate, of the inner
reception hall, of the triple gate dividing the inner from the outer parts of the
mansion, and of the inner ornamental gate were all thrown Open, so that a way was
opened up from the street right through into the family hall inside. Red lanterns on
tall scarlet stands lined either side of this route. At dusk, when the candles in them
were lit, they took on the appearance of two long, parallel serpents of light,
undulating slightly where they ascended or descended the steps of terraces.
Next day, the last of the Old Year, Grandmother Jia and any of the Jia ladies who
possessed patents of nobility attired themselves in the court dress appropriate to
their rank and were borne in procession to the Palace, Grandmother Jia at the head
in a palanquin carried by eight bearers, to make their kotows to the Imperial
Concubine and felicitate her on the successful conclusion of the year. On their return
from the banquet which she gave them, their chairs were set down out?side the
pavilion-gate of the Ning-guo mansion, where those of the younger Jia males who
had not escorted them to the Palace were lined up on either side of the gateway
waiting to receive them. When the ladies had all alighted, the young men conducted
them on foot to the Jia family’s Hall of the An?cestors.
Bao-qin had never been inside this part of the mansion before. She was being
allowed in on this occasion by virtue of her recent adoption into the family and was
anxious to take in every detail in order that she might retain as accurate an
im?pression of it as possible.
The Jia family’s Hall of the Ancestors was in a separate courtyard of its own in the
west part of Ning-guo House, away from the more domestic parts of the mansion—a
court?yard that was entered through an imposing five-frame gateway behind a
black-lacquered wooden paling. An inscription in large characters hung over the
central arch of the gate:

ANCESTRAL TEMPLE
OF THE
JIA FAMILY
with a column of smaller characters in the lower left hand part of the board
indicating that the calligrapher was a direct descendant in the sixty-somethingth
generation of the Sage Confucius. A long couplet from the brush of the same
calli?grapher occupied the two vertical boards at the arch’s sides:

                 With loyal blood poured out willingly upon the ground
                 a myriad subjects pay tribute to their benevolent rulers

             For famous deeds lauded resoundingly to the skies
                  a hundred generations offer sacrifices to their heroic ancestors

Inside the gate a raised white marble walk shaded by an avenue of venerable pines
and cypresses led up to a terrace on which ancient bronze tripods were ranged. Over
the entrance to the temple’s vestibule, whose penthouse-roof swept forwards from
the main building’s fa?ade, hung a board framed in a carved and gilded border of
nine interlacing dragons and in?scribed in the Late Emperor’s calligraphy with the
following words:

HIS MINISTERS ARE AS SHINING STARS

The vertical inscriptions on either side were in the same Im?perial hand:

             Their achievements outshone the celestial luminaries
             Their fame is reflected in the generations that come after them

The board over the entrance to the main hall of the temple was framed by two
contending dragons and its inscription was of incised characters infilled in green.
Both it and the matching couplet below it were in the calligraphy of the reigning
sovereign:

HONOUR THE DEAD AND KEEP THEIR MEMORIAL

             Their sons and grandsons enjoy the fruits of their blessedness
             The common people recall Ning and Rong with kindness

Beyond the flickering brilliance of many lights and the glint and sheen of drapes and
hangings Bao-qin could make out some of the spirit tablets of the ancestors, but not
very clearly.
By ancient custom the menfolk were divided in ranks to left and right of the hall so
that each generation was on a different side from the one which followed it, fathers
and sons separ?ated, grandfathers and grandsons together. Jia Jing presided over the
sacrifice with Jia She acting as his assistant; Cousin Then held the drink-offering; Jia
Lian and Jia Cong the silk-offering; Bao-yu carried the incense; Jia Chang and Jia Ling
unrolled the kneeling-mat in front of the great incense-burner Then the black-coated
musicians struck up and the ceremony began.: the threefold offering of the Cup, the
standings, kneel?ings and prostrations, the burning of the silk-offering, the
libation—every movement precisely in time to the solemn strains of the music. The
music ceased at the same time as the ceremony, and the participants filed out and,
grouping them?selves round Grandmother Jia, conducted her to the main hall of the
Ning-guo mansion where, under the richly-embroidered frieze which hung high in
front of them, against a background of brilliantly-decorated screens, high above the
smoking in?cense and flickering candles of the altar, the portraits of the ancestors
hung, those of the ducal siblings, Ning-guo and Rong-guo, resplendent in dragon
robes and jade-encrusted belts, in the centre and somewhat raised above the rest.
The men ranged themselves in ascending order of seniority in the space between the
hall and the ornamental gate, so that the two most junior ones, Jia Xing and Jia Zhi,
were just inside the gate and the two most senior ones, Jia jing and Jia She, were at
the top of the terrace steps and under the eaves of the hall. The womenfolk of the
family were ranged inside the hall in corresponding ranks but in reverse order: that is
to say, the most junior were nearest the threshold and the most senior furthest
inside the hall, but whereas the senior male in a generation was at the east end of his
row, the senior female in the same generation would be at the west end of hers, and
vice versa. The male domestics of all ages were ranged in the courtyard on the
further side of the ornamental gate.
The manner of making the offerings was as follows: Each ‘course’ was passed from
hand to hand by the servants until it reached the ornamental gate. There it was
received by Jia Xing and Jia Zhi and passed on from hand to and until it reached Jia
Jing at the top of the terrace steps. Jia Rong, as senior grandson of the senior branch
of the family, was permitted, alone of all the males, to stand inside the threshold
with the women. He received the dishes from his grandfather Jia Jing’s hands and
passed them to his wife, Hu-shi. Hu-shi passed them to the row ending in Xi-feng and
You-shi, who passed them forwards to Lady Wang standing at the side of the altar.
Lady Wang then put them into the hands of Grandmother Jia, who raised them up
reverently towards the portraits before laying them down on the altar in front of her.
Lady Xing stood to the west of the altar facing eastwards and helped her lay them
down. When meat, vegetables, rice, soup, cakes, wine and tea had all been
transmitted to the altar by this human chain and offered up there by Grandmother
Jia and her two daughters-?in-law, Jia Rong withdrew and took up his position next to
Jia Qin in the courtyard below, at the head of the most junior generation of Jia family
males.
Now came the most solemn part of the ceremony. As Grandmother Jia, clasping a
little bundle of burning joss sticks with both her hands, knelt down for the
incense-offering, the entire congregation of men and women, rank upon rank of
them, close-packed as flowers in a flower-bed, knelt down in perfect time with her
and proceeded to go through the motions of the Great Obeisance. This was done
with such silent concentration that, from five-frame hall and three-frame vestibule,
from portico and terrace, terrace steps and courtyard, for some minutes nothing
could be heard but the faint tinkling made by jade girdle-pendants and tiny golden
bells and the soft scrape and scuffle of cloth-soled boots and shoes.
The ceremony over, Jia Jing, Jia She and the rest of the menfolk hurried back to the
Rong-guo mansion so that they could be waiting there in readiness to make their
kotows to Grandmother Jia on her return.
In You-shi’s main reception-room, whither the ladies re?paired now from the hall, the
floor had been entirely covered with a great red carpet and a huge gold cloisonné
incense-burner with a loach-lipped rim and three massive legs shaped like the trunks
of elephants stood in the middle.
In the centre of the kang—also new-carpeted, but in scarlet—a dark-red back-rest
had been placed with a design showing a couchant dragon coiled around the
character for ‘longevity’. Large bolsters of the same colour and with the same design
on them had been placed as arm-rests at right-angles to it; for extra warmth a black
fox-fur had been draped around the top of it, and there was a white fox-fur mg
between the bolsters, for sitting on. When Grandmother Jia had been installed on
this furry throne, several old great aunts were invited to sit on fur rugs that had been
spread out on the kang to left and right of it. Lady Xing, Lady Wang and other ladies
of their generation were installed on fur rugs on a smaller kang in an alcove-room to
the side of the main kang and discreetly separated from it by an openwork wooden
screen. On the floor below, in two facing rows, were a dozen carved lacquer chairs,
on which Bao-qin and the other cousins were invited to sit. They had chair-backs and
seat-covers of squirrel, and large copper foot-warmers in place of footstools.
You-shi and her daughter-in-law Hu-shi now appeared with tea-trays in their hands,
and while You-shi offered tea to Grandmother Jia, Hu-shi served the old aunties.
After that You-shi passed into the alcove and served tea to Lady Xing and the other
ladies on the smaller kang, and Hu-shi served the cousins sitting in chairs below.
Xi-feng, Li Wan and a few other young married women of their generation, debarred
from taking tea either with the elder ladies or with their young unmarried cousins,
stood idly by, on the floor below the kang, ‘in attendance’. Lady Xing and her group,
as soon as they had finished drinking their tea, rose and moved over to where
Grandmother Jia was sitting on the kang so that they too might be ‘in attendance’.
After exchanging a few words with the other old ladies while she sipped her tea,
Grandmother Jia gave orders for her palanquin to be made ready. At once Xi-feng
climbed up on to the kang and began helping her to her feet.
‘But we’ve already prepared dinner for you here,’ said You?-shi. ‘You never stay
with us for dinner on New Year’s Eve. Won’t you make an exception just this once?
Surely my cater?ing can’t be all that inferior to Feng’s?’
Xi-feng continued to help Grandmother Jia from the kang. ‘Come on, Grannie, let’s be
getting home! Pay no attention to lien’
Grandmother Jia laughed.
‘You’re so busy with the sacrifices,’ she said. ‘You’re worked off your feet as it is; I’m
sure you don’t want the bother of feeding me as well. Besides, in past years when I
haven’t stayed, you have Sent the food over to me. Why don’t you do that again this
year? I don’t feel like eating very much now; but if you send it over, I shall be able to
save it up for tomorrow, and then I shall be able to eat more of it than I could now.’
This made everyone laugh.
‘See that you get someone thoroughly dependable to sit up and keep an eye on the
candles tonight,’ Grandmother Jia said by way of parting admonition. ‘Where fire is
concerned, one can’t afford to take chances.’
You-shi, escorting her meanwhile from the room, assured her that she would do so.
At the pavilion-gate You-shi and the other ladies hid them-selves behind the
gate-screen from the eyes of the waiting menservants while Grandmother Jia got into
her palanquin. Pages of the Ning-guo mansion went ahead of the bearers and, as
they approached the outer gate, directed them through the centre of its three
gateways. Lady Xing and Lady Wang fol?lowed in their less imposing conveyances,
accompanied by You-shi, who was also going over to the other mansion.
Outside, while they were being borne in a westerly direction down the street, the
ladies could see the achievements, in?signia and musical instruments (bells, gongs,
stone-chimes and drums hung in magnificently carved, painted and tasselled stands)
of the Dukes of Ning-guo and Rong-guo, those of the Duke of Ning-guo along the
eastern half of the street outside the south wall of the Ning-guo property, and those
of his brother-duke outside the Rong-guo wall to its west.
As in the other mansion, the centre-gates throughout Rong-?guo House were all
thrown open so that a way was clear from the outer gate right through to the Hall of
Exalted Felicity inside. But this time, instead of going through to the pavilion-gate and
getting out there, they turned left after the outer reception hall and were carried to
the main reception hall in Grandmother Jia’s part of the mansion. The others
assembled round the old lady as they got out of their sedans and followed her into
the hall. Here, too, everything had been transformed: brilliantly embroidered screens
and cushions specially brought out for the occasion and an incense-burner set down
in the middle of the room from which emanated delicious odours of pine and cedar
and Hundred Blend aromatic.
As soon as Grandmother Jia was seated, a venerable nannie came up to her to report
that ‘the old ladies had arrived to make their kotow’ and she hurriedly got up again
and ad?vanced to welcome two or three elderly female relations who had just come
into the hall. A good deal of polite tussling ensued, accompanied on both sides by
laughter and protesta?tions, as Grandmother Jia took the hands of each old lady in
turn and, while the old ladies pretended that they were struggling to kneel, made a
great show of struggling to pre?vent them—for although Grandmother Jia was their
senior, they were in the same generation as her and too elderly to be allowed to
kotow in earnest. They sat down for a while after that and took a cup of tea; then
Grandmother Jia saw them out, but no farther than the inner ornamental gate.
When she had returned and was once more enthroned on the principal seat in the
hall, Jia Jing and Jia She came forward with all the menfolk in the family in rows
behind them to make their kotow.
‘You all do so much for me during the year,’ Grandmother Jia protested. ‘Can’t we
forget about the kotow?’
But nobody heeded her. Rank upon rank of them, the males in one large group and
the females in another, knelt down together and bowed their foreheads to the
ground. After that folding chairs were brought and put down in a row to left and right
of Grandmother Jia’s seat and the next most senior members of the family sat down
and received their kotows, and so on by order of seniority downwards, until all but
the most junior members of the family had been kotowed to; but now even their
turn arrived and they too were allowed to sit down as the domestics of both
households, men-servants and women-servants, pages and maids, came in by order
of their various ranks and duties and made their kotows to their em?ployers.
After that the New Year’s Eve wish-penny was distributed to servants and
children—gold or silver medallions in little embroidered purses—and the New Year’s
love-feast was laid, tables on the east side of the hall for men and boys, tables on the
west side for girls and women. There was herb-flavoured New Year’s Eve wine and
love-feast soup, there were lucky-?cakes and wish-puddings; and when all had eaten
and drunk, Grandmother Jia rose and went into an inner room to change out of her
Court dress, which she had all this time been wear?ing. This was a signal for the
others present to disperse.
As darkness came on, offerings of cakes and burning joss? sticks were made in front
of all the Buddha-shrines and in all the little niches of the Kitchen God, who is
welcomed back this night from his annual trip aloft. In the main courtyard, outside
Lady Wang’s apartment, an ‘altar to heaven and earth’ was set up - a long table on
which offerings of sticky fried honey-sticks and fresh apples and steamed wheat-flour
cakes and other goodies had been built up, layer upon layer, into a little pagoda of
offerings in front of a large colour-print representing the whole host of heaven (or as
much of it as the artist had been able to fit in). Great horn lanterns hung at either
side of the main entrance to Prospect Garden to illuminate the gateway, and
innumerable standard lamps lit up its alley-ways and courtyards and walks. As for the
inhabitants of the mansion, all of them, both masters and servants, seemed, in their
dazzling holiday array, like walking flower-gardens of brilliant embroidery and
brocade. And all night long a confused hubbub of talking and shouting and laughter
arose, punctuated by the continual, unceasing pops and bangs of exploding
firecrackers.
At four o’clock in the morning, as the drums of the fifth watch were sounding,
Grandmother Jia and the other ladies once more got into their court dresses and
were borne in pro?cession to the Palace, this time to felicitate Yuan-chun on the
advent of the New Year. Livened footmen walked ahead of them carrying the full
paraphernalia to which Grandmother Jia’s rank entitled her. Once more Yuan-chun
feasted them; once more, on their return from the Palace, they made offer?ings to
the ancestors in their shrine in the Ning-guo mansion; and once more, on returning
to her own apartment in Rong-?guo House, Grandmother Jia received the
prostrations of the assembled family. As soon as that was over, she changed out of
her court clothes and declared that she was going to rest, refusing to see any of the
friends and relations who now began arriving in great numbers to offer their New
Year felicitations, and spending her time either quietly conversing with Aunt Xue and
Mrs Li or, as an occasional diversion, playing games of cards or Racing Go with Bao-yu
and the girls.
But Lady Wang and Xi-feng, on both this and each of the seven or eight days which
followed, were kept busy entertain?ing the guests whom the family had invited to
drink their New Year wine. In both the reception hall and the courtyard out?side it
there were plays to watch and tables at which the un?ending stream of visitors could
sit for a while and eat and drink while they watched them.
And no sooner was that lot of entertaining over than another lot had to be prepared
for as the First Moon waxed greater and the Lantern Festival drew near. Again the
Ning and Rong mansions were gay with lanterns and decorations. On the eleventh of
the month Jia She entertained Grand-mother Jia and the rest of the family and on the
twelfth it was Cousin Zhen’s turn to play host, while for several days run?ning Lady
Wang and Wang Xi-feng were most of the time out visiting one or other of the
innumerable families from whom they bad received invitations.
On the evening of the fifteenth Grandmother Jia had tables laid for a feast in her big
‘new’ reception hall—the scene of Xi-feng’s fateful birthday-feast. A stage was set up
for a troupe of child-actors which she had specially hired for this occasion, and both
the stage and hall were hung all over with lanterns of every imaginable shape and
colour. When her preparations were completed, she summoned all her children and
grandchildren, nephews and nieces, great-nephews and great-nieces to a family
feast.
As a matter of fact it is not strictly true that all of them were invited. Jia Jing was, for
religious reasons, a total abstainer from meat and strong drink, so he was not invited.
Obligations to the dead rather than to the living had brought him back for the holiday,
and on the seventeenth, two days after this, as soon as the last of the ancestral
sacrifices was over, he returned to his Taoist monastery outside the city and the
briefly inter?rupted pursuit of immortality. Meanwhile, when not actually engaged in
discharging ceremonial duties, he spent all the time on his own in a quiet,
out-of-the-way corner of the mansion, in a state of incommunicado with the other
members of the family.
And Jia She, although he was invited, excused himself as soon as he had received a
party-gift from his mother. She knew that he felt uncomfortable in her presence and
did not attempt to detain him. Back in his own quarters, surrounded by cronies and
dependants, he could drink and admire the lan?terns while beautiful young women
played and sang for his delectation:

         Ears with pipes and songs beguiled,
         Eyes by silk skirts hypnotized.


—A different scene altogether from the one he had just left.
But let us return to the latter—to the reception hall in Grandmother Jia’s rear
courtyard, where a covered stage had been erected to accommodate the players.
Inside the hall some dozen or more tables had been laid facing outwards towards the
stage. They were arranged in a fan shape, with the two central tables in the place of
honour at the back and the rest of them raying out forwards to left and right of them.
At the side of each table a smaller, ornamental table had been placed on which were
arranged
1. a little three-piece incense set (a vase, a cassolette and a tripod, all made on a
miniature scale out of metal) in which Hundred Blend aromatic—a gift from the
Palace—was burn?ing;
2. a porcelain dish, eight inches long, four or five inches wide and two or three inches
deep, containing a miniature landscape made out of stones and mosses;
3. a small japanned tea-tray on which was one of Grand?mother Jia’s best china
teacups and a little individual mille fiori teapot in which choicest tea was brewing;
4. a little table-screen of red silk gauze, embroidered with flowers and appropriate
lines of ‘grass character’ verse, framed in a delicately carved pierced-work
sandalwood frame;*
5. a vase (each one a collector’s piece and each different from the rest) containing
the three friends winter’ or riches in a jade hall’ or some other flower arrangement,
mostly of fresh flowers that had been specially forced for the occasion.
The two tables in the place of honour at the back were occupied by Aunt Xue and
Mrs Li. To their left, at the head of the row of tables radiating outwards towards the
east side of the hall, there was a large, low wooden settle with a carved pierced-work
back of interlacing dragons, which had

* Stone’s Note to Reader:
These screens were embroidered by a Soochow girl called Hui-niang, who, as
member of a highly-cultivated Service family and an accomplished amateur painter
and calligrapher, embroidered only occasionally for her own diversion and not as a
means of making money. As the flowers embroidered on them were all copied from
flower-paintings by famous masters, their design and colouring were far superior to
the cruder, more garish productions of professional embroiderers; and the
accompanying verses, all chosen with impeccable taste from a wide range of literary
sources, were executed in black embroidery-silk with such consummate skill that
every hook and squiggle, every variation in thickness of line, every join and break in
the brush-written ‘grass script’ calligraphy was exactly reproduced, not mangled and
deformed as in the stilted, wooden attempts at copying of the commercial
embroiderer.
Since Hui-niang did not depend on her embroidery for a living, speci?mens of it,
despite its great fame, have always been hard to come by. Even among the rich and
great there are very few households which can boast a specimen. Such as do exist
are referred to by collectors as ‘Hui em?broidery’. But what are sometimes sold as
specimens of ‘Hui embroidery’ today invariably turn out to be imitations deliberately
made to take in the inexpert buyer. The real Hui-niang died tragically at the age of
eighteen, and there are in fact no genuine specimens of her work now to be had,
since the few houses which posse as a piece or two hold on to them tena?ciously and
refuse to part with them to would-be purchasers. Indeed, if a genuine specimen of
Hui-niang’s work were ever to come upon the market, its value would be incalculable.
The Jia family originally possessed three, of which two had been presented as a gift
to the Emperor only a year previously, leaving this set of sixteen little table-screens,
to which Grandmother Jia was so much attached that she kept them always in her
own apartment, unwilling that they should remain with the stock of objects
commonly drawn on for the family’s entertainment of guests, and only rarely, on
occasions of her own devising, brought them out to be admired.
Stone
been put there for Grandmother Jia to lie on. It was furnished with a back-rest and
bolsters and was large enough to have a fur rug spread out on it and still leave room
at one end for a small, exquisitely gilded table of foreign make on which had been
placed a teapot, a teacup, a spittoon, a napkin and, among various other small
objects, an eyeglass-case. Grandmother Jia rested with her feet up on the settle and,
after talking for a while with the company, took out the eyeglasses from their case
and looked through them at the stage.
‘I do hope you will forgive me for lying down like this in your presence,’ she
apologized to Aunt Xue and Mrs Li. ‘It’s very rude of me, I know, but I’m getting so
rheumaticky in my old age?
She made Amber get up on to the settle beside her and massage her legs by gently
pounding them with a ‘maiden’s fist’—a sort of short-handled mallet with a padded
leather head.
No feaster’s table with cover and drapes had been put in front of the settle, only the
little ornamental table with the table-screen and the incense set and vase of flowers.
The very elegant, somewhat larger table of normal height which would have been
hers if she had been sitting up with the rest had been placed somewhat to the left of
the settle and laid with wine-cups, soup-spoons and chopsticks for four. It was
occupied by Bao-qin, Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-yu. Although she could not sit with
them, Grandmother Jia kept up a pretence that they were eating together: each dish
as it arrived would be submitted to her inspection, and if she fancied it, would be
placed on the little table at her elbow; then, when she had tasted it, it would be
removed and set down in front of the four young people for them to finish.
After Grandmother Jia and her four grandchildren, the next along on the east side
was Lady Xing; after her came Lady Wang, then You-shi, then Li Wan, then Xi-feng,
and lastly Jia Rong’s wife, Hu-shi. Along the west side Bao-chai came first, next to her
mother, then Li Wen, then Li Qi, then Xiu-yan, then Ying-chun, then Tan-chun and
then Xi-chun.
Red-tasselled glass lanterns hung in rows from the beams overhead to left and right
of the diners. In front of them, on each of their tables, was an ingenious light
consisting of a flower-shaped candle attached to the base of a reflector in the form of
a vertical lotus leaf. These lotus leaves, though made of metal, were so skillfully
engraved and enamelled that they looked almost real. They were attached to their
metal stands by means of a swivel, so that the beams of the candle could be
concentrated in any direction desired. When all the reflectors were simultaneously
directed towards the stage, the diners’ view of the players was wonderfully
improved.
The wooden partitions with their window-lattices and doors which normally
separated the hall from the verandah had been removed and great palace lanterns of
glass, whose elaborately carved wooden frames were hung with strings of crimson
tassels, were suspended at intervals in the space thus created. More rows of
lanterns—lanterns of every kind of material and design— horn lanterns, glass
lanterns, gauze lanterns, lanterns of Yunnan glitter-glass, embroidered ones, painted
ones, lan?terns with cut-outs of paper or silk in them, hung in lines under the
verandah eaves, both inside and outside the archi?traves, and from the eaves of the
loggias on either side of the courtyard.
The tables on the verandah were all occupied by males: Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia
Huan, Jia Cong, Jia Rong, Jia Qin, Jia Yun, Jia Ling and Jia Chang.
Although Grandmother Jia had sent invitations by word of mouth to every clansman
and clanswoman residing in the city, some of them were too elderly to stand up to
the noise and excitement of a party, some were unable to come because they had no
one to look after the house for them while they were away, some had intended to
come but were prevented from doing so by illness, some stayed away from envy of
their richer clansmen or because they were ashamed of their own poverty, others
because they could not stand Xi-feng, and yet others because they were so unused to
company and in?capacitated by shyness that they dared not come—in short,
although the clan was a numerous one, for one reason or another, of all those invited
the only female guest who turned up was Lou-shi, mother of Bao-yu’s former
classmate, the intrepid little Jia Jun, who came bringing Jia Jun with her, and the only
male ones were those who had found employ?ment with the family under Xi-feng’s
auspices and were there-fore obliged to put in an appearance: Jia Qin, Jia Yun, Jia
Chang and Jia Ling. Yet even with the absence of so many who had been invited from
outside, for a family party the company was a large one.
Presently, while they all sat watching the players, Lin Zhi?-xiao’s wife came into the
hall leading six other women, each pair of whom were carrying between them a
small kang-table covered with a red felt top on which was a bundle of strung cash:
hundreds and hundreds of newly-minted copper coins, specially chosen for size and
quality, fastened together by a single long cord of crimson silk. Under the direction of
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife two of these tables were set down in front of Mrs Li and Aunt Xue
and the third one beside Grandmother Jia’s settle.
‘Do it in the middle, where everyone can see’ said Grand?mother Jia.
The women all knew what was expected of them. Setting the tables down in the
centre of the hall, they simultaneously undid the ends of the crimson cords with
which the money was fastened and began pulling them out so that the coins tumbled
in heaps upon the tables.
The play being performed on this occasion was The House in Pin-kang Lane, and the
actors had just come to the end of that section of it called ‘Meeting in the Sickroom’.
The hero Yu Shu-ye, having at last met the love of his life only to be called by stern
duty from her side, had just left the stage in chagrin. At this point the child-actor
playing the part of his little page Leopard Boy, observing what was going on in the
hall, began to extemporize:
‘You can go off in a huff if you like; but today is the fifteenth of the first month and
did Lady Jia of Rong-guo House is holding a family party; so what lam going to do is to
get on this horse and gallop there as quickly as I can and ask them for some
sweeties!’
This caused Grandmother Jia and the rest of the audience to burst out laughing.
‘That’s a sharp little fellow,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘How sweet!’
‘And he’s barely nine,’ said Xi-feng.
‘Barely nine!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And being able to come out with it so pat!’
She nodded in the direction of the waiting women.
‘Largesse!’
Three of the women had already provided themselves with small shallow baskets in
readiness for this order. At the word of command they walked up to the little tables,
shovelled up basketfuls of coins from the heaped-up money, and took them outside
to the foot of the stage which Leopard Boy had just vacated.
‘Largesse from Lady Jia, Mrs Xue and Mrs Li for Leopard Boy to buy himself some
sweets with,’ said one of the women.
The three of them then discharged the contents of their baskets upon the stage. The
money landed with a mighty clatter and at once the whole stage was covered with
shining pennies.
Cousin Then had ordered his own pages to have a large flat basket of money ready
for his own largesse to the players.
But you will have to wait for the next volume, gentle reader, in order to find out
whether they received it.

CHAPTER 54

Lady Jia ridicules the cliches of romantic fiction
And Wang Xi-feng emulates the filial antics
of Lao Lai-zi



TO CONTINUE OUR STORY:

Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian had secretly instructed their pages to have a large
flat-bottomed basket of largesse-money in readiness, and when they heard
Grandmother Jia call out ‘Largesse!’, they told the pages to take this basket and
empty it onto the stage. The money showered down on the boards with a
tremendous ringing clatter, which greatly delighted the old lady.
The two men now rose to their feet. A page hurried forward and handed Jia Lian a
silver kettle of freshly-heated wine on a tray. Taking the kettle, Jia Lian followed his
cousin into the hall. Cousin Zhen went first to Mrs Li, bowed, took her wine-cup and,
turning back, handed it to Jia Lian to fill. Then he did the same for Aunt Xue. The two
ladies stood up, meanwhile, politely demurring:
‘Please, gentlemen, go back to your seats! You are too polite!’
With the exception of the four senior ladies - Aunt Xue, Mrs Li, Lady Xing and Lady
Wang - all the females present now left their seats and stood, hands at their sides,
while Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian went over to the couch on which Grandmother Jia
reclined. As it was rather a low one, the two men knelt to serve her. The other males,
who had followed them into the hall and were standing a little behind them drawn
up in their order of seniority, with Jia Cong at their head, seeing Cousin Zhen and Jia
Lian kneel, knelt down in a row behind them, whereupon Bao-yu hurriedly rose from
his chair and knelt down as well. Xiang-yun nudged him, amused.


‘What do you want to kneel down with them for?’ she whispered. ‘If you’re feeling
so polite all of a sudden, it would be more to the point to get up and serve everyone
your-self.’
‘So I shall, presently,’ Bao-yu whispered back at her.
The two men had now finished serving Grandmother Jia and gone on to serve Lady
Xing and Lady Wang.
‘What about the young ladies?’ Cousin Zhen inquired when these last two had
been attended to.
‘No, no, go and sit down now I’ Grandmother Jia and the senior ladies cried. ‘Spare
them the formality.’
At this Cousin Zhen and the other males withdrew.
It was now about ten o’clock and the play being performed
- the ‘Feast of Lanterns’ section from The Orphan’s Revenge -had reached a climax of
noise and excitement. Bao-yu tried to slip out unnoticed under cover of the din, but
his grand-mother had spotted him.
‘Where are you going?’ she called. ‘There are a lot of fire?works about outside.
Mind a piece of burning touch-paper doesn’t fall on you and set you alight!’
‘I’m not going very far,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll be back directly.’
Grandmother Jia ordered some of the old nannies present to go after him and see
that he was all right. Observing that he had only Musk and Ripple and a couple of
little junior maids in attendance, she asked what had become of Aroma.
‘That girl is getting above herself,’ she said. ‘Sending the younger maids to stand in
for her! - What next?’
Lady Wang rose hastily in Aroma’s defence.
‘It is only a few days since her mother died. She is still in mourning for her mother.
It wouldn’t be right for her to go out in company yet.’
Grandmother Jia nodded, but seemed to have second thoughts:
‘That’s all very well, but bereavement shouldn’t make any difference where a
master or mistress is concerned. Suppose she had still been working for me: do you
think she would have stayed away then? One doesn’t want this sort of thing to
become a precedent.’
Xi-feng came to her aunt’s assistance:
‘Even if she weren’t in mourning, she would still need to be keeping an eye on
things. Tonight, with lanterns and fire-works everywhere, there is a terrible danger of
fire. Whenever we have plays, the people from the Garden all come sneaking over
here to watch. It’s just as well to have one careful person like Aroma left behind
there who can go round making sure that everything is all right. Besides, she’ll be
able to see that everything is ready for Bao-yu so that he can go straight to bed when
he gets back. If she were here, you can be sure that no one else would bother. He
would go back to find his bedding cold, and there would be no hot water for his tea
or anything else ready for him. I’m afraid I took it for granted that you would prefer
her not to come; but if you want her here, Grannie, I can easily go and fetch her for
you.’
‘No, no, don’t fetch her,’ said Grandmother Jia hurriedly. ‘You have obviously given
the matter more thought than I. There’s only one thing, though. When did her
mother die? Why didn’t I get to hear about it?’
‘But Aroma came to tell you about it herself,’ said Xi-feng, smiling. ‘Surely you can’t
have forgotten already?’
Grandmother Jia thought for a bit.
‘Yes, I do seem to remember something about it. I’m afraid my memory isn’t up to
much these days.’
‘You can’t remember everything’ the others said reassuringly.
Grandmother Jia sighed:
‘She served me all those years when she was a little girl, then she was with Yun for
a while, and during these past few years she’s had that holy terror who left a
moment ago to put up with. I remember thinking at the time that we owe the girl a
bit of kindness - especially as she’s not one of our own home-reared servants but one
who came to us from outside - and meaning to ask them to give her something
towards the funeral when I heard that her mother had died, but I’m afraid that
afterwards I forgot.’
‘It’s already been taken care of,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Lady Wang gave her forty taels for
funeral expenses the other day.’
Grandmother Jia nodded:
‘Ah well, that’s all right then. As a matter of fact Faithful lost her mother too, quite
recently. I couldn’t let her go to the funeral because her parents were living in the
South. Since she and Aroma are both in mourning, why don’t we let her go and join
Aroma? The two of them can keep each other company.’
She ordered some of the women in attendance to make a selection of the cakes and
other delicacies they had been eating and take them for Faithful to eat with Aroma in
Green Delights.
‘You’re a bit late with your suggestion,’ said Amber, laughing. ‘Faithful went over to
Aroma’s place hours ago!’
This remark concluded the discussion and the company’s briefly distracted attention
returned now to the business of drinking and watching the play.

*

After leaving the party, Bao-yu made his way straight through to the Garden. The old
women whom his grandmother had sent after him, realizing that he must be
returning to his own apartment, did not accompany him inside but slipped into the
tea-kitchen of the gatehouse to warm themselves at the stove and avail themselves
of the opportunity for some surreptitious drinking and a hand or two of cards.
On entering his courtyard Bao-yu found Green Delights ablaze with lights but silent as
the grave.
‘Surely they can’t all have gone to bed?’ said Musk. ‘Let’s go in quietly and make
them jump.’
Bao-yu and the four girls tiptoed through the outer room and peeped through the
apertures of the mirror-wall into the room within. Aroma and another girl were lying
facing each other on the nearer side of the kang. At the further end two or three old
women appeared to be taking a nap. Bao-yu was just about to push open the
mirror-door and enter when the sound of a sigh came from the direction of the kang
and he could hear the voice of Faithful speaking:
‘You see, you can never be sure of anything in this life. Look at you, f6r example, on
your own here with a free family living outside, never sure from one year to the next
where they might move to: you never expected to be with your mother at the end,
did you? Yet it just so happened that this year she was living near at hand and you
were able to be a good daughter to her when she died.’
‘It’s true,’ said Aroma. ‘When I first came here, I didn’t think I’d ever see my mother
again. And do you know, when I went to tell Her Ladyship that she’d passed away, she
gave me forty taels for funeral expenses. She couldn’t have done more for me if I’d
been her own daughter. It’s certainly more than I’d have dared hope for.’
Bao-yu turned back and whispered to Musk and the others behind him:
‘It’s Faithful in there with her. I didn’t think she’d be here. If I go inside now, she’s
sure to rush off in a huff - she always does nowadays when she sees me. We’d better
go away again and leave the two of them in peace. Aroma must have been pretty
miserable on her own. It’s nice that she’s got Faithful with her to talk to.’
He tiptoed out again and taking his stand behind a rock, began hitching up his clothes.
Musk and Ripple, who were standing behind him, suppressed a giggle:
‘Why don’t you squat down to take off your underthings? You’ll get the wind on
your belly, standing up like that!’
The two junior maids who had been following behind Musk and Ripple, as soon as
they saw the reason for the halt, hurried off to the tea-kitchen for hot water to wash
his hands.
Bao-yu had finished and was just turning back to the waiting maids when two
women servants appeared, walking in his direction. Seeing this dark figure lurking
amongst the rocks, they loudly demanded who it was.
‘It’s Bao-yu,’ said Ripple. ‘Don’t shout at him like that, you’ll scare the daylights out
of him!’
‘Oh I am sorry,’ said the woman who had shouted. ‘What an awful thing to do - and
today of all days! How are you, young ladies? Having a nice holiday? You certainly
deserve it, after all your work during the rest of the year.’
As they came closer, Musk asked them what they were carrying.
‘It’s some things from Her Old Ladyship for Miss Faithful and Miss Aroma,’ said the
woman. ‘She suddenly thought of them, while she was watching the play.’
‘Oh?’ said Ripple. ‘I thought it was The Orphan’s Revenge they were watching, not
The Magic Casket!’
‘Take the lids off and let’s have a look,’ said Bao-yu.
The two women squatted on their haunches and held out the food-boxes while Musk
and Ripple took off the lids. Bao-yu leaned over and looked into them. Each one
contained a selection of the very choicest of the various sweet and savoury
confections they had been eating at the party. He nodded approvingly before
hurrying on. Musk and Ripple threw down the lids - somewhat carelessly - and
hurried after him.
‘Now those two women seemed very nice,’ said Bao-yu. ‘They were certainly very
civil. Think how hard they must work every day, Yet they could still say those nice
things about you - none of that boasting about how busy they are and how much
they do for us that you get from some of these people.’
‘Oh, those two are all right,’ said Musk. ‘Some of them are really terrible, though.’
‘They can’t help being stupid,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Being more intelligent than they are,
you ought to feel sorry for them. You only have to be a bit more forebearing with
them and they’d give you no trouble.’
While he was speaking, they were passing through the gate?way of the Garden. The
old women drinking and playing cards in the tea-kitchen had been taking it in turns
to get up and peep outside so as not to be taken off their guard, and seeing Bao-yu
through the gate, they came hurrying out after him.
In the gallery leading to the hall where the party was he came upon the two little
maids who had gone to fetch hot water. They had been waiting there for some time,
one with a basin of water, the other with a towel over her arm and a pot of hand
lotion. Ripple first tested the water with her hand.
‘The older you grow the more stupid you get,’ she said to the girl. ‘This water is
stone cold.’
‘Blame the weather, miss,’ said the girl. ‘I was afraid the water would cool quickly
so I poured it out boiling from the kettle, but you see it makes no difference.’
Just at that moment an old woman chanced to be passing by with a kettle full of
freshly-boiled water.
‘Here, missus,’ the girl with the basin called after her, ‘do us a favour! Come over
and pour some in this basin, will you?’
‘This is for Her Old Ladyship’s tea,’ said the old woman. ‘Go and get some yourself,
young lady - walking won’t spoil your feet!’
‘I don’t care who it’s for,’ said Ripple, ‘but if you won’t pour that water out for her, I
shall come and do it my?self.’
The old woman turned. Recognizing Ripple, she hurriedly lifted the kettle up and
poured some water into the basin.
‘That’s enough,’ said Ripple. ‘Really, a person of your age ought to have more sense!
We know it’s Her Old Ladyship’s. Do you suppose we’d have dared ask for it if we
weren’t entitled to?’
The old woman smiled apologetically:
‘My eyesight’s not too good. I didn’t recognize this young lady as one of yours.’
When Bao-yu had finished washing, the other girl poured some of the lotion onto his
palm and he rubbed it into his hands. Ripple and Musk took advantage of the hot
water to wash their own hands too, and after rubbing a little of the lotion into them,
followed Bao-yu back into the hall.
Calling for a kettle of warm wine, Bao-yu now took his turn at pouring for the ladies,
beginning with Mrs Li and Aunt Xue. They protested smilingly and begged him to go
back to his seat, but Grandmother Jia insisted that he should pour for them.
‘He’s young,’ she said. ‘Let him do it. But let us empty our cups first for this round.’
She drained her winecup as she said this. Lady Xing and Lady Wang followed suit and
the other two ladies felt constrained to imitate their example.
‘Pour Out for the girls too,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘And do it properly. See that they
empty their cups first before you fill them.’
‘Yes, Grandma,’ said Bao-yu, and proceeded from table to table, pouring for
everyone in turn. When he got to Dai-yu he hesitated, knowing that for her this sort
of drinking was an impossibility; but Dai-yu held her cup up to his lips and he drained
its contents for her at a gulp.
‘Thank you,’ she said, smiling gratefully. Bao-yu refilled the winecup.
‘Don’t go drinking cold wine, Bao-yu,’ Xi-feng called out to him. ‘It’ll make your
hand shake. You won’t be able to write properly or draw a straight bow.’
‘I haven’t been drinking cold wine,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I know, I know,’ said Xi-feng gaily. ‘I was only joking.’
When Bao-yu had finished pouring out for all the girls -all, that is, except Jia Rong’s
wife Hu-shi, who, being of a generation below his, had to have her drink poured out
for her by a maid - he went onto the verandah outside and poured for Cousin Zhen
and the men. Having done so, he sat and chatted with them for a while before going
back into the hall and resuming his seat with the ladies.
Presently soup was served and, shortly after, little First Moon dumplings of
sweetened rice-flour. Grandmother Jia expressed concern for the boy-actors outside
in the cold:
‘Tell them to break off for a bit, poor little things! Let them have some hot soup and
some good hot food to eat before they go on again. They can have some of these
cakes and things, and some of these dumplings.’
A few minutes later, the stage in the courtyard having by now fallen silent, two blind
female ballad-singers, both of them familiar visitors to the house, were led in by the
women. A couple of high stools were placed behind them, on which Grandmother Jia
invited them to be seated, and their instruments were handed to them, a pipa lute
and a three-stringed ‘samisen’ guitar. Grandmother Jia asked Mrs Li and Aunt Xue
what story they would like to hear.
‘Anything,’ they said.
Grandmother Jia turned to the two women:
‘Have you added anything new to your repertoire lately?’
‘Yes,’ said one of the women. ‘We’ve got a new story set in the Five Dynasties
period, after the fall of Tang.’
‘What’s it called?’ Grandmother Jia asked her.
‘It’s called The Phoenix Seeks a Mate,’ said the woman.
‘Well, the name sounds all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Can you give us an idea
what it’s about, then we can decide whether we want to hear it or not?’
‘This story took place in the time of the Five Dynasties after the decline of the
Tang,’ said the woman. ‘There was in those days a certain gentleman called Wang
Zhong who, after having served as Chief Minister under two successive reigns, had
retired because of old age to live on his estate in the country. Now this Wang Zhong
had an only son whose name was Wang Xi-feng -’
This set everyone laughing.
‘Feng’s double, evidently,’ said Grandmother Jia.
One of the womenservants gave the blind ballad-singer a prod:
‘Don’t talk such nonsense! That’s our Mrs Lian’s name.’
‘Carry on, carry on!’ said Grandmother Jia.
The blind woman rose to her feet:
‘I’m dreadfully sorry, Mrs Lian. I had really no idea it was your name.’
‘Do carry on,’ said Xi-feng, laughing. ‘That’s quite all right. Coincidences over names
are the commonest thing in the world.’
The woman sat down again and continued:
‘A time came when this old Sir Wang sent his son off to the capital to sit for the
examinations. One day, while the young man was on his journey, there was a great
downpour of rain and he was forced to seek shelter in a near-by grange. Now it so
happened that the owner of this grange was a former acquaintance of old Sir Wang’s
called Li, and this old Sir Li invited the young man to spend a few days with him at the
grange, accommodating him in his own study. Sir Li had no son of his own, but he
had an only daughter called Chu?luan, a very accomplished young lady who excelled
in every?thing she turned her hand to, whether it was performing on the qin or
playing Go or painting or calligraphy -’
‘I can see why it’s called The Phoenix Seeks a Mate,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You
don’t need to tell me what the story’s about, I can guess already. “Feng” means
“phoenix” and “Chu-luan” means “little hen phoenix”. Obviously it’s the story of how
Wang Xi-feng seeks to make this Li Chu-luan his wife.’
‘I believe Your Old Ladyship has heard this story before,’ said the blind woman,
smiling.
‘Her Old Ladyship has heard everything,’ someone told her. ‘And what she hasn’t
heard she can guess.’
‘These stories are all the same,’ said Grandmother Jia,’ so tedious! Always the same
ideally eligible young bachelors and the same ideally beautiful and accomplished
young ladies -at least, they are supposed to be ideal, but there’s certainly nothing
ideal about their behaviour - in fact there’s nothing very ladylike about them at all.
Invariably, we are told how well-born they are. Their father has been a Prime Minister,
or a First Secretary at the very least. They are always their father’s only child and the
apple of his eye. They are always amazingly well-educated, a model of decorum, a
regular paragon of all the virtues - that is, until the first presentable young man
comes along. As soon as he appears on the scene -it doesn’t matter who or what he
is - all their book-learning and the duty they owe their parents fly out of the window
and the next moment they are “making their plans for the future” and generally
carrying on in a way that would bring blushes to the cheek of a cat-burglar - certainly
not in the least like respectable, educated young ladies. You would hardly call a young
woman who conducted herself like that a “paragon”, however many books she might
have read - any more than you would acquit a young fellow charged with highway
robbery on the grounds that he was a good scholar. The people who make up these
stories give themselves the lie every time they open their mouths.
‘And for another thing: if these young women really belonged to cultivated,
aristocratic households in which the girls and their mothers were all educated people,
then even allowing for the somewhat reduced circumstances owing to their father’s
early retirement, you can be sure there would still be plenty of nannies and maids in
attendance on them. So how is it that in all of these stories there is only ever a single
confidante who knows what her young mistress is getting up to? What are all the
other servants supposed to be doing all this time? Of course, this is only another
example of the way in which these stories contradict themselves.’
There was some laughter from the assembled company and someone complimented
Grandmother Jia on her perceptive?ness in exposing the underlying falseness of
these stories.
‘There’s always a reason for it,’ the old lady went on. ‘In some cases it’s because the
writer is envious of people so much better off than himself, or disappointed because
he has tried to obtain their patronage and failed, and deliberately portrays them in
this unfavourable light as a means of getting his own back on them. In other cases
the writers have been corrupted by reading this sort of stuff before they begin to
write any themselves, and, though totally ignorant of what life in educated,
aristocratic families is really like, portray their heroines in this way simply because
everyone else does so and they think it will please their readers. I ask you now, never
mind very grand families like the ones they pretend to be writing about, even in
average well-to-do families like ours when do you ever hear of such carryings-on? It’s
a wonder their jaws don’t drop off, telling such dreadful lies! For my part, I have
never allowed these sort of stories to be told. Even the maids here don’t know about
such matters. It’s true that during the past year or two, since I’ve been getting older,
and particularly now that the young people are most of the time safely out of the
way in the Garden, I do once in a while listen to a snatch or two of one of these
stories, when I feel in need of cheering up a bit; but as soon as the children arrive, I
make the person telling it stop.’
Mesdames Li and Xue were thoroughly in agreement:
‘That is the general rule in all the best people’s houses. Even in our households the
children aren’t allowed to listen to such stories.’
Xi-feng walked over to pour the old lady a drink:
‘Come on, Grannie, that’s enough! Your wine will be getting cold. Drink this first to
wet your whistle. You can go on with your lecture afterwards.’
She turned to the rest of the company:
‘The story you’ve just been listening to is called Falsehood Exposed, or The Tale of a
Grandmother. It is a story which took place under the reigning dynasty, on this very
day of this very month of this very year on this very spot and at this very hour. How
can Grannie “with one mouth tell a double tale”? Ah, how indeed! Our tale puts forth
two tails. Which tail to wag? Wig-wag. But for the time being we do not inquire
which tale is false, which true. Our story turns rather to those people in the party
who were admiring the lanterns and watching the play... Just give these two kinsfolk
a chance to drink a cup of wine and watch a scene or two more of the play, Grannie,
and then you can get on with your Exposure of Falsehood -dynasty by dynasty.’
She continued unconcernedly pouring wine while her audience convulsed
themselves. Even the blind ballad-singers were in stitches.
‘You’ve got the gift, Mrs Lian,’ they said. ‘It’s what we call a “hard mouth”. If you
were to take up story-telling as a profession, we should be out of business!’
‘Don’t let them encourage you,’ said Aunt Xue to Xi-feng, laughing. ‘You must
behave yourself. There are people outside listening. This isn’t like every day, you
know.’
‘It’s only Cousin Zhen outside there,’ said Xi-feng. ‘He and I used to get up to all
sorts of mischief together in our younger days. It’s only during the last few years
since I’ve grown up and married Lian that I’ve had to start being a bit more
strait-laced with him. But even though we have to treat each other like solemn
in-laws nowadays, I’m sure he doesn’t mind me fooling about like this. Think of Lao
Lai-zi in the Twenty-Four Patterns of Filial Piety, dressing up in children’s clothes at
the age of seventy and playing at “dicky-bird” in front of his aged parents to keep
them amused. If Cousin Zhen and the other menfolk won’t come in here and play
dicky-bird themselves, the fact that I’m taking so much trouble to make Grannie
laugh and get her to eat a bit should make them feel pleased and grateful, not critical
of my behaviour.’
‘It’s true, I haven’t had a really good laugh for days,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘She has
made me laugh so much, I really do feel better for it. I think I’ll have another drop of
wine.
She took a sip from her cup and then turned to address
Bao-yu: ‘Pour a cup for your Cousin Feng.’
‘No need,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Let me share your good health.’ She took the cup that
Grandmother Jia had just been drink?ing from and tossed back what remained of the
wine in it, then, handing the cup to a maid to take away, she replaced it with a clean
one that had been previously warmed in hot water. She then proceeded to do the
same for everyone else, removing their dirty cups and replacing them with clean,
warmed ones. After that she poured out a fresh supply of wine for everyone before
returning to her seat.
‘If Your Old Ladyship doesn’t want to hear a story,’ said the blind woman who had
spoken before, ‘perhaps you’d like us to do a song for you.’
‘Give us “O Captain, Captain”,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The two women at once began tuning their instruments and presently struck up a
lively tune, the words of which were divided alternately between them.
Grandmother Jia inquired what the time was.
‘Midnight,’ said one of the senior womenservants.
‘No wonder it’s getting so cold,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It really is bitter.’
Maids were already arriving with more clothes, which they helped their mistresses to
change into or put on over what they were already wearing.
Lady Wang rose, smiling, to her feet:
‘Why don’t you go into the room at the back, Mother, where the heated kang is?
Mrs Li and my sister are not outsiders; I’m sure they won’t mind. And the rest of us
will take care of them for you.’
‘Why don’t we all go inside?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That will be much cosier.’
‘I doubt there’s room for us all,’ said Lady Wang.
‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We don’t need all these tables now. Why
don’t we have just two or three of them taken inside? We can have them put
together to make one big table, then we can all squeeze up round it and keep each
other warm. That will be much jollier!’
Everyone agreed that this was a good idea and got up from their places in
preparation for the move. The tables were cleared, the three largest ones were
carried into the inner room and put together, and the dessert, with various additions
and replacements, was relaid on them inside.
‘Now,’ said Grandmother Jia when everybody was inside, ‘you must forget about
seniority now and sit down where I put you.’
She made Mrs Li and Mrs Xue sit at one end, facing south, and placed herself close to
them on the east side, with Xiang?yun squeezed in on one side of her and Dai-yu and
Bao-qin on the other.
‘You must sit next to your mother,’ she told Bao-yu. So Lady Xing and Lady Wang
came next on the east side with Bao-yu sandwiched between them.
She put Bao-chai on the west side at the end nearest to Mrs Li, then came the Three
Springs, then Lou-shi with her little boy Jia Jun, then Li Wan and You-shi with little Jia
Lan squeezed in between them, and finally Xi-feng.
Jia Rong’s wife, Hu-shi, sat on her own at the north end, round the corner from
Xi-feng.
When they were all seated, Grandmother Jia called to Cousin Zhen and the menfolk
to leave, saying that she herself would shortly be going off to bed. Hearing her call,
Cousin Zhen came hurrying inside, bringing the others with him.
‘Go away, go away!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Don’t come in here! They’ve only just
sat down, they don’t want to have to all get up again. Off to bed with you! You’ve got
important things to do in the morning.’
‘Very good,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I’ll leave Rong behind then, to pour the drinks for
you.’
‘Ah yes,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’d forgotten him.’
Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian withdrew. Pleased to be so soon released, they arranged for
Jia Cong and Jia Huan to be escorted back to their own apartments and went off, as
they had planned to do if possible, to spend the rest of the night together on the
town. But that is no part of our story.
‘I was just thinking,’ said Grandmother Jia when they had gone, ‘ all these people
enjoying themselves here tonight: all we lacked was a young married couple to make
it seem like a proper reunion. I was forgetting about Rong. Sit next to your wife, Rong.
Let’s see you both together.’
Just then some of the women came in bringing a playbill with them. The players were
preparing to resume.
‘Oh, just as we were beginning to enjoy a little conversation,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Now we shan’t be able to hear ourselves speak. And those poor children must be
getting dreadfully cold after so many hours in the open. Why don’t we give them a
rest? Call our own troupe over and let them do something on this stage. The other
ones can stay here and watch them.’
With answering cries the women went out to make the necessary arrangements.
Messengers were sent, some into Prospect Garden to summon the young actresses,
others to the inner gate to requisition some pages. When the pages presented
themselves at the green-room door they were told to take away all the grown-up
members of the visiting troupe and entertain them elsewhere so that only the
boy-actors should be present when the little actresses arrived. These last were to be
observed shortly afterwards, issuing from the gallery at the corner entrance to the
courtyard, preceded by their chief singing instructor and accompanied by a number
of women carrying bundles. There had not been time to bring the wardrobe-boxes,
so they had had to make a guess at the three or four plays that Grandmother Jia was
likeliest to want to hear and hurriedly bundle together the costumes that would be
needed for their performance.
Led by the women who had summoned them, Elegante and the rest entered the
heated back room of the hall, made their curtsies to Grandmother Jia and the rest of
the company, and then stood, arms held stiffly at their sides, awaiting instructions.
Grandmother Jia smiled at them benevolently:
‘Doesn’t your teacher give you a holiday even for First Moon? Dear, dear, dear! -
Well now, what are you going to sing for us? We’ve just been listening to The
Orphan’s Revenge which was so noisy that it’s given us all headaches. We’d like to
hear something a bit quieter now. I ought to tell you that we have a very
discriminating audience here tonight. There’s Mrs Xue and Mrs Li here who both
come from families which used to keep their own troupes of players and who have
heard heaven knows how many good performances between them; there are some
young ladies here who know much more than our own girls about plays and music;
and the troupe you saw just now outside, though they are only children, belong to a
famous conn9isseur and are better than many commercial companies of grown-up
players. So if we don’t want to disgrace ourselves, we shall have to be on our best.
Now let’s see. Let’s try to think of something a bit different to show them. Suppose
we get Parfumee to sing “The Dream Recalled” from The Return of the Soul with just
a fiddle to accompany her - leaving out all the woodwind. How would that be for a
start?’
‘Just the thing, Your Old Ladyship,’ said Elegante drily. We’re certainly not good
enough for Mrs Xue and Mrs Li to want to see us in full performance. They just want
an idea of what our diction and voice-production are like.’
‘Quite so,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The two ladies referred to were much diverted by Elegante’s reply.
‘I believe you and Her Old Ladyship are pulling our legs,’ they told her.
‘Not at all,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘These girls are trained only for our own private
amusement, not as an investment. We don’t hire them out, like some people. So
they really aren’t up to commercial standards.’
She turned to Althee, the performer of ‘painted face’ parts:
‘You can do “Hui-ming Takes the Letter” from The Western Chamber. Don’t bother
to make up for it, though. I think those two scenes should be enough to give our
guests some idea of what you can do. Put all you’ve got into it, now, or I shall have
something to say to you!’
The little actresses went out. Those who were to play had soon got into their
costumes and the performance began:
first ‘The Dream Recalled’ and then ‘Taking the Letter’. The audience listened
throughout with rapt attention. When the performance had ended, Aunt Xue
observed that, though she had seen hundreds of different companies in her time, she
had never before heard a performance in which the woodwind in the orchestra was
silent.
‘Oh yes,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Take that “Chu River” aria the heroine sings in The
House in Ping-kang Lane that we were listening to earlier in the evening. Quite often
you can see productions which leave out the woodwind parts in the orchestral
accompaniment. Instead they have the male lead playing a flute accompaniment on
the stage. I agree, a whole sequence with only string accompaniment is unusual, but
there’s nothing very special about it. It depends entirely on the individual preference
of the person who owns the troupe.’
She pointed to Xiang-yun:
‘When I was this child’s age her grandfather had a troupe of young actresses one of
whom was a very good qin-player. She took a number of qin-playing scenes like the
famous one from The Western Chamber and the scene in which Miao-chang plays
the qin in The Jade Hairpin and the “Eighteen Stanzas for the Barbarian Pipe” from
the modern sequel to The Story of the Lute, and arranged them in a single sequence
with qin accompaniment. That was rather impressive. More what-shall-I-say than the
things we have just been listening to.
‘Yes,’ the others agreed, ‘that does sound most unusual.’
Grandmother Jia called the women over and told them that she would now like
Elegante and the others to perform an instrumental piece called Lantern Festival
Moon. The women went out again to transmit her order. Meanwhile Jia Rong and his
wife went round replenishing the winecups.
Xi-feng observed that Grandmother Jia was in very good spirits.
‘While the ballad-singers are still here,’ she said, ‘why don’t we get them to play
“Spring Joy on Every Brow” for us and we can have a game of “Pass the Plum”?’
‘Oh yes, that’s a good game,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Just right for this time of year,
too.’
Orders were given for a pair of drums to be fetched - special ‘drinker’s drums’ whose
black lacquered sides were studded with patterns of brass nails - and handed to the
blind women. Someone produced a flowering spray of red plum for the game.
‘Now,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘whoever’s hand the branch is in when the drumming
stops must first drink a cup of wine and then they have to say something: but what
shall it be?’
‘You can turn your hand to anything, Grannie,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but for those of us who
aren’t so clever it won’t be much fun if it’s something that we’re no good at. I think it
should be something that all of us can enjoy. Why not say that whoever the branch
stops with must tell a joke?’
Everyone present knew that Xi-feng was a wonderful raconteuse with a seemingly
inexhaustible stock of new and funny stories. The servants standing below in
attendance seemed quite as much delighted by this proposal as the members of the
family sitting around the table on the kang, and several little maids went racing off to
inform sisters or cousins outside:
‘Quick, come inside! Mrs Lian is going to tell a joke.’
In no time at all the room was packed with maids.
The actresses had by now finished playing. Grandmother Jia, after first seeing to it
that they were given some soup and a selection of the delicacies available, gave
orders for the drumming to begin.
The blind women were practised performers in this game and deliberately varied the
speed of the beat. Sometimes it would be as slow as the last drips of a water-clock,
sometimes as fast as the rattle of dried beans poured from a bag, sometimes it would
go galloping along like a runaway horse, sometimes it became a soft whisper
interspersed with sudden bursts of sound to make you jump, like flashes of lightning
in the darkness. When the beat was slow, the branch passed slowly from hand to
hand; when it was hurried, the passing too grew faster. Then suddenly it stopped
altogether while Grandmother Jia was holding it. This, in itself, was enough to make
everyone laugh. Jia Rong quickly came round and filled up the old lady’s winecup.
‘Naturally Grandma is the lucky first,’ the others said. ‘You must let us share your
luck, Grandma!’
‘The wine is no problem,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s the joke that’s worrying me.’
‘Come now, your jokes are better even than Feng’s, Grandma,’ they said. ‘Do tell us
one. Make us all laugh.’
‘I don’t know any good new ones,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’ll just have to put a bold
face on it and do the best I can.’
She began her story.
‘In a certain family there were ten sons, all of whom were married, but of the girls
they married only one, the youngest, was intelligent and nimble-witted and a good
talker. The old couple doted on this clever daughter-in-law and day in day out found
fault with the other nine. The other nine naturally resented this and took counsel
together what they should do about it.
“‘At heart we are every bit as dutiful as she is,” they said, “but because the little
wretch is so glib, father-in-law and mother-in-law only care for her. Isn’t there
anything we can do about this injustice?”
‘Then one of the nine had an idea:
“‘Why don’t we go to the temple of Yama, the King of the Underworld, and ask him
why, when our souls first went into human bodies, he gave that little horror a clever
tongue and made all the rest of us so stupid?”
‘The others were delighted with this suggestion, and so next day they all went
trooping off to the temple of King Yama and, after offering up incense, lay down on
the steps of the altar and went to sleep. When they were asleep, the souls of the
nine sisters-in-law waited and waited and waited, but King Yama didn’t come.
‘Presently, just as they were growing desperate, Monkey came bowling along on his
cloud-trapeze, and seeing the nine souls there, lifted up his metal-clasped cudgel to
strike them with. The souls knelt down in terror and begged him to spare them.
Monkey asked them what they were doing there, so they told him their story. When
they had finished, Monkey stamped his foot and sighed sympathetically.
“‘What a good job you met me here and not old Yama,” he said. “He wouldn’t have
been able to help you at all.”
‘The nine souls implored him to tell them what they should do.
“‘Do but have compassion on us, Great Sage,” they said, “and our troubles will be
over.”
“‘It’s quite simple,” said Monkey with a laugh. “The day that the ten of you were
due to enter your human bodies, I happened to have been around at old Yama’s
place and done a little piddle on the floor, and just before she was born, that little
sister-in-law of yours drank it all up. That’s what gave her such a clever tongue. If
clever tongues are all you want, I can do as much piddle for you as you like.”‘
The story ended amidst laughter.
‘It’s a good job all of us are such stupid, tongue-tied creatures,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I
should hate to think that any of us had drunk monkey’s piddle!’
You-shi and Lou-shi turned towards Li Wan, laughing:
‘I wonder who she thinks she’s fooling. It’s very clear which of us in this room is the
one who drank monkey’s piddle!’
‘A joke is always the better for being apt,’ Aunt Xue observed.
While she was speaking, the drumming began again. The maids, who wanted only to
hear Wang Xi-feng tell a joke, had come to a secret understanding with the blind
women that if one of them coughed it would be a signal to stop, and when the
branch had been round twice and had just reached Xi-feng for the second time, the
maids all coughed and the drumming stopped. There was a shout of laughter from all
present.
‘Ha!’ they said. ‘Now we’ve got you! Hurry up with your wine and tell us a good
one - only don’t make us laugh so much that we get stomach-ache!’
Xi-feng thought for a few moments and then started:
‘A family was celebrating the First Moon festival, just as we are doing, admiring the
lanterns and drinking wine together. It was a very lively party and everyone in the
family was there: the grandmother, the great-grandmother, the daughters-in-law, the
granddaughters-in-law, the great?granddaughters-in-law, the grandsons, the
great-nephews,      the    great-grandsons,    the   great-great-grandsons,     the
great-little-medium-grandsons, the granddaughters, the great-nieces, the first
cousins once removed, the first cousins twice removed, the second cousins
two-and-a-half times removed - oh, good?ness gracious me, it was a really lively
party!’
Her audience were already laughing.
‘She’s a caution!’ they said. ‘I wonder which of us she’s got it in for this time.’
‘Don’t you bring me into it,’ said You-shi, laughing: ‘I’ll tear your mouth for you!’
Xi-feng stood up and struck her hands together in mock despair:
‘Here am I going to all this trouble to entertain you and all you do is keep
interrupting. All right then, I won’t go on.’
‘Go on, go on! Take no notice of them!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘What happened
then?’
‘What happened then?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Oh, there they all sat, and after drinking
together all night long, they went to bed.’
She said this straight-faced and in a very matter-of-fact tone of voice. Her audience
waited open-mouthed for her to con?tinue, but nothing was forthcoming, and at last
they realized, with a chill of disappointment, that that was all they were going to hear.
After a long, old-fashioned look from Shi Xiang-yun she relented, however.
‘All right, let me tell you another story about people celebrating the First Moon
festival.
‘Some men were taking an enormous rocket outside the city and a crowd of
thousands had collected behind them to see them let it off. While they were still on
their way, some impatient character who couldn’t bear to wait any longer put a
lighted incense-stick to the touch-paper and lit the fuse. There was a great WHOOSH!
and the rocket went off. Every?one burst out laughing and went off home - all except
the man who had been underneath, carrying the rocket on his back. He just stood
there all on his own, complaining what a rotten job the firework-maker had made of
the rocket. He’d put it together so badly, he said, that all the gunpowder had trickled
away before they’d had a chance to let it off.’
‘But surely he’d have heard it go off?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘He was stone deaf,’ said Xi-feng.
There was a burst of laughter from her audience. But they were still worried about
her earlier story.
‘What about the other one you were telling? What did happen then? You really
ought to finish it, you know.’
‘Oh how you do pester one!’ said Xi-feng, thumping the table in pretended
annoyance. ‘Next day was the sixteenth; the party was over; the festival had ended. If
you ask me, I think they were too busy clearing up and putting things away to know
what had happened then.’
This brought another burst of laughter.
‘That’s two o’clock sounding outside,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’m sure Grannie must be tired.
If you ask me, I think we all ought to be like the deaf man’s firework and “trickle away
You-shi, who in the vehemence of her mirth was rocking back and forth with a
handkerchief stuffed in her mouth, stopped for a moment to point a minatory finger
at Xi-feng:
‘She really is a caution, this one!’
‘She’s a caution all right, and no mistake!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘By the way,
talking of fireworks, why don’t we let ours off now? They will help us to overcome
the effects of all that wine.’
At once Jia Rong jumped up and hurried out. Under his supervision a team of pages
set up a number of framework stands in the courtyard on which fireworks were then
fastened or hung. Though none of them particularly large ones, they were all
imported tribute fireworks of the very highest quality. There were fireworks of all
sorts, including a number of bangers. Dai-yu, being of a nervous disposition, was
terrified of pops and bangs. Knowing this, Grandmother Jia hugged her to her bosom
to comfort her. Aunt Xue offered the same protection to Xiang-yun, but Xiang-yun
laughed and said that she didn’t mind the fireworks.
‘There’s nothing she likes better than letting them off herself,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She’s
not afraid of fireworks!’
Lady Wang hugged Bao-yu.
‘What about me?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Doesn’t anyone love me?’
‘I’ll hold you,’ said You-shi, laughing, ‘ though why you should act the shrinking
young thing now I can’t imagine. Normally when you hear fireworks you get so
excited I’d sooner eat a bee’s turd than stand by and watch you!’
‘Wait until this is over,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We’ll go out in the courtyard and let some off
ourselves. I’m sure I can do it better than these boys.’
While they were speaking, a succession of different sorts of fireworks were going off
outside: golden rain, ‘nine dragon’ rockets, thunderflashes, cloud-hoppers, and many
other sorts. When the display was over, the boy-actors were asked to go up on the
stage again and play the Beggar’s Song, and every?one amused themselves by
throwing money onto the stage and watching them scramble for it.
As hot soup was once more being served, Grandmother Jia remarked that after being
up for so many hours she was beginning to feel rather empty.
‘We have some duck and rice stew ready,’ Xi-feng told her.
‘I think I’d like something a bit lighter than that,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘We’ve got a rice and date frumenty that was made for the ladies who don’t eat
meat,’ said Xi-feng.
‘That will do,’ said Grandmother Jia.
The used things were removed now from the table and another set of dishes
containing all sorts of tempting entremets laid out in their place. When everyone had
sampled what they fancied, they rinsed their mouths out with tea supplied for that
purpose and the party finally broke up.

Early on the morning of the seventeenth the family paid a formal visit to the
Ning-guo mansion to attend the ceremonial closing of the Hall of Ancestors and the
taking down and putting away of the ancestral portraits. Later in that day, when they
were back at Rong-guo House, they attended a New Year reception by Aunt Xue.
There was no question of another Visitation that year. A Dowager Consort, who had
been the late Emperor’s favourite concubine, had fallen seriously ill and the filial
feelings of the reigning Emperor had prompted him to curtail all seasonal festivities
at the Palace. So from Yuan-chun that year there was not so much as a lantern riddle.
There was, however, during the days which followed, a succession of parties or
‘receptions’ given by the senior domestics of the household, to which the family
were, of course, invited: Lai Da’s on the eighteenth, Lai Sheng’s at the Ning-guo
mansion on the nineteenth, Lin Zhi-xiao’s on the twentieth, Widow Shan’s on the
twenty-first and Wu Xin?deng’s on the twenty-second. Grandmother Jia attended
these or not as the fancy took her, sometimes coming at the beginning and staying
until all the other guests had gone, sometimes only putting in a brief appearance
long after her arrival had been despaired of. But she refused absolutely to turn up
when friends or relations were visiting, or to attend the receptions to which they
invited her, leaving Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng to stand in for her on these
occasions. Bao-yu, too - apart from a single duty visit to his uncle Wang Zi-teng’s
house - managed to avoid all social gather?ings by saying that his grandmother
needed him at home to keep her amused.
Then suddenly, when all the festivities were over, an event occurred which filled the
whole household with dismay. Xi-feng had a miscarriage.
For further information on this subject you must turn to the following chapter.

CHAPTER 55

A foolish concubine seeks to humiliate her own daughter
And an ill-natured stewardess tries to outwit
Her young mistress



As we were saying, the First Month festivities in the Rong?guo mansion were scarcely
over when Xi-feng had a miscarriage. Confined for a month to her room by doctor’s
orders and with two or three physicians in daily attendance on her, she was unable to
keep up her usual management of the household’s affairs; yet so confident was she
of her powers of recovery that she continued, in spite of remonstrances, to plan
things from her sick-room, despatching Patience with messages to Lady Wang
whenever she thought of something that needed doing.
Lady Wang for her part was like a woman who has lost a limb. Never at the best of
times an energetic person, she attended to only the most important matters herself
and left most of the routine business to Li Wan. Unfortunately Li Wan, though a
model young woman in some respects, was not a good manager and allowed the
servants to do more or less as they liked. Soon Lady Wang was obliged to call in
Tan-chun as a reinforcement. It would only be for a month, she told them. If they
could bold out for a month, Xi-feng would by then be better and would be able to
take over once more.
But Xi-feng was not as robust as she supposed. Like many young people she had not
been taking proper care of herself, and the excessive demands she had for some time
past been making on her nervous energies had seriously weakened a constitution
that was already far from strong. The miscarriage was in fact only a symptom of her
body’s exhaustion. A month later it was followed by the beginning of a chronic small
dis?charge of blood from the womb. Although she was unwilling to tell anyone about
it, it was apparent to everyone from her gaunt and yellow look that something must
be seriously the matter with her.
Lady Wang insisted that she should make a more serious effort to get better: she
must follow the treatment prescribed for her; above all she must stop worrying
about the household. Xi-feng was herself beginning to be afraid that the trouble
might develop into a major illness which would leave her at the mercy of her
enemies and was now willing to take time off to recuperate. But in spite of her
impatience to get better, the weakness was not to be cured in a day, and it was not
until well into the autumn of that year, after months of slow con?valescence, that her
body recovered its strength and the dis?charge of blood finally dried up.
But we anticipate. Let us return to the time about a month after the miscarriage
when Lady Wang was beginning to realize that her niece was far from better and
could not be expected to relieve Li Wan and Tan-chun of their duties.
Lady Wang was worried about the Garden. There were far too many people in it: she
feared that they were receiving insufficient supervision. Calling Bao-chai to her, she
entrusted her with their surveillance.
‘Those older women are no good,” she told her. ‘They drink and play cards
whenever they have a moment to spare. They sleep in the daytime and play cards at
night, I know they do. When Feng was up and about, there was someone they were
afraid of; but now that she is out of the way, I expect they do just as they please.
Now my dear, I know you are a dependable person. Your cousins are too young for
these matters and I am too busy. Will you please, for my sake, keep your eye on
things for the next week or two? If you come across anything I have missed, point it
out to me. I don’t want Lady Jia asking me about things and finding that I don’t know
the answer. If you see any of the servants misbehaving, let me know. And report
them if they are disobedient. Don’t wait for things to get out of hand before speaking
up about them.’
Bao-chai, whatever she thought of this request, could not very well refuse it.
Spring was now at its height. Dai-yu’s seasonal cough had returned, and in All-spice
Court Shi Xiang-yun lay ill in bed with some epidemic sickness that required constant
medical attention. Li Wan and Tan-chun, though neighbours, were too far apart for
their present circumstances, since servants had to keep going from one place to the
other looking for them, so it was decided that for purposes of household
management they should meet at six o’clock each morning in a little three-frame
reception room on the south side of the Garden gate. They would eat their lunch
there and would be available for seeing people on household business there up to
the end of the morning.
This reception room had originally been intended as a place for the senior eunuchs to
sit at the time of the Visitation. After the Visitation was over there was no further
use for it -in the daytime, at any rate; at night it provided a convenient meeting-place
for the women who made up the watch. Now that the weather was getting warmer,
it did not need a great deal doing to it - beyond moving in one or two pieces of
furniture - to turn it into a comfortable office for the young managers. It had a board
over the doorway bearing the in?scription

SUPPORT BENEVOLENCE PROMOTE VIRTUE

but the servants always referred to it simply as ‘the jobs room’.
Thither, then, at six o’clock each morning the two sisters?-in-law repaired and sat
there until noon while a stream of stewardesses and serving women trooped in and
out reporting on their duties and asking for their instructions.
To begin with, when the servants heard that Li Wan would be managing the
household on her own, all of them were secretly pleased. She was known to be a
kind, easy-going sort of person who disliked giving punishments, and with her in
command they felt sure that it would be much easier than usual to get away with
things. Even the addition of Tan-chun did not materially alter these expectations.
Tan-chun was young and unmarried and, so far as one could judge, a quiet and docile
girl. They foresaw no trouble from that quarter and were, as a consequence, inclined
to take liberties in her presence that they would not have dared to do with Xi-feng.
Within only a few days of her arrival, however, they had begun to sense, from the
way in which she handled one or two of the matters that were brought to her
attention, that though quieter-spoken than Xi-feng and of a much more equable
disposition, she yielded nothing to her in thoroughness.
By coincidence it happened that about this time a dozen or more important events -
promotions, demotions, marriages, deaths and the like - occurred in rapid succession
among the group of aristocratic and official families connected by matrimonial or
other ties with the Ning-guo and Rong-guo Jias, and for days on end Lady Wang’s
time was taken up with visits of condolence or felicitation. Some responsible person
was needed to stand in for her while she was away; so while Li Wan and Tan-chun
spent all their mornings in the office, Bao-chai spent hers in Lady Wang’s apartment,
only leaving it when her aunt got home from her visiting. At night the three young
guardians spent whatever time could be spared from their sewing patrolling the
Garden in sedans, escorted by the old women of the watch. Working together in this
way they soon came to feel that they had evolved a system of supervision more
careful even than Xi-feng’s - a view amply borne out by the grumbles of the
domestics themselves:
‘No sooner is the Terror of the Seas put out of action than along come these three
Scourges of the Mountains to take her place. Nowadays you can’t even take time off
for a quiet drink of a night or a little game of cards!’
A day came when Lady Wang was due to attend a luncheon at the Marquis of
Jin-xiang’s. Li Wan and Tan-chun, after an early toilet, had attended her to the gate
and seen her off. They had just got back to their office and were enjoying a morning
cup of tea when Wu Xin-deng’s wife came in to report:
‘Mrs Zhao’s brother, Zhao Guo-ji, died yesterday. I told Her Ladyship and she said I
was to report it to you.
Having delivered this brief communiqué’, she stood in silence, her arms held stiffly at
her sides, waiting for a reply. A number of stewardesses who were waiting their turn
to report, pricked up their ears at this mention of Tan-chun’s natural mother and
waited with interest to see what the two young deputies would decide. If their
decision was a good one, they would in future treat them with respect; but if it was
one in which there was the slightest possibility of picking holes, not only would they
not respect them, but afterwards, when they got back outside, they would have
many a good laugh at their expense.
The behaviour of Wu Xin-deng’s wife on this occasion was quite deliberate. If it had
been Xi-feng that she was reporting to, she would have demonstrated her efficiency
by making one or two helpful suggestions, having armed herself beforehand with
some precedents for Xi-feng to choose from; but as it was only Li Wan and Tan-chun,
one of whom she despised for her softness and the other for her youth, she merely
stated her business and left them to flounder unaided.
Tan-chun turned questioningly to Li Wan.
‘When Aroma’s mother died recently, didn’t they give her forty taels?’ said Li Wan
after thinking for a bit. ‘I suppose we’d better give her forty taels.’
‘Yes ma’am,’ said Wu Xin-deng’s wife, and taking up a tally, went hurrying off to
collect the money.
‘Just a minute!’ Tan-chun called out after her.
Wu xinLdeng’s wife returned - a trifle reluctantly it could be observed.
‘Don’t collect that money yet,’ said Tan-chun. ‘There’s something I want to ask you.
Of the old women in Lady Jia’s apartment who used to be chamber-wives when my
grandfather was alive, some must have been home-reared and some must have been
bought outside. There’s a different scale for the two kinds, isn’t there? How much do
the home-reared ones get when someone in their family dies and how much do the
ones from outside get? Give us one or two examples so that we have something to
go on.’
Not having prepared herself for such a question, Wu Xin?deng’s wife was unable to
answer it. She covered up for herself, all smiles:
‘It’s not a very important matter. Just give what you think. No one’s going to
question your decision.’
Tan-chun smiled back:
‘Now you are talking nonsense. Suppose I said, “Give her a hundred taels”? No, we
have to give what is right: otherwise, quite apart from the fact that you will all laugh
at us, how am I going to face Mrs Lian when I next see her?’
‘Very good then, I’ll go and look up the old accounts,’ said Wu Xin-deng’s wife. ‘I
can’t at the moment remember.’
‘You’ve been working here all these years and you can’t remember?’ said Tan-chun.
‘I think you are trying to make things difficult for us. I can’t believe that you have to
go off and look things up when Mrs Lian asks you a question. If you do, all I can say
is that she is not such a strict mistress as she is supposed to be: in fact, I should say
that she was a rather indulgent one. All right, hurry up and fetch the accounts then!
If this matter is delayed, it isn’t your negligence that will be blamed but our
incompetence.’
Blushing to the roots of her hair, Wu Xin-deng’s wife hurried off to do as she was
bidden. The other women gasped and stuck their tongues out in surprise. Reporting
on other matters continued in her absence.
After a little while she returned with the account-books. On examination Tan-chun
found two instances of home-reared concubines receiving twenty taels and two of
‘outsiders’ receiving forty taels. She also found an instance of an outsider receiving a
hundred taels and one of an outsider receiving sixty; but in each case a note
explaining special circumstances had been made against the entry: in the first case
the body of a parent had had to be conveyed in its coffin for interment in another
province and the extra sixty taels was to cover the cost of transport; in the second
case the extra twenty taels was for the purchase of a plot of ground for burial.
Tan-chun handed Li Wan the relevant account to look at, while at the same time
informing Wu Xin-deng’s wife of her decision:
‘Give her twenty taels. And leave these accounts with us, so that we can have a
good look at them.’
Wu Xin-deng’s wife went off once more.
The next thing that happened was that Aunt Zhao came stalking in. Li Wan and
Tan-chun invited her to be seated, but Aunt Zhao was in no mood for polite
preliminaries.
‘Everyone in this family tramples on me,’ she said, address?ing herself to Tan-chun.
‘Don’t you think that you at least might stick up for me?’
She began crying messily, the abundant moisture seeming to come as much from her
nostrils as from her eyes.
‘Who are you complaining about?’ said Tan-chun. ‘I really don’t understand you.
Who’s been trampling on you? If you would tell me, perhaps I might be able to “stick
up” for you.’
‘You have, for a start,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘That doesn’t leave me anyone to turn to,
does it?’
Tan-chun leaped to her feet:
‘I shouldn’t dream of trampling on you.’
Li Wan, too, stood up and made some soothing remark or other. But Aunt Zhao was
not to be placated:
‘Sit down both of you, and listen to me. I’ve given the best years of my life to this
family - years and years and years. I’ve borne two children for them, you and your
brother. And now, after all that, I’m not even to be treated as well as Aroma. What
sort of face does that leave me with? What sort of face does it leave you with - never
mind me?’
Tan-chun laughed mirthlessly:
‘Oh that’s what this is about! The simple answer to that is that I have to follow the
rules.’
She sat down again, opened up the account-book and, holding it out for Aunt Zhao to
see, read the relevant entries out to her.
‘These regulations were laid down by the ancestors for everyone to follow. I can’t
suddenly go altering them. It isn’t just Aroma. It will be exactly the same if one day
Huan has a chamber-wife from outside. If someone in her family dies, then, as an
outsider, she will get exactly the same amount as Aroma did. It has nothing to do
with who is more important than whom. It isn’t a matter of prestige at all. Zhao
Guo-ji was Lady Wang’s bondservant. That means that he belongs to the
“home-reared” class. The rules lay down a certain scale of payments for that class.
All I have done is to follow the rules. I am sure that Zhao Guo-ji must approve and be
grateful to the ancestors and Lady Wang for their generosity. If he doesn’t - if he
thinks he is being unfairly treated - then all I can say is that he is stupid and
ungrateful and one can’t really care very much what he thinks. As regards face, it
makes no difference to me whether Lady Wang gives him everything she’s got or
nothing at all. And I really do think that while she is away you might try to compose
yourself a bit and not go working yourself up into such a state. Although Lady Wang
is so good to me, I am constantly worried that you will spoil everything with your
perpetual trouble-making. If I’d been a boy I should have left home long ago and
done some?thing to show myself worthy of her kindness; but as I am a girl, I have to
stay at home and never say a word out of turn. I believe she realizes this, and
because she thinks highly of me she has entrusted me with this managing job as a
means of proving myself. But before I have had a chance to do anything, you have to
come along and start making things diffi?cult for me. If Lady Wang gets to hear of it,
she will probably conclude that the job is too hard for me and take it away again.
That would be a real loss of face - for you as well as for me.’
Tan-chun’s shoulders began to shake as she said this and she ended up by bursting
into tears.
Aunt Zhao did not really have an answer to what Tan-chun had said, so she tried
another tack.
‘If Lady Wang is so fond of you, you ought to use your position to give us a helping
hand. The fact is, though, you are so anxious to keep in her good books that you
forget about us altogether.’
‘Of course I don’t forget about you,’ said Tan-chun. ‘But what do you mean by
giving you a “helping hand”? A good mistress will always be favourable to those who
try hard and make themselves useful, and a good servant doesn’t need any “helping
hand” in order to keep in her favour.’
Li Wan hovered between them, still trying to act the peace maker:
‘Please don’t be angry, Mrs Zhao. You mustn’t blame Tan?chun. I’m sure she’s most
anxious to give you all the help she can; but you could hardly expect her to say so.’
‘Don’t talk such stuff, Wan!’ said Tan-chun impatiently. ‘Help whom, for goodness
sake? Whoever heard of the young mistress in a family helping the servants? Their
private interests are no concern of mine, as you perfectly well know.’
‘We’re not talking about “servants”, we’re talking about me,’ said Aunt Zhao angrily.
‘If you hadn’t been in charge now, I’d never have asked you. At this particular
moment you happen to be in charge here. Very well. Your mother’s brother has just
died. If you decide to give an extra twenty or thirty taels towards his funeral, Her
Ladyship isn’t going to stop you, is she? Of course she isn’t. We all know what a good,
kind person Her Ladyship is. It’s mean, tight-fisted people like you interfering that
stop her being generous. I simply don’t know what you’re worried about. It isn’t your
money you’re spending. I’d been hoping that one of these days when you grew up
and got married you’d be able to do our Zhao family a bit of good. But not you!
You’re in such a hurry to find a higher branch to perch on, you’ve forgotten the nest
even before your feathers are full-grown!’
Tan-chun went white, and for a moment anger deprived her of her breath. When she
regained it she broke into louder sobs.
‘Who is this “mother’s brother”? The only mother’s brother I know about is the
one who has just been appointed Inspector-General of Armies in the Nine Provinces.
I’m sure I always try to show respect where it is due, but no one ever told me that I
ought to think of Zhao Guo-ji as my uncle. If so, how is it that he always stood up for
Huan and walked behind him on his way to school in the mornings? Why didn’t he
insist on being treated as an uncle by Huan? But what’s the point? Everyone knows it
was you who bore me. Two or three months never go by without your making a
scene about something or other just to give yourself an opportunity of proclaiming
the fact. And you talk about face! It’s a good job I understand your little game. If I
were a simple-minded person and not very sure of my position, it would have driven
me distracted long ago.’
The ever more agitated attempts at peace-making by Li Wan and continuing gabble
of complaint from Aunt Zhao which followed this outburst were suddenly interrupted
by a call from the women outside:
‘Here’s Miss Patience with a message from Mrs Lian.’
At once Aunt Zhao fell silent. She advanced fawningly on Patience as she entered:
‘Is your mistress any better, Patience? I’ve been meaning to go round and see her,
but I just haven’t had the time.’
Li Wan asked Patience what she had come for.
‘Mrs Lian heard that Mrs Zhao’s brother had died and she was afraid you might not
know what to give. She said according to the rule it should be twenty taels, but in
this particular case Miss Tan should feel free to add on a bit if she sees fit.’
‘Oh? On what grounds, I wonder?’ said Tan-chun, who had by this time wiped the
traces of tears from her face. ‘I’m not aware that there was anything very special
about this person. His mother didn’t carry him for twenty-four months before he was
born. He didn’t rescue his master on the battle?field from under a heap of corpses
and carry him to safety on his back. It is very ingenious of your mistress, getting me
to break the rules so that she can take the credit for being generous, but if she
wishes to play the Lady Bountiful by giving away other people’s money, I’m afraid she
will have to wait. Tell her that I absolutely refuse to take responsibility for any change
in the rules. If she wants to make a change, let her wait until she is better. Then she
can add on as much as she likes!’
Patience had already had a rough idea of the situation when she arrived and by the
time Tan-chun finished speaking she had sized it up completely. Observing the anger
in Tan-chun’s face, she did not presume to reply in the joking, light-hearted manner
she would normally have adopted with her, but stood in silence, with her arms held
submissively at her sides.
It was now about the time when Bao-chai usually came over from Lady Wang’s
apartment for discussion. Tan-chun and Li Wan stood up to greet her as she entered
and invited her to sit with them. Before they had a chance to begin talking, however,
one of the women who had been waiting outside came in to make her report.
Because Tan-chun had recently been crying, three or four maids had already been to
fetch water and towels and a hand-mirror so that she could wash her face. As she
was at this moment sitting cross-legged on a low wooden couch, the maid carrying
the hand-basin went down on both her knees to bring it to a convenient level for her,
whereupon the girls bearing the towels, hand-mirror, cosmetics and so forth also
knelt down on either side. Seeing that Tan-chun’s body-servant Scribe was not
present, Patience hurriedly stepped forward, rolled back Tan-chun’s sleeves for her,
removed her bracelets and tucked a large towel round her neck to protect the front
of her dress. As Tan-chun stretched out her hands to begin washing, the woman who
had just entered began to make her report:
‘Excuse me Mrs Zhu; excuse me Miss Tan. The school want to draw this year’s
allowance for Master Huan and Master Lan.’
‘What’s the hurry?’ snapped Patience. ‘Haven’t you got eyes in your head? Can’t
you see that Miss Tan is washing? You ought to be waiting outside. What do you
mean by bursting in like this? Would you behave like this if Mrs Lian were here? Miss
Tan is a kind young lady and lets you get away with it, but if I tell Mrs Lian when I get
back how little respect you show her, you’ll be in serious trouble - and don’t say I
didn’t warn you!’
Thoroughly alarmed, the woman put on her broadest smile and retreated,
apologizing, from the room.
Tan-chun, who had finished washing and was now making up her face, looked up at
Patience with a sardonic smile:
‘It’s a pity you didn’t come a bit earlier. You missed the best part of the comedy. Wu
xin-deng’s wife, who has spent a whole lifetime in service, came here without having
bothered to look up the records, in the hope of making us look foolish. Fortunately I
thought to ask her what the rule was; but then she had the effrontery to tell me that
she had forgotten. I told her that I didn’t think she would forget things and have to go
off and look them up if it was your mistress that she was dealing with.’
‘I should think not, indeed!’ said Patience. ‘If she had ever tried a trick like that on
Mrs Lian, she’d have some nasty scars on her backside to show for it, I can tell you!
Don’t you believe any of them, miss! They think that because Mrs Zhu is such a kind,
saintly person and you are such a quiet, shy young lady they can get away with
anything.’
She turned to address the women who were standing outside the door:
‘Keep it up all of you! Just carry on with these little tricks! See what happens to you
when Mrs Lian is better!’
‘Now, now, you know us better than that, miss!’ said the women, laughing. “‘Let
him face the summons that did the offence”. We wouldn’t pull the wool over a young
mistress’s eyes. We know perfectly well that if a young unmarried lady like Miss Tan
was to get really angry with us, it would be more than our lives was worth.’
‘Well, as long as you know, that’s all tight,’ said Patience drily. She turned back to
Tan-chun. ‘I’m sure you must realize, miss: Mrs Lian is much too busy to think of
everything and there must be quite a few things that she’s over?1ooked, They say
“the bystander sees all”, and during the years that you’ve been quietly looking on as
a bystander you may have noticed cases in which more or perhaps less ought to be
given that Mrs Lian herself has never got around to dealing with. If you were to take
this opportunity of putting them right, you’d be doing Her Ladyship a good turn and
at the same time it would be a kindness to my mistress which I’m sure she would
appreciate.’
Before she bad finished, Bao-chai and Li Wan were both laughing.
‘Patience, you’re wonderful! No wonder Feng is so devoted to you. The way you’ve
just put it, you make us feel that even if there are no grounds for altering the rules,
we ought to try and find some, just so as not to disappoint you!’
Tan-chun joined in their laughter:
‘I still feel very angry. Until she came along, I was hoping to work some of it off on
her mistress, but she’s been so reasonable about it all that I hardly know what to do!’
She called in the woman whom Patience had chased out a few minutes earlier.
‘What are these allowances for Master Huan and Master Lan that the school is
asking for?’
‘Eight taels each a year, miss. It’s for paper, writing-brushes and refreshments.’
‘But these expenses are already provided for in the monthly allowances,’ said
Tan-chun. ‘Mrs Zhao gets two taels a month for Huan, Aroma gets two a month for
Bao-yu from Her Ladyship, and Lan’s expenses are covered by Mrs Zhu’s allowance.
Why should we pay an additional eight taels for each of them to the school? Is that
what they go to school for, to collect the money? I think we should cancel that
payment from now on. Patience, go back and tell your mistress: I insist that these
payments should be discontinued.’
‘They should have been long ago,’ said Patience. ‘Mrs Lian had decided to stop
them last year, but with so much going on over the New Year, she forgot about it.’
The woman who had come for the allowances had to go off empty-handed.
Women from Prospect Garden now arrived carrying food-boxes containing Li Wan’s
and Tan-chun’s lunch. They were preceded by the maids Scribe and Candida who
carried a little table between them which they put down in front of their mistresses.
Patience busied herself by taking dishes from the food-boxes and putting them on
the table; but Tan-chun stopped her:
‘If you have nothing more to say, you had better be about your own business. There
is nothing for you to do here.’
‘I haven’t got any other business,’ said Patience, smiling. ‘That’s why Mrs Lian sent
me here. Partly it was to bring you the message, but partly it was because she was
afraid the servants here might be giving you trouble and she thought I might be able
to make myself useful.’
‘Why hasn’t Miss Bao’s lunch been brought here so that she can eat with us?’
Tan-chun inquired.
At once one of the maids went outside and gave an order to the women who were
waiting there under the eaves:
‘Miss Bao’s going to have her lunch here with the other young ladies. Tell them to
bring it here.’
The raised voice of Tan-chun, who had overheard her, issued from behind her in
reproof:
‘Who are you ordering about like that? Those are stewardesses out there and
senior members of the domestic staff. You can’t make them run to and fro fetching
and carrying things for you. Have you no respect for seniority? Patience is standing
around here with nothing to do: why don’t you get her to go?’
Not waiting to be ordered, Patience murmured something and hurried out; but the
women outside silently waylaid her and with broad smiles prevented her from going.
‘We can’t let you go, miss: that would never do! In any case, we’ve already sent
someone.’
They dusted the steps with their handkerchiefs and invited her to sit down:
‘There you are, miss, sit there in the sun and rest yourself. You must be tired after
standing about for so long.’
Patience was about to sit down when two women from the tea-kitchen rushed up to
her with a rug:
‘That stone’s too cold to sit on. Here’s a nice clean rug. You sit on this, miss.’
Patience smiled and nodded:
‘Thank you very much.’
Another woman came out carrying a cup of tea for her on a tray.
‘Here you are, miss,’ she whispered. ‘This isn’t the tea we usually drink. This is the
kind we make for the mistresses. Try some of that for a change.’
Patience bowed and took the cup, then, shaking a reproving finger at the women,
she admonished them in a voice that she kept low so as not to be audible inside:
‘You’ve gone too far this time and no mistake! Miss Tan is a real little lady, but just
because she is too well-bred to throw her weight about, it doesn’t mean that you can
afford to take advantage of her. On the contrary, you ought to respect her all the
more for it. If she were ever to get really angry, my word you would be in trouble! It
wouldn’t just be a question of saying “sorry” then. If she took it into her head to
throw a tantrum, even Her Ladyship would have to give in to her. Mrs Lian certainly
wouldn’t stand in her way, she wouldn’t dare. So just what makes you so bold against
her I do not know. You might just as well pelt a rock with eggs as set yourselves up
against her!’
‘We wouldn’t dare set ourselves up against her,’ said the women. ‘This was all Mrs
Zhao’s doing.’
‘Oh, come on now!’ said Patience, still speaking in a half?whisper. ‘Everyone likes to
push a falling wall. We all know that Mrs Zhao isn’t the most sensible of mortals. She
doesn’t know whether she’s coming or going half the time. It’s just a bit too easy to
blame it all on her when things go wrong. Do you think after all the years I’ve been
here I don’t know how unmanageable and how ruthless you can be? If Mrs Lian were
just a shade less determined, she’d have been finished off by you lot years ago. As it
is, you only need half a chance to start making things difficult for her. Many and
many’s the time she’s nearly come unstuck because of your whispering. Everyone’s
always saying what a holy terror she is and how you’re all afraid of her. I’m probably
the only one who realizes that in her heart of hearts she’s actually afraid of you. As a
matter of fact she and I were talking about this only the other day. We both agreed
that if you didn’t make yourselves a bit more accommodating, there were sure to be
one or two explosions. Miss Tan may be only a young girl, but you’re completely
mistaken in treating her like this. Even Mrs Lian is a tiny bit scared of Miss Tan. Of all
the young ladies in this household Miss Tan is the only one she feels that way about.
And yet you think you can do what you like with her!’
Just then Ripple approached and the women all crowded round to greet her.
‘Better stay outside with us for a bit, miss,’ they said. ‘They’ve just laid for lunch
inside. Better wait until they take the table away before going in to report anything.’
‘I’m not like you,’ said Ripple loftily. ‘I can’t wait.’
She began mounting the steps.
‘Come back at once!’ Patience called after her.
Ripple looked back and saw that it was Patience.
‘Oh, what are you doing here? Sentry duty?’
She came down again then and sat beside Patience on the rug.
‘What have you come about?’ Patience asked her in a low voice.
‘I want to ask about Bao-yu’s and our allowances for this month. We’ve been
wondering when we’re going to get them.’
‘Oh that!’ said Patience. ‘That’s not very important. Go back and tell Aroma this -
say I told you to tell her: no matter what it is, don’t come here asking for anything
today. Anything you ask for will be refused. If you ask for a hundred things, one after
the other, the answer will be “no” every time.’
‘Why’s that?’ said Ripple.
Patience and the women explained, pointing out that to go in and ask for something
on Bao-yu’s behalf at the very moment when Tan-chun was looking around for
someone of consequence to make an example of would be simply courting disaster.
‘There’s no sense in your going in now,’ said Patience. ‘Either way it will be
awkward. If they make an example of Bao-yu they will risk offending Their Ladyships;
if they don’t make an example of him You Know Who will call it favouritism and
complain that they daren’t provoke anyone who has Their Ladyships behind them
and only take it out on the weak ones who can’t protect themselves. You wait and
see: they’ll even turn down one or two requests from Mrs Lian before they’ve
finished, just to stop certain people talking.’
Ripple stuck her tongue out in a grimace.
‘It’s a good job I met you here. I should only have got smut on my nose if I’d gone
inside. I’d better go back straight away then and tell the others.’
She rose and went away.
Presently Bao-chai’s lunch arrived and Patience went inside again to help serve it. By
this time Aunt Zhao had already left. The three young women sat cross-legged on the
wooden settle around the low lunch-table which had been placed upon it, Bao-chai
facing south, towards the doorway, Tan-chun facing west and Li Wan facing east. Only
their personal maids stayed inside the room to serve them; no one else dared enter.
The women waited quietly on the verandah outside, dis?cussing the situation in
whispers:
‘Better keep out of trouble from now on. Better not try any more funny business.
Look what happened to Mrs Wu, and she’s ever so much senior to us!’
    Their whispered conversation continued intermittently until lunch was over. They
knew it was over when the sound of chopsticks on bowls and dishes ceased and only
an occasional low cough could be heard from inside. Presently a maid appeared in
the doorway and held the portiere up high to let two other maids through who were
carrying out the lunch-table. Another three maids with wash-basins were already
waiting outside who went in as soon as the other two had finished carrying out the
table. Soon they too came out again, each carrying a wash-basin as before and also a
spittoon. Then Scribe, Candida and Oriole arrived, each with a covered teacup on a
tray, and went in. A little later this last trio reemerged. As they did so, Scribe stopped
for a moment to admonish the junior maids who were remaining behind:
‘Now do your job properly. We’ll be back to relieve you as soon as we’ve had our
lunch. No sneaking off to sit down while we’re away!’
The departure of Scribe and the other two was a signal for the women outside to
begin going in, one by one, to report on their various business. They did this sedately
enough, with none of the careless insolence they had been showing previously.
Tan-chun’s customary good nature gradually reasserted itself and presently she
turned to Patience and addressed her in a normal tone of voice:
‘There’s an important matter that I have been wanting to consult your mistress
about. I’m glad I’ve remembered it now. Come back again as soon as you have
finished your lunch, while Miss Bao is still here, and the four of us can discuss it
together; then, when we’ve worked out all the details, we can ask your mistress
whether to go forward with it or not.’
‘Yes, miss,’ said Patience, and promptly left.
When she got back, Xi-feng asked her why she had been so long and received a full
account of what had happened which greatly entertained her.
‘Good! Good!’ she said. ‘Good for Tan-chun! I always said she’d make an excellent
little manager. Oh, what a pity she wasn’t born in the right bed I’
‘Now you’re talking stupid, madam,’ said Patience. ‘Although she’s not Her
Ladyship’s child by birth, surely no one is going to think any the worse of her because
of that? Won’t she always be treated exactly the same as the rest?’
Xi-feng sighed:
‘I’m afraid it’s not quite as simple as you think. I know being a wife’s or a
concubine’s child is not supposed to make any difference, and in a boy’s case perhaps
it doesn’t; but I’m afraid with girls, when the time comes to start finding husbands
for them, it often does. Nowadays you get a very shallow class of person who will ask
about that before anything else and often, if they hear that the girl is a concubine’s
child, will have nothing further to do with her. It’s silly, really, because if they did but
know it, even the maids in a household like ours are better than the wife’s daughters
in many another household, let alone the daughters of concu?bines. In the case of
girls like Tan-chun and Ying-chun it’s hard to say. They might be unlucky and make a
bad match through being discriminated against, or then again they might be lucky:
someone might come along who didn’t care about these distinctions and they might
make a perfectly good marriage.’
Xi-feng paused for a moment and smiled at Patience confidingly:
‘Because of all the economies I’ve introduced during these last few years there’s
hardly anyone in this household who doesn’t secretly hate me. But it’s like riding a
tiger: I daren’t relax my grip for a single moment for fear of being eaten. In any case,
our expenditure is still far above our income. The trouble is, everything in this
household from the largest down to the smallest item has to be done on a scale and
according to rules that were laid down by our ancestors; but unfortu?nately the
income from our property is not what it was in their days. If we do economize, the
family looks ridiculous, Their Ladyships feel uncomfortable, and the servants
com?plain of our harshness; yet if we don’t economize, in a very few years’ time we
shall be bankrupt.’
‘I know;’ said Patience. ‘And there are three or four young ladies and two or three
young masters to provide for, and Her Old Ladyship: all these big expenses are yet to
come.’
‘Ah, I’ve allowed for them,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Those expenses I think we can just about
manage. Bao-yu’s bride-price and Miss Lin’s dowry won’t involve us in any expense
because Her Old Ladyship will pay them Out of her private savings and Miss Ying will
be taken care of by Sir She. Of the girls, that only leaves Miss Tan and Miss Xi. They’re
not going to cost more than seven or eight thousand each at the outside. Then
there’s Huan: they’re not going to spend all that much on him: say three thousand.
Even if we can’t raise all of that, we can probably get by with a little judicious pruning.
As for Her Old Ladyship: the main things have been paid for already; there will only
be various miscellaneous expenses. Four or five thousand will probably be ample. No,
as long as we can economize a bit, we shall be able to deal with those expenses as
they come along. What really worries me is the possibility of one or two large items
of expenditure turning up which we hadn’t been expecting. Then I am afraid we
really shall be done for!
‘But let’s not worry about these far-off things just now. You must hurry up and have
your lunch so that you can get back and find out what it is they want to talk about.
I’m delighted that things should be turning out in this way. It’s what I’ve. always
wanted, someone to take a bit of the weight off my shoulders. There’s Bao-yu of
course; but he isn’t really one of us, so even if I were to win him over, he wouldn’t be
very much use. Mrs Zhu is such a Holy Buddha, she’s no good. Miss Ying’s even worse
- and anyway she doesn’t properly belong to this household. Miss Xi is still childish.
Lan is little more than a baby. Huan is like a singed cat in the cold, only looking for a
warm stove or a corner of a kang to curl up on - How the same mother could produce
two children such poles apart as him and Tan-chun I never shall under?stand I - Miss
Lin and Miss Bao are both very capable girls, but unfortunately they’re not of our
surname and can’t very well be expected to involve themselves in running our affairs.
And in any case, one of them’s like a beautiful picture-lantern: you feel that a puff of
wind would blow her out; and the other is so determined not to open her mouth
about what doesn’t concern her that a shake or a nod or an “I don’t know” is about
all you can ever get out of her and you feel a bit awk?ward about asking her to do
anything. And that only leaves Miss Tan. She’s got a good mind; she’s good at
expressing herself; she belongs to the right lineage; Her Ladyship likes her; she’s a bit
unsure of herself perhaps, but that’s all the doing of that wretched Zhao woman; in
other respects she’s very much like Bao-yu. She’s certainly not in the least like Huan.
He really is the most objectionable child. If I had my way he’d have been sent packing
long ago. No, if she’s got the determination to do this job, let’s go along with her, I
say. Let’s make an ally of her, so that I don’t have to go on feeling so isolated. From a
high-minded, honourable point of view, having her to help us will save us a good deal
of anxiety, and in the long run Her Ladyship will benefit. But there is also a not so
high-minded, rather more selfish way of looking at it. I’ve been too ruthless, I know I
have. I ought to step back now and take stock of things. I can’t keep the pres?sure up
any longer. People hate me so much already, there are daggers in their smiles. You
and I have only two pairs of eyes between us. If I carry on as I have been doing,
sooner or later they are bound to catch us off our guard and I shall be destroyed. So
you see, her stepping forward and taking command just when things are at their
liveliest means that the heat will be turned off me for the time being and people’s
resentment against me will have a chance to cool down.
There’s something else I want to say to you. I know you are a very intelligent person,
but I am afraid you may find it rather hard to transfer your allegiance, so I want to
impress this on you now. Although Miss Tan may be only a girl, there are very few
things that she doesn’t know about. You mustn’t be taken in by her quiet manner. In
fact, being able to read and write, she’s if anything better equipped to manage things
than I am. Now they always say that anyone who wants to break a gang up should
begin by arresting the leader, and her immediate concern must be to make an
example of someone as a means of establishing her authority. That being so, you can
be quite sure that I shall be the person she’ll pick on first to make an example of. If
she starts criticizing anything I have said or done, don’t try to defend it; just be very
polite and say that the criticism is justified. Don’t, whatever you do, stand up to her
out of a mistaken sense of loyalty to me: that’s the last thing I want you to do.’
Before she could go on, Patience laughingly interrupted her:
‘Why are you so ready to assume that other people are stupid? I’ve been taking
that line with her already; I don’t need you to tell me!’
‘I was afraid you might have no time for anyone but me,’ said Xi-feng. That was my
only reason for warning you. If you have been taking that line with her already, so
much the better. Evidently you are cleverer than I am. By the way, aren’t you perhaps
getting a little carried away - this “you”, “you”, “you” all of a sudden? What’s wrong
with “madam”?’
‘I’ll say “you” if I want to,’ said Patience. ‘If you don’t like it, there’s always my face
to slap. It won’t be the first time it’s enjoyed that privilege!’
‘Little beast!’ said Xi-feng. ‘How many times do you intend to go on dragging that
up? Fancy provoking me with a thing like that when you know how ill I am! Come on!
There aren’t any visitors about. Come over and sit here with me. We’d better get on
with our lunch.’
Felicity and three or four junior maids came in at this point carrying a short-legged
table between them which they set down on the kang. Xi-feng’s lunch consisted of no
more than some bird’s nest soup and a couple of small, light dishes suitable for an
invalid palate. Unable to eat more, she had cancelled the portion that under normal
catering arrangements would have been her due. Felicity put the four dishes to
which Patience was entitled on Xi-feng’s table and filled her a bowlful of rice.
Patience then half sat, half stood with one foot curled underneath her on the edge of
the kang and the other one resting on the floor, and in that position kept Xi-feng
company while she ate her lunch. When they had both finished eating, she helped
Xi-feng to wash and rinse Out her mouth, then, after a few admonitory words to
Felicity, went back to rejoin Tan-chun and the others in the office.
Outside the office building the forecourt was quiet and deserted. The stewardesses
who had formerly been waiting there had now all gone off about their business.
What happened when she went inside will be related in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 56

Resourceful Tan-chun abolishes abuses
in the interests of economy
And sapient Bao-chai shows how small concessions
can be made without loss of dignity
Having kept Xi-feng company while she ate her lunch and waited on her while she
rinsed her mouth out and washed, Patience made her way back to the lobs room’.
The courtyard outside it was quiet now, deserted except for the silent row of maids
and womenservants waiting outside the windows until their mistresses inside the
room should require them. The latter were already in the midst of a discussion. They
were talking about Lai Da’s garden, which they had visited in Grandmother Jia’s
company some months previously on the occasion of the party which had had such
unfortunate consequences for Xue Pan. Tan-chun broke off as Patience entered and
indicated a low stool for her to sit on.
   ‘I’ve been thinking about those two taels we get every month for hair-oil and
cosmetics,’ she told Patience. ‘We already get a monthly allowance of two taels each
and our maids get allowances too. It looks to me as if this is another case of
duplication, like the eight taels paid to the school every year which we were dealing
with earlier. I know it’s not a very important matter, and the sum involved is not very
great, but it’s obvious at a glance that this is a bad arrangement, and I can’t
understand why your mistress hasn’t noticed it.’
   ‘There is a reason,’ said Patience. ‘Obviously you young ladies need a regular fixed
supply of these things, and as there wouldn’t be much sense in our constantly
running out with a few coppers to make individual purchases, the cosmetic
allowances for the various departments are drawn by our buyers and used to make
bulk purchases with. The stewardesses collect monthly supplies from the buyers and
distribute them to the different apartments, and we maids in the different
apartments look after them for use by you as and when you need them. The two-tael
monthly allowance you get is quite separate from the cosmetics money. It isn’t
meant to be spent on cosmetics; it’s simply to keep you in money, so that if the need
should ever arise to spend on something, you shouldn’t have the inconvenience of
finding yourselves short and perhaps running round for some only to find that Her
Ladyship or whoever is in charge at the time is out or too busy to see you. I have to
admit though that about half of us do in fact seem to go outside these arrangements
and buy cosmetics with our spending money; but whether it’s because the official
buyers simply pocket the money and don’t deliver the goods, or because the stuff
they supply us with is so inferior, I simply don’t know.’
   Tan-chun and Li Wan exchanged knowing smiles.
   ‘You’ve noticed, too, then,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I don’t think they actually embezzle the
money, but sometimes the supply is very much delayed. If you try to hurry them they
produce something so awful that it is quite unusable, and in the end you are forced
to buy your own. There’s only one way of doing that, too. You have to give a couple
of taels to a nannie and ask her to get one of her sons or nephews to buy it for you.
It’s no good trying to do it through the regular staff. If you do, you only get the same
awful, unusable stuff as before, I don’t know why.’
   ‘It’s because if they bought you stuff of better quality, they’d be in trouble with the
regular buyers,’ said Patience. ‘The regular buyers would complain that they were
trying to do them out of a job. They’d rather offend you than risk offending the
buyers. Of course, if you get the stuff through your nannies, there’s nothing the
buyers can do about it’
   ‘Well, I am very uneasy about the whole arrangement,’ said Tan-chun. ‘Here we
are paying the same money twice over and half the stuff that is paid for has to be
wasted. It would be much better if this monthly payment to the buyers were
abolished altogether. That’s one thing. Another thing is this. Last year when we went
to Lai Da’s place, you went too. What did you think of that little garden of theirs?
How do you think it compares with ours?’
   ‘It’s not half as big,’ said Patience, ‘and it has far, far fewer trees and flowers and
things in it.
   ‘I got talking to one of the daughters while we were there,’ said Tan-chun. ‘That
garden of theirs is let out annually on contract. She told me that quite apart from
supplying them through the year with flowers for their hair and with all the
bamboo-shoots, vegetables and fish that they eat, it brings them in an annual
income of two hundred taels of silver. Ever since that day I have realized that even a
broken lotus-leaf or a withered grass-root is worth something.’
   Bao-chai laughed.
   ‘There speaks the voice of gilded youth. How typical! But even though, O
delicately-nurtured one, you have no immediate experience of such matters, you can,
after all, read and write. Surely you must at some time or other have read Zhuxius’s
essay “On Not Throwing Away”?’
   ‘Yes,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but in that essay isn’t he merely urging the people, in a fairly
general sort of way, to exert themselves? And isn’t it all rather empty and rhetorical?
Surely he didn’t mean every word of it to be taken literally?’
   ‘Zhuxius empty and rhetorical?’ said Bao-chai. ‘He meant every word of it. If, after
only a few days of household management, the greed for gain has already so clouded
your judgement that the teachings of Zhuxius seem empty and rhetorical, I fancy that
if you were to venture outside into the corrupting atmosphere of the market-place,
you would soon be finding even Confucius himself too abstract for you!’
   ‘Since you are so learned,’ said Tan-chun, ‘I’m surprised that you should appear to
be unfamiliar with the views of Fixius. Fixius once said, “Whosoever sets his foot in
the market-place or takes his seat at the counting-board must forget about Yao and
Shun and turn his back on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius...”‘
   ‘How does it go on?’ said Bao-chai.
   ‘I must claim the quoter’s privilege of giving only as much of the text as will suit my
purpose,’ said Tan-chun. ‘If I told you how it went on, I should end up by
contradicting myself!’
   ‘Everything in the world has some use or other,’ said Bao-?chai, ‘and if it has a use,
it must have a monetary value. Surely to an intelligent person like you so obvious a
truism can hardly have come as a revelation?’
   ‘You call people here to discuss important business,’ said Li Wan, ‘but all we have
had so far is talk about books!’
   ‘But talk about books is important business,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Without it we should
be no better than vulgar tradesmen I’
   The three of them continued chaffing a little longer before Tan-chun returned to
her theme:
   ‘Let’s say for the sake of argument that our garden is only twice as big as theirs.
Doubling the income they get from theirs would mean a clear profit of four hundred
taels per annum. Now of course, a family like ours couldn’t possibly put its garden
under contract and turn it into a business in the way that they do it would look too
mercenary. On the other hand, when you know how valuable everything is, it seems
a terrible waste of natural resources not to have a few people whose special job is to
look after it and just let everyone trample on it and despoil it as they please. I think
we ought to pick out a few experienced trustworthy old women from among the
ones who work in the Garden - women who know something about gardening
already - and put the upkeep of the Garden into their hands. We needn’t ask them to
pay us rent; all we need ask them for is an annual share of the produce. There would
be four advantages in this arrangement. In the first place, if we have people whose
sole occupation is to look after trees and flowers and so on, the condition of the
garden will improve gradually year after year and there will be no more of those long
periods of neglect followed by bursts of feverish activity when things have been
allowed to get out of hand. Secondly there won’t be the spoiling and wastage we get
at present. Thirdly the women themselves will gain a little extra to add to their
incomes which will compensate them for the hard work they put in throughout the
year. And fourthly, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t use the money we should
otherwise have spent on nurserymen, rockery specialists, horticultural cleaners and
so on for other purposes.’
   “‘And after three years there shall be no more famine nor hunger in the land”,’
Bao-chai intoned. (She had wandered off in the course of Tan-chun’s exposition and
was examining some calligraphy on the wall.)
‘It’s a very good idea,’ said Li Wan. ‘If we could really do this, I’m sure Lady Wang
would be pleased. It’s not so much the saving of money that’s important; but if there
are going to be people whose special job is to look after the Garden and they are
allowed to make a little money out of it as well, then what with “the allurement of
status” on the one hand and “the incentive of gain” on the other, they are sure to
make a good job of it.’
‘It needed you to suggest this, miss,’ said Patience. ‘My mistress has thought of
something like this in the past, but she hasn’t liked to mention it to anyone, because
she thought that now all you young ladies are living in the Garden you might feel that
we ought to be spending more on it rather than less and if she had people snooping
around in it making economies you might feel that that really was the last straw.’
Bao-chai walked over and began feeling Patience’s face:
‘Open your mouth, Patience: I want to see what your teeth are made of. Ever since
early this morning you’ve been keeping up this tune. You never give Miss Tan credit
for anything. You never admit that Mrs Lian is less than perfect and that there are
things she may not have thought of. Whenever Miss Tan has finished saying
something, you come back at her with the same refrain: your mistress has thought of
that too, only for some compelling reason or other she hasn’t been able to do
anything about it. This time you tell us that she didn’t like to save money by putting
the Garden under super?vision because of us living there.’
She turned to the others:
‘She’s right, of course. If you do hand this Garden over to a few of the old women
to look after, they will naturally be unwilling that a single fruit or flower that they
have charge over should be picked. Obviously where we are concerned they will not
dare to say anything; but it is sure to prove a source of endless quarrelling with the
maids. Patience is far?seeing enough to realize this and, in her own inimitable way,
without fear or flattery, she gives us warning. How tactful she is! Even if we weren’t
on good terms with her mistress, I think after hearing Patience we should be shamed
into making our peace with her!’
‘And I was so angry this morning,’ said Tan-chun. ‘When I heard that Patience had
come, I suddenly thought of her mistress and the insufferable behaviour of those
henchwomen of hers - which she, no doubt, encourages and it made me even angrier.
But Patience was so quiet and timid, like a poor little mouse that the cat has been
after, and stood there all the time so meekly; and when she did speak, it was not to
remind me of the many kindnesses that I owe her mistress, but to tell me that if I
decided to make any changes, I should be doing her mistress a kindness which she
was “sure she would appreciate”. It really wrung my heart when she said that. Not
only did I stop feeling angry then; I felt ashamed. “Here am I,” I thought, “only a
young girl, but behaving in such a way that nobody can ever like me or care what
happens to me. When shall I ever be in a position to do anyone a kindness?”’
At this point her emotion got the better of her and she shed some tears. The others,
moved by the sincerity with which she had spoken and remembering how Aunt Zhao
was con?stantly maligning her and making things difficult for her with Lady Wang,
were themselves moved to tears of sympathy; but they did their best to rally her.
‘What better return can we possibly make Lady Wang for placing her trust in us,’
said Li Wan, ‘than to take advantage of the fact that things are a little quieter now by
discussing some much-needed economies? What do you want to go bringing in an
unimportant matter like that for?’
‘I’ve got the gist of your plan, Miss,’ said Patience. ‘All you need do now is tell us
which of the women you want to appoint and we can go straight ahead with it.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but you ought to have a word with your
mistress about it first. It was a bit presumptuous of us to go poking about and making
these little economies in the first place - I should never have ventured to do so if I
hadn’t known that your mistress was so understanding: if she’d been a stupid or
touchy person, she might have suspected me of trying to shine at her expense All the
same, the very least we can do is to consult her first.’
‘Very well,’ said Patience pleasantly. ‘I’ll go and tell her, then.’
She was gone for some time, but returned eventually, full of smiles:
‘I knew it wasn’t necessary to go. Of course she agrees. A good idea like this: how
could she do otherwise?’
As soon as Tan-chun had received this confirmation, she and Li Wan sent for the list
of women employed in the Garden. Bao-chai joined them in scrutinizing it and in
making a pro?visional selection of those most likely to be suitable. These were
summoned forthwith and Li Wan, addressing them in a group, outlined the scheme
to them in general terms. The women were enthusiastic.
‘Let me have the bamboo,’ said one of them. ‘I’ll have double the amount growing
within a year. I can keep you in bamboo-shoots for the kitchen and pay you an annual
rent for it as well.’
‘Let me have that bit of rice-paddy,’ said another. ‘I’ll keep you in grain for your
cage-birds so that you don’t have to spend money on feed, and I’ll pay you annual
tent.’
Before Tan-chun could say anything, someone arrived with a message:
‘The doctor’s arrived. He’s waiting to come into the Garden to have a look at Miss
Shi.’
‘Just a moment!’ said Patience as the women went scurry?ing off to escort the
doctor. ‘There’s no point in a hundred people going if there isn’t anyone responsible
to receive him.’
‘Wu xin-deng’s wife and Mrs Shan are already waiting for him at the Painted Gate
on the south-west corner of the Garden,’ said the woman who had brought the
message.
When Patience heard that, she made no further objection.
After the women had gone, Tan-chun looked at Bao-chai inquiringly:
‘Well?’
Bac-chal laughed:
“‘He who shows most enthusiasm in the beginning proves often to be a sluggard in
the end; and he who promises the fairest is often thinking more of his profit than of
his performance.”’
Tan-chun nodded in agreement and praised the aptness of the quotation. She turned
to the register once more and pointed out a few more names for the other two to
con?sider. Patience fetched a brush and inkstone for her to write with.
‘Mamma Zhu is a very reliable body,’ said the others of one of these. ‘Her old man
used to be a bamboo specialist and her son still is; it’s in the family. She’s the one we
should put in charge of all the bamboos in the Garden. And Mamma Tian comes
from a farming family. The farm at Sweet-rice Village may be only a plaything and not
meant for serious cultivation, but if she were in charge of all those vegetable and
paddy strips and doing the things that needed doing at the proper times, we should
probably get a lot more out of it.’
‘When you think of the amount of land that goes with them, it seems a pity that
All-spice Court and Green Delights don’t produce anything marketable,’ said
Tan-chun.
‘Oh, but they do!’ said Li Wan. ‘Especially All-spice Court. Half the aromatics sold in
perfumers’ shops and on the herb stalls at markets and temple fairs come from
plants like the ones grown in All-spice. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more
profit to be had out of them than out of anything else that this Garden produces. And
as for Green Delights: to mention nothing else, just look at all the flowers produced
by that rosa rugosa during the spring and summer months! And all the rambler roses
and monthly roses and rosa glabra and honeysuckle and wistaria on the pergolas:
think how much you could make out of them if the flowers were dried properly and
sold to tea-merchants for flavouring!’
Tan-chun nodded enthusiastically.
‘But,’ she reflected, ‘we haven’t got anyone who knows the art of flower-drying,
have we?’
‘The mother of Miss Bao’s maid Oriole knows all about that sort of thing,’ said
Patience. ‘Don’t you remember her drying a lot of flowers once and filling little
baskets and gourds with them to make us presents?’
‘Is this the thanks I get for praising you?’ Bao-chai asked Patience.
‘What can you mean?’ said the others, in some surprise.
You can't possibly give the job to her,' said Bao-chai. 'You have so many able and
willing women of your own who won't be getting any of these jobs: they are going to
think very poorly of me if they know that I am responsible for bringing in an outsider.
I can think of someone that you could give this job to, though: Old Mamma Ye at
Green Delights - Tealeaf's mother. She's a very honest old woman; and what's more,
she is on very good terms with Oriole's mother. You'd much better give the job to her.
She will probably consult Oriole's mother whenever there is anything she is not sure
about in any case. She may even elect to hand over to her altogether. But that would
be entirely a private matter between the two of them. The other servants might
resent it, but at least they couldn't blame us. The advantage of this arrangement is
that it would look fair as well as being effective.'
Li Wan and Patience agreed. Tan-chun was more sceptical:
'That may be; but what if cupidity proves stronger than friendship?'
'Not likely in this case,' said Patience. 'Only the other day Mamma Ye was invited to
become Oriole's godmother. The three of them had a little party to celebrate. The
two families are very close.'
Tan-chun dropped her objection and proceeded, with the others, to deliberate on the
rest of their choices - all of them women whom the four of them had mentally noted
in the past for their dependability. As each one's selection was confirmed, she made
a little circle with her writing-brush against the corresponding name in the register.
Shortly after this the women arrived back again to report that the doctor had gone
and to hand in the prescription he had left. After studying it, Li Wan, Tan-chun and
Bao-chai sent one of the women to obtain the drugs from outside and to supervise
the making-up and administering of the medicine. Then Li Wan and Tan-chun told the
women which of them were to have the cultivation of which parts of the Garden and
what the conditions of their tenure were to be:
'You will be expected to give us, in due season, a fixed amount of your crops for our
own use; but apart from that it will be up to you to make whatever profit from them
you can.
Accounts will be submitted and dues paid at the end of the year.'
'I've been having second thoughts about that,' said Tan?-chun. 'If you are submitting
annual accounts and paying dues, presumably it will be to the Office. But that means
another lot of people with control over you and another layer skimmed off your
profits. Now in thinking up this new arrangement and appointing you ourselves, we
are already in a sense going above their heads, which is sure to anger them. They
probably won't dare to say anything about it now, but there will be nothing to stop
them getting their own back later on when you go round to settle accounts with
them at the end of the year. And there's another thing. If they are going to be in on
this, they are sure to expect a share of the produce. Whatever you agree to give us in
the course of each year, they will expect the equivalent of half the amount for
themselves. That's an old, established rule. Everyone knows that. But since the new
arrangement is our creation, I say let's keep it out of their hands altogether. If there's
to be an annual settling of accounts, let it be done here, internally.'
'If you ask me,' said Bao-chai, I don't think there should be any settling of accounts at
all. You'd always be finding that this one had too much and that one too little. It
would only be a lot of extra trouble. Why not get each of them to take over some
regular item of your expenditure and pay for it out of their profits? That will keep it
all inside the Garden. I've just been running over in my mind what your regular
expenses are. They aren't very many. There's hair-oil, cos?metics, incense, paper:
every mistress and her maids get a fixed amount of those every month. Then there
are brushes, dust-pans, feather-dusters and food for the livestock (birds, rabbits, deer
and so forth). That's really all. Now suppose instead of drawing money from Accounts
for all those things we gave these women the responsibility of paying for them:
how much do you reckon the saving would be?'
'They're small items in themselves,' said Patience, 'but I should think if you added
them all together the total annual saving would be well over four hundred taels.'
'There you are I' said Bao-chai. 'Four hundred a year, eight hundred in two years: you
could buy a small house for letting with that or add half an acre of poor farm-land to
your landholdings. But though there should be quite a lot left over after they have
covered the expenses we are assigning to them, we want them to have a little
something to spend on themselves after working hard all through the year; and
though, from our point of view, the main object of these operations is economy, we
don’t want to overdo it. There would be no point in saving an extra two or three
hundred taels if it meant resorting to undignified methods in order to do so. What
we are now proposing means that Accounts will be paying out four or five hundred
taels a year less than they do now without anyone outside feeling the pinch. And as
for inside, the women doing these jobs will be getting a little extra for themselves,
the ones not doing them will be able to relax a bit, the Garden’s stock of trees and
flowers will thrive and increase through being better cared for, and we shall he better
off when we have this regular supply of the produce for our own use - all this without
any loss of dignity. Whereas if we went all out to economize with no other
consideration but making money in mind, no doubt we should have little difficulty in
squeezing more out, but the effect of paying everything back into the common
account would be wails of protest from everyone, both inside the Garden and out,
and a consequent loss of dignity that in a household like yours would be quite
un?acceptable.
‘Altogether there must be several dozen old women working in this Garden. If you
give the money-making jobs to these few here and leave the others out in the cold,
the others are going to complain that it isn’t fair. Now as I said, there’s still going to
be quite a lot of money left over when they’ve finished paying these various
expenses for you, and I think we should be letting them off a bit too lightly if we let
them keep all of it. Why don’t we say that every year, no matter how much or how
little they have made, they are to pay so many strings of cash into a common pool
which will be shared out among all the other women? Although those others won’t
any longer have anything to do with the upkeep of the Garden, they are responsible,
day and night, for keeping an eye on the other servants; they have the responsibility
of opening and closing the gates, which means that they have to get up earlier and
go to bed later than everyone else; and whenever any of us go out, whatever the
weather, even if it is raining or snowing heavily, they have to carry sedans, punt boats,
draw sledges - in fact do any heavy work that needs to be done. Since they work so
hard in the Garden from one year’s end to the next, it seems only fair that if any
money is going to be made out of the Garden, they should have a share in it. And
there’s another reason for this, if it doesn’t seem too petty-minded to mention it’ -
Bao-chai turned to the women to explain - ‘If you think only of how much you can
make out of this for yourselves and don’t let the others have a share, they are sure to
feel resentful even if they don’t like to say anything and will try to make up for it by
misappropriating what they can for their own use - filching a fruit here and a flower
there whenever they have the opportunity. Whereas if they know in advance that
they are going to get a share of whatever you make from your produce, they will be
as anxious as you are that none of it is stolen and will even keep an eye on it for you
when you aren’t able to watch over it yourselves.’
The women were quick to see the force of this argument - no control by the Office,
no settling of accounts with Xi-feng, only a few strings of cash to pay out every year.
They were all of them delighted and accepted these conditions unani?mously.
‘Better than being pushed around by Accounts,’ they said. ‘If we were paying them
anything, they’d want a dash on top of it for themselves.’
Those of the women present who were not getting one of the gardening jobs, when
they heard that they were going to be given money at the end of every year without
having to do anything to earn it, were, if anything, even more delighted -though for
politeness’ sake they pretended to demur:
‘After all the hard work they’ll be putting into it they ought to have a bit extra for
themselves. Doesn’t seem right that we should sit back and collect the jackpot
without having to do anything for it!’
‘Don’t refuse the offer,’ said Bao-chai, smiling. ‘It’s no less than you deserve. As
long as you continue to keep a close watch on things and don’t get slack and allow
people to drink and gamble. Otherwise it puts me in such an awkward position. This
isn’t really my business, of course; but as you have no doubt heard, my aunt has
repeatedly urged me to take over responsibility for it on the grounds that Mrs Zhu is
too busy and the other young ladles are too young to attend to it. I can’t refuse her,
knowing that to do so would be deliberately adding to her worries. She has such
indifferent health and so many household cares and I have so little to do myself that
even if she were only a neighbour and not my aunt, I could scarcely refuse to help her.
It’s no good worrying that I shall make myself unpopular. If I care only about being
popular and allow people to drink and gamble as much as they like, sooner or later
someone who has drunk too much will start a quarrel. If an incident like that were to
happen, how should I be able to look my aunt in the face? And think what it would
be like for you. You would have forfeited your reputation as responsible seniors that
you have taken so many years to build up. After all, the reason all these dozens of
maids and the whole of this great Garden have been placed under your supervision is
because you have served here under three or four generations of masters and are
considered more dependable than any of the other servants. At a time when we all
ought to be doing our best to keep up appearances, you will have allowed other
people to drink and gamble. It will be bad enough if my aunt gets to hear of it and
gives you a talking-to; but what if you are found out by the stewardesses and they
decide to discipline you themselves without bothering to tell my aunt? What a
disgrace, that people of your years should be punished by servants younger than
yourselves. They would be within their rights, of course. As stewardesses they have
power over all other members of the staff. But how much better if you conducted
yourselves in such a way that you could keep your self-respect and not be in a
position where they had you at their mercy! That is why I have thought of this plan
for bringing you in a little extra money. I am hoping that everyone will now
collaborate to make this Garden such a model of discipline and good management
that those who have the power to intervene, when they see how tight a discipline
you are able to keep by yourselves, will decide that there is nothing for them to
worry about and will respect you and leave you alone. Then we shall feel that the
trouble we have taken in planning this little extra income for you was justified. Think
about it!’
The women were all smiles of pleasure:
‘You’re right, Miss Bao. Don’t worry, Mrs Zhu and young ladies both! We should be
lost souls indeed if we didn’t show a bit of consideration for you after you have been
so kind and thoughtful to us!’
At that moment Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife came in:
‘The Zhen family from Nanking arrived in town yesterday. Today they have gone to
the Palace to offer their felicitations. Some of their people have just arrived here to
pay their respects. They have brought presents with them.’
She held out the list of presents with both hands. Tan-chun took it from her and ran
her eye over it:

Imperial use decorated satins and mang satins                               12 lengths
Imperial use satins, various 12 lengths
Imperial use gauzes, in different shades     12 lengths
Imperial use Palace taffetas 12 lengths
Official use satins, gauzes, taffetas and damasks in various colours   24 lengths

When Li Wan too had seen the list, she told Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife to use the largest size
of gratuity packet for tipping the bearers with. She also sent someone to report to
Grandmother Jia, who sent word back that Li Wan, Tan-chun and Bao-chai were to
come over and inspect the presents. After they had done so, Li Wan told the women
in charge of the store-room to wait until Lady Wang had got back and had a look at
them before putting them into store.
‘The Zhens are rather special people,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You had better use
one of the largest gratuity packets when you are tipping the bearers. And you’d
better get some cloth-lengths ready: I expect we shall have some of their women
arriving shortly, to pay their respects.’
   The words were scarcely out of her mouth when the arrival of four women from
the Zhen household was announced. Grandmother Jia at once gave orders that they
should be brought in. All four were sober matrons of forty years or more and so
genteelly dressed that it would have been im?possible to guess from their
appearance that they were servants. When the formal salutations and the inquiries
after Grand?mother Jia’s health had been completed, the old lady called for
footstools to be brought for them to sit on. They acknowledged the courtesy but
waited until Bao-chai and the others were seated before they would sit down
themselves. When Grandmother Jia asked them when they had arrived in town, they
stood up again to reply:
   ‘We arrived yesterday. Today Her Ladyship has had to take our young lady to the
Palace, so she has sent us to offer you her respects and ask after the young ladies.’
   ‘It’s many years since they have been to the capital,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s
rather unexpected, that they should suddenly turn up like this.’
  The women smiled:
  ‘Yes, madam. They had an Imperial Summons to come this year.’
‘Have they all come?’ said Grandmother Jia.
  ‘No, madam. Her Old Ladyship and the young master and our fourth and fifth
young ladies and the other ladles all stayed at home. Only Her Ladyship and our third
young lady have accompanied the Master on this journey.’
  ‘Is your third young lady betrothed yet?’ said Grandmother Jia.
  ‘No, madam, not yet.’
  ‘Your first and second young ladies both married into families on very good terms
with ours,’ said Grandmother Jia.
  ‘Yes, madam,’ said the spokeswoman. ‘Every year when they write home they tell
us how much they are beholden to you for your kind concern.’
  Grandmother Jia laughed deprecatingly:
  ‘One could hardly call it that. Our families have known each other for so long and
we are connected by marriage: it’s only right that we should take an interest in them.
We are particularly fond of your second young lady. She is so unassuming, in spite of
her rank. I think I could say, without offence, that we have grown quite attached to
her.’
  The women laughed:
  ‘You are too polite, madam.’
Grandmother Jia pursued her questioning:
‘Your young master lives with his grandmother, then?’
 ‘Yes, madam.’
 ‘How old is he? Has he started school yet?’
   ‘Thirteen this year,’ said the woman. ‘He has started school, but he is always
playing truant. He has always been naughty, since he was little. He’s a good-looking
boy, though, and his grandmother’s favourite, so there’s not much his father and
mother can do about it.’
   Grandmother Jia was greatly diverted.
   ‘Just like us! And what is his name?’
   ‘Well, because she says he is her “treasure” and because he has such a milky-white
complexion, his grandmother calls him “Bao-yu”. That means “Precious Jade”, you
see.’
   Grandmother Jia turned to Li Wan, laughing:
   ‘Fancy that! He’s even called Bao-yu, too.’
   Li Wan inclined politely
   ‘Coincidences over names have always been common, whether among
contemporaries or among people of different periods.’
   ‘We did wonder, after he was given this name, whether there wasn’t some family
of our acquaintance in the capital in which the name had already been used,’ said the
woman; ‘but as it was ten or more years since we’d been there, we couldn’t
remember for sure whether there was or not.’
   ‘It’s my grandson’s name,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Come here, someone.’
   ‘Hei!’ shouted the womenservants in attendance, and a few of them stepped
forward.
   ‘Go over to the Garden and tell our Bao-yu to come here so that our visitors can
have a look at him and tell us how he compares with their Bao-yu.’
The women hurried off in obedience to her order and returned after ten minutes or
so with Bao-yu in their midst. When the four women from the Zhen household saw
him enter, they hurriedly rose to their feet.
   ‘You gave us quite a turn,’ they said. ‘If we hadn’t been here and had met you in
some other place, we’d have thought that our own Bao-yu must have followed after
to join us!’
   They took him by the hand and made much of him, plying him with all sorts of
questions. Bao-yu smiled back at them and greeted them politely.
   ‘Well, how does he compare with yours?’ Grandmother Jia asked them.
   ‘It would appear that the two Bao-yus are very like each other from what they
have already said,’ Li Wan remarked.
   ‘I doubt such a coincidence is possible,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Children of the
upper classes, especially if they are reared delicately and provided they are not
pock-marked or ill-favoured, are all much of a muchness as far as good looks are
concerned. There would be nothing remarkable in a slight resemblance between
them.’
   ‘In appearance he is exactly like our Bao-yu,’ said the women; ‘but though Your
Ladyship was saying just now that he is mischievous, I think your Bao-yu must be
better-tempered than ours.’
   ‘Oh?’ said Grandmother Jia, immediately interested. ‘Why do you think that?’
   ‘Because he let us hold his hand just now when we talked to him. If it had been our
young gentleman, he would have called us “old fools”. We are not allowed to lay a
finger on any of his things even, let alone take him by the hand. The only servants he
will have about him are young girls.’
   Before they could go on, Li Wan, Tan-chun and Bao-chai had burst out laughing.
Grandmother Jia was laughing too:
   ‘I’m sure that if I were to send some of my women to see your Bao-yu now and
they took him by the hand, he would somehow or other contrive to put up with it.
Children brought up in families like ours, no matter how odd or eccentric they may
be, will always conduct themselves in a courteous, well-bred manner in the presence
of strangers. Otherwise their eccentricity would not be tolerated. In fact, the reason
why grown-ups are so fond of them, though partly because of their good looks, is
mainly because their beautiful manners - much better than many a grown-up’s -
make it such a pleasure to be with them. No one meeting them can help liking them,
and that makes us more tolerant of what they do on their own, when they are out of
sight. But if they were to carry on in exactly the same way all the time, never allowing
the grown-ups to get a word in edgeways, they would be fit for nothing but a
whipping.’
‘That’s true, madam,’ said the women, smiling. ‘Although our Bao-yu is so odd and
mischievous, he can at times, when he is with visitors, behave himself better than a
grown-up, so that it’s a pleasure to watch him. No one who meets him can help liking
him. Often they ask us what his father should want to beat him for, not realizing what
a holy terror he can be inside the family. Sir Zhen and Lady Zhen are driven half
distracted by him. If it were just his wilfulness, which is fairly normal in a child, it
could be cured in time; so could his extravagance, which is normal in the sons of
well-to-do people; and so could his hatred of study, which again is fairly normal in a
young person. But this weird perverseness of his seems to be inbred: there seems to
be no cure for it.’
   Just then Lady Wang’s return was announced. She went straight up to
Grandmother Jia on entering and saluted her, after which she received the
salutations of the four visitors and exchanged a few words with them.
   ‘You are tired,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Go and rest’
Lady Wang served her mother-in-law with some tea before withdrawing to her own
apartment. Shortly after she had gone, the four women took their leave of
Grandmother Jia and went to join her. Lady Wang chatted with them for a while
about family affairs before sending them on their way - suitably primed, of course,
with messages and gratuities: but those are details which need not concern us.

*

Greatly tickled by what the women had told her, Grandmother Jia, for some time
after their visit) would announce to anyone who came to see her:
There is another Bao-yu, you know, exactly like our Bao-yu in every particular.’
The other memhers of the family, bearing in mind that the world was a large place
and instances of the same name among its innumerable upper-class families
probably of not very rare occurrence, and that a grandmother who doted on her
grandson was a fairly unremarkable phenomenon, were unimpressed by the
coincidence and gave little thought to it. But Bao-yu, convinced, like many another
young gentleman, of his own uniqueness, dismissed what the four women had said
as a fabrication designed to give pleasure to his grandmother. He was taunted about
it by Xiang-yun when he visited her in her sick-room in the Garden to see how she
was getting on.
‘You’ll be able to get up to all sorts of mischief now,’ she said. ‘Previously it was a
case of

The single strand makes not a thread Nor the single tree a wood.

We thought there was only one of you. But now you know you are a pair, there will
be no stopping you. If your father beats you really badly, you can always run off to
Nanking and get this other Bao-yu to stand in for you!’
‘You don’t believe that rubbish, do you?’ said Bao-yu. ‘How could there be another
Bao-yu?’
‘There was a Lin Xiang-ru in the Warring States period and a Si-ma Xiang-ru under
the Former Han,’ said Xiang-yun.
‘Yes, but this one’s supposed to look the same as well,’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s not
something you can find precedents for, surely?’
‘What about when the men of Kuang mistook Confucius for Yang Huo?’ said
Xiang-yun.
Confucius and Yang Huo may have looked the same,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they didn’t
have the same name. Lin xiang?ru and Si-ma Xiang-ru had the same name but they
didn’t look alike. We are supposed both to have the same name and to look the same.
It isn’t possible.’
Xiang-yun, unable to think of a reply, took the easy way out.
‘Pleathe yourthelf. Whether it is or whether it isn’t, it’s of no concern to me.’
And she lay back on the bed and closed her eyes.
But Bao-yu’s confidence was shaken. Had he a double? When he told himself that he
couldn’t possibly, he now began to feel that perhaps after all he had. On the other
hand how could he be sure that he had when he had never seen him? Brooding on
this uncertainty, he went back to his room and lay down on his bed to ponder it in
silence. Soon he had drifted into sleep.
He was in a garden, which, he remarked with surprise, bore some resemblance to
Prospect Garden. While he was still puzzling over the similarity, he became aware
that some girls were coming towards him, all of them maids. Again he was surprised:
‘Strange that there should be another lot of maids here like Faithful and Aroma and
Patience!’
He observed that they were laughing at him:
‘Bao-yu, what are you doing here?’
Bao-yu, naturally supposing that they meant him, smiled back at them:
‘I’ve strayed in here by accident. I think this garden must belong to some friend or
other of my family. Won’t you take me with you and show me round it?’
‘It isn’t our Bao-yu after all,’ said the girls. ‘He’s not bad-looking, though, and he
sounds reasonably intelligent.’
‘Tell me,’ said Bao-yu eagerly, ‘is there another Bao-yu here then?’
‘Bao-yu?’ rejoined one of the girls sharply. ‘We have Her Old Ladyship’s and Her
Ladyship’s orders to use that name as much as possible as a means of bringing him
luck and Bao-yu likes to hear us use it; but what business has a boy like you from
some remote place outside to be making free with it? Don’t let them catch you doing
that here, boy or they’ll flay your backside for you!’
‘Come, let’s be going,’ said another. ‘We don’t want Bao-yu to see him.’
‘Don’t let’s stand here talking to the nasty creature,’ said a third. ‘We shall be
contaminated!’
And they hurried off.
Bao-yu was nonplussed.
‘No one has ever been as horrid as that to me before. I wonder why they are? And I
wonder if there really is another person exactly like me here.’
As he mused on the unaccountable hostility of the maids, his feet were carrying him
along in no particular direction and presently he found himself inside a courtyard. He
looked around him in some surprise:
‘Strange! There’s even a place like Green Delights here.’
He mounted the steps of the verandah and walked inside the building. Someone was
lying there on a bed. On the other side of the room were some maids, some of them
sewing, some of them giggling over a game they were playing. Presently the person
on the bed - it was a youth - could he heard to sigh and one of the maids laughingly
inquired what he was sighing for.
‘Aren’t you asleep, Bao-yu? I suppose you are worried about your cousin’s illness
again and imagining all sorts of foolish things about her.’
Bao-yu heard this with some astonishment. He listened while the youth on the bed
replied:
‘I heard Grandmother say that there is another Bao-yu in the capital who is exactly
like me, but I didn’t believe her. I’ve just been having a dream in which I went into a
large garden and met some girls there who called me a “nasty creature” and
wouldn’t have anything to do with me. I managed to find this Bao-yu’s room, but he
was asleep. What I saw was only an empty shell lying there on the bed. I was
wondering where the real person could have got to.’
‘I came here looking for Bao-yu. Are you Bao-yu then?’ Bao-yu could not help
blurting out.
The youth leaped down from the bed and seized Bao-yu by the hands:
‘So you are Bao-yu, and this isn’t a dream after all?’
‘Of course it isn’t a dream,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It couldn’t be more real!’
Just then someone arrived with a summons:
‘The Master wants to see Bao-yu.’
For a moment the two Bao-yus were stunned; and then one Bao-yu hurried off and
the other Bao-yu was left calling after him:
‘Come back, Bao-yu! Come back, Bao-yu!’
Aroma heard him calling his own name in his sleep and shook him awake.
‘Where’s Bao-yu?’ she asked him jokingly.
Though awake, Bao-yu had not yet regained consciousness of his surroundings. He
pointed to the doorway:
‘He’s only just left. He can’t have got very far.’
‘You’re still dreaming,’ Aroma said, amused. ‘Rub your eyes and have another look.
That’s the mirror. You’re looking at your own reflection in the mirror.’
Bao-yu leaned forward and looked the doorway he had pointed to was his
dressing-mirror. He joined Aroma in laughing at himself.
Seeing him awake, maids were already at hand with a spittoon and a cup of strong
tea for him to rinse his mouth with. Musk recalled Grandmother Jia’s strictures
against young people having too many mirrors around them.
‘She says that when you’re young your soul isn’t fully formed yet, and if you’re
reflected in mirrors too often, it can give your soul a shock which causes you to have
bad dreams. Fancy putting your bed right in front of that great mirror! It’s all right as
long as it’s kept covered, but sometimes when you’ve been out to the front,
especially in hot weather when you’re feeling tired, they forget to cover it. That’s
what must have happened just now. And you must have been looking at yourself in it
before you dropped off to sleep. That would be a sure way of bringing on a bad
dream. And it would explain why you were calling your own name out in your sleep.
Let’s move this bed inside, away from the mirror, for goodness sake!’
Just then a message arrived for Bao-yu from Lady Wang saying that she wanted to
see him.
But as to what it was she wanted to see him about: that will be revealed in the
chapter which follows.
CHAPTER 57

Nightingale tests Jade Boy with a startling message
And Aunt Xue comforts Frowner with
words of loving kindness



Obedient to the summons, Bao-yu hurried from the Garden and over to his mother’s
apartment. It appeared that she was about to pay a call on Lady Zhen and wanted to
take him with her. Bao-yu was delighted and hurried back again to get changed.
The Zhens’ town house was very much like the Ning and Rong establishments - if
anything, a shade more opulent. In answer to Bao-yu’s questioning, Lady Zhen
assured him that there was indeed a Bao-yu in Nanking. She kept the two of them to
dinner and they stayed there for the rest of the day. Bao-yu was at last convinced.
As soon as they got back in the evening, Lady Wang made arrangements for
entertaining Lady Zhen. A first-class dinner was ordered, a well-known troupe of
adult players engaged, and Lady Zhen and her daughter were invited to come over
next day. The day after that mother and daughter left town. They had no time for
farewells: Sir Zhen had been ordered back to his post.
It was on the day of their departure that Bao-yu, after visiting Xiang-yun and finding
that she was distinctly on the mend, went over to see how Dai-yu was getting on,
only to be told that she was taking her afternoon nap. Nightingale chanced to be
sitting outside in the covered walk doing some sewing, so, not wishing to disturb
Dai-yu, he went over to talk to Nightingale instead.
‘How was she last night? Is her cough any better?’
‘Yes, a bit better,’ said Nightingale.
‘Thank the Lord for that!’ said Bao-yu fervently. ‘If only she could shake it off
altogether!’
Nightingale looked up at him with amusement:
‘It’s not often we hear you calling on the Lord.’
Bao-yu returned her smile:
‘Any doctor will do in an emergency.’
His eye took in her costume as he said this: a cotton-padded dress of thin
black-and-white material with only a lined black satin waistcoat over the top of it. He
reached out his hand to feel it.
‘What you’re wearing is much too thin for this time of year. You’re sitting in a
draught here as well. If you go sick too, things here will be in a pretty pickle!’
‘Look,’ said Nightingale sharply, ‘let’s just talk to each other in future, shall we,
without any of this pawing about? Now that we’re all beginning to grow up, it creates
such a bad impression. However much that horrible lot over there say things about
you behind your back, you still carry on the same as when you were little. It won’t do.
Miss Lin has warned us time and again about getting into conversations with you.
Look at the way she behaves towards you herself nowadays: she can’t keep far
enough away from you.’
She rose to her feet as she said this and moved, with her sewing, into the house.
The effect of this rebuff on Bao-yu’s feelings was as if a bowl of icy water had been
emptied over him. For some moments he was stunned and stood gazing stupidly at
the clump of bamboos that were growing in front of him; then, as he became
gradually aware that Mamma Zhu, to whose expert care they had been entrusted,
was rooting about in their midst, he took himself off, but still in a daze, and scarcely
aware what he was doing. Presently he sat down on a rock somewhere to think.
Tears rolled down his cheeks, but he did not feel them. For an hour or more he
continued to sit there motionless, turning the same question, ‘What am I to do?’,
over and over in his mind, but never reaching a con?clusion.
Snowgoose, sent on an errand to fetch ginseng from Lady Wang’s, passed by him on
her way back. As she glanced sideways from the path, she saw a figure sitting
motionless on a rock underneath a peach-tree, chin cupped in hand and evidently
lost in thought, which she recognized, with some surprise, as Bao-yu.
‘It’s ever so cold,’ she thought: ‘what can he be doing, all on his own out here?
They say that sickly people are specially liable to catch things in spring. Perhaps he’s
gone mental.’
She went over to where he was sitting and, squatting down in front of him, peered
smilingly into his face.
‘What are you doing out here?’
Bao-yu noticed her with a start.
‘Why do you come up to me like this? You’re a girl, aren’t you? She’s told you all
not to have anything to do with me, for fear of creating a scandal; so why do you still
come up to me? If we’re seen here talking together) there’ll only be more gossip. Go
back home!’
Snowgoose assumed that Dai-yu had been upsetting him and continued on her way.
When she got back to the Naiad’s House, Dai-yu was still asleep, so she gave the
ginseng to Nightingale.
‘What was Her Ladyship doing?’ Nightingale asked her.
‘She was having an afternoon nap, too. That’s why I was so long. I’ll tell you
something that will make you laugh, Night. While I was sitting in the servants’ room
talking to Silver and waiting for Her Ladyship to get up, who should look in but Mrs
Zhao, and beckoned me over to her. And do you know what she wanted? They’re
burying her brother tomorrow and she’s got leave from Her Ladyship to go there for
the wake. Young Fortune’s going with her, and she said Fortune hasn’t got anything
to wear, would I please lend her my pale-blue dress? Well, I thought to myself,
Fortune’s got just as many dresses as I have; the only reason she wants to borrow
some?one else’s is because she’s too mean to let her wear her own there and risk
getting it dirtied. I wouldn’t mind lending it to her - even if she dirtied it, it wouldn’t
matter all that much - but what has she ever done for us? So I said, “Miss Lin told me
to hand all my clothes and jewellery to Nightingale to look after. I should have to see
Nightingale about it first, and I should have to tell Miss Lin. It might take rather a long
time. I might not be able to get it to you before you go,” I said. “Perhaps it would be
safer to borrow someone else’s.”‘
Nightingale laughed.
‘You’re an artful little minx, aren’t you? You don’t wantto lend her your dress, but
you take very good care that it’s me and Miss Lin that get blamed for refusing it, and
not you. Is Mrs Zhao going now, then, or first thing tomorrow?’
‘Now,’ said Snowgoose. ‘She’s probably already left.’
Nightingale nodded.
‘It looks as if Miss Lin’s still asleep,’ said Snowgoose. ‘If it wasn’t her, I wonder who
it was that made Bao-yu so upset. He was sitting Out there in the Garden crying.’
‘Oh?’ said Nightingale sharply. ‘Where?’
‘Under that peach-tree behind Drenched Blossoms Pavi?lion.’
Nightingale hurriedly put down her sewing and stood up. ‘You take over in case she
calls. If she wants me, tell her I’ll be back directly.’
She sped off to look for Bao-yu. There was a reassuring smile on her face as she came
up to him.
‘That was only a harmless little remark I made, and it was only for your own and
everyone else’s good. Why did you need to get in such a passion and go rushing off to
sit in the wind here and cry? Suppose you were to get ill as a result of this.’
Immediately Bao-yu was his smiling self once more:
‘I wasn’t in a passion. I thought what you said was very reasonable. What upset me
was the thought that if you felt that way, then other people must feel that way too, in
which case soon everyone would stop having anything to do with me.’
Nightingale sat down companionably at his side.
‘A short while ago you moved away from me when I was standing opposite you,’
said Bao-yu. ‘Now, apparently, it is all right to sit close beside me.’
‘I suppose you’ve forgotten the time when you and Miss Lin were talking together
and Mrs Zhao burst in on you,’ said Nightingale. ‘That was what made me careful.
Now I’ve just heard that she’s away, so it’s quite safe. Incidentally, there’s something
about that occasion I’ve always wanted to ask you. You were about to say something
about bird’s nest when she came in but didn’t have a chance to finish; and you’ve
never referred to it since.’
‘Oh, it was nothing important,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s just that once you start taking
bird’s nest, you’ve got to keep it up, and it seemed to me that as Cousin Bao is really
here as our guest, it would be rather boorish to keep asking her for more; on the
other hand it would be rather awkward to have to ask Lady Wang for it; so I dropped
a hint to Grandma, and I rather think that she had a word on the subject with Feng.
That’s all I was going to tell Dai when we were interrupted. I’ve since heard that
you’re getting an ounce a day regularly, so there hasn’t seemed any need to mention
it.
‘Oh, so it was you who told her about it,’ said Nightingale. ‘In that case we owe you
our thanks. We couldn’t think what it was that could have suddenly put it into her
head.’
‘She should take it regularly, every day,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If she can keep it up for two
or three years, she should get completely better.’
‘It’s easy enough now,’ said Nightingale, ‘but where will she find the money for it
next year, when she goes home?’
Bao-yu was startled.
‘When who goes home? What home?’
‘When your Cousin Dai goes back to Soochow.’
Bao-yu laughed:
‘You’re joking. Soochow is where her father came from, I know. But the reason we
brought her here in the first place was because when my Aunt Lin died there was no
one to look after her. There wouldn’t be anyone in Soochow for her to go to. You
must be lying.’
‘How arrogant you are I’ said Nightingale scornfully. ‘I suppose you think yours is
the only big family in the world. According to you, I suppose, other people only have
fathers and mothers: they couldn’t possibly have uncles and aunts on their father’s
side like you do. As a matter of fact, when Miss Lin came here it wasn’t because there
weren’t any relations of her father’s that she could have gone to; it was because Her
Old Ladyship was afraid that being so little she might not be as happy with them as
she would with her mother’s folk. But it was only ever her intention to keep her here
for a few years. As soon as she’s old enough to be married, she’ll have to go back to
the Lin family. You could hardly expect a Lin family girl to spend the rest of her days
among Jias, now could you? The Lins may be too poor to afford a square meal, but
they are people of education. They’d never sink so low as to hand over responsibility
for one of their own number to their marriage-kin. Next year - next spring at the
earliest, but certainly not later than next autumn - either your family will send her
back to them or the Lins themselves will come here to fetch her. Miss Lin was talking
to me about it only the other night. She said I was to ask you to get together all the
little presents she’s ever given you and send them back to her, and she’ll do the same
with yours.’
To Bao-yu these words were like a thunderclap exploding immediately overhead.
Nightingale waited to see how he would reply, but he made no sound. Growing at
last im?patient, she was about to speak to him again when Skybright appeared. She
had been looking for him everywhere, she said. He was wanted by his grandmother.
‘He’s been here all this time talking about Miss Lin’s ill-ness,’ said Nightingale. ‘I
keep telling him how she is, but he won’t believe me. If you want him to go with you,
you’ll have to take hold of him and make him go.’
She left then, without waiting to see more.
Skybright noticed Bao-yu’s vacant expression. His forehead was beaded with sweat
and there was a red, inflamed look about his face. She seized him by the hand and
hurried him back to Green Delights.
Aroma was naturally alarmed to see Bao-yu come back in such a state, but attributed
it to the weather: it was an in-clement spring and he had gone out while overheated
and exposed himself to the wind. But it soon became ap?parent that feverishness
was the least serious of his symp?toms. His eyes had a fixed and glassy stare, a little
trickle of saliva ran from each corner of his mouth, and he seemed to have lost all
consciousness of what he was doing: when they brought him a pillow he lay down;
when they pulled him by the hand he sat up again; when they handed him a cup of
tea he drank it; but all with the mechanical movements of an automaton. The maids,
when they saw this, were in a panic; but not daring to report yet to Grandmother Jia,
they first sent for Nannie Li to tell them what was wrong.
Nannie Li came promptly. Before she did anything else, she spent a good long while
simply observing him. Then she asked him a few questions, but he made no reply.
Then she took his wrist in her hand and felt his pulse. Finally, taking the raphe of his
lip between her thumb and finger, she pinched it a couple of times, so hard that a
deep imprint was made by her nails: yet he seemed to feel nothing.
‘Lord a mercy!’ cried the old woman in a pathetic voice, and clinging to his body,
she set up a howl and wept. Aroma, beside herself with anxiety, tugged imploringly
at her sleeve:
‘Nannie, Nannie, have another look at him and tell us how serious it is, so that we
know what to say to Their Ladyships. Don’t just cry!’
Nannie Li hammered the bed with her fists:
‘It’s all up with him, I tell you. All the heartache I’ve had on account of him was
wasted.’
Aroma and the girls who, whatever else they might think of Nannie Li, respected her
age and experience, assumed that she must know what she was talking about and all
began crying too.
Skybright now told Aroma the circumstances in which she had found Bao-yu.
Without a moment’s hesitation Aroma flew over to the Naiad’s House, arriving just
as Nightingale was giving Dai-yu her medicine. Wasting no time on civility, she stalked
straight up to Nightingale and confronted her there and then.
‘What did you say just now to our Bao-yu? Just go and take a look at him, will you,
then go and tell Her Old Lady ship, because I won’t be responsible.’
She concluded by sitting down rudely in a chair.
The sight of Aroma, with her angry, tear-stained face, behaving in a way that was so
utterly uncharacteristic of her, filled Dai-yu with alarm.
‘What is it?’
Aroma made an effort to control herself and answered tearfully:
‘I don’t know what Her Ladyship here can have said to him, but that simpleton of
ours just stares into space without speaking, his hands and feet are icy-cold, and
when Nannie Li pinches him, he doesn’t seem to feel anything. He looked half dead
when I left. Even Nannie Li said it was all up with him. She’s over there wailing for
him now. He may be already dead for all I know.’
To Dai-yu, as to the girls, Nannie Li, for all her failings, was an old woman whose
words carried the weight of experience. If she said it was all up with Bao-yu, it must
be all up with him. There was a horrible sickening sound as she vomited up the
medicine she had just taken, followed by a dreadful paroxysm of silent coughing that
seemed to rack every nerve and fibre of her body. She coughed until her face was
scarlet and her hair was in disorder, until her eyes bulged and the veins stood out on
her forehead, coughed until she was so breathless that she was unable to lift her face
up from the bed. Nightingale at once began thumping her, but Dai-yu raised herself
with an effort from the pillow and, after struggling for some moments to regain her
breath, pushed her away:
‘Don’t do that. Get a rope and strangle me - that would be kinder!’
‘But I didn’t say anything,’ Nightingale protested. ‘I was only joking. He must have
taken me seriously.’
‘Surely you know better by now than to joke with him?’ said Aroma. ‘He’s such a
fool, he always takes everything seriously.’
‘Whatever it was you said to him,’ said Dai-yu, ‘you’d better go over there straight
away and unsay it. That might bring him back to his senses.’
Nightingale climbed hurriedly off the bed and accompanied Aroma to Green Delights.
Unfortunately Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang were also there when they arrived. At
the sight of Nightingale, Grandmother Jia’s eyes flashed angrily.
‘Wicked creature! What did you say to him?’
‘I didn’t say anything,’ said Nightingale. ‘I was only pulling his leg.’
There was a sudden ‘Aiya!’ from the bed. It was Bao-yu, who had just caught sight of
Nightingale and who now, to everyone’s relief, burst into tears.
Grandmother Jia seized hold of Nightingale and thrust her towards him. She
supposed that Nightingale had offended Bao-yu in some way and that he would find
relief in beating her. To her surprise, instead of doing any such thing, he clung to her
imploringly:
‘If you’re going, take me with you!’
No one could make head or tall of this until Nightingale had been questioned and
explained to them the nature of her hoax.
‘So that’s all it was!’ said Grandmother Jia in tears. ‘And I was thinking it must be
something serious!’ She chided Nightingale, but less unkindly now: ‘You’re normally
such a sensible girl. Surely you know he’s inclined to be a bit simple at times? What
on earth possessed you to tease him like that?’
Aunt Xue urged a less serious view of Bao-yu’s derangement:
‘It’s true that he is a simple-hearted child; but his Cousin Lin came here when they
were both little and they have grown up together and are closer to each other than
any of the other children. I think you would expect him to be upset, suddenly out of
the blue like that being told that she was going away. Never mind a simple-hearted
child, I should think even a sophisticated grown-up would be! This isn’t a serious
illness, Lady Jia. I’m sure you and my sister have no reason to feel worried. A dose or
two of medicine and he’ll be perfectly all right again.’
Just at that moment the wives of Lin Zhi-xiab and Lai Da were announced, ‘come to
see how the young master was’.
‘How thoughtful of them!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them to come in.
But at the sound of the name ‘Lin’ Bao-yu began threshing about wildly on the bed,
calling out that the Lins had come to fetch Dai-yu and insisting that they should be
sent away.
‘Yes, send them away,’ said Grandmother Jia, while at the same time she did her
best to soothe him: ‘There, there, there. That wasn’t anyone from the Lin family. The
Lins all died out long ago. There aren’t any of them left to fetch her. Don’t worry!’
‘I don’t care who it was,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I don’t want any Lins here, apart from Cousin
Lin.’
‘There aren’t any Lins here,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘All the Lins in this place have
been sent away.’
   She turned to the servants:
   ‘In future Lin Zhi-xlao’s wife is not to be allowed inside the Garden. And I don’t
want the word “Lin” to pass your lips even. Is that clearly understood, everyone?’
   ‘Yes, madam,’ the servants replied in chorus, not daring to laugh.
   Presently Bao-yu’s eye chanced to light on a little metal self-propelling boat - a
West Ocean toy - which stood on one of the alcove shelves in the carved partition.
Immediately he became excited again.
   ‘Look!’ he said, pointing, ‘the ship that’s come to fetch her - that’s where they’ve
docked it, over there.’
   At a hurried order from his grandmother, Aroma took it down from the shelf. He
held his hand out to receive it, and as soon as it was in his possession, hid it under
the quilt, chuckling with satisfaction as he did so:
   ‘They won’t get away now!’
   All this time he continued to hold tightly on to Nightingale with his other hand.
   The doctor’s arrival was announced and Grandmother Jia gave orders that he
should be brought in immediately. Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the girls withdrew into
the inner room. Grandmother Jia herself continued to sit beside Bao-yu on the edge
of the bed. As her attendants also remained, there were a good many people in the
room when the doctor entered. It was Dr Wang. He paid his respects to the old lady
before proceeding to take Bao-yu’s pulse, mystified by the presence of a shame-faced
Nightingale, who, unable to leave Bao-yu’s side, could only stand there and hang her
head.
   After feeling the pulse for a while, Dr Wang rose to his feet.
   ‘The young gentleman is suffering from a delirium caused by a phlegmatic
occlusion of the cardiac orifices. The ancients recognized three main types of this
form of dementia: in the first type the delirium is associated with an anaemic
deficiency, when the body is failing to absorb its nourishment; in the second, it is
brought on by some violent emotional disturbance, such as anger; in the third, the
occlusion occurs as a result of shock. This is a delirium of the third type. In this type,
fortunately, the occlusion is only a temporary one, so it is less serious than the other
two.’
‘Just tell us whether it’s dangerous or not,’ said Grand mother Jia. ‘We’re not asking
you for a treatise on medicine.’
Dr Wang laughed deprecatingly and bowed:
‘He’ll be all right.’
‘Will he really be all right?’
‘Unquestionably,’ said the doctor. ‘I give you my word for it.
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Then perhaps you will go outside now and write
your prescription. If he recovers, I promise you a handsome reward, and Bao-yu
himself shall bring it to you and kotow to you when he brings it. But if he doesn’t get
better, I shall have the main hall of the College of Physicians pulled down about your
ears!’
‘How kind! How kind!’ The doctor, bowing and smiling at the prospect of a
‘handsome reward’ and Bao-yu kotowing at his feet, could not have heard the threat
which followed, for he continued to say ‘How kind!’ after it had been uttered and left
the room pursued by a wave of laughter.
The medicine he prescribed was soon concocted and Bao-yu did, after taking it,
become a good deal calmer. But he would not release Nightingale.
‘If she goes,’ he said, ‘I shall know that they are leaving for Soochow.’
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang saw that there was nothing for it but to let
Nightingale stay with him. Amber was sent to look after Dai-yu in her place. Dai-yu’s
other maid, Snowgoose, was kept busy running to and fro for news of Bao-yu’s
condition. By evening this was sufficiently improved for Grandmother Jia and the
other visitors to feel that they could return to their own apartments. They continued
to inquire after him by messenger, however, throughout the course of the night.
Nannie Li came again, bringing Mamma Song and several other old nannies to help
watch over him. Nightingale, Aroma, Skybright and Musk kept up a constant vigil at
his bedside throughout the night. From time to time Bao-yu would drop off, but
invariably he would wake up with a start from some dream and tearfully announce to
them either that Dai-yu had already gone or that people had come to take her away.
Each time this happened Nightingale was the only one who could calm him.
Grandmother Jia had sent over various nostrums -pills and powders she had heard
recommended as sovereign specifics in cases of mental disorder - and they used
these to dose him with when he woke up.
Next day, after another dose of Dr Wang’s medicine, Bao-yu was distinctly better. His
mind was clear now, but because he did not wish to lose Nightingale yet, he
pretended that it was still affected. Nightingale regretted what she had done and
bore the antics of this pseudo-madman and the weariness of waiting on him both
night and day with uncomplaining fortitude.
‘It’s only right that you should have to nurse him, seeing that you were the one
who set him off,’ said Aroma, relieved that Bao-yu was only play-acting. ‘You should
have known better. He’s a case, this young master of ours. Tell him the wind’s
blowing on a fine day, and next minute he can hear the rain! Heighho! What he’ll be
like when he’s grown up doesn’t bear thinking of!’
But she did not pursue the subject.
*

Xiang-yun had by now recovered completely and could drop in daily to see how
Bao-yu was progressing. As soon as he seemed normal, she treated them all to an
imitation of his madness. Her mimicry was so droll that even Bao-yu had to laugh,
shamefacedly, into his pillow. He had no recollection of what he had been like when
it all started and now, when they told him, he did not believe them.
Once, when no one was about, he took Nightingale’s hand in his own and drew her
to him.
‘Why did you scare me like that?’
‘I was pulling your leg,’ said Nightingale. ‘It was only a joke, but you took it
seriously.’
‘That was no joke,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It was too well-reasoned.’
Nightingale laughed.
‘I made it all up. There’s no Lin family - leastways, if there is, they’re very, very
distant relations, and not in Soochow, either, but scattered all over the place, in
different provinces. And even if one of them did come to take her away, Her Old
Ladyship would never let her go.’
‘I wouldn’t, even if she did,’ said Bao-yu.
‘I wonder,’ said Nightingale. ‘I think you’re only saying that. You’re not a child any
longer now. You’re already betrothed. Another two or three years, when you’re
married, you won’t have time for anyone else.’
Bao-yu heard her with astonishment.
‘Betrothed? To whom?’
Just before New Year I heard Her Old Ladyship say that she was betrothing you to
Miss Qin. That’s why she makes so much of her, isn’t it?’
Bao-yu burst out laughing.
‘Everyone calls me a simpleton, but you’re an even bigger simpleton than I am.
That was only a joke. Qin’s already betrothed to Academician Mei’s son. Do you think
I would have taken it so calmly if I had been betrothed to her? Don’t you remember
the scene we had last time, when I swore all those oaths and tried to break this
beastly thing’ - he pointed to his jade - ‘and you had such a job trying to stop me?
What are you trying to do? Start me off again?’
He ground his teeth.
‘If only I could die this minute and my heart burst out of my body so that you could
see how true it is! After that I shouldn’t care if all of me - flesh, blood and bones -
was burned to ashes, and the ashes turned to smoke, and the smoke blown by the
winds into every corner of the earth!’
Big tears rolled down his cheeks. Nightingale covered his mouth up in alarm; then, as
she wiped his eyes for him, she spoke to him soothingly as to a child:
‘There, there. There’s no need to get so worked up about it. I’m the one who needs
to worry. That’s why I said those things: to test you.’
‘You?’ said Bao-yu in surprise. ‘What have you got to be worried about?’
‘You know I never belonged to the Lin family, don’t you,’ said Nightingale. ‘I was
originally one of Her Old Ladyship’s servants, like Faithful and your Aroma. I was
transferred to Miss Lin, but as it turned out I got on very well with her -ten times
better, as a matter of fact, than the maid she brought with her from Yangchow - and
since then we’ve become inseparable. Lately I’ve been worried by the thought that
she might have to leave here - in which case, of course, I should want to go with her.
But all my family is here. If I didn’t go with her, it would seem like a betrayal after
what we’ve been to each other all these years. On the other hand if I did go, it would
mean leaving my family behind. I wasn’t sure about how serious you were in wanting
her to stay. That’s why I made those things up. I wanted to test you. I never imagined
you were going to make such an uproar, or I wouldn’t have said them.’
‘So that’s what was worrying you!’ said Bao-yu, smiling. ‘Well, you are a simpleton.
Please don’t worry about that any more. Let me try to put it for you in a nutshell. In
life we shall live together; in death we shall mingle our dust. How will that do?’
Nightingale said nothing, but appeared to be thinking. One of the old women came in
to announce that Jia Huan and Jia Lan had come to inquire after Bao-yu’s health.
‘Tell them it’s very kind of them,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but not to come in here, because
I’ve only just gone to sleep.’
‘Very good,’ said the old woman, and went off to relay the message.
‘Now that you’re better,’ said Nightingale, ‘you ought to let me go back to see how
my other invalid is getting on.’
‘Yes, you’re right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I was meaning to tell you last night that you could
go back, but I forgot. I am completely better now. You can go back straight away.
Nightingale began tying up her bedding and getting her toilet things together.
‘I notice you’ve got several mirrors in your vanity box,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why don’t you
give me that little one with the pattern of caltrops on it as a keepsake? I can keep it
by my pillow to use when I’m in bed, and it will be handy to take with me when I go
out.’
Nightingale gave him the mirror, then, having first arranged for someone to carry
over her things, took leave of the other maids and returned on her own to the
Naiad’s House.
During the past few days Dai-yu’s anxiety for Bao-yu had led to a relapse and had
been the occasion of several fits of weeping. On inquiring nervously why Nightingale
had returned, she was relieved to hear that it was because Bao-yu was better. As
Amber’s services were now no longer needed, she sent her back to Grandmother Jia.
That night, when all the others had gone to bed and she had undressed and was lying
not far off from her mistress, Nightingale addressed her, in guarded undertone, on
the subject of Bao-yu’s intentions.
‘Bao-yu really is a simple soul. Do you know what made him ill? It was because he
heard that we were going away.’
Dai-yu said nothing. After waiting in vain for a reply, Nightingale went on as if
speaking to herself.
‘Much better stay where we are. You couldn’t ask for a better family than this. And
the two of you have grown up together and know each other’s likes and dislikes.
Where else would you find someone who understood you so well?’
Dai-yu snorted at her disgustedly.
‘Aren’t you tired after all your exertions during these last few days? I can’t
understand why, instead of chattering away to yourself, you don’t take this
opportunity to get a bit of rest.’
‘It isn’t lust chatter,’ said Nightingale. ‘I’m concerned about your future, Miss. It’s
been worrying me for years. You’ve no father or mother or brothers: there’s no one
else who will concern themselves about it. The important thing is to get it all
properly settled while Her Old Ladyship is still well and in her right mind. You know
what they say: “Good health in the old is like warm weather in winter: you can’t
depend on it.” If anything were suddenly to happen to her, the chance of getting
someone you really liked would have passed you by. No doubt they would do their
best to marry you to some?one of good family, but look how many of these young
aristocrats keep concubines, and how changeable they are in their affections. Some
of them if they were married to the Queen of Heaven would tire of her in a week.
And neglect is not the worst part of it; often there are hard words and harsh
treatment to follow. When that happens, if the wife has a powerful family to stick up
for her, it isn’t so bad; but what about someone in your position? As long as Her Old
Ladyship is alive you’ll be all right, but once she’s gone, you’ll be at everyone’s mercy.
That’s why I say we’ve got to make our minds up.

Easier a golden hoard to win
Than find one understanding heart.

You’re a clever young lady. I’m sure you must know that saying.’
‘This girl’s gone out of her mind,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Just these few days away and she’s
come back completely altered. I shall have to tell Her Old Ladyship about this
tomorrow and get her to take you back. I’m afraid you can’t stay with me any longer.’
‘I meant no harm,’ said Nightingale. ‘I’ve only told you to think about it; I haven’t
asked you to do anything wicked. Why should you tell Her Old Ladyship? It’ll only get
me into trouble, and what good will that do you?’
She said no more, and presently went to sleep.
Not so Dai-yu. However she might have concealed the fact from Nightingale, she was
deeply affected by what the maid had said, and while Nightingale slept beside her,
she lay awake weeping through the greater part of the night. The darkness was
beginning to lighten when she finally dropped off to sleep. Washing that morning
required an effort. Not long after she had finished her bird’s nest syrup, Grandmother
Jia came in person to see her and waxed eloquent on the importance of getting well.

*

It was Aunt Xue’s birthday and everyone from Grandmother Jia downwards sent her
a present. Dai-yu looked out two little articles of her own embroidering to send her.
Aunt Xue hired a troupe of child actors and threw a birthday party which everyone
except Bao-yu and Dai-yu attended. Grandmother Jia took everyone to call on them
both on her way hack from it.
Next day there was another party for the employees of the Xue family at which Xue
Ke acted as host on his aunt’s behalf. There were more festivities on the day which
followed. Altogether three or four days were spent just in celebrating the one
birthday.
Aunt Xue was very impressed with what she had seen of Xing Xiu-yan. She was such a
refined, serious girl, in spite of her unfortunate upbringing: the very model of ‘virtue
in homespun and a wooden hairpin’. Aunt Xue had thought of her as a possible
daughter-in-law, but when she reflected on the lawless nature of her son, it seemed a
pity that so nice a girl should be thrown away on him. She was still trying to make her
mind up about this when suddenly it occurred to her that Xue Ke was not yet
betrothed and that he and Xiu?-yan would make an ideal couple. She decided to ask
Xi-feng for her advice. Xi-feng was enthusiastic.
‘But you know how difficult Lady Xing can be,’ she said. ‘Why don’t you leave it to
me, Auntie? Let me deal with it in my own time.’
She found her opportunity of broaching the subject when Grandmother Jia next
came to call on her.
‘There’s something my Aunt Xue wants you to do for her, Grannie, but she’s a little
bit shy of asking.’
‘Oh? What’s that?’ said Grandmother Jia.
She laughed when Xi-feng explained.
‘Good gracious, that’s nothing to be shy about! It’s a splendid idea. Let me have a
talk with your mother-in-law about this. She won’t refuse, I promise you.’
As soon as she was back in her own apartment, she summoned Lady Xing and
proposed the match to her, urging its suitability in forceful terms.
Lady Xing did some rapid thinking: the Xue family were of respectable origins; they
were immensely rich; Xue Ke was a good-looking boy; and Grandmother Jia was
making herself responsible for the match. Confident that she would be able to turn it
to her own advantage, she assented, to Grandmother Jia’s intense satisfaction,
without more ado. The presence of Aunt Xue was now requested and the
self-abasing civilities customary on these occasions exchanged between her and Lady
Xing. When these had somewhat abated, Lady Xing sent someone to inform Xing
Xiu-yan’s parents, Xing De-?quan and his wife, of the Xue family’s proposal. Living as
they now did on Lady Xing’s charity, they were scarcely in a position to refuse even if
they wanted to, and the messenger was soon back again reporting their prompt and
enthusiastic acceptance.
‘I love meddling in other people’s affairs,’ said Grandmother Jia jovially. ‘I seem to
have meddled successfully in this one. I hope I am going to be paid something for my
services.’
‘Of course,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘The only difficulty will be knowing how much to give
you. What shall we say? Ten thousand taels? Probably you would regard that as too
little! What we really need is a sponsor to settle these matters for us.’
‘We may be short of manpower in this family,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘but I dare say
we could rustle up a couple of cripples for you!’
She sent someone to fetch You-shi and her daughter-in-law from Ning-guo House. As
soon as they arrived, she explained why she had invited them, whereupon they
turned to the other two ladies and offered them their congratulations.
‘Now,’ said Grandmother Jia when they had finished, ‘you know our way of doing
things in this family, don’t you - you know we never haggle about bride-prices and
“face” and that sort of thing? We want you to act as a third party and settle this for
us. What we want is a settlement that is not too lavish and yet not too economical:
something between the two. And when you’ve worked out what each of the parties
should contribute, come and tell me what you have decided.’
You-shi promptly agreed to do this. Aunt Xue, delighted that everything had gone off
so well, hurried home and at once had a formal invitation to act as marriage-sponsor
drawn up and sent over to Ning-guo House to confirm the arrangement.
You-shi knew Lady Xing too well to want to be mixed up in any affairs - particularly
one of a pecuniary nature - to which she was a party. She had agreed in this instance
only because Grandmother Jia had asked her to and she could not very well refuse. In
the event she simply arranged matters in the way she thought would best please
Lady Xing. Aunt Xue was a very accommodating person and could be relied on to fall
in with almost any terms. But it is not with details such as these that our narrative is
concerned.
Aunt Xue's betrothal of her nephew to Xing Xiu-yan was soon common knowledge
throughout the household. At first Lady Xing wanted to segregate the girl by moving
her in with herself, but Grandmother Jia objected.
'Surely she can stay where she is? She can't see anything of the boy, of course, but
surely there's no harm in her con?tinuing to see Mrs Xue and Bao-chai and little Qin?
They're all females, after all. It will be cosier if they get to know each other better.'
Lady Xing did not renew her offer.
And what of the parties themselves? Xue Ke and Xing Xiu-yan had met briefly on the
journey to the capital and there was no reason to suppose that they were not
extremely pleased with the betrothal. Inevitably Xiu-yan became a little more
withdrawn after it, spending rather less of her time in Bao-chai's and Bao-qin's
company and speaking, when she was in it, rather more sparingly. But this was partly
because Shi Xiang-yun was such a tease. Fortunately she was far too intelligent and
well-bred to indulge in any of that false modesty, so common among girls in her
position, which shows itself in affected simpering and ridiculous grimaces.
Ever since the day they first met, Bao-chai had felt sorry for Xiu-yan. First of all she
was so poor. And then there was her father. Unlike most of the fathers that Bao-chai
knew about - grave gentlemen who had gained wisdom with their years - Xiu-yan's
father was a drunken sot who took little interest in his daughter's welfare. As for Lady
Xing, Bao-chai could see that the affection she showed her niece was simu?lated and
that really she did not care for her in the least. And Ying-chun, whose apartment she
shared, was too docile to assert herself even on her own behalf, let alone anyone
else's.
Since Xiu-yan was too proud to ask for things, this meant that whenever anything
was lacking, even one of the simple necessities of life, she had simply to go with out
it. Knowing this, Bao-chai did all she could to anticipate her wants; but she gave by
stealth, careful lest Lady Xing, who was sensitive to gossip, if to nothing else; should
get to hear of it.
Xiu-yan had learned to cherish Bao-chai as a special friend long before this
magnificent betrothal so wildly beyond her own and everyone else's expectations
and, after it, continued from time to time to confide in her. Bao-chai for her part
continued to treat her as an intimate friend and would use none of the formalities
that are customary between prospective sisters-in-law.
One day, when Bao-chai was on her way to visit Dai-yu, she caught sight of Xiu-yan,
who, as it happened, was also on her way there. Bao-chai smiled and beckoned and
waited for Xiu-yan to catch up with her. The two girls then walked on together until
they came to the rear side of a miniature moun?tain of rock. There, where no prying
eyes could see them, Bao-chai stopped again.
'The weather is still really cold. Why have you changed Out of your winter clothes
already and put on single linings?'
Xiu-yan hung her head and said nothing. Ba-chai guessed at once that she had been
forced to pawn them.
'It must be because you haven't had this month's allowance yet,' she said. 'How could
Cousin Feng be so thoughtless?'
'No,' said Xiu-yan. 'She didn't forget. She paid the allow?ance on time. But Aunt Xing
sent someone to tell me that she thought I didn't really need two taels a month and
that I ought to contribute one of them towards my parents' upkeep. She said that if
there ever was anything I needed, I could always hent it from Cousin Ying's things' -
suppressed emotion was causing her to lapse into her native dialect -'But I ask you,
coz, how could I? Cousin Ying wouldn't mind - she is so meek - and she probably
wouldn't notice, any road. But though she wouldn't say anything, you can be quite
sure that the servants would. The nannies and maids in that apart?ment are such a
prickly lot and so spiteful with their tongues. Although I am living there, I dare not
ask them to do very much for me, and even for what little they do I am expected to
find money to buy them drinks and other little treats with every four or five days.
Even when I was getting two taels it wasn’t enough, and now it’s only one. The only
way of raising money I could think of was by pawning my winter clothes. I got
someone to slip out and do it for me the other day.’
Bao-chai sighed.
‘It’s a pity all the Mei family areaway just now. Academician Mei isn’t due back
from his posting until the year after next. if they were here in town, Bao-qin could
get married straight away and then we could go ahead with your affair and get you
out of this mess. But as things are, your Prospective will never consent to get married
before his sister, so the difficulty remains. I shall have to have a word with Mamma
about this. Obviously you can’t go on as you are. Another year or two like this and I
am afraid you will go into a decline.
‘In future, if those people are nasty to you, you must learn to put up with it. You
mustn’t make yourself ill trying to please them. Perhaps you had better hand over
the whole of your remaining tad to them when it comes: see if that will keep them
quiet. But don’t go treating them any more, whatever you do. Never mind the
spiteful things they say to you. If it gets too bad, you can always walk away. And if
you are short of anything, don’t behave like a little frightened mouse; ask me straight
out for it, without delay. I say this not because we are future sisters-in-law but
because we are friends. We are friends, aren’t we, and have been ever since you
came? If you are afraid of gossip, don’t come yourself when you want something,
send your maid for it, then no one will know.’
Xiu-yan hung her head and the reply she made was scarcely audible. In order to
change the subject, Bao-chai pointed to a green jade girdle-ring that was hanging
from her waist.
‘Who gave you that?’
‘Cousin Tan,’ said Xiu-yan.
Bao-chai nodded.
‘She must have noticed that all the other girls were wearing one of these things
and wanted to spare you the embarrass?ment of being the only one without. It is
typical of her to be so thoughtful. However, I think you ought to realize that these
sort of gewgaws are really for the daughters of mandarins and noblemen. Look at me:
you don’t see any jewellery on me. A few years ago, it’s true, I would have been
smothered with it; but I know now that we are less well off than we used to be, and
have given up wearing it as a means of economizing. No doubt when you marry you
will be provided with a whole trunkful of this stuff, In the meantime, though, we
don’t need to compete with the others in finery, you and I. As long as we are honest
and remain true to ourselves, it doesn’t matter that we cannot equal them in
appearance.’
Xiu-yan smiled.
‘In that case, I shall go back and take it off,’ she said.
‘Don’t be so precipitate,’ said Bao-chai. ‘She meant it as a kindness. If she sees you
not wearing it, she will wonder why. I spoke only in general terms, for your future
guidance.’
Xiu-yan murmured her assent.
‘Where are you going now, coz?’ she asked Bao-chai.
‘To the Naiad’s House,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Why don’t you go back now and get your
maid to bring me that pawn ticket? I’ll send someone out on the quiet to redeem the
things for you and get them round to you in the evening without anyone knowing, so
that you can begin wearing them again as soon as possible. We don’t want you
catching cold in this wind, do we? Oh, there’s just one other thing: where did you
pawn them?’
‘I think it’s called the “Reliant”,’ said Xiu-yan. ‘It’s in Drum Tower Street West.’
Bao-chai laughed.
‘Well, at least they’ve stayed in the family. If the assistants realized where they had
come from, they must have thought they were receiving an advance instalment of
your trousseau!’
Xiu-yan coloured, realizing that the ‘Reliant’ must be one of the Xue family’s
businesses. She did not say anything, however, but with a little laugh hurried back to
look for the pawn ticket.
Bao-chai continued on her way to the Naiad’s House. She arrived to find her mother
already ensconced and in the midst of conversation with Dai-yu.
‘Mamma, what a surprise! When did you arrive?’
‘I’ve been so busy during these last few days that I haven’t had time to see her or
Bao-yu. Today I decided to see both of them, but both of them seem to be better.’
Dai-yu urged Bao-chai to be seated.
‘The world’s affairs are very mysterious,’ she said, by way of bringing her into the
conversation. ‘Who would ever have thought that your mother and Aunt Xing would
end up as commeres?’
‘My child,’ said Aunt Xue, ‘you are too young to understand these things. Old folk
talk about “the unseen thread that binds”. They say that marriages are decided by an
Old Man Under the Moon who joins future couples together by tying them round the
ankles with a scarlet thread, and that once he’s done that, it doesn’t matter how far
apart they are, even if there are oceans between them, sooner or later something
will happen to bring them together and they will end up husband and wife. These
things are quite unpredictable. Sometimes there will be two young people whose
parents on both sides are favourable to their union, who have lived years together in
the same place, and who take it as a foregone conclusion that they are going to
marry, yet if the Old Man Under the Moon hasn’t tied them with his scarlet thread,
then in spite of everything, they never will. Take you two girls, now: we don’t know
whether at this moment the two young men you will marry are right here under our
noses or somewhere “south of the mountains and north of the sea”!’
‘Mamma!’ said Bao-chai, burying her head in her mother’s dress, ‘how you do
always drag one in when you get talking!’
‘Look at her!’ said Dai-yu, mockingly. ‘What a great baby! She’s ever so poised and
grown-up when you aren’t here, Auntie. It’s only when she’s with you that she puts
on this little girl act.’
Aunt Xue stroked the recumbent head, still buried in her lap, and sighed indulgently.
‘I suppose it’s a bit like Cousin Feng and your grandmother. Chai can be perfectly
serious with me when things need dis?cussing, but at the same time she knows the
little ways of cheering me up - she knows that when she becomes my little girl again,
it helps me forget my troubles.’
It was Dai-yu’s turn to sigh now. A tear rolled down each cheek.
‘I don’t know why she has to do it here though unless she wants to rub in the fact
that I haven’t got a mother.’
‘Oh Mamma, just listen to that!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Who’s putting on a little girl act
now?’
‘You mustn’t blame her for being upset,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Poor child! She has no
one.’
She stroked Dai-yu’s hair and tried to comfort her.
‘Don’t cry, my dear. You mustn’t be upset because I make a fuss of your cousin. I’m
as fond of you, you know- perhaps even more so. Although Chai has no father, she
has got me and Pan so you see I know that you have the greater need. She knows
how fond I am of you, because I am always telling her. The only reason I don’t show it
more is because there are a lot of people in this household who are always ready to
put a false construction on things. If they saw me being nice to you, they would say
that I did it not for the very obvious reason that everything about you cries out to be
loved and that one can hardly help loving you, but because I saw how much your
grandmother loves you and wanted to curry favour with her.’
‘You say you love me as much as Chai,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Let me be your god-daughter
then. Don’t refuse, Auntie, or I shall think you don’t really mean it.
‘If you will have me for your godmother, I should like nothing better.’
‘Out of the question,’ said Bao-chai flatly.
‘But why?’ said Dai-yu.
Bao-chai smiled mischievously:
‘Tell me, why do you think Cousin Xing was betrothed to my Cousin Ke? Why wasn’t
she betrothed to my brother, who is Cousin Ke’s senior and who still hasn’t got a
be?trothed?’
‘I suppose because your brother is away,’ said Dai-yu, ‘or perhaps their horoscopes
are incompatible.’
‘No,’ said Bao-chai, ‘that’s not the reason. It’s because someone has already been
chosen for my brother. We are only waiting for him to come home to make it public. I
don’t need to name names. If I tell you that you can’t possibly become Mamma’s
god-daughter, you ought to be able to work it out for yourself.’
She winked at her mother and broke into a laugh.
This time it was Dai-yu who buried her face in Aunt Xue’s bosom.
‘Beat her, Auntie, beat her - I insist!’
Aunt Xue hugged her niece, laughing:
‘You mustn’t believe what she says. She’s only teasing.’
‘No, seriously, Mamma,’ said Bao-chai, ‘why don’t you ask Lady Jia some time if you
can have Cousin Lin for your daughter-in-law? You will never find a better one
elsewhere.’
Dai-yu threw herself on Bao-chai and made as if to scratch her:
‘Have you gone quite mad?’
Aunt Xue laughingly held them apart.
‘If I thought that your brother was not good enough for Xiu-yan - which is why I
betrothed her to your cousin Ke -I certainly wouldn’t inflict him on this child here.
Not so long ago Lady Jia was asking me about Bao-qin as a possible match for Bao-yu,
but I had to tell her that Bao-qin was already betrothed - not that otherwise it
wouldn’t have been a very good match. The other day, when we’d finished discussing
Ke and Xiu-yan’s betrothal, she began teasing me about it. “Last time, when I wanted
one of her girls,” she said, “I couldn’t have her; and now here she is snapping up one
of ours!” She was only joking, of course, but I could see that she was thinking about
Bao-yu still and half inviting me to make a suggestion. I rather wish now that I had.
She is so concerned about him, and he is such a peculiar boy. You can’t see him
getting on with some girl chosen for him from outside. I think much the most
satisfactory arrangement would be to betroth him to your Cousin Lin here.’
Dai-yu, who up to this moment had been listening open-mouthed, turned scarlet at
the mention of her own name and with a cry of rage threw herself again on Bao-chai.
‘I’ll kill you! You deliberately led Auntie up to this.’
‘How ridiculous!’ said Bao-chai, laughing. ‘It’s Mamma who said it, not I. What are
you hitting me for?’
Already Nightingale had darted forward:
‘If that’s what you think, Mrs Xue, why don’t you talk to Her Old Ladyship about it?’
‘Goodness, child, you are impatient!’ said Aunt Xue, laughing, ‘I suppose if you are
in such a hurry to get your mistress married, you must be thinking of a little husband
for yourself!’
‘Mrs Xue!’ said Nightingale, crimson-faced. ‘You ought to know better at your age!’
She turned and fled.
Dai-yu who, when Nightingale intervened, had angrily bidden her to mind her own
business, now gloated over her discomfiture:
‘Holy Name, it serves you right! You would poke your nose in, wouldn’t you, and
now you’ve got smut on it!’
There was a burst of laughter in which the maids and serving-women joined. They
were still laughing when Xiang- yun ran into the room, brandishing a piece of paper.
‘What sort of bill is this?’
Dai-yu examined the paper but could make nothing of it. The women below had
recognized it, however, and tittered with amusement.
‘That’s a nice thing for a young lady to be carrying! they said. ‘If you want to know
what that is, Miss, you’ll have to pay for the lesson!’
Bao-chai snatched the paper from Xiang-yun’s hand and looked. It was Xiu-yan’s
pawn ticket. She hurriedly folded it away.
‘It looks like a pawn ticket that one of the women must have dropped,’ said Aunt
Xue. ‘Whoever it is will be worried when she misses it. Where did you pick it up?’
‘What’s a pawn ticket?’ Xiang-yun asked her.
The women laughed:
‘What a simpleton! Fancy not knowing what a pawn ticket is!’
‘It’s hardly surprising,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘She’s had a very aristocratic upbringing,
don’t forget, and in any case she is still very young. How could she know about pawn
tickets? What occasion would she ever have of seeing one? In the household she
comes from even if one of the servants had such a thing, they would take very good
care that she didn’t see it. You shouldn’t call her a simpleton. I doubt very much
whether any of your own young ladies would know a pawn ticket if she saw one.’
‘That’s true,’ said the women, smiling. ‘Miss Lin here didn’t know, so you can be
quite sure the others wouldn’t. Even Bao-yu, although he goes outside quite a lot,
has probably never seen one.’
Aunt Xue now explained what a pawn ticket was. Xiang?yun and Dai-yu laughed
incredulously.
‘The things people do for money! Is that what they do in your pawnshops, Aunt?’
‘That’s a funny question!’ said the women, laughing. ‘All crows are black, you know.’
‘Where did you find this?’ Aunt Xue asked again.
But before Xiang-yun could reply, Bao-chai interrupted:
‘It’s an old ticket, Mamma; it was cancelled years ago. Caltrop has been using it to
fool them with.’
Aunt Xue believed her and did not pursue the matter.
Shortly after that a messenger arrived from the Ning-guo mansion to say that You-shi
would ‘like a word when convenient with Mrs Xue’ and Aunt Xue got up and left
them. As soon as she had gone, Bao-chai asked Xiang-yun where she had found the
ticket.
‘I saw Xiu-yan’s maid Signet handing it, very furtively, to Oriole and Oriole slip it
between the pages of a book. They thought I hadn’t noticed. I had a peep when
they’d gone, but I couldn’t make out what it was, and as I knew you were both here, I
thought I would come over and see if either of you could make anything of it.’
‘But why should Cousin Xing be pawning her clothes?’ said Dai-yu, puzzled. ‘And
why, having pawned them, should she want you, Chai, to have the ticket?’
Bao-chai saw that Xiu-yan’s circumstances could no longer be concealed and
explained to them both what had happened. Dai-yu, feeling ‘the fox’s sympathy for
the hunted hare’, was much distressed, but Xiang-yun’s reaction was one of anger.
‘I’m going straight over to see Ying-chun about this,’ she said. ‘You’ll feel better,
both of you, when I’ve given those beastly servants a piece of my mind.’
   She would have gone, too, had not Bao-chai restrained her.
   ‘Are you out of your mind? Sit down and stay where you are.’
   ‘If you were a man,’ said Dai-yu, laughing, ‘you could go around like a knight-errant
putting the world to rights; but a Jing Ke in skirts is just plain ridiculous!’
   ‘All right then,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘if you won’t let me talk to Cousin Ying about it,
let’s simply have Xiu-yan over to live with us.’
   ‘We’ll talk about that tomorrow,’ said Bao-chai. A servant put her head round the
door to make an announce?ment:
   ‘Miss Tan and Miss Xi have called.’
   Hearing of their arrival, the three in the room fell silent.
   For further details of the visit our reader is referred to the next chapter.




CHAPTER 58

In which the cock-bird who mourns his mate
Is found to be a hen
And a true heart is able to sympathize
with a strange kind of love



Our last chapter concluded with Tan-chun’s and Xi-chun’s arrival at the Naiad’s House,
which put a sudden stop to the discussion of Xiu-yan’s affairs by the other three.
Conversation was renewed after the new arrivals had inquired about Dai-yu’s health,
but of a general, unserious nature, and shortly afterwards all four visitors took their
leave and went their separate ways.
*

The Dowager Consort of the late Emperor whose illness we referred to in an earlier
chapter had now passed away and all noblewomen and wives of officials resident in
the capital had to put on the mourning appropriate to their rank and present
themselves at the Palace. A Special Edict was published prohibiting the holding of
musical or dramatic entertainments by persons of rank for a period of one year and
banning the celebration of marriages between commoners for a period of three
months. Every day Grandmother Jia together with Lady Xing, Lady Wang, You-shi and
Jia Rong’s wife Hu-shi had to go to the Palace to take part in the ceremonies of
mourning, seldom returning until well after two o’clock in the afternoon.
   These ceremonies, which took place in one of the side halls of the Palace, were
due to last for twenty-one days, at the end of which time the body of the Consort
was to be conveyed to the late Emperor’s mausoleum in Goodson prefecture, a
distance of some ten days’ journey from the capital. On reaching there, the coffin
was to lie in state for several more days while further ceremonies were performed
preliminary to its final interment in the mausoleum. The whole expedition, from start
to finish, would take about a month. Cousin Then and You-shi were both supposed to
take part in it, which would mean that throughout that period both the Ning-guo and
Rong-guo mansions would be left masterless. A family council was held and it was
decided, in order that one person at least should be left in charge of the two
mansions, to petition for You-shi’s exemption on the grounds that she was enceinte.
At the same time Aunt Xue’s help was enlisted to keep an eye on the young people.
For this purpose it was essential that she should move into the Garden; but it was
something of a prQblem to know in which of its buildings she should stay. Bao-chai
already had Xiang-yun and Caltrop living with her; Li Wan was having to
accommodate Bao-qin, whom Grandmother Jia had placed temporarily in her care,
and though Mrs Li and her girls were still at their uncle’s place in the city, they too
were constantly dropping in on her and staying for three or four nights; Ying-chun
was sharing with Xu-yan; Tan-chun was fully occupied with household business, and
in any case the noisy bickering of Aunt Zhao and Jia Huan, who were constantly
coming round to pester her, would have made her apartment a highly unsuitable
place for Aunt Xue to live in; and Xi-chun’s place was too small. That left only the
Naiad’s House for her to move into.
Aunt Xue did so the more readily because, in discussing these arrangements with her,
Grandmother Jia had impressed upon her that Dai-yu was the young person most
particularly in need of her care. And besides, Aunt Xue had always had a very great
affection for Dai-yu. Now that they shared the same apartment she was able to give
her undivided attention to Dai-yu’s welfare - to seeing that she had good food and
enough of it, and that she took her medicines at the proper times. Never before had
Dai-yu been so well looked after. She responded with a gratitude deeper than words,
though it was by words that it was most often expressed: Aunt Xue was now her kind
‘Mamma’, and when Bao-chai and Bao-?qin were present, she addressed them and
referred to them exactly as if they were her elder and younger sisters. Grandmother
Jia, who had been worried at the prospect of being separated, even for a month,
from her orphaned granddaughter, was both relieved and happy to observe this new
development.
Aunt Xue, now that she was in the Garden, concerned herself only with the welfare
of the cousins and disciplining of their maids; in other domestic matters, however
important, she was unwilling to intervene. You-shi, too, although she visited the
Rong-guo mansion daily, did little more than hear the roll-call and was most unwilling
to exercise any real authority. As the only responsible person left in it she already had
her hands full with the affairs of the other mansion and was kept extremely busy
seeing that the temporary lodg?ings near the Palace which Grandmother Jia and the
other ladies retired to in between ceremonies were kept regularly supplied with food
and bedding and so forth.
While the senior members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo mansions were so busy, the
stewards and stewardesses of the two mansions were no less occupied, some of
them in accompanying their mistresses each day to and from the Palace, some in
attending to the provisioning and maintenance of the temporary lodgings, and some
as an advanced party who staffed the lodgings in readiness for their mistresses’
arrival.
Lacking the discipline normally imposed by these officers, the domestics of both
mansions who remained behind grew slovenly in their duties or took advantage of
the exceptional circumstances to ally themselves with those placed temporarily in
charge as a means of scoring off fellow-servants. Of the male staff at Rong-guo House
only Lai Da and one or two others remained. Nearly all Lal Da’s most trusted
lieutenants had gone. Owing to their inexperience he was finding the replacements
he had made extremely unserviceable -and so stupid: their peculations were so
transparently gross, their reports so patently unreliable, their recommendations so
obviously biased; he would have had difficulty in enu?merating all the defects he
found in them or the troubles they caused him.
At this time all the great families which kept troupes of actors or actresses in their
households were beginning to disband them. Hearing this, You-shi, after discussing
the matter with other members of the family, approached Lady Wang with the
suggestion that their own troupe of actresses should be disbanded. The method by
which she proposed to do this was economical.
‘We have, of course, bought these girls,’ she said. ‘Although they can’t keep up their
music, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t use them as maids. It’s only really the
instructors that we need to get rid of.’
‘No,’ said Lady Wang firmly. ‘We cannot treat them like servants. These are
daughters of free men, sold into their profession because their parents could not
afford to keep them. They have given us a year or two of good entertainment. Now
that this opportunity of releasing them has arisen, we ought to give them each a few
taels and let them go. That was cer?tainly what our ancestors would have done; and I
do not believe that we have become quite so degenerate or so un?generous that we
cannot, in this matter at least, follow the ancestors’ example. It’s true that we have a
few members of an earlier troupe still living with us; but there was a special reason
for their staying. They didn’t want to go, so we gave them employment and found
husbands among the staff for them when they were old enough to marry.’
‘Very well, we shall ask them,’ said You-shi. ‘If they want to go, we can send for
their parents to come and fetch them and give the money to their parents. That will
be safest. Otherwise we shall have all sorts of dubious characters turning up here to
collect them and selling them when they get them outside, and our kindness in
freeing them will be wasted. Of course, any of them who don’t want to go can stay
with us.’
Lady Wang agreed and You-shi sent someone to Xi-feng to explain what had been
decided. She also instructed the clerks in the counting-house to pay eight taels to
each of the in?structors and tell them that they were free to go where they liked. The
costumes, theatrical properties and other movables in Pear Tree Court were carefully
checked against the inventories and stored away and a caretaker was put in charge of
the buildings.
As for the little actresses, on interviewing them individually, You-shi found that hardly
any of them wanted to go. Some said that their parents were alive but did not care
for them and would only sell them again if they went back to them; others that they
had no parents and had been sold by uncles or brothers; others that they had no
relations at all that they could go to; others that they had become attached to the Jia
family and did not want to leave. In the end all but three of them elected to stay.
After what she had said, Lady Wang could scarcely refuse to have them.
The three who were leaving were taken away by their foster-mothers to stay with
them for the time being until their real parents could come to fetch them. Those who
had chosen to stay were assigned to different apartments - mostly in the Garden - as
servants. Elegante, the leader of the troupe1 was reserved for Grandmother Jia; the
'leading lady', Parfumee, went to Bao-yu; Etarnine, the soubrette, to Bao-chai; the
'principal boy', Nenuphar, to Dai-yu; Althee, the leading 'painted face', to Xiang-yun;
Cardamome, the second 'painted face', to Bao-qin; Artemisie, who specialized in old
men's parts, to Tan-chun; and You-shi asked if she might keep Aubergine, who
specialized in old women's parts, for herself.
The little actresses, though nominally in service, did nothing all day but wander
about happily in the Garden, like uncaged birds rejoicing in their new freedom.
Nobody made much effort to discourage them, as it was understood that they were
wholly unaccustomed to waiting on other people and were none of them able to sew.
It is true that one or two of them had the good sense to see that the future would be
bleak for them without a craft, now that their theatrical training had been
discontinued, and who applied themselves to learning domestic skills like sewing and
spinning; but they were the exception.
An important day in the obsequies of the late Consort arrived when it was necessary
for Grandmother Jia and the other ladies to start out for their temporary lodgings
near the Palace at four o'clock in the morning. After recruiting themselves there with
a small collation, they proceeded to the Palace to attend the ghostly breakfast of the
Deceased. When that was over, they went back to their lodgings and had lunch. Then,
after a brief rest, they returned to the Palace and remained there for both the None
and Vesper offerings. Then back to their lodgings again for dinner before finally
return?ing home.
The temporary lodgings were in the family temple of a high official in which
perpetual devotions were maintained by a sisterhood of Buddhist nuns. The nuns
occupied the two courtyards to east and west of the shrine-hall, but there were a
great many spare rooms in these courtyards, all of them kept scrupulously clean by
the nuns. The Rong-guo ladies had rented the rooms in the east courtyard and the
Prince of Bei-jing's ladies those in the west one. As they had to leave for the Palace
and return from it at the same times, the two lots of ladies had plenty of
opportunities of meeting each other, and many courtesies were exchanged between
them. But it is not with these outside matters that we are concerned.
Back, then, to the Garden. With Grandmother Jia and Lady Jia away for so much of
the day and the prospect of their being away altogether during the month it would
take them to travel to and from the mausoleum, there were a great many maids and
womenservants with nothing much to do but wander about in it enjoying themselves.
Their numbers were augmented by the women from Pear Tree Court, who were now
attached to different apartments in the Garden. Suddenly there seemed to be dozens
more people about in it than there ever had been before.
The girl-actresses were arrogant little creatures, imperious and tyrannical towards
the servants, demanding and fastidious about their food and clothing, sharp and
disputatious with their tongues - in a word, thoroughly difficult characters to deal
with. The Pear Tree Court women all hated them, but had not hitherto dared to
quarrel with them openly. To these women the closing of the drama school was a
great relief. Some of them, in their gladness to be free of it, were willing to let
bygones be bygones. Others, less magnanimous, still nursed their rancour but, the
diaspora having separated them from their former charges, dared not carry warfare
against them into another's territory.
It was the day of the Spring Cleaning festival and Jia Lian, having prepared the usual
offerings, had gone with Jia Huan, Jia Cong and Jia Lan to the Temple of the Iron
Threshold outside the city to clean the family graves. Jia Rong, accompanied by a
party of clansmen from the Ning-guo side of the family, had set out separately for the
same destination. Of the young male members of the family only Bao-yu, having not
yet wholly recovered from his illness, was unable to go. After lunch Aroma noticed
that he was showing a disposition to sleep.
‘It’s such a fine day,’ she said, ‘why don’t you take a stroll in the Garden? If you lie
down as soon as you’ve eaten, you won’t digest your food.’
Bao-yu stepped somewhat reluctantly into a pair of slippers and, supporting himself
with a walking-stick, shuffled off through the courtyard and out into the Garden.
Care of the Garden and its produce had lately been put into the hands of female
experts and, this being the busy tune of year for gardeners, they were t6 be observed
on every hand, trimming the bamboos, pruning trees and bushes, bedding plants Out,
planting bulbs and sowing seeds. Other women were moving over the surface of the
lake in punts, dredging up mud from the bottom and planting lotus-roots. On a
miniature mountain of rock overlooking the lake an appreciative audience consisting
of Xiang-yun, Caltrop, Bao-qin and some of the maids sat watching them. As Bao-yu
slowly made his way up to them, Xiang-yun cried out in mock alarm:
‘Quick, send the boats away! They’ve come to take Cousin Lin!’
Bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly.
‘People can’t help what they do when they’re ill. You shouldn’t make fun.’
‘It’s your fault for being so comical,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why do you always have to be
so different? Even your illnesses are different from everyone else’s.’
Bao-yu sat down with them for a while and watched the women working.
‘It’s a bit windy here,’ said Xiang-yun presently, ‘and the rock is rather cold to sit on.
Don’t you think you ought to go indoors?’
Bao-yu had already decided that he would like to go and see Dai-yu, so, hauling
himself up with his walking-stick, he took his leave of the girls and walked off, over
Drenched Blossoms Bridge and along the embankment on the other side.
New growth hung from the weeping willows in strings of gold and the blossom-buds
of the peach-trees had burst into a vermilion haze; but the big apricot-tree behind
the rockery, its flowering past, was already in full leaf and covered with tiny apricots,
each no bigger than a pea.
‘What a shame!’ he thought. ‘Just those few days in bed and I missed the apricot
blossom.

And in among the green leaves now
The young fruit hangs from every bough.

He stood and gazed at the tree. They were Du Mu’s lines, written on his last visit to
Hu-zhou, when he met the beautiful young dancer of a dozen years before and found
that she was now a married woman with a brood of children. How did it go?

The spring-time blossoms, white and red,
Before the thieving wind have fled;
And in among the green leaves now
The young fruit hangs from every bough.

He thought of Xing Xiu-yan’s betrothal. It would only be a year or two now before she
married, and soon she too, like the girl that Du Mu wrote about, would be a mother
with a brood of young children about her. People had to marry, of course: they had to
reproduce their kind. But what a way for a lovely young girl to end!

The spring-time blossoms, white and red...

Not so many years from now her jet-black tresses would turn to silver and her rosy
cheeks become wrinkled and colourless. The thought of it made him feel sad and an
involuntary sigh escaped from him. Then, as he continued to gaze at the tree, a little
bird flew up, and perching on one of its branches, began to sing away for all it was
worth. Bao-yu’s day-dreaming took another turn.
‘That bird must have come here when the tree was in blossom,’ he told himself.
‘What he’s singing is a lament at finding the blossoms gone. You can tell it’s a lament
by the sound. Pity Gong-ye Chang, who understood the language of birds, isn’t
around! I could have asked him what it was saying. I wonder if it will remember to
come here next year when the apricot-tree is in flower again?’
His reverie was interrupted by a sudden burst of flame beyond the rockery which
caused the bird to fly off in alarm. Bao-yu was almost as startled as the bird. The brief
crackle of flames was followed by an outburst of angry shouting.
‘Nenuphar, you little wretch, how dare you burn paper offerings here in the Garden!
I’m going straight off to report you. You’re in for a whipping, my girl.’
Wondering what on earth could be happening, Bao-yu hurried round to the other
side of the rockery to investigate. A tear-stained Nenuphar crouched on the ground,
holding the chafing-dish with which the recent blaze had been kindled, and gazing
with a sorrowful expression at the charred, still smouldering remains of a pile of gold
paper ‘spirit money’.
‘Who’s it for?’ he asked her. ‘You really shouldn’t burn it here, you know. I suppose
it must be for one of your parents -or is it for a brother, perhaps? Tell me the person’s
name and I’ll get my boys to go out and buy a proper baofu for you and write the
name on it.’
When she saw that it was Bao-yu, Nenuphar closed her lips tightly and no amount of
questioning would elicit an answer from her. Just then the woman he had heard
shouting came hurrying back, an evil expression of triumph on her face, and seized
hold of the girl.
‘Well, I’ve reported you to the young mistresses,’ she said, ‘and they’re very, very
angry.’
Nenuphar was still only a child. Terrified of the humiliation that awaited her, she now
made a childish attempt to resist going.
‘I said all along you were getting above yourselves,’ said the woman. ‘You can’t do
as you please in here like you could outside. It’s different here. We like to have a bit
of law and order.’ She pointed to Bao-yu. ‘Even Master Bao has to abide by the rules.
I don’t know what sort of a young madam you think you are to come along here and
start breaking them. Come on! It’s too late to start being afraid now. You’ll have to
come along and see them.’
‘That’s not spirit money,’ said Bao-yu hurriedly. ‘It’s waste paper she’s been burning
for Miss Lin. You should have looked more carefully before you reported her.’
To Nenuphar in her desperation Bao-yu’s appearance on the scene had been an
added terror. She could hardly believe her ears when she heard him covering up for
her. Her fear gave way to a surprised delight and she plucked up courage to defend
herself.
‘Yes, what makes you so sure it was spirit money? That was used writing-paper of
Miss Lin’s.’
But the woman was unimpressed. Stooping down, she picked out one or two of the
unconsumed fragments from the ashes.
‘Don’t argue with me! Here’s evidence! You’ll have to come with me to the jobs
room and explain yourself to them there.’
She took hold of Nenuphar by the sleeve and begun dragging her off; but Bao-yu
held her by the other sleeve and struck at the woman’s hand with his walking-stick
until she let go.
‘Take those bits of paper to them if you must,’ he said. ‘I suppose I shall have to tell
you. Last night I dreamed that the Spirit of the Apricot-tree came to me and said that
if I wanted to get better quickly, I must have an offering of spirit money made to her.
She said it had to be made by a stranger, not by anyone from my own room, and no
one else must know about it. And now, after I’ve been to the trouble of getting the
stuff and finding this girl to make the offering for me, it’s all wasted, because you saw
her doing it. This is the first day I’ve been up since my illness. If I get ill again now, it
will be your fault. Do you still want to take her? Nenuphar, go with her and see them.
Tell them exactly what I have just said. And when my grandmother gets back I shall
tell her what happened. I shall tell her that this woman interrupted you deliberately.’
Nenuphar was by now thoroughly cock-a-hoop. Now it was she who was tugging at
the woman. The woman threw the bits of paper to the ground and addressed herself
beseechingly to Bao-yu, a sickly smile on her face:
I didn’t know, really I didn’t. If you tell Her Old Ladyship that, it will be all up with
me.’
‘Don’t report back then, and I won’t tell her.’
‘But when I reported just now, they said I was to bring her,’ said the woman. ‘I’d
better tell them she’s been called away by Miss Lin.’
Bao-yu thought for a bit and then nodded. The woman went off to do as she had said.
When she had gone, Bao-yu resumed his questioning.
‘Who was it for then? I’m sure it wasn’t for anyone in your family. Is it a secret?’
Nenuphar was grateful to Bao-yu for having protected her. Knowing now that he was
a kindred spirit and to be trusted, she could hardly refuse him any longer. There were
tears in her eyes when she answered:
‘Besides myself there are only two other people in the world who know about this:
Parfumee in your room and Etamine in Miss Bao’s. After what happened today, I
think I shall have to let you be a third; but you must promise never to speak about it
to anyone else.’
She began to cry.
‘It’s no good,’ she said. ‘I can’t say it to your face. After you’ve got back, when
there’s no one else around, you can get Parfumee to tell you.’
She slipped away then, leaving him full of curiosity.
Continuing his walk to the Naiad’s House, he found Dai-yu looking thinner than ever
but feeling, she assured him, very much better than she had been a few days earlier.
She noticed how much thinner be had become, and the recollection of what had
caused them both to look so haggard provoked the shedding of a few tears. They had
not been speaking for more than a few minutes when, mindful that he was still
convales?cent, she urged him to go back and rest and he felt obliged to obey her.
When he got back, he was anxious to ask Parfumee about Nenuphar’s secret, but
Xiang-yun and Caltrop had just arrived and were engaged in lively conversation with
her and Aroma in the adjoining room. Fearing that if he called her to him the others
might ask questions, he resolved to be patient.
After a while Parfumee went off with her foster-mother to have her hair washed. Her
foster-mother had already let her own daughter wash her hair in the water. When
Parfumee noticed this, she was loud in protest.
What, give me the water your daughter’s washed in? Considering you take the whole
of my monthly allowance, I think I deserve better than left-overs!’
Angry - the more so because she was in the wrong - the woman shouted back at her.
‘Ungrateful little wretch! I’m not surprised they say players are hard folk to handle.
However good a person may be to start with, once they get into that profession,
they’re ruined. You’d never think a scrubby little creature like this could have so many
airs and graces. Nothing but the best for young madam! Sixes or aces, nothing else!
And such a spiteful, sharp little tongue if she doesn’t get what she wants! Worse than
a biting mule!’
The two of them began to go at it then, hammer and tongs. Aroma Sent someone
outside to quieten them:
‘A little less shouting, you two! Just because Her Old Ladyship isn’t here, nobody
seems able to say anything without hollering at the tops of their voices!’
‘It’s that Parfumee making trouble,’ said Skybright. ‘I don’t know what makes her
think she’s so wonderful. Just because she knows a few plays, you’d think she’d won
the war or something!’
‘It takes two to make an argument,’ said Aroma. ‘The older one shouldn’t be so
unjust and the younger one shouldn’t be so unpleasant.’
‘You can’t blame Parfumee,’ said Bao-yu. “‘Any departure from the straight or even
causes things to give voice.” A famous philosopher wrote that. She’s here without
parents or anyone to look after her. This woman takes her money and then doesn’t
treat her properly. If that’s not a departure from the straight and even, I don’t know
what is. You can hardly blame her for giving voice about it! How much does she get a
month, anyway?’ he asked Aroma. ‘Wouldn’t it save a lot of trouble if you took the
money and looked after her yourself?’
‘I don’t mind looking after her,’ said Aroma, ‘but if I do, it certainly won’t be for the
money. It wouldn’t be worth making enemies over.’
She got up as she said this and, going into the other room, took a little bottle of Oil of
Flowers, some hen’s eggs, some soap and a hair-string and told one of the old
women to convey them to Parfumee outside.
‘Tell her to stop quarrelling. Tell her she can get some more water and wash her
own hair with these.’
Unfortunately the foster-mother chose to regard this as a public humiliation for her
and grew even angrier.
‘You wicked child,’ she said to Parfumee’, ‘pretending that I keep back your money!’
She dealt her a couple of slaps, whereupon Parfumee burst out crying. Bao-yu was
about to rush outside, but Aroma restrained him.
‘What are you doing? I’ll speak to her.’
But Skybright had already darted outside and was pointing at the woman angrily:
‘You ought to know better, at your age! If we give her the things to wash her hair
with that you wouldn’t give her yourself, you ought to feel ashamed. I don’t know
how you can have the face to hit her. You wouldn’t have dared hit her if she’d been in
the school still, carrying on with her training.’
‘I hit her for trying to show me up in public,’ said the woman. ‘I’m her foster-mother.
I’ve a right to.’
‘Musk,’ said Aroma, ‘I’m no good at arguing with people and Skybright is too
excitable. You’ll have to go and deal with her.’
Musk hurried over.
‘All right, all right. There’s no need to shout. Let me just ask you this one question.
When have you ever seen anyone punishing their daughter in the master’s or
mistress’s presence - I don’t lust mean here, I mean anywhere in the whole Garden?
Even in the case of a real daughter, not just a foster-daughter, once she’s left home
and gone into service it’s for her master or mistress to punish her or the senior maids.
We can’t have parents chipping in all the time - otherwise how should we ever
manage to train a girl? I don’t know! You people, the older you get, the worse you
seem to behave! It’s not so long ago that we had Trinket’s mother in here making a
scene. I suppose she must be your model. But don’t worry. During these last few days
what with this one ill and that one ill and Her Old Ladyship busy all the time with
other matters we haven’t had a chance to report anything. But give us a few more
days. We shall find an opportunity. We’ll tell her everything. Then perhaps we shall
see some of you high?handed people taken down a peg. And another thing. There’s
Bao-yu in there only just beginning to get better - even we daren’t raise our voices
above a whisper - yet here are you hitting a girl outside his room and making her cry
like a howling wolf or a banshee. The top people only have to be away from the
house for a day or two and already you are behaving as if you were above the law. No
one is safe from you. A few more days and you’ll be hitting us, I shouldn’t wonder! If
you ask me, you’re the sort of foster-mother the girl could do without. If you think
the plant will only flourish with your tender care, you’re very much mistaken!’
Bao-yu was so angry that he banged on the threshold with his stick.
‘These old women have hearts of stone. It’s bad enough that they can’t look alter
the girls, but to go maltreating them as well ...!

Almighty earth and heaven, what’s to do?’
‘What’s to do?’ said Skybright. ‘Send the lot of them packing, useless baggages!’
The woman, shamed into silence by Musk’s tirade, made no reply.
Musk looked at Parfumee, in her crabflower-red padded tunic and patterned green
silk trousers unbound at the ankles, her glossy black hair hanging down her back,
crying as if her heart would break. It was a spectacle so different from her more
familiar stage appearances that Musk could not help laughing at its incongruousness:
‘I must say, you don’t look much like Cui Ying-ying at the moment. Reddie after her
beating, though: now that’s a part you could play without having to make up for it!’
Skybright led Parfumee away and washed her hair for her. When she had towelled it
dry, she did it up for her in a ‘lazy knot’ and told her to go back to Bao-yu’s room
when she had finished dressing.
Shortly after, a woman arrived from the kitchen to say that the food was ready,
should they send it over yet? One of the junior maids went inside to ask Aroma.
‘What does the clock say?’ Aroma asked. ‘With all that rumpus going on outside, I
didn’t hear it strike.’
‘It didn’t,’ said Skybright. ‘The wretched thing needs repairing again, I don’t know
why.’
She fetched a watch from somewhere and inspected it.
‘It’s about half a cup of tea off dinner-time,’ she said. ‘Tell them we’ll be ready
directly.’
The girl went off to relay this message.
‘Come to think of it,’ said Musk, smiling, ‘that Parfumee deserved a slap or two for
being so mischievous. She was the one who made the clock stop by playing about
with the pendulum yesterday.’
She began getting things out and laying them in readiness for the meal. Presently
junior maids carrying food-boxes came into the room and stood there while
Skybright and Musk removed the covers and inspected the contents: a bowl of soup
and the now familiar rice-gruel flanked by four different kinds of pickle.
‘But he’s better now,’ said Skybright. ‘How much longer has he got to go on eating
gruel and vegetables in brine? Why can’t they send him some proper food for a
change?’
Musk had finished laying now. Taking the large bowl of soup (ham and
bamboo-shoots) from the food-box, she put it on the table for Bao-yu to try. He bent
down over the bowl and slurped up a mouthful.
‘Ow, hot!’
Aroma laughed.
‘Holy Buddha! You’re not all that starved for meat, surely? I’m not surprised you
burn yourself if you go at it so greedily.’
She picked up the bowl and gently blew on it, then, as Parfumee happened to be
standing by, she handed it to her:
‘Here, you can do it. You may as well make yourself useful, instead of mooning
around all day doing nothing. But blow on it gently: we don’t want you spitting in it.’
Parfumee began blowing as instructed. She seemed to be managing very nicely, but
the foster-mother, who was standing outside the partition doorway whither she had
insisted on coming ‘to help’ and who, in her ignorance of the Garden’s etiquette, saw
this as an opportunity of making up to the maids, came hurrying officiously into the
room and tried to take the bowl from her.
‘She’s too inexperienced. She might drop it. Let me blow.’
Skybright shouted at her angrily:
‘Get out of here at once! Whether she breaks the bowl or not is our affair: we don’t
need you blowing on it, at all events. Who said you could come inside the partition,
any?way?’
Her anger transferred itself to the junior maids:
‘Young idiots! She probably doesn’t know about these things. You ought to have
told her.’
‘We tried to keep her out,’ the maids protested. ‘We tried to tell her, but she
wouldn’t believe us. Now do you believe us?’ they asked the woman. ‘Even the
places we’re allowed into you’re only allowed into about half of’ but you seemed to
think you could go bursting in even where we aren’t allowed to go - and you were
shouting and waving your hands at us when we tried to stop you.’
They hustled her from the outer room, into which she had retreated, onto the
verandah outside. The old women waiting in the courtyard below to take back the
food-boxes and empty bowls laughed at her when she emerged.
‘You should ‘a taken a look at yourself in the mirror before you went inside,
missus!’
The woman, angry and ashamed, had to bear their taunts in silence.
Parfumee was still blowing away at the soup. Bao-yu smiled at her:
‘Don’t destroy your lungs with all that blowing! Why don’t you try it now, to see if
it’s all right?’
Parfumee thought he must be joking and smiled timidly at Aroma and the rest.
‘Go ahead, taste it!’ said Aroma. ‘Why not?’
‘Watch me taste it,’ said Skybright, and took a sip from the bowl.
Encouraged by her example, Parfumee took a sip too.
‘It’s all right,’ she said, and handed Bao-yu the bowl.
Bao-yu drank about half the soup, ate a few pieces of bamboo-shoot, consumed half
a bowlful of the gruel, and declared himself satisfied. The servants cleared away. A
little maid came in with a wash-bowl. After he had washed his hands and rinsed his
mouth out, it was Aroma’s and the other senior maids’ turn to have their dinner.
Bao-yu signalled to Parfumee with his eyes. A sharp-witted child - one, moreover,
who had spent several years of young life in a school of drama - Parfumee responded
like an old trouper. She had a stomach-ache, she told them. She didn’t feel like any
dinner.
‘Oh well, if you’re not eating,’ said Aroma, ‘you may as well stay and keep him
company. We’ll leave the gruel here. If you get hungry, you can eat some of that.’
She and the other maids then left.
Bao-yu was now able to tell Parfumee about his encounter with Nenuphar - how he
had lied to protect her and how, feeling unable to answer his question herself, she
had referred him to Parfumee for an explanation.
‘So who was she making the offering for?’
Parfumee’s eyes reddened slightly and she sighed.
‘Oh, Nenuphar is crazy.’
‘Why?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What do you mean?’
‘It was for Pivoine,’ said Parfumee, ‘the girl in our troupe who died.’
‘There’s nothing crazy about that,’ said Bao-yu, ‘if they were friends.’
‘Friends!’ said Partumee. ‘They were more than that. It was Nenuphar’s soppy
ideas that started it all. You see, Nenuphar is our Principal Boy and Pivoine always
played opposite her as Principal Girl. They became so accustomed to acting the part
of lovers on the stage, that gradually it came to seem real to them and Nenuphar
began carrying on as if they were really lovers. When Pivoine died, Nenuphar cried
herself into fits, and even now she still thinks about her. That’s why she makes
offerings to her on feast-days. When Etamine took over the roles that Pivoine used to
play, Nenuphar became just the same towards her. We even teased her about it:
“Have you forgotten your old love then, now that you’ve got yourself a new one?”
But she said, “No, I haven’t forgotten. It’s like when a man loses his wife and
remarries. He can still be faithful to the first wife, as long as he keeps her memory
green.” Did you ever hear anything so soppy in your life?’
‘Soppy’ or whatever it was, there was a strain in Bao-yu’s own nature which
responded to it with a powerful mixture of emotions: pleasure, sorrow, and an
unbounded admiration for the little actress. He took Parfumee’s hands in his own
and told her with great earnestness what she must say to Nenuphar.
‘Tell her never, never to use that paper stuff again. “Spirit money” is a superstitious
invention of modern times: you’ll find nothing about it in the teachings of Confucius.
All she needs to do when feast-days come round is to light a little incense in a burner.
Provided that it’s done with reverence, that’s all that’s needed for conveying one’s
feelings to the dead. It’s the sincerity with which we make the offering, not the
offering itself that counts. You see that burner on the table over there? Whenever I
want to remember someone dear to me - it doesn’t necessarily have to be on a
feast-day or any particular day, by the way - I light some incense in it and put out a
cup of fresh tea or water, or sometimes some flowers or fruit if I have any. You can
even use “unclean foods”- as long as they’re devoutly offered: that’s the important
thing. Tell her not to go burning that paper stuff any more.’
Parfumee promised. After that she finished off the gruel. Then someone came in to
say that Grandmother Jia had got back.
Of that you shall hear more in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 59

By Willow Walk the conservers of property
resort to violence and abuse
And at Green Delights the defenders of law and order
invoke a higher authority



Hearing that his grandmother and the other ladies were back, Bao-yu put on an extra
garment and shuffled off, walking-stick in hand, to greet them. He found them tired
out by the taxing routine of the past few days and anxious to retire to bed as soon as
possible. Nothing of interest happened during that night. The ladies were up again at
four o’clock next morning and off once more to the Palace.
The date of their departure for the mausoleum was fast approaching. Faithful, Amber,
Parrot and Pearl busied themselves getting together the things that Grandmother Jia
would need on the journey, while Silver, Suncloud and Sunset did the same for Lady
Wang. When all was ready, they went over everything, item by item, with the most
senior of the servants who were accompanying their mistresses. There were
altogether sixteen of these: six maids and ten older women. The male servants, who
are not included in that number, were meanwhile preparing the mule-litters that
their mistresses would ride in and getting the harness and other gear into good order.
Faithful and Silver were not among the sixteen. They were to stay behind and look
after their mistresses’ apartments while they were away.
Some days before the funeral cortege was due to set out, the maids packed up the
covers and hangings of their mistresses’ travelling-beds. These were collected by a
party of four or five women, who, with the aid of some men?servants, took them by
cart through the back streets to the lodgings where their mistresses were to spend
the night be?fore their departure and put them up ready for them to sleep in.
The Jia ladies and their retinue left the mansion the day before the cortege was due
to start. Grandmother Jia and Jia Rong’s wife shared the first litter; Lady Wang
followed on her own in the second; Cousin Zhen and the menservants provided them
with a mounted escort. Then followed several large covered carts in which the maids
and womenservants were travelling. The carts also carried a large number of bundles
containing changes of clothing for the ladies. The other members of the family, led by
Aunt Xue and You-shi, accompanied the little procession as far as the outer threshold
of the main gate to see the old lady off.
While the column was reforming itself in the street, Jia Lian appeared on horseback
at the head of a small party of mounted grooms. He shepherded his parent’s litters
into place between those of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, then, fearful of the
possible consequences of leaving the baggage train with its female freight unguarded,
trotted back to a position behind the carts and, with his mounted followers, brought
up the rear.
Inside the mansion Lai Da greatly increased the numbers of the watch and ordered
the entrances to the two main courtyards to be kept permanently closed. Anyone
wanting to go in or out of the mansion now had to do so through the small side gate
on the west corner. The ornamental gate dividing the outer from the inner part of the
mansion was closed at sundown. So, too, were the main and side gates of the Garden.
The gate which the cousins normally used for getting into or out of the rear part of
Lady Wang’s quarters and the gate on the east side which gave access to the corner
gate of Aunt Xue’s courtyard were left open. Since they affected only the
intercommunication of the already sealed-off inner parts of the mansion, it did not
seem necessary to close them. Faithful and Silver shut up the living-rooms normally
occupied by their mistresses and went to sleep with the other maids in the servants’
quarters at the back. Each day at sundown Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife conducted a party of
ten or so senior women into the Garden to police it during the night. The number of
pages employed in the gallery outside for the purpose of sounding the night-watches
was increased. Everything was done, in short, to ensure that the security of the
mansion was maintained.
*

Waking one fine, fresh morning from vernal slumbers, Bao- chai, on raising the
bed-curtain and stepping down into the room, became sensible of a very slight
chilliness in the air, the reason for which was apparent when she opened the door
and looked out. A little shower, falling in the last watch before dawn, had refreshed
the earth and turned the mosses everywhere a more brilliant shade of green. She
went in again and called to the others to get up.
While they were washing, Xiang-yun complained of an irritation in her cheeks which
she feared might herald an outbreak of the mild eczema she sometimes suffered
from and asked Bao-chai for some rose-root orris to put on them.
‘I gave the last of it to Qin a few days ago,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Frowner has a lot. I had
been meaning to ask her for some, but as I haven’t had any trouble with my own
cheeks this year, I forgot about it.’
She ordered Oriole to go and get some. As Oriole was about to leave, Etamine said
that she would like to go with her because she wanted to talk to Nenuphar. The two
girls set off from All-spice Court, chattering and laughing as they went.
At Willow Walk they followed the line of the embankment. The trailing golden strings
of the weeping willows were already flecked with emerald.
‘Do you know how to weave things with these?’ Oriole smilingly asked her
companion.
‘What sort of things?’ said Etamine.
‘Oh, things to look at, things to use - all sorts. Just wait while I break off a few and
I’ll weave a little basket out of them. I’ll leave the leaves on, then, if we fill it with
different kinds of flowers, it will look ever so pretty.’
Temporarily forgetting about the orris-powder, she reached up and broke off some of
the tender willow-twigs. She got Etamine to hold them for her; then, as they walked
along together, she plaited them into a little basket. From time to time she stopped
to pick a flower or two that grew beside the way. The finished basket was a pretty
little open-work one with a handle, bursting all over with the greenery which she had
been careful not to pull off. When it was filled up and stuck all over with flowers, it
looked really charming. Etamine was enraptured:
  ‘Oh, Oriole, do let me have it!’
  ‘We’ll give this one to Miss Lin,’ said Oriole. ‘We can pick some more twigs on the
way back and I’ll make baskets like this for you all.’
By this time the two girls had arrived at the Naiad’s House. Dai-yu had not yet
completed her toilet. She was very much taken with Oriole’s handiwork.
‘Ah, a living basket! Who made it?’
‘I did,’ said Oriole. ‘It’s for you, miss.’
‘Oh, but it’s charming!’ said Dai-yu, taking it. ‘No wonder they’re always saying how
clever you are with your hands.’
After admiring it a little longer, she told Nightingale to hang it up where she could see
it
Oriole first inquired politely after Aunt Xue and then asked Dai-yu about the
rose-orris. Dai-yu told Nightingale to wrap some up for her.
‘I’m better now,’ she told Oriole as she handed her the packet. ‘I feel like going out
today for some exercise. Tell Chai that there’s no need for her to pay her call on
Mamma today or to visit me. As soon as I’ve done my hair, Mamma and I will be
coming over to her place. We can have our lunch there. We shall be quite a little
family party!’
Oriole promised to relay the message and went into Nightingale’s room to collect
Etamine; but Etamine and Nenuphar had just reached the most interesting part of
their conver?sation and were most unwilling to be separated. Oriole pro?posed a
solution to Nightingale.
‘Your mistress is going over to our place presently. Why not let Nenuphar come
with us now and wait for her there?’
‘By all means,’ said Nightingale. ‘She gets up to so much mischief, we shall be glad
to have her off our hands for a bit!’
She got out Dai-yu’s spoon and chopsticks, wrapped them up in a napkin of West
Ocean linen, and held them out for Nenuphar.
‘Here you are: you can take these for her. May as well make yourself useful.’
Nenuphar took the things from her and set off, smiling happily, with the other two.
They made their way to Willow Walk again and Oriole broke off a lot more twigs and,
sit?ting down on a nearby rock, began straightway plaiting them to make into
another basket. She told Etamine to go ahead with the rose-orris and come back for
her presently when she had delivered it; but both girls were fascinated by Oriole’s
skilful weaving and could not tear themselves away. Oriole threatened to suspend
work on the basket if Etamine did not do as she was told.
‘Come on,’ said Nenuphar. ‘I’ll go with you. We can hurry back in no time.’
After they had gone, while Oriole sat plaiting on her own, Mamma He’s daughter
Swallow walked up and smilingly asked her what she was making. Oriole was still
talking to her when the other two got back. Swallow looked at Nenu?phar curiously.
‘Tell me, what was that paper you were burning the other day when my Aunt Xia
caught you? She was going to report you, but Bao-yu made out that it was she who
was in the wrong, so she couldn’t go through with it. She was ever so angry. She
came and told my mother all about it. What on earth did you do during all that time
you were living out?side together to make such an enemy of her?’
Nenuphar sniffed.
‘I didn’t do anything. It’s because she’s so greedy. She can’t squeeze as much out of
me as she used to be able to. To mention nothing else, look at all the food she and
the others used to take home with them when they were working with us outside.
You know they did.’
Swallow laughed.
‘She’s my own aunt. I can’t very well criticize her in front of other people. I must
admit, though, it does seem to be as Bao-yu once said. “A girl before she marries is
like a price?less pearl, but once she marries the pearl loses its lustre and develops all
sorts of disagreeable flaws, and by the time she’s an old woman, she’s no longer like
a pearl at all, more like a boiled fish’s eye.” He said, “How can the same person, at
different times in her life, seem like three completely different people?” - Of course, I
knew at the time he was only talking his usual nonsense; but really there does seem
to be some truth in it. I don’t know about other people’s families, but it’s certainly
true of my mother and my aunt. The older they get, the more they seem to care
about nothing else but money. When we were all living together at home, they used
to com?plain that there weren’t any job for us that would bring in a bit of income.
Then this Garden was built and I was lucky enough to be among those who were
chosen to work in it -doubly lucky, in fact, because I was assigned to Green Delights.
That meant that quite apart from the fact that they didn’t have to find my keep any
more, they were getting an additional four or five hundred cash each month that I
managed to save out of my wages. You’d have thought they’d have been satisfied
with that, but oh no! Then they got jobs themselves, looking after these player-girls
in Pear Tree Court. My Aunt Xia had Nenuphar for foster-daughter and my mother
had Parfumee. So for this last year or two they’ve been really comfortably off. Now
that you’ve all moved inside, of course, it’s rather out of their hands; but they won’t
give up. It really makes you laugh. First my aunt having that row with Nenuphar, and
then my mother having that row with Parfumee. That was over the shampoo.
Parfumee had asked my mother I don’t know how many times to shampoo her hair
for her. Then Parfumee’s monthly allowance came in and my mother had no excuse
for putting her off any longer, so she bought the shampoo, but when she’d bought it,
she told me to wash my hair with it first. Well, I didn’t like to do that. I mean, I’ve got
money of my own, and even if I hadn’t, I could always get the stuff for washing my
hair with from Aroma or Skybright or Musk without any trouble by simply asking for
it. So I said no, I wouldn’t. So then she got hold of my younger sister and washed her
hair first. Needless to say, when she called Parfumee after that there was a quarrel.
Oh, and then she wanted to go and blow on Bao-yu’s soup. Oh dear, I could have died!
I told her about the rule as soon as I saw her going in, but she wouldn’t believe me.
Oh no, Mother knows best! So of course she made a fool of herself. It’s a good job
there are so many of us working in the Garden and no one can ever remember who
is related to who, otherwise they might get the impression that the people in my
family do nothing but quarrel all the time.’
‘Incidentally, this place where you’ve chosen to do your basket-making is on the
territory of another of my aunts - my father’s sister. Ever since she was put in charge
of it, she’s treated it as if it were her own property. She slaves away on it from
morning to night. What’s more, she makes me come and watch over it for her: she’s
so terrified of any of it getting spoiled. It’s got so that I can hardly do my own job
properly. And now that Mother’s moved into the Garden, she keeps an eye on it too.
The pair of them watch over it like hawks. No one else is allowed to touch a blade of
grass here. I don’t mind telling you, if they come along this way and find you’ve been
picking their flowers and breaking their young willow-twigs, they won’t be at all
pleased!’
‘In anyone else’s case, perhaps not,’ said Oriole; ‘but my case is different. When the
Garden was divided up, it was agreed that daily supplies of stuff from it were to be
sent to all the apartments. That included, apart from things to eat, flowers for
everyone’s hair and flowers to put in the vases. Now my mistress, it so happens, was
the only one who said she didn’t want a daily supply of flowers. She said she would
let them know whenever she wanted any, but up to now she never has. So you see,
in my case they are hardly likely to object even if they do find out that I’ve been
picking some.’
These words were scarcely out of her mouth when who should appear, hobbling
along on her stick, but this same aunt that Swallow had been talking about. Oriole
and Swallow invited her to come and sit down on the rock. The old woman felt a
pang of displeasure as her eye travelled from the little heap of broken willow-twigs to
the freshly-picked flowers that Nenuphar and Etamine were holding, but since it was
Oriole who appeared to be responsible, she forbore to complain of the vandalism
and found something to grumble at her own niece about instead.
‘When I tell you to come here and keep an eye on things, you prefer to stay at
home and play. Then when the others ask you to do something for them, you
pretend that you can’t because you’re already working for me. You use me like a
magic charm, so that you can do a disappearing act when?ever there’s a job of work
to be done!’
‘First you tell me to come here, then you’re afraid the others will want me so you
tell me off for being here,’ Swallow protested. ‘I can’t be in two places at once, aunt!’
‘Don’t you believe her, missus!’ said Oriole teasingly. ‘She’s the one who picked all
these things and pestered me to weave them for her. I tried to get rid of her, but she
wouldn’t leave me alone.’
‘For goodness sake!’ said Swallow agitatedly. ‘Don’t make jokes like that. She’ll take
you seriously.’
Alas, it was all too true! This aunt of Swallow’s was a stupid old woman whose senile
infatuation with money was such that beside it all human ties had long since ceased
to count. At Oriole’s words the pent-up anguish with which she viewed this hateful
spoliation of her domain found relief in action: she raised her stick and, with the
presumptuous tyranny of old age, struck Swallow several times with it across the
back.
‘Little baggage!’ she said. ‘How dare you answer me back! Your own mother hates
you so much she’s itching to get her teeth in you. Don’t you go raising your voice at
me!’
‘Oriole was only joking,’ said Swallow, weeping - partly from the pain and partly
from the humiliation of being beaten in front of the others. ‘Why should my mother
hate me? I haven’t burnt the washing-up water! What am I supposed to have done?’
Dismayed that her words should have had such an effect, Oriole stepped hurriedly
between them and seized the aunt’s upraised arm.
‘I was only joking, missus. Is it to shame me that you are beating her?’
‘I’ll thank you not to meddle in what doesn’t concern you, miss,’ said the old
woman. ‘Do you think I should not be allowed to discipline my own niece just
because you are here?’
The crassness of this reply caused Oriole to flush with anger.
‘You can discipline her any time you like, but I don’t see why you should choose to
do it when I make a joke,’ she said scornfully. ‘All right, go ahead and discipline her,
then.’
And releasing the old woman’s arm, she sat down on the rock again and got on with
her weaving.
The next thing that happened was that Swallow’s mother appeared on the scene,
looking for her daughter.
‘What are you doing there?’ she shouted as she caught sight of her. ‘I thought I told
you to go and fetch some water.’
‘Come over and see what she’s been doing,’ the old aunt shouted back at her. ‘I’ve
no hold over her any more than you now, it seems. She’s being very impertinent to
me.’
‘Oh, what’s she been doing this time, sister-in-law?’ said the woman, coming up to
them. ‘She’s got no use for her own mother any more, I knew that; but I thought she
might have a bit of respect left for you still.’
Recognizing the newcomer as Swallow’s mother, Oriole wanted to explain; but the
aunt did not give her a chance.
‘Look at that!’ she said, pointing to the willow-twigs on the rock. ‘A great girl like
her - you’d think she’d know better! And not content with that, leading other people
on to ruin me as well!’
Swallow’s mother was still smarting from her unsuccessful quarrel with Parfumee
and was angry with Swallow for not having taken her side.
‘Little strumpet!’ she shouted, bearing down on her wrathfully and slapping her
across the head. ‘How long now have you been working with those young madams? -
it hasn’t taken you very long to pick up their airs and graces! But don’t you go
thinking I can’t lay my hands on you any more. A foster-daughter’s one thing, but you
are my own flesh and blood. I can still look after you when I feel like it. Little painted
whores, telling me I can’t go inside where you can go! I wish you’d go inside and stay
there: perhaps if you stayed inside long enough, you might find a customer!’ She
grabbed hold of the little half-made willow basket and waved it in Swallow’s face.
‘And what’s this supposed to be? What’s the bloody meaning of this?’
‘I made that,’ said Oriole. ‘Don’t curse the mulberry tree when you mean the locust.
If it’s me you’re angry with, why not say so and leave her out of it?’
Swallow’s mother was intensely jealous of these senior maids like Oriole and Aroma
and Skybright, for she knew that their status and authority were greatly superior to
her own. She feared them and deferred to them, but doing so cost her a good deal of
angry resentment which she vented on the junior maids. On this occasion her anger
was further exacerbated by the presence of her sister’s enemy, Nenuphar.
Swallow was now making her way tearfully towards Green Delights. Her mother was
afraid that if they asked her there why she was crying and she told them, there would
be further insults to put up with from Skybright, so she hurried after her to try and
stop her.
‘You come back I’ she shouted. ‘You’ll go when I say you can.’
But Swallow refused to stop, and her mother, greatly incensed, rushed forward,
intending to lay hands on her. Swallow happened to turn and see her coming,
however, and got away by running even faster. Her mother, continuing the pursuit,
slipped on the moss and fell over, to the great delight of Oriole and the other two.
Oriole was by now so disgusted with the whole affair that she threw everything -
basket, twigs and flowers - into the water and went off home, leaving the old aunt
blessing her?self in pious horror at the waste.
‘Wicked creature!’ she called out after her. ‘You ought to be struck by lightning,
throwing away good flowers like that!’
She set about picking some herself then, to deliver to the various apartments.
As for Swallow, she went on running until she came to Green Delights. There, just
inside the courtyard, she ran full tilt into Aroma, who was just at that moment setting
out to pay a call on Dai-yu. Swallow clung to her imploringly.
‘Save me, miss! My mother’s going to beat me again.’
At the sight of the mother, arriving now in hot pursuit, Aroma could no longer
contain her annoyance.
‘That’s twice in three days: first your foster-daughter and now your own daughter.
Is it to show off the size of your family that you do this, or do you really not know any
better?’
Being a relative newcomer to the Garden, Swallow’s mother had as yet formed no
very clear impression of Aroma beyond that she spoke very little and was probably a
fairly harmless sort of person.
‘I should mind your own business, if I was you, miss,’ she said rudely. ‘You know
nothing about these matters. It’s because you’re all so soft with the girl that she’s got
so out of hand.’
She darted after Swallow again, her hand upraised to strike her. Aroma was so angry
that she turned round and began marching back to the house. On her way she
passed Musk, who was hanging some handkerchiefs out to dry under the crab-apple
tree. Musk looked over her shoulder to see what all the shouting was about.
‘I should leave them to it, if I were you,’ she advised Aroma. ‘Just let them get on
with it and see what happens.’
She signalled to Swallow with her eyes as she said this. Swallow’ understood her
immediately and dashed inside the house to take refuge with Bao-yu. The other
servants smiled at each other in pleasurable anticipation.
‘Now there’ll be trouble,’ they said. ‘Now we shall really see something!’
‘Why don’t you calm down a bit?’ Musk said to the woman. ‘Surely you’re not
going to set yourself up against the whole apartment?’
The woman saw her daughter go up to Bao-yu inside the house and Bao-yu take her
by the hand.
‘Don’t worry,’ Bao-yu said to the girl. ‘I’ll look after you.’ Swallow, still crying, told
him the whole story of Oriole and the willow-wigs. Bao-yu was deeply shocked, but,
for form’s sake, pretended to blame Swallow for what had hap?pened.
‘It’s bad enough having rows in here; what do you want to go upsetting your aunt
outside for?’
‘What this good woman said just now is right,’ Musk said to the other servants.
Perhaps we are too slack. Perhaps we don’t know enough about these matters to
deal with them properly ourselves. What we need is someone whose opinion she will
listen to, someone who really knows what’s what.’
She turned to a little maid standing near by.
‘Go and fetch Patience. If Patience can’t come, fetch Mrs Lin.’
As the little maid ran off on her errand, the other women in the compound drew
round Swallow’s mother with inter?ested smiles.
‘Better ask them to call that child back,’ they advised her. ‘You don’t want Miss
Patience coming here.’
‘If she’s “Miss Patience”, she’ll just have to be patient and listen to reason,’ said the
woman defiantly. ‘I never yet heard of a mother being disciplined for trying to
discipline her own daughter.’
The others smiled at her ignorance.
‘You don’t know who Miss Patience is, though. Miss Patience is Mrs Lian’s Number
One. If she’s in a good mood, you might get away with a telling-off; but if she’s not
my goodness, you’re in for a packet of trouble!’
Just then the little maid came back with a message.
‘Miss Patience was busy, but she asked me why I’d come and when I told her she
said, “Tell her she’s dismissed and get Mrs Lin on the corner gate to give her forty
strokes of the bamboo.”‘
It was now the mother’s turn for tears and entreaties.
‘It wasn’t easy for me to get this job,’ she said. ‘I shan’t get another like it. And I’m a
widow, too: I’ve no one else at home. From your point of view that’s an advantage,
because I can give all my attention to serving you. But it means that it’s my only
livelihood: if you turn me out, I don’t know how I’m going to keep alive.’
Aroma began to relent.
‘But if you want to stay here,’ she said, ‘you really must learn to behave yourself
and do what you are told. You really can’t go around hitting people all the time. What
are we to do with a person like you? This daily shouting and quarrelling is giving our
place a bad name.’
‘Take no notice of her,’ said Skybright. ‘Send her packing. Who’s got time to stand
around arguing with people like her?’
Swallow’s mother appealed to the other maids:
‘I admit I was in the wrong; but if you tell me what to do, I’m willing to learn. Give
me another chance, young ladies, you won’t regret it. It’s a “work of merit”, don’t
forget, to help another person mend their ways.’
She appealed to Swallow:
‘It was on account of beating you that I got into this tr6uble. And I didn’t beat you
very hard. Put in a word for me, there’s a good child!’
Bao-yu himself now felt sorry for the woman and told her that she could stay.
‘But no more trouble, mind! Any more trouble from you, and you’ll be out like a
shot - and you’ll be given the beating!’
The woman thanked first Bao-yu and then all the others in turn. She had already left
when Patience looked in to see what the trouble was.
‘Forget about it!’ said Aroma. ‘It’s all over.’
‘Well, they say “where mercy is possible, mercy should be shown”,’ Patience
observed. ‘If you can see your way to letting her off, it certainly saves us some
trouble. I can’t understand it, though. It’s only a few days since Their Ladyships left,
yet already the whole place seems to be in a state of mutiny. Before I’ve finished
dealing with trouble in one place, it crops up in another. I scarcely know which way to
turn.’
‘I thought we were the only ones,’ said Aroma. ‘I didn’t realize there were others.’
‘Oh, this is nothing!’ said Patience. ‘There have been seven or eight outbreaks just
during these last three or four days. Compared with the others, this trouble of yours
is a very minor affair. We’ve had something much more upsetting - and more
ridiculous - than this to contend with.’
Aroma was curious to know what it was. But as to whether Patience told her or not,
that will be revealed in the chapter which follows.

CHAPTER 60

As a substitute for rose-orris
Jia Huan is given jasmine face-powder
And in return for rose essence
Cook Liu is given lycoperdon snow



Aroma, you will recall, had asked Patience what in particular it was that had been
giving her so much trouble. Patience smiled mysteriously:
Something no one would ever guess. You’ll have a good laugh when I tell you. I won’t
tell you for a few days yet, though, because I still haven’t quite got to the bottom of it
-and I haven’t got time now, in any case.’
As if to prove that this was so, one of Li Wan’s little maids arrived at that very
moment:
‘Miss Patience? Oh, there you are! Mrs Zhu’s waiting for you. Why don’t you
come?’
‘I’m coming, I’m coming,’ said Patience, breaking away from the others with a laugh
and hurrying after her.
Aroma and the others laughed, too.
‘She’s grown as popular as hot cakes since her mistress’s illness: everyone wants
her at once!’
Patience’s business with Li Wan is no part of our story. We remain with Bao-yu and
the test at Green Delights.
‘Swallow,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you and your mother had better go to Miss Bao’s place and
make it up with Oriole. You can’t let her go on feeling offended.’
‘Yes,’ said Swallow, and hurried out to find her mother. Bao-yu shouted to them
through the window as the two of them were crossing the courtyard:
‘Don’t say anything about it in front of Miss Bao. You don’t want Oriole to get a
telling-off.’
Mother and daughter shouted back a reply and continued on their way, conversing as
they went. Swallow began reproaching her mother when they were out of earshot:
‘I told you, Mother, again and again, but you wouldn’t believe me. All this trouble
you’ve got yourself into - it was so unnecessary.’
‘Get along with you, little hussy!’ said her mother, laughing. ‘You know what the
proverb says: “Never suffer, never learn”. I’ve learned my lesson. I don’t need any
lectures from you!’
‘If only you could be content with the job you’ve got, Ma, and not be always
pushing forward so,’ said Swallow gently. ‘There are all sorts of benefits to be had
from working here, after you’ve been here some length of time. I’ll tell you just one
of them. Bao-yu says that when the time comes, he’s going to ask Her Ladyship to
give us maids - all of us, that is, not just the ones who work in his room - our freedom,
so that you can marry us to whoever you like. What about that for a start?’
‘Really?’ Her mother’s delight was tempered with incredulity.
‘Why should I tell a lie?’
The pious invocations which this news evoked continued until they were almost at
All-spice Court. They arrived there when Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Aunt Xue and the others
were having lunch. Swallow and her mother waited until Oriole came out to make
the tea, then, as she emerged, Swallow’s mother stepped forward to make her
apology.
‘I’m afraid I was a bit hasty just now, miss. I said sonic things I shouldn’t have done.
I hope you won’t hold it against me. Anyway, I’m very sorry.’
Oriole, all smiles, begged them both to be seated and would have given them tea;
but mother and daughter said they had business to attend to and took their leave.
They were already on their way back to Green Delights when Etamine came hurrying
after them.


‘Just a minute, just a minute!’
She was holding a little packet which she wanted them to deliver to Parfumee for her.
It was rose-orris, she explained, for the face.
‘That’s a bit unnecessary, isn’t it?’ said Swallow. ‘They must have plenty of it there
they’d be only too willing to give her if she wanted any. Why go to the trouble of
sending her some?’
‘What they do with theirs is their concern,’ said Etamine. ‘This is mine and I want to
give it to her as a present. Please take it with you.’
Swallow could scarcely refuse.
When she and her mother got back to Green Delights, Jia Huan and Jia Cong were
with Bao-yu inside, having arrived on a formal visit a few moments previously to
inquire about his health. Swallow turned to her mother.
‘Now, Mother: I’ll go in alone. There’s no need for you to come in with me.’
Her mother received this without a murmur. All her former wilfulness was quite
forgotten and she stood docilely outside while Swallow entered.
Bao-yu, seeing her come in, realized that it was Only to report the successful
conclusion of her mission and nodded to her curtly to show that he had understood.
There was therefore no need for her to say anything, and after standing silently for a
few moments inside the doorway, she slipped out again, signalling with her eyes to
Parfumee as she did so to follow her into the Outer room. There she handed the
packet to her and told her in an undertone what Etamine had asked her to say.
Bao-yu, having nothing whatever to talk to his visitors about, had been idly following
this transaction out of the corner of his eye, and when Parfumee came in again, he
asked her what it was that she was holding. Parfumee told him and handed him the
packet. He praised Etamine’s thoughtfulness while opening it up to have a look.
Jia Huan craned forward and smelt the powder’s cool, delicious scent. Stooping down,
he fished a sheet of paper from inside his boot.
‘Give us a bit, brother!’ he said, holding the paper out for Bao-yu to pour some in.
Bao-yu would have given him some, but Parfumee was unwilling that Etamine’s gift
to her should be shared.
‘No, don’t take any of that,’ she said. ‘I’ll get some more for you from outside.’
Bao-yu, divining the reason for her reluctance, quickly did the packet up again.
‘Here you are. Hurry up and get some more then.’
Parfumee took the packet, and having stored it safely away in the room where she
kept her things, looked in the drawer of her vanity-case for her own supply, only to
find that the box she had kept it in was empty - why she could not imagine, because
she was sure there had been some left in it that morning: But when she asked the
others, of course, no one knew anything about it.
‘There’s no time to bother about that now,’ said Musk. ‘Obviously it must have
been someone from this room. They must have found themselves short and
“borrowed” yours. Give him something else. It doesn’t matter what: he’ll never know
the difference. Anything to get rid of them, so that we can get on with our lunch!’
Following this advice, Parfumee made up a little packet of jasmine-scented
face-powder and took it inside to the boys. Jia Huan, grinning broadly, stretched out
his hand to receive it, but she threw it contemptuously on the kang and he had to
stoop down to pick it up. When he had stowed it inside the breast of his jacket, he
and Jia Cong finally took their leave.
With Jia Zheng permanently away and Lady Wang and the other ladles now also
absent, Jia Huan had lately taken to staying away from school for several days at a
time on the pretext that he was ill; he therefore felt no compunction in entering his
mother’s courtyard during the daytime. He did so now, very pleased with himself, to
look for Sunset, whom he found chatting with Aunt Zhao.
‘Look, I’ve brought you something nice,’ he said, going up to her, all smiles, and
holding out the packet: ‘something for your face. You know you’re always saying how
good rose?-orris is for skin troubles - how much better than the silver powder you
get from outside - well, have a look at this!’
Sunset opened the packet, took one look at its contents, and let out a hoot of
laughter.
‘Who did you get this from?’
Jia Huan told her.
‘They’ve been having you on,’ said Sunset. ‘This stuff isn’t rose-orris, it’s jasmine
face-powder.’
Jia Huan looked again. It did in fact have a slightly pinkish tinge, and when he sniffed
it, he found that it had a sweet, almost sickly perfume, quite unlike the clean, fresh
scent of the orris.
‘Well, anyway, it’s good stuff,’ he said. ‘Orris or this stuff; it’s all powder, isn’t it? You
can keep it to use on your face. This is still better than anything you could buy from
outside.’
Sunset put it away resignedly.
Aunt Zhao eyed her offspring scornfully.
‘You don’t think if they’d got anything really good they’d give it to you, do you? I’m
not surprised she made a fool of you; I’m surprised you bothered to ask her for it.
Take it back and throw it in her face, that’s what you ought to do. Now that the
others are all either chasing around the countryside after this funeral or lying with
their toes curled up in bed is just the moment for a good old row. Stir them all up a
bit. Pay them back for some of the things they’ve done to us in the past. No one’s
going to be bothered to dig a little thing like this up in two months’ time when
they’re all back again. And even if they do, you’ve got a good excuse. Bao-yu’s your
elder brother; you can’t do anything to offend him, I agree. But that doesn’t mean
that you have to put up with what every little cat or dog of his chooses to do to you.’
Jia Huan hung his head.
‘It’s not worth a quarrel,’ said Sunset, defending him. ‘Much better just grin and
bear it, whatever we think.’
‘Just stay out of this, will you?’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘It’s got nothing to do with you. He
knows he’s in the right. It’s a golden opportunity to go and tell these little hussies
exactly what he thinks of them.’ She pointed at Jia Huan scornfully. ‘Pah! Spineless
creature I If ever I say a word out of place or give you the wrong thing by mistake, I
get black looks from you soon enough! Oh yes, you can be very fierce with your own
mother! But when some little chit of a girl makes a fool of you, you take it lying down.
How can you expect the servants to respect you when you grow up if you always
behave like this? Oh, you’re so useless, you make me sick!’
Shamed and angered by her words, yet still not daring to act upon them) Jia Huan
made a dismissive gesture with his hand.
‘It’s all very well to talk, but you wouldn’t dare to go there any more than I would.
You want me to go back there and have a row with them, don’t you? All right,
suppose I do and they tell the school. I’m the one who’ll feel the pain when I get
beaten, not you. You’re always stirring me up to do things; then, when I get beaten
and sworn at, you just keep your head down and say nothing. This time you’re trying
to stir me up to have a row with these girls. Well, if you’re not afraid of Tan-chun,
why don’t you do it yourself? Then perhaps in future I might take a bit more notice of
what you said.’
His words touched Aunt Zhao on the raw.
‘What?’ she screamed. ‘Me afraid of my own flesh and blood, of my own daughter
that I once carried inside me? That’s a good story!’
She snatched up the packet of orris-powder from where Sunset had placed it and
went rushing off in the direction of the Garden. Sunset, having found expostulation in
vain, slipped off to another apartment to shelter from the storm. Jia Huan slunk off
through the ornamental gate to play on his own outside.
As Aunt Zhao, still in a highly combustible state, went charging into the Garden, who
should she run into but old Mamma Xia, that aunt of Swallow’s who was also the
foster-mother and implacable enemy of Nenuphar. From Aunt Zhao’s livid face and
bloodshot eyes it was evident to the old nannie that she was in a very nasty temper.
Mamma Xia politely inquired where she was going.
‘Now even the little painted actresses who haven’t been with us more than a few
days are discriminating against us. I could take it from anyone else, but to have little
creatures like that putting you in your place - it’s more than flesh and blood can
bear!’
As these sentiments, insofar as she could make sense of them, seemed very much in
accord with her own, Mamma Xia asked her, with some interest, precisely what it
was that had upset her. Aunt Zhao explained how Jia Huan had asked for rose-orris
and been fobbed off with ordinary face-powder.
‘My dear Mrs Zhao,’ said Mamma Xia, ‘have you only now begun to realize what
they are like? Why, what you have just told me is nothing I The other day they were
even burning ghost money in here - and Bao-yu sticking up for them, if you please I If
anyone else brings anything into the Garden, it’s all “unclean, unclean I” - there’s no
end of a fuss. But ghost money, than which there’s nothing more unclean that I know
of, that’s all right, apparently. You’re the most senior person after Her Ladyship, Mrs
Zhao. I think you ought to put your foot down for once. I’m sure if you did, everyone
would respect you for it. If you ask me, players is only trash anyway, so even if you
upset them, there’s nothing much they can do about it. Let these two things, the
powder and the ghost money, be your justification for making an example of them.
I’ll support you with my evidence. Give them a taste of your authority now and you
will find it that much easier to deal with other things later on. Even if the young
mistresses don’t like it, they’re not going to side against you with riff-raff like these.’
Aunt Zhao’s resolve was strengthened by this encouragement.
‘I didn’t know about the ghost money,’ she said. ‘Tell me what happened.’
Mamma Xia did so, in great detail, concluding with a further incitement to action.
‘Go and have it out with them, Mrs Zhao! We’ll stand by you if there’s any trouble.’
These words were as music in Aunt Zhao’s ears. Emboldened by them, she marched
off without more delay to Green Delights.
It chanced that Bao-yu was out when she arrived (he had heard that Dai-yu was
visiting All-spice Court and gone off to join her there) and Parfumee was having lunch
with Aroma and the other maids. The girls all rose to their feet as Aunt Zhao entered
and politely invited her to join them.
‘Won’t you have some lunch, Mrs Zhao? Why are you in such a hurry?’
Ignoring the invitation, Aunt Zhao stepped forward, threw the powder she was
carrying in Parfumee’s face and, with stabbing index finger for emphasis, began
shouting at her abusively.
‘Little strumpet! You’re a bit of bought goods, that’s all you are. We paid down
money and bought you, so that you could be trained to sing for our entertainment.
Play-actors and prostitutes are the class of people you belong to; the lowest servant
in this household is still a few steps above you. So what makes you think you have
the right to go discriminating between one person and another? It’s no skin off your
nose if Bao-yu wants to give something of his away to somebody: what business have
you to try and stop him? I suppose you thought when you palmed that stuff off on
Huan that he wouldn’t know the difference. Well, let me tell you: Master Huan is
Bao-yu’s brother, whatever you may think of him, and that means he’s one of the
masters, and there’s no cause for you to look down on him.’
Parfumee, never one to take things quietly, set up a howl of tearful protest.
‘I gave that stuff to him because I hadn’t got any orris and I was afraid if I told him I
hadn’t got any he wouldn’t believe me. Anyway, it’s good powder. And suppose I
have been trained as an actress, I’ve never played outside for money. I’m a little girl,
not a trumpet or whatever it was you called me. And as for being “bought goods”,
well, it wasn’t you who bought me. And anyway, look who’s talking! I thought all of
us here were bought goods. I don’t know why you of all people would want to drag
that up.’
‘Stop that at once!’ said Aroma, shocked, and tried to pull her Out of the way. But
Aunt Zhao, in speechless fury, had already advanced on Parfumee and dealt her a
couple of resounding slaps on the head. Aroma expostulated.
‘She’s only a child, Mrs Zhao, you don’t want to put yourself on the same level.
Leave it to us to deal with her.’
Parfumee was not to he struck with impunity and reacted to the assault with a fine
display of histrionics, weeping, shout?ing and throwing herself about in all directions.
‘How dare you hit me, you horrible old woman! You should look at yourself in the
mirror! Go on, hit me again then, hit me again! I don’t want to go on living!’
Lowering her head, she drove it into Aunt Zhao’s midriff, continuing, as she butted
into leer, to repeat her challenge. Several of the servants shouted at her and
attempted to pull her off. Aroma would have done so too, but Sky-bright drew her to
one side and advised her against joining them.
‘Leave them to it, Aroma Y6u and I don’t want to get mixed up in this. It’s the law of
the jungle now: you hit me, I hit you. Heaven knows where it will end!’
The servants who had followed in Aunt Zhao’s wake, when they heard the rumpus
inside, gave thanks to the Lord Buddha that justice was at last being done. Among
them, the old women who bore grudges against the little actresses were particularly
gratified to hear that Parfumee was being beaten.
The news travelled quickly. Nenuphar and Etamine, who had found a quiet corner of
All-spice Court in which to be alone together, heard it when the two former ‘painted
faces’ of their troupe, Xiang-yun’s Althee and Bao-qin’s Cardamome, burst in on them
to enlist their support.
‘Come on, you two! If we let them bully Parfumee, we shall all of us suffer. It’s time
to come out in the open and make a stand. Let’s show them a bit of spirit!’
The four of them were only children, full of righteous indig?nation for their friend.
Without a moment’s reflection they rushed off in a body and went charging into
Green Delights. Cardamome made first impact, and Aunt Zhao would have been
swept off her feet had she not been simultaneously ringed round by the three others,
who, with fists flailing, heads butting, and all emitting loud ‘boo-hoos’, pressed in
upon her rear and sides. Skybright and the senior maids, though pretending concern
and making half-hearted attempts to intervene, found it difficult not to laugh; but
Aroma was genuinely distressed and dashed from one to another of them, dragging
them away from Aunt Zhao. It was useless. As she pulled one off, another would dart
in to replace her.
‘What’s the matter with you all?’ wailed Aroma. ‘If you’ve got a grievance, why
can’t you discuss it like sensible human beings? You can’t go taking the law into your
own hands like this. I never heard of such a thing!’
Aunt Zhao could only curse helplessly. Etamine and Nenuphar held her firmly by each
arm and Althee and Cardamome had her pinned between them with their heads.
‘Kill us!’ they kept shouting, ‘Kill us all four!’
Parfumee meanwhile lay stretched out corpselike on the ground, having cried herself
into a swoon.
The little actresses might have remained locked in their grapple with Aunt Zhao
indefinitely, but Skybright had already sent Swallow to bear word of what was
happening to Tan-chun, and You-shi, Li Wan and Tan-chun, together with Patience
and a number of female domestics, now arrived upon the scene and shouted to them
peremptorily to release her.
Aunt Thao was by now pop-eyed with anger and the veins stood out thickly on her
forehead. They asked her how she came to be in such a predicament, but her reply,
though long and voluble, was made almost incomprehensible by rage, and You-shi
and Li Wan, unable to make anything of it, contented themselves with shouting some
more at the act?resses. Tan-chun, though, merely sighed.
‘This isn’t really very serious. You are too easily angered, Aunt. As a matter of fact
there was something I wanted to discuss with you, but the maids didn’t seem to
know where you had got to. Now it appears that you were in here, work?ing yourself
into a rage. Do come with us now.’
You-shi and Li Wan smilingly confirmed the invitation.
‘Yes, Mrs Zhao. Come with us to the office and we can discuss things with you
there.’
Since she could scarcely object to being consulted, Aunt Zhao was constrained to go
along with them, but even as she went she continued muttering angrily to herself
until Tan?-chun cut her short:
‘These girls are here for our amusement,’ Tan-chun said. ‘They are like pets. You
can talk to them and play with them if you feel like it, or if you don’t, you can simply
ignore them. It’s the same when they are naughty. Just as, when your puppy-dog
bites you or your kitten scratches you, you can either ignore it or have it punished, so
with these girls. If they do something to offend you, you can either let it pass, or, if
you don’t feel able to, you can call in one of the stewardesses and have them
punished. There is absolutely no need to go rushing off in person, shouting and
hollering at them. It’s so undignified. And besides, it sets so bad an example. Look at
Aunt Zhou. She doesn’t seem to suffer any of this disrespect you complain of and she
isn’t always rushing off after people to have it out with them. If I were you, Aunt, I
should go back to your room now and try to calm down a bit. And don’t go listening
any more to those trouble-makers. There’s no reason why you should do other
people’s work for them; you get no thanks for it; they merely laugh at you for being
stupid. However angry you may feel now, try to be patient for a few days until Lady
Wang gets back and we’ll see what we can do to get all this sorted out then.’
This dressing-down was effective, insofar as it left Aunt Zhao without a word to say,
and she returned in silence to her room. As soon as she had gone, Tan-chun burst out
angrily to the others.
‘You’d think she’d know better at her age. Why can’t she do anything to make
people respect her? I mean, what a ridic?ulous thing to quarrel about! And what a
way to behave! She will listen to absolutely anything anyone tells her. She has
absolutely no judgement of her own. And those wretched old women take advantage
of the fact to use her as their cat’s-paw.’
The more Tan-chun thought about it, the angrier she became. She ended up by
ordering the women to make some inquiries and find out whose incitement it was
that had goaded Aunt Zhao into action. The women went off obediently to
investigate, but turned to each other with shrugs and smiles as they left the building.
‘Like looking for a needle on the ocean bed!’
And though they had Aunt Zhao’s women and all the women from the Garden up in
front of them for question?ing, not one of them would admit to knowing anything at
all about it, and they were obliged to report back to Tan?-chun that they had failed.
‘But we shall go on making inquiries, miss,’ they said. ‘If we find anything suspicious,
we shall report it to you.’
Tan-chun’s anger had by this time subsided and she would have let the matter drop;
but Artemisie, the little actress who had been assigned to her apartment, came to
her privately to tell her that she could identify the culprit.
‘It was Mamma Xia,’ she said. ‘She hates us and she is always trying to get us into
trouble. The other day she tried to get Nenuphar into trouble for burning
spirit-money, but Bao-yu had asked her to burn it, and when he owned up, Mamma
Xia hadn’t a leg to stand on. Today, when I was delivering those handkerchiefs for you,
I noticed her and Mrs Zhao twittering away for ever such a long time together and
when they saw me coming they moved out of the way to avoid me.’
It seemed highly probable that it was Mamma Xia who had done the inciting; but
these little actresses were all closely in league together, Tan-chun reflected, and all of
them were exceptionally mischievous: it would be too risky to act on the evidence of
what one of them had said. She thanked Artemisie for her information, but inwardly
decided to do nothing.
By an unlucky chance Mamma Xia had a granddaughter who worked in Tan-chun’s
apartment and did various little errands for the maids, with all of whom she was
popular. Her name was Cicada, but the maids all called her ‘Ciggy’. On this particular
occasion Tan-chun had gone back to the jobs room’ after lunch, leaving Ebony in
charge of her apartment. Ebony now asked Ciggy to go to the Garden gatehouse and
get one of the pages there to run out and buy her a sweet-cake. Ciggy objected that
she had just finished sweeping the courtyard and had a backache. She told Ebony to
ask some?one else.
‘There’s no one else I can ask,’ said Ebony. ‘I tell you what. If you’ll do this errand
for me now, I’ll give you a piece of good advice that you can pass on to your grandma
when you get there.’
And she proceeded to tell her about Artemisie’s denunciation.
‘Tell her to be on her guard.’
‘The little beast!’ said Ciggy, taking the money for the sweetcake. ‘She wants to join
in too, does she? Wait till I tell my gran!’
And off she went to the back gate of the Garden.
It was a slack time now in the kitchen and the women, Mamma Xia among them,
having for the time being finished with fetching and carrying; were sitting outside on
the steps and gossiping. Ciggy asked one of them to go out and buy a hot fried
sweetcake for her and then proceeded to give her grandmother an account,
interlarded with much bad language of her own, of what Ebony had told her about
Artemisie.
Mamma Xia, both angered and alarmed by what she heard, was all for going off
straight away, having it out with the little actress, and protesting her innocence to
Tan-chun; but Ciggy prevented her.
‘Don’t go, Gran! What can you say to them if you do go? How are you going to
explain how you got to know about it? Once they start asking questions, you’ll be in
the soup again. I’ve told you this to put you on your guard. You don’t have to do
anything about it.’
Just then Parfumee peered in the gateway of the kitchen courtyard and called across
to Mrs Liu, the cook, who was still banging about inside the kitchen.
‘Cookie, Master Bao says, for his vegetable dish this evening could he have
something cold and vinegary again, please, only not so oily as last time?’
‘Very good,’ Cook Liu stood in her doorway and called back cheerfully. ‘Why should
they send you about such a great, important matter? Come in and look around, if it’s
not too dirty for you.’
Parfumee had barely stepped into the courtyard when the woman to whom Ciggy
had entrusted the money arrived back carrying Ebony’s hot fritter on a saucer.
‘Oo, lovely hot fritter! Give us a taste!’ said Parfumee jokingly.
‘That has been ordered and paid for by someone else,’ said Ciggy primly, as she
took the saucer from the woman. ‘It is not for you.’
‘Do you fancy one, miss?’ Cook Liu asked Parfumee. ‘I’ve got one in here that I
bought for our Fivey you can have if you like. It hasn’t been touched yet, so it’s quite
clean.’
She brought the fried cake out on a saucer and handed it to Parfumee.
‘There you are. Now you wait there a moment and I’ll heat up a nice cup of tea for
you to go with it.’
She went inside again to rake the top off the fire and heat some tea up in a skillet.
But instead of waiting for her, Parfumee picked the fritter up from its saucer, went
over to Ciggy with it, and held it under her nose for her to inspect.
‘Look what’s that, then? Fritter. Who wants your mouldy fritter? I was only joking. I
wouldn’t eat yours if you went down on your bended knees and begged me to!’
She began to crumble it up between her fingers and throw the pieces to the birds.
‘Don’t worry, Mrs Liu!’ she called out in the direction of the kitchen. ‘I’ll buy two
catties of these for you presently.’
Ciggy glared at her in outrage.
‘Old Thunder up there must be blind not to strike you dead,’ she said bitterly.
‘Either that, or he must be angry with me for something. Still, I can’t compete with
you, can I! I haven’t got anyone to rush out and give me things, or trot around after
me like a self-adopted slave, or chip in with a good word for me when there’s an
argument.’
‘All right, young ladies, that’s enough!’ said the women on the steps. ‘Can’t you
even see each other without having words?’
The more discerning of them, sensing that a storm was brewing and not wanting to
get involved, had already begun slipping off elsewhere. But Ciggy had no stomach for
a fight and went off, muttering angrily to herself, without further argument.
When the women had all gone, Cook Liu came bustling Out of her kitchen for a
private word with Parfumee.
‘That business we were talking about the other day -have you spoken to him about
it yet?’
‘Yes, I have,’ said Parfumee. ‘I was going to remind him of it today, but that
wretched Zhao woman came along and upset everything with her quarrelling. How’s
Fivey? Did she drink any of that Essence of Roses I brought her the other day?’
‘She drank it all,’ said Cook Liu. ‘She loved it. She’d really like some more, to tell the
truth, but she doesn’t like to ask.’
‘That’s all right,’ said Parfumee. ‘I can easily get her some more. I only have to ask
for it.’
The object of Parfumee’s inquiry, who owed her strange name to the fact that she
was the fifth of Old Liu’s granddaughters, though only the daughter of a cook, was in
both looks and intelligence a match for any of the senior maids -Patience, Aroma,
Faithful or Nightingale - and it was only because of a weakly constitution that she
was still, in her sixteenth year, without employment. Recently, however, observing
how numerous the maids were in Bao-yu’s apartment and how light their duties
were, and hearing that it was his intention to give them their freedom when they had
finished service with him, her mother had conceived the ambition of getting her on
the staff of Green Delights. Lack of a contact there had at first made this ambition
seem unrealizable; but Cook Liu had previously worked at Pear Tree Court, where her
cheerful and ungrudging service had won her golden opinions with the girls. They
greatly preferred her to their own foster-mothers. And so when Parfumee moved
into Green Delights, the cook had easily. prevailed on her to tackle Bao-yu on her
daughter’s behalf. Bao-yu had consented willingly, but the situation created by
Xi-feng’s illness together with other more recent developments had so far prevented
him from seeking higher approval for the appointment.
But we digress.
Bao-yu heard about the fracas created in his apartment by Aunt Zhao while he was at
All-spice Court visiting the girls. Though deeply distressed on Parfumee’s behalf, he
decided, after some hesitation, that intervention by him could only make matters
worse, and resolved to stay where he was. He did so until word reached All-spice
Court that Tan-chun had succeeded in getting Aunt Zhao out of the way. Returning
then, he had formally reproved Parfumee for her belligerency and then sent her on
an errand to the kitchen.
Parfumee now arrived back at Green Delights and reported on the fulfilment of her
mission. She also told him that, if he still had any, Fivey would like some more of the
Essence of Roses.
‘Yes, I think I’ve still got some,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Look, why don’t you give her all of it? I
don’t drink it very often myself.’
He sent Aroma to fetch it. As there was not a great deal of it left, he told Parfumee
that Fivey might as well keep the bottle. Parfumee went back to the kitchen again to
give the bottle to Cook Liu.
When she got there, she found Fivey there as well. To give her ailing, cooped-up
daughter a little treat, Cook Liu had brought her along with her that day when she
went to work. The girl had just been taking a little walk in the environs of her
mother’s kitchen and was now resting her feet in the kitchen and having a cup of tea.
Mother and daughter, when they saw the glittering five-inch crystal bottle half-full of
ruby liquid that Parfumee was carrying, assumed that it was some of Bao-yu’s West
Ocean grape wine that she was bring?ing them.
‘Sit yourself down,’ said Cook Liu. ‘I’ll just fetch the mulling-pan and boil up some
water to heat it in.’
Parfumee laughed.
‘That’s all there is, I’m afraid. He says you can keep the bottle.’
Fivey realized that the red liquid must be not grape wine but some more Essence of
Roses, and thanked her effusively for her kindness. Parfumee asked her how she felt.
‘A bit livelier today,’ said Fivey. ‘That’s why I came in with Mother. I’ve been for a
walk all around here, but there’s really not much to look at just a lot of rocks and the
backs of buildings. I haven’t seen anything that you could really call a view.’


‘Why don’t you go right inside?’ said Parfumee.
‘Because I won’t let her,’ her mother chipped in. ‘None of the young ladies in there
knows her. If some inquisitive person were to stop her and start asking questions,
she’d have a lot of trouble explaining what she was doing. Once you’ve got her a
place in there, as you so kindly promised, I’m sure there will be plenty willing to show
her around. She’ll be able to look around the Garden then until she’s sick of the sight
of it!’
‘You don’t want to worry,’ said Parfumee. ‘I’d look after her.’
‘I’m sure you would, bless you!’ said the cook. ‘But folks like us have to be more
careful.’
She poured Parfumee a cup of tea. Parfumee accepted her hospitality to the extent
of using some of this as a mouth?wash before getting up to go.
‘My hands are a bit full at the moment,’ said Cook Liu. ‘Fivey will see you out.’
The two girls went out together. Having first ascertained that there was no one else
about, Fivey impulsively took Parfumee by the hand:
‘Did you really ask him about that?’
‘Of Course I did!’ said Parfumee. ‘I wouldn’t deceive you. I’ve found out that there
are two vacancies that haven’t yet been filled: one of them is the place left by
Crimson, for whom Mrs Lian still hasn’t found him a substitute; the other one is
Trinket’s. If he asks for you, it will be only one out of those two places, so he will be
perfectly within his rights. The only reason he hasn’t done so already is because
Patience keeps telling Aroma that if we have any requests concerning either jobs or
allowances to make, we’d be well advised to put them off for the time being. The fact
is that Miss Tan is looking for someone to make an example of. She’s already made an
example of Mrs Lian by turning down two or three of her requests in a row, and now
she’s trying to pick on us. She hasn’t found an excuse for doing so yet, but she hasn’t
given up trying. So if we go asking her about a thing like this now, it’s almost a
foregone conclusion that she will say no; and once she’s turned it down, it will be
very difficult to get that refusal reversed. Much better wait until the situation here
has quietened down a bit - till Their Lady-ships are back again and everyone is in a
good mood. If he approaches the old girl then, she’ll give him anything he asks for, no
matter what it is.’
‘I know,’ said Fivey, ‘but I’m too impatient to wait that long. I want that job now. In
the first place it will make my mother happy. She’ll feel that all the trouble she has
had in bringing me up has not been wasted. Secondly, the pay I shall earn will make
things easier for them at home. And thirdly, if only I felt a bit more cheerful, as I shall
do if I get that job, I do believe that this illness of mine would get better - and that
would mean a great saving for my family on doctor’s fees and medicines.’
At that point Parfumee left her and continued on her way back alone. Fivey returned
to the kitchen. She and her mother spoke warmly together of Parfumee’s kindness.
‘I’d never have thought anything like this would ever come our way,’ said Cook Liu.
‘Still, though it’s so precious, you can have too much of a good thing. You don’t want
to overheat your blood. I think it would be rather a nice gesture if we were to pour a
little of this off to give to someone else.’
Fivey asked her who she had in mind.
‘I was thinking of taking half a cupful to your uncle’s boy,’ said Cook Liu. ‘He’s been
down with a fever this last day or two, and it’s just the sort of thing he would enjoy.’
Fivey made no reply and watched in silence while her rnother decanted a small
quantity of the red liquid into a teacup and then placed the bottle, after corking it up
again, on a shelf of the kitchen cupboard.
‘I think if I were you I wouldn’t give him that,’ she said finally. There was a wry little
smile on her face. ‘If anyone should ask you where it came from, we might find
ourselves in trouble.’
‘Oh, fiddlesticks!’ said her mother. ‘Surely we don’t have to be that careful? If you
work as hard as I do all the year round, you are entitled to a few perks. No one is
going to say that we stole it, surely?’
She sailed off cup in hand then to her brother’s, leaving Fivey alone in the kitchen.
She found her nephew in bed. He and his parents were all three delighted when they
learned what she had brought them. A cupful of cool water freshly drawn from the
well was mixed with a little of the essence and handed to the sick boy to drink. He
finished it at one draught and immediately declared that he felt better and that his
head seemed somewhat clearer. The cup containing the remainder of the essence
was covered with a square of paper and set on the table beside him.
While Cook Liu was still there, some of the sick boy’s workmates from the mansion
called in to visit him. Among them was a young fellow called Qian Huai, related on his
mother’s side to Aunt Zhao. His father worked in Accounts. Qian Huai’s own job was
to accompany Jia Huan when he went to school. A bachelor and with money to
spend, he had for long been an admirer of Fivey’s and in time past his parents had, at
his insistence, made several approaches to Fivey’s parents through intermediaries
asking for Fivey’s hand in marriage. Her parents were by no means averse to the
match, but as Fivey herself, though without actually saying anything, made it
perfectly plain by her behaviour that the idea was repugnant to her, they had not
dared to accept. More recently, with talk of Fivey going into service in the Garden,
they had been less inclined than ever to look on Qian Huai as a possible son-in-law,
for it now seemed probable that after four or five years’ service as a maid, Fivey
would be at liberty to marry someone of their own choice from outside. Qian Huai’s
parents, too, when they saw the way things stood, were inclined to let the matter
drop.
Not so Qian Huai, however. Wounded in his amour propre by Fivey’s rejection, he
made a fierce vow that he would pursue her relentlessly, with all the force and guile
at his command, until he had succeeded in making her his wife.
It was a surprise to him, needless to say, to call with the other pages on his sick
workmate and find Fivey’s mother at the bedside. Cook Liu was equally flustered on
recognizing Qian Huai among the little group of visitors and got up to go, on the
pretext of being busy.
‘Do just stay for a cup of tea,’ said her brother and sister-in-law. ‘It was so kind of
you to think of him.’
‘I expect they’ll he wanting their dinner inside now,’ said Cook Liu. ‘I’ll come and
see him again when I’m not so busy.’
The sister-in-law opened a drawer and took out a small paper packet from it as they
were leaving. Outside, at the corner by the gate, she pressed it, smilingly, into Cook
Liu’s hand.
‘This is something your brother brought back yesterday, from the gate. He was five
days on duty there and not a single tip all the time. Then suddenly yesterday some
high-up from Canton came here on a visit and left three little baskets of this white
stuff - “Lycoperdon Snow” it’s called - two for the masters and one for the people on
the gate. This here is your brother’s share of it. I opened it last night to have a look.
It’s beautiful stuff - so white and fine. They say that a little of it taken every morning
mixed with breast-milk is wonderful for building up the body. If you can’t get
breast-milk, you can use cow’s milk, or even plain boiled water. Of course, we
immediately thought of your Fivey; it would be just the thing for her. I sent our little
maid round with some this morning, but she said your door was locked. She said you
must have taken Fivey in with you. I would have gone in then to see her and given it
to her myself; but then I thought that with the mistresses away they’re much stricter
about letting people in and out now and they’d be sure to ask what business I had
going inside. And besides, this last day or two we’ve heard rumours of such terrible
goings-on in there, I should be afraid of getting mixed up in something. So it’s a good
job you came today, sister-in-law; you’ll be able to take the packet to her yourself.’
Cook Liu thanked her and left. At the corner gate of the Garden her way was blocked
by a grinning page.
‘Where have you been, missus? There have been two or three calls from inside
asking for you. Me and the others have been looking for you all over the place.
Where have you just come from? You don’t live out in this direction. I bet you’ve
been up to something!’
‘Cheeky little monkey!’ said the cook.
The rest of their exchange is recorded in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 61

Bao-yu owns up to a crime he
did not commit
And Patience bends authority in order that
the innocent may be spared



Cook Liu was trying to get back into the Garden, but the bantering page-boy delayed
her.
‘You don’t live in this direction. Naughty old Auntie! What have you been up to?’
“‘Auntie” is it?’ said Cook Liu, laughing. ‘Cheeky little monkey! If your “auntie” has
got herself a fancy man, that means you have a new uncle, so what are you worrying
about? You open that gate quickly, my lad, and let me in, or I’ll take hold of you by
that little po-cover of yours and pull your hair out!’
‘If I let you in, promise you’ll pinch a few apricots for me,’ said the boy, ‘to make up
for having kept me waiting so long. Mind you don’t forget, now, or next time you
want to nip out in the middle of the night for a bottle of wine or some oil, I’ll not
open for you. I’ll just let you stand there shouting and not even answer you.’
‘You must be mad!’ said the cook. ‘We can’t do that sort of thing any more now.
Nowadays it’s all divided up among the garden-women; and there isn’t one of them,
either, that wouldn’t just as soon scratch your eyes out as look at you. You only have
to walk under one of the fruit-trees and they’re watching you like hawks. Fat chance I
should have of picking any of the fruit for you! Only yester?day I was walking
underneath a plum-tree and raised my hand to drive a bee away that was buzzing in
front of my face. One of your old aunties happened to see me, but as she was quite a
long way off, she couldn’t quite make out what I was doing. She thought I was picking
the plums. Oh, you should have heard her shout! “Don’t take them! We haven’t
offered the first-fruits yet. No one must have any of those plums until Their Ladyships
have got back and made the offerings. You’ll get your share in time.” I suppose she
thought I had a craving and couldn’t wait! I’m afraid I wasn’t very polite. I gave her a
piece of my mind. You ask one of your old aunties if you want some fruit, my boy, it’s
no good asking me. You asking me for fruit is like the granary rat asking the crow
for corn: Have asking Have-not!’
‘Oh dear, oh dear!’ said the boy sarcastically. ‘If you can’t get me any, you can’t;
there’s no need to go on about it so. I suppose you think you won’t be needing my
services any more; but you will. When your Fivey gets her job inside, you’re going to
need my services more than ever.’
‘Whatever rubbish will the boy come out with next?’ said the cook. ‘What job are
you talking about?’
‘It’s no good pretending,’ the boy crowed. ‘I know. You needn’t think you’re the
only one with contacts inside. I’ve got my contacts too. I may be all the time working
here outside, but I’ve got two girl cousins inside who keep me informed. There’s
nothing much going on inside there that I don’t know about.’
At that point in their exchange they were interrupted by an old woman’s voice from
within:
‘Come on, you little monkey, you let Mrs Liu in this minute! If she doesn’t come in
directly, they won’t get their dinners in time.’
‘Don’t worry, I’m coming!’
Cook Liu brushed past the boy and, pushing the gate open for herself, went hurrying
back to the kitchen. Several of her assistants were waiting there already. They had
been standing about doing nothing, none of them having dared to take the initiative
without her.
‘Where’s Fivey gone?’ she asked them.
‘She just this minute went off to look for her cousins in the tea-room,’ they said.
Cook Liu put the packet of Lycoperdon Snow somewhere to give to her daughter later
and began making up the food-boxes for the different apartments. While she was
engaged in this work, Ying-chun’s little maid Lotus arrived with a message from
Chess.
‘Chess says for dinner tonight she wants a bowl of egg-custard, lightly done.’
‘That’s a bit of a luxury just now,’ said the cook. ‘I don’t know why it is, but for some
reason hen’s eggs seem to be in very short supply this year. Ten cash each they’re
charging for them at the moment, and even then you’re lucky if you can find any. The
other day, when they were making up a present for one of Her Ladyship’s relations
that had just had a baby, there were four or five of our buyers out scouring the
markets for eggs. They had no end of a job getting together two thousand. So you
can imagine what it must be like for me. Tell her to ask for eggs some other time.’
‘The other day when she wanted bean-curd, you gave me some that was rancid,’
said Lotus, ‘and I got a telling-off for it. Now she wants eggs and you say you haven’t
got any. I bet I could find some here if I looked.’
She stepped over to the food-container and took the lid off. Among the other things
revealed was a little cache of some ten or a dozen eggs.
‘There you are, what are they then?’ she said. ‘Aren’t you terrible? The food we eat
is all paid for, I don’t know why you’re so grudging with it. It isn’t as if you’d laid the
eggs yourself!’
‘I’ll give you laying eggs, my girl! If anyone lays eggs around here, it’ll be your
mother! Those are the only eggs I’ve got left and I’ve been saving them up to use as
garnishing on other dishes. Even then I’ll only use them if the young mistresses ask
for them specially. I need to have a few eggs by me in case of emergency. What am I
going to do if one of the mistresses asks for some eggs and you lot have already
eaten them all? “What?” she’ll say. “No eggs? Not even any eggs?” You people lead
such soft, sheltered lives. All you’ve got to do is stretch your hands out for
washing-water and your mouths open for food. You think eggs are the commonest
things in the world, you don’t realize there can be such things as shortages. Never
mind eggs, the day may yet come when there’s not even a corn-stalk to be had. My
advice to you girls is to try and make do with what you’re given. After all, you get the
best quality white rice, and chicken and duck to eat every day. It’s too much
pampering that causes this passion for variety: eggs one day, bean-curd the next,
fried pickled turnips in gluten batter ... It’s all very well saying you want something
different, but I’m afraid it won’t do. If each lot wants something different, that’s ten
different dishes I’ve got to prepare. I might just as well stop catering for the young
mistresses altogether and do nothing but cook for you girls!’
Lotus went red and shouted angrily back at her.
‘It’s not true that we’re always asking for something different. This rigmarole of
yours is quite uncalled for. Anyway, it’s your job to give us what we want. If that isn’t
your job, I’d like to know what is. You were obliging enough to Swallow the other day,
when she came to say that Skybright wanted a dish of artemisia shoots. “With pork
or with chicken?” you asked her. And when Swallow said Skybright didn’t eat meat,
she’d have it with wheat gluten, only not too much oil, “Oh,” you said, “how stupid of
me! I’d quite forgotten she was a vegetarian.” You scurried off to wash your hands
first before you cooked it, and when you’d cooked it, you carried it all the way there
for her your?self, just like a little dog that runs wagging its tall to its master. Why you
should pick on me to make an example of in front of all these people, I do not know.’
‘Holy name!’ said Cook Liu. ‘These people here will be my witness. Whenever
anyone from one of the other apartments, whether mistress or maid, asks me for a
special order -and I’m not just talking about that occasion you mentioned, I’m talking
about ever since this kitchen here first started -they invariably offer me something to
cover the extra cost. Whether I have to buy anything extra or not, it’s a nice gesture
and I appreciate it. Some people think that as I only have the young ladies to cater for,
I must make a lot out of it; but if anyone took the trouble to sit down and work it out,
they’d get a shock. Between forty and fifty people I have to cater for, counting both
mistresses and maids. And do you know what my daily allowance is? Two chickens,
two ducks, ten catties of pork and a thousand cash worth of vegetables. You try
managing on that! I can barely make it stretch to two meals a day provided everyone
sticks to the regu?lar menu; but if I’m going to have one person ordering one thing
and one person ordering another, turning down the food I’ve bought for them and
expecting me to buy other materials to make up their orders, my allowance simply
won’t stretch to it. If that’s the way you want it, you’ll just have to ask Her Ladyship
to give you all bigger allowances; then we can do what they do in the main kitchen
for Her Old Ladyship’s meals: have a blackboard with the names of all the dishes
under the sun chalked up on it and work through them one by one, having a different
dish every day. Then you could settle with me for what you’d eaten at the end of
each month. A week or two ago Miss Tan and Miss Bao suddenly thought they’d
fancy a dish of salted bean-sprouts and Miss Tan sent one of the girls over with five
hundred cash to ask me if I would prepare it for them. I laughed. “They’d never eat
five hundred cash worth,” I said, “not if they had bellies like the Laughing Buddha.
Twenty or thirty cash would be ample.” I sent the money back to her, but she
wouldn’t take it - said I should keep it to buy myself a drink with. “Now that the
kitchen’s inside,” she said, “I expect you often have people coming round and asking
you for favours.” She said, “I know it’s hard for you to refuse them, but even salt and
soy sauce cost something, and we don’t want you to end up out of pocket. Let’s call
this a payment to make up for some of the extras that other people have had out of
you.” Now there’s a kind, understanding young lady! I praise the Lord in my heart for
a young lady like that! Too bad that Mrs Zhao got to hear about it. She was furious, of
course: thought I was doing far too well out of it. And sure enough she sent one of
her little maids round less than ten days later asking for this and asking for that. I
couldn’t help laughing. You’re just the same. I suppose you’ve taken a leaf out of her
book. Well, it’s no good. My allowance just won’t stretch to it.’
Just then another messenger arrived from Chess to find out what had become of
Lotus.
‘What’s the matter?’ the messenger asked her. ‘Have you taken root or something?
Why don’t you come back?’
Lotus flounced off angrily after the messenger. The report that she gave when she
got back was so highly embellished that Chess could hardly fail to be incensed by it.
She was unable to do anything about it for the time being, because she was in the
middle of serving Ying-chun her dinner; but as soon as Ying-chun’s meal was over,
she hurried off to the kitchen, taking several of the junior maids with her.
She arrived as the kitchen staff were having their own dinner. The women, to whom
it was obvious that some kind of mischief was imminent, rose to their feet with
nervous smiles on their faces and invited her to sit with them. Ignor?ing the women,
she issued a brusque command to her minions:
‘Right! Boxes, bins, cupboards - wherever the food’s kept - throw it all out! Better
the dogs eat it than these swindlers have it all!’
The young maids, needing no second bidding, threw themselves with great gusto into
the work of ransacking the kitchen, while the women made vain efforts to restrain
them and pleaded with Chess to call them off.
‘You don’t want to believe everything those young girls tell you, miss. Mrs Liu
would never dare offend you, she knows it’s more than her job is worth. She did say
that eggs are hard to come by lately, it’s true; but we told her that it was silly of her
to take that line, and that if you say you want something, it’s up to her to find some
means of getting it for you, whatever it is. That’s what we told her. She’d already
admitted that she was in the wrong and put a basin of eggs in the steamer before
you arrived. Look on the stove, if you don’t believe us.’
Chess’s anger subsided somewhat under these blandishments and the young maids
were persuaded, albeit reluct?antly, to discontinue their pillage. Chess continued to
grumble for a bit and make unflattering remarks about the cook, but was eventually
persuaded to return, while Cook Liu, with much banging of pots and pans and
indignant muttering, set about making her a custard. When this was in due course
delivered to her, Chess promptly emptied it on the ground, but the woman who had
taken it prudently refrained from reporting this fact on her return for fear of
provoking further unpleasantness.
When Fivey returned to the kitchen, her mother gave her some soup and a half a
bowlful of congee and told her about the Lycoperdon Snow. Fivey, resolving to share
the latter with her friend and benefactress Parfumée, wrapped half of it up m a
separate sheet of paper and, having waited until it was dusk, when there were not
many people about, made her way to Green Delights, keeping to the trees as much
as possible, so that no one should see her. She managed to get as far as the gate of
the courtyard without being stopped by anyone, but, not daring to go inside,
retreated to the cover of some rose bushes and lurked there until someone should
come out.
Fortunately she did not have long to wait. After about the time it would take to drink
a cup of tea Swallow came out of the gate and Fivey stepped out of the bushes and
called to her to stop. Swallow could not at first make out who it was and had to go up
close and scrutinize her before asking what she wanted.
‘Will you tell Parfumee to come out for a minute, please?’ said Fivey. ‘I want to
have a word with her.’
Swallow laughed softly.
‘You’re too impatient. Your business is sure to be settled within the next ten days,
whatever you do. It’s silly to keep on asking. Anyway, she’s just gone out to the front,
so you’ll have to wait a bit. But perhaps it would be better if you gave me a message
to pass on to her. If you wait till she comes back, you might find yourself inside still
when they shut the gate.’
Fivey handed her the packet.
‘This stuff is Lycoperdon Snow …’
She went on to explain what its properties were and how it was to be taken.
‘I’ve just been given some and I want to share it with her. Would you mind giving it
to her for me, please?’
Leaving the packet in Swallow’s hands, she turned and began swiftly making her way
back again. She had just got as far as the part of the Garden bordering Flowery
Harbour when she saw Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife at the head of a party of stewardesses
coming towards her from the opposite direction. Concealment was impossible; there
was nothing for it but to walk straight up to them and greet them.
‘What are you doing, running around like this?’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘I thought
you were supposed to be ill.’
Fivey forced herself to smile.
‘I’ve been a bit better this last day or two, so Mother brought me into the Garden
with her for a change of air. I’ve just been to Green Delights for her, to deliver
something.’
‘That can’t be right,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘I saw your mother go out of the
Garden just now; that’s why I shut the gate. If she’d really sent you to Green Delights,
why didn’t she tell me you were still inside? Why did she go out and let me lock the
gate without saying anything? You must be lying.’
Fivey was momentarily at a loss for a reply.
‘Actually she told me this morning but I forgot,’ she stammered. ‘I only just now
remembered. Probably she didn’t say anything about my being in here because she
thought I’d already gone home.’
Observing her confusion and the halting nature of her reply, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife
remembered that Silver had lately reported some things missing from Lady Wang’s
apartment which none of the other maids would admit to having taken and
wondered if Fivey might be the thief. It was unfortunate for Fivey that Ciggy and
Lotus, together with a number of older servants, should have arrived on the scene at
that moment and helped to confirm her suspicion.
‘Give her a good grilling, Mrs Lin!’ said one of these new arrivals. ‘She’s been
sneaking to and fro all over the place this last day or two. I don’t know what she’s
been up to, but she’s certainly been up to something.’
‘Yes,’ said Ciggy, ‘and Silver told me yesterday that when they opened that
cupboard in Her Ladyship’s side room the other day they found a whole lot of things
missing. They noticed there was a bottle short when Mrs Lian sent Patience over for
some Essence of Roses, otherwise they’d never have thought of looking.’
‘Oh?’ said Lotus with a pleased-looking smirk. ‘I didn’t know about that. As a
matter of fact I’ve seen a bottle of Essence of Roses somewhere today.’
‘Where?’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife asked eagerly. Ever since the bottle from Lady Wang’s
cupboard had been found missing, Xi-feng had been sending Patience round daily to
inquire about the progress of her investigations and she was under great pressure to
discover the thief.
‘In her mother’s kitchen,’ said Lotus.
Lanterns were lit and the little party hurried off to investigate, Fivey protesting
anxiously as they went:
‘But that little bottle came from Master Bao’s room. It was given to me by
Parfumée.’
‘Parfumy!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife contemptuously. ‘If we find the evidence in the
kitchen, I shall have to report it, and that’s that. It will be up to you to explain
yourself to the mistresses if you can.’
By now they had reached the kitchen and some of them, led by Lotus, went inside to
look. They came out almost immediately with the bottle. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, thinking
that there might be other stolen articles in the kitchen, ordered a thorough search, in
the course of which the packet of lycoperdon was discovered. Taking this and the
rose essence as evidence, they now led Fivey off to face Li Wan and Tan-chun.
But Li Wan would not see them. Jia Lan was ill, and she was too busy looking after
him to have time for household business. They should see Miss Tan about it, she said.
Tan-chun was not in the office, having already returned to her own apartment. Off
they all trooped then to Tan-chun’s place, where one of their number went inside to
announce their business. The maids were all in the courtyard enjoying the cool
evening air. Tan-chun was inside, washing her hair, they said. Scribe went indoors to
report. It seemed an age before she re-emerged.
‘I told Miss Tan. She said you’d better find Patience and ask her to see Mrs Lian
about it.’
So off they went once more, this time to Wang Xi-feng’s place, where they told their
business to Patience. Patience, on going inside to report, found that her mistress had
just gone to bed. Xi-feng heard her through, after which she gave judgement
summarily as follows:
‘Give the mother forty strokes, turn her out of the Garden, and make sure that she
is never employed inside the Inner Gate again. Give Fivey forty strokes too and pack
her off to the grange. They can either sell her or marry her to one of the hands.’
Patience relayed this verdict, word for word, to Lin Zhi?xiao’s wife and the others
waiting outside. Fivey, shocked and weeping, threw herself on her knees at
Patience’s feet and explained to her how Parfumee had given her the rose essence as
a present.
‘We can clear that up easily enough,’ said Patience. ‘All we’ve got to do is wait until
we can ask Parfumée tomorrow to find out whether she gave it to you or not. But
what about this lycoperdon stuff? That was brought here as a present for Their
Ladyships. No one had the right to touch that before Their Ladyships had seen it.’
Fivey explained that the packet of powder came not from Lady Wang’s store but from
her uncle’s share of the surplus that had been given as a douceur to the gate-people.
‘That puts you in the clear then,’ said Patience, smiling. ‘It’s beginning to look as if
you are wearing the hat for someone else.’ She turned to Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘It’s too
late to do anything about this now. Mrs Lian has just taken her medicine and gone to
bed; I can’t go pestering her about a little thing like this at this time of night. You’d
better hand her over to the night watch and tell them to look after her until the
morning. I’ll explain it all to Mrs Lian tomorrow, and we’ll see what we can do.’
Lacking the confidence to dispute this countermanding by Patience of her mistress’s
orders, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife conducted Fivey outside and handed her into the custody
of the watch before continuing about her own business.
Though still unbound, Fivey was unable to move freely and was obliged to stay where
she was put and listen to the ill-natured comments of the old women. Some of them,
assum?ing as a matter of course that she was guilty, rebuked her for her misconduct;
others complained of the trouble that she was causing them.
‘As if we haven’t got work enough already, they have to give us this thief to mind,’
they grumbled. ‘If she does herself an injury or gives us the slip while we’re not
looking, we shall get into trouble!’
And those who in the past had got on badly with her mother rejoiced in the
daughter’s discomfiture and lost no opportunity of taunting and abusing her.
Poor Fivey! Her heart was full of the injustice of it, but there was no one to pour out
her troubles to. The hardships of that night were doubly distressing to a person of
her weak and ailing constitution: no one to give her tea or even a cup of water when
she was thirsty, no pillow or bedding for her to lie on - even if she had felt like
sleeping. The wretched girl spent the whole night in almost continuous weeping.
The enemies of Fivey and her mother, disappointed that the sentence could not be
carried out on them immediately and fearful that the morrow might bring some
remission, rose up next morning at crack of dawn and went secretly to Patience,
hoping, by means of bribes and flattery, to buy her over. They extolled her
resoluteness and drew her attention to various past misdemeanours of Cook Liu in
order to strengthen the evidence against her. Patience accepted their presents,
listened politely to their advice, and as soon as they had gone, slipped quietly over to
Green Delights and asked Aroma whether Parfumée had in fact given some Essence
of Roses to Fivey.
‘I certainly gave some to Parfumée,’ said Aroma, ‘but whether or not she passed it
on to someone else, I couldn’t say.’
She called in Parfumée to ask her. Parfumée, in some alarm, at once confirmed that
she had given the bottle to Fivey and went off to tell Bao-yu what had happened.
Bao?yu was as shocked as she was.
‘The Essence of Roses is no problem,’ he said; ‘but what about the Lycoperdon
Snow? I’m sure what she told them about it was the truth, but if it gets known that
her uncle took it while on duty, then he’s going to get into trouble -which seems a
rather poor exchange for his kindness.’
He thought he had better see Patience himself and point this out to her.
‘Look,’ he said, ‘the Essence of Roses can be accounted for easily enough, but that
Lycoperdon Snow business still looks a bit fishy. Why don’t you be a nice, kind girl,
Patience, and tell them that the Lycoperdon Snow was given to her by Parfumee as
well? Then that disposes of the whole affair.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Patience, smiling, ‘but she told everyone last night that
her uncle gave it to her. How can she now make out that she got it from you? And
apart from that, don’t forget that the bottle of Essence of Roses from Her Ladyship’s
room has still to be accounted for. If this isn’t it, where are they going to look for it?
It’s not very likely that anyone else will own up to having taken it.’
Skybright stepped over at this point to join in the discussion.
‘The Essence of Roses from Her Ladyship’s place must have been stolen by Sunset
to give to young Huan. It’s as plain as the nose on your face. I don’t understand why
you’re all making such a mystery of it.’
‘I know that as well as you do,’ said Patience, ‘but it’s not so simple. Silver, who was
so worried about finding that bottle missing that she was in tears, did go, very quietly
and nicely, and ask Sunset if she had taken it, and if Sunset had had the grace to say
‘yes’, Silver herself would have done nothing, and I’m quite sure that no one else
would have made an issue of it. Who’s going to stir up trouble about a little thing like
that? But unfortunately not only would Sunset not admit to having taken it, but she
even had the gall to accuse Silver of taking it herself. The two of them made such a
hullabaloo between them that soon everyone in the household had heard about it.
By that stage I couldn’t ignore the matter any longer, even if I’d wanted to. I had to
investigate it. And the first thing I found, of course, was that the one doing all the
accusing was actually the thief. But without any evidence, there was nothing much I
could do.’
‘I can take responsibility for that too,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You can tell them I stole the
bottle from Her Ladyship’s room to give the girls a scare. Now everything is
accounted for.’
‘No doubt it’s an act of merit to clear someone else of suspicion,’ said Aroma, ‘but
Her Ladyship won’t be very pleased when she hears. She’ll say you’ve been up to
your old childish tricks again.’
‘Oh, that’s of no consequence,’ said Patience. ‘We could of course clear this matter
up quite easily by looking for the stolen bottle in Mrs Zhao’s room. The only reason I
hesitate to do that is because I’m afraid it would make things difficult for a certain
person whose feelings I do care about very much. I know she would be distressed,
and the last thing I want to do is “damage the jade vase while trying to hit the
mouse”.’
She held three fingers up as she said this to indicate that it was Tan-chun she was
referring to. Aroma and the rest nodded in agreement.
‘That’s true. Perhaps it would be better if Bao-yu took all the blame.’
‘Yes,’ said Patience, ‘but at the same time I think we ought to call Sunset and Silver
here and get this matter properly sorted out. We don’t want whoever it is to think
she can get away with it. If we do nothing, she’s sure to think it’s be?cause we
haven’t the wit to find out rather than that it’s for the reason I’ve just said, and she’ll
think she can go on stealing things with impunity.’
This being agreed on, Patience sent someone to call them over.
‘Well, you can stop worrying now, you two,’ she said when they had arrived. ‘They
think they’ve found the thief.’
‘Where is she?’ said Silver.
‘At the moment she’s in Mrs Lian’s room being questioned,’ said Patience. ‘She’s
admitted taking everything they’ve asked her about. I happen to know myself that
she didn’t take them and is only confessing because she’s frightened. Master Bao
can’t bear the idea of an innocent person suffering and has already agreed to take
responsibility for some of them. As regards the rest, I could tell them who the real
thief is, but there are certain difficulties. One is that the real thief is a very good
friend of mine. The other is that the receiver of stolen goods, who is a pretty poor
specimen, is closely related to a very nice person who would be very much upset if all
of this were to come into the open. It looks as if I shall have to ask Master Bao to take
responsibility for the whole lot, so that everyone is clear of suspicion. Before I do
that, however, there’s something I should like to be clear about first. Can I be sure, if I
do ask him to do us this favour, that everyone is going to be a bit more careful in
future? Because if not, then rather than stand by and see an innocent person suffer, I
shall have to tell all I know to Mrs Lian.’
A blush had overspread Sunset’s face while Patience was saying this. Her natural
decency suddenly getting the better of her compelled her now to speak.
‘Don’t worry, Patience. There’s no need for any innocent person to suffer and
there’s no need for that other person you mentioned to be upset. I stole those things.
It was because Mrs Zhao kept on at me to take them. I stole them to give to Huan.
Even when Her Ladyship was here I often used to steal things for him, so that he
could give them away to his friends. I thought that the fuss made when they found
out that things were missing would die down in a day or two. I can’t stand by and let
an innocent person take the blame. You’ll have to take me with you to Mrs Lian and
let me make a clean breast of it.’
Her courage took all of them by surprise.
‘You’re a good sort, Sunset, I always knew you were,’ said Bao-yu admiringly, ‘but
there’s really no need for you to tell her. All I’ve got to do is say that I stole those
things for a lark, to give you all a scare, and that now there’s been all this fuss about
them, I feel I ought to own up. There’s only one thing, though. I really must ask you
girls to be more careful in future, for all our sakes.’
‘I did it,’ said Sunset, ‘it’s up to me to face the music.’
Patience and Aroma disagreed.
‘That’s not the way to look at it at all. If you confess, they’re sure to worm
something out about Mrs Zhao, and that will upset Miss Tan again when she gets to
hear about it. You’d much better let Master Bao accept responsibility, so that
everyone is cleared. Nobody except the few of us here knows the truth, so it’s
terribly easy for him to do this. But as Master Bao says, you really will have to be
more careful in future. If you must take anything, at least wait until Her Ladyship is
here. When she is back, you can give the whole room away if you like, because then
we shan’t be involved!’
Sunset hung her head and pondered for some moments before finally agreeing to go
along with this.
When it was settled exactly what they should do, Patience went with Parfumee and
the two maids from Lady Wang’s apartment to the watch-room, called out Fivey, and
quietly instructed her to say that the Lycoperdon Snow as well as the Essence of
Roses had been given to her by Parfumée. Fivey was deeply grateful. Patience next
took Fivey with her to Wang Xi-feng’s place, where Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and her helpers
had already been waiting for some time with Fivey’s mother in their custody.
‘I brought her here first thing,’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife told Patience in reference to her
prisoner. ‘As that left no one to get the lunch ready, I put Qin Xian’s wife temporarily
in charge, so that the young ladies should get their meal on time.’
‘Who is Qin Xian’s wife?’ said Patience. ‘I don’t think I know her.’
‘She does night duty in the south corner of the Garden. She doesn’t do anything in
the daytime: that’s probably why you don’t know her. Very high cheek-bones and big
round eyes. She’s a very clean, lively little body.’
‘Yes, of course you know her, Patience,’ said Silver. ‘She’s the auntie of Miss Ying’s
maid, Chess. Chess’s father works for Sir She, but her uncle and auntie work on this
side of the mansion with us.’
Patience remembered with a laugh.
‘Oh, that’s who you’ve chosen! If you’d told me that, I should have known who you
meant.’ She laughed again. ‘You’ve been a bit too quick with your appointment. It’s
all cleared up now, this business. The waters have gone down and we can see the
rocks. We know now who the real thief was who stole that stuff from Her Ladyship’s
room. It was Bao-yu. He went round to Her Ladyship’s apartment some days ago and
asked Silver and Sunset for something and just for a tease the silly girls said he
couldn’t have it, because they couldn’t give him anything while Her Ladyship was
away. So he simply slipped in later on when they weren’t there and helped himself.
When these two found the things missing, they were scared out of their wits. But as
soon as Bao-yu heard that someone else had been accused of taking the things, he
told me everything. He even brought them round to show me, so that I could see
they exactly corresponded with what the girls had told me was missing. As regards
the Lycoperdon Snow, that was something that Bao-yu had got from outside. He’s
been giving it away to all kinds of people - not only in the Garden: one or two of the
old nannies begged some off him to give to their relations outside and they have
given it to other people as presents; and Aroma gave some of hers to Parfumee and
that lot and they’ve been passing the stuff to and fro between them?selves. So you
see, it’s all over the place. The two baskets that were left in the jobs room the other
day for Their Ladyships are still untouched. The seals on them haven’t been broken.
So as far as that’s concerned, there are no grounds for a charge either. If you’ll wait
here a few moments longer, I’m just going in to tell Mrs Lian about this and we’ll see
what she says.’
Patience then went into the bedroom and repeated almost verbatim to Xi-feng what
she had just been telling Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife.
‘That’s as may be,’ said Xi-feng when she had finished; ‘but we all know how ready
Bao-yu is to cover up for other people. Someone only has to go to him with a
hard-luck story - especially if there’s a bit of flattery thrown in with it - and he’ll own
up to anything in order to get them off. If we believe him now, how are we going to
deal with more serious cases later on? I think this needs going into more carefully. I
think you ought to get hold of those girls from Her Ladyship’s apartment and - well, I
wouldn’t say torture them exactly, but you could get them to kneel in the sun on
broken china all day without anything to eat or drink. If one day doesn’t make them
confess, just go on day after day until they do. They’re sure to give in sooner or later,
even if they’re made of iron.’
‘And as for that Liu woman,’ she went on, ‘you know what they say. When flies
gather on an egg, it’s generally a sign that there’s a crack in it. She may not have
stolen anything in this instance, but I suspect she’s no better than she should be for
all these people to be complaining about her. We’ll let her off the flogging, of course,
but I still think we ought to dismiss her. Even in the Emperor’s court people get
punished for what they call “guilt by association”, so she can’t complain if we sack
her merely on suspicion.’
‘Yes, but why bother?’ said Patience. ‘They say that where mercy is possible, mercy
should be shown. What better opportunity than this could you have of showing
yourself merciful for once? Look at all the trouble you give your?self on account of
these people, and they aren’t even your own household: it’s Lady Xing’s household
that you really belong to. And where does it all get you, at the end of the day? All you
do is build up a lot of resentment against yourself and turn a lot of nasty, spiteful
people into your enemies. A person in your delicate health can’t afford to make
enemies. Think of all the time it took you to conceive a man-child - and then to lose it
after carrying it inside you for six or seven months! How do we know that that wasn’t
brought on by too much worrying about this sort of thing? I think you ought to start
straight away taking things a bit easier. Close your eyes to things a bit oftener. “What
the eye doesn’t see the heart doesn’t grieve”!’
Patience’s little homily quickly won Xi-feng to a better humour.
‘All right,’ she said, laughing. ‘Do as you wish. I’m not going to get myself worked up
about it.’
‘Now you’re talking sensibly,’ said Patience happily, and going out of the bedroom,
proceeded to dispose of the business outside in the way she had all along intended
to.
But more of that in the next chapter.

‘It’s the sign of a really thriving household,’ said Patience, ‘that their big troubles
turn into little ones and their little ones into nothing at all. To make a great song and
dance over a trifle like this would be plain ridiculous. You can take them both back to
the kitchen. The mother is to keep her job. Qin Xian’s wife will have to go back where
she came from. There is to be no further mention of this matter. Let there be no
slackening in the daily inspection of the Garden, though. That’s most important.’
As she turned to go, Cook Liu and her daughter stepped quickly forwards and
kotowed their thanks. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife then conducted them back to the Garden,
after which she reported to Li Wan and Tan-chun on what had been decided. Both
expressed satisfaction that the matter had resolved itself without further trouble.
The victory that had been gained by Chess and her faction was thus an empty one,
and Qin Xian’s wife, that aunt of Chess’s whose installation in the kitchen had been
the result of long and patient scheming, enjoyed only the briefest moment of
triumph in her new position. Beginning in a great bustle with a general stock-taking
of the kitchen’s equipment and stores, she detected - or claimed to detect - various
shortages in the latter. Two piculs of best rice were missing, she said; a month’s
supply of general purpose rice had been overdrawn; and the amount of charcoal was
not what it was supposed to be. While so engaged, she was at the same time making
discreet arrangements for the conveyance of various ‘presents’ (they included, by a
strange coincidence, a pannier of charcoal and a load of rice) to Lin Zhi-xiao’s
quarters outside; and there were to be presents for the clerks who worked in
Accounts. She also prepared several dishes for a little repast to which she invited her
new colleagues.
‘Now that I’ve got this job, I rely entirely on your support to run things here,’ she
told them. ‘So if there are any little matters that I fall down in, I shall look to you all
to help me out.’
Suddenly, in the midst of this activity, new orders arrived:
‘As soon as you have finished serving this lunch, you must leave. Liu has been
cleared. They’re putting her back in charge here.’
Stunned though she was by this news, the wretched woman had at once to begin
packing her things, and soon, with drums muffled and colours furled, beat a hasty
retreat from the kitchen. The things she had given away to others - pointlessly, it now
appeared - had to be made good, in some cases by selling her own possessions. Even
Chess, for all her fury, was powerless to help her.
Ever since the fuss made by Silver about the missing objects, Aunt Zhao, the secret
recipient of many of the things which Sunset had stolen, had been living in fear of
discovery. Each day, as she made her surreptitious inquiries about the current
progress of investigations, she perspired afresh. When Sunset herself suddenly came
in and announced that Bao-yu had owned up and that there was nothing more to
fear, she was naturally very much relieved. The effect on Jia Huan, however, was
somewhat different. He immediately became suspicious, and taking out all the things
that Sunset had been at such pains to get for him, he threw them in her face.
‘Two-faced thing!’ he shouted. ‘You must be thick with Bao-yu or he wouldn’t have
covered up for you. If you were prepared to take those things in the first place, you
ought to have kept quiet about it and not told anyone. Now that you’ve told him, I
don’t want them any more. They would only remind me of your treachery.’
Sunset swore by the most desperate oaths that she had been faithful to him; she
even wept; but Jia Huan was adamant.
‘If it weren’t that we used to be friends,’ he said, ‘I’d go straight along now to Aunt
Lian and tell her that you stole those things. I’d tell her that you offered them to me,
but I wouldn’t take them. Think about that then, and consider yourself lucky to have
got away with it!’
With those words he flounced out of the room, to the great indignation of his mother,
who shouted after him angrily.
‘Ungrateful little blackguard! What do you mean by it?’
Sunset meanwhile was weeping as if her heart would break.
‘Poor child!’ said Aunt Zhao, trying to comfort her. ‘He doesn’t appreciate you. But
at least I know you are faithful to him. Let me look after these things for you. He’s
sure to come round to a more sensible way of thinking in a day or two.’
She would have taken them, but Sunset forestalled her, sweeping them angrily into a
bundle, which, when no one was looking, she carried into the Garden and emptied
out over the lake. Some of the things sank straight to the bottom, the rest floated
about on the surface of the water. She was still angry when she went to bed, and
cried all night long under the bed-clothes.
*
The day of Bao-yu’s birthday arrived - the same day, it had been discovered, as that
on which Bao-qin had hers. Because Lady Wang was away, rather less fuss was made
of it than in previous years. There were the customary four kinds of birthday present
from Abbot Zhang together with a new amulet to replace the one he had worn
during the previous year, and from the monks and nuns of various temples a token
share of the day’s offerings accompanied by such other little gifts as the religious are
wont to give on these occasions: little figures of Old Longevity, sacred colour-prints,
offertory scrolls, talismans inscribed with his personal star guardian, and annually
renewable lockets inscribed with the current year-star. A number of the blind
ballad-singers both male and female regularly patronized by the household called in
to offer their colourful felicitations. His uncle Wang Zi-teng’s family sent him the
usual suit of clothes and two pairs of shoes and socks, together with a hundred little
peach-shaped birthday cakes and a hundred little bundles of the finest ‘silver thread’
vermicelli. From his Aunt Xue he received ex?actly the same presents as from his
uncle but in appropriately reduced amounts. The only other presents from senior
members of the family were a pair of shoes from You-shi and a heavily-embroidered
‘propitious encounter’ purse with a tiny gold image of Old Longevity in it and a piece
of Persian ware from Xi-feng. As in previous years, a distribution of alms was made
on his behalf to the monks of various temples.
And then of course there were Bao-qin’s presents; but to enumerate them as well
would be tedious.
The presents which Bao-yu received from the girls were of a less formal nature and
chosen more to mark the occasion than for their intrinsic value: a fan from one, a
specimen of calli?graphy from another, a painting or a poem.
On the morning of his birthday Bao-yu rose at dawn, and after completing his toilet,
put on his most formal clothes and went out to the main front courtyard of the
mansion, where Li Gui and three other of his grooms were waiting for him by a table
they had’ made ready with an incense burner and candlesticks and offerings as an
altar to Heaven and Earth. Bao-yu lit some sticks of incense and made his
prostrations, poured out a libation of tea, and burned the paper offerings and
offertory scrolls. Then he went round to the Ning-guo mansion and kotowed his
respects to the ancestors, first in the shrine and then in the hall. Emerging from the
latter, he knelt down on the terrace outside and ‘kotowed upwards’ to his absent
dear ones - Grandmother Jia, Jia Zheng and Lady Wang - rising on his knees after
each prostration and lifting his clasped hands up in front of him. He called in at the
main apartment on his way out and made his kotow to You-shi, after which he sat
and talked to her for a bit before returning to Rong-guo House. His first visit there
was to Aunt Xue, who made vigorous - though, of course, unsuccessful at?tempts to
prevent his kotowing to her. After that he called on Xue Ke, who was slightly senior to
Bao-yu but not enough to warrant an obeisance and whose efforts to prevent a
kotow, therefore, were more successful. After exchanging a few words with Xue Ke,
he went back into the Garden. There he found Skybright and Musk waiting for him.
They were accompanied by two junior maids holding a red carpet which was
intended for kneeling on. Attended by these four, he now proceeded to visit all those
in the Garden beginning with Li Wan who were senior to himself. Then back to the
mansion again and out through the inner gate to call on Nannie Li and three other of
his former nannies, with each of whom he was expected to spend some time in
conversation. On his way back the servants inside the Garden gate would have liked
to kotow to him, but he would not let them; and when he was once more back in his
room, Aroma and the other maids offered him only verbal greetings and did not
attempt to kneel. Lady Wang had forbidden the maids to kotow to younger members
of the family for fear it might shorten their lives.
Soon after this Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived. Aroma prevented them from kneeling
and made them sit down for a while. As soon as they had gone, Bao-yu declared
himself tired out by all the walking he had done and put his feet up on the bed. But
not for long. He had barely had time to drink half a cupful of tea when there was a
confused sound of chatter?ing and giggling outside and eight or nine maids burst
laugh?ing into the room. There was Ebony and Periwinkle and Kingfisher and Picture,
Xing Xiu-yan’s maid Signet, the nursemaid carrying Xi-feng’s little girl Qiao-jie, and
two of the maids from Lady Wang’s room, Avis and Avocet. He noticed that they
were carrying a red carpet between them.
‘Where are the birthday noodles?’ they said. ‘See how your doorway is crowded
with people who have come to wish you happy returns!’
No sooner were the maids inside than Tan-chun, Xiang-yun, Ba-qin, Xiu-yan and
Xi-chun appeared behind them. Bao-yu hurried out to greet them. ‘How kind of you
all to come!’ he said, and as he ushered them inside, he called out to Aroma to get
them all some tea. A great deal of polite tussling ensued before his guests could
finally be persuaded to sit down. Aroma now brought in tea for them all on a tray;
but they had taken no more than a sip of it when Patience arrived, dressed to the
nines in all her finery, and Bao-yu had to get up once more and hurry out to greet
her.
‘When I went to Feng’s place just now,’ he said, ‘the person who announced me
told me that she couldn’t see me, so I asked if I might see you instead. Why wouldn’t
you let me?’
‘The first time you sent in I couldn’t come out because I was doing your Cousin
Feng’s hair,’ said Patience. ‘When you sent in the second time and said that you
wanted me to receive you in her place, I naturally couldn’t let you because it would
have been too great an honour. It is I who should kotow to you -which is what I have
come to do now.’
‘But that’s too great an honour for me!’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
Aroma nevertheless brought a chair over and made Bao-yu sit in it. Patience made
him a curtsey. Bao-yu, already on his feet again, answered it with a bow and pumped
his hands. Patience went down on her knees. Bao-yu knelt down too. At once Aroma
raised Patience to her feet, whereupon she curtseyed to Bao-yu once more and
Bao-yu, who had got up when she did, answered her with another bow and another
pumping of the hands.
‘Now another one,’ said Aroma smiling and giving him a nudge.
‘Why?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ve finished.’
‘She’s finished making her birthday reverence to you,’ said Aroma; ‘but it’s her
birthday today too, so you still have to make yours to her.’
Bao-yu bowed again, delightedly.
‘So it’s your birthday too, Patience?’
Patience returned his bow with another curtsey.
Xiang-yun took hold of Bao-qin with one hand and Xiu-yan with the other.
‘At this rate the four of you are going to be making rever?ences to each other all
day long!’
‘Oh, of course!’ said Tan-chun. ‘It’s Cousin Xing’s birth?day as well. I’d quite
forgotten.’
She turned to one of the maids:
‘Go and tell Mrs Lian about this; and get them to send another lot of presents like
the ones they did for Miss Qin to Miss Ying’s apartment.’
The maid went off to do her bidding. Now that the fact that today was her birthday
had become public knowledge, Xiu-yan was obliged to make a round of the
apartments, bowing and kotowing to everybody, as Bao-yu had had to do before her.
‘Interesting, all these coincidences,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You expect a few birthdays
every month; but it’s only when you get a lot of people living together like us that
you begin getting two or three of them on the same day. We even have a birthday on
New Year’s Day in this family: Yuan-chun’s. She comes first in that as in everything
else. I suppose that’s what makes her so lucky. It was great-grandfather’s birthday as
well, New Year’s Day. The fifteenth of the first month is Aunt Xing’s birthday and also
Cousin Chai’s - another coincidence. The first of the third month is Mother’s birthday.
The ninth of the third is Cousin Lian’s. We haven’t got anyone with a birthday in the
second month.’
   ‘Yes you have,’ said Aroma. ‘Miss Lin’s is in the second month, on the
twenty-second. It’s true there’s no one of your surname, though.’
‘My memory is hopeless!’ said Tan-chun.
‘Not at all,’ said Bao-yu. He pointed smilingly at Aroma: ‘She only remembers it
because her own birthday is on that day.’
      ‘Oh, you’re on the same day as her, are you? I don’t recollect your ever having
come round and kotowed to me on that day,’ said Tan-chun teasingly. ‘And Patience:
this is the first time I’ve heard that your birthday was today.’
      ‘What sort of great ladies do you think we are to be bothering with birthdays?’
said Patience. ‘Kotows and birthday presents are not for the likes of us. My birthday
is just another day, to be got through with as little fuss as possible. I don’t suppose
you’d ever have known about it at all if she hadn’t let on. Now that you do know, I’ll
gladly come round and kotow to you when you get back later to your room.’
      ‘I don’t in the least want you to do that,’ said Tan-chun. ‘On the other hand, I
should very much like us to celebrate your birthday for once. In fact, I shan’t be
content unless we do.’
      ‘Hear, hear!’ said Bao-yu and Xiang-yun.
Tan-chun gave instructions to one of the maids:
      ‘Go to Mrs Lian and tell her, from us all, that we want to keep Patience with us
for the day. Tell her we are going to pool together and celebrate her birthday.’
The maid went off, laughing excitedly. It was some time before she returned with
Xi-feng’s answer.
‘Mrs Lian says thank you very much for the honour you are doing her. She says she
doesn’t know what you will be giving Patience to eat, but provided you let her have
some of it, she will agree to leave her here in peace.’
The cousins and maids all laughed when they heard this message.
‘It so happens that, as the birthday noodles and all the other things needed for
today’s meals are being seen to by the big kitchen outside, the Garden kitchen has
got nothing to do today,’ said Tan-chun. ‘So when we’ve made our collection, we can
give it to Cook Liu and get her to prepare this private party for us in the Garden
kitchen.’
The others having readily agreed that this would be best, Tan-chun sent someone to
tell Li Wan, Bao-chai and Dai-yu what had been decided and invite them to
contribute. She also sent for Cook Liu and asked her to prepare a two-table banquet
in the Garden kitchen. Somewhat puzzled by this request, Cook Liu pointed out that
on this particular occasion the catering was all being done in the outside kitchen.
‘Yes,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but this is only for us. Today is Patience’s birthday and we
want to pool together and have a special little party for her. So do something nice for
us, will you? You can bring the bill to my place afterwards and I will give you the
money.’
‘Miss Patience’s birthday today?’ said Cook Liu. ‘Well I never!’ And she stepped
briskly forward and made her a kotow. Patience bent over in confusion and raised her
to her feet.
The cook hurried off to begin preparations. Tan-chun now invited Bao-yu to
accompany her to the ‘jobs room’ and break his fast there with some noodles.
Hav?ing first waited for Li Wan and Bao-chai to arrive, she sent someone to ask if
Aunt Xue and Dai-yu would care to join them. Now that the weather was warmer,
Dai-yu’s illness was very much better than it had been and she was able to come.
With so many people in party dresses the crowded office was beginning to take on
an unusually gay and festive appearance. Unfortunately a formal present for Bao-yu -
a handkerchief, a fan, some sticks of incense and a length of silk - arrived at that
moment from Xue Ke, and Bao-yu had to abandon the female company of the office
and go to take noodles with Xue Ke.
Since the Xue and Jia families each had a birthday on this same day, each was
supposed to entertain the other with birthday wine. Accordingly, at about noon that
day, Bao-qin was brought over by Bao-chai to make a birthday reverence to her elder
brother and to wait on him and Bao-yu while they drank the wine. But Bao-chai was
impatient of punctilio.
‘There is no need for you to send our wine over there,’ she told Xue Ke. ‘This year
at least we can dispense with those empty formalities. You can invite our employees
from the shop in to help you finish it. Cousin Bao and I must go back to the Garden
now. Excuse us for leaving you like this, but we have other people there waiting for
us to entertain them.’
‘I won’t try to detain you then,’ said Xue Ke politely. ‘To tell the truth, our people
from the shop will feel freer to call here when you are gone.’
Having apologized to Xue Ke on his own account, Bao-yu accompanied the two girls
back into the Garden. As they passed into it through the corner gate, Bao-chai made
the women there lock it up after them and hand her the key.
‘Why is it necessary to lock this gate?’ Bao-yu asked her. ‘There are only a few
people using it, and now that you and Aunt and Qin are all three living in the Garden,
it must be an awful nuisance if you have to lock and unlock it every time you need to
go and fetch something from your place outside.’
‘One can’t be too careful,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Look at all the incidents you people have
been having during the past few days; yet not once have any of our people been
implicated. I put that down entirely to the fact that this gate is kept constantly locked.
If it were left open, other people besides us would want to use it for the convenience
of taking short cuts; and as it would be too invidious to begin distinguishing between
who might use the gate and who might not, it is better to keep it permanently locked
and stop everyone using it, even though it means a certain amount of inconvenience
for Mamma and me, because at least it ensures that when there is any trouble none
of out people will be under suspicion.’
‘You heard about the missing objects, then?’ Bao-yu asked her.
‘You mean the Essence of Roses and Lycoperdon Snow?’ said Bao-chai. ‘I don’t
suppose you would have known even about them if your own protege’s had not been
involved. No, I was thinking about something rather more serious than that
-something which, for all our sakes, I hope will never come to light. If it does, a great
many people will be implicated. I can tell you this, because you have nothing to do
with the management of the household. I told Patience the other day too. Patience is
an intelligent girl, and as her mistress cannot get about now, I thought she ought to
know about it. As I say, I hope nothing will come of it; but if it does blow up, Patience
will have been warned and will know how to safeguard herself against being
wrongfully accused again. Bear in mind what I am saying so that you are warned, too,
if anything should happen. But don’t let anyone else know that I told you this.’
They had been approaching Drenched Blossoms while she was speaking. In the
pavilion at the centre of the bridge a group of ten or so girls - Aroma, Caltrop, Scribe,
Skybright, Musk, Parfumée, étamine, Nénuphar and one or two others they could
not identify - were leaning over the railings looking at the fish in the water below. As
Bao-yu and his two cousins approached, they chorused out to them:
‘The party’s all ready in the Peony Garden. Hurry up and take your places!’
Taking the maids with them, the cousins made their way to the lakeside Peony
Garden in the midst of which was the large, open summerhouse where the tables for
the party had been laid. Even You-shi had been invited and was already sitting there
waiting for them. In fact, by now almost every?one had arrived except Patience
herself.
Patience had intended to drop in only briefly at Xi-feng’s house in order to change
into something more suitable for the party; but no sooner had she reached it than
presents began arriving from the Lin and Lai households. The bearers of these proved
to be only the forerunners of a stream of callers from every level of the domestic staff,
who arrived in twos and threes, bringing her gifts or offering their congratulations.
Patience was kept continuously busy dealing with these callers, rewarding the
deliverers of gifts, thanking those who had come in person to felicitate her, and
running in and out to show her presents to Xi-feng. She kept only a few of these for
herself; the rest she either courteously returned or immediately gave away. Even
when she had finished with her visitors she had to serve Xi-feng her lunch of noodles
and wait until she had finished it before she was at last able to get changed and hurry
back into the Garden.
A number of maids who had been sent out by the others to look for her took charge
of her as she entered it and carried her off to the summerhouse. It was a dazzling
sight there that met her eyes: not perhaps the
chelonian tables, lotus-cushioned chairs
of the poet; but no effort had been spared to make it an eye-catching and appetizing
spread.
A friendly laugh greeted her arrival.
‘Now all the birthday folk are here!’
They wanted to make her and the other three – Bao-yu, Bao-qin and Xiu-yan - sit at
the head of the feast, but as Aunt Xue was present, all four of them naturally refused.
‘A slow old buffer like me is no fit company for you young people,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘I
should only feel uncomfortable if I stayed. Let me go and lie down in the jobs room. I
don’t feel like eating anything and I’m not much of a drinker. You will be much better
able to look after your guests if I am not here.’
You-shi and the others loudly insisted that she should stay. Only Bao-chai dissented.
‘Whether or not we should get on better without Mamma,’ she said, ‘I’m sure
Mamma herself would be happier lying down in the jobs room than sitting here with
us. If there is anything here she fancies, we can have it sent over to her and she will
be able to eat it there on her own in comfort. Besides, there is no one in charge there
at the moment. If Mamma is there, she will be able to keep an eye on things.’
     ‘Oh well, in that case we’ll let her go,’ said Tan-chun smiling. ‘Obedience is the
best obeisance, as they say.’
     She went with the others to escort her aunt to the jobs room and personally
supervised the arrangement of various pillows and cushions by the junior maids.
     ‘Now,’ she said to these junior maids when Aunt Xue had been comfortably
settled, ‘if you will stay here and massage Mrs Xue’s legs for her and fetch her tea or
anything when she asks you without making up all sorts of wonderful excuses, I
shouldn’t be surprised if later on, when we send some nice things for her to eat, she
doesn’t give some of them to you. So mind you don’t go away!’
     The girls all promised that they would stay.
     When they got back, Tan-chun made Bao-qin and Xiu-yan sit at the head of the
top table and Patience and Bao-yu at right-angles to them on the left and right ends.
She and Faith?ful sat shoulder to shoulder on the fourth side, facing Bao-qin and
Xiu-yan. At the table parallel to the west wall Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun, Ying-chun
and Xi-chun sat in order of seniority on the two longer sides and Caltrop and Silver
on the shorter sides, one at either end. You-shi and Li Wan sat at the longer sides of
the table parallel to the east wall, with Aroma and Sunset to left and right of them on
the shorter sides. The fourth table was occupied by the remaining maids, Nightingale,
Oriole, Skybright, Periwinkle and Chess, sitting around it in no particular order.
      No sooner were they all seated than Tan-chun rose to her feet again, wine-kettle
in hand, intending to drink toasts with each of the four ‘birthday people’; but the
birthday four, realizing that if they allowed one of their hosts to do this, a dozen or
more would follow, objected strenuously.
      ‘If you are going to start this nonsense,’ said Bao-qin, ‘we shall none of us get
settled until evening.’
      The point was taken and Tan-chun sat down again, where?upon the blind
ballad-singers, who had tagged along with the others, began tuning their instruments
for a birthday ode. This time everyone objected.
      ‘None of us like that old stuff. Why don’t you go to the jobs room and entertain
Mrs Xue?’
While they were about it, they made a selection from the various dishes on the table
for the people conducting the blind women to take with them to Aunt Xue.
‘Just sitting here making polite conversation is not going to be much fun,’ said
Bao-yu when the singers had been disposed of. ‘We ought to play a drinking game.’
Various suggestions were made, but none met with everyone’s approval.
‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Why not write the names of different games down
on slips of paper and put it to the draw?’
‘Good idea!’ said the others, and sent for an inkstone and writing-brush and some
slips of fancy paper.
To Caltrop, who in addition to writing poetry had lately been learning some
calligraphy, the opportunity of exercising her new skill proved irresistible and she
jumped up and insisted on doing the writing. After thinking for a bit, the com?pany
managed to produce some ten or more names of drink?ing games which Tan-chun
dictated one by one to Caltrop to write down on the slips. The slips were then folded
up small, doubled over, and thrown into a jar. Tan-chun asked Patience to draw. She
did so with a pair of chopsticks, stirring the slips around with them before fishing one
out for her inspection. Tan-chun unrolled it and read it out.
‘Cover-ups.’
‘Cover-ups?’ said Bao-chai, laughing. ‘Why, that’s the grandfather of them all! They
played “cover-ups” in ancient times. Admittedly, we don’t know exactly how they
played it then and our modern “cover-ups” is a comparatively recent invention; but
it’s still very, very difficult. I should think at least half the people here wouldn’t know
how to play it. We’d much better set that one aside and pick something a little less
literary that everyone can understand.’
‘We can’t set it aside now that it’s been drawn,’ said Tan?-chun. ‘I suggest that we
draw again, and if it’s the sort of game that everyone can enjoy, those who want to
can play that game while the rest of us are playing cover-ups.’
This time she got Aroma to draw. The name on the slip she picked out was
‘guess-fingers’. Xiang-yun greeted it with approval.
‘Now there’s a nice, simple, lively game! There’s a game that suits me down to the
ground! None of your stuffy old cover-ups for me! The very thought of it gives me a
headache! I’m for guess-fingers!’
‘Isn’t it just like her to reduce the entire party to anarchy before we have even
begun!’ said Tan-chun. ‘Cousin Chai, you must sconce her for me.’
Bao-chai forthwith obliged by forcing a whole cupful of wine down Xiang-yun’s
throat.
‘Now,’. said Tan-chun, herself gulping down a little wine, ‘I’m your M.C. I take it you
don’t need me to read the rules out. You just have to do as I tell you. We’ll get
someone to fetch dice and a cup and each of us will throw in turn, beginning with
Cousin Qin. Anyone who throws the same number as someone else will pair with
that person for cover-ups.’
Bao-qin threw a three. The others on the top table each threw a different number.
Caltrop on the second table was the first to throw another three.
‘We’d better confine ourselves to objects inside this room, don’t you think?’
Bao-qin suggested. ‘Otherwise the range of possibilities will be too large.’
‘Certainly,’ said Tan-chun. ‘And whoever hasn’t given the right answer after three
guesses must drink a cup of wine as a penalty. You begin.’
Bao-qin thought for a bit.
‘Market.’
Caltrop, who was new to this game, could see nothing in the room which could
combine with ‘market’ to make a quota?tion; but Xiang-yun, whose eyes had been
darting busily around from the moment the clue was announced, happened
suddenly to catch sight of the inscription that hung up over the door:
PEONY GARDEN
She guessed at once that Bao-qin must be thinking of the passage in the thirteenth
book of the Analects where Confucius tells a person who wanted to study
horticulture that he would ‘much better go to some old fellow who kept a market
garden and learn about it from him’. As Caltrop could still not guess what the
‘market’ indicated and the others were beginning to drum her for an answer,
Xiang-yun, who had already thought of a matching quotation from a line in one of
Wang Wei’s poems
Sometimes I to my herb garden repair
leaned over and whispered to Caltrop to give ‘herb’ as her reply. But Dai-yu had
spotted her and was quick to tell the others.
‘You’ll have to sconce her again. She’s been telling her how to answer.’
Xiang-yun was obliged to down another cupful of wine. She was so vexed that she
rapped Dai-yu on the knuckles with a chopstick. Caltrop, too had to drink a sconce.
The next pairing occurred when Bao-chai threw the same number as Tan-chun.
Tan-chun’s clue was ‘man’.
‘Isn’t that a bit wide?’ said Bao-chai.
‘All right,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I’ll give you another clue. That should narrow it down a
bit. “Shut”.’
Bao-chai thought for some moments. There was certainly plenty of chicken-meat on
the table. Tan-chun must be referring to ‘cock-man’ from Wang Wei’s
The red-capped cock-man has proclaimed the dawn
and ‘cock-shut’ from Luo Yin’s
At cock-shut still upon my book to pore.
She therefore countered with ‘niche’, basing herself on a line from the sixty-third
poem in the Poetry Classic:
The cock roosts in his niche.
The two girls smiled at each other and each took a sip of wine in celebration of a
successful turn.
      Xiang-yun, unwilling to wait longer, was already in the midst of a game of
guess-fingers with Bao-yu. The two of them were both shouting at the tops of their
voices. At the other side of the room You-shi and Faithful were also shouting at each
other ‘Five-a, five-a!’ ‘Seven-a, seven-a!’ ‘Eight-a, eight-a!’ from their separate tables,
while Patience and Aroma, sitting at adjacent ends of the same two tables, made up
another pair and contributed to the noise. To the racket made by their shouting was
added, in the case of the five female players, the clashing of bracelets every time
they gestured. Soon Xiang-?yun had beaten Bao-yu and Aroma had beaten Patience.
It was agreed that the losers should drink a cup of wine each and do something
before and something after drinking it: the question was, what? Xiang-yun had plenty
of suggestions for Bac-yu.
‘Before drinking you must give a well-known quotation in prose, a well-known
quotation in verse, a dominoes three?some, a song-title, and the day’s forecast from
an almanac, all five to hang together so that they make continuous sense. After
drinking you must give the name of some food you see here on the table which can
be used in more than one sense.’
The others laughed.
‘No one but her could think up such a rigmarole,’ they said. ‘Still, it should be
interesting.’
They began urging Bao-yu to start.
‘Have a heart!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I need a bit of time to think if I’m to get through that
lot.’
‘Drink the wine,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll do the rest for you.’
Bao-yu drank his cup obediently and listened.
‘One. “Scudding clouds race the startled mallard across the water”,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Two. “A wild goose passes, lamenting, across the wind-swept sky.” Three. It must be
“The wild goose with a broken wing”. Four. So sad a sound makes “The Heart
Tormented”. Five. “The cry of the wild goose is heard in the land.”’
The others laughed:
‘It certainly makes good sense!’
    Dai-yu picked up a hazel-nut.
‘This cob I take up from the table
Came from a tree, not from a stable.’

The other losers, Faithful and Aroma, were let off more lightly, being required to
produce only a single well-known saying which had some bearing on birthdays. In the
interest of economy their answers are omitted from this narrative.
A brief interlude of confusion followed while the next round of pairings was being
decided. It was resolved that Xiang-yun should play Bao-qin now at guess-fingers and
Li Wan, who had just thrown the same number as Xiu-yan, should play Xiu-yan at
cover-ups. Li Wan was to begin.
‘Gourd,’ said Li Wan.
   ‘Green,’ said Xiu-yan.
‘Green’ was evidently correct, since Li Wan appeared to be satisfied and the two
young women simultaneously sipped their wine.
Meanwhile Xiang-yun had lost to Bao-qin at guess-fingers and was asking what she
should do for a forfeit.
‘You know what Lai Jun-chen said when he showed Zhou Xing the fiery furnace that
Zhou Xing himself had designed,’ said Bao-qin: ‘“Please step inside!” I think that’s
what I should say to you now. Why don’t you do the forfeit that you designed for
Bao-yu?’

The others apart from Xiang-yun appreciated the aptness of the historical allusion.
Xiang-yun began answering without delay.
‘One. “A swift-rushing swirl and shock”. Two. “The sky rocks and heaves in the
river’s swelling waters”. Three. Better have “The lone boat tied with an iron chain”.
Four. And since there is a “Storm on the River”. Five. “This will be a bad day for
travelling.”’
By the time she had finished, the rest of the company were all laughing.
‘That sounded a bit contrived!’ they said. ‘She must have thought the forfeit up for
the express purpose of getting in her joke. - Come on!’ they said to Xiang-yun. ‘Let’s
have the second half.’
From the dish in front of her Xiang-yun picked out a duck’s head with her chopsticks
and pointed it at the maids who were sitting round the fourth table at the other end
of the room.
‘This little duck can’t with those little ducks compare:
This one is quite bald, but they all have a fine head of hair.’
There was even more laughter at this, but the maids pretended to take offence and
Skybright and Periwinkle came over to her table to protest.
‘It’s all very well for Miss Yun to have her joke, but she ought to leave us out of it.
You ought to make her drink another sconce now, as a punishment. And while she’s
about it, she might give us a nice bottle of hair-oil each by way of compensation.’
I dare say she would be glad to,’ said Dai-yu drily. ‘The trouble is that if she starts
giving bottles of hair-oil away, she will probably find herself on the carpet for stealing
them.’
The remark passed unnoticed, with two exceptions. The exceptions were Bao-yu,
who, assuming that it must refer to his supposed theft of the Essence of Roses, held
his head down and said nothing, and Sunset, the real thief, whose face turned red
with embarrassment. Bao-chai stared at Dai-yu reprovingly, whereupon Dai-yu, who
had intended no more than a mild joke at Bao-yu’s expense, realized too late that
Sunset must inevitably have construed it as a spiteful reminder of her guilt. She
attempted to distract attention from it by applying herself, with somewhat unnatural
vigour, to the game of guess-fingers.
The next pairing to be determined by the dice was that of Bao-chai and Bao-yu. The
clue Bao-chai gave Bao-yu for her cover-up was ‘precious’. After puzzling over it for
some moments, Bao-yu felt sure that it was a leg-pull. His own name meant ‘Precious
Jade’. No doubt the object she had in mind was the jade he always wore round his
neck and she was using his own name for her clue. Very well, he would answer her in
kind.
‘I take it that you are making free with my name,’ he said. ‘I hope that you won’t be
offended then if I make just as free with yours. “Bao-chai” means “Precious Hairpin”,
so I shall borrow your “hairpin” for my answer. “Jade hairpin” comes in a line by
some Tang poet:
The candle burnt out and the jade hairpin broken.
It is “jade”, isn’t it, in your cover-up?’
‘I protest,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘“Precious jade” isn’t a quota?tion. You’re supposed to
use only quotations in this game. We ought to sconce them both.’
“‘Precious jade” does come from a quotation,’ said Caltrop.
‘Surely not?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I’m prepared to admit you might find it on a New Year
scroll or something of that sort, but not in any work of literature, surely?’
‘I came across “precious jade” only the other day in a poem by Cen Shen,’ said
Caltrop:
‘Since in that land much precious jade is found.
I’m surprised you don’t remember it. And not long after?wards I came across
“precious hairpin” in a poem too- a poem by Li Shang-yin:
The precious hairpin gathers dust.
I remember being very much amused at the time to think that Master Bao’s and Miss
Bao’s names are both to be found in poems of the Tang dynasty.’
‘So much for your objection!’ said the others to Xiang-yun, laughing. ‘It’s you who
must drink the sconce.’
It was useless to argue: Xiang-yun had to drink another cupful.
The whole company now paired off for guess-fingers. With Grandmother Jia and Lady
Wang away, the girls felt free to make as much noise as they liked. Coloured sleeves
flashed, bracelets jangled, earrings shook, hair ornaments nodded in time to the
shrieked-out numbers. In such a bedlam almost anything would have passed
unnoticed; and it was only when they had tired of playing and broken off for a rest
that they suddenly became aware that Xiang-yun was no longer with them. At first
they assumed that she must have slipped out to answer a call of nature; but when,
after they had waited for quite some time, she had still not reappeared, they sent
some of the maids out to look for her. The search proved fruitless. Xiang-yun had
vanished without a trace.
At this point Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife arrived, accompanied by several of the old women
under her command. She had come partly out of a genuine desire to be useful but
much more because she regarded the maids as young and giddy creatures who
would take advantage of Lady Wang’s absence to play their young mistresses up by
drinking more than was good for them and behaving riotously. Tan-chun was fully
aware of this and let her know that she was.
‘I see you still don’t trust us, Mrs Lin. I assure you, though, that we haven’t been
drinking very much. We’re only enjoying ourselves: the wine has been a very small
part of it. You really have no cause to be worried.’
Li Wan and You-shi added their reassurances.
‘Go and rest, Lin. We wouldn’t let them drink too much, I promise you.’
The women laughed.
‘I know you wouldn’t,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife. ‘Even when Her Old Ladyship
encourages them to, the young ladies don’t drink very much, so I know they’d be
even less inclined to overdo it when Their Ladyships are away. It wasn’t because of
that I came; it was just that I thought there might be something you needed me for.
Also, as it’s a long way yet to dinner-time and you’ve been at it quite a long while
now, I thought it was time you had a bite of something. I know you don’t normally go
in much for snacks between meals, but when you’ve been drinking, you really need
to get a bit of food inside you so that it does you no harm.’
‘You are quite right,’ said Tan-chun. ‘In fact, we were just thinking of having
something when you came.’
She turned to the maids behind her and told them to fetch some light refreshments
from the kitchen. There was an answering cry from all sides and a few of them went
off to do her bidding.
Tan-chun smiled courteously at the women.
‘Do please go and rest now. Or perhaps you would like to go and keep Mrs Xue
company? We’ll send some wine there presently for you to drink.’
‘Oh no, miss, we wouldn’t presume!’
She and the women stood talking a little longer before finally taking themselves off.
Patience put her hand to her cheek and laughed.
‘My face is so hot, it must be terribly red. I wish they hadn’t seen me like this. I
think we ought to stop now. If we give them an excuse for coming back again it will
be really em?barrassing.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Tan-chun. ‘As long as we don’t do any serious drinking, it’s
perfectly all right.’
‘Come and look, everyone!’ - They were interrupted by a giggling young maid -
‘Miss Yun must have been feeling drunk and gone out for some air. She’s lying on the
granite bench behind the rockery, fast asleep.’
‘Let’s be quiet and not waken her,’ the others said amidst laughter, and followed
her outside to have a look.
They found Xiang-yun where the maid had said, on a large stone bench in a hidden
corner of the rockery, dead to the world. She was covered all over from head to foot
with crimson petals from the peony bushes which grew round about; the fan which
had slipped from her hand and lay on the ground beside her was half buried in petals;
and heaped-up peony petals wrapped in a white silk handkerchief made an
improvised pillow for her head. Over and around this petalled monstro?sity a
convocation of bees and butterflies was hovering distrac?tedly. It was a sight that the
cousins found both touching and comical. They made haste to rouse her and lifted
her up into a half-sitting position on the bench. But Xiang-yun was still playing
drinking games in her sleep and proceeded to recite the words of an imaginary forfeit,
though her eyes were tightly closed.
‘One. “The spring water being sweet, the wine is good.” Two. “Pour me its liquid
amber in a jade cup.” Three. We’ll drink till we see “The moon above the plum-tree
bough”. Four. Then, as we’re “Rolling Home”. Five. It will be “A good time to meet a
friend.”’
They shook her, laughing.
‘Wake up! Wake up! Come and have something to eat. Lying on the damp stone like
this you’ll make yourself ill.’
Xiang-yun...
uplifted slowly then those orbs serene
and saw the faces of the cousins bending over her. Then she looked downwards and
saw her own body and the place where she had been lying. She could remember
escaping from the noise to rest for a few moments somewhere where it was cool and
quiet. Evidently the wine from all those sconces she had been made to drink must
have got the better of her and caused her to drop off. Ashamed to have been
discovered in such a predicament, she struggled hastily to her feet and accompanied
the others back to the summerhouse, where she rinsed her mouth out with water
and drank two very strong cups of tea. Tan-chun made one of the girls fetch a piece
of ‘hangover rock’ for her to suck. By the time she had sucked the rock for a bit and
taken a few mouthfuls of hot, sour soup, she was feeling almost herself again.
A selection was now made of the various comestibles on the tables and sent over to
Xi-feng, who reciprocated by sending them some delicacies of her own. Bao-yu and
the girls then took some sustenance themselves, after which they broke up into little
groups, standing or sitting where they pleased and amusing themselves as the fancy
took them. Some went out?side to admire the peonies or to lean on the balustrade
at the edge of the lake and look at the fish swimming in the water below. Tan-chun
and Bao-qin stayed indoors to play Go. Bao-chai and Xiang-yun stayed indoors to
watch them. Dai-yu and Bao-yu went outside and, having found themselves a little
flowering arbour that they could stand and talk in, appeared to be completely
engrossed in their conversation.
While everyone was thus engaged, Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and her party appeared once
more, bringing with them a tearful, woebegone woman, who, as they reached the
steps that led up to the summer-house, threw herself down on her knees, not daring
to go further, and began knocking her head upon the ground. Meanwhile Tan-chun
continued to stare concentratedly at the Go-board, one outstretched hand feeling for
the spare pieces in the box while she contemplated her next move. One of her pieces
had been threatened, and though she could see how to get the two ‘eyes’ easily
enough, she could not, however hard she tried, think of a way of doing so which did
not break the development she had planned. It was some minutes before she looked
up and, in turning to ask for some tea, caught sight of Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, who had all
this time been standing there beside her, and asked her what she had come for.
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife pointed to the kneeling woman.
‘This is the mother of Miss Xi-chun’s maid, Landscape. She works in the Garden.
She’s been using some very bad language. I heard her just now and asked her what
she meant by it, but what she said to me, miss - well, I wouldn’t like to soil your ears
by repeating it. I think she ought to be dismissed.’
‘Why didn’t you see Mrs Zhu about this?’ said Tan-chun.
‘I did, miss. I ran into her just now on her way to the jobs room to join Mrs Xue. She
said I was to tell you.’
‘Shouldn’t you tell Mrs Lian?’
‘No need,’ said Patience. ‘I can tell her about it when I get back.’
Tan-chun nodded.
‘All right, dismiss her then. We’ll tell Lady Wang about it when she comes back and
get her to confirm it.’
She turned once more to her game. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and her party moved off,
taking the offender with them.
All of this scene was clearly observed by Bao-yu and Dai-yu from their flowering
covert, though they were too far away to hear what was said.
‘What a curiously detached person your sister is!’ said Dai-yu. ‘She has been
actually invited to take charge of things, yet she still won’t go a step beyond what is
absolutely neces?sary. Most people in her position would have been throwing their
weight about long ago.’
‘Ah, you don’t know what’s been going on while you were away,’ said Bao-yu.
‘While you were ill in bed, she did in fact do a great deal of managing. For example,
she divided this Garden into sections and put each section under someone’s
supervision. Nowadays you can’t even pick a flower in it without permission. And she
cut down on a lot of things too- mostly things that Feng or I had asked for, as an
awful example to the others. Oh no, Tan has got very strong views on domes?tic
economy. I certainly wouldn’t call her “detached”.’
‘I’m very glad to hear it,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We are all much too extravagant. Although
the management of the household is not my business, I have frequently, just out of
curiosity, made a few calculations, and I can see that our expenditure is vastly in
excess of our income. If we go on in this way without economizing, the time will
surely come when our credit is ex?hausted.’
‘Even if it does,’ said Bao-yu gaily, ‘I don’t suppose you and I will have to go short.’
Dai-yu turned away from him somewhat impatiently and began walking towards the
summerhouse, intending to seek Bao-chai’s company inside. Bao-yu would have gone
too, but just at that moment Aroma came up carrying a little varnished wooden ‘tea
for two’ tray, in each of whose rounds nestled a cup of freshly made tea.
‘Well, where’s she gone?’ said Aroma. ‘I brought this out specially, because I could
see the two of you standing here all this time without anything to drink; but now
she’s not here.’
‘That’s her, over there,’ said Bao-yu, removing one of the cups for himself. ‘You can
take it to her inside.’
Aroma did so, but by the time she had reached her, Dai-yu was already standing
talking to Bao-chai.
‘Here you are,’ said Aroma, ‘whichever of you is the thirst?ier had better take this
while I go and fetch another.’
‘I’m not thirsty,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I only want enough to wash out my mouth with.’
She lifted the cup to her lips, drank a mouthful of tea from it, and handed the
remainder to Dai-yu.
‘Let me get you another cup,’ said Aroma.
‘Oh, you know me,’ said Dai-yu smilingly. ‘I can’t drink much tea because of my
illness. The doctor says it’s bad for me. This half cup will be quite enough for me.
Thank you very much, though. It’s very kind of you.’
Having drained the cup, she put it back on the tray, where?upon Aroma went off to
collect the other cup from Bao-yu.
‘Where’s Parfumée?’ Bao-yu asked her when she got back to him. ‘I haven’t seen
her for a long time.’
Aroma looked around.
‘She was here a moment ago. I saw her playing match-my?-flower with some of the
others. Now she seems to have dis?appeared.’
Bao-yu hurried back to his room to look for her. He found her asleep on the bed with
her face turned inwards to the wall.
‘Come on, you mustn’t sleep!’ he said. ‘Come out and get some exercise. We’ll be
eating soon. You want to get an appetite for your food.’
‘Why shouldn’t I sleep?’ said Parfumée. ‘There’s nothing else for me to do. I got so
bored when you all went off drinking and left me on my own.’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘We’ll be having a party of our own here in the evening,’ he said, pulling her to her
feet. ‘I’ll ask Aroma to let you sit at table with the rest of us, shall I?’
‘Not on my own,’ said Parfumée. ‘I shouldn’t enjoy it unless Nénuphar and étamine
could be with me as well. Besides, I don’t like noodles. I didn’t have a proper lunch
today because I couldn’t eat the noodles. I got so hungry that just now I asked Liu to
do a bowl of soup and some rice for me to eat here now; so I shan’t want anything
again tonight. I could just drink, I suppose; but if you want me to, you’ll have to let
me drink as much as I like and not let the others fuss over me. When I was still at
home I used to drink two or three catties of rice wine at a sitting, but once I started
learning beastly opera, they wouldn’t let me drink any more in case it spoiled my
voice. During this last year or two I haven’t had so much as a smell of it. Tonight I
should like to celebrate the end of all that.’
‘So you shall,’ said Bao-yu.
At that point a woman arrived from Cook Liu with a food-box containing Parfumée’s
order. Swallow relieved her of it and brought it inside. It contained a bowl of
shrimp-balls in chicken-skin soup, a bowl of duck steamed in wine, a plate of red
salted goose-slices, another plate on which were four cream-cheese rolls stuffed with
pine-kernels, and a large bowl of delicious, steaming-hot, fragrant green rice.
Swallow put these all on the table in front of Parfumée and fetched her a spoon,
chopsticks and some bowls, one of which she filled for her with the fragrant rice.
‘Ugh!’ said Parfumée. ‘How can I eat this horrible greasy stuff?’
She spooned some of the soup onto her rice and picked up a couple of goose-slices
with her chopsticks to put on top of it. The rest she left untouched. Bao-yu sniffed
the rejected dishes. They smelt delicious - much nicer than the things he generally
had to eat. He helped himself to one of the pine-kernel rolls and told Swallow to fill
him another bowl with some rice and pour on some of the soup. The combination
-soup, rice, and pine-roll - was quite delectable. Parfumée and Swallow both laughed
as they watched him eat.
When he and Parfumée had both finished, Swallow would have sent the remainder
back to the kitchen, but Bao-yu told her that she should eat it herself.
‘If it’s not enough, we’ll ask them to bring you some more.’
‘No, no, this will be plenty,’ said Swallow. ‘It’s not long since Musk brought me
some cakes and things from the party. If I eat this now, I shall have had quite enough.’
She proceeded to tuck in there and then, standing where she was beside the table.
Soon all had been demolished except for two pine-kernel rolls.
‘I’ll save these for my Ma,’ she said. ‘Oh, and if you’re drinking this evening, will you
let me have a drop too?’
‘Are you another drinker then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Good! We’ll have a real celebration
tonight. Aroma and Skybright are both fond of drinking, but they won’t take much as
a rule because they feel it isn’t quite proper. Tonight my birthday shall be the excuse
for everyone to let themselves go! By the way, there’s something I’ve been meaning
to ask you for some time but keep forgetting. Would you make yourself responsible
for Parfumée in future? Just keep an eye on her and see that she doesn’t get up to
mischief. Aroma would like to if she could, but she has her hands full already.’
‘I can look after Parfumée, don’t worry about that,’ said Swallow. ‘What I want to
know is, what are you going to do about Fivey?’
‘You can tell Mrs Liu that Fivey definitely will be coming to work here. After I’ve had
a word with the others, she can move in as soon as she likes.’
‘Now you’re talking!’ said Swallow. She called the two little maids in to wait on him
while he washed his hands and pour out tea for him while she herself got the dirty
things together and handed them to the woman outside. After that she washed her
own hands and went off to tell Cook Liu the good news. But that is no part of our
story.
Bao-yu left to rejoin the others as soon as he was ready, and Parfumée, holding a silk
handkerchief in one hand and a fan in the other, trailed along behind him. As he
came out of the courtyard gate he saw Aroma and Skybright walking hand in hand
towards him and asked them what they had come for.
‘You!’ they said. ‘Dinner’s been laid now and the others are waiting for you to
begin.’
Bao-yu explained that he had just eaten.
Aroma laughed:
‘You’re like a cat: always eating except when you ought to be. You’d better come
and sit with them all the same, for appearance’s sake.’
Skybright poked Parfumee playfully on the forehead with her finger.
‘You’re getting to be quite a little man-eater, aren’t you? Going back to have some
food, indeed! You’d arranged to meet him there, more like. Why didn’t you tell
anyone else that you were going?’
Aroma laughed.
‘Oh nonsense, Skybright! Of course she didn’t arrange to meet him. It was a pure
accident, their being there at the same time together.’
‘All right,’ said Skybright, ‘but what does he need us for then? Why don’t we all go
away and leave Parfumee to look after him on her own?’
‘He may not need the rest of us,’ said Aroma, ‘but he certainly couldn’t do without
you.’
‘On the contrary,’ said Skybright. ‘I’m the one person he could do without. I’m lazy,
I’m clumsy, I’m bad-tempered -in short, I’m just no good for the job.’
‘If he burns another hole in his peacock gold snow-cape, who’s going to mend it for
him if you aren’t there?’ said Aroma mischievously. ‘Yes, my girl: all the excuses I
used to hear from you in the past when I tried to get you to do something for me.
You were no good at sewing, oh no! You didn’t even know how to hold a needle! And
it isn’t as if it was my own sewing I’ve asked you about: it’s only ever been his things
that I’ve asked you to help me with. No, you wouldn’t touch them. Yet I only have to
be out of the house for a few days and there you are, sitting up all night sewing for
him, even though you are half dead with the flu! What can the explanation of that be,
I wonder? No, come on: I want to hear your answer.’
But Skybright only ‘pshaw’-ed and went on smiling.
They had been.walking back to the summerhouse through?out these exchanges and
were now re-entering it. Aunt Xue had come back again for the meal, so they
reseated themselves in order of seniority with Aunt Xue at the head. Bao-yu poured a
little tea onto some rice and merely pretended to share the meal with them. When
they had finished eating, they sat talking over their tea or playing games.
Outside, meanwhile, Periwinkle, Caltrop, Parfumée, étamine, Nénuphar and
Cardamome, having been all over the Garden collecting flowers, sat down, with their
laps full of them, in a little semicircle of lawn enclosed by high banks of flowering
shrubbery and began playing ‘match-my-flower’.
‘I’ve got some Guanyin willow,’ said one.
‘I’ve got some Lohan pine,’ said another.
‘I’ve got gentleman’s bamboo.’
‘I’ve got lady’s plantain.’
‘I’ve got green starwort.’
‘I’ve got red moon-flower.’
‘I’ve got a peony from The Peony Pavilion..’
‘I’ve got a lute-flower from The Story of the Lute.’
‘I’ve got “brothers and sisters”,’ said Cardamome.
‘I’ve got “husbands and wives”,’ said Caltrop.
‘There’s no such flower,’ said Cardamome.
‘Yes there is,’ said Caltrop. ‘There are two main kinds of orchid, the spring orchid,
which has only one flower on each stem, and the summer orchid, which has several;
but there’s more than one kind of summer orchid. There’s the kind that you’ve got,
which has the flowers growing one above the other on the stem: that’s called
“brothers and sisters”; and there’s another kind like mine here, which has two
flowers growing side by side at the top: that’s called a “husband and wife” orchid.’
Cardamome rose to her feet. Unable to counter with botani?cal arguments, she
resorted to jeering instead.
‘And I suppose it’s a “father and son” orchid if one flower’s bigger than the other
and an “enemies” orchid if they’re growing back to back! It’s because your own
husband’s been away so long: you can’t even look at an orchid now with?out thinking
of him. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, dragging him into it like this!’
Caltrop laughed, though her face had turned bright red.
‘You horrible little creature! What rubbish you talk!’
She had begun getting up, intending to give Cardamome’s mouth a good pinch; but
before she could do so, Cardamome had thrown herself upon her, forcing her
backwards and pinning her to the ground, while at the same time she looked round
and called to the other girls to help her.
‘étamine! Nénuphar! Come and pinch her mouth for me!’
Caltrop struggled to get free and the two of them rolled over and over on the ground.
The others laughed and clapped their hands.
‘Careful! Mind the puddle!’ they shouted. ‘Mind she doesn’t spoil her skirt!’
Cardamome looked round and saw that they had rolled towards a hollow in which
rain-water had collected and that Caltrop’s skirt was half in it. Feeling somewhat
scared, she let go of Caltrop, jumped up, and ran away. The others thought Caltrop’s
plight a great joke, but fearing that, with Cardamome gone, she might vent her anger
upon them, they ran off also, amidst peals of laughter.
Caltrop got up and inspected her skirt. It was completely soaked, and the foul,
stagnant water was dripping off it in half-a-dozen places. She was still exclaiming
bitterly over it when Bao-yu appeared. Observing that the girls were playing
match-my-flower, he had gone off to collect some flowers himself and had now come
back to join them. Surprised to find the other girls all gone and Caltrop standing on
her own there contemplating her skirt, he asked her what had happened to the
game.
‘I had a “husbands and wives” flower,’ said Caltrop, ‘but the others had never heard
of it and said I’d made it up; so there was a quarrel and they spoilt my nice new skirt.’
Bao-yu seemed pleased.
‘I can match your “husbands and wives”,’ he said, taking a purple skullcap from his
bunch. ‘Look, here’s a “two heads are better than one”.’ He picked up Caltrop’s orchid
and laid it beside the purple skullcap.
‘Bother your “ two heads are better than one”!’ said Caltrop, ‘and bother my
“husbands and wives”! Look at my skirt!’
Bao-yu bent down and examined it.
‘Aiya! How did you manage to do that? It’s grenadine, isn’t it, that red material?
They call it that because it’s the red of pomegranate-flowers. I’m afraid it’s a material
that stains very badly. What a pity!’
‘It was material that Miss Bao-qin brought with her from Nanking,’ said Caltrop.
‘Miss Bao-chai and I each made ourselves a skirt out of it. This is the first time I’ve
put mine on.’
Bao-yu stamped and sighed sympathetically.
‘I’m sure the Xues could afford to spoil a hundred skirts like this one every day,’ he
said; ‘but that’s not the point. In the first place, if this is material that Bao-qin gave
you, it’s going to look rather bad if your skirt’s worn out before Bao?- chai’s has even
been worn. And in the second place, Aunt Xue is a bit inclined to nag - I’ve often
heard her complain?ing that you are extravagant and a bad manager and don’t know
how to look after things properly and so forth - and though this may not be your fault,
I’m afraid if she gets to see it, you are going to have rather a lot of that sort of thing
to listen to.’
What Bao-yu had just said so exactly accorded with what Caltrop herself had been
thinking, that she began, in spite of everything, to feel almost pleased.
‘I know. If only I’d got another skirt like this one, I could change into it straight away
and she wouldn’t notice. But the trouble is, though I’ve got several new skirts, they
all look quite different.’
‘Stop moving!’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you don’t keep still, you’ll get the dirty water on your
trousers and pantaloons and the tops of your shoes. I’ve got an idea. Last month
Aroma made herself a skirt which is practically identical with this one, but she won’t
be able to wear it for a while yet because she’s still in mourning for her mother. Why
don’t we get her to send it over for you to change into?’
Caltrop smiled gratefully but shook her head.
‘No, I can’t do that. I’m sure they wouldn’t like it if they found out.’
‘They won’t mind,’ said Bao-yu. ‘As soon as her mourning’s over you can ask her
what she’d like to have in return and I’m sure they’d be only too pleased to let you
give it to her. Come now, it’s not like you to be so coy! It’s not as if you’ll be doing
anything deceitful. You can tell Bao-chai about it. All we shall be doing is making sure
that my aunt doesn’t get to hear of it, because we know it would only make her
angry.’
Caltrop thought for a bit. What he said seemed reasonable. She smiled and nodded.
‘All right- since you are so kind. I’ll wait for you here, then. Only please, I beg of you,
ask her to bring it here herself.’
Bao-yu agreed, delighted that she had accepted, and hurried back to find Aroma,
head low and eyes to the ground, think?ing about Caltrop all the way.
‘What a pity - nice girl like that - hasn’t any parents -doesn’t even remember her
own name - kidnapped when she was a child - and to be sold to a brute like Pan!’
But not all his thoughts about her were so melancholy.
‘What a delightful surprise, though, to be able to do this for her! - That time with
Patience was a surprise, too. But this! - never, never would have expected it!’
Still engrossed in these thoughts, he regained his room. There, going up to Aroma, he
took her impulsively by the hand and told her what he had come for.
Everyone loved Caltrop. There was something endearing about her that one could
not help responding to. Aroma was no exception and was in any case somewhat
given to acts of impulsive generosity. As soon as Bao-yu told her what had happened,
she opened her clothes-chest, and getting the scarlet skirt out, folded it up carefully
and hurried off after him to look for her.
They found her still standing patiently on the spot where Bao-yu had left her. Aroma
pretended to scold.
‘You’re too wild, Caltrop. It always ends in trouble.’
   Caltrop coloured.
‘Oh, thank you, Aroma. It’s those horrible little beasts I was playing with. I didn’t
realize they could be so nasty.’
She unfolded the skirt that Aroma had brought her. It was, as Bao-yu had said, exactly
like the one she was wearing. She made him turn his back and look away while she
crossed her arms and inserted her hands under her dress in order to undo the
fastenings of the dirty skirt. Having carefully removed it, she wrapped herself in the
clean one and did up the sides.
‘Let me take that dirty one,’ said Aroma. ‘I’ll send it back to you later when I’ve
cleaned it up a bit. If they were to see you going back with it, they’d be sure to ask
questions.’
‘Yes, you take it,’ said Caltrop. ‘But my dear Aroma, I don’t want it back if I’ve got
this one of yours to wear. Give it to one of the younger maids. I don’t mind which one:
you can decide that for me.’
‘That’s very generous of you,’ said Aroma.
Caltrop bowed twice to her in formal expression of her thanks. Aroma then went off,
carrying the dirty skirt.
Looking round for Bao-yu, Caltrop found him still with his back towards her, squatting
down on the ground and just completing the burial of the ‘husband and wife’ orchid
and the purple skullcap. He had dug a little grave for them with a piece of stick, lined
it with fallen petals, laid the two flowers on the petals, covered them with more
petals, and was now smoothing earth over the top. Caltrop tugged at his arm,
laughing.
‘What on earth do you think you’re doing? I’ve heard people talking about the
creepy sort of things you get up to, but I only now realize what they mean. Look at
your hands! They’re absolutely filthy. You’d better go and wash them straight away.’
Bao-yu got up and began to go. Caltrop started walking off, too, in the opposite
direction. She had gone no more than a few steps, however, when she turned and
called to him to stop. Bao-yu, supposing that she had something more to say to him,
turned smilingly towards her, holding up his muddy bands.
‘What is it?’
But Caltrop merely stood there, smiling and saying nothing. Just then her little maid
Advent came up to tell her that Bao-qin wanted to talk to her. After that, finally, she
spoke.
‘You won’t ever tell your Cousin Pan about this, will you?’
‘What, put my head inside the mouth of a tiger?’ said Bao-?yu, laughing. ‘You must
think I’m crazy!’
He turned once more and went back to Green Delights.
What happened there will be related in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 63

Flower maidens combine for
nocturnal birthday revels
And a grass widow copes with funeral arrangements
single-handed



The first thing Bao-yu did when he got back to Green Delights was to wash his hands.
While doing so, he discussed with Aroma the drinking-party that they were planning
to have that evening.
‘I want everyone to enjoy themselves,’ he said. ‘I want you to let yourselves go for
once. Let’s decide now what we are going to eat, so that they have plenty of time to
get it ready.’
‘You don’t have to worry about that,’ said Aroma, smiling. ‘I’ve already made a
collection for tonight and given the money to Mrs Liu: ten pennyweights of silver
each from Skybright, Musk, Ripple and me - that’s two taels - and six each from
Parfumée, Emerald, Swallow and Number Four (I didn’t collect anything from the
ones who are taking the evening off) making three taels four pennyweights
altogether. With that money she’s going to do us forty little dishes of different things
to eat. I’ve also had a word with Patience about the drink and she’s had a two-gallon
jar of Shaoxing wine carried over for us. It’s hidden away over there, ready for the
evening. The party will be our birthday present to you from the eight of us.’
‘How did the younger ones manage to give so much?’ said Bao-yu, pleased but a
little concerned. ‘I think it would have been better if you hadn’t taken contributions
from them.’
‘What about us then?’ said Skybright. ‘We’re not exactly rich. This is something
they wanted to do for you. I think you ought to accept it in the spirit in which it was
offered and not bother too much about where the money came from. Suppose they
stole it: what does that matter to you?’
‘You’re right,’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
‘If you were to go for one single day without feeling the rough side of her tongue,’
said Aroma, ‘I think you would feel deprived!’
‘Aroma is getting quite expert in the art of stirring up trouble between other
people,’ said Skybright. ‘I wonder who she picked it up from.’
While the others were still laughing at these exchanges, Bao-yu gave orders for them
to close the courtyard gate.
‘I don’t wonder the young ladies call you “Busybody”,’ said Aroma. ‘If we shut the
gate now, we shall be simply inviting suspicion. Much better wait a bit.’
Bao-yu nodded.
‘I have to go outside now for a moment. Have some water ready when I get back,
will you, Number Four? Swallow, you can come with me.’
When they were outside and he had first made sure that no one else was about, he
asked Swallow what Cook Liu had said about Fivey.
‘Mrs Liu was very pleased when I told her,’ said Swallow, ‘but she said that because
of all the worry and the harsh treatment she suffered the other night Fivey has had a
relapse; so it’s out of the question for her to begin working with us now. She said it
will just have to wait until she’s better.’
Judging from the long sigh he gave when he heard this, Bao-yu appeared to be very
much distressed.
‘Tell me,’ he asked, ‘does Aroma know about this?’
‘I haven’t told her myself,’ said Swallow. ‘I suppose Parfumée might have done.’
‘Anyway, I haven’t told her yet,’ he said. ‘Hmn. Perhaps I’d better.’
Going back inside, he was careful to wash his hands to avert suspicion.
It was already lighting-up time. A party of women could be heard entering the
courtyard gate. The inmates of Green Delights crowded to the windows to peep out.
It was Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, accompanied by a number of the stewardesses. A woman
holding a big lantern in her hand was leading the way.
‘They’ve come to inspect the watch,’ said Skybright. ‘When they go out again we
shall be able to shut the gate.’
Sure enough, the women on night-duty at Green Delights now trooped out into the
courtyard to be inspected.
‘Now, no gambling and no drinking!’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, when she had
ascertained that they were all there. ‘And no lying down and going to sleep until
daylight, or I shall be after you!’
‘None of us is that stupid,’ said the women, laughing. ‘We wouldn’t dare.’
‘Is Master Bao in bed yet?’ Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife asked them.
The women said they didn’t know. Aroma gave Bao-yu a prod and he shuffled to the
doorway in his slippers and smiled amiably at the assembled matrons outside.
‘I haven’t gone to bed yet. Come inside and sit down.’ He turned to Aroma inside.
‘Aroma, some tea for Mrs Lin!’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife required no pressing.
‘Not in bed yet?’ she exclaimed, stepping nimbly into the room. ‘Now that the days
are so long, you need to go to bed early so that you can get up early in the morning.
If you get up late, people will laugh at you. “That’s no way for an educated,
well-brought-up young gentleman to behave,” they’ll say. “More like an ignorant,
uneducated coolie.”‘
The comparison seemed to please her, for she laughed very complacently after
making it. Bao-yu laughed too.
‘You’re quite right, Mrs Lin. As a matter of fact, I do go to bed early most nights.
Generally when you make your rounds I don’t know you’ve been here because I’m
already in bed when you come. The reason I’ve stayed up today is be?cause I’ve had
such a lot of noodles to eat. I was afraid that if I went to bed now I’d get indigestion.’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife transferred her smiling attention to Aroma.
‘You want to give him some good, strong Pu-er tea to drink.’
Aroma and Skybright answered her together.
‘We made him a big pot of herbal tea - wutong-tips. He’s already had two cupfuls of
it. It’s still quite fresh. Would you like to try some?’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife rose to receive the cup that Skybright poured for her.
‘I hear that Master Bao has taken to calling you senior girls by your names,’ she said.
‘Now that’s not very respectful. Though you work here, you are still Their Ladyships’
girls, don’t forget. I don’t say but what he mightn’t sometimes, just once in a while,
let one of your names drop out by accident, and no harm done. But if he makes a
habit of it, the other young gentlemen will soon be copying him, and we shall get
ourselves laughed at as a family in which the young folk have no respect for their
elders.’
‘You are quite right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But in fact it is only once in a while and quite
unintentionally.’
Aroma and Skybright hastened to corroborate this.
‘Oh yes, Mrs Lin. It would be quite unfair to say that he makes a habit of it.
Normally he is most respectful. It’s only once or twice in this apartment when we’ve
been joking together and never in front of other people.’
Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife was all smiles.
‘Well, that’s all right then. Respectable is what an educated young gentleman ought
to be. The more you respect others, I say, the more others will respect you. And I
don’t only mean older people who have served three or four generations of the
family, I mean anyone who comes to you from Their Ladyships. Even Their Ladyships’
cat and Their Ladyships’ dog is to be respected, if you want people to think of you as
an edu?cated, well-brought-up young gentleman.’
She finished her tea.
‘Well, good night young master, I must be going.’
‘Won’t you stay a little longer?’ said Bao-yu.
But Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife was already on her way and leading her troops off to inspect
another apartment. Skybright barred the gate after her as soon as she was gone. She
was laughing as she came in afterwards.
‘I think the old girl’s had a bit too much to drink. That’s why we were treated to the
lecture.’
‘She means well,’ said Musk. ‘We need someone to remind us once in a while, just
to keep us on the straight and narrow.’
She began laying the table while she said this; but Aroma stopped her.
‘Let’s not sit up at the big table. We can put the round pear-wood table on the kang.
It will be much more relaxed and comfortable on the kang.’
While other maids lifted the pear-wood table onto the kang, Musk and Number Four
went off to collect the dishes that Cook Liu had been preparing for them. Though
each carried the largest tea-tray she could find, it took four or five trips to carry them
all over. Meanwhile two old nannies squatted on the verandah outside, tending the
stove on which the wine was heating.
‘It’s so hot,’ Bao-yu said to the maids. ‘Let’s take our outer clothes off.’
‘You can take yours off if you like,’ said the girls, ‘but we want to drink a health with
you before we start, so we shall have to stay respectable a bit longer.’
‘If you’re going to begin that sort of nonsense, we shan’t get started until morning!’
said Bao-yu. ‘You know how I hate that kind of thing. It’s bad enough at parties
outside when I have to do it; but to make me do it here in my own room it’s as
though you were deliberately trying to annoy me.’
‘All right, all right!’ they said. ‘Anything you say!’
And so, before taking their places on the kang, they went off to remove their
hair-ornaments and make themselves more comfortable. They returned wearing only
tunics and trousers, with their unadorned hair loosely knotted or coiled. Bao-yu
himself was wearing a dark-red cotton tunic tied at the waist with a sash, and
trousers in a black-and-green-patterned lined silk gauze, unconfined at the ankles.
The girls found him already ensconced on the kang. He was leaning back, one elbow
resting on a newly-made turquoise-coloured pouffe stuffed with rose and peony
petals, playing guess-fingers with Parfumée. Parfumée was shouting excitedly as she
played. She was wearing a very short, close-fitting tunic with a harlequin pattern of
turquoise, deep purple and reddish-brown lozen?ges, a willow-green sash, and
flower-sprigged pale red trousers, which, like Bao-yu’s, were unconfined at the ankles.
Her hair was done up in a number of little plaits which had been drawn back to join
one great plait, as thick as a goose’s egg at the nape of her neck. She had a tiny jade
stud no bigger than a grain of rice in her right ear; from her left ear hung a pendant
made of ruby-glass and gold, the size of a ginkgo-fruit. Never had the moonlike pallor
of her face, the limpid brightness of her eyes shown to greater advantage.
‘Look at that now!’ said the maids admiringly. ‘Wouldn’t you take the two of them
for a pair of twins?’
‘Wait a bit,’ said Aroma, who had begun pouring wine. ‘You can play that later. Even
though you won’t let us drink healths with you, at least do us the honour of drinking
from our hands.’
She held her wine-cup to his lips and he took a sip from it. After that each of the
seven others came up to him in turn, holding their full cups out to him, and he took a
sip from each one. This little ceremony over, they proceeded to arrange themselves
round the table. As there was insufficient room for Swallow and Number Four on the
side nearest the edge of the kang, they brought a couple of felt-covered porcelain
‘tabouret’ stools up and sat at it on the floor below. The forty dishes, all of white
Ding-ware and each no larger than a tea-saucer, contained every conceivable kind of
sweet, savoury, fresh, dried, pickled, salted, smoked, baked, fried or sauteed delicacy
designed to assist the absorption of rice-wine by the human frame.
‘Let’s play a drinking game,’ said Bao-yu.
‘Yes, but let it be a nice, quiet game this time,’ said Aroma. ‘We don’t want too
much shouting, or people will hear us. Something not too learned, though. Don’t
forget that some of us here can’t read or write.’
‘Get out the dice and let’s play Fours then,’ said Musk.
‘No, that’s a boring game,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Let’s play Choos?ing the Flower.’
‘Oh yes, do let’s!’ said Skybright. ‘I’ve been wanting to play that for ages.’
‘It’s a good game,’ said Aroma, ‘but you really need more people playing it to make
it interesting.’
‘If you ask me, I think we should slip over and ask Miss Bao and Miss Yun and Miss
Lin to come and join us,’ said Swallow. ‘There’d be no harm in their staying here till
about ten o’clock, surely?’
‘But think of all the opening and closing of gates,’ said Aroma. And suppose you ran
into the watch and they started asking -’
‘It’ll be all right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Ask Miss Tan too; she’s fond of drinking. And if she’s
one of the party, they won’t be able to say anything even if they do find out. And
what about Miss Qin?’
‘No, not Miss Qin,’ said the girls. ‘She’s staying in Mrs Zhu’s room. Routing her out
from there would be simply asking for trouble.’
‘It’ll be all right,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you see. Just ask her.’
Swallow and Number Four needed no second bidding. Choosing a few of the junior
maids to go with them, they ordered the old women to open the gate for them and
set off, one in the direction of Dai-yu’s place and one in the direction of Bao-chai’s.
The senior maids, Aroma, Musk and Skybright, doubted whether, particularly in the
case of Dai-yu and Bao-chai, such insubstantial deputies would be successful and
decided that they had better go themselves and add their own weight to the
invitation. Ordering a couple of the older women with lanterns to accompany them,
they went off in the wake of the other two to see what they could achieve.
It was as they had suspected. Bao-chai ‘thought it was rather late’; Dai-yu ‘didn’t feel
quite up to it’. It was only when Aroma and Skybright had appealed to them by
pointing out that the maids were the hosts and would very much appreciate the
honour that they changed their minds and finally consented to come.
Swallow and Number Four had had no such difficulty with Tan-chun. She had seemed
delighted by the invitation, even suggesting that they should invite Li Wan as well
since it would be embarrassing if she were not invited and were to find out about the
party afterwards - and sending her own maid Ebony to help Swallow persuade Li Wan
that she and Bao-qin should come.
One by one the new guests started to arrive. Caltrop came, too, in addition to the
ones already mentioned. Refusing to take ‘no’ for an answer, Aroma had taken her
firmly by the hand and dragged her off forcibly from All-spice Court. To
accommodate the greater numbers, Aroma and the other girls put another table
alongside the one already on the kang and a row of chairs facing them on the floor
below. Bao-yu and the other guests arranged themselves on the kang, while the
seven maids and Parfumée, as hosts, sat on the row of chairs below, within reach of
one or other of the tables.
‘Cousin Lin can sit there, against the partition,’ said Bao-yu, while the guests were
still arranging themselves on the kang. ‘She’ll be better able to keep warm there.’
He made her a little nest of pillows there, into which, though it was somewhat
inconveniently distant from the table, she settled herself very comfortably. From this
cosy vantage-point she looked across at Li Wan, Bao-chai and Tan-chun with a teasing
smile.
‘You are always grumbling about the gambling and drinking of the servants, yet
here are we proposing to do precisely the same thing ourselves. How will you have
the face to tell them off for this sort of thing in future?’
‘This doesn’t count,’ said Li Wan, smiling back at her. ‘There’s all the difference in
the world between doing this once in a while on a birthday or a holiday and doing it
every night of one’s life.’
Skybright now produced a cylindrical bamboo box containing a set of ivory
drinking-cards, each with a different kind of flower painted on it. After giving it a
good shake, she put it down in the middle of one of the tables. Then she took four
dice, put them inside a dice-box, shook it, opened it, and looked inside. The pips on
the faces uppermost made a total of five. Counting herself as ‘one’, the fifth along in
an anti-clockwise direction was Bao-chai.
‘I draw first then,’ said Bao-chai, smiling. ‘I wonder what it will be.’
She gave the cylinder another shake and pulled out a card. The others craned over to
look. It had a picture of a peony on it with the caption ‘Empress of the Garden’ in
large red characters. This was followed by a line of smaller black characters from a
poem by the Tang poet Luo Yin:
Yourself lack passion, yet can others move.
On the other side of the picture were directions for the person drawing the card and
for the other drinkers:
All present are to drink a cup in your honour. Also,
because you have preeminence over all the other flowers,
you are entitled to ask anyone present to recite a poem
or tell a joke or sing a song for your entertainment.
     The others laughed delightedly.
     ‘The peony suits you perfectly. What a splendid choice!’
When they had all drunk the cupful, Bao-chai drank a little wine herself and said that
she would like Parfumée to sing her a song. Parfumée began:
‘The sumptuous birthday feast begins -’
‘Stop! Stop!’ said the others. ‘We don’t want birthday odes at this time of night.
Sing us something nice.’
Parfumée began again, this time putting all she had into the performance:
‘With my little phoenix-feather broom
I stand at heaven’s door
To sweep away the fallen flowers
That lie on heaven’s floor;
And when, by yonder cloud-bank,
The wind begins to rise,
It stirs the pearly dust up:
Round and round it flies.
O, sweeping heaven’s floor
Is like any earthly chore! ...’

Meanwhile Bao-yu, who had taken temporary possession of the card, continued to
turn it this way and that between his fingers, muttering to himself the line of verse
that was inscribed on it:
Yourself lack passion, yet can others move.
When Parfumée had finished, he gazed at her fixedly, saying nothing. Xiang-yun
snatched the card from him rather im?patiently and handed it back to Bao-chai.
Bao-chai threw the dice. Sixteen. This time the count went right round both tables,
ending at Tan-chun, who was sitting next to her.
‘I wonder what I shall be,’ said Tan-chun, and reached out to draw a card. But she
blushed when she had looked at it and threw it on the table with an embarrassed
laugh.
‘I don’t think we ought to play this game,’ she said. ‘It’s really a game for men to
play, outside. There are all sorts of objectionable things in the directions.’
The others were puzzled, until Aroma picked the card up and held it out for them to
see. The picture was of a spray of almond blossom with the caption ‘Spirit of the
Afterglow’. The line of verse which followed it was by Gao Chan:
Apricot-trees make the sun’s red-petalled floor.
Then came the part which had made Tan-chun feel embarrassed:
You are destined to make a noble marriage. Congratulations! Those present must
  offer you a cup of wine and drink a cup in your honour.
The reading of these words was greeted with general laughter.
‘So that’s what upset you? Well, it’s true there are a few like this which are amusing
at the expense of us girls, but there’s no real harm in them. Anyway, what’s wrong
with the prognostication? We’ve already got one royal consort in the family, why
shouldn’t we have another? Congratulations!’
They raised their cups and drank a toast to the marriage. Tan-chun herself refused to
drink, but Xiang-yun, Caltrop and Li Wan seized hold of her and forced the wine down
her throat. Even then she continued to insist that they ought to abandon the game
and play something else. Xiang-yun had to take hold of her hand, clamp her fingers to
the dice-box, and force her to throw the dice. The number thrown in this way was
nineteen. This time the count was more than the number of players and ended, the
second time round, at Li Wan. Li Wan shook the cylinder and drew out a card. She
smiled when she saw what she had got.
‘Very good! Look at this, all of you! This is rather a nice one.’
The picture was of a winter-flowering plum with the rubric ‘Beauty of the Snow’. The
verse that followed was by Wang Qi:
Content by cottage fence to bloom unseen.
The instructions given on this card were:
You are to drink a cup of wine. The next player after you is to throw the dice.
‘There, isn’t that nice!’ said Li Wan. ‘You have to throw the dice for me and I just sit
back enjoying myself and let the world go by!’
She sipped her wine and passed the dice-box to Dai-yu. The eighteen which Dai-yu
threw brought the count round to Xiang-yun.
‘Ha ha!’ said Xiang-yun, rolling up her sleeves. She stretched her arm out and drew
a card. The others looked at what she had drawn. It was a picture of crab-apple
blossom with the caption ‘Sweet Drunken Dreamer’. The quotation following was a
line from Su Dong-po:
Fear that the flowers at dead of night should sleep.
‘For “at dead of night” read “on a stone bench”,’ said Dai-yu.
The others laughed, remembering Xiang-yun’s inebriation earlier in the day; but
Xiang-yun smiled unconcernedly and pointed to the self-propelling toy boat on
Bao-yu’s shelf.
‘Just get on that boat and go home, will you? You have too much to say for yourself,
my girl!’
Amidst further laughter they looked at the instructions:
          In view of the sweet drunken dreaming you are not to drink anything
yourself,
but the players sitting to right and left of you are each to drink a cupful.
‘Holy name!’ said Xiang-yun, clapping her hands delight?edly. ‘What a kind,
thoughtful card!’
Xiang-yun’s neighbours, it so happened, were Dai-yu and Bao-yu. Others filled their
cups for them in readiness. Bao-yu drank half of his and gave the rest to Parfumee,
who threw her head back and emptied it at a gulp; Dai-yu, under cover of talking to
someone, emptied the whole of hers into a spittoon. Xiang-yun picked up the dice.
The total this time was nine, which meant that Musk was to draw. The card she drew
portrayed a rose under the caption ‘Summer’s Crowning Glory’. The black-letter verse
was another line from Wang Qi:
After sweet Rose there is no more blooming.
And the instructions:
All present drink three cups to commemorate the passing of the flowers.
      ‘What does it say?’ Musk asked.
Bao-yu frowned and quickly hid the card.
‘We are all to drink something,’ he said.
As a compromise they drank three sips each instead of the three cupfuls prescribed.
Musk threw nineteen with the dice, which made it Caltrop’s turn to draw. The flower
she drew was a purple skullcap with the caption ‘Three Springs’ Harbinger’. The line
of verse was by Zhu Shu-zhen:
Even as the twy-stemmed blossoms break in bloom.
And the comment:
This flower is a luck-bringer. Congratulations! Those present are to offer
you three cups of wine and are each to drink a cup of wine to your health.
     Caltrop threw six. Dai-yu to draw.
‘I wonder if there are any nice ones left,’ Dai-yu thought as she reached out to draw
a card. ‘I hope I shall pick one of them if there are.’
She looked at the card she had taken. It was a hibiscus flower. ‘Mourner of the
Autumn Mere’ the caption said, and the line of verse was by Ou-yang Xiu:
Your own self, not the East Wind, is your undoing.
The instructions said:
You are to drink a cup of wine yourself, and Peony is to take a cup with you.
     The others laughed.
     ‘Isn’t that good! It’s exactly the right flower for her.’
     Dai-yu too seemed pleased. When she and Bao-chai had drunk, she threw the
dice. Twenty. That meant that Aroma was to draw. Aroma reached out and took a
card. The picture on it was of a spray of peach-blossom with the caption ‘Fisherman’s
Lost Paradise’ and the verse, from Xie Fang-de:
Peach-trees in pink and another spring is here.
The instructions said:
Almond is to drink a cup of wine with you, so is anyone who is the same age as you,
anyone whose birthday is on the same day, and anyone who has the same surname.
     ‘This one sounds interesting,’ said the others, laughing, and at once began
working out which of them belonged to these categories. Caltrop, Skybright and
Bao-chai were all the same age as Aroma; Dai-yu’s birthday was on the same day; but
there appeared to be no one present with the same surname – until Parfumée
pointed out that her surname, like Aroma’s, was ‘Hua’ and claimed the right to drink
a cup as well.
     While the others were pouring out the wine, Dai-yu looked mischievously at
Tan-chun:
      ‘As both Almond and someone who is destined to marry royalty, you had better
begin.’
      ‘What’s that?’ said Tan-chun. She turned to Li Wan. ‘Oblige me by leaning over
and giving that girl a back-hander, would you?’
      ‘Oh, that seems rather hard!’ said Li Wan. ‘She’s not getting a royal husband and
now she is to be beaten as well!’
      Aroma was about to throw the dice when they heard someone calling outside
the gate. One of the old women hurried out to see who it was and came back to
tell them that it was some people from Aunt Xue’s come to collect Dai-yu.
      ‘What time is it?’ they asked the old woman.
      ‘Long past second watch,’ she said. ‘It struck eleven some time ago.’
      Bao-yu, refusing to believe that it could be so late, asked to see his watch. He
found on inspecting it, however, that it was in fact five and twenty minutes past
eleven. Dai-yu rose to her feet.
      ‘I can’t, in any case, keep going much longer,’ she said. ‘And I have to take my
medicine when I get back.’
      ‘Perhaps we’d all better break off now,’ said the others.
      Aroma and Bao-yu tried to dissuade them, but Li Wan and Tan-chun were
insistent.
‘It’s terribly late. We’ve already broken enough rules for one day.’
‘Very well,’ said Aroma. ‘All of you lust drink one more cup of wine then, and we’ll
let you go.’
Skybright, assisted by one of the junior maids, was already filling their cups. The
others drank up and called for their lanterns to be lit. When they were ready, Aroma
and the rest of the maids accompanied them all the way to the far side of Drenched
Blossoms Bridge before returning to Green Delights. There, having once more barred
the gate, they continued for a while with the game. Aroma filled some extra large
cups with wine and put a selection of the delicacies on the little dishes on to a large
plate to give to the old women who had been all this time on duty.
Everyone was by now beginning to be a little drunk. Soon they were playing
guess-fingers and singing solos. By two o’clock the old women, who had been
supplementing what the maids, in their kindness, had given them by surreptitiously
helping themselves, had made such formidable inroads into the wine-supply that the
two-gallon jar was suddenly found to be empty. On hearing that there was no more
wine, the maids began to clear the things away and to wash and prepare themselves
for bed.
Parfumée, who had drunk so much that her cheeks were flushed and her eyes
glittered with an unnatural brightness, was incapable of moving. She leaned inertly
against Aroma’s shoulder, murmuring plaintively in her ear.
‘Oh, Aroma! My heart is beating so!’
Aroma laughed.
     ‘You shouldn’t have drunk so much!’
Swallow and Number Four had long since succumbed and were lying asleep on the
kang. Skybright tried unsuccessfully to wake them; but Bao-yu stopped her:
‘Leave them alone. It doesn’t matter if we all sleep here for once.’
He followed their example by pillowing his head on the petal-stuffed damask cushion,
turning over on his side, and promptly dropping off to sleep.
     Aroma could see that Parfumée was extremely drunk. Fearing that any but the
slightest movement might make her sick, she lifted her up, very, very gently, and laid
her down beside Bao-yu on the kang. She herself lay down on the couch opposite. A
gentle oblivion then descended upon all of them and they slept like tops until
morning.
     It was already broad daylight when Aroma opened her eyes.
     ‘Oh, it’s late!’ she said.
     She raised her head up to look at the kang opposite. Parfumée was still fast
asleep, her head resting on the raised edge of the kang. Aroma hurriedly got up and
went across to wake her. Her calling aroused Bao-yu, who sat up, looked around him
cheerfully, commented ‘It’s late!’, and gave Parfumée a prod. Then Parfumée, too, sat
up, rubbing her eyes and still only half awake.
     ‘Shame on you!’ said Aroma, laughing at her. ‘Look where you spent last night!
You must have been very drunk, not to have chosen your place more carefully!’
     Parfumée looked around her and saw that she had spent the night at Bao-yu’s
side. She slipped off the kang hurriedly, with an embarrassed laugh.
      ‘How did I …?’
      ‘I don’t know either,’ said Bao-yu, laughing. ‘If I had known, I should have
rubbed some ink on your face!’
      Maids now came in carrying the basin and other things for his toilet.
      ‘Thank you all very much for last night’s party,’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ll have another
one tonight and this time you shall all be my guests.’
      ‘Oh, no!’ said Aroma. ‘Not again! If we make another rumpus tonight, people
will start complaining.’
      ‘That’s all right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It’s only twice. Anyway, we’re all seasoned
drinkers. Just think, we got through a whole two-gallon jar of wine last night! Just
as it was beginning to get interesting, we found that we’d run out.’
      ‘That’s how it should be,’ said Aroma. ‘It’s much better to end a party when the
fun is at its height than to go on until everyone is exhausted. I must say, everyone
was in very good form last night. Skybright was being quite abandoned. She even
sang a song, if I remember rightly!’
‘But don’t you remember?’ said Number Four. ‘You sang one too. We all did.’
A fit of uncontrollable giggles possessed the maids as they remembered, and they hid
their blushing faces in their hands. While they were still giggling, a smiling Patience
arrived. She had come to invite her hosts of the previous day to a return party.
‘No excuses!’ she said. ‘I shall expect every one of you to be there.’
They made her sit down and somebody fetched her some tea.
‘What a pity we didn’t have her with us last night!’ Skybright commented.
Patience pricked up her ears.
‘Why, what were you doing last night?’
‘I don’t know whether I ought to tell you,’ said Aroma. ‘We had a high old time, I
can tell you that. Even the high jinks Her Old Ladyship gets up to with the young
ladies and Master Bao are nothing compared to last night. We got through a whole
two-gallon jar of wine. We drank so much that we forgot our shame, singing songs
until after two o’clock, then lying around with our clothes on and sleeping where we
lay until morning.’
‘Charming!’ said Patience with pretended indignation. ‘You come and ask me for
wine, you don’t invite me to your party, and now you have the nerve to tell me what
a wonderful time you had. I feel really angry!’
‘He’s giving a return party tonight,’ said Skybright. ‘He’s sure to ask you to that. I
expect he’ll be going over himself shortly to invite you.’
‘“He” is who? Who is “he”?’ said Patience.
‘Oh, sharp-ears!’ Skybright coloured and pretended to strike her. ‘Trust you to pick
on a little thing like that!’
‘Well, I can’t stay here talking, I’ve got something to attend to,’ said Patience. ‘I’ll be
sending someone over later to tell you when it’s ready. Mind you all come now, or I’ll
have the troops out to come and get you!’
Bao-yu and the maids tried to detain her, but she was already on her way.
Bao-yu now completed his interrupted toilet and took his early morning tea. While
he sat sipping it, his eye chanced to light on a sheet of paper underneath the
inkstone.
‘I wish you girls wouldn’t use my inkstone as a paper?weight,’ he said.
Aroma and Skybright were immediately on the defensive.
‘Oh dear! Who’s at fault this time?’
Bao-yu pointed towards the offending paper.
‘Look. Under the inkstone. Someone’s pattern, I expect, that she forgot to put
away.’
Skybright lifted the inkstone and picked up the paper from underneath. It was not an
embroidery-pattern but some kind of writing. She handed it to Bao-yu. It was a sheet
of pink, patterned letter-paper. A single column of characters ran down the centre of
it:
From Adamantina, the Dweller Beyond the Threshold: Respect?ful Anniversary
Greetings.
‘Who took delivery of this note?’ he asked, jumping up excitedly.
Assuming, from the degree of agitation, that the note must be from a person of some
consequence, Aroma and Skybright took up the question. In response to their
shouted inquiry, a smiling Number Four came running into the room.
‘I did. From Adamantina. She didn’t bring it herself, she sent one of the old women
with it. I put it down somewhere in here. I meant to tell you about it, but with all that
drinking last night I forgot.’
‘So that’s who it’s from,’ said the other maids. ‘What a fuss about nothing!’
But Bao-yu evidently did not think so.
‘Fetch me some paper,’ he said, still in some agitation, and himself began grinding
the ink. But when the ink was ground and he sat with moistened brush poised in
readiness over the virgin paper, he found that he did not know how to begin. What
was the correct response to ‘Dweller Beyond the Threshold’? For a long time he sat
thinking, but no inspira?tion was forthcoming.
‘It’s no good asking Bao-chai,’ he thought. ‘She’d only say something critical about
Adamantina being too “fanciful”. I’d better ask Dai-yu.’
Slipping Adamantina’s note into his sleeve, he set off in the direction of the Naiad’s
House. He was just stepping off the Drenched Blossoms bridge when he caught sight
of Xing Xiu-yan bustling along in a very purposeful manner from the opposite
direction.
‘Where are you going?’ he asked her.
‘I want to have a talk with Adamantina.’
Bao-yu was surprised.
‘Adamantina is such a strange, contrary person. There are very few people she can
get on with. If she thinks highly of you, it proves that you must be made of finer stuff
than the rest of us.’
‘I don’t know whether she thinks particularly highly of me,’ said Xiu-yan, ‘but we
were neighbours for ten years. When she was serving her novitiate at the Coiled
Incense Temple, there was only a party wall separating her from the place where my
family lived. My family was too poor to own a house and for ten years lived in rented
accommodation in her temple. Whenever I had nothing else to do, I used to go inside
the nuns’ courtyard and spend my time with Adamantina. It was she who taught me
to read and write. In fact, everything I know, practically, I owe to her. So you see,
she’s not only my “hard times friend”; she is also in a sense my teacher. When my
parents finally came here to throw themselves on the generosity of your family, we
learned that Ada?mantina, too, had found a home here. She had evidently found this
a place where her eccentricities would be tolerated and where she would be safe
from molestation by those having the power to persecute her. It seemed as if our
destinies must be linked. And I was glad to find, when I went to look her up here, that
her friendship for me was unaltered. In fact, I think that if anything she is even nicer
to me now than she was before.’
As if by a flash of lightning, the mystery of Xiu-yan’s utter alienness from her
appalling parents was revealed.
‘I see!’ he said. ‘That ethereal, crane-in-the-clouds quality one notices in everything
you do or say-I see now where you get it from. As a matter of fact it’s something to
do with Adamantina that has brought me out. Something she wrote has been
puzzling me and I was on my way to ask someone else’s advice about it when I ran
into you. It’s an extraordinary bit of luck that I did, because you are obviously much
better qualified to advise me than the person I had been intending to ask.’
He took the piece of paper from his sleeve and showed it to her. Xiu-yan ran her eye
over it and laughed.
‘She’ll never change. The same whimsical, preposterous Adamantina as always!
Who but Adamantina would use her nom-de-plume in a birthday greeting? Talk
about “a monk no monk and a maid no maid”! What sort of etiquette is that?’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Bao-yu, smiling. ‘Adamantina is above etiquette. She doesn’t
subscribe to the conventions of our mundane world. Her writing to me in this way
shows that she must credit me with some intelligence. Unfortunately I haven’t the
faintest idea in what terms I ought to reply. I was on my way to ask Cousin Lin’s
advice when I was fortunate enough to bump into you.’
For some moments Xiu-yan ran her eyes up and down Bao-yu appraisingly. Finally
she broke into a laugh.
‘“The sight of it exceedeth the report thereof.” I see now what they mean. I’m not
surprised she sent you this. And I’m not surprised she gave you all that plum-blossom
last year. Well, if even Adamantina has succumbed, I suppose I shall have to do my
little bit by explaining what this means.
‘Adamantina is fond of saying that out of all the poems by all the poets of the Han,
Jin, North-and-South, Tang and Song dynasties, a couple of lines in Fan Cheng-da’s
“Walk in the Cemetery” are the only decent verses ever written:
Though you hide behind a threshold of indestructible iron,
The mound shaped like a wheat-cake will claim you for its own.
That’s why she calls herself “The Dweller Beyond the Threshold”. Her favourite
prose-writer is Zhuang-zi, so sometimes she calls herself “The Outsider”, after
Zhuang-zi’s “outsider ... wandering beyond the realm”. The way to please her is to
refer to yourself modestly as someone still trapped in the toils of the wicked world
while she is floating freely somewhere above them. If she’d called herself “The
Outsider” in this note she’s sent you, the right response would have been to call
yourself “The Worldling” in your reply. As she’s called herself “The Dweller Beyond
the Threshold”, you should refer to yourself in answering as “The Dweller Behind the
Threshold”, to indicate that you have understood the reference to Fan Cheng-da.’
The scriptures tell us that the revelation of the Buddha-truth comes ‘like ghee poured
upon the head’. Bao-yu must have had some such feeling as he listened to Xiu-yan,
for he first of all gave a gasp of discovery and then laughed out loud.
‘I see! That’s why our family temple is called the “Temple of the Iron Threshold”！
Thank you very much. Now I can go and write my reply.’
Xiu-yan continued on her way to Green Bower Hermitage and Bao-yu went back to
write his note. He wrote:
From Bao-yu, Dweller Behind the Threshold, Devout and Humble Thanks.
He carried the note to the Hermitage himself and posted it through the crack
between the double doors.
By the time he got back to Green Delights, Parfumee had just completed her toilet.
She had gone back to the elaborate feminine coiffure which she normally favoured,
complete with kingfisher-feather hair-ornaments; but Bao-yu said he would prefer to
see her permanently got up like a boy. He had her fringe and side-pieces cut off and
the remaining short bits shaved away from her forehead round to the back of her
neck, so that only the long hair growing from the crown of her head remained.
‘We’ll get you a big fur cap with ear-flaps to wear in the winter,’ he said, ‘and big
tiger-boots for your feet, or white socks and thick-soled, stitch-patterned padded
shoes, to go with loose-bottomed trousers. And we’d better change your name.
“Parfumée” won’t do for a boy. What about “Honey Boy”? We can call you “Honey”
for short.’
     Parfumée was delighted.
‘Now you’ll be able to take me with you when you go outside,’ she said. ‘If anyone
asks about me, you can tell them that I’m one of your pages, like Tealeaf.’
Bao-yu smiled at the idea, but seemed rather doubtful.
‘I think sooner or later they’d be able to tell that you weren’t.’
‘You have no imagination!’ said Parfumée ‘Tell them I’m a foreign page. Your
family’s got several foreign pages.* Anyway a pigtail suits me; everyone says it does.
What about it? Don’t you think it’s a brilliant idea?’
Bao-yu was quite won over.
* Stone’s Note to Reader:
Both the Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family did in fact employ a number of
foreign captives taken by previous members of the family in their various military
campaigns and later graciously bestowed on them as bond-slaves by His Imperial
Majesty. They were invariably employed as grooms, being useless for any other kind
of work. Parfumee transvestism was by no means a novelty in the household. The
tomboyish Shi Xiang-yun had long since shown a passion for dressing up in military
uniform and was frequently to be seen wearing a cavalryman’s belt and tight-sleeved
riding habit. When Bao-yu put Parfumee into boy’s clothing, she was quick to follow
suit by dressing her own Althee in a page’s costume. As a ‘painted face’ Althee was
already in the habit of shaving off the short hair above her forehead and round her
ears to facilitate making-up and had acquired a certain masculinity of movement and
gesture from the roles she played, so the transformation was in her case a less drastic
one. Li Wan and Tan-chun were so taken with the result that they decided to dress
Bao-qin’s Cardamome up as a little page as well. Her hair was done up in two knots
like horns, one on each side of her head. Dressed in trousers and a short smock and
with a pair of red shoes on her feet she looked - except for the make-up - exactly like
the scholar’ page, Lute Boy, in the play. Xiang-yun changed Althee’s name to ‘Valiant’
because she thought it suited her. Cardamome was the youngest, liveliest and most
mischievous of the little ex-actresses and the majority of the Garden’s inhabitants
had already taken to calling her by less flattering sobriquets long before her
transformation into a page. After the transformation had been made, Bao-qin
rejected ‘Lute Boy’ as too obvious; and since she liked ‘Cardamome’ and thought it a
pretty name, she resolved to retain at any rate the middle part of it by calling the
new page ‘Damon’.
Stone
‘It’s a very good idea. I’ve often seen officials with little foreign servants - mostly
Tartars or Tibetans captured in the wars. People like to have them as grooms because
they are good at handling horses and don’t mind waiting about in the cold. We’ll
have to give you a foreign name then. What about “Yelü Hunni” ? “Yelü” is an old
Kitan Surname and “Hunni” is what the Xiong-nu used to call themselves.’
Parfumée was very satisfied with this, so it was agreed that in future she would
always be referred to as Yel Parfumée Hunni.
After lunch Patience’s messenger arrived to say that, as the summerhouse in the
Peony Garden was thought to be too hot, her return party had been laid out in the
Shady Elm rooms. You-shi came over well in advance, bringing two of Cousin Zhen’s
little concubines, Lovey and Dove, with her from Ning-guo House. They were very
young and wild and had seldom been taken to the neighbouring mansion before.
Today, meeting such lively members of the Garden’s society as Caltrop, Xiang-yun,
Parfumée and étamine for the first time, they were in their element, quickly proving
the truth of the old saying about ‘birds of a feather’ by chattering nineteen to the
dozen with their new-found friends and dashing off with them on an exploratory tour
of the Garden. You-shi was left to the company of her own maids.
Presently, when they were visiting Green Delights, Caltrop, Lovey and Dove were very
much amused to hear Bao-yu addressing Parfumée as ‘Yelü Hunni’. Having elicited
from her how she came to have acquired so extraordinary a name, they began to try
using it themselves; but in their unpractised mouths the foreign sounds soon
degenerated into ‘Yellow Honey’; and even this was soon abandoned in favour of
‘Yellow Belly’. The maids, hearing them call her this, were all in stitches. Bao-yu
feared that Parfumée would be wounded by their hilarity and proposed yet another
change of name.
‘There is a land in the West called “Fran-see-ya” where they make a kind of golden
glitter-glass called “aventurin”. You are such a bright and glittering person yourself: I
think the name Aventurin would suit you very well.’
Parfumée was delighted with it. But it was still no good: the others found ‘Aventurin’
too difficult; and having established that it was the name of some kind of foreign
glass, soon took to calling her ‘Glassy’ or ‘Glass-eyes’ instead.
      But we digress.
      The party in the Shady Elm rooms had now begun. Once more wine was made
an excuse for much unrestrained hilarity. The blind ballad-singers were asked to drum
for them and Patience broke off a spray of peonies to play ‘passing the branch’ with.
There must have been near enough twenty people taking part in the game. Just as
the fun was at its height, it was announced that two women had arrived delivering
things from the Zhen family in Nanking and Tan-chun, Li Wan and You-shi had to go
off to the jobs room to receive them. The others decided to make a little break in the
party while they did so, in which those who wanted to could take some exercise
outside. Lovey and Dove decided to have a swing.
      ‘You get up as well,’ Bao-yu said to Lovey, who was pushing. ‘I’ll push you both.’
      ‘Oh no you don’t!’ said Lovey. ‘I know your kind of pushing! Yellow-belly can
push us.’
      ‘Please,’ said Bao-yu exasperatedly, ‘don’t call her by that horrible name! You’ll
have all the others calling her by it as well.’
      Dove was giggling helplessly on the swing.
      ‘Stop it, you two! I can’t work this thing properly if you make me laugh. I shall
fall off, if you’re not careful, and knock all the gravy out of you!’
      While they were in the midst of their diversions, a group of servants from the
Ning-guo mansion came rushing up in a state of great agitation.
      ‘Sir Jing is dead!’
      ‘Dead?’ Everyone hearing them was incredulous. ‘But he hadn’t been ill. How
can he have died so suddenly?’
      ‘He spent all his time looking for the secret of immortality.’ said one of the
servants. ‘Perhaps he found it and went off to heaven.’
      You-shi heard the news with dismay. There would be so much to do, and with
Cousin Zhen, Jia Rong and Jia Lian all three away, no dependable male around to help
her. The first thing she did, of course, was to remove all her jewellery and the
ornaments from her hair. Then, having ordered some of the household to go on
ahead and put all the Taoists there under lock and key pending her husband’s return,
she got into her carriage and drove with all speed to the Dark Truth Monastery
outside the city, accompanied by the Chief Steward Lai Sheng’s wife and several of
the senior stewardesses. Meanwhile other servants were dispatched to various
members of the faculty requesting their attendance at the monastery.
The physicians duly arrived. As the patient was already dead, there was little scope
for their customary methods of diagnosis; but they knew that Sir Jing had gone in for
breath-control and various other kinds of Taoist hocus-pocus, some of which, like the
worship of the Seven Stars, the keeping of ‘ghost-worm’ vigils and the swallowing of
mercuric ‘elixirs’, must have gravely weakened his constitution and may well have
hastened his death; and when they saw the purple face and cracked and shrivelled
lips of the corpse and felt the iron-hard abdomen, they had little difficulty in forming
their collective opinion, which their spokesman delivered forthwith to the waiting
women: ‘That death was due to edema and corrosion following ingestion by the
deceased of some toxic metallic substance in pursuance of his Taoist researches.’
‘It wasn’t toxic,’ protested the Taoists, alarmed for their own safety. ‘It was an
infallible secret formula, but it needed to be taken in the right conditions. We told
him he wasn’t ready for it, but he wouldn’t believe us. He must have taken it during
the vigil last night, when he was meditating on his own and there was nobody around
to stop him. He will have gone straight to heaven, of course: such faith is sure to be
rewarded. We must rejoice that he has cast off the corrupt gar?ment of flesh and left
this sea of misery behind him.’
But You-shi had no intention of getting drawn into an argument. Her only reply was
to give orders that they should all be locked up again and remain so until Cousin
Zhen could deal with them when he got back. Riders were dispatched post-haste to
inform him of his father’s death.
You-shi could see at a glance that the monastery’s accommodation was far too
cramped for the lying-in-state; on the other hand there could be no question of her
taking the corpse back with her into the city. She therefore had it wrapped up and
carried in a curtained chair to the Temple of the Iron Threshold. And as she calculated
that it would probably be at least half a month before Cousin Zhen got back, by
which time, as this was the hottest part of the year, the process of decomposition
would already be well advanced, she decided, acting on her own initiative, to consult
an astrologer and find out the earliest date on which the body could be encoffined.
The coffin was conveniently to hand, having been deposited in the Temple of the Iron
Threshold when it was purchased some years previously. The formal going into
mourning and its attendant ceremonies were scheduled to take place three days later.
Staging was put up in readiness for the Taoists and Buddhists, but their requiems
were to be deferred until Cousin Zhen should have returned.
While You-shi and the already depleted staff were attending to these matters outside
the city, no one with authority was left in the two mansions able to deal with callers
from outside. On the Rong-guo side Xi-feng was still unable to see people because of
her illness, Li Wan was fully occupied in looking after the young people, and Bao-yu
was too lacking in savoir-faire to be trusted. It was necessary to call in a number of
obscure junior clansmen who had done occasional odd-jobs for the family in the past:
Jia Bin, Jia Guang, Jia Heng(Ⅰ), Jia Chang and Jia Ling. On the Ning-guo side even the
internal running of the household was a problem, since You-shi was for the time
being unable to get back at all. She had to call on her step-mother, old Mrs You, to
keep an eye on things for her. As Mrs You had two young unmarried daughters by a
previous marriage, the most sensible arrangement seemed to be to bring the girls
with her and install herself in temporary residence at Ning-guo House.
At this point our story moves elsewhere. As soon as the news reached him of his
father’s death, Cousin Zhen made an urgent application for leave of absence to the
Board of Rites. He included Jia Rong’s name in the petition, since Jia Rong was,
nominally at any rate, the holder of a commis?sion. The officials of the Board of Rites,
bearing in mind His Imperial Majesty’s devotion to the Late Emperor and
determination to give fullest expression to it in these obsequies of the Late Emperor’s
favourite Consort, dared not grant leave of absence on their own initiative and
referred the matter to the Emperor himself in a memorial. But the Son of Heaven,
with that godlike compassion that is so typical of him, far from making his own
bereavement an objection, saw it as all the more reason for sympathizing with the
bereavement of a subject - particularly one whose ancestor had performed such
great and signal services for the Crown. His immediate reac?tion on reading the
memorial was to ask for particulars of Jia Jing’s official rank. The Board of Rites
memorialized back as follows:
Jia Jing: Palace Graduate, Second Class. His hereditary office and emoluments were
passed on during his lifetime to his son Jia Zhen. Owing to age and ill-health, he had
for some years past been living in religious seclusion at the Dark Truth Monastery,
where he was resident at the time of his death. Jia Zhen and his son Jia Rong are in
attendance here at the mausoleum for the obsequies of Her Late Highness and are
Your Imperial Majesty’s petitioners for leave to absent themselves in order to attend
to the funeral arrangements.
On receipt of this memorial His Imperial Majesty was graciously pleased to issue the
following Rescript:
Although Jia Jing’s own life appears to have been undistin?guished by service to the
state, nevertheless in recognition of the distinguished record of loyal service to the
Crown of his grandfather the Duke of Ning-guo it is Our pleasure that a Court
appointment carrying the honours and entitlements of an officer of the Fifth Rank
should be bestowed upon him posthumously, and that his son and grandson should
be authorized to convey his remains into the Capital, entering by way of the Lower
North Gate, and to display them there in their private residence in the customary
manner; and thereafter, having duly carried out all rites and ceremonies that are
lawful to be performed, to convey them thence to the deceased’s registered place of
origin for interment. And furthermore it is Our pleasure that Our treasury at the
Imperial Victuallers should disburse to the said son and grandson a sum being the
equivalent of one portion of funeral offerings of the First Grade towards the
defrayment of the said Jia Jing’s funeral expenses; and that it should he lawful and
permitted for holders of Court appointments up to and including the rank of Prince
and Duke to make offerings and condolences.
     When the contents of this Rescript were made known, it was not only the
members of the Jia family who expressed their gratitude: all the great officers of the
Court were loud in their praises of this extraordinary example of Imperial
magnani?mity.
Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong at once set off on horseback, determined to ride both night
and day until they reached their destination. About half way along their road they
came upon a group of horsemen riding hell-for-leather towards them who turned out
to be Jia Bin and Jia Guang at the head of a party of Jia family domestics. They threw
themselves from their saddles as soon as they recognized Cousin Zhen and touched
knee and hand to the ground in the Manchu salute.
‘Why have you come?’ Cousin Zhen asked them.
‘Mrs Zhen was worried that when you and Rong left there would be no one to
escort Her Old Ladyship,’ Jia Bin replied, ‘so she sent us to take your place.’
Cousin Zhen expressed his approval of his wife’s thoughtfulness.
‘And what about things at home?’ he asked. ‘How have you been managing?’
Jia Bin told him how You-shi had had the Taoists put under arrest, how she had had
Jia Jing’s body moved to the family temple, and how, in order that there might be
someone at home to keep an eye on things during her absence, she had persuaded
her step-mother and two step-sisters to move into temporary residence at Ning-guo
House. At mention of the two step-sisters the face of Jia Rong, who had dismounted
when the others did, was observed to break into a grin. For his part Cousin Zhen
merely nodded, observed several times over that these arrangements were ‘very
sensible’, and, touching the riding-whip to his horse’s flanks, was on his way once
more.
Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong rode on then through daylight and darkness, stopping at
post-houses along the way only long enough to obtain a change of mount. It was
night-time when they approached the outskirts of the Capital and well after two in
the morning when they reached the Temple of the Iron Threshold. Those keeping
watch had to rouse the others up to meet them. Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong
dismounted and lifted up their voices in loud wailing. Still wailing, they crawled on
their knees all the way from the Outer gate of the temple to the lying-in-state room
inside. There, at the foot of the coffin, they knocked their heads repeatedly on the
floor and wept with abandon until daylight, by which time they had all but lost their
voices.
After a brief intermission during which Cousin Zhen was greeted by You-shi and the
rest (for he had not, till that moment, had an opportunity of speaking to them) he
and Jia Rong changed into the appropriate hempen mourning-garments before
returning to bow once more at the foot of the coffin.
Cousin Zhen found it impossible to achieve quite that state of self-absorbed grief -
‘oblivious to all around’ - which books of etiquette require of the bereaved son: there
were too many things that needed attending to. For example, friends and relations
had to be informed about the Gracious Rescript permitting a lying-in-state at the
mansion and the receiving of offerings and condolences there. Jia Rong was ordered
back home to make all preparations necessary for receiving the coffin.
Jia Rong was pleased with his commission. Hurrying to horse, he rode briskly into the
city. As soon as he got back, he ordered the servants to begin clearing the furniture
from the front reception hall at Ning-guo House and making a shrine for the coffin
there out of screens and hangings. He also told them to put up awnings for the
funeral bands outside the doorway, and a cloth and cane archway which should later
be covered with funerary inscriptions. When he was satis?fied that all this work was
well in hand, he hurried into the inner apartments to meet his grandmother and two
young aunts.
The Hon. Mrs You (the late Mr You - You-shi’s father – had been a mandarin of the
sixth rank) was an elderly lady much given to taking naps. She was in fact recumbent
upon the kang and refreshing herself with sleep at the moment when Jia Rong
entered. It was the two daughters, sewing amidst their maids, who welcomed him.
‘I’m glad you’ve come, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong, grinning broadly at the elder of them.
(Her name was Er-jie.) ‘Father has been longing to see you.’
Er-jie turned red.
‘Now look here, young Rong,’ she said, ‘you behave yourself! I suppose you are one
of those people who, if they don’t get a good telling-off every once in a while, don’t
feel comfortable. You are supposed to be a well-bred, educated young gentleman,
yet a coolie would have better manners.’
She picked up the nearest object to hand, which happened to be a flat-iron, and
made as if to aim it at his head. Jia Rong ducked in alarm, clasping his head in his
arms; he ducked not away from her, however, but towards her, and ended up on her
bosom, laughing and begging for mercy. At this the younger sister, San-jie, came over
and tried to fasten her nails upon his mouth.
‘We’ll tell our sister about you when she gets back.’
Jia Rong knelt between them on the kang, entreating them not to, whereupon the
two sisters collapsed in laughter.
He noticed that Erjie was eating cardamums and made a grab at them intending to
take some for himself. As he did so, Er-jie spat a chewed-up mouthful of them in his
face. Quite unperturbedly, he began licking off the particles that he could reach with
his tongue and nibbling them. This was more than even the maids could stomach.
‘Look at you, freshly in mourning and your old grannie lying there right under your
nose!’ they said. ‘These are your aunts, after all, even though they are so young: you
ought to have more respect for your mother than to treat her family like this. Wait till
we tell the Master when he gets back: he’ll give you what for!’
Temporarily abandoning his aunts, Jia Rong went over to the maids, put his arms
around two of them and began kissing them.
‘My darlings, you are so right! I shan’t interfere with them any more.’
The maids pushed him off indignantly.
‘Pig!’ The maid who said this spoke with feeling. ‘You have a wife and maids of your
own; what do you need to come bothering us for? An understanding person would
realize that this was only fun, but what about someone who didn’t know? There are
plenty of dirty-minded, gossiping busy?bodies who would be only too pleased to go
tattling about this sort of thing to the other mansion, and before you know where
you are the gossips there will be passing round the most terrible stories about us.’
‘Their household is completely separate from ours,’ said Jia Rong, ‘why should they
bother about what we do here? Anyway, they’ve got scandal enough of their own to
keep them busy! Every family history has got a few scandals in it. Look at the stories
they tell about the rulers of the Han and Tang dynasties: “Filthy Tang and stinking
Han” they say, don’t they? If even the families of emperors were like that, you can
hardly expect ours to be any different. As for the household next door: look how
strict Great-uncle She is, yet Uncle Lian still manages to get up to a few tricks with
that little chamber-wife; and look what a tough nut Aung Feng is, yet that didn’t stop
Uncle Rui thinking he could settle her business. Do you imagine I don’t know what
they get up to over there -?’
He seemed to be warming to the subject and would doubtless have treated them to
other even less edifying examples of Rong-guo depravity, had not the old lady
suddenly woken up at that point, necessitating an abrupt change of manner. At once
he dropped down on his knee and began inquiring solicitously about her health.
‘It is so good of you to have gone to all this trouble for us, Grandma,’ he said, ‘and
for Auntie Er and Auntie San to put up with so much inconvenience on our behalf.
Father and I don’t know how to thank you. I expect after this business is over we
shall all be coming round to your place and making you a kotow.’
‘Bless the boy, what eloquence!’ said the old lady, nodding appreciatively. ‘For our
own kin, though: it’s the least we could do. And how is your father?’ she asked him.
‘When did he hear the news? When did you get back?’
‘We’ve only just got back,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Father sent me on to see you immediately.
He was particularly anxious that I should persuade you to stay here until everything is
over.’
He winked at the two young aunts while he was saying this. Er-jie pretended to grind
her teeth angrily, though she was trying not to laugh.
‘Glib-tongued little ape!’ she said. ‘We’re to be kept around here as second strings
for your father, I suppose?’
‘Don’t you worry!’ said Jia Rong, his eye on the old lady. ‘My father has your
interests very much at heart. He’s been looking for years now for a couple of
well-placed, rich, handsome young husbands for my two aunties. Now he’s found
one at last - someone he met the other day on the journey.’
He was only joking, but the old lady took it all as gospel truth and asked him what the
name was of this prospective son-in-law. Er-jie, laughing, laid down her sewing and
ran across to strike him.
‘Don’t believe a word he says, Ma! He’s a wicked liar!’
Even the maids were outraged.
‘If the Lord in Heaven can hear you, you’d better watch out for the lightning!’ said
one of them.
Just then a servant entered:
‘We’ve finished all the things you told us to do, Master Rong. Will you go back now
and tell the Master it’s all ready?’
Off went Jia Rong then, smiling all over his face.
But what happened after that will be told in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 64

Five fair women make subjects for
a chaste maid’s verse
And nine jade dragons make a
love-gift for a flirt



As soon as Jia Rong learned that evening was ready, he returned to the temple and
reported to his father to that effect. At once preparations for the procession into the
city were put in motion. Bearers were organized, insignia, funeral banners and all the
other paraphernalia got ready overnight, and messengers hurriedly sent out to
relations and friends telling them when the procession would set out: five o’clock on
the morn?ing of the fourth.
The procession, needless to say, was of dazzling magnificence, and troops of
mourners took part in it. It provoked varying reactions from the crowd numbering
many thousands who lined the road to watch it, all the way from the Temple of the
Iron Threshold to the gates of Ning-guo House. Some took a simple pleasure in the
spectacle; others admired the wealth which had created it; but there were also a few
sour-faced Confucian scholars who looked down their noses and muttered something
about sumptuousness being no substitute for grief. A buzz of discussion followed its
passing all along the route.
The procession reached the mansion at about three in the afternoon; the coffin was
deposited in its shrine in the main hall; offerings were made; the lament was raised.
After that the mourners began gradually to depart. Only those members of the Jia
clan remained who had undertaken to lend the family a hand with the reception.
Among relations not of the Jia sur?name the only one to stay behind was Lady Xing’s
brother, Xing De-quan.
As long as there were visitors around, convention obliged Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong
to remain in appropriately grief-stricken attitudes beside the coffin, conforming, as
far as possible, to the scriptural canons on mourning which enjoin the bereaved son,
among other things, to ‘lie upon rushes with a sod of earth for his pillow’; but as
soon as the last guest had gone, they were off like a shot to enjoy the society of their
young female relations inside.
Throughout this period Bao-yu too was expected to put on mourning and go over
every day to Ning-guo House to spend the whole day there beside the coffin. Xi-feng
was not well enough to go over daily, but on days when there were sutra-readings
and the callers were numerous, she would drag herself over and lend You-shi a hand
in entertaining the wives.
One morning after the early offering, when Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong, worn out by a
succession of short nights and long, exhausting days, lay dozing beside the coffin,
Bao-yu thought that as there were no visitors he might just as well go back home and
see Dai-yu. Calling at Green Delights on the way, he found the courtyard silent and
deserted. In the coolness of the surrounding gallery a few old women and junior
maids were sitting or lying about in various postures of sleep. He had no wish to
disturb them, and would have made his way into the house alone; but just as he was
approaching the doorway, Number Four caught sight of him and started up,
intending to raise the blind for him to enter. She had not time to do so however, for
at that very moment Parfumée came rushing out and very nearly ran into him. She
checked her?self just in time.
‘What are you doing here?’ There was an expression of pleased surprise on her face.
‘Don’t let Skybright get me! She’s trying to hit me.’
Inside the room there was a clatter of numerous tiny objects striking the floor and a
moment later Skybright burst through the doorway in pursuit.
‘Where are you, you little wretch? If you’ve lost, you have to have a slap. It’s no
good running to Bao-yu to protect you: he isn’t here today.’
Bao-yu laughingly intercepted her.
‘She’s only little. I don’t know how she’s offended you, but won’t you forgive her for
my sake?’
Bao-yu’s sudden appearance at that moment was so unexpected that Skybright
found it comical.
‘Parfumée must be a little witch! I wouldn’t have thought even magic spells could
bring someone so quickly! Well, I don’t care!’ she said, having recovered somewhat
from her surprise. ‘Magic or no magic, I’m going to get her!’
She wrested the arm free that Bao-yu was holding and darted at Parfumée; but
Parfumée dodged behind Bao-yu’s back and clung to him. Bao-yu took Skybright by
one hand and Parfumée by the other and walked with them into the room. There, on
the kang under the west wall, Musk, Ripple, Emerald and Swallow sat playing dibs:
melon-seeds for winners and slaps for losers. Parfumée had lost to Skybright and run
out to avoid the slap. The clattering noise that Bao-?yu had heard was the sound of
dib-stones falling from Skybright’s lap when she got up to chase her. Bao-yu surveyed
the scene approvingly.
‘I thought you’d be a bit quiet here with me away,’ he said. ‘And as the days are so
long now, I was afraid you might be going to sleep after lunch and making yourselves
ill. I’m glad you’ve found a way of keeping yourselves amused - Where’s Aroma?’ he
asked, suddenly noticing that she was not with them.
‘Oh, Aroma,’ said Skybright. ‘Aroma’s gone religious. She’s sitting on her own in the
next room like Bodhidharma with her face to the wall. I haven’t dared disturb her so I
haven’t the least idea what she’s doing. Whatever it is, she’s being very quiet about it.
You’d better go in and have a look: perhaps she’s attained Enlightenment!’
Bao-yu laughed and went into the inner room. He found Aroma sitting on the couch
by the window making knots in a length of grey silk cord. She rose to her feet as he
entered.
‘What lies has that wretch Skybright been telling about me? I wanted to get on with
this knotting, that’s what I came in here for. I hadn’t got time to fool about with the
others, so I pretended that I wanted to take advantage of your being away by sitting
here quietly on my own and meditating for a bit. Bodhidharma, indeed! I’ll pinch that
girl’s mouth!’
Bao-yu laughed and sat down beside her to watch her knot.
‘The days are so long now, you ought to take a break of some kind. If you don’t
fancy playing with the others, why not come with me to see Cousin Lin? Surely it’s
much too hot for knotting?’
‘I noticed that you’re still wearing that old black fan-cover we made for you when
you went into mourning for Mrs Rong. As long as you were only wearing it once or
twice a year, it didn’t seem worth the trouble of replacing it; but now that you have
to wear summer mourning every day at the other House, I thought it was high time I
made you a new one. As soon as I’ve finished this cord for it, you can take the old
one off and put it on. I know you don’t care very much about this sort of thing, but if
Her Old Ladyship were to see you wearing the old one when she got back, she’d be
sure to blame me for neglecting you. She’d say I was too lazy even to notice what you
were wearing.’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘It’s very nice of you to have thought about it. But don’t drive yourself too hard. You
don’t want to give yourself a heat stroke.’
At that moment Parfumée came in carrying a cup of water?-cooled tea for him on a
tray. Because as a little boy he had been delicate, Bao-yu was never given ice-cold tea
to drink in summer. To cool his tea they plunged the tea-pot into a basin of water
freshly drawn from the well. The water was changed several times until the tea inside
the pot, though not chilled, had reached a pleasant freshness. He drank half the
contents of the cup while Parfumée held it to his lips, then turned his head back
again to address Aroma.
‘I told Tealeaf when I left that if anyone important turns up at Cousin Zhen’s, he is
to let me know immediately; otherwise I shan’t be going back there.’
He got up to go. As he was leaving the house, he called back to Emerald and the
others in the outer room:
‘If I’m wanted for anything, you’ll find me at Miss Lin’s.’
On his way there, just as he was about to cross Drenched Blossoms Bridge, he came
upon Snowgoose followed by two old women carrying an assortment of caltrops,
melons and lotus-roots.
‘What are they for?’ Bao-yu asked her. ‘I know your mistress never eats that sort of
thing. Is she expecting Mrs Zhu or someone?’
‘If I tell you, you mustn’t let on when you see her,’ said Snowgoose.
Bao-yu nodded.
‘You can go on ahead and give that stuff to Miss Nightingale,’ Snowgoose said to
the two women. ‘If she asks you why I’m not with you, tell her I’m doing something
and I’ll be back directly.’
The women made some reply and continued on their way. Snowgoose waited until
they were out of earshot.
‘The Mistress has been feeling a bit better this last day or two. But when Miss Tan
looked in after lunch today and wanted her to go with her to call on Mrs Lian, she
wouldn’t go. She appeared to be thinking about something and had a little cry. Then
presently she picked up her writing-brush and did a lot of writing - poetry I think. She
told me to send out for some melons and things. While I did that, she said,
Nightin?gale was to clear the qin-table in the inner room, move it into the outside
room, and put the dragon incense-burner on it. She said she’d tell us what to do with
the melons when I got back. If she’s planning to entertain someone, I don’t see what
she wants the incense-burner for - certainly not for burning incense in, because she
doesn’t like incense as a rule. She likes to have fresh flowers and fruit and gourds
about her but not incense because she doesn’t like the smell of it in her clothes.
Anyway, if she does want to burn some, why not in the inner room, where she
spends all her time? Unless it’s because the old women have made the outer room a
bit smelly and she’s burning it to get rid of the smell. The fact is, I really don’t know.
You’ll have to go and find out for yourself.’
While she was speaking, Bao-yu had unconsciously lowered his head.
‘From what Snowgoose says,’ he thought, ‘there must be some other reason for
this. She wouldn’t have things put out specially if she were merely entertaining one
of the girls. Perhaps today is the anniversary of Aunt Lin’s death. No, just a bit: it can’t
be. When it is, Grandma always sends her the stuff for the offering and she’s done
that already this year. Perhaps it’s for a seasonal offering. Perhaps she’s been reading
the Doctrine of the Mean:
In each season of the year ... offer things seasonable
It’s possible. If I go and see her now, when she is feeling upset, I am sure to want to
talk her out of it and shall probably only succeed in causing her to suppress her grief.
On the other hand, if I don’t go, then with no one there to stop her, she may simply
go on getting more and more upset. Either way will be bad for her. The best thing will
be for me to go and see Cousin Feng first, sit with her for a bit, and look in at Cousin
Lin’s on my way back. Then, if she is still upset, I shall try to find some means of
consoling her. In that way I shall be able to prevent her grief from getting out of hand,
though at the same time she will have had a chance of giving it expression, so that
there will be no danger of its being unhealthily repressed.’
Having come to this decision, he let Snowgoose go on to the Naiad’s House alone and
made his way out of the Garden to Xi-feng’s place. He arrived just as a number of
women-servants who had been reporting on household matters were leaving. Xi-feng
herself was leaning inside the gateway talking to Patience. She smiled at Bao-yu as
she saw him come.
‘You’ve come back, then? I’ve just this moment been telling Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife to
send someone over to the other place to tell your pages that if you don’t appear to
be doing anything they ought to slip in and ask you to come back here for a rest. I
was afraid that in this hot weather with so many people milling around there, you
might find the sweaty smells a bit too much for you. But you’ve come back anyway,
so I needn’t have bothered.’
‘Thank you for the kind thought, though,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I decided to come back here
partly because there was nothing there for me to do, but also because I noticed that
you haven’t been over there for some days and I wanted to see if you were all right.
How are you feeling lately?’
‘Oh, still pretty much the same,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Still up one day and down the next.
Now that Grandmother and your mother are away, those senior women are getting
quite out of hand, fighting or quarrelling about something or other every day. We’ve
even had cases of gambling and thieving recently. Of course, your sister is a great
help; but she’s a young unmarried girl and there are certain things she can’t be told
about. When they crop up, I have to struggle out of bed and deal with them myself.
So I don’t really get a lot of rest. Under the circumstances there’s not much prospect
yet of getting better: all I can hope is that I shan’t get any worse!’
‘I know. But you’ve got to look after yourself,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You must try not to
worry so much.’
He chatted with her a little longer before going back into the Garden. Arriving at the
Naiad’s House, he could see the remains of incense smoke as he entered the
courtyard gate. In the outer room there was a wet patch on the flagstones where a
libation had been poured, and Nightingale was super?vising the removal of the
qin-table to the inside room and the replacement of various other objects and bits of
furniture. Concluding that the little service (if that is what it had been) must just be
over, he went inside. Dai-yu was lying down with her face to the wall. She looked ill
and exhausted. At the sound of Nightingale’s ‘Master Bao, Miss’, she raised herself
wearily, though with a smiling face, and invited him to sit by her.
      ‘How have you been these last few days, coz?’ he said. ‘You look a bit calmer
than you did, but something seems to have been upsetting you.’
‘I can’t imagine why you should say so,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I am perfectly all right.’
‘How can you expect me to believe that?’ said Bao-yu. ‘The tears are still wet on
your face. You should learn to take things a bit easier. It is bad for a person who has
so much illness to be constantly indulging in grief. If you end up by undermiring your
health; I-’
     The realization that what he was about to say was probably something that
ought not to be said caused the words to stick in his throat. For although, from the
fact that he and Dai-yu had grown up together, there existed a most perfect
sympathy between them, although there was nothing in the world that either of
them wanted more than to live and die in each other’s company, the understanding
that this was so was a wordless one which had never been expressed. In the past,
because Dai-yu was so sensitive, words had all too often proved a stumbling-block.
And now today, when the whole point of his coming here was to comfort her, here he
was again, on the point of saying something that would offend her! Finding that he
could not go on, a sort of panic gripped him. He feared he was going to make her
angry; and yet he so desperately wanted to help her. As he thought about it, the
panic gave way to a feeling of helpless sadness and he began to cry.
Dai-yu, sensing that he was about to make one of those extravagant statements that
she always found so irritating, had indeed been on the point of getting angry; but
when she saw his internal struggle and the tears which followed it, she felt not angry
with him but moved, and being herself of a tearful disposition, was soon sitting there
in silence and weeping with him for company. To Nightingale, who came in at that
moment with some tea, it appeared as if they must have been having a quarrel.
      ‘Just when Miss Lin is getting along nicely,’ she said to Bao-?yu with some
asperity, ‘what do you mean by coming along here and upsetting her?’
      Bao-yu laughed and wiped his eyes.
      ‘I’ve done no such thing.’
      To cover up his embarrassment, he got up and began pacing about the room. In
doing so, he caught sight of a sheet of paper sticking out from underneath Dai-yu’s
inkstone. The temptation to reach out and pick it up proved irresistible, and before
Dai-yu could get up and snatch it from him, he had put it in the bosom of his gown.
     ‘Let me read it, Dai!’
     ‘Whatever you come here about,’ said Dai-yu, ‘you always seem to end up by
nosing through my papers.’
     Bao-chai came in while she was speaking.
     ‘What is it you want to read, cousin?’ she asked Bao-yu.
     Bao-yu still had no idea what the piece of paper contained, and because he was
uncertain what Dai-yu’s feelings would be about his reading it, he hesitated to
answer Bao-chai’s question for fear of giving Dai-yu offence. He therefore smiled and
said nothing, while all the time his eyes rested on Dai-yu questioningly. Dai-yu smiled
at Bao-chai and invited her to be seated.
‘I’ve been looking at some lives of famous women,’ said Dai-yu, ‘all of them women
who are famous in history for their beauty or intelligence. There was so much I found
moving - heartening and admirable in some cases, tragic and deplorable in others -
that after lunch today, having nothing better to do, I decided to make a selection of
them and try writing poems about them in which some of those feelings could be
expressed. Then Tan-chun came in and asked me to go with her to see Cousin Feng,
but I didn’t feel up to it. After doing only five of the poems I had planned, I suddenly
felt too tired to go on and left them lying there on the table, little thinking that
Master Bao would come along and dis?cover them. I wouldn’t really mind his seeing
them if it weren’t for the fear that he might go copying them out and showing them
to other people.’
‘When did I ever do such a thing?’ said Bao-yu indignantly. ‘If you’re referring to the
White Crab-flower poems on that fan, I wrote them on it myself in small kai-shu
characters merely for the convenience of always having them by me when I wanted
to look at them. I fully realize that poems written in the privacy of the women’s
quarters are not lightly to be passed around outside. Ever since you spoke to me
about it, I have been careful not to carry that fan with me anywhere but inside the
Garden.’
‘Cousin Lin is right to be worried,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Now that the poems are written
on that fan, there is always the possibility that you might one day forget and carry it
with you to your room outside. Suppose Uncle’s literary gentlemen were to see it
there, they would be sure to ask you who the poems were by. If as a result of that
they were to become public property, it would be extremely unpleasant for us. “A
stupid woman is a virtuous one”: that is what the old proverb says. A girl’s first
concern is to be virtuous, her second is to be industrious. She may write poetry if she
likes as a diversion, but it is an accomplishment she could just as well do without. The
last thing girls of good family need is a literary reputation.’ She paused and gave
Dai-yu a smile. ‘There would be no harm in letting me see them of course. The
important thing is not to allow Cousin Bao to go off with them.’
‘In the light of what you have just been saying,’ said Dai-yu drily, ‘I’m not at all sure
that I ought to let you look at them either. Anyway,’ she pointed to Bao-yu, ‘he’s
already got them.’
Bao-yu assumed from her tone that he might read them. Extracting the paper from
the inside pocket of his gown, he drew up close to Bao-chai so that the two of them
could peruse it together. This is what they read.
Xi Shi
That kingdom-quelling beauty dissolved like the flower of foam.
In the foreign palace, Xi Shi, did you yearn for your old home?
Who laughs at your ugly neighbour with her frown-and-simper now,
Still steeping her yam at the brook-side, and the hair snow-white on her brow?
*
Yu Ji
The very crows are grieving as they caw in the cold night air.
She faces her beaten Tyrant King with a haggard look of despair:
‘Let the others wait for the hangman, to be hacked and quartered and rent;
‘Better the taste of one’s own steel in the decent dark of a tent.’
*
Lady Bright
To a loveliness that dazzled, the palace of Han showed the door;
For ‘the fair are mostly ill-fated’, as has been said often before.
Yet it seems strange that an emperor - even one with such tepid views –
Should abandon his eyes’ own judgement and let a painter choose!
*
Green Pearl
Pebble or pearl - to Shi Chong it was only a rich man’s whim:
Do you really believe your undoubted charms meant so very much to him?
It was fate, from some past life preordained, that made him take his rash stand,
And the craving to have a companion in death’s dark, silent land.
*
Red Duster
She marked the firm, courteous protest, the well-phrased confident plan,
And, under the unsuccessful clerk, saw the essential Man.
The great Yang Su in her eyes was finished from that hour:
He could not hold a girl like her for all his pomp and power.
*
After praising the poems enthusiastically, Bao-yu suggested that, as there were five
of them, a good collective title would be ‘Songs for Five Fair Women’; and without
waiting for Dai-yu’s approval, he picked up her writing-brush and wrote it on the
left-hand side of the sheet after the poems.
‘Whatever subject one chooses for a poem,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it is important that
one’s treatment of it should be original. If one merely plods along in the footsteps of
earlier poets, it doesn’t matter how fine the language is, the lack of originality will
prevent it from being a really good poem. Thus, many poets have taken Lady Bright
as their theme, but the best ones have always contrived to give the subject a new
turn, one emphasizing the sad fate of Lady Bright herself, another the wickedness of
the painter Ma Yan-shou, another the frivolousness of the Han emperor who
employed him to paint portraits of court ladies rather than portraits of distinguished
statesmen and soldiers, and so on. Further new twists were given to this theme by
Wang An-shi:
What brush could ever capture a beauty’s breathing grace?
The painter did not merit death who botched that lovely face.
and by Ou-yang Xiu:
A prince so ill able to control what went on under his nose
Must hope in vain to impose his rule on remote barbarian foes.
Cousin Lin shows the same originality as these two poets, by presenting each of her
subjects in a novel and interesting light -’
Before she could continue with her disquisition, a servant came in to announce that
Jia Lian was back. His arrival at the Ning mansion had been reported some time ago
and he was expected any moment at Rong-guo House. Bao-yu at once got up and,
hurrying out to the front part of the mansion, waited inside the main gate for his
cousin to arrive. He did not have to wait long. Within moments Jia Lian was
dis?mounting from his horse and stepping through the gateway. Bao-yu advanced to
meet him, touched hand and knee to the ground in greeting, and wished good health,
first, as was good manners, to his grandmother and mother, from whom Jia Lian had
come, and then to Jia Lian himself. The cousins then went inside together, hand in
hand. Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao?-chai, Dai-yu, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun were
already waiting for Jia Lian in the hall. After each of them had greeted him
individually, he gave them his news.
‘Grandmother will be arriving here early tomorrow. She’s been keeping very well
on the journey. Today she sent me on ahead to make sure that everything here is all
right. I shall be leaving again tomorrow at four o’clock in the morning and going out
of the city to meet her.’
They asked him a few questions about the journey, but because they knew how tired
he must be after so much travel, soon left him so that he could go back to his own
room and get some rest. About the remainder of that day our narrative is silent.
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang arrived home round about lunchtime the following
day. When the initial greetings were over, the old lady sat for a while and sipped a
cup of tea before taking Lady Wang and the others with her to Ning-guo House. A
great wailing rose up as she arrived. Jia She and Jia Lian had gone there after seeing
the old lady home, and as she and her party entered the room in which the coffin
stood, the two of them advanced to meet her at the head of a number of weeping
clansmen, and supported her one on each side as she ap?proached the coffin. At the
foot of it Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong knelt down, pressing their heads against her skirts
and weeping piteously. To people of advancing years even simulated grief is
distressing, and Grandmother Jia, an arm about each head, wept very bitterly herself,
Jia She and Jia Lian did their best to comfort her, and at last, when her grief had
some?what abated, she moved on, to the right of the coffin-screens, where You-shi
and her daughter-in-law were waiting for her. Here there was more clinging and
weeping, after which those present came forward one by one to salute Grandmother
Jia and welcome her in a more normal fashion.
Cousin Zhen, fearing that Grandmother Jia, who had still not rested properly after her
tiring journey, would become distressed if she were to sit much longer in such
melancholy surroundings, strongly urged her not to stay. When at last he had
prevailed on her to go and she was back in her own apartment at Rong-guo House, it
became evident that the shock of mourning, following so soon upon the discomforts
of travel, had indeed had an adverse effect on her ageing con?stitution. By nightfall
she was showing all the symptoms of incipient illness: heaviness in the head, a
constricted feeling in the chest, a blocked-up nose and hoarseness of the voice. The
doctor was summoned immediately and half that night and the whole of the
following day taken up with consulta?tions, prescriptions and the preparation and
administering of medicine. Fortunately the illness had not yet established itself in her
system and responded rapidly to treatment. There was a slight outbreak of
perspiration round about midnight of the second night and after that her pulse and
temperature both returned to normal. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief; though to
be on the safe side they kept up the dosage for another day.
A few days later it was Jia Jing's 'funeral' - in this case no more than the re-depositing
of his coffin in the family temple. Grandmother Jia was still not well enough to take
part; Bao-yu stayed at home to look after his grandmother; and Xi-?feng was still
insufficiently recovered. Apart from them, all the other members of the Rong-guo
family, Jia She, Jia Lian, Lady Xing and Lady Wang, together with all the men- and
women-servants of their households, accompanied their Ning?-guo cousins to the
Temple of the Iron Threshold. They were back again that evening; but Cousin Zhen,
You-shi and Jia Rong stayed on at the temple for the Hundred Days, at the end of
which Jia Jing was to be taken to his final resting-place in Nanking. Old Mrs You and
her two daughters remained all this while at the Ning-guo mansion to keep an eye on
things.
Jia Lian had heard a good deal in the past about these two step-sisters of You-shi,
though, to his great regret, he had never until very recently had an opportunity of
meeting them. The opportunity had presented itself on the occasion of Jia Jing's
removal into the city. Since then they had become fairly well acquainted.
Acquaintanceship in his case (Jia Lian being what he was) had been accompanied by
the first stirrings of lust. He felt encouraged by an unsavoury rumour he had heard to
the effect that his cousins Zhen and Rong, both father and son, had at one time or
another enjoyed the sisters' favours. Whenever he had a chance to, he flirted or
made eyes at them - unsuccessfully in San-jie's case, for she met all his advances with
indifference, but with a more promising reaction from her sister. Unfortunately, with
so many pairs of eyes watching, he could not follow up his success, apart from which
he was a little scared that Cousin Zhen might be jealous. Between him and Er-jie it
could be said that there was a silent understanding; but for the time being there
could be nothing more.
This all changed after the funeral. Then, at Ning-guo House, apart from Mrs You and
the two sisters and a few maids and older women employed to do the rough work,
hardly anyone from the master apartment was left behind. All the personal maids,
parlour maids and concubines stayed with their master and mistress at the temple.
As for the married servants, their activities were confined to keeping watch at night
and minding the gates by day; and since they had their own quarters outside, they
had no reason to go inside the house except when they were on duty. This seemed to
Jia Lian to be an excellent time to act. A pretended wish to keep Cousin Zhen
company at the temple gave him an excuse for absenting himself fr6m his own house,
whilst the pretext of attending to household matters on Cousin Zhen's behalf
enabled him to make several trips back to Ning-guo House, thus providing him with
further opportunities for pursuing his flirtation with Er-jie.
One day Yu Lu, a junior steward from Ning-guo House, came out to see Cousin Zhen
about some business.
‘The total cost of the procession, including funeral furnishings and hire of labour,
was one thousand one hundred and ten taels. Of that, five hundred taels have
already been paid, leaving six hundred and ten taels outstanding. Yesterday I had the
managers of both agencies round asking me for the rest of the money. I thought I’d
better see you about it and ask you what I’m to do.’
‘Why didn’t you go straight to the counting-house and draw what’s wanted?’ said
Cousin Zhen. ‘I don’t see why you should need to come bothering me about it.,
‘I did go to the counting-house, sir,’ said Yu Lu, ‘but since Sir Jing passed away they
have already paid out so much that they’ve barely got enough left to pay for the
Hundred Days services and the expenses of your stay here in the temple. They
couldn’t pay these bills without eating into what has been earmarked for something
else. That’s why I’ve come out to see you. I wondered whether you would want me
to pay them out of your personal account, or whether there’s some other account
you could transfer the money from. If you will let me know what you want me to do,
I’ll go ahead and do it.’
Cousin Zhen laughed.
‘The days when we had money lying around unused in private accounts have long
since passed. You’ll have to borrow the money where you can.’
It was Yu Lu’s turn to laugh.
‘If it were one hundred or two hundred taels, sir, I might be able to manage
something; but five or six hundred? Where would I get a sum like that at short
notice?’
After thinking for a bit, Cousin Zhen turned to Jia Rong:
‘Go to your mother, Rong, and ask her for that five hundred taels the Zhens of
Nanking sent us after the funeral. It hasn’t been handed in to the counting-house yet.
And ask her to have a rake-around and see if she can’t raise the whole sum.’
Jia Rong hurried off. In a very short time he was back again with his mother’s answer.
‘Mother says two hundred of the five hundred has already been spent. She sent the
remaining three hundred back home for Grandmother You to take care of.’
‘In that case,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘you’d better go back with Yu Lu to ask her for it
and let him have it. While you’re about it, you’ll be able to see if everything at home
is all right. And of course give my regards to your aunts. Yu Lu, you’ll have to raise the
rest of the money as best you can by borrowing.’
Jia Rong and Yu Lu promised to do his bidding, but just as they were about to
withdraw Jia Lian walked into the room. Yu Lu stepped up to him smartly and
dropped him a salute.
‘What’s happened?’ said Jia Lian.
Cousin Zhen proceeded to explain to him why Yu Lu was there. As he did so, it
occurred to Jia Lian that this would be a good opportunity of going to the Ning-guo
mansion and looking up Er-jie again.
‘It seems a pity to go straining one’s credit for so trifling a sum,’ he said. ‘I had a
little windfall the other day that I haven’t made use of yet. Why don’t I let him have
that to add to your three hundred and save him the trouble of borrow?ing?’
‘That will be splendid,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Perhaps you will authorize Rong to pick it
up then, when he goes to collect the three hundred?’
‘I think it will be necessary to go for it myself,’ said Jia Lian hurriedly. ‘In any case I
haven’t been home for some days. I really ought to drop in and pay my respects to
Grandmother and Lady Wang and my parents. I shall be able to look in at your place
too, Zhen, and make sure that your servants are behaving themselves. And pay my
respects to your mother?-in-law, of course.’
‘It means imposing on you once again,’ said Cousin Then, smiling. ‘I don’t know
whether I should let you.’
‘For goodness’ sake!’ said Jia Lian. ‘One’s own cousin!’
‘Go with your uncle, then,’ Cousin Zhen instructed Jia Rong, ‘and when you see
Lady Jia and the other ladies and Sir She to make your bow to them, remember to say
that your mother and I send them our regards. And don’t forget to ask whether Lady
Jia is quite better yet and whether or not she is still taking medicine.’
Having ‘yessir’-ed each one of these commands, Jia Rong followed his Uncle Lian
outside. The two of them then took horse and, accompanied by Yu Lu and several
pages, all on horseback, rode out towards the city. As Er-lie was very much on his
mind, Jia Lian beguiled the journey by talking to his nephew about her as they rode
along. He spoke approvingly of her good looks and gentle character. He remarked
what perfect poise she had and what a soft and pleasing way of speaking. In fact, he
concluded, everything about her excited one’s admiration and respect.
‘Everyone speaks so highly of your Aunt Feng, but to my mind she isn’t a patch on
her.’
Jia Rong understood very well where this conversation was leading them.
      ‘If you love her so much, Uncle,’ he said, ‘why not let me he your matchmaker
and arrange for you to have her as your Number Two?’
      ‘Is that a joke,’ said Jia Lian, ‘or are you in earnest?’
‘I’m being perfectly serious.’
Jia Lian laughed:
‘It’s certainly an attractive proposal. The only trouble is, I don’t think your Aunt
Feng would ever stand for it. And besides, your Grandmother You might not be
willing. And haven’t I heard somewhere that your Aunt Er is already engaged to
someone?’
‘None of these is really a problem,’ said Jia Rong. ‘Aunt Er and Aunt San, although
they took his surname, were not really my Grandpa You’s daughters. When Gran
married my Grandpa You as his second wife, she brought them with her from a
previous marriage. I’ve heard Gran say that when she was carrying Aunt Er, her first
husband had an agreement with a friend of his called Zhang, who was a manager on
one of the Imperial Farms and whose own wife was also pregnant at the time. They
agreed that if the children their wives were carrying turned out to be a boy and a girl,
they should be betrothed to each other. In that way Aunt Er was engaged to the
Zhangs’ boy from the moment she was born. Later on the Zhangs lost all their money
in a lawsuit, and Gran lost her first husband and married my Grandpa You, and for
ten or fifteen years now she hasn’t heard a word from them. She often com?plains
about the betrothal and says she wishes she could get it revoked; and Father is
anxious to betroth Aunt Er to some?one else. He’s only waiting until he has found the
right person, and then he means to find out where the Zhangs are, hand them a
small sum of money, and persuade them to sign a deed of revocation. The Zhangs are
so poor, they are hardly likely to refuse. In fact, when they’ve seen the kind of people
we are, they probably won’t dare. And whatever Father and Gran might have thought
about Aunt Er becoming a Number Two in other circumstances, I’m sure they would
have no objection in your case. The only difficulty as I see it is Aunt Feng.’
Jia Lian was so enraptured by the main part of what Jia Rong had been saying, that it
is doubtful whether he heard those last words at all. For some moments he rode on
in silence, a fatuous grin on his face. Meanwhile Jia Rong was thinking.
‘I’ll tell you what, Uncle,’ he said presently: ‘if you’ve got the nerve, there’s one way
of doing this that would be absolutely fool-proof. It would involve you in spending a
bit of money though.’
‘Never mind that, dear boy!’ said Jia Lian eagerly. ‘If you have a plan, just tell me
what it is.’
‘Don’t say anything about this when we arrive,’ said Jia Rong, ‘but wait until I have
had a chance to explain it all to Father and he can arrange it with my Gran. When it’s
all settled, buy a little house somewhere in the streets at the back of our mansion,
furnish it, install one or two married couples to look after it, and then all you have to
do is choose the day: you can marry Aunt Er then and nobody be any the wiser. Of
course, you’d have to impress on the servants that they are not to let on about it; but
provided they don’t talk, there’s no reason why Aunt Feng tucked away in the inner
courtyards should ever hear about it. And by the time you’ve been living together for
a year or two, you ought to be able to ride the storm out even if your secret is blown.
You’d have to face an explosion from Sir She, of course; but you can tell him that you
did it for the family, because Aunt Feng is unable to have a son. And as for Aunt Feng
herself, when she sees that the rice is cooked and knows that it can’t be uncooked,
she’ll have to put up with it. That only leaves the old lady to square, and you should
be able to do that easily enough with a bit of coaxing.’
There is an old saying, ‘Desire maketh the wise man a fool’. Jia Lian was so intoxicated
by his desire for Er-jie that Jia Rong’s idiotic plan struck him as unassailable. The fact
that he was in mourning, the fact that a secret marriage of the kind he was
contemplating was bigamous and illegal, the fact that he had an extremely strict
father and an exceptionally jealous wife - all those things which ought to have given
him pause were lightly brushed aside. Nor did it occur to him that Jia Rong’s counsel
was by no means disinterested. Jia Rong had designs upon Er-jie himself, to which the
presence of his father, when they were all together in the same house; was an
impediment. If Jia Lian married Er-jie, she would have to live outside, and there
would be unlimited opportunities for larks with her whenever Jia Lian was away.
Blind to all this, Jia Lian thanked Jia Rong profusely and promised him a suitable
reward.
       ‘If you can really arrange this for me, dear boy, I’ll buy you a pair of the prettiest
little girls who are to be had and make you a present of them!’
       They were by now approaching the gates of Ning-guo House.
       ‘You go in here and ask my Gran for the money to give to Yu Lu, Uncle. I’m going
on to the other House to pay my respects to the old lady.’
Jia Lian smiled and nodded.
‘When you see her, don’t let on that I came here with you, will you?’
‘All right,’ said Jia Rong; then, leaning over, he added in a low voice in his uncle’s ear:
‘If you should happen to see Aunt Er today, don’t let impatience get the better of you!
A scandal now will make it harder to arrange things later.’
‘Cheeky devil!’ said Jia Lian laughing. ‘Go on, be on your way now! I’ll be waiting for
you here.
While Jia Rong went on to the Rong mansion alone, Jia Lian turned into the gateway
of Ning-guo House. The men-servants temporarily in charge there were waiting
inside the gate to welcome him, with the other servants all lined up behind them.
They clustered round him as he made his way up to the hall. There, for form’s sake,
he asked them a few per?functory questions before dismissing them and continuing
on his way to the inner apartments.
As cousins and intimates having no secrets from one another, Cousin Zhen and Jia
Lian had always felt free to come and go in each other’s apartments without
formality, and so, when Jia Lian approached the main sitting-room of Cousin Zhen’s
apartment, the old women at the door simply raised the portiere for him and let him
go in unannounced.
Looking round him as he entered, Jia Lian saw only Er-?jie and a couple of maids
sewing together on the kang at the southern end of the room. The mother and the
other sister were not in evidence. He went up and greeted her. In response to her
smiling invitation to join her, he climbed up and sat with his back resting against the
openwork partition along the eastern side of the kang, insisting that Er-jie should
take the place of honour. After a few generalities, he asked her where Mrs You and
San-jie were.


‘Just gone out the back to see about something,’ said Er-jie. ‘They’ll be here again
in a moment.’
The maids now went outside to fetch tea, leaving the two of them alone together. Jia
Lian ogled Er-jie meaningfully, but she merely smiled, keeping her eyes demurely
downwards, and pretended not to notice. At this stage, he judged; a physical advance
would be premature. He noticed that as she sat there her hands were continuously
playing with a length of silk handkerchief to which a tiny embroidered bag was
attached. To fill in the embarrassed silence that was developing, he pretended to be
feeling for something at his waist.
‘Oh, I’ve come out without my betel! Give me some betel, my dear, if you’ve got
any.’
‘I have got some,’ said Er-jie, ‘but it’s not for other people.’
Jia Lian laughed and made a movement towards her, as if he intended to snatch the
handkerchief and its little pouch from her by force, whereupon Er-jie, rather than risk
someone coming in and finding them in the midst of an unseemly tussle, threw it
across to him with a little laugh. Jia Lian caught it in mid-air, emptied the contents
into the palm of his hand, selected one single half-eaten nut which he popped into
his mouth and began chewing, and stuffed all the rest back into the bag. He was just
going to hand it back to her when the two maids came in again with the tea. Jia Lian
took a cup from one of them and began sipping it. While the maids were not looking,
he contrived to unfasten a Han jade girdle pend?ant in the form of nine tiny
interlocking dragons that he wore attached to his belt, tie it onto the handkerchief
and toss it back for Er-jie to catch. But Er-jie pretended not to have noticed. She
allowed the handkerchief with the two small objects attached to it to fall beside her
on the kang and went on calmly sipping her tea.
Just then there was a rattle of the portiere and old Mrs You and San-jie came into the
room from the back, attended by two little maids. Jia Lian signalled with his eyes to
Er-jie that she should pick the handkerchief up, but Er-jie continued to ignore him. In
somewhat of a panic by now and wondering what Er-jie could be at, he rose to his
feet arid advanced to meet San-jie and the old lady. When, after exchanging
courtesies with them, he glanced back behind him, Er-jie was stand?ing
unconcernedly in the same place, with the same inscrut?able smile on her face; but
the handkerchief had vanished. He breathed a sigh of relief.
      When they were all seated and a few pleasantries had been exchanged between
them, Jia Lian remembered the business on which he was supposed to have come.
      ‘Zhen’s wife says that she sent a packet of silver to you the other day to look
after for her. It’s wanted now to pay some bills with, so Zhen has sent me to ask you
for it and also to find out if everything at home is all right.’
      Mrs You at once told Er-jie to take the key of the chest and fetch the money for
her.
‘I’m also glad of the opportunity my errand gives me of offering you my respects,
ma’am, and of seeing the young ladies again,’ Jia Lian continued after Er-jie had gone.
‘I must say, you are looking extremely well. But I am sorry the young ladies should
have to put up with the inconvenience of moving into a strange house.’
‘Tut, for one’s own kin!’ said Mrs You, smiling. ‘You are too polite, Mr Lian! It’s of no
consequence where we stay: one bed is as good as another. To tell you the truth,
things have been very difficult for us since Mr You passed away. If it hadn’t been for
the help given us by my daughter’s husband, I really don’t know how we should have
managed. To look after the house for him in his time of trouble is the very least we
can do in return. It can certainly not be spoken of as an incon?venience.’
     Er-jie had now returned with the silver and handed it to her mother; her mother
handed it to Jia Lian; and Jia Lian ordered one of the maids to call in one of the old
women from outside, whom he then instructed to take it to Yu Lu and tell him to wait
for him in the front.
While the old woman was going off with the money, Jia Rong’s voice could be heard
outside in the courtyard and a few moments later he appeared. He greeted his
grandmother and two aunts before turning with a smile to Jia Lian:
‘Sir She has been asking about you, Uncle. He says there’s something he wants you
to do for him. He was going to send someone to fetch you from the temple, but I told
him you were already on your way into the city. He told me that if I ran into you on
my way back, I was to tell you to hurry.’
Jia Lian hastily rose to go, but delayed to hear something that Jia Rong was saying to
Mrs You.
‘You know the other day I was telling you that Father has found a husband for Aunt
Er, Gran. In looks and build he has quite a strong resemblance to Uncle Lian. Does
that please you?’
Since he was pointing a finger at Jia Lian and simultaneously making a face at Er-jie
while he said this, the question appeared to be meant as much for Er-jie as for her
mother. If so, Er?-jie was too embarrassed to answer. Not so her sister, however.
‘Little monster!’ San-jie shouted, half angrily and half in jest. ‘Keep your dirty little
mouth shut - unless you want me to come over and shut it for you!’
Jia Rong retreated, laughing, from the room; and Jia Lian, taking a laughing farewell
of the old lady and her daughters, went out after him. He stopped in the hall again on
his way out to admonish the servants: not to gamble, not to drink, and so forth. Then,
after a private aside with Jia Rong in which he urged him to return with all speed to
the temple and speak about a certain matter to his father, he went with Yu Lu to the
other mansion and gave him the balance of the amount owing. Having dispatched Yu
Lu, he went in to see what his father wanted, and after that to Grandmother Jia’s
apartment to pay his respects. But these are formalities with which we need not
concern ourselves.
We return, then, to the Ning-guo mansion, where Jia Rong, concluding, when he saw
Yu Lu go off with Jia Lian, that there was nothing more for him to do, went back to
the inner apartments for further badinage with his young aunts before setting off
once more for the temple. It was evening when he arrived there and reported back
to his father.
‘Yu Lu got the money all right. And Lady Jia is now completely recovered. She is no
longer taking medicine.’
He availed himself of the opportunity to tell his father about Jia Lian: how, on the
journey into town, he had expressed a desire to take Er-jie as his Number Two and
how he proposed to set her up in a separate establishment, keeping Xi-feng in
ignorance of the marriage.
‘His sole reason for taking a Number Two,’ Jia Rong explained, ‘is that he wants a
son. And the reason he particularly wants Aunt Er is because he feels it would be
better to keep things in the family and have someone he knows, than risk taking
some unknown person from outside. He was very insistent that I should speak to you
about this.’
He omitted to mention that he was the author of this plan.
Cousin Zhen, after reflecting on it, seemed well disposed.
‘Actually, it’s not a bad idea. I wonder whether your Aunt Er would be willing,
though. You’d better go in again tomorrow and have a word with your Grandmother
You. Tell her to talk to your Aunt Er about it and see if she accepts. If she does, we
can go ahead and fix it up properly.’
After a good deal more advice to Jia Rong on how he was to conduct himself, Cousin
Zhen went inside to see You-shi and told her about the plan. You-shi could see at
once that it would not work and did her best to dissuade him; but Cousin Zben’s
mind was made up; and in the end, since she was accustomed to giving in to him,
and since Er-jie was in any case only a step-sister, for whom therefore she felt only
limited responsi?bility, she allowed the menfolk to go ahead and washed her hands
of the whole affair.
Jia Rong went into town next morning and told his grandmother what his father had
told him to say. He also added a good deal of his own. He told her what a capital
person Jia Lian was; how Xi-feng was ill and not expected to get better; how Jia Lian
was planning to buy a house outside and install Er-jie in it temporarily, but how in a
year or two, as soon as Xi-feng was dead, he would move her inside and make her his
Number One. He went on to tell her about the gifts Cousin Zhen would give for the
betrothal and of the wedding presents that Jia Lian was planning for his bride; how
Jia Lian was prepared to look after Mrs You in her old age; and how in due course he
would see San-jie provided with a husband. The Liang dynasty preacher on whom the
heavens rained down flowers could not have spoken with greater eloquence. Mrs You
could hardly fail to agree, particularly in view of the fact that she depended on
Cousin Zhen for her livelihood and that it was he who was sponsoring the marriage.
And Jia Lian was such a fine young gentleman - infinitely superior to that Zhang boy.
She would go to Er-jie at once and talk it over with her.
You Er-jie was a highly impressionable young woman. Already, in the past, she had
compromised herself with her sister’s husband. And she had always resented the
arbitrary betrothal to Zhang Hua (as the Zhangs’ boy was called) which seemed to
condemn her to a lifetime of poverty. If Jia Lian loved her and her brother-in-law was
prepared to give her away, what possible objection could she have to the marriage?
Her consent was given with a nod, conveyed at once to Jia Rong by her mother, and
in due course reported to Cousin Zhen.
Next day Cousin Zhen invited Jia Lian to the temple to hear from his own lips that
Mrs You had consented. Jia Lian, delighted that the matter had been settled with so
little trouble, at once began discussing what to do. Agents had to be engaged to look
round for a suitable house, jewellery for Er-jie’s trousseau had to be ordered, and
furnishings had to be pur?chased for the house. Within a few days all this had been
done. A twenty-frame house in Little Flower Lane about two thirds of a mile north of
Two Dukes Street had been bought, fur?nished throughout, and two little maids
purchased to go with it.
Jia Lian was at first uncertain what to do about older servants. If he used servants
from his own household, their transfer was sure to be detected; on the other hand a
married couple purchased from outside would be strangers, and therefore of
uncertain loyalty and impossible to trust. Suddenly he remembered Bao Er, whose
unfortunate wife had hanged herself after being attacked by Xi-feng in a fit of jealous
rage. At the time Jia Lian had given him some money and promised him a new wife.
The wife he had eventually chosen for him was none other than the Mattress,
widowed since the drunken cook ‘Droopy’ Duo had finally drunk himself to death.
Bao Er had had prior experience of her charms and knew that he was getting a good
bargain; and the Mattress for her part was glad to be married to someone who
(thanks to Jia Lian’s subvention) could afford to be free with his money. This couple,
united in their loyalty to Jia Lian and dislike of Xi-feng, seemed an ideal choice for the
new establishment and were to their immense satisfaction installed in it, along with
the newly-?purchased maids, to be at Er-jie’s disposal when she arrived.
There remained only the matter of Zhang Hua to be dealt with. It was Zhang Hua’s
grandfather who had originally held the managerial post on one of the Imperial
Farms. His father simply inherited the post when the old man died. While holding it,
he had made the arrangement with Mrs You’s first husband, who was his good friend,
as a result of which Zhang Hua and Er-jie were engaged to each other from their
earliest infancy. Some time after that he lost all his possessions in a lawsuit and the
family were reduced to penury so dire that even food and clothing were a problem,
and taking on a new daughter-in-law was, for the time being, wholly out of the
question. Then Er-jie’s mother had remarried, and for fourteen years or more they
had been completely out of touch. Their whereabouts were eventually traced,
however, and Zhang Hua’s father summoned to Ning-guo House and induced to sign
a deed of revocation releasing Er-jie from her betrothal. He did not want to sign it,
but was too intimidated by Cousin Zhen’s air of affluence and authority to object.
After he had signed, Mrs You handed him twenty taels, and that was that.
Everything had now been taken care of. All that remained was for Jia Lian to name
the day. The calendar was consulted and the third of the sixth month, which was just
beginning, was found to be the earliest auspicious day. On that day, it was decided,
Er-jie should be received as a bride in her new home.
But for that event you must await the following chapter.
CHAPTER 65

Jia Lian’s second marriage is
celebrated in secret
And the future marriage of San-jie
becomes a matter of speculation



By the second day of the month, the arrangements jointly agreed on by Jia Lian,
Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong had been completed and Mrs You and San-jie moved into
the new house. A brief inspection of it satisfied Mrs You that, if not quite what Jia
Rong had led her to expect, it was at least excellently furnished, and it could be said
that both she and San-jie were reasonably happy about the move. Bao Er and his
wife could not do enough for them. It was ‘yes, milady’, ‘no, milady’ whenever they
were talking to Mrs You; and San-jie, for the first time in her life, found herself being
addressed as ‘Miss You’, or sometimes even as ‘madam’.
In the last watch of that same night, only an hour or two before the dawning of the
third, Er-jie, seated in a plain chair without bridal trimmings, was carried to her new
home. The incense and paper-offerings for the ceremony, the wedding-feast and
marriage-bed had all been made ready long before she arrived. Jia Lian, also in a
small, plain carrying-chair, arrived shortly afterwards. The bride and groom made
their prostrations to Heaven and Earth, the paper offerings were set fire to, and Mrs
You conducted her heavily-veiled daughter into the marriage-chamber, gratified to
observe the transformation wrought by a completely new and expensive-looking
outfit of clothes and jewellery.
The phoenix-gambollings of the nuptial couch and the mutual delight and cherishing
which they engendered are here passed over. Suffice it to say that the more Jia Lian
saw of Er-jie, the more he loved her, until the desire to make some gesture expressive
of his feelings became overwhelming. All he could think of was to behave in every
way as if Er-jie was his only wife and Xi-feng did not exist. He ordered Bao Er and his
wife to call her ‘Mrs Lian’ and always referred to her himself in that way when he was
speaking to them. When he went back to Xi-feng, as from time to time he was
obliged to, he would tell her that he had been doing something at the Ning-guo
mansion; and Xi-feng, knowing how well her husband got on with Cousin Zhen and
how frequently he was consulted by him, suspected nothing. In spite of their
num?bers, few of the Rong-guo domestics concerned themselves much with Jia
Lian’s activities, and even the few who had the time and curiosity to nose out what
he had been up to were more anxious to win favours by playing up to him than to
gamble on the uncertain advantages of giving away his secret. Everything seemed to
be working out very smoothly and Jia Lian felt immensely grateful to Cousin Zhen for
having made it all possible.
The allowance Jia Lian made to cover the day-to-day expenses of his little household
was fifteen taels a month. On days when he was unable to come, Mrs You and her
two daughters dined together. On days when he was there, he and Er-jie would dine
together and Mrs You and San-jie would eat separately in their own room. Besides
paying Er-jie the allowance, Jia Lian handed over all his private savings to her to look
after for him. He told her everything about Xi-?feng, down to the most intimate
bedroom particulars, and promised her that as soon as Xi-feng died, she should move
into the mansion and live there openly as his wife. It cannot be said that Er-jie found
any of this displeasing. In the meantime the little household was managing very
comfortably.
*
Two months passed quickly by. One evening, as Cousin Zhen was returning from a
day of Buddhist ceremonies at the Temple of the Iron Threshold, he bethought him
that it was some considerable time since he had enjoyed the company of the two You
sisters and decided to pay them a visit. First, though, he sent a boy to the new house
to find out if Jia Lian was there. Delighted when the boy brought back word that he
was not, he ordered most of the servants to return to Ning-guo House without him,
keeping only his two most trusted pages to accompany him on foot to the Yous’
house. They did this walking one on either side of his horse’s head and holding on to
his bridle.
It was already lighting-up time when they got there, but the courtyard gate was still
open. Their arrival was so quiet and discreet that they managed to get inside it
unobserved. The pages tied the horse up in the stable and took themselves off to the
servants’ quarters to await further orders, while Cousin Zhen entered the living-room
alone. He found San-jie and her mother sitting there. The lamp had just been lit.
Shortly after he had finished exchanging greetings with them, Er-jie herself appeared
and made him welcome. Tea was served. Cousin Zhen smiled over his cup at her as
he sipped his tea.
‘Well, do you think I’d make a good marriage-broker? If the husband I picked for
you is no good, I doubt I could find you a better! Your sister will be coming to see you
shortly, by the bye, and bringing you a present.’
Er-jie had already given orders for food and wine to be brought and for the courtyard
gate to be barred. Since their visitor was a member of the family, it seemed
reasonable, that the usual restraints should be relaxed. Presently Bao Er came in with
some things and took the opportunity of offering his respects to Cousin Zhen.
‘You’re a good fellow, Bao,’ said Cousin Zhen affably. ‘I’m sure that’s why Mr Lian
chose you for this job. No doubt there will be even more important work for you in
the future. So don’t go drinking outside and getting yourself into trouble, will you? If
you do as I tell you, I promise to make it worth your while. And let me know if there’s
any?thing you want here. Mr Lian is a busy man, and not all the people in his
household are to be trusted. It’s better to ask me. He and I are not only cousins, you
know; we are also very good friends.’
‘Yes, sir. I shall do my best to give satisfaction, sir,’ said Bao Er. ‘I realize it would be
more than my life is worth to get into any trouble.’
Cousin Zhen smiled and nodded.
‘Good. As long as you know.’
For some minutes the four of them sat drinking together; but Er-jie knew that it was
not for a family evening that Cousin Zhen had come and soon found an excuse for
getting herself and her mother out of the way. She told him that she had to go to the
other side of the house for something and was afraid to do so on her own. As soon as
she and Mrs You were out of the room, Cousin Zhen drew up closer to San-jie. His
behaviour became so familiar that the two maids in attendance grew embarrassed
and slipped off to the kitchen. They were content that Cousin Zhen and San-jie
should enjoy themselves in any way they chose, provided that they did not have to
stay and watch.
Cousin Zhen’s two pages were all this time drinking with Bao Er in the kitchen, while
the Mattress stood at the stove with her back to them. When the two maids burst in
and began laughing and joking with the boys and asking to be given some wine, Bao
Er was far from pleased.
‘What are you girls doing here? You ought to be in the sitting-room. Suppose they
want service in there? There’ll be trouble.’
His wife turned round wrathfully from the stove.
‘Silly old fool! Why don’t you get your nose back into your winecup? The sooner
you’re flat on your back snoring and your little winkle tucked up out of harm’s way,
the better it’ll be for all of us! What’s it to do with you whether they want service in
there or not? I’m here to see to all that. If there’s any rain falling it won’t fall on your
head. So what are you worrying about?’
Bao Er was well aware that it was largely to his wife that he owed his favourable
position with Jia Lian. He did little himself these days but draw his pay and drink his
wine; but so exemplary was the Mattress’s service of Er-jie, that al?though Jia Lian
knew of Bao Er’s failings, he had so far refrained from taking him to task about them
out of con?sideration for her. Bao Er’s awareness of this kept him in obedient
subjection to her. And so, when he heard himself addressed by her in this way, he
merely drank a few more cups in silence and then took himself quietly off to bed.
The Mattress had a few drinks herself now with the pages and the two girls, anxious
to make herself as agreeable as possible so that the pages would give a good report
of her to Cousin Zhen. But just as this little party in the kitchen was beginning to
warm up, it was interrupted by a sudden knocking at the gate. The Mattress hurried
out and opened it as Jia Lian was dismounting from his horse. In answer to his
question whether there was anything to report, she whispered into his ear that Mr
Zhen had come and was at this very moment in the guest-room in the west courtyard.
Jia Lian went straight to his own room, where he found Er-jie sitting with her mother.
The two women seemed somewhat flustered by his arrival, but he pretended not to
notice.
‘Bring us some wine,’ he told the Mattress. ‘I think I shall have a cup or two and
then go to bed. I feel rather tired tonight.’
At once Er-jie was all over him, taking his coat, fetching him tea, asking him about his
day - in short, showering on him all those little wifely attentions which so enchanted
him. Presently the Mattress reappeared with their wine. Old Mrs You said that she
did not want any and went off to bed. The two of them sat down together to drink it.
One of the two maids, who had now been persuaded to resume their duties, came
over from the kitchen to wait on them.
Meanwhile Jia Lian’s trusty servant Rich - the only attendant he had brought with
him on this visit - had been tying his master’s horse up in the stable. Finding another
horse there already, he was able on closer inspection to identify it and to deduce
what the Mattress by her whispering had attempted to conceal from him: viz., that
Cousin Zhen was somewhere on the premises. Sure enough, on going to the kitchen
when he had finished tying up the horse, he found two of Cousin Zhen’s pages,
Happy and Lively, sitting there drinking. They, too, when they saw him enter, realized
that both their masters must be present; but neither party was going to admit what
each knew the other one must know.
‘We couldn’t keep up with the master,’ said Happy and Lively, ‘and it was getting
too dark to go home, so we came here to beg a night’s shelter.’
‘There’s plenty of room here for you to sleep,’ said Rich expansively. ‘Make
yourselves at home. Actually I came here to bring the mistress her monthly
allowance. Now that I’ve given it to her, I think I shall spend the night here as well.’
‘Come and have a drink then,’ said Happy. ‘We’ve had a lot to drink already.’
Rich sat down and poured himself some wine; but before he could drink any, there
was a sound of neighing and trampling from the stable and he and Lively had to run
out and shout at the horses. The two animals sharing the same manger had taken a
dislike to each other and started kicking. It was only after a great deal of shouting and
whoaing that the pages succeeded in quieting them and tying them up on separate
sides of the stable.
While they were doing this, Happy was able to drink several more cups of wine, and
by the time they got back into the kitchen, he was already glassy-eyed. The Mattress
was evidently waiting for an opportunity to retire.
‘Well, boys,’ she said to them as they entered, ‘I’ll leave you to it then. I’ve made
you a pot of tea, so you can help yourselves. I’m going off to bed.’
The boys were reluctant to let her go, and there was a good deal of kissing and
fondling and noisy ribaldry before she finally succeeded in extricating herself. She
closed the door behind her as she went, and Rich and Lively proceeded to bar it on
the inside, preparatory to going to bed. When they went back to look at the kang,
however, they found Happy sprawled out in the middle of it, already fast asleep.
‘Come on, there’s a good chap, get up and lie down again properly!’ they said,
shaking him. ‘Don’t be so selfish! Where are we supposed to go?’
‘What about a bit of bum-cake?’ mumbled Happy, momen?tarily returning to
consciousness. ‘Turn and turn about. Fair shares for all.’
The others, seeing that he was too drunk to reason with, blew the lamp out and
settled themselves on either side of him as best they could.
The commotion in the stable had caused Er-jie’s apprehensiveness to return, but by
forcing herself to keep up a flow of chatter, she succeeded in distracting Jia Lian’s
attention away from it. So successful was she that, after a few more drinks, he began
to grow amorous and, having first sent the girl off with the dirty things, proposed
that they should bar the door for the night and begin undressing. Er-jie was beautiful
at any time, but in only a crimson shift, with her fashionable coiffure shaken out into
billowing black clouds and her face all soft and glowing with desire, she possessed an
extra dimension of beauty that was not revealed in the day?time. He hugged her to
him with a delighted laugh.
‘They’re always telling me how perfect that termagant wife of mine is,’ he said, ‘but
the way you look tonight, she’s not fit to carry your shoes!’
‘I may have looks, but I’ve got no class,’ said Et-jie. ‘Without class, one might just as
well not be good-looking.’
‘Why do you say that?’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t understand.’
‘You all treat me as if I were a fool,’ said Er-jie tearfully. ‘You think that I know
nothing-’
‘No!’
‘- but though we’ve only been married two months – ’
‘I know you’re not a fool!’ he insisted.
      ‘- though we’ve only been together for so short a time,’ she continued, ‘I already
feel that I’m yours completely and for ever, in this life or any life to come. Because
you are my husband, I shall always look up to you and never, never deceive you. My
future is assured. But what is to become of my sister? We can’t let things go on the
way they are at present. We must think of some permanent solution for her.’
Jia Lian laughed reassuringly.
‘Look, I’m not a jealous man. I know about your past and it doesn’t bother me. You
really mustn’t worry. I realize that now we are married you must feel awkward about
Cousin Zhen being here, but surely the solution would be for Cousin Zhen and your
sister to have a formal union and after that we can forget our inhibitions and make it
a foursome. What do you say to that?’
Er-jie wiped her eyes.
‘It’s very nice of you to suggest it, but I don’t know what the other two would think
of your idea. For one thing, my sister is such a funny girl. And for another, I don’t
know whether your cousin would like having everything dragged out into the open.’
‘It’ll be all right,’ said Jia Lian, ‘you see! I’ll go over and have it out with him now.
There’s no time like the present. It’s only a question of breaking the ice.’
He strode off, the bolder for being a little drunk, to the courtyard on the western side
of the compound. Light was streaming through the sitting-room window. He pushed
the door open and walked in.
‘Where’s the big chief, then?’ he cried. ‘Cousin, I’ve come to pay you my respects!’
Speechless with embarrassment, Cousin Zhen rose to his feet and motioned him
dumbly to a seat.
‘What’s this?’ said Jia Lian, noting his embarrassment. ‘After we’ve always been
such good friends, and after all you’ve done for me - because if I cut myself into a
million pieces, I still couldn’t begin to show you how grateful I am - you’re not, surely,
going to start feeling uneasy on my account? My dear coz, from this day on I want
you to carry on exactly as you used to in the past. Otherwise I shall give up any idea
of getting myself an heir and stop coming here altogether!’
He tried to kneel down at this point, but Cousin Zhen, who was becoming quite
frantic with embarrassment, quickly reached out to stop him.
‘All right, Lian,’ he said, ‘all right. Whatever you say, coz. I’ll be guided by you.’
‘Come on, let’s have some more wine!’ Jia Lian said to the servant-girl. ‘I’m going to
drink with my dear cousin.’ He turned to San-jie with a leer. ‘Why don’t you and my
dear cousin share a cup? You and Zhen drink a cup together and I’ll drink a cup to
your future happiness. To Zhen and San-jie!’
San-jie leaped to her feet and, pointing her finger at Jia Lian from where she stood on
the kang, fixed him with a withering look of contempt.
‘Don’t try the talking horse on me, my friend! If you two want to drink, I’ll watch
you drink. But count me out of it. People who work shadow-puppets should be
careful not to break the screen. You surely can’t be so stupid as to imagine that we
haven’t seen by now how things really stand in your household? If you and your
cousin thought that by spending a few taels of your stinking money you could buy my
sister and me for your whores, you were very much mistaken. You see, I know all
about your old woman and how scared you are of her. I know that it’s because of her
that when you married my sister you had to smuggle her out here like a man who’s
stolen a gong and doesn’t dare to play on it. Well, I should like to meet this Feng lady
and find out just how many heads and arms she’s got. If we can reach a satisfactory
agreement, well and good; but if there’s the slightest difficulty, I’m perfectly prepared
to take her on and fight it out with her single-handed. But before I do that, I promise
to have the liver and lights out of you two, or my name’s not “San-jie”! - You said you
wanted a drink, didn’t you? All right, I’ll drink with you.’
She picked up the wine-kettle and poured out a cupful of wine; then, having drunk
half of it herself, she threw an arm round Jia Lian’s neck and pressed the winecup to
his lips.
Jia Lian was shocked by this onslaught into instant soberness; and Cousin Zhen,
ill-prepared for such strident shrew?ishness by what had passed earlier in the
evening, was almost equally taken aback. The two of them, for all their boasted
experience, found themselves reduced to a condition of tongue-tied helplessness by
this single unmarried girl.
But San-jie had not finished with them yet.
‘Why don’t you ask my sister to join us?’ she asked. ‘If we’re going to have fun, let’s
all have fun together. “Home is handiest” as the proverb says. There are no outsiders
here. We’re all in the family. Come one, come all!’
Cousin Zhen was by now looking for an opportunity to leave, but San-jie was careful
to give him none. He had not suspected that she could be like this and deeply
regretted having come; but he could not simply walk out without giving offence to Jia
Lian.
Out of deliberate disregard for appearances she had taken off her hair-ornaments
and outer clothes, and from time to time as she spoke, the animated gestures with
which her words were accompanied caused the imperfectly-fastened crimson shift
she was wearing to gape open, revealing glimpses of leek-?green breast-binder and
snow-white flesh beneath; the red shoes that peeped out below her green drawers
were all the time tap-tapping or coming together in a manner that was anything but
ladylike, and her earrings bobbed to and fro like little swings. To her
brow’s dusky crown and lips incarnadine
the lamplight lent an added softness and brightness; and the wine she had drunk
gave her eyes, which were at all times sparkling and vivacious, an even more
irresistible allure. The two men were spellbound, and yet at the same time repelled.
Her looks and gestures were all that inflamed concupiscence could desire; but her
words and the very frankness of a provocation too brazen to be seductive kept them
at bay.
And a poor pair they made of it in a situation where something other than carnal
satisfaction was required of them. Not only was there none of that lively repartee
that might have been expected of men who prided themselves on their gallantry;
they could not produce so much as a single amusing remark between them and sat
there, as the effortless flow of talk continued to pour out of her, fascinated but
unresponding. Sometimes she abused them, called them names, said the most
outrageous things to them. It was as though the roles had been reversed - as though
she was the man and they were a pair of poor, simpering playthings whose services
she had paid for. And when she had had enough of playing with them, she dismissed
them ignominiously, bolted the door alter them, and went to bed.
From that time onwards, whenever one of the servants did some small thing to
displease her, she would launch into loud abuse of Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong,
denouncing all three of them as swindlers, deceivers and oppressors of the widow
and the orphan.
Cousin Zhen, when he finally got back after that visit, was chary of exposing himself
again. Sometimes when San-jie felt in the mood, she would send one of the boys
round to summon him and he would visit her then gladly enough, for he still had
some small hope of winning her; but he was careful to behave himself when he did,
and to defer in everything to her wishes.
San-jie was a very peculiar young woman. She took a perverse pleasure in enhancing
her natural beauty by affecting a striking style of dress and by adopting every
conceivable kind of outrageously seductive attitude. The effect was that every male
who encountered her was smitten - not only the suscep?tible ones like Jia Lian and
Cousin Zhen, but those made of sterner stuff as well; yet all of them, after only a few
minutes in her company, felt their ardour extinguished and their advances repelled
by the reckless, forthright, almost insolent way in which she received them.
When her mother and sister took her to task for her cavalier treatment of the two
cousins, she told Er-jie she was ‘stupid’.
‘Why should that pair of precious rascals be allowed to ruin girls like us that are
worth a million of them and get away with it?’ she said. ‘They shan’t do so if I can
help it. Besides, that wife of Lian’s is a very dangerous woman. We’re all right for the
time being because she hasn’t found out yet about your marriage; but she will do
one of these days, and when that time comes she’s not going to sit still and do
nothing. There’s sure to be a most terrible row, and who knows which of us will come
out of it alive? It’s only fair that they should be made to jump a bit now. If we’re
going to end up with a bad name anyway, let’s at least get what we can out of them
while we’ve got the chance!’
Her mother and sister, seeing that it was useless to argue with her, left her alone.
San-jie certainly put her precept into practice. Her demands for special kinds of food,
for clothing, for jewellery became daily more extravagant and capricious. Given a
silver orna?ment she would express a desire for a gold one. If she had something
with pearls in it, she would like something with gems in it as well. While she was
eating the fatted goose, her mind was already contemplating the slaughter of the
duck. And woe betide the cook if anything was not quite to her taste! Over would go
dishes, table and all! Or, if a newly-made garment displeased her, no matter how
expensive the material, she would quickly reduce it to ribbons, using a pair of scissors
to aid the process and uttering a fresh malediction at every tear. Cousin Zhen, who,
having some time previ?ously exhausted the possibilities with Er-jie and grown
somewhat tired of her, had willingly yielded her up to Jia Lian and transferred his
attentions to her sister, now found that San-jie, far from proving the complaisant
mistress he had hoped for, was actually costing him a great deal of money - money,
moreover, on which there seemed little prospect of a return.
Nowadays when Jia Lian came he spent the whole of his time there with Er-jie and
scarcely dared venture from her room. Because of San-jie he too was beginning to
regret the situation into which he had got himself.
On the other hand Er-jie was so loving and so devoted to him; he found her so
sympathetic. In her gentleness, in the wifely submissiveness with which she insisted
on discussing everything with him before she would make any decision, she was ten
times better than Xi-feng. And in respect of looks, voice and deportment she was at
least five times better.
True, she was a fallen woman; and though she had repented, neither her reform nor
any other excellence could bring back her virtue. But that was what she said. Was it
not Jia Lian himself who repudiated it?
‘Everybody makes mistakes,’ he would say. ‘As long as you know that you were
wrong and don’t do it again, that’s all that matters.’
He refused to talk about the unchasteness of her past: her present goodness was
enough for him.
And so, his doubts forgotten, he would cleave to her more passionately than ever.
They were of one heart, one mind. He swore they should live and die together.
Xi-feng and Patience were banished totally from his thoughts.
Inevitably these pillow-sessions would end with Er-jie urging Jia Lian to do something
about her sister.
‘Why don’t you talk it over with Zhen and think of someone you both know of who
can marry her?’ she said on the last of these occasions. ‘She can’t stay here like this
indefin?itely. Sooner or later there will be trouble.’
‘I did talk to Zhen about it the other day,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but he couldn’t give up the
idea of keeping her for himself. I said to him, “That piece of meat is too hot for chaps
like us, Zhen. The rose is a very pretty flower, but you can get some nasty jabs from
its spines. You’ll never hold a girl like that down. Much better find a husband for her
and get her off your hands.” But he wouldn’t say “yes” and he wouldn’t say “no”: he
just hummed and hawed for a bit and left it at that. So what can I do?’
      ‘Don’t worry,’ said Er-jie. ‘We’ll speak to San-jie herself about it tomorrow. If we
can persuade her to agree in principle to a betrothal, it can be left to her to have it
out with Cousin Zhen herself. Once she has convinced him that he has nothing to
hope for, he will have to do something about finding her a husband.’
Next day Er-jie spent the morning preparing a little party for the four of them, and Jia
Lian, instead of going off as he usually did, deliberately stayed indoors. At about noon
Er-jie invited her sister over and, when she arrived, seated her next to their mother in
the place of honour. San-jie knew perfectly well what the subject of this meeting was
to be and, as the wine was going round for the third time, before her sister had had a
chance to broach it, she burst into tears and proceeded to do so herself.
      ‘I’m sure the only reason you have invited me here today, sister, is to give me a
lecture, but I’m not stupid and I don’t need to be nagged at as if I were a child. We all
know what happened in the past, and there is no point in dragging it up now. The
important thing is that as you are comfortably settled and Mamma’s future is now
assured, it’s time to start thinking about how I am to be disposed of. However, this
matrimony business is no children’s game: it’s a girl’s whole lifetime to the day she
dies that is decided by it. In the past, because we were so vulnerable and one could
never be sure what designs men might have on one, I deliberately acted in a
shameless manner in order to keep them at bay. Now I am willing to put all that
behind me and turn myself into a good and obedient wife. On one condition, though:
the man I marry has got to he somebody I know about and somebody who is to my
liking. If I leave the choice to you, I am sure you will do your best to find someone
rich and well-placed and good-looking, but if it is someone I cannot give my heart to,
I shall feel that the whole of my life has been wasted.’
      Jia Lian smiled reassuringly.
      ‘That’s easy. We leave the choice entirely to you. Just name the man and we will
take care of the expenses. Your mother will have nothing to worry about.’
      ‘I don’t need to name him,’ said San-jie. ‘Er-jie has known about him all along.’
      ‘Who is it?’ Jia Lian asked, turning to Er-jie; but Er-jie could not for the moment
think who her sister had in mind.
      ‘I know who it is!’ Jia Lian clapped his hands delightedly, suddenly convinced
that he had thought of the right answer. ‘And a very good choice too!’ he added.
      ‘Who?’ said Er-jie.
      ‘No one else could ever be good enough for her. It has to be Bao-yu.’
      Er-jie and Mrs You felt sure that he was right, but San-jie herself repudiated the
suggestion indignantly.
      ‘I suppose you think that if we were ten sisters instead of only three, every one
of us would have to marry a Jia. There are other males in the world besides the ones
in your family, you know.’
      The other three were nonplussed. If it was not Bao-yu that she had in mind,
then who could it be?
      ‘Don’t just look under your noses,’ said San-jie. ‘Try casting your mind back five
years, sister.’
      But at that point Joker arrived, one of Jia Lian’s most trusted pages and sharer of
his secrets.
      ‘Sir She has been asking for you, sir,’ said Joker. ‘I told him that you’d gone off to
Sir Wang’s and then hurried here as quickly as I could to let you know.’
      ‘Were they asking about me at home yesterday?’ Jia Lian sounded a trifle
concerned.
      ‘I told the mistress that you were at the family temple discussing arrangements
for the Hundred Days with Mr Zhen and thought you might not be able to get back.’
      Jia Lian called for his horse to be led out and set off immediately, with Rich in
attendance. Joker was left behind at the disposal of the women. Er-jie had two plates
of food and a large cup of wine set down on the edge of the kang beside him and
invited him to eat and drink standing, while she asked him a few questions. In fact
she asked him a great many. How old was Xi-feng? In what way was she so awful?
How old was Grandmother Jia? How many girls were there? And so on. Joker, smiling
broadly, proceeded, between large sips of wine, to give the old lady and her two
daughters a detailed expose of the Rong mansion and its inhabitants.
      ‘I’m one of the boys from the inner gate,’ he told them. ‘I belong to one of two
groups of four. We work there by shifts. One group goes on duty as the other one
comes off. Of us eight, some, like me, are in the master’s confidence, some are in the
mistress’s. Those of us who are in the master’s confidence daren’t say a word to
upset the mistress’s boys; but she can say or do whatever she likes to us. You want to
know what she’s like? A cruel heart and a sharp tongue, that about sums her up. The
master’s no softy, but he can do nothing with her. There’s a Miss Patience working for
her though. She’s very nice. Though she’s so well in with the mistress, she’ll often do
you a kindness behind her back. When one of us boys is in trouble, the mistress will
be down on us like a ton of bricks, but if we can get Patience to put in a word for us,
we know we shall be all right. Everyone hates the mistress. The only exceptions are
Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship. The others pretend to like her, because they’re
afraid. She knows she hasn’t got any rivals and she always takes very good care to
keep both Their Ladyships happy, so consequently whatever she says goes, nobody
else dares stand up to her. She’s a great one for saving. She must have saved a
mountain of money by now. That’s why Their Ladyships are always saying what a
good manager she is. They don’t realize how much we servants have to suffer so that
she can take the credit. Whenever anything good happens, you can be sure that
she’ll get in with the news first, before anyone else does, so that she can reap the
benefit. But when things go wrong or she’s made a slip herself, she’ll very quickly
step aside and fasten the blame for it on someone else. She’ll even fan the flames up
and make it hotter for that other person once she’s safely out of it herself. Even her
mother-in-law can’t stand her. “The magpie looking for a bigger nest who set up
house with the crow” she calls her. She says she’s no business meddling with the
affairs of our household when she ought to be looking after her own. She says if it
weren’t for Her Old Ladyship, she’d have ordered her back long ago and made her
stay where she belongs.’
      Er-jie laughed.
      ‘If you say things like this behind her back, what must you say behind mine? In
my case there are even more things to criticize!’
       Joker fell on his knees, protesting.
       ‘If I ever said a word against you, madam, I should deserve to be struck by
lightning! It would have been a great blessing for all of us if the master had married
you first instead of the mistress. I know there would have been fewer beatings and
cursings for us boys and we shouldn’t have had to go around the way we do in fear
and trembling all the time. There isn’t a boy among us who isn’t every day and
everywhere singing your praises and saying what a kind and considerate lady you are.
We are planning to ask the master to let us stay here and serve you all the time.’
       ‘Get up, get up!’ said Er-jie, laughing. ‘Little imperti?nence! I was only joking;
how easily you are scared! I’m sure I don’t know what you should want to come here
for. I am thinking of going to see your mistress.’
       Joker waved his hand in vigorous disapproval.
       ‘Don’t do that, madam, whatever you do! It would be much better if you never
set eyes on her as long as you live. She’s “soft of tongue and hard of heart”, “two
faces and three knives”, she’ll “give you a smile and trip you up the while”, she’s “a
welcoming fire when you see her, but a stab in the back when it’s dark” - all those
things and more. I don’t think even Miss You here could get the better of her in an
argument, so I’m sure a quiet, gentle lady like you would be no match for her.’
       Er-jie smiled.
‘If I behave correctly towards her, I don't see why she should do me any harm.’
‘Listen, madam,’ said Joker. ‘I'm not saying this to you because I’ve had too much to
drink, but when she sees that you are both prettier and more popular than she is,
she’s not going to let matters rest. They call jealous people “vinegar bottles”, don't
they? Well, she’s not just a bottle-full of vinegar; she’s a storage-jar - a whole
cistern-full of it! The master’s only got to rest his eyes on one of the maids, and she’ll
find occasion to have that poor girl beaten until she looks like a boiled sheep’s head.
Miss Patience is supposed to be his chamber-wife, but I doubt she lets him sleep with
her more than once in a year. And even then she’ll go on and on about it afterwards
until she’s reduced Patience to tears. “I didn't want to do it,” says Patience, “you
made me. When I said I didn’t want to, you told me I was wicked and dis?obedient,
but now that I've done it, you keep picking on me.” After that she makes it up with
Patience and begs to be forgiven.’
‘That can't be true,’ said Er-jie. ‘If she's really the harpy you say she is, how could
she possibly be frightened of a mere chamber-wife?’
‘Because Patience has reason on her side,’ said Joker. ‘It’s like the proverb says:
“Three men with a carrying-pole can't shift Reason from its place.” Patience has been
with the mistress since she was a little girl. There were four maids that came with the
mistress when she married, but only Patience stayed on with her. The other three
either died or got married. The mistress gave her to the master to be his
chamber-wife partly because she wanted to show everyone what a virtuous wife she
was and partly because she thought it would be a way of binding him to her. Miss
Patience is a really good sort. She’s not the sort of person to go looking for trouble,
and she’s always been good and true to the mistress. That’s why the mistress always
makes it up with her.’
‘I see,’ said Er-jie. ‘But haven’t I heard that there are a young widow and a number
of young ladies in the family? If your mistress is as awful as you say she is, how comes
it that these other ones let her get away with it?’
Joker clapped his hands together and laughed.
‘Because the “young widow” you're talking about – that’s our Mrs Zhu - is a Saint.
The nickname we servants give her is “Lady Gwanyin”. She doesn’t as a rule have
anything to do with household matters. She spends all her time teaching the young
ladies writing and broidering and book-learning. That’s her job. She has done a bit of
household managing since the mistress fell ill, but even now she doesn’t interfere
very much: just follows the rules, very quiet and ladylike - no throwing her weight
about or showing off how clever she is like the other one. Of the young ladies, the
eldest one - well, I suppose she must be a good ’un to have been so favoured. The
second one - that's the master's sister - we call her “Miss Doddyblock”. She’d
probably forget to say “oh” if you stuck a pin in her. The third - Master Bao’s younger
sister - we call “The Rose” –’
‘Why do you call her that?’ the You sisters asked simultaneously.
‘Sweet and pretty and everyone loves her, but she has a thorn,’ said Joker. ‘The
great pity about her is that she’s not Her Ladyship’s child. A phoenix reared in a
crow’s nest, that’s what she is. The fourth young lady is really Mr Zhen’s sister, but
Her Ladyship brought her over to our mansion when she was still a baby and brought
her up there with the others. She’s a big girl now, but still pays no attention to what
goes on around her, no more than the second one. Then besides our four there are
two other young ladies that you probably won’t have heard about - both very, very
beautiful. One is Sir Zheng’s sister’s child. Her name is Miss Lin. Though she’s so
beautiful, sh’'s very thin and weakly. The other is Her Ladyship’s sister’s child. Her
name is Miss Xue.’
‘Miss Wood and Miss Snow,’ said Er-jie, smiling.
‘If we ever meet them on their way through the courtyard or getting into their
carriages when they go out,’ said Joker, ‘we none of us dare to breathe.’
‘Of course,’ said Er-jie. ‘A great household like yours is sure to be very strict about
such matters. Though young boys like you would be allowed into the courtyards, you
would naturally be expected to keep your distance when the young ladies are about.’
     ‘No, no, no,’ said Joker, waving his hand energetically. ‘That’s not the reason
we’re afraid to breathe. We’re afraid that if we breathed out too hard, we might blow
Miss Lin over and cause Miss Xue to melt!’
     The three You ladles, the Mattress and the two maids all burst out laughing.
     But who was it that San-jie wanted to marry? This will be revealed (if you want
to know) in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 66

Shame drives a warm-hearted young woman
to take her life
And shock leads a cold-hearted young gentleman
to renounce the world



Our last chapter concluded with Joker’s female audience laughing at the notion of
Miss Wood’s being blown down and Miss Snow melted by the breathing-out of the
pages. The Mattress dealt him a playful box on the ear.
‘There may be some truth in what you say; but your way of telling things turns even
good sense into nonsense,’ she said. ‘You are more like one of Bao-yu’s boys than
one of the Master’s.’
Er-jie was about to ask another question, but San-jie got in first.
‘Yes now, about Bao-yu: what does he do - apart from going to school?’
Joker laughed.
‘Don’t ask about him, Miss! You’d never believe half of it if I told you. To begin with,
although he’s such a big fellow now, he’s never had what you might call a proper
schooling. Everyone in the family since his great-grandfather’s time, including the
Master, had to do their ten years in the family school; but not him. Bao-yu doesn’t
like study; so because he is Her Old Ladyship’s darling, that’s that. Sir Zheng used to
try and do something with him, but that was soon put a stop to by Her Old Ladyship.
Nowadays he spends the whole of his time just fooling around. You can’t understand
what he’s talking about half the time, and you can’t make any sense of what he does.
He looks bright enough, and people always assume from his looks that he must be
clever; but underneath it he’s stupid. You can tell he must be stupid from the fact
that he never has a word to say for himself when he meets anyone. I’ll give him this,
though: although he doesn’t go to school, he can write a bit. That’s about the only
thing he’s any good at. He doesn’t study, he doesn’t care for physical training, and he
doesn’t like meeting people. He just spends all his time playing around with a pack of
maids. He’s soft, too. Sometimes when he sees us, if he’s in the mood, he’ll play with
us as if he were an equal. Other times he ignores us and we ignore him. If we’re
sitting down or lying down when he comes by, we don’t get up for him; we just take
no notice. He doesn’t care. Nobody’s afraid of him. We do just what we like when
he’s around. He never stops us.’
‘You talk like this about someone who is easy-going with you,’ said San-jie, ‘yet you
complain just as much about someone who is strict. One can see that you are
difficult people to employ!’
‘I always thought Bao-yu looked so nice,’ said Er-jie. ‘How disappointing to learn
that there is really nothing in him after all!’
‘You surely don’t believe the rubbish this boy has been talking, sister?’ said San-jie
impatiently. ‘We have, after all, seen Bao-yu several times ourselves. I suppose you
could call him effeminate. Whether he is eating or talking or moving about, there is
certainly something rather girlish about his manner. That comes from spending
nearly all his time in the women’s quarters with no other males around. But stupid? I
hardly think he can be called that. Don’t you remember when we were still in
mourning, that time we were standing watching the monks as they went round the
coffin and he stood right in front of us? Everyone said how ill-mannered it was of him
and how inconsiderate. But then afterwards he quietly came up to us and explained:
“I hope you didn’t think it very inconsiderate of me to stand in front of you like that,”
he said, “but I noticed how dirty some of those monks were and I was afraid that the
smell of them might distress you.” Then shortly after that, when he was drinking
some tea and you said you’d like some too, he stopped one of the old women from
emptying the slops out of his cup and filling it up again for you. “No, no,” he said,
“that’s dirty! You must wash it first before you pour her any.” Just on the strength of
those two incidents I think you ought in fairness to agree that, when he is with girls
at any rate, he is perfectly capable. People fail to find out what he is really like
because they are put off by his manner.’
‘To hear you speak, it sounds as if the two of you would get on very well together,’
said Er-jie. ‘I think we ought to betroth you to him. Why not?’
San-jie was prevented from answering by Joker’s presence. She merely looked down
and occupied herself by cracking a melon-seed between her teeth.
‘They’d make a fine pair,’ said Joker, ‘whether from the point of view of looks or of
character. The only thing is, he’s got someone else already. Although it hasn’t been
made official yet, it’s as good as certain that he’s going to marry Miss Lin. The reason
they haven’t been properly engaged yet is because Miss Lin is so often ill, and also
because they are still a bit on the young side; but two or three years from now, as
soon as Her Old Ladyship gives the word, they are sure to be.’
They were still discussing this when Rich arrived with a message from Jia Lian.
‘Sir She is sending the Master to Ping-an in a few days’ time on important secret
business. He’ll probably be away for fifteen or sixteen days. He can’t come back here
tonight, but he says, Mrs You, will you and the Mistress get that business you know
about settled, so that when he comes tomorrow, he’ll know what he has to do?’
Having delivered this message, he went back again, taking Joker with him. Er-jie had
the gate closed after them and retired early for the night, a good part of which she
spent in extracting the required information from her sister.
Jia Lian did not arrive until after noon next day. Er-jie expressed concern that he had
come at all.
‘If you have something important to do, you don’t need to put yourself in a rush by
coming here. I should hate to be the cause of your starting late.’
‘It isn’t anything really important,’ said Jia Lian, ‘just a job that needs doing which
happens to be rather far away. I shall have to leave by the beginning of next month
and it will be about half a month before I get back.’
‘Well, while you are away, just concentrate on the job,’ said Er-jie. ‘You don’t have
to worry about anything here. We shall be perfectly all right. San-jie isn’t the sort of
girl to change her mind overnight and she has definitely chosen her man now. I think
you will have to go along with her choice.’
‘Ah yes,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Who is it?’
‘Someone who may not be available at present, in which case it’s anyone’s guess
when he will be back,’ she smiled. ‘I must admit, she has a very good eye. And she
says that she is prepared to wait as long as it will take - ten years if neces?sary. If by
any chance he’s dead or for some reason or other can’t ever come, she says she will
cut her hair off and become a nun. She would rather spend the rest of her life in
prayer and fasting than marry anyone else.’
‘Well, come on!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Who is this person who has made such a powerful
impression on her?’
‘It’s a long story,’ said Er-jie. ‘Five years ago my mother took us both with her to her
old home for my grandmother’s birthday. The family had invited a troupe of amateur
actors for the occasion, all young men of good family. The one who played the junior
male lead was called Liu Xiang-lian. He is the only man my sister is prepared to marry.
Last year he got himself into some sort of trouble and had to go into hiding, and we
don’t know whether he’s out of it yet or not.’
‘So that’s who it is!’ said Jia Lian. ‘No wonder she is so keen. Yes, she certainly has a
good eye. There’s something you probably don’t know about him, though. Young Liu
is a very handsome young man, but he’s an awfully cold fish. He has very few real
friends. Bao-yu is probably the person he gets on best with. He took himself off
somewhere or other last year after beating up that oaf Xue Pan - I suppose because
he wanted to avoid meeting us. I haven’t seen him since then. Someone did tell me
that they’d heard he was back, but it may have been only a rumour. I can easily find
out by asking one of Bao-yu’s pages. - But suppose it is only a rumour. He’s such a
rolling stone, it may be years before he comes back again. Won’t it be rather a waste
for her to put off marrying for so long?’
‘When our San-jie says she’s going to do something, she does it,’ said Er-jie. ‘I think
you will have to go along with her.’
They were interrupted at this point by San-jie herself, who had evidently been
listening to their conversation and chose this moment to come into the room.
‘Set your mind at rest, brother-in-law. I am not one of those people who say one
thing and mean another; I really do mean what I say. If Liu turns up, I shall marry him.
From now on and until he does I shall spend all my time praying, fasting and looking
after Mamma. If he has still not turned up when Mamma is no longer here to look
after, I shall go into a convent.’
She drew a jade hairpin from her hair and deliberately broke it in two.
‘So be it with me if I do not do exactly as I have sworn!’
She went straight back to her room then; and from that day onwards her conduct
was indeed exemplary.
Jia Lian could see that he had no choice but to fall in with her wishes, and after a
brief discussion of domestic matters with Er-jie, went home for further discussions
with Xi-feng about the preparations for his journey. While at home he sent someone
to ask Tealeaf about Liu Xiang-lian.
‘I’m afraid I don’t know,’ said Tealeaf. ‘I should think he probably hasn’t come back
yet. If he had, I should almost certainly have got to hear about it.’
Inquiries made among Xiang-lian’s neighbours confirmed that he had not returned.
Jia Lian was obliged to report back to Er-jie that he had drawn a blank.
A little before he was due to begin his journey, Jia Lian took leave of Xi-feng and the
family, but only in order to spend his last two nights with Er-jie. He found San-jie so
altered on this visit as to seem almost a different person. Er-jie, too, showed herself
so careful and competent in her manage?ment of the little household that he could
see there would be no need to worry about either of them while he was away.
Jia Lian left the city early on the day of his departure and thereafter followed the
main road to Ping-an, putting up at some staging-post or hostelry each night and
making shorter stops for meals and refreshments during the day. After two days of
uneventful travelling he came, on the third day, upon a little caravan moving towards
him along the road ahead consisting of a number of pack-animals and some ten or so
horsemen, of whom the leading two appeared to be masters and the rest servants.
As they drew near enough for him to make out their faces, Jia Lian saw with
astonishment that the two leading horsemen were Xue Pan and Liu Xiang-lian and
urged his horse forwards to meet them. After greetings and the customary
generalities had been exchanged, the three of them went into a near-by inn to sit
down together and talk. Jia Lian asked the question that had been puzzling him.
‘After your little incident last year, the rest of us were anxious to make it up
between you, but young Liu seemed to have disappeared without a trace. How do
you come to be together now?’
‘It’s a very strange story,’ said Xue Pan. ‘My boys and I finished selling our stuff off
in the spring and we’ve been on our homeward journey ever since. Everything was
going quite smoothly until a couple of days ago. Then just as we were approaching
Ping-an, we ran into a gang of robbers who took away all our things. But just at that
very moment up pops young Xiang-lian out of nowhere, drives off the robbers, gets
all our stuff back for us, and saves our lives. He refused to let me thank him, but in
the end he agreed that we should become blood-brothers. We’ve been travelling
together ever since. From now on we’re going to be just like real brothers to each
other. He’s leaving me at the next crossroads and going off sixty or seventy miles
south of here to look up an aunt of his, while I go on ahead to the capital. When I’ve
settled my own affairs, I’m going to find a new house for him and fix him up with a
nice little wife, and we’re both going to settle down and be family men.’
‘I see,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Well, I’m glad to hear it. It’s a pity we had all that worry for
nothing.’
He paused a moment before continuing.
‘You said something a moment ago about finding young Liu a wife. I happen to
know of someone who would suit him perfectly.’
He proceeded to tell the other two about his own marriage to Er-jie and how they
were anxious to find a husband for her younger sister, omitting to mention, of course,
that San-jie had chosen Liu Xiang-lian herself.
‘Don’t say anything about this to the others when you get home,’ he told Xue Pan.
‘I’m waiting until we have a son. I shall tell them about it then.’
Xue Pan seemed delighted.
‘High time, too!’ he said. ‘Cousin Feng is to blame for not giving you one.’
‘There you go again!’ said Xiang-lian, laughing. ‘You mustn’t say things like that to
people. Better keep your big mouth shut!’
Xue Pan obediently fell silent, merely observing, before he did so:
‘We ought to take Lian up on his suggestion, though.’
‘I’d always set my heart on marrying a stunningly beautiful girl,’ said Xiang-lian.
‘However, since you both recom?mend this one, I’m prepared to lower my
expectations a bit. Yes, all right, Mr Jia. I leave it to you to arrange this, then. I put
myself in your hands.’
‘I don’t ask you to believe this now,’ said Jia Lian, smiling. ‘You’ll be able to judge for
yourself when you see her: but this sister-in-law of mine is a stunningly beautiful girl.
I should go so far as to say she must be one of the most beautiful women who have
ever lived.’
Xiang-lian brightened.
‘All right, then. Shall we fix it up when I get back to the capital in about a month’s
time, when I have finished seeing my aunt?’
‘If you and I were the only ones involved, I would gladly leave it at that,’ said Jia
Lian, ‘but knowing how unpredictable your movements are, I can’t help feeling a little
nervous on the girl’s behalf. Suppose you failed to turn up? It could mean a whole
lifetime wasted. I think you ought to give me some sort of pledge.’
‘A gentleman’s word ought to be pledge enough,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘In any case, I’m
always hard up; I’m not in a position to give you a betrothal gift - particularly when I
am on the road like this, away from home.’
‘There’s all my stuff at your disposal,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Help yourself. Give him a share
of that.’
‘It isn’t money or jewellery I’m after,’ said Jia Lian. ‘It doesn’t have to be anything
valuable. Just give me something you carry about with you that I can take back with
me as a token.’
‘At all events, I can’t give you this sword,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘I need it for self-defence.
I have got another sword in my luggage I could let you have - well, two swords, really:
it’s a pair of swords in one scabbard, what they call a “Duck and Drake” sword. It’s a
family heirloom. I never use it, but I always carry it around with me. I could never
bear to be parted from it for long, so however much I may wander, if you take that as
my pledge, you can be sure of my eventually coming back to get it.’
He handed Jia Lian the heirloom when he had got it out of his bundle, and after a few
more drinks the three men remounted, took leave of each other, and went their
separate ways.
*
In due course Jia Lian arrived at Ping-an and saw the Military Governor, only to be
told that the business he had come about could not be dealt with satisfactorily until
some time in the tenth month. As there was no point in staying, he started back the
very next day for the capital, calling in first at Er-jie’s place on his arrival.
Er-jie had run the little household during his absence with exemplary circumspection.
The courtyard gate had been kept shut and bolted all day and she had received no
outside visitors. San-jie, too - a young woman who never did anything by halves - had
continued as good as her word. When not actually keeping to her own room, she had
spent the whole of the time either ministering to the wants of her mother or sitting
and sewing with Er-jie. Jia Lian was gratified to find all these signs of prudent
housekeeping on his return and his respect for Er-jie’s wifely virtues increased.
When the greetings and routine questionings were over, he told the sisters about his
encounter with Liu Xiang-lian, and getting the Duck and Drake swords out of his
luggage, he handed them to San-jie to take care of. San-jie first examined the
scabbard. It was embossed with a design of interlacing dragons and sea-monsters
and encrusted all over with jewels. Then she took out the swords, identical except
that one had the character ‘Duck’ and the other the character Drake’ engraved on its
blade. And what blades! Cold, cruel; glittering with the cold brightness of autumn
waters. San-jie was enraptured by them. She put them both back into their scabbard
and carried them off to her own room, where she hung them up over her bed.
Thereafter she would look up at them from time to time and smile, happy in the
knowledge that now her future was assured.
After a couple of nights with Er-jie, Jia Lian went back to Rong-guo House to report to
his father and to rejoin the other members of the family. He found Xi-feng with the
rest. She had by now recovered sufficiently to get about and had resumed her duties
as household manager. As soon as he could, he went to see Cousin Zhen and tell him
about San-jie and Liu Xiang-lian. Cousin Zhen was lately much taken up with a new
acquaintance and had lost his former interest in the You sisters. He therefore
received Jia Lian’s news with equanimity and seemed perfectly content to leave the
matter in his hands, merely insisting on himself contributing thirty taels towards the
expenses, since he feared that Jia Lian’s resources might be inadequate. Jia Lian
accepted the money and handed it to Er-jie to spend on San-jie’s trousseau.
Round about the middle of the eighth month Xiang-lian arrived back in the capital
and at once went to pay his respects to Aunt Xue and make the acquaintance of Xue
Ke. He was told that Xue Pan had been ill in bed almost since the day he got back
(some sickness brought on by change of water or the effects of travel) and was still
under doctor’s treatment. However, on hearing that Xiang-lian had come, Xue Pan
insisted on having him brought into his bedroom. He and his mother, whose earlier
resentment against Xiang-lian had been completely banished by her gratitude to him
for saving her son’s life, spoke eloquently of their indebtedness, and when the
conversation turned to the subject of Xiang-lian’s marriage, they insisted that all the
material things required for it should be supplied by them, so that he should have
nothing to do himself except name the day. It was now Xiang-lian’s turn to be
grateful.
Next day Xiang-lian went to see Bao-yu. The two of them were always wonderfully at
ease in each other’s company and Xiang-lian felt sufficiently intimate to ask him
confidentially about the circumstances of Jia Lian’s second marriage.
‘I really don’t know - beyond what Tealeaf has told me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I haven’t been
to see them. I don’t really think it’s my business. Tealeaf mentioned that Cousin Lian
was very anxious to see you about something, but I don’t know what it was.’
Xiang-lian told him about the various things that had happened to him on his travels,
ending up with an account of his encounter with Jia Lian.
‘Congratulations!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You are a lucky man. She’s a ravishingly beautiful
girl. The perfect match for a good-looking chap like you!’
‘If she is so beautiful,’ said Xiang-lian, ‘there can be no shortage of suitors wanting
to marry her. Why should your cousin pick on me? I’ve never been particularly
friendly with him in the past - certainly not to that extent - yet when I met him on
this journey, he was so pressing, so insistent that I should give him a definite
undertaking to marry her. What am I to make of it? It’s almost as if the girl’s family
was doing the pursuing. I can’t help feeling very dubious about the whole affair. I
wish I hadn’t given him those swords. I thought of you as the person most likely to be
able to help me get to the bottom of this business.’
‘For a person so intelligent you have left it a bit late to start feeling dubious now
that you have promised to marry the girl and already given them your pledge,’ said
Bao-yu. ‘You started off by saying that you wanted to marry a beauty. Now that
you’ve got one, why not leave it at that? Why these suspicions?’
‘You said just now you didn’t even know about her sister’s marriage,’ said Xiang-lian.
‘How do you know she is so beautiful?’
‘I saw her practically every day for a month at Ning-guo House when she and her
sister were brought there by Cousin Zhen’s mother-in-law,’ said Bao-yu. ‘How could I
fail to know? Ravishingly beautiful. Obviously made for you. You San-jie, you see:
even the name makes her yours!’
Xiang-lian stamped impatiently.
‘And everyone else’s, no doubt.’ Bao-yu’s execrable pun had not amused him. ‘It
won’t do. This is a thoroughly bad business. The only clean things about that
Ning-guo House are the stone lions that stand outside the gate. The very cats and
dogs there are corrupted!’
Bao-yu reddened, and Xiang-lian, realizing that he had gone too far, began pumping
his bands apologetically.
‘I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. - But surely you can tell me something about
her character?’
‘Since you appear to know already, I don’t quite see the point,’ said Bao-yu wryly.
‘In any case, perhaps I’m none too clean myself.’
‘What I said was spoken in the heat of the moment,’ said Xiang-lian. ‘You mustn’t
take it to heart.’
‘I’ve already forgotten it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you go on talking about it, you will make it
seem that the one who has taken it to heart is you.’
Xiang-lian pumped his hands again and took his leave. He was still thoroughly
unhappy about the whole affair. At first he thought of going back to Xue Pan and
talking it over with him; then he changed his mind, partly because Xue Pan was ill but
mainly because in any case he had little confidence in his judgement. In the end he
decided that perhaps the best thing would be simply to ask for his pledge back. Once
he had made up his mind, he decided to tackle Jia Lian about it immediately. He
found him at Er-jie’s place.
Jia Lian, delighted to hear that Xiang-lian had already come to call, came hurrying out
to meet him and conducted him to the inside sitting-room to introduce him to his
future mother-in-law. He was somewhat surprised when Xiang-lian merely bowed to
the old lady instead of making her a kotow and addressed her formally as ‘Mrs You’.
The significance of this became apparent presently when tea was served and
Xiang-lian came at once to the point.
‘I am afraid that when I met you recently on my travels I acted far too hastily. I
didn’t know at the time, hut it seems that my aunt had already in the fourth month
chosen another girl to be my wife. When she told me about it, there was obviously
nothing I could say. To hold to my agreement with you would have meant disobeying
my aunt, and that of course is out of the question. Now, if the pledge I gave you had
been gold or silk or something of that sort, I should simply have forgotten about it;
but those swords I gave you were a family heirloom left me by my grandfather, so I’m
afraid I shall very regretfully have to ask you for them back.’
Jia Lian was unable to take this calmly.
‘Now look here, young Liu, this won’t do, you know! A pledge is a pledge. The
whole idea of it is to guard against people having second thoughts like this. An
engagement to marry isn’t something you can just jump into and out of at will. I’m
afraid what you are proposing is quite impossible.’
Xiang-lian smiled patiently.
‘No doubt you are in the right, and I am perfectly prepared for you to reproach me;
but I’m afraid I cannot go through with this marriage under any circumstances.’
Jia Lian seemed about to argue, but Xiang-lian frustrated him by rising to his feet.
‘Could we go and discuss this somewhere else, please? It isn’t very convenient,
talking about it in here.’
You San-jie had been able to hear the whole of this conversation quite clearly from
her room. She had waited so long for Xiang-lian, and now that at last he had come,
he was re?jecting her. It must be because of something he had heard about her in
the Jia mansion. He probably thought of her as a shame?less wanton, the sort of
woman who throws herself at men, unworthy to be his wife. If she allowed the two
men to go off together, there was little likelihood that Jia Lian could do anything to
stop him breaking off the engagement; and even if he tried arguing with him, the
probable outcome would only be further damage to her reputation. As soon,
therefore, as she heard Jia Lian agreeing to go outside with him, she snatched the
swords down from the wall, and having first drawn out the Duck and hidden it
behind her back, she hurried into the sitting-room to see them.
‘There is no need for you to go out and discuss anything,’ she said. ‘Here is your
pledge back.’
The tears were pouring down her cheeks like rain. She held out the scabbard with the
single sword in it in her left hand. As Xiang-lian took it, she whipped the other sword
out with her right hand and slashed it across her throat. It was all over in a moment.
Red scatter of broken blossoms, and the jade column fallen, Never to rise again ...
The terrified servants made futile attempts to resuscitate her, but she was already
dead. Old Mrs You wept and screamed, breaking off from time to time to inveigh
against Xiang-lian as a murderer. Jia Lian seized hold of Xiang-lian and called for
someone to bring a rope, intending to tie him up and take him to the yamen; but
Er-jie checked her weeping and did her best to dissuade him.
‘He didn’t force her to do it, it was her own decision. What good will taking him to
the yamen do? We don’t want a public scandal on top of everything else. Much
better let him go.’
Jia Lian, whose resolution seemed temporarily to have deserted him, let go of
Xiang-lian automatically: but Xiang-lian made no attempt to escape.
‘I didn’t know she was like this,’ he said, weeping. ‘She had a noble heart. It wasn’t
my luck to have her.’
He lifted up his own voice then and wept, as if he had been weeping for his bride. He
stayed with the family until the coffin had been bought and San-jie laid inside it; and
when the lid was closed over her, he threw himself on it and clung to it for a long
time weeping. Only then did he take leave of them, walking alone out of the gate,
blinded by his tears and scarcely knowing where he was going.
As he walked along in a daze, his thoughts full of San-jie’s rare combination of beauty
and resoluteness which he had so wantonly rejected, one of Xue Pan’s little pages
came looking for him to take him to his new house. Xiang-lian was too distracted to
pay the boy much attention and allowed himself to be led there by the hand. It was a
pleasant, well-appointed little house While he and the page stood waiting in the
sitting-room, he heard a little tinkling noise - the sound made by the girdle-gems of a
hurrying woman - and San-jie came into it from outside. She had the Duck cradled in
her right arm. Her left hand was holding some sort of album or ledger.
‘I loved you for five years,’ she said. (The tears were still running down her cheeks.)
‘I did not know that your heart was as cold as your face. It was a foolish love, and I
have paid for it with my life. Now I am ordered to go to the Fairy Disenchantment’s
tribunal in the Land of Illusion to keep the records of the other lovers who are under
her jurisdiction. But I could not bear to leave without seeing you just once more
before I go. After this I shall never see you again.’
She began to go, but Xiang-lian wanted to question her and tried to stop her going.
She spoke again, but this time it sounded more like an incantation.
‘From love I came; from love I now depart. I wasted my life for love, and now that I
have woken up, I am ashamed of my folly. From now on we are nothing to each other,
you and I - nothing.’
A little gust of wind with a faint fragrance on it seemed to blow past him as she
uttered these last words, and the very next moment she had vanished.
Xiang-lian came to himself with a start, uncertain whether or not he had been
dreaming. He could see no sign of Xue Pan’s little page when he looked about him,
and the new house had turned into a dilapidated temple. Not far from him a Taoist
with a crippled leg sat catching and killing his lice. Xiang-lian got up and went over to
him.
‘What is this place, holy one?’ he asked, having first clasped his hands and knocked
them against his forehead in the ap?propriate salutation. ‘And may I know whom I
have the honour of addressing?’
The Taoist chuckled.
‘I don’t know where this place is any more than you do. Nor who I am. It is a place
where I am resting a little while before going on elsewhere.’
It felt to Xiang-lian as if a douche of icy water had penetrated him to the bone with
its coldness. He understood. Without a moment’s hesitation he drew the
companionless Drake out of its scabbard, stretched out his queue, slashed through
                    … the unnumbered strands,
That bind us to the world and its annoys,
and as soon as the Taoist was ready, followed him out into the world. But where the
two of them went to, I have no idea. Other information apart from that will be
available in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 67

Frowner sees something that
makes her homesick
And Xi-feng hears something that
rouses her suspicions



The grief occasioned in old Mrs You, Er-jie, Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian by San-jie’s
suicide can be imagined. It long outlasted her burial outside the city walls, which
took place shortly after the encoffining. As for Liu Xiang-lian, the human repinings
felt by that somewhat cold young man when he realized the value of what he had
lost were brought to an abrupt end (as we have shown) by the even colder words of
the Taoist, which, by breaking through the Barrier of Confusion and opening his eyes
to the vanity of human affections, caused him to renounce the world by symbolically
severing his hair and following the mad holy man in his wanderings. The direction
these took them in is unknown, as we stated in the previous chapter. Let us leave
them and see how others were affected by these events.
Aunt Xue had been delighted by the news of Xiang-lian’s betrothal to You San-jie. The
wedding would give her an opportunity of demonstrating her gratitude to him for
saving her son’s life. She was excitedly planning for this event - discussing the
purchase of a house and furniture, selecting a date, making arrangements for the
ceremony and so forth - when one of the household boys came in with the appalling
news that San-jie had cut her throat and Xiang-lian decided to become a Taoist. She
was still puzzling over the incomprehensible nature of this disaster when Bao-chai
came over from the Garden.
‘Child, have you heard the news?’ Aunt Xue asked her. ‘Mrs Zhen’s younger sister,
San-jie - the one that was engaged to marry Pan’s new “brother” Liu Xiang-lian - has
cut her throat. I’ve no idea why. And Xiang-lian has renounced the world and just
disappeared. Isn’t it terrible? I don’t know what to make of it.’
Bao-chai heard her without emotion.
‘ It is as the proverb says, Mamma: “The weather and human life are
unpredictable.” This was probably preordained because of something they did in
their past lives. The other day you were planning to do everything you could for him
because of what he did for Pan. Now she is dead and he has disappeared. I think the
best thing you can do is just forget about them. There is no point in upsetting
yourself on their account; there are other things to worry about. It is more than a
fortnight now since Pan got back from the South and the goods he brought with him
must all have been disposed of by now. Surely you ought to have a word with him
about entertaining the people who went with him on the journey? They had a good
deal of hardship to put up with during their months of travel. It will seem very
uncouth of us if we do not find some way of showing our appreciation.’
While Bao-chai and her mother were talking, Xue Pan came in from outside. His eyes
were still wet from recent weeping.
‘Mamma,’ he said, ‘have you heard about Xiang-lian and San-jie ?’
‘They told me only a few minutes ago,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Your sister and I were talking
about it when you came in.’
‘You heard that Xiang-lian had gone off with some Taoist then,’ said Xue Pan.
‘Yes,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘That’s what’s so extraordinary. Why should an intelligent
young man like that suddenly take leave of his senses to go wandering off with a
Taoist? As he had no parents or brothers, I think it’s up to you as his best friend to
find him. They say the Taoist is both mad and lame, so they cannot have got very far -
probably no farther than one of the temples or monasteries in this vicinity.’
‘That’s exactly what I thought, Mamma,’ said Xue Pan. ‘As soon as I heard the news,
I went around looking for him with the boys, but we couldn’t find a trace of him
anywhere, and none of the people we talked to seemed to have seen him.’
‘Well, if you’ve already looked for him and he can’t be found, you’ve done as much
as a friend could do,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Some good might yet come of it, you never
know. What you’ve got to do now is start getting your business back into shape. And
for another thing, it’s time you started thinking about your own marriage and making
a few prepa?rations. We’ve got no other man in the family but you and you’re not as
bright as you might be. You know what they say about baby birds learning to fly. The
sillier the bird, the sooner it must begin. If you start getting ready well in advance,
there will be less danger of making yourself ridiculous when the time comes by
finding that there are all sorts of things you have forgotten. And there’s something
else I want to talk to you about. Your sister has just been pointing out to me, it’s
more than a fortnight since you came back and the goods you brought hack with you
must all have been sold off by now. You ought to give a little party for those of our
employees who went with you on the journey - just a little gesture to show them that
you appreciate their services. After all, it was a long journey. What would it be? A
thousand miles there and back? Pretty nearly. You were four or five months away, at
all events. And don’t forget, they underwent some very alarming experiences on
your behalf.’
‘You’re absolutely right, Mamma,’ said Xue Pan. ‘And sis, she always thinks of
everything. I had thought about it myself, but during these last few days, what with
running around everywhere disposing of the stock until my head feels’ as if it will
burst and running around getting things ready for Xiang?-lian’s wedding (fat lot of
good that was, now that it’s all come to nothing!) I somehow didn’t get round to it.
Still, it’s not too late. We can fix a time for tomorrow or the day after and send the
invitations out straight away.’
‘I leave all that to you,’ said his mother.
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when one of the pages came in from
outside to report.
‘There are some men here from the shop with two cases of stuff for you and a
message from Mr Zhang. He says these are the things you bought for yourself, that
aren’t on the stock-list. He would have sent them round earlier, but there were a lot
of other cases on top of them and he couldn’t get them out. He says they didn’t
finish selling the stock off until yesterday, so this is the first time he has been able to
get at them.’
Two other pages carried the two cases in, one after the other, while he was speaking.
They were large coir trunks, protectively crated between pairs of roped-together
boards.
‘Aiyo!’ said Xue Pan. ‘How stupid of me! I brought these things back specially for
you and sis, Mamma, but I completely forgot to bring them home with me. Fancy the
boys in the shop having to remember them for me!’
‘It’s a good thing you “brought them back specially”, said Bao-chai. ‘Now we’re only
getting them a fortnight late. If you hadn’t “brought them back specially”, we should
probably have had to wait until the end of the year! It’s the same with everything
you do. You are so thoughtless.’
Xue Pan laughed.
‘I think it’s because of that scare we had on the journey. It scared the wits out of
me and they haven’t got back into the right holes yet.’
The others laughed. He turned to the boy who had come in with the message.
‘All right. Tell the men outside we’ve got the stuff now and they can go back to the
shop.’
Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were curious.
‘Well, what is it you’ve got all crated and corded up so carefully?’
Xue Pan told the pages to untie the ropes, remove the protecting boards and undo
the fastenings of the trunks. The first one contained mostly materials - silks, satins,
brocades and so forth - and various foreign articles of domestic use.
‘The other trunk is stuff I got specially for you, sis,’ said Xue Pan.
He undid the fastenings of it himself. Besides writing?brushes, ink-sticks, inkstones,
different sorts of fancy stationery, purses, rosaries, fans, fan-cases, face-powder,
rouge and other feminine articles, it contained a whole lot of novelties from
Hu-qiu-shan: little mercury-filled automata who turned somersaults when you put
them down on the floor or a table, automata with sand-filled cylindrical bodies
whose arms, legs and heads moved when you set the sand running, and lots and lots
of scenes from drama made up of tiny figures moulded in coloured clay in cases of
transparent green gauze. Most fascinating of all was a tiny made-to-order figure of
Xue Pan himself, looking exactly like the original in every detail. Bao- chai had no eyes
for anything but this. Picking the tiny replica up in her hand to examine it, she looked
from it to the original and burst out laughing. She had the other things put back into
the trunk and ordered two of the older servants to carry it to All-spice Court for her
under Oriole’s supervision while she herself stayed chatting a little longer with her
mother and brother. Then she too went back into the Garden.
After she had gone, Aunt Xue proceeded to go over the contents of the other trunk
with Providence, taking them out, putting them into separate piles, and explaining
which pile was to be given to Grandmother Jia, which to Lady Wang, and so forth.
Xue Pan for his part began there and then to make preparations for a party. The
invitations to his employees were dispatched with great urgency, for he was
determined that the party should be on the very next day. As a number of people
were invited, it took some time for all of them to assemble and there was much talk
about trading, accountancy and the disposal of stock before the last of the guests
had arrived. When they were all present, Xue Pan invited them to take their places at
table and went round himself with the wine-kettle to fill their cups. Aunt Xue sent
someone in to thank them on the family’s behalf for their loyal service. Thereupon
drinking began and conversation of a more general kind among the guests. Presently
one of them observed that a good friend was missing from their company whose
presence might have been expected.
‘Oh?’ said the others. ‘Who’s that?’
‘Mr Liu,’ the man said, ‘that saved all our lives and became a blood-brother to the
master.’
This started a good deal of speculation among the guests and finally one of them
asked Xue Pan outright why he had not invited him. Xue Pan frowned and sighed.
‘Don’t ask me about him,’ he said. ‘It’s a very funny business. It isn’t “Mr Liu” now
any longer. It’s “Father Liu”.’
The others expressed surprise.
‘How can that be?’
Xue Pan related the whole story to them. They were even more surprised when they
heard.
‘Now I understand what they were shouting about yesterday outside the shop,’ said
one of them. ‘It was something about a man having been converted by only two or
three words spoken to him by a Taoist. Someone else said the two of them had
vanished into thin air. They didn’t say who the man was. We were all busy selling
stock at the time, so we couldn’t go outside to find out and we’ve been wondering
ever since whether to believe the story or not. We never imagined it was Mr Liu they
were talking about. If we’d known, we’d have gone after him and tried to reason with
him. I’m sure we’d have found some way of stopping him.’
‘I’ve got a different theory about what happened,’ said one of them.
‘Oh? What’s that?’ the others asked him.
‘Well,’ said the man with the theory, ‘it doesn’t seem very likely that a clever young
chap like Mr Liu would suddenly go off to become the disciple of an old Taoist. We
know how strong he is and how good at martial arts. Perhaps he’d found out that this
Taoist was really a wicked magician and just pretended to become his disciple so that
when he’d got him to some quiet, out-of-the-way place he could do him in.’
‘If that’s what it is, that’s very good,’ said Xue Pan. ‘There are too many of these
fellows going around leading people astray with their silly nonsense. It needs a
person like Xiang-?lian to put a few of them down.’
‘But didn’t you look for Mr Liu yourself when you heard about this?’ his guests
asked him.
‘Of course I did,’ said Xue Pan. ‘Inside and outside the city. And I don’t mind telling
you - you can laugh at me if you like - I had a good old cry when I couldn’t find him.’
He sighed several times and looked very despondent. His customary cheerfulness
seemed to have deserted him altogether since this loss. Seeing him so downcast, his
employees did not venture to stay long, but drank the wine up, finished up the food,
and dispersed. We, too, shall leave him at this point and continue our interrupted
narrative of the previous day.
*
When Bao-chai got back from her mother’s to her own room in All-spice Court, she
went over the toys that Xue Pan had given her, deciding which of her cousins each
one of them should go to and retaining only a very few of them for herself. When she
had finished doing that, she proceeded to portion out the other things as well. For
some of the cousins there were writing-brushes, paper, inkstones and ink; for others,
purses, fans and rosaries; some were to have hair-oil, powder and rouge; for some
there were to be only toys. She made the little piles as equal as possible, except in
the case of Dai-yu, for whom she selected twice as much as for anyone else. Having
explained very carefully to Oriole who each of the piles was for, she sent her off, with
an old woman acting as portress, to go round to all the apartments and deliver them.
With one exception, the cousins, on receiving their presents, tipped the bearers and
said that they would thank Bao-chai in person when they next saw her. Dai-yu alone
reacted some?what differently. The sight of the Hu-qiu toys, manufactured only a few
miles from her native Soochow, brought on a severe attack of nostalgia. Once more
she was reminded of her position: an orphan and an outsider, with no kind brother in
her case to bring back things for her from the South. Already she was beginning to be
upset. Nightingale knew at once what was the matter, but judged it more politic to
remonstrate than to let her mistress know that she understood.
‘Look at all the illness you’ve had, miss. You hardly ever stop taking medicine. It’s
only just recently that you’ve begun to look a bit better. Though even now I think it’s
more a case of being in better spirits than being properly cured. You can see from the
fact that Miss Bao has sent you all these things that she must think a lot of you. That
ought to make you happy, not upset you. Whatever is Miss Bao going to think if she
gets to hear that the things she has sent you have made you feel miserable? That’s
not going to he very nice for her, is it? And there’s another thing. Look how
concerned Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship always are about your health, how
they get the best doctors and the best medicines to try and cure you. And now, just
as you are beginning to be a little bit better, here you go, crying and making yourself
miserable. It’s as if you wanted to get ill again, just to give them something more to
worry about! It was too much fretting that brought on your illness in the first place.
You ought to have a bit more consideration for yourself.’
While Nightingale was admonishing her mistress, a voice from the courtyard was
heard announcing ‘Master Bao’. Nightingale called to him to come inside.
‘Sit down,’ said Dai-yu..
    Bao-yu noticed that she had been crying.
‘Hullo, what’s the matter?’ he asked. ‘Who’s been upsetting you?’
Dai-yu forced a smile.
     ‘I’m not upset.’
Nightingale shot her lips out and gestured towards the table behind Dai-yu’s bed. His
eyes followed her gesture to the pile of presents on the table. He realized she could
only just have received them from Bao-chai.
‘Why, what a lot of things you’ve got there!’ he said. ‘Are you planning to set up a
shop?’
Dai-yu made no reply.
‘Don’t talk about them!’ said Nightingale. ‘They’re from Miss Bao. As soon as Miss
Lin set eyes on them, she burst into tears. I was just trying to talk some sense into her
when you came in. Perhaps, now you’re here, you’ll be able to do it for me.’
Bao-yu knew what Dai-yu’s trouble was as well as Nightin?gale, but was no more
willing than Nightingale to show her that he knew. He merely laughed, therefore, and
answered Nightingale with a jest.
‘Oh, I know what’s upset your mistress. She’s cross because Miss Bao didn’t send
her more. Never mind, coz,’ he said, turning to Dai-yu, ‘one of these days I’ll he
visiting Kiangnan myself, and when I do, I promise to bring you back two whole
boatloads of these things. That should dry your eyes for you!’
Dai-yu, aware that she was being ‘cheered up’, could not rebuff the clumsy attempt
too impatiently; nor, on the other hand, did she feel inclined to let it pass
unreproved.
‘I may be very stupid and ill-bred, but not quite to the extent of getting into a
passion because I have not been given enough toys. I am not a three-year-old. You
make me out to be even more petty-minded than I am. I have my own reasons for
what I feel. What do you know about them?’
As she said this, the tears began once more to flow. Bao-yu moved over from his seat
and sat down beside her on the bed. He began picking the articles on the table up
one by one, turning them this way and that to examine them, and asking her all sorts
of questions about them. What was this? What did you call it? Wasn’t this one clever?
What was it made of? And this one, what was it for? He also made various
suggestions as to where she should put them. This one he thought would be nice to
keep by her on her desk; that one would look well with the vases and other
ornaments on the wall-table; and so on and so on until Dai-yu felt that, however
well-intentioned this might be, she could stand no more.
‘Come on, you’re being a nuisance,’ she said. ‘Let’s go and see Bao-chai.’
This was precisely what Bao-yu had been hoping for. If he could get her to go out, the
distraction of doing something else might cause her to forget her sadness.
‘Good!’ he said. ‘We ought to go, anyway, to thank her for the things.’
‘I wasn’t thinking of that,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Between cousins there is no need for such
formality. I was thinking that, having just got back from the South, Cousin Pan must
have told her a lot about the places there he visited, and hearing about them from
Chai would be the next best thing to taking a trip back there myself.’
Her eyes began to redden, and for a moment it seemed in doubt if she would go out
after all; but as Bao-yu was already on his feet waiting for her, she was more or less
obliged to follow him.
‘After all the trouble Cousin Pan went to in getting them to you,’ Bao-yu told
Bao-chai when they were in her room, ‘you ought to have kept those things for
yourself, not given them all away to other people.’
‘There’s nothing very special about them,’ said Bao-chai. ‘They are all inexpensive
objects made by local craftsmen which just happen to have come from a long way
away. I thought the rest of you might find them amusing.’
‘When I was little, these things were so familiar to me that I thought nothing of
them,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Now, after all these years, they have become novelties again.’
“‘The farther from home, the more precious the object” as the saying goes,’ said
Bao-chai. ‘Not that these are precious, of course.’
Bao-yu feared that Bao-chai was moving onto dangerous ground and intervened to
change the subject.
‘Be sure to make Pan go again next year, Chai, and bring us back a lot more.’
Dai-yu stared.
‘If you want to make such a request, that’s your business, but kindly leave others
out of it!’ She turned to Bao-chai. ‘He has not come here to thank you, you observe,
but to put in an order for next year.’
Bao-chai and Bao-yu both laughed.
As the three of them chattered on, the conversation presently turned to the subject
of Dai-yu’s illness.
‘When you are out of sorts,’ Bao-chai suggested, ‘you want to force yourself to go
out of doors: walk around, visit people, look at things - anything to take your mind off
yourself. You’ll find it is much better for you than sitting cooped up indoors feeling
miserable. I wasn’t feeling very well recently. I felt exhausted all day long and hot all
over and wanted to do nothing but lie down. This is a bad time of the year for me,
and I was afraid of becoming seriously ill. So I started deliberately looking for things
to do and forcing myself to do them; and do you know, during the last day or two I
really have begun to feel better.’
‘I am sure you are right,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I have in fact come to the same conclusion
myself.’
*
The person most gratified by Bao-chai’s presents was Aunt Zhao.
‘I’m not surprised they all say what a nice girl that Bao-chai is,” she said to herself
when the consignment of toys arrived for Jia Huan. ‘You can see from this how kind
and generous she is. Her brother can’t have brought all that much back for her from
his travels, yet every single person has been remembered. No one’s been left out
because they aren’t impor?tant, even the unlucky ones like us that no one else ever
bothers about. Now if it had been that Lin girl, it would have been a very different
story. She can scarcely even bring herself to look you straight in the face. You
wouldn’t catch her sending us things like this!’
As these thoughts passed through her mind, she was turning the things over and
over in her hands and arranging them this way and that upon the kang. Presently the
thought occurred to her that Bao-chai was close kin to Lady Wang. Why should she
not take advantage of that fact to ingratiate herself with Lady Wang? Gathering the
articles up in her arms, she went off, full of fuss and self-importance, to Lady Wang’s
room and took up a position at her elbow.
‘Look!’ she said, putting on a very affected smile. ‘Look what Bao-chai has just sent
our Huan! Such thoughtfulness in one so young! She’s a real little lady, Bao-chai. She
has class. And so generous. You can’t help admiring her. I don’t wonder you and Her
Old Ladyship are so fond of her and always speaking so highly of her. I didn’t like to
keep these things without your permission, that’s why I’ve brought them. And I
thought it might amuse you to look at them.’
Lady Wang had guessed what the motive for her visit must be long before she had
finished. The clumsy attempt to ingratiate was by no means pleasing to her, but she
could not ignore it altogether.
‘Certainly you should keep them,’ she said. ‘Let Huan have them to play with.’
She had merely glanced at the toys in saying this and then turned away again.
So Aunt Zhao, who had been so cock-a-hoop when she came, had got nothing for her
pains but a smutty nose. Angry, but not daring to show it, she returned crestfallen to
her room and threw the things into a corner, muttering crossly to herself as she did
so.
‘Hfn! What do you make of that then?’
And she sat on her own there on the kang, continuing to mutter to herself as she
brooded angrily on her wrongs.
*
Oriole and the old woman had by this time finished delivering presents and went
hack to give their mistress an account of the messages of thanks sent back by the
recipients and the various tips they had received. As soon as the old woman had
gone out, Oriole moved closer to where Bao-chai was sitting and spoke softly into her
ear.
‘When we were delivering at Mrs Lian’s just now, Mrs Lian looked absolutely
furious about something. I had a word with Crimson on my way out and she said that
when Mrs Lian came back from Her Old Ladyship’s a little before we arrived she was
looking very grim - not at all her usual smiling self. She called for Patience as soon as
she got back and they were talking earnestly together about something, but she
couldn’t hear what they were saying. It looks as though something really serious
must have happened. Did you hear about anything while you were at Her Old
Ladyship’s today, miss?’
Bao-chai wondered what could have made Xi-feng so angry, but could think of
nothing.
‘Every household has its own troubles,’ she told Oriole. ‘It isn’t our business to
inquire. Go and pour me some tea.’
So Oriole went out to pour tea and nothing more on that subject was said.
*
After seeing Dai-yu to her gate, Bao-yu continued on his way to Green Delights. While
he did so, he was thinking how hard it must be to be an orphan and feeling more and
more sorry for her. He resolved to have a word with Aroma about it when he got
back, but when he got back, only Musk and Ripple were in his room.
‘Where’s Aroma?’ he asked them.
‘Must he in one or other of the courtyards hereabouts,’ said Musk. ‘She can’t be
lost. Why the sudden urge to see her?’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘I didn’t imagine she was lost. The reason I asked is because I’ve just got back from
seeing Miss Lin. She seemed to be rather upset about something, and when I asked
her what it was, she said the things that Miss Bao sent her were made quite near her
old home and the sight of them had upset her. I was going to ask Aroma if she’d mind
going over and having a word with her.’
‘Oh dear! Who’s in for it this time?’
It was Skybright who said this. She had come in at that moment and overheard only
the last few words he had spoken. He repeated for her benefit the whole of what he
had just been saying to Musk.
‘Aroma went out a few minutes ago,’ said Skybright. ‘I think she was going to call on
Mrs Lian. It’s quite possible that she may drop in at Miss Lin’s place on her way back.’
Bao-yu made no reply. Ripple poured him a cup of tea. He took it from her
absent-mindedly, rinsed his mouth with some of it, handed the rest to one of the
junior maids, and stretched himself out on his bed, looking thoroughly miserable.
*
After Bao-yu went off to visit Dai-yu, Aroma had at first occupied herself with some
sewing. While she was doing this, it suddenly occurred to her that it was some time
since she had been to call on Xi-feng and ask about her illness. Now seemed as good
a time as any to visit her, because she knew that Jia Lian was not there so that she
would be able to converse with her more freely. When she had changed her clothes
and, with the aid of a hand-mirror, made a few adjustments to her appearance, she
went in again to tell Skybright of her decision.
‘I’m off to Mrs Lian’s now. Stay in the room while I’m gone, will you? We don’t want
Master Bao calling out and finding nobody there.’
‘Aiyo!’ said Skybright sarcastically. ‘You are the only one who ever thinks about him,
of course. The rest of us just sit around all day doing nothing.’
Aroma merely laughed and went off without replying. As she came within sight of the
water near Drenched Blossoms Bridge, she saw that the lotuses were all dead and
ragged-looking; but the hibiscus-bushes along the banks were just coming into flower,
the pink budding clusters making a brilliant contrast with the bright green of the
leaves. She lingered on her way along the embankment so that she could get a better
view of them. Looking up suddenly from her contemplation of the hibiscus bushes,
she became aware that on the other side of the path a little ahead of her someone
was standing under the grape-vine waving a feather-duster about, apparently dusting
something. When she got a little nearer, she could see that it was that indefatigable
gardener, Mamma Zhu. Recognizing Aroma, the old woman beamed and came up to
greet her.
‘It’s not often you find time to go out walking, miss?’
‘No, indeed,’ said Aroma. ‘I’m on my way to see Mrs Lian. What are you doing?’
‘I’m trying to keep these wasps off the grapes,’ said the old woman. ‘There was
very little rain in the dog-days this year, consequently it’s brought the pests out onto
all the fruit. It gets riddled all over with bites and a lot of it is dropping before it’s ripe.
These wasps are terrible things. You’d never credit it. They’ll go for just two or three
grapes in a bunch, but the juice drips from them onto the rest, and then the whole
bunch is spoiled. Look at that, miss! A whole lot more of them have settled just in the
time we have been talk?ing.’
‘Even if you keep at it non-stop with that duster of yours, you’re not going to keep
off more than a few of them,’ said Aroma. ‘Why don’t you ask one of the buyers to
get a lot of muslin bags made for you, to tie over the bunches? They will keep off the
birds and wasps while still allowing the air to get at them.’
‘I certainly will,’ said the old woman. ‘What a clever idea! I’ve never heard of that
one before - but then this is the first year I’ve had the job, you see.’ She smiled. ‘Look,
miss, although so many of the grapes are spoiled, they still taste good. Let me pick
you some to try.’
Aroma looked serious.
‘No, no. I don’t think they’re ripe enough to eat yet, in any case; but even if they
were, I couldn’t possibly eat any before the first-fruits have been offered to the
ancestors. Surely a person who has worked as many years for the family as you have
must know that rule?’
‘Of course, miss. You are quite right,’ said the old woman hurriedly. ‘It was being so
pleased that put it for the moment from my mind. I am a foolish old woman.’
‘It doesn’t really matter,’ said Aroma. ‘But you older servants ought not to set us
younger ones a bad example.’
She continued on her way then, out of the Garden and round to Xi-feng’s place. As
she entered the courtyard, she could hear the sound of Xi-feng’s raised voice coming
from inside the house.
‘It’s monstrous! Treating me like a criminal, after all I’ve had to put up with in this
place!’
Whatever the background of this remark might be, it was obvious to Aroma that this
would be an extremely inopportune moment to go in; and yet it was already too late
for her to turn back. The best she could do was to advertise her presence. She
deliberately made a heavier noise with her feet and called out to Patience through
the window. Patience came hurrying out to welcome her.
‘Is Mrs Lian in?’ Aroma asked her. ‘Is she quite better yet?’
By now she was inside the house; but Xi-feng had already had time to get up on the
couch and pretend that she had been lying down. She rose to her feet as Aroma
entered.
‘Yes, I am a little better, thank you. It is kind of you to remember me. It seems quite
a time since you last came round here.’
‘Knowing you weren’t well, I ought by rights to have been coming every day,’ said
Aroma. ‘On the other hand, when you arc poorly, you need lots of peace and quiet
for resting, and I was afraid that if I came too often it might disturb you.’
‘Oh, I don’t mind the disturbance,’ said Xi-feng smiling.
‘But I realize that it isn’t easy for you to get away from Master Bao. Although he has
so many girls to wait on him, you are the one he really relies on. Patience tells me
you are always asking her how I am; so you see, even though you can’t get over here,
I know that you are concerned about me.’
She asked Patience to bring a stool over and put it down beside the couch she was
reclining on for Aroma to sit on. Felicity came in with some tea. Aroma inclined
herself politely as she accepted it and murmured something about Felicity troubling
herself.

While she was talking to Xi-feng, she noticed a junior maid go up to Patience in the
outer room and quietly announce that Brightie had arrived and was waiting at the
inner gate. She heard Patience answer the girl in the same guarded undertone:
‘Good. Tell him to go away for a few minutes and come back later. Tell him not to
hang about outside this courtyard.’
Aroma knew from this that Xi-feng must have business of some kind, so after sitting
for a minute or two longer, she got up to go. Xi-feng made no attempt to stop her.
‘Come again when you can,’ she said. ‘It does me good to talk to you.’
She summoned Patience to see Aroma out. As Aroma followed Patience through the
outer room, she saw two or three junior maids waiting there, obviously scared out of
their wits and looking as if they scarcely dared to breathe. Aroma passed through the
courtyard gate and continued on her way back alone, wondering what could be the
matter.
As soon as she had finished seeing off Aroma, Patience went in again to report to
Xi-feng.
‘Brightie came, but because Aroma was here, I said he was to go and wait in the
front. Shall I have him called in now straight away, or shall I let him wait a bit? What
do you want me to do?’
‘Call him in,’ said Xi-feng.
‘Tell me,’ said Xi-feng in the interval while they were waiting for him to arrive, ‘what
exactly was it you heard?’
‘It was that girl I sent out just now who actually heard it,” said Patience. ‘She said
that while she was waiting at the inner gate, she heard two of the pages talking to
each other on the other side of it. One of them said, “The new mistress is even
prettier than the old one and ever so much better-tempered.” Then she heard
someone else - she thought it might have been Brightie - telling the other two off.
“What’s this ‘new mistress’ ‘old mistress’ you’re talking about? You’d better keep
your voices down. If anyone inside gets to hear about this, you’ll have your tongues
cut out!”’
At this point one of the junior maids came in.
‘Brightie’s waiting outside, ma’am.’
A chilling little laugh from Xi-feng.
‘Tell him to come in.’
The little maid went outside again.
‘The mistress says you are to come in.’
‘Hei!’
Brightie stepped smartly inside, dropped his knee to the ground, and ended up
standing stiffly to attention in the doorway leading to the inner room.
‘Come here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I want to talk to you.’
Brightie came into the room and stood in front of his mistress, a little to one side.
‘Your master’s got himself a woman outside,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Did you know?’
Brightie dropped his knee to the ground once more.
‘I spend all my time on call at the inner gate, madam. I’ve no means of knowing
what the master does outside.’
Xi-feng’s smile was full of malice.
‘Of course you wouldn’t know. You wouldn’t stop other people talking about if you
did, would you?’
Brightie realized from this that the words he had recently been saying to the other
pages must have been overheard and that it would be impossible now to deceive her.
He fell on his knees to reply.
‘I really don’t know, madam. I just happened to hear Joker and Happy talking a lot
of nonsense, so I shouted to them to be quiet; but I really couldn’t tell you the exact
circumstances they were talking about; I should only be making it up if I tried. You
want to ask Joker, madam. When the master’s here, he spends most of his time with
him outside.’
Xi-feng spat with great force.
‘Black-hearted, worthless scum the lot of you! You are all in league against me, do
you think I don’t know? Go out and find that little pimp Joker and bring him here.
And don’t go away when you’ve done that, either. Wait here. I’ll have a few questions
to ask you when I’ve finished with him. – Wonderful!’ she commented to herself.
‘This is my trusted servant whom I employ on all my most confidential business!’
‘Yes, madam. Very good, madam.’
Brightie knocked his head upon the floor, then scrambled to his feet and went off to
look for Joker.
Joker was in the counting-house fooling about with some of the other pages when
word came to him that he was ‘wanted by Mrs Lian’. Startled, but never for a
moment imagining that his master’s secret had been blown, he hurried off after
Brightie to Xi-feng’s apartment to find out why he was wanted. When they got there,
Brightie went in first.
     ‘Joker is here, madam.’
     ‘Bring him in!’
Even before he had seen her, the mere sound of that strident summons was enough
to throw Joker’s thoughts into confusion. But there was nothing for it: he had to
screw up his courage and follow Brightie into the inner room.
‘Well, my little man,’ said Xi-feng as he entered, ‘this is a fine thing you and your
master have been up to! I think you had better tell me all about it.
Joker heard the words, he saw the anger in Xi-feng’s face and the terrified looks of
the maids who stood motionless to left and right of her, and his legs became so weak
that he sank involuntarily to his knees and began kotowing.
‘I’ve been told that this business has really nothing to do with you,’ she said. ‘Your
only fault is in not having come to me and reported it. I am willing to overlook that if
you tell me the truth. But woe betide you if you tell me a single word that is false! If
you had a dozen heads, I should have each one of them!’
Joker rose up, trembling, to his knees:
‘What is it the master and I have done wrong that you want to know about,
madam?’
It was as though the fire that smouldered in Xi-feng had suddenly burst into flame.
‘Strike the mouth that said that!’ she shouted, beside herself.
Brightie advanced, with hand upraised, to do her bidding.
‘Not you, idiot!’ Xi-feng shouted. ‘I am asking him to strike himself. Don’t worry, I
shall have you striking your own mouth too before we are finished!’
      Joker, still kneeling, began opening his arms to left and right of him and bringing
them forcibly together, so as to slap his hands simultaneously upon his face. Xi-feng
allowed him to do this a dozen or more times before shouting to him to stop.
‘Now,’ she said, ‘what’s all this about the “new mistress” your master has married?
I suppose you are going to tell me you know nothing about it?’
Joker, gathering from this that the whole story was out, became quite desperate.
Plucking his hat off he began bumping his head on the floor in a frenzy of
self-abasement.
‘Only spare my life, madam! I swear that every word I tell you shall be the truth.’
‘Get on with it, then!’
Joker knelt stiffly upright in order to do so.
‘I didn’t know about this business at the beginning, madam. I think it started during
the time when Sir Jing’s body was still lying at the temple. Yu Lu went out there one
day to ask Mr Zhen for some money and when Master Rong came back into the city
to see about it, the master came with him. On their way they got talking about Mrs
Zhen’s two sisters, and the master said how much he admired the new mistress - er,
the other Mrs Lian, and Master Rong, he said, joking-like -,
Xi-feng spat.
‘Turtle’s egg! What “other Mrs Lian”?’
‘Beg pardon, ma’am!’ said Joker hurriedly, and kotowed again.
When he had risen once more on his knees, he fixed his eyes miserably on the ceiling,
unable to go on.
‘Well?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is that all? Why don’t you go on?’
‘You’ll have to bear with me, madam,’ said the wretched Joker, ‘otherwise I daren’t.’
‘Bear with you?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Bear with your mother’s arsehole! I advise you to get
on with your story: it will be very much better for you if you do!’
‘Master Rong said he could arrange for the master to marry her. The master was
very pleased. Then - well, I don’t know how exactly, but he did.’
The very faintest of smiles hovered briefly over Xi-feng’s face.
‘I don’t suppose you do know. No doubt if you did, it would make a very
complicated story. All right, go on. What happened after that?’
‘After that Master Rong found the master a house.’
‘Oh?’ said Xi-feng sharply. ‘Where is it?’
‘A few streets behind our place,’ said Joker. ‘Not very far.’
‘So!’ Xi-feng turned and looked hard at Patience. ‘You heard that? You and I are
both dead, Patience. We don’t exist any more!’
Patience dared not reply.
Joker continued his story.
‘Mr Zhen gave a lot of money to the Zhangs so that they wouldn’t object to the
wedding.’
‘Now we have a Zhang family in the story,’ said Xi-feng. ‘This is getting rather
complicated.’
‘Ah yes, you see, madam, the other Mrs Lian -’
Joker suddenly realized what he had said and dealt himself a slap across the mouth.
Xi-feng laughed in spite of herself and the maids to right and left of her puckered up
their faces and giggled. Joker thought for a bit.
‘The elder of Mrs Zhen’s two sisters – ’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Get on with it! What about her?’
‘The elder of Mrs Zhen’s two sisters was engaged when she was little to someone
called Zhang. I think his name is Zhang Hua. Nowadays he and his family are very
poor beggars, almost. Mr Zhen promised them some money in return for breaking off
the engagement.’
Xi-feng nodded, then turned to look at the maids: ‘You hear this, all of you? This is
the little monster who was telling us a few minutes ago that he didn’t know
anything!’
Joker continued:
‘After that Mr Lian had the new house redecorated and she came there for the
wedding.’
‘Where from?’ said Xi-feng.
‘From her mother’s place,’ said Joker.
‘Hm, I see. Was she escorted by anyone?’
‘Only Master Rong and a few maids and nannies. No one else.’
‘What about Mrs Zhen?’
‘She came along a couple of days later with some presents.’
Xi-feng laughed and turned to address Patience behind her.
‘There you are! Don’t you remember there were a couple of days when he hardly
stopped praising Mrs Zhen and telling us what a wonderful person she was?’
The smile on her face quickly vanished as she turned back again.
‘And who waits on them there? - You, of course.’
Joker hurriedly kotowed but did not attempt to reply.
‘Come to think of it,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I suppose all those times he told me he had to be
away because he had business to do for our Ning-guo cousins, it was really this that
he was up to.’
‘Sometimes he really was doing things for them, sometimes he was at the new
house,’ said Joker.
‘Who’s living with her there?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Her mother and her younger sister - leastways, the younger sister was living with
her, but the day before yesterday she cut her throat.’
‘Why did she do that?’ said Xi-feng.
Joker told her the whole story of San-jie and Liu Xiang-lian.
‘He was a lucky man,’ said Xi-feng when he had finished telling it. ‘I’ve no doubt
that if he’d married her she would have made him a most notorious cuckold. - Have
you anything else to tell me?’
‘I’ve told you all I know, madam, and every word I’ve told you is true. You can ask
other people. If you find a word of a lie in what I’ve told you, you can beat me to
death and I shan’t complain.’
Xi-feng bowed her head for some moments, reflecting. Eventually she looked up
again and pointed her finger at him.
‘You are a wicked little wretch and I ought by rights to kill you for imagining that
you could deceive me. I suppose you thought that by deceiving me you would do
that stupid master of yours a favour and your new mistress would love you for it. If it
weren’t that I thought you were too frightened just now to have lied to me, I should
have broken both your legs.’ Her voice rose to a shout. ‘Get up!’
Joker kotowed several times, scrambled to his feet, and retreated as far as the
threshold of the outer room, not daring to leave altogether.
‘Come back!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I haven’t finished with you yet.’
Joker turned and advanced some steps and stood with his arms held stiffly at his
sides and his body inclined forwards in a respectful attitude of attention.
‘What’s the hurry?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Is your new mistress waiting to give you
something?’
Joker dared not look up.
‘From now on you are not to go there any more,’ said Xi-feng. ‘From now on, if I call
for you at any time of any day, I shall expect you to be there straight away - and I
warn you, you’d better see to it that I’m not kept waiting! All right. Be off!’
Again he withdrew. This time he got as far as the steps outside the door.
‘Joker!’
‘Madam?’ He turned back once more.
‘Off to tell the master all about it, aren’t you?’
‘Oh no, madam! I wouldn’t dare.’
‘All right, go then; but if you breathe a word of this outside, I’ll have you flayed!’
‘Yes, madam. Very good, madam.’
Joker now made his final exit.
‘Brightie!’ Xi-feng called.
‘Yes’m!’ Brightie came bounding forward.
Xi-feng opened her eyes very wide and stared at him for the length of time it would
take to say two or three sentences; then finally she spoke.
‘So, Brightie. Very good. Excellent. Now go. And if anyone outside breathes a word
about this, I shall hold you responsible.’
‘Yes’m.’
Brightie withdrew very slowly from her presence; but in his case there was no recall.
‘Pour the tea,’ said Xi-feng.
This was taken by the junior maids as a signal for them to withdraw, which they did
immediately, leaving Xi-feng alone with Patience.
‘You heard all that?’ said Xi-feng. ‘That’s good.’
Patience smiled, but dared not say anything.
Xi-feng appeared to be thinking, and to be growing angrier and angrier the more she
thought. She lay back with her head on the pillow and gave herself up wholly to her
thoughts. Presently she frowned as if an idea had just occurred to her.
‘Patience, come here.’
‘Madam?’
‘I’ve thought what to do,’ said Xi-feng. And she proceeded to tell Patience what she
had planned.
But in order to know what that was, you must wait for the following chapter.
CHAPTER 68

Er-jie takes up residence
in Prospect Garden
And Xi-feng makes a disturbance
in Ning-guo House



When Jia Lian made his second expedition to Ping-an in the tenth month, he found
that the Military Governor was away on a tour of inspection; and since no one
seemed willing to predict when he would be back, there was obviously nothing he
could do but sit in his lodgings and wait for that elusive official to turn up. It was in
fact several weeks before he did, so that by the time Jia Lian had finished transacting
his business and made the journey back home again, almost two months had elapsed
since he set out.
      But we anticipate. Let us return to the point at which we left off in the last
chapter.
      After hearing Joker’s revelations, Xi-feng deliberately concealed her knowledge
from Jia Lian for several weeks. It was not until he had started out on his journey to
Ping-an that she began putting her plan into execution.
      The first thing she did was to call in the workmen - carpenters, decorators,
paperers and so forth - and have the three-frame building on the east side of her and
Jia Lian’s courtyard converted into a smaller replica of the main apartment. On the
fourteenth of the tenth month, when the decorating and furnishing of this apartment
had been completed, she went to see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and
announced her intention of going out first thing next morning to burn incense in a
certain convent-temple in the vicinity. She would take only four companions with her,
she said: Patience, Felicity, Zhou Rui’s wife and Brightie’s wife. She waited until they
were about to get into their carriages on the morning of the fifteenth before
revealing to her companions what their actual destination was to be. They were
going to Er-jie’s house. Xi-feng had previously given instructions to the manservants
who were to accompany them that they were to be dressed in mourning and that the
carriage she rode in was to have mourning trappings. This was because Er-jie, she
had discovered, had not long since suffered a second and greater bereavement: old
Mrs You, who had never quite recovered from the shock caused by her third
daughter’s suicide, had, only two or three weeks previous to this date, taken a nap
which turned out to be her last. Joker was told to lead the way, and it was he who,
arriving at the house a little before the rest of the party, knocked on the gate to give
the occupants warning of its coming. The Mattress came to the door. Joker had by
this time resolved the problem of nomenclature to his own satisfaction:
      ‘Tell Mrs Er,’ he said blandly, ‘that Mrs Lian is here.’
      The immortal parts of the late Droopy’s relict leaped through her cranium and
described several somersaults in the air. She rushed inside to inform her mistress.
Er-jie was no less startled than her servant when she heard the message, but even in
such an extremity she could do no less than receive her visitor with the expected
courtesies. Adjusting her dress, therefore, she went into the front courtyard to meet
her. By this time Xi-feng’s carriage had arrived outside the gate and its occupants
were in process of descending from it. Er-jie watched her visitor curiously as she
entered the outer gate, supported by Zhou Rui’s wife and Brightie’s wife, one on
either side. She was dressed in half-mourning, with hair-ornaments of silver and
white and a spencer of some black material with a silver thread in it over the palest
of pale blue gowns. Underneath the gown she was wearing a plain white satin skirt.
Er-jie was particularly struck by her eyes:
       Brows a branched twig with two high-pendant leaves,
And trigon phoenix-eyes, slant, hard and bright.
And she was very beautiful:
     Pretty as a peach-tree in the spring,
Even in austere autumn’s dress.
      Er-jie advanced to meet her as she entered the courtyard and dropped her a low
curtsey, adopting, in the first words she uttered, the form of address that an inferior
wife uses in speaking to her chief.
‘Forgive me, sister, I had no idea that you were planning to favour me with an
inspection or I should have gone out?side to meet you.’
This was followed by another low curtsey, which Xi-feng, smiling graciously, returned.
After curtseying had continued for some moments on either side, Xi-feng took Er-jie
impulsively by the hand and the two young women walked hand in hand into the
house. Inside, Er-jie made Xi-feng sit down in the place of honour and ordered one of
the maids to bring a cushion and put it down in front of her on the floor.
‘I am still very young,’ she explained to Xi-feng. ‘Since I first came here, everything
has been decided for me by others, either my mother, when she was still with us, or
my elder sister. Now that you have come, I hope - if you do not think me too
unworthy - that you will allow me to take all my instructions from you. I promise to
serve you with all the devotion of which I am capable.’
Having concluded her little speech, she knelt down on the cushion and kotowed.
Xi-feng rose from the chair and bowed.
‘I am as young and inexperienced as you are, sister,’ she said. ‘What I have done for
Mr Lian has always been for his own good, as far as a silly, inexperienced woman like
me could tell what that was. I begged him, as I am sure you would have done in my
position, not to go sleeping out “under the willows” (you know what I mean) both for
his health’s sake and because I knew it would worry his parents; but Mr Lian
completely misunderstood the spirit in which that advice was offered. It wouldn’t
have mattered so much if he’d deceived me about taking a mistress; but marrying a
second wife is a very serious business. He really ought to have told me. It isn’t as if I
hadn’t begged him to take a second wife. If he were to have a son, no matter by
whom, I should stand to benefit as much as he would. It would be a support for me
in my old age. But no. Mr Lian has got it firmly fixed in his mind that I am the sort of
jealous woman who cannot tolerate a rival. And so he has to go off and do this
without telling me. It’s so unfair. Who am I to explain myself to? Only Heaven above
knows what a great injustice he has done me. When I first got wind of your marriage
about ten days ago, I realized at once that it was this mistaken notion he has about
my being so jealous that had prevented him from telling me. I have waited until he is
away before visiting you because I wanted this opportunity of getting to know you
properly. But that is not the only purpose of my visit. I want to ask you - to entreat
you - to show your understanding of my position by leaving this place and coming
back with me to the mansion. Let us live together, side by side, like sisters. Let us join
forces in looking after him: seeing that he performs his duties properly and takes
good care of his health. Surely that is how it ought to be? Just imagine what it will be
like for me if you continue living here outside. Quite apart from my feelings, think of
the effect it will have on my reputation - and on yours, too, for that matter. And even
if you think our reputations are unimportant, as no doubt they are, consider what
the effect will be on Mr Lian’s reputation, which is a far more serious matter. I expect
the servants say all sorts of nasty things about me behind my back. It is their way of
having their revenge on me for being strict. I suppose it is only natural. You know the
proverb. The woman who runs a household is like a water butt: all the dirt washes off
on her. In our household I have three lots of seniors above me and cousins and
sisters-?in-law both single and married in my own generation. If I were really hard to
get on with, how do you think all those people would have managed to put up with
me for so long? Would I have come to you today if I were such a terrible person?
Many wives hearing that their husband had married another woman and was living
outside with her in secret would be unwilling even to set eyes on her. Heaven knows
I’ve tried to accommodate Mr Lian. I’ve even offered him my Patience as a
chamber-wife. I think Heaven and Earth and the Lord Buddha must have taken pity
on me in letting me know about this marriage. They didn’t want me to be destroyed
by a pack of scandal-mongering servants. That’s why I am asking you to come and
live with me. I promise that your treatment will be exactly the same as mine in every
respect: accommodation, service, clothing-allowance, everything. There is so much
that an intelligent person like you could do to help me if you had a mind to. Working
side by side together, we shall not only give the lie to this malicious tittle-tattle of the
servants which I find so wounding; we shall also be able to show Mr Lian when he
gets back how wrong he has been in making me out to be jealous. The three of us
will live in perfect harmony together. And all this I shall owe to you! But if you won’t
come with me, I am perfectly prepared to move in here with you. Provided that you
put in an occasional good word for me with Mr Lian so that I am still left some
ground to stand on, I should even be willing to hold your basin and comb your hair
for you and wait on you like a servant.’
      She concluded this discourse by breaking into noisy weeping. Indeed, so pitiful a
spectacle did she present that Er-jie herself could not help weeping with her. After
further bowings and curtseyings the two women sat down together as first and
second wife and Patience came forward to make Er-jie her kotow. From the superior
quality of her dress and general air of refinement Er-jie could guess who she was and
hurriedly rose to prevent her.
      ‘No, no, you mustn’t do that! You and I are equals.’
Xi-feng stood up, too.
      ‘Nonsense! Let her kotow to you,’ she said, laughing. ‘She is only a maid. She is
your maid as much as mine now and in future you must treat her as such.’
      She ordered Zhou Rui’s wife to take the First Meeting presents out of the bag
she was carrying: four lengths of best quality dress material and four pairs of pearl
and gold earrings with hair ornaments to match. There was more bowing and
curtseying as Er-jie received them. The two wives sat down once more. Tea was
served, and they began to talk things over as they sipped their tea. Xi-feng insisted
that what had happened had chiefly come about through her own fault.
      ‘I blame no one else,’ she said. ‘All I am asking for is a little sympathy.’
     Er-jie was so lacking in guile herself that she had no difficulty in believing that
Xi-feng was a good woman who had been slandered.
‘After all,’ she told herself when she recollected the alarming things that Joker had
said about Xi-feng’s character, ‘servants do often revenge themselves by saying nasty
things about their employers.’
And so, abandoning all caution, she began pouring her heart out unreservedly,
confident that in Xi-feng she had found a friend. Confirmation of this favourable view
in the form of tributes to the excellence of Xi-feng’s household governance were not
wanting from Mesdames Zhou and Brightie in the background.
‘She puts herself out too much for other people, that’s her trouble. She gets no
thanks for it, though. People only complain about her the more.’
They told Er-jie about the apartment that Xi-feng had made ready for her.
‘Beautiful, Mrs Er! You wait till you’ve seen it!’
Er-jie longed to live with Jia Lian inside the mansion like a respectable married
woman and was therefore only too willing to comply with Xi-feng’s request.
‘I ought to go back with you, sister: it is no less than my duty. But what about this
place?’
‘Oh, that’s no problem!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Just get the boys to move out your boxes and
bags for you. You won’t be needing the furniture, you can leave that here. All you
need to do is name whoever of your people is most reliable and we will get whoever
it is to stay here and look after it for you.’
‘Now that I’ve met you, I should like to leave all those sort of decisions to you,’ said
Er-jie hurriedly. ‘I haven’t been here very long and have no experience of running a
household. I’m not able to decide things like this for myself. Why don’t you take
charge of these chests and boxes, sister? I have got hardly any things of my own.
Almost everything in this place belongs to Mr Lian.’
Xi-feng told Zhou Rui’s wife to make a mental note of all the movables and have them
carried over later to Er-jie’s new apartment. She then urged Er-jie to dress herself as
quickly as possible for going out, and as soon as she was ready, walked hand in hand
with her to the waiting carriage. Inside the carriage she insisted that Er-jie should sit
beside her on the same seat.
‘This is rather a strait-laced household we are going into,’ Xi-feng confided to Er-jie
when they were alone in the carriage together. ‘Neither the old lady nor Lady Wang
knows a word yet about your marriage. They would probably kill Mr Lian if they
found out that he had married you while he was still in mourning. There is a very
large garden at the mansion which all the young people live in and which other
people very seldom go into. I think when we get back it would be better if you didn’t
meet Their Ladyships straight away but stayed in there for a few days while I think of
some way of explaining about you to them.’
‘I leave all that to you, sister,’ said Er-jie. ‘I will do whatever you think best.’
The boys accompanying the carriage had received advance instructions not to enter
the mansion by the main gate on their return journey but to go straight in at the back.
Descend?ing from the carriage on her arrival, Xi-feng, having first shooed away a knot
of curious bystanders, led Er-jie through the rear entrance of Prospect Garden and
took her to meet Li Wan and the girls in Sweet-rice Village.
By this time nine out of ten of the Garden’s inhabitants had heard about Jia Lian’s
second marriage, and when the news spread that Xi-feng was bringing the new wife
into the Garden, curiosity drew numbers of them to Li Wan’s place to meet her. All
were impressed by her beauty and by her gentle, pleasing manner. After introducing
them, Xi-feng warned each of them individually that she would kill anyone who
mentioned Er-jie’s presence to an outsider. The nannies and maids who worked in
the Garden were all terrified of Xi-feng and knew in any case that Jia Lian’s marrying
a new wife in a period of family and national mourning was a very serious offence.
They needed no persuading, therefore, to have as little to do with the matter as
possible.
Xi-feng had a private word with Li Wan requesting her to look after Er-jie for a few
days while she herself thought of some way of explaining about her to Grandmother
Jia and Lady Wang. Li Wan knew that Xi-feng already had an apartment ready for
Er-jie to move into at her own place and could well understand that a certain amount
of secrecy had to be maintained about a marriage contracted when in mourning; she
could not therefore refuse to give Er-jie temporary lodging.
Xi-feng took Er-jie’s own maids away from her and substituted a servant of her own.
She also gave secret instructions to the older women to keep an eye on Er-jie,
threatening them with the direst penalties if they allowed her to stray outside or
deliberately run away. Having thus disposed of Er-jie for the time being, she went off
to attend to the next stage of her plans. But of that, for the moment, we will say
nothing.
Everyone who knew about this affair was mystified by the strange forbearance that
Xi-feng had so far shown towards her rival and could not help wondering what had
come over her. Er-jie for her part, observing how well all the young people in the
Garden got on together, felt thoroughly reassured about her future in the bosom of
so delightful a family.
But then, after a few days had gone by, there was an unpleasant incident with Mercy,
the new maid whom Xi-feng had given her in place of her own. Er-jie had run out of
hair-oil and told Mercy to run over to Xi-feng’s and ask her for some.
‘I think you might be a bit more considerate, Mrs Er,’ the maid said insolently.
‘Every day of her life Mrs Lian has to dance attendance on Their Ladyships and Lady
Xing, she has two or three hundred servants waiting from daybreak every morning
for a word from her to tell them what to do, she has at least a dozen important
matters and thirty or forty little ones to deal with every day, all the family’s social
contacts to attend to, from Her Grace at the Palace and princes and dukes and other
high-ups down to other families like our own, thousands of taels of silver to approve
the spending of - and you want to go bothering her for some hair-oil! My advice to
you, madam, is to be a bit more patient. After all, your marriage to Mr Lian was
rather a hole-and-corner affair, wasn’t it? It’s only because of Mrs Lian’s unheard of
generosity that you have been treated so well. A less tolerant person might have
turned you out into the gutter - and not much you could have done to stop them!’
At the end of this verbal drubbing Er-jie could only hang her head in silence. If that
was what other people thought about her, minor inconveniences like the lack of
hair-oil would have to be endured.
But that was not the end of it. Following this outburst, Mercy began to grow more
and more careless about serving Er-jie’s meals. Either they came much too early or
much too late, and the food she brought consisted invariably of stale old left-overs.
Er-jie once or twice tried speaking to her about it, but Mercy only glared at her and
lifted her voice up in noisy self-justification. Fearing that if the others heard the
shouting they would think of her as one of those vulgar, shrewish women who are
always quarrelling with their servants, Er-jie felt obliged to drop the matter and put
up with the hardship as best she could.
After a week or so Xi-feng came to visit her. She was all smiles and loving sympathy,
‘my dear’ this and ‘my dear’ that.
‘If the servants are not giving you satisfaction, my dear, or are being insubordinate,
do let me know and I shall have them beaten.’
She turned and spoke harshly to the maids and older women who were present.
‘I know you lot. I know how you bully the gentle ones. It’s only the hard ones like
me that you are afraid of. Once out of my sight you think you can get away with
murder. But take care! If I hear one word of complaint from Mrs Er, I shall have you
slaughtered!’
Er-jie was impressed by the concern that Xi-feng showed for her.
‘With her to stick up for me,’ she thought, ‘there is really no need for me to do
anything myself. Servants often are insolent. If I speak up about this girl and get her
into trouble, people will say that I lack the forbearance that a wife - especially one in
my position - is always supposed to show.’
And so, far from complaining, she covered up for Mercy and the other servants and
insisted that the service they gave her was satisfactory.
*
All this time Brightie was making inquiries on Xi-feng's behalf into Er-jie's background.
He quickly established that Er-jie had indeed been previously betrothed. Her
affianced, now a young man of nineteen, was a gambler and a wastrel. After
gambling his way through all his family's possessions, he had been turned out of
doors by his father and now made the gambling-dens his home. The fact that his
father had been to see Mrs You and received twenty taels from her in return for
breaking off the engagement was still unknown to him. The name of this
unpromising youth was, as Joker had said, Zhang Hua. When Brightie passed this
information on to Xi-feng, she promptly wrapped twenty taels up in a packet and told
him to go back and promise them to Zhang Hua if he would bring a written
indictment against Jia Lian before the court. It should say that Jia Lian had, in a
period of both national and private mourning and without the knowledge or consent
of his parents, brought unlawful pressure to bear on the plaintiff's parents, causing
them to break off an existing engagement between the plaintiff and his betrothed,
and had then, setting his own wife aside in an unlawful manner, taken to wife the
plaintiff's betrothed in her stead.
A strong instinct of self-preservation at first prompted Zhang Hua to refuse. When
Brightie told Xi-feng this she was furious. A young idiot, she called him; a lame dog
who wouldn't allow one to help him over the stile.
‘You will have to explain it to him very carefully. Tell him he can charge this family
with high treason for all I care; all I want is a pretext for making it hot for them. But
tell him that if things show any sign of getting too hot, I am perfectly well able to cool
them down again.’
Another idea occurred to her as Brightie was on the point of leaving.
‘He could put your name on the indictment,’ she said. ‘Then you could go along to
the court and answer it yourself.’
She gave him careful instructions as to what in that event he should say and do,
assuring him that she would be able to handle the consequences herself. Confident
of her support, Brightie persuaded Zhang Hua to write out an indictment in which he
himself would be named.
‘ “Lai" is the surname,’ he said. ‘Put “Brightie Lai was principal agent of the
accused.” You can say that everything Mr Lian did he was put up to doing by me.’
What Brightie was now proposing seemed to Zhang Hua much less risky than what
he had suggested previously, and after some preliminary discussion about the exact
form that the indictment should take, he wrote it out and went along with it next
morning to the Court of Censors to ‘cry injury’ on the steps outside. An usher came
out to relieve him of it and take it inside to their lordships, and in due course the
court came into session and the presiding Censor found himself reading a bill of
indictment in which a certain ‘Brightie Lai, servant of the above’ appeared as chief
accomplice of the accused. Under the circumstances it seemed most expedient to
have ‘Brightie Lai, servant of the above’ summoned before the court.
Somewhat overawed by the prospect of making an arrest in Rong-guo House, the
blackcoats sent one of their number ahead of them with a message; but Brightie,
who was expect?ing the summons, intercepted the messenger and was outside in
the street waiting for them when they arrived. He stepped forward and offered
himself to them with a disarming smile.
‘I’m afraid you have been troubled on my account, gentlemen, for I think I must be
the person you have come for. Here you are: slip your chain on!’
He stretched his neck out in readiness; but the blackcoats declined.
‘That’s all right, brother. You just come along quietly. Nobody’s going to put any
chains on you!’
When Brightie arrived in the court he knelt down facing the tribunal, side by side
with Zhang Hua but at a little distance away from him. The Censor ordered him to be
shown the indictment, and Brightie, although he had virtually dictated it himself,
affected to study it very carefully. When he had finished doing so, he handed it back
again and kotowed.
‘I know all about this, my lord. It’s true what it says there about my master, but it
wasn’t really anything to do with me. Zhang Hua has only dragged me into it because
he has a personal grudge against me. The person who put my master up to all this
was someone else. Your Lordship ought to ask him about this other person.’
It was Zhang Hua’s turn now to kotow.
‘There is another person involved, my lord, but I didn’t dare to accuse him, so I put
one of the servants’ names instead.’
Brightie pretended to be indignant.
‘Tell his lordship who it is, you fool! This is a court of law we are in and one of the
Emperor’s judges you are speaking to. You’ve got to tell him the name of the person,
no matter who it is.’
Zhang Hua admitted that Jia Rong was the person in question, whereupon the Censor,
very much against his inclination, had to issue a summons for Jia Rong.
Xi-feng had secretly sent her page Cheerful to the court to see if the case was going
forward. When he came back to her with this news, she hastily sent for a member of
her father’s household called Wang Xin, explained to him what had been happening,
and told him to see the Censor on her behalf. He was to persuade the Censor to give
Jia Rong a good scare, but not to proceed to any damaging judgement against him.
She also gave him three hundred taels with which to streng?then his persuasion.
That night Wang Xin saw the Censor in his private chambers and obligingly supplied
him with a little ‘background infor?mation’ to the case. The Censor had a pretty good
idea of what was expected of him. He took the proffered bribe with? out demur and
agreed that at the next hearing it would almost certainly be discovered that Zhang
Hua was a thoroughly worthless character who had brought these trumped-up
charges against the Jias because he owed them money and could not pay it back.
Wang Xin also obtained a brief interview with the President of the Court of Censors
at his private residence. The President was an old friend of Xi-feng’s uncle, Wang
Zi-teng. He had observed that the defendants in this case were all members of the Jia
family and was most anxious that it should be disposed of as expeditiously and with
as little fuss as possible. He had made no recommendation for special action against
the defendants as holders of commissions under the Crown, but merely confirmed
what the Censor of the day had already decided: that Jia Rong should be summoned
and should be required to answer the indictment.
By this time Xi-feng’s discovery and Er-jie’s removal into Prospect Garden were
already known about in Ning-guo House, and Jia Rong and his father were anxiously
discussing this latest development in Jia Lian’s affairs when someone arrived to give
warning of the impending summons and urge them to think quickly what they would
do. Jia Rong, who had gone into the front part of the mansion to receive the
messenger, came rushing back in a panic to tell his father.
‘The man has an infernal nerve!’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I thought I’d taken sufficient
precautions against anything like this happening.’
He sealed two hundred taels up in a packet and sent it as a sweetener to the Censor.
At the same time he ordered one of his senior domestics to go and answer the
summons. He and Jia Rong were still discussing this new crisis when a cry went up
that ‘Mrs Lian of Rong-guo House’ had arrived. This was a most unpleasant surprise.
Father and son both attempted to make a getaway, but Xi-feng was already inside the
courtyard before they could disappear.
‘Ah, the head of the family!’ she called after the elder of the two retreating backs.
‘You’ve been putting your cousin up to some nice tricks lately, haven’t you?’
Jia Rong, as a junior, was obliged to go back and greet her. She seized him by the
hand and marched on, with him in tow, towards the interior of the mansion.
‘Take good care of your aunt, Rong,’ Cousin Zhen called out after them. ‘Tell them
to slaughter some fresh meat for her dinner.’
He called for his horse and went off to hide himself elsewhere.
Xi-feng walked through into the main sitting-room inside. You-shi came out of the
inner room to greet her.
‘What is it, Feng?’ she asked, observing Xi-feng’s ugly expression. ‘Something has
upset you.’
Xi-feng spat in her face.
‘Nobody else wanted that precious sister of yours, so you had to foist her onto our
family. Anyone would think all the other men in the world had died and only our Jia
ones were left! But even if you’d set your heart on marrying her to a Jia, at least you
might have done it properly, with go-betweens and witnesses and everything open
and above-board. At least we should all have known where we were then and been
able to keep up some sort of appearances. I can’t think what could have come over
you. Was it some phlegm that got into your heart? Was it rouge you’d swallowed,
clogging up your thinking-tubes? Just what was it that made you think you could
marry her to him at a time like that - a time when he was in double mourning: state
mourning and family mourning? Now, thanks to you, we’ve got someone suing us: so
even the people in the law-courts know what a jealous shrew I am and I have to sit
by as helpless as a crab with no legs while total strangers discuss my character and
wonder why my husband doesn't divorce me. What have I done wrong since I came
to this place that you should want to treat me like this? Is it something that Grandma
or Aunt Wang said that has made you set this trap for me, to get me out of the way?
Let’s go to court together, the two of us, and state our cases; and after that, let’s
come back here and ask for a family council so that we can have it all out into the
open, face to face. You can give me a bill of divorce then if you want to, and I shall go
back to my own people.’
She began to cry noisily, tugging at You-shi’s arm and insisting that she should go
with her to court. Jia Rong, in a desperate attempt to dissuade her, threw himself
down on his knees and knocked his head repeatedly on the floor, entreating his aunt
to ‘control her rage’. Xi-feng let go of You-shi and rounded savagely on Jia Rong.
‘Black-hearted villain! May God’s lightning strike you and the devils tear your
carcase! You’re as stupid as mud, and yet you are forever meddling and interfering in
what doesn’t concern you, forever busybodying away at your dirty, scoundrelly little
plots that in the end will ruin your family and destroy the lot of us. Nobody wants
you - even the ghosts won’t want you when you die, your own mother’s ghost or the
ghosts of your ancestors. Don’t you dare tell me what I ought to do!’
And she began beating him. Jia Rong redoubled the frequency of his kotows.
‘Please, auntie, please! Don’t give way to anger. Don’t think only of what has just
happened: try to remember the good things as well as the bad. I may be very wicked,
but surely in a thousand days there must have been one day when I was good! I
know you have every reason to be angry with me, but there is no need for you to
punish me yourself. I will gladly do it for you if it will help you to overcome your
anger.’
He spread his arms out to left and right of him and began to deal himself hefty slaps
upon both cheeks, prefacing each blow with an interrogation, thus:
'Are you going to go on doing these stupid, meddlesome things in future?' (slap!)
‘Are you going to go on listening to Uncle instead of doing what Auntie tells you?’
(slap!)
‘How can you bear to be so cruel and unnatural to Auntie, when Auntie has always
been so good and kind to you?' (slap!)
The others felt like telling him to stop playing the fool. They also felt like laughing,
but did not dare to. Xi-feng threw herself upon You-shi's bosom, weeping and wailing
in a fine display of histrionic grief.
‘I don’t mind your finding him another wife, but why was it necessary to make him
break the law? Why did you let him do it without his father knowing? And why did
you have to destroy my reputation while you were about it? You and I must go to the
court together before the blackcoats come here and arrest us. After that we can go
next door and have it all out in front of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and all the
rest of the clan. If it’s found that I am an undutiful wife who refuses to let her
husband take a concubine, you can give me a bill of divorce and I shall leave without
a murmur. As a matter of fact I have invited your sister here myself. I haven’t dared
tell Grandmother and Lady Wang about her yet because I was afraid they would be
angry. At the moment she is living in the Garden, like a princess, with nothing but the
best to eat and servants to wait on her hand and foot every minute of the day.
Meanwhile I’ve been getting an apartment ready for her at home which will be
exactly the same as my own. I’d been meaning to move her in there as soon as
Grandmother had been told about her. I was prepared to live in peace and harmony
with her and Lian and to let bygones be bygones. But now it turns out that all the
time she was betrothed to somebody else! What a mess you’ve made of things! Of
course, I knew nothing about this before. When they told me yesterday that I was
being sued, I was panic-stricken. I knew that even if I appeared in court to answer the
charge myself, it was the Jia family that would be disgraced. So I’m afraid I took five
hundred taels of Lady Wang’s money without telling her, to bribe the Censor with.
And even after that, he still has my servant there in custody.’
All this was spoken not as continuous discourse but punctuated by fits of weeping. In
her final outburst the weeping turned almost into a scream as she began invoking her
parents and her ancestors and threatening to hang or drown herself or batter her
brains out against a wall. You-shi, whom all this time she had not let go of, was so
mauled and crumpled that she was beginning to take on some of the aspects of a
piece of well-kneaded dough and various parts of her clothing had become damp and
discoloured with the moisture from Xi-feng’s eyes and nose. As there was nothing
much she could say in answer to Xi-feng, she shouted at Jia Rong instead.
‘Stupid little fool! A fine mess you and your rather have made of things between
you! I said at the time that no good would come of this.’
Xi-feng took You-shi's head in both her hands and, drawing her face close to her own,
pretended to inspect the inside of her mouth.
‘Who’s stupid? There isn’t an aubergine in here. I see no sign of a gag. Why couldn't
you have come and told me? If you had told me about it at the time, none of this
would ever have happened. But no, you have to wait until it has got into the
law-courts and the whole household is in an uproar, and now you start blaming them!
There’s a very old saying: “A good lining gives a garment strength and a husband with
a good wife has few calamities.” If you’d been a good wife to Zhen, he and the others
would never have got up to this mischief. You haven’t the wit to k anything useful;
and as for saying - for all the good sense that ever comes out of your mouth you
might as well be a bottle! You seem to think that you have only got to sit tight and do
nothing and people will praise you for your virtue!’
She spat two or three times in quick succession.
‘I did try,’ said You-shi tearfully. ‘The others here will tell you, if you don’t believe
me. I tried very hard to dissuade them. It’s not my fault that they wouldn’t listen.
What was I supposed to do? But I don’t blame you for being angry. It’s just one more
thing that I shall have to bear.’
All the Ning-guo concubines, maids and womenservants were by now silently
entreating for their mistress, so that the room seemed suddenly to have filled with
row upon row of kneeling figures. The most senior of the servants now smilingly
addressed Xi-feng on her mistress’s behalf.
‘You’re generally such a wise, understanding person, Mrs Lian: even though our
mistress is at fault, you ought not to be too hard on her - leastways, not in front of us
servants. You and our mistress have always been such good friends. Leave her a bit of
face now, please!’
She handed her a cup of tea, but Xi-feng dashed it to the floor. After a bit she did,
however, stop crying and rolled up her hair, which had come undone. But the tone in
which she addressed Jia Rong was still an angry one.
‘Go and fetch your father. There’s something I want to ask him to his face. I want to
ask him about this new rule which says that a man may marry when he is in
mourning, barely thirty-five days after his uncle’s death. It’s something I’ve never
heard of before. I should like him to tell me about it so that I shall be able to teach it
to the younger generation.’
Jia Rong kotowed and remained upon his knees.
‘This business had nothing to do with either of my parents,’ he said, ‘I was the one
who put Uncle up to it. I don’t know what came over me; I must have been out of my
mind. My rather knows nothing about it. If you insist on having it out with him, he
will undoubtedly kill me. I’d rather you punished me yourself - in fact, I should
welcome it. As for the lawsuit, I’m quite incapable of handling a big thing like that
myself. One “bides a broken arm inside one’s sleeve”: surely you, of all people, know
that, Auntie? You’ve got a very silly nephew, I’m afraid, and he has done a very silly
thing. There’s nothing for it, you will just have to deal with the matter for us, as you
would if your cat or your dog had done something naughty and you had to clear up
after it. Imagine you had a good-for-nothing son like me who had got himself into
terrible trouble: wouldn’t you still go on caring for him, in spite of all the suffering he
had caused you?’
He concluded by kotowing again and looked as if he might go on doing so indefinitely.
His pathetic abjectness soon melted Xi-feng; but she could not change her tune too
abruptly when there were so many pairs of eyes watching her. She did not answer
him, therefore, but merely raised him up with a sigh and, wiping her eyes, addressed
herself once more to You-shi.
‘You must forgive me, kinswoman. It’s because I am so young and inexperienced.
When I heard that there was someone suing us, I simply lost my head. That’s why I
have been behaving so badly. As Rong says, “One hides a broken arm inside one’s
sleeve”: I must ask you to forget all those nasty things I was saying just now and have
a word with Zhen on my behalf to see if he can’t get this lawsuit settled out of court.’
‘Certainly.’
‘Of course.’
In their eagerness to reassure her, You-shi and Jia Rong answered her simultaneously.
‘Whatever happens, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong, ‘I promise you that Uncle Lian won’t be
involved. You mentioned just now that you had already had to spend five hundred
taels on this case. Mother and I will certainly find some way of making that good. We
can’t possibly allow you to be out of pocket because of this. That would be
unthinkable. We must ask one thing of you, though. Do, please, cover up for us at the
other house. Please don’t let Grandma and Lady Wang get to know about this!’
Xi-feng answered him scornfully.
‘You were willing enough to go over my head when you planned this thing in the
first place. Now that it’s gone wrong and you need someone to cover up for you,
you’ve decided that you need me after all. I may be stupid, but I’m not that stupid!’
Again she ignored him and addressed herself to You?shi. ‘Your Cousin Lian is my
husband, don’t forget. You all say that you acted as you did out of your concern that
he should have an heir. Well, don’t you think I share in that concern myself? I look on
your sister as if she were my own. I was so happy when I first heard about her and
Lian that I couldn’t sleep all night. I wanted the servants to start decorating a room
for her immediately, so that I could have her to come and live with us. But you know
what servants are. They told me I was too hasty and that I ought to tell Grandmother
and Lady Wang first. I certainly wasn’t going to take that advice, and I threatened
them with all sorts of pains and penalties if they said anything about it to anyone
themselves. Unfortunately my threatening was of no avail. Just as I thought I’d
succeeded in hushing the matter up, the very worst thing happened: a person called
Zhang Hua suddenly popped up out of nowhere and brought a lawsuit against us. I
was so scared that for two nights I didn’t sleep a wink. I didn’t dare tell anyone else
about it. All I could do was to get the servants to try to find out who this Zhang Hua
was and what it was that had made him so bold. After two days investigating they
came back and told me. It seems that he is a thoroughly worthless character - a
down-and-out. “Mrs Er is this man’s betrothed,” they said. “At the present moment
he is so hard up that sooner than die of hunger and cold, he is prepared to do almost
anything. This lawsuit is simply a last desperate attempt to make some money. He
reckons that even if he dies in the attempt it will be a better death than starving.
Anyway,” they said, “you can hardly blame him for trying. The master really has been
a bit hasty: marrying during a period of national mourning is one offence; marrying in
a period of family mourning is another; marrying without parental con?sent is a third;
and marrying bigamously is a fourth. They say that the man sentenced to death by a
thousand cuts will dare to pull the Emperor off his horse. A man like this Zhang Hua
who is crazed by poverty will do anything. With such good arguments in his favour,
he’d be a fool not to sue!” Well now, I ask you! Even if I’d been a forensic genius,
which I’m not, hearing them say that would have been enough to shut me up. What
could I do? Lian was away. There was no one at hand to advise me. All I could think of
was to try and buy him off. But the trouble is, the more you give to people like that,
the more they twist the knife in you and think up more and more pretexts for getting
money out of you. And I am like a boil on a mouse’s tail: there’s a limit to what can
be squeezed out of me. It was because I was feeling so desperate that I -’
‘Don’t worry about the money,’ You-shi and Jia Rong both chimed in, not waiting
for her to finish. ‘That’s something we can certainly take care of for you.’
‘If Zhang Hua is only suing because he wants money,’ said Jia Rong, ‘I think I can
now see what to do. We must promise him money on condition that he will admit
that the charges he brought against us were false ones. Of course, we shall have to
spend a bit of money to see that he isn’t too heavily proceeded against; but once the
case has been dismissed and he has been released, all we have to do is give him the
money we promised, and that should be the end of it.’
Xi-feng tutted and looked amused.
‘Brilliant! No wonder you made such a mess of your match-making if this is the way
you go about things! I always thought that you were intelligent, but I see now that I
was wrong. If we do as you suggest, he will pretend to agree, the case will be called
off, and that will appear to be the end of it. But don’t you see, if you put money into
the hand of a fellow like that, he will get through it in about four or five days and
then think up some other villainy as a means of getting more? Even though we have
nothing to fear from him, he will still be a constant source of worry. What you
propose in any case plays straight into his hands, because it enables him to say that
we must have something to be ashamed of or we wouldn’t be offering him money.’
Jia Rong was a sharp young man and quickly saw what his aunt was driving at.
‘I’ve got another idea,’ he said. ‘Perhaps I should be the one to clear this mess up
after all, since I am the one who got us into it. I shall ask Zhang Hua straight out what
his inten?tions are. Is it definitely Aunt Er he wants, or is he willing to make do with
someone else if we will give him the money? If it is definitely Aunt Er and no one else
will do, I shall simply have to break it to her that she must go and join him.’
‘That’s all very well, but I don’t want to part with your Aunt Er,’ said Xi-feng
hurriedly. ‘In fact, I refuse to hear of it. Even suppose she were willing, what would
people think of us if we allowed her to go? No, I think we must keep her, even if it
means giving him more money.’
Jia Rong knew perfectly well that although Xi-feng said this, she was secretly longing
to get rid of Er-jie and was merely anxious that if she did so it should be with her
reputation for womanly virtue untarnished. He deemed it safest not to dispute with
her, however, but merely to agree with everything she said.
‘This outside part of the business should not be too hard to settle,’ said Xi-feng. ‘In
the long run it’s here at home that we are going to have the difficulty. Hadn’t you
better come with me to explain all about this to Grandmother and Lady Wang?’
This threw You-shi into another panic. She seized Xi-feng by the hand and earnestly
entreated her to think of some lie which would obviate this necessity.
‘If you are not capable of dealing with the consequences, you ought not to do these
things in the first place,’ said Xi-feng coldly. ‘Really! It quite disgusts me to hear you
bleat like this! Oh well. I wasn’t going to help you out of this fix, but I am such a weak,
soft-hearted creature. I suppose I shall have to. You’d better stay out of this, then. I’ll
take your sister on my own to make her kotow to Grandmother and the ladies. I shall
say that this is your sister and that I have taken a great fancy to her. I shall tell them
that because I haven’t so far managed to give Lian a son, I had been thinking of
buying two girls to serve him as chamber-wives, but that since seeing your sister I
had thought how much nicer it would be to have her instead as his Number Two and
keep it all inside the family. Then I shall say that since her mother and sister died she
has been living in very reduced circumstances and would have found it impossible to
hold out on her own until the end of the hundred days mourning, so I have taken it
upon myself to invite her here to live with us. I shall tell them that I’ve already had a
room made ready for her and would like her to move in there as a temporary
measure until the mourning period is over and she is allowed to sleep with Lian. All
lies, of course, but I am sufficiently brazen to get away with them. Even if there is any
trouble, I promise that it shan’t come near you. Well, what about it? Do you think
that will do?’
You-shi and Jia Rong were all smiles.
‘Very handsome of you, and very resourceful, too. But then you always were both
of those things. When this affair is safely out of the way, we shall come round and
make you a kotow.’
‘Fiddlestick! I don’t want your kotows,’ said Xi-feng. ‘She pointed her finger at Jia
Rong. I know you now for what you are.’
Her face reddened as she said this, and for a moment she seemed on the point of
tears. Jia Rong put on his most winning smile.
‘Come on now, forgive and forget, won’t you, just this once?’
He knelt once more, but she turned her head away and ignored him. He got to his
feet again, still smiling.
You-shi made the servants bring a basin of water and a vanity-box, so that. Xi-feng
could wash her face and hands and comb her hair, and gave orders to hurry on the
dinner. Xi-feng insisted that she must go back, but You-shi was equally insistent that
she should stay and eat with them.
‘If you go off now like this, how shall we ever have the face to visit you at your
place in the future?’
Jia Rong added his own smiling persuasion.
‘Come on, Auntie! I promise that in future I shall serve you as a truly devoted
nephew, strike me dead if I don’t!’
Xi-feng gave him a look.
‘Pshaw! Who believes -?’
     But she did not finish.
The maids and old women had been busy meanwhile laying the table. You-shi made
a selection from the dishes with her own chopsticks to put on Xi-feng’s plate and Jia
Rong knelt down beside her and offered her a cupful of wine. When Xi-?feng and
You-shi had eaten, a maid served them with tea to rinse their mouths with and then
with a better tea to drink. After a couple of sips of the latter, Xi-feng rose to go. Jia
Rong saw her all the way back to her own place.
As soon as she was back, Xi-feng went into the Garden to tell Er-jie about these latest
developments. She told her how worried she had been when she heard about the
lawsuit, and what she had found out as a result of her inquiries. Then she explained
what had to be done now in order to ensure that none of the others got into trouble.
But if you want to know how Xi-feng’s plan turned out in the event, you will have to
read the following chapter.
CHAPTER 69

A scheming woman kills
with a borrowed knife
And one who has ceased to hope
swallows gold and dies



Er-jie was full of gratitude when she heard what Xi-feng was planning to do for her
and gladly accompanied her to the inner mansion. You-shi, feeling that - in spite of
what had been agreed - she could hardly stay away when her own step-sister was
being formally presented to the family, went along with them, on the express
understanding that she herself would say nothing and that, in the event of there
being any opposi?tion, Xi-feng would take sole responsibility.
When the three of them arrived in Grandmother Jia’s apartment, the old lady was
talking to Bao-yu and the girls - such conversations, enlivened by much joking and
laughter, being nowadays her principal source of amusement. Seeing Xi-feng come in
accompanied by a beautiful young woman, she screwed up her eyes and peered at
the latter with curiosity.
‘Well now, who is this charming young person?’
‘Have a good look, Grandma,’ said Xi-feng, taking Er-jie by the hand and drawing
her forwards. ‘Tell me what you think of her. - Quick, make your kotow!’ she
whispered to Er-jie. ‘This is Lian’s grandmother.’
When Er-jie had completed her obeisance, Xi-feng pointed to each of the cousins in
turn and told her their names.
‘You can make your curtseys to them later, after you have been to see Their
Ladyships,’ she said.
Er-lie had to greet each of the cousins by name, as if she were meeting them for the
first time. After that she stood, with head demurely lowered, to one side.
Having studied her face for some moments, Grandmother Jia raised her head to think,
but presently gave up with a laugh.
‘It’s no good,’ she said. ‘I can’t think who it is. But I’m sure I’ve seen her somewhere
else before.’
‘Never mind about that, Grandma,’ said Xi-feng laughing. ‘Just tell me what you
think of her. Is she prettier than me?’
Grandmother Jia put on a pair of spectacles.
‘Bring the child a little closer,’ she told Faithful and Amber. ‘Let me have a look at
her skin.’
Amid suppressed titters from the others present, Er-jie was hustled forward.
Grandmother Jia looked her up and down very carefully.
‘Hold her hand out,’ she said to Amber. ‘Let me look at her hand.’
When the hand had been inspected, Grandmother Jia took off her spectacles and
laughed.
‘Flawless. Yes, she’s prettier than you.’
Xi-feng laughed too, then, kneeling down, proceeded to repeat, more or less word for
word, what she had told You-shi she would say.
‘Will you be very kind and let her stay here, Grandma? She wouldn’t begin living
with Lian until next year, when she is out of mourning.’
‘Yes, that’s perfectly all right,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Very good of you to have
suggested it. I’m very glad. Provided, as you say, that she and Lian don’t start sleeping
together until next year.’
Xi-feng kotowed. Then she asked Grandmother Jia if she would mind deputing two of
her women to take Er-jie round to see Lady Xing and Lady Wang, and whether it
would be all right for them to say that Er-jie was being installed on Grandmother Jia’s
initiative. The old lady consented and Er-jie was led off to see the other ladies.
Xi-feng’s failure to take adequate steps for procuring her husband an heir had for
some time now been a source of anxiety to Lady Wang, for she knew that her niece’s
reputation must be suffering as a consequence. She was therefore delighted, when
Er-jie was presented to her as Jia Lian’s new concubine, to learn that it was Xi-feng
herself who was responsible for the arrangements. Now that Er-jie’s union with Jia
Lian had been brought into the open, it was possible to move her from the Garden
into the apartment in Xi-feng’s courtyard that had been prepared for her.
Meanwhile Xi-feng’s agents were secretly inciting Zhang Hua to claim his affianced
wife, promising that she would come to him with a generous trousseau and that they
would give him a substantial sum of money to set up house with. It was no easy task
persuading him, since from the very start he had had little stomach for this case. His
apprehensions seemed justified when, in answer to the summons, Jia Rong's
repre?sentative eventually appeared in court and made the following statement:
‘Zhang Hua had already broken off his engagement with the young lady before she
entered our house. She did so, in any case, merely as a kinswoman, already related to
the family by her sister’s marriage. There was never any talk of forcing her into
matrimony. Zhang Hua trumped up this case against my master because my master
was attempting to recover some money owing to him which Zhang Hua was unable
to pay.’
The Censor, whose past connections with both the Jia and Wang families, not to
mention the substantial bribe he had pocketed only the night before, inclined him to
accept this as a reliable version of the facts, ruled that Zhang Hua was a person of
untrustworthy character, driven by destitution to make a number of malicious and
defamatory accusations against the defendants, none of which could be
substantiated. The charges in the indictment were dismissed and Zhang Hua was
sentenced to be flogged and driven from the court. By distributing money in the right
quarters, Cheerful was able to ensure that the flogging administered was a light one
and got to work again on Zhang Hua as soon as it was over.
‘There’s no question you were betrothed to this girl. If you go back and tell them
that it’s the girl you want and nothing else, they’re sure to give judgement in your
favour.’
Zhang Hua was induced to do this and the court, after further persuasions from
Wang Xin, did in fact give judgement in his favour.
‘Zhang Hua is to repay the full amount owed by him to the Jia family within the
period specified. But provided that he does so, his affianced wife is to be restored to
him as soon as he is in a position to receive her.’
This judgement was confirmed in the presence of Zhang Hua’s father, who was
specially summoned to the Court of Censors to hear it. When Cheerful explained to
the old man that this meant that he and his son were to get not only the promised
money but also Er-jie and her trousseau as well, he was naturally delighted and at
once went along to the Jia mansion to claim the bride. Xi-feng went in feigned alarm
to report this latest development to Grandm6ther Jia.
‘It’s all the fault of Cousin Zhen’s wife,’ she said. ‘It seems that the Zhang family had
never agreed to break off this earlier engagement, and now they have sued us and
the court has given judgement against us.’
Grandmother Jia summoned You-shi from the other man?sion and rebuked her for
her carelessness.
‘It seems that your sister’s betrothal before she was born to this Zhang person was
never properly broken off, and now his family are suing us. I can’t imagine what you
thought you were at when you made this arrangement!’
‘But it was broken off,’ You-shi protested. ‘They even took our money.’
‘When Zhang Hua was giving evidence, he said he’d never seen any money,’ Xi-feng
chipped in. ‘He said no one had ever approached him about breaking off the
engagement. His father said your step-mother mentioned something about breaking
it off but there was nothing final. He said that when your step-mother died, you
moved your sister in regardless and married her to Lian as his Number Two. No one
present at the time was able to refute those statements, so they were able to get
away with them. It’s a good job Lian hasn’t slept with the girl yet. As far as that goes,
there is nothing to stop her going back to Zhang. The only thing is, it would be a
frightful loss of face for us to let her go again having once moved her in.’
‘Yes, but as you say, Lian hasn’t touched her yet,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It would be
even worse for our reputation to hold on to someone who by rights is somebody
else’s wife. Much better hand her over to him. We can easily find someone else for
Lian.’
‘The engagement really was broken off,’ said Er-jie, and named the date on which it
had occurred. ‘My mother gave the Zhangs twenty taels for doing it. It must be
because they are so hard up that they have brought this case against you. The things
they have been saying are quite untrue. My sister made no mistake.’
It only goes to show how dangerous people like this are to provoke,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘Well, in that case, Feng, you had better go and see what you can
do about it.’
Whatever reluctance she may have felt, Xi-feng was obliged to say that she would.
She had Jia Rong summoned to her room to talk to him about it. Jia Rong knew her
feelings well enough - but after all, how could a family like the Jias really contemplate
handing over one of their women to a beggar? The idea was preposterous. When he
reported the conversa?tion to his father, Cousin Zhen sent someone to have a word
privately with Zhang Hua.
‘Look here, you’ve had a lot of money out of them,’ the man said. ‘Why do you
have to have the woman as well? If you insist too hard, my master is likely to start
getting angry with you, and frankly I wouldn’t give much for your chances if he does.
Why don’t you and your father go back to where you came from? With the money
you’ve already got you’d have no difficulty in finding yourself a very nice little wife,
and if you decide to go away, I can promise you some more money towards your
travel expenses.’
This sounded to Zhang Hua like good advice, and after talking it over with his father,
he agreed that if the money he had already received were to be made up to a total of
one hundred taels, he and his father would undertake to make themselves scarce.
The money was handed over, and father and son rose at four o’clock next morning to
begin the journey back to their native village. As soon as he had made sure of their
departure, Jia Rong went round to tell Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng.
‘Zhang Hua and his father have run away. The charges in the indictment were all
fabricated and they lost their nerve because they thought they were going to be
found out. The court knows all the facts now but has decided not to prosecute. So
that is the end of the affair.’
Xi-feng was not as put out by this as might have been expected.
‘After all,’ she told herself, ‘even if I had insisted on Zhang Hua taking her away,
there was always the possibility that Lian might get back in time to reclaim her. He
would only have had to give Zhang a little money and Zhang would surely not have
refused to give her back. Perhaps it’s just as well that she’s staying here. I have her
here safely under my thumb while I think of some other way of dealing with her. But I
don’t like this idea of Zhang going off nobody knows where. Suppose he talks? Or
suppose one day he finds some means of reopening the case? Everything I have done
up to now will turn out to have been simply working towards my own downfall. Oh, I
should never have put a weapon like this into somebody else’s hand!’
She began to grow more and more worried and eventually thought of a plan. Calling
Brightie to her she told him to find out where Zhang Hua was and procure his death,
either by laying a false accusation of robbery against him and leaving it to the
magistrates and yamen runners to finish him off judicially, or else by employing an
assassin. Only by such root-and-branch methods, she felt, could her fears be allayed
and the threat to her reputation be removed.
Brightie went off agreeing to do what she had asked, but when he got home and had
time to think about it, he began to feel misgivings.
‘The fellow’s already gone away,’ he thought. ‘Surely that’s the end of the matter?
Why does she need to make such a great issue of it? Taking a man’s life is no
children’s game; it’s a serious business. I’ll just have to humour her for the time being
and think of some way out of this later.’
Having so resolved, he went into hiding for a few days before coming back and
reporting to Xi-feng.
‘Three days after Zhang Hua and his father ran away, somewhere near Jing-kou in
the early hours of the morning Zhang Hua was knocked down and killed by a
highwayman for the sake of the money he was carrying. The old man died of a
heart-attack shortly afterwards in a near-by inn. There was an inquest on the bodies
and both of them were buried there, where it happened.’
Xi-feng did not believe him.
‘I’ll probably be sending someone to make inquiries shortly,’ she said. ‘If I find out
that you’ve been lying, I’ll have every tooth in your head broken.’
But in the event she did nothing and let the matter drop.
From that time onwards her demeanour towards Er-jie was affable in the extreme.
No sister could have shown a greater interest in her well-being.
*
A day came when Jia Lian’s business was at last transacted and he was able to start
on his much-delayed journey back home. On his arrival in the city he called in first at
the new house in order to see Er-jie, but he found the place locked and empty with
only an aged caretaker in occupation. When, in answer to his questions, the old man
told him what had happened, he stamped in his stirrups with vexation; but there was
no time for indulging his feelings, for he had shortly to present himself before his
parents and report to them on the successful conclusion of his mission.
Jia She was for once very pleased with him and praised him for his capability. He gave
him a hundred taels as a reward and a seventeen-year-old girl from his own room
called Autumn as a concubine. Jia Lian kotowed to receive his presents. He felt
enormously pleased with himself; but there was a slightly hang-dog expression on his
face when, after he had seen Grandmother Jia and the rest, he appeared once more
before his wife.
To his surprise there were none of the expected recriminations. Xi-feng seemed,
indeed, to have become a different per?son. She came out to meet him with Er-jie at
her side, con?fined herself to questions about his health, his stay in Ping-an and the
journey back home, and made not a single reference to his deception. When the
time came for him to tell her about Autumn, he was unable to prevent a certain
pleased smugness from stealing over his face. At once Xi-feng ordered two of the
married servants to go round in a carriage to collect her. Here was another thorn in
her bosom, even before the first one had been extracted! Yet not a trace of what she
felt was allowed to show itself in her expression. With the same unchanging smile
she ordered a ‘welcome home’ dinner for her husband and took Autumn to make
her kotows to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang. Jia Lian privately marvelled at the
extra?ordinary change that had come over her.
It need hardly be said that Xi-feng harboured feelings about Er-jie very different from
the ones her outward show of friendliness might have suggested. Once or twice
when they were alone together she confided to her (in a sisterly manner, of course)
that her reputation in the family was a very unsavoury one.
‘There is a nasty little story going around, my dear, that you weren’t all you should
have been before you were married. They say you were much too thick with Cousin
Zhen. I’m afraid even Lady Jia and Lady Wang seem to have got hold of it. They are
beginning to ask me why I picked someone whom no one else would have, and why I
don’t put you away and choose somebody more suitable. Needless to say, when I
first heard this story I was flabbergasted. I’ve tried to find out who started it, but I’ve
had no success. Oh, these servants! Just as I thought I’d done something to feel
proud of, I find that I’ve got a fish’s head like this on my plate to contend with!’
Xi-feng’s sympathy for Er-jie was so great that, after telling her all this a couple of
times, her indignation against these anonymous traducers caused her to become
quite ill; she re?fused all food and drink and began to spend the greater part of her
time lying down in her room. The servants, with the sole exception of Patience,
speculated freely about the cause of their mistress’s illness, and Er-jie, though
seldom named, came in for frequent criticism.
Because Autumn had been presented to Jia Lian by his father, she had a very high
opinion of her own importance, showing scant respect for Patience or even for
Xi-feng, let alone for a poor, unwanted creature like Er-jie, who was commonly
known to have been a fallen woman before she married. When Xi-feng noticed this
she was secretly pleased.
Since Xi-feng’s pretended illness, she had ceased to eat with Er-jie, whose meals, on
Xi-feng’s instructions, were now served to her in her own room. Invariably the food
that was given her was inedible. Patience was so disgusted that she took to buying
her things to eat with her own money, or, on the pretext of going for a walk with her
in the Garden, taking her to the Garden kitchen where she could be given nourishing
soups to eat under her supervision. Because it was Patience who did this, none of the
other servants dared to inform against her. Unfortunately Autumn once came upon
them there and, feeling no such compunction, went straight off to denounce her to
Xi-feng.
‘Patience is going out of her way to give you a bad name, Mrs Lian. That Er woman
wastes the good food you give her and goes into the Garden with Patience every day
to sneak food from the kitchen.’
Xi-feng abused Patience angrily.
‘Most people keep a cat to keep down the mice for them. My cat seems to eat the
chickens!’
Patience dared not answer back, and from then on kept away from Er-jie; but she
secretly hated Autumn because of this.
Bao-yu and the girls were privately concerned about Er-jie. Though none of them
would venture to speak out openly on her behalf, they all of them felt sorry for her.
Sometimes, when no one else was about, one or other of them would get into
conversation with her. Invariably she would be crying and wiping her eyes all the time
they were talking to her; but she never uttered a word of complaint against Xi-feng -
indeed, since Xi-feng was careful never to reveal herself in her true colours, it is hard
to see what she could have complained of.
Jia Lian for his part failed to notice that anything was wrong. Since his return he had
been completely taken in by Xi-feng’s show of magnanimity towards her rival; and in
any case he was at present somewhat preoccupied. The sight of his father’s many
maids and concubines had often in the past aroused libidinous feelings in him which
he had perforce repressed; while on her side Autumn had often in the past, by
flutterings of the eyelids and various other signals, ex?pressed a marked interest in
her master’s handsome son. It may be imagined what sort of blaze was kindled in the
brush-wood when two such eager bedfellows were brought together with full
parental approval of their union. Day after day he spent in Autumn’s company –
aye sporting with his new-won bride
in the words of the poet. He seemed, indeed, scarcely able to prise himself away
from her. Gradually, as Autumn became more and more the only centre of his
concern, his former feelings towards Er-jie began to cool.
Xi-feng detested Autumn but was glad to have her as a means of ridding herself of
Er-jie. She would ‘kill with a borrowed knife’ - or rather she would watch the killing
from a safe distance, like a traveller reclining on a mountainside who watches two
tigers tearing each other to pieces in the valley below. And when Autumn had
disposed of Er-jie, Xi-?feng herself would take care of Autumn. Once she had settled
on this strategy, she lost no opportunity, whenever she found herself alone with
Autumn, of stirring her up against her rival.
‘You are so young and headstrong. You ought to be more careful,’ she told her. ‘She
is his second wife, after all. He is very, very fond of her. Even I have to give way to her
a bit. It’s suicide to go constantly provoking her in the way you do.’
This had the desired effect of releasing a stream of abuse against Er-jie, uttered in a
voice that could be heard from one end of the courtyard to the other.
‘You’re too soft with people, Mrs Lian. I wouldn’t behave so meekly if I was in your
place. Where’s all your old authority gone to? You can be forgiving if you like, but if
I’ve got a smut in my eye, I like to get it out. You just let me get at that whore, I’ll give
her a piece of my mind!’
Xi-feng pretended to be too scared of Autumn to rebuke her; but Er-jie, listening in
her room, spent the whole day crying and was too upset to eat. She did not dare to
tell Jia Lian what the matter was when he called in to see her, and next morning,
when Grandmother Jia noticed that her eyes were red and swollen with weeping and
asked her what the matter was, she would not say.
This was just the sort of opportunity that Autumn was waiting for. ‘She’s very good at
putting on this dying duck act,’ she confided to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang
when Er-jie had gone. ‘We get this from her all the time. It’s because she hates
sharing. She wishes that Mrs Lian and I were dead so that she could have Mr Lian all
to herself.’
‘It’s possible to be too attractive,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘They say that a jealous
nature often goes with it. How contemptible to be like that, though - especially when
Feng has gone out of her way to be nice to her! One can see that she has no
breeding.’
From that time onwards she appeared to have taken rather a dislike to Er-jie; and the
servants, when they sensed that Grandmother Jia did not like her, were only too
ready to press forwards and trample on her themselves. Now indeed life for the poor
young woman became a burden, only occasionally alleviated when Patience, acting
behind her mistress’s back and against her wishes, took up the cudgels on her behalf.
How could so gentle a soul, one of those whom Nature, in the words of the poet,
did out of snow and rose-petals compound,
stand up to the barbarities to which she was now daily subjected? After suffering in
silence for a month, she began to show the symptoms of an illness: there was a
weakness and lassitude in her limbs which made moving them an effort; she could
keep nothing down, either food or drink, and seemed to grow thinner and paler ail
the time; and she could not sleep at night. One night, when she was trying to get to
sleep, San-jie appeared to her, carrying the sword that she had cut her throat with.
‘Sister,’ she said, ‘you always were a silly, weak-willed creature. I knew you would
suffer for it in the end. Don’t trust the honied words of that jealous woman!
Outwardly she seems kind and virtuous, but she is treacherous and cunning
under?neath. She hates you and will never rest until she has brought about your
death. If I had been alive, I would never have allowed you to move inside here; or if I
had, I would never have allowed her to treat you like this. But I was fated to kill
myself and you were fated to suffer here alone. That is our punishment, because in
our past lives our wantonness led other folk astray. Sister, you must do as J tell you.
Take this sword, cut off that jealous woman’s head, and come with me to the tribunal
of Disenchantment to await her judgement. You will die in any case, but if you do not
do as I say, you will have died for nothing and no one will feel sorry for you.’
‘Sister,’ said Er-jie, weeping, ‘my whole life has been sinful. You yourself say that my
present sufferings are a punishment. Why should I add the crime of murder to my
other sins?’
San-jie left her sorrowfully, and Er-jie, waking up with a start, realized that she had
been dreaming.
     Next time Jia Lian came to see her she had a tearful disclosure to make.
     ‘This illness I am suffering from will not get better. It is half a year now since I
came to you and already I am with child. It might be the son you want, though of
course we cannot know that until it comes. If Heaven is merciful, I hope I may live
long enough to bear it; but I fear I may die before, and the child with me.’
     ‘You mustn’t worry,’ said Jia Lian, weeping himself. ‘I’ll get a first-rate doctor to
cure this illness.’
     He lost no time in sending for one. Unfortunately the Dr Wang of the Imperial
College who had attended Grandmother Jia and other members of the family in the
past was at present with the Imperial Army in the field (he had some hopes of a
baronetcy on his return) and the pages sent out to summon him ended up by calling
in a colleague of his called Hu Jun-rong - that same doctor, in fact, who had been
called in to attend Skybright a year or two previously. After taking Er-jie’s pulses he
informed Jia Lian that her trouble was ‘irregularity of the menses caused by
anaemia’.
     ‘But are you sure she isn’t pregnant?’ said Jia Lian. ‘It’s three months now since
she had a period, and she is suffering all the time from morning-sickness.’
     When he heard that, Hu Jun-rong asked the old women in attendance if he
might have Er-jie’s arm again. It was thrust out through the curtain and he spent a
long time feeling the pulses in it a second time.
     ‘It’s true that in a case of pregnancy the pulse from the liver would be a strong
one,’ he said finally. ‘On the other hand wood in the ascendant generates fire, which
can by itself cause the drying up of the menstrual fluid: so a strong liver pulse may be
indicative only of an irregularity in the menses and not of pregnancy. I wonder if I
might have a look at the lady's face? Before I finally decide on the right treatment, I
should like to see what sort of colour she has.’
The request was an unusual one, but Jia Lian felt he had no choice but to grant it. The
bed-curtains were drawn back a few inches and Er-jie thrust her head out through
the slit. The vision thus presented to him seemed to deprive the doctor temporarily
of his senses, so that it is doubtful whether he was able to make any observations of
diagnostic value while he was goggling at it. After a moment or two the curtains were
drawn to again and Jia Lian accompanied the doctor outside and once more asked
him for his opinion.
‘It isn’t pregnancy,’ said the doctor. ‘There is some clotted blood which is holding
back the natural discharge. The important thing is to disperse the clot and get her
men?struating again.’
He wrote a prescription out and took his leave. Jia Lian sent someone to pay him and
also to purchase the drugs named in his prescription. The medicine was made up,
infused and taken. From about midnight Er-jie began to suffer from con?tinuous
abdominal pain, and after what seemed hours of agony, produced a foetus already
sufficiently developed to be recognizable as a male child. This was followed by
continuous bleeding in the course of which she fainted away.
Jia Lian cursed Hu Jun-rong bitterly when they told him. He sent someone
immediately to call another doctor. He also sent someone to look for Hu Jun-rong;
but Hu Jun-rong, having got wind of what had happened, had already packed his bags
and disappeared.
The new doctor was not encouraging.
‘Obviously your lady’s constitution was not very robust to start with. It looks to me
as if in the course of her pregnancy she must have been subjected to some sort of
emotional dis?tress resulting in a congestion of the pneuma. By mistakenly attacking
this with a far too drastic dispersant, I am afraid the previous consultant has done a
lot of damage. The vital essence has been eighty or ninety per cent impaired. As
things look at present, I am afraid I really cannot guarantee a cure. I propose a
treatment using both liquid and solid medicines simultaneously. If you can make
quite sure that she neither sees nor hears anything likely to upset her during the
treat?ment, there might be some hope of improvement.’
Having given his diagnosis he departed, but not before writing out two prescriptions,
one for an infusion and one for some pills.
Jia Lian was beside himself. He insisted that the culprit responsible for calling in Hu
Jun-rong should be discovered, and had him beaten within an inch of his life. But Jia
Lian’s distress was as nothing compared with the transports of grief displayed by
Xi-feng.
‘It is beginning to look as if we are fated not to have a son,’ she lamented. ‘To think
that a doctor’s incompetence should ruin everything, just as we were so near to
having one!’
She had a little ‘altar to Heaven and Earth’ set up on which she burned incense and in
front of which she knelt down and prayed with the utmost fervency for Er-jie’s
recovery.
‘Let me be ill instead of her,’ she prayed. ‘Only let You-shi’s sister get well again and
bear us a man-child, and I vow to spend all my remaining days in prayer and fasting.’
Jia Lian and all the others who saw her and heard her pray were filled with
admiration.
While Jia Lian and Autumn were alone together, Xi-feng had all sorts of soups and
invalid slops made specially for Er-jie. She even sent the characters of Er-jie's nativity
to a fortune-teller to have her fortune told. The fortune-teller sent word back that
Er-jie’s stars were temporarily in collision with those of some other female born
under the sign of the Rabbit. A rapid investigation revealed that Autumn was the only
person in the household born under that sign. It was her astral influence that was
harming Er-jie.
The sight of Jia Lian rushing agitatedly about, calling for doctors, ordering medicines,
dispensing curses and floggings among the servants, and in general showing a most
singular devotedness to Er-jie, had already caused Autumn's system to secrete
several gallons of vinegar. Her jealous fury when she was informed that Er-jie’s illness
was due to her influence and when she was urged by Xi-feng to move elsewhere for a
few days in Er-jie’s interest can be imagined.
‘Who pays any attention to what those beggarly swindlers tell you?’ she said. ‘It’s
all rubbish anyway. How can I have any influence on her? I have nothing to do with
her.
The water in the well
And the water in the sea:
I’ve naught to do with you
Or you to do with me.
Precious little darling! She saw plenty of all sorts when she was living outside. She
didn’t suffer from any influences then, why should she start suffering from them now,
I wonder? Anyway, there’s something I’d like to ask her. I’d like to ask her where she
got that child from. She may fool that cotton?eared master of ours. As long as she
gave him a child, it would be all one to him whether it was a Zhang or a Wang. But do
you really care about that whore’s brat, Mrs Lian? I’m damned if I do! What’s so
special about having a baby? Give me a year or ten months and I’ll have one myself -
and it won’t have half the city for its father, either!’
The servants hearing her were at some pains not to laugh. It happened that Lady Xing
had come over that day to pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Autumn took the
opportunity of complaining to her.
‘Mr and Mrs Lian are trying to drive me out of here. I don’t know which way to turn.
Put in a good word for me, Your Ladyship, I beg of you!’
This led Lady Xing to give Xi-feng a severe telling-off, after which she proceeded to
give a piece of her mind to Jia Lian.
‘Ungrateful wretch! Whatever the girl’s like, she was given to you by Sir She. Fancy
trying to turn her out for the sake of an outsider! Have you no respect for your father
at all?’
She walked off in a huff, giving him no opportunity to explain. Autumn, now
thoroughly cock-a-hoop, stood outside Er-jie’s window and favoured the world at
large with an expanded and even more abusive version of what she had said earlier
to Xi-feng. Er-jie, lying inside, heard every word of it, as she was meant to, and was
deeply distressed.
That night, when Jia Lian and Autumn were in bed together and Xi-feng was asleep in
her own room, Patience went to see Er-jie and tried to comfort her.
‘You must try to get well,’ she said. ‘Don’t take any notice of that animal.’
Er-jie clutched her hand. She was crying weakly as she replied.
‘Sister, you have been so good to me, ever since I came to this place. I don’t know
how much unpleasantness you haven’t had to put up with on my account. If I come
out of this alive, I promise I shall do my best to repay your kindness. I fear I shan’t,
though. I shall have to try and repay you in another life.’
Patience could not help crying too.
‘All these things that have happened to you - it’s all my fault. I was so stupid. I
always told myself that I’d never deceive my mistress, and so when I heard about you
and Mr Lian living together outside, I thought I had to tell her. I never thought it
would all turn out like this.’
‘You’re wrong to blame yourself,’ said Er-jie. ‘She would have found out sooner or
later, even if you hadn’t told her. It was only a question of time. And anyway, I wanted
to come here. I wanted so much to be respectable. It really had nothing to do with
you.’
The two young women wept a while in silence. Once more Patience tried to comfort
her and urged her to get better; then, because it was long past midnight, she left her
to go and get some sleep.
After Patience had gone, Er-jie lay thinking.
‘This illness seems to have got its grip on me. I’m losing rather than gaining all the
time. It doesn’t look as if I shall ever get better. And now that I’ve lost the baby,
there’s nothing much left for me to live for. I don’t have to put up with all this hatred
and malice. Why don’t I just die and get it over with? They say you can die by
swallowing gold. It would be a better way of dying than hanging oneself or cutting
one’s throat.’
She struggled out of bed, opened one of her boxes, and hunted out a nugget of raw
gold. Then she wept a little. It was four o’clock in the morning. Summoning up all the
will-power she could muster, she forced herself to swallow it. She had to hold her
head back and swallow many times before it would go down; but in the end it did.
Then she dressed herself hurriedly in her best clothes, put on her jewellery and
ornaments, laid herself down upon the kang, and sank at once into unconsciousness.
Hearing no call from her next morning, the maids - Xi-feng and Autumn having gone
off to Grandmother Jia’s place for their morning duty - were only too pleased to get
on with their toilets undisturbed. Patience was disgusted by their callousness and
reproached them bitterly.
‘What you girls need is a really hard-hearted mistress - one who would curse you
and beat you every day. There’s a sick woman in there: can’t you feel any sympathy
for her at all? Even though she’s so easily put upon, I’m surprised you don’t show her
a little consideration, if only for appearance’s sake. “Everyone helps to push over a
falling wall” they say; but don’t you think you carry it a bit too far?’
Shamed by her reproaches, the maids pushed open Er-jie’s door and went inside to
look. They found her dressed up in all her finery and stretched out dead upon the
kang. Their frightened screams brought Patience running in as well. She could not
help weeping out loud when she saw the cause. The other servants, too, when they
remembered how sweet and gentle Er-jie had been and how unfailingly kind to her
inferiors, were moved to tears by her death, but they were all so scared of Xi-feng
that they dared not let her see their tears.
Soon everyone in the household had heard the news. When Jia Lian arrived he clung
to the corpse and wept uncontrollably. Xi-feng made a show of weeping too and
hypo?critically reproached Er-jie for her ‘cruelty’.
‘Hard-hearted sister!’ she wailed. ‘How could you bear to leave me like this when
you knew how much I cared for you?’
You-shi and Jia Rong also came and wept a while, after which they urged Jia Lian to
cease his lamentations and begin to perform his duties. The first of these was to
report Er-jie’s death formally to Lady Wang and ask if he might lay out the body in
Pear-tree Court for five days and after that move it to the Temple of the Iron
Threshold. Lady Wang gave her permission, whereupon he at once sent servants to
open up Pear-tree Court and make the principal room in it ready to receive the
corpse.
Jia Lian did not like the idea of Er-jie’s leaving the mansion for the last time by way of
the rear gate and into the back streets beyond. He therefore opened up the gate in
the outer wall of Pear-tree Court giving on to the passage-way between the two
mansions which led into Two Dukes Street. Awnings were put up on either side of
this gate to accommodate sūtra-chanting monks.
A beautifully-embroidered satin pall was draped over a camp-bed and Er-jie’s body
laid on it and covered over with a sheet. On this it was carried by eight pages,
followed by a number of married womenservants, along the foot of the inside walls
and all the way to the room in Pear-tree Court which had been made ready for it. The
official geomancer had been summoned and was waiting there in readiness. He lifted
the coverlet back to look at Er-jie’s face. She looked almost alive - if anything even
more beautiful than in life. The sight provoked a fresh outburst of grief from Jia Lian.
Once more he clung to her and wept.
‘My poor wife!’ he sobbed. ‘You should never have died. I blame myself for
allowing this to happen.’
Jia Rong nervously urged restraint.
‘There, there, Uncle! Take it easy! She was unlucky, poor Auntie. That’s all you can
say about it.’
He pointed in the direction of the wall separating Pear-tree Court from the mansion.
Jia Lian, understanding his meaning, lowered his voice, though he continued to
reproach himself.
     ‘I was too careless. I should have noticed what was going on.’ He addressed
himself to the dead woman. ‘One of these days I shall get to the bottom of this and
you shall be revenged.’
At last the coverlet was replaced and the geomancer made his pronouncement.
‘I am assuming that she died at the end of the fifth watch. In that case you won’t
be able to take her out of here on the fifth day, I’m afraid. It will have to be either the
third or the seventh. For the encoffining, the best time would be four o’clock
tomorrow morning.’
‘The third day is much too soon,’ said Jia Lian. ‘It will have to be the seventh. I
couldn’t keep her here much longer than that, because my uncle and my cousin are
both away and I should need to have their permission; but I am planning to do much
more for her when we get her to the temple outside. I’d like to keep her there for the
full thirty-five days and give her a really decent funeral with a requiem and so forth at
the end of it. We can take her south to Nanking and bury her in the family graveyard
next year.’
      The geomancer agreed to all this, wrote out the burial licence, and took his
leave.
Various male kinsmen - Bao-yu was the first - came over to help Jia Lian mourn.
When they had gone, he went back to his own apartment to look for Xi-feng and ask
her for some money to buy timber for a coffin with and pay for the funeral.
Now Xi-feng had used her illness as a pretext for not accompanying the others to
Pear-tree Court. She claimed that she had received strict instructions from
Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang that until she had fully recovered she was to avoid
all places connected in any way with birth, sickness or death. She refused to go into
mourning for the same reason. The ban did not however prevent her from slipping
out into the Garden when everyone else had gone, making her way round it between
the rocks and the perimeter wall to the foot of the wall that separated it from
Pear-tree Court, and eavesdropping on what was going on inside. She could not hear
very much, but enough to send her scurrying back to Grandmother Jia to report on
what Jia Lian was up to. Grandmother Jia was indignant.
‘I never heard such nonsense! When a consumptive child dies, one just burns it and
scatters the ashes. Burying her in Nanking indeed! What can the man be thinking of?
If he feels he has to do something special for her because she was his wife, let him
observe the Thirty-Five Days. But after that he should either have her carried out and
burned or else buried in the common graveyard. Nanking, indeed!’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘That’s what I thought, but it wasn’t for me to say.’
Just then a maid arrived from Jia Lian, looking for her.
‘Mr Lian’s back, madam. He’s waiting for you to give him some money.’
Xi-feng went back to see him.
‘What’s this about wanting money?’ she asked him. ‘Don’t you know how difficult
things are lately? Every month now our allowance falls short of our expenditure. I
managed to raise three hundred taels yesterday to pay some of the bills with by
pawning two of my gold necklaces. There’s still twenty or thirty taels of that left that
you can have if you like.’
She told Patience to get it out and give it to him; then, muttering something about
Grandmother Jia having something more to say, she went away again, leaving Jia Lian
speechless with resentment. He was obliged to go through Er-jie’s drawers and
cupboards looking for the savings he had entrusted to her. But someone seemed to
have been through them before him, for all he could find were a few bits of broken
jewellery and a few far from new silk dresses. The sight of these clothes which she
had worn brought on another outburst of anguished weeping. He felt sure there was
something suspicious about her death but dared not utter what he thought. He made
the things up into a bundle and was appar?ently intending to take them outside and
sell them, for he had called no servant, and when Patience saw him was carrying the
bundle himself. She found the sight of him carrying it both pathetic but also a trifle
ludicrous. Hurriedly abstracting a packet containing two hundred taels of
miscellaneous bits and pieces of silver from one of Xi-feng’s chests, she drew him
into one of the side rooms where no one could see them and gave it to him.
‘Psst! Not a word! And by the way, if you want to cry, you can cry as much as you
like outside, but for goodness’ sake don’t make an exhibition of yourself here, where
everyone can see you!’
‘You are right,’ said Jia Lian, taking the money. He handed her a skirt out of the
bundle. ‘Here, take this. It’s something she often used to wear. Keep it to remember
her by.’
As he was insistent, she took it from him and put it away with her things.
Now that Jia Lian had some money, he sent someone to buy timber for the coffin.
Unfortunately the best planks turned out to be too expensive and the more modestly
priced ones did not meet with his approval. In the end he got on his horse and
insisted on going to see for himself. The outcome was that a set of planks costing five
hundred taels and obtained by him on credit were delivered from the
timber-merchant’s that evening. The carpenters were set to work on them
immediately and ordered to go on working through the night so that the coffin
should be ready in time.
He ordered some of the servants to dress in mourning and keep vigil at Er-jie’s side.
He himself did not return to his own apartment that evening, but spent that and
every other night of the seven at Pear-tree Court. Towards the end of this sojourn he
was somewhat surprised to receive a summons from Grandmother Jia.
The reason for the summons will be revealed in the chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 70

Lin Dai-yu resuscitates
the Poetry Club
And Shi Xiang-yun tries her hand
at a song lyric
Each of the seven nights following Er-jie’s death were spent by Jia Lian on his own in
Pear-tree Court. Throughout the whole of the seven-day period he had Buddhist
monks and Taoist priests chanting arid praying outside for her soul’s repose.
At the conclusion of the last chapter we mentioned the unexpected summons which
he received towards the end of this period from Grandmother Jia. It turned out to be
for the sole purpose of refusing him permission to convey Er-jie’s body to the family
temple outside the city. This was a heavy blow, but one to which he could not but
submit. He had to talk to the proprietor of the ground in which San-jie was buried
and have another grave opened for Er-jie above her sister’s. Apart from a few Jia
males and You-shi and her daughter-in-law, the only other mourners on the day they
buried her were Xi-feng’s kinsman Wang Xin and his wife. Xi-feng herself would have
nothing to do with the funeral and left Jia Lian to manage everything by himself.
The New Year was now approaching. Among the multitudinous duties that had now
to be attended to was the necessity of finding suitable wives from among the
maidservants for those of the menservants who had reached the marriageable age of
twenty-five. Xi-feng consulted Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang on this subject and a
lengthy discussion of it ensued. Several maids were of an age to marry, but for one
reason or another had to be exempted. The first of these was Faithful, who had taken
a vow to remain single all her life. Ever since the day on which she took this vow she
had refused even to speak to Bao-yu and had taken to using make-up only sparingly,
dispensing altogether with jewellery, and wearing only the very soberest clothes. The
others respected her determination and did not press her to abandon it. Amber had
to be exempted because she was ill. Sunset, too, since her break-up with Jia Huan,
had developed an illness that seemed incurable and had to be exempted for the
same reason. There remained only a few of the older maids-of-all-work from
Xi?feng’s and Li Wan’s apartments. The other maids were all too young. It was
decided to allow the young menservants to seek their brides outside.
*
Xi-feng’s illness, necessitating their standing in for her as household managers, had
for many months deprived Li Wan and Tan-chun of their leisure. That, and the
multifarious duties attendant on the New Year festival, had resulted in the indefinite
postponement of the Poetry Club. Now spring had come and at last there was time
for a meeting. But now it was Bao-yu’s condition that prevented them. Liu
Xiang-lian’s conversion and subsequent disappearance, San-jie’s suicide, Er-jie’s
hounding to death by Xi-feng, the grave deterioration in Fivey’s health caused by the
hardships of her night’s imprisonment - all these shocks and distresses following hard
upon one another had eventually reduced him to a state of mental collapse. He was
beginning to look and act like a half-wit and his speech was frequently disordered
and nonsensical. Aroma and the other maids were frightened out of their wits. They
dared not tell Grandmother Jia about it; instead they did what they could to distract
him by amusing him and making him laugh.
Early one morning he woke up to the sound of laughter, peals upon peals of it from
the neighbouring room. Aroma smiled at him when she saw that he was awake.
‘It’s Aventurin,’ she said, giving Parfumee the name that Bao-yu had insisted on.
‘You’d better go and rescue her. She’s got Skybright and Musk holding her down and
tickling her.’
Bao-yu slipped on his squirrel-lined gown and went into the outer room to look. The
three girls were on the kang, their bedding still not folded and none of them yet
dressed. Skybright, wearing only a tunic of leek-green Hangchow silk and a pair of red
silk drawers and with her hair hanging loose over her shoulders, knelt above
Parfumee’s body, straddling her as if riding a horse; Musk, wearing little but a red
breast-binder and an old gown that she had wrapped round herself like a cloak, was
tickling Parfumee under the armpits; Parfumee herself, in flower-patterned shirt, red
trousers and green stockings, lay on her back drumming her heels on the kang and
laughing so much that she seemed in some danger of asphyxiation.
‘Two big ones against one little one,’ said Bao-yu, laughing. ‘I shall have to see
about that!’
He got on the kang and began tickling Skybright. Skybright, being very ticklish, at
once began shrieking and let go of Parfumee in order to tickle him back, which gave
Parfumee the opportunity of getting on top of her and holding her down. Aroma
stood watching these antics with amusement.
‘Why don’t you get dressed, all of you?’ she said. ‘It won’t be so funny if you catch
cold.’
At that moment Casta came in.
‘Mrs Zhu thinks she left a handkerchief here last night. Have any of you seen it,
please?’
‘Yes,’ said Swallow. ‘I picked it up off the floor, but I didn’t know whose it was. I’ve
only just washed it and hung it out to dry. I’m afraid it won’t be dry yet.’
     Casta was greatly amused by the four figures struggling on the kang.
‘You’re certainly a lively lot here, larking about like this so early in the morning!’
     Bao-yu disengaged himself to talk.
     ‘Don’t you lot ever play, then? There are enough of you.’
     ‘Mrs Zhu isn’t much of a one for playing,’ said Casta, ‘and she keeps a pretty
tight rein on the others - Miss Qin and the two Miss Lis. It’s very quiet there now that
Miss Qin is sleeping over at Her Old Ladyship’s again. It will be quieter still next
winter when the two Miss Lis go back to their own home. Look how quiet it’s
become at Miss Bao’s place since Caltrop went back to Mr Pan. It’s as though several
people had left. Poor Miss Shi is quite lost without her!’
By coincidence it was Xiang-yun’s maid Kingfisher who walked in just at that moment.
She had a message for Bao-yu.
‘Miss Shi says come quickly, Master Bao. They’ve got a very good poem for you to
look at.’
‘Who have?’ said Bao-yu. ‘What sort of poem?’
‘The young ladies. They’re all together in the Drenched Blossoms Pavilion. You’ll
see when you get there.’
Bao-yu rushed through his toilet and hurried outside to join them. He found Dai-yu,
Bao-chai, Xiang-yun, Bao-qin and Tan-chun clustered round the sheet of paper on
which the poem was written.
‘Have you only just got up?’ the girls jeered when they saw him coming. ‘We’ve all
been up for hours!’
‘It’s more than a year now since our Poetry Club met,’ said one of them, ‘yet in all
that time no one seems to have felt the urge to get it going again. Springtime, when
everything in nature is renewing itself, seems an appropriate time for reestablishing
it.’
‘Yes,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘We founded it in the autumn, which is a time of decay.
Perhaps that’s why it didn’t thrive. If we reestablish it now, when everything is
burgeoning, it is bound to flourish! And this “Flower of the Peach” is such a splendid
poem: I think we ought to rename our club “The Peach-flower Club”. What do the
rest of you think?’
‘I think it’s an excellent idea,’ said Bao-yu. ‘May I see the poem?’
‘Let’s all go and see Farmer Sweetrice and discuss this business of reviving the
Poetry Club with her,’ said the others.
They got up in a body and began to go, Bao-yu reading the poem as he went.
The Flower of the Peach
Peach pink the tender flowers outside the window blow;
Peach pink on sleepy face the morning colours glow.
Tree-flowers outside the room and lady-flower inside:
Only a few short steps the flowery forms divide.
Slyly the conspiring wind tugs at the blind below:
Tree-flowers would peep inside if they could do so.
*
Outside the window tree-flowers are blooming still;
Inside the window lady-flower looks ill.
If the flowers could understand, surely they would grieve?
The anxious wind flaps the blind against the window-sill.
*
                   The anxious wind flaps the blind; spring crowns the courtyard trees;
Spring sights fill the lady’s eyes, but bring her heart no ease.
In her closed, untrodden court the moss grows green on the stones:
She leans there at the sunset hour, in the soft evening breeze.
*
In the soft breeze the lady’s face is wet with many a tear.
Her silken peach-skirt billows out, the peach-trees to be near.
The peach-flowers and the peach-leaves nod in a rich array:
The leaves, against the peach-pink, dark emerald appear.
A thousand trees, ten thousand trees, crowding close together,
Walls and buildings everywhere in a red mist smother.
*
Heaven’s new bed-spread is burning on the dawn loom of the skies:
It’s time now for sleeping lady-flower from dreams of spring to rise.
Her maid comes in with a golden bowl as she leaves her coral bed,
And the peach-pink stain from her sleepy face the chilly water dyes.

*
If with the water’s rosy hue comparison be made,
Carmine tears and dewy flowers seem of the self-same shade.
Yet lady’s tears and flowers in this unalike I find,
That the flowers are still and smiling, but the tears flow unallayed.
As she gazes on the smiling flowers, her tears at last grow dry;
But as they dry, the springtime ends and the flowers fade.
*
The flowers fade, and an equal blight the lady’s fair cheek palls.
The petals drift; she is weary; and soon the darkness falls.
A nightingale is singing a dirge for the death of spring,
And moonlight steals through the casement and dapples the silent walls.
Bao-yu uttered no word of praise when he had finished reading it, he simply went on
staring stupidly at the paper, He wanted to cry, but was ashamed that the girls should
see his tears and brushed them away with a hurried movement of his hand.
‘How did you get hold of this poem?’ he asked them.
‘First guess who wrote it,’ said Bao-qin mischievously.
‘River Queen,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who else?’
‘Really?’ said Bao-qin. ‘Well, as a matter of fact, I did.’
‘I don’t believe you,’ said Bao-yu, smiling back at her. ‘The tone of voice is entirely
different from yours.’
‘That just shows how little you know about poetry,’ said Bao-qin. ‘Not all of Du Fu’s
poems have the complexity of “Autumn Thoughts”. He is equally capable of lines like
Rain-fattened plum-buds crimson splashed,
Or
The wind’s green duckweed-trails on the water bright.’
‘That’s as may be,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I don’t believe Cousin Chai would allow you to
write such melancholy verses. And in any case, though I am sure you have the talent
to write verses like this if you wanted to, I don’t believe you would want to. Cousin
Lin writes like this because she has had actual ex?perience of grief.’
The girls all laughed.
They had now reached Sweet-rice Village. Li Wan was shown the poem and - it goes
without saying - was full of praise. After some discussion it was decided unanimously
that the first meeting of the revived Poetry Club should be held the very next day,
which as it happened, would be the second of the third month. The club was to be
renamed ‘The Peach-flower Club’ and Dai-yu was to be its presi?dent.
Next day, as soon as lunch was over, everyone met in the Naiad’s House and began
discussing the question of a subject. Dai-yu proposed that each of them should
compose a hundred couplets on ‘Peach-blossom’.
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said Bao-chai. ‘Even if we succeeded in writing so many, there
have been such a lot of poems written on this subject in the past that we should be
sure to find ourselves repeating what has been said before; and we couldn’t in any
case do anything to equal your “Flower of the Peach”. Think of something else.’
But just at that moment a servant came in from outside and summoned them away.
‘The elder Lady Wang is here. Will you all come over to pay her your respects,
please.’
So off they trooped to talk to Wang Zi-teng’s wife. They had to stay and have dinner
with her and after that show her over the garden. It was lighting-up time before she
went.
Next day was Tan-chun’s birthday. Yuan-chun had sent two little eunuchs well in
advance of the date with her presents (various ornaments for Tan-chun’s room).
There were presents from all the other members of the family as well, of course, but
we will spare the reader a list. After lunch Tan-chun had to change into her most
formal clothes and go around all the apartments making her kotows.
‘My poetry dub seems to have got off to rather a bad start,’ said Dai-yu ruefully. ‘I’d
forgotten about her birthday. Today and tomorrow will be completely taken up with
it. Even though there will be no formal birthday with players and so forth, we are
sure to have to spend all day in the front with Grandmother and Aunt Wang. There’s
sure not to be any time left for a meeting.’
She postponed the meeting until the fifth.
On the morning of the fifth, after lunch, while the girls stood talking with
Grandmother Jia, letters from Jia Zheng arrived. Bao-yu brought them with him when
he came to make his regular morning call. He opened the one addressed to his
grandmother and read it out to her. Most of it was taken up with greetings and
inquiries about her health, but there was also something about returning to the
capital some time in the sixth month. There were other letters in the same packet
dealing with personal or domestic matters which were opened and read by Jia Lian
and Lady Wang. Everyone was of course delighted to hear that he was coming back
so soon.
But once again the Poetry Club was fated to be unlucky. Not long before this date the
betrothal had been announced of Wang Zi-teng’s daughter to the Marquis of
Bao-ning’s son (the wedding to be in the fifth month) and Xi-feng had lately taken to
spending three or four days in a row at the Wang residence, helping her aunt with
the entertaining occasioned by this important event. As ill luck would have it, when
Wang Zi-teng’s lady called to collect Xi-feng on the fifth, she insisted that all her
other nephews and nieces should come too and spend the day ‘enjoying themselves’
at her place. Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang decreed that Bao-yu, Tan-chun, Dai-yu
and Bao-chai should go as a representative selection. It was out of the question to
object that they had better things to do; the four of them had to go back to their own
rooms and change into their most formal clothes before accompanying Wang Xi-feng
and their aunt to the Wang family residence. It was lighting-up time before they
returned.
As soon as he got back to Green Delights, Bao-yu threw himself down to rest. Aroma
seized the opportunity to offer him a little serious advice. He really must try and pull
himself together, she said, and apply himself whenever possible to his books, so as to
be ready for his father’s return. Bao-yu did some rapid calculations on his fingers.
‘It’s a bit early for that yet,’ he said.
‘It isn’t only the books,’ said Aroma. ‘Your calligraphy is even more important. Even
if you can get by on the books, what are you going to show him when he asks to see
your calligraphy?’
Bao-yu smiled unconcernedly.
‘I’m always doing calligraphy. There must be masses of it. Surely you keep it for me,
don’t you?’
‘Certainly we keep it for you,’ said Aroma. ‘I got it out to have a look at only
yesterday, while you were away. Five hundred and sixty sheets: for all the years since
you first started, that’s all you’ve got to show. If you ask me, I think that from
tomorrow onwards you ought to concentrate all your energies on copying. If you
could copy two or three sheets of calligraphy a day, then by the time he gets back,
even though you won’t be able to show him a sheet for every day, you should have
enough to get by with.’
Bao-yu heard her with some alarm. He had a look at the collected sheets himself. It
was true. There simply wasn’t enough there to convince anyone that he had been
practising calligraphy every day.
‘All right,’ he said. ‘Beginning from tomorrow, I’ll write a hundred characters every
morning.’
He was still discussing this when they went to bed.
Next morning, as soon as he had washed and combed his hair, he sat down at the
window and began painstakingly copying kai-shu, characters out of a sample-book.
Grandmother Jia thought he must be ill when he did not appear with the others for
his duty-call, and sent someone over to inquire. Bao-yu returned with the messenger
to wish her good morning and explain.
‘I’ve been practising calligraphy,’ he told her. ‘That’s what’s made me late.’
Grandmother Jia was delighted.
‘Keep it up, my boy! When you are studying or practising your calligraphy, it doesn’t
matter if you don’t come here at all. You may tell your mother I said so.’
Bao-yu went round to Lady Wang’s apartment to do so. His mother was
unimpressed.
‘It’s too late to begin sharpening your weapons on the field of battle,’ she said.
‘Getting in a panic now will do you no good. Even if you work all day and all night,
you won’t be able to make up for all the time you have wasted. More likely all you
will succeed in doing is making yourself ill.’
‘I’ll be all right,’ said Bao-yu.
Bao-chai and Tan-chun, who happened to be present, reassured her.
‘We can’t memorize his texts for him,’ they said, ‘but we could at least help him out
with his calligraphy. If each of us copied a sheet of characters for him every day to
add to what he has done himself, he ought to have enough calligraphy to get by with.
That’s one hurdle at least he’d be over. It would save Sir Zheng from getting angry
and Bao-yu from making himself ill.’
Lady Wang smiled and nodded.
When Dai-yu heard that Jia Zheng was coming home, she knew that he would be
sure to ask Bao-yu about his lessons and that anything which distracted him from
them would be merely adding to his troubles. Because of this she deliberately made
no more mention of the Poetry Club, and in order that he should not suspect her real
reason for dropping it, pretended that she was beginning to find the whole thing
rather a bore.
Tan-chun and Bao-chai each produced a sheet of characters a day to add to his
collection, and Bao-yu himself, by doubling the time he spent on calligraphy,
managed to produce two hundred or sometimes as much as three hundred
characters a day. By the end of the third month he had already added considerably to
his stock of sheets.
One day towards the end of the month he was going over this stock and had just
estimated that fifty or sixty more sheets would probably be enough, when
Nightingale arrived with a roll of something from Dai-yu. On opening it out he found
it to consist of several sheets, all of the same dark-yellow bamboo paper, covered
with tiny ‘fly’s-head’ kai-shu characters which she had copied, in a hand very similar
to his own, from sample-books of Zhong Yu’s and Wang Xi-zhi’s calligraphy. Bao-ya
was so pleased that he clasped his hands and made Nightingale a bow before
hurrying over to thank her mistress in person.
Shortly after that he received some more sheets of calligraphy that Xiang-yun and
Bao-qin had been copying for him. Now, when he put the whole lot together, he
found that, though there was nothing like a sheet a day for every day since he first
started, there was already a sufficient quantity to get by with. This was a great relief.
He could now forget about calligraphy for the time being and concentrate on revision.
His aim was to go three or four times over each of the texts.
While he was still busily engaged in this revision, a tidal wave hit a certain part of the
coast, causing damage and loss of life in a number of neighbouring communities.
After reading the reports sent in by the local authorities, the Emperor issued a
Rescript commanding Jia Zheng to visit the area on his way back in order to supervise
relief. It now seemed unlikely that he would be able to reach home before the end of
the seventh month. When he heard this, Bao-yu threw aside his books and reverted
to the drifting, aimless way of life that was customary with him.
Spring was now almost over. Xiang-yun, feeling rather bored, had been watching the
drifting willow-floss and amusing herself by composing a little poem about it. It was a
song-lyric, in the form of a Ru-meng-ling:
‘Not chewed-off ends of the sky’s embroidery?
‘What are they?’ - ‘Raise the blind a bit and see.’
A white hand snatches some and draws it in,
Pursued by the swallows’ chiding din.
Oh stay, oh stay!
The lovely spring drifts after you away.
Xiang-yun was rather pleased with her little poem and wrote it out on a slip of paper
to show Bao-chai. After that she went to look for Dai-yu and showed it to her. Dai-yu
read it and smiled.
‘It’s good. Both charming and original.’
‘We’ve never done song-lyrics at any of our poetry meetings,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why
don’t you call a meeting for to?morrow and we’ll all do some? It would make a nice
change.’
Dai-yu was becoming infected by Xiang-yun’s enthusiasm.
‘It’s a good idea,’ she said. ‘I will.’
‘It’s a lovely day today,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why not have the meeting today?’
‘I don’t see why not,’ said Dai-yu.
She told the servants to prepare some suitably dainty things to eat, while a couple of
them went off to summon the other cousins to the meeting. Meanwhile Dai-yu and
Xiang-yun agreed that ‘Willow Floss’ should be the subject of the poems and decided
on the stanza-patterns that they should conform to. All this was written down on a
sheet of paper which was pasted up on the wall. When the cousins arrived, they first
of all read the notice on the wall and then read Xiang-yun’s poem. Some little time
after that was devoted to praising it.
‘I’m not much good at song-lyrics,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but I suppose I had better do what
I can.’
Everyone drew lots then to see which stanza-forms they were to use. Bao-chai lit a
stick of Sweet Dreams incense, and then everyone settled down to think. Dai-yu was
the first to have something ready and write it down. Just as she had finished, Bao-qin
began hurriedly writing hers.
‘I’ve thought of mine,’ said Bao-chai, ‘but I’d like to look at yours first before I show
it to you.’
Tan-chun laughed.
‘Why does the incense seem to be burning so quickly today? I’ve only done the first
half of mine.’ She turned to Bao-?yu. ‘How about you? Have you done yours yet?’
Bao-yu had in fact written a few lines of one, but, feeling dissatisfied with what he
had written, had crossed it all out and begun again, by which time the incense had
almost burned itself out.
‘Bao-yu’s failed to make the grade as usual,’ said Li Wan, laughing. ‘But what about
Miss Plantain?’
Tan-chun promptly began to write down what she had composed. The others read
the words as she wrote them. It was the first half of a Nan-ge-zi lyric.
Once in the air you start,
    The creatures of the wind, the breezes’ sport,
Not to be bound or held back by any art,
To north and south and east and west
You drift apart.
‘Very good,’ said Li Wan. ‘But why don’t you finish it?’
Bao-yu had been willing to concede defeat. When he saw that the incense was
running out, he could see no point in writing an indifferent conclusion just for the
sake of finishing, and so he had laid down his brush and occupied himself instead in
reading what Tan-chun had written. As he did so, he had a sudden inspiration, and
picking up his brush again, quickly scribbled out a second half for it:
Your drifting fate not fear:
I understand the message that you bear.
    Though orioles mourn and the flowers’ end seems near,
Spring will return, but I must wait
Another year.
The girls were amused.
‘You’re a funny fellow. You can’t do your own, yet you can do someone else’s
without any trouble. It’s very good, but unfortunately it doesn’t count.’
They had a look at Dai-yu’s poem then. It was a Tang-duo-ling.
The pollen is spent in the Island of Flowers;
   From the House of the Swallow the perfume has fled.
    The fluff-balls dance,
Pursue, embrace,
Their floating lives, as our lives, quickly sped’
     That, craving Beauty,
Find it dead.

  The creatures of nature, they too know our sorrow,
Their beauty, like ours, must soon end in decay.
  Our fate, like theirs,
Uncertain hangs,
Wed to the wind, our bridegroom of a day,
  Who cares not if we
Go or stay.
The others admired it, but with reservation.
‘Pity it’s so gloomy,’ they said. ‘Still, there’s no denying, it is very good.’
Then they had a look at Bao-qin’s. She had written a Xi-jiang-yue:
In the Han palace gardens a scatter thin and slight,
But along the Sui embankment in legions falling:
Spring’s three-month handiwork before the wind in flight,
A day-dream of pear-blossom on a moonlit night.

In many a courtyard petals fall through the air,
 And the floss collects like fragrant snow on the casements:
 In North and South the same sight is seen now everywhere;
But for the sad exile most hard to bear.
‘A more virile type of melancholy,’ said the others, laughing. ‘Very typical! That “In
many a courtyard...” couplet is good.’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I think it suffers from the same pessimism as Cousin
Dai’s. Willow floss is a light and airy thing. It seems to me that the best way to avoid
the cliches that this subject invites is to give it a light and airy treatment. That is the
principle on which I have tried to compose my poem; but you may not think I have
succeeded.’
‘Don’t be so modest!’ said the others. ‘It’s sure to be good. Come on, hand it over!
Permit us to admire!’
It was a Lin-jiang-xian that she had written.
In mazy dances over the marble forecourt,
   Wind-whorled, into trim fluff-balls forming –
‘Bravo!’ said Xiang-yun. “‘Wind-whorled, into trim fluff-balls forming”: that line is
better than anything the rest of us have written.’
They read on.
Like fluttering moths or silent white bees swarming:
Not for us a tomb in the running waters,
Or the earth’s embalming.

      The filaments whence we are formed remain unchanging,
No matter what separates or unifies.
Do not, earth-child, our rootlessness despise:
   When the strong wind comes he will whirl us upwards
Into the skies.
They thumped the table enthusiastically.
      ‘Undoubtedly this poem is the best. There is a more haunting melancholy
perhaps in River Queen’s poem and more liveliness and charm in Cloud Maiden’s; but
all in all this is far and away the best poem. This time Little Xue and Plantain Lover fail
to make the grade. We shall have to think of a penalty.’
      ‘That’s fair enough,’ said Bao-qin, laughing, ‘but what about someone who
failed to submit anything at all? What should his penalty be?’
‘Don’t worry about him,’ said Li Wan. ‘He will be punished too – exemplarily!’
      Just at that moment there was a crashing noise outside the window which made
them jump. It sounded as if an outer casement had somehow come unfastened and
fallen into the bamboos. The maids ran outside to look. Other maids, who had been
waiting outside there all the time, told them what it was: a large kite shaped like a
butterfly which had fallen down and got caught in the tops of the bamboo.
‘What a beauty!’ said the maids from inside. ‘I wonder whose it is. They must have
cut the string. Let’s try and get it down.’
‘I recognize that kite,’ said Bao-yu. ‘It belongs to Uncle She’s new girl, Carmine.
Let’s take it down and give it back to her.’
‘There must be other kites like that besides hers,’ said Nightingale. ‘I think it’s silly
to say that it must be hers. Anyway, I don’t care. I’m going to get it down for us.’
‘How mean you are, Nightingale!’ said Tan-chun. ‘You’ve got a kite of your own
already. And if you keep someone else’s, aren’t you afraid of catching their bad luck?’
     ‘You’re right,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We don’t know whose bad luck it mightn’t be
bringing us. Take it away! Let’s take out our kite and get rid of our bad luck.’
Nightingale told the maids, who had by this rime succeeded in getting the kite down,
to take it to the women at the gate and hand it into their keeping. If anyone came
looking for it, they were to give it back to them. The other maids rushed off excitedly
to fetch Dai-yu’s kite. It was the kind called a ‘pretty lady’. While two of them carried
out the kite, one of them brought out a stool to stand on, another fastened the
cross-piece to the raising-stick, and another paid the string out from the winder.
Bao-chai stood with the other cousins at the gate of the courtyard, directing
operations. She told the girls to fly the kite in the open ground outside the courtyard.
‘This kite of yours isn’t nearly as pretty as Cousin Tan’s,’ Bao-qin told Dai-yu. ‘She
has one shaped like a phoenix, with wings that move.’
‘Why don’t you get yours and fly it then?’ Bao-chai said, turning to Tan-chun’s maid
Ebony.
    Ebony hurried off excitedly to do so. Bao-yu, catching the enthusiasm, sent a
maid off to fetch one of his own.
‘Bring the big fish one that Lai Da’s wife sent me yesterday,’ he told the girl.
After a long time gone, the girl came back empty-handed.
‘Skybright flew it yesterday and let it go.’
‘Really!’ said Bao-yu. ‘And I hadn’t even flown it once myself.’
Tan-chun laughed.
‘Never mind! At least she’s got rid of your bad luck for you!’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu to the girl. ‘Go and fetch the big crab one.’
The girl went off and returned accompanied by two or three other maids carrying a
large pretty lady kite and a winder.
‘Miss Aroma says she gave the crab one to Master Huan yesterday. She says why
don’t you fly this one instead? It was sent to you yesterday by Mrs Lin.’
Bao-yu inspected it. The pretty lady was certainly a beauti?fully constructed creature.
He was secretly pleased and told the girls to fly it.
Tan-chun’s kite had also arrived by now and Ebony was already standing on a little hill
getting it up with the assistance of a few helpers. Bao-qin had sent for her kite, a
large red bat, and Bao-chai, beginning to share the excitement herself, had had hers
fetched too: it was a line of seven large geese flying one behind the other. Soon all
the kites but one were up in the air being flown successfully. Bao-yu’s pretty lady was
the exception. He said it was because the maids didn’t know how to do it properly
and insisted on flying it himself; but after a good deal of manoeuvring he could get
her no higher than the roof, and even then it was only to flop down weakly again
upon the ground. Bao-yu was getting into quite a state and the perspiration stood
out in beads upon his brow. The cousins all laughed. At this he became so
exasperated that he picked the kite up, threw it down on the ground again, and
pointed his finger at it in anger.
‘If you weren’t a lady, I’d stamp on you and smash you into pieces!’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘The string isn’t fastened on right. If you could get someone to refasten it for you
properly, it would fly just as well as any other.’
Dao-yu sent someone to take the kite back for restringing and fetch him another
pretty lady that he could fly in the mean time.
All the cousins were now standing with their faces turned upwards, watching the
kites as they soared higher and higher into the sky. A maid came round offering them
all sweets. Pre?sently there was a cry from Nightingale:
‘The wind’s getting stronger, Miss. Do you want to release it now?’
Dai-yu made her handkerchief into a pad for her hand and tested the tension on the
string. The wind was certainly pulling it with some force. She took over the winder
from Nightingale and let it run free, so that the kite could pull itself away in the wind.
There was a whirring noise as the last of the string ran out. Dai-yu asked the others if
any of them would like to cut it for her.
‘No, we’ve all got our own,’ they said. ‘You do yours first.’
   ‘It’s fun to see them fly away,’ said Dai-yu, ‘and yet it seems rather a pity.’
‘But that’s the main reason for flying kites,’ said Li Wan, ‘the pleasure of seeing
them fly away. Not to mention the fact that it is supposed to get rid of your bad luck.
You of all people ought to let yours go, so as to get rid of your illness.’
‘Come on, Miss, you’ve sent plenty of kites off in your time!’ said Nightingale. ‘Why
be so stingy all of a sudden? If you won’t cut it, I’ll cut it for you.’
She snatched a little pair of West Ocean silver scissors out of Snowgoose’s hand and
snipped through the kite-string, an inch or so from the winder.
‘Go away, kite!’ she cried merrily. ‘And take my mistress’s illness with you!’
The kite began to swoop and soar. Soon it appeared no bigger than an egg. A few
moments later and it was only a dot in the sky. Another moment and it had
disappeared from sight altogether.
‘Hurrah! Hurrah!’ cried the cousins, as they watched it disappear.
‘What a pity we don’t know where she will land!’ said Bao-?yu. ‘It would be nice if
she landed somewhere where there are people and some little child were to find her.
But suppose she lands in some uninhabited wilderness: how lonely she will be! I
think I shall send my lady after her, to keep her com?pany!’
He asked for the scissors and cut the string himself, and a second pretty lady went
hurrying after the first one until it, too, disappeared.
Tan-chun was just about to cut the string of her phoenix when another phoenix
appeared in the sky, not far from hers.
‘I wonder whose that is?’ said Tan-chun.
‘Don’t cut yours yet,’ the others cried. ‘It looks as if that one is going to get caught
up in it.’
And that is just what happened. The other phoenix drew nearer and nearer until the
two strings crossed and tangled. The maids were all for winding Tan-chun’s kite in
and capturing the other kite with it, but the owner of the other kite was not
prepared to yield, and after a good deal of tugging and heaving on both sides, the
strings finally snapped and the two phoenixes flew off companionably together. The
cousins clapped their hands delightedly.
‘Well, I’ve released my kite and now I’m tired. I think I shall go in and rest,’ said
Dai-yu.
‘Just wait until we’ve released ours,’ said Bao-chai, ‘and then we can all go.’
So she and Xiang-yun and Bao-qin each cut their kite-strings and watched their kites
fly away, after which all of cousins went back to their own apartments.
*
In spite of the reprieve, Bao-yu dared not abandon his lessons altogether and
continued to do a little revision or calligraphy from time to time. When he was
feeling bored, he would go out to seek the company of the girls, or go round to the
Naiad’s House for a chat. The girls, for their part, knowing how much he was behind
with his work, no longer sent anyone to invite him when they met together for
poetry-reading or other diversions; and Dai-yu, in her anxiety lest he should once
more incur his father’s wrath, frequently feigned sleep when he went round to see
her, so as not to be the cause of keeping him from his studies. Bao-yu was reduced to
spending more and more time in his own room, where work itself now often took the
place of a diversion.
     In this manner the summer gradually wore away. Autumn was just beginning
when one day two of his grandmother’s maids came round in a very agitated state to
summon him.
     The purpose of the summons and the reason for their agitation will be explained
in the chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 71

Lady Xing deliberately humiliates her
Daughter-in-law
And Faithful inadvertently interrupts
a pair of love-birds



It was the news of Jia Zheng’s imminent homecoming that had caused the
maidservants’ agitation. As an Education Officer, Jia Zheng was supposed to report on
his commission as soon as he arrived and, being a very conscientious man, he would
have thought it improper even to look in on his family before doing so. When,
therefore, at the news of his coming, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Bao-yu went out to
the first poststage beyond the walls to welcome him, he merely inquired after his
mother’s health, bowing respectfully in her direction as he did so, and told them to
go back and wait for him at home. After his interview next day with the All-highest,
his mission was formally completed and he could return with a good conscience to
his family. The All-highest had been graciously pleased to grant him a whole month’s
leave of absence in which to rest and recuperate at home.
      Jia Zheng was beginning to age now, and the worries and responsibilities of
office had taken their toll of his health. It was good to be back after so long an
absence from those nearest and dearest to him; he was determined to relax and
enjoy himself to the utmost, refused even to think about money matters or domestic
responsibilities, and spent all his time reading, or, when he felt in need of company,
drinking and playing Go with his literary gentlemen, or enjoying the de?lights of
family life with his wife and mother in the women’s apartments inside.
     This year the third day of the eighth month was Grandmother Jia’s eightieth
birthday. A formidable number of people would have to be invited and there was
even some doubt whether they would be able to accommodate them all.
After discussion by the menfolk of both mansions, it was decided that there should
be eight days of entertaining, beginning on the twenty-eighth of the seventh month
and ending on the fifth day of the eighth on each of these days banquets would be
given in both mansions: in the Ning-guo mansion for male guests and in the
Rong-guo mansion for female ones. The Painted Chamber, Prospect Hall and one or
two other of the larger buildings in Prospect Garden would be used as rest?rooms for
the ladies. The programme of entertaining would be as follows: the twenty-eighth
would be for Imperial kinsmen, Princes and Princesses of the Blood and their
consorts, Royal Highnesses, Serene Highnesses and members of the high nobility; the
twenty-ninth would be for Ministers of State and Civil and Military Governors and
their wives; the thirtieth for official colleagues and their wives and members of other
clans related to the Jia family by marriage; on the first of the eighth month a family
party would be given by Jia She, on the second one by Jia Zheng and on the third one
by Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian; on the fourth a joint entertainment would be given by all
members of the Jia clan irrespective of age and seniority; and on the fifth there
would be another joint enter?tainment organized by Lai Da, Lin Zhi-xiao and the
other senior domestics.
Ever since the beginning of the seventh month presents had been coming in almost
continuously. From the highest source of all an order was received by the Board of
Rites                                                   authorizing the bestowal of the
following:
a ru-yi sceptre of gold and jade four lengths of tribute satin
four gold and jade cups
five hundred taels of silver from the Imperial Treasury
Yuan-chun’s gifts, which were delivered to the mansion by eunuchs, were:
a golden figurine of Old Longevity
a staff of aloeswood
a rosary of putchuk beads
a box of Fu Shou incense
a pair of golden medallions
four pairs of silver ingots
twelve lengths of tribute satin
four jade cups
And there were presents too numerous to mention from princes and princesses and
from the families of a host of civil and military officials both great and small who
were on visiting terms with the Jias. Several long tables were carried into the main
reception hall and covered with red baize and the choicest presents set out on them
every day for Grandmother Jia’s inspection. She went along for the first day or two
and took some pleasure in examining her gifts, but soon grew tired of this and told
Xi-feng to look after them for her: she would look at them herself some other day,
when she had nothing better to do.
      By the twenty-eighth both mansions had been hung with lanterns and
festooned all over with garlands. Painted phoenixes gambolled on folding screens,
embroidered lotuses blossomed on drapes and covers, and the sound of fluting and
piping could be heard several streets away. The only guests that day at the Ning-guo
mansion were the Prince of Bei-jing, the Prince of Nan-an, Princess Yang-chang’s
Consort, the Prince of Luo-shan and a number of noblemen whose families had long
been on friendly terms with the Jias. At the Rong-guo mansion the guests were the
Dowager Princess of Nan-an, the Prince of Bei-jing’s Consort, and the ladies of the
various aforementioned noblemen. Grandmother Jia and the others were dressed in
full court rig to receive them. After the initial salutations were over, the visitors were
conducted to Prospect Hall inside the Garden, where they took tea and ‘changed
their clothes’. From there they were conducted to the Hall of Exalted Felicity, where
they offered formal con?gratulations to Grandmother Jia before finally, after much
polite bowing and deferring, taking their places at the banquet. The Dowager
Princess of Nan-an and the Prince of Bei?jing’s Consort sat at the two central tables
at the back of the hall; the two rows of tables arranged at right-angles to left and
right of theirs were occupied in order of precedence, the Marchioness of Jin-xiang
and the Countess of Lin-an heading the row upon the left, while Grandmother Jia, as
hostess, occupied the first of the right-hand ones. Lady Xing and Lady Wang stood in
attendance behind Grandmother Jia’s chair, with You-shi, Xi-feng and a number of
other Jia ladies fanning out to left and right behind them. Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and Lai
Da’s wife stood by the bamboo curtain on one side of the hall supervising the
transportation of dishes and wine-kettles by a small army of serving-women, while
Zhou-Rui’s wife directed the waitresses from the other side of the folding screens.
Meanwhile the attendants brought with them by the lady visitors were being
entertained elsewhere.
     Outside, on the temporary stage that had been erected in the courtyard, the
players were due to begin their performance. In honour of the occasion they began
by kneeling in a row at the front of it and offering their birthday congratulations to
the old lady, while twelve little maids, dressed up as page-boys in identical costumes,
stood solemnly to attention below the stage. When the players had finished, one of
these little girl-pages advanced to the foot of the steps leading up to the hall with a
playbill in her hands. She was relieved of it by a serving-woman who had been
stationed there for the sole purpose of receiving and carrying messages. This woman
handed it to Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, who put it on a salver, edged herself through the
bamboo curtain, and carried it to Cousin Zhen’s concubine, Lovey. Lovey handed it to
You-shi, and You-shi walked up and offered it to the Dowager Princess of Nan-an. The
Dowager Princess, after first, for politeness’ sake, de?clining, chose one of those
congratulatory pieces which are customarily performed on these occasions. The
Prince of Bei-jing’s Consort, whose turn it was next, did exactly the same. The rest of
the ladies insisted that the players themselves should put on whatever they thought
best, for it was sure to be good.
     After four courses of various dishes and one of soup, the visitors’ attendants
gave their mistresses’ largesse to the players, and the ladies returned to the Garden
to ‘change their clothes’ and sample a very special tea. The Dowager Princess of
Nan-an asked Grandmother Jia about Bao-yu.
     ‘Several temples are reading the Immaculate Diamond for me today,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘He has gone to kneel a while in each one of them while they do
the reading.’
‘And what about your granddaughters?’ said the Princess.
‘Oh, this one is ill and that one is weakly and the other is too shy to see anyone.
They are looking after my room for me today. We have more players than we need,
so I thought we might as well let them have a troupe to themselves. I expect they are
at this moment sitting with their cousins and watching a play in my courtyard.’
      ‘Do send for them!’ said the old princess coaxingly.
      Grandmother turned to where Xi-feng was standing behind her.
      ‘Go and fetch your Cousin Shi and the two Xue girls and your Cousin Lin, will you?
Oh, and you can bring your Cousin Tan with you as well.’
      Xi-feng went to Grandmother Jia’s place. All the girls were there, nibbling sweets
and watching a play, as Grandmother Jia had said they would be. Bao-yu had just got
back from his kneeling. In obedience to her message, Bao-chai, Bao-qin, Dai-yu,
Tan-chun and Xiang-yun followed her back into the Garden and made their curtseys
to the assembled ladies. Some of the guests had seen them before, some had not;
but all alike exclaimed admiringly at their beauty. Of the five girls Xiang?yun was the
most familiar to those present.
      ‘Naughty girl!’ said the Dowager Princess waggishly. ‘You should have come
yourself to see me when you heard that I was here, not waited to be called! I shall
have a bone to pick with your uncle now, next time I see him!’
      She took Tan-chun by one hand and Bao-chai by the other and drew them
towards her.
      ‘And how old are you girls?’ she asked.
      She released them, after several times commenting what ‘fine girls’ they were,
and then subjected Dai-yu and Bao?-qin to the same treatment, taking them by the
hand, scrutiniz?ing each of them in turn, and extravagantly praising their good looks.
      ‘Dear me, they are all such lovely girls!’ she said laughing. ‘I really don’t know
which of them I prefer.’
      Suitable presents had now been made ready by an attendant: five gold rings,
five jade rings and five wristlets of aromatic beads.
‘Rather trifling presents I am afraid, my dears,’ said the Dowager Princess. ‘Perhaps
you could give them to your maids.’
     The five girls kotowed their thanks. There were more presents from the Prince
of Bei-jing’s Consort and from the other ladies present - but there is no need to
enumerate them.
     When they had finished their tea, the ladies walked for a while in the Garden,
after which Grandmother Jia invited them to return to the banquet; but the Dowager
Princess of Nan-an took her leave. ‘To tell you the truth, I am not feeling very well
today,’ she said. ‘I would not have stayed away for the world, but I am sure you will
understand if I leave a little early.’
     Under the circumstances, Grandmother Jia could not very well press her to stay,
and after some polite skirmishing when the Princess protested that she could
perfectly well find her way off the premises alone, the entire company saw her to the
gate of the Garden, where she climbed into her palanquin and was carried away. The
Prince of Bei-jing’s Consort returned with the rest of them to the Hall of Exalted
Felicity and sat with them there for some minutes, but then she too took her leave.
Of the other ladies some stayed on to the end, others left when a decent interval had
elapsed after the departure of the two princesses.
      The day’s entertaining left Grandmother Jia exhausted and next day she was
unable to see anyone and stayed in her own room. Lady Xing and Lady Wang had to
receive the female guests on her behalf. As for the male ones, those of them who
wanted to offer their birthday congratulations had to do so in the outer reception
hall. Their salutations were returned, obeisance for obeisance and bow for bow, by
Jia She, Jia Zheng and Cousin Zhen, who then conducted them to the banquet
prepared for them in Ning-guo House. But that is enough of banquets.
*
       As long as the birthday celebrations continued, You-shi did not go back to the
Ning-guo mansion to sleep. During the daytime she helped the others to entertain
the guests. In the evenings, after some time spent in Grandmother Jia’s apartment
chatting with the old lady, she would help Xi-feng supervise the getting out and
putting away of the porcelain, gold and silver ware and other things that had been
used that day or would be on the next, and the going over and setting out on display
of the most recently-arrived batch of presents. After that she would go to Li Wan’s
place to spend the night.
       On one of these evenings she had just finished waiting on Grandmother Jia
while she took her evening meal, when the old lady exempted her from further
services.
       ‘You must be tired,’ she said. ‘I know I am. Why don’t you go and have a bite to
eat yourself now and then go to bed? You will have to be up early again tomorrow.’
       You-shi thanked her and went off to Xi-feng’s room hoping for some supper.
Xi-feng was in the upstairs storage-room, however, supervising the putting away of
some screens that had just arrived. Only Patience was at home, folding up some of
Xi-feng’s clothes. Remembering Patience’s many kindnesses to Er-jie while she was
still alive, You-shi nodded her head sympathetically.
       ‘You are a good-hearted girl, Patience. I am afraid you have a great deal to put
up with.’
       Patience’s eyes reddened, but she forbore to say anything. You-shi asked her if
Xi-feng had eaten yet. Patience smiled.
       ‘She wouldn’t eat without first asking you,’ she said.
     ‘In that case I’ll go and look for a bite elsewhere,’ said You?-shi. ‘I don’t know
why, but I’m absolutely ravenous.’
     ‘Don’t go!’ said Patience. ‘We’ve got some mince rolls. Why not make do with
one or two of those now and have supper with Mrs Lian when she gets back?’
     ‘No, I can see you’re busy,’ said You-shi. ‘I think I shall go into the Garden to see
the girls.’
     Since she obviously wanted to go, Patience made no further effort to detain her.
     When You-shi came to the Garden she found the main gate and all the side
gates still open and blazing with lights. Turning to the maid who accompanied her,
she told her to go and fetch one of the women who were supposed to be on duty.
The maid went into the duty room in the gatehouse, but not a soul was anywhere to
be seen. She came back and told You?-shi. Very well, said You-shi, then she should go
and fetch one of the stewardesses from the mansion. The maid went back into the
mansion to the corner-house inside the inner gate which was used by the
stewardesses as a meeting-place, but its only occupants on this occasion were two
women busily engaged in sharing out some left-overs for their supper.
‘Where are the stewardesses, then?’ the girl asked them. ‘My mistress from the
Ning-guo is waiting for someone to give an order to.’
The women continued with their sharing-out. They felt little inclined to put
themselves out for a visitor from the other mansion.
‘The stewardesses have all gone home,’ said one of them.
‘In that case you’d better go and get one from her lodgings,’ said the maid.
‘Our job is to look after the rooms here, not to run errands,’ said the woman. ‘If you
want someone fetched, you’d better go and find someone whose job it is to fetch
them.’
‘But this is rank mutiny!’ said the maid. ‘Not your job to run errands? You might
fool a newcomer with such talk, but you don’t fool me! If I’d asked you to go to one
of the stewardesses with a private message or tell her to come and collect a tip,
you’d be trotting off like a little puppy-dog to its master. There’d be no talk then
about it not being your job to do errands. I’d like to hear you give Mrs Lian such an
answer!’
Partly because they had had a drop to drink and partly because what the girl said was
uncomfortably close to the truth, the women’s resentment quickly flared into anger.
     ‘Impertinent little baggage! We know very well what our job is; we don’t need
you to tell us. And before you start criticizing us, you might take a look at your own
parents. The way they suck up to the stewards and stewardesses at your place is
downright disgusting. You keep to your mansion and we’ll keep to ours. Go and make
trouble for your own people if you have a mind to, but keep away from us!’
     The maid had become white-faced with anger.
     ‘Good!’ she said ‘Very good!’ and turning about, walked straight back into the
Garden to report all this to her mistress.
     On entering the Garden some minutes previously, You-shi had come upon
Aroma, Bao-qin and Xiang-yun laughing at a story that two nuns from the Convent of
the Saviour King were telling them. When You-shi told them how hungry she was,
they invited her to sit with them in the courtyard of Green Delights while Aroma
went indoors to get her something to eat. Aroma found some rolls with meat and
some with vege?table stuffing in them and put them in a food-box to carry out to her.
She also brought out some tea for Bao-qin and Xiang-?yun to sip while You-shi was
eating the rolls. The nuns con?tinued with their story. At that moment the maid
arrived, still bursting with indignation, and proceeded to tell You-shi about her
encounter and what the two women had said. You-shi was silent for some moments
before she made any comment.
     ‘What extraordinary behaviour!’ she said finally.
     One of the nuns gave the maidservant a prod.
     ‘You are too quick-tempered, my child! You don’t want to go repeating what
those silly old women said to you. Your mistress is quite worn out from all her
exertions during these past few days. What she needs is a little pick-me-up,
something to cheer her up a bit. That’s what we’re trying to do, cheer her up. This is
no time to come troubling her with that sort of talk!’
     Aroma took the girl by the hand.
     ‘Go off and calm down a bit, there’s a good girl! I’ll get someone to fetch one of
the stewardesses.’
     ‘It isn’t necessary,’ said You-shi. She addressed herself to the maid. ‘Go and fetch
those two women, and when you’ve done that, you can find out where Mrs Lian is
and tell her I want to see her.’
     ‘I’ll go,’ said Aroma.
     ‘I’d rather you didn’t,’ said You-shi.
     The two nuns rose to their feet with propitiatory smiles.
     ‘Come, Mrs Zhen! You are such a kind, forgiving person as a rule. Surely you are
not going to lose your temper on Her Old Ladyship’s birthday? Whatever would
people say?’
Bao-qin and Xiang-yun added their own smiling entreaties.
‘All right,’ said You-shi, ‘I’ll let them off - but only because it is Lady Jia’s birthday.’
Unfortunately Aroma had in the meantime already sent a junior maid outside the
Garden to look for someone, and this girl was already pouring an account of what
had happened into the receptive ear of Zhou Rui’s wife, who, as it happened, was the
first person she ran into.
      Although Zhou Rui’s wife was not actually a stewardess, she regarded herself as
being of equal dignity with one on account of her special relationship with Lady
Wang, who had brought her from the Wang household when she was married;
moreover she was a somewhat insinuating woman, whose eagerness to please made
her a popular servant with the younger mistresses. What the maid told her brought
her flying over at once to Green Delights, brimming over with sympathy and concern.
      ‘How shocking! Poor Mrs Zhen! No wonder she is so angry! I wish I had been
there. I should have boxed their ears for them on the spot and settled accounts with
them later!’
      These worthy sentiments were uttered by her on the way. You-shi was pleased
to see her when she arrived.
      ‘Ah, my dear Zhou! Perhaps you will tell me whether or not I was right to feel
concerned. When I came into the Garden just now, all the gates were wide open and
candles were still burning in all the lanterns. Anyone would have been free to go in or
come out as they pleased. I thought how awful it would be if anything were to
happen, but when I gave orders for the duty-women to close the gates and put the
lights out, not a single one was to be found.’
      ‘Good gracious!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Mrs Lian gave special orders about this
only a few days ago and already they’re disobeying them! She’ll have to flog a few of
them when this is over; that’s the only way to cure this sort of thing.’
      You-shi then told her what the two women had said to her maid.
      ‘Well, don’t let it upset you, Mrs zhen,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Just wait until these
celebrations are over: I’ll have a word with the stewardesses and we’ll take that
precious pair and flog the daylights out of them. “You keep to your mansion and we’ll
keep to ours” indeed! They’ll be singing a different tune from that by the time we’ve
finished with them!’
      In the midst of this excitement someone arrived from Xi?feng’s, inviting You-shi
to come back for some supper.
      ‘I’m not hungry,’ said You-shi. ‘I’ve just been eating some rolls. Tell your mistress
to have her supper without me.’
      Zhou Rui’s wife went round herself to Xi-feng’s place shortly afterwards to
repeat all this story to Xi-feng.
      ‘All you need do is make a note of the women’s names,’ Xi-feng told her. ‘When
these celebrations are over, you can have them tied up and sent over to Mrs Zhen to
punish or pardon as she sees fit. It isn’t a very serious matter.’
      Now as it happened, Zhou Rui’s wife was on very bad terms with these two
women, and in her impatience to proceed against them, she put a somewhat loose
construction on the warrant given her by Xi-feng, for she first of all sent a boy round
to Lin Zhi-xiao’s house to say that Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife was wanted by You-shi
immediately, and then sent some other servants to apprehend the two women, tie
them up, and hand them over to the grooms to be shut up in the stables and kept
under guard there until further notice.
     Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, when she got the message, at once got into her carriage,
wondering what on earth could be the matter, and hurried over to Xi-feng’s place to
inquire; but when, on reaching the inner gate, she sent someone inside to announce
her, a maid came out and told her that Xi-feng had already gone to bed.
     ‘It’s Mrs Zhen that wants to see you,’ said the girl. ‘She’s in the Garden now.
You’d better look for her there.’
     Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife went into the Garden and hurried through it to Sweet-rice
Village. You-shi was quite put out when the maids announced her arrival. She had
her invited in immediately and smiled at her apologetically as she entered.
      ‘I only asked for you because I wanted to give an order and nobody could be
found. It wasn’t anything serious. It certainly wasn’t serious enough to call you out
for specially. It is all over and done with now, in any case.’
      Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife smiled, a trifle grimly.
      ‘But madam, Mrs Lian sent someone round to my place to say that you were
asking for me.’
      ‘If I was, it was under the impression that you were still here,’ said You-shi. ‘I
suppose it must be Zhou’s wife who told Mrs Lian about this. She need not have done
so. It was really nothing of any consequence. Please go back home to bed.’
      Li Wan was on the point of telling Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife what the trouble was, but
You-shi would not let her. Since evidently neither lady was going to tell her, Lin
Zhi-xiao’s wife took her leave. Just as she was coming out of the Garden gate, she ran
into Aunt Zhao.
      ‘Good gracious me! Still on your feet at this hour, Mrs Lin?’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’d
have thought you’d be at home and tucked up in bed by now!’
      ‘I was at home,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, and proceeded to tell Aunt Zhao why she
had been called out (for she had privately found out the reason for the summons
before going into the Garden).
      ‘Well, fancy calling you out for a piddling little thing like that!’ said Aunt Zhao
indignantly. ‘She should either have ignored it altogether, if she was feeling generous,
or if she was in an unforgiving mood, had the women given a few whacks and that
would have been the end of the matter. There was no need to drag you out specially.
I won’t ask you in for a cup of tea now, you’ll probably be wanting to get back to bed.’
      Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife continued on her way to the side gate where her carriage was
waiting. The young daughters of the two imprisoned women were lying in wait for
her there and, when they saw her coming, tearfully entreated her to intercede for
their mothers. Liin Zhi-xiao’s wife merely laughed at them.
     ‘Silly children! Those mothers of yours ought not to drink so much or be so free
with their tongues - that’s the cause of all this trouble. I don’t know what makes
them do it. It’s Mrs Lian who had them tied up and I’m in trouble myself now, so I
don’t know what I can do to help them.’
     The two daughters, being only little girls and of very limited understanding,
continued to blubber and entreat and clung so obstinately to Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife that
she was unable to get into her carriage. She rounded on one of the two girls
exasperatedly.
     ‘Stupid creature!’ she said. ‘What do you want to come hanging around me for
when you could find help elsewhere? Wasn’t your elder sister married to Mrs Fei’s
boy recently? Mrs Fei came here with Lady Xing when she was married. If you were
to tell your sister about this and get her to have a word with Mrs Fei and Mrs Fei
spoke about it to Lady Xing, that would be the end of the matter.’
      Glad to be reminded, the girl went scampering off immediately; but the other
girl continued to entreat. Lin Zhi?xiao’s wife shoved her off impatiently.
      ‘You really are a stupid child! Didn’t I just say that if she has a word with her
sister that will be the end of the matter? That means they’ll both be let off. You
surely don’t think they’d let her mother off and give yours a beating?’
      She got into her carriage then and drove back home.
The first little girl went and told her sister, as Lin Zhi?-xiao’s wife had told her to, and
the sister at once repeated the story to her mother-in-law, Goody Fei. This Goody Fei
was a notorious trouble-maker, whose first reaction to the story was a stream of
invective, fully audible to the occupants of all the neighbouring courtyards, after
which she went to solicit help from Lady Xing.
      ‘It’s my boy’s mother-in-law, my lady: she only had a few words with a maid of
Mrs Zhen’s, but that Zhou woman told such a pack of lies about her to Mrs Lian that
she had my boy’s mother-in-law and the woman that was with her tied up and shut
in the stables and in a few days’ time she’s going to have them both beaten. Do,
please, my lady, put in a good word with Mrs Lian and ask her to let them off.’
      Ever since the Faithful fiasco Grandmother Jia’s attitude towards Lady Xing
seemed to have hardened, whilst Xi-feng’s stature seemed to have grown at her
mother-in-law’s expense. The jealousy and resentment that Lady Xing felt as a
conse?quence of this had recently been exacerbated by an imagined slight: the
passing over of Ying-chun when the Dowager Princess of Nan-an asked to see the Jia
girls and Tan-chun was the only one of the three to be called. Mischief-makers were
not wanting to play upon her resentment, in this case repre?senting Xi-feng’s action
as a deliberate attack on her authority.
      Her hatred of Xi-feng had now reached a degree of intensity that went beyond
all reason.
      Early next morning she went to pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. This was
the junior clansmen’s day. When Lady Xing got there, the junior clansmen had
already arrived and the players were waiting to begin. Grandmother Jia always
enjoyed meeting young people, and so today she was appear?ing in person to
receive their congratulations, dressed in her ordinary clothes, since this was a family
party and the guests were all her juniors. She was reclining in the middle of the rear
part of the hall on a large wooden couch furnished with a back-rest and bolsters and
a footstool in front of it in case she should wish to sit upright. Around her couch were
ranged a number of identical stools on which Bao-chai, Bao-qin, Dai-Yu, Xiang-yun,
Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun were sitting. Of the twenty or so girls of their
generation whose mothers had brought them there on this occasion two, Jia Bin’s
sister Xi-luan and Jia Qiong’s sister Si-jie, had, on account of their good looks,
well-spokenness and charming manners, found particular favour with Grandmother
Jia and been invited to sit on stools with the other seven. Bao-yu sat up on the couch
with his grandmother and massaged her legs for her. Aunt Xue had been given the
place of honour in the ordering of the feast and the two lines of tables which rayed
out on either side were occupied by the other ladies according to their husbands’
seniority in the clan. The men sat on the verandah at either side of the hall, also in
order of seniority.
      Presently the birthday ceremony began. The female members of the clan were
the first to make their kotows. The males would have come next, but Grandmother
Jia lay back on the couch and sent someone outside to excuse them. Then Lai Da
arrived with the male domestics. They knelt down, row upon row of them, from the
ornamental gate all the way up to the steps at the foot of the hall, to make their
kotows. After them it was the turn of the married women, and after them of the
maids. Something like the time it would take to eat two or three meals must have
elapsed before all the kotowing was over. Next a number of bird-cages were set
down in the middle of the courtyard and the birds released from them. Then Jia She
and the other seniors supervised the burning of paper offerings to Heaven-and-Earth
and Old Longevity. Only then did the drinking and the play-acting begin.
      Grandmother Jia remained until the players’ mid-day interval before retiring to
rest in her own room. She insisted that those of them who had escorted her there
should go back and enjoy themselves, and asked Xi-feng to arrange for Xi-luan and
Si-jie to stay on for a couple of nights after the party.
     Xi-feng went off to speak to the girls’ mothers. Both had received favours from
her in the past and were only too happy to comply with anything she asked them,
and the girls themselves were of course delighted at the prospect of playing in the
Garden all day and not having to go home for the night.
     Lady Xing bided her time until the evening; then, just as everyone was getting
ready to go, she went up to Xi-feng in front of all the others and made her a request.
     ‘I understand that you became angry with two old women last night and sent
Zhou Rui’s wife to have them tied up. I don’t know what crime they had committed
and it isn’t of course my business to interfere, but it does seem to me that Lady Jia’s
birthday is an occasion when we should all be doing our utmost to help those less
fortunate than ourselves - giving money and free rice to the old and needy and that
sort of thing - hardly a time for maltreating aged domestics. Could you not see your
way to releasing them, for Lady Jia’s sake, if not for mine?’
Having said that, she got into her carriage and drove away.
The humiliation of being addressed like this in front of so many people filled Xi-feng
with anger and confusion. Her face turned a dusky red colour and for some moments
she was so taken aback that she was unable to speak; then, turning to Lai Da’s wife,
she said, with a forced laugh:
      ‘But this is ridiculous! Last night I heard that some of our people had been rude
to Mrs Zhen, and as I was afraid that she might be feeling vexed about it, I naturally
had them tied up so that they could be placed at her disposal. It wasn’t me they had
offended. I wonder what tale-bearing busybody is res?ponsible for carrying this story
next door?’
      ‘What exactly happened last night?’ asked Lady Wang.
      Xi-feng explained.
      ‘I didn’t even know about this myself,’ said You-shi, laughing. ‘Really, Feng, I
think you were a trifle officious.’
      ‘I was concerned about you,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You had been insulted. It was a
natural courtesy to place them at your disposal. Suppose I was at your place and
some of your people insulted me? Wouldn’t you send them over to me for me to
deal with? I thought that was a general principle which all of us observed, even if the
servant in question was a highly valued one. Some meddlesome person has blown
this incident up out of all proportion for the sake of stirring things up next door. I
shouldn’t have thought myself that it was worth mentioning even.’
      ‘Your mother-in-law was quite right,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Cousin Zhen’s wife is one
of us. There was no need for such empty courtesies in her case. Grandmother’s
birthday is much more important. The women ought to be released.’
      Xi-feng’s humiliation was now complete. A feeling of such wretchedness came
over her that she could no longer hold back the tears of anger that had been
collecting in her eyes. Not wishing them to be seen, she rushed back to her own
apartment to weep alone.
     She had hardly got back, though, when Grandmother Jia sent Amber round to
summon her. Amber noticed with surprise that she had been crying.
     ‘Hullo, what’s all this about? She’s waiting to ask you about something.’
     Xi-feng wiped away her tears, washed and dried her face, and put on a fresh lot
of make-up before accompanying Amber back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment.
     ‘How many of the people who sent presents gave me screens ?’ the old lady
asked Xi-feng when she arrived.
     ‘Sixteen,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There were twelve big screens and four little kang
screens. The biggest screen was from the Zhens of Nanking: a twelve panel folding
screen with a scene in silk tapestry on crimson satin from A Heap of Honours on one
side and Symbols of Longevity in powder-gold on the other. There’s also quite a good
enamelled screen from Admiral Wu’s lady.’
‘Yes, well don’t do anything with those two, then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Just put
them by somewhere where they will be safe. I want to give them to someone as a
present.’
      Faithful went over to Xi-feng and peered into her face.
      ‘What are you staring at her like that for?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Haven’t you
seen her before?’
      ‘I was wondering why her eyes are so swollen,’ said Faithful.
      ‘Come over here,’ Grandmother Jia commanded, and scrutinized Xi-feng herself.
      ‘It’s because my eyes were itching and I’ve been rubbing them,’ said Xi-feng.
      ‘Are you sure someone hasn’t been upsetting you?’ said Faithful, laughing.
      ‘Who would dare?’ said Xi-feng. ‘And even if they had, I wouldn’t dare to cry on
Her Old Ladyship’s birthday.’
      ‘I should think not indeed,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’m just going to have dinner
now. You can stay with me and watch me eat it, and then you and Zhen’s wife can
share what’s left over. The two of you can help these sisters here to pick up Buddha
beans.’ She indicated the pair of nuns whose presence Xi-feng had been vaguely
aware of on entering. ‘It will add some years to your life. I let Bao-yu and the girls do
it the other day. Now you two must have a go as well, so that no one can accuse me
of favouritism.’
      While she was speaking, the table had been laid and a meat?less meal served
for the two nuns. Then, when they had eaten, a meal with meat in it was served for
Grandmother Jia. When she in turn had finished, the remains of her meal were
carried into the outer room for Xi-feng and You-shi to eat. They had already started
when Grandmother Jia had Xi-luan and Si-jie sent for to join them. After they had
finished and washed their hands, some incense was lit and a pint of beans brought in,
over which the two nuns chanted some prayers. The two young women, each armed
with a pair of chopsticks, then had to pick the beans up one by one and drop them
into a basket, to be boiled next day and given away to passers-by in the street.
While they were thus engaged, Grandmother Jia reclined on her couch and listened
to edifying stories told her by the two nuns.
      Faithful had heard from Amber about Xi-feng’s crying and had been over to
Xi-feng’s apartment herself to find out the reason for it from Patience. Late that
evening, when everyone else had left, she spoke about it to Grandmother Jia.
      ‘Mrs Lian is still crying. It’s because she was shamed in front of everyone by Lady
Xing.’
      ‘Oh?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Why was that?’
      Faithful told her.
      ‘I think Feng acted quite correctly,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Surely we’re not going
to allow our slaves to insult everyone with impunity just because it’s my birthday? I
expect this was Lady Xing’s way of getting her own back for some grudge or other
that she hadn’t had the courage to tackle her about at the time. It’s hard to see what
other motive she could have had for humiliating her in public.’
    Just at that moment Bao-qin came in and the subject had to be dropped.
Bao-qin’s presence reminded Grandmother Jia of her two young visitors. She called
one of her women to her and gave her a message about them which she was to
convey to the principal womenservants in the Garden.
      ‘Tell them they must treat them just as they do our own young ladies. Anyone I
hear of behaving disrespectfully to either of them will be punished mercilessly.’
      ‘Better let me go,’ said Faithful, before the woman had had time to get away.
‘They’ll never listen to her.’
      She went off at once into the Garden. Her first call was at Sweet-rice Village; but
neither Li Wan nor You-shi was there. The maids there told her that they were in
Tan-chun’s apartment with the others, so she retraced her footsteps and called in at
Autumn Studio. She found Li Wan and You-shi in the Paulownia Room engaged in a
conversation, punctuated by frequent bursts of laughter, with the rest of the
Garden’s little society. They welcomed Faithful with smiles and urged her to be
seated.
      ‘What are you doing here at this late hour?, they asked her.
      ‘I suppose I’m allowed to walk in the Garden if I want to,’ said Faithful, and
passed on Grandmother Jia’s message about Xi-luan and Si-jie.
      Li Wan rose respectfully to receive it and at once sent some?one to transmit it
to the heads of all the apartments and instruct them to pass it on to their
subordinates.
      ‘Lady Jia has wonderful foresight,’ You-shi commented drily. ‘We energetic
younger ones may tie up a dozen servants, but we are still not so effective as her.’
      ‘I don’t know,’ said Li Wan. ‘Cousin Feng may not quite come up to Lady Jia’s
standard, but she doesn’t do too badly. Personally I find her foresight quite uncanny.
Certainly I could never hope to match it.’
      ‘You should have said “poor Cousin Feng”,’ said Faithful. ‘She’s in a bad way at
the moment. During all the years she has been managing things she may not have
put a foot wrong as far as Their Ladyships are concerned, but she has given a great
deal of offence elsewhere. A daughter-in-law’s life must be pretty impossible. If she is
too meek and mild her in-laws will complain that she is stupid and the servants won’t
respect her, yet if she shows any initiative, there is always another set of problems
rising up behind her back for every one that she deals with. In our household, where
there are a certain number of mistresses who used once themselves to be maids, it’s
particularly difficult. Such people are so full of their own importance that they are
always taking offence, and if they are the slightest bit crossed in anything they begin
spreading stories about you or finding other ways of stirring up trouble. I haven’t so
far liked to say anything to Her Old Ladyship about this for fear of making her angry.
If I ever do, people had better watch out, because then the sparks will begin to fly, I
can tell you! Perhaps I shouldn’t say this in front of you, Miss Tan, but you know how
certain people are always carrying on about the way Her Old Ladyship makes a
favourite of Bao-yu. Well now apparently that doesn’t matter any more. That’s just a
“natural preference”. Now it seems they’re angry because Her Old Ladyship has been
favouring you. Did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous?’
      ‘There are a lot of very silly people about,’ said Tan-chun. ‘One really can’t be
bothered with what they say. I often think how nice it would be to live in a smaller
household, even if it meant being poorer. Think how delightful it would be to have
just oneself and one’s parents and one or two brothers and sisters living together as
one happy little family! People look at our great household and all its wealth and
think how happy we must be; they don’t realize that the vexations far outweigh the
advantages.’
      ‘You’re much too thin-skinned, Tan,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m always telling you: you
should pay no attention to what vulgar people say or do but concentrate on enjoying
the luxuries and opportunities that wealth and position make available to us. Others
who lack these things have some reason to com?plain. Why make yourself miserable
when you have got them?’
      ‘We can’t all be as happy-go-lucky as you are,’ said You-shi. ‘All you think about
is amusing yourself with the girls, eating when you are hungry and sleeping when
you are tired. Each year to you is like the last. You haven’t a thought in your head
about the future.’
      ‘It’s the time I spend with the girls here that really matters,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I die,
I die. What do I care about the future?’
      Li Wan and the others laughed.
      ‘That’s a silly way to talk. Even if you don’t do anything with your life and spend
all the rest of it in here, you surely don’t think that the girls will be staying with you
as well? They’ll all be going off to get married.’
      ‘I can understand why people say your growth has all gone into good looks,’ said
You-shi. ‘You really are a silly fellow.’
      ‘Man’s life is uncertain,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Which of us knows when his time will
come? Even if I die today or tomorrow or this year or next year, at least I shall have
lived my life as I wanted to.’
The others would hardly let him finish what he was saying.
‘Worse and worse! Best not encourage him. What he was saying just now was
simpleton’s talk, but this is raging lunacy!’
      ‘Don’t talk about dying, Cousin Bao,’ said little Xi-luan. ‘Lady Jia and Lady Wang
are sure to feel lonely when all the girls have gone. I will come here and help you
keep them company.’
      Li Wan and You-shi both laughed.
      ‘Now you are talking like a simpleton, young lady. Don’t you think you will be
getting married then as well?’
      Xi-luan was overcome with bashfulness and hung her head. The first watch was
just sounding. They got up then and returned to their various apartments for the
night.
*
On her way back to Grandmother Jia’s, Faithful observed that one of the side gates of
the Garden was shut but not yet barred. There was no one about. A faint light burned
in the duty-room and a sliver of moon half-way up the sky shed a feeble radiance
from above. As she had no companion to talk to, carried no lantern, and was walking
softly, the women in the duty-room seemed not to have noticed her. She had for
some time been wanting to empty her bladder, and this seemed as good an
opportunity as any for doing so. She left the path and began looking for a place
where the grass was not too high to squat down in.
      She had found what looked like a good spot under a large osmanthus tree
behind a Tai-hu rock and was just making her way round the side of the rock to reach
it when a rustle of clothing caused her to jump almost out of her skin. By straining
her eyes she could make out two human shapes. They melted into the bushes at her
arrival, but Faithful had very sharp eyes, and before they disappeared, the faint
moonlight had enabled her to identify one of them by the red top, bouf?fant
hair-style, and tall, somewhat heavy build, as Ying-chun’s head maid, Chess. She
assumed that Chess and some other girl had been using the place as a convenience
and had hidden themselves in the bushes when they saw her coming, intending to
jump out at her presently and give her a scare.
‘Chess, come out of there!’ she called. ‘If you frighten me I shall scream, and then
you will be taken for a thief. This is no time to be playing monkey-tricks, a big girl like
you!’
     These words were spoken in jest with no other motive than to prevent Chess
jumping out and scaring her, but to Chess’s guilty conscience they seemed to imply
that the secret she was hiding had been discovered. She was terrified that Faithful
might cry out and others get to know about it as well, which would be even more
frightful: and as Faithful had always been kind to her in the past, she resolved to
throw herself on her mercy. Running out of the bushes, she knelt down and clung to
her imploringly.
      ‘Faithful, I beg of you, for God’s sake don’t cry out!’
      Not knowing what to make of this exaggerated reaction to her words, Faithful
hastily pulled her to her feet.
      ‘Well, well, what’s all this about?’
      Chess seemed unable to reply, but her body was trembling all over. Faithful was
more mystified than ever. She looked again in the direction from which Chess had
just come and saw a figure lurking there. It looked like a boy’s. She began to guess
the reason for Chess’s terror. A sickening embarrassment made her own heart beat
faster and she could feel her face burning to the very tips of her ears. She was afraid,
too. After a brief silence in which she managed to recover some of her composure,
she asked Chess, in a tremulous whisper, who ‘that other person’ was. Chess sank
once more to her knees.
      ‘He’s my cousin, Faithful,’ she said faintly, ‘my father’s sister’s son.’
      Faithful made a scornful sound, as if she did not believe her; but she was still
too embarrassed to say anything.
      ‘There’s no need to hide,’ Chess called out softly to the boy. ‘My friend here had
already seen you. Come out quickly and kotow.’
      The boy darted out from the cover of the tree, threw himself on his knees in
front of Faithful, and began knocking his head on the ground as if he were pounding
garlic in a mortar. Faithful wanted to turn away, but Chess clung to her tearfully and
beseechingly.
     ‘Our lives are in your hands, Faithful. Be merciful!’
     ‘Of course I shall; you don’t need to ask,’ said Faithful. ‘Tell him to go away.
Whatever happens, I shan’t tell anyone. There’s no need for all this drama.’
     Before she had finished speaking, a voice could be heard from the direction of
the corner gate.
     ‘Miss Faithful’s already gone out. We can bar the gate now.’
Chess was still clinging to her so hard that Faithful could not get away. She had to call
out to the woman from where she stood.
‘No, I’m still here. I’ve been doing something. Just a second: I’ll be out directly.’
Chess, when she heard her say that, was obliged to let her go. The rest will be told in
the following chapter.
CHAPTER 72

Wang Xi-feng refuses to see a
doctor
And Brightie’s wife seeks help
with a betrothal



As Faithful went out of the corner gate, her cheeks were still burning and her heart
was beating wildly. What an extraordinary encounter - and how unexpected! She
began to con?sider what the consequences would be if she were to tell anyone. A
crime involving both sexual delinquency and illicit entry could cost the offenders
their lives - and other persons might well be implicated. She resolved to keep her
discovery to herself. ‘After all,’ she reflected, ‘it is really no business of mine.’ And so,
when she got back to Grandmother Jia’s apartment, she gave only a routine account
of her mission and went to bed without telling anyone about her experience.
But what of Chess? She and her father’s sister’s son - the boy whom Faithful had
discovered with her in the Garden - had often played together as little children. In
those days they were childhood sweethearts, innocently vowing, before they even
knew the full meaning of the vow, that they would be husband and wife when they
grew up or else would never marry. The years passed by and each grew up into a
good-looking adolescent. Significant looks would pass between them when they saw
each other during Chess’s occasional visits home, and they knew, without needing to
tell each other, that the childhood bond between them was as strong as ever. As they
were both dreadfully afraid that their parents would oppose their meeting, they
contrived - he working on his side and she on hers - to buy the support of the Garden
women, so that gates might be left conveniently unbarred and notice obligingly be
given when the coast was clear; and now, today, taking advantage of the confusion
caused by the birthday celebrations, they had met for the first time inside the Garden.
They had not yet reached the point of physical union when Faithful surprised them,
but they had exchanged vows and keepsakes and passionate endearments and were
not far off it. Shortly after their discovery by Faithful, the boy managed to dodge
away through the bushes and slip out of the corner gate unseen.
Chess did not sleep that night. She lay awake until dawn, bitterly regretting that she
had ever agreed to the assignation. Meeting Faithful next day caused her to go hot
and cold by turns, and all day long she felt as wretched and uncomfortable as if she
were carrying a devil’s child inside her. She had lost all her appetite for food and
drink, and whether sitting or standing felt equally jumpy and ill at ease. This
continued for two days. When two days had gone by and still nothing had happened,
she began to feel a little easier.
But then one morning one of the old women from the Garden gate came round and
whispered some news to her.
‘Your cousin’s run away. He hasn’t been home now for three or four days. They’re
out everywhere looking for him.’
A wave of mingled alarm, anger and grief swept over her.
‘Even if she’d told, he ought to have stayed,’ she thought, ‘and we could have died
together. How can he love me, running away like that, without even waiting to find
out?’
As a result of this latest shock she woke up next morning with a feeling of weakness
inside her, and after trying unsuccessfully for a while to drag herself around, was
forced to go back and lie down. This time she was ill in earnest.
When Faithful heard that one of the boys had unaccountably run away and that
Chess was so ill that there was already talk of moving her out of the Garden, she was
sure that in either case it was fear that she might betray them that had been the
cause. So concerned did she feel about this that, on the pretext of paying a sick visit,
she went to see Chess and reassure her. As soon as she could get the others out of
the room, she swore a most solemn oath that she would never give her away.
‘So just stop worrying and get better.’ she told her. ‘You are too young to throw
your life away because of a thing like this.’
Chess clung to her hand and wept.
‘Dear Faithful! We’ve known each other now since we were little girls. You have
always been nice to me, and I have always respected you. If you really don’t tell
anyone about this stupid mistake of mine, I promise to honour you as if you were my
mother. From now on, each day I live will be a day I owe to you. If I get better, I shall
set up a tablet with your name on it and kotow and burn incense to it every day and
pray that you may have a long and happy life. But if I die, then I hope I may be reborn
as a dog or an ass, if only I can have the chance to repay you.’
She went on to say much more in this vein, the tears all the while streaming down
her cheeks, so that Faithful herself became affected and began to cry as well.
‘It’s your own imagination that is making you so ill,’ she said, shaking her head sadly.
‘Why should I want to go out of my way to destroy your reputation? To win
someone’s approval? Surely you know me better than that? In any case, I am much
too shy to talk about such things. Please stop worrying. From now on you must start
getting better. And when you are better, try to live a little more sensibly in future.
Don’t go getting yourself into scrapes like this again.’
Chess nodded her head vigorously upon the pillow. After speaking a few more words
to comfort her, Faithful took her leave.
Faithful had noticed that Xi-feng had been somewhat off colour during these past few
days. She happened to know that Jia Lian was out and thought she might as well drop
in on Xi-feng on her way back and ask how she was. The servants on the inner gate
stood up as she approached and remained standing until she disappeared into
Xi-feng’s court?yard. As she entered the reception room, Patience was just emerging
from inside. She smiled when she saw Faithful and hurried up to her.
‘She’s just eaten and now she’s having an afternoon nap,’ she said in a low voice.
‘Come into the other room and we’ll have a chat.’
At her insistence Faithful accompanied her into the room on the east side of the
reception room and sat down with her. A junior maid poured them both some tea.
‘Tell me, what’s been the matter with your mistress during these past few days?’
said Faithful. ‘She seems so lethargic.’
Patience sighed.
‘It’s not just these last few days,’ she said, having first looked round to make sure
that no one else was within hearing. ‘It goes back a month at least. It’s just that all
the work of the last few days and that upset with Lady Xing coming on top of it have
made her worse so that people are beginning to notice.
‘In that case why doesn’t she call a doctor?’
‘My dear Faithful,’ said Patience, ‘surely you know our Mrs Lian better than that?
It’s not just calling a doctor or taking medicine that she objects to. Sometimes,
because I can’t bear to see her looking so ill, I’ll ask her, quite casually, “How do you
feel today?”; but even that will be enough to make her angry. She says there’s
nothing wrong with her and that I’m trying to make her ill by talking about it. In spite
of feeling so poorly, she still insists on keeping up with everything that goes on in the
household. It worries me. How can she ever get better if she herself won’t face up to
the fact that she is ill?’
‘She really ought to call a doctor,’ said Faithful. ‘Surely it would be a relief just to
know what she is suffering from?’
Patience sighed.
‘Whatever it is, if you ask me, it’s something pretty serious.
‘Oh?’ said Faithful. ‘What kind of trouble is it then?’
Patience leaned forwards and spoke very softly into her ear.
‘During this past month, ever since she had her last period, it’s been drip-drip,
drip-drip all the time. Surely that’s serious, isn’t it?’
‘Aiyo!’ said Faithful. ‘It sounds as if the blood-gate has burst.’
Patience gave a little laugh.
‘Oh Faithful, you are a baby! What a thing to say! Poor Mrs Lian!’
Faithful coloured, and she laughed as well, a trifle sheepishly.
‘Well I don’t know what it means myself. It’s just that I heard them saying it about
my elder sister. You’ve probably forgotten: she died of something rather like this. I
was too young at the time to know what was the matter with her, but I remember
hearing my mother talking about it to my sister’s mother-in-law and one of them
saying “The blood-gate’s burst” and wondering at the time what it could mean. Later
on, when I heard more about her illness, I thought I under?stood, but I don’t suppose
I did really.’
While they were talking, a little maid came in with a message.
‘Old Mrs Zhu has been again. We told her the mistress had just laid down for her
afternoon nap so she went off to Lady Wang’s room.’
Patience nodded.
‘Which Mrs Zhu is that?’ said Faithful.
‘She’s an official marriage-broker working for one of the yamens,’ said Patience.
‘She’s come on behalf of Sir Sun Somebody-or-other who wants one of our young Jia
ladies for his son. Old nuisance! She’s been around here every day during the past
few days, flashing her card at everyone.’
At that moment another little maid came hurrying into the room.
‘Mr Lian’s back!’
Patience hurried out to meet him as he stepped into the reception room outside. He
began walking into the side room, since it was the room that Patience had just come
out of, but halted on the threshold when he caught sight of Faithful sitting inside on
the kang.
‘Ah, my dear Faithful!’ he said, smiling broadly. ‘What favourable wind has blown
you to our humble abode?’
Faithful smiled back at him. She made no effort to get up.
‘I came here to pay my respects to you and Mrs Lian, but one of you was out and
the other one was having a nap.’
‘You’re so busy all the year round waiting on Her Old Ladyship,’ said Jia Lian, still
smiling, ‘it’s we who should come to see you, not the other way round.’ He paused.
‘As a matter of fact it’s rather a stroke of luck that you have come here today. I was
on my way to see you just now. The only reason I dropped in here was because this
gown I am wearing is too hot and I wanted to change into something cooler before
going on to see you. But God is good to me, it seems: your being here means that I
am saved the trouble of going out again.’
He sat himself down in a chair.
‘What was it you wanted to see me about?’ said Faithful.
Jia Lian gave a preliminary laugh.
‘Something I’ve forgotten about that you may perhaps remember. On Her Old
Ladyship’s birthday last year some travelling monk made her a present of a Buddha’s
hand modelled in coloured wax. She was so taken with it that she immediately had it
put on display somewhere where she could admire it. When I was going through the
inventory of her ornaments the other day in preparation for these birthday
celebrations, I found an entry for the thing but couldn’t discover where it had got to;
and as I wasn’t able to tick it off on the inventory, the steward of the ornaments
room has been on to me a couple of times since then asking me to find out where it
is. Do you know? Has Her Old Ladyship still got the thing on display somewhere in
her own apartment, or has she handed it over to someone else?’
‘After she’d had it on display for a couple of days, she grew tired of it and gave it to
Mrs Lian,’ said Faithful. ‘I don’t know why you should be asking me about it! I can
even remember the day, and the person I sent round with it. It was Old Wang’s wife.
You should ask Mrs Lian or Patience about it. They will tell you.’
Patience, who had just been seeing to some clothes, came hurrying in again.
‘Certainly she gave it to us. It’s upstairs here in the loft. Mrs Lian long ago sent
someone to tell the steward that we’d got it. I suppose he was too lazy to make a
note of it at the time. It’s too bad that he should be making a fuss about it now.’
‘If she gave it to your mistress,’ said Jia Lian, ‘how is it that I don’t know anything
about it? I think you must have been hiding it from me.’
‘The mistress did tell you about it,’ said Patience. ‘You wanted to give it to someone
as a present, but the mistress wouldn’t let you. She had a terrible job persuading you
to let her keep it. Fancy your forgetting - and then having the nerve to accuse us of
hiding it from you! If we were going to start hiding things from you, we could do a bit
better than that! We have been given things ten times more valuable, but invariably
you have been told.’
Jia Lian looked down smilingly and reflected, then clapped his hands suddenly as he
remembered.
‘Why yes, of course. How stupid of me! I’m forgetting everything these days; No
wonder people get so cross with me. I’m not the man I was!’
‘It’s hardly surprising,’ said Faithful. ‘You have so much to do and so many people
to deal with. By the time you’ve had a couple of drinks, you can’t be expected to
remember very much!’
She got up to go. Jia Lian too rose to his feet.
‘Do stay a little longer. I want to ask you a favour.’
He turned rather crossly to one of the junior maids.
‘Can’t we have some better tea than this? Get some clean cover-cups and use some
of that tea we were given yesterday.’
He turned back to Faithful.
‘During these past few days, because of Her Old Ladyship’s birthday celebrations,
we’ve got through the last few thousand taels we had. Our house-rents and
land-rents aren’t due in until the ninth month. Until then we have nothing. Yet soon
we shall be having to buy presents for the Princess of Nan-an’s birthday, and there
are the presents we shall have to send to Her Grace on the Double Ninth and various
weddings and funerals to provide for. We need at least two or three thousand taels
to pay for these things. It would be difficult to borrow that much outside at present;
and as they say self-help is the best help, I am turning to you to ask if you would be
prepared, for all our sakes, to commit a very tiny little crime. Could you possibly look
out a few gold and silver things that Her Old Ladyship would not be likely to miss and
smuggle a boxful of them out to me enough for me to raise about a thousand taels
on - just to tide us over the next week or two? As soon as our money comes in I shall
redeem them and give them back to you. I promise you shan’t get into any trouble.’
Faithful smiled.
‘Nobody can say you aren’t ingenious. Whatever will you think of next?’
‘Look, I’m not just saying this to flatter you,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but though I know plenty
of other people who have a thousand taels’ worth of stuff in their keeping, they none
of them have your courage or intelligence. If I made a proposal like this to one of
them, I’d frighten the wits out of them. That’s why I turn to you. Better one stroke of
the big bell than a thousand tinkles on the little cymbal!’
At that moment one of the junior maids from Grandmother Jia’s apartment came in.
She seemed somewhat out of breath.
‘Her Old Ladyship wants you. I’ve been ages looking for you. I never thought you
would be here.’
Faithful hurried out after her. Jia Lian went inside to see Xi-feng.
Xi-feng had, as a matter of fact, been awake for some time. She had heard Jia Lian
make his request but, not liking to intervene, had remained lying where she was. She
knew that Faithful had left.
‘Well?’ she asked as Jia Lian entered. ‘Is it settled?’
‘Not quite,’ said Jia Lian, smiling. ‘As good as. I think if you were to go over and have
a word with her, it would tip the balance.’
‘It’s nothing to do with me, what you get up to,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Suppose she does
agree. Once you’ve got your hands on the money, you’ll like as not forget all your fine
promises and just hang on to her stuff. And what can she do then? Nothing. Then
suppose Grandmother finds out? Her confidence in me, that it has taken me all these
years to build up, will be completely shattered.’
‘Come on, be an angel!’ Jia Lian pleaded. ‘I promise you won’t regret it.’
‘Why, what will you give me?’ said Xi-feng.
‘Just say,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Anything you like.’
‘I know what to ask him for,’ said Patience, who had been near at hand listening.
‘You know you said earlier there was something you were planning to do that you
would need one or two hundred taels for: ask him to let you have two hundred taels
of the money he raises on pawn. That ought to suit both of you.’
‘Thank you for reminding me,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Yes, I will.’
‘You are a terrible woman!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Never mind things to pawn, if you had a
mind to, you could probably let me have four or five thousand taels cash. All I’m
asking you to do is say a few words for me - and even for that you want to charge! No
wonder you and I -’
Xi-feng leaped to her feet angrily, breaking in before he could finish.
‘Well, what of it? The “four or five thousand taels” is my own money, isn’t it? I
haven’t cheated you Jias out of it. Just about everyone in this establishment
nowadays seem to spend their time discussing my shortcomings. It only needed you.
Well, they say that when a house is haunted it’s one’s own ghost that invites the
others in. Why do you always assume that any money I have must be Jia money? I
haven’t noticed that your family is so staggeringly rich. You’re not exactly millionaires,
are you? We Wangs could probably keep you going for the rest of your lives just with
the sweepings from our floor! I don’t want to boast, but just take a look at the
dowries that Aunt Wang and I brought with us when we came here and try matching
them, item for item, with things of your own.’
Jia Lian laughed.
‘How you do fly off the handle! I was only joking. You can have a hundred or two
hundred taels now if you need them. I couldn’t give you much more than that, but
that much at least I can manage. Take it now and speak to her when you’ve spent it.
How’s that for an offer?’
‘I’m not in that much of a hurry,’ said Xi-feng. ‘It isn’t pennies for a laying-out I’m
after.’
‘Bless my soul, what a passion you’re in!’ said Jia Lian.
Xi-feng laughed.
‘No, I’m not really. But I found what you said just now very wounding. The day after
tomorrow is the anniversary of Er-jie’s death. Since we were sisters for a little while, I
thought the least I could do was visit her grave and make her a few offerings. She
didn’t give us a son, it’s true, but we mustn’t “let the dust of those who have gone
before get into the eyes of those who follow”. That’s what I wanted the money for.’
Jia Lian said nothing for some moments. Xi-feng had effectively shut him up.
‘You are very thoughtful,’ he said eventually. Then, after another pause, ‘Since you
won’t need the money till the day after tomorrow, we may as well wait and see
whether or not Faithful will let us have the things. If she does, you will be able to
take what you want after I have pawned them.’
At that moment Brightie’s wife came hurrying in.
‘Well?’ Xi-feng asked her. ‘Is it settled?’
‘No,’ said Brightie’s wife. ‘Nothing doing. It’s as I said: unless we have your backing
for it, we shan’t get anywhere.’
‘What’s this?’ said Jia Lian.
‘Oh, nothing serious,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Brightie and his wife have a son who is
seventeen this year and not yet married and they wanted to get Lady Wang’s Sunset
for him. They haven’t done anything about it previously, because they didn’t know
what Lady Wang might have in mind for her. Now it seems that because Sunset has
had so much illness during the past year, Lady Wang has sent her back to her parents
and said they can choose a husband for her themselves. Brightie’s wife asked me if I
would speak to the parents on her behalf but I thought that as the families were so
obviously suited, her parents couldn’t possibly have any objection to the match and
that Brightie and his wife would be able to arrange it themselves. But it seems that I
was wrong.’
‘It doesn’t matter, does it?’ said Jia Lian. ‘Surely there are plenty of others as good
as Sunset they could get for him, or even better?’
‘That’s as may be, sir,’ said Brightie’s wife with a somewhat artificial smile, ‘but if
people see that we are not even good enough for the likes of them, it doesn’t do
much for our prestige. I took a lot of trouble choosing that girl for him and I hoped
that you and Mrs Lian would be so very kind as to settle the matter for us, for I know
you could do so if you wished. But Mrs Lian she said no, there was no need, they’d be
sure to agree. Well, I got a woman to speak to the parents for me, and now she’s just
come back from them with a flea in her ear. I don’t think there’s any objection as far
as the girl is concerned. I’ve sounded her out once or twice in the past and as far as I
could make out she would be quite willing. It’s that stupid old couple with their high
and mighty ideas that are the stumbling-block.’
These words were intended to put Jia Lian and Xi-feng on their mettle; but Xi-feng
could hardly take the initiative in her husband’s presence and watched Jia Lian in
silence to see what he would do, whilst Jia Lian for his part had too much on his mind
to be bothered with anything so trifling. He would probably have ignored it
altogether were it not for the fact that Brightie and his wife were rather special
servants. Xi-feng had brought them from her father’s house when she was married
and they had served her devotedly ever since. Jia Lian realized that to be refused
help now that they had openly requested it would be regarded by them as a very
great loss of face.
‘Well, it’s hardly a matter calling for so much palaver,’ he said impatiently. ‘Be on
your way now and stop worrying about it! I’ll send a couple of senior people
tomorrow with the betrothal presents to have a talk with her father and tell him that
I am sponsoring the match. If he still holds out against it, I’ll have him over and talk
to him myself.’
Brightie’s wife looked questioningly at Xi-feng. In answer to her look Xi-feng made a
barely perceptible movement with her lips, whereupon Brightie’s wife got down on
her knees and made Jia Lian a kotow.
‘It’s your mistress you should be kotowing to,’ said Jia Lian hurriedly. ‘Although I
shall be talking to her father, you’ll still have to persuade your mistress to send for
the mother and have a word with her, otherwise it will seem too much like coercion.
After all, you’ll want to be on speaking terms with your son’s in-laws after the boy is
married.’
‘If you are prepared to take so much trouble on their behalf, you surely don’t think
that I am going to stand idly by?’ said Xi-feng. ‘All right, Brightie’s wife, you’ve heard
what we are going to do for you: now I want you to do something for me. I want you
to ask your husband to chase after all the people I have lent money to and see to it
that all the loan accounts are cleared by the end of this year. Tell him I must have
every penny back, or he’ll be in trouble! My reputation is quite bad enough already. If
I go on lending money at interest for another year, people will be wanting to eat me
up alive.’
‘It isn’t like you to be so timid, Mrs Lian,’ said Brightie’s wife, smiling. ‘Who would
dare to criticize you? It seems such a shame, after the work we’ve put into this, to
call all the money in again.’
‘ I don’t want it for myself in any case,’ said Xi-feng; ‘it was a means of
supplementing the housekeeping, because without it our expenditure was so much
greater than our income. Mr Lian’s and my allowance for the month, including the
allowances for four maids, is less than twenty taels: barely enough to keep us going
for four or five days. If I hadn’t scraped together a bit of extra on the side, I don’t
know what sort of hovel we should have been living in by now. And so now I’ve got
myself a bad name. I’m a usurer. Very well, I’ll call it all in again and stop lending
money altogether. I can spend money as fast as anyone else - though how we are
supposed to manage if we just all sit back and spend without a thought in our heads
for the future I fail to understand. Lady Wang spent two months worrying about how
she was going to manage for Her Old Ladyship’s birthday. In the end I reminded her
about four or five boxes of big, useless bronze things in the rear upstairs store-room
and suggested that we should try pawning them. We did, and raised three hundred
taels, which was barely enough to tide her over the celebrations. And you know of
course about my chiming clock. I sold that for three hundred and sixty taels, but in
less than half a month every penny of it had gone into paying bills. Now it seems the
menfolk are running short and someone has had the bright idea of trying to get
something out of Her Old Ladyship. Another year like this and we shall be pawning
our jewellery and our clothes!’
Brightie’s wife laughed.
‘Well, I dare say every one of you ladies has enough jewellery to keep you all for
the rest of your lives, if she had a mind to pawn it.’
‘No doubt it’s silly of me,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but personally I could never bring myself to
live like that. - Oh, I must tell you,’ she said, changing the subject, ‘I had rather a
funny dream last night. Someone - I didn’t know who he was, though he looked
familiar - came and told me that Her Grace had sent him to ask me for a hundred
lengths of brocade. I said “Which Her Grace?”. He told me a name, but it was the
wrong one, so I refused. Then he came forward and tried to take the stuff from me by
force. That was when I woke up.’
‘That’s because your obligations to Her Grace are so much on your mind during the
daytime,’ said Brightie’s wife, laughing.
The words were barely out of her mouth when a messenger from the Palace was
announced - a little eunuch sent by Xia Bing-zhong, the eunuch Master of the
Bedchamber. Jia Lian frowned when he heard the announcement.
‘I wonder what it is this time? You’d have thought he’d had enough out of us
already this year.’
‘Make yourself scarce and let me speak to him,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If it’s only a little thing
he wants, we needn’t worry; but if it’s something big he’s after, I think I know how to
handle this.’
Jia Lian slipped into one of the side rooms at the back, while Xi-feng gave orders for
the little eunuch to be brought in. She made him sit down and accept a cup of tea
before inquiring about the purpose of his visit.
‘Daddy Xia saw a house today that he would very much like to buy, but he’s two
hundred taels short of the price they are asking. He sent me to ask you if you happen
to have one or two hundred taels on you you could let him have just for the time
being. He will pay you back in a day or two.’
‘Why talk of paying back?’ said Xi-feng genially. ‘We’ve got plenty of money, just
help yourselves. Why don’t we just say that if we are ever short of money, we’ll come
and borrow some from you.’
‘Oh, Daddy Xia also told me to tell you that he still hasn’t paid back the twelve
hundred taels he owes you from the last two times, but he says he will definitely pay
it all back to you by the New Year.’
Xi-feng laughed.
‘Your Daddy Xia is an old fuss-pot, tell him. He really shouldn’t worry his head over
such trifles. I hope he won’t think I am complaining, but if everyone were as
scrupulous as he is about paying back the money they owe us, we should be
millionaires. About this money he wants now, though: I wonder if I have got that
much ready cash to give him. He’s certainly very welcome to it if I have.’
She called Brightie’s wife to her.
‘Pop out and see if you can get two hundred taels for me, will you? It doesn’t
matter where from.’
Brightie’s wife at once caught on to the little game her mistress was playing.
‘I’ve just been trying to get hold of some,’ she said brightly. ‘That’s why I’m here. I
couldn’t get any outside, so I thought you might have some.’
‘You people aren’t very resourceful,’ said Xi-feng crossly. ‘Why is it that when you
want money you always have to fall back on me?’
She called Patience in.
‘Patience, get out my two gold necklaces and see if you can pawn them for four
hundred taels.’
Patience left the room and came back presently with an embroidered box in which
were two magnificent collars of jewellery, every bit as fine as any that could be found
in the Palace, each carefully wrapped up in a piece of silk brocade. One of them was
made of gold wire and pearls the size of lotus-seeds; the other was of
kingfisher-feathers and gold, studded with precious stones. She went off with these
and returned some time later with the four hundred taels, half of which Xi-feng
wrapped up for the little eunuch, while the other half she handed over to Brightie’s
wife to buy presents for the Mid-Autumn festival with.
The little eunuch now took his leave. Xi-feng sent someone to carry the money for
him as far as the main gate.
‘These people really are a pest!’ said Jia Lian emerging from his hiding-place. ‘There
seems to be no end to their borrowing.’
‘Just as I’d been telling you about my dream,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Talk of the devil!’
‘Yesterday it was Chamberlain Zhou,’ said Jia Lian. ‘The first thing he said when he
opened his mouth was could I lend him a thousand taels. Because I hesitated a bit
before saying yes, he started looking huffy. I can see us making any number of
enemies this way. What we need right now is a windfall of forty or fifty thousand
taels!’
Patience came in to help Xi-feng wash and change preparatory to going over to wait
on Grandmother Jia at dinner. Jia Lian went off to his outside study. He had barely got
there when Lin Zhi-xiao came hurrying in, evidently bursting with some news. When
Jia Lian asked him what it was, he said that Jia Yu-cun bad been demoted.
‘I don’t know what it was for,’ he said. ‘It may not be true, in any case.’
‘Even if it’s not,’ said Jia Lian, ‘he’s sure to get thrown out of that job sooner or later.
We’d be well advised to have as little to do with him as possible.’
‘I’m sure you’re right, sir,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘But that’s easier said than done. Sir She
is on very good terms with him, and Sir Zheng likes him. Everyone knows that he is a
regular visitor here.’
‘Well, I suppose as long as we don’t get involved in any of his schemes it shouldn’t
matter,’ said Jia Lian. ‘You’d better go and make some more inquiries. Find out if he
really has been demoted, and if so, what for.’
Lin Zhi-xiao said he would do so, but showed no inclination to leave. Instead he sat
down in a chair and began talking to Jia Lian about this and that. Presently they got
on to the subject of the household’s financial difficulties. Lin Zhi-xiao took the
opportunity of airing his own idea of a solution.
‘We’ve got too big a staff,’ he said. ‘We ought to pick a day when there’s no other
business on hand and ask Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng if we can’t give some of
those older servants who are a bit past it now an honourable discharge. It would be a
kindness to them, because they’ve all got little jobs of their own to fall back on, and
it would mean a big saving for us in the amount we have to spend every year on
wages and keep. And there’s another thing: there are far too many maids. As the
proverb says, “The times get worse but never better.” It’s no good trying to live in
the style we used to keep up twenty or thirty years ago. If every apartment which in
the past used to employ eight girls were now to employ six and those which used to
employ four girls were to make do with two, the saving in wages and keep would be
enormous. Most of those girls are in any case old enough now to be married. If we
pair them off now with our boys, before we know where we are they will be breeding
new servants for us.’
‘I’m entirely in agreement with you,’ said Jia Lian. ‘The trouble is that as Sir Zheng
has only just got back, he doesn’t want to be bothered with anything yet. At the
moment even quite important matters are having to be shelved. We’d never get him
to discuss a small domestic matter like this. A couple of days ago an official
marriage-broker came round here with all her credentials, wanting to arrange a
match between her client’s son and one of our young ladies, but Lady Wang said that
Sir Zheng was so happy to be home again with his family all around him - she says
he’s hardly stopped talking about “family togetherness” since the day he got back -
that she felt sure it would upset him to have to talk about the girls getting married
and leaving home, and she forbade anyone to mention it to him.’
‘Why, I’m sure that’s as it should be,’ said Lin Zhi-xiao. ‘Her Ladyship is a very
thoughtful lady.’
‘Talking of marriage-brokers, that reminds me,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Our Brightie’s boy
wants to marry Sunset from Her Ladyship’s room and Brightie’s wife has been asking
me if I would arrange it for them. It seems to me that it’s hardly important enough
for that. Could one of you go round and see the girl’s father for me? You could tell
him that it has my approval.’
Lin Zhi-xiao agreed to do so, but without much enthusiasm. After a longish pause he
added,
‘I think if I was you, sir, I wouldn’t get myself involved. That boy of Brightie’s is only
a lad, but already he’s drinking too much and gambling and getting up to all sorts of
capers. I know they’re only slaves, but marriage is for a lifetime, after all. I haven’t
seen Sunset myself for some years, but by all accounts she’s grown up into a very
presentable young woman. It would seem a pity to throw her away on the likes of
him.’
‘Oh, so Brightie’s boy has been misbehaving, has he?’ said Jia Lian. ‘It seems to me
that it’s not a wife he needs but a thundering good hiding. I think you’d better give
him one to get on with and then lock him up and ask his parents what they propose
to do about him.’
Lin Zhi-xiao laughed.
‘We don’t have to do that now, surely? Next time he gives trouble, we’ll let you
know and you can deal with him then. It doesn’t seem quite the time to tackle him
about it now.’
Jia Lian made no reply and Lin Zhi-xiao shortly afterwards got up and left.
That evening Xi-feng summoned Sunset’s mother to her in order to propose the
marriage with Brightie’s son. Sunset’s mother had all along been opposed to it, but it
was so flattering to have Xi-feng talking to her like this, woman to woman, that she
found herself agreeing to everything in spite of her?self. When, some time after she
had left, Jia Lian returned, Xi-feng asked whether he had spoken yet to the father.
‘No, I haven’t,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I was going to talk to him about it, but then I heard
that that boy of Brightie’s is turning out a thoroughly bad lot, so I put it off. If what
they told me about him is true, I think we ought to give him a good, sharp lesson or
two before we set about getting a wife for him.’
‘None of us Wangs seem to find much favour with you people nowadays,’ said
Xi-feng frostily. ‘I suppose since I don’t meet with your approval, it’s hardly surprising
that you should be dissatisfied with my servants. I’ve already spoken to her mother
about it and she was overjoyed. What am I supposed to do now? Call her in again
and tell her it’s all off?’
‘No, no,’ said Jia Lian. ‘If you’ve already arranged it with her mother, it will have to
stand. But you’ll have to have a word with Brightie tomorrow and tell him to do
something about that boy.’
Our narrative moves at this point to the unfortunate object of these manoeuvrings.
*
When, some days previous to this, Lady Wang sent Sunset back home to her parents,
it was on the express understanding that they might choose for her whatever
son-in-law they wished. Brightie’s visits to her parents filled Sunset with foreboding.
Her union with Jia Huan had not yet been approved, but she had long since given her
heart to him and knew that she could never be happy with Brightie’s son. When,
shortly after that, she learned that Brightie’s son was a drunkard and a gambler and
hideously ugly into the bargain, she became even more alarmed. The fear that
Brightie and his wife might use their influence with Xi-feng to force her parents to
accept the match finally made her so frantic that, on the evening of the day on which
these other events took place, she told her younger sister, Moonrise, to go in secret
to Aunt Zhao and try to find out exactly what was happening.
Now Aunt Zhao had always got on well with Sunset and had been longing for the day
when Sunset could become Jia Huan’s concubine, thus providing her at the same
time with an ally. It was an unexpected blow to her when Sunset was sent back home
to her parents, and she was constantly urging Jia Huan to go and ask Lady Wang if he
might have her for himself; but partly because Jia Huan was too bashful to open his
mouth about it, and partly because he did not in any case care about her very much
(after all, he thought, she was only a maid; there would be plenty even better than
her in the future) he hung back, hoping that the matter would eventually be dropped.
But Aunt Zhao did not give up so easily, and the night that Sunset sent her younger
sister to see her she tried to enlist Jia Zheng’s support. Jia Zheng was unenthusiastic.
‘What’s the hurry?’ he said. ‘Wait until the boys have spent another year or two at
their studies, it will be soon enough then. I’ve already got my eye on a couple of girls,
one for Bao-yu and one for Huan, but I think they are too young yet. I am afraid that
if they had the girls now, it would get in the way of their studies. You can speak to me
about this again in a year or two’s time.’
Aunt Zhao would have gone on trying, but just at that moment there was a loud
crash outside which made them both jump.
You will have to look at the next chapter, however, in order to find out what caused
it.
CHAPTER 73

A half-witted servant-girl picks up a
highly embarrassing object
And an easy-going young mistress refuses
to inquire into a theft



As we were saying at the end of the last chapter, Aunt Zhao and Jia Zheng were
interrupted in the midst of their dis?cussion by a sudden crash. The maids, when
questioned, said that it had been caused by an outer casement of one of the
windows falling. It could not have been properly fastened and must have slipped its
catch. After first roundly cursing them, Aunt Zhao went outside with them to
supervise its replacement. When she came in again, she helped Jia Zheng to settle
down for the night. And so we leave them.
*
Meanwhile, over at Green Delights, Bao-yu had just gone to bed. The maids were
themselves on the point of doing so when a sudden knocking was heard at the
courtyard gate. The old woman who opened it recognized the caller as a maid of
Aunt Zhao’s called Magpie, and asked her what she wanted; but instead of answering,
the girl pushed past her and rushed straight inside. She found Bao-yu already lying
down, but engaged in bantering conversation with Skybright and a couple of other
maids who were sitting on the edge of his bed.
     ‘What’s the matter?’ they asked when they saw who their visitor was. ‘What
brings you out at this hour?’
     ‘I’ve come to warn you,’ said Magpie, addressing herself in an urgent whisper to
Bao-yu. ‘I heard my mistress just now jabbering to Sir Zheng about something, and
though I couldn’t make out what they were talking about, I heard him say “Bao-yu” a
couple of times. I thought I’d better put you on your guard in case he asks to see you
tomorrow about anything.’
     She turned and hurried out again as soon as she had finished speaking. Aroma
told someone to run after her and ask her to stay for a cup of tea, but she was afraid
of being shut inside the Garden when they closed the gate, and insisted on going
back immediately.
     Bao-yu knew that in Aunt Zhao’s twisted imagination he was regarded as an
enemy, and though he did not know what she had said, the mere fact that she had
been talking about him was enough to make him feel uncomfortable all over, much
as Monkey did when he heard Tripitaka reciting the spell for tightening the iron band
round his head. After giving the matter some thought, he concluded that the only
practical way in which he could prepare himself for the morrow would be by revising
his texts. Should his father take it into his head to test him, he reasoned, then if only
he could be word-perfect in his texts, it would not be so difficult to bluff his way
through whatever else he might ask him. Having made the decision, he hurriedly
threw a gown over his shoulders and prepared to begin some revision, bitterly
regretting that Jia Zheng’s silence on the subject of lessons since his last return from
duty had lulled him into a false sense of security.
      ‘I ought to have had more sense,’ he told himself. ‘One really ought to do a little
bit every day, to keep in practice.’
      He began to reckon up how much he could still recite from memory. He found
that there was little more than The Great Learning, The Doctrine of the Mean and
the two halves of the Analects that he could be absolutely sure of. The first half of
Mencius he knew reasonably well, but certainly not well enough to be able to carry
on from any sentence given him at random. The second half was virtually terra
incognita. Of the Five Classics he was fairly familiar with the Poetry Classic because
he was frequently having to read bits of it in connection with his own versifying.
Though far from word-perfect, he probably knew it well enough to scrape through a
test. He could not remember any of the other classics at all; but fortunately his father
had so far never asked him to study them, so probably it would not matter. When it
came to Old Style Prose, the case was rather different. Over the past few years he
had read extracts from the Zuo, Gong-yang and Gu-liang commentaries on the Spring
and Autumn Annals and various Han and Tang pieces, but he had only dipped into
them as the fancy took him; he had not done any serious work on them. There was
certainly no question of his being able to remember them. There was even less
likelihood of his being able to pass muster on the Examination Essay. He had always
detested this style of writing in any case. The Sage himself didn’t write that way, he
argued, so how could one hope to expound the inner meaning of his teachings
through such a medium? It was no more than a device used by vulgar
fortune-seekers for starting themselves off on the golden road to success. Before he
left, Jia Zheng had selected a hundred of these essays for him to read; but Bao-yu had
only glanced at them occasionally, reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there as
some particularly felicitous expression or the extrava?gance, humour or melancholy
of the writer happened to catch his attention. He had never settled down to the
serious analytical examination of even a single essay.
      He began to revise; but the trouble was that whatever he revised now, he was
sure to be asked about something else next day, and the whole night would not be
long enough to revise everything. It soon became apparent that all he was
succeeding in doing was getting himself into an even worse state of nerves than he
had been in to begin with and, while studying to no purpose himself, preventing a
whole roomful of girls from sleeping as well.
      Aroma and the other senior maids could at least occupy themselves by trimming
his lamp, pouring him cups of tea and so forth; but the younger ones could neither
go to bed nor find any employment to keep themselves awake, and sat about the
place, drooping and nodding in various attitudes of fatigue. Skybright became
indignant.
      ‘Lazy little wretches! You sleep all day as it is. Just for once in your lives you are
asked to stay up late, and look at you! If you don’t liven yourselves up a bit, I shall
come and stick pins in you all!’
      As she said this, there was a loud bang from the outer room. It turned out to
have been caused by a little maid who had dozed off while sitting on the kang and in
doing so had bumped her head against the partition. Waking with a start just as
Skybright was uttering this threat, she assumed that the bump on the head she had
just received must have been dealt her by Skybright. To the great amusement of the
other girls she began tearfully begging her for mercy.
      ‘Oh no! Please, Skybright! I promise I won’t do it again!’
      ‘Don’t punish her,’ Bao-yu called out. ‘You ought to allow those younger ones to
go to bed. And you older ones too - you don’t all need to stay up. You should be
taking it in turns to get some sleep.’
      ‘Little ancestor!’ said Aroma exasperatedly. ‘You get on with your work! Just for
this one night try to concentrate all your energies on studying. Once you’ve got over
this hurdle; you can make what other arrangements you like!’
     She sounded so earnest that for the next few minutes Bao-yu did in fact
concentrate on his revision. Musk handed him a cup of tea to moisten his lips with
while he recited. In taking it from her he noticed that she had only a short tunic on
over her pantaloons.
     ‘It gets very cold at this time of night,’ he said. ‘You really ought to put
something else on.’
     Musk smiled grimly and pointed at his book.
     ‘Just forget about me for a while, could you? Get your mind fastened on this!’
     Hardly had she finished saying this than Parfumée - or Aventurin’ as Bao-yu now
called her - came running in from outside in a panic.
     ‘Oh God! A man’s just jumped down from the wall!’
     ‘Where? Where?’ cried the others, and began shouting for the older servants to
go and look.
     To Skybright this scare came as a blessing in disguise. Observing what heavy
weather Bao-yu was making of his revision and foreseeing that if he wore himself out
by staying up all night he would be in no condition for facing his ordeal in the
morning, she had been casting about desperately for some means of rescuing him
from it altogether. This panic about an intruder gave her an idea.
      ‘Why don’t you take advantage of this to get off tomorrow?’ she asked him. ‘Tell
them that the shock has made you ill.’
      This was a suggestion after Bao-yu’s own heart. He had the watch called and
ordered them to light their lanterns and make a thorough search. But no intruder
could be found.
      ‘I expect one of you young ladies had to go out for something in the dark and
being still half-asleep, took the bough of a tree moving in the wind for a man,’ they
said.
      ‘Nonsense!’ said Skybright. ‘You only say that as an excuse, because you haven’t
been keeping watch properly and you’re afraid of getting into trouble. It wasn’t only
one of us who saw him; a whole lot of us did; and Bao-yu was with us. The shock of it
has made him quite ill. His face looks terrible and he’s burning hot all over. I shall be
going over to Her Ladyship’s presently to get him a sedative. She’s sure to ask me
what has upset him. What am I supposed to tell her? That he took fright from looking
at a tree?’
      This seemed to scare the women, for they made no reply but hurried off again
to continue their search. Meanwhile Skybright and Aventurin went off to ask for
some pills, deliberately making as big a fuss as possible to make sure that everyone
knew that Bao-yu had been taken ill as a result of seeing something alarming in the
Garden. Lady Wang sent someone to fetch the medicine for the two girls and gave
orders for the members of the watch to make a full investigation. She was
particularly anxious that the pages from the inner gate who did night duty at the
point nearest to the Garden should be subjected to careful questioning. As a result of
these orders there was a general hubbub in the Garden throughout all the rest of
that night: lanterns and torches bobbing about and people scurrying to and fro in all
directions. At four o’clock in the morning the stewards and stewardesses were
summoned from their quarters and ordered to investigate all those servants of either
sex who had been on night duty in the mansion.
     When Grandmother Jia learned that Bao-yu was suffering from shock, she
wanted to know why. The others were obliged to tell her.
     ‘I didn’t expect a thing like this to happen,’ she said. ‘It would be bad enough if
the people who are supposed to be keeping us safe at night were merely being
careless. What worries me is the thought that some of them may be criminals
themselves!’
     Lady Xing and You-shi had not long since arrived for their morning duty, and Li
Wan, Xi-feng and the girls were also there in attendance. None of them dared say
anything. In the end it was Tan-chun who, smiling, stepped forwards and broke the
silence.

       ‘It’s because Cousin Feng hasn’t been very well during these last few months,’
she said. ‘The servants in the Garden have got much more careless than they used to
be. At first it was only once in a while: three or four doing night duty on the same
shift getting together for a little game of dice or cards to keep themselves awake. But
gradually they became more reckless, until now there are regular little card-schools
with their own bankers and forty or fifty strings of cash changing hands at a sitting. A
fortnight ago it even reached a point where a fight broke out over the cards.’
       ‘If you knew this at the time, why didn’t you tell anyone?’ said Grandmother Jia
with some asperity.
       ‘I didn’t tell Mother because I knew she was busy and not feeling very well,’ said
Tan-chun. ‘I did tell sister-in-law though, and the stewardesses and the women were
given several warnings. As a matter of fact, I think they have been a bit more careful
since then.’
       ‘You’re only a child,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You don’t know how serious this is.
You think that gambling is a trifling matter and that the only thing to be feared from
it is an occasional quarrel. But where there is gambling, there is probably drinking as
well; and if there is drinking, probably gates are being left unlocked so that people
can slip out to buy things; and when that happens, before you know where you are
they will be letting thieves in - the easiest thing in the world when it is dark and there
are so few people about. And then - Heaven help us! - with only you girls living there
and the maids and women who wait on you - some of them no better than they
should be, I dare say - anything could happen. There are things worse than burglary,
the mere suspicion of which could have the direst consequences for all of you. No,
this is not a matter to be dismissed so airily!’
      After such a snub, Tan-chun could only sit down again in silence.
      Xi-feng was still far from well and her usual ebullience was very much in
abeyance, but she managed to summon up some energy when she saw how
seriously the old lady was displeased. She made a point of observing how
unfortunate it was that such things ‘had to happen’ when she was ill, then, sending
for Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife and three of the other principal stewardesses, she subjected
them to a thorough dressing-down in Grandmother Jia’s and everyone else’s
presence. When Xi-feng had finished with them, Grandmother Jia ordered them to
find out who the chief organizers were and all the others who had been taking part in
the gambling. She em?powered them to offer rewards for information and to punish
those who withheld it.
     Seeing Grandmother Jia so angry, the stewardesses dared not attempt to cover
up for their own kinswomen and friends, of whom there were several among the
older women of the watch. Going at once into the Garden, they summoned all the
women together and proceeded to grill them, one by one, without distinction of
persons. They met at first with a certain amount of resistance, but in the end, as will
almost invariably happen when the questioning is sufficiently patient and persistent,
the waters subsided and the rocks began to appear. By the time they had finished
their interrogations it was established that there were three principal organizers,
eight subsidiary ones, and a score or more gamblers who had availed themselves of
their services. All of these were taken at once to Grandmother Jia’s place, and were
soon to be observed kneeling down in rows in her courtyard, knocking their heads
upon the pavement and begging for mercy.
     Grandmother Jia began by asking for the names of the three principal organizers
and the amounts of money in their ‘banks’. Of the three it turned out that one was a
cousin on the mother’s side of Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, one a younger sister of Cook Liu,
and the other one Ying-chun’s nurse. The other eight organizers, who had operated
on a smaller scale, were also named, but their identities need not concern us.
Grandmother Jia ordered all the dice and playing-cards to be collected together and
burnt. The money from the banks she ordered to be confiscated and divided up
among the other servants. She sentenced the principal offenders to receive forty
strokes of the heavy bamboo, to be dismissed, and never to be employed by the
family again. The others were to receive twenty strokes, lose three months’ pay, and
in future be employed in cleaning out the latrines. After passing these sentences, she
formally reprimanded Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife for having permitted such things to happen.
      Lin Zhi-xiao’s wife, let down by her own relation and twice rebuked in public,
was not the only person present to feel humiliated. Ying-chun, sitting among the
other cousins next to Grandmother Jia, felt equally humiliated when it was revealed
that her own nurse was one of the principal offenders. Dai-yu, Bao-chai and Tan-chun
felt sorry for her and rose to intercede for the old woman.
      ‘Couldn’t you, for Ying-chun’s sake, let her off this once?’ they pleaded. ‘She
isn’t an habitual gambler. It’s just that once in a while she gets carried away.
      ‘You none of you know what you are talking about,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘These old nannies are all the same. They think that because they suckled you when
you were babies it entitles them to special treatment now. They’re worse trouble
than all the other servants put together, because whenever they have done wrong
they think they can always get you to cover up for them. I know. I have had a lot of
experience of these people. I need to make an example of one of them, and this one
will do very well. You leave this to me. I know what I am doing.’
      The three girls were obliged to let the matter drop.
      Soon it was time for the old lady’s siesta and all of those present withdrew. But
because they knew she was angry, they did not all go back to their own apartments.
Some of them waited around so as to be on hand when she had finished resting.
You-shi called in at Xi-feng’s place to chat, but finding Xi-feng too much out of sorts
for conversation, went into the Garden to talk to Li Wan and the girls. Lady Xing, too,
after sitting for a while at Lady Wang’s place, went off to take a walk in the Garden.
She had got no farther than the Garden gate, however, when one of the junior maids
from Grandmother Jia’s apartment, a girl called Simple, almost bumped into her. The
girl was walking along chuckling delightedly to herself, intent on some brightly
coloured object. Because she was so intent on what she was holding, she had not
seen Lady Xing coming towards her and only looked up and checked herself when
she was almost upon her.
‘Well now, Simple,’ said Lady Xing, ‘you seem very pleased with yourself. What
marvellous thing have you got there? Let me have a look.’
Simple, just turned fourteen, had only recently been selected to help with the rough
work in Grandmother Jia’s apartment. She had a hefty body, a broad face and an
enormous pair of feet. A willing and effective worker in the heavier sort of jobs
requiring no intelligence, she was nevertheless so stupid as to be almost half-witted
and as ignorant and innocent almost as the day she was born. Much of what she said
was uninten?tionally amusing. Grandmother Jia was endlessly diverted by her and
always allowed her mistakes to go unreproved. It was she who had given her the
name ‘Simple’. When Simple had no work to do, she would often go into the Garden
to play. On this occasion she had gone into the Garden to look for crickets behind the
rocks of the artificial mountain just inside the gate, and in doing so, had come upon a
beautifully embroidered purse. The design embroidered on it consisted not of the
usual birds and flowers, but on one side of a pair of naked human figures locked
together in an embrace and on the other of some writing. Simple was too innocent
to under?stand what the naked couple were up to. After giving the matter some
thought, she had decided that they must be either two demons fighting or two
people wrestling, but could not make up her mind which of these was the correct
interpretation. She was on her way, chuckling delightedly over her find, to ask
Grandmother Jia’s opinion on the matter when she nearly ran into Lady Xing.
‘I think you’ve said the right word, Your Ladyship,’ said Simple. ‘It is a marvellous
thing. You just look!’
Lady Xing took the proffered bag. She examined the picture on it with a start.
‘Where did you find this?’ she asked, seizing Simple roughly by the arm.
‘I found it behind the rocks,’ said Simple, ‘when I was looking for crickets.’
‘Don’t tell anyone else about this,’ said Lady Xing. ‘This is a bad thing, Simple. If you
weren’t such a simpleton, they would give you a beating just for touching it. Don’t
ever say a word about it to anyone else!’
Simple turned pale with fright.
‘No, no, I won’t.’
She made Lady Xing a kotow and went off, round-eyed, with her mouth gaping
foolishly open.
Lady Xing looked around her. There were only maids in sight, and she obviously could
not give the embroidered purse to one of them, so she stuffed it up her sleeve. She
was very puzzled to think where it could have come from; but no trace of what she
felt was allowed to show itself on her face as she made her way through the Garden
towards Ying-chun’s apartment.
Ying-chun was still brooding disconsolately over her nurse’s guilt when her mother’s
arrival was announced. She hurried out to welcome her. As soon as Lady Xing was
seated and had been given tea, she began laying into her.
‘You’re not a child now. If you knew your nurse was doing this sort of thing, for
Heaven’s sake why couldn’t you have spoken to her about it? Other people’s nurses
don’t seem to get into trouble, why does it have to be yours? I don’t understand
you!’
Ying-chun hung her head and fiddled with her sash. It was some time before she
answered.
‘I did speak to her about it, on two occasions, but she wouldn’t listen to me. What
could I do? She’s my nurse. She’s supposed to tell me what to do, not the other way
round.’
‘Rubbish!’ said Lady Xing. ‘She’s entitled to tell you off if you’ve done something
wrong, but in a case like this where she was the guilty one, it was up to you to
behave towards her like a mistress. Then, if she still wouldn’t obey you, you ought to
have come and told me. As it is, you have let things slide until everyone knows about
it and all the rest of us are involved in the disgrace. I just don’t know what you think
you are at. Incidentally, if she was banker to a card-school, she must have had to get
money from somewhere to start it with. I shouldn’t be a bit surprised to find that
she’d talked you into lending her clothes or jewellery that she could pawn in order to
raise her capital. You’re such a soft, flabby creature, you’d be just as likely as not to
lend them to her. Well all I can say is, if she has and you don’t get them back from her,
it’s no good coming to me for the money, for I’ve none to give you; so what you will
do when festival time comes and you need your things I can’t imagine.’
Ying-chun continued to hang her head and say nothing. Lady Xing found her
unresponsiveness provoking.
‘Your mother was one of Sir She’s chamber-wives,’ she said, ‘and your Cousin Tan’s
mother was a chamber-wife as well, so you and she had the same sort of start in life.
As a matter of fact your mother was ten times better than that Zhao woman, so you
ought by rights to be better than your Cousin Tan. But you’re not. You’re not her
equal in any single respect. I don’t know, I’d have been better off without any
children at all. Those I have only make me look ridiculous.’
‘Mrs Lian is here,’ one of the servants announced.
‘Huh!’ said Lady Xing scornfully; and then again, ‘Huh!’
‘Tell her to go back home and take care of her illness,’ she said to the waiting
servant. ‘Tell her I have no need of her services.’
As that servant went out, another one, who had been sent to Grandmother Jia’s
place to act as a look-out, came in to report that the old lady was now awake. Lady
Xing got up to go. Ying-chun saw her out as far as the courtyard gate.
‘There you are!’ said Tangerine when Ying-chun got back. ‘When I told you the
other day that that pearl-and-gold phoenix had disappeared, you wouldn’t even ask
about it. I told you that Nannie had probably nicked it to pawn, but you wouldn’t
believe me. You said, “I expect Chess is looking after it.” Well, I asked Chess, because
although she is in, she is still perfectly clear in her mind, and she said, “No, I haven’t
touched it. It ought still to be in the casket on the bookshelf, ready for wearing at the
Mid-Autumn festival.” Now why don’t you send someone to Nannie right away and
ask her what she’s done with it?’
‘There’s no need to ask,’ said Ying-chun. ‘It’s perfectly obvious that she took it
because she was temporarily out of cash and needed the money from it to tide her
over. She quietly removed it when no one was looking, and I assumed that after a
few days had gone by, when she was in funds again, she would redeem it and quietly
slip it back again. I expect she forgot. In any case, there’s not much point in asking
her after what has happened today.’
‘She never forgot!’ said Tangerine. ‘She knew from past experience that you’d
never do anything, that’s why she didn’t put it back. I think I know what to do,
though. I’ll go and tell Mrs Lian about it, and either she’ll ask Nannie about it herself,
or better still, she’ll send someone with a few strings of cash round to the pawnshop
and get it back for you straight away.’
‘You’ll do no such thing!’ said Ying-chun. ‘Much better leave well alone. I’d rather
do without the thing than stir up a lot more trouble.’
‘Why are you so feeble?’ said Tangerine exasperatedly. ‘All this “saving trouble”!
One of these days they’ll carry you off with the loot! I’m going, anyway.’
She began to do so. Ying-chun said nothing and made no attempt to prevent her.
Unknown to them both, however, Zhu-er’s wife - the daughter-in-law of the old nurse
they were talking about - had all this time been listening outside the door. She had
come intending to ask Ying-chun to put in a plea for her mother-in-law, but held back
when she heard Ying-chun and Tangerine discussing the pearl-and-gold phoenix.
Because Ying-chun was so weak and unassertive, Zhu-er’s wife would not normally
have regarded the discovery by her of one of her mother-in-law’s depredations as a
matter of very much consequence; but when she heard Tangerine insisting that
Xi-feng should be informed, she could see that unless something were done to
prevent this, the consequences could be very serious indeed. At this point, therefore,
she hurried in to try and stop her.
‘Now, now, Miss Tangerine,’ she said, smiling rather unnaturally, ‘don’t go making
trouble! Our old missus was a bit silly about that pearl-and-gold phoenix, I will admit.
She’d lost a bit at the cards and couldn’t recoup, so she took it as a loan. Naturally
she never expected that all this trouble would break out before she’d had a chance to
put it back. But be that as it may, it’s the mistress’s property, and we’ve no intention
of forgetting about it. Sooner or later we fully intend to redeem it for her. I’d hardly
be here now if we didn’t, would I? I’ve come to ask the mistress, for the sake of the
milk she sucked from her as a baby, to go to Her Old Ladyship and plead with her for
our old missus.’
‘My dear good woman,’ said Ying-chun, ‘if that is what you are hoping for, then the
sooner you disabuse yourself of that hope the better. I am not going to plead for your
mother?in-law. You can wait from now until this time next year if you like, but I will
still not do it. Miss Bao and Miss Lin and the others have tried already and Her Old
Ladyship refused to listen to them. She’s even less likely to listen to me on my own. I
have already put up with enough humiliation for one day; I have no intention of
going to look for more.’
‘Whether or not you return that phoenix is one thing and whether or not the
mistress goes to plead for your mother-in-law is another,’ said Tangerine. ‘Don’t try to
confuse the issue. I hope you’re not suggesting that if the mistress doesn’t do what
you ask for your mother-in-law, you won’t redeem the phoenix? I think you ought to
redeem the phoenix first and start talking about that other matter after you have
brought it back.’
Ying-chun’s refusal and Tangerine’s sharp rebuke put Zhu?-er’s wife out of
countenance and left her momentarily at a loss for words, but she quickly found her
tongue again and, as if openly contemptuous of Ying-chun’s easy-going nature, began
taking noisy issue with Tangerine in her mistress’s presence.
‘Don’t be so high and mighty, Miss Tangerine! If you look around at the other
apartments in this household, you’ll find that there isn’t a single one in which the
nannies don’t take some advantage of their position to get a few perks. I don’t see
why only in our case you should be so pernickety. If you are a bit light-fingered, of
course, that’s another matter! Ever since Miss Xing came to live with us, Lady Xing
has insisted on a tad a month being stopped out of her allowance to help pay for her
mother. That means that though we now have two mistresses here in the place of
one - with all the extra expenses that that entails - we are having to manage on less
money a month instead of more. It’s hardly surprising that the mistresses are always
running short. And when they do, who is it that steps in and pays? We do. One way
and another, we must have paid out at least thirty taels by now, and from what I can
see, it was money down the drain.’
‘Thirty taels?’ said Tangerine indignantly. ‘How do you make that out? Just tell me
one or two of the things the mistress is supposed to have asked you for.’
Ying-chun had been made uneasy by the open reference to her mother’s meanness.
‘Now that’s enough!’ she told the woman. ‘If you can’t give the phoenix back, you
can’t. There’s no need to go dragging all these other matters into it and shouting
them around for everyone else to hear. I don’t want the thing, anyway. If mother asks
me about it, I shall tell her I’ve lost it. At least you won’t have anything to worry
about, so you might just as well go away and rest. What’s the point of making all this
fuss?’
She told Tangerine to pour her some tea. Tangerine was both angry and alarmed.
It’s all very well for you to take that way out, miss, but what about us? Not content
with depriving you of your gold phoenix, this woman is now pretending that you’ve
been spending their money and proposing to write off the phoenix to offset what
they’re supposed to have given you. If Lady Xing hears that and asks how you came
to be spending so much, it’s we servants who will take the blame. It isn’t fair!’
She burst into tears. Chess, who, as she lay ill in bed, had been listening with growing
impatience to what the others were saying, could now contain herself no longer.
Getting out of bed, she dragged herself over to take Tangerine’s part in the argument.
Ying-chun, finding that her single attempt at ending it had failed, picked up a volume
of Tai-shang’s Heavenly Rewards and Punishments and began to read.
While Zhu-er’s wife and the two maids were still at it hammer and tongs, Bao-chai,
Dai-yu, Bao-qin and Tan-chun arrived. Concerned that Ying-chun might still be feeling
distressed about her nurse, they had met together by prearrangement and come
over to try and cheer her up. Sounds of the wrangling going on inside were distinctly
audible as they entered her courtyard. Tan-chun walked over and, peeping through
the window, saw Ying-chun half-reclining on the day-bed reading a book, oblivious to
the noisy argu?ment that was going on only a few feet away from her. She laughed.
Just at that moment two junior maids raised the portiere for the visitors and
announced their arrival.
At once Ying-chun put her book down and rose to welcome them. The sight of these
newcomers - particularly as Tan-chun was one of them - caused the woman to stop of
her own accord and she took the opportunity of slipping quietly outside.
‘Who was that talking in here just now?’ said Tan-chun as she took a seat. ‘It
sounded as if someone was having an argument.’
‘Oh, nothing,’ said Ying-chun, pleasantly. ‘Probably only the servants making their
usual fuss about nothing. Certainly not anything worth inquiring about.’
‘I’m sure I heard something about a “golden phoenix” just now,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I
distinctly heard someone say, “When she’s short of money, she always asks us
servants for some.” When who’s short of money? Not you, Ying, surely? You don’t ask
the servants for money, do you?’
‘You’re absolutely right, miss, she most certainly does not,’ said Chess and
Tangerine indignantly.
Tan-chun smiled.
‘Well, Ying, if it wasn’t you the woman I heard was talking about, perhaps it was me?
You’d better call her inside again and let me ask her.’
‘Now you’re being ridiculous,’ said Ying-chun, laughing. ‘Why be like this? It has
absolutely nothing to do with you.’
‘There you are wrong,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You and I are in the same boat. Our
circumstances are very similar. What she says affects me as much as it does you. It
would be just the same if you were to hear someone at my place complaining about
me. You would feel almost as though you were being criticized yourself. As mistresses,
you and I are above talking to servants about the petty cash. We may ask them for
things sometimes, as and when we require them, but that is another matter. Tell me,
though: how did a “pearl-and-gold phoenix” come to be mixed up in this discussion?’
Zhu-er’s wife, terrified lest Tangerine should seize this opportunity to denounce her,
came rushing in at this point and tried to put Tan-chun off the scent with her own
ex?tremely garbled account of what had happened. But Tan-chun showed that she
had a better understanding of the case than the woman supposed.
‘I think you are being very stupid,’ she said smilingly. ‘What you ought to do, now
that your mother-in-law has already got herself into trouble, is to go to Mrs Lian
before the money confiscated has been divided up and ask if you can have some of it
back to redeem this jewellery with. Ideally, of course, it would have been better if
you could have redeemed it before all this trouble broke out and saved yourselves a
bit of face. But now that you have no face left to save, you’d much better make a
clean breast of it and get the money. After all, your mother-in-law has already been
found guilty. However many crimes she’s committed, they can only cut her head off
once. You take my advice. Go round to Mrs Lian’s place as soon as possible and make
a clean breast of it. Standing around here shouting is not going to get you anywhere!’
The woman was forced to admit that Tan-chun’s reading of the situation was correct.
But she was too scared to go to Xi-feng and confess.
‘If I hadn’t heard you talking about this, it would have been none of my business,’
said Tan-chun. ‘But now that I have heard, I think you had better let me take over and
do the explaining for you.’
Unknown to the others, Tan-chun had tipped Scribe the wink a minute or two
previously and Scribe had slipped outside to summon help. It was no surprise to
Tan-chun, therefore, that Patience should have walked in just as she was saying this;
but to the others her appearance at that moment was little short of miraculous.
Bao-qin clapped her hands delightedly.
‘I always knew Cousin Tan was a witch. Now here comes her familiar spirit!’
‘It’s not witchcraft, it’s generalship,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Don’t you remember what it says
in The Art of War?
A shy maiden in defence, but swift as a hare in the attack.
In good generalship surprise is of the essence.’
A look from Bao-chai caused the two girls to drop their bantering and talk of
something else while Tan-chun addressed herself to the new arrival.
‘Is your mistress any better yet?’ she asked Patience. ‘She seems to have
completely lost her grip on things since she had this illness. It’s very unfortunate for
people like me who have to put up with the consequences.
‘Oh?’ said Patience in some surprise. ‘Has someone been giving you trouble, miss?
If you will let me know what I can do, I am at your disposal.’
Zhu-er’s wife was now in a panic. She bounded up to Patience and was all over her
before Tan-chun could get a word in.
‘Sit down while I tell you, Miss Patience. I can explain it all.’
Patience gave her a long, hard look.
‘Miss Tan and I are talking. What right have you to come butting in like this? If you
had any manners at all, you wouldn’t even be in this room, you’d be waiting
respectfully outside. Whoever heard of an outside servant going into one of the
young mistresses’ apartments without being asked?’
‘Manners?’ said Tangerine. ‘You won’t find many around here. People barge in and
out of this apartment as they please.’
‘It’s your fault then if they do,’ said Patience sharply. ‘If Miss Ying is too gentle to do
so, you ought to throw them out yourselves and then go and report them to Her
Ladyship.’
Zhu-er’s wife reddened at Patience’s rebuke and took herself outside.
‘Now I can answer your question,’ Tan-chun said to Patience. ‘This is not actually
my affair. If it were, perhaps I shouldn’t have minded quite so much. What happened
is that this woman’s mother-in-law, trading on the fact that she used to be Miss Ying’s
wet-nurse when she was a baby and taking advantage of Miss Ying’s easy-going
nature, took some of her jewellery without telling her in order to raise money for her
gambling. As if that wasn’t enough, this woman had the gall to pretend that Miss
Ying owed them money in order that she could blackmail her into interceding for her
mother-in-law. I found her and these two maids shouting at each other in Miss Ying’s
bedroom while Miss Ying sat by helpless. Now that you are here, I should like to ask
you this question. Is this woman really so thick-witted that she doesn’t know any
better, or has someone else put her up to this? I mean, is there some plan to
undermine Miss Ying first and then, when she is safely out of the way, to get to work
on me and on Miss Xi?’
‘Oh miss!’ said Patience, endeavouring to treat the question as a joke, ‘how could
you? Mrs Lian is not as bad as that!’
‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ said Tan-chun coldly. ‘You know the saying: “Like grieves for
like; for when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.” When I saw what was
happening to Miss Ying, I couldn’t help feeling nervous.’
Patience turned to Ying-chun questioningly.
‘It would be easy enough to deal with this matter if it weren’t that this woman is
the wife of your foster-brother. It’s really up to you, miss.’
Ying-chun had all this time been sitting shoulder to shoulder with Bao-chai, reading
one of the stories in Rewards-and-Punishments. She had not even heard what
Tan-chun had been saying and had only the haziest idea what was required of her
when she suddenly found herself being addressed. She smiled back, however, and
did her best to oblige.
‘Don’t ask me!’ she said. ‘There’s absolutely nothing that I can do about it. If they
will go getting themselves into trouble, they must face the consequences. All I can
say is that I can’t do anything to get their punishment reduced and I won’t do
anything to increase it. As for that object they took from me without telling me, if
they do bring it back I shall be happy to receive it; if they don’t bring it back I shall
not ask them for it. If either of Their Ladyships should ask me about it, I shall keep
the facts hidden from them if I can do so honourably, in which case these people may
consider themselves lucky; but if I can’t, I shall just have to tell them the truth. It is
quite out of the question that I should deliberately deceive Their Ladyships in order
to cover up for them. You say I am too easy-going and indecisive: if you know of a
better way of dealing with this matter that is both fool-proof and will not upset Their
Ladyships, by all means go ahead with it; I shall certainly not interfere.’
The others were much amused by this answer.
‘Ying-chun makes me think of that monk who went on discussing theological
matters while wolves and tigers prowled outside in his courtyard,’ said Dai-yu
laughing. ‘How on earth would she have controlled a great household like ours if she
had been a man?’
‘That’s begging the question,’ said Ying-chun, smiling. ‘There are plenty of men who
live off the fat of the land but who, in a crisis, are no better at dealing with things
than I. Anyway, Tai-shang says that of all works of merit helping people when they
are in trouble is the greatest. I may not be able to help anyone, but at least I am not
going out of my way to make things worse for them. What is the point of gratuitously
making enemies or exerting oneself for ends from which no one will benefit?’
Before she had finished, another visitor was heard arriving in the courtyard. Who this
was will be revealed in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 74

Lady Wang authorizes a raid
on Prospect Garden
And Jia Xi-chun breaks off relations
with Ning-guo House



Patience was greatly amused by the tone of Ying-chun’s answer to her inquiry.
Ying-chun’s further self-justification in reply to Dai-yu’s comment was cut short by
the arrival of another visitor. It was at this point that we concluded the last chapter.
The visitor was Bao-yu. When it was known that one of the chief organizers of the
gambling was Cook Liu’s younger sister, Cook Liu’s enemies in the Garden regarded
this as a good opportunity for making another attempt to oust her from her kitchen.
Going in a body to Xi-feng, they accused her of being in partnership with her sister
and receiving equal shares of her takings, and they demanded that Xi-feng should
take appropriate action to punish her. Cook Liu, when she heard this, was at first
panic-stricken; then, remembering her friends at Green Delights, she hurried over
there, taking great care that nobody saw her on the way, and begged Skybright and
Aventurin to tell Bao-yu what had happened. It occurred to Bao-yu, when they told
him, that as Ying-chun’s nurse was in trouble for the same offence, it would be more
effective to join forces with Ying-chun in pleading for clemency than to go along on
his own and plead only for Cook Liu. It was in order to discuss this matter that he had
come to see Ying-chun. Unfortunately, when he arrived, he found that she was not
alone.
‘Are you better now?’ the others asked him. (They supposed that he was still
suffering from shock.) ‘What have you come for?’
He could not state the real purpose of his visit in front of so many people and merely
told them that he had come ‘to see how Ying-chun was getting on’. The others
believed him, and a desultory conversation followed about nothing in particular.
Patience now went off to deal with the pearl-and-gold phoenix. Zhu-er’s wife
followed at her elbow, begging to be let off.
‘For charity’s sake, don’t tell her, miss! I promise you faithfully, that phoenix will be
redeemed.’
‘So you keep saying,’ said Patience, drily. ‘What a pity you couldn’t have redeemed
it a bit sooner and saved yourself this trouble! You want to wriggle out of this
somehow without telling her, don’t you? Well, I can’t say that I am very keen on
informing against you, myself. I’ll tell you what: you get that thing back as quickly as
possible and hand it over to me, and I won’t say anything about it to my mistress.’
Zhu-er’s wife was so relieved that she went down on her knees to thank her.
‘You carry on now with whatever you are doing, miss. I’ll have it ready for you by
this evening. I’ll bring it to show you as soon as I’ve redeemed it, and then I’ll take it
back to Miss Ying’s. How will that be?’
‘All right,’ said Patience. ‘But if you don’t turn up with it this evening, you will have
only yourself to blame for what happens.’
The two young women then went their separate ways.
‘Well?’ said Xi-feng, when Patience got back to her apartment. ‘What did Miss Tan
want you for?’
‘She was worried that you might have been fretting over this gambling business,’
said Patience, smiling. ‘She asked me how you’d been eating this last day or two.’
‘That’s very kind of her,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Oh, there’s more trouble, by the way. Some
of them have just been here accusing Cook Liu of being mixed up in the gambling
business with her sister. They’re saying, in fact, that she was the real or?ganizer.
However, remembering how insistent you always are that I should let well alone and
only think of my health, I took no action. Last time I ignored your advice and had
some?one punished, I not only offended Lady Xing but also ended up by making
myself ill. So this time I knew better. They can do as they please, I don’t care.
Someone else can do the worrying. I have nearly destroyed myself by worrying and
the only result of it is that everyone hates me. Very well. Now all I am going to think
about is getting better. And when I am better, I am going to turn myself into a Mr
Yes-yes. No matter what frightful things the others get up to, I shall just say “Yes, yes”
when I hear about them. “Yes, yes,” I shall say, and not give them a single other
thought!’
‘If only you would be like that,’ said Patience smiling, ‘what a blessing it would be
for us all!’
At that moment Jia Lian came in, sighing and striking his hands together with
vexation.
‘More trouble! When I borrowed that stuff from Faithful the other day to pawn,
how could Mother have got to hear about it? She had me over there just now and
asked me to borrow two hundred taels for her. She said she wanted it for the
Mid-Autumn festival. I said I didn’t know who I could borrow two hundred taels from
at the moment. “If you can’t borrow the money, you can easily find something to
raise it on,” she said. “Don’t always make excuses. Don’t know who to borrow it from,
indeed! You could spirit all those things out of Lady Jia’s room when you chose to, yet
now you make difficulties about raising a paltry two hundred taels for me! You’re
lucky I haven’t told anyone what you’ve been up to.” I’m certain Mother isn’t really
short of money. This is sheer, gratuitous trouble-making on her part.’
‘There were no outsiders here on that occasion,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I wonder how the
news could have leaked out.’
Patience, who had been listening to their conversation, tried hard to remember who
had been present. After some moments it came back to her.
‘I know. There was no one else here that day while you were talking to Faithful, but
in the evening, when she sent the stuff round, that mother of Simple’s who works for
Her Old Ladyship called in with some laundry and afterwards sat quite a long while
talking in the kitchen. If she saw that great trunk there, it would have been only
natural to ask what was inside it, and the maids might well have told her, without
realizing that they were not supposed to. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that’s how it
got about.’
She called some of the junior maids in to question them.
‘Which of you told Simple’s mother the other day what was in that trunk?’
The maids knelt down in terror and swore by the most sacred oaths that they had
said nothing.
‘We’re always most careful not to say too much to anyone. When people ask us
anything, we always say that we don’t know. We’d certainly never have told her
about that!’
Xi-feng considered the probabilities.
‘Somehow I don’t think they would have told her. At all events, there is no point in
harrving them about it now. We shall just have to put that question behind us. The
important thing now is to make sure that Mother gets what she wants. I’d rather we
went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble.’ She turned to
Patience. ‘Take some of my gold things again and get us another two hundred taels. -
As soon as she has the money ready, you can take it to Mother immediately, and that
should be the end of the matter,’ she told Jia Lian.
‘Might as well raise four hundred taels while you are about it,’ said Jia Lian. ‘We
could do with another two hundred ourselves.’
‘I don’t see that at all,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We don’t really need two hundred taels
ourselves. And in any case, if we raise so much now, where is the money coming from
later for getting the things out of pawn?’
Patience fetched the now familiar gold necklaces and told Brightie’s wife to take
them to the pawnshop. Soon afterwards Brightie’s wife was back again with the cash
and Jia Lian went in person to hand it over to his mother.
While Jia Lian was taking the money to Lady Xing, Xi-feng and Patience continued to
ask themselves who could have leaked the information about the surreptitious
removal of Grandmother Jia’s valuables.
‘It’s too bad!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Poor Faithful will be in trouble over this, and all because
of us.’
While they were still wondering who it could have been, Lady Wang was announced.
This was a surprise, for Xi-feng could think of no reason why she should be visiting
them. She and Patience hurried out to greet her.
Lady Wang had only one maid, a trusted junior, in attendance. There was an angry
expression on her face and she walked swiftly through the house into the inner room
and sat down grimly on the kang, all without uttering a word. Xi-feng, concealing her
apprehension behind a smile, hurriedly served her with tea.
‘It’s an unusual honour to have you here, Aunt.’
‘Patience, leave the room!’ Lady Wang commanded.
‘Yes’m,’ said Patience, wondering what on earth could be the matter, and hurried
out, taking all the other maids with her. She stood by the outer door until they were
all outside, then closed it after her and sat down at the top of the steps to prevent
anyone going in.
As Xi-feng, now thoroughly alarmed, watched her aunt and wondered why she had
come, Lady Wang, who appeared to be on the point of weeping, drew an
embroidered pouch from her sleeve and threw it on the kang.
‘Look at that!’
Xi-feng hastily picked it up and found herself, to her great surprise, looking at a lewd
picture, beautifully embroidered in silks.
‘Where did you get it from?’ she asked.
The tears that had collected in Lady Wang’s eyes poured down her cheeks now and
the voice in which she answered was choked and trembling.
‘Where did I get it from? I sit all day at the bottom of a well. As you seemed such a
conscientious young woman, I thought I could leave things to you and enjoy some
leisure, but it seems that you are no better at managing than I. Fancy leaving a thing
like that in the Garden - on a rockery, too, in broad daylight, where everyone could
see it! It was picked up by one of Grandmother’s maids. If your mother-in-law hadn’t
fortunately spotted the girl carrying it, it would have gone straight to Grandmother. I
think it’s for you to tell me how it came to be dropped there.’
It was Xi-feng’s turn to look angry.
‘How do you know it’s mine?’
Lady Wang sighed and shed a few more tears.
‘How can you ask me that? Who in this household apart from you and Lian could a
thing like this belong to? The old women would have no use for a thing like this and
none of the girls would know where to get one from. Obviously that wretched,
worthless Lian must have got hold of it from somewhere; and you, treating it, I
suppose, as a great joke, were only too happy to receive it from him. I know that
young couples do go in for this sort of thing; why try to deny it? But the young
people in the Garden are still innocent. Suppose one of their maids had picked it up
and shown it to them? It doesn’t bear thinking of. Or suppose a maid had picked it up
and told someone from outside that she had found it in the Garden? What sort of
reputation would that leave our family with? It would be better to die than that such
a thing should happen.’
A mixture of shame and exasperation caused the blood to rush into Xi-feng’s face.
She fell on her knees beside the kang. There were tears in her own eyes when she
answered, but they were tears of anger.
‘What you say is no doubt very reasonable, Aunt, and I have no wish to argue with
you, but I really don’t own anything like this and I really must ask you to reconsider
one or two of the things you have said. First of all, take another look at this bag. It
wasn’t made here. One can see at a glance that it is a poor commercial imitation of
“palace” embroidery. Even the tassels are the kind you would buy outside. I may be
young and frivolous, but I’d hardly be likely to want a trashy thing like this. Secondly,
this isn’t the sort of thing one would carry around with one. Even if it were mine, I
should keep it hidden somewhere in a secret place, not walk around with it on my
person, particularly if I were going into the Garden. The girls and I are always holding
each other and pulling each other about, so that if I were wearing a thing like this, it
would very quickly get noticed, and what should I feel like then, if one of the girls or
one of the maids were to look at it? Thirdly, I may be the only young married woman
with a husband in the family, but there are plenty of even younger married women
among the servants who are often in and out of the Garden. How can you be so sure
that it wasn’t one of them who dropped this bag? Then there are those younger
concubines of Sir She’s, like Carmine and Azure. Mother often takes one or two of
them with her when she goes into the Garden. They would be even more likely to
own a thing like this. And Zhen’s wife herself isn’t all that old, not to mention Lovey
and Dove, whom she frequently takes with her when she goes there. How do you
know it doesn’t belong to one of them? And in any case, there are so many maids in
the Garden, how can you be so sure that all of them are pure? There may be one or
two of the older ones who are not so innocent. One of them could have slipped out
on some pretext or other when no one was looking to flirt with the pages on the
inner gate and got it from one of them. It’s perfectly possible. But I can assure you
that I have never possessed a thing like this, and I know that Patience hasn’t either.
So I really must ask you to reconsider.’
Lady Wang was somewhat overwhelmed by this torrent of words, but had to admit
their reasonableness.
‘You can get up,’ she said with a sigh. ‘It was wrong of me to accuse you. I ought to
have known that a young woman of your breeding would not be guilty of such
unseemliness. I am afraid I was overwrought and allowed anger to get the better of
me. But what am I to do? Your mother-in-law saw fit to send this thing round to me
by a messenger. I was terribly upset when I unwrapped it and saw what it was.’
‘The first thing to do is to try not to be so upset,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If the servants
become aware that something is wrong, the chances of Grandmother getting to hear
about it will be much greater. If we can remain cool and carry out our investigations
in secret, we are much more likely to get at the truth, and even if we don’t, no one
outside is going to be any the wiser. We should pick four or five of our most trusted
servants to do the investigating - people like Zhou Rui’s wife and Brightie’s wife who
can be relied upon not to talk - and send them into the Garden as replacements of
the women who have been dismissed. The pretext for their investigations can be that
there are various things connected with the gambling that still remain to be cleared
up. The other thing we must do something about is the number of the maids. There
are far too many of them. As they get older, they begin to get grown-up ideas, and
one can never be quite sure that they may not get up to some mischief. It’s no good
waiting until something has actually happened before doing any?thing, because then
it will already be too late; on the other hand to begin large-scale dismissals straight
away would be very distressing for the girls and probably for us as well. It would be
better to wait until each maid either reaches a certain age or shows signs of growing
insubordinate, and then use the first slip she makes as grounds for dismissing her and
marrying her to one of the boys. In that way we can both avoid having trouble and at
the same time make a considerable reduction in our expenses.’
Lady Wang sighed.
‘You are of course right. But in fairness to our girls I think it must be said that they
are already making do with the absolute minimum of service. Not one of them has
more than two or three maids who are the least bit of use. The others are like a pack
of mischievous children. And I am not the only one who would feel unhappy about
cutting down the numbers; I think it highly probable that Grandmother, too, would
object. After all, things may be a bit difficult at present, but we can’t be all that poor.
I wouldn’t lay claim to any great riches, but I think I may perhaps be a little bit better
off than the rest of you. So if there is any talk of economy, I’d rather do without
my?self than see the girls suffer. The important thing now is to call in Zhou Rui’s wife
and one or two of our other women and get them to begin these secret
investigations for us as quickly as possible.’
Xi-feng at once called Patience in and explained what was wanted. Patience went out
again and within a short time had assembled five of Lady Wang’s and Xi-feng’s most
trusted retainers: Zhou Rui’s wife, Wu Xing’s wife and Zheng Hua’s wife from among
Lady Wang’s servants and Brightie’s wife and Happy’s wife from among Xi-feng’s.
Lady Wang thought they might not be enough for the sort of detailed investigation
she had in mind. While she was wondering who else to get, Wang Shan-bao’s wife
walked in.
Wang Shan-bao’s wife, like Goody Fei, was one of the servants who had been with
Lady Xing since her childhood and accompanied her when she came to the Jia
household as a bride. It was she, in fact, who had brought the embroidered bag to
Lady Wang, and she had trailed along to Xi-feng’s place out of curiosity, to see what
she would do about the discovery. Lady Wang’s past observation of these trusted
henchwomen of her sister-in-law had not been sufficient to make her mistrust them
and she welcomed this new arrival as a reinforcement.
‘Ah, just the person!’ she said as she caught sight of her. ‘After you have reported
back to your mistress, you will be able to go with these others into the Garden and
keep an eye on them for me.’
On a number of past visits to the Garden Wang Shan-bao’s wife had been greatly put
out by the failure of the maids there to show her the respect and consideration that
she felt to be her due; but dearly as she would have liked to teach those young
creatures a lesson, she had not so far found a sufficient pretext for doing so. This
discovery of an obscene object in the Garden was, in her eyes, a godsend, and her
recruitment by Lady Wang to play a part in the investigations arising out of it was the
kind of opportunity she had dreamed of.
‘We’ll get to the bottom of this easy enough, don’t you worry, madam,’ she said.
‘What you need in that Garden is more discipline, if you don’t mind my saying so, and
has been for some time. To see the way those young maids carry on there, you would
think they were princesses. They can have that whole place in an uproar, yet none of
us dares to breathe a word against them, for we know that if we did, they would go
running off to their young mistresses and get them to complain that it’s them we
have been criticizing: and that is a charge which none of us is willing to stand up to.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘Yes, I suppose the girls who wait on the young mistresses are inclined to be a bit
spoiled.’
‘The young mistresses’ maids are by no means the worst,’ said Wang Shan-bao’s
wife. ‘The worst of the lot is that Skybright that works in Bao-yu’s room. Because
she’s a bit better-looking than the others and a bit readier with her tongue, she goes
around dolled up all the time like a Xi-shi, putting everyone else in their place. She
likes the sound of her own voice, does that young woman, and she likes to have her
own way. If you say the slightest little thing to offend her, up fly her eyebrows and
she will begin telling you exactly what she thinks of you. Oh, she’s a proper little
madam, that one! Not much of the maidservant about her!’
A sudden recollection seemed to strike Lady Wang while Wang Shan-bao’s wife was
speaking. She turned to Xi-feng questioningly.
‘I remember last time I was in the Garden with Lady Jia seeing a maid, a
snaky-waisted girl with narrow, sloping shoulders and something of your Cousin Lin
about the eyes, shouting at one of the junior maids, and thinking what a thoroughly
objectionable young woman she must be. I didn’t say anything at the time because I
was with Lady Jia. I meant to try and find out who she was afterwards, but I forgot. I
wonder if this is the same girl? It sounds uncommonly like her.’
‘Skybright is certainly the best-looking of the maids,’ said Xi-feng cautiously, ‘and as
regards her behaviour and manner of speaking, I suppose you could say she is
inclined to be a little too free. The person you describe certainly sounds as if it might
have been her, but as I wasn’t myself there at the time, I wouldn’t like to say for sure
that it was.’
‘There’s no need to go on wondering,’ said Wang Shan?bao’s wife. ‘We can call her
here this minute and Her Ladyship can see for herself whether it’s her or not.’
‘Whenever I see anyone from Bao-yu’s room, it’s always either Aroma or Musk,’
said Lady Wang. ‘Both of them are the kind of plain, simple girl I like. They would
never send the kind of girl we are talking about to see me because they know that
that is just the sort of creature I cannot abide. Oh dear! One can’t help wondering,
when a thing like this happens: suppose Bao-yu were to be corrupted by a little harpy
like that...?’
After some moments’ reflection, she called in her own maid from outside.
‘I want you to go over to Master Bao’s place and say that there is something I want
to ask them about. Say that I would rather Aroma and Musk stayed behind to look
after Bao-yu. There is a girl there called Skybright who is very intelligent. You can tell
her to come. Say she is to come over with you straight away. You are not to say
anything to her on the way here.’
‘Yes, my lady,’ said the maid, and hurried off to Green Delights.
When she arrived Skybright, who had recently been feeling far from well, was just
getting up from a nap and was only half awake: but as the order said ‘Come at once’,
she had to go with the maid as she was, with no time to make herself presentable.
However, this did not unduly concern her. Knowing Lady Wang’s aversion to people
of her type, she would normally have felt some nervousness about having to appear
before her. On this occasion she took comfort from the fact that her indisposition
over the last few days had caused her to neglect her appearance. Dowdiness would
count in her favour.
Alas! When she arrived in Xi-feng’s room, Lady Wang took one look at this languid
vision with its tousled hair, crooked hairpins and rumpled dress and felt all the anger
she had just conquered rising up again inside her - particularly when she recognized
this as being almost certainly the same girl as the one who had aroused her ire on
that previous occasion a month before in the Garden.
‘Good gracious me!’ she exclaimed sarcastically. ‘What swooning Xi-shi have we
here? For whose benefit do you go around in this extraordinary get-up? Don’t
imagine I don’t know what your little game is, young lady! I may not have done
anything about you yet, but I’ll have the skin off you one of these days! - Is Bao-yu
any better?’
Though shaken by the unexpectedness of this onslaught, Skybright realized at once
that someone must have been saying things about her. And although understandably
angry, she managed to keep her head. She was too intelligent not to realize that the
question about Bao-yu was a trap. She knelt to answer it.
‘I don’t often go into Bao-yu’s room, madam, or see much of him, so I am afraid I
am not able to tell you. It’s Aroma and Musk who mostly wait on him. They would be
able to give Your Ladyship an answer.’
‘Little liar!’ said Lady Wang. ‘You’ve got eyes in your head, haven’t you? What’s the
good of employing you if you can’t even tell me whether he’s well or not?’
‘I used to be Her Old Ladyship’s maid,’ said Skybright. ‘She selected me for night
duty in the outer room at Green Delights because she thought that, going to live in
the big, empty Garden he might get frightened at night. I told Her Old Ladyship that I
was too stupid to work for Bao-yu, but that only made her angry. She said, “I’m not
asking you to wait on him personally. You don’t need to be clever for the job I’m
asking you to do.” So after that I had to go. I don’t see him very often. He might call
me in once or twice every ten days or so to ask me about something and I just
answer him and go back to my work. His meals and all the personal service are
looked after either by the older servants and nannies or by Aroma and Musk and
Ripple. Whenever I’ve got time for it, I still have a lot of Her Old Ladyship’s sewing to
do. I’m afraid I don’t pay much attention to what Bao-yu is doing. I will do so in
future, if Your Ladyship wishes me to.’
Lady Wang was completely taken in.
‘Please don’t trouble yourself,’ she said hastily. ‘Holy Name! I’m only too happy to
learn that you don’t see much of him. So you were given to him by Her Old Ladyship.
I suppose in that case I shall have to see her first before I can dismiss you.’
She turned to Wang Shan-hao’s wife.
‘When you and the others go into the Garden, I want you to take particular care
that this girl is kept well away from Bao-yu. Make sure that she doesn’t sleep in the
same room. I shall be dealing with her in a few days’ time, when I have had a chance
of speaking about her to Her Old Ladyship.’
As she turned again momentarily towards Skybright, her voice rose almost into a
shout.
‘Get out of here! The sight of you standing there like a young trollop offends my
eyes! Who gave you permission anyway to dress yourself up in that garish fashion?’
Skybright left the room, utterly crushed. She buried her face in her handkerchief as
soon as she was outside the door and wept into it every step of the way back to
Green Delights.
Meanwhile Lady Wang was telling Xi-feng how much she regretted her remissness in
having allowed creatures like Skybright to inhabit the Garden for so long undisturbed.
‘I wish I had had the energy to keep a closer watch on things,’ she said. I never
expected to find a young flibber?tigibbet like that in the Garden. And I suppose if
there is one there like that, there are likely to be others like it as well.’
Xi-feng could see that Lady Wang was too incensed to reason with; and however
much she might have said to the point, she would not in any case have dared to do
so in front of Wang Shan-bao’s wife, who was one of her mother?-in-law’s principal
informants and a most notorious stirrer-up of trouble. She merely lowered her head,
therefore, and murmured assent.
It was Wang Shan-bao’s wife who spoke.
‘Don’t upset yourself, my lady. Leave all these little things to me. There’s a very easy
way of getting to the bottom of this business. Tonight, when the Garden gates have
been shut and there is no chance of word getting through inside, we’ll make a
surprise visit and search all the maids’ rooms in each of the apartments. Whoever
owned this thing we’re trying to find out about must have other things like it as well,
so if we find anything like it in our search, we shall have found the owner.
‘That sounds like a good idea,’ said Lady Wang. ‘We shall never get anywhere
unless we do something like that. - What do you think?’ she asked Xi-feng.
Xi-feng deemed it impolitic to disagree.
‘If you think it’s all right, Aunt, I should let her do it.
‘I do think it’s all right,’ said Lady Wang emphatically. ‘Unless we do it this way, we
might spend a year investigating and still get nowhere.’
A raid was accordingly planned for that very evening. After dinner, when
Grandmother Jia had retired for the night and the cousins had all returned to their
apartments, Wang Shan-bao’s wife, having first asked Xi-feng to accompany her, led
her little party into the Garden. After ordering all the side gates to be closed, she set
about searching immediately, beginning with the room just inside the Garden gate
which was used by the women of the night watch as a rendez-vous. Nothing of
interest was discovered there except for a few candle-ends and a little leftover
lamp-oil which someone had evidently put by to take home. However, Wang
Shan-bao’s wife solemnly pronounced them to be stolen property: no one was to
touch these things, she said, until Lady Wang had been informed and the appropriate
steps had been taken. They proceeded to Green Delights, barring the courtyard gates
after them as soon as they were inside.
Bao-yu was still worrying about Skybright when this party of women came bursting
into his courtyard and, without a word of explanation, walked straight into the part of
the house occupied by the maids. On going out to investigate he ran into Xi-feng and
asked her what was happening. Xi-feng went indoors to sit down with him and
accepted a cup of tea.
‘Something important is missing that no one will own up to having taken,’ she said.
‘It’s thought that one of the maids in the Garden might have stolen it, so they are
searching everyone in order to clear the innocent ones of suspicion.’
While Xi-feng was explaining this to Bao-yu, Wang Shan-bao’s wife was proceeding
with her search.
‘Whose are these trunks?’ she asked, and demanded that the owners should come
forward and open them.
Aroma had suspected that some sort of trouble lay ahead when she saw the state
that Skybright was in when she returned from her interview. The raid confirmed her
premonition. Resignedly she set the other maids an example by opening her own
trunks and boxes first. Nothing of interest was found in them. The searchers passed
on. Each girl stood by her own things and opened them up as the searchers came to
them. Finally only Skybright’s trunk remained.
‘Which girl’s is this?’ said Wang Shan-bao’s wife. ‘Why doesn’t she come forward
and open it?’
Aroma was on the point of opening it herself when Skybright, who, to judge from the
state her hair was in, had only just got out of bed, came rushing into the room, flung
the lid open with a bang, picked the trunk up by its bottom, and emptied its contents
on the floor. Wang Shan-bao’s wife blushed scarlet with embarrassment.
‘There’s no cause to be angry with me, miss,’ she said. ‘I’m not carrying this search
out to please myself, I’m here on Her Ladyship’s orders. If you don’t want your things
to be searched, you have only to say so and I shall tell Her Ladyship. There’s no need
to carry on like this about it.’
At this Skybright’s wrath blazed up in fury. She pointed at the old woman’s face.
‘You say you are here on Her Ladyship’s orders. Well I’m here on Her Old Ladyship’s
orders. Anyway, I thought I knew all the women who worked at Her Ladyship’s place
and I’m sure I never saw a self-important, meddlesome old busy?body like you there
before!’
Xi-feng, who had now rejoined them, was secretly delighted to see Wang Shan-bao’s
wife getting the rough side of Skybright’s tongue, but because the woman was her
mother-in-law’s favourite, she had to pretend that she was shocked, and shouted at
Skybright to be silent. Wang Shan-bao’s wife looked angry and flustered and seemed
on the point of re?torting; but Xi-feng restrained her.
‘All right, Mrs Wang, that will do. You don’t have to put yourself on the same level
by arguing with the girl. You get on with your searching. We’ve got all the other
places to go to yet, and if we delay too long, word will get round that we are coming
and they will be prepared for us. If that happens and you don’t succeed in finding
anything, I shan’t consider myself responsible.’
Though inwardly fuming, Wang Shan-bao’s wife was obliged to contain herself and
spent the next minute or two rummaging tight-lipped among Skybright’s possessions.
Having found nothing of importance, she then asked Xi-feng if they might go
elsewhere.
‘Now have you looked really thoroughly?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’re going to look pretty
silly if you have to report back to Lady Wang tomorrow that you couldn’t find
any?thing.’
‘We’ve been through everything,’ said one of the women. ‘There’s nothing here
that there shouldn’t be. We did find one or two boy’s things, but they were the sort
of things a quite small boy would use. Probably they belonged to Bao-yu when he
was little. Anyway, they’re of no conse?quence.’
‘In that case we can be on our way,’ said Xi-feng, pleasantly. ‘On to the next place,
then!’
Off they went without more ado. Xi-feng turned to Wang Shan-bao’s wife as they
walked along for a word in her ear.
‘I’ve got a suggestion to make, but I don’t know whether you’ll agree to it or not.
Can we confine this search to members of our own household? I don’t think we
ought to search the maids in Miss Xue’s room.’
‘Oh, I quite agree,’ said Wang Shan-bao’s wife. ‘It would never do to go searching
the rooms of our guests.’
Xi-feng nodded.
     ‘That’s what I thought’
They had by now reached the Naiad’s House. Dai-yu had already gone to bed when
the arrival of all these people was announced. Unable to guess what they could have
come for, she was on the point of getting up to ask when Xi-feng came into her room
and begged her to stay in bed.
‘Go to sleep. We shall be gone again in a moment.’
She slipped out again after a few inconsequences and rejoined the others, who had
already begun their searching. In the course of rummaging through the various
trunks and boxes in Nightingale’s room they came across some old amulets whose
period of effectiveness had long since expired and a set of two pouches and a
fan-case designed for wearing on a belt. The fan-case had a fan in it, which they took
out to examine. These were obviously masculine articles and had in fact been worn
at one time by Bao-yu. Wang Shan-bao’s wife, congratulating herself on what she
took to be a signifi?cant discovery, called Xi-feng over to witness it.
‘Look at these things, Mrs Lian! Now where would these have come from?’
Xi-feng smiled.
‘These would be old things of Bao-yu’s,’ she said. ‘He and the girls here have been
seeing each other for years - since they were little children. Their Ladyships would
probably remember having seen these things on him. You could always ask them, if
you don’t believe me.’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife was at once all smiles.
‘If you recognize them, Mrs Lian, that’s good enough for me.’
‘There’s nothing here worth bothering about,’ said Xi-?feng. ‘I think we should
leave these folk in peace and hurry on elsewhere.’
‘We’ve had so many other things where these came from and given so many in
return that I can’t keep track of them,’ said Nightingale laughing. ‘I couldn’t for the
life of me tell you when he gave us these.’
Xi-feng and Wang Shan-bao’s wife now conducted their little party to Tan-chun’s
place. This time their arrival was anticipated. Someone had brought word of their
coming, and Tan-chun, guessing that something serious must have happened to have
provoked so ugly a reaction, was standing in the open doorway, surrounded by maids
with lighted candles, waiting for the search party when it arrived.
‘Well?’ she asked, somewhat challengingly. ‘What do you want?’
Xi-feng smiled an emollient smile.
‘Something has been missing and they have been questioning everyone for several
days now without being able to find out who took it. It’s thought that whoever is
responsible for the theft might try to incriminate one of the maids. We are making
this search more for the sake of clearing them than because we really suspect any of
them of taking it.’
‘Naturally all my maids are thieves,’ said Tan-chun affably. ‘As a matter of fact, I am
their principal fence. If you want to search, you’d better look at my cupboards and
boxes first, because anything they steal is automatically handed over to me.’
She ordered the maids to open all her boxes. She also made them bring in her
dressing-cases, jewel-boxes, bedding-rolls and miscellaneous wrapped-up bundles of
clothing and open them all up for Xi-feng to inspect.
Xi-feng laughed uncomfortably.
‘I’m only carrying out your mother’s orders, coz. There’s no point in getting
offended with me.’ She turned to the servants. ‘Quickly, do these things up again for
Miss Tan.’
Scribe and Ebony, assisted by Patience and Felicity, began refastening the boxes and
tying the bundles up again.
‘I’ve said that you may search my things,’ said Tan-chun, ‘but if you want to search
my maids’, I’m afraid that won’t be possible. You see, I am a very hard mistress. I
always insist on knowing what my maids have got; consequently everything they
have - every needle and thread even - is taken care of by me; I don’t allow them to
keep anything themselves. So if you want to do any searching, you will have to search
me. If that doesn’t satisfy you, you have only to report to Lady Wang that I was
obstructive and I will gladly face whatever the consequences are tomorrow. I must
say, I cannot understand this eagerness to meet trouble half-way. The searching will
begin soon enough in this household when the day of confiscation arrives. Didn’t you
hear the news this morning about the Zhens? They tempted fate, just as we are now
doing, by carrying out a quite unnecessary search of their own servants, and now
there is a confiscation order against them and they are being searched themselves.
No doubt our time too is coming, slowly but surely. A great household like ours is not
destroyed in a day. “The beast with a thousand legs is a long time dying.” In order for
the destruction to be complete, it has to begin from within.’
She began to cry. Xi-feng darted a look at the women, which Zhou Rui’s wife
interpreted as a signal that they should go.
‘Since Miss Tan has said that the girls’ things are all here, Mrs Lian, can’t we go on
to another place now and leave her in peace?’
Xi-feng responded by rising to her feet and wishing Tan?chun good night.
‘Are you sure you’ve looked properly?’ said Tan-chun. ‘It’s no good coming back
tomorrow and asking to look again, because I shan’t let you.’
‘If all the maids’ things are in here, there is no need to look,’ said Xi-feng, smiling.
‘No need to look, when I’ve gone to the trouble of having everything opened for
you?’ said Tan-chun coldly. ‘I call that rather perverse. Tomorrow I suppose you will
say that I covered up for my maids and wouldn’t let you look. I want to be told in
plain language that you have searched as much as you want to. If you haven’t, you’d
better do so now, while you have the chance.’
Xi-feng smiled. She knew from past experience that she had to be more careful with
Tan-chun than with any of the other girls.
‘I have already searched your maids’ things and your things sufficiently.’
‘And what about the rest of you?’ Tan-chun asked the women.
‘We’ve searched enough,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife and the other women, smiling.
It was now that Wang Shan-bao’s wife showed her total lack of judgement - for she
was in truth a very stupid woman. She had heard something of Tan-chun’s reputation
in the past, but refused to believe that an unmarried girl of her years - particularly
one who was a concubine’s daughter -could be as formidable as Tan-chun was said to
be. No doubt, she told herself, it was the inexperience or pusillanimity of her
informants that made them think her so. Was not she, Wang Shan-bao’s wife, one of
Lady Xing’s oldest and most trusted servants? Did not even Lady Wang have to show
her a cer?tain measure of deference? A mere chit of a girl like Tan-chun was not
going to intimidate her. She had, in any case, the distinct impression that it was
Xi-feng and not herself that Tan-chun was angry with. At all events, she resolved to
show how little she held Tan-chun in esteem by indulging in a little horse-play at her
expense. Going up to Tan-chun, she took hold of a corner of her jacket and turned it
back, grinning all over her face.
‘There!’ she said. ‘Now I’ve even searched Miss Tan, and there’s nothing on her
either!’
Xi-feng was shocked.
‘Good gracious, woman! Are you -?’
But before she could finish there was a resounding smack! and a large red mark
appeared on the old woman’s face where Tan-chun had hit her.
Tan-chun was in a towering rage.
‘Who do you think you are? How dare you touch me? It seems that the respect that
I and the others show you, even though it is only for Her Ladyship’s sake and out of
consideration for your age, merely encourages you to make mischief for us and abuse
your borrowed powers. That, in all conscience, is hard enough to bear. But now, to
lay hands on me - that is really too much! If you have reckoned on my being a poor,
timid creature like your Miss Ying whom you can bully and impose upon at your
pleasure, you have made a very big mistake. You may search my things if you wish
and I shall not complain; but I will not be made a laughing-stock. Here!’ - with one
hand she began feverishly undoing her buttons, while with the other she pulled
Xi-feng’s hand towards her and placed it beneath her jacket ‘Search me! I would
rather be searched by you than submit to being pawed over by a slave!’
Xi-feng and Patience quickly buttoned her up again and straightened out her dress,
shouting angrily at Wang Shan?bao’s wife as they did so.
‘You have been drinking again, Nannie. Why do you do it, if it makes you behave so
badly? You’d better get out of here, before worse happens!’
Patience did her best to comfort Tan-chun.
‘Dear miss! Please don’t distress yourself. She isn’t worth your getting upset about!’
Tan-chun gave a humourless laugh.
‘I’m not upset. If I’d been upset I should have beaten my brains out before I’d have
let her touch me. I shall see Grandmother and Lady Wang about this first thing
tomorrow, and after that I shall call on Lady Xing and make whatever amends she
likes to ask for.’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife had retreated hastily from the room after her discomfiture and
was now lurking outside the window complaining bitterly of the outrage to her
dignity.
‘This is the first time anyone has ever struck me. I shall see Lady Xing tomorrow and
ask her to let me go back to my old home. If this is the way I am to be treated, I had
rather not go on living!’
‘Do you hear what that woman is saying?’ Tan-chun asked her maids. ‘Are you
waiting for me to go out there and argue with her myself?’
Scribe, needing no second prompting, hurried outside to take up the cudgels for her
mistress.
If I were in your shoes, Mrs Wang, I should have the sense to keep my mouth shut.
We should all be only too pleased if you really did go back to your own home; but I’m
afraid that when it comes to it, you won’t be able to tear yourself away. After all, if
you go, who will there be left to worm her way into Her Ladyship’s confidence and
make all our lives a misery by having searches made?’
Xi-feng was greatly amused.
‘Good for Scribe! “Like mistress, like maid”!’
‘Oh,’ said Tan-chun coldly, ‘we thieves have ready wits. We are all capable of
turning a phrase or two. It’s only when it comes to going behind other people’s backs
and stirring those in authority up against them that we are not quite so clever.’
Patience made some soothing remark to Tan-chun, simultaneously making a grab at
Scribe and pulling her back into the room, while Zhou Rui’s wife and the other
women did their best to be conciliatory. Xi-feng remained until she had seen
Tan-chun safely put to bed before leading her party off in the direction of Xi-chun’s
Spring in Winter room in the Lotus Pavilion, briefly taking in Li Wan’s place on the
way.
As Li Wan was unwell and had already taken her medicine and settled down for the
night by the time they arrived, they went into the maids’ room straight away without
disturbing her. After searching each of the maids’ boxes in turn and finding nothing,
they continued on their way to Xi-chun’s apartment.
Being younger and more immature than the other cousins, Xi-chun was much more
frightened by this visitation and at first seemed to be quite bewildered by it. It took
all of Xi?feng’s efforts to calm her. Unfortunately, while they were searching in
Picture’s trunk, they came upon a large packet containing thirty or forty silver
medallions, a carved jade belt-buckle, a pair of men’s boots and a pair of socks. Even
Xi-feng turned pale.
‘Where did these come from?’ she asked the unhappy maid.
Picture knelt down and tearfully confessed the truth.
‘They were given to my brother by Mr Zhen, madam. Since our parents went to live
in the South, our uncle and aunt have been looking after us. They both drink and
gamble a lot, and my brother was afraid that if he left anything with them they would
sell it and spend the money, so he made a secret arrangement with one of the old
nannies to bring things in to me so that I could look after them for him.’
Xi-chun, a naturally timorous child, was terrified by this discovery.
‘I knew nothing about this!’ she cried. ‘It is very wicked of her. If you want to beat
her, cousin, please do it outside. I’m not used to hearing such things. I think it would
distress me.’
Xi-feng smiled.
‘If what you say is true,’ she told Picture, ‘you can be forgiven for looking after
these things. But your brother had no business to choose such a way of getting them
in to you. If these things could be smuggled in without anyone knowing, then so
could anything else. It’s the person who brought them in who is the really guilty party.
Of course, if what you say is not true, you may as well give up hope of living!’
‘I wouldn’t dare lie to you, madam,’ said Picture, weeping. ‘You have only to ask Mr
and Mrs Zhen. If they say my brother wasn’t given these things, I shan’t complain if
you beat us both to death.’
‘I shall certainly ask,’ said Xi-feng. ‘But even if he was given them, you are still to
blame. Who said that you could have things brought in to you secretly? I shall let you
off this once if you will tell me honestly who brought them in, but you mustn’t ever
do this again.’
‘Don’t let her off!’ said Xi-chun. ‘There are so many maids. If the older ones see her
getting away with it, there’s no knowing what they will get up to. You may want to
forgive her, but I don’t.’
‘She seems to me a pretty sensible girl as a rule,’ said Xi?feng. ‘We all make
mistakes sometimes. I’m only proposing that we should let her off this once. If she
does anything like this again, we shall punish her for this offence as well. - Come on
now, what about this person who brought you the things?’ she asked Picture. ‘Tell
me who it was.’
‘Oh, I can tell you that,’ said Xi-chun. ‘It’s sure to have been that old Zhang woman
from the rear gate. She’s always around here, whispering guiltily to the maids and
doing little favours for them - in return for which, of course, they give her their
protection.’
Xi-feng told one of the women to make a note of this. The silver and the other things
she gave to Zhou Rui’s wife to take care of until Picture’s statement about their
provenance could be verified.
This old Mamma Zhang whom Xi-chun had named as the go-between who had
brought things in for Picture’s brother was a close kinswoman of Wang Shan-bao’s
wife, being in fact the mother-in-law of one of her children. However, since becoming
Lady Xing’s chief confidante, Wang Shan?bao’s wife had had little time for kinsfolk or
former colleagues, and her treatment of Mamma Zhang had caused that matron to
take umbrage. On two occasions there had been words between them, and for some
time now the two of them had not been on speaking terms. The satisfaction of
learning that the guilty bearer of these objects was a hated enemy almost
compensated Wang Shan-bao’s wife for the indignity of being slapped by Tan-chun
and taunted by Tan-chun’s maid. She endeavoured to impress Xi-feng with the gravity
of what they had discovered.
‘This smuggling is a very serious business, Mrs Lian. No doubt the things we are
looking for got into the Garden by the same way. I think you ought to look into this.’
‘I fully intend to do so,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t need you to tell me.’
They took leave of Xi-chun then and made their way to Ying-chun’s. Ying-chun was
asleep when they arrived and the maids had already gone to bed. They had to knock
a long while at the gate before anyone answered.
‘There’s no need to disturb your mistress,’ Xi-feng said to the girl who admitted
them, and made straight for the maids’ room, followed by the rest of the party.
Knowing that Wang Shan-bao’s wife was Chess’s maternal grandmother, Xi-feng
watched her very attentively to see if she would show any favouritism. Wang
Shan-bao’s wife began on the trunks of the other maids. None of them contained
anything of interest. Coming to Chess’s trunk last of all, she merely picked up one or
two things lying on the top of it before hurriedly pronouncing that there was ‘nothing
there’, and would have shut it up again if Zhou Rui’s wife had not intervened to
prevent her.
     ‘Now just a minute. Whether there is or not, you’ve got to go through it properly,
the same as you did the rest, out of fairness to the others.’
She stretched her own hand out as she said this and, diving into the trunk, fetched
out, successively, a pair of men’s padded socks, a pair of men’s satin slippers, and a
packet containing a little Loving Couple ornament and a letter. All these things she
handed over to Xi-feng.
From handling so many bills, invoices and accounts during her years as a household
manager, Xi-feng had learned to recognize quite a large number of characters and
was able to make out the whole of the crude missive, written on pink Double
Happiness notepaper, that Zhou Rui’s wife had just thrust into her hand.
     Since your visit last month my parnts have fund out about us but cant do any
thing til Miss Yings marrid if
     you can meet me in the garden send word by mrs Zhang we can talk more frely
in the garden than at home
   PLEASE TRY I have recd the two rosearys I send you this bag it shows you what I
dream of!! PLEASE
KEEP IT!!! your loving kit cousin PAN YOU?AN
     Xi-feng could hardly restrain herself from laughing out loud.
     Wang Shan-bao’s wife knew nothing of the romantic history that lay behind this
letter; but she had already had an un?comfortable feeling that all was not well when
she saw the men’s socks and shoes; and now, as she watched Xi-feng reading the
words on the pink notepaper and laughing at what she read, she became even more
apprehensive.
‘What is it, madam? An account?’ she said. ‘I suppose you are laughing because
there is some mistake in it.’
‘It certainly doesn’t balance properly,’ said Xi-feng, laughing. ‘If you are Chess’s
grandmother, shouldn’t her kit-cousin be a Wang?’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife found the question a very strange one.
‘She has a kit-cousin on her father’s side, her father’s sister’s son. Pan You-an, that
boy who ran away - he’s her kit-cousin.’
‘That makes sense,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Would you like me to read you the letter?’
     She proceeded to do so, to the great astonishment of all present. Wang
Shan-bao’s wife, who had sought out the wrongdoing of others with such
single-minded persistency, was now mortified to discover that the only wrongdoer
she had succeeded in unmasking was her own granddaughter.
‘Did you hear that, Mrs Wang?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife, who, like the other women,
had signalled her astonishment by sticking her tongue out and wagging her head
incredu?lously. ‘Couldn’t be clearer than that, could it? No talking a way out of that
one! So what do we do now?’
Wang Shan-bao’s wife heartily wished that it were possible to slip through some
crack and disappear into the ground. Xi-feng contemplated her for some moments
with enjoyment, her lips puckered up with suppressed laughter.
‘One must look on the bright side,’ she said to Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘The girl has quietly
gone off and chosen herself a husband. At least her grandmother is saved the bother
of choosing one for her!’
Zhou Rui’s wife laughed, and added some pleasantry of her own. Wang Shan-bao’s
wife was left with no one but herself on whom to vent her anger, so she slapped her
own face and reproached herself.
‘Silly old fool! You’ve lived too long, that’s your trouble! Look what you’ve brought
on yourself! Why couldn’t you have kept your mouth shut? Now you’ve got to suffer
for your own foolishness.’
The others had not the heart to laugh, but could not help feeling pleased, either
because she had made them suffer in the past and it was sweet to see her suffer now
in her turn, or from a more detached belief that they were witnessing the
working-out of divine retribution on one who had richly deserved its visitation.
Xi-feng noticed with surprise that Chess, who all this time had been standing by with
bowed head, saying nothing, had no trace of fear or shame in her expression and
wondered if she might be planning to make away with herself. As it was obviously too
late that night for questioning her, she deputed two of the women to watch over her
until morning. She herself went off with the other women, taking the things with her
as evidence.
It was her intention to deal with the matter in the morning, after a night’s sleep, but
during the course of the night she was several times obliged to get out of bed, and
each time she did so she found that she was losing blood. By the time next morning
came, she was too weak and dizzy to get up. A doctor was called. He took her pulses,
wrote a prescription, and left, saying that she would need to rest. His findings,
reported to Lady Wang by the old nannies who went to have the prescription made
up, plunged that already depressed gentlewoman into yet greater gloom. Thus
judgement on Chess’s affair was, for the time being, postponed.
*
You-shi, as it happened, called in that day to see Xi-feng and sat for a while talking
with her. After that she went on to see Li Wan and talked with her. While she was
there, a maid arrived to ask if she would mind calling in to see Xi-chun, so she went
along to Xi-chun’s. As soon as she arrived, Xi-chun launched into a long and detailed
account of what had happened the previous night. She also sent someone round to
ask Zhou Rui’s wife for the things that had been found in Picture’s trunk. You-shi
verified that they had indeed been given by Cousin Then to Picture’s brother.
‘Stupid creature!’ she said, turning to rebuke Picture, who was standing by.
‘Why do you call her names?’ said Xi-chun. ‘It was your laxness which made her the
way she is. It’s too bad. None of the other girls has been let down like this by her
maids. How shall I be able to face them after this? I told Cousin Feng last night to
take her away, but she wouldn’t. I am glad that you have come, because now you will
be able to. I don’t care what you do with her - beat her, kill her, sell her - I just want
to be rid of her.’
Picture knelt down and implored her mistress most piteously not to send her away.
You-shi and Xi-chun’s nurses also did their best to talk Xi-chun out of dismissing her.
‘It was only a single lapse on her part,’ said You-shi. ‘I’m sure she won’t do it again.
Think of all the years of service she has given you.’
But Xi-chun, in whom the natural waywardness of youth was reinforced by a perverse
contrariness that was all her own, remained adamant in the face of both argument
and entreaty and insisted that Picture must go.
‘And it isn’t only Picture that I don’t want to see any more,’ she told You-shi. ‘The
same goes for all the rest of you. From now on I propose to stop going round to your
place altogether. There has been a lot of talk about you people of late. If I continue to
go round, I am afraid I might get involved in it.
‘Who has been talking about us?’ said You-shi. ‘And what, pray, have they found to
talk about? I think you might begin by considering who you are - and who we are. If
you have heard people talking about us, I should have thought it was up to you to ask
them what they meant by it.’
‘That’s rather strange advice coming from you,’ said Xi-chun sneeringly. ‘A girl like
me is supposed to keep well away from scandal, not go running headlong towards it.
You know the saying: “A father should help a son and the son his father, but not in
slaying or in doing evil.” The same principle holds good for you and me. I can only
answer for my own integrity. If you people end up by getting yourselves into a mess, I
don’t want to have anything to do with it.
You-shi was half angered and half amused by her young sister-in-law’s rudeness.
‘I can see now why people speak of Miss Xi as young for her age,’ she said,
addressing the grown-up servants below the kang. “‘Young and foolish” I have heard
her called. I used not to believe it of her, but finding her now so unreason?able and
so lacking in any sense of proportion, I really do begin to despair of her.’
‘She is still very young,’ said the women placatingly. ‘You must expect a few knocks
in your dealings with her, Mrs Zhen.’
‘I may be “young”,’ said Xi-chun scornfully, ‘but there is nothing “young” about
what I have just been saying. And since none of you people can even read or write,
how can you have the nerve to call me “foolish”?’
‘You are the great scholar, of course,’ said You-shi sarcastic?ally, ‘the Top of the List
candidate! Stupid people like us cannot hope to compete with you in understanding.’
‘There’s certainly not much understanding in what you have just said,’ Xi-chun
retorted. ‘Your assumption that a Top of the List candidate cannot be stupid is a
vulgar fallacy typical of the great mass of blind, undiscriminating world?lings. A true
sage can be identified by the very first step he takes, not by examination results.’
‘Goodness!’ said You-shi mockingly. ‘A moment ago we had the great scholar; now,
it seems, the great preacher has come to enlighten us!’
‘I lay no claim to enlightenment,’ said Xi-chun, ‘though I can see that most people
are no better than Picture - and that they are as little worth bothering about.’
‘You are a cold-hearted little monster,’ said You-shi.
‘If I seem cold, it is because I wish to keep myself uncorrupted,’ said Xi-chun. ‘Why
should I want to get involved with you and allow myself to be dragged down to your
level?’
You-shi was highly sensitive to remarks about her family’s reputation and had already
been embarrassed and upset by Xi-chun’s reference to ‘people talking’. Because
Xi-chun was only a girl, she had done her best not to lose her temper; but this last
remark was too much to stomach. Unable to contain herself any longer, she burst out
angrily.
‘What do you mean, “dragged down to my level”? You turn your maid’s offence into
an occasion for making a completely unwarranted attack upon me, and when I bear
your ridiculous attacks with patience, it seems merely to encourage you to indulge in
further insults. Very well, Miss Holy Purity! I shall be careful to keep away from you in
future, in case your priceless reputation is sullied by my presence.’
She swept out angrily, indicating to her maids as she went that they should bring
Picture with them.
‘It will be much better for all concerned if you don’t ever come here again,’ Xi-chun
called out after her. ‘It will save a lot of argument.’
You-shi heard this and grew even angrier; but reflecting that Xi-chun was, however
vexing, a young unmarried daughter of the family and therefore not a person with
whom she could engage in open wrangling, she swallowed her anger and hur?ried off
without answering, out of the Garden and into the inner part of the mansion.
What she heard there will be related in the chapter which follows.
CHAPTER 75

Midnight revellers are startled
by a sound of evil omen
And Mid-Autumn moon-watchers listen
to quatrains of unequal merit



When You-shi swept angrily out of Xi-chun’s apartment, it had been her intention to
visit Lady Wang, but one of the old women in her suite whispered in her ear to advise
her against going there.
‘Some people from the Zhen family have just arrived there, madam, with a lot of
things. I think it’s something secret they’ve come about. It probably wouldn’t be very
convenient for you to go there now.’
‘That’s funny,’ said You-shi. ‘I heard your master saying last night that he had read in
the Gazette that the Zhens had been attainted. It said that there was a search and
confiscation order on their estate and that the family were being brought under
arrest to the capital for questioning. What can any of them be doing here?’
‘You may well ask, madam. It was some of the women?folk we saw there. They
were in a terrible state, very worried and frightened. I expect they are doing
something they ought not to be.’
You-shi abandoned her idea of visiting Lady Wang and went back to see Li Wan, with
whom she had been talking a little earlier when Xi-chun called her away. Li Wan had
been visited in the meantime by her doctor; and as she was feeling much livelier than
she had done for some days, she had remained sitting up after her visit. You-shi
found her propped up on pillows and with the bedclothes pulled up round her, eager
for conversation. Unfortunately You-shi, who had been so affable on her earlier visit,
was now in no mood to talk and sat at Li Wan’s bedside silent and pre?occupied. Li
Wan wondered if she was feeling hungry.
‘Have something to eat,’ she said. ‘What would you like?’ She turned to Candida.
‘What nice little snack have we got that we could offer Mrs Zhen?’
‘Please don’t bother,’ said You-shi. ‘You’re hardly likely to have interesting snacks in
the house after being an invalid for so many days. And in any case I’m not hungry.’
‘Someone sent me some rather good wheatmeal tea yesterday,’ said Li Wan. ‘Why
don’t you try a bowl of that?’
She told Candida to mix some for her with sugar and boiling water. You-shi made no
reply and continued to brood. The women and maids who had come with her tried to
think of some means of distracting her.
‘You haven’t done your face yet since this morning, madam,’ said one of them.
‘Why not take this opportunity of having a wash?’
You-shi nodded. Li Wan at once sent Candida for her dressing-case and mirror.
Candida offered You-shi the use of her own make-up.
‘Our mistress doesn’t use make-up, Mrs Zhen. If you don’t mind using my stuff,
you’re very welcome to some of this.’
‘It’s true that I haven’t got any,’ said Li Wan, ‘but you ought to have borrowed some
from one of the young ladies to lend her. Fancy offering her your own, and in front of
everyone else! It’s a good job it was Mrs Zhen. Some people would have been most
offended.’
‘Oh, that’s all right,’ said You-shi, and began to wash. The maid with the basin bent
down to hold it out to her.
‘Where are your manners, girl?’ said Li Wan reprovingly, whereupon the maid at
once went down on her knees.
‘Manners!’ said You-shi. ‘The outward frills of respectability! Those are the things
our servants are so good at. What they actually get up to doesn’t bear much
investigating.’
Li Wan realized that she must be referring to the events of the previous night.
‘Why do you say that?’ she asked smilingly. ‘What has who got up to that doesn’t
bear investigating?’
‘Need you ask?’ said You-shi. ‘You’ve not been so ill that you’ve lost the use of your
faculties!’
Before Li Wan could reply, Bao-chai’s arrival was announced. Li Wan and You-shi both
called out to her to come in. You-shi, hurriedly wiping the water from her face, got up
to welcome her and made her sit down with her at the side of the bed.
‘On your own?’ she asked her. ‘Where are all the others?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I haven t seen them yet. Mother isn’t very well today,
and as her two senior maids are also both ill in bed and I don’t trust any of the others,
I thought I had better go and stay with her for a few days. At first I was going to tell
Lady Jia and Aunt Wang, but then I thought that as this is rather a small matter and I
shall in any case be coming back again as soon as Mother is better I wouldn’t bother
them but simply have a word about it with Cousin Wan.’
Li Wan and You-shi exchanged smiles and glances. Presently, when You-shi had
finished her toilet, the three of them each had a bowl of wheatmeal tea.
‘I must send someone to see how your mother is and find out what she is suffering
from,’ said Li Wan. ‘I can’t go in person, unfortunately, because I am ill myself. Don’t
worry about anything here. I’ll send someone to look after your apartment while you
are away. Do come back soon, though, or I shall be blamed for your going.’
‘Whyever should you be?’ said Bao-chai. ‘There’s noth?ing unusual about my going.
You are not being asked to connive at a gaol-break. And incidentally, I don’t see why
it should be necessary to send anyone to my apartment. Why not simply invite
Cousin Shi to stay with you for a few days? Wouldn’t that be simpler?’
‘While we are on the subject, where is Cousin Shi?’ said You-shi.
‘I sent her off just now to look for Cousin Tan,’ said Bao-?chai. ‘She was to bring
Cousin Tan here so that I could explain to her about going to Mother’s too.’
By coincidence ‘Miss Shi and Miss Tan’ were at that very moment announced. As
soon as they were seated, Bao-chai told Tan-chun about her intention of moving
outside for a few days to look after her mother.
‘Very wise,’ said Tan-chun. ‘But why only stay outside until Aunt is better? Why not
move outside altogether?’
‘That’s rather a strange way to talk,’ said You-shi, laughing. ‘It’s as though you
wanted to drive our kinswoman out.’
‘Well, why not?’ said Tan-chun bitterly. ‘Better be driven out now by me than by
someone else later on. Kinsfolk are lucky. They don’t have to stay here. Not like the
members of this happy family - all glaring at each other like angry fighting-cocks,
wondering which will be the first one to strike!’
You-shi laughed.
‘I think today must be my unlucky day. I seem to have caught all you young ladies in
a thoroughly unpleasant mood.’
‘If you don’t like the heat, you should stay away from the fire,’ said Tan-chun.
‘Who’s been upsetting you then?’ She thought for a bit. ‘It’s not likely to have been
Cousin Feng. Not this time. So who was it?’
You-shi’s vague answer evaded the question. Tan-chun knew that she was afraid to
speak openly for fear of causing trouble.
‘Come on!’ she said tauntingly. ‘Don’t act the innocent! It’s not high treason to tell
us. No one’s going to chop your head off. Look at me. Last night I slapped Wang
Shan-bao’s wife’s face. That’s an offence deserving hard labour at the very least, yet
nothing’s happened so far, bar a bit of muttering. I don’t think anyone is going to give
me a beating.’
‘Did you really slap her face?’ Bao-chai asked incredulously.
Tan-chun treated them all to a lively account of what had happened, after which
You-shi, seeing that there was no longer any point in concealment, proceeded to tell
them about her recent encounter with Xi-chun.
‘Oh, she’s always like that,’ said Tan-chun. ‘It’s her nature. Xi-chun is so peculiar,
nothing the rest of us say or do is ever going to alter her. By the way’ - she returned
to the subject that was uppermost in her mind - ‘I made some in?quiries first thing
this morning to find out why nothing was happening. Apparently it’s because Cousin
Feng is ill again. I also sent someone to inquire about Wang Shan-bao’s wife. It seems
that she has been given a beating. For interfering.’
‘Quite right, too!’ said You-shi and Li Wan. But Tan?-chun took a more cynical view.
‘It would be a comparatively easy way of disarming suspicion. We must wait and
see.’
You-shi and Li Wan looked thoughtful, but neither made any comment.
Shortly after this the maids came in to say that dinner was ready. Xiang-yun and
Bao-chai went back to their apart?ment to pack, in preparation for their respective
moves. Our narrative leaves them at this point.
You-shi and Tan-chun, after taking their leave of Li Wan, made their way to
Grandmother Jia’s apartment. The old lady was reclining on her couch listening,
while Lady Wang told her about the Zhens: the offences they had been charged with,
the confiscation of their property and their coming up to the capital now for
questioning. Grand?mother Jia was obviously much shaken by what she heard, but
brightened up somewhat when You-shi and Tan-chun arrived.
‘Where have you both come from?’ she asked them. ‘I suppose you know that Feng
and Wan are both ill now? I wonder how they are today.’
‘They are both a little better,’ said You-shi.
Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed.
‘I think we’ve heard enough about other people’s troubles for the time being. It’s
time we started thinking about the arrangements for our Mid-Autumn party.’
‘The catering arrangements have all been made,’ said Lady Wang. ‘It only remains
for you to decide where you want it. I suppose the nights are getting too chilly now
for us to have it out in the Garden.’
‘We can always put on a bit more clothing,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Of course we
must have it in the Garden. That’s what the Garden is for.’
While they were speaking, some of the women came in carrying the dinner-table
between them. Lady Wang and You-shi laid chopsticks and carried in the rice. When
all was ready, Grandmother noticed that in addition to her own dishes there were
two large food-boxes containing dishes from the other apartments. It was a
long-established custom that the occupants of other apartments should send her
samples of what they were planning to eat that day themselves as a way of showing
her their respect.
‘I’ve told you all a number of times to stop doing this,’ she said. ‘Why won’t you
ever do as I say?’
‘These are only very ordinary things here,’ said Lady Wang, referring to her own
contribution. ‘It’s one of my fast-days today, so I have only vegetarian dishes. I know
you don’t much like bean-curd fried in batter, which is one of the things I am having.
The only thing of mine I think you might like is a salad pickle of chopped
water-mallow in pepper sauce.’
‘That sounds rather nice,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I think I’d like to try some of that.’
Faithful quickly took the saucer containing it out of the box and put it down in front
of her. Bao-qin, having first apologized to each of her seniors for sitting down in their
presence, took her place at one side of the table. Grandmother Jia said that Tan-chun
should eat with her as well, where?upon Tan-chun too made her apologies and sat
down. She sat at the other side of the table opposite Bao-qin. Scribe quickly fetched
her a bowl and chopsticks. Meanwhile Faithful was pointing out the other dishes to
Grandmother Jia.
‘I can’t make out what these two here are. They are from Sir She. The stuff in this
bowl is creamed chicken and bamboo. It’s from Mr Zhen.’
She brought the bowl of sliced bamboo-shoot over and put it down on the table.
Grandmother Jia made a couple of dips into it with her chopsticks. She ordered all
the other dishes to be taken back to their senders.
‘Tell them thank you very much I’ve tried some, but not to send things to me any
more. If I ever want anything, I shall let them know.’
The women made some reply and went off with the boxes.
‘Now bring me my rice-gruel and I’ll have a bit of that,’ said Grandmother Jia.
You-shi stepped forward with a bowl of gruel. It was made with red ‘Emperor’ rice,
she told her. After drinking about half of it, Grandmother Jia ordered the other half to
be taken to Xi-feng. She pointed to one of the dishes.
‘And this is for Patience.’ She turned to You-shi. ‘I’ve finished. Now you can eat.’
‘Thank you,’ said You-shi, but waited all the same until the old lady had rinsed her
mouth and washed her hands and was walking up and down on Lady Wang’s arm for
her digestion before she ‘begged to be seated’. By this time Bao?qin and Tan-chun
had finished eating. They got up as You?-shi sat down, excusing themselves from
keeping her company while she ate.
‘Oh,’ said You-shi, ‘I’m not used to eating at a big table like this all on my own.’
‘Faithful and Amber can eat with you for company,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘Good!’ said You-shi. ‘I was about to suggest that.’
‘I like to see people eating together,’ said Grandmother Jia. She pointed to Butterfly.
‘Now here’s a good girl. Why shouldn’t she eat with you as well? Go on, child! Go and
eat with your mistress. As long as you are here with me, it doesn’t matter if you
break the rules for once.’
‘Come on!’ said You-shi to the maid encouragingly. ‘Don’t pretend to be bashful!’
Grandmother Jia stopped walking up and down and stood with her hands clasped
behind her back to watch them eat. It suddenly struck her that the rice being served
was the plain white rice normally eaten by the servants and that You-shi, too, was
eating it.


‘Why are you giving Mrs Zhen this stuff?’ she asked them.
‘There isn’t any of Your Old Ladyship’s rice left,’ said the maids. ‘You had an extra
young lady eating with you today, don’t forget.’
‘Meals are made to measure nowadays,’ said Faithful. ‘We can’t afford to be
extravagant the way we used to be.’
‘There have been so many floods and droughts during the past few years,’ said Lady
Wang. ‘Our farms haven’t been able to make up their quotas. These special kinds of
rice are particularly hard to come by. We have had to start rationing them rather
carefully.’
‘Even the cleverest housewife can’t make rice-gruel without rice.’ Grandmother Jia
quoted the proverb amidst general laughter.
Faithful turned to address the women waiting outside the door.
‘If Her Old Ladyship’s rice is all finished, you can get the rice that Miss Tan would
have eaten if she hadn’t been eating with us and bring it here for Mrs Zhen.’
‘No need,’ said You-shi. ‘What I’ve got here is quite enough for me.’
‘I dare say it is,’ said Faithful, ‘but what about me?’
The women hurried off to fetch the rice.
Presently Lady Wang went off to have dinner in her own apartment, leaving You-shi
to entertain Grandmother Jia. The time passed quickly, with much good-humoured
teasing and laughter, and the first watch had already begun before Grandmother Jia
noticed how late it was getting.
‘You’d better be getting back now,’ she told You-shi.
You-shi took her leave. Outside the inner gate she got into her waiting carriage. Her
women pulled the blind down, then, taking all the maids with them except Butterfly,
who was riding in the carriage with her mistress, hurried on ahead so that they could
be waiting for You-shi when she arrived in the other mansion. The men from both
gates walked some way along the street to keep it clear of pedestrians while six or
seven pages pushed and pulled the carriage (it seemed too short a distance and too
late an hour for mules) as far as the interior of the Ning-guo gateway. There the
pages retired, old women came forward and raised the blind, and Butterfly
dismounted and helped out her mistress. You-shi noticed that there were four or five
large carriages waiting below the stone lions which flanked the gate and commented
to Butterfly on their presence.
‘I wonder how many horses there are in the stables? If this number came by
carriage, you may be sure that a much greater number will have come on horseback.’
As she and Butterfly entered the outer courtyard, Jia Rong’s wife at the head of a
party of maids and older women carrying lanterns advanced to meet them.
‘I’ve been dying for I don’t know how long to have a look at the men while they are
gambling,’ said You-shi, ‘but so far I haven’t had an opportunity. Tonight is the best
chance I shall ever get. Let’s go along the wall in front of the windows so that we can
peep in at them.’
The women with lanterns made a detour towards the building in which the men
were congregated. One of them went ahead and warned the pages waiting outside
not to announce their arrival to the men or make any other noise that would warn
those inside of their coming. You-shi and her party were thus able to steal right up to
the windows and could hear everything that was going on inside. Among the medley
of sounds that met their ears, numbers seemed to predominate, some uttered
exultantly and with raucous shouts of laughter, others angrily or despairingly and to
the accompaniment of curses and profanities.
Cousin Zhen had found the ban on amusements during the seemingly interminable
period of mourning for Jia Jing which convention imposed on him extremely irksome.
Archery, for some reason, was permitted, and a few months previously he had hit on
archery as a means of getting round the ban. A number of young men from the
wealthy and aristocratic households of his acquaintance were invited round to the
Ning-guo mansion to participate. Shooting was to be competitive.
‘Random shooting is quite useless,’ he explained to them. ‘You not only don’t make
any progress; it actually spoils your form. You’ve got to have incentives of some kind
to keep you on your toes, and the best way of doing that is to bet on something.’
Butts were set up in the shooting gallery below the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion and
every day after lunch the young men came along to compete. Since, as Bereaved Son,
it would have been unseemly for Cousin Zhen himself to have been named in this
connection, the nominal convenor and organ?izer of these gatherings was Jia Rong.
All those invited were rich, profligate, dashing young fellows, accustomed to
spend?ing their time in cock-fighting, dog-racing and even more questionable
amusements. After some discussion it was decided that the responsibility for
providing dinner after the day’s archery should fall to each one of them in turn. It
became a point of honour to make these dinners as lavish as possible, so that the
daily junketings at Ning-guo House came more and more to resemble the Diet of
Lintong in the well-known play of that name, except that whereas Duke Mu’s princely
guests competed in the bravery of their com?manders and the magnificence of their
regalia, it was in the skill of their chefs and in masterpieces of culinary art that the
members of the Ning-guo archery club strove to outdo each other.
When this had been going on for a couple of weeks or so, Jia Zheng and Jia She got to
hear about it. The report that reached them cannot have been a very accurate one,
however, for, far from being critical of these goings-on, they spoke of them with
approval.
‘Since Rong obviously has no aptitude for book-learning,’ Jia Zheng observed,
‘Cousin Zhen does right to encourage him in the martial arts. The boy does, after all,
hold a military commission.
They even made Bao-yu, Jia Huan, Jia Cong and Jia Lan participate. The four of them
had to go over every day after lunch and not return until each of them had taken his
turn at the butts.
But it was not of course in the archery that Cousin Zhen was interested. On the
grounds that resting the muscles was an important part of one’s training, he was
soon advocating a little cards or dice in the evenings as a means of relaxation. At first
they played only for drinks, but soon they were play?ing more and more for money;
the time spent on gaming gradually encroached on the time devoted to archery;
betting became more open; and finally, with the formal opening of a ‘bank’ some
three or four months previously, regular, organized gambling for heavy stakes had
become a daily routine. The Ning-guo servants, who grew fat on the pickings, were
delighted with these new arrangements and, anxious that they should go on, if
possible, for ever, took very good care that no one outside the mansion should get to
hear about them.
Lady Xing’s brother, Xing De-quan, himself a keen gambler, had lately become a
frequenter of this establish?ment; so, inevitably, had Xue Pan, who was never so
happy as when he was throwing away his money.
Xing De-quan was very unlike his sister. Drinking, gambling and debauchery were his
only interests; consequently whenever any money came into his hands, he spent it
like water. The singular obtuseness he showed in all his dealings had earned him the
nickname of ‘Uncle Dumbo’. And since Xue Pan was already known to all and sundry
as ‘the Oaf King’, the two of them when they were together were referred to by the
young men as ‘Uncle Dumbo and Cousin Oaf’.
The situation when You-shi peeped inside was as follows. Cousin Oaf and Uncle
Dumbo, each with a partner, were playing six-dice Grabs on the kang in the outer
room. Simultaneously another dicing game, Driving the Sheep, was being played by
several players sitting round a large table on the floor below. The inner room, where
a slightly more intellectual group were playing Tin Kau, was devoted to dominoes.
The servants were all pages of fifteen or under. There was also a pair of male
prostitutes, powdered, over-dressed youths of seventeen or eighteen, whose duty
was to ply the guests with drink. It was this pair who first caught You-shi’s eye when
she looked in.
Xue Pan had been having the sulks earlier on because he was losing, but then his luck
had changed: he had not only recouped his losses but made a lot of extra money. He
was therefore in a very good mood indeed. Cousin Zhen sug?gested that this might
be a good point at which to stop and have dinner. They could go on playing
afterwards if they wanted to.
‘What about the two other lots?’ he inquired.
It transpired that the Tin Kau players in the next room were in process of settling up
after finishing the game and were in fact beginning to think about their dinner, but
that the group at the big table playing Driving the Sheep had not yet reached a
suitable point at which to break off. Cousin Zhen ordered dinner to be served for all
those, himself included, who were ready. Jia Rong was to wait and have dinner with
the other players when they had finished.
Xue Pan, elated by his success, sat with a cup of wine in one hand and his arm round
the shoulders of one of the pretty pot-boys. With a victor’s expansive generosity he
ordered the other boy to pour some wine ‘with his compliments’ for Uncle Dumbo.
But Uncle Dumbo was thoroughly out of temper at having lost the game, and the two
cupfuls he drank now in rapid succession served merely to make him tipsily
aggressive. He vented his anger on the two young ganymedes, who, he claimed, had
treacherously withdrawn their favours from him and transferred them to the winner.
‘Heartless brood of unnatural little whore’s gits!’ he grumbled. ‘You’ve had plenty
of favours off me in the past - and off everyone else here. Now, just because I’ve lost
a few taels, I’m not good enough for you. What makes you so certain you won’t ever
need my help again in the future?’
The other guests all knew that he was drunk. Those of them who were losers
themselves smiled wryly and said nothing, but one or two of the winners
magnanimously expressed their sympathy.
‘That’s right, Uncle. Rotten little bastards! That’s just the way they do behave.’
‘Why don’t you pour Uncle a drink and tell him you’re sorry?’ said another of them.
The two young ganymedes, practised professionals in every trick of the trade, were
on their knees at Uncle Dumbo’s side in a moment, offering him wine, fondling his
thigh, and gazing with simpering archness into his eyes.
‘Don’t be angry with us, dear old friend. We are only children. We have to do as we
are told. Our teacher always tells us, “It doesn’t matter what they are like or what
your own feelings are, the person who at any moment has the most money is the
one you must be nice to.” Just win a lot of money later on this evening, old friend,
and you’ll see how nice we shall be to you!’
The disarming frankness of this made everyone laugh. Even Uncle Dumbo, though he
tried hard not to, was forced to join in.
‘All right, I forgive you,’ he growled as he took the proffered winecup. ‘Though I
don’t mind telling you, if I hadn’t been so fond of you two, I’d have kicked the stuffing
out of your little tum-tums!’
He shot his foot up as he said this, by way of demonstration. The two boys scrambled
to their feet in mock alarm. Each of them carried a long woman’s handkerchief of
flowered silk. With mincing gestures, still holding their handkerchiefs in their hands,
they guided the winecup towards his lips. Uncle Dumbo’s loud gurgles of delight
were briefly interrupted while he threw his head back and drained the cup. Then, still
laughing, he pinched their cheeks.
‘Little dears!’ he said. ‘How I loves them!’
His mood changed abruptly as he remembered a grievance. He smote the table
angrily and glared at Cousin Zhen.
‘I had a quarrel with your Uncle She’s wife yesterday, did you know that?’
‘With Aunt Xing?’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘No, I hadn’t heard that.’
Uncle Dumbo sighed self-pityingly.
‘About damned money, as usual. You don’t know the history of our Xing family,
dear boy. When my old mother died, I was still too young to know what was going on.
I have three elder sisters. The eldest is your precious aunt. When your aunt married,
she took everything we had with her. Everything. My second sister had to marry
without a dowry. She and her husband are paupers. My third sister is still unmarried.
She lives on a pittance paid out to her by that old whore, Wang Shan-bao’s wife, who
has charge of all our money. Well, I went along yesterday to ask her for a few coppers.
Not Jia money, mind you: our Xing money is good enough for me. But would she give
me any? Not she! And that’s the reason why I get treated by you lot like a poor
relation.’
Cousin Zhen knew that he was drunk, but as it was embarrassing that these
unsavoury details of family history should be paraded in front of outsiders, he did his
best to mollify Uncle Dumbo and get him onto another tack.
All this was clearly audible to You-shi outside.
‘Did you hear that?’ she whispered to Butterfly, who was standing beside her.
‘That’s Lady Xing they’re talking about. If her own brother talks about her in that way,
you can hardly wonder that other people complain about her.’
She would have said more, but checked herself in order to attend to what was going
on inside. The group playing Driving the Sheep had now broken off and were calling
for wine.
‘Who was upsetting Uncle Dumbo just now?’ asked one of them. ‘We couldn’t
quite catch what it was about. Tell us what happened, Uncle, and we’ll see you get
fair play.’
Uncle Dumbo proceeded to tell them how the two boys had forsaken him because he
had no money.
‘Good grief!’ said the young man who had asked the question. ‘I don’t blame you
for being angry - What do you mean by it?’ he asked the boys. ‘He’s only lost a bit of
money, hasn’t he? He hasn’t lost his prick!’
The company roared with laughter. Uncle Dumbo’s mouthful of rice was spattered
over half the floor.
‘You dirty bugger!’ he said. ‘Can’t you open your mouth without being crude?’
You-shi gave a little snort of disgust.
‘Just listen to those animals! By the time they’ve swilled a few more cups of wine,
heaven knows what filth they’ll be coming out with!’
She moved on her way - having seen and heard quite as much as she wanted to -
returned to her apartment, un?dressed, and went to bed. Cousin Zhen did not get to
bed until after two. He spent what remained of the night in Lovey’s room.
As soon as he was up next morning, someone came in with a message to say that the
melons and mooncakes he had ordered were now ready and it only remained for him
to say who they were to be sent to.
‘Ask your mistress to see to it,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I have got other business to
attend to.’
Lovey took this message to You-shi, who proceeded to go through the list deciding
how much should go to whom and making arrangements for the delivery. She had
barely finished doing this when Lovey came back again with another message.
‘The master wants to know if you are going out today, madam. He says we can’t
keep Mid-Autumn properly on the fifteenth because we are in mourning still, but
there would be no harm in having a little family party tonight.’
‘I don’t want to go out,’ said You-shi, ‘but with Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian both ill in bed,
I don’t see how I can refuse to go next door and lend a hand.’
‘The master says, if you have to go out, will you at any rate try to get back as early
as you can?’ said Lovey.
‘Better hurry up with the lunch then,’ said You-shi. ‘The sooner I can get away, the
sooner I’ll be back.’
‘The master’s having lunch in the front today, madam. He says please have your
lunch here without him.’
‘Who’s he got there?’ said You-shi.
‘Somebody told me it’s two people just arrived from Nan-king,’ said Lovey, ‘but I
don’t know who they are.’
Jia Rong’s wife came in while Lovey was talking. Shortly after that lunch was served.
After lunch, You-shi changed into her going-out clothes and went over to Rong-guo
House. She did not return until evening.
While she was away, Cousin Zhen went ahead with arrange?ments for an intimate
family party. He had a whole pig boiled, a whole sheep roasted, and an infinite
number of vegetable dishes and entremets prepared. When You-shi got back that
evening, he conducted her and the little con?cubines and Jia Rong and Jia Rong’s wife
to the Bosky Verdure Pavilion where it was all laid out. This was in the All-Scents
Garden, as they continued to call the little rem?nant still left them after the main
part was incorporated in Prospect Garden.
They had dinner first. The wine was brought in after they had finished eating, so that
they could apply themselves single-mindedly to games and mirth and the enjoyment
of the Mid-Autumn moon, which now (for by this time it was already the beginning
of the first watch) shone brightly in a clear, fresh sky, filling the world above and
below with its silver light. Cousin Zhen invited the four little concubines to sit at the
same table as him and You-shi and join with them in games of Plumstones and
Guess-fingers. Presently – for the drink was beginning to make him sentimental - he
called to them for some music, and Flower sang for them in a clear, sweet voice,
accompanied by Lovey on the vertical bamboo flute. Everyone was deeply moved by
the perform?ance. After it was over the games continued.
The hours slipped by. Soon it was nearly midnight. Cousin Zhen was by now more
than a little drunk. They had all just put on some extra clothes and had some hot tea;
the wine-cups had been cleared and clean ones put in their place and a fresh lot of
newly heated wine was just being poured, when suddenly a long-drawn-out sigh was
heard from the foot of one of the garden walls. It was heard by all of them, quite
clearly and unmistakably, and they could feel the hair on their scalps rise as they
listened to it.
‘Who’s there?’ Cousin Zhen shouted in a voice that he tried to make fierce and
challenging. But though he repeated the question several times, there was no reply.
‘It’s probably one of the servants,’ said You-shi.
‘Nonsense!’ snapped Cousin Zhen. ‘There are no servants living behind any of these
walls. In any case, that’s the Hall of the Ancestors over there. What would anyone be
doing behind that wall?’
A rustle of wind passed, at that very moment, along the foot of it and a distant sound
like the opening and closing of a door could be heard from inside the ancestral
temple. An oppressive feeling of dread came over them; the night air seemed
suddenly to have grown colder; the moon appeared less bright than it had been a
few minutes before; and they could feel their skins crawling with terror.
Shock had made Cousin Zhen almost sober; but though he managed to keep better
control of himself than the others, he was very much shaken and had lost all appetite
for enjoy?ment. Nevertheless he forced himself and the others to sit a little longer
before retiring finally to bed.
He rose quite early next morning. It was the fifteenth, one of the two days in each
month on which offerings have to be made to the ancestors. Entering the ancestral
temple with the other male members of the family, he took the opportunity of
looking round inside it very carefully; but everything was as it should be; there was
no sign whatever of anything untoward having happened. He put down the previous
night’s terror to the effects of drunkenness - a mild attack of the horrors - and
resolved to make no further mention of it. When the service was over, he shut the
temple up again and made sure that the doors were securely locked and barred.
*
After dinner that evening Cousin Zhen went over with You?-shi to Rong-guo House.
He found Jia She and Jia Zheng in Grandmother Jia’s room. The two of them were
sitting on the kang, talking and laughing with the old lady, while Jia Lian, Bao-yu, Jian
Huan and Jia Lan stood on the floor below. After greeting them and exchanging a
word or two with each of them in turn, he sat, or rather half-sat, in polite discomfort,
on a stool next to the door. Grandmother Jia vouchsafed a gracious smile in his
direction.
     ‘How is your Cousin Bao’s archery these days?’
Cousin Zhen jumped to his feet to reply.
‘Greatly improved, Lady Jia. It isn’t only his form that is better; he is beginning to
handle the bow with much greater strength.’
‘That’s the point at which to stop then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We don’t want him
straining himself.’
‘No, no, certainly not,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘I quite agree.’
‘Those mooncakes you sent yesterday were very good,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The
melons looked all right, but there’s not much inside them when you cut them open.’
‘Those mooncakes are good, aren’t they?’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘They were made by
our new pastry-cook. I tried them myself to make sure they were all right before
venturing to send you any. As for the melons: we’ve been lucky in previous years, but
for some reason none of them this year seem to be any good.’
‘I think we must blame the weather,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘The rains this year were
excessive.
‘The moon must be up by now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s go and make our
Mid-Autumn offering.’
She got up and, leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, led the way into the Garden. The main
gate was wide open and hung with great horn lanterns. When they reached Prospect
Hall, they found servants with lighted lamps waiting for them on the terrace and a
table on which incense smoked in a square container and on which offerings of
melons and other fruit and mooncakes had been set out on dishes. Lady Xing and all
the other female members of the family were waiting inside the hall.
  Moonlight and lanterns gleaming pale
Through a thin aromatic veil –
It was indeed a scene of indescribable beauty. A carpet for kneeling on had been laid
on the terrace at the foot of the table on the side nearest the hall. Grandmother Jia
washed her hands, lit some sticks of incense, knelt down on the carpet, bowed down,
and offered up the incense. The others followed her example.
‘The best place for enjoying the moon from is the top of a hill,’ she told them when
they had finished. She suggested the pavilion on the summit of the ‘master
mountain’ behind Reunion Palace (of which Prospect Hall was a part) as the place to
have their party. The servants at once went off to make it ready. Meanwhile
Grandmother Jia sat talking with the others inside Prospect Hall, resting and drinking
tea. Presently the servants came back to report that the mountain-top pavilion was
now ready. The old lady stood up again and, supported on either side by her maids,
prepared to make the ascent.
‘I’m afraid the moss on the steps might make them rather slippery,’ said Lady Wang.
‘Wouldn’t it be better if you went up in a chair?’
‘The servants sweep them every day,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How can there be any
moss? They are good, level steps and not too steep. The exercise will be good for
me.’
Jia She and Jia Zheng led the way, followed by a couple of old women with horn
lanterns. Faithful, Amber and You-shi supported the old lady on either side, and Lady
Xing, Lady Wang and all the others followed in a close procession behind. It was only
a hundred or so steps up the zig-zag path to the summit.
The pavilion was a rectangular building with one completely open side looking onto a
terrace. Because it was situated on the convex grassy summit of the little ‘mountain’,
it was called Convex Pavilion. Two tables with chairs round them had been set out on
the terrace, separated from each other by a large screen. The tables and chairs, like
the moon and melons and mooncakes, were all round, in honour of the occasion.
Grandmother Jia sat at the head of one of the tables with Jia She, Cousin Zhen, Jia
Lian and Jia Rong on her left hand and Jia Zheng, Bao-yu, Jia Huan and Jia Lan on her
right. Between them they filled only about half the places round the table.
‘I never felt in the past on these occasions that we were a small family,’
Grandmother Jia commented. ‘Looking at us today, though, I must say we do make a
very miserable turn?out. I can remember Mid-Autumns when there were thirty or
forty of us sitting down together. Ah, what times we had then! We shan’t ever have
numbers like that again. Let’s have the girls to sit with us. See if we can’t fill up that
gap!’
Someone went over to the table presided over by Lady Xing on the other side of the
screen to fetch Ying-chun, Tan?-chun and Xi-chun. Jia Lian, Jia Rong, Bao-yu and the
other boys got up while the chairs were rearranged and the girls were installed at the
table. Then they reseated themselves in their proper order, Jia Lian and Jia Rong with
Ying-chun and Xi-chun between them, and Bao-yu and Jia Huan on either side of
Tan-chun.
Grandmother Jia asked someone to fetch a spray of cassia and made one of the
women sit behind the screen and drum for them, so that they could play Passing the
Branch. Anyone whose hand the branch was in when the drumming stopped had first
to drink a cup of wine and then tell a funny story. The drumming started and the
branch passed from Grandmother Jia to Jia She and so on round the table. It stopped
just as the branch had reached Jia Zheng’s hand on its second time round. He raised
the winecup to his lips to the accom?paniment of much secret nudging and pinching
among the younger folk, to whom the notion of Jia Zheng telling a joke was in itself
unbelievably funny.
Jia Zheng could see how much the old lady was enjoying herself and was anxious not
to spoil her pleasure. Before he could begin his story, however, she saw fit to give
him notice that he must expect to be punished if he did not make her laugh.
‘I can only think of one joke,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If you don’t find it amusing, you will
just have to punish me.’
‘Very well, tell us your one joke then,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘It is about a hen-pecked husband,’ said Jia Zheng.
He got no further. Already his audience were convulsed. It was not that what he had
said was the least bit funny, simply that they had never heard him talking about such
things before.
‘This is sure to be good,’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘In that case,’ said Jia Zheng, laughing himself, ‘let me persuade you to drink a cup
of wine.’
‘Very well,’ said Grandmother Jia.
At once Jia She and Jia Zheng rose to their feet. Jia She held a winecup in both his
hands while Jia Zheng poured wine into it from a wine-kettle. Then Jia Zheng took
the cup from Jia She and ceremoniously set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. The
two men stood in stiffly deferential attitudes beside her while she drank some, then,
having completed their little pantomime, resumed their places.
Jia Zheng proceeded with his story.
‘This hen-pecked husband was so afraid of his wife that he never dared stay long
away from the house. But one Mid-Autumn Festival he chanced to be out shopping
in the street when a friend caught sight of him and insisted on dragging him off to his
house for a drink. Without meaning to, the husband became very drunk - so much so
that he had to stay at his friend’s house for the night. When he woke up the next
morning, he was full of remorse. However, there was nothing for it but to hurry back
home and apologize. When he got back, his wife was washing her feet.
“‘Very well,” she said when he had finished apologizing, “if you will lick my feet
clean, I will forgive you.”
‘The man began to lick, but a feeling of nausea overcame him and he showed signs
of wanting to be sick. When his wife saw this, she was furious.
“‘How dare you?” she screamed, and looked as if she was about to give him a
beating.
‘The husband knelt down in terror and begged to be forgiven.
“‘Please, my dear! It isn’t that I find your feet in the least distasteful. It’s just that I
drank rather a lot of yellow wine last night and ate lots of very rich mooncakes, so
today I am feeling a little queasy.”’
Grandmother Jia and the rest all laughed and Jia Zheng poured Grandmother Jia
another cup of wine.
‘Someone had better change this yellow wine for samshoo,’ she said. ‘We don’t
want you husbands having this sort of trouble with your wives tomorrow!’
        This produced another laugh.
        The drumming recommenced and the branch, starting from Jia Zheng, began
circulating again. This time it stopped with Bao-yu. Bao-yu had been feeling
uncomfortable to start with because of Jia Zheng’s presence, but became ten times
more so when he found himself stuck with the branch.
      ‘If I tell a joke and it’s no good,’ he thought, ‘he will say I’ve no invention. But if I
tell a good one, he’ll say I have no aptitude for serious things, only frivolous ones,
and that will be even worse. I’d much better not tell one at all.’
      Having reached this decision, he stood up and asked his father to excuse him.
      ‘I’m sorry,’ he said, ‘I can’t tell jokes. May I do something else, please?’
      ‘You may compose a poem on the theme of “Mid-Autumn Moon”,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘If it is good, I shall reward you; if it is not - I shall deal with you tomorrow.’
      ‘This is a game we are playing,’ said Grandmother Jia testily. ‘Do you have to
make the boy write poetry?’
‘He can do it if he wants to,’ said Jia Zheng. He was smiling.
‘Very well, let him do it then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Fetch him a brush and. paper
somebody.’
‘No padding, now!’ Jia Zheng told Bao-yu. ‘No “crystal”, “ice”, “jade”, “silver”, “light”,
“bright”, “white” - anything of that sort. I want something original that will give me
some idea of what you have been doing with your mind during this past year or two.’
Bao-yu found these injunctions by no means uncongenial, and having succeeded, in
quite a short time, in thinking of a quatrain, he wrote it out and handed it to his
father. Jia Zheng said nothing, but was observed to nod after he had finished reading
it, which Grandmother Jia interpreted to mean that he could not have found the
poem too bad.
‘Well?’ she asked him.
Jia Zheng wanted to make her happy.
‘Not at all bad,’ he said. ‘It’s a pity he won’t study, but his verses are really quite
elegant.’
‘Well, that’s all right then,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘You ought to encourage the boy,
so that next time he tries even harder.’
‘You are quite right,’ said Jia Zheng. He turned to one of the old women in
attendance. ‘Tell my boys to get out two of the fans I brought back with me from the
South, will you, and give them to Bao-yu for me.’
Bao-yu came forward and kotowed. After he had gone back to his seat, the game
continued. This time the branch stop?ped in Jia She’s hand. He drank his wine and
then told the following story.
‘This one is about a dutiful son whose mother was ill. He tried everywhere to get a
doctor for her, but couldn’t find one, so in the end he was reduced to calling in an old
woman who practised acupuncture. Now this old dame knew nothing of physiology,
nevertheless she assured the son that it was inflammation of the heart that his
mother was suffering from and that she could cure it instantly with her needle. The
son became very alarmed.
“‘If metal in any form comes into contact with the heart,” he said, “it means death.
Surely you’re not going to put a needle in her heart?”
“‘No, no, I shan’t put it in the heart,” said the old woman. “I mean to put it in here,
over the ribs.”
“‘But that’s too far from the heart,” said the son. “Surely if you put it in there, it
won’t do any good?”
“‘Oh yes it will,” said the old woman. “A mother’s heart always inclines towards
one side.”’
The others all laughed, and Grandmother Jia was persuaded to drink another half cup
of wine. After a long pause she said somewhat wryly,
‘Perhaps I could do with a bit of the old dame’s acupuncture myself.’
Jia She realized, too late, that his somewhat tactless choice of story could be
interpreted as a criticism of his own mother. Hurriedly rising to his feet, he held up
his cup to toast her with and did what he could to change the subject. Fortunately
the old lady made no further reference to his gaffe and the game soon continued.
This time the branch stopped with Jia Huan.
Jia Huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies. He was even
beginning to show a certain interest in verse, though his tastes in it were decidedly
peculiar. When Bao-yu’s poem was praised earlier on, he had been dying to
demonstrate his own talent, but had not dared risk the charge of showing off in his
father’s presence. Now that the luck of the game had given him free licence, he
called for paper and writing-brush and, in a matter of moments, wrote out a quatrain
which he handed to his father. Jia Zheng was not impressed. It was a somewhat weird
little poem, and whatever advances Jia Huan might lately have made in his
schoolwork, they certainly did not reveal them?selves in his choice of words.
‘It is easy to see that you and Bao-yu are brothers,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Whether in your
ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound
classical models. The “Two Incomparables” we should call you, not because you are
incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are
incomparably hard to knock any sense into: though whereas Bao-yu seems to think
that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a
second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry
and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang.’
This (not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny) provoked
general laughter.
‘Let me see that poem,’ said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost
immediately began praising it.
‘I like this poem, it’s got guts in it. Boys from families like ours don’t need to read
themselves half blind in order to get started on a career. Provided they’ve read
enough to show that they are better educated than the rabble and are capable of
holding down a job, they can hardly fail to get on. Why waste a lot of time and
energy on turning the boy into a book-worm? What I like about this poem is that it is
just the sort of good amateur, not-too-brainy poem you’d expect a young chap of our
class to write.’
He sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to Jia Huan as a reward and
smilingly patted him on the head.
‘You go on writing poems like this, young fellow! We’ll have no trouble getting you
a posting when the time comes, don’t you worry!’
Jia Zheng protested.
‘Whatever you think of the poem, it hardly justifies talking in this way about the
boy’s future.’
Meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could
continue; but Grandmother Jia intervened.
‘Why don’t you two go now? I’m sure your gentlemen must be waiting for you, and
it would be discourteous to neglect them. Besides, it must be all of ten o’clock and if
you go now it will give the children a chance to enjoy them?selves unconstrainedly
for a while before they go to bed.’
The two brothers at once got up to go, and after a parting cup offered to them on
behalf of all the rest, they went off, taking Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian with them, but
leaving Bao?yu and the two younger boys with the womenfolk.
What happened after their departure will be related in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 76

Flute-playing at Convex Pavilion provokes
too much melancholy
And linked verses at Concave Pavilion betray
a morbid sensitivity



After Jia She and Jia Zheng had left, taking the two younger men with them,
Grandmother Jia had the screen removed and proposed that those sitting at both
tables should combine to make a single party. The serving-women cleared and wiped
the table, replenished and replaced the plates of foodstuff, and set out clean
winecups and chopsticks. While they were doing this, Grandmother Jia and the other
members of the family were putting on more clothing, washing their hands; rinsing
their mouths out, and drinking tea. When all was ready they arranged themselves
round the one table. As they did so, Grandmother Jia noticed, for the first time that
evening, that Bao-chai and Bao-qin were not there. With Li Wan and Xi-feng also
away ill, the family gathering seemed sadly depleted. She commented on this fact to
Lady Wang.
‘In past years, when Sir Zheng was away, we invited your sister to enjoy the
Mid-Autumn moon with us. To be sure, we had some very happy times with her, but
the recollection that one of our dear ones was missing - in my case a son, in yours a
husband, in the children’s a father somewhat dampened our enjoyment. This year,
now that he is back, I was looking forward to a really jolly family party; but now,
unfortunately, it’s your sister and her children who can’t be with us. Well, I suppose
as she’s got two more members of her family with her this year we could hardly
expect her to leave them behind and come over here simply to keep me amused. But
what a pity that Feng should have chosen this time to be ill! She is always such a
tonic as good as ten other people at a party! It only goes to show. One can’t have
everything.’
She sighed.
‘Fetch me a bigger cup,’ she said presently, ‘and pour me some good hot wine.’
Lady Wang smiled.
‘You have both your sons with you this year, Mother. Surely that is a gain? There
may have been more females present in previous years, but surely having all your
own children about you is better?’
‘Yes, yes, of course it is,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I am happy. That is why I have asked
for a larger cup. You must all have larger cups too.’
It was getting very late now and the other ladies had no real inclination for carousing;
but as Grandmother Jia showed no signs of flagging, they were obliged to keep her
company. The effect of forcing themselves to drink with her was that they became
unbearably sleepy.
Grandmother Jia called for a carpet to be spread out at the top of the terrace steps.
The remaining mooncakes, melons and other eatables were carried over there and
the maids and womenservants invited to sit round in a big circle, eating them and
enjoying the moon.
Grandmother Jia, too, looked up at the moon. It had now reached its meridian and
was even clearer and more beautiful than it had been earlier in the evening.
‘To get full enjoyment of so fine a moon,’ she said, ‘the music of a flute is
indispensable.’
She had the girls of the family’s little ten-piece orchestra summoned; but when they
arrived, they were informed that not all of them would be required to play.
‘Too much sound would spoil the effect,’ she said. ‘The flute on its own will be
enough. And we should like to hear it from quite a long way away.’
The flautist went off obediently to do her bidding. A moment after she had left, one
of Lady Xing’s women came hurrying up and whispered something in Lady Xing’s ear.
‘What is it?’ said Grandmother Jia.
‘It’s Sir She,’ said Lady Xing. ‘On his way back just now he tripped over a rock and
twisted his ankle.’
Grandmother Jia at once sent two of her own women to see how he was and told
Lady Xing that she was to go back immediately and look after him. Lady Xing rose and
took her leave.
‘Zhen’s wife may as well go back now too,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Then I shall go
home to bed.’
‘I don’t intend to go back at all tonight,’ said You-shi. ‘I have resolved to spend the
night here with you.’
‘That will never do!’ said Grandmother Jia, laughing. ‘Tonight of all nights a young
couple like you ought to be together. I can’t have you staying away from your
husband for my sake!’
You-shi coloured.
‘Really, Grandma, what a thing to say! I suppose Zhen and I are still comparatively
young, but we have been married nearly twenty years, you know: we are both nearly
forty. And in any case, we’re still in mourning for Sir Jing. I’d much better spend the
night here with you.’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I’d quite forgotten you were still in mourning.
Poor Sir Jing! It must be more than two years now - but I ought not to have forgotten.
I shall drink this big cupful as a punishment! All right, you’d better stay and keep me
company then. Let Rong’s wife see Lady Xing out. After that, she can go back home
herself.’
You-shi instructed her daughter-in-law accordingly, where?upon little Hu-shi
accompanied Lady Xing as far as the main gate of the mansion. There both ladies got
into their carriages and went their separate ways.
Meanwhile the company had been over to the other side of the terrace to admire the
cassia. They now took their places at table once more and were served with freshly
heated wine.
In the midst of their chattering and laughter, suddenly startling them into silence, the
undulant, lamenting sound of a flute came floating up to them from the cassia-trees
below. Beautiful at any time, such music heard in the stillness of the night under the
great vault of the sky with a bright moon above and only the cold, invisible night
wind stirring in the earth below steals like a balm over the soul, soothing and
dissolving all earthly griefs and cares. They listened, rapt and silent, with upturned,
attentive faces. The music continued for about the space in which one could
comfortably have drunk two cups of tea and then stopped. The momentary silence
which followed it was broken by cries of admiration from all present. The winecups
were replenished with warm wine.
‘You see,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It is good, isn’t it?’
‘It truly is,’ they agreed. ‘Who could have imagined anything so beautiful? If it
weren’t for you, Grandma, we might never have had this experience.’
‘It could have been much better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘To get the full benefit you
need to hear something really slow.’
She had a large cup of wine poured and ordered one of her women to take it to the
flautist.
‘Tell her to take her time with this, and say that when she’s finished drinking it, I’d
like her to play us another piece, only more softly this time.’
While this woman went off with the message and the wine, the two women she had
sent off earlier to inquire after Jia She’s ankle returned.
‘We’ve had a look at Sir She, Your Ladyship. His right ankle is rather swollen, but
he’s taken some medicine and the pain is not so bad now. It doesn’t look very
serious.’
Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed.
‘You see? The truth is, I worry too much. He was trying to make out that I don’t
care about him at all!’
While she was saying this, Faithful appeared carrying a large cape and hood.
‘Here, put these on,’ she said. ‘It’s getting very late. You don’t want to be outside
when the dew falls. Aren’t you afraid of catching cold? I think when you’ve sat a little
longer, you ought to come back home to bed.’
‘Just when I’m enjoying myself you have to start nagging me to go to bed,’ said
Grandmother Jia. ‘I hope you don’t think I’m drunk. I’ve decided to stay up till dawn.’
She called rebelliously for more wine, but did put the cape and hood on
notwithstanding. The other ladies drank with her for company and did their best to
be amusing. Then, silencing them once more, the sound of the flute concealed in the
cassia-bushes below came stealing into their ears, this time more plaintive even than
before. Indeed, this time the combination of the flute’s melancholy with the effects
of nocturnal stillness and ghostly moonlight induced a feeling of such over?powering
sadness in the listeners that they turned their backs on it and sought, with talk and
somewhat forced laughter, to escape it. Fresh wine was called for and the flautist told
to stop playing.
‘I’ll cheer you up, Lady Jia,’ said You-shi. ‘Let me tell you a funny story. I learnt it
specially for the occasion.’
‘Ha, ha, ha. Yes, that would be very nice, a joke. Do tell me,’ said Grandmother Jia
with a jollity that seemed somewhat strained.
‘There were once four brothers,’ You-shi began. ‘The eldest had only one eye, the
second had only one ear, the third had only one nostril, and the fourth, though he
had all his parts in order, was dumb.’
She had got no farther with her story when she became aware that the old lady’s
head was nodding down upon her bosom and her eyelids drooping as though she
was about to go to sleep. She broke off at once, and she and Lady Wang both called
gently to her to wake up. Grandmother Jia opened her eyes wide and laughed.
‘I’m not sleeping, I was just resting my eyes. Go on with your story. I’m listening.’
‘It’s very late,’ said Lady Wang. ‘The air is cold tonight and there is a lot of dew.
Won’t you go home and rest now, Mother? We can have another moon-party
tomorrow night, if you feel like it. The moon on the sixteenth is still well worth
watching.’
‘What time is it?’ Grandmother Jia asked.
‘Past two o’clock,’ said Lady Wang. ‘The children couldn’t hold out any longer. They
have all gone off to bed.’
Grandmother Jia looked round the table. Only Tan-chun was still sitting there in the
semicircle of empty chairs.
‘Well,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘they are not used to staying up late. Considering the
amount of weakness and sickliness there is among them, I suppose it is just as well.
But there’s my little Tan, sitting there all on her own, poor child! You go to bed too,
my dear. We’ll end the party now.’
She got up herself as she said this, and after taking a sip or two of green tea, climbed
into her bamboo carrying-chair and was borne out of the Garden by two women, the
rest walking beside her or following close behind. But of her and them no more.
One of the women who remained behind to clear the table and stack the crockery
noticed that a single porcelain cup was missing. After looking everywhere for it
unsuccessfully, she appealed to the other servants.
‘I suppose one of you must have dropped it accidentally and thrown it away
somewhere. Do please tell us, and let us have the broken pieces, so that when we
report the loss we shan’t be accused of having stolen it.’
‘None of us has broken it,’ said the others. ‘It might have been a maid of one of the
young ladies that broke it. If you can think who it might have been, I should go and
ask them.’
‘You are right,’ said the woman, suddenly recollecting. ‘I remember Kingfisher
coming to fetch a cup for her mistress. I must go and ask her for it.’
She had not far to look. A short way along the paved path at the bottom of the steps
she came upon her and Nightingale walking along together. It was Kingfisher who
spoke first.
‘Oh, has Her Old Ladyship ended the party then? I suppose you don’t know where
my mistress has gone?’
‘I’ve come to ask you what you’ve done with one of our teacups,’ said the woman,
‘and you ask me about your mistress!’
Kingfisher laughed.
‘I poured out a cup of tea some time ago and handed it to her, and the next thing I
knew was she’d disappeared - with the teacup.’
‘Her Ladyship said just now that the young ladies had all gone to bed,’ said the
woman. ‘I don’t know where you two can have been larking about all this time not to
know anything about it.’
‘I’m sure our mistresses wouldn’t have slipped off to bed without telling us,’ said
Kingfisher. ‘More likely they just went off for a walk. Perhaps when Her Old Ladyship
left they joined the others to see her back to her apartment. We’ll go over there now
and have a look. If they are there, we shall know where your cup is. Why don’t you
come round and ask me for it tomorrow? There’s no pressing hurry for it now, is
there?’
‘There’s no hurry as long as I know where it is,’ said the woman. ‘I’ll call round and
ask you for it tomorrow.’
She went back to the pavilion then, to finish stacking the crockery.
*
Lady Wang was wrong. Dai-yu and Xiang-yun had not gone to bed. The sight of all
those Jias enjoying the moonlight (in spite of Grandmother Jia’s complaint that the
numbers were so few) and the thought of Bao-chai and Bao-qin enjoying a
moon-party of their own with Aunt Xue and the two Xue males made the occasion a
painful one for Dai-yu. She had slipped away not in order to go to bed but to lean on
the terrace railings and cry. Bao-yu on this occasion had little thought for anything
but Skybright’s illness, which had lately taken a serious turn for the worse, and after
several appeals from his mother to go to bed, he had availed himself of the excuse
for going back in order to find out how she was. Tan?chun was still feeling too much
out of temper after the recent domestic upheavals to have any appetite for
amusement. Ying-chun and Xi-chun might have kept Dai-yu company, but since they
did not as a rule get on with her very well, it would not have occurred to them to do
so. That left only Xiang-yun to offer her some comfort.
‘Now coz, this won’t do! You’re an intelligent girl: you must take more care of
yourself. I must say, it is too bad of Chai and Qin. All that talk about spending
Mid-Autumn night enjoying the moon together and using the occasion to revive the
Poetry Club with another linked couplets session - and then, when the time comes,
they leave us in the lurch and go off to enjoy the moon by themselves! No Poetry
Club, no linked couplets, nothing! It’s all the fault of those wretched men! You
remember the remark made by the first Song emperor: “No one but me is allowed to
snore in this bed?room!” That’s the menfolk’s attitude at a party. Never mind. Since
the others haven’t come, we’ll make up some linked couplets ourselves and take
them along tomorrow to shame them with.’
Xiang-yun was so enthusiastic a comforter that Dai-yu felt she could not show herself
wholly unresponsive.
‘The trouble is, all these people here are making so much noise,’ she said. ‘It’s not
an atmosphere very conducive to poetic inspiration.’
‘Although the hilltop is a good place for enjoying the moon from,’ said Xiang-yun,
‘the moon would look even better over water. I don’t know whether you realize it,
but one side of this hill does actually give onto the lake. There is a little building there
called the Concave Pavilion nestling in a hollow quite close to the water’s edge.
Whoever made this Garden must have been quite an educated person. The place
where we are now is obviously called the Convex Pavilion because it is on top of the
convex hill, and Concave Pavilion must have been given its name because it is in a
hollow. Those two words “concave” and “convex” are very seldom encountered in
literature. Their use in landscape gardening for the naming of features must be even
rarer. To my mind the linking together of these two pavilions by so unusual a pair of
names suggests that they must have been specially designed for viewing the moon
from: Convex Pavilion for those who like the small, remote moon of the mountains
and high places, Concave Pavilion for those who prefer the silky whiteness of the
great orb reflected in the surface of the water. “Convex” and “concave” are often
thought of as vulgar, unpoetical words, but that is only because of their modern
associations. Some people even call that well-known line of Lu You’s vulgar:
In well-worn concave patch the ground ink settles;
but I find that criticism rather silly.’
‘Lu You is by no means the only writer to have used those words in a work of
literature,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Jiang Yan uses them in his prose-poem “Moss”, Dong-fang
Shuo uses them somewhere in his Book of Marvels, and in Lives of the Painters they
turn up in a description of Zhang Seng-yao’s decoration of the Ekayāna Monastery at
Nanking. In fact, there must be countless instances in literature. I think it’s merely
ignorance that nowadays leads people to dismiss them as “unpoetical”. To tell you
the truth, it was I who gave these two pavilions their names. That year when Bao-yu
did all the naming of places in the Garden there were several places left over
afterwards which he either hadn’t got round to naming or had given names to that
were thought unsuitable, and the task of naming them was given to us girls. The
names we made up were taken to the Palace for Cousin Yuan’s approval and she sent
word back saying that provided Uncle Zheng approved of them they were to be used.
So that’s how I came to name these two pavilions. All right, let’s go down then.’
The two girls descended the slope of the little mountain. A few steps round a turn in
the pathway which skirted the foot of it took them to the pavilion. Near the water’s
edge, linking it with Lotus Pavilion farther along the shore, was a bamboo railing. The
two old women who were on night watch in it, little imagining that an overspill from
the hilltop party would come their way, had long since put their light out and gone to
sleep. Dai-yu and Xiang-yun laughed when they saw that the pavilion was in
darkness.
‘They’ve gone to sleep. Never mind. All the better. Let’s sit outside here on the
covered verandah and look at the moonlight on the water.’
They found a couple of drum-shaped bamboo stools to sit down on. A great white
moon in the water reflected the great white moon above, competing with it in
brightness. The girls felt like mermaids sitting in a shining crystal palace beneath the
sea. A little wind that brushed over the surface of the water making tiny ripples
seemed to cleanse their souls and fill them with buoyant lightness.
‘If only I were in a boat now, with some wine to drink!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘If this were
my own home, I should jump into a boat now immediately.’
‘There’s an old saying: “Who seeks perfection must abandon joy”,’ said Dai-yu. ‘If
you ask me, I think we are very well the way we are. Why do we have to be in a boat
to enjoy this?’
Xiang-yun laughed.
“‘One conquest breeds appetite for another.” That applies to most of us, you know,
not only to generals.’
While she was speaking, a flute began to play. They listened for some moments to its
plaintive rise and fall.
‘Grandma and Aunt Wang are obviously enjoying themselves,’ said Dai-yu, smiling.
The flute is a very happy touch. We shall put it to our own purposes, you and I. It
shall inspire our verse. We both like pentameters, don’t we? Let’s do linked
pentameters as we did on that other occasion.’
‘What rhyme?’ said Xiang-yun.
‘We could use a number for a rhyme,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Let’s count the uprights in the
railing as far as that angle over there. Whatever the number is shall be our rhyme.’
‘That’s a very ingenious idea,’ said Xiang-yun.
The two girls got up and walked along the railing to count. It turned out that there
were exactly eight posts from one angle of the railing to the next.
‘Hmn,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Eight. I wonder how far we shall get with that rhyme. The
danger with this sort of thing always is that after a time the rhyming becomes forced
- or else one simply can’t go on at all. Well, you begin.’
‘I’d like to have been able to see afterwards which of us had done better,’ said
Dai-yu, ‘but unfortunately we haven’t got anything to write with.’
‘I’ll write it out tomorrow,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I may not be very clever, but I’ve got a
reasonably good memory.’
‘All right,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll start with something very prosy and obvious.’

DAI-YU:
Fifteenth night of the Eighth, Mid-Autumn moon -

Xiang-yun thought a bit before following.

XIANG-YUN:
Whose joys the First Full Moon’s do emulate,
Under your crystal-constellated heaven -

DAI-TU:
The sounds of music everywhere pulsate.
At many a hoard the reckless winecups fly –


‘Ha! I like the “reckless winecups”,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I must try to do them justice.
Let me see.’
She thought for a bit.

XIANG-YUN:
Where friends are met your feast to celebrate.
The air is crisp, the wind more bracing blows –


‘You finished the couplet very well,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but that second line is a bit weak,
isn’t it?’
    ‘We’ve got a long way to go and the rhyming will soon begin to get harder,’ said
Xiang-yun. ‘I want to save up any good ideas I may have until later.’
‘Mind you produce some good lines later then,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Otherwise you are
going to look pretty silly!’
She proceeded to finish the couplet.

DAI-YU:
In the clear sky the cold stars scintillate.
Grey hairs are mocked when they for cakes dispute -’

I don’t like that line,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘It sounds like an allusion, but I think you have
just made it up to confuse me.’
‘That shows you don’t read much,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s a perfectly good allusion.
There’s a story about quarrelling over cakes in the Official history of the Tang Dynasty.
I’ll show you it tomorrow.’
‘Well, anyway, I’m not going to be confused,’ said Xiang yun. ‘I can cap that line.’

XIANG-YUN:
Green girls divide the melons, eight and eight.
New scents the jade-like cassia have enriched -’


‘Now that really is a bogus allusion,’ said Dai-yu.
‘We’ll look both our allusions up tomorrow and the others can judge between us,’
said Xiang-yun. ‘In the meanwhile, let’s get on with this and stop wasting time.’
‘That’s all very well,’ said Dai-yu, ‘but I don’t like your other line either. We ought to
be able to manage without clichés like “lade-like cassia”. I call that mere padding.’

DAI-YU:
Closed day-lilies the morrow’s gold gestate.
A blaze of candles gilds the radiant feasters –


“‘Gold gestate”!’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Well, that’s one way of getting a rhyme - a pretty
cheap one if you ask me! And your second line is quite as much padding as mine
was.’
‘If you hadn’t started with “jade-like cassia”, I shouldn’t have brought in my
gold-gestating day-lilies,’ said Dai-yu. ‘And as regards my second line, I should have
thought a few words on the brilliance of the feast were called for, in order to do
justice to the occasion.’
Since Dai-yu was evidently not going to concede anything, Xiang-yun was obliged to
finish off the couplet.

XIANG-YUN:
Whom frequent sconcings soon inebriate.
Competing, they observe the game’s strict order –


‘Ah, that’s a good line!’ said Dai-yu.
She thought a bit before capping it.

DAI-YU:
And rules for ‘I spy’ gravely promulgate.
Some shake the pretty dice and make them roll –


‘I like “gravely promulgate”,’ said Xiang-yun, laughing. ‘It lifts a vulgar subject up
and gives it tone. But then your “dice” in the next line bring us back again to the
banal.’
She followed as best she could.

XIANG-YUN:
Or, to the drum’s quick beat, the branch rotate.
The clear rays glint on roofs and courts below -
‘Well capped!’ said Dai-yu. ‘But then in your next line you wander off the track. Is
that the best you can do, padding out with that stuff about moonlight?’
‘In point of fact we haven’t said much about the moon yet,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Surely
a few words on the subject are in order? Isn’t that what our poem is supposed to be
about?’
‘All right, let it pass,’ said Dai-yu. ‘We’ll have another look at it tomorrow.’

She continued.

DAI-YU:
And all in silvery light illuminate.
Prizes and forfeits impartially they ponder -


‘Oh dear! are we back with that lot again?’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Why not something
about ourselves for a change?’

XIANG-YUN:
Sibling verse-contests they adjudicate.
Poets lean on railings, seeking inspiration –

'You’ve managed to get round to us at last!’ said Dai-yu.

DAI-YU:
Or hunt for rhymes, propped up against a gate.
The excitement lingers, though the party’s over –


‘Oh, does it?’ said Xiang-yun.

XIANG-YUN:
The sounds of music softly terminate.
Slowly the talk and laughter fade to silence -


‘It’s getting harder all the time now to rhyme,’ said Dai-yu.

DAI-YU:
Leaving a moonscape hushed and desolate.
On dewy steps the tiny toadstools sprout –
‘Just a minute, I can’t think how to rhyme this,’ said Xiang-yun.
She got up and paced to and fro, hands clasped behind her, thinking.
‘Ha, yes, that’ll do!’ she said after some moments. ‘Good job I thought of that word,
otherwise I might have had to give up.’

XIANG-YUN:
Tight-curled albizzia bushes pernoctate.
A rain-swelled swirl rips through the brook-bed rocks –

Dai-yu leapt to her feet, unable to restrain a cry of admira?tion.


‘You wretch! You certainly have left the good things till last. “Pernoctate” is a
splendid word. But what is “albizzia” for goodness’ sake?’
‘I came across it yesterday in the Prose Anthology,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I was going to
look it up because I didn’t know what kind of tree it was, but Cousin Chai told me I
didn’t need to: she said it was another name for what we nowadays call “mimosa”. I
didn’t believe her, so I looked it up all the same. She was right. That girl knows
everything.’
‘Well, it was very clever of you to have thought of it,’ said Dai-yu, smiling,
‘especially as mimosa does in fact close up at night. But that “rain-swelled swirl” line
is brilliant. That single line is worth all the lines we have made up so far put together.
I shall have to think very carefully before capping it. I very much doubt whether, even
so, I shall be able to think of anything as good.’
After thinking for a while, she produced the following.

DAI-YU:
And wind-combed leaves on ledges congregate.
The Weaving Maid in lonely splendour shines -


‘Your capping line is not at all bad,’ said Xiang-yun, ‘but that second line wanders
off the track a bit. Still, I suppose you could say your “Weaving Maid” is saved from
being mere padding by the “lonely”. It introduces an element of feeling into the line.’

XIANG-YUN:
Damp airs the silver Toad of the moon inflate.
See where the Hare immortal medicine pounds -
Dai-yu nodded silently for some moments before reciting her own two lines.

DAI-YU:
Thither Chang E was forced to emigrate.
A man moves upwards through the constellations -

Xiang-yun, gazing up at the moon, also nodded.

XIANG-YUN:
A raft floats skywards with a human freight.
Waxing or waning, the moon’s face, ever changing –


‘That capping line is not good,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It merely repeats what my line said in
other words. You manage to get clear again with your second line. I suppose you
wanted to compensate for the sameness of the first couplet by making a big jump in
the second.’

DAI-YU:
Its substance changeless and inanimate.
Soon the clepsydra’s night-long drip will cease –

Xiang-yun was about to continue when Dai-yu drew her attention to a black shape in
the middle of the lake.
‘Look, in that dark shadow there, like a human shape! Do you think it could be a
ghost?’
Xiang-yun laughed.
‘Oh, she’s seeing ghosts now! I’m not afraid of ghosts. I shall throw a stone at it.’
She bent down to pick up a pebble and hurled it into the centre of the lake. They
heard a plop and saw the distorted image of the moon expand and contract as
concentric ripples travelled outwards from the shattered surface. There was a loud
squawk, and from the middle of the dark shadow a white stork flew up and flapped
his way across the water in the direction of Lotus Pavilion.
‘So that’s who it was!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I wasn’t expecting him to be there. He gave me
quite a shock.’
‘I’m very grateful to that stork,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘He’s given me a first line for the
next couplet.’

XIANG-YUN:
Black shades the lamp’s last gleams annihilate
A stork’s dark shape crosses the cold, bright water –

Dai-yu murmured admiringly, but stamped with vexation when she began to think
about finishing the couplet.
‘Wretched stork, coming to her aid like that! This is not like the “rain-swelled swirl”
couplet: I’m not going to be able to complete it by paralleling the whole line. A
contrast for the dark moving shape is the most I can hope for. But your line is so
natural, so simple and expressive. I feel almost like giving up.’
‘Perhaps if we both thought about it we could finish it together,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘Or,
if you prefer, let’s break off now and you can try again tomorrow.’
Dai-yu stared up at the sky, ignoring her. Suddenly, after remaining immobile for
some seconds, she gave a little laugh.
‘Stop your chatter, girl! I can finish this couplet. Listen:

DAI- YU:
Where, moon-embalmed, a dead muse lies in state.

Xiang-yun clapped her hands.
‘Excellent! Couldn’t be better! I love your “dead muse”!’ She sighed. ‘I mean
excellent from a purely poetic point of view, because it’s so original. It’s a bit morbid,
though. I don’t think it can be good for a person in your state of health to indulge in
such chilling fantasies.’
‘With you to compete against, how else could I keep my end up?’ said Dai-yu.
‘Because I put so much into that last line -’
Just at that moment a figure stepped out from behind the spur of rock beyond the
railings.
‘Bravo! An excellent line!’ said this person. ‘But it is, indeed, a little too melancholy.
Don’t do any more. If you go on from there, the danger is that you may produce
something forced and mechanical, which instead of offsetting the beauty of your line
will merely spoil it.’
Startled by this unexpected interruption, the two girls looked hard in the direction
from which it came and with some surprise recognized the speaker as Adamantina.
‘What are you doing here?’ they asked her.
‘Hearing the sounds of your moon-watching party, followed later by the sound of a
flute playing, I was tempted to come out and enjoy the moon myself. I wanted to see
it over this open expanse of water, where it appears to most advantage, and as I
approached, I could hear you both reciting. Such pure refinement constrained me to
stay and listen. But there were lines which, in spite of their excellence, contained a
note of almost decadent melancholy, lines which made me fearful for the person
uttering them. That is why I came out of my concealment and prevented you from
going on. Lady Jia has long since broken up the party. Everyone else in the Garden
must be in bed by now. I wonder where your maids are. Doubtless they are
somewhere looking for you. Are you not afraid of catching cold? Come with me, and I
shall give you some hot tea to drink. It must be nearly dawn.’
Dai-yu laughed.
‘I’d no idea the night was so far advanced.’
The three of them walked together to Green Bower Hermitage. A faint light still
flickered in the Buddha shrine and the incense in the burner gave off a tiny smoke. All
the old lay-sisters were asleep. A little maid, nodding sleepily on Adamantina’s
meditation mat, appeared to be the only person still up. She roused herself when
Adamantina called to her and made some tea with water from the already boiling
kettle. Just at that moment there was a knocking at the gate and the little maid
hurried to open it. It turned out to be Nightingale and Kingfisher with two or three
old womenservants, looking for their mistresses. They found their mistresses drinking
tea inside.
‘Well!’ they said. ‘You’ve led us a fine old dance! We’ve been all over the Garden
looking for you. We even tried Mrs Xue’s outside. In the end we happened to go to
that little pavilion under the mountain, just as the caretakers were waking up. When
we asked them about you they said, “There were two people talking outside on the
covered verandah a while ago, then a third one came along and we heard them
saying they were going to the Hermitage.” That’s how we knew you were here.’
Adamantina told the little maid to take them round to the back where they could sit
down and have some tea. She herself took paper, inkstone, brush and ink and began
writing out the poem in linked couplets at the other two’s dictation.
Dai-yu was impressed by Adamantina’s enthusiasm.
‘I have never before liked to ask for your opinions about poetry because I have
never before seen you show so much interest,’ she said; ‘but since you now obviously
are in the mood for discussing it, won’t you please favour us with some criticism? If
you think that what we have done is no good at all, let us burn it; hut if you can see
ways of improving it, do please correct it for us.’
‘I certainly would not presume to alter any of it,’ said Adamantina smiling; ‘but as
there are no less than twenty-three couplets here, I am pretty sure that all your best
lines must have been used up by now, and that if you were to go on, there would be
a danger that you might begin to flag. What I should have liked to do would have
been to go on for you myself; but I am afraid that if I did, I might only succeed in
adding a dog’s tail to your leopard-skin!’
Dai-yu had never seen Adamantina compose poetry before and took her up eagerly
on her obvious willingness to do so now.
‘Oh please do, if you have a mind to! Though our verses may be of little value, they
will gain distinction by being associated with yours.’
‘In order to conclude what you have done so far,’ said Adamantina, ‘it will be
necessary to bring the poem back to what we Buddhists call the “proper aspect”. If
we continue to abandon reality and go chasing after the bizarre and the supernatural,
we shall be guilty not only of unmaidenliness but also of losing sight of our subject.’
Mesdemoiselles Lin and Shi agreed.
Adamantina picked up the brush and began, muttering and writing by turns, until,
having knocked off some dozen or so couplets, all in the same apparently effortless
manner, she laid the brush down again and handed the paper over for the other two
to read. This is what she had written:

In golden censers figured incense burns;
Unguents in their jade pots coagulate.

A flute provokes the grieving widow’s weeping;
She craves some warmth her bed’s chill to abate.

Its cheerless hangings stir in the wind of autumn,
Its love-ducks mock a mistress without mate.

Thick dews make treacherous the slippery moss,
And spears of frost the tall bamboos serrate.

Better the winding lakeside path to follow,
Or lonely hilltop to perambulate.

Bound demons seem to writhe in the tortured rock-shapes;
In the trees’ black shadows wild things pullulate.

Light’s harbingers begin with the dark to struggle,
And morning’s first dews to accumulate.

Birds in a thousand treetops wake the woodland;
In the echoing valley sad apes ululate.
My footsteps tread the path’s familiar turnings,
Nor need the stream’s source to investigate.

From Green Bower convent sounds the matin bell;
And Sweet-rice cocks the dawn anticipate.

Why should this rapt enjoyment end in sorrow,
Or timid cares our conscience irritate?

Poets ought in themselves to find their pleasure,
Not in the message they communicate.

As daylight breaks let none of us plead tiredness,
But over tea continue our debate.

At the end of these couplets she had written down the title for the whole poem:
Mid-Autumn Night in Prospect Garden: A Poem in Thirty-five Couplets
Dai-yu and Xiang-yun were full of admiration.
‘Strange that we should be always looking round for poetic talent,’ they said, ‘and
all the time we have had a poet like you on our very doorstep! These verses of yours
make anything we have ever done look very amateurish.’
‘I must have another look at them tomorrow and touch them up a bit,’ said
Adamantina smiling. ‘It’s already dawn. We really must go to bed.’
Dai-yu and Xiang-yun got up and took their leave. Their maids left with them.
Adamantina saw them outside the gate and stood a long while watching them go.
They had already covered a good part of the way back when she at last went in again
and closed the gate after her.
Kingfisher wanted Xiang-yun to go to Li Wan’s place to sleep.
‘The people at Mrs Zhu’s are expecting you, miss. You ought to go there.’
‘Drop in there on the way and tell them not to wait up for me any longer,’ said
Xiang-yun. ‘Mrs Zhu is still ill. If I went back there to sleep now, I’m afraid I might
disturb her. If I’m going to disturb anyone, let it be Miss Lin.’
When they reached the Naiad’s House, they found half the servants there asleep. The
girls took off their ornaments and outer clothes, washed, and got into bed.
Nightingale let down the bed-curtains, and having set the lamp down within easy
reach of the bed, went out and closed the door.
But neither of the girls could sleep, Xiang-yun because she always had difficulty in
getting to sleep in a strange bed, and Dai-yu because her anaemic condition always
made sleeping difficult for her, and because on this occasion she had long since
passed beyond tiredness, so that for her sleep was in any case out of the question.
For a long time the two of them lay tossing and turning on the bed.
‘Can’t you get to sleep?’ Dai-yu asked Xiang-yun eventually.
‘I can never get to sleep in a strange bed,’ said Xiang-yun with a rueful laugh.
‘Anyway, I’m too tired to get to sleep. I’ll just have to lie and rest. Can’t you get to
sleep either?’
Dai-yu sighed.
‘This is no novelty for me,’ she said. ‘I don’t suppose I get more than ten really good
nights’ sleep in a year.’
‘No wonder you’re always ill,’ said Xiang-yun.
Our story continues in the following chapter.




CHAPTER 77

A wronged maid takes a loving
last leave of her master
And three young actresses seek to
escape matrimony in the cloister



To Lady Wang it appeared that, with the passing of the Mid?-Autumn festival,
Xi-feng’s condition had improved considerably. True, she was still far from well, but
she could get about in the house now and even venture out of doors. The physician,
who, notwithstanding this improvement, had on Lady Wang’s instructions been
requested to continue his daily visits, was now recommending a course of pills
designed to regularize her periods and make some new blood to replace the
quantities she had lost. Observing that the prescription for these pills included two
ounces of the best quality ginseng, Lady Wang ordered her maids to get out her own
supply. After much rummaging they found a few pieces not much thicker than a large
hairpin in one of the little medicine-boxes. When they showed them to Lady Wang,
she thought them of too inferior a quality and ordered the maids to look again; but
further searching produced only a large packet of ‘whis?kers’ broken off from the
rootlets.
‘When one doesn’t need this stuff, there is always plenty of it,’ said Lady Wang
testily. ‘It is only when we want some that you can’t find any. I am always telling you:
you must keep a proper check on things and you must keep them together, but you
won’t do as I say: you will leave things lying around all over the place, and then
afterwards you never know where to look for them.’
‘I think this is all the ginseng we’ve got,’ said Suncloud. ‘That time Lady Xing came
for some, I think she must have taken it all.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Lady Wang. ‘Go and look again. And look properly this time!’
Suncloud had to go off and search some more. She came back bearing several
packets of herbs.
‘I don’t know what is in these, Your Ladyship. If there isn’t any ginseng in any of
these, then we really haven’t got any.’
Lady Wang opened the packets. She had no recollection of what they contained and
could not identify the contents, but she could tell at a glance that none of them
contained any ginseng. She sent someone to Xi-feng’s room to ask if Xi-feng had got
any herself. Xi-feng came over to reply.
‘I’ve only got extract of ginseng,’ she said. ‘Actually I have got a few dried leaves and
whiskers, but they are not of good quality and I use them every day in my infusions.’
Lady Wang was obliged to ask Lady Xing; but she, too, was unable to oblige.
Lady Wang was now reduced to going round in person to Grandmother Jia and
begging some from her. Grandmother Jia at once asked Faithful to get out whatever
remained of her own supply. Fortunately there was still a large packetful. The roots
were of various sizes, but mostly about the thickness of a finger. Faithful weighed out
two ounces and gave them to Lady Wang, who carried them back to her own
apartment and there handed them over to Zhou Rui’s wife, together with the packets
of unidentified herbs, instructing her to get one of the pages to carry them to the
doctor. While he was about it, she said, he could determine what the herbs were and
write their names on the packets.
When Zhou Rui’s wife reappeared some time later, she was carrying not only the
packets of herbs but also the ginseng.
‘He’s written the names on the packets,’ she said. ‘But this ginseng - he says it’s
very high quality ginseng, but it’s too old. He says ginseng isn’t like other medicines:
no matter how good it is, after a hundred years or so it turns into dust. This ginseng
here hasn’t turned into dust yet, but he says it’s already dried-up, like rotten wood.
It’s got no goodness in it. He told me to bring it back. He said tell Her Ladyship to try
and get hold of some a bit fresher than this. It doesn’t matter about the roots being a
bit on the thin side as long as it’s fresh.’
Lady Wang bowed her head and thought for some moments in silence.
‘I suppose there’s nothing else for it. We shall just have to buy two ounces. - Take
this stuff away!’ she said, feeling no inclination to examine the packets. One of the
maids removed them while she continued with her instructions to Zhou Rui’s wife.
‘Tell our buyer to pick out ginseng of the very best quality. He is to get it as cheaply as
he can, of course, but it must be high quality ginseng. Oh, and if Lady Jia should ask
any of you about this, tell her that we used the ginseng she gave us. Don’t go
prattling to her about what the doctor said.’
Zhou Rui’s wife was about to go off on her errand when Bao-chai, who happened to
be sitting in the room, smilingly intervened.
‘Just a minute, Aunt. There is really no good ginseng to be had in the shops
nowadays. If the dealers ever get hold of a whole root, they cut it into two or three
sections which they carve into shape and graft crowns and rootlets onto so that they
can make more money by passing off each section as a whole root. Our firm has
quite a lot to do with the ginseng suppliers. If I had a word with Mamma about this, I
am sure Pan could arrange for one of our people to get two ounces of whole, uncut
root from the suppliers. It might cost rather a lot, but at least you could be sure that
you were getting ginseng of the very highest quality.’
‘You are so knowledgeable!’ said Lady Wang gratefully. ‘Would you do that then? I
am sure it would be better for the request to come from you.’
Bao-chai left immediately and was gone for a long time.
‘He’s sent someone to see about it,’ she said when she got back. ‘We shall have a
reply by this evening. That means that we ought to be able to get the stuff first thing
tomorrow. That isn’t too long to wait, is it?’
Lady Wang was delighted, though her comment was a somewhat rueful one.
‘We have always kept a supply of ginseng in the past, and we have given I don’t
know how much away to other people; but now that we want some ourselves, we
have to run around looking for it elsewhere.’
She sighed.
‘Although ginseng is so costly, it is only a medicine,’ said Bao-chai consolingly. ‘As
such it ought to be given away to others, so that its benefit may be spread as widely
as possible. People in our position cannot behave like ill-bred parvenus who hoard
their ginseng like an heirloom and can only under the most exceptional
circumstances be induced to part with any.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘Yes, I suppose you are right.’
A little later, after Bao-chai had gone and there was no one else with her in the room,
Lady Wang called Zhou Rui’s wife over to ask about another matter.
‘When you made that search in the Garden the other day, did you find what you
were looking for?’
Zhou Rui’s wife had already consulted Xi-feng about what Lady Wang should be told
and Xi-feng had insisted that there should be no concealment; she therefore told her
everything. Lady Wang was deeply shocked. When she had somewhat recovered
from her surprise and begun thinking what to do, it occurred to her that, as Chess
was Ying-chun’s maid and therefore really a member of Lady Xing’s establishment, it
would first be necessary to acquaint Lady Xing with the facts before proceeding any
further. Zhou Rui’s wife had her own ideas on the subject.
‘Lady Xing was so angry with Wang Shan-bao’s wife for meddling that she boxed
her ears and Wang Shan-bao’s wife has kept at home ever since, pretending to be ill.
She certainly won’t have spoken to Lady Xing about this matter because Chess is her
own daughter’s child and it would be like slapping her own face if she did so. I expect
she’s pretending to have forgotten all about it and is just waiting for the whole affair
to blow over. If I report it, Lady Xing will like as not take umbrage and say that I am
interfering. It would be best simply to take Chess and the things we found along to
her and let her work it all out for herself. Probably she’ll give Chess a beating and
have her married to one of the boys and pick another maid for Miss Ying and that will
be the end of the matter. But if I just go along and tell her, without taking Chess or
the things, she’ll probably think up some excuse for doing nothing. “If your mistress
has found this out,” she’ll say, “why doesn’t she deal with it herself? Why do you
come here asking me about it?” That way it will get put off. Then suppose when no
one is looking the girl finds some means of doing away with herself? We shall have a
fine to-do on our hands! She’s already been under guard now for two or three days.
If we don’t do something about her soon, we shall be simply asking for trouble.’
Lady Wang reflected for some moments.
‘Yes, you are right,’ she said at last. ‘Do as you have suggested straight away then,
and after that we will deal with our own young harpies.’
Now that she had her commission, Zhou Rui’s wife got together several of the other
women and took them with her to Ying-chun’s apartment. Ying-chun listened with
tears in her eyes while Zhou Rui’s wife explained what she had come about, and it
was evident that the idea of parting with Chess distressed her; on the other hand, as
she had now heard something about the raid from the other maids and knew that
this matter was connected in some way with morality, she felt that however painful
the parting might be, there was probably nothing she could do to prevent it. Chess
was unaware of this. She had pleaded with Ying-chun the morning after the discovery
and was convinced that Ying-chun could save her if she had a mind to. It could only
be her habitual reluctance to speak out, her usual weak irresolution, that now kept
her silent. When it became clear that her mistress was determined to say nothing
and that there was to be no escape for her, Chess fell down on her knees and
reproached her tearfully.
‘You have a cruel heart, miss! All through these last few days you have allowed me
to go on hoping, but now, when the time comes, you won’t say a single word to help
me!’
‘You surely don’t expect Miss Ying to keep you?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife indignantly.
‘Even if she did, what would all the other people in the Garden say? And how would
you be able to look them in the face after what you have done? Take my advice: the
best thing you can do is to pack your things up and get out of here as quickly as
possible, before anyone else has had a chance of finding out what you have been up
to.’
‘I know that you have done something serious,’ said Ying-?chun tearfully. ‘If I speak
up for you or try to keep you, it will be all up with me too. Apart from that, look how
quickly they got rid of Picture, in spite of all the years she had served Miss Xi: just
“Out!” and out she went. I don’t think it will stop at you and Picture. I think they
must be planning to get rid of all the older girls in the Garden. We are all going to be
separated sooner or later. If you ask me, I think you and I might just as well part now
as any other time.’
‘There, you see?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘Miss Ying understands. There’ll be plenty of
others dismissed after you have gone, don’t you worry!’
Since there was to be no respite, Chess, struggling to hold back her tears, made a last
kotow to her mistress and said good-bye to the other maids. As she was leaving, she
leaned forwards and whispered in Ying-chun’s ear:
‘Try and find out what’s happening to me, miss. Put in a good word for me if you
hear I’m suffering.’
‘Of course I will,’ said Ying-chun. There were tears in her own eyes as she said it.
Those were the last words spoken before Zhou Rui’s wife and the other women took
Chess away. Two old women accompanied them carrying her things. They had gone
no more than a few steps out of the courtyard gate when little Tangerine came
running after them and handed Chess a silk purse, while with the other hand she
wiped her streaming eyes.
‘This is from the mistress. She says it’s hard to lose you after all the years you and
she have been together and she wants you to have this to remember her by.’
As she received the purse, Chess was unable to restrain a further outburst of tears,
and for some moments she and Tangerine clung together weeping, until Zhou Rui’s
wife, growing impatient, began hustling Chess on her way, forcing the two girls apart.
Chess spoke to the women imploringly:
‘For charity’s sake, couldn’t you turn a blind eye just for a few minutes while I say
good-bye to the maids in the other apartments? Some of the older ones I have
known so long, they have become almost like sisters to me.’
Zhou Rui’s wife and the other women all had work of their own to do which they had
left unwillingly and were anxious to get back to; moreover all of them deeply
resented the overbearing manner which Chess and the other senior maids had
adopted towards them in the past; there was therefore little chance of their being
moved by her plea.
‘If I were you I should stop all this shilly-shallying and be on your way,’ said Zhou
Rui’s wife coldly. ‘We’ve got more important things to do than sit around waiting
while you say your good-byes. In any case, they’re not your real sisters, so what’s the
point of seeing them? It’s only playing for time. You’ve got to leave in the end,
however long you delay. You might just as well get it over with now, as quickly as
possible.’
She hurried on towards the rear corner gate of the Garden. The hapless Chess, not
daring to say another word, had to follow her out of it.
By coincidence, just as they were coming out of the Garden, they ran into Bao-yu
who was returning to it from outside. Seeing Chess in the company of this grim
escort and with the two older women behind her carrying a lot of things, he realized
that she must be leaving the Garden for good. He had heard something now about
the raid and had noticed that Skybright’s sickness had grown more serious since her
interview with his mother (though he could not induce her to say why). The
realization that he was witnessing Chess’s dismissal came as all the greater shock in
the light of these other happenings. He stepped forwards impetuously and barred
their way.
‘Where are you going?’
Zhou Rui’s wife knew Bao-yu from of old and greatly feared that they were now to be
held up indefinitely with a lot of pointless chatter.
‘It’s nothing to do with you,’ she said, smiling grimly. ‘You get back to your books!’
‘Just stop a moment, there’s a good woman,’ said Bao-yu appealingly, just long
enough to hear what I’ve got to say.’
‘Her Ladyship told us we were under no circumstances to delay,’ said Zhou Rui’s
wife. ‘There’s nothing to be said. We’ve got our orders from Her Ladyship, that’s all
we’re concerned about.’
Chess clung to Bao-yu and wept.
‘There’s nothing they can do. If you want to save me, you’ll have to speak to Her
Ladyship.’
Bao-yu was deeply upset. His eyes filled with tears.
‘I don’t know what terrible thing you are supposed to have done,’ he said, ‘but I
know that something has upset Skybright and made her ill, and now you are going.
What on earth is happening?’
Zhou Rui’s wife turned on Chess angrily.
‘You’re not a lady’s maid now, you know. Now if you don’t do what I tell you, I have
the right to beat you, just like any other servant. You can’t play fast and loose with us
now and then run to your mistress to save you from the consequences. I’ve told you
a number of times to be on your way, but you take no notice. A maid holding on to a
young master - whoever heard of such a thing!’
At this the other women laid violent hands on Chess and hurried her away. Bao-yu,
fearing that if he said anything it would only make matters worse, glared at them in
silence; but he could not resist pointing his linger at them when they had gone and -
sotto voce - giving bitter vent to his feelings:
‘Strange, the way they get like this when they marry! It must be something in the
male that infects them. If anything they end up even worse than the men!’
The old women on duty at the gate overheard this and could not help laughing at
him.
‘In that case all girls must be good and all women must be bad,’ they said. ‘You
don’t really believe that, do you?’
‘Indeed I do,’ said Bao-yu feelingly. ‘That’s precisely what I do believe.’
Just at that moment some other old women came hurrying up to them.
‘Make sure you’re all here in case Her Ladyship wants you,’ said one of them. ‘She’s
in the Garden now, making an inspection. And someone go and get Skybright’s
cousin and his wife, so that they’ll be ready to take her away presently.’ She chuckled.
‘Holy Name! The Lord has opened his eyes at last! With that little pest out of the way,
it will be a better place for all of us!’
At the old woman’s mention of his mother’s presence, Bao?-yu, fearing that it might
bode ill for Skybright, had rushed off immediately, so that he had missed the gloating
remark which followed it. When he arrived at Green Delights, he found a small crowd
of women waiting outside the door. His mother was sitting inside the room with
anger written all over her face. She deliberately ignored him as he entered. Skybright,
who had taken no nourishment of any kind for the past four or five days and was in
too weak a state to get up, had been dragged from the kang and now stood facing
her, propped up between two women. Her hair was in disarray and her face looked
as if it needed washing.
‘Throw out the clothes she has been wearing,’ Lady Wang was saying. ‘She can take
them with her. The rest can be kept here and given to more deserving maids to wear.’
Having finished with Skybright, she ordered all the other maids to be called in, from
Aroma down to the most junior maid-of-all-work, to be subjected to her scrutiny.
Each and every one of them was in Lady Wang’s opinion a potential corrupter of her
boy.
‘Which is the one whose birthday is on the same day as Bao-yu’s?’ she asked.
Since the girl herself would not answer, one of the old women pointed her out.
‘This is the one, Your Ladyship: Citronella. She’s called “Number Four”. She’s the
one whose birthday is on the same day as Bao-yu’s.’
Lady Wang examined the girl closely. Although not half as good-looking as Skybright,
she had a certain gracefulness about her, and intelligence shone out in her every
feature. She was moreover better dressed than the other maids. Lady Wang sniffed
scornfully.
‘Another shameless young baggage! This is the one who said that those with the
same birthday are destined to be husband and wife. You did say that, didn’t you? You
think that because I live away from here I don’t know these things; but though I may
not come here often myself, I have my eyes and ears here, watching you and listening
to you all the time. Do you imagine that I would willingly allow my only son to be
corrupted by creatures like you?’
Number Four reddened, hearing from Lady Wang’s own lips the words she once said
to Bao-yu in private. It was useless to deny that she had said them. She hung her
head and wept.
‘Tell her people to come and take her away,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She can be paired off
with one of the boys.’
Exit Number Four.
Now which is the one with the foreign name?’ said Lady Wang.
Parfumée-Aventurin stepped forward.
Oh, it is you. One expects an actress to be a vampire, but one had hoped, after you
turned down the opportunity to go free and insisted on staying here, that you would
make some effort to behave. Instead, it seems, you have turned your attentions on
my son and been encouraging him to get up to I don’t know what sorts of mischief.’
Parfumée smiled.
‘I haven’t encouraged him to get up to anything.’
Lady Wang smiled back at her.
‘You would argue with me, would you? I suppose it is hardly surprising, considering
the way you treated your own foster-mother while I was away. - Call her
foster-mother!’ she ordered. ‘I make her a present of this girl. She can marry her to
whomever she likes. And you can give her her things to take as well.’
Having thus disposed of Parfumée, she went on to give orders that none of the
remaining ex-actresses were to stay any longer in the Garden. Their foster-mothers
were to be summoned to collect them and allowed to dispose of them as they
wished. The delight and gratitude of these women when they received the message
can be imagined. They arranged among themselves to visit Lady Wang in a body and
kowtow their thanks to her before going into the Garden to collect the girls.
Lady Wang now proceeded to inspect Bao-yu’s things. Anything which looked at all
unfamiliar she had put on one side. The whole lot were then wrapped up in one big
bundle and carried to her own apartment.
‘Much better make a clean sweep of these things,’ she said. ‘There will be that
much less for people to gossip about.’
In conclusion she admonished Aroma and the remaining maids.
‘Now be careful! From now on if I hear of anything the slightest bit untoward
happening, I shall have no mercy! I can’t move you out yet, because there are still
investigations in progress, but next year I shall have the whole lot of you moved back
into the mansion, and then perhaps I shall be able to set my mind at rest.’
She went off at the head of her little troop of women, not even staying for a cup of
tea.
When Bao-yu heard from the old woman of his mother’s visit, he had expected
something unpleasant but of no great consequence: perhaps another inspection of
the maids’ possessions. He was therefore quite unprepared for the raging tempest
that had just passed over him. The things his mother had charged the maids with
showed so uncanny a knowledge of even his most intimate conversations with them
that there seemed little point in denial. He felt wretched enough to die, but it was
clear that even self-immolation could achieve nothing while his mother’s anger was
at its height. He therefore followed after her in silence, until he had seen her as far as
Drenched Blossoms Pavilion half-way across the bridge, when she peremptorily
ordered him to return.
‘Go back - and get on with your studies! Then next time your father asks you about
them, you will at least be able to say that you have made a start.’
Bao-yu turned back. All the way back to Green Delights he was thinking to himself:
‘Who’s been blabbing? No one outside knows about these things. How did Mother
get to hear about them?’
The question was continuing to trouble him when he entered his room. He noticed
that Aroma was in tears.
‘Well, she would be if any of the senior maids was leaving,’ he thought. ‘It’s only
natural.’
He flung himself down on the bed and broke into loud sobs. Aroma tried to talk him
out of his despair. She knew that, whatever might become of anyone else, it was
Skybright that he was chiefly concerned about.
‘Oh, do get up!’ she said. ‘What’s the use of crying? I tell you, Skybright will be
better off where she is going. Back at home she will at least be able to have a few
days to herself in peace and quiet. And if you really can’t bear to be without her, you
have only to wait until Her Ladyship’s anger has cooled down a bit and then go and
ask Her Old Ladyship to have her brought back again. It shouldn’t be difficult. Her
Ladyship was acting in anger. Probably she had heard someone gossiping about her.’
‘But what heinous crime is Skybright supposed to have committed?’ said Bao-yu.
‘Maybe she isn’t,’ said Aroma. ‘Maybe Her Ladyship just thinks she is too
good-looking. She probably thinks that anyone who is so good-looking must be
unreliable. She knows these very beautiful young women are often trouble-makers.
Probably she dislikes Skybright just for being beautiful. It’s better to be a plain, gawky
person like me!’
‘Who said that beautiful women are trouble-makers?’ said Bao-yu. ‘There have
always been lots and lots of beautiful women who were nothing of the kind. But
never mind all that. What I can’t understand is, how did Mother get to hear about all
those private jokes of ours? No one outside could have told her. It’s very, very
strange.’
‘Look how careless you are,’ said Aroma. ‘Once you get a bit excited you are
capable of saying anything, regardless of who else is around. Many and many’s the
time I have given you a look or made some sign to warn you, but you never notice.’
‘Maybe,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but tell me this. How is it that she’d heard something
damaging about every single person in this apartment except you and Musk and
Ripple?’
Somewhat taken aback by this question, Aroma hung her head and pondered it for
some moments, but she was unable to think of an explanation. She laughed
embarrassedly.
‘I agree, it is rather strange. We three must often have made careless remarks that
could have been used against us. I wonder why Her Ladyship didn’t mention any?
Perhaps she’ll come back and deal with us three later.’
‘You?’ said Bao-yu, laughing incredulously. ‘The famous paragon of all the virtues?
There’s little danger of her finding fault with you. Or with those other two, whom you
trained and moulded in your own image. Parfumée I can understand: she is young
and precocious and inclined to use her intelligence for putting other people down, so
it’s hardly surprising that she should be disliked. Number Four’s unpopularity I blame
myself for. It dates from that time when you and I had quarrelled about something
and I allowed her to wait on me in your place. The others must have resented my
giving her special treatment, and that, ultimately, must be the reason for what has
happened to her today. But why Skybright? You and she started together with my
grandmother when you were little girls. It’s true she is a bit better-looking than the
rest of you, but she has never taken advantage of that fact: no one has ever been
made to feel threatened by it. Even her forthrightness - and she could be quite
sharp-tongued on occasion - has never, as far as I am aware, given serious offence. I
suppose it must be as you say: her good looks have been her undoing.’
He concluded by once more bursting into tears.
Mulling over what he had just said, Aroma concluded that it could only mean that he
suspected her. There seemed little point in protesting. She sighed.
‘There’s One above who knows the truth of the matter; but I don’t suppose we
shall find out who it was for a while yet. At all events, crying isn’t going to help. Much
better keep your spirits up and next time Her Old Ladyship is feeling cheerful, explain
what has happened and ask to have Skybright back again.’
‘You only say that to humour me,’ said Bao-yu bitterly. ‘According to you I am to
wait until Mother’s anger has subsided and after that wait until a favourable
opportunity arises for talking to Grandmother; but what makes you think that
Skybright’s illness will wait that long? Ever since she came into our family as a child
she has lived comfortably. She has never had to experience a single day of real
hardship. Sending her to that place now is like taking a potted orchid that has just
started putting out its first tender spears of growth and setting it down in a pigsty.
Apart from being physically ill, she must be in a terrible state mentally as well. And
she has no kind parents to look after her, don’t forget: only that worthless cousin and
his wife. I doubt she’ll last there a fortnight. I may not even be able to see her again.’
‘Curfew for the common people, but the Prefect can light a fire,’ said Aroma drily.
‘What a fuss you’d have made if I’d said anything so unlucky! How can you bear to
talk so glibly about her dying?’
‘It isn’t unlucky to talk about what has already been foretold,’ said Bao-yu. ‘There
was a portent of her coming death last spring.’
‘Oh?’ said Aroma in some surprise. ‘What was that?’
‘The crab-apple tree in the courtyard here: only one half of it budded this year; the
other side seems to have died. I knew at the time that something awful must be
going to happen; now I can see that it must have been a portent of her death.’
Aroma laughed out loud.
‘Forgive me, but I just can’t help myself. You really are an old woman! And you
supposed to be so educated! How can what happens to trees and plants have
anything to do with human beings?’
Bao-yu sighed.
‘What do you know about it? Not only plants and trees, but all things that live and
grow have feelings. And like us, they are most responsive to those who most
appreciate them. There are plenty of examples from history: the juniper tree in front
of the temple of Confucius, the milfoil that grows beside his tomb, the cypress in
front of Zhu-ge Liang’s shrine, the pine-tree that grows in front of Yue Fei’s grave: all
those paragons of the vegetable world, mightily endowed with vital essence and able
to withstand the ravages of the centuries, have withered and dried up in times of
disorder, only to flourish once more when times were prosperous. In the course of a
thousand or more years all of them have died and come to life again several times
over. If those are not portents, what are they? On a somewhat less exalted level
there are the peonies beside Yang Gui-fei’s Aloeswood Pavilion, the rhododendrons
of the Duan-cheng-lou and the evergreen grass on Lady Bright’s grave. Surely you
can’t deny that all these are instances of sympathy between plants and humans? I
see no reason to doubt that our crab-apple tree too was reacting to a human
situation.’
By the time his idiotic discourse had ended, Aroma did not know whether to laugh or
groan.
‘You really make me angry,’ she said, ‘comparing Skybright with all those famous
people! What sort of creature do you think she is anyway? And even if she is so
wonderful, you seem to forget that I have precedence over her among your maids. If
the crab-apple is connected with any of us, it ought to be me. It must mean that I am
going to die.’
Bao-yu clapped his hand over her mouth.
‘Now, now, that’s enough of that! I’m already worried enough about her as it is, I
don’t want to have to worry about you as well. Let’s say no more about it. Three
people is quite enough to lose in one day!’
Aroma was secretly glad to hear him say this.
‘If I hadn’t said that to stop him,’ she thought, ‘heaven knows where this nonsense
would have ended!’
‘There’s something else I want to discuss with you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m not quite sure
whether you’ll agree to this or not. Couldn’t we somehow, without letting any of the
family know about it, contrive to let her have her things? Perhaps we could also send
her a few strings of whatever money we have managed to save, so that she has got
something to buy medicines with. Could you, for the sake of all your years together,
do this for her?’
Aroma laughed.
‘Do you really think I need asking? What a mean, inhuman sort of person you must
think I am! I’ve got her clothes and all her other things piled up over there, ready to
send her. I can’t send them now, in broad daylight. With so many prying eyes about it
would be simply asking for trouble. But as soon as it’s evening I shall get Mrs Liu to
take them to her. I’ve got several strings of cash that she can take to her as well.’
Bao-yu nodded.
‘I am a paragon of all the virtues, don’t forget,’ said Aroma teasingly. ‘It’s worth
spending a bit of money to keep up my reputation!’
Bao-yu smiled and said a few words to comfort her. He was afraid that she might
have taken what he said earlier to heart.
That evening, when things had quietened down a bit, he slipped out on his own to
the rear corner gate of the Garden and begged one of the old women there to take
him to Skybright’s house. At first she refused absolutely to help. She was too scared,
she said. What would become of her rice-bowl if Lady Wang got to hear of it? In the
end, after he had pleaded with her very insistently and also promised her some
money, she agreed to take him.
*
Skybright was in the first instance purchased, when she was barely ten years old, by
the Chief Steward Lai Da as a little slave-girl for his wife, who often took Skybright
with her when she went to work in Rong-guo House. It was in this way that she first
came to the attention of Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia took a great fancy to the
beautiful, intelligent little girl, and when Lai Da’s wife noticed this, she gave Skybright
to the old lady as a present. It was because the old lady thought so highly of
Skybright that she later on gave her as a maidservant to her beloved grandson.
Skybright had no recollection of her parents or of the place where she was born. The
only relation she knew of was a cousin somewhat older than herself, said to be her
father’s sister’s son, who was in bondservice elsewhere. After her instalment at the
mansion she begged Lai Da’s wife to have this cousin purchased too and find him
some employment with the Jias. The stewardess was touched by the gratitude and
respect that Skybright continued to show her after her advancement. At her
insistence Lai Da purchased the cousin, gave him a small job as a buyer, and even
provided him with a wife.
Unfortunately Skybright’s cousin was a timorous, poor-spirited creature, whereas the
wife Lai Da had chosen for him was a lively and rather attractive young woman.
Finding her husband unable to provide her with what she wanted, she soon took to
going out every day, dressed up to the nines, to exercise her charms on the other
servants. She was aided in this by a highly expressive pair of eyes which seldom failed
to convey their message. The men were drawn towards her irresistibly, like flies
towards carrion, so that there was seldom any lack of volunteers to fill the gap left by
her neglectful husband.
The couple lived in an apartment not far from the rear side gate of the Garden, and it
was to this place that Skybright was taken after her dismissal. The cousin’s young
wife had little stomach for nursing a sick relation, and as soon as she had eaten, was
off on her customary rounds, leaving Skybright alone and untended in the outer
room.
When Bao-yu arrived at the house, he told the old woman who had brought him to
wait at the gate and keep a look-out while he went inside. Raising the cotton
door-curtain he looked into the room. He could see Skybright at once, lying on an old
rush mat on the kang (fortunately she still had her own bedding) but no one else
appeared to be at home, and he wondered for a moment what he should do; then,
going over to the kang, he plucked timidly at the quilt in which she was wrapped and
gently called her name. His eyes were full of tears.
Skybright, who had been ill to start with, had been made even more so by the
detestable things said to her by her cousin and his wife since her arrival. After
coughing through most of the day, she had recently dozed off into a fitful sleep, and
it was not until Bao-yu had called her name for the second time that she opened her
eyes. What surprise, delight, sorrow, anguish all mixed in one when she saw who it
was! She gripped his hand tightly in hers, but for a long time she could only sob. At
last she managed to speak.
‘I didn’t think I should ever see you again.’
After that she coughed and coughed. Bao-yu was sobbing now himself.
‘Holy Name, it’s a good job you’ve come!’ she said. ‘Could you get me half a cup of
tea? I’m so thirsty, but though I’ve called and called, no one ever comes.’
Bao-yu hurriedly wiped his eyes.
‘Where’s the tea?’
‘It’s over there on the stove,’ said Skybright.
Bao-yu looked at the brick-and-mud-built stove against the wall. There was only a
sort of blackened earthenware skillet on it that bore no resemblance to a tea-pot. He
found a teacup on the table whose greasy, rancid odour reached his nostrils even
before he picked it up. Having located some water, he washed it twice, rinsed it twice,
dried it with his handkerchief, sniffed it (it still smelt) and half filled it with a dusky,
reddish liquid from the skillet. Was it tea? He tasted it dubiously. It had a bitter, acrid
taste with only a slight suggestion of tea about it.
‘That’s tea,’ said Skybright, who had raised herself on the pillow. ‘Please let me
have it. You can’t expect it to be as good as ours.’
Bao-yu handed it to her and she gulped it down greedily as if it were the most
delicious nectar. He watched her with tears running down his cheeks, suddenly
ashamed of his own fastidiousness.
‘If there’s anything you want to tell me,’ he said, ‘you’d better tell me now, while
there’s nobody else about.’
‘What have I got to tell?’ said Skybright. ‘I’m living now from day to day and from
hour to hour. I know I’m done for: it can’t be more than four or five days now at the
most. If it weren’t for one thing, I could die content. I know I’m a bit better-looking
than the others, but I’ve never tried to make up to you. Why will they insist that I am
some sort of vam?pire? It’s so unfair. And now I have so little time left. I ought not to
say this, but if I’d known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved
rather differently.’
She began to cry again.
Bao-yu took her hands in his own. They felt like bundles of dried twigs, so wasted had
she become. She was still wearing a pair of silver bangles on either wrist.
‘Better take these off,’ he said (he was crying himself as he spoke). ‘You can put
them on again when you are better.’
He took them off for her and put them under the pillow.
‘It’s a pity about these nails,’ he said. ‘It took you such a long time to grow them. By
the time you are better, I expect you’ll find that quite a lot of them will have broken
off.’
She wiped her eyes, curled the third and fourth fingers of her left hand back against
the side of her mouth and with a supreme effort half bit half tore off the two
two-inch lengths of scallion-like nail that projected from them.
‘Here!’ She put the pieces into his hand. ‘To remind you of me.’
Then she reached down inside the bedding and managed, after a great deal of
struggling, to take off the old red chemise she was wearing and hold it out to him.
Because of her weakness, the effort of doing this made her pant so much that she
could not speak; but Bao-yu understood what she wanted. He removed his outer
garment, took off the shirt he was wearing underneath it and laid it over her, and put
on the chemise she was holding out to him. He did not bother to do the buttons up,
since it would be hidden anyway beneath his outer garment. While he was fastening
his belt on again, he noticed that she was staring at him, trying to say some?thing.
‘Help me up!’
Even with Bao-yu’s assistance it cost her a good deal of effort to sit fully upright.
Once she was sitting up, she stretched one of her arms out and tried drawing the
shirt on herself. Bao-yu draped it over her shoulders and eased each of her arms in
turn into the sleeves, then gently laid her down again.
‘If anyone sees that when you get back and asks you whose it is,’ said Skybright,
weeping, ‘there’s no need to tell them any lies. Tell them it’s mine. Since I’ve got such
a bad reputation anyway, I might as well have something to show for it when I’m
gone!’
At that moment the door-curtain was lifted and the cousin’s wife came into the room,
all dazzling smiles.
‘Very nice! I’ve heard all that you two have been saying.’ She directed a bold look at
Bao-yu. ‘And what are you doing, a young master like you, coming to see us servants
in our quarters? Bet you heard I was young and good-looking and came here to flirt
with me!’
‘Please, I beg of you, don’t speak so loud!’ said Bao-yu entreatingly. ‘I shouldn’t
really be here, but your cousin was with me for many years: I came here to see her
because she is ill.’
The young woman smiled and nodded approvingly.
‘That’s right. They say you have a good heart.’
She took him by the hand and pulled him after her into the inner room.
‘If you don’t want me to make a noise, you can easily stop me. You have only to do
one little thing.’
She got her backside up onto the kang and drawing him down on top of her, put up
her legs and gripped him tightly between them. This was something totally outside
Bao-yu’s experience. His heart started pounding wildly, his face turned scarlet, and
his whole body began to tremble. It would have been hard to say what feeling was at
that moment uppermost in his mind: embarrassment, shame, fear or annoyance. All
he could manage to say was:
‘Don’t fool about, please!’
The young woman leered up at him through half-closed eyes.
‘Get away with you! From what I’ve been told, you’ve had plenty of practice with
other girls. What makes you so bashful today all of a sudden?’
Bao-yu became even redder.
‘Please let me go. If you’ve got anything to talk about, let’s discuss it like
reasonable human beings. There’s an old woman outside there listening. What do
you think you are doing?’
‘There’s no old woman out there,’ she said. ‘I saw her when I got back and told her
to wait for you at the Garden gate. Come on! I’ve waited a long time to get my hands
on you. If you won’t do what I ask, I’ll call out. You’re a bold one, aren’t you, coming
here! What will Her Ladyship say if she finds out? I was listening to you two outside
the window for quite a while. From what I could make out, you and she have nothing
between you. Well, more fool she, if that’s the case! You needn’t expect me to be so
daft!’
She began to get to work on his clothing, while Bao-yu made frantic efforts to pull
himself away. They were still struggling when a voice was heard outside the window
asking for Skybright. The young woman gave a start and let go of Bao-yu. Bao-yu was
so shaken and confused that he had not heard the voice, and Skybright, listening to
what was going on in the next room, was so overcome with shame and anger that
she had fainted clean away. This left only the cousin’s wife to answer the caller - or
rather callers, for when she went outside to look, it turned out to be Cook Liu and
Fivey with a bundle containing Skybright’s things. Cook Liu was also holding several
strings of cash.
‘We’ve brought these from Miss Aroma for your young lady,’ she said. ‘Which room
is she in?’
The young woman laughed.
‘This room here. Where else would we keep her?’
As Cook Liu and Fivey went into the outer room, a lurking figure dodged into the
inner room at the back. Cook Liu knew something of the young wife’s reputation and
assumed that it must be one of her lovers. Since Skybright appeared to be asleep, she
put the things down beside her and hurried out again. But Fivey had sharper eyes
than her mother and had recognized the lurking figure as Bao-yu.
‘Didn’t Miss Aroma say when we were leaving that she’d been looking for Master
Bao?’ she asked her mother.
‘Goodness, I nearly forgot!’ said Cook Liu. ‘Mrs Song told me just now that she
thought she’d seen him go out of the side gate. And there was someone waiting for
him outside the gate too, wasn’t there? They’ll be wanting to close presently.’
She turned back and asked the young woman if she had seen him.
‘No,’ said the cousin’s wife, beginning to feel nervous. ‘What would Master Bao be
doing at our house?’
Hearing her say this, Cook Liu began to go again; but Bao-yu, partly because he was
afraid of being shut out of the Garden and partly because he feared that the cousin’s
wife might return to the attack if he remained after the visitors had gone, threw
discretion to the winds and, lifting up the door-curtain, came rushing out after them.
‘Mrs Liu! Wait for me! We’ll go back together!’
Cook Liu was mightily astonished.
‘My dear young master! Whatever has brought you to this place?’
Bao-yu sped on ahead without replying.
‘Call him back, Ma!’ said Fivey. ‘Tell him not to be in so much of a hurry. He’ll run
into someone if he’s not careful and they’ll find out what he’s been up to. There’s no
need for him to hurry in any case. That person we saw waiting for him will see to it
that the gate’s kept open for him.’
She and her mother ran after Bao-yu to try and catch up with him. The cousin’s wife
stared after them disconsolately: her beautiful young gentleman had got away.
Bao-yu did not stop running until he was inside the Garden gate. Only then did he
feel safe again, though his heart was still beating wildly. Fortunately no one appeared
to have noticed his absence, and when he got back to Green Delights he managed to
put Aroma off by saying that he had been visiting Aunt Xue.
Shortly after this, as she was making up his bed, Aroma asked him how they should
sleep.
‘Oh, anyhow,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I don’t mind.’
It should be explained that during the year or two that had elapsed since her
unofficial promotion by Lady Wang, Aroma had been taking herself very seriously
and no longer, either at night or when they were alone together in the daytime,
permitted herself those affectionate intimacies that had been customary between
her and Bao-yu in the past. A slight distance seemed to have grown up between
them since their younger, more carefree days. Partly it was being so much busier that
kept her from him: for although the most impor?tant matters remained outside her
control, it was she who organized the sewing and other maid’s-work, took care of
Bao-yu’s and the junior maids’ pocket-money for them, attended to their clothing
and other equipment, and assumed responsibility for the general maintenance of the
apartment. Partly it was because she had a fear of infecting him: for she still
continued, though very infrequently, to cough blood.
     It was mainly for this last reason that she had for some time now ceased
sleeping in the same room. But Bao-yu was nervous at night and liked to have
someone near at hand whom he could call to when he woke up. Because she knew
that Skybright was a light sleeper, Aroma entrusted all the night-time duties, like
answering him when he called, getting up and making tea for him and so forth, to her,
so that it had long since been the custom for Skybright to sleep in the same room
with him beside his bed. Now that Skybright was no longer with him, Aroma made
her own bed up beside Bao-yu’s in Skybright’s place.
   Observing the somewhat dazed manner in which Bao-yu was conducting himself
that evening, Aroma urged him to go to bed early, and as soon as she had got him
settled, went to bed herself. But he seemed very restless. As she lay in her own bed
she could hear him sighing and muttering to himself in his. This went on until well
after midnight. Only then did he fall silent and appeared to have gone to sleep.
Relieved, Aroma began drifting off herself. But only for a moment. Before she had a
chance to get fully off to sleep, she heard him call out:
‘Skybright!’
‘What is it?’ said Aroma, instantly alert again.
Bao-yu said that he wanted some tea, so she got up and poured him out a cup. He
sighed as she handed it to him.
     ‘I’m so used to calling her, I forgot that it was you.’ Aroma laughed.
     ‘The first night she slept with you, you were calling out in your sleep for me. It
took you a while then to get used to the change.’
     They both lay down again. Again Bao-yu was restless and continued so for the
space of about two hours. It must have been four o’clock before he finally got to
sleep. Just as he was dropping off, Skybright walked into the room looking exactly as
she used to do before she was ill. She came right up to the bed and spoke to him.
‘Enjoy your lives, all of you! Mine is already over.’
      Immediately she had said that, she turned round and walked out again. Bao-yu
called out after her. His calling awoke Aroma, who assumed that he was once more
calling Skybright’s name instead of her own from force of habit. But when she went
over to ask him what he wanted, she saw that he was crying.
      ‘Skybright’s dead,’ he said.
      Aroma laughed.
      ‘Don’t be ridiculous! Whatever would anyone think if they heard you say such a
thing?’
      Nevertheless Bao-yu insisted that Skybright was dead and waited impatiently for
the daylight when he could send someone to find out the circumstances of her death.
But daylight brought a little maid knocking at the front corner gate of the Garden
with a message from Lady Wang.
      ‘You must tell Bao-yu to get up immediately and come over to Her Ladyship’s as
soon as he is washed and dressed. The Master is invited out to a
chrysanthemum-viewing, and because he was so pleased with the poem Bao-yu
made at the party the other night, he wants to take him and the other young masters
with him. Have you got that message? Be as quick as you can, please. And tell him to
hurry. The Master is in the main room with Her Ladyship. They are waiting for Bao-yu
to come so that they can start their breakfast. Master Huan is there already, so be
quick. And someone take the same message to Master Lan, please.’
     ‘Yes, yes,’ said the women, hurriedly buttoning up their clothing, and two of
them hurried off to deliver it, one to Green Delights and the other to Sweet-rice
Village.
Aroma knew that something unusual must be toward for someone to be knocking so
early at the courtyard gate and called to one of the old women to go and find out
what it was while she herself got up and put her clothes on. When she heard the
message, she sent someone out for washing-water and roused up Bao-yu. She told
him to wash himself as quickly as possible while she went to fetch him some clothes.
Since it was Jia Zheng he was going out with, she chose his second best, judging his
best to be too showy.

    As there was now obviously no possibility of following out his original intention,
Bao-yu washed and dressed and hurried over to his parents’ apartment immediately.
When he got there be found Jia Zheng already sipping his wheatmeal tea and
apparently in very good humour. Bao-yu made his morning salutation to his parents
after which he in turn was greeted by Jia Huan and Jia Lan. Jia Zheng ordered the
three of them to sit down and drink their wheatmeal tea.
‘Bao-yu is not as diligent as you two in his schoolwork,’ he told the two younger
boys, ‘but he is much better than you at making up poems and couplets. No doubt all
three of you will be called upon to contribute poems at this place we are going to.
Bao-yu will have to help you out a bit.’
This was music indeed in the ears of Lady Wang, who had never before heard her
husband praise Bao-yu in such terms. She waited until Jia Zheng and the boys had
gone before getting up to make her morning call on Grandmother Jia; but before she
could get away, Parfumée foster-mother and two of the other foster-mothers came
in saying that there was something they wished to speak to her about.
‘Ever since Your Ladyship was good enough to let me take Parfumée home with
me,’ said Parfumée’s foster-mother, ‘she’s been refusing to eat and drink and
behaving like a crazy girl, and now Nénuphar and étamine are the same. The three of
them have been carrying on something dreadful, threaten?ing to kill themselves and
I don’t know what. All they want, they say, is to shave their hair off and become nuns.
Well, I thought, they’re only children; after a day or two they’ll get over this. But not
a bit of it: two days have gone by already and they’re worse than ever. Neither words
nor blows have an effect on them. We’re all at our wits’ end. We’ve come to ask Your
Ladyship if you will either let them have their way and go into a convent or else deal
with them as you see fit and hand them over to somebody else, because we can do
nothing with them.’
‘Nonsense!’ said Lady Wang impatiently. ‘It’s not for them to decide what is to
become of them. The Buddhist vocation is not to be undertaken on a mere childish
caprice. Give each of them a flogging and see if they misbehave then!’
It was the custom for nuns from the various temples which the Jia ladies patronized
to visit the mansion over the Mid?-Autumn festival bringing the first-fruits of their
offerings. Euergesia, the prioress of Water-moon Priory, who had come along with
the rest, had been invited to stay on for a few days and happened to be at hand
during this interview. This holy old fraud pricked her ears up when she heard of three
young persons wanting to become nuns. A few young novices to wait on her and help
about the priory were just what she was looking for. She set to work on Lady Wang
accordingly.
‘No doubt it is because this is such a blessed household (thanks to all Your
Ladyship’s good works) that these young people’s hearts have been turned towards
the faith,’ she said. ‘It is true that the Buddha’s gate is not to be entered lightly; but it
is also written that the Buddha’s truth is for all sorts and conditions of men. And not
only men, for when the Blessed Lord made his vow, it was to work for the salvation of
all sentient beings. These three young people have no parents and are far from the
place where they were born. Having had a taste of luxury during their years here with
you, yet being born to a lowly fate and trained in a profession that at best is vanity,
they cannot but tremble when they think what the future may hold for them. I
believe that is why, out of the midst of this sea of suffering, they have turned towards
the light and resolved to abjure the world and its vanities and prepare themselves for
the life to come. That is a noble decision, Your Ladyship. I don’t think you ought to
stand in the way of it.’
Lady Wang was a good woman at heart and had only opposed the young actresses’
determination to become nuns because she thought it proceeded from mere childish
waywardness and feared that when put to the test they would find the vows of
celibacy and abstinence too much for them and fall into mortal sin. But what the old
nun said sounded plausible; and besides, she was at this moment very much
preoccupied with other matters. Lady Xing had sent someone over to say that she
wanted Ying-chun to spend a few days with her so that she could be exhibited to the
representatives of a family seeking her in marriage, and Lady Wang herself was facing
a visit from an official match-maker who was coming to discuss the matrimonial
prospects of Tan-chun. She was far too worried by these other matters to be unduly
concerned about the fate of a few entertainers. The answer she gave Euergesia,
therefore, was a favourable one.
‘Very well then. Would you be prepared to take them as your disciples?’
‘Now blessings be upon you!’ said the old prioress. ‘It would be a holy thing if you
would let me, it would indeed. Praise his Holy Name!’
She pressed her palms together and bowed down almost to the ground.
Lady Wang turned to the three foster-mothers:
‘All right, go and ask them. If they are really serious about this, they can kotow to
Mother Euergesia in my presence and formally make themselves her disciples.’
The three women went off and presently reappeared, bringing the three girls with
them. Lady Wang questioned each of them closely about her decision and when she
was satisfied that they were utterly resolved to go through with it, allowed them to
make their kotows to the old nun. After that they kotowed to her. Now that she was
convinced of their determination and saw that nothing could deflect them from it,
she began to feel quite sorry for them and ordered the servants to get out various
things to give them. She also gave several presents to the prioress.
Thus Parfumée, Nénuphar and étamine left the sinful world behind them and went
off with Euergesia to embark on a new life at Water-moon Priory.
What followed thereafter will be related in the following chapter.
CHAPTER 78

Jia Zheng commissions the Ballad
Of the Winsome Colonel
And Bao-yu composes an Invocation
to the Hibiscus Spirit
After the departure of Euergesia and the three girls, Lady Wang was at last able to
make her morning call on Grandmother Jia. Finding the old lady in excellent humour,
she decided that this was as good a time as any to report on her recent activities.
‘There is a girl in Bao-yu’s room called Skybright,’ she said. ‘She is already of age;
she has been constantly ill during the past year; she gives much more trouble than
any of the others; and she is lazy. During her latest spell of sickness, which must have
been going on now for the better part of a fortnight, we’ve had her looked at by the
doctor and he says she’s got some kind of consumption - a kind that is quite common,
apparently, in unmarried girls; so I’ve sent her back to her own people and told them
that we shan’t be wanting her here again if she gets better, they can find a husband
for her themselves. I also took it upon myself to send away those young actresses.
For one thing, like most people trained in that profession, they use the most
appalling language I don’t think it’s very nice for the other girls to be exposed to it.
And for another thing, as we no longer require them to perform for us, which is what
they were trained for, I think it is only right that we should let them go. We have far
too many maids as it is. If Bao-yu or the girls need any more, we can supply them
from the regular staff; they don’t need young actresses to wait on them.’
Grandmother Jia nodded.
‘That sounds quite sensible. I had been thinking along those lines myself. About
Skybright, though: I always thought she was an excellent maid: she expressed herself
well; she was much the best needlewoman I ever had; I had been thinking of
eventually giving her to Bao-yu to keep. I’m sorry to hear she has changed so much
for the worse.’
‘I’m sure you were not mistaken in her,’ said Lady Wang, smiling. ‘Let’s just say that
the girl was not destined to be fortunate -.hence this perpetual sickness. “For a
growing girl there are eighteen hazards” the proverb says. Quite apart from that, I
think these very gifted people are apt to play up a bit, as I am sure you, Mother, with
all your rich experience must have noticed. Three years ago I, too, was thinking about
choosing someone permanent for Bao-yu, and to begin with I, too, thought of
Skybright as the likeliest choice. But after watching her very carefully, I came to the
conclusion that, although better qualified than the others in so many particulars, she
is not really a very dependable person. For all-round dependability I think Aroma is
very much her superior. I know they say “a wife for virtue and a concubine for
beauty”, but even in choosing a concubine I think the girl with a con?siderate nature
and a sense of responsibility is to be preferred. Aroma may not be as good-looking as
Skybright, but in other respects I should rate her qualifications as a chamber-wife
very highly. Her behaviour is so mature, and yet at the same time she is such a simple,
good-natured girl. During all the years that she has been with Bao-yu she has never
once misbehaved herself; in fact, whenever Bao-yu gets into one of his wild or silly
moods, she does her best to talk him out of it. I waited two whole years to see if she
was really as good as I thought she was, and when, at the end of all that time, I had
found no fault in her, I made a private arrangement to have her maid’s allowance
stopped and two taels paid to her each month out of my own allowance. Aroma
herself was the only person I told about this, because I thought she could do with the
encouragement. I deliberately kept it from everyone else, partly because if Sir Zheng
had got to hear about it he would almost certainly have said that Bao-yu was too
young for a chamber-wife and that having one would distract him from his studies,
and partly because if Bao-yu himself thought of her as a chamber-wife, he would be
less inclined to listen to her good advice and would become more ungovernable than
ever. That is the reason, Mother, why I haven’t told you about this before.’
‘I see,’ said Grandmother Jia, smiling. ‘Oh well, that’s all right then. Even better.
Aroma never had much to say for herself, in my recollection. I always thought her
rather a dull little stick. However, you obviously know her much better than I do. I’m
sure you can’t be wrong. I certainly think it very wise of you not to have told Bao-yu
himself about this, and I hope all of us here will continue to keep quiet about it. I am
sure you are right in thinking that he is the sort of person who, when he is married,
will never listen to a wife’s or a concubine’s advice. He’s a strange boy. I don’t really
understand him. I’ve certainly never known another one like him. His other kinds of
naughtiness I can understand; it’s this passion for spending all his time with maids
that I find so hard to make out. It used at one time to worry me: I thought it must be
because he had reached puberty and was having experiences with them; but after
watching him very carefully, I came to the conclusion that it wasn’t that at all. It’s
very, very strange. Perhaps he was a maid himself in some past life. Perhaps he ought
to have been a girl.’
Lady Wang and the others laughed. Lady Wang then went on to tell Grandmother Jia
how highly Jia Zheng had spoken of Bao-yu that morning and how he had taken
Bao-yu and the other two boys with him on an outing. Grandmother Jia was
delighted.
Not long after this Ying-chun appeared, dressed in her going-out clothes, to take
leave of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang before going next-door to stay with Lady
Xing. Xi-feng called in, too, for her morning duty call and stayed to wait on the old
lady while she took her lunch and to joke with her for a while after it was finished.
When the old lady had settled herself down for her after-lunch nap, Lady Wang called
to Xi-feng to accompany her back to her own apartment. She asked her whether she
had started taking the ginseng pills yet. No, not yet, Xi-feng told her, because she was
still taking the infusions; but her aunt was not to worry, because she was now feeling
completely better. Observing that she certainly seemed to have got her old
cheerfulness back, her aunt was inclined to believe her. She told her about her
dismissal of Skybright and the other girls. This led her to another topic.
‘Why did your Cousin Chai go back home without telling anyone? Doesn’t anyone
know? When I was making my inspection yesterday, I decided to take a look at Wan’s
servants as well. That new nurse she has got for little Lan is quite un?suitable; in fact,
I don’t like the look of her at all. I said to Wan, “I don’t care how you do it, my dear,
but you must get rid of that woman at once. Lan is old enough to do without a nurse
now in any case. He certainly doesn’t need a nurse like that one!” I asked her if she
knew about Bao-chai. She said yes, Bao-chai had told her that she was going, but it
was only for two or three days, until her mother was better, and then she would be
moving in again. Well I know for a fact that there is nothing much wrong with your
aunt: a bit of a cough and some back-ache, but then she always gets that at this time
of year. I am sure there is some other reason for her leaving. Can anyone have
offended her? She is such a serious child. I should hate to think of anyone offending
her after our two families have been getting on so well together all these years.’
‘Who could possibly have offended her?’ said Xi-feng, smiling.
‘I wondered if Bao-yu might have done,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He is so careless about
what he says, so tactless. When he gets excited he is capable of saying almost
anything.’
‘I don’t think you have much to worry about on that account,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Bao-yu
may behave foolishly in com?pany, but when he is with our girls, or even the maids,
he is always extremely considerate. His greatest anxiety is always how not to offend
them. He is certainly the last person I should expect to hear any of our girls complain
about. I should think Cousin Chai’s leaving has much more to do with that search we
carried out in the Garden the other night. She would naturally infer from it that the
people in the Garden are not trusted; and since she knew we would never search her
people because of her position here as our guest, she might well conclude that the
only way in which she could clear them of suspicion would be to move outside. I’m
sure that’s why she went: to avoid suspicion.’
To Lady Wang, too, this seemed the most likely explanation. She studied the floor
thoughtfully for some moments; then she had Bao-chai summoned, explained to her
what had happened, and assured her that she must not think herself under the least
suspicion. She must move back into the Garden at once and continue living there as
before.
Bao-chai smiled courteously but held her ground.
‘I had been meaning to move out some time ago, Aunt, but did not like to mention
it to you because I knew you were so much occupied with other matters. It was the
coincidence of Mamma’s being poorly and her two most reliable maids both going
sick at the same time which decided me to move out when I did. Now that you know
about my leaving, I should like to ask formally for permission to move out my things.’
Lady Wang and Xi-feng both laughed.
‘You are too unbending,’ said Lady Wang. ‘Do, please, move in again. Do not allow a
trifle like this to come between us.’
Bao-chai smiled.
‘I assure you, Aunt, you are quite mistaken. It really isn’t because of what you think
that I am leaving the Garden. It is because Mamma has been in rather low spirits
lately and there’s no one but me for her to rely on during the night. And be?sides,
Pan is getting married shortly, and there is still a lot of sewing to do and household
things to get. Mamma badly needs to have me at hand all the time to help her with
the preparations. You know how things are in my family, so you know that I am not
making this up. And there is another reason. Ever since I first moved into the Garden,
the little south-east corner gate has been left open. This was done specially for our
convenience, but of course there is nothing to prevent anyone else using it who
wants to take a short cut. No one going through it is ever questioned. Now suppose
the wrong person got in by that way and something awful happened. It would make
it very awkward for all of us. When I first moved into the Garden it didn’t matter
much one way or the other if I spent the nights there. We were all very much
younger then and there wasn’t so much that needed doing at home. It seemed
better for me to be sewing or playing in the Garden with the other girls than moping
at home on my own. But now we are older it is rather different. I am sure that the
worries you have had during this past year or two have been aggravated by the fact
that the Garden is too big to keep all the time under your surveillance. Any reduction
in the number of people living there means some reduction in the number of your
worries. That is why I am not only determined to move permanently out of the
Garden myself, Aunt, but would seriously urge you to make whatever other reduction
in numbers may be necessary. You mustn’t think that for a great household like yours
to retrench would be undignified. Look how modestly we live nowadays. It was a very
different style we used to live in when I was a little girl.’
It was unusual for Bao-chai to speak at such length. When she had finished, Xi-feng
turned with an amused expression to Lady Wang.
‘I think you will have to let her have her way, Aunt. You can’t force her to move in if
she doesn’t want to.’
Lady Wang nodded.
‘I find what you say unanswerable,’ she told Bao-chai. ‘You will have to do as you
think best.’
While she was speaking, Bao-yu came in to report that he was back.
‘Father is still at the party,’ he said. ‘He told us to come back now because he was
afraid it might be going on much longer and he didn’t want us coming back in the
dark.’
‘I hope you didn’t disgrace yourself,’ said Lady Wang anxiously.
‘Not in the least,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Look at all the loot we’ve brought back!’
The old women from the inner gate who, as he entered, had relieved his pages of the
things they had been carrying, now came forward with them for Lady Wang to
inspect. There were three fans, three fan-pendants, three boxes of writing-brushes,
three boxes of ink-sticks, three rosaries and three jade belt-buckles: one of
everything for each of the three boys.
‘The fans and fan-pendants are from Academician Mei,’ said Bao-yu, ‘the ink-sticks
and brushes are from Vice-President Yang, and the rosaries and buckles are from
Under-Secretary Li.’ He fished out a little sandalwood Buddha-charm from inside his
jacket. ‘This is from the Duke of Qing-guo. He only gave one to me.’
Lady Wang questioned him about the other people who had been present and the
poems that had been composed. She told someone to take Bao-yu’s share of the
presents and go with him and the other two boys to see Grandmother Jia.
Grand?mother Jia was of course delighted, and Bao-yu found him?self having to
answer all the same questions over again. His anxiety to learn about Skybright made
him anxious to get away, and after answering a few of them, he told his grandmother
that he had been riding rather fast and was aching all over from his ride.
‘You must go back to your room at once then and change into more comfortable
clothes,’ she said. ‘You’ll feel better when you’ve had a chance to relax; but don’t,
whatever you do, lie down.’
Bao-yu left his grandmother’s without more ado. Musk and Ripple, with two of the
junior maids from Green Delights, were waiting for him outside. Ripple took charge
of his share of the presents and she and the other two trotted along after him as he
strode into the Garden.
‘Phew! I’m hot,’ he said, divesting himself of hat, belt and outer garment as he
walked along and handing them to Musk to carry. He was wearing a gown of lined
damask underneath, whose viridian green contrasted strikingly with the flashes of
blood-red trouser revealed through the side-slits as he walked along. Ripple
recognized the trousers as Skybright’s handiwork.
‘“Objects remind us”,’ she said, quoting from the well-known proverb. Musk
nudged her reprovingly and tried to change the subject.
‘Yes,’ she said lightly, ‘the red of the trousers goes very well with the dark green of
the gown. What with them and his blue-black boots and his greeny-black hair and his
snow-white face he makes quite a picture!’
Bao-yu, walking slightly ahead of them, pretended not to have heard; but after going
only a few steps further, he halted abruptly.
‘Oh dear, I have to pay a little call!’ he said. ‘What am I going to do?’
‘That’s all right,’ said Musk. ‘We’re not going to lose you in broad daylight!’
She told the two junior maids to go with him.
‘Ripple and I will come back for you when we’ve got rid of these.’
‘Can’t you wait?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I shan’t be a moment.’
‘Oh, do let us get rid of these things first!’ said Musk. ‘Whatever must we look like,
traipsing after you with all this stuff? Like the Wardrobe Master and the Clerk of the
Ink-horn in a royal procession!’
Bao-yu, who had been hoping that they would go, indicated that they might do so
and went off with the two junior maids to a secluded corner behind some rocks
where he could question them.
‘Did Aroma send anyone to Skybright’s place after I had gone?’
‘Yes, she sent Mamma Song,’ said one of the girls.
‘What did Mamma Song say when she got back?’
‘They told her that Skybright was lying with her head back calling out all night long,
but in the early morning she stopped calling and closed her eyes. They said it looked
as if she was going.’
‘Who was she calling for?’ Bao-yu asked hurriedly.
‘Her mother,’ said the girl. ‘They said she just went on calling “Mamma!”
“Mamma!” all night long.’
‘Didn’t she call for anyone else?’ said Bao-yu, brushing away a tear.
‘They didn’t mention anyone else,’ said the girl.
‘Oh, you’re a silly girl!’ said Bao-yu impatiently. ‘I’m sure you must have misheard.’
‘She certainly is a silly girl,’ the other little maid piped up. A sharp little creature,
she had sensed at once what Bao-yu was hoping for and was willing to supply it. ‘I
not only heard exactly what Mrs Song said; I even managed to slip out and see
Skybright myself.’
‘How did you come to do that?’ Bao-yu asked her.
‘Remembering how much kinder than any of the other senior maids Skybright had
always been to me,’ said the girl, ‘I thought to myself that though I couldn’t do
anything else for her in her trouble, I could at least go to visit her. Even if someone
saw me and reported me to Her Ladyship and I got a beating, it would be worth it
after all she had done for me. So, at the risk of a beating, I stole round to her cousin’s
place to see her. Although she was so near death, her mind was quite unaltered. She
held my hand and opened her eyes wide when she saw me. “Where’s Bao-yu gone?”
she said. When I told her, she sighed. “Oh,” she said, “I shan’t be able to see him,
then.” “Can’t you hold out a bit?” I asked her. She smiled at me. “No,” she said. “You
see, I’m not really dying; I’m going to heaven to be a flower-spirit. The Jade Emperor
has given me the job of looking after the flowers.” She said, “I have to leave at
half-past two to take up the job, and Bao?-yu won’t be home until a quarter to three,
so we shall miss seeing each other by only a quarter of an hour. Usually when people
are dying, King Yama sends his demons to fetch their souls, and if you want to delay a
bit, all you have to do is burn a bit of spirit money and make a little offering of some
rice and tea, and they will leave you alone for a few minutes while they go after the
money and stuff. But when the heavenly messengers summon you, it’s different. You
can’t keep them waiting for a single moment.” At the time I didn’t quite believe her,
but when I got back I kept my eye on the clock and sure enough it was exactly a
quarter to three, as she’d said it would be, when they told us you’d got back and we
were to go over and wait for you.’
‘You can’t read,’ said Bao-yu, ‘so you wouldn’t know about these things. But there
are in fact flower-spirits: I’ve read about them. Not only is there a spirit in charge of
all the flowers, but there are also lesser spirits in charge of each separate kind of
flower. I wonder which Skybright is going to be.’
The little maid quickly glanced round the Garden for inspiration. Her eye lit on some
hibiscus bushes which, this being now the second half of autumn, were already in full
bloom.
‘I asked her myself,’ she said. “‘Tell me what kind of flower you are going to be
responsible for,” I said, “so that after you are gone we shall know where and when to
make you offerings.” “I’ll tell you,” she said, “but you mustn’t let anyone else but
Bao-yu know about it. These are immortal matters which are supposed to be kept
secret.” Then she told me: the hibiscus flower.’
Bao-yu found nothing extraordinary in this. On the contrary, after hearing it, his
sorrow turned instantly into delight. He looked round and smiled happily as his eyes
rested on the hibiscus bushes.
‘Such a flower is worthy to be looked after by such a person!’ he said. ‘I felt sure
that someone of her qualities would have work to do in the world. But -’ he became
sad once more as he reflected - ‘although her sufferings are over, it still means that I
shall never see her again.’
Then it occurred to him that, though he had failed to be with her at the end, there
was nothing to stop him going to see her now and paying his last respects to her body.
After the five or six years she had been with him and all that she had done for him in
that time, he surely owed it to her. He hurried back to carry out this resolve, running
into Musk and Ripple on his way. They had just started out again to look for him.
Back at Green Delights he hurriedly dressed up again and, telling the girls that he was
going to pay a call on Dai-yu, slipped out of the Garden and made his way, on his own
this time, to the place where he had visited Skybright the day hefore, expecting to
find her laid out there in her coffin.
Skybright had died not, as the lying maid had said, that afternoon, but early in the
morning. As soon as she had breathed her last, the cousin and his wife had gone to
the mansion to tell Lady Wang in the hope of getting some money out of her for the
funeral. Lady Wang had given them ten taels and told them to get the body out of
the house as quickly as possible and have it cremated.
‘The girl died of a consumption,’ she said. ‘You mustn’t keep the body in the house,
whatever you do.’
Impressed by this advice, they had hurried off with the money and made
arrangements to have the body encoffined and carried to the burning ground outside
the city without delay. Skybright’s clothes and jewellery, worth between three and
four hundred taels, they kept for themselves: a nice little sum to put by for their old
age. When all the arrangements had been completed, they shut up the house and
accompanied the hearse outside the city to see the body cremated. Bao-yu arrived,
therefore, to find the house locked up and nobody at home. Once more frustrated,
he stood for some minutes gazing blankly at the door. Finally, since there was nothing
else he could do, he turned round and walked back to the Garden. The thought of
returning to his room was distasteful to him. He decided to call in at Dai-yu’s on the
way back; but Dai-yu’s maids told him that their mistress was out.
‘She’s gone to see Miss Bao,’ they said.
Bao-ya made his way to All-spice Court. To his surprise he found it silent and
deserted, and when he peeped inside, he could see that it had the empty, cheerless
look of an uninhabited house. He had a vague recollection of having heard some days
previously that Bao-chai was thinking of moving out; but he had been so busy with
homework during the past few days that it had gone out of his mind. Now it
appeared that she really had moved.
A sort of blankness came over him. Chess had gone. Picture had gone. Parfumée and
the other four little actresses had gone. Skybright was dead. Now, it seemed, Bao-hai
and her lot had gone, too. And though Ying-chun was supposed to have left only
temporarily, to judge from the number of visits made by match-makers during the
past weeks, it would not be very long before she was getting married. The Garden’s
little society was breaking up.
‘Oh well,’ he thought, ‘no good fretting about it now. I’ll go and enjoy Dai-yu’s
company for a while; and after that, I’ve still got Aroma to go back to. It looks as if we
three will soon be the only ones left.’
In that philosophical frame of mind he went back to the Naiad’s House; but Dai-yu
had still not returned. Just as he was wondering where else he could go, a maid from
Lady Wang’s apartment came up to him with a message from his mother.
‘The Master’s back now and wants to see you. He says he’s got a good subject for a
poem and you are to come at once.’
Bao-yu was obliged to accompany the girl to his mother’s apartment; but by the time
he got there, his father had already gone. Lady Wang ordered some of her women to
accompany him to his father’s study outside. He found Jia Zheng discussing the
highlights of the chrysanthemum-viewing party with his literary gentlemen.
‘Shortly before the gathering broke up,’ he was telling them, ‘there was some
discussion about an episode from the history of the last dynasty. It was a story in
which the romantic, the edifying, the heroic and the pathetic were all exemplified -
indeed, one of the most remarkable stories I have ever heard. Everyone present
agreed that it deserved a poem to commemorate it.’
‘Pray tell us the story,’ said the literary gentlemen, intrigued.
‘It seems that there was a member of the Imperial clan called Prince Heng,’ Jia
Zheng began, ‘who had gone out to become Military Governor of Qing-zhou. As well
as being a fanatically keen soldier, the Prince was inordinately fond of female
company, and in the free time left over from his official duties, found a way of
combining these two interests by recruiting a large number of beautiful young
women whom he had trained in military arts. Every day these young women would
be made to engage in mock combat and other warlike exercises for the Prince’s
entertainment. The most beautiful and also the most militarily accomplished of these
young women was a certain Miss Lin, who, because she was the fourth daughter in
her family, was known by the name of “Fourth Sister Lin”. Prince Heng thought so
highly of her that he gave her a colonelcy and put her in command of the whole
female troop. From then on he took to calling her “Colonel Winsome” or “the
Winsome Colonel”.’
‘How priceless!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen rapturously. “‘The Winsome
Colonel”! What a marvellous com?bination! Surely this Prince Heng must have been
one of the most eccentrically romantic persons the world has known?’
‘One could certainly call him that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘But there is stranger still to
follow.’
‘Stranger still?’ said the literary gentlemen with surprise. ‘Then this must be a very
strange tale indeed.’
‘In the second year of his governorship,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘a horde of bandits,
latter-day descendants of the Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows of the Han period,
swept over the whole of Shantung Province, looting and pillaging as they went. The
Prince, scorning to mobilize fully against an enemy whom he regarded as a mere
rabblement of sheep and curs, took the field against them himself at the head of only
a light force of cavalry. But the rebel leadership, by an unexpected combination of
cunning and low trickery, defeated him in two successive engagements. In the second
of these the Prince himself died fighting.
‘In Qing-zhou the civil and military authorities were in a panic.
“‘What could you or I hope to do when the Prince himself has failed?” they asked
each other, and began to make plans for yielding up the city to the rebels.
‘But Fourth Sister Lin’s reaction to the grim news was to gather her fellow-officers
together and address them as follows:
“‘Our beloved Prince’s goodness to us was such that we could never have repaid
even a small fraction of it as long as we lived. Now that he has laid down his life for
his country, I feel that we in turn ought to lay our lives down for him. Those who feel
as I do, follow me. Those who do not are free to leave now, while there is time.”
“‘We will follow you!” the girls cried with a single voice; and that night, under the
cover of darkness, they rode out from the walls of Qing-zhou into the midst of the
rebel camp. At first, because the rebels were unprepared, they succeeded in killing
and decapitating several of their leaders; but it was not long before those in the
camp realized that the raiders were a party of women who could easily be overcome
if offered determined resistance. Seizing their weapons and rallying themselves
together, they fell upon Fourth Sister Lin and her band with such ferocity that soon
the girls’ heroic vow to die for their Prince was fulfilled, for not a single one of them
was left alive.
‘The Emperor and the entire Court were deeply affected when news of this was
brought to them. It is to be assumed that a suitable person was then appointed to
command operations against the rebels and that the rebel horde melted away at the
first appearance of the Imperial forces - we are not concerned with that. But what of
Fourth Sister Lin, gentlemen? Do you not find her an admirable person?’
‘Admirable indeed!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘And what a marvellous subject for
a poem! We must all of us try to make one up about her.’
One of their number took a writing-brush and inkstone and wrote down the story
almost exactly as Jia Zheng had told it, slightly modifying it here and there in the
interest of style, to serve as a short preface for their poem. When he had finished it,
he handed it to Jia Zheng for his approval.
‘Yes, that seems to me exactly as it should be,’ said Jia Zheng after glancing briefly
through it. ‘It was a preface rather like this one that started off the discussion at our
gathering. An Imperial directive was received at the Department yesterday asking for
a search to be made in the records of this and the preceding dynasty for hitherto
neglected instances of outstanding merit deserving some posthumous recognition.
No class of persons was to be excluded: monks, nuns, beggars, women and girls - all
were eligible. Wherever exceptional merit could be established, a brief account of it
was to be forwarded to the Board of Rites for inclusion in the list of
recommendations. The preface they were discussing at our gathering was a copy of
the account sent in by our Department to the Board. It was reading that preface that
gave those present the idea that they should write a “Winsome Colonel” poem in
commemoration of Fourth Sister Lin’s heroic loyalty.’
‘And very right that they should!’ said the literary gentlemen smilingly. ‘But what is
most admirable of all about this story is the tireless benevolence of the present Court
which led to the unearthing of this forgotten heroism. Surely this is a thing
unparalleled in any former age? The Tang poet’s line
This holy age, when nothing good’s omitted,
might almost have been written in anticipation of the present reign.’
‘Indeed!’ Jia Zheng nodded gravely.
By this time Jia Huan and Jia Lan had also arrived. Jia Zheng allowed the three boys to
look at the preface and then told them that he wanted a poem from each one of
them. He would award a prize to whoever completed one first and another prize for
the best poem.
Jia Huan and Jia Lan had several times recently been called upon to compose in
company and so were not unduly nervous on this occasion. After reading the preface,
all three boys went off into separate corners to think. Jia Lan was the first to finish a
poem and Jia Huan, fearful of being outstripped by his young nephew, made haste to
follow. The two of them had already written their poems out while Bao-yu was still
thinking. Jia Zheng and the literary gentlemen decided to look first at what the two
younger boys had written. Jia Lan’s contribution was in the form of a quatrain.
Fourth Sister Lin was the Winsome Colonel’s name:
She was beautiful and gentle, yet her valour none could tame.
In Qing-zhou where, her Prince to avenge, she threw her life away,
The very ground on which she fell is fragrant to this day.
The literary gentlemen praised the little poem enthusiastically.
‘For a young boy of his years to produce such a poem is proof of a highly cultured
upbringing,’ they said.
‘Childish prattle! Childish prattle!’ Jia Zheng laughed deprecatingly. ‘Still, for one of
his tender years it is quite a creditable effort.’
Next they read Jia Huan’s contribution. It was a Regulated Verse poem in
pentameters.
The lovely lady would not sit and grieve;
For sterner thoughts her warlike breast did fill.
She dried her woman’s tears and fearless rode
Through Qing-zhou’s gates to be killed and to kill.
‘However great the odds,’ she said, ‘I can
‘My debt repay, if not avenge this ill.’
The inscription graved upon her tomb shall be:
‘Here buried lies the world’s fidelity.’
‘Ah yes!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘What a difference those few years between
them make! This is quite a different approach.’
‘I suppose it’s not too bad,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but it doesn’t really do justice to the
subject.’
‘Oh well, as to that -!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘After all, our young friend is not
so very much older than his nephew. Old heads are not to be expected on young
shoulders! Give them a few more years and I don’t doubt we shall have a pair of
poets in our midst to rival Ruan Ji and his nephew Ruan Xian!’
‘Come, come, they are not as good as that!’ said Jia Zheng, smiling. ‘They don’t
study hard enough, that’s their trouble.’
He asked Bao-yu how he was getting on.
‘After all this careful chiselling, Mr Bao’s poem is sure to be something of quite a
different order from these two we have just heard,’ said the literary gentlemen’ - one,
no doubt, in which the romantic and tragic aspects of the theme will both be fully
exploited.’
Bao-yu smiled.
‘I don’t think Regulated Verse is quite the right medium for this subject. It calls for
something longer - a song or ballad in the Old Style - to do it justice.’
‘You see!’ said the literary gentlemen, some jumping to their feet, some nodding or
clapping in their enthusiasm. ‘We said that his contribution would be quite different!
It is the sign of a good, experienced writer to be able to gauge immediately what
form will be most appropriate to the sub?ject. With a title like this and a preface,
clearly what is called for is either a long narrative poem like Bo Ju-yi’s “The
Ever?lasting Remorse” or an Old Style ode like Wen Ting-yun’s “On Hearing Guo
Dao-yuan Play the Musical Glasses” or Li He’s “Return from Gui-ji”, in which narrative
and lyrical elements combine. Only the greater freedom of the Old Style allows for
the smoother, more flowing development that this subject calls for.’
Jia Zheng was of the same opinion. He took brush and paper and prepared to write.
‘So be it, then. Recite your lines, my boy, and I shall take them down for you. They
had better be good after this boastfill preliminary, or I shall beat your bottom!’
Bao-yu recited his first line:
Prince Heng was fond of a pretty face and of martial arts also -
Jia Zheng copied the words down and then shook his head over what he had written.
‘Vulgar and pedestrian!’
‘No, no, it isn’t vulgar,’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘That is what the Ballad
Style is like. Wait and see how it goes on.’
‘All right, we’ll let it pass,’ said Jia Zheng.
Bao-yu continued.
So he trained the ladies of his court to ride and draw the bow.
In ravishing songs and beguiling dances the Prince took no delight,
But to watch the pike-drill he was fain of fair maids in a row.
He waited while Jia Zheng finished writing down the lines. The literary gentlemen
professed themselves particularly impressed by the ‘ravishing songs’ line, claiming to
see a quality of ‘rugged strength’ in it which they deemed highly appropriate in a
ballad. The fourth line, which they called ‘pure narrative’, was also, they thought,
exactly as it should be.
‘You shouldn’t praise the boy so,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘You will turn his head. Let’s see
how he manages to develop this in his second stanza.’
Bao-yu recited:
As he watched them drill, he scarcely saw the clouds of dust arise;
’Twas the lovely Colonel’s lamplit face that swam before his eyes.
‘Bravo!’ shouted the literary gentlemen. “‘He scarcely saw the clouds of dust” leads
us on to the “lamplit face” of the heroine. A most ingenious development! The way
every word is used in these two lines is quite masterful!’
Bao-yu continued:
When the rosy lips framed their harsh commands he could smell the mouth’s sweet
breath;
But the weapons oft shook in the fair white hands, too weak for such exercise.
The literary gentlemen laughed and clapped their hands.
‘What a wonderful picture! I think friend Bao must have been among those present
at the time. He saw the white hand shake and smelt the perfume. How else could he
describe it all so vividly?’
Bao-yu laughed.
‘Women drilling, however bold and fierce they might be, could never look quite the
same as men. One can assume the occasional softness creeping in without having
had any special experience.’
‘Oh, get on!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘We can do without the comment.’
Bao-yu thought a little before beginning the next stanza.
The lotus belt round the Colonel’s waist in a clove-shaped knot was tied –
     ‘The change of rhyme from “eyes” to “eyed” is one example of that smooth,
flowing development we were just now talking about,’ said the literary gentlemen.
‘Also, this line has just that touch of charm and prettiness that the subject calls for.’
‘I don’t agree,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘I don’t like this line at all. We have already heard
about her “mouth’s sweet breath” and her “fair white hand” in the last stanza. Why
does he need to go on in this strain? I think it is mere weakness of invention that
leads to this piling up of descriptive bric-à-brac.’
‘ A long ballad needs a few ornamental, descriptive passages,’ said Bao-yu,
‘otherwise it would seem too bare.’
‘You are continuing the same kind of description into a new stanza,’ said Jia Zheng.
‘When are you going to get on to her warlike side? If you have another two or three
lines of this kind of stuff, it’s going to seem like drawing legs on a snake!’
‘All right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ll try to make a quick change to the warlike side and then
finish the whole description off in this one stanza.’
‘What a genius!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically. ‘You begin with a line that looks like
the first item in a long catalogue, and now you are talking about instant changes and
abrupt conclusions. I think you may find that you have bitten off rather more than
you can chew!’
Bao-yu hung his head and pondered a while before finally coming out with this line:
Yet it was not strung pearls that hung from it, but the good sword at her side.
‘Will that do?’ he asked anxiously.
The literary gentlemen banged on the table and cheered.
‘We’ll leave it,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Carry on.’
‘If it will do, I’ll continue as I’ve planned,’ said Bao-yu. If not, it would be better to
cross it out and I’ll try to think of something completely different and develop in
another direction.’
Jia Zheng shouted at him angrily.
‘Hold your tongue, sir! Do it again if it’s not good enough, indeed! How many times
do you propose to go on trying? Ten times? A hundred? Save your energy and get
on!’
Bao-yu resigned himself to developing from the line he had just recited. He thought
for some moments before continning.
When late at night the jousting ended, her courage was quite spent,
And her handkerchief with carmine sweat from her streaming face was dyed.
‘That’s the end of another stanza,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Now how are you going on?’
Bao-yu continued:
Next year the whole North-east land with rebels was a-run,
Like ravening beasts, or swarming bees after the queen has flown –
      ‘ “A-run” is good,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘It is little touches like that that
show the master-hand at work. The narrative style in this stanza is good, too. Lively.’
Bao-yu continued:
The Prince led forth the Emperor’s men the rebel hordes to quell.
  He fought them once and he fought them twice, but his army was overthrown.
A stench of blood upon the wind blighted the standing corn,
And on empty tents and an empty camp the setting sun went down.
*
‘Twas the rainy time, and sounding rills down the lone green hillsides sped
When Prince Heng, his fighting ended, on the battlefield lay dead.
Now rain has washed the white bones clean, but not the blood-soaked grass,
And as the moon rises, shivering ghosts stand at each corpse’s head.
‘Brilliant!’ cried the literary gentlemen. ‘The narrative style, the imagery, the choice
of words are all quite perfect. But now what about Fourth Sister Lin? What ingenious
new development will bring her back upon the scene?’
Bao-yu recited:
The officers refused to fight for fear they might be killed,
    And with no defenders, Qing-zhou’s fate seemed already to be sealed.
But though the men were all afraid, the girls were loyal and true:
And among them Prince Heng’s favourite with especial zeal was filled.
‘Neatly turned!’ said the literary gentlemen.
‘It took four lines to do it, though,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too much! And I expect there is
more useless verbiage to follow.’
Bao-yu continued:
Now who the Prince’s favourite was to you shall be revealed:
    Fourth Sister Lin she was by name, the Winsome Colonel called.
She rallied her companions fair and issued a command,
And like a troop of lovely flowers they rode into the field.
*
Their heavy saddle-cloths are wet with tears of the spring sky’s woe,
   And the iron of their armour chills them, as through the cold night they go.
Though the outcome may be uncertain; they have taken a solemn vow,
Whate’er befall, before they die, for the Prince to strike a blow.
*
But what chance against their savage foe had that gallant band?
Like gentle flowers they perished, crushed by a brutal hand.
The horses’ hooves are fragrant yet that trod them in the mud;
   Near the city walls their poor ghosts flit, where they made their final stand.
*
A courier riding through the night to the Emperor’s city came,
And all who heard his heavy news with sadness did exclaim.
The Son of Heaven looked aghast when he learned of Qing-zhou’s fall,
And his captains and his counsellors all hung their heads for shame.
*
The captains and the counsellors and men of high degree
Were put to shame by Fourth Sister Lin’s fidelity.
For Fourth Sister Lin my heart with grief doth swell,
And though my song is ended now, my thoughts on her still dwell.
The literary gentlemen broke into loud acclaim as Bao-yu finished. It seemed at first
as if they might go on indefinitely. Subsiding at last, they read the whole poem
through again from the beginning.
‘It is certainly a very long poem,’ said Jia Zheng, smiling, ‘but for all that, I don’t
think it really does justice to the subject.’
He turned to the three boys:
‘All right, off you go!’
The three of them went off, feeling like condemned prisoners who have suddenly
been given a reprieve. For the two younger ones it was the end of their day: a
blessed nothingness until bedtime. But Bao-yu was still grieving for Skybright. The
sight of the hibiscus by the lake reminded him of what the little maid had told him
about her. As he stood gaz?ing sorrowfully at the bushes, an idea suddenly came to
him.
‘Since I wasn’t able to see her in her coffin, why don’t I pay my last respects to her
here, in the presence of her flowers?’
He was on the point of kneeling down in front of them when another thought
occurred to him.
‘That’s all very well, but I can’t do it just anyhow. In order to show proper respect I
must first make sure that I am dressed correctly. And I must prepare a little ceremony
and make her some sort of offering.’
This led to further cogitation.
‘It says somewhere in the classics, “Where there is faith enough and goodwill,
duckweed boiled in puddle-water is an offering acceptable to the gods and a dish fit
to be set before princes.” Proper respect evidently has nothing to do with the value
of the offering. And I could always write something to read out before I made it.’
He began to plan what he would write. ‘An elegy’ it would be called. It would be a bit
like one of those long Chu poems – Li sao or The Summons of the Soul - but with
elements of other things as well. And of course a lot of it would be original. He sat
down and began writing it as soon as he got back to his apartment. As it was to
please himself, he could be as wild and extravagant as he liked and compose as
quickly as his imagination would let him. Soon the draft was finished, and he took a
piece of white material of the kind they call ‘mer?maid silk’, which he knew Skybright
had been fond of, and after first writing the title on it in large characters:
THE SPIRIT OF THE HIBISCUS:
AN ELEGY AND INVOCATION
he copied out the text in a neat kai-shu hand and carried it with him into the Garden.
The little maid who had told him about Skybright’s transformation had to follow him
with some things for the offering on a tray: a cup of tea, some autumn flowers in a
vase of water, and some charcoal in a little burner for starting a fire with. When his
solemn bowings and kneelings were over, he hung the silk up on the branches of a
hibiscus and began tearfully to read out the words:
The year being one in the era of Immutable Peace, the month that in which the
Sweet odours of hibiscus and cassia compete, the day, a heavy and doleful day, I,
most wretched and disconsolate JADE of the House of Green Delights, having with
due reverence prepared and got together buds of flowers, silk of mermaids, water of
the Drenched Blos?soms stream and Fung Loo tea (all things of little value in
themselves, yet sufficient to attest the devotion of a true believer) do here offer
them up in sacrifice to her that has now, in the Palace of the White God) become
SPIRIT OF THE HIBISCUS, having power and dominion over the flowers of autumn.
It is now sixteen years since the BLEST SPIRIT de?scended into the world of men. As
to her native place and the lineage in which she was born, they were long since
forgotten; but for five years and eight months of that time she was, in my rising up
and lying down, in my washings and combings, in my rest and play, my constant close
companion and helpmate.
It is to be recorded of her that in estimation she was more precious than gold or jade,
in nature more pure than ice or snow, in wit more brilliant than the sun or stars, in
complexion more beautiful than the moon or than flowers. Who of the maidens did
not admire her accomplishments? Who among the matrons did not marvel at her
sagacity?
But if baleful scritch-owls that hate the heights can cause the kingly eagle to be taken
in a net, and rank and stinking weeds, envious of another’s fragrance, can cause the
sweet herb of grace to be uprooted, it is not to be thought that a shrinking flower
could withstand the whirlwind’s blast, or a tender willow-tree be proof against the
buffetings of the tempest. When the envenomed tongue of slander was wagged
against her, she pined inwardly with a wasting sickness: the red of her cherry lips
faded and only sad and plaintive sounds issued out of them; the bloom of her apricot
cheeks withered and none but lean and haggard looks were to be seen upon them.
Slanders and slights crept from behind every curtain; thorns and thistles choked up
the doors and windows of her chamber. Yet truly she had done no infamous thing.
She entered a silent victim into the eternal, a wronged innocent into the everlasting:
a more notable martyr (though but a mere girl) to the envy of excellence than he
who was drowned at Long Sands; a more pitiable sufferer from the peril of plain
dealing than he that was slain upon Feather Mountain.
Yet since she stored up her bitterness in silence, none recognized the treasure that
was lost in her, cut off so young. The fair cloud dispersed, leaving no means to trace
the beauteous outline of its former shape. It were a hard thing to hunt out the Isle of
the Blest from among the multi?tudinous islands of the ocean and bring back the
immortal herb that should restore her: the raft is lost that went to look for it.
It was but yesterday that I painted those delicate smoke-black eyebrows; and who is
there today to warm the cold jade rings for her fingers? The medicine she drank
stands yet upon the stove; the tears are still wet on the garment she once wore. The
phoenix has flown and MUSK’s vanity-box has burst apart for sorrow; the dragon has
departed, and RIPPLE’s comb has broken its teeth for grief. The magpie has forsaken
my chamber: it is in vain for the maidens to hang up their needles on Seventh Night
and pray for nimble fingers. My buckle with the love-ducks is broken: the seamstress
is no more who could repair the silk-work of its girdle.
And this being the season of autumn when the power of metal predominates and the
White God is master of the earth, the signs themselves are melancholy. I wake from
dreams of her on a lonely couch and in an empty room. As the moon veils herself
behind the trees of the garden, the moonlight and the sweet form I dreamed of are
in the same moment extinguished; as the perfume fades from the hangings of my
bedchamber, the laboured breath and whispered words I strove to catch at the same
time fail silent. Dew pearls the pavement’s moss; the launderer’s beat is borne in
unceasingly through my casement. Rain wets the wall-fig; a flute’s complaint carries
uncertainly from a near-by courtyard.
Her sweet name is not extinguished, for the parrot in his cage under the eaves ceases
not to repeat it; and the crabtree in my courtyard whose half-withering was a
foretokening of her fate stands yet her memorial. But no more shall the sound of her
lotus feet betray her at hide-and-seek behind the screen; no more will her fingers cull
budding orchids for the game of match-my-flower in the garden. The embroidery
silks are thrown aside in a tangle: never again will she cut them with her silver
scissors. The sheeny silk lies creased and crumpled: never again shall her hot-iron
smooth out its perfumed folds.
In her last hour, when I might else have gone to her, I was called in haste from the
Garden by a Father’s summons; when, grieving, I sought to take leave of her
abandoned body, I could not see it because it had been removed by a Mother’s
command; and when I was told that her corpse had been consumed, I repented of
my jesting vow that we should share the same grave-hole together, for that were
now impossible, and that our ashes should commingle, for ash she is already
become.
In the burning-ground by the old temple, green ghost-fires flicker when the west
wind blows. On its derelict mounds, scattered bones gleam whitely in the setting sun.
The wind sighs in the tall trees and rustles in the dried-up grasses below. Gibbons call
sadly from tombs that are hidden in the mist, and ghosts flit weeping down the
alley-ways between the tombs. At such times must the young man in his
crimson-curtained bed seem most cruelly afflicted; at such times must the maiden
beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated.
The tears of Ru-nan fall in bloody drops upon the wind, and the complaint of Golden
Valley is made to the moon in silence. Vengeance is for demons and baleful bogles;
the gentle spirits of maidens are not wont to be jealous, though wronged. Natheless
shall the backbiters not lightly escape her; their mouths shall be squeezed in vices;
the hearts of those cruel harridans shall he ripped: for her anger is kindled against
them.
Though the bond between us was a slight one, yet can it not easily he broken; and
because she was ever close to me in my thoughts, I could not forbear to make
earnest inquiry concerning her. Thus it was revealed to me that the God had sent
down the banner of his authority and summoned her to his Palace of Flowers, to the
end that she who in life was like a flower should in death have dominion over the
hibiscus. At first when I heard the words of the little maid touching this appointment,
I thought them fantastical; but now that I have pondered them in my heart, I know
them to be worthy of perfect credence. How so?
Did not Ye Fa-shan compel Li Yong’s sleeping spirit to compose an epitaph? And was
not the soul of Li He summoned in order that he might write a memorial in heaven?
The circumstances may differ, but the principle is the same. God chooses his
ministers according to their capabilities, else how could they discharge the duties
that are required of them? And who more fit and meet than her to be given this
charge that has been laid upon her? Truly, here at last she has a work that is worthy
of her.
And because I would have her descend here in this place, I have composed these
verses to invoke her with, fearing that the common speech of mortals might be
offensive to her immortal ear.
The Invocation
All’s clearest azure above * where her team of white wyverns through the welkin
wends,
And the world in a haze below * as her chryselephantine car to the earth descends.
Her awning’s relucent splendour * outshines Antares and his starry band,
Her guidons and gonfalons go before * and the stars of Aquarius guard her on either
hand.
Cloudcleaver follows as escort * Moondriver gallops to clear the way ahead.
I can hear the creak and trundle of chariot-wheels * of her phoenix-figured car’s
majestic tread.
I can smell the enveloping perfume * of her cincture from fragrant stalks of asarum
twined,
See the dazzle of her dress * gleaming with moon-jade ouches, fretted and lined.
I’ll strew the altar with lily-of-the-valley leaves * and have water?-lilies for lamps fed
with orchid oil,
And in chalices cunningly fashioned from calabash * pour rarest metheglin flavoured
with penny-royal.
As I fasten my gaze on the clouds * methinks I see a faint glimmer of her face;
As I strain my ear on the silence * I seem to hear a faint echo of her voice.
But she, on a tryst with eternity, brooking no coarctation * has abandoned me, cruel,
here in the dust to lie,
Calling on Windlord in vain to drive me up after her * to ride side by side with her
across the sky.
My heart is all wracked with teen * yet it boots not to weep and wail:
You are gone now to your long sleep * against Nature’s order no power on earth can
prevail.
In the grave-vault secure you rest * the bourne after which there is no more
transformation.
But to me still in bonds in this hateful wen below * O Spirit, succouring come for my
consolation!
O Spirit, come and abide for my consolation!

But what though she is present in this place? She is girt about with silence;
she is veiled in a mist of invisibility; I cannot see her:

Only the green wreathed creepers that make her side-screens,
And the ranks of tall bullrushes, her guardsmen’s spears.
The sleepy willow-buds waken as she approaches;
And the bitter lotus-seeds sweeten as she nears.
The White Virgin waits for her on cliffs of cassia;
From Orchid Island the water-sprite comes to greet her.
Jade-player plays for her on a little organ,
And Cold-keys sweeps the iron spine with his metal beater.
The God of the Mid Peak’s consort comes at her bidding;
The crone of Li Mountain is summoned forth to meet her.
The Luo River turtle brings her his magic offering;
To the heavenly music wild beasts gambol and prance.
In the deeps of Red River the dragons are humming the melody;
And in pearl-tree groves the Birds of Paradise dance.

Seeing my reverence and my devoutness of heart (notwith?standing that I have
neither vessels of gold nor vessels of bronze in which to make my offering) she drove
forth her chariot from the City of Sunrise to meet me; but even now her banners are
returning to the Garden of Night. For a little moment it seemed that the invisible
would become visible; but murky vapours rose up suddenly between us and we were
cut off.

Clouds and mists drifted and drew together,
Rain and fog veiled the heaven’s light;
Then rolling back, revealed the high stars
And earth all radiant in the noon of night.

My mind is in a turmoil, uncertain whether I wake or dream. I gaze at the sky with
sighs of disappointmnent; I wait in uncertainty with weeping eyes. My speech grows
silent: only the music of the wind in the grove of bamboos is to be heard, and the
wing-beats of birds as they fly off startled, and the plopping sounds of fish as they
nibble at the surface of the water.
Blest Spirit, may my lament go up to thee; may my rite be acceptable to thee.
Wuhu aizai! Receive this offering!

When he had finished reading, he made a little flame with the burner and set fire to
the silk. Then he poured the tea out on the ground as a libation, scattered the
flowers, and emptied the water out of the vase. He continued to linger there after he
had finished, as though unable to tear himself away, and the little maid had to
remind him several times that they ought to be getting back. He had just started to
go when a laughing voice called out ‘Stop a minute!’ and the maid, turning to look
behind her, saw with terror that a female form was stepping out of the bushes.
‘Help!’ she cried. ‘It’s a ghost! Skybright’s spirit really has come back!’
Bao-yu looked back too. But whether or not it was a ghost he saw will be revealed in
the following chapter.




CHAPTER 79

Xue Pan finds to his sorrow that he is
married to a termagant
And Ying-chun’s parents betroth her
to a Zhong-shan wolf



At the end of the last chapter our story had reached a point at which, just as Bao-yu
and the little maid were beginning to walk away after completing the sacrifice to
Skybright, they were startled by the sound of a human voice coming from the
direction of the flowering hibiscus bushes. When Bao-yu looked, he saw that the
person who had called out was Dai-yu. She advanced towards him smiling.
‘A highly original elegy! It deserves to have a permanent place in literature
alongside the Elegy for the Shaman’s Daughter by Han-dan Chun!’
Bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly.
‘Most elegies one sees are so stale and derivative, I thought I’d try my hand at
writing something a bit different. It was only for my own amusement; I hadn’t
intended that anyone else should hear it. Perhaps now that you have heard it, you
will let me know of any glaring errors you may have noticed and help me to correct
them.’
‘Where is the original text?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I should need to have a careful look at the
text first before venturing on any criticism. It was such a long piece, I could barely
make out what most of it was about. There were a couple of lines somewhere near
the middle that caught my attention:

The young man in his crimson-curtained bed must seem most cruelly afflicted;
And the maiden beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated.

The general sentiment is all right, but I thought “crimson-curtained bed” a trifle
shop-worn. I don’t see why you used that image when there is a much better one to
hand.’
‘Oh, what’s that?’ said Bao-yu.
‘We’ve all got this rose-coloured haze diaphene in our windows,’ said Dai-yu.
‘Instead of “the young man in his crimson-curtained bed”, why not say ‘the young
man at his rosy-misted casement”?’
Bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly.
‘Excellent! How clever of you to have thought of it! It only goes to show that there
is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look. Stupid people
like me fail to think of the obvious. Actually though, I haven’t got that sort of gauze in
my windows; so though “rosy-misted case?ment” is a great improvement, I don’t
think I had better use it. It would be fine for you to use it, but I think if I did it would
be a bit presumptuous.’
‘But why?’ said Dai-yu, smiling. ‘My window is your window. It is unfriendly to be
so punctilious. Look at the ancients who used to “lend furs and horses and feel no
resentment when they came back the worse for wear”. And that was to mere
acquaintances: we two are members of the same family.’
‘I agree with you that one ought to share with one’s friends,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and not
only furs and horses, but even more precious things if one has them. But for a mere
male to arrogate to himself what properly belongs to you girls would be quite a
different matter. It would be better to alter “young man” and “maiden” and let it be
your elegy. After all, you were always very well-disposed towards Skybright. I’d rather
give the elegy to someone else than throw away your “rosy-misted casement”. Let’s
make it:
The mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted;
And the maid beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated.

I should be very happy to alter it in that way, even though it would mean that the
elegy would cease to have anything to do with me.’
‘She wasn’t my maid,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t make sense. Besides, “mistress” and
“maid” are such an unpoetical combination. I might want to use this version when
Nightingale is dead, but that won’t be for a long while yet, I imagine.’
‘Come now, it’s not very nice to talk about Nightingale dying,’ said Bao-yu, laughing.
‘You started it,’ said Dai-yu.
‘I know what,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’ve got a still better solution. Why don’t we just say:

I by my rosy-misted casement seem most cruelly afflicted;
And you beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated?’

Dai-yu momentarily changed colour; yet though the words filled her with an almost
unbearable feeling of premonitory dread, she masked it with a smile and nodded
approvingly at his suggestion.
‘Yes, that’s a great improvement. Better not tamper with the words any more or
you will spoil them. You ought in any case to be getting back now. I’m sure you must
have more important things to attend to. When I saw your mother just now, she was
briefing someone to tell you that you are to go to your Aunt Xing’s place first thing
tomorrow morning. It seems that your Cousin Ying’s betrothal has been decided on. I
expect they want you there for the ceremony.’
‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bao-yu, a trifle pettishly. ‘I’ve not been feeling particularly
well lately. I may not be well enough to go there tomorrow.’
‘How typical!’ said Dai-yu. ‘I should try to grow out of these childish ways if I were
you. You are getting too old -’
She broke off in a fit of coughing. Bao-yu at once became concerned about her.
‘There’s a nasty wind here. I don’t know why we are standing around in the cold
like this. We’d better be getting back now. There’s no sense in making ourselves ill.’
‘I ought to be going back now in any case,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It’s time I went to bed.
We’ll see each other again tomorrow.’
She began to walk away. Bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction.
Suddenly it occurred to him that Dai-yu was unaccompanied and he told the little
maid to run after her and see her back to her apartment.
Back at Green Delights he found some old women with a message from his mother. It
was as Dai-yu had said. He was to go over first thing next morning to his Uncle She’s
house.

*

The family that Jia She was proposing to marry his daughter into was called Sun. They
were a Da-tong family whose menfolk had all, for several generations, been Army
officers. A former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the
Ning and Rong brothers, so their claim to a special relationship with the Jia family
was a strong One. Only one member of the family was at present living in the capital,
a young man called Sun Shao-zu who had been given the post of Military Provost in
the metropolitan garrison as an heredi?tary entitlement. He was a tall,
powerfully-built, impressive-looking young man; he drew a good bow, had a good
seat on a horse, and knew how to bear himself well in company and please those
whom it was important to please. Still under thirty and with his family’s not
inconsiderable wealth behind him, he had excellent prospects. Already the War
Department had marked him out for promotion. And he was unmarried. From every
point of view - the special relationship between their two houses, the Sun family’s
wealth, and the personality of the young man himself - Jia She regarded this as being
the almost perfect match and informed Grandmother Jia of his choice. Grandmother
Jia by no means shared his enthusiasm; however, after reflecting that the couplings
of young people are to a large extent fated and that, as Jia She was after all the girl’s
father, it was not really for her to interfere, she made some neutral response such as
‘I see’ or ‘Oh, are you?’ and left it at that.
Jia Zheng felt a much more positive antipathy to the match. He detested the Suns.
Though the connection between the two families was a long-standing one, it had
come about because Sun Shao-zu’s grandfather, who had been the worst possible
sort of social climber, had wormed his way into the patronage of Jia Zheng’s
grandfather and great-uncle for the sole purpose of concluding some dubious
business that he could not have brought off on his own. In Jia Zheng’s view they
lacked both education and breeding. He spoke to Jia She on two separate occasions
advising him very strongly against the match; but as Jia She refused to take the
slightest bit of notice, there was nothing much he could do.
Bao-yu had never met Sun Shao-zu before. Obliged to do so at his uncle’s place next
day and to make such small-talk as he was capable of, he was appalled, in the course
of conversation, to discover just how soon the marriage was to be: it seemed that
Ying-chun would be going to her husband’s house before the end of that year. When
some time later Lady Ying came over to tell Grandmother Jia that she now wanted to
move Ying-chun out of the Garden for good, he became even more depressed. That
strange apathy they had observed in him on previous occasions again came over him.
The news that Ying-chun would be taking four maids with her to the Sun household
provoked some stamping and groans and the remark that ‘five more decent people
were now lost to the world’; but it was only a momentary outburst.
He took to wandering about for hours on end in the neighbourhood of Amaryllis Eyot,
now shuttered and forlorn and with only one or two women of the night-watch on
duty in it. The very reeds and knotgrass along its banks and the caltrops and
pondweed in the water seemed to have taken on a wilting, dejected look, as if they
too were missing the presence of their former tenant. All the charm and colour
which had once endeared the spot to him seemed now to have abandoned it. So
strong was this feeling, that it eventually began forming itself into a poem, the words
of which came almost unbidden to his lips.

The pool’s pink-petalled lotus crowns have gone,
By one night’s nipping wind of autumn blown;
Like stricken mourners, knotgrass and caltrop-heads
Under the weight of frost and dew bow down;
And the board whose Go-stones clicked the long day through
With mud of sluttish swallows is blotched brown.
Old poets for parted friends made such a din:
What grief must mine be then for closest kin?

Just as he had finished reciting this poem, Bao-yu heard a laugh behind him.
‘What are you mooning about for this time?’
Bao-yu glanced back and saw that it was Caltrop. He turned to greet her.
‘My dear Caltrop! What brings you here today? You are becoming quite a stranger
in this Garden.’
Caltrop clapped her hands as if she found his question a great joke.
‘I am always longing to come here,’ she said, ‘but now that your Cousin Pan is home
again, I am no longer a free agent. Just now Mrs Xue was trying to get hold of Mrs
Lian and they told her that she was in the Garden. I asked for the job of going to look
for her simply as an excuse for coming here. I have just seen Mrs Lian’s maid and she
told me that her mistress is with Mrs Zhu in Sweet-rice Village. I’m on my way there
now. Tell me, how is Aroma these days? And how was it that Skybright died so
suddenly? What was wrong with her? And Miss Ying - she moved out very suddenly,
didn’t she? Just look at this place, it already looks deserted!’
Bao-yu did his best to answer her. He also invited her to accompany him back to
Green Delights and have some tea there.
‘I can’t at the moment,’ said Caltrop. ‘Wait till I’ve seen Mrs Lian and given her my
message and I’ll come and see you then.’
‘What’s this important message that you are in such a hurry to give her?’ said
Bao-yu.
‘It has to do with your Cousin Pan getting married.’
‘I see,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Who did they finally settle on? They seemed to be wrangling
about it for months. It seemed to be Miss Zhang one day, Miss Li the next, and the
day after that Miss Wang. One wondered what the unfortunate girls had done to
deserve being considered for such a fate.’
‘Well you can forget about them now,’ said Caltrop, ‘because it’s all been settled.’
‘What family does the one they’ve chosen belong to?’ said Bao-yu.
‘A family that was related to our family by marriage once before,’ said Caltrop.
‘Your Cousin Pan called in on them last year during his travels. They are Imperial
Purveyors like us, registered with the Ministry of Finance, and one of the wealthiest
families in the capital. All your folk here seemed to have heard of them when we told
them. In fact everyone in the city, from Imperial Princes to shopkeepers, has heard of
the Cassia Xias.’
‘Oh,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Why do they call them that?’
‘They are, as I say, very, very rich,’ said Caltrop, ‘and they own a great deal of land.
Several hundred acres of their land are devoted just to growing cassia alone. All the
cassia sold in shops in the city is supplied by them, and all the cassia, both cut
flowers and potted plants, on display in the Palace. That’s how they got the nickname.
Old Mr Xia that used to be head of the business is dead now. There’s only his widow
left and a young Miss Xia. No son. It’s sad to think that the family may die out.’


‘Spare your sorrow,’ Said Bao-yu. ‘What about this young lady? Why did Mr Xue
take a fancy to her?’
‘Partly I suppose it was because they were destined for each other and partly it was
a case of “beauty in the eye of the beholder”,’ said Caltrop smiling. ‘Years ago when
they were little and their two families were often visiting each other, your cousin and
Miss Xia used to play together and call each other’s parents “Auntie” and “Uncle”.
When your cousin went to call on them last year, Mrs Xia, having no son of her own
and seeing him now for the first time as a grown-up man, felt more as if she was
welcoming a long-lost son. She was quite overcome, laughing and crying by turns;
and of course she insisted that he and her daughter should see each other. Well it
seems that the daughter has grown into a great beauty, and is educated, too, having
been taught by a private tutor. Your cousin was quite bowled over. Mrs Xia even had
the older men from the shop who were travelling with your cousin to stay with her.
They must have spent three or four days in her house. She’d like to have kept them
even longer and they had quite a job persuading her that they needed to be getting
back. When they did get back, your cousin could speak of nothing else. Almost as
soon as he’d set foot in the door he was telling Mrs Xue that she must get him the
young lady for his wife. Mrs Xue was quite agreeable. She’d seen Miss Xia when she
was a little girl, and she knew the families were well-matched. So after talking it over
with Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian, she sent someone to see Mrs Xia about the
betrothal and it was settled almost immediately. The only snag is, they’ve fixed the
date for the wedding a bit on the early side, which means a terrible rush to get ready.
Still, I’m longing for her to be here. Think of it: another person to write poetry with!’
‘Hmn, maybe,’ said Bao-yu. ‘All the same, I am a bit worried for you.’
‘What do you mean?’ said Caltrop. ‘I’m afraid I don’t understand you.’
‘I should have thought it was obvious enough,’ said Bao- yu. ‘Isn’t there a fear that
if somebody else appears on the scene Cousin Pan will lose interest in you?’
Caltrop’s face reddened and she stared back at him coldly.
‘What sort of talk is that? I used to think that we respected each other, you and I.
Now I am beginning to understand what people mean when they say that you are
the kind of person with whom it is impossible to be friendly.’
She turned on her heel and walked away, giving him no chance to reply.
A sense of desolation came over Bao-yu. It was as if a part of him had been
irretrievably lost. For some minutes he stood vacantly staring after her, like an idiot.
Returning at last in great dejection to Green Delights, he shortly afterwards went to
bed. But he did not sleep well that night. Several times in the course of it he called
out Skybright’s name in his sleep or woke up in terror from some frightful dream. His
body next morning was feverish and he seemed to have lost all appetite for food and
drink.
The events of the past few weeks - the raid on the Garden, Chess’s dismissal,
Ying-chun’s departure, Skybright’s death and all the attendant humiliation, shock and
grief had been too much for him. They now combined with the effects of the chill he
had taken in his recent loiterings in the autumnal Garden to lay him on his back for
several weeks. Grandmother Jia came over daily to Green Delights to visit him and
Lady Wang began to regret that her concern about Skybright had caused her to deal
with him so harshly. However, she gave no outward indication of this change of heart
beyond renewing her orders to the womenservants to take special care of him. Twice
every day the doctor called to take his pulses and. supervise his dosing. It was a
whole month before he began to show signs of improvement, and even then the
doctor insisted that he would require a hundred days of convalescence before he
could return to a normal diet or be allowed to set foot outside his courtyard.
The restraints of this period of convalescence, during which all his amusements had
to be taken inside his own room, soon proved extremely irksome. By the time forty
or fifty of the hundred days had gone by, he was already fairly exploding with
impatience; but all his pleading and all the ruses he adopted to get the sentence
altered were in vain. Both Grand?mother Jia and Lady Wang were adamant. Resigned
at last to another fifty days of confinement, he concentrated his energies on thinking
up ever more ingenious and outrageous ways in which he and his maids could pass
the time.
News reached him in his confinement of the superb plays and banquets with which
Xue Pan celebrated the arrival of his new bride. Everyone said she was good-looking,
and not only that, but literate and able to write a tolerable hand. Bao?-yu would
have given anything to go over and meet her; but of course he could not.
Not long after that came news of Ying-chun’s wedding, and Bao-yu realized with a
pang that the affectionate, brother-and-sister-like relationship of their childhood
years was now at an end: from now on, even if they ever met, they would have to be
formal and distant with each other. It made him doubly despondent when he
reflected that he had not even been able to see her before she left. However, he
decided to keep his troubles to himself. For the time being he continued to
con?centrate on thinking up new ways of passing the time. At least there was one
good thing about his confinement: he no longer had Jia Zheng urging him and
threatening him about his studies. During those hundred days of convalescence he
and the maids all but took Green Delights apart. No form of diversion was too wild or
hare-brained for him to try, and things were done then that cannot have been
thought of before or since. We will not tax the reader’s credulity by attempting to
describe them.
*
After delivering her snub for what she mistakenly believed to be a deliberate
rudeness, Caltrop decided that in future it would be best to keep away from Bao-yu
as much as possible, even to the extent of avoiding visits to the Garden altogether.
This was not difficult, since she was at the time fully occupied with preparations for
Xue Pan’s wedding.
Caltrop had persuaded herself that when there was another woman in the house -
someone who would take a share of the responsibilities and whose authority she
herself could fall back on - life would be somehow easier for her than it was at
present. The young lady Xue Pan was marrying was said to be not only beautiful but
educated; it followed, in Caltrop’s reasoning, that she must be gentle and ladylike as
well. Caltrop awaited her arrival even more impatiently than Xue Pan, and resolved
to serve her, when she came, with all the devotion and care of which she was
capable.
The young lady of whom Caltrop entertained such high expectations was still only
seventeen. It is true that she was not at all bad-looking; she could even read quite a
number of words; and if subtle deviousness of character had been an examinable
qualification, she might have come out a good second to Xi-feng. Her chief drawback
sprang from the fact that she had lost her father at a very early age; and as her
widowed mother had no other child of her own and doted on her excessively, she
had been thoroughly spoiled. By treating her every whim as law and gainsaying her
nothing, her mother had turned her into a monster. In her own estimation Miss Xia
was a bodhisattva; all other creatures were as dust beneath her feet. The exterior she
presented to the world made one think of the flowers in spring; underneath it there
were light?nings and tornadoes. At home, in the bosom of the family, her maids
learned to gauge the severity of her tantrums: if she was only slightly vexed, she
would curse them; if she was gravely displeased, they would be beaten. As for her
views on matrimony: Miss Xia - or Xia Jin-gui to give her her full name - considered
that if she wanted to be mistress in her own house, it behoved her to put her
maidenly modesty and the gentleness that was habitual with her aside and show a
little authority. It would be necessary to keep the others in their place. Xue Pan in
particular, because of his wilfulness and intransigence, must be broken in as quickly
as possible, or she would never be able to establish her dominion and plant her flag
in this new territory. The discovery that there was a beautiful and intelligent young
concubine in this household she was entering aroused feelings in her akin to those
expressed by the founder of the Song dynasty when he likened the world to a
bedroom and declared that none but he should snore in it.
Because of her name ‘Jin-gui’, which means ‘cassia’ and the abundance of
cassia-trees cultivated by her family, Xia Jin-gui had always insisted on strict
avoidance of the syllables ‘jin’ and ‘gui’ and the word ‘cassia’ by her maids and any
other inferiors who had to do with her. Of course, cassia?flowers had from time to
time to be referred to somehow or other, so, bearing in mind the myth about the
cassia-tree that grows beside the palace of Chang E in the moon, she decreed that
cassia should always be referred to in her presence as ‘Chang E’s flower’. The notion
that in doing this she was in some way conferring on herself the status of a
moon-goddess was perhaps not entirely absent from her mind. At all events, the
luckless maid who carelessly let out a ‘jin’ or a ‘gui’ in her presence or who was
incautious enough to utter the dread word ‘cassia’ was in for a savage beating and
would probably lose her pay for a month or two as well.
Now Xue Pan was one of those fickle natures always ready to be ‘off with the old love
and on with the new’; and in spite of all his bluster, he was only pot-valiant, having
little stamina, or stomach either, for a long-drawn-out trial of strength. While the
novelty of his marriage still lasted, he was, in any case, only too willing to defer in
everything to his beautiful young bride. Jin-gui quickly grasped what sort of person
she had to deal with and exploited her advantage to the utmost. During the first
month of their marriage things stood about equally between them, but by the end of
the second month Jin-gui’s star was definitely in the ascendant.
One day, after drinking rather more than was good for him, Xue Pan went to see
Jin-gui about something he wanted them both to do. On meeting with determined
opposition to his proposal, he finally lost patience with her and, after some angry
shouting, walked out on her in a temper. Jin-gui wept abandonedly, refused to eat or
drink, and eventually succeeded in persuading everyone that she was ill. A doctor
was sum?moned who pronounced her to be suffering from a ‘collision of blood and
air’ and prescribed a lenitive medicine to ease the clogged passages of the breath.
Aunt Xue gave Xue Pan a furious dressing-down.
‘You’re a married man now and soon you’ll be a father. I don’t know how you can
carry on like this. Here’s a girl as rare as a phoenix chick, a beautiful, delicate creature,
reared up with I don’t know how much loving care by her family - they only let her
marry you because they thought you had enough human decency to look after her
properly - and what do you do? Instead of making an effort to control yourself and
settling down to live in peace and harmony with her as a husband ought to do, you
carry on just as you always did, drinking too much and treating the girl like a
barbarian. So now we have to spend money on expensive doctor’s bills and put up
with this quite unnecessary anxiety, all because of you.’
Xue Pan felt thoroughly remorseful after this lecture and went back to Jin-gui to try
and make it up with her. But Jin-gui had heard the lecture too and was encouraged by
it to behave even more outrageously than before. Xue Pan’s pacific overtures were
ignored. He had to humble himself still further. It took a fortnight of patient
wheedling to talk his wife into a more satisfactory frame of mind. By that time the
self?-assurance that had once been characteristic of him was very much in abeyance.
Having already, in this first encounter, caused her husband to lower his colours and at
the same time discovered that her mother-in-law was harmless, Jin-gui began
pressing forwards in quest of yet further victories. At first she would do no more than
consolidate her ascendancy over Xue Pan; then, using her feminine charms to make
him her instrument, she would extend her dominion over Aunt Xue; and finally
Bao-chai too should be brought under her control. But Bao-chai saw through her
sister-in-law’s little game very quickly and was able to meet ruse with ruse - even, by
means of an occasional quiet but well-placed remark, to give her ambitions some
check. Finding that she was not to be taken with cunning, Jin-gui began looking for
occasions for a direct confrontation with her; but as Bao-chai was equally careful not
to give her any, she was for the time being obliged, albeit reluctantly, to treat her
with respect.
One day, having nothing better to do, Jin-gui engaged Caltrop in conversation. When,
in answer to her questions, Caltrop told her that she had no recollection of her home
and parents, Jin-gui was displeased. She felt sure that Caltrop knew really but was
withholding the information out of malice.
‘Who gave you the name “Caltrop”?’ she asked her.
‘Miss Bao,’ said Caltrop.
Jin-gui sneered.
‘People are always saying how clever your Miss Bao is. I can’t see that she showed
much cleverness in choosing you that name.’
‘If you say that of Miss Bao,’ said Caltrop warmly, ‘it must be because you have
never had occasion to test her knowledge. Even Sir Zheng has often spoken
admiringly of Miss Bao’s learning.’
Jin-gui’s reaction to that remark will be related in the chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 80

Unfortunate Caltrop is battered by
a philandering husband
And One Plaster Wang prescribes for
an insufferable wife



Jin-gui reacted to Caltrop’s defence of Bao-chai’s intelli?gence with a toss of the head,
a scornful curl of the lip and a couple of loud, contemptuous sniffs.
‘ The flowers that girls are named after are supposed to be beautiful,
sweet-smelling ones. What is there beautiful or sweet-smelling about a
caltrop-flower? If you’re going to call caltrop-flowers sweet-smelling, then what are
you going to say of the flowers that are really fragrant? It’s a ridiculous choice for a
name.’
‘But caltrop-flowers are sweet-smelling,’ said Caltrop. ‘A lot of water-plants are.
Even lotus-leaves and lotus-pods have a certain fragrance - not to be compared with
the scent of flowers, perhaps; but in very still weather, especially very early in the
morning or very late at night, they have a delicious, cool fragrance that is in some
ways superior to that of flowers. Even caltrops themselves and cock’s heads and the
roots and leaves of reed-grass have a lovely fresh scent after dew or rain; it makes
you feel good just to smell it;’
‘To hear you speak,’ said Jin-gui, ‘anyone would think that orchid and cassia were
not particularly fragrant.’
Caltrop, warming to the argument, momentarily forgot Jin-gui’s taboo.
‘Ah now, orchid and cassia are quite different,’ she began; but before she could get
any further, Moonbeam was pointing a finger in her face and crowing over her in
malicious triumph:
     ‘You’ll catch it now! That’s the mistress’s name you’ve just said.’
     Caltrop was overcome with confusion and hurriedly apologized for her lapse.
     ‘I’m truly sorry, madam. It was a slip of the tongue. I hope you won’t hold it
against me.’
     Jin-gui smiled magnanimously.
     ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter. You don’t need to worry about that. About this name
of yours, though: I really don’t think that “Caltrop” is very appropriate. I should like
to change it, but I don’t know whether you would be willing to let me.’
     ‘Oh, madam, what a thing to say!’ said Caltrop, smiling. ‘I am your chattel, to do
with exactly as you wish; who am I to be willing or unwilling? If you wish to change
my name, my name already is whatever you wish to change it to!’
     Jin-gui smiled, somewhat unpleasantly.
     ‘You may say that, but I fear your Miss Bao may be rather less happy about it.
     ‘Ah no, madam. You see, when I was bought by the family, I used first to work for
Mrs Xue: that’s how Miss Bao came to give me my name, not because I was Miss
Bao’s own maid. Then after that I served the master. Miss Bao has nothing to do with
me - especially now you are here. In any case, she’s a very sensible young lady - not
at all the sort of person to make a fuss about a little thing like this.’
      ‘Very well,’ said Jin-gui: ‘in that case, since a water-lily is a much more
appropriate flower to name someone after than a caltrop, I think we ought to call
you “Lily”.’
      ‘Very good, madam, let that be my name then,’ said Caltrop, smiling.
      “Lily” she became then from that moment. Bao-chai, when she heard about it,
appeared totally unconcerned.
      Xue Pan was in some respects like the general of old in whom ‘conquest did but
breed appetite for further conquest’, for when, after his marriage to Jin-gui, he
discovered that she had an attractive, rather coquettish maid called Moon?beam, he
was continually calling to her to bring him things - cups of tea and the like - so as to
have an opportunity of flirting with her. Moonbeam perfectly well understood what
he was up to but had to behave circumspectly from fear of Jin-gui, whom she studied
carefully for some sign which would indicate how she wanted her to respond.
     Jin-gui had indeed noticed Xue Pan’s interest in her maid and reasoned within
herself as follows.
     ‘I’ve been wanting to deal with Caltrop, but so far haven’t found a way of getting
at her. Since he’s already taken a fancy to Moonbeam, I might just as well let him
have Moon?beam, because he’s sure to grow cooler towards Caltrop as a
consequence and I shall be able to take advantage of that in order to get rid of
Caltrop; and with Caltrop out of the way, settling Moonbeam’s hash ought to be easy,
because Moonbeam is my own servant.’
     Having decided on a strategy, she had only to await a suitable opportunity of
putting it into practice. Such an opportunity occurred one evening when Xue Pan,
having drunk himself into a state of cheerful inebriation, called as was his wont to
Moonbeam to bring him some tea. While Moonbeam was handing him the cup, he
deliberately gave her fingers a squeeze; Moonbeam, with a very unnatural
affectation of modesty, drew back her hand; and since neither of them had their
minds on what they were doing, the cup crashed to the floor, splashing hot tea over
Moonbeam’s skirt and everything else round about. Xue Pan tried to cover up his
embarrassment by pretending that Moonbeam had not handed him the cup properly,
while Moonbeam for her part said that the master had not ‘taken a proper hold’.
     Jin-gui hooted at them contemptuously.
     ‘You two really are a comedy! You must think I’m an idiot.’
     Xue Pan hung his head and laughed sheepishly and Moonbeam fled blushing
from the room when, not long after this, it was time to go to bed, Jin-gui tried to turn
Xue Pan out of the bedroom and make him sleep elsewhere. She said she was tired of
seeing him go around all the time looking as if he was wasting away with passion.
Xue Pan smiled foolishly and said nothing.
     ‘If you want to do something, why don’t you tell me?’ she said. ‘All this groping
in corners will get you nowhere.’
     Encouraged by her words and fortified by what he had drunk against any feeling
of shame, he knelt down on the bed-covers beside her and seized her hand.
     ‘Listen, lover,’ he said: ‘if you will let me have your Moonbeam, I’ll give you
anything you ask for - anything at all. If it’s human brains you want, I shall see that
you have them.’
     ‘What nonsense you talk!’ said Jin-gui. ‘What do I care who you go to bed with?
Just don’t make a fool of yourself by carrying on in front of the others, that’s all I ask.’
     Xue Pan was so pleased and grateful that it seemed he would never stop
thanking her. That night he performed his conjugal duties with exemplary
thoroughness. Every sinew was strained to give Jin-gui pleasure. He did not go out
next morning, but hung around at home, waiting for an opportunity of exploiting his
new-found licence.
      A little after midday Jin-gui rather pointedly went out in order to leave the coast
clear. Xue Pan lost no time in setting to work on Moonbeam, who, since she now had
a pretty good idea of her mistress’s intentions, put up only a token resistance to his
advances. Carnal congress seemed imminent. But Jin-gui had been waiting for this
moment only in order to frustrate it.
      Jin-gui had a maid called Orfie who had been with her in her mother’s house
since she was a child. Orfie had lost both her patents when she was little and had no
one else to look after her, so when she first entered service with the Xias, she was
invariably referred to as ‘the little orphan’. Her name ‘Orfie’ was simply a convenient
contraction of this. Orfie’s duties were normally of a rough and menial kind, but on
this occasion she was employed by her mistress on a task requiring some finesse.
      ‘Orfie,’ said Jin-gui, ‘do you think you could tell Lily to fetch my handkerchief
from my room and bring it to me? You needn’t let her know that it was I who sent
you.’
      Orfie went off to look for Caltrop.
      ‘Miss Lily,’ she said when she had found her, ‘the mistress has left her
handkerchief in her room. Why don’t you go and get it for her?’
      Caltrop had recently been puzzled by Jin-gui’s hostility, and, in her efforts to
overcome it, was constantly thinking of things that she could do to please her. Since
Orfie’s suggestion seemed to offer a means of winning favour, she sped off without a
second thought to do the errand, bursting into the room at the very moment when
Xue Pan and Moonbeam were in the interesting situation we have just described. She
turned back, blushing to the tips of her ears, but not in time to escape the notice of
the other two.
      Xue Pan himself was fairly unconcerned. Jin-gui was the only person he feared,
and as Jin-gui had given her consent, he cared nothing about what anyone else might
think. He had not even bothered to shut the door. But Moonbeam minded very much.
Being by nature a disputatious, somewhat self-righteous young woman, she found it
peculiarly galling that Caltrop of all people should have seen her at such a moment.
Pushing Xue Pan away from her, she ran out of the room, protesting, with cries of
angry complaint, that he had been attempting to rape her.
      The effect of this upon Xue Pan was that all the excitement generated by his
tussling with Moonbeam was transformed into animosity against Caltrop. He rushed
outside and spat at her.
     ‘Little harlot! What do you man by it, wandering around the place like a
damned disembodied ghost?’
     He might have done her an injury, but Caltrop, sensing that she was in mortal
danger, ran as fast as her legs would carry her and managed to get away. Abandoning
the chase, he went back to look for Moonbeam but could find no trace of her. This
increased his anger against Caltrop, whom he cursed once more in her absence. After
dinner that evening, when he had once again drunk himself merry, he decided to
take a bath. On testing the water with his foot and finding it to be too hot, he insisted
that Caltrop had done it deliberately, intending to harm him, ran after her, stark
naked as he was, and gave her a couple of kicks. Caltrop had long grown unused to
such savage treatment; but things had now reached such a pass that she dared not
complain and ran off to weep alone and nurse her injuries in silence.
     Meanwhile Jin-gui had secretly instructed Moonbeam to place herself at Xue
Pan’s disposal that very night in Caltrop’s bedroom. She ordered Caltrop to move in
with her, and when she refused, said she supposed that it was because she found her
room dirty or was too lazy to wait on her at night. She pretended to think that it was
Xue Pan who had inspired her refusal.
‘That master of yours is such a barbarian,’ she said. ‘He has only to look at a girl to
want her for himself. Now he’s taken my maid away, yet he won’t let me have you in
her place. What’s his idea, I wonder? Does he want to drive me to my death?’
Xue Pan, for whose ears this was, of course, intended, became apprehensive that the
difficulties Caltrop was making might once more prevent him from enjoying
Moonbeam, and he came rushing into Caltrop’s room to rebuke her.
‘Don’t you realize, this is an honour your mistress is doing you? You do as you’e told
and sleep with her, or I’ll give you a beating!’
Caltrop had now no choice but to roll up her bedding and carry it into Jin-gui’s room.
Jin-gui told her to make her bed up on the floor. This order too she had to obey. As
soon as she had settled down for the night, Jin-gui called to her for some tea. Caltrop
brought her the tea and lay down again. A little after that Jin-gui called to her to
come and massage her legs. And so it went on, seven or eight times in the course of
the night, so that it was impossible for Caltrop to get right off to sleep or even to rest
properly.
Now that Xue Pan had got Moonbeam, he was like a man who has come into
possession of a priceless jewel. He forsook all other interests for her. This secretly
enraged Jin-gui, who could not forbear some jealous mutterings when she was on
her own.
‘Enjoy yourself while you can, my friend,’ she would say. ‘I shall get round to you in
the end. And when I do, you had better not complain!’
For the time being, however, she refrained from outbursts and set about laying a trap
for Caltrop. About a fortnight after Caltrop moved into her room she suddenly
pretended to be ill. She complained of agonizing pains in the heart and appeared
unable to move her limbs. Nothing they did for her seemed to bring relief. The
servants said it must have been brought on by something Caltrop had done to upset
her.
A couple of days later, as one of the maids was shaking out Jin-gui’s pillow, a cut-out
paper mannikin fell out of it. It had the eight symbols of her nativity written on it and
five needles sticking into it, one in the heart and one in each of the limbs. This item
of news was thought sufficiently inter?esting to be reported to Aunt Xue, instantly
throwing that poor lady into a highly inflammable state of nervous com?motion. The
effect the news had upon Xue Pan was even more violent. He was for having all the
servants flogged immediately until one of them confessed to having planted the
paper figure; but Jin-gui prevented him.
‘Why make the innocent suffer?’ she said. ‘I expect it’s Moonbeam who did it, to
get me out of the way.’
‘That’s most unfair,’ said Xue Pan. ‘When, during this past week or two, has
Moonbeam had the time to go inside your room?’
‘Who else could it have been then?’ said Jin-gui. ‘I suppose you don’t think I’d do it
to myself? Moonbeam is the only one who’d dare go in my room.’
'But Lily’s been in here with you all the time,’ said Xue Pan. ‘She must know, if anyone
does. She’s the one to flog if we want to find out.’
‘What’s the good of flogging anyone?’ said Jin-gui. ‘They’ll never confess anything.
If you ask me, you’d much better pretend you haven’t heard about it and let the
matter drop. When all’s said and done, it doesn’t much matter if I die. You can always
find yourself a better wife when you feel like it. If we’re going to be honest, the fact
of the matter is, you all three hate me, don’t you ?’
She began crying bitterly. Xue Pan was so enraged that he snatched up a door-bar
and rushed off in search of Caltrop straight away. He began hitting her with it as soon
as he found her, on the head, on the face, on the body, shouting accusations at her
but giving her no chance to deny them. Aunt Xue came running out in answer to
Caltrop’s anguished cries and shouted to him to stop.
‘How can you beat the girl like that without first making an attempt to find out
what has happened? She’s given us years of faithful service: it’s unthinkable that
she’d do a thing like that. Time enough to start laying about you after you’ve made a
serious attempt to get to the bottom of it.’
When Jin-gui heard her mother-in-law saying this, she was afraid that Xue Pan might
weaken. Her crying rose in pitch into a sort of plaintive yell.
‘You have monopolized Moonbeam now for over a fortnight and refused to let
anyone but Lily sleep with me. You rush to Moonbeam’s defence when I say you
ought to flog her, and now you get in a temper and start beating Lily. I don’t know
why you don’t stop all this play-acting and get rid of me; then you will be free to pick
a really rich, good-looking girl to marry.’
Her words had the intended effect of further inflaming Xue Pan. Aunt Xue could see
that her son was being manipu?lated and was thoroughly disgusted by the
unscrupulous way in which Jin-gui maintained her hold on him. But what could she
do? She knew the weakness of her son’s character and realized that his subservience
to Jin-gui had already become a habit. Evidently he had seduced Jin-gui’s maid, that
much was clear; yet Jin-gui was one moment accusing him of forcibly ‘monopolizing’
the girl, while the next moment she seemed to claim credit for deferring like a good
wife to his wishes. And who could be responsible for the black magic? The proverb
says that even the wisest judge will hesi?tate to pronounce on household matters.
Adapting it to the present circumstances, it might be said that even a parent finds it
difficult to pronounce on the marital problems of his offspring. Aunt Xue, certainly,
felt quite helpless when con?fronted with those of her son. She could only shout at
him in exasperation.
‘Worthless creature！Even a dog would behave in a more seemly manner than you
do! Now, it seems, you have got your muddy paws onto your wife’s own maid that
she brought with her from her home. You’ve heard her yourself accusing you of
taking the girl away from her. How are you going to show your face anywhere when
other people get to hear about it? And this other business: Heaven only knows who
is responsible; yet here you go, lashing out at this poor child here before making the
slightest effort to find out what really happened. We all know what a fickle creature
you are, but really! What a return for the years of loyal service she has given you! I
don’t care how dissatisfied you are with her, you ought not to beat her. I’ll get a
dealer here right away and have her sold; that’s the only way to settle this. Then you
won’t be troubled by her any more. Come, girl!’ she said to caltrop, ‘get your things
together and come with me.’ She turned to the other servants. ‘Quickly now, go and
get the dealer! It doesn’t matter what we sell her for; just let’s get rid of this - this
thorn in the flesh, and perhaps we shall have a bit of peace again in this household!’
Xue Pan, seeing that his mother was really angry, stood with bowed head throughout
this tirade and made no attempt to reply. It was Jin-gui’s strident wail from inside the
window that answered her.
‘Whether you want to sell the girl or not, Mrs Xue, I think you might leave me out
of it. Are you implying that I’m such a vinegar-wife that I can’t tolerate an inferior?
And what do you mean, “thorn in the flesh”? Thorn in whose flesh? Even if I did hate
her so much, I wouldn’t let him have my own maid to replace her with.’
‘What sort of manners are these?’ Aunt Xue was trembling all over and her voice
was choking. ‘Since when did it become acceptable for a young woman to shout at
her mother?-in-law through the window? I was under the impression that you had
been brought up in an educated household. All this shouting and screaming - I can’t
make out what you are trying to say.’
Xue Pan stamped his foot and shouted at Jin-gui despair?ingly.
‘Oh stop, stop! You’ll have everyone laughing at us.’
Jin-gui, thinking, no doubt, that having gone so far she might as well go all the way,
only shouted the louder.
‘Why should I care if people laugh at us? Your darling chamber-wife has been trying
to do me in. Is this a time to start worrying about whether people are laughing at us
or not? Why don’t you keep her and sell me instead? Everyone knows how rich the
Xues are and how they make use of their money in order to trample on other people.
And everyone knows about their fine relations who will always step in and slap
anyone down for them who is giving them trouble. What are you waiting for? I don’t
know why you married me in the first place if you find me so unsatisfactory. I’m sure I
didn’t ask you to come running round to our house, begging and entreating my
mother to let you have me as your wife.’
     She rolled about on the bed, weeping and screaming and beating her bosom.
Xue Pan was beside himself. Whether he rebuked her, reasoned with her, beat her, or
begged her to be silent, it seemed unlikely that anything he did would have much
effect. He could only stump in and out of the room, sighing and groaning
inarticulately, and concluded by exclaim?ing, with great bitterness, that he was ‘a
very unlucky man’.
     Meanwhile Bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors. Aunt Xue
continued to insist that Caltrop must be sold. Bao-chai smilingly expostulated.
     ‘People like us don’t sell servants, Mamma, we only buy them. I think anger is
interfering with your judgement. What would people think if they heard that we
were planning to sell a servant? They would laugh us to scorn. If Pan and his wife are
dissatisfied with Caltrop, let her stay here and work for me. I could do with another
maid.’
     ‘If we keep her, it will seem to them like a provocation,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Much
better send her away and be done with it.
     ‘I can’t see that it makes any difference,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Provided she never goes
into the front part of the house, then as far as they are concerned, it will be just as if
she had been sold.’
     Caltrop was already at Aunt Xue’s feet begging to be allowed to stay and
protesting her willingness to serve Bao-chai as a maid. Aunt Xue was obliged to
relent.
     From now on Caltrop spent all her time with Bao-chai and stopped going into
the front part of the house altogether. She had at least security now; but for all that
she was not entirely happy. Sometimes on fine, clear nights she would gaze
wet-checked at the moon; at other times she might be heard unaccountably sighing
to herself while she trimmed a lamp.
The fact was that although she had lived with Xue Pan for several years, she had
never borne him a child. Some defect in the blood had made her unable to conceive.
And now she was ill too. The effect of all the emotional and physical outrage to which
she had recently been subjected was that a flood of fiery humour was released into
her liver, leading eventually to a drying up of the menstrual fluid. She became very
thin, yet had lost all interest in food. The doctor was called in and medicines were
prescribed, but they seemed to do her no good.
Meanwhile Jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband. Sometimes, when
drink had made him bold, Xue Pan would try to assert himself. Once or twice he went
for her with a cudgel or a knife; but Jin-gui only offered him her body to belabour, or
stretched her neck out and defied him to do his worst; and of course he could not; he
could only bluster. This soon became the established pattern of their quarrels. The
only result of it was that Jin-gui’s power over her husband grew all the stronger.
At this point Jin-gui began directing her attention on Moonbeam, picking on her and
finding fault with her. But Moonbeam was made of more inflammable stuff than
Caltrop. Up to now she and Xue Pan had got on together so swimmingly that she had
all but dismissed Jin-gui from her mind. Finding herself now under attack from that
quarter, she was unwilling to yield an inch and gave back as good as she got. When,
after a few slanging-matches, Jin-gui grew really angry and began not only to curse
her but to lay hands on her as well, she did not quite dare to return blow for blow,
but she put on a fine display of hysteria, shrieking, rolling about on the floor and
threshing about with her limbs. Thereafter she was constantly threatening suicide,
and at any hour of the day or night they might have to snatch knives or scissors from
her grasp or take down the noose which she had fastened for herself over a beam.
Between the two of them Xue Pan was driven half distracted. He could only look on
help?lessly while they quarrelled, until finally the rumpus got too much for him and
he would slip out of the house and take refuge elsewhere.
Sometimes in the intervals between quarrelling, if she was feeling cheerful, Jin-gui
would gather a few people together to play at dice or cards. She was inordinately
fond of gnawing bones, especially the bones of fowls. To satisfy this craving she had
ducks and chickens killed every day. The meat she gave to other people; it was only
the bones, crisp-fried in boiling fat, that she kept for herself, to nibble with her wine.
Sometimes, if the bone she was gnawing was giving her trouble and she grew
impatient, she would swear like a trooper.
‘That ponce and his poxy strumpet seem to enjoy themselves,’ she would say
self-pityingly. ‘Why can’t I get any enjoyment?’
Aunt Xue and Bao-chai no longer attempted to intervene. Now they could only sit in
their own room and weep in silence while they listened to the profanities next door.
Xue Pan was helpless. He bitterly regretted the brief madness which had led him to
chain himself to this demon wife. Soon everyone in the two mansions, both masters
and ser?vants, had heard about the Xues’ predicament and all felt sorry for them.
*
By this time Bao-yu’s hundred days of convalescence had ended and he was allowed
to go out. One of the first things he did was to call on Jin-gui. There was nothing
exceptionable in her behaviour or appearance on the occasion when he saw her: she
seemed to be just the same sort of delicate, flowerlike creature as all the other girls.
How did so beautiful a person come to have so appalling a character? It was a
mystery which continued to occupy him for some time after the visit.
When, a few days later, he called in to wish his mother good morning, his visit
happened to coincide with that of Ying-chun’s nurse. She brought distressing news
about Sun Shao-zu’s behaviour.
‘Whenever she is on her own, the young mistress does nothing but cry,’ said the
woman. ‘She’s longing for you to send for her so that she can enjoy a day or two of
freedom.’
‘I’ve been meaning for some days to send for her,’ said Lady Wang, ‘but so many
disagreeable things have been happening lately that I keep forgetting. Bao-yu spoke
to me about this when he got back from his visit the other day. Tomorrow is a good
day, according to the calendar. We will send for her tomorrow.’
     Just then a servant arrived from Grandmother Jia’s with a message for Bao-yu.
He was to go first thing next morning to the Tian Qi Temple to burn incense in
payment of a vow she had made for his recovery. Eager for outings after his long
confinement, he was hardly able to sleep that night for excitement.
Next day he rose at dawn, and as soon as he had washed and dressed, set off by
carriage, accompanied by two or three old nannies, and drove through the West Gate
of the city to the Tian Qi Temple outside the walls.
The Taoists of the temple had spent the previous day preparing the place for his
arrival. Because of his nervous disposition he did not care to get too close to the
hideous guardian deities and other horror-inspiring images for which this temple was
famous. As soon as he had presented the paper figures, spirit money, food and so
forth which constituted the offering, he withdrew to the residential part of the
temple and, alter taking lunch there, set off on a sight-seeing tour of the temple and
its precincts, accompanied by the old nannies and by Li Gui and the other grooms.
But the sight-seeing soon fatigued him and he withdrew to the monks’ quarters again
for a rest. The old nannies considered that it would be bad for him to sleep so soon
after eating and called in the Taoist priest-in-charge, Father Wang, to sit and talk with
him.
This Father Wang had knocked about the world in his time as an itinerant vendor of
panaceas and even now had his name-plate hung up outside the temple with an
impressive list of the pills, powders, plasters and potions that he was prepared, for a
consideration, to dispense. He was a frequent visitor at the Ning and Rong mansions
and was known to everyone there - as to everyone else outside - as ‘One Plaster
Wang’ from his habit of always concluding the patter with which he recommended
his medicaments with the same formula: ‘One plaster will suffice, ladies and
gentlemen; one single plaster will suffice.’
When One Plaster Wang arrived, Bao-yu was reclining on the kang looking
half-asleep and Li Gui and the others were doing their best to keep him awake.
‘Ah, Father Wang!’ they said as he entered. ‘You’ve come just in time. Everyone’s
always saying how good you are at telling funny stories. Won’t you tell one now for
our young master?’
‘I think I had better,’ said One Plaster Wang, smiling. ‘We don’t want him sleeping
after his lunch. The batter he’s lust eaten might start battering his insides.’
This was not a bad beginning. At least it made them all laugh. Bao-yu, laughing with
the others, got up and straightened out his clothes. One Plaster Wang ordered one of
his acolytes to ‘make some good, strong tea’.
‘Master Bao doesn’t want any of your tea,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Your room stinks of
medicine.’
‘O fie!’ said One Plaster Wang in comic outrage. ‘O monstrous imputation! Never
has medicine of any kind found its way into this room. Moreover, for the past three
or four days, ever since I heard your master was coming here, I have been burning
incense to sweeten it.’
‘I’m always hearing about your plasters,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tell me, what sort of things
are they good for?’
‘ My plasters?’ said the old Taoist. ‘Ah, now you’ve started something! It’s
impossible to do them justice in a few words. To begin with, there are one hundred
and twenty different ingredients in the ointment I use on them. Some of them
domi?nate over the others like a prince over his subjects, some of them combine
with each other in equal strength; some generate heat, some coolness; some of
them are cheap and some expensive. Internally they stabilize and fortify the humours,
enrich the blood, stimulate the appetite, tranquillize the spirits, banish excessive heat
and cold, aid digestion and loosen phlegm; externally they regularize the pulses, relax
the muscles, draw out the old, corrupt flesh, promote new growth, expel rheums and
neutralize poisons. Their efficacy is miraculous, as you yourself may see if you ever
have occasion to use one.’
‘I can hardly believe that a single plaster can do so many things,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I
wonder if the trouble I am thinking of could be cured by one.’
‘My plasters will cure any illness you like to mention,’ said the old Taoist. ‘If they
don’t give you instant relief, you are at liberty to pluck me by the beard, slap my old
face, and pull my temple down! What is the illness you have in mind?’
‘Try and guess,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If you can guess right, I shall believe in the efficacy of
your plasters.’
One Plaster Wang thought for a bit.
‘Hmn, difficult.’ He smiled slily. ‘Of course, there are some things that it’s not very
convenient to use plasters for.’
Bao-yu told all the servants but Tealeaf to go out of the room.
‘This room is too small for so many people,’ he said. ‘The air in it is becoming foul.’
Tealeaf lit a stick of Sweet Dreams incense and Bao-yu made him sit close to him,
with the lighted incense in his hand, so that he could lean on him for support.
Watching this little pantomime, the cunning old Taoist had a sudden inspiration. His
face broke into a broad grin. Coming up closer to Bao-yu, he bent down and spoke
softly into his ear.
‘I think I’ve guessed. Could it be that you have started bedchamber exercises
already and are looking for a little something to help things along?’
Almost before he had finished, Tealeaf was shouting at him indignantly.
‘Get away with you! Dirty old man!’
Bao-yu had not understood.
‘What’s that?’ he asked Tealeaf, puzzled. ‘What did he say?’
‘Never mind what he said,’ said Tealeaf. ‘Silly rubbish!’
‘You’d better tell me yourself what it is, Master Bao,’ said One Plaster Wang,
unwilling to risk another guess.
‘The thing I want to know about is jealousy,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Could one of your
plasters cure a woman of being jealous?’
One Plaster Wang clapped his hands and laughed.
‘Now there you have me! Neither my plasters nor anyone else’s could do that!’
‘They are not such great shakes after all then,’ said Bao-yu, smiling.
‘I said plasters couldn’t,’ said One Plaster Wang. ‘I know of an infusion that might.
The only thing is, it would take rather a long time. There’s no lightning cure for
jealousy.’
‘What is this infusion called?’ said Bao-yu. ‘How do you make it?’
‘It’s called Pirum saccharinum,’ said One Plaster Wang. ‘You take one very good
autumn pear, two drams of crystal sugar, one dram of bitter-peel and three cups of
water and simmer them all together until the pear is soft. If the suf?ferer can be
made to eat one such pear, together with its juices, first thing every morning, she will,
eventually, be cured.’
‘I don’t think much of that,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I can’t see that working.’
‘If it doesn’t work the first time, perhaps it will by the tenth,’ said the old Taoist. ‘If
one year’s treatment is insufficient, she must persevere for a second. And so on. At
all events, these are wholesome ingredients. A pear prepared in this way is soothing
to the lungs and stomach, innocuous to the health, sweet to the palate, lenitive for a
cough and in every way agreeable. Sooner or later the woman will die; and as there
is no jealousy (that I know of) after death, it could be said that by that time she had
been cured.’
This set Bao-yu and Tealeaf off into fits of laughter. ‘Oily-tongued old ox’ they called
him.
‘Well, what’s the harm?’ said One Plaster Wang. ‘It’s only a bit of nonsense to stop
you sleeping in the middle of the day. Making you laugh is worth much more than
any medicine. Even my plasters are only tomfoolery. Do you think if I really had a
magic formula I’d be sitting here talking to you now? I’d have taken it myself long ago
and gone off to join the immortals.’
The hour of sacrifice had now arrived and Bao-yu was invited to offer his libation and
set fire to his paper hecatomb. What remained of the more substantial part of the
offering -the foodstuffs and the wine - was shared out among the Taoists and the
others present. Having completed what he came out for, he drove back into the city.
By the time he got home Ying-chun had already been back an hour or more. The
servants who brought her were being entertained to dinner before returning to the
Sun household. Ying-chun meanwhile was in Lady Wang’s room giving her and the
cousins a tearful account of her matrimonial troubles.
‘Sun Shao-zu is an out-and-out libertine. Gambling, drinking and chasing after
women are the only things he cares about. He has corrupted practically every maid
and young woman in the house. I have protested to him about it more than once, but
he only swears at me. He calls me a “jealous little whore”. He says that Father
borrowed five thousand taels from him and spent it all, and that though he has been
round time and again to ask for it, Father re?fuses to pay it back. Then he points his
finger at me and shouts: “Don’t put on the lady wife act with me, my girl! You’re no
better than a bought slave - payment in kind for the five thousand taels your old man
owes me - and if you’re not very careful I shall give you a good beating and send you
to sleep with the maids.” He says it was Great-grandfather who took the Initiative in
making the alliance between our families because theirs was so rich and influential,
so that by rights he ought to be Father’s equal. He says he was a fool to marry me,
because that makes Father his senior; and besides, he says, it has given people the
impression that he needed our help, whereas in fact quite the reverse is true.’
Ying-chun sobbed bittely while she told them this and the others wept as they
listened. Lady Wang did her best to comfort her.
‘He’s obviously an unreasonable man,’ she said; ‘but now that you’re married to
him, there’s really nothing to be done. I remember your Uncle Zheng speaking very
strongly against the marriage to your father, but your father was so set on it, he
wouldn’t listen. It’s a bad business. My poor child! I’m afraid it must be your fate.’
Ying-chun wept.
‘I can’t believe that it was my fate to be so unhappy. After losing my mother as a
tiny child, it seemed such bliss when you brought me here to live with Cousin Wan
and the girls. And now, after just a few years of blessedness, I am to end like this!’
Lady Wang tried once more to comfort her. She suggested that Ying-chun herself
should decide where she wished to sleep.
‘Since the very first moment I left I have been longing every minute of the day and
night to be back here with the girls,’ said Ying-chun. ‘And next to them I have missed
my beloved Amaryllis Eyot. If only I might spend another four or five days in the
Garden, I think I could die content. Who knows if I shall ever be allowed to come and
stay here again?’
‘Now, now, that’s a foolish way to talk!’ said Lady Wang. ‘A little jangling between
newly married couples is the commonest thing in the world. There is no cause at all
to be so tragic about it.’
She gave orders for the rooms on Amaryllis Eyot to be made ready as quickly as
possible, and told the cousins to keep Ying-chun company and do their best to
distract her from her troubles. She particularly impressed upon Bao-yu that no word
of this was to reach the ears of Grandmother Jia.
‘If I find that Grandmother has got to hear of this,’ she warned him, ‘I shall hold you
alone responsible.’
Bao-yu had to promise that he would say nothing.
That evening saw Ying-chun installed once more in her old apartment, with everyone
round her, cousins and ser?vants alike, doing their utmost to make her feel cherished.
Three days she spent in her old apartment in the Garden; after that she had to go
and stay with Lady Xing. Before doing so she called on Grandmother Jia and Lady
Wang to say good-bye. Her leave-taking with the cousins which followed was
extremely painful. It was all that Aunt Xue and Lady Wang could do to calm the young
people in their grief.
Ying-chun stayed two days with Lady Xing and it was to Lady Xing’s place that the Sun
family servants came to collect her. Needless to say, she felt little inclined to go with
them; but fear of her husband’s evil temper made her conceal her reluctance and
hurry over her leave-taking. Lady Xing had never been much interested in her
daughter’s welfare - during the two days that Ying-chun was with her she never once
inquired whether her relations with her husband were harmonious and the duties
required of her in her new house?hold not too onerous - and such expressions of
maternal sentiment as she may have indulged in at her departure were of only the
most perfunctory and superficial kind.
As to what followed her departure: to know that, dear reader, you will have to look
into another volume.
